No historical fact is, however, better established than\nthat till nearly the end of the nineteenth century it was the general\nbelief that the ancient industrial system, with all its shocking social\nconsequences, was destined to last, with possibly a little patching, to\nthe end of time. How strange and wellnigh incredible does it seem that\nso prodigious a moral and material transformation as has taken place\nsince then could have been accomplished in so brief an interval! The\nreadiness with which men accustom themselves, as matters of course, to\nimprovements in their condition, which, when anticipated, seemed to\nleave nothing more to be desired, could not be more strikingly\nillustrated. What reflection could be better calculated to moderate the\nenthusiasm of reformers who count for their reward on the lively\ngratitude of future ages!\n\nThe object of this volume is to assist persons who, while desiring to\ngain a more definite idea of the social contrasts between the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, are daunted by the formal aspect of\nthe histories which treat the subject. Warned by a teacher's experience\nthat learning is accounted a weariness to the flesh, the author has\nsought to alleviate the instructive quality of the book by casting it\nin the form of a romantic narrative, which he would be glad to fancy\nnot wholly devoid of interest on its own account.\n\nThe reader, to whom modern social institutions and their underlying\nprinciples are matters of course, may at times find Dr. Leete's\nexplanations of them rather trite--but it must be remembered that to\nDr. Leete's guest they were not matters of course, and that this book\nis written for the express purpose of inducing the reader to forget for\nthe nonce that they are so to him. One word more. The almost universal\ntheme of the writers and orators who have celebrated this bimillennial\nepoch has been the future rather than the past, not the advance that\nhas been made, but the progress that shall be made, ever onward and\nupward, till the race shall achieve its ineffable destiny. This is\nwell, wholly well, but it seems to me that nowhere can we find more\nsolid ground for daring anticipations of human development during the\nnext one thousand years, than by \"Looking Backward\" upon the progress\nof the last one hundred.\n\nThat this volume may be so fortunate as to find readers whose interest\nin the subject shall incline them to overlook the deficiencies of the\ntreatment is the hope in which the author steps aside and leaves Mr.\nJulian West to speak for himself.\n\nJTABLE 5 28 1\n\nChapter 1\n\nI first saw the light in the city of Boston in the year 1857. \"What!\"\nyou say, \"eighteen fifty-seven? That is an odd slip. He means nineteen\nfifty-seven, of course.\" I beg pardon, but there is no mistake. It was\nabout four in the afternoon of December the 26th, one day after\nChristmas, in the year 1857, not 1957, that I first breathed the east\nwind of Boston, which, I assure the reader, was at that remote period\nmarked by the same penetrating quality characterizing it in the present\nyear of grace, 2000.\n\nThese statements seem so absurd on their face, especially when I add\nthat I am a young man apparently of about thirty years of age, that no\nperson can be blamed for refusing to read another word of what promises\nto be a mere imposition upon his credulity. Nevertheless I earnestly\nassure the reader that no imposition is intended, and will undertake,\nif he shall follow me a few pages, to entirely convince him of this. If\nI may, then, provisionally assume, with the pledge of justifying the\nassumption, that I know better than the reader when I was born, I will\ngo on with my narrative. As every schoolboy knows, in the latter part\nof the nineteenth century the civilization of to-day, or anything like\nit, did not exist, although the elements which were to develop it were\nalready in ferment. Nothing had, however, occurred to modify the\nimmemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as\nthey may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were\nfar greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and\nthe poor, the educated and the ignorant. I myself was rich and also\neducated, and possessed, therefore, all the elements of happiness\nenjoyed by the most fortunate in that age. Living in luxury, and\noccupied only with the pursuit of the pleasures and refinements of\nlife, I derived the means of my support from the labor of others,\nrendering no sort of service in return. My parents and grand-parents\nhad lived in the same way, and I expected that my descendants, if I had\nany, would enjoy a like easy existence.\n\nBut how could I live without service to the world? you ask. Why should\nthe world have supported in utter idleness one who was able to render\nservice? The answer is that my great-grandfather had accumulated a sum\nof money on which his descendants had ever since lived. The sum, you\nwill naturally infer, must have been very large not to have been\nexhausted in supporting three generations in idleness. This, however,\nwas not the fact. The sum had been originally by no means large. It\nwas, in fact, much larger now that three generations had been supported\nupon it in idleness, than it was at first. This mystery of use without\nconsumption, of warmth without combustion, seems like magic, but was\nmerely an ingenious application of the art now happily lost but carried\nto great perfection by your ancestors, of shifting the burden of one's\nsupport on the shoulders of others. The man who had accomplished this,\nand it was the end all sought, was said to live on the income of his\ninvestments. To explain at this point how the ancient methods of\nindustry made this possible would delay us too much. I shall only stop\nnow to say that interest on investments was a species of tax in\nperpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry which a person\npossessing or inheriting money was able to levy. It must not be\nsupposed that an arrangement which seems so unnatural and preposterous\naccording to modern notions was never criticized by your ancestors. It\nhad been the effort of lawgivers and prophets from the earliest ages to\nabolish interest, or at least to limit it to the smallest possible\nrate. All these efforts had, however, failed, as they necessarily must\nso long as the ancient social organizations prevailed. At the time of\nwhich I write, the latter part of the nineteenth century, governments\nhad generally given up trying to regulate the subject at all.\n\nBy way of attempting to give the reader some general impression of the\nway people lived together in those days, and especially of the\nrelations of the rich and poor to one another, perhaps I cannot do\nbetter than to compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach\nwhich the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely\nalong a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted\nno lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow. Despite the\ndifficulty of drawing the coach at all along so hard a road, the top\nwas covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest\nascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up\nout of the dust, their occupants could enjoy the scenery at their\nleisure, or critically discuss the merits of the straining team.\nNaturally such places were in great demand and the competition for them\nwas keen, every one seeking as the first end in life to secure a seat\non the coach for himself and to leave it to his child after him. By the\nrule of the coach a man could leave his seat to whom he wished, but on\nthe other hand there were many accidents by which it might at any time\nbe wholly lost. For all that they were so easy, the seats were very\ninsecure, and at every sudden jolt of the coach persons were slipping\nout of them and falling to the ground, where they were instantly\ncompelled to take hold of the rope and help to drag the coach on which\nthey had before ridden so pleasantly. It was naturally regarded as a\nterrible misfortune to lose one's seat, and the apprehension that this\nmight happen to them or their friends was a constant cloud upon the\nhappiness of those who rode.\n\nBut did they think only of themselves? you ask. Was not their very\nluxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with the lot of their\nbrothers and sisters in the harness, and the knowledge that their own\nweight added to their toil? Had they no compassion for fellow beings\nfrom whom fortune only distinguished them? Oh, yes; commiseration was\nfrequently expressed by those who rode for those who had to pull the\ncoach, especially when the vehicle came to a bad place in the road, as\nit was constantly doing, or to a particularly steep hill. At such\ntimes, the desperate straining of the team, their agonized leaping and\nplunging under the pitiless lashing of hunger, the many who fainted at\nthe rope and were trampled in the mire, made a very distressing\nspectacle, which often called forth highly creditable displays of\nfeeling on the top of the coach. At such times the passengers would\ncall down encouragingly to the toilers of the rope, exhorting them to\npatience, and holding out hopes of possible compensation in another\nworld for the hardness of their lot, while others contributed to buy\nsalves and liniments for the crippled and injured. It was agreed that\nit was a great pity that the coach should be so hard to pull, and there\nwas a sense of general relief when the specially bad piece of road was\ngotten over. This relief was not, indeed, wholly on account of the\nteam, for there was always some danger at these bad places of a general\noverturn in which all would lose their seats.\n\nIt must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the spectacle of\nthe misery of the toilers at the rope was to enhance the passengers'\nsense of the value of their seats upon the coach, and to cause them to\nhold on to them more desperately than before. If the passengers could\nonly have felt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever\nfall from the top, it is probable that, beyond contributing to the\nfunds for liniments and bandages, they would have troubled themselves\nextremely little about those who dragged the coach.\n\nI am well aware that this will appear to the men and women of the\ntwentieth century an incredible inhumanity, but there are two facts,\nboth very curious, which partly explain it. In the first place, it was\nfirmly and sincerely believed that there was no other way in which\nSociety could get along, except the many pulled at the rope and the few\nrode, and not only this, but that no very radical improvement even was\npossible, either in the harness, the coach, the roadway, or the\ndistribution of the toil. It had always been as it was, and it always\nwould be so. It was a pity, but it could not be helped, and philosophy\nforbade wasting compassion on what was beyond remedy.\n\nThe other fact is yet more curious, consisting in a singular\nhallucination which those on the top of the coach generally shared,\nthat they were not exactly like their brothers and sisters who pulled\nat the rope, but of finer clay, in some way belonging to a higher order\nof beings who might justly expect to be drawn. This seems\nunaccountable, but, as I once rode on this very coach and shared that\nvery hallucination, I ought to be believed. The strangest thing about\nthe hallucination was that those who had but just climbed up from the\nground, before they had outgrown the marks of the rope upon their\nhands, began to fall under its influence. As for those whose parents\nand grand-parents before them had been so fortunate as to keep their\nseats on the top, the conviction they cherished of the essential\ndifference between their sort of humanity and the common article was\nabsolute. The effect of such a delusion in moderating fellow feeling\nfor the sufferings of the mass of men into a distant and philosophical\ncompassion is obvious. To it I refer as the only extenuation I can\noffer for the indifference which, at the period I write of, marked my\nown attitude toward the misery of my brothers.\n\nIn 1887 I came to my thirtieth year. Although still unmarried, I was\nengaged to wed Edith Bartlett. She, like myself, rode on the top of the\ncoach. That is to say, not to encumber ourselves further with an\nillustration which has, I hope, served its purpose of giving the reader\nsome general impression of how we lived then, her family was wealthy.\nIn that age, when money alone commanded all that was agreeable and\nrefined in life, it was enough for a woman to be rich to have suitors;\nbut Edith Bartlett was beautiful and graceful also.\n\nMy lady readers, I am aware, will protest at this. \"Handsome she might\nhave been,\" I hear them saying, \"but graceful never, in the costumes\nwhich were the fashion at that period, when the head covering was a\ndizzy structure a foot tall, and the almost incredible extension of the\nskirt behind by means of artificial contrivances more thoroughly\ndehumanized the form than any former device of dressmakers. Fancy any\none graceful in such a costume!\" The point is certainly well taken, and\nI can only reply that while the ladies of the twentieth century are\nlovely demonstrations of the effect of appropriate drapery in accenting\nfeminine graces, my recollection of their great-grandmothers enables me\nto maintain that no deformity of costume can wholly disguise them.\n\nOur marriage only waited on the completion of the house which I was\nbuilding for our occupancy in one of the most desirable parts of the\ncity, that is to say, a part chiefly inhabited by the rich. For it must\nbe understood that the comparative desirability of different parts of\nBoston for residence depended then, not on natural features, but on the\ncharacter of the neighboring population. Each class or nation lived by\nitself, in quarters of its own. A rich man living among the poor, an\neducated man among the uneducated, was like one living in isolation\namong a jealous and alien race. When the house had been begun, its\ncompletion by the winter of 1886 had been expected. The spring of the\nfollowing year found it, however, yet incomplete, and my marriage still\na thing of the future. The cause of a delay calculated to be\nparticularly exasperating to an ardent lover was a series of strikes,\nthat is to say, concerted refusals to work on the part of the\nbrick-layers, masons, carpenters, painters, plumbers, and other trades\nconcerned in house building. What the specific causes of these strikes\nwere I do not remember. Strikes had become so common at that period\nthat people had ceased to inquire into their particular grounds. In one\ndepartment of industry or another, they had been nearly incessant ever\nsince the great business crisis of 1873. In fact it had come to be the\nexceptional thing to see any class of laborers pursue their avocation\nsteadily for more than a few months at a time.\n\nThe reader who observes the dates alluded to will of course recognize\nin these disturbances of industry the first and incoherent phase of the\ngreat movement which ended in the establishment of the modern\nindustrial system with all its social consequences. This is all so\nplain in the retrospect that a child can understand it, but not being\nprophets, we of that day had no clear idea what was happening to us.\nWhat we did see was that industrially the country was in a very queer\nway. The relation between the workingman and the employer, between\nlabor and capital, appeared in some unaccountable manner to have become\ndislocated. The working classes had quite suddenly and very generally\nbecome infected with a profound discontent with their condition, and an\nidea that it could be greatly bettered if they only knew how to go\nabout it. On every side, with one accord, they preferred demands for\nhigher pay, shorter hours, better dwellings, better educational\nadvantages, and a share in the refinements and luxuries of life,\ndemands which it was impossible to see the way to granting unless the\nworld were to become a great deal richer than it then was. Though they\nknew something of what they wanted, they knew nothing of how to\naccomplish it, and the eager enthusiasm with which they thronged about\nany one who seemed likely to give them any light on the subject lent\nsudden reputation to many would-be leaders, some of whom had little\nenough light to give. However chimerical the aspirations of the\nlaboring classes might be deemed, the devotion with which they\nsupported one another in the strikes, which were their chief weapon,\nand the sacrifices which they underwent to carry them out left no doubt\nof their dead earnestness.\n\nAs to the final outcome of the labor troubles, which was the phrase by\nwhich the movement I have described was most commonly referred to, the\nopinions of the people of my class differed according to individual\ntemperament. The sanguine argued very forcibly that it was in the very\nnature of things impossible that the new hopes of the workingmen could\nbe satisfied, simply because the world had not the wherewithal to\nsatisfy them. It was only because the masses worked very hard and lived\non short commons that the race did not starve outright, and no\nconsiderable improvement in their condition was possible while the\nworld, as a whole, remained so poor. It was not the capitalists whom\nthe laboring men were contending with, these maintained, but the\niron-bound environment of humanity, and it was merely a question of the\nthickness of their skulls when they would discover the fact and make up\ntheir minds to endure what they could not cure.\n\nThe less sanguine admitted all this. Of course the workingmen's\naspirations were impossible of fulfillment for natural reasons, but\nthere were grounds to fear that they would not discover this fact until\nthey had made a sad mess of society. They had the votes and the power\nto do so if they pleased, and their leaders meant they should. Some of\nthese desponding observers went so far as to predict an impending\nsocial cataclysm. Humanity, they argued, having climbed to the top\nround of the ladder of civilization, was about to take a header into\nchaos, after which it would doubtless pick itself up, turn round, and\nbegin to climb again. Repeated experiences of this sort in historic and\nprehistoric times possibly accounted for the puzzling bumps on the\nhuman cranium. Human history, like all great movements, was cyclical,\nand returned to the point of beginning. The idea of indefinite progress\nin a right line was a chimera of the imagination, with no analogue in\nnature. The parabola of a comet was perhaps a yet better illustration\nof the career of humanity. Tending upward and sunward from the aphelion\nof barbarism, the race attained the perihelion of civilization only to\nplunge downward once more to its nether goal in the regions of chaos.\n\nThis, of course, was an extreme opinion, but I remember serious men\namong my acquaintances who, in discussing the signs of the times,\nadopted a very similar tone. It was no doubt the common opinion of\nthoughtful men that society was approaching a critical period which\nmight result in great changes. The labor troubles, their causes,\ncourse, and cure, took lead of all other topics in the public prints,\nand in serious conversation.\n\nThe nervous tension of the public mind could not have been more\nstrikingly illustrated than it was by the alarm resulting from the talk\nof a small band of men who called themselves anarchists, and proposed\nto terrify the American people into adopting their ideas by threats of\nviolence, as if a mighty nation which had but just put down a rebellion\nof half its own numbers, in order to maintain its political system,\nwere likely to adopt a new social system out of fear.\n\nAs one of the wealthy, with a large stake in the existing order of\nthings, I naturally shared the apprehensions of my class. The\nparticular grievance I had against the working classes at the time of\nwhich I write, on account of the effect of their strikes in postponing\nmy wedded bliss, no doubt lent a special animosity to my feeling toward\nthem.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe thirtieth day of May, 1887, fell on a Monday. It was one of the\nannual holidays of the nation in the latter third of the nineteenth\ncentury, being set apart under the name of Decoration Day, for doing\nhonor to the memory of the soldiers of the North who took part in the\nwar for the preservation of the union of the States. The survivors of\nthe war, escorted by military and civic processions and bands of music,\nwere wont on this occasion to visit the cemeteries and lay wreaths of\nflowers upon the graves of their dead comrades, the ceremony being a\nvery solemn and touching one. The eldest brother of Edith Bartlett had\nfallen in the war, and on Decoration Day the family was in the habit of\nmaking a visit to Mount Auburn, where he lay.\n\nI had asked permission to make one of the party, and, on our return to\nthe city at nightfall, remained to dine with the family of my\nbetrothed. In the drawing-room, after dinner, I picked up an evening\npaper and read of a fresh strike in the building trades, which would\nprobably still further delay the completion of my unlucky house. I\nremember distinctly how exasperated I was at this, and the\nobjurgations, as forcible as the presence of the ladies permitted,\nwhich I lavished upon workmen in general, and these strikers in\nparticular. I had abundant sympathy from those about me, and the\nremarks made in the desultory conversation which followed, upon the\nunprincipled conduct of the labor agitators, were calculated to make\nthose gentlemen's ears tingle. It was agreed that affairs were going\nfrom bad to worse very fast, and that there was no telling what we\nshould come to soon. \"The worst of it,\" I remember Mrs. Bartlett's\nsaying, \"is that the working classes all over the world seem to be\ngoing crazy at once. In Europe it is far worse even than here. I'm sure\nI should not dare to live there at all. I asked Mr. Bartlett the other\nday where we should emigrate to if all the terrible things took place\nwhich those socialists threaten. He said he did not know any place now\nwhere society could be called stable except Greenland, Patagonia, and\nthe Chinese Empire.\" \"Those Chinamen knew what they were about,\"\nsomebody added, \"when they refused to let in our western civilization.\nThey knew what it would lead to better than we did. They saw it was\nnothing but dynamite in disguise.\"\n\nAfter this, I remember drawing Edith apart and trying to persuade her\nthat it would be better to be married at once without waiting for the\ncompletion of the house, spending the time in travel till our home was\nready for us. She was remarkably handsome that evening, the mourning\ncostume that she wore in recognition of the day setting off to great\nadvantage the purity of her complexion. I can see her even now with my\nmind's eye just as she looked that night. When I took my leave she\nfollowed me into the hall and I kissed her good-by as usual. There was\nno circumstance out of the common to distinguish this parting from\nprevious occasions when we had bade each other good-by for a night or a\nday. There was absolutely no premonition in my mind, or I am sure in\nhers, that this was more than an ordinary separation.\n\nAh, well!\n\nThe hour at which I had left my betrothed was a rather early one for a\nlover, but the fact was no reflection on my devotion. I was a confirmed\nsufferer from insomnia, and although otherwise perfectly well had been\ncompletely fagged out that day, from having slept scarcely at all the\ntwo previous nights. Edith knew this and had insisted on sending me\nhome by nine o'clock, with strict orders to go to bed at once.\n\nThe house in which I lived had been occupied by three generations of\nthe family of which I was the only living representative in the direct\nline. It was a large, ancient wooden mansion, very elegant in an\nold-fashioned way within, but situated in a quarter that had long since\nbecome undesirable for residence, from its invasion by tenement houses\nand manufactories. It was not a house to which I could think of\nbringing a bride, much less so dainty a one as Edith Bartlett. I had\nadvertised it for sale, and meanwhile merely used it for sleeping\npurposes, dining at my club. One servant, a faithful colored man by the\nname of Sawyer, lived with me and attended to my few wants. One feature\nof the house I expected to miss greatly when I should leave it, and\nthis was the sleeping chamber which I had built under the foundations.\nI could not have slept in the city at all, with its never ceasing\nnightly noises, if I had been obliged to use an upstairs chamber. But\nto this subterranean room no murmur from the upper world ever\npenetrated. When I had entered it and closed the door, I was surrounded\nby the silence of the tomb. In order to prevent the dampness of the\nsubsoil from penetrating the chamber, the walls had been laid in\nhydraulic cement and were very thick, and the floor was likewise\nprotected. In order that the room might serve also as a vault equally\nproof against violence and flames, for the storage of valuables, I had\nroofed it with stone slabs hermetically sealed, and the outer door was\nof iron with a thick coating of asbestos. A small pipe, communicating\nwith a wind-mill on the top of the house, insured the renewal of air.\n\nIt might seem that the tenant of such a chamber ought to be able to\ncommand slumber, but it was rare that I slept well, even there, two\nnights in succession. So accustomed was I to wakefulness that I minded\nlittle the loss of one night's rest. A second night, however, spent in\nmy reading chair instead of my bed, tired me out, and I never allowed\nmyself to go longer than that without slumber, from fear of nervous\ndisorder. From this statement it will be inferred that I had at my\ncommand some artificial means for inducing sleep in the last resort,\nand so in fact I had. If after two sleepless nights I found myself on\nthe approach of the third without sensations of drowsiness, I called in\nDr. Pillsbury.\n\nHe was a doctor by courtesy only, what was called in those days an\n\"irregular\" or \"quack\" doctor. He called himself a \"Professor of Animal\nMagnetism.\" I had come across him in the course of some amateur\ninvestigations into the phenomena of animal magnetism. I don't think he\nknew anything about medicine, but he was certainly a remarkable\nmesmerist. It was for the purpose of being put to sleep by his\nmanipulations that I used to send for him when I found a third night of\nsleeplessness impending. Let my nervous excitement or mental\npreoccupation be however great, Dr. Pillsbury never failed, after a\nshort time, to leave me in a deep slumber, which continued till I was\naroused by a reversal of the mesmerizing process. The process for\nawaking the sleeper was much simpler than that for putting him to\nsleep, and for convenience I had made Dr Pillsbury teach Sawyer how to\ndo it.\n\nMy faithful servant alone knew for what purpose Dr. Pillsbury visited\nme, or that he did so at all. Of course, when Edith became my wife I\nshould have to tell her my secrets. I had not hitherto told her this,\nbecause there was unquestionably a slight risk in the mesmeric sleep,\nand I knew she would set her face against my practice. The risk, of\ncourse, was that it might become too profound and pass into a trance\nbeyond the mesmerizer's power to break, ending in death. Repeated\nexperiments had fully convinced me that the risk was next to nothing if\nreasonable precautions were exercised, and of this I hoped, though\ndoubtingly, to convince Edith. I went directly home after leaving her,\nand at once sent Sawyer to fetch Dr. Pillsbury. Meanwhile I sought my\nsubterranean sleeping chamber, and exchanging my costume for a\ncomfortable dressing-gown, sat down to read the letters by the evening\nmail which Sawyer had laid on my reading table.\n\nOne of them was from the builder of my new house, and confirmed what I\nhad inferred from the newspaper item. The new strikes, he said, had\npostponed indefinitely the completion of the contract, as neither\nmasters nor workmen would concede the point at issue without a long\nstruggle. Caligula wished that the Roman people had but one neck that\nhe might cut it off, and as I read this letter I am afraid that for a\nmoment I was capable of wishing the same thing concerning the laboring\nclasses of America. The return of Sawyer with the doctor interrupted my\ngloomy meditations.\n\nIt appeared that he had with difficulty been able to secure his\nservices, as he was preparing to leave the city that very night. The\ndoctor explained that since he had seen me last he had learned of a\nfine professional opening in a distant city, and decided to take prompt\nadvantage of it. On my asking, in some panic, what I was to do for some\none to put me to sleep, he gave me the names of several mesmerizers in\nBoston who, he averred, had quite as great powers as he.\n\nSomewhat relieved on this point, I instructed Sawyer to rouse me at\nnine o'clock next morning, and, lying down on the bed in my\ndressing-gown, assumed a comfortable attitude, and surrendered myself\nto the manipulations of the mesmerizer. Owing, perhaps, to my unusually\nnervous state, I was slower than common in losing consciousness, but at\nlength a delicious drowsiness stole over me.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\"He is going to open his eyes. He had better see but one of us at\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Promise me, then, that you will not tell him.\"\n\nThe first voice was a man's, the second a woman's, and both spoke in\nwhispers.\n\n\"I will see how he seems,\" replied the man.\n\n\"No, no, promise me,\" persisted the other.\n\n\"Let her have her way,\" whispered a third voice, also a woman.\n\n\"Well, well, I promise, then,\" answered the man. \"Quick, go! He is\ncoming out of it.\"\n\nThere was a rustle of garments and I opened my eyes. A fine looking man\nof perhaps sixty was bending over me, an expression of much benevolence\nmingled with great curiosity upon his features. He was an utter\nstranger. I raised myself on an elbow and looked around. The room was\nempty. I certainly had never been in it before, or one furnished like\nit. I looked back at my companion. He smiled.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Where am I?\" I demanded.\n\n\"You are in my house,\" was the reply.\n\n\"How came I here?\"\n\n\"We will talk about that when you are stronger. Meanwhile, I beg you\nwill feel no anxiety. You are among friends and in good hands. How do\nyou feel?\"\n\n\"A bit queerly,\" I replied, \"but I am well, I suppose. Will you tell me\nhow I came to be indebted to your hospitality? What has happened to me?\nHow came I here? It was in my own house that I went to sleep.\"\n\n\"There will be time enough for explanations later,\" my unknown host\nreplied, with a reassuring smile. \"It will be better to avoid agitating\ntalk until you are a little more yourself. Will you oblige me by taking\na couple of swallows of this mixture? It will do you good. I am a\nphysician.\"\n\nI repelled the glass with my hand and sat up on the couch, although\nwith an effort, for my head was strangely light.\n\n\"I insist upon knowing at once where I am and what you have been doing\nwith me,\" I said.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" responded my companion, \"let me beg that you will not\nagitate yourself. I would rather you did not insist upon explanations\nso soon, but if you do, I will try to satisfy you, provided you will\nfirst take this draught, which will strengthen you somewhat.\"\n\nI thereupon drank what he offered me. Then he said, \"It is not so\nsimple a matter as you evidently suppose to tell you how you came here.\nYou can tell me quite as much on that point as I can tell you. You have\njust been roused from a deep sleep, or, more properly, trance. So much\nI can tell you. You say you were in your own house when you fell into\nthat sleep. May I ask you when that was?\"\n\n\"When?\" I replied, \"when? Why, last evening, of course, at about ten\no'clock. I left my man Sawyer orders to call me at nine o'clock. What\nhas become of Sawyer?\"\n\n\"I can't precisely tell you that,\" replied my companion, regarding me\nwith a curious expression, \"but I am sure that he is excusable for not\nbeing here. And now can you tell me a little more explicitly when it\nwas that you fell into that sleep, the date, I mean?\"\n\n\"Why, last night, of course; I said so, didn't I? that is, unless I\nhave overslept an entire day. Great heavens! that cannot be possible;\nand yet I have an odd sensation of having slept a long time. It was\nDecoration Day that I went to sleep.\"\n\n\"Decoration Day?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monday, the 30th.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, the 30th of what?\"\n\n\"Why, of this month, of course, unless I have slept into June, but that\ncan't be.\"\n\n\"This month is September.\"\n\n\"September! You don't mean that I've slept since May! God in heaven!\nWhy, it is incredible.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied my companion; \"you say that it was May 30th\nwhen you went to sleep?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"May I ask of what year?\"\n\nI stared blankly at him, incapable of speech, for some moments.\n\n\"Of what year?\" I feebly echoed at last.\n\n\"Yes, of what year, if you please? After you have told me that I shall\nbe able to tell you how long you have slept.\"\n\n\"It was the year 1887,\" I said.\n\nMy companion insisted that I should take another draught from the\nglass, and felt my pulse.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he said, \"your manner indicates that you are a man of\nculture, which I am aware was by no means the matter of course in your\nday it now is. No doubt, then, you have yourself made the observation\nthat nothing in this world can be truly said to be more wonderful than\nanything else. The causes of all phenomena are equally adequate, and\nthe results equally matters of course. That you should be startled by\nwhat I shall tell you is to be expected; but I am confident that you\nwill not permit it to affect your equanimity unduly. Your appearance is\nthat of a young man of barely thirty, and your bodily condition seems\nnot greatly different from that of one just roused from a somewhat too\nlong and profound sleep, and yet this is the tenth day of September in\nthe year 2000, and you have slept exactly one hundred and thirteen\nyears, three months, and eleven days.\"\n\nFeeling partially dazed, I drank a cup of some sort of broth at my\ncompanion's suggestion, and, immediately afterward becoming very\ndrowsy, went off into a deep sleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was broad daylight in the room, which had been lighted\nartificially when I was awake before. My mysterious host was sitting\nnear. He was not looking at me when I opened my eyes, and I had a good\nopportunity to study him and meditate upon my extraordinary situation,\nbefore he observed that I was awake. My giddiness was all gone, and my\nmind perfectly clear. The story that I had been asleep one hundred and\nthirteen years, which, in my former weak and bewildered condition, I\nhad accepted without question, recurred to me now only to be rejected\nas a preposterous attempt at an imposture, the motive of which it was\nimpossible remotely to surmise.\n\nSomething extraordinary had certainly happened to account for my waking\nup in this strange house with this unknown companion, but my fancy was\nutterly impotent to suggest more than the wildest guess as to what that\nsomething might have been. Could it be that I was the victim of some\nsort of conspiracy? It looked so, certainly; and yet, if human\nlineaments ever gave true evidence, it was certain that this man by my\nside, with a face so refined and ingenuous, was no party to any scheme\nof crime or outrage. Then it occurred to me to question if I might not\nbe the butt of some elaborate practical joke on the part of friends who\nhad somehow learned the secret of my underground chamber and taken this\nmeans of impressing me with the peril of mesmeric experiments. There\nwere great difficulties in the way of this theory; Sawyer would never\nhave betrayed me, nor had I any friends at all likely to undertake such\nan enterprise; nevertheless the supposition that I was the victim of a\npractical joke seemed on the whole the only one tenable. Half expecting\nto catch a glimpse of some familiar face grinning from behind a chair\nor curtain, I looked carefully about the room. When my eyes next rested\non my companion, he was looking at me.\n\n\"You have had a fine nap of twelve hours,\" he said briskly, \"and I can\nsee that it has done you good. You look much better. Your color is good\nand your eyes are bright. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"I never felt better,\" I said, sitting up.\n\n\"You remember your first waking, no doubt,\" he pursued, \"and your\nsurprise when I told you how long you had been asleep?\"\n\n\"You said, I believe, that I had slept one hundred and thirteen years.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"You will admit,\" I said, with an ironical smile, \"that the story was\nrather an improbable one.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary, I admit,\" he responded, \"but given the proper\nconditions, not improbable nor inconsistent with what we know of the\ntrance state. When complete, as in your case, the vital functions are\nabsolutely suspended, and there is no waste of the tissues. No limit\ncan be set to the possible duration of a trance when the external\nconditions protect the body from physical injury. This trance of yours\nis indeed the longest of which there is any positive record, but there\nis no known reason wherefore, had you not been discovered and had the\nchamber in which we found you continued intact, you might not have\nremained in a state of suspended animation till, at the end of\nindefinite ages, the gradual refrigeration of the earth had destroyed\nthe bodily tissues and set the spirit free.\"\n\nI had to admit that, if I were indeed the victim of a practical joke,\nits authors had chosen an admirable agent for carrying out their\nimposition. The impressive and even eloquent manner of this man would\nhave lent dignity to an argument that the moon was made of cheese. The\nsmile with which I had regarded him as he advanced his trance\nhypothesis did not appear to confuse him in the slightest degree.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"you will go on and favor me with some particulars\nas to the circumstances under which you discovered this chamber of\nwhich you speak, and its contents. I enjoy good fiction.\"\n\n\"In this case,\" was the grave reply, \"no fiction could be so strange as\nthe truth. You must know that these many years I have been cherishing\nthe idea of building a laboratory in the large garden beside this\nhouse, for the purpose of chemical experiments for which I have a\ntaste. Last Thursday the excavation for the cellar was at last begun.\nIt was completed by that night, and Friday the masons were to have\ncome. Thursday night we had a tremendous deluge of rain, and Friday\nmorning I found my cellar a frog-pond and the walls quite washed down.\nMy daughter, who had come out to view the disaster with me, called my\nattention to a corner of masonry laid bare by the crumbling away of one\nof the walls. I cleared a little earth from it, and, finding that it\nseemed part of a large mass, determined to investigate it. The workmen\nI sent for unearthed an oblong vault some eight feet below the surface,\nand set in the corner of what had evidently been the foundation walls\nof an ancient house. A layer of ashes and charcoal on the top of the\nvault showed that the house above had perished by fire. The vault\nitself was perfectly intact, the cement being as good as when first\napplied. It had a door, but this we could not force, and found entrance\nby removing one of the flagstones which formed the roof. The air which\ncame up was stagnant but pure, dry and not cold. Descending with a\nlantern, I found myself in an apartment fitted up as a bedroom in the\nstyle of the nineteenth century. On the bed lay a young man. That he\nwas dead and must have been dead a century was of course to be taken\nfor granted; but the extraordinary state of preservation of the body\nstruck me and the medical colleagues whom I had summoned with\namazement. That the art of such embalming as this had ever been known\nwe should not have believed, yet here seemed conclusive testimony that\nour immediate ancestors had possessed it. My medical colleagues, whose\ncuriosity was highly excited, were at once for undertaking experiments\nto test the nature of the process employed, but I withheld them. My\nmotive in so doing, at least the only motive I now need speak of, was\nthe recollection of something I once had read about the extent to which\nyour contemporaries had cultivated the subject of animal magnetism. It\nhad occurred to me as just conceivable that you might be in a trance,\nand that the secret of your bodily integrity after so long a time was\nnot the craft of an embalmer, but life. So extremely fanciful did this\nidea seem, even to me, that I did not risk the ridicule of my fellow\nphysicians by mentioning it, but gave some other reason for postponing\ntheir experiments. No sooner, however, had they left me, than I set on\nfoot a systematic attempt at resuscitation, of which you know the\nresult.\"\n\nHad its theme been yet more incredible, the circumstantiality of this\nnarrative, as well as the impressive manner and personality of the\nnarrator, might have staggered a listener, and I had begun to feel very\nstrangely, when, as he closed, I chanced to catch a glimpse of my\nreflection in a mirror hanging on the wall of the room. I rose and went\nup to it. The face I saw was the face to a hair and a line and not a\nday older than the one I had looked at as I tied my cravat before going\nto Edith that Decoration Day, which, as this man would have me believe,\nwas celebrated one hundred and thirteen years before. At this, the\ncolossal character of the fraud which was being attempted on me, came\nover me afresh. Indignation mastered my mind as I realized the\noutrageous liberty that had been taken.\n\n\"You are probably surprised,\" said my companion, \"to see that, although\nyou are a century older than when you lay down to sleep in that\nunderground chamber, your appearance is unchanged. That should not\namaze you. It is by virtue of the total arrest of the vital functions\nthat you have survived this great period of time. If your body could\nhave undergone any change during your trance, it would long ago have\nsuffered dissolution.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I replied, turning to him, \"what your motive can be in reciting\nto me with a serious face this remarkable farrago, I am utterly unable\nto guess; but you are surely yourself too intelligent to suppose that\nanybody but an imbecile could be deceived by it. Spare me any more of\nthis elaborate nonsense and once for all tell me whether you refuse to\ngive me an intelligible account of where I am and how I came here. If\nso, I shall proceed to ascertain my whereabouts for myself, whoever may\nhinder.\"\n\n\"You do not, then, believe that this is the year 2000?\"\n\n\"Do you really think it necessary to ask me that?\" I returned.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied my extraordinary host. \"Since I cannot convince\nyou, you shall convince yourself. Are you strong enough to follow me\nupstairs?\"\n\n\"I am as strong as I ever was,\" I replied angrily, \"as I may have to\nprove if this jest is carried much farther.\"\n\n\"I beg, sir,\" was my companion's response, \"that you will not allow\nyourself to be too fully persuaded that you are the victim of a trick,\nlest the reaction, when you are convinced of the truth of my\nstatements, should be too great.\"\n\nThe tone of concern, mingled with commiseration, with which he said\nthis, and the entire absence of any sign of resentment at my hot words,\nstrangely daunted me, and I followed him from the room with an\nextraordinary mixture of emotions. He led the way up two flights of\nstairs and then up a shorter one, which landed us upon a belvedere on\nthe house-top. \"Be pleased to look around you,\" he said, as we reached\nthe platform, \"and tell me if this is the Boston of the nineteenth\ncentury.\"\n\nAt my feet lay a great city. Miles of broad streets, shaded by trees\nand lined with fine buildings, for the most part not in continuous\nblocks but set in larger or smaller inclosures, stretched in every\ndirection. Every quarter contained large open squares filled with\ntrees, among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late\nafternoon sun. Public buildings of a colossal size and an architectural\ngrandeur unparalleled in my day raised their stately piles on every\nside. Surely I had never seen this city nor one comparable to it\nbefore. Raising my eyes at last towards the horizon, I looked westward.\nThat blue ribbon winding away to the sunset, was it not the sinuous\nCharles? I looked east; Boston harbor stretched before me within its\nheadlands, not one of its green islets missing.\n\nI knew then that I had been told the truth concerning the prodigious\nthing which had befallen me.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nI did not faint, but the effort to realize my position made me very\ngiddy, and I remember that my companion had to give me a strong arm as\nhe conducted me from the roof to a roomy apartment on the upper floor\nof the house, where he insisted on my drinking a glass or two of good\nwine and partaking of a light repast.\n\n\"I think you are going to be all right now,\" he said cheerily. \"I\nshould not have taken so abrupt a means to convince you of your\nposition if your course, while perfectly excusable under the\ncircumstances, had not rather obliged me to do so. I confess,\" he added\nlaughing, \"I was a little apprehensive at one time that I should\nundergo what I believe you used to call a knockdown in the nineteenth\ncentury, if I did not act rather promptly. I remembered that the\nBostonians of your day were famous pugilists, and thought best to lose\nno time. I take it you are now ready to acquit me of the charge of\nhoaxing you.\"\n\n\"If you had told me,\" I replied, profoundly awed, \"that a thousand\nyears instead of a hundred had elapsed since I last looked on this\ncity, I should now believe you.\"\n\n\"Only a century has passed,\" he answered, \"but many a millennium in the\nworld's history has seen changes less extraordinary.\"\n\n\"And now,\" he added, extending his hand with an air of irresistible\ncordiality, \"let me give you a hearty welcome to the Boston of the\ntwentieth century and to this house. My name is Leete, Dr. Leete they\ncall me.\"\n\n\"My name,\" I said as I shook his hand, \"is Julian West.\"\n\n\"I am most happy in making your acquaintance, Mr. West,\" he responded.\n\"Seeing that this house is built on the site of your own, I hope you\nwill find it easy to make yourself at home in it.\"\n\nAfter my refreshment Dr. Leete offered me a bath and a change of\nclothing, of which I gladly availed myself.\n\nIt did not appear that any very startling revolution in men's attire\nhad been among the great changes my host had spoken of, for, barring a\nfew details, my new habiliments did not puzzle me at all.\n\nPhysically, I was now myself again. But mentally, how was it with me,\nthe reader will doubtless wonder. What were my intellectual sensations,\nhe may wish to know, on finding myself so suddenly dropped as it were\ninto a new world. In reply let me ask him to suppose himself suddenly,\nin the twinkling of an eye, transported from earth, say, to Paradise or\nHades. What does he fancy would be his own experience? Would his\nthoughts return at once to the earth he had just left, or would he,\nafter the first shock, wellnigh forget his former life for a while,\nalbeit to be remembered later, in the interest excited by his new\nsurroundings? All I can say is, that if his experience were at all like\nmine in the transition I am describing, the latter hypothesis would\nprove the correct one. The impressions of amazement and curiosity which\nmy new surroundings produced occupied my mind, after the first shock,\nto the exclusion of all other thoughts. For the time the memory of my\nformer life was, as it were, in abeyance.\n\nNo sooner did I find myself physically rehabilitated through the kind\noffices of my host, than I became eager to return to the house-top; and\npresently we were comfortably established there in easy-chairs, with\nthe city beneath and around us. After Dr. Leete had responded to\nnumerous questions on my part, as to the ancient landmarks I missed and\nthe new ones which had replaced them, he asked me what point of the\ncontrast between the new and the old city struck me most forcibly.\n\n\"To speak of small things before great,\" I responded, \"I really think\nthat the complete absence of chimneys and their smoke is the detail\nthat first impressed me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated my companion with an air of much interest, \"I had\nforgotten the chimneys, it is so long since they went out of use. It is\nnearly a century since the crude method of combustion on which you\ndepended for heat became obsolete.\"\n\n\"In general,\" I said, \"what impresses me most about the city is the\nmaterial prosperity on the part of the people which its magnificence\nimplies.\"\n\n\"I would give a great deal for just one glimpse of the Boston of your\nday,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"No doubt, as you imply, the cities of that\nperiod were rather shabby affairs. If you had the taste to make them\nsplendid, which I would not be so rude as to question, the general\npoverty resulting from your extraordinary industrial system would not\nhave given you the means. Moreover, the excessive individualism which\nthen prevailed was inconsistent with much public spirit. What little\nwealth you had seems almost wholly to have been lavished in private\nluxury. Nowadays, on the contrary, there is no destination of the\nsurplus wealth so popular as the adornment of the city, which all enjoy\nin equal degree.\"\n\nThe sun had been setting as we returned to the house-top, and as we\ntalked night descended upon the city.\n\n\"It is growing dark,\" said Dr. Leete. \"Let us descend into the house; I\nwant to introduce my wife and daughter to you.\"\n\nHis words recalled to me the feminine voices which I had heard\nwhispering about me as I was coming back to conscious life; and, most\ncurious to learn what the ladies of the year 2000 were like, I assented\nwith alacrity to the proposition. The apartment in which we found the\nwife and daughter of my host, as well as the entire interior of the\nhouse, was filled with a mellow light, which I knew must be artificial,\nalthough I could not discover the source from which it was diffused.\nMrs. Leete was an exceptionally fine looking and well preserved woman\nof about her husband's age, while the daughter, who was in the first\nblush of womanhood, was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her\nface was as bewitching as deep blue eyes, delicately tinted complexion,\nand perfect features could make it, but even had her countenance lacked\nspecial charms, the faultless luxuriance of her figure would have given\nher place as a beauty among the women of the nineteenth century.\nFeminine softness and delicacy were in this lovely creature deliciously\ncombined with an appearance of health and abounding physical vitality\ntoo often lacking in the maidens with whom alone I could compare her.\nIt was a coincidence trifling in comparison with the general\nstrangeness of the situation, but still striking, that her name should\nbe Edith.\n\nThe evening that followed was certainly unique in the history of social\nintercourse, but to suppose that our conversation was peculiarly\nstrained or difficult would be a great mistake. I believe indeed that\nit is under what may be called unnatural, in the sense of\nextraordinary, circumstances that people behave most naturally, for the\nreason, no doubt, that such circumstances banish artificiality. I know\nat any rate that my intercourse that evening with these representatives\nof another age and world was marked by an ingenuous sincerity and\nfrankness such as but rarely crown long acquaintance. No doubt the\nexquisite tact of my entertainers had much to do with this. Of course\nthere was nothing we could talk of but the strange experience by virtue\nof which I was there, but they talked of it with an interest so naive\nand direct in its expression as to relieve the subject to a great\ndegree of the element of the weird and the uncanny which might so\neasily have been overpowering. One would have supposed that they were\nquite in the habit of entertaining waifs from another century, so\nperfect was their tact.\n\nFor my own part, never do I remember the operations of my mind to have\nbeen more alert and acute than that evening, or my intellectual\nsensibilities more keen. Of course I do not mean that the consciousness\nof my amazing situation was for a moment out of mind, but its chief\neffect thus far was to produce a feverish elation, a sort of mental\nintoxication.[1]\n\nEdith Leete took little part in the conversation, but when several\ntimes the magnetism of her beauty drew my glance to her face, I found\nher eyes fixed on me with an absorbed intensity, almost like\nfascination. It was evident that I had excited her interest to an\nextraordinary degree, as was not astonishing, supposing her to be a\ngirl of imagination. Though I supposed curiosity was the chief motive\nof her interest, it could but affect me as it would not have done had\nshe been less beautiful.\n\nDr. Leete, as well as the ladies, seemed greatly interested in my\naccount of the circumstances under which I had gone to sleep in the\nunderground chamber. All had suggestions to offer to account for my\nhaving been forgotten there, and the theory which we finally agreed on\noffers at least a plausible explanation, although whether it be in its\ndetails the true one, nobody, of course, will ever know. The layer of\nashes found above the chamber indicated that the house had been burned\ndown. Let it be supposed that the conflagration had taken place the\nnight I fell asleep. It only remains to assume that Sawyer lost his\nlife in the fire or by some accident connected with it, and the rest\nfollows naturally enough. No one but he and Dr. Pillsbury either knew\nof the existence of the chamber or that I was in it, and Dr. Pillsbury,\nwho had gone that night to New Orleans, had probably never heard of the\nfire at all. The conclusion of my friends, and of the public, must have\nbeen that I had perished in the flames. An excavation of the ruins,\nunless thorough, would not have disclosed the recess in the foundation\nwalls connecting with my chamber. To be sure, if the site had been\nagain built upon, at least immediately, such an excavation would have\nbeen necessary, but the troublous times and the undesirable character\nof the locality might well have prevented rebuilding. The size of the\ntrees in the garden now occupying the site indicated, Dr. Leete said,\nthat for more than half a century at least it had been open ground.\n\n\n[1] In accounting for this state of mind it must be remembered that,\nexcept for the topic of our conversations, there was in my surroundings\nnext to nothing to suggest what had befallen me. Within a block of my\nhome in the old Boston I could have found social circles vastly more\nforeign to me. The speech of the Bostonians of the twentieth century\ndiffers even less from that of their cultured ancestors of the\nnineteenth than did that of the latter from the language of Washington\nand Franklin, while the differences between the style of dress and\nfurniture of the two epochs are not more marked than I have known\nfashion to make in the time of one generation.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nWhen, in the course of the evening the ladies retired, leaving Dr.\nLeete and myself alone, he sounded me as to my disposition for sleep,\nsaying that if I felt like it my bed was ready for me; but if I was\ninclined to wakefulness nothing would please him better than to bear me\ncompany. \"I am a late bird, myself,\" he said, \"and, without suspicion\nof flattery, I may say that a companion more interesting than yourself\ncould scarcely be imagined. It is decidedly not often that one has a\nchance to converse with a man of the nineteenth century.\"\n\nNow I had been looking forward all the evening with some dread to the\ntime when I should be alone, on retiring for the night. Surrounded by\nthese most friendly strangers, stimulated and supported by their\nsympathetic interest, I had been able to keep my mental balance. Even\nthen, however, in pauses of the conversation I had had glimpses, vivid\nas lightning flashes, of the horror of strangeness that was waiting to\nbe faced when I could no longer command diversion. I knew I could not\nsleep that night, and as for lying awake and thinking, it argues no\ncowardice, I am sure, to confess that I was afraid of it. When, in\nreply to my host's question, I frankly told him this, he replied that\nit would be strange if I did not feel just so, but that I need have no\nanxiety about sleeping; whenever I wanted to go to bed, he would give\nme a dose which would insure me a sound night's sleep without fail.\nNext morning, no doubt, I would awake with the feeling of an old\ncitizen.\n\n\"Before I acquired that,\" I replied, \"I must know a little more about\nthe sort of Boston I have come back to. You told me when we were upon\nthe house-top that though a century only had elapsed since I fell\nasleep, it had been marked by greater changes in the conditions of\nhumanity than many a previous millennium. With the city before me I\ncould well believe that, but I am very curious to know what some of the\nchanges have been. To make a beginning somewhere, for the subject is\ndoubtless a large one, what solution, if any, have you found for the\nlabor question? It was the Sphinx's riddle of the nineteenth century,\nand when I dropped out the Sphinx was threatening to devour society,\nbecause the answer was not forthcoming. It is well worth sleeping a\nhundred years to learn what the right answer was, if, indeed, you have\nfound it yet.\"\n\n\"As no such thing as the labor question is known nowadays,\" replied Dr.\nLeete, \"and there is no way in which it could arise, I suppose we may\nclaim to have solved it. Society would indeed have fully deserved being\ndevoured if it had failed to answer a riddle so entirely simple. In\nfact, to speak by the book, it was not necessary for society to solve\nthe riddle at all. It may be said to have solved itself. The solution\ncame as the result of a process of industrial evolution which could not\nhave terminated otherwise. All that society had to do was to recognize\nand cooperate with that evolution, when its tendency had become\nunmistakable.\"\n\n\"I can only say,\" I answered, \"that at the time I fell asleep no such\nevolution had been recognized.\"\n\n\"It was in 1887 that you fell into this sleep, I think you said.\"\n\n\"Yes, May 30th, 1887.\"\n\nMy companion regarded me musingly for some moments. Then he observed,\n\"And you tell me that even then there was no general recognition of the\nnature of the crisis which society was nearing? Of course, I fully\ncredit your statement. The singular blindness of your contemporaries to\nthe signs of the times is a phenomenon commented on by many of our\nhistorians, but few facts of history are more difficult for us to\nrealize, so obvious and unmistakable as we look back seem the\nindications, which must also have come under your eyes, of the\ntransformation about to come to pass. I should be interested, Mr. West,\nif you would give me a little more definite idea of the view which you\nand men of your grade of intellect took of the state and prospects of\nsociety in 1887. You must, at least, have realized that the widespread\nindustrial and social troubles, and the underlying dissatisfaction of\nall classes with the inequalities of society, and the general misery of\nmankind, were portents of great changes of some sort.\"\n\n\"We did, indeed, fully realize that,\" I replied. \"We felt that society\nwas dragging anchor and in danger of going adrift. Whither it would\ndrift nobody could say, but all feared the rocks.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Dr. Leete, \"the set of the current was perfectly\nperceptible if you had but taken pains to observe it, and it was not\ntoward the rocks, but toward a deeper channel.\"\n\n\"We had a popular proverb,\" I replied, \"that 'hindsight is better than\nforesight,' the force of which I shall now, no doubt, appreciate more\nfully than ever. All I can say is, that the prospect was such when I\nwent into that long sleep that I should not have been surprised had I\nlooked down from your house-top to-day on a heap of charred and\nmoss-grown ruins instead of this glorious city.\"\n\nDr. Leete had listened to me with close attention and nodded\nthoughtfully as I finished speaking. \"What you have said,\" he observed,\n\"will be regarded as a most valuable vindication of Storiot, whose\naccount of your era has been generally thought exaggerated in its\npicture of the gloom and confusion of men's minds. That a period of\ntransition like that should be full of excitement and agitation was\nindeed to be looked for; but seeing how plain was the tendency of the\nforces in operation, it was natural to believe that hope rather than\nfear would have been the prevailing temper of the popular mind.\"\n\n\"You have not yet told me what was the answer to the riddle which you\nfound,\" I said. \"I am impatient to know by what contradiction of\nnatural sequence the peace and prosperity which you now seem to enjoy\ncould have been the outcome of an era like my own.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" replied my host, \"but do you smoke?\" It was not till our\ncigars were lighted and drawing well that he resumed. \"Since you are in\nthe humor to talk rather than to sleep, as I certainly am, perhaps I\ncannot do better than to try to give you enough idea of our modern\nindustrial system to dissipate at least the impression that there is\nany mystery about the process of its evolution. The Bostonians of your\nday had the reputation of being great askers of questions, and I am\ngoing to show my descent by asking you one to begin with. What should\nyou name as the most prominent feature of the labor troubles of your\nday?\"\n\n\"Why, the strikes, of course,\" I replied.\n\n\"Exactly; but what made the strikes so formidable?\"\n\n\"The great labor organizations.\"\n\n\"And what was the motive of these great organizations?\"\n\n\"The workmen claimed they had to organize to get their rights from the\nbig corporations,\" I replied.\n\n\"That is just it,\" said Dr. Leete; \"the organization of labor and the\nstrikes were an effect, merely, of the concentration of capital in\ngreater masses than had ever been known before. Before this\nconcentration began, while as yet commerce and industry were conducted\nby innumerable petty concerns with small capital, instead of a small\nnumber of great concerns with vast capital, the individual workman was\nrelatively important and independent in his relations to the employer.\nMoreover, when a little capital or a new idea was enough to start a man\nin business for himself, workingmen were constantly becoming employers\nand there was no hard and fast line between the two classes. Labor\nunions were needless then, and general strikes out of the question. But\nwhen the era of small concerns with small capital was succeeded by that\nof the great aggregations of capital, all this was changed. The\nindividual laborer, who had been relatively important to the small\nemployer, was reduced to insignificance and powerlessness over against\nthe great corporation, while at the same time the way upward to the\ngrade of employer was closed to him. Self-defense drove him to union\nwith his fellows.\n\n\"The records of the period show that the outcry against the\nconcentration of capital was furious. Men believed that it threatened\nsociety with a form of tyranny more abhorrent than it had ever endured.\nThey believed that the great corporations were preparing for them the\nyoke of a baser servitude than had ever been imposed on the race,\nservitude not to men but to soulless machines incapable of any motive\nbut insatiable greed. Looking back, we cannot wonder at their\ndesperation, for certainly humanity was never confronted with a fate\nmore sordid and hideous than would have been the era of corporate\ntyranny which they anticipated.\n\n\"Meanwhile, without being in the smallest degree checked by the clamor\nagainst it, the absorption of business by ever larger monopolies\ncontinued. In the United States there was not, after the beginning of\nthe last quarter of the century, any opportunity whatever for\nindividual enterprise in any important field of industry, unless backed\nby a great capital. During the last decade of the century, such small\nbusinesses as still remained were fast-failing survivals of a past\nepoch, or mere parasites on the great corporations, or else existed in\nfields too small to attract the great capitalists. Small businesses, as\nfar as they still remained, were reduced to the condition of rats and\nmice, living in holes and corners, and counting on evading notice for\nthe enjoyment of existence. The railroads had gone on combining till a\nfew great syndicates controlled every rail in the land. In\nmanufactories, every important staple was controlled by a syndicate.\nThese syndicates, pools, trusts, or whatever their name, fixed prices\nand crushed all competition except when combinations as vast as\nthemselves arose. Then a struggle, resulting in a still greater\nconsolidation, ensued. The great city bazar crushed it country rivals\nwith branch stores, and in the city itself absorbed its smaller rivals\ntill the business of a whole quarter was concentrated under one roof,\nwith a hundred former proprietors of shops serving as clerks. Having no\nbusiness of his own to put his money in, the small capitalist, at the\nsame time that he took service under the corporation, found no other\ninvestment for his money but its stocks and bonds, thus becoming doubly\ndependent upon it.\n\n\"The fact that the desperate popular opposition to the consolidation of\nbusiness in a few powerful hands had no effect to check it proves that\nthere must have been a strong economical reason for it. The small\ncapitalists, with their innumerable petty concerns, had in fact yielded\nthe field to the great aggregations of capital, because they belonged\nto a day of small things and were totally incompetent to the demands of\nan age of steam and telegraphs and the gigantic scale of its\nenterprises. To restore the former order of things, even if possible,\nwould have involved returning to the day of stagecoaches. Oppressive\nand intolerable as was the regime of the great consolidations of\ncapital, even its victims, while they cursed it, were forced to admit\nthe prodigious increase of efficiency which had been imparted to the\nnational industries, the vast economies effected by concentration of\nmanagement and unity of organization, and to confess that since the new\nsystem had taken the place of the old the wealth of the world had\nincreased at a rate before undreamed of. To be sure this vast increase\nhad gone chiefly to make the rich richer, increasing the gap between\nthem and the poor; but the fact remained that, as a means merely of\nproducing wealth, capital had been proved efficient in proportion to\nits consolidation. The restoration of the old system with the\nsubdivision of capital, if it were possible, might indeed bring back a\ngreater equality of conditions, with more individual dignity and\nfreedom, but it would be at the price of general poverty and the arrest\nof material progress.\n\n\"Was there, then, no way of commanding the services of the mighty\nwealth-producing principle of consolidated capital without bowing down\nto a plutocracy like that of Carthage? As soon as men began to ask\nthemselves these questions, they found the answer ready for them. The\nmovement toward the conduct of business by larger and larger\naggregations of capital, the tendency toward monopolies, which had been\nso desperately and vainly resisted, was recognized at last, in its true\nsignificance, as a process which only needed to complete its logical\nevolution to open a golden future to humanity.\n\n\"Early in the last century the evolution was completed by the final\nconsolidation of the entire capital of the nation. The industry and\ncommerce of the country, ceasing to be conducted by a set of\nirresponsible corporations and syndicates of private persons at their\ncaprice and for their profit, were intrusted to a single syndicate\nrepresenting the people, to be conducted in the common interest for the\ncommon profit. The nation, that is to say, organized as the one great\nbusiness corporation in which all other corporations were absorbed; it\nbecame the one capitalist in the place of all other capitalists, the\nsole employer, the final monopoly in which all previous and lesser\nmonopolies were swallowed up, a monopoly in the profits and economies\nof which all citizens shared. The epoch of trusts had ended in The\nGreat Trust. In a word, the people of the United States concluded to\nassume the conduct of their own business, just as one hundred odd years\nbefore they had assumed the conduct of their own government, organizing\nnow for industrial purposes on precisely the same grounds that they had\nthen organized for political purposes. At last, strangely late in the\nworld's history, the obvious fact was perceived that no business is so\nessentially the public business as the industry and commerce on which\nthe people's livelihood depends, and that to entrust it to private\npersons to be managed for private profit is a folly similar in kind,\nthough vastly greater in magnitude, to that of surrendering the\nfunctions of political government to kings and nobles to be conducted\nfor their personal glorification.\"\n\n\"Such a stupendous change as you describe,\" said I, \"did not, of\ncourse, take place without great bloodshed and terrible convulsions.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"there was absolutely no\nviolence. The change had been long foreseen. Public opinion had become\nfully ripe for it, and the whole mass of the people was behind it.\nThere was no more possibility of opposing it by force than by argument.\nOn the other hand the popular sentiment toward the great corporations\nand those identified with them had ceased to be one of bitterness, as\nthey came to realize their necessity as a link, a transition phase, in\nthe evolution of the true industrial system. The most violent foes of\nthe great private monopolies were now forced to recognize how\ninvaluable and indispensable had been their office in educating the\npeople up to the point of assuming control of their own business. Fifty\nyears before, the consolidation of the industries of the country under\nnational control would have seemed a very daring experiment to the most\nsanguine. But by a series of object lessons, seen and studied by all\nmen, the great corporations had taught the people an entirely new set\nof ideas on this subject. They had seen for many years syndicates\nhandling revenues greater than those of states, and directing the\nlabors of hundreds of thousands of men with an efficiency and economy\nunattainable in smaller operations. It had come to be recognized as an\naxiom that the larger the business the simpler the principles that can\nbe applied to it; that, as the machine is truer than the hand, so the\nsystem, which in a great concern does the work of the master's eye in a\nsmall business, turns out more accurate results. Thus it came about\nthat, thanks to the corporations themselves, when it was proposed that\nthe nation should assume their functions, the suggestion implied\nnothing which seemed impracticable even to the timid. To be sure it was\na step beyond any yet taken, a broader generalization, but the very\nfact that the nation would be the sole corporation in the field would,\nit was seen, relieve the undertaking of many difficulties with which\nthe partial monopolies had contended.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nDr. Leete ceased speaking, and I remained silent, endeavoring to form\nsome general conception of the changes in the arrangements of society\nimplied in the tremendous revolution which he had described.\n\nFinally I said, \"The idea of such an extension of the functions of\ngovernment is, to say the least, rather overwhelming.\"\n\n\"Extension!\" he repeated, \"where is the extension?\"\n\n\"In my day,\" I replied, \"it was considered that the proper functions of\ngovernment, strictly speaking, were limited to keeping the peace and\ndefending the people against the public enemy, that is, to the military\nand police powers.\"\n\n\"And, in heaven's name, who are the public enemies?\" exclaimed Dr.\nLeete. \"Are they France, England, Germany, or hunger, cold, and\nnakedness? In your day governments were accustomed, on the slightest\ninternational misunderstanding, to seize upon the bodies of citizens\nand deliver them over by hundreds of thousands to death and mutilation,\nwasting their treasures the while like water; and all this oftenest for\nno imaginable profit to the victims. We have no wars now, and our\ngovernments no war powers, but in order to protect every citizen\nagainst hunger, cold, and nakedness, and provide for all his physical\nand mental needs, the function is assumed of directing his industry for\na term of years. No, Mr. West, I am sure on reflection you will\nperceive that it was in your age, not in ours, that the extension of\nthe functions of governments was extraordinary. Not even for the best\nends would men now allow their governments such powers as were then\nused for the most maleficent.\"\n\n\"Leaving comparisons aside,\" I said, \"the demagoguery and corruption of\nour public men would have been considered, in my day, insuperable\nobjections to any assumption by government of the charge of the\nnational industries. We should have thought that no arrangement could\nbe worse than to entrust the politicians with control of the\nwealth-producing machinery of the country. Its material interests were\nquite too much the football of parties as it was.\"\n\n\"No doubt you were right,\" rejoined Dr. Leete, \"but all that is changed\nnow. We have no parties or politicians, and as for demagoguery and\ncorruption, they are words having only an historical significance.\"\n\n\"Human nature itself must have changed very much,\" I said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" was Dr. Leete's reply, \"but the conditions of human life\nhave changed, and with them the motives of human action. The\norganization of society with you was such that officials were under a\nconstant temptation to misuse their power for the private profit of\nthemselves or others. Under such circumstances it seems almost strange\nthat you dared entrust them with any of your affairs. Nowadays, on the\ncontrary, society is so constituted that there is absolutely no way in\nwhich an official, however ill-disposed, could possibly make any profit\nfor himself or any one else by a misuse of his power. Let him be as bad\nan official as you please, he cannot be a corrupt one. There is no\nmotive to be. The social system no longer offers a premium on\ndishonesty. But these are matters which you can only understand as you\ncome, with time, to know us better.\"\n\n\"But you have not yet told me how you have settled the labor problem.\nIt is the problem of capital which we have been discussing,\" I said.\n\"After the nation had assumed conduct of the mills, machinery,\nrailroads, farms, mines, and capital in general of the country, the\nlabor question still remained. In assuming the responsibilities of\ncapital the nation had assumed the difficulties of the capitalist's\nposition.\"\n\n\"The moment the nation assumed the responsibilities of capital those\ndifficulties vanished,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The national organization\nof labor under one direction was the complete solution of what was, in\nyour day and under your system, justly regarded as the insoluble labor\nproblem. When the nation became the sole employer, all the citizens, by\nvirtue of their citizenship, became employees, to be distributed\naccording to the needs of industry.\"\n\n\"That is,\" I suggested, \"you have simply applied the principle of\nuniversal military service, as it was understood in our day, to the\nlabor question.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Leete, \"that was something which followed as a matter\nof course as soon as the nation had become the sole capitalist. The\npeople were already accustomed to the idea that the obligation of every\ncitizen, not physically disabled, to contribute his military services\nto the defense of the nation was equal and absolute. That it was\nequally the duty of every citizen to contribute his quota of industrial\nor intellectual services to the maintenance of the nation was equally\nevident, though it was not until the nation became the employer of\nlabor that citizens were able to render this sort of service with any\npretense either of universality or equity. No organization of labor was\npossible when the employing power was divided among hundreds or\nthousands of individuals and corporations, between which concert of any\nkind was neither desired, nor indeed feasible. It constantly happened\nthen that vast numbers who desired to labor could find no opportunity,\nand on the other hand, those who desired to evade a part or all of\ntheir debt could easily do so.\"\n\n\"Service, now, I suppose, is compulsory upon all,\" I suggested.\n\n\"It is rather a matter of course than of compulsion,\" replied Dr.\nLeete. \"It is regarded as so absolutely natural and reasonable that the\nidea of its being compulsory has ceased to be thought of. He would be\nthought to be an incredibly contemptible person who should need\ncompulsion in such a case. Nevertheless, to speak of service being\ncompulsory would be a weak way to state its absolute inevitableness.\nOur entire social order is so wholly based upon and deduced from it\nthat if it were conceivable that a man could escape it, he would be\nleft with no possible way to provide for his existence. He would have\nexcluded himself from the world, cut himself off from his kind, in a\nword, committed suicide.\"\n\n\"Is the term of service in this industrial army for life?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; it both begins later and ends earlier than the average working\nperiod in your day. Your workshops were filled with children and old\nmen, but we hold the period of youth sacred to education, and the\nperiod of maturity, when the physical forces begin to flag, equally\nsacred to ease and agreeable relaxation. The period of industrial\nservice is twenty-four years, beginning at the close of the course of\neducation at twenty-one and terminating at forty-five. After\nforty-five, while discharged from labor, the citizen still remains\nliable to special calls, in case of emergencies causing a sudden great\nincrease in the demand for labor, till he reaches the age of\nfifty-five, but such calls are rarely, in fact almost never, made. The\nfifteenth day of October of every year is what we call Muster Day,\nbecause those who have reached the age of twenty-one are then mustered\ninto the industrial service, and at the same time those who, after\ntwenty-four years' service, have reached the age of forty-five, are\nhonorably mustered out. It is the great day of the year with us, whence\nwe reckon all other events, our Olympiad, save that it is annual.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\"It is after you have mustered your industrial army into service,\" I\nsaid, \"that I should expect the chief difficulty to arise, for there\nits analogy with a military army must cease. Soldiers have all the same\nthing, and a very simple thing, to do, namely, to practice the manual\nof arms, to march and stand guard. But the industrial army must learn\nand follow two or three hundred diverse trades and avocations. What\nadministrative talent can be equal to determining wisely what trade or\nbusiness every individual in a great nation shall pursue?\"\n\n\"The administration has nothing to do with determining that point.\"\n\n\"Who does determine it, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Every man for himself in accordance with his natural aptitude, the\nutmost pains being taken to enable him to find out what his natural\naptitude really is. The principle on which our industrial army is\norganized is that a man's natural endowments, mental and physical,\ndetermine what he can work at most profitably to the nation and most\nsatisfactorily to himself. While the obligation of service in some form\nis not to be evaded, voluntary election, subject only to necessary\nregulation, is depended on to determine the particular sort of service\nevery man is to render. As an individual's satisfaction during his term\nof service depends on his having an occupation to his taste, parents\nand teachers watch from early years for indications of special\naptitudes in children. A thorough study of the National industrial\nsystem, with the history and rudiments of all the great trades, is an\nessential part of our educational system. While manual training is not\nallowed to encroach on the general intellectual culture to which our\nschools are devoted, it is carried far enough to give our youth, in\naddition to their theoretical knowledge of the national industries,\nmechanical and agricultural, a certain familiarity with their tools and\nmethods. Our schools are constantly visiting our workshops, and often\nare taken on long excursions to inspect particular industrial\nenterprises. In your day a man was not ashamed to be grossly ignorant\nof all trades except his own, but such ignorance would not be\nconsistent with our idea of placing every one in a position to select\nintelligently the occupation for which he has most taste. Usually long\nbefore he is mustered into service a young man has found out the\npursuit he wants to follow, has acquired a great deal of knowledge\nabout it, and is waiting impatiently the time when he can enlist in its\nranks.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"it can hardly be that the number of volunteers for\nany trade is exactly the number needed in that trade. It must be\ngenerally either under or over the demand.\"\n\n\"The supply of volunteers is always expected to fully equal the\ndemand,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"It is the business of the administration\nto see that this is the case. The rate of volunteering for each trade\nis closely watched. If there be a noticeably greater excess of\nvolunteers over men needed in any trade, it is inferred that the trade\noffers greater attractions than others. On the other hand, if the\nnumber of volunteers for a trade tends to drop below the demand, it is\ninferred that it is thought more arduous. It is the business of the\nadministration to seek constantly to equalize the attractions of the\ntrades, so far as the conditions of labor in them are concerned, so\nthat all trades shall be equally attractive to persons having natural\ntastes for them. This is done by making the hours of labor in different\ntrades to differ according to their arduousness. The lighter trades,\nprosecuted under the most agreeable circumstances, have in this way the\nlongest hours, while an arduous trade, such as mining, has very short\nhours. There is no theory, no a priori rule, by which the respective\nattractiveness of industries is determined. The administration, in\ntaking burdens off one class of workers and adding them to other\nclasses, simply follows the fluctuations of opinion among the workers\nthemselves as indicated by the rate of volunteering. The principle is\nthat no man's work ought to be, on the whole, harder for him than any\nother man's for him, the workers themselves to be the judges. There are\nno limits to the application of this rule. If any particular occupation\nis in itself so arduous or so oppressive that, in order to induce\nvolunteers, the day's work in it had to be reduced to ten minutes, it\nwould be done. If, even then, no man was willing to do it, it would\nremain undone. But of course, in point of fact, a moderate reduction in\nthe hours of labor, or addition of other privileges, suffices to secure\nall needed volunteers for any occupation necessary to men. If, indeed,\nthe unavoidable difficulties and dangers of such a necessary pursuit\nwere so great that no inducement of compensating advantages would\novercome men's repugnance to it, the administration would only need to\ntake it out of the common order of occupations by declaring it 'extra\nhazardous,' and those who pursued it especially worthy of the national\ngratitude, to be overrun with volunteers. Our young men are very greedy\nof honor, and do not let slip such opportunities. Of course you will\nsee that dependence on the purely voluntary choice of avocations\ninvolves the abolition in all of anything like unhygienic conditions or\nspecial peril to life and limb. Health and safety are conditions common\nto all industries. The nation does not maim and slaughter its workmen\nby thousands, as did the private capitalists and corporations of your\nday.\"\n\n\"When there are more who want to enter a particular trade than there is\nroom for, how do you decide between the applicants?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Preference is given to those who have acquired the most knowledge of\nthe trade they wish to follow. No man, however, who through successive\nyears remains persistent in his desire to show what he can do at any\nparticular trade, is in the end denied an opportunity. Meanwhile, if a\nman cannot at first win entrance into the business he prefers, he has\nusually one or more alternative preferences, pursuits for which he has\nsome degree of aptitude, although not the highest. Every one, indeed,\nis expected to study his aptitudes so as to have not only a first\nchoice as to occupation, but a second or third, so that if, either at\nthe outset of his career or subsequently, owing to the progress of\ninvention or changes in demand, he is unable to follow his first\nvocation, he can still find reasonably congenial employment. This\nprinciple of secondary choices as to occupation is quite important in\nour system. I should add, in reference to the counter-possibility of\nsome sudden failure of volunteers in a particular trade, or some sudden\nnecessity of an increased force, that the administration, while\ndepending on the voluntary system for filling up the trades as a rule,\nholds always in reserve the power to call for special volunteers, or\ndraft any force needed from any quarter. Generally, however, all needs\nof this sort can be met by details from the class of unskilled or\ncommon laborers.\"\n\n\"How is this class of common laborers recruited?\" I asked. \"Surely\nnobody voluntarily enters that.\"\n\n\"It is the grade to which all new recruits belong for the first three\nyears of their service. It is not till after this period, during which\nhe is assignable to any work at the discretion of his superiors, that\nthe young man is allowed to elect a special avocation. These three\nyears of stringent discipline none are exempt from, and very glad our\nyoung men are to pass from this severe school into the comparative\nliberty of the trades. If a man were so stupid as to have no choice as\nto occupation, he would simply remain a common laborer; but such cases,\nas you may suppose, are not common.\"\n\n\"Having once elected and entered on a trade or occupation,\" I remarked,\n\"I suppose he has to stick to it the rest of his life.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"while frequent and merely\ncapricious changes of occupation are not encouraged or even permitted,\nevery worker is allowed, of course, under certain regulations and in\naccordance with the exigencies of the service, to volunteer for another\nindustry which he thinks would suit him better than his first choice.\nIn this case his application is received just as if he were\nvolunteering for the first time, and on the same terms. Not only this,\nbut a worker may likewise, under suitable regulations and not too\nfrequently, obtain a transfer to an establishment of the same industry\nin another part of the country which for any reason he may prefer.\nUnder your system a discontented man could indeed leave his work at\nwill, but he left his means of support at the same time, and took his\nchances as to future livelihood. We find that the number of men who\nwish to abandon an accustomed occupation for a new one, and old friends\nand associations for strange ones, is small. It is only the poorer sort\nof workmen who desire to change even as frequently as our regulations\npermit. Of course transfers or discharges, when health demands them,\nare always given.\"\n\n\"As an industrial system, I should think this might be extremely\nefficient,\" I said, \"but I don't see that it makes any provision for\nthe professional classes, the men who serve the nation with brains\ninstead of hands. Of course you can't get along without the\nbrain-workers. How, then, are they selected from those who are to serve\nas farmers and mechanics? That must require a very delicate sort of\nsifting process, I should say.\"\n\n\"So it does,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"the most delicate possible test is\nneeded here, and so we leave the question whether a man shall be a\nbrain or hand worker entirely to him to settle. At the end of the term\nof three years as a common laborer, which every man must serve, it is\nfor him to choose, in accordance to his natural tastes, whether he will\nfit himself for an art or profession, or be a farmer or mechanic. If he\nfeels that he can do better work with his brains than his muscles, he\nfinds every facility provided for testing the reality of his supposed\nbent, of cultivating it, and if fit of pursuing it as his avocation.\nThe schools of technology, of medicine, of art, of music, of\nhistrionics, and of higher liberal learning are always open to\naspirants without condition.\"\n\n\"Are not the schools flooded with young men whose only motive is to\navoid work?\"\n\nDr. Leete smiled a little grimly.\n\n\"No one is at all likely to enter the professional schools for the\npurpose of avoiding work, I assure you,\" he said. \"They are intended\nfor those with special aptitude for the branches they teach, and any\none without it would find it easier to do double hours at his trade\nthan try to keep up with the classes. Of course many honestly mistake\ntheir vocation, and, finding themselves unequal to the requirements of\nthe schools, drop out and return to the industrial service; no\ndiscredit attaches to such persons, for the public policy is to\nencourage all to develop suspected talents which only actual tests can\nprove the reality of. The professional and scientific schools of your\nday depended on the patronage of their pupils for support, and the\npractice appears to have been common of giving diplomas to unfit\npersons, who afterwards found their way into the professions. Our\nschools are national institutions, and to have passed their tests is a\nproof of special abilities not to be questioned.\n\n\"This opportunity for a professional training,\" the doctor continued,\n\"remains open to every man till the age of thirty is reached, after\nwhich students are not received, as there would remain too brief a\nperiod before the age of discharge in which to serve the nation in\ntheir professions. In your day young men had to choose their\nprofessions very young, and therefore, in a large proportion of\ninstances, wholly mistook their vocations. It is recognized nowadays\nthat the natural aptitudes of some are later than those of others in\ndeveloping, and therefore, while the choice of profession may be made\nas early as twenty-four, it remains open for six years longer.\"\n\nA question which had a dozen times before been on my lips now found\nutterance, a question which touched upon what, in my time, had been\nregarded the most vital difficulty in the way of any final settlement\nof the industrial problem. \"It is an extraordinary thing,\" I said,\n\"that you should not yet have said a word about the method of adjusting\nwages. Since the nation is the sole employer, the government must fix\nthe rate of wages and determine just how much everybody shall earn,\nfrom the doctors to the diggers. All I can say is, that this plan would\nnever have worked with us, and I don't see how it can now unless human\nnature has changed. In my day, nobody was satisfied with his wages or\nsalary. Even if he felt he received enough, he was sure his neighbor\nhad too much, which was as bad. If the universal discontent on this\nsubject, instead of being dissipated in curses and strikes directed\nagainst innumerable employers, could have been concentrated upon one,\nand that the government, the strongest ever devised would not have seen\ntwo pay days.\"\n\nDr. Leete laughed heartily.\n\n\"Very true, very true,\" he said, \"a general strike would most probably\nhave followed the first pay day, and a strike directed against a\ngovernment is a revolution.\"\n\n\"How, then, do you avoid a revolution every pay day?\" if demanded. \"Has\nsome prodigious philosopher devised a new system of calculus\nsatisfactory to all for determining the exact and comparative value of\nall sorts of service, whether by brawn or brain, by hand or voice, by\near or eye? Or has human nature itself changed, so that no man looks\nupon his own things but 'every man on the things of his neighbor'? One\nor the other of these events must be the explanation.\"\n\n\"Neither one nor the other, however, is,\" was my host's laughing\nresponse. \"And now, Mr. West,\" he continued, \"you must remember that\nyou are my patient as well as my guest, and permit me to prescribe\nsleep for you before we have any more conversation. It is after three\no'clock.\"\n\n\"The prescription is, no doubt, a wise one,\" I said; \"I only hope it\ncan be filled.\"\n\n\"I will see to that,\" the doctor replied, and he did, for he gave me a\nwineglass of something or other which sent me to sleep as soon as my\nhead touched the pillow.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nWhen I awoke I felt greatly refreshed, and lay a considerable time in a\ndozing state, enjoying the sensation of bodily comfort. The experiences\nof the day previous, my waking to find myself in the year 2000, the\nsight of the new Boston, my host and his family, and the wonderful\nthings I had heard, were a blank in my memory. I thought I was in my\nbed-chamber at home, and the half-dreaming, half-waking fancies which\npassed before my mind related to the incidents and experiences of my\nformer life. Dreamily I reviewed the incidents of Decoration Day, my\ntrip in company with Edith and her parents to Mount Auburn, and my\ndining with them on our return to the city. I recalled how extremely\nwell Edith had looked, and from that fell to thinking of our marriage;\nbut scarcely had my imagination begun to develop this delightful theme\nthan my waking dream was cut short by the recollection of the letter I\nhad received the night before from the builder announcing that the new\nstrikes might postpone indefinitely the completion of the new house.\nThe chagrin which this recollection brought with it effectually roused\nme. I remembered that I had an appointment with the builder at eleven\no'clock, to discuss the strike, and opening my eyes, looked up at the\nclock at the foot of my bed to see what time it was. But no clock met\nmy glance, and what was more, I instantly perceived that I was not in\nmy room. Starting up on my couch, I stared wildly round the strange\napartment.\n\nI think it must have been many seconds that I sat up thus in bed\nstaring about, without being able to regain the clew to my personal\nidentity. I was no more able to distinguish myself from pure being\nduring those moments than we may suppose a soul in the rough to be\nbefore it has received the ear-marks, the individualizing touches which\nmake it a person. Strange that the sense of this inability should be\nsuch anguish! but so we are constituted. There are no words for the\nmental torture I endured during this helpless, eyeless groping for\nmyself in a boundless void. No other experience of the mind gives\nprobably anything like the sense of absolute intellectual arrest from\nthe loss of a mental fulcrum, a starting point of thought, which comes\nduring such a momentary obscuration of the sense of one's identity. I\ntrust I may never know what it is again.\n\nI do not know how long this condition had lasted--it seemed an\ninterminable time--when, like a flash, the recollection of everything\ncame back to me. I remembered who and where I was, and how I had come\nhere, and that these scenes as of the life of yesterday which had been\npassing before my mind concerned a generation long, long ago mouldered\nto dust. Leaping from bed, I stood in the middle of the room clasping\nmy temples with all my might between my hands to keep them from\nbursting. Then I fell prone on the couch, and, burying my face in the\npillow, lay without motion. The reaction which was inevitable, from the\nmental elation, the fever of the intellect that had been the first\neffect of my tremendous experience, had arrived. The emotional crisis\nwhich had awaited the full realization of my actual position, and all\nthat it implied, was upon me, and with set teeth and laboring chest,\ngripping the bedstead with frenzied strength, I lay there and fought\nfor my sanity. In my mind, all had broken loose, habits of feeling,\nassociations of thought, ideas of persons and things, all had dissolved\nand lost coherence and were seething together in apparently\nirretrievable chaos. There were no rallying points, nothing was left\nstable. There only remained the will, and was any human will strong\nenough to say to such a weltering sea, \"Peace, be still\"? I dared not\nthink. Every effort to reason upon what had befallen me, and realize\nwhat it implied, set up an intolerable swimming of the brain. The idea\nthat I was two persons, that my identity was double, began to fascinate\nme with its simple solution of my experience.\n\nI knew that I was on the verge of losing my mental balance. If I lay\nthere thinking, I was doomed. Diversion of some sort I must have, at\nleast the diversion of physical exertion. I sprang up, and, hastily\ndressing, opened the door of my room and went down-stairs. The hour was\nvery early, it being not yet fairly light, and I found no one in the\nlower part of the house. There was a hat in the hall, and, opening the\nfront door, which was fastened with a slightness indicating that\nburglary was not among the perils of the modern Boston, I found myself\non the street. For two hours I walked or ran through the streets of the\ncity, visiting most quarters of the peninsular part of the town. None\nbut an antiquarian who knows something of the contrast which the Boston\nof today offers to the Boston of the nineteenth century can begin to\nappreciate what a series of bewildering surprises I underwent during\nthat time. Viewed from the house-top the day before, the city had\nindeed appeared strange to me, but that was only in its general aspect.\nHow complete the change had been I first realized now that I walked the\nstreets. The few old landmarks which still remained only intensified\nthis effect, for without them I might have imagined myself in a foreign\ntown. A man may leave his native city in childhood, and return fifty\nyears later, perhaps, to find it transformed in many features. He is\nastonished, but he is not bewildered. He is aware of a great lapse of\ntime, and of changes likewise occurring in himself meanwhile. He but\ndimly recalls the city as he knew it when a child. But remember that\nthere was no sense of any lapse of time with me. So far as my\nconsciousness was concerned, it was but yesterday, but a few hours,\nsince I had walked these streets in which scarcely a feature had\nescaped a complete metamorphosis. The mental image of the old city was\nso fresh and strong that it did not yield to the impression of the\nactual city, but contended with it, so that it was first one and then\nthe other which seemed the more unreal. There was nothing I saw which\nwas not blurred in this way, like the faces of a composite photograph.\n\nFinally, I stood again at the door of the house from which I had come\nout. My feet must have instinctively brought me back to the site of my\nold home, for I had no clear idea of returning thither. It was no more\nhomelike to me than any other spot in this city of a strange\ngeneration, nor were its inmates less utterly and necessarily strangers\nthan all the other men and women now on the earth. Had the door of the\nhouse been locked, I should have been reminded by its resistance that I\nhad no object in entering, and turned away, but it yielded to my hand,\nand advancing with uncertain steps through the hall, I entered one of\nthe apartments opening from it. Throwing myself into a chair, I covered\nmy burning eyeballs with my hands to shut out the horror of\nstrangeness. My mental confusion was so intense as to produce actual\nnausea. The anguish of those moments, during which my brain seemed\nmelting, or the abjectness of my sense of helplessness, how can I\ndescribe? In my despair I groaned aloud. I began to feel that unless\nsome help should come I was about to lose my mind. And just then it did\ncome. I heard the rustle of drapery, and looked up. Edith Leete was\nstanding before me. Her beautiful face was full of the most poignant\nsympathy.\n\n\"Oh, what is the matter, Mr. West?\" she said. \"I was here when you came\nin. I saw how dreadfully distressed you looked, and when I heard you\ngroan, I could not keep silent. What has happened to you? Where have\nyou been? Can't I do something for you?\"\n\nPerhaps she involuntarily held out her hands in a gesture of compassion\nas she spoke. At any rate I had caught them in my own and was clinging\nto them with an impulse as instinctive as that which prompts the\ndrowning man to seize upon and cling to the rope which is thrown him as\nhe sinks for the last time. As I looked up into her compassionate face\nand her eyes moist with pity, my brain ceased to whirl. The tender\nhuman sympathy which thrilled in the soft pressure of her fingers had\nbrought me the support I needed. Its effect to calm and soothe was like\nthat of some wonder-working elixir.\n\n\"God bless you,\" I said, after a few moments. \"He must have sent you to\nme just now. I think I was in danger of going crazy if you had not\ncome.\" At this the tears came into her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. West!\" she cried. \"How heartless you must have thought us! How\ncould we leave you to yourself so long! But it is over now, is it not?\nYou are better, surely.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"thanks to you. If you will not go away quite yet, I\nshall be myself soon.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will not go away,\" she said, with a little quiver of her\nface, more expressive of her sympathy than a volume of words. \"You must\nnot think us so heartless as we seemed in leaving you so by yourself. I\nscarcely slept last night, for thinking how strange your waking would\nbe this morning; but father said you would sleep till late. He said\nthat it would be better not to show too much sympathy with you at\nfirst, but to try to divert your thoughts and make you feel that you\nwere among friends.\"\n\n\"You have indeed made me feel that,\" I answered. \"But you see it is a\ngood deal of a jolt to drop a hundred years, and although I did not\nseem to feel it so much last night, I have had very odd sensations this\nmorning.\" While I held her hands and kept my eyes on her face, I could\nalready even jest a little at my plight.\n\n\"No one thought of such a thing as your going out in the city alone so\nearly in the morning,\" she went on. \"Oh, Mr. West, where have you been?\"\n\nThen I told her of my morning's experience, from my first waking till\nthe moment I had looked up to see her before me, just as I have told it\nhere. She was overcome by distressful pity during the recital, and,\nthough I had released one of her hands, did not try to take from me the\nother, seeing, no doubt, how much good it did me to hold it. \"I can\nthink a little what this feeling must have been like,\" she said. \"It\nmust have been terrible. And to think you were left alone to struggle\nwith it! Can you ever forgive us?\"\n\n\"But it is gone now. You have driven it quite away for the present,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"You will not let it return again,\" she queried anxiously.\n\n\"I can't quite say that,\" I replied. \"It might be too early to say\nthat, considering how strange everything will still be to me.\"\n\n\"But you will not try to contend with it alone again, at least,\" she\npersisted. \"Promise that you will come to us, and let us sympathize\nwith you, and try to help you. Perhaps we can't do much, but it will\nsurely be better than to try to bear such feelings alone.\"\n\n\"I will come to you if you will let me,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh yes, yes, I beg you will,\" she said eagerly. \"I would do anything\nto help you that I could.\"\n\n\"All you need do is to be sorry for me, as you seem to be now,\" I\nreplied.\n\n\"It is understood, then,\" she said, smiling with wet eyes, \"that you\nare to come and tell me next time, and not run all over Boston among\nstrangers.\"\n\nThis assumption that we were not strangers seemed scarcely strange, so\nnear within these few minutes had my trouble and her sympathetic tears\nbrought us.\n\n\"I will promise, when you come to me,\" she added, with an expression of\ncharming archness, passing, as she continued, into one of enthusiasm,\n\"to seem as sorry for you as you wish, but you must not for a moment\nsuppose that I am really sorry for you at all, or that I think you will\nlong be sorry for yourself. I know, as well as I know that the world\nnow is heaven compared with what it was in your day, that the only\nfeeling you will have after a little while will be one of thankfulness\nto God that your life in that age was so strangely cut off, to be\nreturned to you in this.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nDr. and Mrs. Leete were evidently not a little startled to learn, when\nthey presently appeared, that I had been all over the city alone that\nmorning, and it was apparent that they were agreeably surprised to see\nthat I seemed so little agitated after the experience.\n\n\"Your stroll could scarcely have failed to be a very interesting one,\"\nsaid Mrs. Leete, as we sat down to table soon after. \"You must have\nseen a good many new things.\"\n\n\"I saw very little that was not new,\" I replied. \"But I think what\nsurprised me as much as anything was not to find any stores on\nWashington Street, or any banks on State. What have you done with the\nmerchants and bankers? Hung them all, perhaps, as the anarchists wanted\nto do in my day?\"\n\n\"Not so bad as that,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"We have simply dispensed with\nthem. Their functions are obsolete in the modern world.\"\n\n\"Who sells you things when you want to buy them?\" I inquired.\n\n\"There is neither selling nor buying nowadays; the distribution of\ngoods is effected in another way. As to the bankers, having no money we\nhave no use for those gentry.\"\n\n\"Miss Leete,\" said I, turning to Edith, \"I am afraid that your father\nis making sport of me. I don't blame him, for the temptation my\ninnocence offers must be extraordinary. But, really, there are limits\nto my credulity as to possible alterations in the social system.\"\n\n\"Father has no idea of jesting, I am sure,\" she replied, with a\nreassuring smile.\n\nThe conversation took another turn then, the point of ladies' fashions\nin the nineteenth century being raised, if I remember rightly, by Mrs.\nLeete, and it was not till after breakfast, when the doctor had invited\nme up to the house-top, which appeared to be a favorite resort of his,\nthat he recurred to the subject.\n\n\"You were surprised,\" he said, \"at my saying that we got along without\nmoney or trade, but a moment's reflection will show that trade existed\nand money was needed in your day simply because the business of\nproduction was left in private hands, and that, consequently, they are\nsuperfluous now.\"\n\n\"I do not at once see how that follows,\" I replied.\n\n\"It is very simple,\" said Dr. Leete. \"When innumerable different and\nindependent persons produced the various things needful to life and\ncomfort, endless exchanges between individuals were requisite in order\nthat they might supply themselves with what they desired. These\nexchanges constituted trade, and money was essential as their medium.\nBut as soon as the nation became the sole producer of all sorts of\ncommodities, there was no need of exchanges between individuals that\nthey might get what they required. Everything was procurable from one\nsource, and nothing could be procured anywhere else. A system of direct\ndistribution from the national storehouses took the place of trade, and\nfor this money was unnecessary.\"\n\n\"How is this distribution managed?\" I asked.\n\n\"On the simplest possible plan,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"A credit\ncorresponding to his share of the annual product of the nation is given\nto every citizen on the public books at the beginning of each year, and\na credit card issued him with which he procures at the public\nstorehouses, found in every community, whatever he desires whenever he\ndesires it. This arrangement, you will see, totally obviates the\nnecessity for business transactions of any sort between individuals and\nconsumers. Perhaps you would like to see what our credit cards are like.\n\n\"You observe,\" he pursued as I was curiously examining the piece of\npasteboard he gave me, \"that this card is issued for a certain number\nof dollars. We have kept the old word, but not the substance. The term,\nas we use it, answers to no real thing, but merely serves as an\nalgebraical symbol for comparing the values of products with one\nanother. For this purpose they are all priced in dollars and cents,\njust as in your day. The value of what I procure on this card is\nchecked off by the clerk, who pricks out of these tiers of squares the\nprice of what I order.\"\n\n\"If you wanted to buy something of your neighbor, could you transfer\npart of your credit to him as consideration?\" I inquired.\n\n\"In the first place,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"our neighbors have nothing to\nsell us, but in any event our credit would not be transferable, being\nstrictly personal. Before the nation could even think of honoring any\nsuch transfer as you speak of, it would be bound to inquire into all\nthe circumstances of the transaction, so as to be able to guarantee its\nabsolute equity. It would have been reason enough, had there been no\nother, for abolishing money, that its possession was no indication of\nrightful title to it. In the hands of the man who had stolen it or\nmurdered for it, it was as good as in those which had earned it by\nindustry. People nowadays interchange gifts and favors out of\nfriendship, but buying and selling is considered absolutely\ninconsistent with the mutual benevolence and disinterestedness which\nshould prevail between citizens and the sense of community of interest\nwhich supports our social system. According to our ideas, buying and\nselling is essentially anti-social in all its tendencies. It is an\neducation in self-seeking at the expense of others, and no society\nwhose citizens are trained in such a school can possibly rise above a\nvery low grade of civilization.\"\n\n\"What if you have to spend more than your card in any one year?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"The provision is so ample that we are more likely not to spend it\nall,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"But if extraordinary expenses should exhaust\nit, we can obtain a limited advance on the next year's credit, though\nthis practice is not encouraged, and a heavy discount is charged to\ncheck it. Of course if a man showed himself a reckless spendthrift he\nwould receive his allowance monthly or weekly instead of yearly, or if\nnecessary not be permitted to handle it all.\"\n\n\"If you don't spend your allowance, I suppose it accumulates?\"\n\n\"That is also permitted to a certain extent when a special outlay is\nanticipated. But unless notice to the contrary is given, it is presumed\nthat the citizen who does not fully expend his credit did not have\noccasion to do so, and the balance is turned into the general surplus.\"\n\n\"Such a system does not encourage saving habits on the part of\ncitizens,\" I said.\n\n\"It is not intended to,\" was the reply. \"The nation is rich, and does\nnot wish the people to deprive themselves of any good thing. In your\nday, men were bound to lay up goods and money against coming failure of\nthe means of support and for their children. This necessity made\nparsimony a virtue. But now it would have no such laudable object, and,\nhaving lost its utility, it has ceased to be regarded as a virtue. No\nman any more has any care for the morrow, either for himself or his\nchildren, for the nation guarantees the nurture, education, and\ncomfortable maintenance of every citizen from the cradle to the grave.\"\n\n\"That is a sweeping guarantee!\" I said. \"What certainty can there be\nthat the value of a man's labor will recompense the nation for its\noutlay on him? On the whole, society may be able to support all its\nmembers, but some must earn less than enough for their support, and\nothers more; and that brings us back once more to the wages question,\non which you have hitherto said nothing. It was at just this point, if\nyou remember, that our talk ended last evening; and I say again, as I\ndid then, that here I should suppose a national industrial system like\nyours would find its main difficulty. How, I ask once more, can you\nadjust satisfactorily the comparative wages or remuneration of the\nmultitude of avocations, so unlike and so incommensurable, which are\nnecessary for the service of society? In our day the market rate\ndetermined the price of labor of all sorts, as well as of goods. The\nemployer paid as little as he could, and the worker got as much. It was\nnot a pretty system ethically, I admit; but it did, at least, furnish\nus a rough and ready formula for settling a question which must be\nsettled ten thousand times a day if the world was ever going to get\nforward. There seemed to us no other practicable way of doing it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"it was the only practicable way under a\nsystem which made the interests of every individual antagonistic to\nthose of every other; but it would have been a pity if humanity could\nnever have devised a better plan, for yours was simply the application\nto the mutual relations of men of the devil's maxim, 'Your necessity is\nmy opportunity.' The reward of any service depended not upon its\ndifficulty, danger, or hardship, for throughout the world it seems that\nthe most perilous, severe, and repulsive labor was done by the worst\npaid classes; but solely upon the strait of those who needed the\nservice.\"\n\n\"All that is conceded,\" I said. \"But, with all its defects, the plan of\nsettling prices by the market rate was a practical plan; and I cannot\nconceive what satisfactory substitute you can have devised for it. The\ngovernment being the only possible employer, there is of course no\nlabor market or market rate. Wages of all sorts must be arbitrarily\nfixed by the government. I cannot imagine a more complex and delicate\nfunction than that must be, or one, however performed, more certain to\nbreed universal dissatisfaction.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"but I think you exaggerate the\ndifficulty. Suppose a board of fairly sensible men were charged with\nsettling the wages for all sorts of trades under a system which, like\nours, guaranteed employment to all, while permitting the choice of\navocations. Don't you see that, however unsatisfactory the first\nadjustment might be, the mistakes would soon correct themselves? The\nfavored trades would have too many volunteers, and those discriminated\nagainst would lack them till the errors were set right. But this is\naside from the purpose, for, though this plan would, I fancy, be\npracticable enough, it is no part of our system.\"\n\n\"How, then, do you regulate wages?\" I once more asked.\n\nDr. Leete did not reply till after several moments of meditative\nsilence. \"I know, of course,\" he finally said, \"enough of the old order\nof things to understand just what you mean by that question; and yet\nthe present order is so utterly different at this point that I am a\nlittle at loss how to answer you best. You ask me how we regulate\nwages; I can only reply that there is no idea in the modern social\neconomy which at all corresponds with what was meant by wages in your\nday.\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean that you have no money to pay wages in,\" said I.\n\"But the credit given the worker at the government storehouse answers\nto his wages with us. How is the amount of the credit given\nrespectively to the workers in different lines determined? By what\ntitle does the individual claim his particular share? What is the basis\nof allotment?\"\n\n\"His title,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"is his humanity. The basis of his\nclaim is the fact that he is a man.\"\n\n\"The fact that he is a man!\" I repeated, incredulously. \"Do you\npossibly mean that all have the same share?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly.\"\n\nThe readers of this book never having practically known any other\narrangement, or perhaps very carefully considered the historical\naccounts of former epochs in which a very different system prevailed,\ncannot be expected to appreciate the stupor of amazement into which Dr.\nLeete's simple statement plunged me.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, smiling, \"that it is not merely that we have no\nmoney to pay wages in, but, as I said, we have nothing at all answering\nto your idea of wages.\"\n\nBy this time I had pulled myself together sufficiently to voice some of\nthe criticisms which, man of the nineteenth century as I was, came\nuppermost in my mind, upon this to me astounding arrangement. \"Some men\ndo twice the work of others!\" I exclaimed. \"Are the clever workmen\ncontent with a plan that ranks them with the indifferent?\"\n\n\"We leave no possible ground for any complaint of injustice,\" replied\nDr. Leete, \"by requiring precisely the same measure of service from\nall.\"\n\n\"How can you do that, I should like to know, when no two men's powers\nare the same?\"\n\n\"Nothing could be simpler,\" was Dr. Leete's reply. \"We require of each\nthat he shall make the same effort; that is, we demand of him the best\nservice it is in his power to give.\"\n\n\"And supposing all do the best they can,\" I answered, \"the amount of\nthe product resulting is twice greater from one man than from another.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"but the amount of the resulting\nproduct has nothing whatever to do with the question, which is one of\ndesert. Desert is a moral question, and the amount of the product a\nmaterial quantity. It would be an extraordinary sort of logic which\nshould try to determine a moral question by a material standard. The\namount of the effort alone is pertinent to the question of desert. All\nmen who do their best, do the same. A man's endowments, however\ngodlike, merely fix the measure of his duty. The man of great\nendowments who does not do all he might, though he may do more than a\nman of small endowments who does his best, is deemed a less deserving\nworker than the latter, and dies a debtor to his fellows. The Creator\nsets men's tasks for them by the faculties he gives them; we simply\nexact their fulfillment.\"\n\n\"No doubt that is very fine philosophy,\" I said; \"nevertheless it seems\nhard that the man who produces twice as much as another, even if both\ndo their best, should have only the same share.\"\n\n\"Does it, indeed, seem so to you?\" responded Dr. Leete. \"Now, do you\nknow, that seems very curious to me? The way it strikes people nowadays\nis, that a man who can produce twice as much as another with the same\neffort, instead of being rewarded for doing so, ought to be punished if\nhe does not do so. In the nineteenth century, when a horse pulled a\nheavier load than a goat, I suppose you rewarded him. Now, we should\nhave whipped him soundly if he had not, on the ground that, being much\nstronger, he ought to. It is singular how ethical standards change.\"\nThe doctor said this with such a twinkle in his eye that I was obliged\nto laugh.\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that the real reason that we rewarded men for\ntheir endowments, while we considered those of horses and goats merely\nas fixing the service to be severally required of them, was that the\nanimals, not being reasoning beings, naturally did the best they could,\nwhereas men could only be induced to do so by rewarding them according\nto the amount of their product. That brings me to ask why, unless human\nnature has mightily changed in a hundred years, you are not under the\nsame necessity.\"\n\n\"We are,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"I don't think there has been any change\nin human nature in that respect since your day. It is still so\nconstituted that special incentives in the form of prizes, and\nadvantages to be gained, are requisite to call out the best endeavors\nof the average man in any direction.\"\n\n\"But what inducement,\" I asked, \"can a man have to put forth his best\nendeavors when, however much or little he accomplishes, his income\nremains the same? High characters may be moved by devotion to the\ncommon welfare under such a system, but does not the average man tend\nto rest back on his oar, reasoning that it is of no use to make a\nspecial effort, since the effort will not increase his income, nor its\nwithholding diminish it?\"\n\n\"Does it then really seem to you,\" answered my companion, \"that human\nnature is insensible to any motives save fear of want and love of\nluxury, that you should expect security and equality of livelihood to\nleave them without possible incentives to effort? Your contemporaries\ndid not really think so, though they might fancy they did. When it was\na question of the grandest class of efforts, the most absolute\nself-devotion, they depended on quite other incentives. Not higher\nwages, but honor and the hope of men's gratitude, patriotism and the\ninspiration of duty, were the motives which they set before their\nsoldiers when it was a question of dying for the nation, and never was\nthere an age of the world when those motives did not call out what is\nbest and noblest in men. And not only this, but when you come to\nanalyze the love of money which was the general impulse to effort in\nyour day, you find that the dread of want and desire of luxury was but\none of several motives which the pursuit of money represented; the\nothers, and with many the more influential, being desire of power, of\nsocial position, and reputation for ability and success. So you see\nthat though we have abolished poverty and the fear of it, and\ninordinate luxury with the hope of it, we have not touched the greater\npart of the motives which underlay the love of money in former times,\nor any of those which prompted the supremer sorts of effort. The\ncoarser motives, which no longer move us, have been replaced by higher\nmotives wholly unknown to the mere wage earners of your age. Now that\nindustry of whatever sort is no longer self-service, but service of the\nnation, patriotism, passion for humanity, impel the worker as in your\nday they did the soldier. The army of industry is an army, not alone by\nvirtue of its perfect organization, but by reason also of the ardor of\nself-devotion which animates its members.\n\n\"But as you used to supplement the motives of patriotism with the love\nof glory, in order to stimulate the valor of your soldiers, so do we.\nBased as our industrial system is on the principle of requiring the\nsame unit of effort from every man, that is, the best he can do, you\nwill see that the means by which we spur the workers to do their best\nmust be a very essential part of our scheme. With us, diligence in the\nnational service is the sole and certain way to public repute, social\ndistinction, and official power. The value of a man's services to\nsociety fixes his rank in it. Compared with the effect of our social\narrangements in impelling men to be zealous in business, we deem the\nobject-lessons of biting poverty and wanton luxury on which you\ndepended a device as weak and uncertain as it was barbaric. The lust of\nhonor even in your sordid day notoriously impelled men to more\ndesperate effort than the love of money could.\"\n\n\"I should be extremely interested,\" I said, \"to learn something of what\nthese social arrangements are.\"\n\n\"The scheme in its details,\" replied the doctor, \"is of course very\nelaborate, for it underlies the entire organization of our industrial\narmy; but a few words will give you a general idea of it.\"\n\nAt this moment our talk was charmingly interrupted by the emergence\nupon the aerial platform where we sat of Edith Leete. She was dressed\nfor the street, and had come to speak to her father about some\ncommission she was to do for him.\n\n\"By the way, Edith,\" he exclaimed, as she was about to leave us to\nourselves, \"I wonder if Mr. West would not be interested in visiting\nthe store with you? I have been telling him something about our system\nof distribution, and perhaps he might like to see it in practical\noperation.\"\n\n\"My daughter,\" he added, turning to me, \"is an indefatigable shopper,\nand can tell you more about the stores than I can.\"\n\nThe proposition was naturally very agreeable to me, and Edith being\ngood enough to say that she should be glad to have my company, we left\nthe house together.\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\"If I am going to explain our way of shopping to you,\" said my\ncompanion, as we walked along the street, \"you must explain your way to\nme. I have never been able to understand it from all I have read on the\nsubject. For example, when you had such a vast number of shops, each\nwith its different assortment, how could a lady ever settle upon any\npurchase till she had visited all the shops? for, until she had, she\ncould not know what there was to choose from.\"\n\n\"It was as you suppose; that was the only way she could know,\" I\nreplied.\n\n\"Father calls me an indefatigable shopper, but I should soon be a very\nfatigued one if I had to do as they did,\" was Edith's laughing comment.\n\n\"The loss of time in going from shop to shop was indeed a waste which\nthe busy bitterly complained of,\" I said; \"but as for the ladies of the\nidle class, though they complained also, I think the system was really\na godsend by furnishing a device to kill time.\"\n\n\"But say there were a thousand shops in a city, hundreds, perhaps, of\nthe same sort, how could even the idlest find time to make their\nrounds?\"\n\n\"They really could not visit all, of course,\" I replied. \"Those who did\na great deal of buying, learned in time where they might expect to find\nwhat they wanted. This class had made a science of the specialties of\nthe shops, and bought at advantage, always getting the most and best\nfor the least money. It required, however, long experience to acquire\nthis knowledge. Those who were too busy, or bought too little to gain\nit, took their chances and were generally unfortunate, getting the\nleast and worst for the most money. It was the merest chance if persons\nnot experienced in shopping received the value of their money.\"\n\n\"But why did you put up with such a shockingly inconvenient arrangement\nwhen you saw its faults so plainly?\" Edith asked me.\n\n\"It was like all our social arrangements,\" I replied. \"You can see\ntheir faults scarcely more plainly than we did, but we saw no remedy\nfor them.\"\n\n\"Here we are at the store of our ward,\" said Edith, as we turned in at\nthe great portal of one of the magnificent public buildings I had\nobserved in my morning walk. There was nothing in the exterior aspect\nof the edifice to suggest a store to a representative of the nineteenth\ncentury. There was no display of goods in the great windows, or any\ndevice to advertise wares, or attract custom. Nor was there any sort of\nsign or legend on the front of the building to indicate the character\nof the business carried on there; but instead, above the portal,\nstanding out from the front of the building, a majestic life-size group\nof statuary, the central figure of which was a female ideal of Plenty,\nwith her cornucopia. Judging from the composition of the throng passing\nin and out, about the same proportion of the sexes among shoppers\nobtained as in the nineteenth century. As we entered, Edith said that\nthere was one of these great distributing establishments in each ward\nof the city, so that no residence was more than five or ten minutes'\nwalk from one of them. It was the first interior of a twentieth-century\npublic building that I had ever beheld, and the spectacle naturally\nimpressed me deeply. I was in a vast hall full of light, received not\nalone from the windows on all sides, but from the dome, the point of\nwhich was a hundred feet above. Beneath it, in the centre of the hall,\na magnificent fountain played, cooling the atmosphere to a delicious\nfreshness with its spray. The walls and ceiling were frescoed in mellow\ntints, calculated to soften without absorbing the light which flooded\nthe interior. Around the fountain was a space occupied with chairs and\nsofas, on which many persons were seated conversing. Legends on the\nwalls all about the hall indicated to what classes of commodities the\ncounters below were devoted. Edith directed her steps towards one of\nthese, where samples of muslin of a bewildering variety were displayed,\nand proceeded to inspect them.\n\n\"Where is the clerk?\" I asked, for there was no one behind the counter,\nand no one seemed coming to attend to the customer.\n\n\"I have no need of the clerk yet,\" said Edith; \"I have not made my\nselection.\"\n\n\"It was the principal business of clerks to help people to make their\nselections in my day,\" I replied.\n\n\"What! To tell people what they wanted?\"\n\n\"Yes; and oftener to induce them to buy what they didn't want.\"\n\n\"But did not ladies find that very impertinent?\" Edith asked,\nwonderingly. \"What concern could it possibly be to the clerks whether\npeople bought or not?\"\n\n\"It was their sole concern,\" I answered. \"They were hired for the\npurpose of getting rid of the goods, and were expected to do their\nutmost, short of the use of force, to compass that end.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! How stupid I am to forget!\" said Edith. \"The storekeeper and\nhis clerks depended for their livelihood on selling the goods in your\nday. Of course that is all different now. The goods are the nation's.\nThey are here for those who want them, and it is the business of the\nclerks to wait on people and take their orders; but it is not the\ninterest of the clerk or the nation to dispose of a yard or a pound of\nanything to anybody who does not want it.\" She smiled as she added,\n\"How exceedingly odd it must have seemed to have clerks trying to\ninduce one to take what one did not want, or was doubtful about!\"\n\n\"But even a twentieth century clerk might make himself useful in giving\nyou information about the goods, though he did not tease you to buy\nthem,\" I suggested.\n\n\"No,\" said Edith, \"that is not the business of the clerk. These printed\ncards, for which the government authorities are responsible, give us\nall the information we can possibly need.\"\n\nI saw then that there was fastened to each sample a card containing in\nsuccinct form a complete statement of the make and materials of the\ngoods and all its qualities, as well as price, leaving absolutely no\npoint to hang a question on.\n\n\"The clerk has, then, nothing to say about the goods he sells?\" I said.\n\n\"Nothing at all. It is not necessary that he should know or profess to\nknow anything about them. Courtesy and accuracy in taking orders are\nall that are required of him.\"\n\n\"What a prodigious amount of lying that simple arrangement saves!\" I\nejaculated.\n\n\"Do you mean that all the clerks misrepresented their goods in your\nday?\" Edith asked.\n\n\"God forbid that I should say so!\" I replied, \"for there were many who\ndid not, and they were entitled to especial credit, for when one's\nlivelihood and that of his wife and babies depended on the amount of\ngoods he could dispose of, the temptation to deceive the customer--or\nlet him deceive himself--was wellnigh overwhelming. But, Miss Leete, I\nam distracting you from your task with my talk.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I have made my selections.\" With that she touched a\nbutton, and in a moment a clerk appeared. He took down her order on a\ntablet with a pencil which made two copies, of which he gave one to\nher, and enclosing the counterpart in a small receptacle, dropped it\ninto a transmitting tube.\n\n\"The duplicate of the order,\" said Edith as she turned away from the\ncounter, after the clerk had punched the value of her purchase out of\nthe credit card she gave him, \"is given to the purchaser, so that any\nmistakes in filling it can be easily traced and rectified.\"\n\n\"You were very quick about your selections,\" I said. \"May I ask how you\nknew that you might not have found something to suit you better in some\nof the other stores? But probably you are required to buy in your own\ndistrict.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she replied. \"We buy where we please, though naturally most\noften near home. But I should have gained nothing by visiting other\nstores. The assortment in all is exactly the same, representing as it\ndoes in each case samples of all the varieties produced or imported by\nthe United States. That is why one can decide quickly, and never need\nvisit two stores.\"\n\n\"And is this merely a sample store? I see no clerks cutting off goods\nor marking bundles.\"\n\n\"All our stores are sample stores, except as to a few classes of\narticles. The goods, with these exceptions, are all at the great\ncentral warehouse of the city, to which they are shipped directly from\nthe producers. We order from the sample and the printed statement of\ntexture, make, and qualities. The orders are sent to the warehouse, and\nthe goods distributed from there.\"\n\n\"That must be a tremendous saving of handling,\" I said. \"By our system,\nthe manufacturer sold to the wholesaler, the wholesaler to the\nretailer, and the retailer to the consumer, and the goods had to be\nhandled each time. You avoid one handling of the goods, and eliminate\nthe retailer altogether, with his big profit and the army of clerks it\ngoes to support. Why, Miss Leete, this store is merely the order\ndepartment of a wholesale house, with no more than a wholesaler's\ncomplement of clerks. Under our system of handling the goods,\npersuading the customer to buy them, cutting them off, and packing\nthem, ten clerks would not do what one does here. The saving must be\nenormous.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Edith, \"but of course we have never known any\nother way. But, Mr. West, you must not fail to ask father to take you\nto the central warehouse some day, where they receive the orders from\nthe different sample houses all over the city and parcel out and send\nthe goods to their destinations. He took me there not long ago, and it\nwas a wonderful sight. The system is certainly perfect; for example,\nover yonder in that sort of cage is the dispatching clerk. The orders,\nas they are taken by the different departments in the store, are sent\nby transmitters to him. His assistants sort them and enclose each class\nin a carrier-box by itself. The dispatching clerk has a dozen pneumatic\ntransmitters before him answering to the general classes of goods, each\ncommunicating with the corresponding department at the warehouse. He\ndrops the box of orders into the tube it calls for, and in a few\nmoments later it drops on the proper desk in the warehouse, together\nwith all the orders of the same sort from the other sample stores. The\norders are read off, recorded, and sent to be filled, like lightning.\nThe filling I thought the most interesting part. Bales of cloth are\nplaced on spindles and turned by machinery, and the cutter, who also\nhas a machine, works right through one bale after another till\nexhausted, when another man takes his place; and it is the same with\nthose who fill the orders in any other staple. The packages are then\ndelivered by larger tubes to the city districts, and thence distributed\nto the houses. You may understand how quickly it is all done when I\ntell you that my order will probably be at home sooner than I could\nhave carried it from here.\"\n\n\"How do you manage in the thinly settled rural districts?\" I asked.\n\n\"The system is the same,\" Edith explained; \"the village sample shops\nare connected by transmitters with the central county warehouse, which\nmay be twenty miles away. The transmission is so swift, though, that\nthe time lost on the way is trifling. But, to save expense, in many\ncounties one set of tubes connect several villages with the warehouse,\nand then there is time lost waiting for one another. Sometimes it is\ntwo or three hours before goods ordered are received. It was so where I\nwas staying last summer, and I found it quite inconvenient.\"[1]\n\n\"There must be many other respects also, no doubt, in which the country\nstores are inferior to the city stores,\" I suggested.\n\n\"No,\" Edith answered, \"they are otherwise precisely as good. The sample\nshop of the smallest village, just like this one, gives you your choice\nof all the varieties of goods the nation has, for the county warehouse\ndraws on the same source as the city warehouse.\"\n\nAs we walked home I commented on the great variety in the size and cost\nof the houses. \"How is it,\" I asked, \"that this difference is\nconsistent with the fact that all citizens have the same income?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Edith explained, \"although the income is the same, personal\ntaste determines how the individual shall spend it. Some like fine\nhorses; others, like myself, prefer pretty clothes; and still others\nwant an elaborate table. The rents which the nation receives for these\nhouses vary, according to size, elegance, and location, so that\neverybody can find something to suit. The larger houses are usually\noccupied by large families, in which there are several to contribute to\nthe rent; while small families, like ours, find smaller houses more\nconvenient and economical. It is a matter of taste and convenience\nwholly. I have read that in old times people often kept up\nestablishments and did other things which they could not afford for\nostentation, to make people think them richer than they were. Was it\nreally so, Mr. West?\"\n\n\"I shall have to admit that it was,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well, you see, it could not be so nowadays; for everybody's income is\nknown, and it is known that what is spent one way must be saved\nanother.\"\n\n\n[1] I am informed since the above is in type that this lack of\nperfection in the distributing service of some of the country districts\nis to be remedied, and that soon every village will have its own set of\ntubes.\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nWhen we arrived home, Dr. Leete had not yet returned, and Mrs. Leete\nwas not visible. \"Are you fond of music, Mr. West?\" Edith asked.\n\nI assured her that it was half of life, according to my notion.\n\n\"I ought to apologize for inquiring,\" she said. \"It is not a question\nthat we ask one another nowadays; but I have read that in your day,\neven among the cultured class, there were some who did not care for\nmusic.\"\n\n\"You must remember, in excuse,\" I said, \"that we had some rather absurd\nkinds of music.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I know that; I am afraid I should not have fancied it\nall myself. Would you like to hear some of ours now, Mr. West?\"\n\n\"Nothing would delight me so much as to listen to you,\" I said.\n\n\"To me!\" she exclaimed, laughing. \"Did you think I was going to play or\nsing to you?\"\n\n\"I hoped so, certainly,\" I replied.\n\nSeeing that I was a little abashed, she subdued her merriment and\nexplained. \"Of course, we all sing nowadays as a matter of course in\nthe training of the voice, and some learn to play instruments for their\nprivate amusement; but the professional music is so much grander and\nmore perfect than any performance of ours, and so easily commanded when\nwe wish to hear it, that we don't think of calling our singing or\nplaying music at all. All the really fine singers and players are in\nthe musical service, and the rest of us hold our peace for the main\npart. But would you really like to hear some music?\"\n\nI assured her once more that I would.\n\n\"Come, then, into the music room,\" she said, and I followed her into an\napartment finished, without hangings, in wood, with a floor of polished\nwood. I was prepared for new devices in musical instruments, but I saw\nnothing in the room which by any stretch of imagination could be\nconceived as such. It was evident that my puzzled appearance was\naffording intense amusement to Edith.\n\n\"Please look at to-day's music,\" she said, handing me a card, \"and tell\nme what you would prefer. It is now five o'clock, you will remember.\"\n\nThe card bore the date \"September 12, 2000,\" and contained the longest\nprogramme of music I had ever seen. It was as various as it was long,\nincluding a most extraordinary range of vocal and instrumental solos,\nduets, quartettes, and various orchestral combinations. I remained\nbewildered by the prodigious list until Edith's pink finger tip\nindicated a particular section of it, where several selections were\nbracketed, with the words \"5 P.M.\" against them; then I observed that\nthis prodigious programme was an all-day one, divided into twenty-four\nsections answering to the hours. There were but a few pieces of music\nin the \"5 P.M.\" section, and I indicated an organ piece as my\npreference.\n\n\"I am so glad you like the organ,\" said she. \"I think there is scarcely\nany music that suits my mood oftener.\"\n\nShe made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room, so far as I\ncould see, merely touched one or two screws, and at once the room was\nfilled with the music of a grand organ anthem; filled, not flooded,\nfor, by some means, the volume of melody had been perfectly graduated\nto the size of the apartment. I listened, scarcely breathing, to the\nclose. Such music, so perfectly rendered, I had never expected to hear.\n\n\"Grand!\" I cried, as the last great wave of sound broke and ebbed away\ninto silence. \"Bach must be at the keys of that organ; but where is the\norgan?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, please,\" said Edith; \"I want to have you listen to this\nwaltz before you ask any questions. I think it is perfectly charming\";\nand as she spoke the sound of violins filled the room with the witchery\nof a summer night. When this had also ceased, she said: \"There is\nnothing in the least mysterious about the music, as you seem to\nimagine. It is not made by fairies or genii, but by good, honest, and\nexceedingly clever human hands. We have simply carried the idea of\nlabor saving by cooperation into our musical service as into everything\nelse. There are a number of music rooms in the city, perfectly adapted\nacoustically to the different sorts of music. These halls are connected\nby telephone with all the houses of the city whose people care to pay\nthe small fee, and there are none, you may be sure, who do not. The\ncorps of musicians attached to each hall is so large that, although no\nindividual performer, or group of performers, has more than a brief\npart, each day's programme lasts through the twenty-four hours. There\nare on that card for to-day, as you will see if you observe closely,\ndistinct programmes of four of these concerts, each of a different\norder of music from the others, being now simultaneously performed, and\nany one of the four pieces now going on that you prefer, you can hear\nby merely pressing the button which will connect your house-wire with\nthe hall where it is being rendered. The programmes are so coordinated\nthat the pieces at any one time simultaneously proceeding in the\ndifferent halls usually offer a choice, not only between instrumental\nand vocal, and between different sorts of instruments; but also between\ndifferent motives from grave to gay, so that all tastes and moods can\nbe suited.\"\n\n\"It appears to me, Miss Leete,\" I said, \"that if we could have devised\nan arrangement for providing everybody with music in their homes,\nperfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every mood, and\nbeginning and ceasing at will, we should have considered the limit of\nhuman felicity already attained, and ceased to strive for further\nimprovements.\"\n\n\"I am sure I never could imagine how those among you who depended at\nall on music managed to endure the old-fashioned system for providing\nit,\" replied Edith. \"Music really worth hearing must have been, I\nsuppose, wholly out of the reach of the masses, and attainable by the\nmost favored only occasionally, at great trouble, prodigious expense,\nand then for brief periods, arbitrarily fixed by somebody else, and in\nconnection with all sorts of undesirable circumstances. Your concerts,\nfor instance, and operas! How perfectly exasperating it must have been,\nfor the sake of a piece or two of music that suited you, to have to sit\nfor hours listening to what you did not care for! Now, at a dinner one\ncan skip the courses one does not care for. Who would ever dine,\nhowever hungry, if required to eat everything brought on the table? and\nI am sure one's hearing is quite as sensitive as one's taste. I suppose\nit was these difficulties in the way of commanding really good music\nwhich made you endure so much playing and singing in your homes by\npeople who had only the rudiments of the art.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"it was that sort of music or none for most of us.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" Edith sighed, \"when one really considers, it is not so\nstrange that people in those days so often did not care for music. I\ndare say I should have detested it, too.\"\n\n\"Did I understand you rightly,\" I inquired, \"that this musical\nprogramme covers the entire twenty-four hours? It seems to on this\ncard, certainly; but who is there to listen to music between say\nmidnight and morning?\"\n\n\"Oh, many,\" Edith replied. \"Our people keep all hours; but if the music\nwere provided from midnight to morning for no others, it still would be\nfor the sleepless, the sick, and the dying. All our bedchambers have a\ntelephone attachment at the head of the bed by which any person who may\nbe sleepless can command music at pleasure, of the sort suited to the\nmood.\"\n\n\"Is there such an arrangement in the room assigned to me?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly; and how stupid, how very stupid, of me not to think to\ntell you of that last night! Father will show you about the adjustment\nbefore you go to bed to-night, however; and with the receiver at your\near, I am quite sure you will be able to snap your fingers at all sorts\nof uncanny feelings if they trouble you again.\"\n\nThat evening Dr. Leete asked us about our visit to the store, and in\nthe course of the desultory comparison of the ways of the nineteenth\ncentury and the twentieth, which followed, something raised the\nquestion of inheritance. \"I suppose,\" I said, \"the inheritance of\nproperty is not now allowed.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"there is no interference with\nit. In fact, you will find, Mr. West, as you come to know us, that\nthere is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty\nnowadays than you were accustomed to. We require, indeed, by law that\nevery man shall serve the nation for a fixed period, instead of leaving\nhim his choice, as you did, between working, stealing, or starving.\nWith the exception of this fundamental law, which is, indeed, merely a\ncodification of the law of nature--the edict of Eden--by which it is\nmade equal in its pressure on men, our system depends in no particular\nupon legislation, but is entirely voluntary, the logical outcome of the\noperation of human nature under rational conditions. This question of\ninheritance illustrates just that point. The fact that the nation is\nthe sole capitalist and land-owner of course restricts the individual's\npossessions to his annual credit, and what personal and household\nbelongings he may have procured with it. His credit, like an annuity in\nyour day, ceases on his death, with the allowance of a fixed sum for\nfuneral expenses. His other possessions he leaves as he pleases.\"\n\n\"What is to prevent, in course of time, such accumulations of valuable\ngoods and chattels in the hands of individuals as might seriously\ninterfere with equality in the circumstances of citizens?\" I asked.\n\n\"That matter arranges itself very simply,\" was the reply. \"Under the\npresent organization of society, accumulations of personal property are\nmerely burdensome the moment they exceed what adds to the real comfort.\nIn your day, if a man had a house crammed full with gold and silver\nplate, rare china, expensive furniture, and such things, he was\nconsidered rich, for these things represented money, and could at any\ntime be turned into it. Nowadays a man whom the legacies of a hundred\nrelatives, simultaneously dying, should place in a similar position,\nwould be considered very unlucky. The articles, not being salable,\nwould be of no value to him except for their actual use or the\nenjoyment of their beauty. On the other hand, his income remaining the\nsame, he would have to deplete his credit to hire houses to store the\ngoods in, and still further to pay for the service of those who took\ncare of them. You may be very sure that such a man would lose no time\nin scattering among his friends possessions which only made him the\npoorer, and that none of those friends would accept more of them than\nthey could easily spare room for and time to attend to. You see, then,\nthat to prohibit the inheritance of personal property with a view to\nprevent great accumulations would be a superfluous precaution for the\nnation. The individual citizen can be trusted to see that he is not\noverburdened. So careful is he in this respect, that the relatives\nusually waive claim to most of the effects of deceased friends,\nreserving only particular objects. The nation takes charge of the\nresigned chattels, and turns such as are of value into the common stock\nonce more.\"\n\n\"You spoke of paying for service to take care of your houses,\" said I;\n\"that suggests a question I have several times been on the point of\nasking. How have you disposed of the problem of domestic service? Who\nare willing to be domestic servants in a community where all are social\nequals? Our ladies found it hard enough to find such even when there\nwas little pretense of social equality.\"\n\n\"It is precisely because we are all social equals whose equality\nnothing can compromise, and because service is honorable, in a society\nwhose fundamental principle is that all in turn shall serve the rest,\nthat we could easily provide a corps of domestic servants such as you\nnever dreamed of, if we needed them,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"But we do not\nneed them.\"\n\n\"Who does your house-work, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"There is none to do,\" said Mrs. Leete, to whom I had addressed this\nquestion. \"Our washing is all done at public laundries at excessively\ncheap rates, and our cooking at public kitchens. The making and\nrepairing of all we wear are done outside in public shops. Electricity,\nof course, takes the place of all fires and lighting. We choose houses\nno larger than we need, and furnish them so as to involve the minimum\nof trouble to keep them in order. We have no use for domestic servants.\"\n\n\"The fact,\" said Dr. Leete, \"that you had in the poorer classes a\nboundless supply of serfs on whom you could impose all sorts of painful\nand disagreeable tasks, made you indifferent to devices to avoid the\nnecessity for them. But now that we all have to do in turn whatever\nwork is done for society, every individual in the nation has the same\ninterest, and a personal one, in devices for lightening the burden.\nThis fact has given a prodigious impulse to labor-saving inventions in\nall sorts of industry, of which the combination of the maximum of\ncomfort and minimum of trouble in household arrangements was one of the\nearliest results.\n\n\"In case of special emergencies in the household,\" pursued Dr. Leete,\n\"such as extensive cleaning or renovation, or sickness in the family,\nwe can always secure assistance from the industrial force.\"\n\n\"But how do you recompense these assistants, since you have no money?\"\n\n\"We do not pay them, of course, but the nation for them. Their services\ncan be obtained by application at the proper bureau, and their value is\npricked off the credit card of the applicant.\"\n\n\"What a paradise for womankind the world must be now!\" I exclaimed. \"In\nmy day, even wealth and unlimited servants did not enfranchise their\npossessors from household cares, while the women of the merely\nwell-to-do and poorer classes lived and died martyrs to them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Leete, \"I have read something of that; enough to\nconvince me that, badly off as the men, too, were in your day, they\nwere more fortunate than their mothers and wives.\"\n\n\"The broad shoulders of the nation,\" said Dr. Leete, \"bear now like a\nfeather the burden that broke the backs of the women of your day. Their\nmisery came, with all your other miseries, from that incapacity for\ncooperation which followed from the individualism on which your social\nsystem was founded, from your inability to perceive that you could make\nten times more profit out of your fellow men by uniting with them than\nby contending with them. The wonder is, not that you did not live more\ncomfortably, but that you were able to live together at all, who were\nall confessedly bent on making one another your servants, and securing\npossession of one another's goods.\n\n\"There, there, father, if you are so vehement, Mr. West will think you\nare scolding him,\" laughingly interposed Edith.\n\n\"When you want a doctor,\" I asked, \"do you simply apply to the proper\nbureau and take any one that may be sent?\"\n\n\"That rule would not work well in the case of physicians,\" replied Dr.\nLeete. \"The good a physician can do a patient depends largely on his\nacquaintance with his constitutional tendencies and condition. The\npatient must be able, therefore, to call in a particular doctor, and he\ndoes so just as patients did in your day. The only difference is that,\ninstead of collecting his fee for himself, the doctor collects it for\nthe nation by pricking off the amount, according to a regular scale for\nmedical attendance, from the patient's credit card.\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" I said, \"that if the fee is always the same, and a\ndoctor may not turn away patients, as I suppose he may not, the good\ndoctors are called constantly and the poor doctors left in idleness.\"\n\n\"In the first place, if you will overlook the apparent conceit of the\nremark from a retired physician,\" replied Dr. Leete, with a smile, \"we\nhave no poor doctors. Anybody who pleases to get a little smattering of\nmedical terms is not now at liberty to practice on the bodies of\ncitizens, as in your day. None but students who have passed the severe\ntests of the schools, and clearly proved their vocation, are permitted\nto practice. Then, too, you will observe that there is nowadays no\nattempt of doctors to build up their practice at the expense of other\ndoctors. There would be no motive for that. For the rest, the doctor\nhas to render regular reports of his work to the medical bureau, and if\nhe is not reasonably well employed, work is found for him.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nThe questions which I needed to ask before I could acquire even an\noutline acquaintance with the institutions of the twentieth century\nbeing endless, and Dr. Leete's good-nature appearing equally so, we sat\nup talking for several hours after the ladies left us. Reminding my\nhost of the point at which our talk had broken off that morning, I\nexpressed my curiosity to learn how the organization of the industrial\narmy was made to afford a sufficient stimulus to diligence in the lack\nof any anxiety on the worker's part as to his livelihood.\n\n\"You must understand in the first place,\" replied the doctor, \"that the\nsupply of incentives to effort is but one of the objects sought in the\norganization we have adopted for the army. The other, and equally\nimportant, is to secure for the file-leaders and captains of the force,\nand the great officers of the nation, men of proven abilities, who are\npledged by their own careers to hold their followers up to their\nhighest standard of performance and permit no lagging. With a view to\nthese two ends the industrial army is organized. First comes the\nunclassified grade of common laborers, men of all work, to which all\nrecruits during their first three years belong. This grade is a sort of\nschool, and a very strict one, in which the young men are taught habits\nof obedience, subordination, and devotion to duty. While the\nmiscellaneous nature of the work done by this force prevents the\nsystematic grading of the workers which is afterwards possible, yet\nindividual records are kept, and excellence receives distinction\ncorresponding with the penalties that negligence incurs. It is not,\nhowever, policy with us to permit youthful recklessness or\nindiscretion, when not deeply culpable, to handicap the future careers\nof young men, and all who have passed through the unclassified grade\nwithout serious disgrace have an equal opportunity to choose the life\nemployment they have most liking for. Having selected this, they enter\nupon it as apprentices. The length of the apprenticeship naturally\ndiffers in different occupations. At the end of it the apprentice\nbecomes a full workman, and a member of his trade or guild. Now not\nonly are the individual records of the apprentices for ability and\nindustry strictly kept, and excellence distinguished by suitable\ndistinctions, but upon the average of his record during apprenticeship\nthe standing given the apprentice among the full workmen depends.\n\n\"While the internal organizations of different industries, mechanical\nand agricultural, differ according to their peculiar conditions, they\nagree in a general division of their workers into first, second, and\nthird grades, according to ability, and these grades are in many cases\nsubdivided into first and second classes. According to his standing as\nan apprentice a young man is assigned his place as a first, second, or\nthird grade worker. Of course only men of unusual ability pass directly\nfrom apprenticeship into the first grade of the workers. The most fall\ninto the lower grades, working up as they grow more experienced, at the\nperiodical regradings. These regradings take place in each industry at\nintervals corresponding with the length of the apprenticeship to that\nindustry, so that merit never need wait long to rise, nor can any rest\non past achievements unless they would drop into a lower rank. One of\nthe notable advantages of a high grading is the privilege it gives the\nworker in electing which of the various branches or processes of his\nindustry he will follow as his specialty. Of course it is not intended\nthat any of these processes shall be disproportionately arduous, but\nthere is often much difference between them, and the privilege of\nelection is accordingly highly prized. So far as possible, indeed, the\npreferences even of the poorest workmen are considered in assigning\nthem their line of work, because not only their happiness but their\nusefulness is thus enhanced. While, however, the wish of the lower\ngrade man is consulted so far as the exigencies of the service permit,\nhe is considered only after the upper grade men have been provided for,\nand often he has to put up with second or third choice, or even with an\narbitrary assignment when help is needed. This privilege of election\nattends every regrading, and when a man loses his grade he also risks\nhaving to exchange the sort of work he likes for some other less to his\ntaste. The results of each regrading, giving the standing of every man\nin his industry, are gazetted in the public prints, and those who have\nwon promotion since the last regrading receive the nation's thanks and\nare publicly invested with the badge of their new rank.\"\n\n\"What may this badge be?\" I asked.\n\n\"Every industry has its emblematic device,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"and\nthis, in the shape of a metallic badge so small that you might not see\nit unless you knew where to look, is all the insignia which the men of\nthe army wear, except where public convenience demands a distinctive\nuniform. This badge is the same in form for all grades of industry, but\nwhile the badge of the third grade is iron, that of the second grade is\nsilver, and that of the first is gilt.\n\n\"Apart from the grand incentive to endeavor afforded by the fact that\nthe high places in the nation are open only to the highest class men,\nand that rank in the army constitutes the only mode of social\ndistinction for the vast majority who are not aspirants in art,\nliterature, and the professions, various incitements of a minor, but\nperhaps equally effective, sort are provided in the form of special\nprivileges and immunities in the way of discipline, which the superior\nclass men enjoy. These, while intended to be as little as possible\ninvidious to the less successful, have the effect of keeping constantly\nbefore every man's mind the great desirability of attaining the grade\nnext above his own.\n\n\"It is obviously important that not only the good but also the\nindifferent and poor workmen should be able to cherish the ambition of\nrising. Indeed, the number of the latter being so much greater, it is\neven more essential that the ranking system should not operate to\ndiscourage them than that it should stimulate the others. It is to this\nend that the grades are divided into classes. The grades as well as the\nclasses being made numerically equal at each regrading, there is not at\nany time, counting out the officers and the unclassified and apprentice\ngrades, over one-ninth of the industrial army in the lowest class, and\nmost of this number are recent apprentices, all of whom expect to rise.\nThose who remain during the entire term of service in the lowest class\nare but a trifling fraction of the industrial army, and likely to be as\ndeficient in sensibility to their position as in ability to better it.\n\n\"It is not even necessary that a worker should win promotion to a\nhigher grade to have at least a taste of glory. While promotion\nrequires a general excellence of record as a worker, honorable mention\nand various sorts of prizes are awarded for excellence less than\nsufficient for promotion, and also for special feats and single\nperformances in the various industries. There are many minor\ndistinctions of standing, not only within the grades but within the\nclasses, each of which acts as a spur to the efforts of a group. It is\nintended that no form of merit shall wholly fail of recognition.\n\n\"As for actual neglect of work positively bad work, or other overt\nremissness on the part of men incapable of generous motives, the\ndiscipline of the industrial army is far too strict to allow anything\nwhatever of the sort. A man able to do duty, and persistently refusing,\nis sentenced to solitary imprisonment on bread and water till he\nconsents.\n\n\"The lowest grade of the officers of the industrial army, that of\nassistant foremen or lieutenants, is appointed out of men who have held\ntheir place for two years in the first class of the first grade. Where\nthis leaves too large a range of choice, only the first group of this\nclass are eligible. No one thus comes to the point of commanding men\nuntil he is about thirty years old. After a man becomes an officer, his\nrating of course no longer depends on the efficiency of his own work,\nbut on that of his men. The foremen are appointed from among the\nassistant foremen, by the same exercise of discretion limited to a\nsmall eligible class. In the appointments to the still higher grades\nanother principle is introduced, which it would take too much time to\nexplain now.\n\n\"Of course such a system of grading as I have described would have been\nimpracticable applied to the small industrial concerns of your day, in\nsome of which there were hardly enough employees to have left one\napiece for the classes. You must remember that, under the national\norganization of labor, all industries are carried on by great bodies of\nmen, many of your farms or shops being combined as one. It is also\nowing solely to the vast scale on which each industry is organized,\nwith co-ordinate establishments in every part of the country, that we\nare able by exchanges and transfers to fit every man so nearly with the\nsort of work he can do best.\n\n\"And now, Mr. West, I will leave it to you, on the bare outline of its\nfeatures which I have given, if those who need special incentives to do\ntheir best are likely to lack them under our system. Does it not seem\nto you that men who found themselves obliged, whether they wished or\nnot, to work, would under such a system be strongly impelled to do\ntheir best?\"\n\nI replied that it seemed to me the incentives offered were, if any\nobjection were to be made, too strong; that the pace set for the young\nmen was too hot; and such, indeed, I would add with deference, still\nremains my opinion, now that by longer residence among you I become\nbetter acquainted with the whole subject.\n\nDr. Leete, however, desired me to reflect, and I am ready to say that\nit is perhaps a sufficient reply to my objection, that the worker's\nlivelihood is in no way dependent on his ranking, and anxiety for that\nnever embitters his disappointments; that the working hours are short,\nthe vacations regular, and that all emulation ceases at forty-five,\nwith the attainment of middle life.\n\n\"There are two or three other points I ought to refer to,\" he added,\n\"to prevent your getting mistaken impressions. In the first place, you\nmust understand that this system of preferment given the more efficient\nworkers over the less so, in no way contravenes the fundamental idea of\nour social system, that all who do their best are equally deserving,\nwhether that best be great or small. I have shown that the system is\narranged to encourage the weaker as well as the stronger with the hope\nof rising, while the fact that the stronger are selected for the\nleaders is in no way a reflection upon the weaker, but in the interest\nof the common weal.\n\n\"Do not imagine, either, because emulation is given free play as an\nincentive under our system, that we deem it a motive likely to appeal\nto the nobler sort of men, or worthy of them. Such as these find their\nmotives within, not without, and measure their duty by their own\nendowments, not by those of others. So long as their achievement is\nproportioned to their powers, they would consider it preposterous to\nexpect praise or blame because it chanced to be great or small. To such\nnatures emulation appears philosophically absurd, and despicable in a\nmoral aspect by its substitution of envy for admiration, and exultation\nfor regret, in one's attitude toward the successes and the failures of\nothers.\n\n\"But all men, even in the last year of the twentieth century, are not\nof this high order, and the incentives to endeavor requisite for those\nwho are not must be of a sort adapted to their inferior natures. For\nthese, then, emulation of the keenest edge is provided as a constant\nspur. Those who need this motive will feel it. Those who are above its\ninfluence do not need it.\n\n\"I should not fail to mention,\" resumed the doctor, \"that for those too\ndeficient in mental or bodily strength to be fairly graded with the\nmain body of workers, we have a separate grade, unconnected with the\nothers,--a sort of invalid corps, the members of which are provided\nwith a light class of tasks fitted to their strength. All our sick in\nmind and body, all our deaf and dumb, and lame and blind and crippled,\nand even our insane, belong to this invalid corps, and bear its\ninsignia. The strongest often do nearly a man's work, the feeblest, of\ncourse, nothing; but none who can do anything are willing quite to give\nup. In their lucid intervals, even our insane are eager to do what they\ncan.\"\n\n\"That is a pretty idea of the invalid corps,\" I said. \"Even a barbarian\nfrom the nineteenth century can appreciate that. It is a very graceful\nway of disguising charity, and must be grateful to the feelings of its\nrecipients.\"\n\n\"Charity!\" repeated Dr. Leete. \"Did you suppose that we consider the\nincapable class we are talking of objects of charity?\"\n\n\"Why, naturally,\" I said, \"inasmuch as they are incapable of\nself-support.\"\n\nBut here the doctor took me up quickly.\n\n\"Who is capable of self-support?\" he demanded. \"There is no such thing\nin a civilized society as self-support. In a state of society so\nbarbarous as not even to know family cooperation, each individual may\npossibly support himself, though even then for a part of his life only;\nbut from the moment that men begin to live together, and constitute\neven the rudest sort of society, self-support becomes impossible. As\nmen grow more civilized, and the subdivision of occupations and\nservices is carried out, a complex mutual dependence becomes the\nuniversal rule. Every man, however solitary may seem his occupation, is\na member of a vast industrial partnership, as large as the nation, as\nlarge as humanity. The necessity of mutual dependence should imply the\nduty and guarantee of mutual support; and that it did not in your day\nconstituted the essential cruelty and unreason of your system.\"\n\n\"That may all be so,\" I replied, \"but it does not touch the case of\nthose who are unable to contribute anything to the product of industry.\"\n\n\"Surely I told you this morning, at least I thought I did,\" replied Dr.\nLeete, \"that the right of a man to maintenance at the nation's table\ndepends on the fact that he is a man, and not on the amount of health\nand strength he may have, so long as he does his best.\"\n\n\"You said so,\" I answered, \"but I supposed the rule applied only to the\nworkers of different ability. Does it also hold of those who can do\nnothing at all?\"\n\n\"Are they not also men?\"\n\n\"I am to understand, then, that the lame, the blind, the sick, and the\nimpotent, are as well off as the most efficient and have the same\nincome?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" was the reply.\n\n\"The idea of charity on such a scale,\" I answered, \"would have made our\nmost enthusiastic philanthropists gasp.\"\n\n\"If you had a sick brother at home,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"unable to\nwork, would you feed him on less dainty food, and lodge and clothe him\nmore poorly, than yourself? More likely far, you would give him the\npreference; nor would you think of calling it charity. Would not the\nword, in that connection, fill you with indignation?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied; \"but the cases are not parallel. There is a\nsense, no doubt, in which all men are brothers; but this general sort\nof brotherhood is not to be compared, except for rhetorical purposes,\nto the brotherhood of blood, either as to its sentiment or its\nobligations.\"\n\n\"There speaks the nineteenth century!\" exclaimed Dr. Leete. \"Ah, Mr.\nWest, there is no doubt as to the length of time that you slept. If I\nwere to give you, in one sentence, a key to what may seem the mysteries\nof our civilization as compared with that of your age, I should say\nthat it is the fact that the solidarity of the race and the brotherhood\nof man, which to you were but fine phrases, are, to our thinking and\nfeeling, ties as real and as vital as physical fraternity.\n\n\"But even setting that consideration aside, I do not see why it so\nsurprises you that those who cannot work are conceded the full right to\nlive on the produce of those who can. Even in your day, the duty of\nmilitary service for the protection of the nation, to which our\nindustrial service corresponds, while obligatory on those able to\ndischarge it, did not operate to deprive of the privileges of\ncitizenship those who were unable. They stayed at home, and were\nprotected by those who fought, and nobody questioned their right to be,\nor thought less of them. So, now, the requirement of industrial service\nfrom those able to render it does not operate to deprive of the\nprivileges of citizenship, which now implies the citizen's maintenance,\nhim who cannot work. The worker is not a citizen because he works, but\nworks because he is a citizen. As you recognize the duty of the strong\nto fight for the weak, we, now that fighting is gone by, recognize his\nduty to work for him.\n\n\"A solution which leaves an unaccounted-for residuum is no solution at\nall; and our solution of the problem of human society would have been\nnone at all had it left the lame, the sick, and the blind outside with\nthe beasts, to fare as they might. Better far have left the strong and\nwell unprovided for than these burdened ones, toward whom every heart\nmust yearn, and for whom ease of mind and body should be provided, if\nfor no others. Therefore it is, as I told you this morning, that the\ntitle of every man, woman, and child to the means of existence rests on\nno basis less plain, broad, and simple than the fact that they are\nfellows of one race-members of one human family. The only coin current\nis the image of God, and that is good for all we have.\n\n\"I think there is no feature of the civilization of your epoch so\nrepugnant to modern ideas as the neglect with which you treated your\ndependent classes. Even if you had no pity, no feeling of brotherhood,\nhow was it that you did not see that you were robbing the incapable\nclass of their plain right in leaving them unprovided for?\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow you there,\" I said. \"I admit the claim of this\nclass to our pity, but how could they who produced nothing claim a\nshare of the product as a right?\"\n\n\"How happened it,\" was Dr. Leete's reply, \"that your workers were able\nto produce more than so many savages would have done? Was it not wholly\non account of the heritage of the past knowledge and achievements of\nthe race, the machinery of society, thousands of years in contriving,\nfound by you ready-made to your hand? How did you come to be possessors\nof this knowledge and this machinery, which represent nine parts to one\ncontributed by yourself in the value of your product? You inherited it,\ndid you not? And were not these others, these unfortunate and crippled\nbrothers whom you cast out, joint inheritors, co-heirs with you? What\ndid you do with their share? Did you not rob them when you put them off\nwith crusts, who were entitled to sit with the heirs, and did you not\nadd insult to robbery when you called the crusts charity?\n\n\"Ah, Mr. West,\" Dr. Leete continued, as I did not respond, \"what I do\nnot understand is, setting aside all considerations either of justice\nor brotherly feeling toward the crippled and defective, how the workers\nof your day could have had any heart for their work, knowing that their\nchildren, or grand-children, if unfortunate, would be deprived of the\ncomforts and even necessities of life. It is a mystery how men with\nchildren could favor a system under which they were rewarded beyond\nthose less endowed with bodily strength or mental power. For, by the\nsame discrimination by which the father profited, the son, for whom he\nwould give his life, being perchance weaker than others, might be\nreduced to crusts and beggary. How men dared leave children behind\nthem, I have never been able to understand.\"\n\nNote.--Although in his talk on the previous evening Dr. Leete had\nemphasized the pains taken to enable every man to ascertain and follow\nhis natural bent in choosing an occupation, it was not till I learned\nthat the worker's income is the same in all occupations that I realized\nhow absolutely he may be counted on to do so, and thus, by selecting\nthe harness which sets most lightly on himself, find that in which he\ncan pull best. The failure of my age in any systematic or effective way\nto develop and utilize the natural aptitudes of men for the industries\nand intellectual avocations was one of the great wastes, as well as one\nof the most common causes of unhappiness in that time. The vast\nmajority of my contemporaries, though nominally free to do so, never\nreally chose their occupations at all, but were forced by circumstances\ninto work for which they were relatively inefficient, because not\nnaturally fitted for it. The rich, in this respect, had little\nadvantage over the poor. The latter, indeed, being generally deprived\nof education, had no opportunity even to ascertain the natural\naptitudes they might have, and on account of their poverty were unable\nto develop them by cultivation even when ascertained. The liberal and\ntechnical professions, except by favorable accident, were shut to them,\nto their own great loss and that of the nation. On the other hand, the\nwell-to-do, although they could command education and opportunity, were\nscarcely less hampered by social prejudice, which forbade them to\npursue manual avocations, even when adapted to them, and destined them,\nwhether fit or unfit, to the professions, thus wasting many an\nexcellent handicraftsman. Mercenary considerations, tempting men to\npursue money-making occupations for which they were unfit, instead of\nless remunerative employments for which they were fit, were responsible\nfor another vast perversion of talent. All these things now are\nchanged. Equal education and opportunity must needs bring to light\nwhatever aptitudes a man has, and neither social prejudices nor\nmercenary considerations hamper him in the choice of his life work.\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\nAs Edith had promised he should do, Dr. Leete accompanied me to my\nbedroom when I retired, to instruct me as to the adjustment of the\nmusical telephone. He showed how, by turning a screw, the volume of the\nmusic could be made to fill the room, or die away to an echo so faint\nand far that one could scarcely be sure whether he heard or imagined\nit. If, of two persons side by side, one desired to listen to music and\nthe other to sleep, it could be made audible to one and inaudible to\nanother.\n\n\"I should strongly advise you to sleep if you can to-night, Mr. West,\nin preference to listening to the finest tunes in the world,\" the\ndoctor said, after explaining these points. \"In the trying experience\nyou are just now passing through, sleep is a nerve tonic for which\nthere is no substitute.\"\n\nMindful of what had happened to me that very morning, I promised to\nheed his counsel.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"then I will set the telephone at eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nHe explained that, by a clock-work combination, a person could arrange\nto be awakened at any hour by the music.\n\nIt began to appear, as has since fully proved to be the case, that I\nhad left my tendency to insomnia behind me with the other discomforts\nof existence in the nineteenth century; for though I took no sleeping\ndraught this time, yet, as the night before, I had no sooner touched\nthe pillow than I was asleep.\n\nI dreamed that I sat on the throne of the Abencerrages in the\nbanqueting hall of the Alhambra, feasting my lords and generals, who\nnext day were to follow the crescent against the Christian dogs of\nSpain. The air, cooled by the spray of fountains, was heavy with the\nscent of flowers. A band of Nautch girls, round-limbed and\nluscious-lipped, danced with voluptuous grace to the music of brazen\nand stringed instruments. Looking up to the latticed galleries, one\ncaught a gleam now and then from the eye of some beauty of the royal\nharem, looking down upon the assembled flower of Moorish chivalry.\nLouder and louder clashed the cymbals, wilder and wilder grew the\nstrain, till the blood of the desert race could no longer resist the\nmartial delirium, and the swart nobles leaped to their feet; a thousand\nscimetars were bared, and the cry, \"Allah il Allah!\" shook the hall and\nawoke me, to find it broad daylight, and the room tingling with the\nelectric music of the \"Turkish Reveille.\"\n\nAt the breakfast-table, when I told my host of my morning's experience,\nI learned that it was not a mere chance that the piece of music which\nawakened me was a reveille. The airs played at one of the halls during\nthe waking hours of the morning were always of an inspiring type.\n\n\"By the way,\" I said, \"I have not thought to ask you anything about the\nstate of Europe. Have the societies of the Old World also been\nremodeled?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"the great nations of Europe as well as\nAustralia, Mexico, and parts of South America, are now organized\nindustrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the\nevolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a\nloose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international\ncouncil regulates the mutual intercourse and commerce of the members of\nthe union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which\nare gradually being educated up to civilized institutions. Complete\nautonomy within its own limits is enjoyed by every nation.\"\n\n\"How do you carry on commerce without money?\" I said. \"In trading with\nother nations, you must use some sort of money, although you dispense\nwith it in the internal affairs of the nation.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; money is as superfluous in our foreign as in our internal\nrelations. When foreign commerce was conducted by private enterprise,\nmoney was necessary to adjust it on account of the multifarious\ncomplexity of the transactions; but nowadays it is a function of the\nnations as units. There are thus only a dozen or so merchants in the\nworld, and their business being supervised by the international\ncouncil, a simple system of book accounts serves perfectly to regulate\ntheir dealings. Customs duties of every sort are of course superfluous.\nA nation simply does not import what its government does not think\nrequisite for the general interest. Each nation has a bureau of foreign\nexchange, which manages its trading. For example, the American bureau,\nestimating such and such quantities of French goods necessary to\nAmerica for a given year, sends the order to the French bureau, which\nin turn sends its order to our bureau. The same is done mutually by all\nthe nations.\"\n\n\"But how are the prices of foreign goods settled, since there is no\ncompetition?\"\n\n\"The price at which one nation supplies another with goods,\" replied\nDr. Leete, \"must be that at which it supplies its own citizens. So you\nsee there is no danger of misunderstanding. Of course no nation is\ntheoretically bound to supply another with the product of its own\nlabor, but it is for the interest of all to exchange some commodities.\nIf a nation is regularly supplying another with certain goods, notice\nis required from either side of any important change in the relation.\"\n\n\"But what if a nation, having a monopoly of some natural product,\nshould refuse to supply it to the others, or to one of them?\"\n\n\"Such a case has never occurred, and could not without doing the\nrefusing party vastly more harm than the others,\" replied Dr. Leete.\n\"In the fist place, no favoritism could be legally shown. The law\nrequires that each nation shall deal with the others, in all respects,\non exactly the same footing. Such a course as you suggest would cut off\nthe nation adopting it from the remainder of the earth for all purposes\nwhatever. The contingency is one that need not give us much anxiety.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"supposing a nation, having a natural monopoly in some\nproduct of which it exports more than it consumes, should put the price\naway up, and thus, without cutting off the supply, make a profit out of\nits neighbors' necessities? Its own citizens would of course have to\npay the higher price on that commodity, but as a body would make more\nout of foreigners than they would be out of pocket themselves.\"\n\n\"When you come to know how prices of all commodities are determined\nnowadays, you will perceive how impossible it is that they could be\naltered, except with reference to the amount or arduousness of the work\nrequired respectively to produce them,\" was Dr. Leete's reply. \"This\nprinciple is an international as well as a national guarantee; but even\nwithout it the sense of community of interest, international as well as\nnational, and the conviction of the folly of selfishness, are too deep\nnowadays to render possible such a piece of sharp practice as you\napprehend. You must understand that we all look forward to an eventual\nunification of the world as one nation. That, no doubt, will be the\nultimate form of society, and will realize certain economic advantages\nover the present federal system of autonomous nations. Meanwhile,\nhowever, the present system works so nearly perfectly that we are quite\ncontent to leave to posterity the completion of the scheme. There are,\nindeed, some who hold that it never will be completed, on the ground\nthat the federal plan is not merely a provisional solution of the\nproblem of human society, but the best ultimate solution.\"\n\n\"How do you manage,\" I asked, \"when the books of any two nations do not\nbalance? Supposing we import more from France than we export to her.\"\n\n\"At the end of each year,\" replied the doctor, \"the books of every\nnation are examined. If France is found in our debt, probably we are in\nthe debt of some nation which owes France, and so on with all the\nnations. The balances that remain after the accounts have been cleared\nby the international council should not be large under our system.\nWhatever they may be, the council requires them to be settled every few\nyears, and may require their settlement at any time if they are getting\ntoo large; for it is not intended that any nation shall run largely in\ndebt to another, lest feelings unfavorable to amity should be\nengendered. To guard further against this, the international council\ninspects the commodities interchanged by the nations, to see that they\nare of perfect quality.\"\n\n\"But what are the balances finally settled with, seeing that you have\nno money?\"\n\n\"In national staples; a basis of agreement as to what staples shall be\naccepted, and in what proportions, for settlement of accounts, being a\npreliminary to trade relations.\"\n\n\"Emigration is another point I want to ask you about,\" said I. \"With\nevery nation organized as a close industrial partnership, monopolizing\nall means of production in the country, the emigrant, even if he were\npermitted to land, would starve. I suppose there is no emigration\nnowadays.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, there is constant emigration, by which I suppose you\nmean removal to foreign countries for permanent residence,\" replied Dr.\nLeete. \"It is arranged on a simple international arrangement of\nindemnities. For example, if a man at twenty-one emigrates from England\nto America, England loses all the expense of his maintenance and\neducation, and America gets a workman for nothing. America accordingly\nmakes England an allowance. The same principle, varied to suit the\ncase, applies generally. If the man is near the term of his labor when\nhe emigrates, the country receiving him has the allowance. As to\nimbecile persons, it is deemed best that each nation should be\nresponsible for its own, and the emigration of such must be under full\nguarantees of support by his own nation. Subject to these regulations,\nthe right of any man to emigrate at any time is unrestricted.\"\n\n\"But how about mere pleasure trips; tours of observation? How can a\nstranger travel in a country whose people do not receive money, and are\nthemselves supplied with the means of life on a basis not extended to\nhim? His own credit card cannot, of course, be good in other lands. How\ndoes he pay his way?\"\n\n\"An American credit card,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"is just as good in\nEurope as American gold used to be, and on precisely the same\ncondition, namely, that it be exchanged into the currency of the\ncountry you are traveling in. An American in Berlin takes his credit\ncard to the local office of the international council, and receives in\nexchange for the whole or part of it a German credit card, the amount\nbeing charged against the United States in favor of Germany on the\ninternational account.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. West would like to dine at the Elephant to-day,\" said\nEdith, as we left the table.\n\n\"That is the name we give to the general dining-house in our ward,\"\nexplained her father. \"Not only is our cooking done at the public\nkitchens, as I told you last night, but the service and quality of the\nmeals are much more satisfactory if taken at the dining-house. The two\nminor meals of the day are usually taken at home, as not worth the\ntrouble of going out; but it is general to go out to dine. We have not\ndone so since you have been with us, from a notion that it would be\nbetter to wait till you had become a little more familiar with our\nways. What do you think? Shall we take dinner at the dining-house\nto-day?\"\n\nI said that I should be very much pleased to do so.\n\nNot long after, Edith came to me, smiling, and said:\n\n\"Last night, as I was thinking what I could do to make you feel at home\nuntil you came to be a little more used to us and our ways, an idea\noccurred to me. What would you say if I were to introduce you to some\nvery nice people of your own times, whom I am sure you used to be well\nacquainted with?\"\n\nI replied, rather vaguely, that it would certainly be very agreeable,\nbut I did not see how she was going to manage it.\n\n\"Come with me,\" was her smiling reply, \"and see if I am not as good as\nmy word.\"\n\nMy susceptibility to surprise had been pretty well exhausted by the\nnumerous shocks it had received, but it was with some wonderment that I\nfollowed her into a room which I had not before entered. It was a\nsmall, cosy apartment, walled with cases filled with books.\n\n\"Here are your friends,\" said Edith, indicating one of the cases, and\nas my eye glanced over the names on the backs of the volumes,\nShakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, Defoe, Dickens,\nThackeray, Hugo, Hawthorne, Irving, and a score of other great writers\nof my time and all time, I understood her meaning. She had indeed made\ngood her promise in a sense compared with which its literal fulfillment\nwould have been a disappointment. She had introduced me to a circle of\nfriends whom the century that had elapsed since last I communed with\nthem had aged as little as it had myself. Their spirit was as high,\ntheir wit as keen, their laughter and their tears as contagious, as\nwhen their speech had whiled away the hours of a former century. Lonely\nI was not and could not be more, with this goodly companionship,\nhowever wide the gulf of years that gaped between me and my old life.\n\n\"You are glad I brought you here,\" exclaimed Edith, radiant, as she\nread in my face the success of her experiment. \"It was a good idea, was\nit not, Mr. West? How stupid in me not to think of it before! I will\nleave you now with your old friends, for I know there will be no\ncompany for you like them just now; but remember you must not let old\nfriends make you quite forget new ones!\" and with that smiling caution\nshe left me.\n\nAttracted by the most familiar of the names before me, I laid my hand\non a volume of Dickens, and sat down to read. He had been my prime\nfavorite among the bookwriters of the century,--I mean the nineteenth\ncentury,--and a week had rarely passed in my old life during which I\nhad not taken up some volume of his works to while away an idle hour.\nAny volume with which I had been familiar would have produced an\nextraordinary impression, read under my present circumstances, but my\nexceptional familiarity with Dickens, and his consequent power to call\nup the associations of my former life, gave to his writings an effect\nno others could have had, to intensify, by force of contrast, my\nappreciation of the strangeness of my present environment. However new\nand astonishing one's surroundings, the tendency is to become a part of\nthem so soon that almost from the first the power to see them\nobjectively and fully measure their strangeness, is lost. That power,\nalready dulled in my case, the pages of Dickens restored by carrying me\nback through their associations to the standpoint of my former life.\n\nWith a clearness which I had not been able before to attain, I saw now\nthe past and present, like contrasting pictures, side by side.\n\nThe genius of the great novelist of the nineteenth century, like that\nof Homer, might indeed defy time; but the setting of his pathetic\ntales, the misery of the poor, the wrongs of power, the pitiless\ncruelty of the system of society, had passed away as utterly as Circe\nand the sirens, Charybdis and Cyclops.\n\nDuring the hour or two that I sat there with Dickens open before me, I\ndid not actually read more than a couple of pages. Every paragraph,\nevery phrase, brought up some new aspect of the world-transformation\nwhich had taken place, and led my thoughts on long and widely ramifying\nexcursions. As meditating thus in Dr. Leete's library I gradually\nattained a more clear and coherent idea of the prodigious spectacle\nwhich I had been so strangely enabled to view, I was filled with a\ndeepening wonder at the seeming capriciousness of the fate that had\ngiven to one who so little deserved it, or seemed in any way set apart\nfor it, the power alone among his contemporaries to stand upon the\nearth in this latter day. I had neither foreseen the new world nor\ntoiled for it, as many about me had done regardless of the scorn of\nfools or the misconstruction of the good. Surely it would have been\nmore in accordance with the fitness of things had one of those\nprophetic and strenuous souls been enabled to see the travail of his\nsoul and be satisfied; he, for example, a thousand times rather than I,\nwho, having beheld in a vision the world I looked on, sang of it in\nwords that again and again, during these last wondrous days, had rung\nin my mind:\n\n  For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,\n  Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be\n  Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furled.\n  In the Parliament of man, the federation of the world.\n\n  Then the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,\n  And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.\n  For I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,\n  And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.\n\n\nWhat though, in his old age, he momentarily lost faith in his own\nprediction, as prophets in their hours of depression and doubt\ngenerally do; the words had remained eternal testimony to the seership\nof a poet's heart, the insight that is given to faith.\n\nI was still in the library when some hours later Dr. Leete sought me\nthere. \"Edith told me of her idea,\" he said, \"and I thought it an\nexcellent one. I had a little curiosity what writer you would first\nturn to. Ah, Dickens! You admired him, then! That is where we moderns\nagree with you. Judged by our standards, he overtops all the writers of\nhis age, not because his literary genius was highest, but because his\ngreat heart beat for the poor, because he made the cause of the victims\nof society his own, and devoted his pen to exposing its cruelties and\nshams. No man of his time did so much as he to turn men's minds to the\nwrong and wretchedness of the old order of things, and open their eyes\nto the necessity of the great change that was coming, although he\nhimself did not clearly foresee it.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nA heavy rainstorm came up during the day, and I had concluded that the\ncondition of the streets would be such that my hosts would have to give\nup the idea of going out to dinner, although the dining-hall I had\nunderstood to be quite near. I was much surprised when at the dinner\nhour the ladies appeared prepared to go out, but without either rubbers\nor umbrellas.\n\nThe mystery was explained when we found ourselves on the street, for a\ncontinuous waterproof covering had been let down so as to inclose the\nsidewalk and turn it into a well lighted and perfectly dry corridor,\nwhich was filled with a stream of ladies and gentlemen dressed for\ndinner. At the comers the entire open space was similarly roofed in.\nEdith Leete, with whom I walked, seemed much interested in learning\nwhat appeared to be entirely new to her, that in the stormy weather the\nstreets of the Boston of my day had been impassable, except to persons\nprotected by umbrellas, boots, and heavy clothing. \"Were sidewalk\ncoverings not used at all?\" she asked. They were used, I explained, but\nin a scattered and utterly unsystematic way, being private enterprises.\nShe said to me that at the present time all the streets were provided\nagainst inclement weather in the manner I saw, the apparatus being\nrolled out of the way when it was unnecessary. She intimated that it\nwould be considered an extraordinary imbecility to permit the weather\nto have any effect on the social movements of the people.\n\nDr. Leete, who was walking ahead, overhearing something of our talk,\nturned to say that the difference between the age of individualism and\nthat of concert was well characterized by the fact that, in the\nnineteenth century, when it rained, the people of Boston put up three\nhundred thousand umbrellas over as many heads, and in the twentieth\ncentury they put up one umbrella over all the heads.\n\nAs we walked on, Edith said, \"The private umbrella is father's favorite\nfigure to illustrate the old way when everybody lived for himself and\nhis family. There is a nineteenth century painting at the Art Gallery\nrepresenting a crowd of people in the rain, each one holding his\numbrella over himself and his wife, and giving his neighbors the\ndrippings, which he claims must have been meant by the artist as a\nsatire on his times.\"\n\nWe now entered a large building into which a stream of people was\npouring. I could not see the front, owing to the awning, but, if in\ncorrespondence with the interior, which was even finer than the store I\nvisited the day before, it would have been magnificent. My companion\nsaid that the sculptured group over the entrance was especially\nadmired. Going up a grand staircase we walked some distance along a\nbroad corridor with many doors opening upon it. At one of these, which\nbore my host's name, we turned in, and I found myself in an elegant\ndining-room containing a table for four. Windows opened on a courtyard\nwhere a fountain played to a great height and music made the air\nelectric.\n\n\"You seem at home here,\" I said, as we seated ourselves at table, and\nDr. Leete touched an annunciator.\n\n\"This is, in fact, a part of our house, slightly detached from the\nrest,\" he replied. \"Every family in the ward has a room set apart in\nthis great building for its permanent and exclusive use for a small\nannual rental. For transient guests and individuals there is\naccommodation on another floor. If we expect to dine here, we put in\nour orders the night before, selecting anything in market, according to\nthe daily reports in the papers. The meal is as expensive or as simple\nas we please, though of course everything is vastly cheaper as well as\nbetter than it would be prepared at home. There is actually nothing\nwhich our people take more interest in than the perfection of the\ncatering and cooking done for them, and I admit that we are a little\nvain of the success that has been attained by this branch of the\nservice. Ah, my dear Mr. West, though other aspects of your\ncivilization were more tragical, I can imagine that none could have\nbeen more depressing than the poor dinners you had to eat, that is, all\nof you who had not great wealth.\"\n\n\"You would have found none of us disposed to disagree with you on that\npoint,\" I said.\n\nThe waiter, a fine-looking young fellow, wearing a slightly distinctive\nuniform, now made his appearance. I observed him closely, as it was the\nfirst time I had been able to study particularly the bearing of one of\nthe enlisted members of the industrial army. This young man, I knew\nfrom what I had been told, must be highly educated, and the equal,\nsocially and in all respects, of those he served. But it was perfectly\nevident that to neither side was the situation in the slightest degree\nembarrassing. Dr. Leete addressed the young man in a tone devoid, of\ncourse, as any gentleman's would be, of superciliousness, but at the\nsame time not in any way deprecatory, while the manner of the young man\nwas simply that of a person intent on discharging correctly the task he\nwas engaged in, equally without familiarity or obsequiousness. It was,\nin fact, the manner of a soldier on duty, but without the military\nstiffness. As the youth left the room, I said, \"I cannot get over my\nwonder at seeing a young man like that serving so contentedly in a\nmenial position.\"\n\n\"What is that word 'menial'? I never heard it,\" said Edith.\n\n\"It is obsolete now,\" remarked her father. \"If I understand it rightly,\nit applied to persons who performed particularly disagreeable and\nunpleasant tasks for others, and carried with it an implication of\ncontempt. Was it not so, Mr. West?\"\n\n\"That is about it,\" I said. \"Personal service, such as waiting on\ntables, was considered menial, and held in such contempt, in my day,\nthat persons of culture and refinement would suffer hardship before\ncondescending to it.\"\n\n\"What a strangely artificial idea,\" exclaimed Mrs. Leete wonderingly.\n\n\"And yet these services had to be rendered,\" said Edith.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied. \"But we imposed them on the poor, and those who\nhad no alternative but starvation.\"\n\n\"And increased the burden you imposed on them by adding your contempt,\"\nremarked Dr. Leete.\n\n\"I don't think I clearly understand,\" said Edith. \"Do you mean that you\npermitted people to do things for you which you despised them for\ndoing, or that you accepted services from them which you would have\nbeen unwilling to render them? You can't surely mean that, Mr. West?\"\n\nI was obliged to tell her that the fact was just as she had stated. Dr.\nLeete, however, came to my relief.\n\n\"To understand why Edith is surprised,\" he said, \"you must know that\nnowadays it is an axiom of ethics that to accept a service from another\nwhich we would be unwilling to return in kind, if need were, is like\nborrowing with the intention of not repaying, while to enforce such a\nservice by taking advantage of the poverty or necessity of a person\nwould be an outrage like forcible robbery. It is the worst thing about\nany system which divides men, or allows them to be divided, into\nclasses and castes, that it weakens the sense of a common humanity.\nUnequal distribution of wealth, and, still more effectually, unequal\nopportunities of education and culture, divided society in your day\ninto classes which in many respects regarded each other as distinct\nraces. There is not, after all, such a difference as might appear\nbetween our ways of looking at this question of service. Ladies and\ngentlemen of the cultured class in your day would no more have\npermitted persons of their own class to render them services they would\nscorn to return than we would permit anybody to do so. The poor and the\nuncultured, however, they looked upon as of another kind from\nthemselves. The equal wealth and equal opportunities of culture which\nall persons now enjoy have simply made us all members of one class,\nwhich corresponds to the most fortunate class with you. Until this\nequality of condition had come to pass, the idea of the solidarity of\nhumanity, the brotherhood of all men, could never have become the real\nconviction and practical principle of action it is nowadays. In your\nday the same phrases were indeed used, but they were phrases merely.\"\n\n\"Do the waiters, also, volunteer?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The waiters are young men in the unclassified\ngrade of the industrial army who are assignable to all sorts of\nmiscellaneous occupations not requiring special skill. Waiting on table\nis one of these, and every young recruit is given a taste of it. I\nmyself served as a waiter for several months in this very dining-house\nsome forty years ago. Once more you must remember that there is\nrecognized no sort of difference between the dignity of the different\nsorts of work required by the nation. The individual is never regarded,\nnor regards himself, as the servant of those he serves, nor is he in\nany way dependent upon them. It is always the nation which he is\nserving. No difference is recognized between a waiter's functions and\nthose of any other worker. The fact that his is a personal service is\nindifferent from our point of view. So is a doctor's. I should as soon\nexpect our waiter today to look down on me because I served him as a\ndoctor, as think of looking down on him because he serves me as a\nwaiter.\"\n\nAfter dinner my entertainers conducted me about the building, of which\nthe extent, the magnificent architecture and richness of embellishment,\nastonished me. It seemed that it was not merely a dining-hall, but\nlikewise a great pleasure-house and social rendezvous of the quarter,\nand no appliance of entertainment or recreation seemed lacking.\n\n\"You find illustrated here,\" said Dr. Leete, when I had expressed my\nadmiration, \"what I said to you in our first conversation, when you\nwere looking out over the city, as to the splendor of our public and\ncommon life as compared with the simplicity of our private and home\nlife, and the contrast which, in this respect, the twentieth bears to\nthe nineteenth century. To save ourselves useless burdens, we have as\nlittle gear about us at home as is consistent with comfort, but the\nsocial side of our life is ornate and luxurious beyond anything the\nworld ever knew before. All the industrial and professional guilds have\nclubhouses as extensive as this, as well as country, mountain, and\nseaside houses for sport and rest in vacations.\"\n\n\nNOTE. In the latter part of the nineteenth century it became a practice\nof needy young men at some of the colleges of the country to earn a\nlittle money for their term bills by serving as waiters on tables at\nhotels during the long summer vacation. It was claimed, in reply to\ncritics who expressed the prejudices of the time in asserting that\npersons voluntarily following such an occupation could not be\ngentlemen, that they were entitled to praise for vindicating, by their\nexample, the dignity of all honest and necessary labor. The use of this\nargument illustrates a common confusion in thought on the part of my\nformer contemporaries. The business of waiting on tables was in no more\nneed of defense than most of the other ways of getting a living in that\nday, but to talk of dignity attaching to labor of any sort under the\nsystem then prevailing was absurd. There is no way in which selling\nlabor for the highest price it will fetch is more dignified than\nselling goods for what can be got. Both were commercial transactions to\nbe judged by the commercial standard. By setting a price in money on\nhis service, the worker accepted the money measure for it, and\nrenounced all clear claim to be judged by any other. The sordid taint\nwhich this necessity imparted to the noblest and the highest sorts of\nservice was bitterly resented by generous souls, but there was no\nevading it. There was no exemption, however transcendent the quality of\none's service, from the necessity of haggling for its price in the\nmarket-place. The physician must sell his healing and the apostle his\npreaching like the rest. The prophet, who had guessed the meaning of\nGod, must dicker for the price of the revelation, and the poet hawk his\nvisions in printers' row. If I were asked to name the most\ndistinguishing felicity of this age, as compared to that in which I\nfirst saw the light, I should say that to me it seems to consist in the\ndignity you have given to labor by refusing to set a price upon it and\nabolishing the market-place forever. By requiring of every man his best\nyou have made God his task-master, and by making honor the sole reward\nof achievement you have imparted to all service the distinction\npeculiar in my day to the soldier's.\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\nWhen, in the course of our tour of inspection, we came to the library,\nwe succumbed to the temptation of the luxurious leather chairs with\nwhich it was furnished, and sat down in one of the book-lined alcoves\nto rest and chat awhile.[1]\n\n\"Edith tells me that you have been in the library all the morning,\"\nsaid Mrs. Leete. \"Do you know, it seems to me, Mr. West, that you are\nthe most enviable of mortals.\"\n\n\"I should like to know just why,\" I replied.\n\n\"Because the books of the last hundred years will be new to you,\" she\nanswered. \"You will have so much of the most absorbing literature to\nread as to leave you scarcely time for meals these five years to come.\nAh, what would I give if I had not already read Berrian's novels.\"\n\n\"Or Nesmyth's, mamma,\" added Edith.\n\n\"Yes, or Oates' poems, or 'Past and Present,' or, 'In the Beginning,'\nor--oh, I could name a dozen books, each worth a year of one's life,\"\ndeclared Mrs. Leete, enthusiastically.\n\n\"I judge, then, that there has been some notable literature produced in\nthis century.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Leete. \"It has been an era of unexampled intellectual\nsplendor. Probably humanity never before passed through a moral and\nmaterial evolution, at once so vast in its scope and brief in its time\nof accomplishment, as that from the old order to the new in the early\npart of this century. When men came to realize the greatness of the\nfelicity which had befallen them, and that the change through which\nthey had passed was not merely an improvement in details of their\ncondition, but the rise of the race to a new plane of existence with an\nillimitable vista of progress, their minds were affected in all their\nfaculties with a stimulus, of which the outburst of the mediaeval\nrenaissance offers a suggestion but faint indeed. There ensued an era\nof mechanical invention, scientific discovery, art, musical and\nliterary productiveness to which no previous age of the world offers\nanything comparable.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said I, \"talking of literature, how are books published\nnow? Is that also done by the nation?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But how do you manage it? Does the government publish everything that\nis brought it as a matter of course, at the public expense, or does it\nexercise a censorship and print only what it approves?\"\n\n\"Neither way. The printing department has no censorial powers. It is\nbound to print all that is offered it, but prints it only on condition\nthat the author defray the first cost out of his credit. He must pay\nfor the privilege of the public ear, and if he has any message worth\nhearing we consider that he will be glad to do it. Of course, if\nincomes were unequal, as in the old times, this rule would enable only\nthe rich to be authors, but the resources of citizens being equal, it\nmerely measures the strength of the author's motive. The cost of an\nedition of an average book can be saved out of a year's credit by the\npractice of economy and some sacrifices. The book, on being published,\nis placed on sale by the nation.\"\n\n\"The author receiving a royalty on the sales as with us, I suppose,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Not as with you, certainly,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"but nevertheless in\none way. The price of every book is made up of the cost of its\npublication with a royalty for the author. The author fixes this\nroyalty at any figure he pleases. Of course if he puts it unreasonably\nhigh it is his own loss, for the book will not sell. The amount of this\nroyalty is set to his credit and he is discharged from other service to\nthe nation for so long a period as this credit at the rate of allowance\nfor the support of citizens shall suffice to support him. If his book\nbe moderately successful, he has thus a furlough for several months, a\nyear, two or three years, and if he in the mean time produces other\nsuccessful work, the remission of service is extended so far as the\nsale of that may justify. An author of much acceptance succeeds in\nsupporting himself by his pen during the entire period of service, and\nthe degree of any writer's literary ability, as determined by the\npopular voice, is thus the measure of the opportunity given him to\ndevote his time to literature. In this respect the outcome of our\nsystem is not very dissimilar to that of yours, but there are two\nnotable differences. In the first place, the universally high level of\neducation nowadays gives the popular verdict a conclusiveness on the\nreal merit of literary work which in your day it was as far as possible\nfrom having. In the second place, there is no such thing now as\nfavoritism of any sort to interfere with the recognition of true merit.\nEvery author has precisely the same facilities for bringing his work\nbefore the popular tribunal. To judge from the complaints of the\nwriters of your day, this absolute equality of opportunity would have\nbeen greatly prized.\"\n\n\"In the recognition of merit in other fields of original genius, such\nas music, art, invention, design,\" I said, \"I suppose you follow a\nsimilar principle.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"although the details differ. In art, for example,\nas in literature, the people are the sole judges. They vote upon the\nacceptance of statues and paintings for the public buildings, and their\nfavorable verdict carries with it the artist's remission from other\ntasks to devote himself to his vocation. On copies of his work disposed\nof, he also derives the same advantage as the author on sales of his\nbooks. In all these lines of original genius the plan pursued is the\nsame to offer a free field to aspirants, and as soon as exceptional\ntalent is recognized to release it from all trammels and let it have\nfree course. The remission of other service in these cases is not\nintended as a gift or reward, but as the means of obtaining more and\nhigher service. Of course there are various literary, art, and\nscientific institutes to which membership comes to the famous and is\ngreatly prized. The highest of all honors in the nation, higher than\nthe presidency, which calls merely for good sense and devotion to duty,\nis the red ribbon awarded by the vote of the people to the great\nauthors, artists, engineers, physicians, and inventors of the\ngeneration. Not over a certain number wear it at any one time, though\nevery bright young fellow in the country loses innumerable nights'\nsleep dreaming of it. I even did myself.\"\n\n\"Just as if mamma and I would have thought any more of you with it,\"\nexclaimed Edith; \"not that it isn't, of course, a very fine thing to\nhave.\"\n\n\"You had no choice, my dear, but to take your father as you found him\nand make the best of him,\" Dr. Leete replied; \"but as for your mother,\nthere, she would never have had me if I had not assured her that I was\nbound to get the red ribbon or at least the blue.\"\n\nOn this extravagance Mrs. Leete's only comment was a smile.\n\n\"How about periodicals and newspapers?\" I said. \"I won't deny that your\nbook publishing system is a considerable improvement on ours, both as\nto its tendency to encourage a real literary vocation, and, quite as\nimportant, to discourage mere scribblers; but I don't see how it can be\nmade to apply to magazines and newspapers. It is very well to make a\nman pay for publishing a book, because the expense will be only\noccasional; but no man could afford the expense of publishing a\nnewspaper every day in the year. It took the deep pockets of our\nprivate capitalists to do that, and often exhausted even them before\nthe returns came in. If you have newspapers at all, they must, I fancy,\nbe published by the government at the public expense, with government\neditors, reflecting government opinions. Now, if your system is so\nperfect that there is never anything to criticize in the conduct of\naffairs, this arrangement may answer. Otherwise I should think the lack\nof an independent unofficial medium for the expression of public\nopinion would have most unfortunate results. Confess, Dr. Leete, that a\nfree newspaper press, with all that it implies, was a redeeming\nincident of the old system when capital was in private hands, and that\nyou have to set off the loss of that against your gains in other\nrespects.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I can't give you even that consolation,\" replied Dr.\nLeete, laughing. \"In the first place, Mr. West, the newspaper press is\nby no means the only or, as we look at it, the best vehicle for serious\ncriticism of public affairs. To us, the judgments of your newspapers on\nsuch themes seem generally to have been crude and flippant, as well as\ndeeply tinctured with prejudice and bitterness. In so far as they may\nbe taken as expressing public opinion, they give an unfavorable\nimpression of the popular intelligence, while so far as they may have\nformed public opinion, the nation was not to be felicitated. Nowadays,\nwhen a citizen desires to make a serious impression upon the public\nmind as to any aspect of public affairs, he comes out with a book or\npamphlet, published as other books are. But this is not because we lack\nnewspapers and magazines, or that they lack the most absolute freedom.\nThe newspaper press is organized so as to be a more perfect expression\nof public opinion than it possibly could be in your day, when private\ncapital controlled and managed it primarily as a money-making business,\nand secondarily only as a mouthpiece for the people.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"if the government prints the papers at the public\nexpense, how can it fail to control their policy? Who appoints the\neditors, if not the government?\"\n\n\"The government does not pay the expense of the papers, nor appoint\ntheir editors, nor in any way exert the slightest influence on their\npolicy,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The people who take the paper pay the\nexpense of its publication, choose its editor, and remove him when\nunsatisfactory. You will scarcely say, I think, that such a newspaper\npress is not a free organ of popular opinion.\"\n\n\"Decidedly I shall not,\" I replied, \"but how is it practicable?\"\n\n\"Nothing could be simpler. Supposing some of my neighbors or myself\nthink we ought to have a newspaper reflecting our opinions, and devoted\nespecially to our locality, trade, or profession. We go about among the\npeople till we get the names of such a number that their annual\nsubscriptions will meet the cost of the paper, which is little or big\naccording to the largeness of its constituency. The amount of the\nsubscriptions marked off the credits of the citizens guarantees the\nnation against loss in publishing the paper, its business, you\nunderstand, being that of a publisher purely, with no option to refuse\nthe duty required. The subscribers to the paper now elect somebody as\neditor, who, if he accepts the office, is discharged from other service\nduring his incumbency. Instead of paying a salary to him, as in your\nday, the subscribers pay the nation an indemnity equal to the cost of\nhis support for taking him away from the general service. He manages\nthe paper just as one of your editors did, except that he has no\ncounting-room to obey, or interests of private capital as against the\npublic good to defend. At the end of the first year, the subscribers\nfor the next either re-elect the former editor or choose any one else\nto his place. An able editor, of course, keeps his place indefinitely.\nAs the subscription list enlarges, the funds of the paper increase, and\nit is improved by the securing of more and better contributors, just as\nyour papers were.\"\n\n\"How is the staff of contributors recompensed, since they cannot be\npaid in money?\"\n\n\"The editor settles with them the price of their wares. The amount is\ntransferred to their individual credit from the guarantee credit of the\npaper, and a remission of service is granted the contributor for a\nlength of time corresponding to the amount credited him, just as to\nother authors. As to magazines, the system is the same. Those\ninterested in the prospectus of a new periodical pledge enough\nsubscriptions to run it for a year; select their editor, who\nrecompenses his contributors just as in the other case, the printing\nbureau furnishing the necessary force and material for publication, as\na matter of course. When an editor's services are no longer desired, if\nhe cannot earn the right to his time by other literary work, he simply\nresumes his place in the industrial army. I should add that, though\nordinarily the editor is elected only at the end of the year, and as a\nrule is continued in office for a term of years, in case of any sudden\nchange he should give to the tone of the paper, provision is made for\ntaking the sense of the subscribers as to his removal at any time.\"\n\n\"However earnestly a man may long for leisure for purposes of study or\nmeditation,\" I remarked, \"he cannot get out of the harness, if I\nunderstand you rightly, except in these two ways you have mentioned. He\nmust either by literary, artistic, or inventive productiveness\nindemnify the nation for the loss of his services, or must get a\nsufficient number of other people to contribute to such an indemnity.\"\n\n\"It is most certain,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"that no able-bodied man\nnowadays can evade his share of work and live on the toil of others,\nwhether he calls himself by the fine name of student or confesses to\nbeing simply lazy. At the same time our system is elastic enough to\ngive free play to every instinct of human nature which does not aim at\ndominating others or living on the fruit of others' labor. There is not\nonly the remission by indemnification but the remission by abnegation.\nAny man in his thirty-third year, his term of service being then half\ndone, can obtain an honorable discharge from the army, provided he\naccepts for the rest of his life one half the rate of maintenance other\ncitizens receive. It is quite possible to live on this amount, though\none must forego the luxuries and elegancies of life, with some,\nperhaps, of its comforts.\"\n\nWhen the ladies retired that evening, Edith brought me a book and said:\n\n\"If you should be wakeful to-night, Mr. West, you might be interested\nin looking over this story by Berrian. It is considered his\nmasterpiece, and will at least give you an idea what the stories\nnowadays are like.\"\n\nI sat up in my room that night reading \"Penthesilia\" till it grew gray\nin the east, and did not lay it down till I had finished it. And yet\nlet no admirer of the great romancer of the twentieth century resent my\nsaying that at the first reading what most impressed me was not so much\nwhat was in the book as what was left out of it. The story-writers of\nmy day would have deemed the making of bricks without straw a light\ntask compared with the construction of a romance from which should be\nexcluded all effects drawn from the contrasts of wealth and poverty,\neducation and ignorance, coarseness and refinement, high and low, all\nmotives drawn from social pride and ambition, the desire of being\nricher or the fear of being poorer, together with sordid anxieties of\nany sort for one's self or others; a romance in which there should,\nindeed, be love galore, but love unfretted by artificial barriers\ncreated by differences of station or possessions, owning no other law\nbut that of the heart. The reading of \"Penthesilia\" was of more value\nthan almost any amount of explanation would have been in giving me\nsomething like a general impression of the social aspect of the\ntwentieth century. The information Dr. Leete had imparted was indeed\nextensive as to facts, but they had affected my mind as so many\nseparate impressions, which I had as yet succeeded but imperfectly in\nmaking cohere. Berrian put them together for me in a picture.\n\n\n[1] I cannot sufficiently celebrate the glorious liberty that reigns in\nthe public libraries of the twentieth century as compared with the\nintolerable management of those of the nineteenth century, in which the\nbooks were jealously railed away from the people, and obtainable only\nat an expenditure of time and red tape calculated to discourage any\nordinary taste for literature.\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\nNext morning I rose somewhat before the breakfast hour. As I descended\nthe stairs, Edith stepped into the hall from the room which had been\nthe scene of the morning interview between us described some chapters\nback.\n\n\"Ah!\" she exclaimed, with a charmingly arch expression, \"you thought to\nslip out unbeknown for another of those solitary morning rambles which\nhave such nice effects on you. But you see I am up too early for you\nthis time. You are fairly caught.\"\n\n\"You discredit the efficacy of your own cure,\" I said, \"by supposing\nthat such a ramble would now be attended with bad consequences.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear that,\" she said. \"I was in here arranging some\nflowers for the breakfast table when I heard you come down, and fancied\nI detected something surreptitious in your step on the stairs.\"\n\n\"You did me injustice,\" I replied. \"I had no idea of going out at all.\"\n\nDespite her effort to convey an impression that my interception was\npurely accidental, I had at the time a dim suspicion of what I\nafterwards learned to be the fact, namely, that this sweet creature, in\npursuance of her self-assumed guardianship over me, had risen for the\nlast two or three mornings at an unheard-of hour, to insure against the\npossibility of my wandering off alone in case I should be affected as\non the former occasion. Receiving permission to assist her in making up\nthe breakfast bouquet, I followed her into the room from which she had\nemerged.\n\n\"Are you sure,\" she asked, \"that you are quite done with those terrible\nsensations you had that morning?\"\n\n\"I can't say that I do not have times of feeling decidedly queer,\" I\nreplied, \"moments when my personal identity seems an open question. It\nwould be too much to expect after my experience that I should not have\nsuch sensations occasionally, but as for being carried entirely off my\nfeet, as I was on the point of being that morning, I think the danger\nis past.\"\n\n\"I shall never forget how you looked that morning,\" she said.\n\n\"If you had merely saved my life,\" I continued, \"I might, perhaps, find\nwords to express my gratitude, but it was my reason you saved, and\nthere are no words that would not belittle my debt to you.\" I spoke\nwith emotion, and her eyes grew suddenly moist.\n\n\"It is too much to believe all this,\" she said, \"but it is very\ndelightful to hear you say it. What I did was very little. I was very\nmuch distressed for you, I know. Father never thinks anything ought to\nastonish us when it can be explained scientifically, as I suppose this\nlong sleep of yours can be, but even to fancy myself in your place\nmakes my head swim. I know that I could not have borne it at all.\"\n\n\"That would depend,\" I replied, \"on whether an angel came to support\nyou with her sympathy in the crisis of your condition, as one came to\nme.\" If my face at all expressed the feelings I had a right to have\ntoward this sweet and lovely young girl, who had played so angelic a\nrole toward me, its expression must have been very worshipful just\nthen. The expression or the words, or both together, caused her now to\ndrop her eyes with a charming blush.\n\n\"For the matter of that,\" I said, \"if your experience has not been as\nstartling as mine, it must have been rather overwhelming to see a man\nbelonging to a strange century, and apparently a hundred years dead,\nraised to life.\"\n\n\"It seemed indeed strange beyond any describing at first,\" she said,\n\"but when we began to put ourselves in your place, and realize how much\nstranger it must seem to you, I fancy we forgot our own feelings a good\ndeal, at least I know I did. It seemed then not so much astounding as\ninteresting and touching beyond anything ever heard of before.\"\n\n\"But does it not come over you as astounding to sit at table with me,\nseeing who I am?\"\n\n\"You must remember that you do not seem so strange to us as we must to\nyou,\" she answered. \"We belong to a future of which you could not form\nan idea, a generation of which you knew nothing until you saw us. But\nyou belong to a generation of which our forefathers were a part. We\nknow all about it; the names of many of its members are household words\nwith us. We have made a study of your ways of living and thinking;\nnothing you say or do surprises us, while we say and do nothing which\ndoes not seem strange to you. So you see, Mr. West, that if you feel\nthat you can, in time, get accustomed to us, you must not be surprised\nthat from the first we have scarcely found you strange at all.\"\n\n\"I had not thought of it in that way,\" I replied. \"There is indeed much\nin what you say. One can look back a thousand years easier than forward\nfifty. A century is not so very long a retrospect. I might have known\nyour great-grand-parents. Possibly I did. Did they live in Boston?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"You are not sure, then?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Now I think, they did.\"\n\n\"I had a very large circle of acquaintances in the city,\" I said. \"It\nis not unlikely that I knew or knew of some of them. Perhaps I may have\nknown them well. Wouldn't it be interesting if I should chance to be\nable to tell you all about your great-grandfather, for instance?\"\n\n\"Very interesting.\"\n\n\"Do you know your genealogy well enough to tell me who your forbears\nwere in the Boston of my day?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, then, you will some time tell me what some of their names\nwere.\"\n\nShe was engrossed in arranging a troublesome spray of green, and did\nnot reply at once. Steps upon the stairway indicated that the other\nmembers of the family were descending.\n\n\"Perhaps, some time,\" she said.\n\nAfter breakfast, Dr. Leete suggested taking me to inspect the central\nwarehouse and observe actually in operation the machinery of\ndistribution, which Edith had described to me. As we walked away from\nthe house I said, \"It is now several days that I have been living in\nyour household on a most extraordinary footing, or rather on none at\nall. I have not spoken of this aspect of my position before because\nthere were so many other aspects yet more extraordinary. But now that I\nam beginning a little to feel my feet under me, and to realize that,\nhowever I came here, I am here, and must make the best of it, I must\nspeak to you on this point.\"\n\n\"As for your being a guest in my house,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"I pray you\nnot to begin to be uneasy on that point, for I mean to keep you a long\ntime yet. With all your modesty, you can but realize that such a guest\nas yourself is an acquisition not willingly to be parted with.\"\n\n\"Thanks, doctor,\" I said. \"It would be absurd, certainly, for me to\naffect any oversensitiveness about accepting the temporary hospitality\nof one to whom I owe it that I am not still awaiting the end of the\nworld in a living tomb. But if I am to be a permanent citizen of this\ncentury I must have some standing in it. Now, in my time a person more\nor less entering the world, however he got in, would not be noticed in\nthe unorganized throng of men, and might make a place for himself\nanywhere he chose if he were strong enough. But nowadays everybody is a\npart of a system with a distinct place and function. I am outside the\nsystem, and don't see how I can get in; there seems no way to get in,\nexcept to be born in or to come in as an emigrant from some other\nsystem.\"\n\nDr. Leete laughed heartily.\n\n\"I admit,\" he said, \"that our system is defective in lacking provision\nfor cases like yours, but you see nobody anticipated additions to the\nworld except by the usual process. You need, however, have no fear that\nwe shall be unable to provide both a place and occupation for you in\ndue time. You have as yet been brought in contact only with the members\nof my family, but you must not suppose that I have kept your secret. On\nthe contrary, your case, even before your resuscitation, and vastly\nmore since has excited the profoundest interest in the nation. In view\nof your precarious nervous condition, it was thought best that I should\ntake exclusive charge of you at first, and that you should, through me\nand my family, receive some general idea of the sort of world you had\ncome back to before you began to make the acquaintance generally of its\ninhabitants. As to finding a function for you in society, there was no\nhesitation as to what that would be. Few of us have it in our power to\nconfer so great a service on the nation as you will be able to when you\nleave my roof, which, however, you must not think of doing for a good\ntime yet.\"\n\n\"What can I possibly do?\" I asked. \"Perhaps you imagine I have some\ntrade, or art, or special skill. I assure you I have none whatever. I\nnever earned a dollar in my life, or did an hour's work. I am strong,\nand might be a common laborer, but nothing more.\"\n\n\"If that were the most efficient service you were able to render the\nnation, you would find that avocation considered quite as respectable\nas any other,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"but you can do something else\nbetter. You are easily the master of all our historians on questions\nrelating to the social condition of the latter part of the nineteenth\ncentury, to us one of the most absorbingly interesting periods of\nhistory: and whenever in due time you have sufficiently familiarized\nyourself with our institutions, and are willing to teach us something\nconcerning those of your day, you will find an historical lectureship\nin one of our colleges awaiting you.\"\n\n\"Very good! very good indeed,\" I said, much relieved by so practical a\nsuggestion on a point which had begun to trouble me. \"If your people\nare really so much interested in the nineteenth century, there will\nindeed be an occupation ready-made for me. I don't think there is\nanything else that I could possibly earn my salt at, but I certainly\nmay claim without conceit to have some special qualifications for such\na post as you describe.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\nI found the processes at the warehouse quite as interesting as Edith\nhad described them, and became even enthusiastic over the truly\nremarkable illustration which is seen there of the prodigiously\nmultiplied efficiency which perfect organization can give to labor. It\nis like a gigantic mill, into the hopper of which goods are being\nconstantly poured by the train-load and shipload, to issue at the other\nend in packages of pounds and ounces, yards and inches, pints and\ngallons, corresponding to the infinitely complex personal needs of half\na million people. Dr. Leete, with the assistance of data furnished by\nme as to the way goods were sold in my day, figured out some astounding\nresults in the way of the economies effected by the modern system.\n\nAs we set out homeward, I said: \"After what I have seen to-day,\ntogether with what you have told me, and what I learned under Miss\nLeete's tutelage at the sample store, I have a tolerably clear idea of\nyour system of distribution, and how it enables you to dispense with a\ncirculating medium. But I should like very much to know something more\nabout your system of production. You have told me in general how your\nindustrial army is levied and organized, but who directs its efforts?\nWhat supreme authority determines what shall be done in every\ndepartment, so that enough of everything is produced and yet no labor\nwasted? It seems to me that this must be a wonderfully complex and\ndifficult function, requiring very unusual endowments.\"\n\n\"Does it indeed seem so to you?\" responded Dr. Leete. \"I assure you\nthat it is nothing of the kind, but on the other hand so simple, and\ndepending on principles so obvious and easily applied, that the\nfunctionaries at Washington to whom it is trusted require to be nothing\nmore than men of fair abilities to discharge it to the entire\nsatisfaction of the nation. The machine which they direct is indeed a\nvast one, but so logical in its principles and direct and simple in its\nworkings, that it all but runs itself; and nobody but a fool could\nderange it, as I think you will agree after a few words of explanation.\nSince you already have a pretty good idea of the working of the\ndistributive system, let us begin at that end. Even in your day\nstatisticians were able to tell you the number of yards of cotton,\nvelvet, woolen, the number of barrels of flour, potatoes, butter,\nnumber of pairs of shoes, hats, and umbrellas annually consumed by the\nnation. Owing to the fact that production was in private hands, and\nthat there was no way of getting statistics of actual distribution,\nthese figures were not exact, but they were nearly so. Now that every\npin which is given out from a national warehouse is recorded, of course\nthe figures of consumption for any week, month, or year, in the\npossession of the department of distribution at the end of that period,\nare precise. On these figures, allowing for tendencies to increase or\ndecrease and for any special causes likely to affect demand, the\nestimates, say for a year ahead, are based. These estimates, with a\nproper margin for security, having been accepted by the general\nadministration, the responsibility of the distributive department\nceases until the goods are delivered to it. I speak of the estimates\nbeing furnished for an entire year ahead, but in reality they cover\nthat much time only in case of the great staples for which the demand\ncan be calculated on as steady. In the great majority of smaller\nindustries for the product of which popular taste fluctuates, and\nnovelty is frequently required, production is kept barely ahead of\nconsumption, the distributive department furnishing frequent estimates\nbased on the weekly state of demand.\n\n\"Now the entire field of productive and constructive industry is\ndivided into ten great departments, each representing a group of allied\nindustries, each particular industry being in turn represented by a\nsubordinate bureau, which has a complete record of the plant and force\nunder its control, of the present product, and means of increasing it.\nThe estimates of the distributive department, after adoption by the\nadministration, are sent as mandates to the ten great departments,\nwhich allot them to the subordinate bureaus representing the particular\nindustries, and these set the men at work. Each bureau is responsible\nfor the task given it, and this responsibility is enforced by\ndepartmental oversight and that of the administration; nor does the\ndistributive department accept the product without its own inspection;\nwhile even if in the hands of the consumer an article turns out unfit,\nthe system enables the fault to be traced back to the original workman.\nThe production of the commodities for actual public consumption does\nnot, of course, require by any means all the national force of workers.\nAfter the necessary contingents have been detailed for the various\nindustries, the amount of labor left for other employment is expended\nin creating fixed capital, such as buildings, machinery, engineering\nworks, and so forth.\"\n\n\"One point occurs to me,\" I said, \"on which I should think there might\nbe dissatisfaction. Where there is no opportunity for private\nenterprise, how is there any assurance that the claims of small\nminorities of the people to have articles produced, for which there is\nno wide demand, will be respected? An official decree at any moment may\ndeprive them of the means of gratifying some special taste, merely\nbecause the majority does not share it.\"\n\n\"That would be tyranny indeed,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"and you may be very\nsure that it does not happen with us, to whom liberty is as dear as\nequality or fraternity. As you come to know our system better, you will\nsee that our officials are in fact, and not merely in name, the agents\nand servants of the people. The administration has no power to stop the\nproduction of any commodity for which there continues to be a demand.\nSuppose the demand for any article declines to such a point that its\nproduction becomes very costly. The price has to be raised in\nproportion, of course, but as long as the consumer cares to pay it, the\nproduction goes on. Again, suppose an article not before produced is\ndemanded. If the administration doubts the reality of the demand, a\npopular petition guaranteeing a certain basis of consumption compels it\nto produce the desired article. A government, or a majority, which\nshould undertake to tell the people, or a minority, what they were to\neat, drink, or wear, as I believe governments in America did in your\nday, would be regarded as a curious anachronism indeed. Possibly you\nhad reasons for tolerating these infringements of personal\nindependence, but we should not think them endurable. I am glad you\nraised this point, for it has given me a chance to show you how much\nmore direct and efficient is the control over production exercised by\nthe individual citizen now than it was in your day, when what you\ncalled private initiative prevailed, though it should have been called\ncapitalist initiative, for the average private citizen had little\nenough share in it.\"\n\n\"You speak of raising the price of costly articles,\" I said. \"How can\nprices be regulated in a country where there is no competition between\nbuyers or sellers?\"\n\n\"Just as they were with you,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"You think that needs\nexplaining,\" he added, as I looked incredulous, \"but the explanation\nneed not be long; the cost of the labor which produced it was\nrecognized as the legitimate basis of the price of an article in your\nday, and so it is in ours. In your day, it was the difference in wages\nthat made the difference in the cost of labor; now it is the relative\nnumber of hours constituting a day's work in different trades, the\nmaintenance of the worker being equal in all cases. The cost of a man's\nwork in a trade so difficult that in order to attract volunteers the\nhours have to be fixed at four a day is twice as great as that in a\ntrade where the men work eight hours. The result as to the cost of\nlabor, you see, is just the same as if the man working four hours were\npaid, under your system, twice the wages the others get. This\ncalculation applied to the labor employed in the various processes of a\nmanufactured article gives its price relatively to other articles.\nBesides the cost of production and transportation, the factor of\nscarcity affects the prices of some commodities. As regards the great\nstaples of life, of which an abundance can always be secured, scarcity\nis eliminated as a factor. There is always a large surplus kept on hand\nfrom which any fluctuations of demand or supply can be corrected, even\nin most cases of bad crops. The prices of the staples grow less year by\nyear, but rarely, if ever, rise. There are, however, certain classes of\narticles permanently, and others temporarily, unequal to the demand,\nas, for example, fresh fish or dairy products in the latter category,\nand the products of high skill and rare materials in the other. All\nthat can be done here is to equalize the inconvenience of the scarcity.\nThis is done by temporarily raising the price if the scarcity be\ntemporary, or fixing it high if it be permanent. High prices in your\nday meant restriction of the articles affected to the rich, but\nnowadays, when the means of all are the same, the effect is only that\nthose to whom the articles seem most desirable are the ones who\npurchase them. Of course the nation, as any other caterer for the\npublic needs must be, is frequently left with small lots of goods on\nits hands by changes in taste, unseasonable weather and various other\ncauses. These it has to dispose of at a sacrifice just as merchants\noften did in your day, charging up the loss to the expenses of the\nbusiness. Owing, however, to the vast body of consumers to which such\nlots can be simultaneously offered, there is rarely any difficulty in\ngetting rid of them at trifling loss. I have given you now some general\nnotion of our system of production; as well as distribution. Do you\nfind it as complex as you expected?\"\n\nI admitted that nothing could be much simpler.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said Dr. Leete, \"that it is within the truth to say that\nthe head of one of the myriad private businesses of your day, who had\nto maintain sleepless vigilance against the fluctuations of the market,\nthe machinations of his rivals, and the failure of his debtors, had a\nfar more trying task than the group of men at Washington who nowadays\ndirect the industries of the entire nation. All this merely shows, my\ndear fellow, how much easier it is to do things the right way than the\nwrong. It is easier for a general up in a balloon, with perfect survey\nof the field, to manoeuvre a million men to victory than for a sergeant\nto manage a platoon in a thicket.\"\n\n\"The general of this army, including the flower of the manhood of the\nnation, must be the foremost man in the country, really greater even\nthan the President of the United States,\" I said.\n\n\"He is the President of the United States,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"or\nrather the most important function of the presidency is the headship of\nthe industrial army.\"\n\n\"How is he chosen?\" I asked.\n\n\"I explained to you before,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"when I was describing\nthe force of the motive of emulation among all grades of the industrial\narmy, that the line of promotion for the meritorious lies through three\ngrades to the officer's grade, and thence up through the lieutenancies\nto the captaincy or foremanship, and superintendency or colonel's rank.\nNext, with an intervening grade in some of the larger trades, comes the\ngeneral of the guild, under whose immediate control all the operations\nof the trade are conducted. This officer is at the head of the national\nbureau representing his trade, and is responsible for its work to the\nadministration. The general of his guild holds a splendid position, and\none which amply satisfies the ambition of most men, but above his rank,\nwhich may be compared--to follow the military analogies familiar to\nyou--to that of a general of division or major-general, is that of the\nchiefs of the ten great departments, or groups of allied trades. The\nchiefs of these ten grand divisions of the industrial army may be\ncompared to your commanders of army corps, or lieutenant-generals, each\nhaving from a dozen to a score of generals of separate guilds reporting\nto him. Above these ten great officers, who form his council, is the\ngeneral-in-chief, who is the President of the United States.\n\n\"The general-in-chief of the industrial army must have passed through\nall the grades below him, from the common laborers up. Let us see how\nhe rises. As I have told you, it is simply by the excellence of his\nrecord as a worker that one rises through the grades of the privates\nand becomes a candidate for a lieutenancy. Through the lieutenancies he\nrises to the colonelcy, or superintendent's position, by appointment\nfrom above, strictly limited to the candidates of the best records. The\ngeneral of the guild appoints to the ranks under him, but he himself is\nnot appointed, but chosen by suffrage.\"\n\n\"By suffrage!\" I exclaimed. \"Is not that ruinous to the discipline of\nthe guild, by tempting the candidates to intrigue for the support of\nthe workers under them?\"\n\n\"So it would be, no doubt,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"if the workers had any\nsuffrage to exercise, or anything to say about the choice. But they\nhave nothing. Just here comes in a peculiarity of our system. The\ngeneral of the guild is chosen from among the superintendents by vote\nof the honorary members of the guild, that is, of those who have served\ntheir time in the guild and received their discharge. As you know, at\nthe age of forty-five we are mustered out of the army of industry, and\nhave the residue of life for the pursuit of our own improvement or\nrecreation. Of course, however, the associations of our active lifetime\nretain a powerful hold on us. The companionships we formed then remain\nour companionships till the end of life. We always continue honorary\nmembers of our former guilds, and retain the keenest and most jealous\ninterest in their welfare and repute in the hands of the following\ngeneration. In the clubs maintained by the honorary members of the\nseveral guilds, in which we meet socially, there are no topics of\nconversation so common as those which relate to these matters, and the\nyoung aspirants for guild leadership who can pass the criticism of us\nold fellows are likely to be pretty well equipped. Recognizing this\nfact, the nation entrusts to the honorary members of each guild the\nelection of its general, and I venture to claim that no previous form\nof society could have developed a body of electors so ideally adapted\nto their office, as regards absolute impartiality, knowledge of the\nspecial qualifications and record of candidates, solicitude for the\nbest result, and complete absence of self-interest.\n\n\"Each of the ten lieutenant-generals or heads of departments is himself\nelected from among the generals of the guilds grouped as a department,\nby vote of the honorary members of the guilds thus grouped. Of course\nthere is a tendency on the part of each guild to vote for its own\ngeneral, but no guild of any group has nearly enough votes to elect a\nman not supported by most of the others. I assure you that these\nelections are exceedingly lively.\"\n\n\"The President, I suppose, is selected from among the ten heads of the\ngreat departments,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Precisely, but the heads of departments are not eligible to the\npresidency till they have been a certain number of years out of office.\nIt is rarely that a man passes through all the grades to the headship\nof a department much before he is forty, and at the end of a five\nyears' term he is usually forty-five. If more, he still serves through\nhis term, and if less, he is nevertheless discharged from the\nindustrial army at its termination. It would not do for him to return\nto the ranks. The interval before he is a candidate for the presidency\nis intended to give time for him to recognize fully that he has\nreturned into the general mass of the nation, and is identified with it\nrather than with the industrial army. Moreover, it is expected that he\nwill employ this period in studying the general condition of the army,\ninstead of that of the special group of guilds of which he was the\nhead. From among the former heads of departments who may be eligible at\nthe time, the President is elected by vote of all the men of the nation\nwho are not connected with the industrial army.\"\n\n\"The army is not allowed to vote for President?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. That would be perilous to its discipline, which it is\nthe business of the President to maintain as the representative of the\nnation at large. His right hand for this purpose is the inspectorate, a\nhighly important department of our system; to the inspectorate come all\ncomplaints or information as to defects in goods, insolence or\ninefficiency of officials, or dereliction of any sort in the public\nservice. The inspectorate, however, does not wait for complaints. Not\nonly is it on the alert to catch and sift every rumor of a fault in the\nservice, but it is its business, by systematic and constant oversight\nand inspection of every branch of the army, to find out what is going\nwrong before anybody else does. The President is usually not far from\nfifty when elected, and serves five years, forming an honorable\nexception to the rule of retirement at forty-five. At the end of his\nterm of office, a national Congress is called to receive his report and\napprove or condemn it. If it is approved, Congress usually elects him\nto represent the nation for five years more in the international\ncouncil. Congress, I should also say, passes on the reports of the\noutgoing heads of departments, and a disapproval renders any one of\nthem ineligible for President. But it is rare, indeed, that the nation\nhas occasion for other sentiments than those of gratitude toward its\nhigh officers. As to their ability, to have risen from the ranks, by\ntests so various and severe, to their positions, is proof in itself of\nextraordinary qualities, while as to faithfulness, our social system\nleaves them absolutely without any other motive than that of winning\nthe esteem of their fellow citizens. Corruption is impossible in a\nsociety where there is neither poverty to be bribed nor wealth to\nbribe, while as to demagoguery or intrigue for office, the conditions\nof promotion render them out of the question.\"\n\n\"One point I do not quite understand,\" I said. \"Are the members of the\nliberal professions eligible to the presidency? and if so, how are they\nranked with those who pursue the industries proper?\"\n\n\"They have no ranking with them,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The members of\nthe technical professions, such as engineers and architects, have a\nranking with the constructive guilds; but the members of the liberal\nprofessions, the doctors and teachers, as well as the artists and men\nof letters who obtain remissions of industrial service, do not belong\nto the industrial army. On this ground they vote for the President, but\nare not eligible to his office. One of its main duties being the\ncontrol and discipline of the industrial army, it is essential that the\nPresident should have passed through all its grades to understand his\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable,\" I said; \"but if the doctors and teachers do not\nknow enough of industry to be President, neither, I should think, can\nthe President know enough of medicine and education to control those\ndepartments.\"\n\n\"No more does he,\" was the reply. \"Except in the general way that he is\nresponsible for the enforcement of the laws as to all classes, the\nPresident has nothing to do with the faculties of medicine and\neducation, which are controlled by boards of regents of their own, in\nwhich the President is ex-officio chairman, and has the casting vote.\nThese regents, who, of course, are responsible to Congress, are chosen\nby the honorary members of the guilds of education and medicine, the\nretired teachers and doctors of the country.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I said, \"the method of electing officials by votes of\nthe retired members of the guilds is nothing more than the application\non a national scale of the plan of government by alumni, which we used\nto a slight extent occasionally in the management of our higher\neducational institutions.\"\n\n\"Did you, indeed?\" exclaimed Dr. Leete, with animation. \"That is quite\nnew to me, and I fancy will be to most of us, and of much interest as\nwell. There has been great discussion as to the germ of the idea, and\nwe fancied that there was for once something new under the sun. Well!\nwell! In your higher educational institutions! that is interesting\nindeed. You must tell me more of that.\"\n\n\"Truly, there is very little more to tell than I have told already,\" I\nreplied. \"If we had the germ of your idea, it was but as a germ.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\nThat evening I sat up for some time after the ladies had retired,\ntalking with Dr. Leete about the effect of the plan of exempting men\nfrom further service to the nation after the age of forty-five, a point\nbrought up by his account of the part taken by the retired citizens in\nthe government.\n\n\"At forty-five,\" said I, \"a man still has ten years of good manual\nlabor in him, and twice ten years of good intellectual service. To be\nsuperannuated at that age and laid on the shelf must be regarded rather\nas a hardship than a favor by men of energetic dispositions.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. West,\" exclaimed Dr. Leete, beaming upon me, \"you cannot\nhave any idea of the piquancy your nineteenth century ideas have for us\nof this day, the rare quaintness of their effect. Know, O child of\nanother race and yet the same, that the labor we have to render as our\npart in securing for the nation the means of a comfortable physical\nexistence is by no means regarded as the most important, the most\ninteresting, or the most dignified employment of our powers. We look\nupon it as a necessary duty to be discharged before we can fully devote\nourselves to the higher exercise of our faculties, the intellectual and\nspiritual enjoyments and pursuits which alone mean life. Everything\npossible is indeed done by the just distribution of burdens, and by all\nmanner of special attractions and incentives to relieve our labor of\nirksomeness, and, except in a comparative sense, it is not usually\nirksome, and is often inspiring. But it is not our labor, but the\nhigher and larger activities which the performance of our task will\nleave us free to enter upon, that are considered the main business of\nexistence.\n\n\"Of course not all, nor the majority, have those scientific, artistic,\nliterary, or scholarly interests which make leisure the one thing\nvaluable to their possessors. Many look upon the last half of life\nchiefly as a period for enjoyment of other sorts; for travel, for\nsocial relaxation in the company of their life-time friends; a time for\nthe cultivation of all manner of personal idiosyncrasies and special\ntastes, and the pursuit of every imaginable form of recreation; in a\nword, a time for the leisurely and unperturbed appreciation of the good\nthings of the world which they have helped to create. But, whatever the\ndifferences between our individual tastes as to the use we shall put\nour leisure to, we all agree in looking forward to the date of our\ndischarge as the time when we shall first enter upon the full enjoyment\nof our birthright, the period when we shall first really attain our\nmajority and become enfranchised from discipline and control, with the\nfee of our lives vested in ourselves. As eager boys in your day\nanticipated twenty-one, so men nowadays look forward to forty-five. At\ntwenty-one we become men, but at forty-five we renew youth. Middle age\nand what you would have called old age are considered, rather than\nyouth, the enviable time of life. Thanks to the better conditions of\nexistence nowadays, and above all the freedom of every one from care,\nold age approaches many years later and has an aspect far more benign\nthan in past times. Persons of average constitution usually live to\neighty-five or ninety, and at forty-five we are physically and mentally\nyounger, I fancy, than you were at thirty-five. It is a strange\nreflection that at forty-five, when we are just entering upon the most\nenjoyable period of life, you already began to think of growing old and\nto look backward. With you it was the forenoon, with us it is the\nafternoon, which is the brighter half of life.\"\n\nAfter this I remember that our talk branched into the subject of\npopular sports and recreations at the present time as compared with\nthose of the nineteenth century.\n\n\"In one respect,\" said Dr. Leete, \"there is a marked difference. The\nprofessional sportsmen, which were such a curious feature of your day,\nwe have nothing answering to, nor are the prizes for which our athletes\ncontend money prizes, as with you. Our contests are always for glory\nonly. The generous rivalry existing between the various guilds, and the\nloyalty of each worker to his own, afford a constant stimulation to all\nsorts of games and matches by sea and land, in which the young men take\nscarcely more interest than the honorary guildsmen who have served\ntheir time. The guild yacht races off Marblehead take place next week,\nand you will be able to judge for yourself of the popular enthusiasm\nwhich such events nowadays call out as compared with your day. The\ndemand for 'panem ef circenses' preferred by the Roman populace is\nrecognized nowadays as a wholly reasonable one. If bread is the first\nnecessity of life, recreation is a close second, and the nation caters\nfor both. Americans of the nineteenth century were as unfortunate in\nlacking an adequate provision for the one sort of need as for the\nother. Even if the people of that period had enjoyed larger leisure,\nthey would, I fancy, have often been at a loss how to pass it\nagreeably. We are never in that predicament.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\nIn the course of an early morning constitutional I visited Charlestown.\nAmong the changes, too numerous to attempt to indicate, which mark the\nlapse of a century in that quarter, I particularly noted the total\ndisappearance of the old state prison.\n\n\"That went before my day, but I remember hearing about it,\" said Dr.\nLeete, when I alluded to the fact at the breakfast table. \"We have no\njails nowadays. All cases of atavism are treated in the hospitals.\"\n\n\"Of atavism!\" I exclaimed, staring.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The idea of dealing punitively with\nthose unfortunates was given up at least fifty years ago, and I think\nmore.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand you,\" I said. \"Atavism in my day was a word\napplied to the cases of persons in whom some trait of a remote ancestor\nrecurred in a noticeable manner. Am I to understand that crime is\nnowadays looked upon as the recurrence of an ancestral trait?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Dr. Leete with a smile half humorous, half\ndeprecating, \"but since you have so explicitly asked the question, I am\nforced to say that the fact is precisely that.\"\n\nAfter what I had already learned of the moral contrasts between the\nnineteenth and the twentieth centuries, it was doubtless absurd in me\nto begin to develop sensitiveness on the subject, and probably if Dr.\nLeete had not spoken with that apologetic air and Mrs. Leete and Edith\nshown a corresponding embarrassment, I should not have flushed, as I\nwas conscious I did.\n\n\"I was not in much danger of being vain of my generation before,\" I\nsaid; \"but, really--\"\n\n\"This is your generation, Mr. West,\" interposed Edith. \"It is the one\nin which you are living, you know, and it is only because we are alive\nnow that we call it ours.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I will try to think of it so,\" I said, and as my eyes met\nhers their expression quite cured my senseless sensitiveness. \"After\nall,\" I said, with a laugh, \"I was brought up a Calvinist, and ought\nnot to be startled to hear crime spoken of as an ancestral trait.\"\n\n\"In point of fact,\" said Dr. Leete, \"our use of the word is no\nreflection at all on your generation, if, begging Edith's pardon, we\nmay call it yours, so far as seeming to imply that we think ourselves,\napart from our circumstances, better than you were. In your day fully\nnineteen twentieths of the crime, using the word broadly to include all\nsorts of misdemeanors, resulted from the inequality in the possessions\nof individuals; want tempted the poor, lust of greater gains, or the\ndesire to preserve former gains, tempted the well-to-do. Directly or\nindirectly, the desire for money, which then meant every good thing,\nwas the motive of all this crime, the taproot of a vast poison growth,\nwhich the machinery of law, courts, and police could barely prevent\nfrom choking your civilization outright. When we made the nation the\nsole trustee of the wealth of the people, and guaranteed to all\nabundant maintenance, on the one hand abolishing want, and on the other\nchecking the accumulation of riches, we cut this root, and the poison\ntree that overshadowed your society withered, like Jonah's gourd, in a\nday. As for the comparatively small class of violent crimes against\npersons, unconnected with any idea of gain, they were almost wholly\nconfined, even in your day, to the ignorant and bestial; and in these\ndays, when education and good manners are not the monopoly of a few,\nbut universal, such atrocities are scarcely ever heard of. You now see\nwhy the word 'atavism' is used for crime. It is because nearly all\nforms of crime known to you are motiveless now, and when they appear\ncan only be explained as the outcropping of ancestral traits. You used\nto call persons who stole, evidently without any rational motive,\nkleptomaniacs, and when the case was clear deemed it absurd to punish\nthem as thieves. Your attitude toward the genuine kleptomaniac is\nprecisely ours toward the victim of atavism, an attitude of compassion\nand firm but gentle restraint.\"\n\n\"Your courts must have an easy time of it,\" I observed. \"With no\nprivate property to speak of, no disputes between citizens over\nbusiness relations, no real estate to divide or debts to collect, there\nmust be absolutely no civil business at all for them; and with no\noffenses against property, and mighty few of any sort to provide\ncriminal cases, I should think you might almost do without judges and\nlawyers altogether.\"\n\n\"We do without the lawyers, certainly,\" was Dr. Leete's reply. \"It\nwould not seem reasonable to us, in a case where the only interest of\nthe nation is to find out the truth, that persons should take part in\nthe proceedings who had an acknowledged motive to color it.\"\n\n\"But who defends the accused?\"\n\n\"If he is a criminal he needs no defense, for he pleads guilty in most\ninstances,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The plea of the accused is not a mere\nformality with us, as with you. It is usually the end of the case.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that the man who pleads not guilty is thereupon\ndischarged?\"\n\n\"No, I do not mean that. He is not accused on light grounds, and if he\ndenies his guilt, must still be tried. But trials are few, for in most\ncases the guilty man pleads guilty. When he makes a false plea and is\nclearly proved guilty, his penalty is doubled. Falsehood is, however,\nso despised among us that few offenders would lie to save themselves.\"\n\n\"That is the most astounding thing you have yet told me,\" I exclaimed.\n\"If lying has gone out of fashion, this is indeed the 'new heavens and\nthe new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,' which the prophet\nforetold.\"\n\n\"Such is, in fact, the belief of some persons nowadays,\" was the\ndoctor's answer. \"They hold that we have entered upon the millennium,\nand the theory from their point of view does not lack plausibility. But\nas to your astonishment at finding that the world has outgrown lying,\nthere is really no ground for it. Falsehood, even in your day, was not\ncommon between gentlemen and ladies, social equals. The lie of fear was\nthe refuge of cowardice, and the lie of fraud the device of the cheat.\nThe inequalities of men and the lust of acquisition offered a constant\npremium on lying at that time. Yet even then, the man who neither\nfeared another nor desired to defraud him scorned falsehood. Because we\nare now all social equals, and no man either has anything to fear from\nanother or can gain anything by deceiving him, the contempt of\nfalsehood is so universal that it is rarely, as I told you, that even a\ncriminal in other respects will be found willing to lie. When, however,\na plea of not guilty is returned, the judge appoints two colleagues to\nstate the opposite sides of the case. How far these men are from being\nlike your hired advocates and prosecutors, determined to acquit or\nconvict, may appear from the fact that unless both agree that the\nverdict found is just, the case is tried over, while anything like bias\nin the tone of either of the judges stating the case would be a\nshocking scandal.\"\n\n\"Do I understand,\" I said, \"that it is a judge who states each side of\nthe case as well as a judge who hears it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The judges take turns in serving on the bench and at the\nbar, and are expected to maintain the judicial temper equally whether\nin stating or deciding a case. The system is indeed in effect that of\ntrial by three judges occupying different points of view as to the\ncase. When they agree upon a verdict, we believe it to be as near to\nabsolute truth as men well can come.\"\n\n\"You have given up the jury system, then?\"\n\n\"It was well enough as a corrective in the days of hired advocates, and\na bench sometimes venal, and often with a tenure that made it\ndependent, but is needless now. No conceivable motive but justice could\nactuate our judges.\"\n\n\"How are these magistrates selected?\"\n\n\"They are an honorable exception to the rule which discharges all men\nfrom service at the age of forty-five. The President of the nation\nappoints the necessary judges year by year from the class reaching that\nage. The number appointed is, of course, exceedingly few, and the honor\nso high that it is held an offset to the additional term of service\nwhich follows, and though a judge's appointment may be declined, it\nrarely is. The term is five years, without eligibility to\nreappointment. The members of the Supreme Court, which is the guardian\nof the constitution, are selected from among the lower judges. When a\nvacancy in that court occurs, those of the lower judges, whose terms\nexpire that year, select, as their last official act, the one of their\ncolleagues left on the bench whom they deem fittest to fill it.\"\n\n\"There being no legal profession to serve as a school for judges,\" I\nsaid, \"they must, of course, come directly from the law school to the\nbench.\"\n\n\"We have no such things as law schools,\" replied the doctor smiling.\n\"The law as a special science is obsolete. It was a system of casuistry\nwhich the elaborate artificiality of the old order of society\nabsolutely required to interpret it, but only a few of the plainest and\nsimplest legal maxims have any application to the existing state of the\nworld. Everything touching the relations of men to one another is now\nsimpler, beyond any comparison, than in your day. We should have no\nsort of use for the hair-splitting experts who presided and argued in\nyour courts. You must not imagine, however, that we have any disrespect\nfor those ancient worthies because we have no use for them. On the\ncontrary, we entertain an unfeigned respect, amounting almost to awe,\nfor the men who alone understood and were able to expound the\ninterminable complexity of the rights of property, and the relations of\ncommercial and personal dependence involved in your system. What,\nindeed, could possibly give a more powerful impression of the intricacy\nand artificiality of that system than the fact that it was necessary to\nset apart from other pursuits the cream of the intellect of every\ngeneration, in order to provide a body of pundits able to make it even\nvaguely intelligible to those whose fates it determined. The treatises\nof your great lawyers, the works of Blackstone and Chitty, of Story and\nParsons, stand in our museums, side by side with the tomes of Duns\nScotus and his fellow scholastics, as curious monuments of intellectual\nsubtlety devoted to subjects equally remote from the interests of\nmodern men. Our judges are simply widely informed, judicious, and\ndiscreet men of ripe years.\n\n\"I should not fail to speak of one important function of the minor\njudges,\" added Dr. Leete. \"This is to adjudicate all cases where a\nprivate of the industrial army makes a complaint of unfairness against\nan officer. All such questions are heard and settled without appeal by\na single judge, three judges being required only in graver cases. The\nefficiency of industry requires the strictest discipline in the army of\nlabor, but the claim of the workman to just and considerate treatment\nis backed by the whole power of the nation. The officer commands and\nthe private obeys, but no officer is so high that he would dare display\nan overbearing manner toward a workman of the lowest class. As for\nchurlishness or rudeness by an official of any sort, in his relations\nto the public, not one among minor offenses is more sure of a prompt\npenalty than this. Not only justice but civility is enforced by our\njudges in all sorts of intercourse. No value of service is accepted as\na set-off to boorish or offensive manners.\"\n\nIt occurred to me, as Dr. Leete was speaking, that in all his talk I\nhad heard much of the nation and nothing of the state governments. Had\nthe organization of the nation as an industrial unit done away with the\nstates? I asked.\n\n\"Necessarily,\" he replied. \"The state governments would have interfered\nwith the control and discipline of the industrial army, which, of\ncourse, required to be central and uniform. Even if the state\ngovernments had not become inconvenient for other reasons, they were\nrendered superfluous by the prodigious simplification in the task of\ngovernment since your day. Almost the sole function of the\nadministration now is that of directing the industries of the country.\nMost of the purposes for which governments formerly existed no longer\nremain to be subserved. We have no army or navy, and no military\norganization. We have no departments of state or treasury, no excise or\nrevenue services, no taxes or tax collectors. The only function proper\nof government, as known to you, which still remains, is the judiciary\nand police system. I have already explained to you how simple is our\njudicial system as compared with your huge and complex machine. Of\ncourse the same absence of crime and temptation to it, which make the\nduties of judges so light, reduces the number and duties of the police\nto a minimum.\"\n\n\"But with no state legislatures, and Congress meeting only once in five\nyears, how do you get your legislation done?\"\n\n\"We have no legislation,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"that is, next to none. It\nis rarely that Congress, even when it meets, considers any new laws of\nconsequence, and then it only has power to commend them to the\nfollowing Congress, lest anything be done hastily. If you will consider\na moment, Mr. West, you will see that we have nothing to make laws\nabout. The fundamental principles on which our society is founded\nsettle for all time the strifes and misunderstandings which in your day\ncalled for legislation.\n\n\"Fully ninety-nine hundredths of the laws of that time concerned the\ndefinition and protection of private property and the relations of\nbuyers and sellers. There is neither private property, beyond personal\nbelongings, now, nor buying and selling, and therefore the occasion of\nnearly all the legislation formerly necessary has passed away.\nFormerly, society was a pyramid poised on its apex. All the\ngravitations of human nature were constantly tending to topple it over,\nand it could be maintained upright, or rather upwrong (if you will\npardon the feeble witticism), by an elaborate system of constantly\nrenewed props and buttresses and guy-ropes in the form of laws. A\ncentral Congress and forty state legislatures, turning out some twenty\nthousand laws a year, could not make new props fast enough to take the\nplace of those which were constantly breaking down or becoming\nineffectual through some shifting of the strain. Now society rests on\nits base, and is in as little need of artificial supports as the\neverlasting hills.\"\n\n\"But you have at least municipal governments besides the one central\nauthority?\"\n\n\"Certainly, and they have important and extensive functions in looking\nout for the public comfort and recreation, and the improvement and\nembellishment of the villages and cities.\"\n\n\"But having no control over the labor of their people, or means of\nhiring it, how can they do anything?\"\n\n\"Every town or city is conceded the right to retain, for its own public\nworks, a certain proportion of the quota of labor its citizens\ncontribute to the nation. This proportion, being assigned it as so much\ncredit, can be applied in any way desired.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\nThat afternoon Edith casually inquired if I had yet revisited the\nunderground chamber in the garden in which I had been found.\n\n\"Not yet,\" I replied. \"To be frank, I have shrunk thus far from doing\nso, lest the visit might revive old associations rather too strongly\nfor my mental equilibrium.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" she said, \"I can imagine that you have done well to stay\naway. I ought to have thought of that.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I am glad you spoke of it. The danger, if there was any,\nexisted only during the first day or two. Thanks to you, chiefly and\nalways, I feel my footing now so firm in this new world, that if you\nwill go with me to keep the ghosts off, I should really like to visit\nthe place this afternoon.\"\n\nEdith demurred at first, but, finding that I was in earnest, consented\nto accompany me. The rampart of earth thrown up from the excavation was\nvisible among the trees from the house, and a few steps brought us to\nthe spot. All remained as it was at the point when work was interrupted\nby the discovery of the tenant of the chamber, save that the door had\nbeen opened and the slab from the roof replaced. Descending the sloping\nsides of the excavation, we went in at the door and stood within the\ndimly lighted room.\n\nEverything was just as I had beheld it last on that evening one hundred\nand thirteen years previous, just before closing my eyes for that long\nsleep. I stood for some time silently looking about me. I saw that my\ncompanion was furtively regarding me with an expression of awed and\nsympathetic curiosity. I put out my hand to her and she placed hers in\nit, the soft fingers responding with a reassuring pressure to my clasp.\nFinally she whispered, \"Had we not better go out now? You must not try\nyourself too far. Oh, how strange it must be to you!\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"it does not seem strange; that is the\nstrangest part of it.\"\n\n\"Not strange?\" she echoed.\n\n\"Even so,\" I replied. \"The emotions with which you evidently credit me,\nand which I anticipated would attend this visit, I simply do not feel.\nI realize all that these surroundings suggest, but without the\nagitation I expected. You can't be nearly as much surprised at this as\nI am myself. Ever since that terrible morning when you came to my help,\nI have tried to avoid thinking of my former life, just as I have\navoided coming here, for fear of the agitating effects. I am for all\nthe world like a man who has permitted an injured limb to lie\nmotionless under the impression that it is exquisitely sensitive, and\non trying to move it finds that it is paralyzed.\"\n\n\"Do you mean your memory is gone?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I remember everything connected with my former life, but\nwith a total lack of keen sensation. I remember it for clearness as if\nit had been but a day since then, but my feelings about what I remember\nare as faint as if to my consciousness, as well as in fact, a hundred\nyears had intervened. Perhaps it is possible to explain this, too. The\neffect of change in surroundings is like that of lapse of time in\nmaking the past seem remote. When I first woke from that trance, my\nformer life appeared as yesterday, but now, since I have learned to\nknow my new surroundings, and to realize the prodigious changes that\nhave transformed the world, I no longer find it hard, but very easy, to\nrealize that I have slept a century. Can you conceive of such a thing\nas living a hundred years in four days? It really seems to me that I\nhave done just that, and that it is this experience which has given so\nremote and unreal an appearance to my former life. Can you see how such\na thing might be?\"\n\n\"I can conceive it,\" replied Edith, meditatively, \"and I think we ought\nall to be thankful that it is so, for it will save you much suffering,\nI am sure.\"\n\n\"Imagine,\" I said, in an effort to explain, as much to myself as to\nher, the strangeness of my mental condition, \"that a man first heard of\na bereavement many, many years, half a lifetime perhaps, after the\nevent occurred. I fancy his feeling would be perhaps something as mine\nis. When I think of my friends in the world of that former day, and the\nsorrow they must have felt for me, it is with a pensive pity, rather\nthan keen anguish, as of a sorrow long, long ago ended.\"\n\n\"You have told us nothing yet of your friends,\" said Edith. \"Had you\nmany to mourn you?\"\n\n\"Thank God, I had very few relatives, none nearer than cousins,\" I\nreplied. \"But there was one, not a relative, but dearer to me than any\nkin of blood. She had your name. She was to have been my wife soon. Ah\nme!\"\n\n\"Ah me!\" sighed the Edith by my side. \"Think of the heartache she must\nhave had.\"\n\nSomething in the deep feeling of this gentle girl touched a chord in my\nbenumbed heart. My eyes, before so dry, were flooded with the tears\nthat had till now refused to come. When I had regained my composure, I\nsaw that she too had been weeping freely.\n\n\"God bless your tender heart,\" I said. \"Would you like to see her\npicture?\"\n\nA small locket with Edith Bartlett's picture, secured about my neck\nwith a gold chain, had lain upon my breast all through that long sleep,\nand removing this I opened and gave it to my companion. She took it\nwith eagerness, and after poring long over the sweet face, touched the\npicture with her lips.\n\n\"I know that she was good and lovely enough to well deserve your\ntears,\" she said; \"but remember her heartache was over long ago, and\nshe has been in heaven for nearly a century.\"\n\nIt was indeed so. Whatever her sorrow had once been, for nearly a\ncentury she had ceased to weep, and, my sudden passion spent, my own\ntears dried away. I had loved her very dearly in my other life, but it\nwas a hundred years ago! I do not know but some may find in this\nconfession evidence of lack of feeling, but I think, perhaps, that none\ncan have had an experience sufficiently like mine to enable them to\njudge me. As we were about to leave the chamber, my eye rested upon the\ngreat iron safe which stood in one corner. Calling my companion's\nattention to it, I said:\n\n\"This was my strong room as well as my sleeping room. In the safe\nyonder are several thousand dollars in gold, and any amount of\nsecurities. If I had known when I went to sleep that night just how\nlong my nap would be, I should still have thought that the gold was a\nsafe provision for my needs in any country or any century, however\ndistant. That a time would ever come when it would lose its purchasing\npower, I should have considered the wildest of fancies. Nevertheless,\nhere I wake up to find myself among a people of whom a cartload of gold\nwill not procure a loaf of bread.\"\n\nAs might be expected, I did not succeed in impressing Edith that there\nwas anything remarkable in this fact. \"Why in the world should it?\" she\nmerely asked.\n\n\n\nChapter 21\n\nIt had been suggested by Dr. Leete that we should devote the next\nmorning to an inspection of the schools and colleges of the city, with\nsome attempt on his own part at an explanation of the educational\nsystem of the twentieth century.\n\n\"You will see,\" said he, as we set out after breakfast, \"many very\nimportant differences between our methods of education and yours, but\nthe main difference is that nowadays all persons equally have those\nopportunities of higher education which in your day only an\ninfinitesimal portion of the population enjoyed. We should think we had\ngained nothing worth speaking of, in equalizing the physical comfort of\nmen, without this educational equality.\"\n\n\"The cost must be very great,\" I said.\n\n\"If it took half the revenue of the nation, nobody would grudge it,\"\nreplied Dr. Leete, \"nor even if it took it all save a bare pittance.\nBut in truth the expense of educating ten thousand youth is not ten nor\nfive times that of educating one thousand. The principle which makes\nall operations on a large scale proportionally cheaper than on a small\nscale holds as to education also.\"\n\n\"College education was terribly expensive in my day,\" said I.\n\n\"If I have not been misinformed by our historians,\" Dr. Leete answered,\n\"it was not college education but college dissipation and extravagance\nwhich cost so highly. The actual expense of your colleges appears to\nhave been very low, and would have been far lower if their patronage\nhad been greater. The higher education nowadays is as cheap as the\nlower, as all grades of teachers, like all other workers, receive the\nsame support. We have simply added to the common school system of\ncompulsory education, in vogue in Massachusetts a hundred years ago, a\nhalf dozen higher grades, carrying the youth to the age of twenty-one\nand giving him what you used to call the education of a gentleman,\ninstead of turning him loose at fourteen or fifteen with no mental\nequipment beyond reading, writing, and the multiplication table.\"\n\n\"Setting aside the actual cost of these additional years of education,\"\nI replied, \"we should not have thought we could afford the loss of time\nfrom industrial pursuits. Boys of the poorer classes usually went to\nwork at sixteen or younger, and knew their trade at twenty.\"\n\n\"We should not concede you any gain even in material product by that\nplan,\" Dr. Leete replied. \"The greater efficiency which education gives\nto all sorts of labor, except the rudest, makes up in a short period\nfor the time lost in acquiring it.\"\n\n\"We should also have been afraid,\" said I, \"that a high education,\nwhile it adapted men to the professions, would set them against manual\nlabor of all sorts.\"\n\n\"That was the effect of high education in your day, I have read,\"\nreplied the doctor; \"and it was no wonder, for manual labor meant\nassociation with a rude, coarse, and ignorant class of people. There is\nno such class now. It was inevitable that such a feeling should exist\nthen, for the further reason that all men receiving a high education\nwere understood to be destined for the professions or for wealthy\nleisure, and such an education in one neither rich nor professional was\na proof of disappointed aspirations, an evidence of failure, a badge of\ninferiority rather than superiority. Nowadays, of course, when the\nhighest education is deemed necessary to fit a man merely to live,\nwithout any reference to the sort of work he may do, its possession\nconveys no such implication.\"\n\n\"After all,\" I remarked, \"no amount of education can cure natural\ndullness or make up for original mental deficiencies. Unless the\naverage natural mental capacity of men is much above its level in my\nday, a high education must be pretty nearly thrown away on a large\nelement of the population. We used to hold that a certain amount of\nsusceptibility to educational influences is required to make a mind\nworth cultivating, just as a certain natural fertility in soil is\nrequired if it is to repay tilling.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Dr. Leete, \"I am glad you used that illustration, for it is\njust the one I would have chosen to set forth the modern view of\neducation. You say that land so poor that the product will not repay\nthe labor of tilling is not cultivated. Nevertheless, much land that\ndoes not begin to repay tilling by its product was cultivated in your\nday and is in ours. I refer to gardens, parks, lawns, and, in general,\nto pieces of land so situated that, were they left to grow up to weeds\nand briers, they would be eyesores and inconveniencies to all about.\nThey are therefore tilled, and though their product is little, there is\nyet no land that, in a wider sense, better repays cultivation. So it is\nwith the men and women with whom we mingle in the relations of society,\nwhose voices are always in our ears, whose behavior in innumerable ways\naffects our enjoyment--who are, in fact, as much conditions of our\nlives as the air we breathe, or any of the physical elements on which\nwe depend. If, indeed, we could not afford to educate everybody, we\nshould choose the coarsest and dullest by nature, rather than the\nbrightest, to receive what education we could give. The naturally\nrefined and intellectual can better dispense with aids to culture than\nthose less fortunate in natural endowments.\n\n\"To borrow a phrase which was often used in your day, we should not\nconsider life worth living if we had to be surrounded by a population\nof ignorant, boorish, coarse, wholly uncultivated men and women, as was\nthe plight of the few educated in your day. Is a man satisfied, merely\nbecause he is perfumed himself, to mingle with a malodorous crowd?\nCould he take more than a very limited satisfaction, even in a palatial\napartment, if the windows on all four sides opened into stable yards?\nAnd yet just that was the situation of those considered most fortunate\nas to culture and refinement in your day. I know that the poor and\nignorant envied the rich and cultured then; but to us the latter,\nliving as they did, surrounded by squalor and brutishness, seem little\nbetter off than the former. The cultured man in your age was like one\nup to the neck in a nauseous bog solacing himself with a smelling\nbottle. You see, perhaps, now, how we look at this question of\nuniversal high education. No single thing is so important to every man\nas to have for neighbors intelligent, companionable persons. There is\nnothing, therefore, which the nation can do for him that will enhance\nso much his own happiness as to educate his neighbors. When it fails to\ndo so, the value of his own education to him is reduced by half, and\nmany of the tastes he has cultivated are made positive sources of pain.\n\n\"To educate some to the highest degree, and leave the mass wholly\nuncultivated, as you did, made the gap between them almost like that\nbetween different natural species, which have no means of\ncommunication. What could be more inhuman than this consequence of a\npartial enjoyment of education! Its universal and equal enjoyment\nleaves, indeed, the differences between men as to natural endowments as\nmarked as in a state of nature, but the level of the lowest is vastly\nraised. Brutishness is eliminated. All have some inkling of the\nhumanities, some appreciation of the things of the mind, and an\nadmiration for the still higher culture they have fallen short of. They\nhave become capable of receiving and imparting, in various degrees, but\nall in some measure, the pleasures and inspirations of a refined social\nlife. The cultured society of the nineteenth century--what did it\nconsist of but here and there a few microscopic oases in a vast,\nunbroken wilderness? The proportion of individuals capable of\nintellectual sympathies or refined intercourse, to the mass of their\ncontemporaries, used to be so infinitesimal as to be in any broad view\nof humanity scarcely worth mentioning. One generation of the world\nto-day represents a greater volume of intellectual life than any five\ncenturies ever did before.\n\n\"There is still another point I should mention in stating the grounds\non which nothing less than the universality of the best education could\nnow be tolerated,\" continued Dr. Leete, \"and that is, the interest of\nthe coming generation in having educated parents. To put the matter in\na nutshell, there are three main grounds on which our educational\nsystem rests: first, the right of every man to the completest education\nthe nation can give him on his own account, as necessary to his\nenjoyment of himself; second, the right of his fellow-citizens to have\nhim educated, as necessary to their enjoyment of his society; third,\nthe right of the unborn to be guaranteed an intelligent and refined\nparentage.\"\n\nI shall not describe in detail what I saw in the schools that day.\nHaving taken but slight interest in educational matters in my former\nlife, I could offer few comparisons of interest. Next to the fact of\nthe universality of the higher as well as the lower education, I was\nmost struck with the prominence given to physical culture, and the fact\nthat proficiency in athletic feats and games as well as in scholarship\nhad a place in the rating of the youth.\n\n\"The faculty of education,\" Dr. Leete explained, \"is held to the same\nresponsibility for the bodies as for the minds of its charges. The\nhighest possible physical, as well as mental, development of every one\nis the double object of a curriculum which lasts from the age of six to\nthat of twenty-one.\"\n\nThe magnificent health of the young people in the schools impressed me\nstrongly. My previous observations, not only of the notable personal\nendowments of the family of my host, but of the people I had seen in my\nwalks abroad, had already suggested the idea that there must have been\nsomething like a general improvement in the physical standard of the\nrace since my day, and now, as I compared these stalwart young men and\nfresh, vigorous maidens with the young people I had seen in the schools\nof the nineteenth century, I was moved to impart my thought to Dr.\nLeete. He listened with great interest to what I said.\n\n\"Your testimony on this point,\" he declared, \"is invaluable. We believe\nthat there has been such an improvement as you speak of, but of course\nit could only be a matter of theory with us. It is an incident of your\nunique position that you alone in the world of to-day can speak with\nauthority on this point. Your opinion, when you state it publicly,\nwill, I assure you, make a profound sensation. For the rest it would be\nstrange, certainly, if the race did not show an improvement. In your\nday, riches debauched one class with idleness of mind and body, while\npoverty sapped the vitality of the masses by overwork, bad food, and\npestilent homes. The labor required of children, and the burdens laid\non women, enfeebled the very springs of life. Instead of these\nmaleficent circumstances, all now enjoy the most favorable conditions\nof physical life; the young are carefully nurtured and studiously cared\nfor; the labor which is required of all is limited to the period of\ngreatest bodily vigor, and is never excessive; care for one's self and\none's family, anxiety as to livelihood, the strain of a ceaseless\nbattle for life--all these influences, which once did so much to wreck\nthe minds and bodies of men and women, are known no more. Certainly, an\nimprovement of the species ought to follow such a change. In certain\nspecific respects we know, indeed, that the improvement has taken\nplace. Insanity, for instance, which in the nineteenth century was so\nterribly common a product of your insane mode of life, has almost\ndisappeared, with its alternative, suicide.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\nWe had made an appointment to meet the ladies at the dining-hall for\ndinner, after which, having some engagement, they left us sitting at\ntable there, discussing our wine and cigars with a multitude of other\nmatters.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said I, in the course of our talk, \"morally speaking, your\nsocial system is one which I should be insensate not to admire in\ncomparison with any previously in vogue in the world, and especially\nwith that of my own most unhappy century. If I were to fall into a\nmesmeric sleep tonight as lasting as that other and meanwhile the\ncourse of time were to take a turn backward instead of forward, and I\nwere to wake up again in the nineteenth century, when I had told my\nfriends what I had seen, they would every one admit that your world was\na paradise of order, equity, and felicity. But they were a very\npractical people, my contemporaries, and after expressing their\nadmiration for the moral beauty and material splendor of the system,\nthey would presently begin to cipher and ask how you got the money to\nmake everybody so happy; for certainly, to support the whole nation at\na rate of comfort, and even luxury, such as I see around me, must\ninvolve vastly greater wealth than the nation produced in my day. Now,\nwhile I could explain to them pretty nearly everything else of the main\nfeatures of your system, I should quite fail to answer this question,\nand failing there, they would tell me, for they were very close\ncipherers, that I had been dreaming; nor would they ever believe\nanything else. In my day, I know that the total annual product of the\nnation, although it might have been divided with absolute equality,\nwould not have come to more than three or four hundred dollars per\nhead, not very much more than enough to supply the necessities of life\nwith few or any of its comforts. How is it that you have so much more?\"\n\n\"That is a very pertinent question, Mr. West,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"and\nI should not blame your friends, in the case you supposed, if they\ndeclared your story all moonshine, failing a satisfactory reply to it.\nIt is a question which I cannot answer exhaustively at any one sitting,\nand as for the exact statistics to bear out my general statements, I\nshall have to refer you for them to books in my library, but it would\ncertainly be a pity to leave you to be put to confusion by your old\nacquaintances, in case of the contingency you speak of, for lack of a\nfew suggestions.\n\n\"Let us begin with a number of small items wherein we economize wealth\nas compared with you. We have no national, state, county, or municipal\ndebts, or payments on their account. We have no sort of military or\nnaval expenditures for men or materials, no army, navy, or militia. We\nhave no revenue service, no swarm of tax assessors and collectors. As\nregards our judiciary, police, sheriffs, and jailers, the force which\nMassachusetts alone kept on foot in your day far more than suffices for\nthe nation now. We have no criminal class preying upon the wealth of\nsociety as you had. The number of persons, more or less absolutely lost\nto the working force through physical disability, of the lame, sick,\nand debilitated, which constituted such a burden on the able-bodied in\nyour day, now that all live under conditions of health and comfort, has\nshrunk to scarcely perceptible proportions, and with every generation\nis becoming more completely eliminated.\n\n\"Another item wherein we save is the disuse of money and the thousand\noccupations connected with financial operations of all sorts, whereby\nan army of men was formerly taken away from useful employments. Also\nconsider that the waste of the very rich in your day on inordinate\npersonal luxury has ceased, though, indeed, this item might easily be\nover-estimated. Again, consider that there are no idlers now, rich or\npoor--no drones.\n\n\"A very important cause of former poverty was the vast waste of labor\nand materials which resulted from domestic washing and cooking, and the\nperforming separately of innumerable other tasks to which we apply the\ncooperative plan.\n\n\"A larger economy than any of these--yes, of all together--is effected\nby the organization of our distributing system, by which the work done\nonce by the merchants, traders, storekeepers, with their various grades\nof jobbers, wholesalers, retailers, agents, commercial travelers, and\nmiddlemen of all sorts, with an excessive waste of energy in needless\ntransportation and interminable handlings, is performed by one tenth\nthe number of hands and an unnecessary turn of not one wheel. Something\nof what our distributing system is like you know. Our statisticians\ncalculate that one eightieth part of our workers suffices for all the\nprocesses of distribution which in your day required one eighth of the\npopulation, so much being withdrawn from the force engaged in\nproductive labor.\"\n\n\"I begin to see,\" I said, \"where you get your greater wealth.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"but you scarcely do as yet.\nThe economies I have mentioned thus far, in the aggregate, considering\nthe labor they would save directly and indirectly through saving of\nmaterial, might possibly be equivalent to the addition to your annual\nproduction of wealth of one half its former total. These items are,\nhowever, scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with other prodigious\nwastes, now saved, which resulted inevitably from leaving the\nindustries of the nation to private enterprise. However great the\neconomies your contemporaries might have devised in the consumption of\nproducts, and however marvelous the progress of mechanical invention,\nthey could never have raised themselves out of the slough of poverty so\nlong as they held to that system.\n\n\"No mode more wasteful for utilizing human energy could be devised, and\nfor the credit of the human intellect it should be remembered that the\nsystem never was devised, but was merely a survival from the rude ages\nwhen the lack of social organization made any sort of cooperation\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I will readily admit,\" I said, \"that our industrial system was\nethically very bad, but as a mere wealth-making machine, apart from\nmoral aspects, it seemed to us admirable.\"\n\n\"As I said,\" responded the doctor, \"the subject is too large to discuss\nat length now, but if you are really interested to know the main\ncriticisms which we moderns make on your industrial system as compared\nwith our own, I can touch briefly on some of them.\n\n\"The wastes which resulted from leaving the conduct of industry to\nirresponsible individuals, wholly without mutual understanding or\nconcert, were mainly four: first, the waste by mistaken undertakings;\nsecond, the waste from the competition and mutual hostility of those\nengaged in industry; third, the waste by periodical gluts and crises,\nwith the consequent interruptions of industry; fourth, the waste from\nidle capital and labor, at all times. Any one of these four great\nleaks, were all the others stopped, would suffice to make the\ndifference between wealth and poverty on the part of a nation.\n\n\"Take the waste by mistaken undertakings, to begin with. In your day\nthe production and distribution of commodities being without concert or\norganization, there was no means of knowing just what demand there was\nfor any class of products, or what was the rate of supply. Therefore,\nany enterprise by a private capitalist was always a doubtful\nexperiment. The projector having no general view of the field of\nindustry and consumption, such as our government has, could never be\nsure either what the people wanted, or what arrangements other\ncapitalists were making to supply them. In view of this, we are not\nsurprised to learn that the chances were considered several to one in\nfavor of the failure of any given business enterprise, and that it was\ncommon for persons who at last succeeded in making a hit to have failed\nrepeatedly. If a shoemaker, for every pair of shoes he succeeded in\ncompleting, spoiled the leather of four or five pair, besides losing\nthe time spent on them, he would stand about the same chance of getting\nrich as your contemporaries did with their system of private\nenterprise, and its average of four or five failures to one success.\n\n\"The next of the great wastes was that from competition. The field of\nindustry was a battlefield as wide as the world, in which the workers\nwasted, in assailing one another, energies which, if expended in\nconcerted effort, as to-day, would have enriched all. As for mercy or\nquarter in this warfare, there was absolutely no suggestion of it. To\ndeliberately enter a field of business and destroy the enterprises of\nthose who had occupied it previously, in order to plant one's own\nenterprise on their ruins, was an achievement which never failed to\ncommand popular admiration. Nor is there any stretch of fancy in\ncomparing this sort of struggle with actual warfare, so far as concerns\nthe mental agony and physical suffering which attended the struggle,\nand the misery which overwhelmed the defeated and those dependent on\nthem. Now nothing about your age is, at first sight, more astounding to\na man of modern times than the fact that men engaged in the same\nindustry, instead of fraternizing as comrades and co-laborers to a\ncommon end, should have regarded each other as rivals and enemies to be\nthrottled and overthrown. This certainly seems like sheer madness, a\nscene from bedlam. But more closely regarded, it is seen to be no such\nthing. Your contemporaries, with their mutual throat-cutting, knew very\nwell what they were at. The producers of the nineteenth century were\nnot, like ours, working together for the maintenance of the community,\nbut each solely for his own maintenance at the expense of the\ncommunity. If, in working to this end, he at the same time increased\nthe aggregate wealth, that was merely incidental. It was just as\nfeasible and as common to increase one's private hoard by practices\ninjurious to the general welfare. One's worst enemies were necessarily\nthose of his own trade, for, under your plan of making private profit\nthe motive of production, a scarcity of the article he produced was\nwhat each particular producer desired. It was for his interest that no\nmore of it should be produced than he himself could produce. To secure\nthis consummation as far as circumstances permitted, by killing off and\ndiscouraging those engaged in his line of industry, was his constant\neffort. When he had killed off all he could, his policy was to combine\nwith those he could not kill, and convert their mutual warfare into a\nwarfare upon the public at large by cornering the market, as I believe\nyou used to call it, and putting up prices to the highest point people\nwould stand before going without the goods. The day dream of the\nnineteenth century producer was to gain absolute control of the supply\nof some necessity of life, so that he might keep the public at the\nverge of starvation, and always command famine prices for what he\nsupplied. This, Mr. West, is what was called in the nineteenth century\na system of production. I will leave it to you if it does not seem, in\nsome of its aspects, a great deal more like a system for preventing\nproduction. Some time when we have plenty of leisure I am going to ask\nyou to sit down with me and try to make me comprehend, as I never yet\ncould, though I have studied the matter a great deal how such shrewd\nfellows as your contemporaries appear to have been in many respects\never came to entrust the business of providing for the community to a\nclass whose interest it was to starve it. I assure you that the wonder\nwith us is, not that the world did not get rich under such a system,\nbut that it did not perish outright from want. This wonder increases as\nwe go on to consider some of the other prodigious wastes that\ncharacterized it.\n\n\"Apart from the waste of labor and capital by misdirected industry, and\nthat from the constant bloodletting of your industrial warfare, your\nsystem was liable to periodical convulsions, overwhelming alike the\nwise and unwise, the successful cut-throat as well as his victim. I\nrefer to the business crises at intervals of five to ten years, which\nwrecked the industries of the nation, prostrating all weak enterprises\nand crippling the strongest, and were followed by long periods, often\nof many years, of so-called dull times, during which the capitalists\nslowly regathered their dissipated strength while the laboring classes\nstarved and rioted. Then would ensue another brief season of\nprosperity, followed in turn by another crisis and the ensuing years of\nexhaustion. As commerce developed, making the nations mutually\ndependent, these crises became world-wide, while the obstinacy of the\nensuing state of collapse increased with the area affected by the\nconvulsions, and the consequent lack of rallying centres. In proportion\nas the industries of the world multiplied and became complex, and the\nvolume of capital involved was increased, these business cataclysms\nbecame more frequent, till, in the latter part of the nineteenth\ncentury, there were two years of bad times to one of good, and the\nsystem of industry, never before so extended or so imposing, seemed in\ndanger of collapsing by its own weight. After endless discussions, your\neconomists appear by that time to have settled down to the despairing\nconclusion that there was no more possibility of preventing or\ncontrolling these crises than if they had been drouths or hurricanes.\nIt only remained to endure them as necessary evils, and when they had\npassed over to build up again the shattered structure of industry, as\ndwellers in an earthquake country keep on rebuilding their cities on\nthe same site.\n\n\"So far as considering the causes of the trouble inherent in their\nindustrial system, your contemporaries were certainly correct. They\nwere in its very basis, and must needs become more and more maleficent\nas the business fabric grew in size and complexity. One of these causes\nwas the lack of any common control of the different industries, and the\nconsequent impossibility of their orderly and coordinate development.\nIt inevitably resulted from this lack that they were continually\ngetting out of step with one another and out of relation with the\ndemand.\n\n\"Of the latter there was no criterion such as organized distribution\ngives us, and the first notice that it had been exceeded in any group\nof industries was a crash of prices, bankruptcy of producers, stoppage\nof production, reduction of wages, or discharge of workmen. This\nprocess was constantly going on in many industries, even in what were\ncalled good times, but a crisis took place only when the industries\naffected were extensive. The markets then were glutted with goods, of\nwhich nobody wanted beyond a sufficiency at any price. The wages and\nprofits of those making the glutted classes of goods being reduced or\nwholly stopped, their purchasing power as consumers of other classes of\ngoods, of which there were no natural glut, was taken away, and, as a\nconsequence, goods of which there was no natural glut became\nartificially glutted, till their prices also were broken down, and\ntheir makers thrown out of work and deprived of income. The crisis was\nby this time fairly under way, and nothing could check it till a\nnation's ransom had been wasted.\n\n\"A cause, also inherent in your system, which often produced and always\nterribly aggravated crises, was the machinery of money and credit.\nMoney was essential when production was in many private hands, and\nbuying and selling was necessary to secure what one wanted. It was,\nhowever, open to the obvious objection of substituting for food,\nclothing, and other things a merely conventional representative of\nthem. The confusion of mind which this favored, between goods and their\nrepresentative, led the way to the credit system and its prodigious\nillusions. Already accustomed to accept money for commodities, the\npeople next accepted promises for money, and ceased to look at all\nbehind the representative for the thing represented. Money was a sign\nof real commodities, but credit was but the sign of a sign. There was a\nnatural limit to gold and silver, that is, money proper, but none to\ncredit, and the result was that the volume of credit, that is, the\npromises of money, ceased to bear any ascertainable proportion to the\nmoney, still less to the commodities, actually in existence. Under such\na system, frequent and periodical crises were necessitated by a law as\nabsolute as that which brings to the ground a structure overhanging its\ncentre of gravity. It was one of your fictions that the government and\nthe banks authorized by it alone issued money; but everybody who gave a\ndollar's credit issued money to that extent, which was as good as any\nto swell the circulation till the next crises. The great extension of\nthe credit system was a characteristic of the latter part of the\nnineteenth century, and accounts largely for the almost incessant\nbusiness crises which marked that period. Perilous as credit was, you\ncould not dispense with its use, for, lacking any national or other\npublic organization of the capital of the country, it was the only\nmeans you had for concentrating and directing it upon industrial\nenterprises. It was in this way a most potent means for exaggerating\nthe chief peril of the private enterprise system of industry by\nenabling particular industries to absorb disproportionate amounts of\nthe disposable capital of the country, and thus prepare disaster.\nBusiness enterprises were always vastly in debt for advances of credit,\nboth to one another and to the banks and capitalists, and the prompt\nwithdrawal of this credit at the first sign of a crisis was generally\nthe precipitating cause of it.\n\n\"It was the misfortune of your contemporaries that they had to cement\ntheir business fabric with a material which an accident might at any\nmoment turn into an explosive. They were in the plight of a man\nbuilding a house with dynamite for mortar, for credit can be compared\nwith nothing else.\n\n\"If you would see how needless were these convulsions of business which\nI have been speaking of, and how entirely they resulted from leaving\nindustry to private and unorganized management, just consider the\nworking of our system. Overproduction in special lines, which was the\ngreat hobgoblin of your day, is impossible now, for by the connection\nbetween distribution and production supply is geared to demand like an\nengine to the governor which regulates its speed. Even suppose by an\nerror of judgment an excessive production of some commodity. The\nconsequent slackening or cessation of production in that line throws\nnobody out of employment. The suspended workers are at once found\noccupation in some other department of the vast workshop and lose only\nthe time spent in changing, while, as for the glut, the business of the\nnation is large enough to carry any amount of product manufactured in\nexcess of demand till the latter overtakes it. In such a case of\nover-production, as I have supposed, there is not with us, as with you,\nany complex machinery to get out of order and magnify a thousand times\nthe original mistake. Of course, having not even money, we still less\nhave credit. All estimates deal directly with the real things, the\nflour, iron, wood, wool, and labor, of which money and credit were for\nyou the very misleading representatives. In our calculation of cost\nthere can be no mistakes. Out of the annual product the amount\nnecessary for the support of the people is taken, and the requisite\nlabor to produce the next year's consumption provided for. The residue\nof the material and labor represents what can be safely expended in\nimprovements. If the crops are bad, the surplus for that year is less\nthan usual, that is all. Except for slight occasional effects of such\nnatural causes, there are no fluctuations of business; the material\nprosperity of the nation flows on uninterruptedly from generation to\ngeneration, like an ever broadening and deepening river.\n\n\"Your business crises, Mr. West,\" continued the doctor, \"like either of\nthe great wastes I mentioned before, were enough, alone, to have kept\nyour noses to the grindstone forever; but I have still to speak of one\nother great cause of your poverty, and that was the idleness of a great\npart of your capital and labor. With us it is the business of the\nadministration to keep in constant employment every ounce of available\ncapital and labor in the country. In your day there was no general\ncontrol of either capital or labor, and a large part of both failed to\nfind employment. 'Capital,' you used to say, 'is naturally timid,' and\nit would certainly have been reckless if it had not been timid in an\nepoch when there was a large preponderance of probability that any\nparticular business venture would end in failure. There was no time\nwhen, if security could have been guaranteed it, the amount of capital\ndevoted to productive industry could not have been greatly increased.\nThe proportion of it so employed underwent constant extraordinary\nfluctuations, according to the greater or less feeling of uncertainty\nas to the stability of the industrial situation, so that the output of\nthe national industries greatly varied in different years. But for the\nsame reason that the amount of capital employed at times of special\ninsecurity was far less than at times of somewhat greater security, a\nvery large proportion was never employed at all, because the hazard of\nbusiness was always very great in the best of times.\n\n\"It should be also noted that the great amount of capital always\nseeking employment where tolerable safety could be insured terribly\nembittered the competition between capitalists when a promising opening\npresented itself. The idleness of capital, the result of its timidity,\nof course meant the idleness of labor in corresponding degree.\nMoreover, every change in the adjustments of business, every slightest\nalteration in the condition of commerce or manufactures, not to speak\nof the innumerable business failures that took place yearly, even in\nthe best of times, were constantly throwing a multitude of men out of\nemployment for periods of weeks or months, or even years. A great\nnumber of these seekers after employment were constantly traversing the\ncountry, becoming in time professional vagabonds, then criminals. 'Give\nus work!' was the cry of an army of the unemployed at nearly all\nseasons, and in seasons of dullness in business this army swelled to a\nhost so vast and desperate as to threaten the stability of the\ngovernment. Could there conceivably be a more conclusive demonstration\nof the imbecility of the system of private enterprise as a method for\nenriching a nation than the fact that, in an age of such general\npoverty and want of everything, capitalists had to throttle one another\nto find a safe chance to invest their capital and workmen rioted and\nburned because they could find no work to do?\n\n\"Now, Mr. West,\" continued Dr. Leete, \"I want you to bear in mind that\nthese points of which I have been speaking indicate only negatively the\nadvantages of the national organization of industry by showing certain\nfatal defects and prodigious imbecilities of the systems of private\nenterprise which are not found in it. These alone, you must admit,\nwould pretty well explain why the nation is so much richer than in your\nday. But the larger half of our advantage over you, the positive side\nof it, I have yet barely spoken of. Supposing the system of private\nenterprise in industry were without any of the great leaks I have\nmentioned; that there were no waste on account of misdirected effort\ngrowing out of mistakes as to the demand, and inability to command a\ngeneral view of the industrial field. Suppose, also, there were no\nneutralizing and duplicating of effort from competition. Suppose, also,\nthere were no waste from business panics and crises through bankruptcy\nand long interruptions of industry, and also none from the idleness of\ncapital and labor. Supposing these evils, which are essential to the\nconduct of industry by capital in private hands, could all be\nmiraculously prevented, and the system yet retained; even then the\nsuperiority of the results attained by the modern industrial system of\nnational control would remain overwhelming.\n\n\"You used to have some pretty large textile manufacturing\nestablishments, even in your day, although not comparable with ours. No\ndoubt you have visited these great mills in your time, covering acres\nof ground, employing thousands of hands, and combining under one roof,\nunder one control, the hundred distinct processes between, say, the\ncotton bale and the bale of glossy calicoes. You have admired the vast\neconomy of labor as of mechanical force resulting from the perfect\ninterworking with the rest of every wheel and every hand. No doubt you\nhave reflected how much less the same force of workers employed in that\nfactory would accomplish if they were scattered, each man working\nindependently. Would you think it an exaggeration to say that the\nutmost product of those workers, working thus apart, however amicable\ntheir relations might be, was increased not merely by a percentage, but\nmany fold, when their efforts were organized under one control? Well\nnow, Mr. West, the organization of the industry of the nation under a\nsingle control, so that all its processes interlock, has multiplied the\ntotal product over the utmost that could be done under the former\nsystem, even leaving out of account the four great wastes mentioned, in\nthe same proportion that the product of those millworkers was increased\nby cooperation. The effectiveness of the working force of a nation,\nunder the myriad-headed leadership of private capital, even if the\nleaders were not mutual enemies, as compared with that which it attains\nunder a single head, may be likened to the military efficiency of a\nmob, or a horde of barbarians with a thousand petty chiefs, as compared\nwith that of a disciplined army under one general--such a fighting\nmachine, for example, as the German army in the time of Von Moltke.\"\n\n\"After what you have told me,\" I said, \"I do not so much wonder that\nthe nation is richer now than then, but that you are not all Croesuses.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"we are pretty well off. The rate at which\nwe live is as luxurious as we could wish. The rivalry of ostentation,\nwhich in your day led to extravagance in no way conducive to comfort,\nfinds no place, of course, in a society of people absolutely equal in\nresources, and our ambition stops at the surroundings which minister to\nthe enjoyment of life. We might, indeed, have much larger incomes,\nindividually, if we chose so to use the surplus of our product, but we\nprefer to expend it upon public works and pleasures in which all share,\nupon public halls and buildings, art galleries, bridges, statuary,\nmeans of transit, and the conveniences of our cities, great musical and\ntheatrical exhibitions, and in providing on a vast scale for the\nrecreations of the people. You have not begun to see how we live yet,\nMr. West. At home we have comfort, but the splendor of our life is, on\nits social side, that which we share with our fellows. When you know\nmore of it you will see where the money goes, as you used to say, and I\nthink you will agree that we do well so to expend it.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" observed Dr. Leete, as we strolled homeward from the\ndining hall, \"that no reflection would have cut the men of your\nwealth-worshiping century more keenly than the suggestion that they did\nnot know how to make money. Nevertheless that is just the verdict\nhistory has passed on them. Their system of unorganized and\nantagonistic industries was as absurd economically as it was morally\nabominable. Selfishness was their only science, and in industrial\nproduction selfishness is suicide. Competition, which is the instinct\nof selfishness, is another word for dissipation of energy, while\ncombination is the secret of efficient production; and not till the\nidea of increasing the individual hoard gives place to the idea of\nincreasing the common stock can industrial combination be realized, and\nthe acquisition of wealth really begin. Even if the principle of share\nand share alike for all men were not the only humane and rational basis\nfor a society, we should still enforce it as economically expedient,\nseeing that until the disintegrating influence of self-seeking is\nsuppressed no true concert of industry is possible.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\nThat evening, as I sat with Edith in the music room, listening to some\npieces in the programme of that day which had attracted my notice, I\ntook advantage of an interval in the music to say, \"I have a question\nto ask you which I fear is rather indiscreet.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure it is not that,\" she replied, encouragingly.\n\n\"I am in the position of an eavesdropper,\" I continued, \"who, having\noverheard a little of a matter not intended for him, though seeming to\nconcern him, has the impudence to come to the speaker for the rest.\"\n\n\"An eavesdropper!\" she repeated, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but an excusable one, as I think you will admit.\"\n\n\"This is very mysterious,\" she replied.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"so mysterious that often I have doubted whether I\nreally overheard at all what I am going to ask you about, or only\ndreamed it. I want you to tell me. The matter is this: When I was\ncoming out of that sleep of a century, the first impression of which I\nwas conscious was of voices talking around me, voices that afterwards I\nrecognized as your father's, your mother's, and your own. First, I\nremember your father's voice saying, \"He is going to open his eyes. He\nhad better see but one person at first.\" Then you said, if I did not\ndream it all, \"Promise me, then, that you will not tell him.\" Your\nfather seemed to hesitate about promising, but you insisted, and your\nmother interposing, he finally promised, and when I opened my eyes I\nsaw only him.\"\n\nI had been quite serious when I said that I was not sure that I had not\ndreamed the conversation I fancied I had overheard, so incomprehensible\nwas it that these people should know anything of me, a contemporary of\ntheir great-grandparents, which I did not know myself. But when I saw\nthe effect of my words upon Edith, I knew that it was no dream, but\nanother mystery, and a more puzzling one than any I had before\nencountered. For from the moment that the drift of my question became\napparent, she showed indications of the most acute embarrassment. Her\neyes, always so frank and direct in expression, had dropped in a panic\nbefore mine, while her face crimsoned from neck to forehead.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" I said, as soon as I had recovered from bewilderment at\nthe extraordinary effect of my words. \"It seems, then, that I was not\ndreaming. There is some secret, something about me, which you are\nwithholding from me. Really, doesn't it seem a little hard that a\nperson in my position should not be given all the information possible\nconcerning himself?\"\n\n\"It does not concern you--that is, not directly. It is not about you\nexactly,\" she replied, scarcely audibly.\n\n\"But it concerns me in some way,\" I persisted. \"It must be something\nthat would interest me.\"\n\n\"I don't know even that,\" she replied, venturing a momentary glance at\nmy face, furiously blushing, and yet with a quaint smile flickering\nabout her lips which betrayed a certain perception of humor in the\nsituation despite its embarrassment,--\"I am not sure that it would even\ninterest you.\"\n\n\"Your father would have told me,\" I insisted, with an accent of\nreproach. \"It was you who forbade him. He thought I ought to know.\"\n\nShe did not reply. She was so entirely charming in her confusion that I\nwas now prompted, as much by the desire to prolong the situation as by\nmy original curiosity, to importune her further.\n\n\"Am I never to know? Will you never tell me?\" I said.\n\n\"It depends,\" she answered, after a long pause.\n\n\"On what?\" I persisted.\n\n\"Ah, you ask too much,\" she replied. Then, raising to mine a face which\ninscrutable eyes, flushed cheeks, and smiling lips combined to render\nperfectly bewitching, she added, \"What should you think if I said that\nit depended on--yourself?\"\n\n\"On myself?\" I echoed. \"How can that possibly be?\"\n\n\"Mr. West, we are losing some charming music,\" was her only reply to\nthis, and turning to the telephone, at a touch of her finger she set\nthe air to swaying to the rhythm of an adagio. After that she took good\ncare that the music should leave no opportunity for conversation. She\nkept her face averted from me, and pretended to be absorbed in the\nairs, but that it was a mere pretense the crimson tide standing at\nflood in her cheeks sufficiently betrayed.\n\nWhen at length she suggested that I might have heard all I cared to,\nfor that time, and we rose to leave the room, she came straight up to\nme and said, without raising her eyes, \"Mr. West, you say I have been\ngood to you. I have not been particularly so, but if you think I have,\nI want you to promise me that you will not try again to make me tell\nyou this thing you have asked to-night, and that you will not try to\nfind it out from any one else,--my father or mother, for instance.\"\n\nTo such an appeal there was but one reply possible. \"Forgive me for\ndistressing you. Of course I will promise,\" I said. \"I would never have\nasked you if I had fancied it could distress you. But do you blame me\nfor being curious?\"\n\n\"I do not blame you at all.\"\n\n\"And some time,\" I added, \"if I do not tease you, you may tell me of\nyour own accord. May I not hope so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Only perhaps?\"\n\nLooking up, she read my face with a quick, deep glance. \"Yes,\" she\nsaid, \"I think I may tell you--some time\": and so our conversation\nended, for she gave me no chance to say anything more.\n\nThat night I don't think even Dr. Pillsbury could have put me to sleep,\ntill toward morning at least. Mysteries had been my accustomed food for\ndays now, but none had before confronted me at once so mysterious and\nso fascinating as this, the solution of which Edith Leete had forbidden\nme even to seek. It was a double mystery. How, in the first place, was\nit conceivable that she should know any secret about me, a stranger\nfrom a strange age? In the second place, even if she should know such a\nsecret, how account for the agitating effect which the knowledge of it\nseemed to have upon her? There are puzzles so difficult that one cannot\neven get so far as a conjecture as to the solution, and this seemed one\nof them. I am usually of too practical a turn to waste time on such\nconundrums; but the difficulty of a riddle embodied in a beautiful\nyoung girl does not detract from its fascination. In general, no doubt,\nmaidens' blushes may be safely assumed to tell the same tale to young\nmen in all ages and races, but to give that interpretation to Edith's\ncrimson cheeks would, considering my position and the length of time I\nhad known her, and still more the fact that this mystery dated from\nbefore I had known her at all, be a piece of utter fatuity. And yet she\nwas an angel, and I should not have been a young man if reason and\ncommon sense had been able quite to banish a roseate tinge from my\ndreams that night.\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\nIn the morning I went down stairs early in the hope of seeing Edith\nalone. In this, however, I was disappointed. Not finding her in the\nhouse, I sought her in the garden, but she was not there. In the course\nof my wanderings I visited the underground chamber, and sat down there\nto rest. Upon the reading table in the chamber several periodicals and\nnewspapers lay, and thinking that Dr. Leete might be interested in\nglancing over a Boston daily of 1887, I brought one of the papers with\nme into the house when I came.\n\nAt breakfast I met Edith. She blushed as she greeted me, but was\nperfectly self-possessed. As we sat at table, Dr. Leete amused himself\nwith looking over the paper I had brought in. There was in it, as in\nall the newspapers of that date, a great deal about the labor troubles,\nstrikes, lockouts, boycotts, the programmes of labor parties, and the\nwild threats of the anarchists.\n\n\"By the way,\" said I, as the doctor read aloud to us some of these\nitems, \"what part did the followers of the red flag take in the\nestablishment of the new order of things? They were making considerable\nnoise the last thing that I knew.\"\n\n\"They had nothing to do with it except to hinder it, of course,\"\nreplied Dr. Leete. \"They did that very effectually while they lasted,\nfor their talk so disgusted people as to deprive the best considered\nprojects for social reform of a hearing. The subsidizing of those\nfellows was one of the shrewdest moves of the opponents of reform.\"\n\n\"Subsidizing them!\" I exclaimed in astonishment.\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"No historical authority nowadays\ndoubts that they were paid by the great monopolies to wave the red flag\nand talk about burning, sacking, and blowing people up, in order, by\nalarming the timid, to head off any real reforms. What astonishes me\nmost is that you should have fallen into the trap so unsuspectingly.\"\n\n\"What are your grounds for believing that the red flag party was\nsubsidized?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Why simply because they must have seen that their course made a\nthousand enemies of their professed cause to one friend. Not to suppose\nthat they were hired for the work is to credit them with an\ninconceivable folly.[1] In the United States, of all countries, no\nparty could intelligently expect to carry its point without first\nwinning over to its ideas a majority of the nation, as the national\nparty eventually did.\"\n\n\"The national party!\" I exclaimed. \"That must have arisen after my day.\nI suppose it was one of the labor parties.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" replied the doctor. \"The labor parties, as such, never could\nhave accomplished anything on a large or permanent scale. For purposes\nof national scope, their basis as merely class organizations was too\nnarrow. It was not till a rearrangement of the industrial and social\nsystem on a higher ethical basis, and for the more efficient production\nof wealth, was recognized as the interest, not of one class, but\nequally of all classes, of rich and poor, cultured and ignorant, old\nand young, weak and strong, men and women, that there was any prospect\nthat it would be achieved. Then the national party arose to carry it\nout by political methods. It probably took that name because its aim\nwas to nationalize the functions of production and distribution.\nIndeed, it could not well have had any other name, for its purpose was\nto realize the idea of the nation with a grandeur and completeness\nnever before conceived, not as an association of men for certain merely\npolitical functions affecting their happiness only remotely and\nsuperficially, but as a family, a vital union, a common life, a mighty\nheaven-touching tree whose leaves are its people, fed from its veins,\nand feeding it in turn. The most patriotic of all possible parties, it\nsought to justify patriotism and raise it from an instinct to a\nrational devotion, by making the native land truly a father land, a\nfather who kept the people alive and was not merely an idol for which\nthey were expected to die.\"\n\n\n[1] I fully admit the difficulty of accounting for the course of the\nanarchists on any other theory than that they were subsidized by the\ncapitalists, but at the same time, there is no doubt that the theory is\nwholly erroneous. It certainly was not held at the time by any one,\nthough it may seem so obvious in the retrospect.\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\nThe personality of Edith Leete had naturally impressed me strongly ever\nsince I had come, in so strange a manner, to be an inmate of her\nfather's house, and it was to be expected that after what had happened\nthe night previous, I should be more than ever preoccupied with\nthoughts of her. From the first I had been struck with the air of\nserene frankness and ingenuous directness, more like that of a noble\nand innocent boy than any girl I had ever known, which characterized\nher. I was curious to know how far this charming quality might be\npeculiar to herself, and how far possibly a result of alterations in\nthe social position of women which might have taken place since my\ntime. Finding an opportunity that day, when alone with Dr. Leete, I\nturned the conversation in that direction.\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that women nowadays, having been relieved of the\nburden of housework, have no employment but the cultivation of their\ncharms and graces.\"\n\n\"So far as we men are concerned,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"we should\nconsider that they amply paid their way, to use one of your forms of\nexpression, if they confined themselves to that occupation, but you may\nbe very sure that they have quite too much spirit to consent to be mere\nbeneficiaries of society, even as a return for ornamenting it. They\ndid, indeed, welcome their riddance from housework, because that was\nnot only exceptionally wearing in itself, but also wasteful, in the\nextreme, of energy, as compared with the cooperative plan; but they\naccepted relief from that sort of work only that they might contribute\nin other and more effectual, as well as more agreeable, ways to the\ncommon weal. Our women, as well as our men, are members of the\nindustrial army, and leave it only when maternal duties claim them. The\nresult is that most women, at one time or another of their lives, serve\nindustrially some five or ten or fifteen years, while those who have no\nchildren fill out the full term.\"\n\n\"A woman does not, then, necessarily leave the industrial service on\nmarriage?\" I queried.\n\n\"No more than a man,\" replied the doctor. \"Why on earth should she?\nMarried women have no housekeeping responsibilities now, you know, and\na husband is not a baby that he should be cared for.\"\n\n\"It was thought one of the most grievous features of our civilization\nthat we required so much toil from women,\" I said; \"but it seems to me\nyou get more out of them than we did.\"\n\nDr. Leete laughed. \"Indeed we do, just as we do out of our men. Yet the\nwomen of this age are very happy, and those of the nineteenth century,\nunless contemporary references greatly mislead us, were very miserable.\nThe reason that women nowadays are so much more efficient colaborers\nwith the men, and at the same time are so happy, is that, in regard to\ntheir work as well as men's, we follow the principle of providing every\none the kind of occupation he or she is best adapted to. Women being\ninferior in strength to men, and further disqualified industrially in\nspecial ways, the kinds of occupation reserved for them, and the\nconditions under which they pursue them, have reference to these facts.\nThe heavier sorts of work are everywhere reserved for men, the lighter\noccupations for women. Under no circumstances is a woman permitted to\nfollow any employment not perfectly adapted, both as to kind and degree\nof labor, to her sex. Moreover, the hours of women's work are\nconsiderably shorter than those of men's, more frequent vacations are\ngranted, and the most careful provision is made for rest when needed.\nThe men of this day so well appreciate that they owe to the beauty and\ngrace of women the chief zest of their lives and their main incentive\nto effort, that they permit them to work at all only because it is\nfully understood that a certain regular requirement of labor, of a sort\nadapted to their powers, is well for body and mind, during the period\nof maximum physical vigor. We believe that the magnificent health which\ndistinguishes our women from those of your day, who seem to have been\nso generally sickly, is owing largely to the fact that all alike are\nfurnished with healthful and inspiriting occupation.\"\n\n\"I understood you,\" I said, \"that the women-workers belong to the army\nof industry, but how can they be under the same system of ranking and\ndiscipline with the men, when the conditions of their labor are so\ndifferent?\"\n\n\"They are under an entirely different discipline,\" replied Dr. Leete,\n\"and constitute rather an allied force than an integral part of the\narmy of the men. They have a woman general-in-chief and are under\nexclusively feminine regime. This general, as also the higher officers,\nis chosen by the body of women who have passed the time of service, in\ncorrespondence with the manner in which the chiefs of the masculine\narmy and the President of the nation are elected. The general of the\nwomen's army sits in the cabinet of the President and has a veto on\nmeasures respecting women's work, pending appeals to Congress. I should\nhave said, in speaking of the judiciary, that we have women on the\nbench, appointed by the general of the women, as well as men. Causes in\nwhich both parties are women are determined by women judges, and where\na man and a woman are parties to a case, a judge of either sex must\nconsent to the verdict.\"\n\n\"Womanhood seems to be organized as a sort of imperium in imperio in\nyour system,\" I said.\n\n\"To some extent,\" Dr. Leete replied; \"but the inner imperium is one\nfrom which you will admit there is not likely to be much danger to the\nnation. The lack of some such recognition of the distinct individuality\nof the sexes was one of the innumerable defects of your society. The\npassional attraction between men and women has too often prevented a\nperception of the profound differences which make the members of each\nsex in many things strange to the other, and capable of sympathy only\nwith their own. It is in giving full play to the differences of sex\nrather than in seeking to obliterate them, as was apparently the effort\nof some reformers in your day, that the enjoyment of each by itself and\nthe piquancy which each has for the other, are alike enhanced. In your\nday there was no career for women except in an unnatural rivalry with\nmen. We have given them a world of their own, with its emulations,\nambitions, and careers, and I assure you they are very happy in it. It\nseems to us that women were more than any other class the victims of\nyour civilization. There is something which, even at this distance of\ntime, penetrates one with pathos in the spectacle of their ennuied,\nundeveloped lives, stunted at marriage, their narrow horizon, bounded\nso often, physically, by the four walls of home, and morally by a petty\ncircle of personal interests. I speak now, not of the poorer classes,\nwho were generally worked to death, but also of the well-to-do and\nrich. From the great sorrows, as well as the petty frets of life, they\nhad no refuge in the breezy outdoor world of human affairs, nor any\ninterests save those of the family. Such an existence would have\nsoftened men's brains or driven them mad. All that is changed to-day.\nNo woman is heard nowadays wishing she were a man, nor parents desiring\nboy rather than girl children. Our girls are as full of ambition for\ntheir careers as our boys. Marriage, when it comes, does not mean\nincarceration for them, nor does it separate them in any way from the\nlarger interests of society, the bustling life of the world. Only when\nmaternity fills a woman's mind with new interests does she withdraw\nfrom the world for a time. Afterward, and at any time, she may return\nto her place among her comrades, nor need she ever lose touch with\nthem. Women are a very happy race nowadays, as compared with what they\never were before in the world's history, and their power of giving\nhappiness to men has been of course increased in proportion.\"\n\n\"I should imagine it possible,\" I said, \"that the interest which girls\ntake in their careers as members of the industrial army and candidates\nfor its distinctions might have an effect to deter them from marriage.\"\n\nDr. Leete smiled. \"Have no anxiety on that score, Mr. West,\" he\nreplied. \"The Creator took very good care that whatever other\nmodifications the dispositions of men and women might with time take\non, their attraction for each other should remain constant. The mere\nfact that in an age like yours, when the struggle for existence must\nhave left people little time for other thoughts, and the future was so\nuncertain that to assume parental responsibilities must have often\nseemed like a criminal risk, there was even then marrying and giving in\nmarriage, should be conclusive on this point. As for love nowadays, one\nof our authors says that the vacuum left in the minds of men and women\nby the absence of care for one's livelihood has been entirely taken up\nby the tender passion. That, however, I beg you to believe, is\nsomething of an exaggestion. For the rest, so far is marriage from\nbeing an interference with a woman's career, that the higher positions\nin the feminine army of industry are intrusted only to women who have\nbeen both wives and mothers, as they alone fully represent their sex.\"\n\n\"Are credit cards issued to the women just as to the men?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"The credits of the women, I suppose, are for smaller sums, owing to\nthe frequent suspension of their labor on account of family\nresponsibilities.\"\n\n\"Smaller!\" exclaimed Dr. Leete, \"oh, no! The maintenance of all our\npeople is the same. There are no exceptions to that rule, but if any\ndifference were made on account of the interruptions you speak of, it\nwould be by making the woman's credit larger, not smaller. Can you\nthink of any service constituting a stronger claim on the nation's\ngratitude than bearing and nursing the nation's children? According to\nour view, none deserve so well of the world as good parents. There is\nno task so unselfish, so necessarily without return, though the heart\nis well rewarded, as the nurture of the children who are to make the\nworld for one another when we are gone.\"\n\n\"It would seem to follow, from what you have said, that wives are in no\nway dependent on their husbands for maintenance.\"\n\n\"Of course they are not,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"nor children on their\nparents either, that is, for means of support, though of course they\nare for the offices of affection. The child's labor, when he grows up,\nwill go to increase the common stock, not his parents', who will be\ndead, and therefore he is properly nurtured out of the common stock.\nThe account of every person, man, woman, and child, you must\nunderstand, is always with the nation directly, and never through any\nintermediary, except, of course, that parents, to a certain extent, act\nfor children as their guardians. You see that it is by virtue of the\nrelation of individuals to the nation, of their membership in it, that\nthey are entitled to support; and this title is in no way connected\nwith or affected by their relations to other individuals who are fellow\nmembers of the nation with them. That any person should be dependent\nfor the means of support upon another would be shocking to the moral\nsense as well as indefensible on any rational social theory. What would\nbecome of personal liberty and dignity under such an arrangement? I am\naware that you called yourselves free in the nineteenth century. The\nmeaning of the word could not then, however, have been at all what it\nis at present, or you certainly would not have applied it to a society\nof which nearly every member was in a position of galling personal\ndependence upon others as to the very means of life, the poor upon the\nrich, or employed upon employer, women upon men, children upon parents.\nInstead of distributing the product of the nation directly to its\nmembers, which would seem the most natural and obvious method, it would\nactually appear that you had given your minds to devising a plan of\nhand to hand distribution, involving the maximum of personal\nhumiliation to all classes of recipients.\n\n\"As regards the dependence of women upon men for support, which then\nwas usual, of course, natural attraction in case of marriages of love\nmay often have made it endurable, though for spirited women I should\nfancy it must always have remained humiliating. What, then, must it\nhave been in the innumerable cases where women, with or without the\nform of marriage, had to sell themselves to men to get their living?\nEven your contemporaries, callous as they were to most of the revolting\naspects of their society, seem to have had an idea that this was not\nquite as it should be; but, it was still only for pity's sake that they\ndeplored the lot of the women. It did not occur to them that it was\nrobbery as well as cruelty when men seized for themselves the whole\nproduct of the world and left women to beg and wheedle for their share.\nWhy--but bless me, Mr. West, I am really running on at a remarkable\nrate, just as if the robbery, the sorrow, and the shame which those\npoor women endured were not over a century since, or as if you were\nresponsible for what you no doubt deplored as much as I do.\"\n\n\"I must bear my share of responsibility for the world as it then was,\"\nI replied. \"All I can say in extenuation is that until the nation was\nripe for the present system of organized production and distribution,\nno radical improvement in the position of woman was possible. The root\nof her disability, as you say, was her personal dependence upon man for\nher livelihood, and I can imagine no other mode of social organization\nthan that you have adopted, which would have set woman free of man at\nthe same time that it set men free of one another. I suppose, by the\nway, that so entire a change in the position of women cannot have taken\nplace without affecting in marked ways the social relations of the\nsexes. That will be a very interesting study for me.\"\n\n\"The change you will observe,\" said Dr. Leete, \"will chiefly be, I\nthink, the entire frankness and unconstraint which now characterizes\nthose relations, as compared with the artificiality which seems to have\nmarked them in your time. The sexes now meet with the ease of perfect\nequals, suitors to each other for nothing but love. In your time the\nfact that women were dependent for support on men made the woman in\nreality the one chiefly benefited by marriage. This fact, so far as we\ncan judge from contemporary records, appears to have been coarsely\nenough recognized among the lower classes, while among the more\npolished it was glossed over by a system of elaborate conventionalities\nwhich aimed to carry the precisely opposite meaning, namely, that the\nman was the party chiefly benefited. To keep up this convention it was\nessential that he should always seem the suitor. Nothing was therefore\nconsidered more shocking to the proprieties than that a woman should\nbetray a fondness for a man before he had indicated a desire to marry\nher. Why, we actually have in our libraries books, by authors of your\nday, written for no other purpose than to discuss the question whether,\nunder any conceivable circumstances, a woman might, without discredit\nto her sex, reveal an unsolicited love. All this seems exquisitely\nabsurd to us, and yet we know that, given your circumstances, the\nproblem might have a serious side. When for a woman to proffer her love\nto a man was in effect to invite him to assume the burden of her\nsupport, it is easy to see that pride and delicacy might well have\nchecked the promptings of the heart. When you go out into our society,\nMr. West, you must be prepared to be often cross-questioned on this\npoint by our young people, who are naturally much interested in this\naspect of old-fashioned manners.\"[1]\n\n\"And so the girls of the twentieth century tell their love.\"\n\n\"If they choose,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"There is no more pretense of a\nconcealment of feeling on their part than on the part of their lovers.\nCoquetry would be as much despised in a girl as in a man. Affected\ncoldness, which in your day rarely deceived a lover, would deceive him\nwholly now, for no one thinks of practicing it.\"\n\n\"One result which must follow from the independence of women I can see\nfor myself,\" I said. \"There can be no marriages now except those of\ninclination.\"\n\n\"That is a matter of course,\" replied Dr. Leete.\n\n\"Think of a world in which there are nothing but matches of pure love!\nAh me, Dr. Leete, how far you are from being able to understand what an\nastonishing phenomenon such a world seems to a man of the nineteenth\ncentury!\"\n\n\"I can, however, to some extent, imagine it,\" replied the doctor. \"But\nthe fact you celebrate, that there are nothing but love matches, means\neven more, perhaps, than you probably at first realize. It means that\nfor the first time in human history the principle of sexual selection,\nwith its tendency to preserve and transmit the better types of the\nrace, and let the inferior types drop out, has unhindered operation.\nThe necessities of poverty, the need of having a home, no longer tempt\nwomen to accept as the fathers of their children men whom they neither\ncan love nor respect. Wealth and rank no longer divert attention from\npersonal qualities. Gold no longer 'gilds the straitened forehead of\nthe fool.' The gifts of person, mind, and disposition; beauty, wit,\neloquence, kindness, generosity, geniality, courage, are sure of\ntransmission to posterity. Every generation is sifted through a little\nfiner mesh than the last. The attributes that human nature admires are\npreserved, those that repel it are left behind. There are, of course, a\ngreat many women who with love must mingle admiration, and seek to wed\ngreatly, but these not the less obey the same law, for to wed greatly\nnow is not to marry men of fortune or title, but those who have risen\nabove their fellows by the solidity or brilliance of their services to\nhumanity. These form nowadays the only aristocracy with which alliance\nis distinction.\n\n\"You were speaking, a day or two ago, of the physical superiority of\nour people to your contemporaries. Perhaps more important than any of\nthe causes I mentioned then as tending to race purification has been\nthe effect of untrammeled sexual selection upon the quality of two or\nthree successive generations. I believe that when you have made a\nfuller study of our people you will find in them not only a physical,\nbut a mental and moral improvement. It would be strange if it were not\nso, for not only is one of the great laws of nature now freely working\nout the salvation of the race, but a profound moral sentiment has come\nto its support. Individualism, which in your day was the animating idea\nof society, not only was fatal to any vital sentiment of brotherhood\nand common interest among living men, but equally to any realization of\nthe responsibility of the living for the generation to follow. To-day\nthis sense of responsibility, practically unrecognized in all previous\nages, has become one of the great ethical ideas of the race,\nreinforcing, with an intense conviction of duty, the natural impulse to\nseek in marriage the best and noblest of the other sex. The result is,\nthat not all the encouragements and incentives of every sort which we\nhave provided to develop industry, talent, genius, excellence of\nwhatever kind, are comparable in their effect on our young men with the\nfact that our women sit aloft as judges of the race and reserve\nthemselves to reward the winners. Of all the whips, and spurs, and\nbaits, and prizes, there is none like the thought of the radiant faces\nwhich the laggards will find averted.\n\n\"Celibates nowadays are almost invariably men who have failed to acquit\nthemselves creditably in the work of life. The woman must be a\ncourageous one, with a very evil sort of courage, too, whom pity for\none of these unfortunates should lead to defy the opinion of her\ngeneration--for otherwise she is free--so far as to accept him for a\nhusband. I should add that, more exacting and difficult to resist than\nany other element in that opinion, she would find the sentiment of her\nown sex. Our women have risen to the full height of their\nresponsibility as the wardens of the world to come, to whose keeping\nthe keys of the future are confided. Their feeling of duty in this\nrespect amounts to a sense of religious consecration. It is a cult in\nwhich they educate their daughters from childhood.\"\n\nAfter going to my room that night, I sat up late to read a romance of\nBerrian, handed me by Dr. Leete, the plot of which turned on a\nsituation suggested by his last words, concerning the modern view of\nparental responsibility. A similar situation would almost certainly\nhave been treated by a nineteenth century romancist so as to excite the\nmorbid sympathy of the reader with the sentimental selfishness of the\nlovers, and his resentment toward the unwritten law which they\noutraged. I need not describe--for who has not read \"Ruth Elton\"?--how\ndifferent is the course which Berrian takes, and with what tremendous\neffect he enforces the principle which he states: \"Over the unborn our\npower is that of God, and our responsibility like His toward us. As we\nacquit ourselves toward them, so let Him deal with us.\"\n\n\n[1] I may say that Dr. Leete's warning has been fully justified by my\nexperience. The amount and intensity of amusement which the young\npeople of this day, and the young women especially, are able to extract\nfrom what they are pleased to call the oddities of courtship in the\nnineteenth century, appear unlimited.\n\n\n\nChapter 26\n\nI think if a person were ever excusable for losing track of the days of\nthe week, the circumstances excused me. Indeed, if I had been told that\nthe method of reckoning time had been wholly changed and the days were\nnow counted in lots of five, ten, or fifteen instead of seven, I should\nhave been in no way surprised after what I had already heard and seen\nof the twentieth century. The first time that any inquiry as to the\ndays of the week occurred to me was the morning following the\nconversation related in the last chapter. At the breakfast table Dr.\nLeete asked me if I would care to hear a sermon.\n\n\"Is it Sunday, then?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"It was on Friday, you see, when we made the lucky\ndiscovery of the buried chamber to which we owe your society this\nmorning. It was on Saturday morning, soon after midnight, that you\nfirst awoke, and Sunday afternoon when you awoke the second time with\nfaculties fully regained.\"\n\n\"So you still have Sundays and sermons,\" I said. \"We had prophets who\nforetold that long before this time the world would have dispensed with\nboth. I am very curious to know how the ecclesiastical systems fit in\nwith the rest of your social arrangements. I suppose you have a sort of\nnational church with official clergymen.\"\n\nDr. Leete laughed, and Mrs. Leete and Edith seemed greatly amused.\n\n\"Why, Mr. West,\" Edith said, \"what odd people you must think us. You\nwere quite done with national religious establishments in the\nnineteenth century, and did you fancy we had gone back to them?\"\n\n\"But how can voluntary churches and an unofficial clerical profession\nbe reconciled with national ownership of all buildings, and the\nindustrial service required of all men?\" I answered.\n\n\"The religious practices of the people have naturally changed\nconsiderably in a century,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"but supposing them to\nhave remained unchanged, our social system would accommodate them\nperfectly. The nation supplies any person or number of persons with\nbuildings on guarantee of the rent, and they remain tenants while they\npay it. As for the clergymen, if a number of persons wish the services\nof an individual for any particular end of their own, apart from the\ngeneral service of the nation, they can always secure it, with that\nindividual's own consent, of course, just as we secure the service of\nour editors, by contributing from their credit cards an indemnity to\nthe nation for the loss of his services in general industry. This\nindemnity paid the nation for the individual answers to the salary in\nyour day paid to the individual himself; and the various applications\nof this principle leave private initiative full play in all details to\nwhich national control is not applicable. Now, as to hearing a sermon\nto-day, if you wish to do so, you can either go to a church to hear it\nor stay at home.\"\n\n\"How am I to hear it if I stay at home?\"\n\n\"Simply by accompanying us to the music room at the proper hour and\nselecting an easy chair. There are some who still prefer to hear\nsermons in church, but most of our preaching, like our musical\nperformances, is not in public, but delivered in acoustically prepared\nchambers, connected by wire with subscribers' houses. If you prefer to\ngo to a church I shall be glad to accompany you, but I really don't\nbelieve you are likely to hear anywhere a better discourse than you\nwill at home. I see by the paper that Mr. Barton is to preach this\nmorning, and he preaches only by telephone, and to audiences often\nreaching 150,000.\"\n\n\"The novelty of the experience of hearing a sermon under such\ncircumstances would incline me to be one of Mr. Barton's hearers, if\nfor no other reason,\" I said.\n\nAn hour or two later, as I sat reading in the library, Edith came for\nme, and I followed her to the music room, where Dr. and Mrs. Leete were\nwaiting. We had not more than seated ourselves comfortably when the\ntinkle of a bell was heard, and a few moments after the voice of a man,\nat the pitch of ordinary conversation, addressed us, with an effect of\nproceeding from an invisible person in the room. This was what the\nvoice said:\n\n\nMR. BARTON'S SERMON\n\n\"We have had among us, during the past week, a critic from the\nnineteenth century, a living representative of the epoch of our\ngreat-grandparents. It would be strange if a fact so extraordinary had\nnot somewhat strongly affected our imaginations. Perhaps most of us\nhave been stimulated to some effort to realize the society of a century\nago, and figure to ourselves what it must have been like to live then.\nIn inviting you now to consider certain reflections upon this subject\nwhich have occurred to me, I presume that I shall rather follow than\ndivert the course of your own thoughts.\"\n\n\nEdith whispered something to her father at this point, to which he\nnodded assent and turned to me.\n\n\"Mr. West,\" he said, \"Edith suggests that you may find it slightly\nembarrassing to listen to a discourse on the lines Mr. Barton is laying\ndown, and if so, you need not be cheated out of a sermon. She will\nconnect us with Mr. Sweetser's speaking room if you say so, and I can\nstill promise you a very good discourse.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I said. \"Believe me, I would much rather hear what Mr. Barton\nhas to say.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" replied my host.\n\nWhen her father spoke to me Edith had touched a screw, and the voice of\nMr. Barton had ceased abruptly. Now at another touch the room was once\nmore filled with the earnest sympathetic tones which had already\nimpressed me most favorably.\n\n\"I venture to assume that one effect has been common with us as a\nresult of this effort at retrospection, and that it has been to leave\nus more than ever amazed at the stupendous change which one brief\ncentury has made in the material and moral conditions of humanity.\n\n\"Still, as regards the contrast between the poverty of the nation and\nthe world in the nineteenth century and their wealth now, it is not\ngreater, possibly, than had been before seen in human history, perhaps\nnot greater, for example, than that between the poverty of this country\nduring the earliest colonial period of the seventeenth century and the\nrelatively great wealth it had attained at the close of the nineteenth,\nor between the England of William the Conqueror and that of Victoria.\nAlthough the aggregate riches of a nation did not then, as now, afford\nany accurate criterion of the masses of its people, yet instances like\nthese afford partial parallels for the merely material side of the\ncontrast between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. It is when\nwe contemplate the moral aspect of that contrast that we find ourselves\nin the presence of a phenomenon for which history offers no precedent,\nhowever far back we may cast our eye. One might almost be excused who\nshould exclaim, 'Here, surely, is something like a miracle!'\nNevertheless, when we give over idle wonder, and begin to examine the\nseeming prodigy critically, we find it no prodigy at all, much less a\nmiracle. It is not necessary to suppose a moral new birth of humanity,\nor a wholesale destruction of the wicked and survival of the good, to\naccount for the fact before us. It finds its simple and obvious\nexplanation in the reaction of a changed environment upon human nature.\nIt means merely that a form of society which was founded on the pseudo\nself-interest of selfishness, and appealed solely to the anti-social\nand brutal side of human nature, has been replaced by institutions\nbased on the true self-interest of a rational unselfishness, and\nappealing to the social and generous instincts of men.\n\n\"My friends, if you would see men again the beasts of prey they seemed\nin the nineteenth century, all you have to do is to restore the old\nsocial and industrial system, which taught them to view their natural\nprey in their fellow-men, and find their gain in the loss of others. No\ndoubt it seems to you that no necessity, however dire, would have\ntempted you to subsist on what superior skill or strength enabled you\nto wrest from others equally needy. But suppose it were not merely your\nown life that you were responsible for. I know well that there must\nhave been many a man among our ancestors who, if it had been merely a\nquestion of his own life, would sooner have given it up than nourished\nit by bread snatched from others. But this he was not permitted to do.\nHe had dear lives dependent on him. Men loved women in those days, as\nnow. God knows how they dared be fathers, but they had babies as sweet,\nno doubt, to them as ours to us, whom they must feed, clothe, educate.\nThe gentlest creatures are fierce when they have young to provide for,\nand in that wolfish society the struggle for bread borrowed a peculiar\ndesperation from the tenderest sentiments. For the sake of those\ndependent on him, a man might not choose, but must plunge into the foul\nfight--cheat, overreach, supplant, defraud, buy below worth and sell\nabove, break down the business by which his neighbor fed his young\nones, tempt men to buy what they ought not and to sell what they should\nnot, grind his laborers, sweat his debtors, cozen his creditors. Though\na man sought it carefully with tears, it was hard to find a way in\nwhich he could earn a living and provide for his family except by\npressing in before some weaker rival and taking the food from his\nmouth. Even the ministers of religion were not exempt from this cruel\nnecessity. While they warned their flocks against the love of money,\nregard for their families compelled them to keep an outlook for the\npecuniary prizes of their calling. Poor fellows, theirs was indeed a\ntrying business, preaching to men a generosity and unselfishness which\nthey and everybody knew would, in the existing state of the world,\nreduce to poverty those who should practice them, laying down laws of\nconduct which the law of self-preservation compelled men to break.\nLooking on the inhuman spectacle of society, these worthy men bitterly\nbemoaned the depravity of human nature; as if angelic nature would not\nhave been debauched in such a devil's school! Ah, my friends, believe\nme, it is not now in this happy age that humanity is proving the\ndivinity within it. It was rather in those evil days when not even the\nfight for life with one another, the struggle for mere existence, in\nwhich mercy was folly, could wholly banish generosity and kindness from\nthe earth.\n\n\"It is not hard to understand the desperation with which men and women,\nwho under other conditions would have been full of gentleness and\ntruth, fought and tore each other in the scramble for gold, when we\nrealize what it meant to miss it, what poverty was in that day. For the\nbody it was hunger and thirst, torment by heat and frost, in sickness\nneglect, in health unremitting toil; for the moral nature it meant\noppression, contempt, and the patient endurance of indignity, brutish\nassociations from infancy, the loss of all the innocence of childhood,\nthe grace of womanhood, the dignity of manhood; for the mind it meant\nthe death of ignorance, the torpor of all those faculties which\ndistinguish us from brutes, the reduction of life to a round of bodily\nfunctions.\n\n\"Ah, my friends, if such a fate as this were offered you and your\nchildren as the only alternative of success in the accumulation of\nwealth, how long do you fancy would you be in sinking to the moral\nlevel of your ancestors?\n\n\"Some two or three centuries ago an act of barbarity was committed in\nIndia, which, though the number of lives destroyed was but a few score,\nwas attended by such peculiar horrors that its memory is likely to be\nperpetual. A number of English prisoners were shut up in a room\ncontaining not enough air to supply one-tenth their number. The\nunfortunates were gallant men, devoted comrades in service, but, as the\nagonies of suffocation began to take hold on them, they forgot all\nelse, and became involved in a hideous struggle, each one for himself,\nand against all others, to force a way to one of the small apertures of\nthe prison at which alone it was possible to get a breath of air. It\nwas a struggle in which men became beasts, and the recital of its\nhorrors by the few survivors so shocked our forefathers that for a\ncentury later we find it a stock reference in their literature as a\ntypical illustration of the extreme possibilities of human misery, as\nshocking in its moral as its physical aspect. They could scarcely have\nanticipated that to us the Black Hole of Calcutta, with its press of\nmaddened men tearing and trampling one another in the struggle to win a\nplace at the breathing holes, would seem a striking type of the society\nof their age. It lacked something of being a complete type, however,\nfor in the Calcutta Black Hole there were no tender women, no little\nchildren and old men and women, no cripples. They were at least all\nmen, strong to bear, who suffered.\n\n\"When we reflect that the ancient order of which I have been speaking\nwas prevalent up to the end of the nineteenth century, while to us the\nnew order which succeeded it already seems antique, even our parents\nhaving known no other, we cannot fail to be astounded at the suddenness\nwith which a transition so profound beyond all previous experience of\nthe race must have been effected. Some observation of the state of\nmen's minds during the last quarter of the nineteenth century will,\nhowever, in great measure, dissipate this astonishment. Though general\nintelligence in the modern sense could not be said to exist in any\ncommunity at that time, yet, as compared with previous generations, the\none then on the stage was intelligent. The inevitable consequence of\neven this comparative degree of intelligence had been a perception of\nthe evils of society, such as had never before been general. It is\nquite true that these evils had been even worse, much worse, in\nprevious ages. It was the increased intelligence of the masses which\nmade the difference, as the dawn reveals the squalor of surroundings\nwhich in the darkness may have seemed tolerable. The key-note of the\nliterature of the period was one of compassion for the poor and\nunfortunate, and indignant outcry against the failure of the social\nmachinery to ameliorate the miseries of men. It is plain from these\noutbursts that the moral hideousness of the spectacle about them was,\nat least by flashes, fully realized by the best of the men of that\ntime, and that the lives of some of the more sensitive and generous\nhearted of them were rendered well nigh unendurable by the intensity of\ntheir sympathies.\n\n\"Although the idea of the vital unity of the family of mankind, the\nreality of human brotherhood, was very far from being apprehended by\nthem as the moral axiom it seems to us, yet it is a mistake to suppose\nthat there was no feeling at all corresponding to it. I could read you\npassages of great beauty from some of their writers which show that the\nconception was clearly attained by a few, and no doubt vaguely by many\nmore. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the nineteenth century\nwas in name Christian, and the fact that the entire commercial and\nindustrial frame of society was the embodiment of the anti-Christian\nspirit must have had some weight, though I admit it was strangely\nlittle, with the nominal followers of Jesus Christ.\n\n\"When we inquire why it did not have more, why, in general, long after\na vast majority of men had agreed as to the crying abuses of the\nexisting social arrangement, they still tolerated it, or contented\nthemselves with talking of petty reforms in it, we come upon an\nextraordinary fact. It was the sincere belief of even the best of men\nat that epoch that the only stable elements in human nature, on which a\nsocial system could be safely founded, were its worst propensities.\nThey had been taught and believed that greed and self-seeking were all\nthat held mankind together, and that all human associations would fall\nto pieces if anything were done to blunt the edge of these motives or\ncurb their operation. In a word, they believed--even those who longed\nto believe otherwise--the exact reverse of what seems to us\nself-evident; they believed, that is, that the anti-social qualities of\nmen, and not their social qualities, were what furnished the cohesive\nforce of society. It seemed reasonable to them that men lived together\nsolely for the purpose of overreaching and oppressing one another, and\nof being overreached and oppressed, and that while a society that gave\nfull scope to these propensities could stand, there would be little\nchance for one based on the idea of cooperation for the benefit of all.\nIt seems absurd to expect any one to believe that convictions like\nthese were ever seriously entertained by men; but that they were not\nonly entertained by our great-grandfathers, but were responsible for\nthe long delay in doing away with the ancient order, after a conviction\nof its intolerable abuses had become general, is as well established as\nany fact in history can be. Just here you will find the explanation of\nthe profound pessimism of the literature of the last quarter of the\nnineteenth century, the note of melancholy in its poetry, and the\ncynicism of its humor.\n\n\"Feeling that the condition of the race was unendurable, they had no\nclear hope of anything better. They believed that the evolution of\nhumanity had resulted in leading it into a cul de sac, and that there\nwas no way of getting forward. The frame of men's minds at this time is\nstrikingly illustrated by treatises which have come down to us, and may\neven now be consulted in our libraries by the curious, in which\nlaborious arguments are pursued to prove that despite the evil plight\nof men, life was still, by some slight preponderance of considerations,\nprobably better worth living than leaving. Despising themselves, they\ndespised their Creator. There was a general decay of religious belief.\nPale and watery gleams, from skies thickly veiled by doubt and dread,\nalone lighted up the chaos of earth. That men should doubt Him whose\nbreath is in their nostrils, or dread the hands that moulded them,\nseems to us indeed a pitiable insanity; but we must remember that\nchildren who are brave by day have sometimes foolish fears at night.\nThe dawn has come since then. It is very easy to believe in the\nfatherhood of God in the twentieth century.\n\n\"Briefly, as must needs be in a discourse of this character, I have\nadverted to some of the causes which had prepared men's minds for the\nchange from the old to the new order, as well as some causes of the\nconservatism of despair which for a while held it back after the time\nwas ripe. To wonder at the rapidity with which the change was completed\nafter its possibility was first entertained is to forget the\nintoxicating effect of hope upon minds long accustomed to despair. The\nsunburst, after so long and dark a night, must needs have had a\ndazzling effect. From the moment men allowed themselves to believe that\nhumanity after all had not been meant for a dwarf, that its squat\nstature was not the measure of its possible growth, but that it stood\nupon the verge of an avatar of limitless development, the reaction must\nneeds have been overwhelming. It is evident that nothing was able to\nstand against the enthusiasm which the new faith inspired.\n\n\"Here, at last, men must have felt, was a cause compared with which the\ngrandest of historic causes had been trivial. It was doubtless because\nit could have commanded millions of martyrs, that none were needed. The\nchange of a dynasty in a petty kingdom of the old world often cost more\nlives than did the revolution which set the feet of the human race at\nlast in the right way.\n\n\"Doubtless it ill beseems one to whom the boon of life in our\nresplendent age has been vouchsafed to wish his destiny other, and yet\nI have often thought that I would fain exchange my share in this serene\nand golden day for a place in that stormy epoch of transition, when\nheroes burst the barred gate of the future and revealed to the kindling\ngaze of a hopeless race, in place of the blank wall that had closed its\npath, a vista of progress whose end, for very excess of light, still\ndazzles us. Ah, my friends! who will say that to have lived then, when\nthe weakest influence was a lever to whose touch the centuries\ntrembled, was not worth a share even in this era of fruition?\n\n\"You know the story of that last, greatest, and most bloodless of\nrevolutions. In the time of one generation men laid aside the social\ntraditions and practices of barbarians, and assumed a social order\nworthy of rational and human beings. Ceasing to be predatory in their\nhabits, they became co-workers, and found in fraternity, at once, the\nscience of wealth and happiness. 'What shall I eat and drink, and\nwherewithal shall I be clothed?' stated as a problem beginning and\nending in self, had been an anxious and an endless one. But when once\nit was conceived, not from the individual, but the fraternal\nstandpoint, 'What shall we eat and drink, and wherewithal shall we be\nclothed?'--its difficulties vanished.\n\n\"Poverty with servitude had been the result, for the mass of humanity,\nof attempting to solve the problem of maintenance from the individual\nstandpoint, but no sooner had the nation become the sole capitalist and\nemployer than not alone did plenty replace poverty, but the last\nvestige of the serfdom of man to man disappeared from earth. Human\nslavery, so often vainly scotched, at last was killed. The means of\nsubsistence no longer doled out by men to women, by employer to\nemployed, by rich to poor, was distributed from a common stock as among\nchildren at the father's table. It was impossible for a man any longer\nto use his fellow-men as tools for his own profit. His esteem was the\nonly sort of gain he could thenceforth make out of him. There was no\nmore either arrogance or servility in the relations of human beings to\none another. For the first time since the creation every man stood up\nstraight before God. The fear of want and the lust of gain became\nextinct motives when abundance was assured to all and immoderate\npossessions made impossible of attainment. There were no more beggars\nnor almoners. Equity left charity without an occupation. The ten\ncommandments became well nigh obsolete in a world where there was no\ntemptation to theft, no occasion to lie either for fear or favor, no\nroom for envy where all were equal, and little provocation to violence\nwhere men were disarmed of power to injure one another. Humanity's\nancient dream of liberty, equality, fraternity, mocked by so many ages,\nat last was realized.\n\n\"As in the old society the generous, the just, the tender-hearted had\nbeen placed at a disadvantage by the possession of those qualities; so\nin the new society the cold-hearted, the greedy, and self-seeking found\nthemselves out of joint with the world. Now that the conditions of life\nfor the first time ceased to operate as a forcing process to develop\nthe brutal qualities of human nature, and the premium which had\nheretofore encouraged selfishness was not only removed, but placed upon\nunselfishness, it was for the first time possible to see what\nunperverted human nature really was like. The depraved tendencies,\nwhich had previously overgrown and obscured the better to so large an\nextent, now withered like cellar fungi in the open air, and the nobler\nqualities showed a sudden luxuriance which turned cynics into\npanegyrists and for the first time in human history tempted mankind to\nfall in love with itself. Soon was fully revealed, what the divines and\nphilosophers of the old world never would have believed, that human\nnature in its essential qualities is good, not bad, that men by their\nnatural intention and structure are generous, not selfish, pitiful, not\ncruel, sympathetic, not arrogant, godlike in aspirations, instinct with\ndivinest impulses of tenderness and self-sacrifice, images of God\nindeed, not the travesties upon Him they had seemed. The constant\npressure, through numberless generations, of conditions of life which\nmight have perverted angels, had not been able to essentially alter the\nnatural nobility of the stock, and these conditions once removed, like\na bent tree, it had sprung back to its normal uprightness.\n\n\"To put the whole matter in the nutshell of a parable, let me compare\nhumanity in the olden time to a rosebush planted in a swamp, watered\nwith black bog-water, breathing miasmatic fogs by day, and chilled with\npoison dews at night. Innumerable generations of gardeners had done\ntheir best to make it bloom, but beyond an occasional half-opened bud\nwith a worm at the heart, their efforts had been unsuccessful. Many,\nindeed, claimed that the bush was no rosebush at all, but a noxious\nshrub, fit only to be uprooted and burned. The gardeners, for the most\npart, however, held that the bush belonged to the rose family, but had\nsome ineradicable taint about it, which prevented the buds from coming\nout, and accounted for its generally sickly condition. There were a\nfew, indeed, who maintained that the stock was good enough, that the\ntrouble was in the bog, and that under more favorable conditions the\nplant might be expected to do better. But these persons were not\nregular gardeners, and being condemned by the latter as mere theorists\nand day dreamers, were, for the most part, so regarded by the people.\nMoreover, urged some eminent moral philosophers, even conceding for the\nsake of the argument that the bush might possibly do better elsewhere,\nit was a more valuable discipline for the buds to try to bloom in a bog\nthan it would be under more favorable conditions. The buds that\nsucceeded in opening might indeed be very rare, and the flowers pale\nand scentless, but they represented far more moral effort than if they\nhad bloomed spontaneously in a garden.\n\n\"The regular gardeners and the moral philosophers had their way. The\nbush remained rooted in the bog, and the old course of treatment went\non. Continually new varieties of forcing mixtures were applied to the\nroots, and more recipes than could be numbered, each declared by its\nadvocates the best and only suitable preparation, were used to kill the\nvermin and remove the mildew. This went on a very long time.\nOccasionally some one claimed to observe a slight improvement in the\nappearance of the bush, but there were quite as many who declared that\nit did not look so well as it used to. On the whole there could not be\nsaid to be any marked change. Finally, during a period of general\ndespondency as to the prospects of the bush where it was, the idea of\ntransplanting it was again mooted, and this time found favor. 'Let us\ntry it,' was the general voice. 'Perhaps it may thrive better\nelsewhere, and here it is certainly doubtful if it be worth cultivating\nlonger.' So it came about that the rosebush of humanity was\ntransplanted, and set in sweet, warm, dry earth, where the sun bathed\nit, the stars wooed it, and the south wind caressed it. Then it\nappeared that it was indeed a rosebush. The vermin and the mildew\ndisappeared, and the bush was covered with most beautiful red roses,\nwhose fragrance filled the world.\n\n\"It is a pledge of the destiny appointed for us that the Creator has\nset in our hearts an infinite standard of achievement, judged by which\nour past attainments seem always insignificant, and the goal never\nnearer. Had our forefathers conceived a state of society in which men\nshould live together like brethren dwelling in unity, without strifes\nor envying, violence or overreaching, and where, at the price of a\ndegree of labor not greater than health demands, in their chosen\noccupations, they should be wholly freed from care for the morrow and\nleft with no more concern for their livelihood than trees which are\nwatered by unfailing streams,--had they conceived such a condition, I\nsay, it would have seemed to them nothing less than paradise. They\nwould have confounded it with their idea of heaven, nor dreamed that\nthere could possibly lie further beyond anything to be desired or\nstriven for.\n\n\"But how is it with us who stand on this height which they gazed up to?\nAlready we have well nigh forgotten, except when it is especially\ncalled to our minds by some occasion like the present, that it was not\nalways with men as it is now. It is a strain on our imaginations to\nconceive the social arrangements of our immediate ancestors. We find\nthem grotesque. The solution of the problem of physical maintenance so\nas to banish care and crime, so far from seeming to us an ultimate\nattainment, appears but as a preliminary to anything like real human\nprogress. We have but relieved ourselves of an impertinent and needless\nharassment which hindered our ancestor from undertaking the real ends\nof existence. We are merely stripped for the race; no more. We are like\na child which has just learned to stand upright and to walk. It is a\ngreat event, from the child's point of view, when he first walks.\nPerhaps he fancies that there can be little beyond that achievement,\nbut a year later he has forgotten that he could not always walk. His\nhorizon did but widen when he rose, and enlarge as he moved. A great\nevent indeed, in one sense, was his first step, but only as a\nbeginning, not as the end. His true career was but then first entered\non. The enfranchisement of humanity in the last century, from mental\nand physical absorption in working and scheming for the mere bodily\nnecessities, may be regarded as a species of second birth of the race,\nwithout which its first birth to an existence that was but a burden\nwould forever have remained unjustified, but whereby it is now\nabundantly vindicated. Since then, humanity has entered on a new phase\nof spiritual development, an evolution of higher faculties, the very\nexistence of which in human nature our ancestors scarcely suspected. In\nplace of the dreary hopelessness of the nineteenth century, its\nprofound pessimism as to the future of humanity, the animating idea of\nthe present age is an enthusiastic conception of the opportunities of\nour earthly existence, and the unbounded possibilities of human nature.\nThe betterment of mankind from generation to generation, physically,\nmentally, morally, is recognized as the one great object supremely\nworthy of effort and of sacrifice. We believe the race for the first\ntime to have entered on the realization of God's ideal of it, and each\ngeneration must now be a step upward.\n\n\"Do you ask what we look for when unnumbered generations shall have\npassed away? I answer, the way stretches far before us, but the end is\nlost in light. For twofold is the return of man to God 'who is our\nhome,' the return of the individual by the way of death, and the return\nof the race by the fulfillment of the evolution, when the divine secret\nhidden in the germ shall be perfectly unfolded. With a tear for the\ndark past, turn we then to the dazzling future, and, veiling our eyes,\npress forward. The long and weary winter of the race is ended. Its\nsummer has begun. Humanity has burst the chrysalis. The heavens are\nbefore it.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 27\n\nI never could tell just why, but Sunday afternoon during my old life\nhad been a time when I was peculiarly subject to melancholy, when the\ncolor unaccountably faded out of all the aspects of life, and\neverything appeared pathetically uninteresting. The hours, which in\ngeneral were wont to bear me easily on their wings, lost the power of\nflight, and toward the close of the day, drooping quite to earth, had\nfairly to be dragged along by main strength. Perhaps it was partly\nowing to the established association of ideas that, despite the utter\nchange in my circumstances, I fell into a state of profound depression\non the afternoon of this my first Sunday in the twentieth century.\n\nIt was not, however, on the present occasion a depression without\nspecific cause, the mere vague melancholy I have spoken of, but a\nsentiment suggested and certainly quite justified by my position. The\nsermon of Mr. Barton, with its constant implication of the vast moral\ngap between the century to which I belonged and that in which I found\nmyself, had had an effect strongly to accentuate my sense of loneliness\nin it. Considerately and philosophically as he had spoken, his words\ncould scarcely have failed to leave upon my mind a strong impression of\nthe mingled pity, curiosity, and aversion which I, as a representative\nof an abhorred epoch, must excite in all around me.\n\nThe extraordinary kindness with which I had been treated by Dr. Leete\nand his family, and especially the goodness of Edith, had hitherto\nprevented my fully realizing that their real sentiment toward me must\nnecessarily be that of the whole generation to which they belonged. The\nrecognition of this, as regarded Dr. Leete and his amiable wife,\nhowever painful, I might have endured, but the conviction that Edith\nmust share their feeling was more than I could bear.\n\nThe crushing effect with which this belated perception of a fact so\nobvious came to me opened my eyes fully to something which perhaps the\nreader has already suspected,--I loved Edith.\n\nWas it strange that I did? The affecting occasion on which our intimacy\nhad begun, when her hands had drawn me out of the whirlpool of madness;\nthe fact that her sympathy was the vital breath which had set me up in\nthis new life and enabled me to support it; my habit of looking to her\nas the mediator between me and the world around in a sense that even\nher father was not,--these were circumstances that had predetermined a\nresult which her remarkable loveliness of person and disposition would\nalone have accounted for. It was quite inevitable that she should have\ncome to seem to me, in a sense quite different from the usual\nexperience of lovers, the only woman in this world. Now that I had\nbecome suddenly sensible of the fatuity of the hopes I had begun to\ncherish, I suffered not merely what another lover might, but in\naddition a desolate loneliness, an utter forlornness, such as no other\nlover, however unhappy, could have felt.\n\nMy hosts evidently saw that I was depressed in spirits, and did their\nbest to divert me. Edith especially, I could see, was distressed for\nme, but according to the usual perversity of lovers, having once been\nso mad as to dream of receiving something more from her, there was no\nlonger any virtue for me in a kindness that I knew was only sympathy.\n\nToward nightfall, after secluding myself in my room most of the\nafternoon, I went into the garden to walk about. The day was overcast,\nwith an autumnal flavor in the warm, still air. Finding myself near the\nexcavation, I entered the subterranean chamber and sat down there.\n\"This,\" I muttered to myself, \"is the only home I have. Let me stay\nhere, and not go forth any more.\" Seeking aid from the familiar\nsurroundings, I endeavored to find a sad sort of consolation in\nreviving the past and summoning up the forms and faces that were about\nme in my former life. It was in vain. There was no longer any life in\nthem. For nearly one hundred years the stars had been looking down on\nEdith Bartlett's grave, and the graves of all my generation.\n\nThe past was dead, crushed beneath a century's weight, and from the\npresent I was shut out. There was no place for me anywhere. I was\nneither dead nor properly alive.\n\n\"Forgive me for following you.\"\n\nI looked up. Edith stood in the door of the subterranean room,\nregarding me smilingly, but with eyes full of sympathetic distress.\n\n\"Send me away if I am intruding on you,\" she said; \"but we saw that you\nwere out of spirits, and you know you promised to let me know if that\nwere so. You have not kept your word.\"\n\nI rose and came to the door, trying to smile, but making, I fancy,\nrather sorry work of it, for the sight of her loveliness brought home\nto me the more poignantly the cause of my wretchedness.\n\n\"I was feeling a little lonely, that is all,\" I said. \"Has it never\noccurred to you that my position is so much more utterly alone than any\nhuman being's ever was before that a new word is really needed to\ndescribe it?\"\n\n\"Oh, you must not talk that way--you must not let yourself feel that\nway--you must not!\" she exclaimed, with moistened eyes. \"Are we not\nyour friends? It is your own fault if you will not let us be. You need\nnot be lonely.\"\n\n\"You are good to me beyond my power of understanding,\" I said, \"but\ndon't you suppose that I know it is pity merely, sweet pity, but pity\nonly. I should be a fool not to know that I cannot seem to you as other\nmen of your own generation do, but as some strange uncanny being, a\nstranded creature of an unknown sea, whose forlornness touches your\ncompassion despite its grotesqueness. I have been so foolish, you were\nso kind, as to almost forget that this must needs be so, and to fancy I\nmight in time become naturalized, as we used to say, in this age, so as\nto feel like one of you and to seem to you like the other men about\nyou. But Mr. Barton's sermon taught me how vain such a fancy is, how\ngreat the gulf between us must seem to you.\"\n\n\"Oh that miserable sermon!\" she exclaimed, fairly crying now in her\nsympathy, \"I wanted you not to hear it. What does he know of you? He\nhas read in old musty books about your times, that is all. What do you\ncare about him, to let yourself be vexed by anything he said? Isn't it\nanything to you, that we who know you feel differently? Don't you care\nmore about what we think of you than what he does who never saw you?\nOh, Mr. West! you don't know, you can't think, how it makes me feel to\nsee you so forlorn. I can't have it so. What can I say to you? How can\nI convince you how different our feeling for you is from what you\nthink?\"\n\nAs before, in that other crisis of my fate when she had come to me, she\nextended her hands toward me in a gesture of helpfulness, and, as then,\nI caught and held them in my own; her bosom heaved with strong emotion,\nand little tremors in the fingers which I clasped emphasized the depth\nof her feeling. In her face, pity contended in a sort of divine spite\nagainst the obstacles which reduced it to impotence. Womanly compassion\nsurely never wore a guise more lovely.\n\nSuch beauty and such goodness quite melted me, and it seemed that the\nonly fitting response I could make was to tell her just the truth. Of\ncourse I had not a spark of hope, but on the other hand I had no fear\nthat she would be angry. She was too pitiful for that. So I said\npresently, \"It is very ungrateful in me not to be satisfied with such\nkindness as you have shown me, and are showing me now. But are you so\nblind as not to see why they are not enough to make me happy? Don't you\nsee that it is because I have been mad enough to love you?\"\n\nAt my last words she blushed deeply and her eyes fell before mine, but\nshe made no effort to withdraw her hands from my clasp. For some\nmoments she stood so, panting a little. Then blushing deeper than ever,\nbut with a dazzling smile, she looked up.\n\n\"Are you sure it is not you who are blind?\" she said.\n\nThat was all, but it was enough, for it told me that, unaccountable,\nincredible as it was, this radiant daughter of a golden age had\nbestowed upon me not alone her pity, but her love. Still, I half\nbelieved I must be under some blissful hallucination even as I clasped\nher in my arms. \"If I am beside myself,\" I cried, \"let me remain so.\"\n\n\"It is I whom you must think beside myself,\" she panted, escaping from\nmy arms when I had barely tasted the sweetness of her lips. \"Oh! oh!\nwhat must you think of me almost to throw myself in the arms of one I\nhave known but a week? I did not mean that you should find it out so\nsoon, but I was so sorry for you I forgot what I was saying. No, no;\nyou must not touch me again till you know who I am. After that, sir,\nyou shall apologize to me very humbly for thinking, as I know you do,\nthat I have been over quick to fall in love with you. After you know\nwho I am, you will be bound to confess that it was nothing less than my\nduty to fall in love with you at first sight, and that no girl of\nproper feeling in my place could do otherwise.\"\n\nAs may be supposed, I would have been quite content to waive\nexplanations, but Edith was resolute that there should be no more\nkisses until she had been vindicated from all suspicion of precipitancy\nin the bestowal of her affections, and I was fain to follow the lovely\nenigma into the house. Having come where her mother was, she blushingly\nwhispered something in her ear and ran away, leaving us together.\n\nIt then appeared that, strange as my experience had been, I was now\nfirst to know what was perhaps its strangest feature. From Mrs. Leete I\nlearned that Edith was the great-granddaughter of no other than my lost\nlove, Edith Bartlett. After mourning me for fourteen years, she had\nmade a marriage of esteem, and left a son who had been Mrs. Leete's\nfather. Mrs. Leete had never seen her grandmother, but had heard much\nof her, and, when her daughter was born, gave her the name of Edith.\nThis fact might have tended to increase the interest which the girl\ntook, as she grew up, in all that concerned her ancestress, and\nespecially the tragic story of the supposed death of the lover, whose\nwife she expected to be, in the conflagration of his house. It was a\ntale well calculated to touch the sympathy of a romantic girl, and the\nfact that the blood of the unfortunate heroine was in her own veins\nnaturally heightened Edith's interest in it. A portrait of Edith\nBartlett and some of her papers, including a packet of my own letters,\nwere among the family heirlooms. The picture represented a very\nbeautiful young woman about whom it was easy to imagine all manner of\ntender and romantic things. My letters gave Edith some material for\nforming a distinct idea of my personality, and both together sufficed\nto make the sad old story very real to her. She used to tell her\nparents, half jestingly, that she would never marry till she found a\nlover like Julian West, and there were none such nowadays.\n\nNow all this, of course, was merely the daydreaming of a girl whose\nmind had never been taken up by a love affair of her own, and would\nhave had no serious consequence but for the discovery that morning of\nthe buried vault in her father's garden and the revelation of the\nidentity of its inmate. For when the apparently lifeless form had been\nborne into the house, the face in the locket found upon the breast was\ninstantly recognized as that of Edith Bartlett, and by that fact, taken\nin connection with the other circumstances, they knew that I was no\nother than Julian West. Even had there been no thought, as at first\nthere was not, of my resuscitation, Mrs. Leete said she believed that\nthis event would have affected her daughter in a critical and life-long\nmanner. The presumption of some subtle ordering of destiny, involving\nher fate with mine, would under all circumstances have possessed an\nirresistible fascination for almost any woman.\n\nWhether when I came back to life a few hours afterward, and from the\nfirst seemed to turn to her with a peculiar dependence and to find a\nspecial solace in her company, she had been too quick in giving her\nlove at the first sign of mine, I could now, her mother said, judge for\nmyself. If I thought so, I must remember that this, after all, was the\ntwentieth and not the nineteenth century, and love was, no doubt, now\nquicker in growth, as well as franker in utterance than then.\n\nFrom Mrs. Leete I went to Edith. When I found her, it was first of all\nto take her by both hands and stand a long time in rapt contemplation\nof her face. As I gazed, the memory of that other Edith, which had been\naffected as with a benumbing shock by the tremendous experience that\nhad parted us, revived, and my heart was dissolved with tender and\npitiful emotions, but also very blissful ones. For she who brought to\nme so poignantly the sense of my loss was to make that loss good. It\nwas as if from her eyes Edith Bartlett looked into mine, and smiled\nconsolation to me. My fate was not alone the strangest, but the most\nfortunate that ever befell a man. A double miracle had been wrought for\nme. I had not been stranded upon the shore of this strange world to\nfind myself alone and companionless. My love, whom I had dreamed lost,\nhad been reembodied for my consolation. When at last, in an ecstasy of\ngratitude and tenderness, I folded the lovely girl in my arms, the two\nEdiths were blended in my thought, nor have they ever since been\nclearly distinguished. I was not long in finding that on Edith's part\nthere was a corresponding confusion of identities. Never, surely, was\nthere between freshly united lovers a stranger talk than ours that\nafternoon. She seemed more anxious to have me speak of Edith Bartlett\nthan of herself, of how I had loved her than how I loved herself,\nrewarding my fond words concerning another woman with tears and tender\nsmiles and pressures of the hand.\n\n\"You must not love me too much for myself,\" she said. \"I shall be very\njealous for her. I shall not let you forget her. I am going to tell you\nsomething which you may think strange. Do you not believe that spirits\nsometimes come back to the world to fulfill some work that lay near\ntheir hearts? What if I were to tell you that I have sometimes thought\nthat her spirit lives in me--that Edith Bartlett, not Edith Leete, is\nmy real name. I cannot know it; of course none of us can know who we\nreally are; but I can feel it. Can you wonder that I have such a\nfeeling, seeing how my life was affected by her and by you, even before\nyou came. So you see you need not trouble to love me at all, if only\nyou are true to her. I shall not be likely to be jealous.\"\n\nDr. Leete had gone out that afternoon, and I did not have an interview\nwith him till later. He was not, apparently, wholly unprepared for the\nintelligence I conveyed, and shook my hand heartily.\n\n\"Under any ordinary circumstances, Mr. West, I should say that this\nstep had been taken on rather short acquaintance; but these are\ndecidedly not ordinary circumstances. In fairness, perhaps I ought to\ntell you,\" he added smilingly, \"that while I cheerfully consent to the\nproposed arrangement, you must not feel too much indebted to me, as I\njudge my consent is a mere formality. From the moment the secret of the\nlocket was out, it had to be, I fancy. Why, bless me, if Edith had not\nbeen there to redeem her great-grandmother's pledge, I really apprehend\nthat Mrs. Leete's loyalty to me would have suffered a severe strain.\"\n\nThat evening the garden was bathed in moonlight, and till midnight\nEdith and I wandered to and fro there, trying to grow accustomed to our\nhappiness.\n\n\"What should I have done if you had not cared for me?\" she exclaimed.\n\"I was afraid you were not going to. What should I have done then, when\nI felt I was consecrated to you! As soon as you came back to life, I\nwas as sure as if she had told me that I was to be to you what she\ncould not be, but that could only be if you would let me. Oh, how I\nwanted to tell you that morning, when you felt so terribly strange\namong us, who I was, but dared not open my lips about that, or let\nfather or mother----\"\n\n\"That must have been what you would not let your father tell me!\" I\nexclaimed, referring to the conversation I had overheard as I came out\nof my trance.\n\n\"Of course it was,\" Edith laughed. \"Did you only just guess that?\nFather being only a man, thought that it would make you feel among\nfriends to tell you who we were. He did not think of me at all. But\nmother knew what I meant, and so I had my way. I could never have\nlooked you in the face if you had known who I was. It would have been\nforcing myself on you quite too boldly. I am afraid you think I did\nthat to-day, as it was. I am sure I did not mean to, for I know girls\nwere expected to hide their feelings in your day, and I was dreadfully\nafraid of shocking you. Ah me, how hard it must have been for them to\nhave always had to conceal their love like a fault. Why did they think\nit such a shame to love any one till they had been given permission? It\nis so odd to think of waiting for permission to fall in love. Was it\nbecause men in those days were angry when girls loved them? That is not\nthe way women would feel, I am sure, or men either, I think, now. I\ndon't understand it at all. That will be one of the curious things\nabout the women of those days that you will have to explain to me. I\ndon't believe Edith Bartlett was so foolish as the others.\"\n\nAfter sundry ineffectual attempts at parting, she finally insisted that\nwe must say good night. I was about to imprint upon her lips the\npositively last kiss, when she said, with an indescribable archness:\n\n\"One thing troubles me. Are you sure that you quite forgive Edith\nBartlett for marrying any one else? The books that have come down to us\nmake out lovers of your time more jealous than fond, and that is what\nmakes me ask. It would be a great relief to me if I could feel sure\nthat you were not in the least jealous of my great-grandfather for\nmarrying your sweetheart. May I tell my great-grandmother's picture\nwhen I go to my room that you quite forgive her for proving false to\nyou?\"\n\nWill the reader believe it, this coquettish quip, whether the speaker\nherself had any idea of it or not, actually touched and with the\ntouching cured a preposterous ache of something like jealousy which I\nhad been vaguely conscious of ever since Mrs. Leete had told me of\nEdith Bartlett's marriage. Even while I had been holding Edith\nBartlett's great-granddaughter in my arms, I had not, till this moment,\nso illogical are some of our feelings, distinctly realized that but for\nthat marriage I could not have done so. The absurdity of this frame of\nmind could only be equalled by the abruptness with which it dissolved\nas Edith's roguish query cleared the fog from my perceptions. I laughed\nas I kissed her.\n\n\"You may assure her of my entire forgiveness,\" I said, \"although if it\nhad been any man but your great-grandfather whom she married, it would\nhave been a very different matter.\"\n\nOn reaching my chamber that night I did not open the musical telephone\nthat I might be lulled to sleep with soothing tunes, as had become my\nhabit. For once my thoughts made better music than even twentieth\ncentury orchestras discourse, and it held me enchanted till well toward\nmorning, when I fell asleep.\n\n\n\nChapter 28\n\n\"It's a little after the time you told me to wake you, sir. You did not\ncome out of it as quick as common, sir.\"\n\nThe voice was the voice of my man Sawyer. I started bolt upright in bed\nand stared around. I was in my underground chamber. The mellow light of\nthe lamp which always burned in the room when I occupied it illumined\nthe familiar walls and furnishings. By my bedside, with the glass of\nsherry in his hand which Dr. Pillsbury prescribed on first rousing from\na mesmeric sleep, by way of awakening the torpid physical functions,\nstood Sawyer.\n\n\"Better take this right off, sir,\" he said, as I stared blankly at him.\n\"You look kind of flushed like, sir, and you need it.\"\n\nI tossed off the liquor and began to realize what had happened to me.\nIt was, of course, very plain. All that about the twentieth century had\nbeen a dream. I had but dreamed of that enlightened and care-free race\nof men and their ingeniously simple institutions, of the glorious new\nBoston with its domes and pinnacles, its gardens and fountains, and its\nuniversal reign of comfort. The amiable family which I had learned to\nknow so well, my genial host and Mentor, Dr. Leete, his wife, and their\ndaughter, the second and more beauteous Edith, my betrothed--these,\ntoo, had been but figments of a vision.\n\nFor a considerable time I remained in the attitude in which this\nconviction had come over me, sitting up in bed gazing at vacancy,\nabsorbed in recalling the scenes and incidents of my fantastic\nexperience. Sawyer, alarmed at my looks, was meanwhile anxiously\ninquiring what was the matter with me. Roused at length by his\nimportunities to a recognition of my surroundings, I pulled myself\ntogether with an effort and assured the faithful fellow that I was all\nright. \"I have had an extraordinary dream, that's all, Sawyer,\" I said,\n\"a most-ex-traor-dinary dream.\"\n\nI dressed in a mechanical way, feeling light-headed and oddly uncertain\nof myself, and sat down to the coffee and rolls which Sawyer was in the\nhabit of providing for my refreshment before I left the house. The\nmorning newspaper lay by the plate. I took it up, and my eye fell on\nthe date, May 31, 1887. I had known, of course, from the moment I\nopened my eyes that my long and detailed experience in another century\nhad been a dream, and yet it was startling to have it so conclusively\ndemonstrated that the world was but a few hours older than when I had\nlain down to sleep.\n\nGlancing at the table of contents at the head of the paper, which\nreviewed the news of the morning, I read the following summary:\n\n\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS.--The impending war between France and Germany. The\nFrench Chambers asked for new military credits to meet Germany's\nincrease of her army. Probability that all Europe will be involved in\ncase of war.--Great suffering among the unemployed in London. They\ndemand work. Monster demonstration to be made. The authorities\nuneasy.--Great strikes in Belgium. The government preparing to repress\noutbreaks. Shocking facts in regard to the employment of girls in\nBelgium coal mines.--Wholesale evictions in Ireland.\n\n\"HOME AFFAIRS.--The epidemic of fraud unchecked. Embezzlement of half a\nmillion in New York.--Misappropriation of a trust fund by executors.\nOrphans left penniless.--Clever system of thefts by a bank teller;\n$50,000 gone.--The coal barons decide to advance the price of coal and\nreduce production.--Speculators engineering a great wheat corner at\nChicago.--A clique forcing up the price of coffee.--Enormous land-grabs\nof Western syndicates.--Revelations of shocking corruption among\nChicago officials. Systematic bribery.--The trials of the Boodle\naldermen to go on at New York.--Large failures of business houses.\nFears of a business crisis.--A large grist of burglaries and\nlarcenies.--A woman murdered in cold blood for her money at New\nHaven.--A householder shot by a burglar in this city last night.--A man\nshoots himself in Worcester because he could not get work. A large\nfamily left destitute.--An aged couple in New Jersey commit suicide\nrather than go to the poor-house.--Pitiable destitution among the women\nwage-workers in the great cities.--Startling growth of illiteracy in\nMassachusetts.--More insane asylums wanted.--Decoration Day addresses.\nProfessor Brown's oration on the moral grandeur of nineteenth century\ncivilization.\"\n\nIt was indeed the nineteenth century to which I had awaked; there could\nbe no kind of doubt about that. Its complete microcosm this summary of\nthe day's news had presented, even to that last unmistakable touch of\nfatuous self-complacency. Coming after such a damning indictment of the\nage as that one day's chronicle of world-wide bloodshed, greed, and\ntyranny, was a bit of cynicism worthy of Mephistopheles, and yet of all\nwhose eyes it had met this morning I was, perhaps, the only one who\nperceived the cynicism, and but yesterday I should have perceived it no\nmore than the others. That strange dream it was which had made all the\ndifference. For I know not how long, I forgot my surroundings after\nthis, and was again in fancy moving in that vivid dream-world, in that\nglorious city, with its homes of simple comfort and its gorgeous public\npalaces. Around me were again faces unmarred by arrogance or servility,\nby envy or greed, by anxious care or feverish ambition, and stately\nforms of men and women who had never known fear of a fellow man or\ndepended on his favor, but always, in the words of that sermon which\nstill rang in my ears, had \"stood up straight before God.\"\n\nWith a profound sigh and a sense of irreparable loss, not the less\npoignant that it was a loss of what had never really been, I roused at\nlast from my reverie, and soon after left the house.\n\nA dozen times between my door and Washington Street I had to stop and\npull myself together, such power had been in that vision of the Boston\nof the future to make the real Boston strange. The squalor and\nmalodorousness of the town struck me, from the moment I stood upon the\nstreet, as facts I had never before observed. But yesterday, moreover,\nit had seemed quite a matter of course that some of my fellow-citizens\nshould wear silks, and others rags, that some should look well fed, and\nothers hungry. Now on the contrary the glaring disparities in the dress\nand condition of the men and women who brushed each other on the\nsidewalks shocked me at every step, and yet more the entire\nindifference which the prosperous showed to the plight of the\nunfortunate. Were these human beings, who could behold the wretchedness\nof their fellows without so much as a change of countenance? And yet,\nall the while, I knew well that it was I who had changed, and not my\ncontemporaries. I had dreamed of a city whose people fared all alike as\nchildren of one family and were one another's keepers in all things.\n\nAnother feature of the real Boston, which assumed the extraordinary\neffect of strangeness that marks familiar things seen in a new light,\nwas the prevalence of advertising. There had been no personal\nadvertising in the Boston of the twentieth century, because there was\nno need of any, but here the walls of the buildings, the windows, the\nbroadsides of the newspapers in every hand, the very pavements,\neverything in fact in sight, save the sky, were covered with the\nappeals of individuals who sought, under innumerable pretexts, to\nattract the contributions of others to their support. However the\nwording might vary, the tenor of all these appeals was the same:\n\n\"Help John Jones. Never mind the rest. They are frauds. I, John Jones,\nam the right one. Buy of me. Employ me. Visit me. Hear me, John Jones.\nLook at me. Make no mistake, John Jones is the man and nobody else. Let\nthe rest starve, but for God's sake remember John Jones!\"\n\nWhether the pathos or the moral repulsiveness of the spectacle most\nimpressed me, so suddenly become a stranger in my own city, I know not.\nWretched men, I was moved to cry, who, because they will not learn to\nbe helpers of one another, are doomed to be beggars of one another from\nthe least to the greatest! This horrible babel of shameless\nself-assertion and mutual depreciation, this stunning clamor of\nconflicting boasts, appeals, and adjurations, this stupendous system of\nbrazen beggary, what was it all but the necessity of a society in which\nthe opportunity to serve the world according to his gifts, instead of\nbeing secured to every man as the first object of social organization,\nhad to be fought for!\n\nI reached Washington Street at the busiest point, and there I stood and\nlaughed aloud, to the scandal of the passers-by. For my life I could\nnot have helped it, with such a mad humor was I moved at sight of the\ninterminable rows of stores on either side, up and down the street so\nfar as I could see--scores of them, to make the spectacle more utterly\npreposterous, within a stone's throw devoted to selling the same sort\nof goods. Stores! stores! stores! miles of stores! ten thousand stores\nto distribute the goods needed by this one city, which in my dream had\nbeen supplied with all things from a single warehouse, as they were\nordered through one great store in every quarter, where the buyer,\nwithout waste of time or labor, found under one roof the world's\nassortment in whatever line he desired. There the labor of distribution\nhad been so slight as to add but a scarcely perceptible fraction to the\ncost of commodities to the user. The cost of production was virtually\nall he paid. But here the mere distribution of the goods, their\nhandling alone, added a fourth, a third, a half and more, to the cost.\nAll these ten thousand plants must be paid for, their rent, their\nstaffs of superintendence, their platoons of salesmen, their ten\nthousand sets of accountants, jobbers, and business dependents, with\nall they spent in advertising themselves and fighting one another, and\nthe consumers must do the paying. What a famous process for beggaring a\nnation!\n\nWere these serious men I saw about me, or children, who did their\nbusiness on such a plan? Could they be reasoning beings, who did not\nsee the folly which, when the product is made and ready for use, wastes\nso much of it in getting it to the user? If people eat with a spoon\nthat leaks half its contents between bowl and lip, are they not likely\nto go hungry?\n\nI had passed through Washington Street thousands of times before and\nviewed the ways of those who sold merchandise, but my curiosity\nconcerning them was as if I had never gone by their way before. I took\nwondering note of the show windows of the stores, filled with goods\narranged with a wealth of pains and artistic device to attract the eye.\nI saw the throngs of ladies looking in, and the proprietors eagerly\nwatching the effect of the bait. I went within and noted the hawk-eyed\nfloor-walker watching for business, overlooking the clerks, keeping\nthem up to their task of inducing the customers to buy, buy, buy, for\nmoney if they had it, for credit if they had it not, to buy what they\nwanted not, more than they wanted, what they could not afford. At times\nI momentarily lost the clue and was confused by the sight. Why this\neffort to induce people to buy? Surely that had nothing to do with the\nlegitimate business of distributing products to those who needed them.\nSurely it was the sheerest waste to force upon people what they did not\nwant, but what might be useful to another. The nation was so much the\npoorer for every such achievement. What were these clerks thinking of?\nThen I would remember that they were not acting as distributors like\nthose in the store I had visited in the dream Boston. They were not\nserving the public interest, but their immediate personal interest, and\nit was nothing to them what the ultimate effect of their course on the\ngeneral prosperity might be, if but they increased their own hoard, for\nthese goods were their own, and the more they sold and the more they\ngot for them, the greater their gain. The more wasteful the people\nwere, the more articles they did not want which they could be induced\nto buy, the better for these sellers. To encourage prodigality was the\nexpress aim of the ten thousand stores of Boston.\n\nNor were these storekeepers and clerks a whit worse men than any others\nin Boston. They must earn a living and support their families, and how\nwere they to find a trade to do it by which did not necessitate placing\ntheir individual interests before those of others and that of all? They\ncould not be asked to starve while they waited for an order of things\nsuch as I had seen in my dream, in which the interest of each and that\nof all were identical. But, God in heaven! what wonder, under such a\nsystem as this about me--what wonder that the city was so shabby, and\nthe people so meanly dressed, and so many of them ragged and hungry!\n\nSome time after this it was that I drifted over into South Boston and\nfound myself among the manufacturing establishments. I had been in this\nquarter of the city a hundred times before, just as I had been on\nWashington Street, but here, as well as there, I now first perceived\nthe true significance of what I witnessed. Formerly I had taken pride\nin the fact that, by actual count, Boston had some four thousand\nindependent manufacturing establishments; but in this very multiplicity\nand independence I recognized now the secret of the insignificant total\nproduct of their industry.\n\nIf Washington Street had been like a lane in Bedlam, this was a\nspectacle as much more melancholy as production is a more vital\nfunction than distribution. For not only were these four thousand\nestablishments not working in concert, and for that reason alone\noperating at prodigious disadvantage, but, as if this did not involve a\nsufficiently disastrous loss of power, they were using their utmost\nskill to frustrate one another's effort, praying by night and working\nby day for the destruction of one another's enterprises.\n\nThe roar and rattle of wheels and hammers resounding from every side\nwas not the hum of a peaceful industry, but the clangor of swords\nwielded by foemen. These mills and shops were so many forts, each under\nits own flag, its guns trained on the mills and shops about it, and its\nsappers busy below, undermining them.\n\nWithin each one of these forts the strictest organization of industry\nwas insisted on; the separate gangs worked under a single central\nauthority. No interference and no duplicating of work were permitted.\nEach had his allotted task, and none were idle. By what hiatus in the\nlogical faculty, by what lost link of reasoning, account, then, for the\nfailure to recognize the necessity of applying the same principle to\nthe organization of the national industries as a whole, to see that if\nlack of organization could impair the efficiency of a shop, it must\nhave effects as much more disastrous in disabling the industries of the\nnation at large as the latter are vaster in volume and more complex in\nthe relationship of their parts.\n\nPeople would be prompt enough to ridicule an army in which there were\nneither companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, or army\ncorps--no unit of organization, in fact, larger than the corporal's\nsquad, with no officer higher than a corporal, and all the corporals\nequal in authority. And yet just such an army were the manufacturing\nindustries of nineteenth century Boston, an army of four thousand\nindependent squads led by four thousand independent corporals, each\nwith a separate plan of campaign.\n\nKnots of idle men were to be seen here and there on every side, some\nidle because they could find no work at any price, others because they\ncould not get what they thought a fair price. I accosted some of the\nlatter, and they told me their grievances. It was very little comfort I\ncould give them. \"I am sorry for you,\" I said. \"You get little enough,\ncertainly, and yet the wonder to me is, not that industries conducted\nas these are do not pay you living wages, but that they are able to pay\nyou any wages at all.\"\n\nMaking my way back again after this to the peninsular city, toward\nthree o'clock I stood on State Street, staring, as if I had never seen\nthem before, at the banks and brokers' offices, and other financial\ninstitutions, of which there had been in the State Street of my vision\nno vestige. Business men, confidential clerks, and errand boys were\nthronging in and out of the banks, for it wanted but a few minutes of\nthe closing hour. Opposite me was the bank where I did business, and\npresently I crossed the street, and, going in with the crowd, stood in\na recess of the wall looking on at the army of clerks handling money,\nand the cues of depositors at the tellers' windows. An old gentleman\nwhom I knew, a director of the bank, passing me and observing my\ncontemplative attitude, stopped a moment.\n\n\"Interesting sight, isn't it, Mr. West,\" he said. \"Wonderful piece of\nmechanism; I find it so myself. I like sometimes to stand and look on\nat it just as you are doing. It's a poem, sir, a poem, that's what I\ncall it. Did you ever think, Mr. West, that the bank is the heart of\nthe business system? From it and to it, in endless flux and reflux, the\nlife blood goes. It is flowing in now. It will flow out again in the\nmorning\"; and pleased with his little conceit, the old man passed on\nsmiling.\n\nYesterday I should have considered the simile apt enough, but since\nthen I had visited a world incomparably more affluent than this, in\nwhich money was unknown and without conceivable use. I had learned that\nit had a use in the world around me only because the work of producing\nthe nation's livelihood, instead of being regarded as the most strictly\npublic and common of all concerns, and as such conducted by the nation,\nwas abandoned to the hap-hazard efforts of individuals. This original\nmistake necessitated endless exchanges to bring about any sort of\ngeneral distribution of products. These exchanges money effected--how\nequitably, might be seen in a walk from the tenement house districts to\nthe Back Bay--at the cost of an army of men taken from productive labor\nto manage it, with constant ruinous breakdowns of its machinery, and a\ngenerally debauching influence on mankind which had justified its\ndescription, from ancient time, as the \"root of all evil.\"\n\nAlas for the poor old bank director with his poem! He had mistaken the\nthrobbing of an abscess for the beating of the heart. What he called \"a\nwonderful piece of mechanism\" was an imperfect device to remedy an\nunnecessary defect, the clumsy crutch of a self-made cripple.\n\nAfter the banks had closed I wandered aimlessly about the business\nquarter for an hour or two, and later sat a while on one of the benches\nof the Common, finding an interest merely in watching the throngs that\npassed, such as one has in studying the populace of a foreign city, so\nstrange since yesterday had my fellow citizens and their ways become to\nme. For thirty years I had lived among them, and yet I seemed to have\nnever noted before how drawn and anxious were their faces, of the rich\nas of the poor, the refined, acute faces of the educated as well as the\ndull masks of the ignorant. And well it might be so, for I saw now, as\nnever before I had seen so plainly, that each as he walked constantly\nturned to catch the whispers of a spectre at his ear, the spectre of\nUncertainty. \"Do your work never so well,\" the spectre was\nwhispering--\"rise early and toil till late, rob cunningly or serve\nfaithfully, you shall never know security. Rich you may be now and\nstill come to poverty at last. Leave never so much wealth to your\nchildren, you cannot buy the assurance that your son may not be the\nservant of your servant, or that your daughter will not have to sell\nherself for bread.\"\n\nA man passing by thrust an advertising card in my hand, which set forth\nthe merits of some new scheme of life insurance. The incident reminded\nme of the only device, pathetic in its admission of the universal need\nit so poorly supplied, which offered these tired and hunted men and\nwomen even a partial protection from uncertainty. By this means, those\nalready well-to-do, I remembered, might purchase a precarious\nconfidence that after their death their loved ones would not, for a\nwhile at least, be trampled under the feet of men. But this was all,\nand this was only for those who could pay well for it. What idea was\npossible to these wretched dwellers in the land of Ishmael, where every\nman's hand was against each and the hand of each against every other,\nof true life insurance as I had seen it among the people of that dream\nland, each of whom, by virtue merely of his membership in the national\nfamily, was guaranteed against need of any sort, by a policy\nunderwritten by one hundred million fellow countrymen.\n\nSome time after this it was that I recall a glimpse of myself standing\non the steps of a building on Tremont Street, looking at a military\nparade. A regiment was passing. It was the first sight in that dreary\nday which had inspired me with any other emotions than wondering pity\nand amazement. Here at last were order and reason, an exhibition of\nwhat intelligent cooperation can accomplish. The people who stood\nlooking on with kindling faces,--could it be that the sight had for\nthem no more than but a spectacular interest? Could they fail to see\nthat it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under\none control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were, able\nto vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly, could\nthey fail to compare the scientific manner in which the nation went to\nwar with the unscientific manner in which it went to work? Would they\nnot query since what time the killing of men had been a task so much\nmore important than feeding and clothing them, that a trained army\nshould be deemed alone adequate to the former, while the latter was\nleft to a mob?\n\nIt was now toward nightfall, and the streets were thronged with the\nworkers from the stores, the shops, and mills. Carried along with the\nstronger part of the current, I found myself, as it began to grow dark,\nin the midst of a scene of squalor and human degradation such as only\nthe South Cove tenement district could present. I had seen the mad\nwasting of human labor; here I saw in direst shape the want that waste\nhad bred.\n\nFrom the black doorways and windows of the rookeries on every side came\ngusts of fetid air. The streets and alleys reeked with the effluvia of\na slave ship's between-decks. As I passed I had glimpses within of pale\nbabies gasping out their lives amid sultry stenches, of hopeless-faced\nwomen deformed by hardship, retaining of womanhood no trait save\nweakness, while from the windows leered girls with brows of brass. Like\nthe starving bands of mongrel curs that infest the streets of Moslem\ntowns, swarms of half-clad brutalized children filled the air with\nshrieks and curses as they fought and tumbled among the garbage that\nlittered the court-yards.\n\nThere was nothing in all this that was new to me. Often had I passed\nthrough this part of the city and witnessed its sights with feelings of\ndisgust mingled with a certain philosophical wonder at the extremities\nmortals will endure and still cling to life. But not alone as regarded\nthe economical follies of this age, but equally as touched its moral\nabominations, scales had fallen from my eyes since that vision of\nanother century. No more did I look upon the woful dwellers in this\nInferno with a callous curiosity as creatures scarcely human. I saw in\nthem my brothers and sisters, my parents, my children, flesh of my\nflesh, blood of my blood. The festering mass of human wretchedness\nabout me offended not now my senses merely, but pierced my heart like a\nknife, so that I could not repress sighs and groans. I not only saw but\nfelt in my body all that I saw.\n\nPresently, too, as I observed the wretched beings about me more\nclosely, I perceived that they were all quite dead. Their bodies were\nso many living sepulchres. On each brutal brow was plainly written the\nhic jacet of a soul dead within.\n\nAs I looked, horror struck, from one death's head to another, I was\naffected by a singular hallucination. Like a wavering translucent\nspirit face superimposed upon each of these brutish masks I saw the\nideal, the possible face that would have been the actual if mind and\nsoul had lived. It was not till I was aware of these ghostly faces, and\nof the reproach that could not be gainsaid which was in their eyes,\nthat the full piteousness of the ruin that had been wrought was\nrevealed to me. I was moved with contrition as with a strong agony, for\nI had been one of those who had endured that these things should be. I\nhad been one of those who, well knowing that they were, had not desired\nto hear or be compelled to think much of them, but had gone on as if\nthey were not, seeking my own pleasure and profit. Therefore now I\nfound upon my garments the blood of this great multitude of strangled\nsouls of my brothers. The voice of their blood cried out against me\nfrom the ground. Every stone of the reeking pavements, every brick of\nthe pestilential rookeries, found a tongue and called after me as I\nfled: What hast thou done with thy brother Abel?\n\nI have no clear recollection of anything after this till I found myself\nstanding on the carved stone steps of the magnificent home of my\nbetrothed in Commonwealth Avenue. Amid the tumult of my thoughts that\nday, I had scarcely once thought of her, but now obeying some\nunconscious impulse my feet had found the familiar way to her door. I\nwas told that the family were at dinner, but word was sent out that I\nshould join them at table. Besides the family, I found several guests\npresent, all known to me. The table glittered with plate and costly\nchina. The ladies were sumptuously dressed and wore the jewels of\nqueens. The scene was one of costly elegance and lavish luxury. The\ncompany was in excellent spirits, and there was plentiful laughter and\na running fire of jests.\n\nTo me it was as if, in wandering through the place of doom, my blood\nturned to tears by its sights, and my spirit attuned to sorrow, pity,\nand despair, I had happened in some glade upon a merry party of\nroisterers. I sat in silence until Edith began to rally me upon my\nsombre looks, What ailed me? The others presently joined in the playful\nassault, and I became a target for quips and jests. Where had I been,\nand what had I seen to make such a dull fellow of me?\n\n\"I have been in Golgotha,\" at last I answered. \"I have seen Humanity\nhanging on a cross! Do none of you know what sights the sun and stars\nlook down on in this city, that you can think and talk of anything\nelse? Do you not know that close to your doors a great multitude of men\nand women, flesh of your flesh, live lives that are one agony from\nbirth to death? Listen! their dwellings are so near that if you hush\nyour laughter you will hear their grievous voices, the piteous crying\nof the little ones that suckle poverty, the hoarse curses of men sodden\nin misery turned half-way back to brutes, the chaffering of an army of\nwomen selling themselves for bread. With what have you stopped your\nears that you do not hear these doleful sounds? For me, I can hear\nnothing else.\"\n\nSilence followed my words. A passion of pity had shaken me as I spoke,\nbut when I looked around upon the company, I saw that, far from being\nstirred as I was, their faces expressed a cold and hard astonishment,\nmingled in Edith's with extreme mortification, in her father's with\nanger. The ladies were exchanging scandalized looks, while one of the\ngentlemen had put up his eyeglass and was studying me with an air of\nscientific curiosity. When I saw that things which were to me so\nintolerable moved them not at all, that words that melted my heart to\nspeak had only offended them with the speaker, I was at first stunned\nand then overcome with a desperate sickness and faintness at the heart.\nWhat hope was there for the wretched, for the world, if thoughtful men\nand tender women were not moved by things like these! Then I bethought\nmyself that it must be because I had not spoken aright. No doubt I had\nput the case badly. They were angry because they thought I was berating\nthem, when God knew I was merely thinking of the horror of the fact\nwithout any attempt to assign the responsibility for it.\n\nI restrained my passion, and tried to speak calmly and logically that I\nmight correct this impression. I told them that I had not meant to\naccuse them, as if they, or the rich in general, were responsible for\nthe misery of the world. True indeed it was, that the superfluity which\nthey wasted would, otherwise bestowed, relieve much bitter suffering.\nThese costly viands, these rich wines, these gorgeous fabrics and\nglistening jewels represented the ransom of many lives. They were\nverily not without the guiltiness of those who waste in a land stricken\nwith famine. Nevertheless, all the waste of all the rich, were it\nsaved, would go but a little way to cure the poverty of the world.\nThere was so little to divide that even if the rich went share and\nshare with the poor, there would be but a common fare of crusts, albeit\nmade very sweet then by brotherly love.\n\nThe folly of men, not their hard-heartedness, was the great cause of\nthe world's poverty. It was not the crime of man, nor of any class of\nmen, that made the race so miserable, but a hideous, ghastly mistake, a\ncolossal world-darkening blunder. And then I showed them how four\nfifths of the labor of men was utterly wasted by the mutual warfare,\nthe lack of organization and concert among the workers. Seeking to make\nthe matter very plain, I instanced the case of arid lands where the\nsoil yielded the means of life only by careful use of the watercourses\nfor irrigation. I showed how in such countries it was counted the most\nimportant function of the government to see that the water was not\nwasted by the selfishness or ignorance of individuals, since otherwise\nthere would be famine. To this end its use was strictly regulated and\nsystematized, and individuals of their mere caprice were not permitted\nto dam it or divert it, or in any way to tamper with it.\n\nThe labor of men, I explained, was the fertilizing stream which alone\nrendered earth habitable. It was but a scanty stream at best, and its\nuse required to be regulated by a system which expended every drop to\nthe best advantage, if the world were to be supported in abundance. But\nhow far from any system was the actual practice! Every man wasted the\nprecious fluid as he wished, animated only by the equal motives of\nsaving his own crop and spoiling his neighbor's, that his might sell\nthe better. What with greed and what with spite some fields were\nflooded while others were parched, and half the water ran wholly to\nwaste. In such a land, though a few by strength or cunning might win\nthe means of luxury, the lot of the great mass must be poverty, and of\nthe weak and ignorant bitter want and perennial famine.\n\nLet but the famine-stricken nation assume the function it had\nneglected, and regulate for the common good the course of the\nlife-giving stream, and the earth would bloom like one garden, and none\nof its children lack any good thing. I described the physical felicity,\nmental enlightenment, and moral elevation which would then attend the\nlives of all men. With fervency I spoke of that new world, blessed with\nplenty, purified by justice and sweetened by brotherly kindness, the\nworld of which I had indeed but dreamed, but which might so easily be\nmade real. But when I had expected now surely the faces around me to\nlight up with emotions akin to mine, they grew ever more dark, angry,\nand scornful. Instead of enthusiasm, the ladies showed only aversion\nand dread, while the men interrupted me with shouts of reprobation and\ncontempt. \"Madman!\" \"Pestilent fellow!\" \"Fanatic!\" \"Enemy of society!\"\nwere some of their cries, and the one who had before taken his eyeglass\nto me exclaimed, \"He says we are to have no more poor. Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"Put the fellow out!\" exclaimed the father of my betrothed, and at the\nsignal the men sprang from their chairs and advanced upon me.\n\nIt seemed to me that my heart would burst with the anguish of finding\nthat what was to me so plain and so all important was to them\nmeaningless, and that I was powerless to make it other. So hot had been\nmy heart that I had thought to melt an iceberg with its glow, only to\nfind at last the overmastering chill seizing my own vitals. It was not\nenmity that I felt toward them as they thronged me, but pity only, for\nthem and for the world.\n\nAlthough despairing, I could not give over. Still I strove with them.\nTears poured from my eyes. In my vehemence I became inarticulate. I\npanted, I sobbed, I groaned, and immediately afterward found myself\nsitting upright in bed in my room in Dr. Leete's house, and the morning\nsun shining through the open window into my eyes. I was gasping. The\ntears were streaming down my face, and I quivered in every nerve.\n\n\nAs with an escaped convict who dreams that he has been recaptured and\nbrought back to his dark and reeking dungeon, and opens his eyes to see\nthe heaven's vault spread above him, so it was with me, as I realized\nthat my return to the nineteenth century had been the dream, and my\npresence in the twentieth was the reality.\n\nThe cruel sights which I had witnessed in my vision, and could so well\nconfirm from the experience of my former life, though they had, alas!\nonce been, and must in the retrospect to the end of time move the\ncompassionate to tears, were, God be thanked, forever gone by. Long ago\noppressor and oppressed, prophet and scorner, had been dust. For\ngenerations, rich and poor had been forgotten words.\n\nBut in that moment, while yet I mused with unspeakable thankfulness\nupon the greatness of the world's salvation and my privilege in\nbeholding it, there suddenly pierced me like a knife a pang of shame,\nremorse, and wondering self-reproach, that bowed my head upon my breast\nand made me wish the grave had hid me with my fellows from the sun. For\nI had been a man of that former time. What had I done to help on the\ndeliverance whereat I now presumed to rejoice? I who had lived in those\ncruel, insensate days, what had I done to bring them to an end? I had\nbeen every whit as indifferent to the wretchedness of my brothers, as\ncynically incredulous of better things, as besotted a worshiper of\nChaos and Old Night, as any of my fellows. So far as my personal\ninfluence went, it had been exerted rather to hinder than to help\nforward the enfranchisement of the race which was even then preparing.\nWhat right had I to hail a salvation which reproached me, to rejoice in\na day whose dawning I had mocked?\n\n\"Better for you, better for you,\" a voice within me rang, \"had this\nevil dream been the reality, and this fair reality the dream; better\nyour part pleading for crucified humanity with a scoffing generation,\nthan here, drinking of wells you digged not, and eating of trees whose\nhusbandmen you stoned\"; and my spirit answered, \"Better, truly.\"\n\nWhen at length I raised my bowed head and looked forth from the window,\nEdith, fresh as the morning, had come into the garden and was gathering\nflowers. I hastened to descend to her. Kneeling before her, with my\nface in the dust, I confessed with tears how little was my worth to\nbreathe the air of this golden century, and how infinitely less to wear\nupon my breast its consummate flower. Fortunate is he who, with a case\nso desperate as mine, finds a judge so merciful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Looking Backwards from 2000 to 1887, by \nEdward Bellamy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOOKING BACKWARDS FROM 2000 TO 1887 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 624.txt or 624.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/2/624/\n\nProduced by Charles Keller.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
