Their faces were so utterly undistinctive\nas to seem fuzzy. Each carried a large flat briefcase with a coil\nantenna sticking out.\n\n\"Watch it!\" the attendant growled, and they skated aside with a whir.\n\nBig Carl came driving up the ramp, ducked his head to enter, and\nbrought the bed to a stop in the belly of the ambulance. Miss Knox\npressed the button and the door closed in the admen's faces.\n\nWhen Mr. Barger was lowered from the hovering ambulance, his swollen,\ntearful eyes were sun-blind. Square hands clenched over and over with\npain. Above the rotors' _rackety-rackety-rack_, Miss Knox shouted\nsoothing things. She didn't wait for an answer. He was the worst\ncase of laryngitis she had ever known--the only case, really, in her\nprofessional experience. Abolished diseases always came back virulently.\n\nShe and the bed sank between white hospital walls and landed in the\nroom with a bump. The waiting attendant walked around the platform,\nfolding the safety gates. He unhooked the four support cables, each\nvanishing out of his grasp like spaghetti slurped from a plate.\n\nJust as the ceiling closed overhead, cutting off sight and sound of the\nwhirlybird against the sun, Brooks, the radiologist, came in through\nthe door, shepherding an entire class of medical students. Then two\nnurses seemed to clear an inoffensive path through the chemically\ntainted air of the corridor--and after them came Dr. Gesner, the\ngreatest throat man in the country. Miss Knox knew him from his\nportrait in the Mushroom.\n\nBrooks winked her an \"At ease!\" with a shaggy eyebrow and followed\nthe fat man through the crowd. Dr. Gesner went to the bed and sat\ndown. He was Barger's weight, with the same sort of elephantine bones,\nbut he was almost two feet shorter. He stared at the nose and cheeks\nprotruding from the bedclothes, and opened a fat black bag.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA bell rang three times in the corridor. Five interns scurried into the\nroom and stopped still, watching Dr. Gesner as though he were a golden\ncalf. On each side of the doorway stood a student nurse at attention.\n\nMr. Barger stopped twitching and opened one eye wide. His chin lifted,\nand his other chins came out from under the sheet's folded edge.\n\nOne of Dr. Gesner's hands felt through the black bag. It emerged\ndragging a mutape by one wire. Brooks leaned forward and took out the\nrest of the apparatus. Shaking the hair off his forehead, he plugged\ninto the bedside computer relay and placed the rubber-rimmed cup\nagainst the patient's skull, just over the Broca convolution.\n\nMr. Barger remained staring at the doctor through a gray film. The\nmutape chattered rapidly. Miss Knox craned her neck, deciphering the\npunched tape as it unrolled from the recorder in Brooks' hands. Sweat\npopped out on Mr. Barger's forehead.\n\n\"Help me, damn it,\" read Mr. Barger's tape. \"I know you. You abolished\nlaryngitis; why should it come to me now? I have a right to stop misuse\nof my work and to be free from pain--my patent is vital--free from\npain. I want to be free....\" His face turned pink in a new contortion\nand the hands folded over.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Gesner said as the chatter stopped. \"I know it hurts.\" He\nsmiled gently in the middle of his face. He was writing on an index\ncard, but his main effort was devoted to getting up from the bed with\nthe help of two internes. \"It will hurt this badly for twenty-four\nhours. Then the injection will have the upper hand.\" He turned to\nBrooks. \"Please pass the tape around, Doctor. If any students haven't\nseen the X-rays yet, they're in my file.\"\n\nMr. Barger's face grayed a little; the sweat had turned to patches of\ncrust against his skin. Dipping cotton in alcohol, Miss Knox bathed his\nforehead.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Dr. Gesner, handing her the card as the students\nbegan to vanish.\n\nShe stalked after him. \"No examination, Doctor?\" she asked, ignoring\nBrooks' horrified expression.\n\n\"Unnecessary, Nurse.\" He backed away from her and the door slid open.\n\"I've already seen the X-rays and charts you phoned from the ambulance.\nAnd the patient cannot open his mouth. His intravenous menu is all\nhere....\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor.\"\n\nThree bells sounded in the corridor. \"Calling Dr. Gesner. Emergency.\nPlease come to the telephone. Emergency. Calling Dr. Gesner....\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes at the index card in her hand. \"You yourself are to\ntake the shots prescribed for you, to prevent your catching or carrying\nthe disease. In that bed, but for the grace of God....\" He was crying\nsoftly.\n\n\"Doctor!\" said Brooks, and the internes and nurses gasped.\n\n\"After all,\" said Dr. Gesner, \"I _did_ abolish laryngitis.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Knox walked back up the drive and struck a cigarette on one of the\nstone lions. It glowed in the dark, but the river breeze blew it out\nbefore she could draw. She snorted in annoyance.\n\nMiss Erwin looked up sharply.\n\n\"Is there _anywhere_ where you can still buy matches?\" asked Miss Knox.\n\n\"Not in New York City. Why?\"\n\n\"We used to just try again when a cigarette didn't light. Now we have\nto throw it away.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Miss Erwin. \"That's how they train us to be right the\nfirst time.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous. That's how they sell more cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Why, _Miss Knox_! You sound like Royalty!\"\n\nMiss Knox laughed. \"I'm not ready to join the British Commonwealth yet.\nNo fooling, Hilda, you see the Silvertongue cigarette factory across\nthe river?\"\n\nMiss Erwin twisted white-gloved hands in the dark. \"Why, no ... mmm,\nsmell that spray.\" An ocean-breathing tugboat passed, its complicated\nsilhouette blocking the view. \"No-oooooo,\" the whistle blew.\n\n\"Just wait till that tug is gone. There, Miss Erwin. Do you see the\nSilvertongue factory? Just before the Williamsburg Bridge.\"\n\n\"Is it the one with the new radio--the radio-thing on top?\"\n\n\"Radiocompressor. Yes.\"\n\n\"They used to put _names_ on those factories. All lit up.\"\n\n\"Well, ladies--ladies,\" said a gravel voice beyond the entrance lights.\n\"How is life in the Toadstool?\"\n\n\"Boney!\" said Miss Knox.\n\n\"The what?\" asked Miss Erwin.\n\n\"That's what Dr. Brooks called it. Now you tell me what he meant--he\nwouldn't say. Toadstool.\"\n\n\"Come into the light, Boney--you frighten us,\" said Miss Erwin.\n\nThe man appeared, smiling, and climbed the first stone step. Resting\nhis elbows on the lion and his chin in his hand, he looked down on them\nsideways.\n\n\"Not _another_ new suit,\" said Miss Knox.\n\nIt was an archaic double-breasted suit in good condition. Where the\njacket hiked up in back, a wide expanse of extra trouser seat had been\nfolded over and tucked beneath the belt.\n\n\"Hundred-fifty-dollar suit,\" he said.\n\n\"With or without the bottle?\" asked Miss Knox.\n\n\"What bottle?\"\n\n\"The one that bangs on your ribs when the breeze blows.\"\n\n\"Now listen here, lady....\" He came down the step.\n\n\"Boney, I'm only kidding. You know that.\"\n\n\"Kidding. _Kidding._ And here I was giving you inside information.\n_Inside_ information.\"\n\n\"What information?\"\n\nBringing his drawn face so close that they could smell the wine, he\ngave both women a look of scorn. Then he backed away and leaned his\npadded shoulder against the lion.\n\n\"Boney, she's sorry,\" said Miss Erwin.\n\n\"I am not,\" said Miss Knox.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe glowered at her and walked away into the dark, his spider legs\ndissolving sooner than expected. Then he marched back.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"Ha. I won't tell you. I'm going to tell it to the\nDirector himself.\"\n\n\"Forget it, Boney. He'd throw you out again. You'd better just tell us.\"\n\nHis skeleton hand stretched toward the water. \"You see that radio\npresser?\"\n\n\"You mean the new radiocompressor on the Silvertongue factory?\"\n\n\"_Radio_compressor. All right. Do you ladies know what it does?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Miss Knox said. \"Our patient, Mr. Barger, builds them. He\ntold us all about it the moment he came. In Greek.\"\n\n\"Not--not _all_ about it. _I_ know all about it. I had a big deal\ngoing--my Armenian partner and me, we were buying up neckties to sell\nin the hospital....\"\n\n\"_What_ do you know? And will you _stop_ blowing in my face?\"\n\nHe glowered.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Boney.\"\n\n\"Radiocompressors can do things--any things--without touching. Like\nrolling cigarettes or chopping up tobacco. The radio waves are so small\nthey--push things.\" He pushed the air with his left hand. \"Not just go\nthrough them.\" He wiggled the brittle fingers of his right.\n\n\"Everyone knows that,\" said Miss Knox. \"What you mean is that the\nsupra-short wave has an intense direct effect on matter. It was in all\nthe papers.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that so? Is _that_ so? Well, you listen to me. _This_ isn't in\nall the papers.\"\n\n\"All right, go on.\" Miss Knox struck a cigarette, which blew out. She\nthrew it down and succeeded in lighting another.\n\n\"You can fool people, also, with the same radio waves,\" said Boney.\n\n\"You mean hide behind the door with a wave compressor and push chairs\naround? Like that?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. Nothing like _that_. Dr. Brooks told me today, when I\nwas sweeping his _private_ lab in the Toadstool, he told me they make\none kind where if you put it on a table, say, no one can see what else\nis there. You could put--a cat on the table, and anyone would think it\nwas just a table with a radio presser. Until the cat jumped off. Then\nyou could see it.\"\n\n\"Can it jump off?\" asked Miss Knox.\n\n\"Can it jump off? Did you ever see a cat that couldn't jump? And that's\nnot all--\"\n\n\"Quite a trick,\" she said.\n\n\"No trick. You could rule the world with that, ladies. Think about it.\nRule the world. Got a cigarette? After all, I always get you coffee.\"\n\nShe handed him one.\n\nMiss Erwin stared across the river. \"I hope it isn't a new kind of\nbomb,\" she said.\n\nBoney pulled out a stick match and struck it on the stone lion. Cupping\nhis hands around the flame, he lit up and walked away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But, Dr. Brooks, when you tell Boney things like that,\" said Miss\nKnox, \"he believes them, and he quotes you like mad. Don't you care\nabout your reputation at all?\"\n\n\"My dear woman,\" Dr. Brooks replied, \"I've been interested in many\nthings in my years, but getting my portrait in the Mushroom has never\nbeen one of them--\"\n\nMr. Barger's legs spasmed suddenly and shot straight out, jerking the\ncovers from his fat-layered neck. But the pink shut eyelids hadn't\nquivered.\n\n\"--and, anyway, Boney is right,\" Dr. Brooks finished. \"Why do you think\nthe Royalties want government control of the whole invention?\"\n\nMiss Knox was tucking the covers around his warm, sticky jowls. \"But he\nsaid you said--\"\n\n\"I said she said we said.\" Brooks grabbed her chin between his thumb\nand forefinger. \"Did you know that machine on the Silvertongue roof\ncould get at us inside our own homes?\"\n\nShe shook her head, swinging his arm from side to side.\n\n\"If you know nothing about it, girlie, let me explain.\" He squeezed\nher chin tighter. \"You saw those two men from the Christian E. Lodge\nCorporation--Silvertongue, that is--who came this afternoon to see\nBarger? The ones on motorskates?\"\n\n\"They shouldn't allow those buzzing things in the hospital. They\nmake more noise than a whirlybird.\" She backed away, tugging at the\nwhite-coated arm until her chin was released. \"I mean I saw them\nyesterday. They tried to get in the bird. I don't know why _they_ visit\nhim--he can't say a word. Doesn't he have a family?\"\n\n\"No, but the Silvertongue men love him like a brother. Barger designed\ntheir radiocompressor--the one in all the newspapers. Here, you can see\nit from the window if you--\"\n\n\"I know, Dr. Brooks.\"\n\n\"Do you know what that machine can really do, girlie?\"\n\n\"When I was your age--\" Miss Knox began.\n\n\"You are. I just _look_ young. That machine can cure and shred tobacco\nwith supra-short waves on a polished magnesium bowl, just the way\nthe papers say, but they have cheaper ways to process their tobacco.\nThey really use the machine for guided tours of the factory. Public\nrelations.\"\n\n\"You mean float visitors through the air?\"\n\n\"No. You'd need the power of ten maritime atomic piles in series just\nto lift Dr. Gesner to the height of--\"\n\n\"Very funny!\"\n\n\"--his own square root. What they can do with that machine is to\ndisguise an object--say the incoming leaf tobacco. They can make it\nlook firm, golden, and so forth. The girls at the sorting tables,\nwherever the guided tour happens to be, will all look like Norma\nNorden. They'll be dressed as angels and work in heaven. Then the\nV.I.P.s can tour the girls' homes and dormitories, and instead of a\ndirty slum, they'll see--they'll see _mushrooms_, if they like.\"\n\n\"How is it done?\"\n\n\"Only Barger Electronics really knows,\" said Dr. Brooks, \"and the\nChristian E. Lodge engineers. It's something to do with compressing the\nwave length to approximate that of light, so that images are canceled\nout. This leaves a clear field for subliminal techniques. If there are\nsubvisual images projected on the walls, for instance, that's what the\nobservers will see inside the room.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" exclaimed Miss Knox.\n\n\"The only other thing I know is that it has to be done with\nintersecting spheres. The machine has two portable secondary\ntransmitters--or projectors, or whatever they call them--each emitting\nin all directions to form a wave-sphere. Where the two spheres overlap,\nyou get your possible interference with light.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I just don't understand it.\"\n\n\"Any radio waves go out in all directions to form spheres.\" His voice\nhad become a mutter. \"You know that.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe gave a false sigh. \"Well, take an ordinary weak phone transmitter\nvery high up in a whirlybird. That's the simplest case. You know what\nsound a whirlybird makes, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Miss Knox.\n\n\"What?\" Dr. Brooks challenged, moving at her. \"How does it sound?\"\n\n\"Oh, clatter-clatter chug-chug,\" she said, moving back.\n\n\"No. Listen closely and you'll hear any whirlybird--especially hospital\nambulances--go _rackety-rackety-rack groundhog_, _rackety-rack\ngroundhog_!--a reminder to people that they belong on the ground, one\nmay assume. Picture a microphone attached outside the bird and wired to\nyour transmitter. The radio waves go out in all directions through the\nair. Suppose your air is all of the same density, and so forth--then\nall the waves peter out at a constant radius and form a perfect sphere\ngoing _rackety-rackety-rack groundhog_!\n\n\"Now compressed waves travel a certain number of feet--theoretically,\nthe number of foot-pounds of work the power input could perform\nmodified by a constant value called 'e'--and at that point they\nrevert to ordinary radio waves. This forms a sphere of compressed or\nsupra-short waves. Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Miss Knox.\n\n\"Well, anyway, where two spheres overlap, you get the Barger effect.\nAnd they can vary or limit the effect in interesting ways. Just move\none or both projectors so that the waves intersect each other in\ndifferent phases--\"\n\n\"That's a fascinating way to back me into a corner of the room, Dr.\nBrooks. Now will you please let me look at my patient?\"\n\nMr. Barger's body convulsed and twitched, and the disordered bedclothes\nexposed the pink, swollen layers of his throat. Only the face slept.\nMiss Knox reduced the feed on the water envelope, and with her palm\nbrushed drops of moisture from the burning, out-of-focus pink skin. The\ndrops were sticky and warm. She wiped her hands on a piece of cotton\nand started to prepare the blood transfusion.\n\n\"Before you get out of here,\" she said to Dr. Brooks, \"let me thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"For the information? You'll only forget it.\"\n\n\"No, for the crack about my age.\"\n\nSlumping his eyebrows, he went to the door and stepped through almost\nbefore it could slide open.\n\n\"Wait!\" she commanded in a stage whisper.\n\nHe appeared, the door sliding back harmlessly against his shoulder\nbefore it changed direction.\n\n\"What's so terrible?\" she asked. \"You talk as though that\nradiocompressor on the Silvertongue roof were going to destroy the\nAmerican home, at the very least.\"\n\n\"They don't just have to transmit within the factory,\" he said.\n\"Suppose they wanted you arrested. Say they didn't like brunettes.\nWell, first they get some dame to call police and say she's going to\ndo a strip in front of the Psychiatric Pavilion wall. Then they go\nacross First Avenue and set up a subliminal movie sequence of some\nstripper in action and focus it on the wall from their car. They set up\ntwo portable wave projectors and adjust their phasing to achieve the\nBarger effect in that one place. Then they wait for you to pass that\nspot on your way to church. Very little power is required; the actual\nradiocompression takes place across the river.\"\n\nBrooks raised his pants from the knees and minced across the room,\nexposing curly hair above his fallen argylls. His white coat twitched\nfrom side to side. \"Now here you come. A man watching the street from\nthe broken stool at the Green Gables twists one of his cufflinks, or\nmaybe he just whistles. This starts the projectors and you become\ninvisible, or very blurry, while the subliminal film gives the cops\nwhat they want. Then the whole thing shuts off and the cops can see\n_you_ again. You're hustled off to jail and they keep you there--along\nwith other enemies--by making a similar visual 'fix' on the results in\nsome polling place and putting in their own judge!\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll probably just use it for advertising.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Brooks. \"How would you like it if you were watching\ntelevision with your roommate, and all of a sudden she turned into a\ngiant pack of Silvertongue cigarettes?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWater dripped on her palm, leaving a red stain. A ringing, ringing, and\nthe whir of motorskates receded down the corridor. It rang and rang,\nher hand sticky and warm against her cheek. It rang.\n\nThe telephone. Trying to recapture something she had known, she\nlet groping fingers stretch toward the instrument. They descended,\nclenched, lifted. The ringing stopped.\n\nShe forced her eyes open far enough to see her white arm return.\nHunching up around her pillow with the receiver, she croaked, \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Miss Knox?\" A high voice. \"Boney--it's Boney--\"\n\n\"You have a nerve, Boney, to wake me up at this hour.\"\n\n\"This isn't Boney--it's Hilda Erwin. I'm on emergency duty and they've\nbrought in Boney. His throat is cut--\"\n\n\"_No!_ Is he alive?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. But he may never speak again. He lay there in the street for\nhours and hours. Dr. Gesner's internes are here--\"\n\n\"Oh, not being able to talk would be worse for him than dying. I'll\ncome! I'll be right there!\" Miss Knox dropped the receiver and swung\nout of bed, feeling in the darkness for her robe. She pulled it on and\nopened the door, and found her slippers in the faint yellow light from\nthe hallway.\n\nAs she ran, knotting the belt of her robe, she looked up and down the\nancient residential corridors for a motorbed. She stumbled against a\nrotten wood molding. She pressed the elevator button and turned, her\nloose hair swinging heavily, to face the flat eye of a clock. It was\nfive-fifteen.\n\nOverhead, the floor indicator creaked around its dial--seven, six,\nfive, four--and the doors opened. There was a motorbed on the elevator.\n\nShe stepped inside and pressed the button for seven, the lowest floor\nwith a bridge to the Mushroom. The doors shut and the car moved upward.\nTripping over the torn linoleum, she managed to fall backward onto the\nbed's driving seat. She swung her legs around and turned on the switch.\n\nAs the doors opened, she drove out with a jolt and entered the\nsparkling newness of a tubular bridge which rose through the night\nacross First Avenue. The Mushroom towered overhead, its spiral\ncorridors glowing. Night traffic vibrated beneath her as she crossed--a\ncrowd of trucks was baying north along the hidden cobblestones,\nfollowing traffic lights which jumped from red to green, one after\nanother, like an electronic rabbit. The trucks passed out of sight\nunder their own diesel cloud and another pack approached in a higher\nkey....\n\nThen a lurch as towing cables grated and took hold in the curve of the\nmany-windowed corridor. Whining under glass, the motorbed veered off\nin a rising circle around the stem of the Mushroom. Around and around\nagain, faster, while room numbers flashed red one by one on the silver\ndoors, over the river, over the roof garden of the Administration wing,\nover the river, over the garden, around and around and out, out--far\nout over a city of dark crumbling toys and up and up over the rim....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe approached the great transparent dome of the Mushroom looking ahead\ninto the sky, as though enemies in immense distance were triangulating\nupon her. An echo of voices rolled out. Far across the marble floor,\none of the emergency rooms had its lights on. The door opened and a\ntiny figure in a motorchair sped out and along the wall, followed by\na line of running dolls in white. Some of them clustered around the\nman in the chair, waving their arms. Thinning like a comet's tail, the\nprocession vanished down the south escalator. The door of the room slid\nshut.\n\nShe hurtled across beneath the stars and drove straight at the room,\napplying brakes sharply with a tightening in her stomach as the door\nbegan to open. Her long hair swept forward against her cheeks and\nshoulders. She jarred to a stop inside and rose, refocusing her senses\non the enclosed white space.\n\nThe bedside table held a pot of paper geraniums. Something lay beneath\nthe covers like lumber on edge, the angles of knees projecting\nsideways. Out of the sheets stuck part of a thin white drainpipe neck\nand a face like a broken roof shingle, over which the weeping Miss\nErwin cast her shadow.\n\nBrooks sat hunched over the stool, fingers buried in his hair. His lab\ncoat was twisted awry; a bare knee protruded between two buttons.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Miss Knox.\n\n\"He's all right,\" Miss Erwin sobbed at her. \"Delinquents--vandals--they\ncut his throat by the river, right in front of the hospital. The mutape\nsays--he didn't--see their faces.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about him,\" said a low muttered voice. \"He's been\nconscious. The doctors say he'll speak, in time.\" Dr. Brooks had raised\nhis head and was trying to cover himself with the lab coat.\n\n\"River rats,\" Miss Knox snapped, peering at Boney's wasted face. \"What\ndo you mean, in time?\"\n\n\"Two or three weeks. An expert job of quick surgery, really.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" Miss Erwin broke into a fit of sobbing and blindly rearranged\nthe flowers.\n\n\"Do you mean to say?--\"\n\n\"Some medical students on a horror spree. Damned age of--what did that\nWashington press secretary say?--'atomic hyper-specialization'! That\nmeans young brains growing in channels until they explode through the\nwall. You remember the physicist who killed his colleagues when the\nEnglish won the Nobel Prize.\"\n\n\"It can't be,\" said Miss Knox. She watched the hurt man grimace\nsomewhere along his razor edge of nightmare.\n\n\"It's the only likelihood. Well, we can't do anything for him now, and\nyou look a little beat. Come on, I'll buy you coffee from the vending\nmachine on the Administration roof.\"\n\nDr. Brooks stood up, lifted Miss Knox gently beneath the arms and sat\nher on the motorbed, then swung a hairy shin over the driving seat.\nThey rolled through the doorway.\n\n\"Who was that big shot in the motorchair?\" Miss Knox asked. \"Dr.\nGesner?\"\n\nDawn had just begun to spread. They crossed within a widening circle\nof mushroom-shaped arches containing portraits which drew farther away\nuntil they resembled portal guards, and then converged again in full\nausterity on the opposite side of the great dome.\n\n\"Director himself--they can't reach Gesner anyplace,\" Brooks said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey started to descend inward from the Mushroom's edge. Numbers\nflashed by as they spiraled down faster along the self-steering guide\nrail. Over the river, over the garden. Over the river....\n\nShe leaned back against the pillows. \"What was himself doing in the\nhospital at this hour?\" she asked.\n\n\"As a matter of fact\"--his shadow crossed her face as he moved the\ndeceleration lever--\"he was with me.\"\n\n\"With you?\"\n\n\"I was listening to the newscasts in bed. He came to see me because,\nas resident radiologist, I'm the only person who knows anything at all\nabout electronics. While we listened, his assistant with the high voice\ncalled him on my phone and told him about Boney.\"\n\n\"How did he react?\"\n\nBrooks swung his tiller bar and they veered onto the roof of the\nAdministration wing, the door behind them cutting off all light\nfrom inside the Mushroom. They were in a formal garden filled with\nscent, and surrounded by distant hedges. The few remaining stars were\nsurprised naked, floating above a monstrous concrete bird-bath.\n\n\"Like a bureaucrat,\" he muttered as they rolled to a stop. \"First he\nrequisitioned flowers. He's probably in here somewhere now, plotting\nrevenge against the Commissary clerk who issued the knife they found\nnear Boney. I know he'd love to see you rushing in your bathrobe to\nother people's emergencies.\"\n\n\"Disgusting. And they call him the Father of the Mushroom. Big shot.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked. \"After all, he _is_ a bureaucrat. How did you\nyourself react--like a woman, no?\"\n\nHe helped her down. They walked within a double row of mountain laurels\nto the coffee machine.\n\n\"I'd forgotten all about the bathrobe,\" she said. \"Black for me.\"\n\n\"One day soon,\" he muttered, \"they'll build him a mushroom he'll never\nsee the end of. Sandwich? Anything?\"\n\n\"No.\" She took the warm plastic cup and sipped. It was bad coffee. Far\nbelow, a snort of traffic echoed down First Avenue. \"I've only been\nhere once before. I'm a bit lower-echelon for the Administrative roof.\"\n\n\"Who isn't?\"\n\nShe looked past the white-on-red Emergency Exit sign to a wrought-iron\ngate in the hedge facing the river. \"Look, the Silvertongue factory is\nall lit up. Every single window on the top floor.\"\n\n\"I should think so. You mean you don't _know_?\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"My heavens, the fate of man's grasp on reality is being decided\ntonight! Congress was still in special session at five A.M.--still is,\nas far as I know.\"\n\n\"Session over what? Don't tell me the bombs have started.\"\n\n\"Visual interference by radio wave compression. Yesterday the Royalty\ncalled an immediate special session. There is at present _no law_ to\nprevent the Christian E. Lodge Corporation from buying the right to\ntamper with light waves in the home, for advertising purposes or--God\nknows what other kinds of control.\"\n\n\"I didn't know. I was on duty with Mr. Barger and then no one told me.\"\n\n\"Barger was against it,\" said Dr. Brooks. \"He sold them the device\nwith a set of conditions on its use, but now they're buying the patent\noutright.\"\n\n\"But--don't they have to wait for him? Barger Electronics is his\ncompany.\"\n\n\"No. He's chairman of the board, but any three or more directors can\nsell the patent. Once it's sold, there will be nothing Congress can do.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Miss Knox, staring out over the water. Some of the\nSilvertongue windows had winked out. The others vanished together,\nleaving only a pale vertical row to mark the fire stairs.\n\nThree bells sounded.\n\n\"Your attention please!\"--a piping male voice.\n\nBrooks said, \"I'll bet it's the Director himself.\"\n\n\"In a moment,\" shrilled the voice, \"we will tune in the broadcast\ndirect from Washington so that all personnel can hear history in the\nmaking. After the congressional vote, Dr. Hamilton, our director, will\nhonor us with a few words here in the hospital, which he will repeat\nlater for the benefit of the day shift.\"\n\nThere was a ringing tone, growling in volume like the approach of\nmotorskates.\n\n\"I told you,\" Brooks shouted over the noise. \"His family has stock in\nSilvertongue.\"\n\n\"... been informed that a purchase has been completed of full rights to\nthe Barger Radiocompressor. I warn you that this device will be used\nindiscriminately against the public interest.\" The voice was strong\nbut unsteady. \"Barger engineers have been withdrawn. There are no\ncontrols--\"\n\n\"Too late,\" said Brooks. \"That's Thorpe of Louisiana.\"\n\n\"Bear with me now. I do not doubt that visual interference is already\nbeing used to disrupt this session of Congress. Do you understand? I\nhave a blinding headache, brought about externally, I am quite certain.\nI can no longer read the notes in front of me. If what I say is still\nsense, I insist I want a vote, immediate vote, to make this thing\nillegal--illegal, and let the New York City police or the Militia or\nthe Army--the Army....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn sudden silence, she clung to Brooks' sleeve.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said the piping voice from within the hospital,\n\"the House of Representatives is still far from approaching a vote.\nWe will tune in debate on the Senate floor, being broadcast by another\nnetwork.\"\n\n\"... alleged that Patent Number 90,732,440B has something to do with\nnational safety. I assure you, gentlemen--ladies and gentlemen--that\nAmerican business ethics will prevent such dangerous use of technology\nnow as in the past, and that any weapons application will be confined\nstrictly to that sphere where weapons are themselves a safety\nfactor--the sphere of national defense against foreign aggressors.\n\n\"It has further been alleged that there is some connection between\nPatent Number 90,732,440B and the hospitalization of Mr. William Barger\nof Barger Electronics Company, Incorporated, who is currently afflicted\nwith\"--the Senator breathed a chuckle--\"laryngitis.\n\n\"It has even been supposed by certain Senators that the non-fatal\nstabbing of Nathan Bonaparte, a part-time employee....\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the voice from within the hospital said, \"we\nwill tune in again when the matter is brought to a vote. And now--Dr.\nHamilton.\"\n\nA long pause filled with buzzing.\n\n\"People,\" said the Director, and the buzzing ended. \"There is no war.\nLet me repeat: there is no atomic war going on.\" He paused.\n\n\"Now there has been a lot of fuss over a steel tower on a factory\nacross the river. I want to make it clear that no advertising gimmicks\nwill change our job here. All hospitals--public, like ours, or even our\nesteemed allies, the private hospitals--are bound by medical and staff\nethics to pay no official attention to the world of advertising.\n\n\"I am especially amazed by rumors that Nat Bonaparte, or 'Boney,' who\ndoes clean-up work here from time to time, was silenced because he\n'knew something' about this wonderful advertising gimmick. Nothing can\nbe sillier. It just happens that the fellow left _my_ office shortly\nbefore he must have been wounded by delinquents from the nearby slums.\nHe was giving me 'inside information,' as he called it, about light-ray\nguns, and mechanical hypnotism, and plots against the patients. These,\napparently, are the things which Boney 'knew,' and he has been talking\nendlessly about them since I first came into office, and presumably\nbefore.\"\n\nBrooks struck two cigarettes against his pack and handed one to Miss\nKnox. Their first puff obscured his puzzled frown.\n\n\"This _fuss_ I am talking about,\" continued the Director, \"has been\ntaken as grounds for wild infringement of any and all regulations\nby personnel of this hospital. I want it made perfectly clear that\nmotorbeds not in official use should be stored in the proper supply\nrooms, according to the chart in the Commissary office. We are setting\nup a daily check-in system--\"\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" said Miss Knox.\n\n\"--to prevent further misuse of this equipment.\"\n\n\"Get on the bed,\" said Dr. Brooks. \"If they saw you go up to Boney, we\ncan't leave it here.\"\n\n\"_Furthermore_, any private or unauthorized use of this or other\nhospital equipment may be punished by immediate dismissal--\"\n\nMiss Knox took a step toward the motorbed. \"I'd like to look in on Mr.\nBarger.\"\n\n\"--with _particular_ application to the young woman who used a motorbed\ntonight to visit a sick friend.\"\n\nMiss Knox stood feet apart, hands on hips. \"The dirty son of a bitch,\"\nshe said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Erwin came running across the Mushroom, white pumps clacketing\nhalf off her feet. \"Oh!\" she said, and stopped, panting. \"Has the world\nreally been taken over by admen?\"\n\nBrooks stopped the motorbed. \"Just America,\" he said, \"and only a\nfew admen.\" He helped Miss Knox down and they all walked toward the\nemergency rooms.\n\n\"Boney is fine, Dr. Brooks,\" said Miss Erwin. \"He just went back to\nsleep. But Mr. Barger is not feeling well.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Barger awake?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Doctor, but he was moaning. A sort of breath-moan, with his\neyes still shut. Dr. Feld took a mutape and said he wasn't getting\nregular delirium patterns at all.\"\n\n\"Has Dr. Gesner been here?\"\n\n\"We've tried and tried to reach him, but he left no word with his\noffice or at home. His nurses are terribly worried about him, and his\nwife--oh, Miss Knox, do you suppose he drinks?\" Miss Erwin's forehead\ngrew a splotch of pink. \"_Oh_, I'm sorry, Doctor! I'm terribly upset.\"\n\n\"Go home, Hilda,\" said Miss Knox. \"I can handle things--I go on in less\nthan an hour, anyway. Let's foul up Hamilton's schedule.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss _Knox_!\"\n\n\"Just one more thing--before you go to bed, get a uniform from my room\nand give it to Miss Kelly, to bring with her when she comes up for day\nshift. If my door is open, close it.\"\n\n\"Here's a key.\" Dr. Brooks said. \"Give it to one of the attendants in\nthe dining room. If no one's eating breakfast yet, leave it with Old\nMan Mackey. Say that I want some linens and a suit--any suit--brought\nup for me when the shift changes. Not before.\"\n\n\"What color socks, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Any color.\"\n\n\"Thanks so much,\" said Miss Erwin, backing toward the escalator.\n\nBrooks muttered, \"The Mushroom doesn't suit her looks.\"\n\n\"She's too young,\" said Miss Knox. \"What's-his-name who designed\nit--you know, the one who did the museums--was ninety-four.\"\n\n\"He's still designing,\" said Brooks.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you? Preferably against regulations.\" She\nwatched him lock the door and close the viewplate, and rummage in the\nmanila folder at the foot of the bed.\n\n\"I don't know what's wrong with these people,\" Dr. Brooks muttered.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked over his shoulder.\n\n\"They've gotten their tapes crossed! That idiot Feld must have had this\nin his machine when he came. It's some accident victim's tape--one\nhundred per cent unverbalized pain, and the victim was _wide awake_\nwhen he made it. It might be Boney's tape. This man here has been in\ncoma since this--since yesterday morning, thank heaven.\"\n\n\"Poor Boney,\" said Miss Knox, adjusting Mr. Barger's covers and her own\nloose hair. As though in answer, Mr. Barger stirred feebly, raising\nhis arm.\n\n\"Honey, there isn't much we can do,\" said Dr. Brooks.\n\n\"You're right.\" She glanced down and plucked at the bathrobe around her\nsmooth lace-bordered throat. \"Can't save the world in my old nightgown.\"\n\nHe took her by the shoulders and bent his head toward the palpitating\nmuscle in her throat.\n\nLeaning back against the edge of the bed, she held him at arm's length.\nShe wet her lips and said, \"Did I tell you I'm supposed to wear\nglasses?\"\n\nHe sprawled forward into her embrace. Her dark mane tumbled thickly\nover Mr. Barger. They twisted and pulled each other down to the floor,\nfreeing loose strands of hair from the blanket's electricity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe opened her eyes and saw a flat briefcase with a coil antenna\nsticking out.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" whispered Dr. Brooks.\n\n\"On the bottom of the bed!\"\n\nHe pressed his cheek to the floor and examined the under-carriage of\nMr. Barger's motorbed.\n\n\"Projector!\" He reached in and tugged at the object, bracing his other\nhand against the driveshaft. \"Help me, quick!\"\n\nShe grasped smooth leather and pulled, her nails making scars, as he\nslid under the bed and hammered with his fist. \"It's hooked on the\nother way,\" she said. He pulled, and the briefcase fell heavily to the\nfloor.\n\nDr. Brooks rolled to his feet, kicking the object into the light, and\nyanked at its buckles and straps. \"My bag is somewhere near the chair.\nGet the mutape on him, fast!\"\n\nShe found his black satchel on the floor, plugged into the computer\noutlet and spread the apparatus over Mr. Barger's bed. She made a\ntrembling fist around the Broca cup, and watched the dormant pink\ncheeks and eyelids as she lowered the cup toward his skull.\n\nThe rubber rim thudded against empty air, pleating like a horse's\nmuzzle as she pushed. The sleeping Barger face remained a picture\nglowing out of reach inches beneath her straining fist, behind a smell\nof blood. A hand from under the covers grasped her wrist....\n\nShe struggled. Dr. Brooks, at the telephone, contorted his face and\nheaved the briefcase against the wall. It shattered into coils and\nsmashed tubes and pieces of electronic chassis like a shower of silver\nChristmas ornaments, and a moan from the bed faded away.\n\nBrooks shouted and hung up the phone. The mutape was chattering\nviolently. He unlocked the door, flung himself to the bed and took\nthe recorder between his hands. The grasp on her wrist relaxed, and\nshe leaned over to decipher the punched tape as it unrolled from the\nmachine. Its dot patterns were unverbalized bloody agony, cleanly\nformulated in computer language.\n\n\"He'll verbalize,\" Brooks said. \"Just don't look at him--thank God\nthey've found Gesner.\"\n\nA red, bloated forehead above eyes fixed on her own through lenses of\ngray fluid as it writhed and pressed up against the Broca cup in her\nfist. She covered her face, and between her fingers the sleeping Barger\nface still lay on its pillow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Brooks screwed his own features into a wink, and she turned away to\nwatch the unrolling tape still chattering between his hands: \"England\nis the only hope. We must go through immediately before direct control\nand defenses build against us--morphine, why did you not give me\nmorphine? Pain is intolerable.\"\n\n\"Analgesics nullify the Gesner shots,\" Brooks said.\n\n\"Morphine,\" chattered the tape, \"worth it, worth it, cure me when we\nhave left for England. And hurry, they want me alive, and as soon as\nthey control the police....\"\n\nTurning under Dr. Brooks' twisted glance as he took the Broca cup,\nshe went to the sink and scrubbed her hands. She found the hypodermic\nand phial in the black satchel and measured two cc of clear tincture\nof morphine, and turned back to the arm which grasped Dr. Brooks'\nwrist, pressing the cup hard against a swollen red mass. She rolled up\nthe sleeve of the hospital gown which led to a raised shoulder (she\nwouldn't look at the face) and hesitated--another needle was already\nstuck in the muscle, protruding just above the skin. She found the vein\nand pushed the plunger in, and withdrew her needle.\n\nDr. Brooks said, \"Get that out of there.\"\n\nShe took tweezers from her bathrobe pocket and carefully removed an\ninch of broken hypodermic shaft. The blood spurted. She reached for\ncotton and alcohol.\n\nThree bells rang in the corridor as the door slid open, and Miss Erwin\ncame fluttering in.\n\n\"Don't look, Hilda!\" warned Miss Knox.\n\n\"Calling the emergency rooms,\" said a piping voice. \"Beware of patient\nWilliam Barger who may attempt to escape. He may be armed....\"\n\nThe mutape chattered.\n\n\"Here, take the cup,\" said Dr. Brooks. He picked up the bedside chair\nand placed it on the foot of the bed. Climbing onto the swaying surface\nlike a trained ape, he reached up and loosened the screws which held\nthe light globe in place on the ceiling, and threw it to shatter on\nthe floor. Miss Erwin stepped backward. Then she tiptoed toward the\nlight and steadied the chair, and stared at the patient's face in\nfascination. Dr. Brooks was tugging at an object resembling a camera,\nattached by a spring clamp between the bulbs of the ceiling fixture.\n\n\"Hilda!\" Miss Knox said.\n\n\"Oh, look at his face now!\"\n\n\"Subliminal picture slide,\" said Dr. Brooks, dropping the object to the\nfloor with a crash. \"There goes his sweet sleeping face--an illusion\nfilling in for reality _because there was nothing else for us to see_.\"\n\nMr. Barger's face was blotched red and covered with shiny ooze. His\nthroat was swollen as thick as his cheeks, with lumpy rolls of neck\nstretched taut like strands of pink beads above the bedsheet. His mouth\nwas hidden beneath caked blood.\n\nThe mutape read, \"You are running out of time.\"\n\nThree bells in the corridor as the door slid open. \"Calling Dr.\nGesner,\" said a cool nurse's voice. \"Emergency. Calling Dr. Feld.\nEmergency.\"\n\nFive internes scurried in, surrounding the figure on the bed. Behind\nthem strode rawboned Dr. Feld in a red hunting jacket. A motorchair\nrolled after him and stopped in the doorway, and an assistant\nadministrator stood up and piped, \"Hold him! He may be armed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the mutape chattering and Dr. Brooks bent close over the recorder,\nMiss Knox stood up and prepared her needle with penicillin from the\nblack satchel.\n\n\"Don't kill him,\" the administrator whined.\n\nThree bells in the corridor. \"All personnel,\" said the nurse's voice.\n\"Day shift, please take notice. Beware of a patient, armed, seeking to\nescape from the emergency floor. All hospital personnel. Beware of a\npatient....\"\n\nBig Carl kicked the motorchair out of the doorway, stepped through and\nhanded Dr. Brooks a blue serge suit on a hanger. After him came a nurse\ncarrying a white uniform and a paper bag. The room was filled with an\necho of voices spreading across the Mushroom.\n\n\"Step back,\" said Dr. Feld, stumbling over an interne.\n\nTwo student nurses came to the doorway and stood on either side, one\nwith her hand in the photocell beam to keep the door from closing. The\nnoise grew.\n\n\"Calling Dr. Gesner,\" said the cool nurse's voice.\n\nA group of internes shuffled inside, faces averted, moving sideways in\nthe crowd around the bed. Two attendants came striding up and stood on\neither side of the door, next to the student nurses.\n\nA class of medical students filed in and moved along the wall, the\ntaller ones standing on tiptoe to see the patient. A bearded professor\nin tweeds followed, whispering, \"Here he comes, here he comes.\"\n\nAfter a pause, Dr. Gesner waddled through the doorway between his\nnurses. Three internes came after with white coats flying open, the\nmiddle one a Hindu in a blue sash, and then a messenger boy calling,\n\"Telegram for Dr. Gesner!\" Three bells rang in the corridor, and the\ndoor slid shut.\n\nA path cleared before Dr. Gesner as he made his way to the bed. Helped\nto a sitting position, he opened the telegram which had been passed\nfrom interne to interne.\n\n\"You don't mind,\" he said, turning to the patient's bloody face. He\nread the message and threw it away. \"The police have been holding me\nfor two days. Here my lawyers have a nice case against City Hall, just\nwhen this England business comes up--so you're the man who's dangerous\nand armed! I'm sure Hamilton isn't responsible for that story.\"\n\nDr. Gesner had removed some of the cake with Miss Knox's tweezers and\nwas prodding the lipless inflammation.\n\n\"Wash this off as gently as you can,\" said Dr. Gesner, and Miss Knox\nstepped forward. \"And the antiseptic ointment in my bag--it has a\npurple label.\"\n\n\"I had to give him morphine,\" said Dr. Brooks.\n\n\"Ah--and some antibiotic?\"\n\n\"Penicillin,\" said Miss Knox.\n\n\"Ah. Now tell me, where is this other man who was put out of commission\nby these--these throat specialists? I'd like to examine him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mutape chattered suddenly and then stopped. Dr. Brooks bent and\nread out loud, \"Get those two on motorskates! I know them. They appear\nblond with their projector fields turned on; otherwise they are both\nnarrow-faced and dark.\"\n\nDr. Gesner smiled with just the middle of his face. \"We caught them in\nthe lobby on our way in. One of my lawyers is coming with us. His son\nplays right tackle--young lady!\" He looked straight at Miss Knox. \"I\nunderstand you've been talking about this business for days, along with\nour friend with the cut throat. You've been in danger--those two men\nwere still in the building on your account, I'm sure. It's a very good\nthing you weren't alone, you or Dr. Brooks. I take it you were both on\nnight duty.\"\n\nDr. Brooks said, \"If any of the nurses or Dr. Gesner's students don't\nknow what this is all about, I'm sure he'll make an announcement when\nwe're all on the way to England. You must have some idea of what's\nhappened. If anyone doesn't want to come, of course--\"\n\n\"Treason and insubordination!\" piped a hidden voice. \"Under the\ncircumstances, Dr. Hamilton will have you jailed when he finds out what\nyou're up to, Dr. Brooks.\"\n\nBrooks stretched his arm between two students and pulled a switch on\nthe wall. The ceiling began to open, sweeping bright sunshine down\nthe wall and making metal buttons twinkle on Dr. Feld's jacket. The\nceiling slid back on rollers with a rumbling sound, until nothing was\noverheard but the black dots of aircraft rising toward the sun. Nearby,\na whirlybird took off with a _rackety-rackety-rackety-rack_!\n\n\"I phoned the Director,\" Dr. Brooks told the crowd. \"He's not\ninterfering. In fact, I'm pretty sure Dr. Hamilton will come.\"\n\n\"Dr. Feld,\" said Dr. Gesner, \"will you show the adman out?\"\n\n\"I'm not--\"\n\nThere was the sound of a blow and the assistant administrator appeared,\nscrabbling for his motorchair, which was buried among the students.\nHis spindle limbs flailed from one side to the other until he was\npropelled from the room at a run, screaming, and the messenger boy\nvanished after him. Three bells rang in the corridor as the door closed.\n\nDr. Gesner raised his hand and voices were stilled, the shuffle of feet\nended and the mutape chattered alone in the sunshine. He leaned over\nand read the tape, and as he straightened his back, even the recorder\nstopped still. He heaved himself to his feet with the help of two\ninternes.\n\n\"He says--\" puffed Dr. Gesner--\"he says this is no time for sadism.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Last ones up, girlie,\" said Dr. Brooks.\n\nShe sat on the bed and the mutape spoke to her noisily. Big Carl had\nhooked two cables in place, Dr. Brooks the other two, and the floor\nplatform began to rise through the room toward the maw of the hovering\nwhirlybird. She tucked the covers gently around her patient's distorted\nthroat.\n\nThe chatter stopped. She read, \"This is something the Royalty\npredicted for weeks ahead of time. I thought we could avoid it,\nbut the Silvertongue people must have fed me the virus at our last\nluncheon meeting. Then when negotiations remained uncertain--thanks to\nRoyalty sentiment on my board--they came visiting while I slept and\ninjected me with a larger dose and planted the projectors. I woke up\nin awful pain. You were there, young lady--I screamed, silently, with\nmy features. I was unable to raise my head. You wiped blood from my\ncheeks with your palm and cleaned it on a piece of cotton. You thought\nit was under water. Your eyes turned away before your hand left the\nprojector field--or else you could not see what you could not expect.\nWhile I looked on, you treated me like a sleeping baby and asked Dr.\nBrooks about radio....\" The perforated tape had stopped feeding from\nthe machine.\n\n\"His tape!\" she cried.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Dr. Brooks said. \"We're unplugged from the hospital\nsystem, but I reserved the only ambulance with its own computer\ncircuit. It conveys limited ideas, but that's better than nothing.\"\n\nBig Carl had erected the safety gates. \"Look below,\" he said.\n\nShe stood up and pressed her forehead to the latticework of the nearest\ngate. At first there was only a diamond-shaped patch of sky, with the\nSilvertongue factory in the bottom corner. Then, as the platforms\nswung on its cables, she saw the curved edge of the Mushroom, and the\nAdministration roof swarming with figures on motorskates. They circled\namong the squat mountain laurels, pointing upward. The ambulance walls\nsettled around her suddenly blocking the view, and the belly of the\nvehicle rumbled shut. With a bump, the floor platform was deposited on\nits girders.\n\nDr. Brooks said, \"We're away--I'll have the pilot phone the others!\"\n\n\"Where's the socket?\" Miss Knox asked. \"Mr. Barger and I were talking.\"\n\nDr. Brooks plugged into an overhead beam and the mutape immediately\nbegan to chatter: \"What is your first name, Miss Knox?\"\n\n\"Delia,\" she said.\n\n\"Pete Brooks.\"\n\n\"Carl,\" the big man growled as he folded the gates.\n\n\"Call me Bill,\" said Mr. Barger's tape. Mr. Barger's square hand\nmotioned her closer beside him. \"Delia, do you know what we must do\nwhen we reach England? We must use the atom bomb first, before the\nadmen have full control. Only then may we return to the America we\nknow. The real America.\"\n\n\"Do the English know?\" asked Miss Knox.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said. \"They heard the broadcasts, and their scientists\nunderstood. They have supported our Royalty Party for years. I think I\ncould increase the range of my device and reach America before they\nreached England--but there is no time for that. The world must unite\nagainst invasion. Even the Russians know that there is no limit to the\nscope or methods of greedy marketing specialists\"--the machine punched\nout a pattern of giggles and chuckles--\"and I doubt if the Russians\ncould ever invent a radiocompressor.\"\n\n\"Are _all_ the admen part of this?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not, young lady! The very great majority has always\nfollowed a strict code of ethics that the very small minority has\nalways subverted. Many ethical admen are in the birds now, on their way\nto England--knowing perfectly well that England is poor territory for\nemotional salesmanship.\"\n\n\"But why a Royalty Party in a democracy?\" Miss Knox asked.\n\n\"Royalty--\" The tape showed amusement. \"Not aristocracy. Royalty, as in\nshare of and control over. Motto of the Royalty Party: 'The inventor is\nworthy of his invention,' meaning the right to say how his discovery\nshall or shall not be used--or not be used at all, if it can only be\ndestructive--as well as sharing in the proceeds. Unreasonable attitudes\nare not possible; we have an Appeals Board that can overrule a\npig-headed patentee. Radiocompressors were intended for beautification\nof environment, not deception or thought control.\"\n\n\"Why England?\" she persisted.\n\n\"Pretty generally, the Royalty code is and has been standard procedure\nthere. Like their constitution, it hasn't had to be put in writing.\"\n\n\"Aren't there slums and unsightly monuments in England, too?\"\n\n\"Of course. Why do you think they would like to have the invention? But\nit's safe there; it won't be subverted to thought control and sales\nengineering.... Tell me, Delia, is Dr. Gesner on this ambulance? I\nwould like to meet him.\"\n\nDr. Brooks had come back from the control room. He sat beside\nher on the bed. \"Dr. Gesner went ahead with Dr. Hamilton,\" he\nsaid, \"because you're healthier than either one of them. But, Mr.\nBarger--Bill--doesn't light-wave interference need two overlapping\nprojectors plus the subliminal image? We only found one.\"\n\nThe recorder chattered: \"I am sure the other is also somewhere in the\nbed. It is harmless by itself, and I am glad we have it--it will help\nme instruct a team of British physicists and engineers. But who is in\nthe other compartment? I hate to play chess with the same people over\nand over.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he doesn't play,\" said Brooks. \"I think it's old Boney, who\nhad his throat cut because your friends thought he might get you some\nhelp too soon.\"\n\nThe recorder punched out, \"I would like to meet him,\" as Miss Knox\njumped from the bed, pulling Dr. Brooks by the arm. The machine\nchattered again briefly and she stopped and read, \"Do not neglect\nme altogether,\" and ran on. She opened the door to the other bed\ncompartment.\n\nMiss Erwin fell on her with a cuddly embrace, and then Dr. Brooks\nreached over her shoulder to shake Miss Erwin's hand. \"How's the\npatient?\" he asked.\n\nAcross the compartment, Boney's face expanded in a three-cornered smile.\n\n\"At least he slept,\" said Miss Erwin. \"That poor Mr. Barger--all the\ntime we thought he was in coma, he was wide awake!\"\n\nMiss Knox said, \"Oh, my God!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hear more jets!\" wailed Miss Erwin's voice from the other room.\n\"Why are they all flying home tonight, and we have to leave? Carl, are\nwe--are we a quarter of the way to England?\"\n\n\"No,\" Big Carl answered.\n\nMiss Knox called through the doorway, \"This one won't let me open the\nhatch!\"\n\nHunched across the bed, his hair falling over his forehead, Dr. Brooks\nplayed chess with Mr. Barger. \"Not in here,\" he said. \"You can open the\nemergency hatch in back if you like night air. But don't expect to see\nthe bombers--or anything but our own landing gear.\"\n\nShe slid past him and shut herself into the small rear compartment and\nturned out the light. She felt for the emergency lock and swung her\nweight backward as the damp black air screamed in and tugged at her\nface--the whirlybird showed its fat thigh with a _rackety-rackety-rack\ngroundhog_! Tears ran down her cheeks, distorting her first view of\ndarkness.\n\nBeyond the machine's ungainly silhouette she peered and saw flashes of\nyellow light on water--but nothing, nothing familiar. Thus, squinting\ndesperately toward home, she noticed it, marking the horizon. A glowing\nmushroom. It must have been gigantic.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Don't Look Now, by Leonard Rubin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DON'T LOOK NOW ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51740.txt or 51740.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/4/51740/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
