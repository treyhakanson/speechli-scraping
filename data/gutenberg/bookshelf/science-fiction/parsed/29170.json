Or it may be so\n    shadowed by Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have\n    occurred in his absence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This\n    rarely discerning, warmly human story by a brilliant newcomer to the\n    science fantasy field is told with no pulling of punches, and its\n    adroit unfolding will astound you._\n\n\n    the\n hoofer\n\n _by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr._\n\n\n A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\n in the full vigor of youth do--if his heart cries out for a home?\n\n\nThey all knew he was a spacer because of the white goggle marks on his\nsun-scorched face, and so they tolerated him and helped him. They even\nmade allowances for him when he staggered and fell in the aisle of the\nbus while pursuing the harassed little housewife from seat to seat and\ncajoling her to sit and talk with him.\n\nHaving fallen, he decided to sleep in the aisle. Two men helped him to\nthe back of the bus, dumped him on the rear seat, and tucked his gin\nbottle safely out of sight. After all, he had not seen Earth for nine\nmonths, and judging by the crusted matter about his eyelids, he couldn't\nhave seen it too well now, even if he had been sober. Glare-blindness,\ngravity-legs, and agoraphobia were excuses for a lot of things, when a\nman was just back from Big Bottomless. And who could blame a man for\nacting strangely?\n\nMinutes later, he was back up the aisle and swaying giddily over the\nlittle housewife. \"How!\" he said. \"Me Chief Broken Wing. You wanta\nIndian wrestle?\"\n\nThe girl, who sat nervously staring at him, smiled wanly, and shook her\nhead.\n\n\"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he burbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n\nThe two men slid out of their seats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's go back to bed.\"\n\n\"My name's Hogey,\" he said. \"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding about\nbeing a Indian.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a drink.\" They got him on his feet, and\nled him stumbling back down the aisle.\n\n\"My ma was half Cherokee, see? That's how come I said it. You wanta hear\na war whoop? Real stuff.\"\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\nHe cupped his hands to his mouth and favored them with a blood-curdling\nproof of his ancestry, while the female passengers stirred restlessly\nand hunched in their seats. The driver stopped the bus and went back to\nwarn him against any further display. The driver flashed a deputy's\nbadge and threatened to turn him over to a constable.\n\n\"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey told him. \"I got me a son now, that's why.\nYou know? A little baby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen him yet.\"\n\n\"Will you just sit still and be quiet then, eh?\"\n\nBig Hogey nodded emphatically. \"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to make\nany trouble.\"\n\nWhen the bus started again, he fell on his side and lay still. He made\nretching sounds for a time, then rested, snoring softly. The bus driver\nwoke him again at Caine's junction, retrieved his gin bottle from behind\nthe seat, and helped him down the aisle and out of the bus.\n\nBig Hogey stumbled about for a moment, then sat down hard in the gravel\nat the shoulder of the road. The driver paused with one foot on the\nstep, looking around. There was not even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building next to the railroad track, a couple of\nfarmhouses at the edge of a side-road, and, just across the way, a\ndeserted filling station with a sagging roof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n\nBig Hogey got up and staggered around in front of the bus, clutching at\nit for support, losing his duffle bag.\n\n\"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The driver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted around after his troublesome passenger, taking his\narm as he sagged again. \"You crossing?\"\n\n\"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme alone, I'm okay.\"\n\nThe driver started across the highway with him. The traffic was sparse,\nbut fast and dangerous in the central ninety-mile lane.\n\n\"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting. \"I'm a tumbler, ya know? Gravity's\ngot me. Damn gravity. I'm not used to gravity, ya know? I used to be a\ntumbler--_huk!_--only now I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count of li'l Hogey. You\nknow about li'l Hogey?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Your son. Come on.\"\n\n\"Say, you gotta son? I bet you gotta son.\"\n\n\"Two kids,\" said the driver, catching Hogey's bag as it slipped from his\nshoulder. \"Both girls.\"\n\n\"Say, you oughta be home with them kids. Man oughta stick with his\nfamily. You oughta get another job.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly, waggled a\nmoralistic finger, skidded on the gravel as they stepped onto the\nopposite shoulder, and sprawled again.\n\nThe driver blew a weary breath, looked down at him, and shook his head.\nMaybe it'd be kinder to find a constable after all. This guy could get\nhimself killed, wandering around loose.\n\n\"Somebody supposed to meet you?\" he asked, squinting around at the dusty\nhills.\n\n\"_Huk!_--who, me?\" Hogey giggled, belched, and shook his head. \"Nope.\nNobody knows I'm coming. S'prise. I'm supposed to be here a week ago.\"\nHe looked up at the driver with a pained expression. \"Week late, ya\nknow? Marie's gonna be sore--woo-_hoo_!--is she gonna be sore!\" He\nwaggled his head severely at the ground.\n\n\"Which way are you going?\" the driver grunted impatiently.\n\nHogey pointed down the side-road that led back into the hills. \"Marie's\npop's place. You know where? 'Bout three miles from here. Gotta walk, I\nguess.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" the driver warned. \"You sit there by the culvert till you get a\nride. Okay?\"\n\nHogey nodded forlornly.\n\n\"Now stay out of the road,\" the driver warned, then hurried back across\nthe highway. Moments later, the atomic battery-driven motors droned\nmournfully, and the bus pulled away.\n\nBig Hogey blinked after it, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Nice people,\"\nhe said. \"Nice buncha people. All hoofers.\"\n\nWith a grunt and a lurch, he got to his feet, but his legs wouldn't work\nright. With his tumbler's reflexes, he fought to right himself with\nfrantic arm motions, but gravity claimed him, and he went stumbling into\nthe ditch.\n\n\"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\" he cried.\n\nThe bottom of the ditch was wet, and he crawled up the embankment with\nmud-soaked knees, and sat on the shoulder again. The gin bottle was\nstill intact. He had himself a long fiery drink, and it warmed him deep\ndown. He blinked around at the gaunt and treeless land.\n\nThe sun was almost down, forge-red on a dusty horizon. The\nblood-streaked sky faded into sulphurous yellow toward the zenith, and\nthe very air that hung over the land seemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n\nA farm truck turned onto the side-road and moaned away, its driver\nhardly glancing at the dark young man who sat swaying on his duffle bag\nnear the culvert. Hogey scarcely noticed the vehicle. He just kept\nstaring at the crazy sun.\n\nHe shook his head. It wasn't really the sun. The sun, the real sun, was\na hateful eye-sizzling horror in the dead black pit. It painted\neverything with pure white pain, and you saw things by the reflected\npain-light. The fat red sun was strictly a phoney, and it didn't fool\nhim any. He hated it for what he knew it was behind the gory mask, and\nfor what it had done to his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a grunt, he got to his feet, managed to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of the farm road, lurching from side to\nside, and keeping his eyes on the rolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n\nHogey tried to turn around to look at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went down on the pavement. The car's tires\nscreeched on the hot asphalt. Hogey lay there for a moment, groaning.\nThat one had hurt his hip. A car door slammed and a big man with a\nflorid face got out and stalked toward him, looking angry.\n\n\"What the hell's the matter with you, fella?\" he drawled. \"You soused?\nMan, you've really got a load.\"\n\nHogey got up doggedly, shaking his head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't stand the gravity.\"\n\nThe burly farmer retrieved his gin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\" he grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n\n\"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest, I'm just space burned. You know?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway? Do you live around here?\"\n\nIt was obvious that the big man had taken him for a hobo or a tramp.\nHogey pulled himself together. \"Goin' to the Hauptman's place. Marie.\nYou know Marie?\"\n\nThe farmer's eyebrows went up. \"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know her. Only\nshe's Marie Parker now. Has been, nigh on six years. Say--\" He paused,\nthen gaped. \"You ain't her husband by any chance?\"\n\n\"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey Parker.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be--! Get in the car. I'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no shape to walk it.\"\n\nHe grinned wryly, waggled his head, and helped Hogey and his bag into\nthe back seat. A woman with a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly beside the\nfarmer in the front, and she neither greeted the passenger nor looked\naround.\n\n\"They don't make cars like this anymore,\" the farmer called over the\ngrowl of the ancient gasoline engine and the grind of gears. \"You can\nhave them new atomics with their loads of hot isotopes under the seat.\nAin't safe, I say--eh, Martha?\"\n\nThe woman with the sun-baked neck quivered her head slightly. \"A car\nlike this was good enough for Pa, an' I reckon it's good enough for us,\"\nshe drawled mournfully.\n\nFive minutes later the car drew in to the side of the road. \"Reckon you\ncan walk it from here,\" the farmer said. \"That's Hauptman's road just up\nahead.\"\n\nHe helped Hogey out of the car and drove away without looking back to\nsee if Hogey stayed on his feet. The woman with the sun-baked neck was\nsuddenly talking garrulously in his direction.\n\nIt was twilight. The sun had set, and the yellow sky was turning gray.\nHogey was too tired to go on, and his legs would no longer hold him. He\nblinked around at the land, got his eyes focused, and found what looked\nlike Hauptman's place on a distant hillside. It was a big frame house\nsurrounded by a wheatfield, and a few scrawny trees. Having located it,\nhe stretched out in the tall grass beyond the ditch to take a little\nrest.\n\nSomewhere dogs were barking, and a cricket sang creaking monotony in the\ngrass. Once there was the distant thunder of a rocket blast from the\nlaunching station six miles to the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past on the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n\nWhen he awoke, it was night, and he was shivering. His stomach was\nscreeching, and his nerves dancing with high voltages. He sat up and\ngroped for his watch, then remembered he had pawned it after the poker\ngame. Remembering the game and the results of the game made him wince\nand bite his lip and grope for the bottle again.\n\nHe sat breathing heavily for a moment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become second nature with him, but he had to think\nfor a moment because his defective vision prevented him from seeing the\nEarth-crescent.\n\nVega was almost straight above him in the late August sky, so he knew it\nwasn't much after sundown--probably about eight o'clock. He braced\nhimself with another swallow of gin, picked himself up and got back to\nthe road, feeling a little sobered after the nap.\n\nHe limped on up the pavement and turned left at the narrow drive that\nled between barbed-wire fences toward the Hauptman farmhouse, five\nhundred yards or so from the farm road. The fields on his left belonged\nto Marie's father, he knew. He was getting close--close to home and\nwoman and child.\n\nHe dropped the bag suddenly and leaned against a fence post, rolling his\nhead on his forearms and choking in spasms of air. He was shaking all\nover, and his belly writhed. He wanted to turn and run. He wanted to\ncrawl out in the grass and hide.\n\nWhat were they going to say? And Marie, Marie most of all. How was he\ngoing to tell her about the money?\n\nSix hitches in space, and every time the promise had been the same: _One\nmore tour, baby, and we'll have enough dough, and then I'll quit for\ngood. One more time, and we'll have our stake--enough to open a little\nbusiness, or buy a house with a mortgage and get a job._\n\nAnd she had waited, but the money had never been quite enough until this\ntime. This time the tour had lasted nine months, and he had signed on\nfor every run from station to moon-base to pick up the bonuses. And this\ntime he'd made it. Two weeks ago, there had been forty-eight hundred in\nthe bank. And now ...\n\n\"_Why?_\" he groaned, striking his forehead against his forearms. His arm\nslipped, and his head hit the top of the fencepost, and the pain blinded\nhim for a moment. He staggered back into the road with a low roar, wiped\nblood from his forehead, and savagely kicked his bag.\n\nIt rolled a couple of yards up the road. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished with it, he stood panting and angry, but\nfeeling better. He shouldered the bag and hiked on toward the farmhouse.\n\nThey're hoofers, that's all--just an Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A born tumbler. Know what that means? It\nmeans--God, what does it mean? It means out in Big Bottomless, where\nEarth's like a fat moon with fuzzy mold growing on it. Mold, that's all\nyou are, just mold.\n\nA dog barked, and he wondered if he had been muttering aloud. He came to\na fence-gap and paused in the darkness. The road wound around and came\nup the hill in front of the house. Maybe they were sitting on the porch.\nMaybe they'd already heard him coming. Maybe ...\n\nHe was trembling again. He fished the fifth of gin out of his coat\npocket and sloshed it. Still over half a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a bottle sticking out of his pocket. He\nstood there in the night wind, sipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The moon looked as phoney as the setting sun.\n\nHe straightened in sudden determination. It had to be sometime. Get it\nover with, get it over with now. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly behind him. He retrieved his bag, and\nwaded quietly through the tall grass until he reached the hedge which\ndivided an area of sickly peach trees from the field. He got over the\nhedge somehow, and started through the trees toward the house. He\nstumbled over some old boards, and they clattered.\n\n\"_Shhh!_\" he hissed, and moved on.\n\nThe dogs were barking angrily, and he heard a screen door slam. He\nstopped.\n\n\"Ho there!\" a male voice called experimentally from the house.\n\nOne of Marie's brothers. Hogey stood frozen in the shadow of a peach\ntree, waiting.\n\n\"Anybody out there?\" the man called again.\n\nHogey waited, then heard the man muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic 'im.\"\n\nThe hound's bark became eager. The animal came chasing down the slope,\nand stopped ten feet away to crouch and bark frantically at the shadow\nin the gloom. He knew the dog.\n\n\"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky boy--here!\"\n\nThe dog stopped barking, sniffed, trotted closer, and went \"_Rrrooff!_\"\nThen he started sniffing suspiciously again.\n\n\"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he whispered.\n\nThe dog came forward silently, sniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around Hogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The man whistled from the porch. The dog\nfroze, then trotted quickly back up the slope.\n\n\"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the man on the porch said. \"Chasin' armadillos\nagain, eh?\"\n\nThe screen door slammed again, and the porch light went out. Hogey stood\nthere staring, unable to think. Somewhere beyond the window lights\nwere--his woman, his son.\n\nWhat the hell was a tumbler doing with a woman and a son?\n\nAfter perhaps a minute, he stepped forward again. He tripped over a\nshovel, and his foot plunged into something that went _squelch_ and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle. He fell forward into a heap of sand,\nand his foot went deeper into the sloppy wetness.\n\nHe lay there with his stinging forehead on his arms, cursing softly and\ncrying. Finally he rolled over, pulled his foot out of the mess, and\ntook off his shoes. They were full of mud--sticky sandy mud.\n\nThe dark world was reeling about him, and the wind was dragging at his\nbreath. He fell back against the sand pile and let his feet sink in the\nmud hole and wriggled his toes. He was laughing soundlessly, and his\nface was wet in the wind. He couldn't think. He couldn't remember where\nhe was and why, and he stopped caring, and after a while he felt better.\n\nThe stars were swimming over him, dancing crazily, and the mud cooled\nhis feet, and the sand was soft behind him. He saw a rocket go up on a\ntail of flame from the station, and waited for the sound of its blast,\nbut he was already asleep when it came.\n\nIt was far past midnight when he became conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He pushed the animal away with a low curse\nand mopped at the side of his face. He stirred, and groaned. His feet\nwere burning up! He tried to pull them toward him, but they wouldn't\nbudge. There was something wrong with his legs.\n\nFor an instant he stared wildly around in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his eyes and shuddered. When he opened them again,\nthe moon had emerged from behind a cloud, and he could see clearly the\ncruel trap into which he had accidentally stumbled. A pile of old\nboards, a careful stack of new lumber, a pick and shovel, a sand-pile,\nheaps of fresh-turned earth, and a concrete mixer--well, it added up.\n\nHe gripped his ankles and pulled, but his feet wouldn't budge. In sudden\nterror, he tried to stand up, but his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in the sand with a low moan. He lay still\nfor several minutes, considering carefully.\n\nHe pulled at his left foot. It was locked in a vise. He tugged even more\ndesperately at his right foot. It was equally immovable.\n\nHe sat up with a whimper and clawed at the rough concrete until his\nnails tore and his fingertips bled. The surface still felt damp, but it\nhad hardened while he slept.\n\nHe sat there stunned until Hooky began licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and dug his hands into the sand-pile to stop\nthe bleeding. Hooky licked at his face, panting love.\n\n\"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n\nThe dog whined softly, trotted a short distance away, circled, and came\nback to crouch down in the sand directly before Hogey, inching forward\nexperimentally.\n\nHogey gripped fistfuls of the dry sand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the sky. They came to rest on the sliver of\nlight--the space station--rising in the west, floating out in Big\nBottomless where the gang was--Nichols and Guerrera and Lavrenti and\nFats. And he wasn't forgetting Keesey, the rookie who'd replaced him.\n\nKeesey would have a rough time for a while--rough as a cob. The pit was\nno playground. The first time you went out of the station in a suit, the\npit got you. Everything was falling, and you fell, with it. Everything.\nThe skeletons of steel, the tire-shaped station, the spheres and docks\nand nightmare shapes--all tied together by umbilical cables and flexible\ntubes. Like some crazy sea-thing they seemed, floating in a black ocean\nwith its tentacles bound together by drifting strands in the dark tide\nthat bore it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverything was pain-bright or dead black, and it wheeled around you, and\nyou went nuts trying to figure which way was down. In fact, it took you\nmonths to teach your body that _all_ ways were down and that the pit was\nbottomless.\n\nHe became conscious of a plaintive sound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n\nIt was a baby crying.\n\nIt was nearly a minute before he got the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking frantically at his encased feet and\nsobbing low in his throat. They'd hear him if he kept that up. He\nstopped and covered his ears to close out the cry of his firstborn. A\nlight went on in the house, and when it went off again, the infant's cry\nhad ceased.\n\nAnother rocket went up from the station, and he cursed it. Space was a\ndisease, and he had it.\n\n\"Help!\" he cried out suddenly. \"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n\nHe knew he was yelling hysterically at the sky and fighting the\nrelentless concrete that clutched his feet, and after a moment he\nstopped.\n\nThe light was on in the house again, and he heard faint sounds. The\nstirring-about woke the baby again, and once more the infant's wail came\non the breeze.\n\n_Make the kid shut up, make the kid shut up ..._\n\nBut that was no good. It wasn't the kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space, they said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had only himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change anything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n\nA tumbler had no business with a family, but what was a man going to do?\nTake a skinning knife, boy, and make yourself a eunuch. But that was no\ngood either. They needed bulls out there in the pit, not steers. And\nwhen a man came down from a year's hitch, what was he going to do? Live\nin a lonely shack and read books for kicks? Because you were a man, you\nsought out a woman. And because she was a woman, she got a kid, and that\nwas the end of it. It was nobody's fault, nobody's at all.\n\nHe stared at the red eye of Mars low in the southwest. They were running\nout there now, and next year he would have been on the long long run ...\n\nBut there was no use thinking about it. Next year and the years after\nbelonged to _little_ Hogey.\n\nHe sat there with his feet locked in the solid concrete of the footing,\nstaring out into Big Bottomless while his son's cry came from the house\nand the Hauptman menfolk came wading through the tall grass in search of\nsomeone who had cried out. His feet were stuck tight, and he wouldn't\never get them out. He was sobbing softly when they found him.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1955.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
