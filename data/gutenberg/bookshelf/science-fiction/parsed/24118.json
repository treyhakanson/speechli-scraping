Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n     _After all--they only borrowed it a little while, just to fix it--_\n\n\nI mean, it isn't like we swiped anything. We maybe borrowed a couple of\nthings, like. But, gee, we put everything back like we found it, pretty\nnear.\n\nEven like the compressor we got from Stinky Brinker that his old man\nwasn't using and I traded my outboard motor for, my old m ... my father\nmade me trade back. But it was like Skinny said ... You know, Skinny.\nSkinny Thompson. He's the one you guys keep calling the boy genius, but\nshucks, he's no ...\n\nWell, yeah, it's like Skinny said, we didn't need an outboard motor, and\nwe did need a compressor. You've got to have a compressor on a\nspaceship, everybody knows that. And that old compression chamber that\nold man ... I mean _Mr._ Fields let us use didn't have a compressor.\n\nSure he said we could use it. Anyway he said we could play with it, and\nSkinny said we were going to make a spaceship out of it, and he said go\nahead.\n\nWell, no, he didn't say it exactly like that. I mean, well, like he\ndidn't take it serious, sort of.\n\nAnyway, it made a swell spaceship. It had four portholes on it and an\nair lock and real bunks in it and lots of room for all that stuff that\nSkinny put in there. But it didn't have a compressor and that's why ...\n\nWhat stuff? Oh, you know, the stuff that Skinny put in there. Like the\nradar he made out of a TV set and the antigravity and the atomic power\nplant he invented to run it all with.\n\nHe's awful smart, Skinny is, but he's not like what you think of a\ngenius. You know, he's not all the time using big words, and he doesn't\nlook like a genius. I mean, we call him Skinny 'cause he used to\nbe--Skinny.\n\nBut he isn't now, I mean he's maybe small for his age, anyway he's\nsmaller than me, and I'm the same age as he is. 'Course, I'm big for my\nage, so that doesn't mean much, does it?\n\nWell, I guess Stinker Brinker started it. He's always riding Skinny\nabout one thing or another, but Skinny never gets mad and it's a good\nthing for Stinker, too. I saw Skinny clean up on a bunch of ninth\ngraders ... Well, a couple of them anyway. They were saying ... Well, I\nguess I won't tell you what they were saying. Anyway, Skinny used judo,\nI guess, because there wasn't much of a fight.\n\nAnyway, Stinker said something about how he was going to be a rocket\npilot when he grew up, and I told him that Skinny had told me that there\nwouldn't be any rockets, and that antigravity would be the thing as soon\nas it was invented. So Stinker said it never would be invented, and I\nsaid it would so, and he said it would not, and I said ...\n\nWell, if you're going to keep interrupting me, how can I ...\n\nAll right. Anyway, Skinny broke into the argument and said that he could\nprove mathematically that antigravity was possible, and Stinky said\nsuure he could, and Skinny said sure he could, and Stinky said suuure he\ncould, like that. Honestly, is that any way to argue? I mean it sounds\nlike two people agreeing, only Stinky keeps going suuure, like that, you\nknow? And Stinky, what does he know about mathematics? He's had to take\nRemedial Arithmetic ever since ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo, I don't understand how the antigravity works. Skinny told me, but it\nwas something about meson flow and stuff like that that I didn't\nunderstand. The atomic power plant made more sense.\n\nWhere did we get what uranium? Gee, no, we couldn't afford uranium, so\nSkinny invented a hydrogen fusion plant. Anyone can make hydrogen. You\njust take zinc and sulfuric acid and ...\n\nDeuterium? You mean like heavy hydrogen? No, Skinny said it would\nprobably work better, but like I said, we couldn't afford anything\nfancy. As it was, Skinny had to pay five or six dollars for that special\nsquare tubing in the antigravity, and the plastic space helmets we had\ncost us ninety-eight cents each. And it cost a dollar and a half for\nthe special tube that Skinny needed to make the TV set into a radar.\n\nYou see, we didn't steal anything, really. It was mostly stuff that was\njust lying around. Like the TV set was up in my attic, and the old\nrefrigerator that Skinny used the parts to make the atomic power plant\nout of from. And then, a lot of the stuff we already had. Like the skin\ndiving suits we made into spacesuits and the vacuum pump that Skinny had\nalready and the generator.\n\nSure, we did a lot of skin diving, but that was last summer. That's how\nwe knew about old man Brinker's compressor that Stinky said was his and\nI traded my outboard motor for and had to trade back. And that's how we\nknew about Mr. Fields' old compression chamber, and all like that.\n\nThe rocket? Well, it works on the same principle as the atomic power\nplant, only it doesn't work except in a vacuum, hardly. Course you don't\nneed much of a rocket when you have antigravity. Everyone knows that.\n\nWell, anyway, that's how we built the spaceship, and believe me, it\nwasn't easy. I mean with Stinky all the time bothering us and laughing\nat us. And I had to do a lot of lawn mowing to get money for the square\ntubing for the antigravity and the special tube for the radar, and my\nspace helmet.\n\nStinky called the space helmets kid stuff. He was always saying things\nlike say hello to the folks on Mars for me, and bring back a bottle of\ncanal number five, and all like that, you know. Course, they did look\nlike kid stuff, I guess. We bought them at the five-and-dime, and they\nwere meant for kids. Of course when Skinny got through with them, they\nworked fine.\n\nWe tested them in the air lock of the compression chamber when we got\nthe compressor in. They tested out pretty good for a half-hour, then we\ntried them on in there. Well, it wasn't a complete vacuum, just\ntwenty-seven inches of mercury, but that was O.K. for a test.\n\nSo anyway, we got ready to take off. Stinky was there to watch, of\ncourse. He was saying things like, farewell, O brave pioneers, and stuff\nlike that. I mean it was enough to make you sick.\n\nHe was standing there laughing and singing something like up in the air\njunior birdmen, but when we closed the air-lock door, we couldn't hear\nhim. Skinny started up the atomic power plant, and we could see Stinky\nlaughing fit to kill. It takes a couple of minutes for it to warm up,\nyou know. So Stinky started throwing rocks to attract our attention, and\nSkinny was scared that he'd crack a porthole or something, so he threw\nthe switch and we took off.\n\nBoy, you should of seen Stinky's face. I mean you really should of seen\nit. One minute he was laughing you know, and the next minute he looked\nlike a goldfish. I guess he always did look like a goldfish, but I mean\neven more like, then. And he was getting smaller and smaller, because we\nhad taken off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were gone pretty near six hours, and it's a good thing my Mom made me\ntake a lunch. Sure, I told her where we were going. Well ... anyway I\ntold her we were maybe going to fly around the world in Skinny and my\nspaceship, or maybe go down to Carson's pond. And she made me take a\nlunch and made me promise I wouldn't go swimming alone, and I sure\ndidn't.\n\nBut we did go around the world three or four times. I lost count. Anyway\nthat's when we saw the satellite--on radar. So Skinny pulled the\nspaceship over to it and we got out and looked at it. The spacesuits\nworked fine, too.\n\nGosh no, we didn't steal it or anything. Like Skinny said, it was just a\nmenace to navigation, and the batteries were dead, and it wasn't working\nright anyway. So we tied it onto the spaceship and took it home. No, we\nhad to tie it on top, it was too big to take inside with the antennas\nsticking out. Course, we found out how to fold them later.\n\nWell, anyway the next day, the Russians started squawking about a\ncapitalist plot, and someone had swiped their satellite. Gee, I mean\nwith all the satellites up there, who'd miss just one?\n\nSo I got worried that they'd find out that we took it. Course, I didn't\nneed to worry, because Stinky told them all right, just like a\ntattletale.\n\nSo anyway, after Skinny got the batteries recharged, we put it back. And\nthen when we landed there were hundreds of people standing around, and\nMr. Anderson from the State Department. I guess you know the rest.\n\nExcept maybe Mr. Anderson started laughing when we told him, and he said\nit was the best joke on the Russians he ever heard.\n\nI guess it is when you think about it. I mean, the Russians complaining\nabout somebody swiping their satellite and then the State Department\nanswering a couple of kids borrowed it, but they put it back.\n\nOne thing that bothers me though, we didn't put it back exactly the way\nwe found it. But I guess it doesn't matter. You see, when we put it\nback, we goofed a little. I mean, we put it back in the same orbit, more\nor less, but we got it going in the wrong direction.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of We Didn't Do Anything Wrong, Hardly, by \nRoger Kuykendall\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24118.txt or 24118.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/1/1/24118/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
