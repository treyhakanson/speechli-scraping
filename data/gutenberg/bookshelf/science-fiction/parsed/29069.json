S. P. Meek\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n[Sidenote: Again Dr. Bird closes with the evil Saranoff--this time\nnear the Aberdeen Proving Ground, in a deadly, mysterious blanket of\nfog.]\n\n\nA telephone bell jangled insistently. The orderly on duty dropped his\nfeet from the desk to the floor and lifted the receiver with a\nmuttered curse.\n\n\"Post hospital, Aberdeen Proving Ground,\" he said sleepily, rubbing\nhis eyes.\n\nA burst of raucous coughing answered him. Several times it ceased for\nan instant and a voice tried to speak, but each time a fresh spasm of\ndeep-chested wracking coughing interrupted.\n\n\"Who is this?\" demanded the now aroused orderly. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nBetween intervals of coughing difficultly enunciated words reached\nhim.\n\n\"This is--_uch! uch!_--Lieutenant Burroughs at\nthe--_uch!_--Michaelville range. We have been--_uch!_--caught in a\ncloud of poison--_uch!_ _uch!_--gas. Send an ambulance and\na--_uch!_--surgeon at once. Better bring--_uch!_--gas masks.\"\n\n\"At the Michaelville range, sir? How many men are down there?\"\n\n\"_Uch! uch! uch!_--five--all help--_uch! uch!_--helpless. Hurry!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'll start two ambulances down at once, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't forget the--_uch! uch!_--gas--_uch!_--masks.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I'll send them, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later two ambulances rolled out of the garage and took\nthe four-mile winding ribbon of concrete which separated the\nMichaelville water impact range from the main front of the Aberdeen\nProving Ground. On each ambulance was a hastily awakened and partially\nclothed medical officer. For three miles they tore along the curving\nroad at high speed. Without warning the leading machine slowed down.\nThe driver of the second ambulance shoved home his brake just in time\nto keep from ramming the leading vehicle.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he shouted.\n\nAs he spoke he gave a muttered curse and switched on his amber\nfog-light. From the marshes on either side of the road a deep blanket\nof fog rolled up and enveloped the vehicle, almost shutting off the\nroad from sight. The forward ambulance began to grope its way slowly\nforward. The senior medical officer sniffed the fog critically and\nshouted to his driver.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried. \"There's something funny about this fog. Every one\nput on gas masks.\"\n\nHe coughed slightly as he adjusted his mask. His orders were shouted\nto the ambulance in the rear but before the masks could be adjusted,\nevery member of the crew was vying with the rest in the frequency and\nviolence of the coughs which he could emit. The masks did not seem to\nshut out the poisonous fog which crept in between the masks and the\nmen's faces and seemed to take bodily possession of their lungs.\n\n\"I don't believe we'll ever make the last mile to Michaelville through\nthis, Major,\" cried the driver between intervals of coughing. \"Hadn't\nwe better turn back while we can?\"\n\n\"Drive on!\" cried the medical officer. \"We'll keep going as long as we\ncan. Imagine what those poor devils on the range are going through\nwithout masks of any sort.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn through the rapidly thickening fog, the two ambulances groped their\nway. The road seemed interminable, but at length the flood lights of\nthe Michaelville end of the range came dimly into view. As the\nvehicles stopped the two surgeons jumped to the ground and groped\ntheir way forward, stretcher bearers following them closely. Presently\nMajor Martin stumbled over a body which lay at full length on the\nconcrete runway between the two main buildings. He stooped and\nexamined the man with the aid of a pocket flashlight.\n\n\"He's alive,\" he announced in muffled tones through his mask. \"Take\nhim to the ambulance and fit a mask on him.\"\n\nThree more unconscious men were carried to the ambulances before the\nprone form of Lieutenant Burroughs was found by the searchers. The\nlieutenant lay on his back not far from the telephone and directly\nunder the glare of a huge arc-light. His eyes were open and he was\nconscious, but when he tried to speak, only a murmur came from his\nlips. There was a rattle in his chest and faint coughs tried in vain\nto force their way out between his stiffened lips.\n\n\"Easy, Lieutenant,\" said Major Martin as he bent over him; \"don't try\nto talk just now. You're all right and we'll have a mask on you in a\njiffy. That damned gas isn't as thick right here as it is down the\nroad a way.\"\n\nTwo medical corps men lifted the lieutenant onto a stretcher and\nstarted to fit a mask over his face. He feebly raised a hand to stop\nthem. His lips formed words which he could not enunciate, but Major\nMartin understood them.\n\n\"Your men?\" he said between intervals of coughing. \"We've got them all\nin the ambulance, I think. There were four besides yourself, weren't\nthere?\"\n\nThe lieutenant nodded.\n\n\"Right. We have them all. Now we'll take you back to the hospital and\nhave you fixed up in a jiffy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe entire rescue crew were coughing violently as the ambulances left\nMichaelville. For a mile they drove through fog that was thicker than\nhad been seen in Maryland for years. They reached the point where they\nhad encountered the congealed moisture on the way out, but now there\nwas no diminution of its density. The main post was less than two\nmiles away when they burst out into a clear night and increased their\nspeed.\n\nAs the two machines drew up in front of the post hospital, the driver\nof the leading ambulance swayed in his seat. Blindly he pulled on his\nemergency brake and then slumped forward in his seat, his breath\ncoming in wheezing gasps. Major Martin hastily tore the mask from his\nface and glanced at it.\n\n\"Take him in with the rest!\" he cried. \"His mask must have leaked.\"\n\nAs they entered the hospital, a sickening weakness overcame Major\nMartin. From all sides a black pall seemed to roll in on him and bits\nof ice seemed to form in his brain. He reeled and caught at the\nshoulder of a corps man who was passing. The orderly caught at him and\nlooked for a moment at his livid face.\n\n\"Sergeant Connors!\" he cried.\n\nA technical sergeant hastened up. Major Martin forced words with\ndifficulty through stiffening lips.\n\n\"Call Captain Murdock,\" he wheezed, \"and have him get Captain\nWilliams. I'm down and probably Dr. Briscoe will be down in a few\nminutes. Telephone the commanding officer and tell him to quarantine\nthe whole proving ground. Have the telephone orderly wake everyone on\nthe post and order them to close all windows in all buildings and not\nto venture outside until they get fresh orders. This seems to be the\nsame stuff they had in Belgium last December.\"\n\nAs the last words came from his lips he slowly stiffened and slumped\ntoward the ground. The sergeant and the orderly picked him up and\ncarried him to a bed in the emergency ward. The orderly hurried away\nto close all of the hospital windows while Sergeant Connors took down\nthe receiver of the telephone and began to carry out the Major's\norders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird glanced at the news-paper clipping which Operative Carnes of\nthe United States Secret Service laid on his desk. Into his eyes came\na curious glitter, sure evidence that the famous scientist's interest\nwas aroused.\n\n\"Last December when we discussed this matter, Doctor,\" said the\ndetective, \"you gave it as your opinion that Ivan Saranoff was at the\nbottom of it and that the same plague which devastated the Meuse\nValley in Belgium would eventually make an appearance in the United\nStates. You were right.\"\n\nDr. Bird bounded to his feet.\n\n\"Is Saranoff back on this side of the Atlantic?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Officially, he is not. Every customs inspector and immigration\nofficer has his photograph and no report of his arrest has come in,\nbut we know Saranoff well enough to discount negative evidence where\nhe is concerned. Whether he is here or not, the plague is.\"\n\n\"When did it appear?\"\n\n\"Last night at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It has killed\neight or ten and twice as many more are sick. The place is quarantined\nand a rigid censorship has been placed over the telephones, but it is\nonly a matter of time before some press man will get the story. I have\na car waiting below and a pass signed by the Secretary of War. Grab\nwhat apparatus you need and we'll start.\"\n\nDr. Bird pressed a button on his desk. A tall, willowy girl entered,\nnotebook in hand. Carnes glanced with keen appreciation at her slim\nbeauty.\n\n\"Miss Andrews,\" said the doctor, \"in five minutes Mr. Carnes and I\nwill leave here for Aberdeen Proving Ground in the Government car\nwhich is waiting below. You will see that Mr. Davis is in that car and\nthat traveling laboratory 'Q' is ready to follow us.\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor.\"\n\n\"You remember that mysterious plague in Belgium last December, do you\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I was unable to get over to Belgium, but an army surgeon and two\nPublic Health Service men went over. You will get copies of all\nreports they made, including especially any reports of autopsies on\nbodies of victims. I want all data on file in the Public Health\nService or the War Department. You will then obtain a car and follow\nus to Aberdeen. Arrangements will be made for your admittance to the\nproving ground. The Belgian plague has made its appearance in the\nUnited States.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwiftly the expression of the girl's face changed. Her dark eyes\nglowed with an internal fire and the immobility of her face vanished\nas if by magic to be replaced by an expression of fierce hatred. Her\nlips drew back, exposing her strong white teeth and she literally spat\nout her words.\n\n\"That swine, Saranoff!\" she hissed.\n\nCarnes sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Why, it's Feodrovna Androvitch!\" he cried in astonishment.\n\nIn an instant the rage faded from her face and the calm, immobility\nwhich had marked it reappeared. Through the silence Dr. Bird's voice\ncut like a whip.\n\n\"Miss Andrews,\" he said sternly, \"I thought that I had impressed on\nyou the fact that even a momentary lapse from the character which you\nhave assumed may easily be fatal to both of us. Unless you can learn\nto control your emotions, your usefulness to me is at an end.\"\n\nAlthough Carnes watched closely he could not detect the slightest\nchange of expression in the girl's face as the doctor spoke.\n\n\"I am very sorry, Doctor,\" she said evenly. \"We were alone and I\nallowed the mask to slip for an instant. It will not happen again.\"\n\n\"It _must_ not,\" said the doctor curtly. \"Carry out your\ninstructions.\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor.\"\n\nShe turned on her heel and left the office. Carnes looked quickly at\nDr. Bird.\n\n\"Surely that is Feodrovna Androvitch, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"It was. It is now Thelma Andrews, my secretary. She changed her name\nwith her appearance and politics. I have been training her since last\nAugust. This is her first official appearance, so to speak.\"\n\n\"In view of her past associations, is it safe to trust her?\"\n\n\"If I didn't think so, I wouldn't use her. She has ample reason to\nhate Ivan Saranoff and she knows how much mercy she has to hope for\nfrom him if he ever gets her in his clutches. We can't play a lone\nhand against Saranoff forever and I know of no better place to recruit\nan organization than the enemy's camp. Thelma saved our lives in\nRussia, you may remember.\"\n\n\"But even when she was rescuing us from the clutches of Saranoff's\ngang, she was an ardent communist, if I remember correctly.\"\n\n\"Theoretically I believe she still favors the world revolution, but\nshe hates Saranoff even more than she does the bourgeoisie and I\nbelieve she had come to be willing to accept capitalistic institutions\nfor the present, at least as far as this country is concerned. At any\nrate, I trust her. If you have any doubts, you can have her watched\nfor a while.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes thought for a moment and then picked up the telephone.\n\n\"I have plenty of confidence in your judgment, Doctor,\" he said\napologetically, \"but if you don't mind, I'll have Haggerty trail her\nfor a few days. It won't do any harm.\"\n\n\"Very well; and if any of the Young Labor gang should penetrate her\ndisguise, he'd be a mighty efficient bodyguard. Do as you see fit.\"\n\nCarnes called the number of the secret service and conferred for a few\nmoments with Bolton, the chief of the bureau. He turned to Dr. Bird\nwith a smile of satisfaction.\n\n\"Haggerty will be on the job in a few minutes, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Good enough. The five minutes I allowed are up. Let's see how well\nshe has performed her first task.\"\n\nAs they emerged from the Bureau of Standards, Carnes glanced rapidly\naround. In the front seat of the secret service car which he had left\nsat a young man whom the detective recognized as one of Dr. Bird's\nassistants. Behind the car stood a small delivery truck with two of\nthe Bureau mechanics on the seat.\n\nDr. Bird nodded to the mechanics and followed Carnes into the big\nsedan. With a motorcycle policeman clearing a way for them, they\nroared across Washington and north along the Baltimore pike. Two hours\nand a half of driving brought them to Aberdeen and they turned down\nthe concrete road leading to the proving ground. Two miles from the\ntown a huge chain was stretched across the road with armed guards\npatrolling behind it. The car stopped and an officer stepped forward\nand examined the pass which Carnes presented.\n\n\"You are to go direct to headquarters, gentlemen,\" he said. \"Colonel\nWesley is waiting for you.\"\n\nThe commanding officer rose to his feet as Carnes and Dr. Bird entered\nhis office.\n\n\"I am at your service, Dr. Bird,\" he said formally. \"The Chief of\nOrdnance has given instructions which, as I understand them, put you\nvirtually in command of this post.\" There was resentment in the\ncolonel's tone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird smiled affably and extended his hand. The old colonel\nstruggled with his chagrin for a moment, but few men could resist Dr.\nBird when he deliberately tried to charm them. Colonel Wesley grasped\nthe proffered hand.\n\n\"What I want most, Colonel, is your cooperation,\" said the doctor\nsuavely. \"I am not competent to assume command here even if I wished\nto. I would like to ask a few favors but if they should prove to be\ncontrary to your established policies, I will gladly withdraw my\nrequest.\"\n\nColonel Wesley's face cleared as if by magic.\n\n\"You have only to ask for anything we have, Doctor,\" he said\nearnestly, \"and it is yours. Frankly, we are at our wit's end.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I have a truck with some apparatus and three men outside.\nWill you have them guided to your laboratory and given what aid they\nneed in setting their stuff up?\"\n\n\"Gladly.\"\n\n\"My secretary, Miss Andrews, will arrive from Washington later in the\nday with some information. I would like to have her passed through the\nguards and brought directly to me wherever I am. You have the place\nwell guarded, have you not?\"\n\n\"As well as I can with my small force. All roads are patrolled by\nmotorcycles; four launches are on the waterfront, and there are seven\nplanes aloft.\"\n\n\"That is splendid. Now can you tell me just what happened last night?\"\n\n\"Captain Murdock, the acting surgeon, can do that better than I can,\nDoctor. He is at the hospital but I'll have him up here in a few\nminutes.\"\n\n\"With your permission, we'll go to the hospital and talk to him there.\nI want to examine the patients in any event.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Doctor. I will remain at my office until I am sure that I\ncan give you no further assistance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a word of thanks, Dr. Bird left, and, accompanied by Carnes, made\nhis way to the hospital. Captain Murdock was frankly relieved to greet\nthe famous Bureau of Standards scientist and readily gave him the\ninformation he desired.\n\n\"The first intimation we had of trouble was when Lieutenant Burroughs\ntelephoned from the water impact range where they were doing night\nfiring last night at about four A.M. Two ambulances went down and\nbrought him and his four men back, all of them stricken with what I\ntake to be an extremely rapidly developing form of lobar pneumonia.\nAll of the men who went down were stricken with the same disease, two\nof them as soon as they got back. So far we have had eight deaths\namong these men and all of the rest, except Lieutenant Burroughs, are\napt to go at any moment.\n\n\"The trouble seemed to come from a cloud of some dense heavy gas which\nrolled in from the marsh. On the advice of Major Martin, every door\nand window in the post was kept closed until morning. The gas never\nreached the upper part of the post but it reached the stables. Eleven\nhorses and mules are dead and all of the rest are stricken. The stable\ndetachment either failed to close their barracks tightly or else the\ngas went in through cracks for seven out of the nine are here in the\nhospital, although none of them are very seriously ill. As soon as the\nsun came up, the gas seemed to disappear.\"\n\n\"Let me see the men who are sick.\"\n\nCaptain Murdock led the way into the ward. Dr. Bird went from man to\nman, examining charts and asking questions of the nurses and medical\ncorps men on duty. When he had gone the rounds of the ward he entered\nthe morgue and carefully examined the bodies of the men who lay there.\n\n\"Have you performed any autopsies?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Have you the authority?\"\n\n\"On the approval of the commanding officer.\"\n\n\"Please secure that approval at once. Have all lights taken out of the\noperating room and the windows shaded. I want to work under red light.\nWe must examine the lungs of these men at once. With all due respect\nto your medical knowledge, Captain, I am not convinced that these men\ndied of pneumonia.\"\n\n\"Neither am I, Doctor, but that is the best guess I could make. I'll\nhave things fixed up for you right away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird stepped to the telephone and called the laboratory. When, in\nhalf an hour, Captain Murdock announced that he was ready to proceed,\nDavis had arrived with an ultra-microscope and other apparatus which\nthe doctor had telephoned for.\n\n\"Did you arrange about the horses, Davis?\" asked Dr. Bird.\n\n\"Yes, sir. They will be up here as soon as the trucks can bring them.\"\n\n\"Good enough. We'll start operating.\"\n\nAn hour later, Dr. Bird straightened up and faced the puzzled medical\nofficer.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said, \"your diagnosis is faulty. With one possible\nexception, the lungs of these men are free from pneumonicocci. On the\nother hand there is a peculiar aspect of the tissues as though a very\npowerful antiseptic solution had been applied to them.\"\n\n\"Hardly an antiseptic, Doctor; wouldn't you say, rather, a cauterizing\nagent.\"\n\nDr. Bird bent again over the ultra-microscope.\n\n\"Are you familiar with the work done by Bancroft and Richter at\nCornell University last November and December?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I can't say that I am.\"\n\n\"They were working under a Heckscher Foundation grant studying just\nhow antiseptic solutions destroy bacteria. It has always been held\nthat some chemical change went on, but this theory they disproved. It\nis a process of absorption. If enough of the chemical adheres to the\nliving bacterium, the living protoplasm thickens and irreversibly\ncoagulates. It resembles a boiling without heat. I have seen some of\ntheir slides and the appearance is exactly what I see in this tissue.\"\n\nCaptain Murdock bent over the microscope with a new respect for Dr.\nBird in his face.\n\n\"I agree with you, Doctor,\" he said. \"This tissue certainly looks as\nthough it had been boiled. It is certainly coagulated, as I can\nplainly see now that you point it out to me. You believe, then, that\nit is a simple case of gassing?\"\n\n\"If so, it was done by no known gas. I have studied at Edgewood\nArsenal, and I am familiar with all of the work done by the Chemical\nWarfare Service in gases. No known gas will produce exactly this\nappearance. It is something new. Carnes, have those horses been\nbrought up yet?\"\n\n\"I'll see, Doctor.\"\n\n\"If they are, bring one here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a few moments the body of a dead horse was dragged into the\noperating room and Dr. Bird attacked it with a rib saw. He soon laid\nthe lungs open and dragged them from the body. He cut down the middle\nof one of the organs and shaved off a thin slice which he placed under\nthe lens of a powerful binocular microscope.\n\n\"Hello, what the dickens is this?\" he exclaimed.\n\nWith a scalpel and a delicate pair of tweezers he carefully separated\nfrom the lung tissue a tiny speck of crystalline substance which\nglittered under the red light in the operating room. He carefully\ntransferred it to a glass slide and put it under a microscope with a\nhigher magnification.\n\n\"Rhombohedral regular,\" he mused as he examined it. \"Colorless,\nfriable, and cleaving in irregular planes. What in thunder can it be?\nHave you ever seen anything like this in a lung, Murdock?\"\n\nThe medical officer bent over the microscope for a long time before he\nshook his head with a puzzled air.\n\n\"I never have,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Then that's probably what we're looking for. Start slicing every lung\nin this place and look for those crystals. Save them and put them in\nthis watch glass. If we can get enough of them, we may be able to\nlearn something. Carnes, get the rest of those horses in here and open\nthem up.\"\n\nTwo hours of careful work netted them a tiny pile of the peculiar\ncrystals. Some had come from the lungs of the dead animals and some\nfew from the lungs of the dead soldiers. Dr. Bird placed the crystals\nin a glass bottle which he covered with layer after layer of black\npaper.\n\n\"Get me more of those crystals if you can find them, Captain\nMurdock,\" he said, \"and in any case, leave the bodies here for\nfurther study. Davis and I will go to the laboratory and try to find\nout what they are. Carnes, hasn't Miss Andrews showed up yet?\"\n\n\"No, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Locate her on the telephone if you can and tell her not to bother\nabout anything except the autopsy reports and to get them here as\nquickly as possible. Let me know when you have that done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a dark room of the photographic laboratory, Dr. Bird removed the\nblack wrappings from the bottle. He dropped a few of the crystals in a\ntest tube and added distilled water. The water assumed a pink tinge as\nthe blood with which the crystals were covered dissolved, but the\ncrystals themselves did not change. They rose and floated on the\nsurface of the water.\n\n\"Insoluble in water, Davis,\" commented the doctor. \"Better wash the\nlot and then we'll get after the ultimate analysis. Whether we'll be\nable to make a proximate is doubtful in view of the small amount of\nsample we have. It's dollars to doughnuts that it's some carbon\ncompound.\"\n\nHe heated a few of the washed crystals in a watch glass. Suddenly\nthere was a sharp crack and the material disappeared. Dr. Bird thrust\nhis nose toward the glass and sniffed carefully.\n\n\"The dickens!\" he muttered. \"Davis, have I got a cold or do you smell\ngarlic?\"\n\n\"Faintly, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I have a hunch. Fill a gasometer with purified argon and we'll\nintroduce a few of these crystals and explode them. If I'm right--\"\n\nHalf an hour later he straightened up and examined the tube of the gas\nanalysis apparatus with which he was working. The level of the gas\nshowed it to be of the original volume but the liquid under the argon\nwas stained a light brown.\n\n\"It's impossible, Davis,\" cried the doctor, \"but nevertheless, it's\ntrue. Expose some of those crystals to strong sunlight and see what\nhappens.\"\n\nThe crystals rapidly disappeared as the light from a sun-ray arc fell\non them.\n\n\"It's true, Davis,\" cried the doctor, positive awe in his voice. \"Keep\nthis strictly under your hat for the present. Now that you know what\nwe're up against, fix up a couple of masks and air-collecting\napparatus. That stuff will show up again in the swamp to-night and I\nam going down there to collect some samples. I'll telephone the\nhospital now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Dr. Bird emerged from the dark room, Carnes hurried up with a\nworried expression.\n\n\"The devil's to pay, Doctor,\" was his greeting.\n\n\"All right, stall him off for a minute while I telephone the hospital.\nI think I can save some of those poor fellows up there.\"\n\nCarnes paced the floor in anxiety while Dr. Bird got Captain Murdock\non the telephone.\n\n\"Bird talking, Murdock,\" he said crisply. \"How much deep therapy X-ray\napparatus have you got up there?... Too bad.... Well, at least you can\ngive every patient a four-minute dose of maximum intensity and repeat\nin an hour or so. Keep them under sun-ray arcs as much as you can. Be\nready for a fresh attack of the same epidemic to-night. As fast as the\npatients come in, give them a five-minute dose of X-rays and then\nsun-rays. Do you understand?... All right, then.\"\n\n\"Just a moment more, Carnes,\" he went on as he called the office of\nthe commanding officer. \"Colonel Wesley, this is Dr. Bird. I think\nthat I have some light on your problem. You must anticipate another\nmore virulent attack than you had last night, probably as soon as the\nsun goes down. Will you arrange to have everyone removed from the\nswamp area before that time? Never mind trying to guard the place;\nyou'll just lose more lives if you do. Warn everyone to keep inside\nthe buildings with all doors and windows closed tight. Get all the\nwomen and children and everyone else who isn't needed here off the\npost before dark. Send them to Aberdeen or Baltimore or anywhere....\nNo, sir, the sick had better not be moved. I think they will be safer\nin the hospital than they would be elsewhere.... Yes, sir, that's all.\nThank you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird turned to the waiting Carnes.\n\n\"Did you locate Miss Andrews?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't and that is what I want to talk to you about. I just\nstarted to telephone when a hurry call came through from Washington\nfor me and I took it. It was Haggerty on the wire. He followed your\nprecious secretary from the Bureau of Standards over to the Public\nHealth Office and waited for her to come out. She stayed in the\nbuilding for about an hour and brought a bundle of papers with her\nwhen she returned. She walked toward the State, War and Navy Building\nand Haggerty followed.\n\n\"On Pennsylvania Avenue, she was stopped by two men whom Haggerty\ndescribes as dark, swarthy, bearded Europeans of some sort. He tried\nto overhear their conversation but it was in a language which he did\nnot recognize. He got only one word. The girl called one of them\n'Denberg.'\"\n\n\"Denberg!\" cried the doctor, \"Why, he's one of the Young Labor crowd,\nbut he's in Atlanta.\"\n\n\"He was, Doctor, but I telephoned Atlanta, and found that he had been\nreleased last month. After several minutes of talk the two men and\nyour secretary went off together in perfect amity with Haggerty\nfollowing. The trio got into a waiting car and Haggerty trailed them\nin a taxi. They drove around town rather aimlessly for some time and\nthen left the car and walked. Haggerty was afraid he would lose them\nin the crowd so he closed in on them. He doesn't know what happened\nexcept that he felt a sudden stab in his arm and everything went\nblack. He recovered in the police station twenty minutes later but the\nbirds had flown.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Dr. Bird, consternation in his voice. \"Of course,\nit's easy to see what happened. They spotted him and a confederate\nslipped a hypo into his arm. What worries me is the fact that they've\ngot Thelma.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hope they kill her,\" snapped Carnes vindictively. \"She was never\nkidnapped in broad daylight. Haggerty says she went with them quite\nwillingly and talked and laughed with them. She has deserted, if she\nwasn't simply acting as a spy from the first. I didn't trust her at\nall.\"\n\n\"I hate to admit that my judgment is that rotten, Carnes, but the\nevidence certainly points that way. At that, I think I'll reserve\nfinal judgment until later. Now, in view of what you have learned, I\nhave a job for you.\"\n\n\"It's about time, Doctor. I have been rather useless with all the\nhigh-powered science that has been flying around here.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll be in your element now. We know that Denberg is loose\nand their capture of Thelma is no coincidence. I was pretty sure that\nSaranoff and his gang were at the bottom of this; now I am certain.\nThey must have introduced something onto the marshes last night which\ncaused the trouble. They could not have come overland very well, for\nthe place is too well patrolled. Had they come by air, they would have\nattracted attention, even had they used a Bird silencer on their\nmotor, for they couldn't muffle their propeller, especially on a\ntakeoff, and there are plenty of men here who would have recognized\nit. You might check up on that, but I am confident that they came by\nwater. Launches and boats are continually passing up and down the\nChesapeake and its tributaries and one more could easily have escaped\nnotice. The Bush River is at the far end of the Michaelville range and\nit is navigable for craft of light draft at high tide. Find out\nwhether any strange craft were seen in the vicinity of the proving\nground last night. If you draw a blank, go to Perryville and Havre de\nGrace and see what you can find out there. I have a hunch that their\nbase is more likely to be up the Susquehanna than down toward the\ncoast. Above all, Carnes, don't approach the proving ground by water\nto-night and don't get near the mouth of the Bush River.\"\n\n\"All right, Doctor. What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm going down on the swamp and collect samples. Oh, don't look so\nworried. I know just what I am up against and I will have adequate\nprotection. I'll be in no danger and you would just be in the way.\nToddle along, old dear, and report to me by telephone as soon as you\nhave learned anything.\"\n\n\"As you say, Doctor. You'll hear from me the minute I do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Carnes had left, Dr. Bird climbed into the waiting car and was\ndriven back to the hospital. Captain Murdock greeted him with a\nsmiling face.\n\n\"I don't know how you got on to that treatment, Dr. Bird,\" he said,\n\"but it is doing the men good. The worst cases haven't been affected\nmuch, one way or the other, but the progress of the malady in the mild\ncases from the stables has been completely checked. I think they have\na chance now.\"\n\n\"They'll be all right if the destruction and coagulation of tissue\nhadn't progressed too far before you checked it, Captain. Treat them\nnow for simple lung cauterization and they ought to get well.\"\n\n\"I have some more of those crystals dissected out, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Keep them in the dark until Mr. Davis comes after them. I want to\ntake a few of them back to Washington for study.\"\n\n\"You expect another attack to-night, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, sometime after sundown.\"\n\n\"What, in heaven's name, is it?\"\n\n\"Heaven has nothing to do with it, Captain; the stuff comes from the\ndevil's regions and it is the product of a Russian chemist, who I\nsometimes believe is verily the devil himself. How it's done and what\nit is, I haven't found out yet, but I am going to investigate a little\nto-night. The effect is what you have seen. Are you familiar with the\nvarious forms of oxygen?\"\n\n\"The forms of oxygen? Why, there is only one, oxygen gas. Wait a\nminute though, there is another form, ozone. Are there any more?\"\n\n\"None that have been previously listed and studied, but at least one\nother form exists. Those crystals are pure oxygen.\"\n\n\"Impossible! Oxygen is a gas at all ordinary temperatures.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, a gas, but one whose density varies. Oxygen, to which we\nchemists assign the formula O_{2}, meaning that its molecule consists\nof two atoms of oxygen, has a weight of 32 grams per gram molecule.\nOzone, to which we assign the formula O_{3}, meaning that its molecule\ncontains three atoms of oxygen, weighs fifty per cent more or 48 grams\nper gram molecule. This new form has a density less than water, but\ntremendously greater than any known gas. I have not yet been able to\ndetermine its structure, so I will have to assign to it the formula,\nO_{x}, meaning an indefinite number of atoms per molecule. The only\nname which suggests itself is oxyzone, a combination of oxygen and\nozone.\n\n\"The stuff is a polymerization, or condensation, to speak roughly, of\nthe oxygen of the air. The oxygen takes this form which the lungs\ncannot assimilate except with great difficulty and with great damage\nto the tissues. The oxyzone will break down rapidly under the\ninfluence of sunlight or of any ray whose wave-length is shorter than\nindigo. As a result, it disappears as soon as the sun is up and it\nwill reappear after dark. That is why I suggested X-rays as a\ntreatment. They have a very short wave-length and will penetrate\ntissues and affect the particles in the lungs themselves. Once the\nmaterial is removed from the lungs, the cauterization of the tissue\nceases and it is merely a matter of slow recovery.\"\n\n\"It is a marvelous discovery, Doctor. I can foresee great uses for it\nin medical science if a way can be found to produce it.\"\n\n\"Just now we are much more interested in stopping its production than\nin producing it. Carry on with the line of treatment I have prescribed\nand be ready for a busy time to-night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the hospital, Dr. Bird made his way to the headquarters building\nwhere he conferred with Colonel Wesley on the measures being taken to\nclear the proving ground of all persons not strictly necessary for its\nguarding. The commanding officer, when he learned Dr. Bird's plans,\nwished to send guards with him, but the doctor promptly vetoed the\nscheme.\n\n\"My assistant, Mr. Davis, won't be able to fix up more than two masks\nbefore dark, Colonel,\" he said, \"and you would just be condemning men\nto death to send them with me into that fog without proper protection.\nI can see that you are anxious to know what is causing it, but I'm not\nready to tell just yet. I had given your medical officer enough\ninformation to enable him to treat the hospital cases scientifically,\nand to-morrow or the next day I hope to be able to tell you all about\nit. Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to the laboratory to see how\nMr. Davis is getting along. It will be dark in three-quarters of an\nhour and I hope that everyone will stay under cover as much as\npossible.\"\n\nDavis looked up as Dr. Bird entered the laboratory.\n\n\"I'll have the masks completed in an hour, Doctor,\" he said, \"but I\ndon't know how much value they will be. If the oxygen polymerizes\nbefore it enters the body, these masks ought to stop it, but if it\npolymerizes under the influence of heat and moisture in the lungs,\nthey will be useless.\"\n\n\"I'll have to take a chance on that, Davis. From the description of\nthe fog, I strongly suspect that the process takes place outside the\nbody. Have you had your supper?\"\n\n\"No, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Neither have I. I'll go over to the officers' mess and get a bite to\neat. As soon as you have those masks done, get your supper and then\ntelephone me at the club. If Carnes isn't back, I may have to ask you\nto drive me down toward Michaelville.\"\n\n\"I'll be very glad to, Doctor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarnes had not returned when Davis called Dr. Bird at the officers'\nclub two hours later. Night had fallen and everyone on the proving\nground sat behind tightly closed windows with lights blazing on them,\nwondering whether the finger of death would reach in from the swamp to\ntouch them. The fog had not yet made an appearance on the main post\nand Dr. Bird had no fear of it when he entered his car and drove down\nto pick up his assistant.\n\nDavis came out to meet him with a curious hood made of vitiolene and\nrubber, pulled down well over his head. In his hand he carried a\nsecond one. Dr. Bird adjusted the second mask and the two men loaded\nthe rear of the car with apparatus designed for collecting samples of\nair. The outside of each sample cylinder was heavily coated with black\nrubberine paint. At a word from the Doctor, Davis took the wheel and\ndrove off along the winding ribbon of concrete which led to the upper\nend of the Michaelville range.\n\nFor a mile they drove through a clear, calm night with no traces of\nfog apparent. Dr. Bird's eyes continually searched the swamps on both\nsides of the road.\n\n\"Stop!\" he said suddenly, his voice coming muffled through the\nenveloping mask. The car stopped and the Doctor pointed to the west.\nOver the swamp a few stray fingers of fog were curling up from the\nwater.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaving Davis in charge of the car, Dr. Bird donned rubber hip boots\nand with a gas cylinder in his hand, splashed through the water\ntoward the fog. He reached the place with no difficulty and spent ten\nminutes trying to collect a sample. Finally, with a muttered\nexclamation, he removed his mask and inhaled deeply a dozen times.\nCarrying the mask in his hand, he made his way back to the car.\n\n\"False alarm,\" he said as he pulled on his mask. \"It was so thin that\nI couldn't get a sample so I tested it by breathing. There isn't a\ntrace of cough in that fog. Drive on.\"\n\nA half mile farther along the road, a curtain of fog swept in on them,\nmomentarily hiding the road from view. They were through the belt of\nfog in a few feet and the car came to a stop. Dr. Bird sprang out, gas\ncylinder in hand. He returned to the car shortly.\n\n\"We may have what we are looking for, Davis,\" he said, \"but I am not\nat all certain. It looked very much like ordinary fog. Let's go down\nto the range.\"\n\nThe car drew up between the two main buildings of the Michaelville\nfront. The air was clear as far as they could see, but from under the\nnorth building, a tiny wisp of fog was coming. As it came under the\nglare of the three huge arc-lights which flooded the ground with\nlight, it grew more tenuous and gradually dissipated into nothingness.\nWith an exclamation of satisfaction, Dr. Bird bent down and thrust the\nend of a cylinder under the building. He removed it in a moment as the\nfog began to stream from the upper end. Carefully he closed the\npet-cocks of the tube and replaced it in the car. He filled a half\ndozen tubes before he was satisfied.\n\n\"I'd like to go down to the water,\" he said through his mask. \"What\nkind of a jigger do they run on that track?\"\n\n\"It's a Ford scooter, I was told. It's probably in that shed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later the two men were running the scooter down the four\nmiles of narrow gage track which separated Michaelville from the Bush\nRiver. A few scattered patches of fog could be seen on either side of\nthe track, but none were of sufficient thickness to warrant much\nsuccess in sample taking. At the water front Dr. Bird looked across\nthe half mile wide river and grunted.\n\n\"The tide won't be in for another three hours,\" he said. \"Right now\nthere isn't over sixteen inches of water in there.\"\n\nCarnes was waiting in the well lighted laboratory when they drove up.\n\n\"All right, Davis,\" said the doctor, \"get busy on those samples. If\nyou can't make out the first two, don't crack the others but leave\nthem for me. Give Carnes your mask; he'll drive the rest of the night.\n\n\"What luck, Carnesy?\" he asked, as the detective, wearing Davis' mask,\ndrove toward the officers' club.\n\n\"No stray plane landed or even flew over here last night so far as I\ncould learn. Most of the boats on the bay were either known or lent\nthemselves to ready identification. There were four that I couldn't\nexactly place, but I think we can safely discard all but one. Some\nfishermen were pulling nets on the bay about half a mile outside the\nmouth of the Bush River last night. About eleven, a boat running\nwithout lights passed them. They said that they could not hear an\nengine running, but just a dull hum and the gurgle of a propeller.\nThey hailed it, but got no answer. It faded away into the darkness and\nthey think it was headed toward the mouth of the Bush River. They had\ntheir nets up and reset in another hour but the boat didn't\nreappear.\"\n\n\"Hmm. High tide was at ten minutes after midnight. There was plenty of\nwater in the river at that hour. It sounds promising.\"\n\n\"I thought of telephoning Washington and getting a Coast Guard cutter\nput on patrol in the bay but I didn't like to do it without your\nsanction.\"\n\n\"It might have been a good idea, but on the whole it's probably better\nthat you didn't. Carnes, we'll go down to the water front and see\nwhether anything shows up to-night. High tide will be about\neleven-thirty. It's about half-past nine now. We'd better get going.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the second drive to Michaelville, the fog patches were quite\nnoticeably denser than they had been earlier in the evening. Three\ntimes the car had to pass through bands of fog which covered the road.\nAs they passed the second one Carnes suddenly began to cough.\n\n\"What's the matter, old man?\" cried Dr. Bird, a note of anxiety in his\nvoice. For a few moments Carnes could not answer for coughing. He\nseized the mask to tear it from his head but Dr. Bird restrained him.\nIn a few minutes his voice became intelligible.\n\n\"It seemed like that fog bit right into my lungs, Doctor,\" he gasped.\n\"I felt as if I were choking. It's better now.\"\n\n\"Are you sure your mask isn't leaking, Carnes? It'll be all up with\nyou if it does. Test it.\"\n\nThe detective closed the intake valve of the mask and expelling all of\nthe air from his lungs, took a deep breath. The air whistled noisily\nin through the outlet valve.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried the doctor. \"Take that mask off and let me look at\nit.\"\n\nA few moments were enough to make the needed repairs and they drove\non. Carnes still coughed from time to time. At Michaelville, they\nstarted the scooter and ran down the track to the river. They secreted\nthe scooter under the parapet on the water pent-house and walked to\nthe river's edge.\n\n\"There's no telling just where they may land, Carnes,\" said the doctor\nreflectively, \"but this looks like the most likely place. I'll tell\nyou what we'll do. The river narrows a good deal about half a mile\neast of here. You go up to the narrows and keep watch while I stay\nhere. If any craft passes you, follow it upstream until you find me.\nIf they land, handle the situation as well as you can alone. If you\nhear any shooting, come as fast as you can leg it. I'll do the same.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe detective stole away into the darkness and Dr. Bird settled\nhimself for a long vigil. For an hour nothing broke the stillness of\nthe night. Suddenly the doctor was on his feet, peering downstream. A\nfaint purring murmur came over the water, so faint that no one with\nless sensitive ears than the doctor's could have detected it. Assured\nafter a few minutes of listening that some kind of a craft was coming\nup the river, the doctor sank back into his hiding place, an automatic\npistol firmly grasped in his long tapering fingers.\n\nThe purr came nearer, but it was not appreciably louder. The gurgle of\nwater past the prow of the boat could be heard and Dr. Bird could see\na long ribbon of white on the water where the craft was passing. He\nstepped from his cover and leaned forward, straining his eyes to see\nthe boat. It passed beyond him and continued up the river. He stepped\nquickly along the river bank, trying to keep it in sight. Suddenly he\npaused. The boat had turned and was coming back. Hurriedly he\nreturned to his hiding place.\n\nThe boat came down the river until it was opposite the point where he\ncrouched, and then it turned and came in toward the shore. Dr. Bird\ngripped his pistol and waited. When the craft was less than twenty\nfeet from shore it stopped and a guttural voice spoke. Dr. Bird\nstarted. He had expected the language to be Russian, but it came as a\nshock to him, nevertheless. He strained his ears and cursed his\ninability to make out the words. Dr. Bird had been assiduously\nstudying Russian under the tutelage of his new secretary for some\nmonths, but he had not yet progressed to the stage where he could\nreadily understand it. The gift of languages was one which the erudite\ndoctor did not possess.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boat lay motionless for several minutes. Nervously the doctor\nglanced at his wrist watch. He barely stifled a cry of amazement. From\nthe face of the luminous dial, long streamers of faintly\nphosphorescent light were streaming. He whirled to meet an attack from\nthe rear but he was too late. Even as he turned the muzzle of a pistol\npressed into his back and a voice spoke behind him.\n\n\"Drop that pistol, Doctor, or I'll be under the unpleasant necessity\nof making a hole in you.\"\n\nReluctantly, Dr. Bird dropped his pistol and the voice went on.\n\n\"Really, I hardly expected to catch you by surprise, Doctor. I thought\nyou were clever enough to realize that our boat would be equipped with\nan ultra-violet searchlight. However, even the best minds must rest\nsometimes, and yours is due for a nice long rest. In fact, I might\nalmost prophesy that it will be a permanent rest.\"\n\nDr. Bird shivered despite himself at the cold mercilessness of the\nrailing voice behind him. The accents were ones which he did not\nrecognize. His captor chuckled for a few moments and then called out\nin Russian. The boat came into the shore and eight figures climbed\nout. Two of them bore a small chest which they set down on the wharf.\nOne of the figures picked up the doctor's automatic and his captor\nstepped in front. A flashlight gleamed for an instant and Dr. Bird\nstarted in surprise. The men wore no masks but only a plate of glass\nwhich protected their cheeks and eyes. Fastened to the neck of each\none, below the chin, was a long tube which gleamed like glass. They\nwore heavy knapsacks strapped to their backs from which wires ran to\neach end of the bars.\n\n\"Those protectors make your enveloping head-mask look rather clumsy,\ndon't they, Doctor?\" said his captor mockingly. \"It's too bad you\ndidn't think of them first. It must be such a blow to your pride to\nthink that anyone had invented something better than yours. Really,\nthat mask of yours worries me. Remove it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt his words two of the men stepped forward and tore the doctor's mask\nroughly from his head. The mocking voice went on.\n\n\"In view of the fact that you have only a few hours of life left, Dr.\nBird, it will give me pleasure to let you know how thoroughly you have\nbeen defeated. You may not know me by sight, although my name may not\nbe unfamiliar. I am Peter Denberg.\"\n\nHe turned the flashlight for an instant on his own face, and Dr. Bird\ngazed at him keenly.\n\n\"I'll know you the next time I see you,\" he muttered, half to himself.\n\n\"The next time you see me will be in the hereafter, if there be such a\nthing,\" laughed the Russian. \"The sweetest blow of all is now about\nto fall. We expected you to be here and came prepared to capture you.\nHad we not known that the arch enemy of the people would be here\nto-night, we would have struck at a point miles away. Do you know who\nbetrayed you? It was one we placed in your laboratory for the very\npurpose which she served.\"\n\nHe turned on the light again and it picked out of the darkness another\nface, a long oval face with startlingly red lips and dark oval eyes\nwhich glowed as with an internal flame. As the face became visible,\nthe red lips drew back, exposing strong white teeth and the words were\nliterally spat out.\n\n\"Swine!\" she hissed. \"Bourgeois! Did you think you could bribe me with\nyour gifts to tolerate your vileness? I have brought about your\ndownfall and death, Dr. Bird. I, Feodrovna Androvitch! Now will I\navenge my brother's death at your hands!\"\n\nShe sprang forward and spat full in the doctor's face. Dr. Bird fell\nback for an instant under the ferocity of her attack and long nails\nripped the skin from his face. Denberg stepped forward and caught her\nwrists.\n\n\"Gently, sister,\" he warned. Feodrovna struggled for an instant but\ngave way to the powerful muscles of the communist leader. \"There is no\nneed for anything of that sort,\" he went on. \"In a few moments we will\nopen the chest which we have and then you will enjoy the amazing\nspectacle of the man who has temporarily checked the plans of our\nleader a dozen times, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.\nStart your protectors.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEach of the Russians closed a switch on the knapsack which he wore.\nFrom the bars below their chins came a dull violet glow which made\ntheir faces stand out eerily in the darkness. The flashlight was\ncentered on the box which Dr. Bird could see was made of lead,\nsoldered into a solid mass. At a word from Denberg, one of the\nRussians stepped forward with a long knife in his hand and started to\ncut open the box.\n\nWith a sudden effort, Dr. Bird shook himself loose from the two men\nwho were holding him and sprang forward. Denberg turned to meet him\nand the doctor's fist shot out like a piston rod. Full on the\nRussian's chin it landed and he went down like a poled ox. Two of the\nRussians closed with him but the two were no match for Dr. Bird's\nenormous strength, fighting as he was for his life. He hurled one away\nand swung with all of his strength at the other. His blow struck\nglancingly, and while the Russian spun away under the blow, he did not\nfall. A man caught at him from the rear and Dr. Bird whirled, but as\nhe did so, two men seized his arms from behind. Mightily the doctor\nstrove but others flung themselves on him. He straightened up with a\nsuperhuman effort and then from an unexpected source came help.\n\nOne of the men holding him gave a choking gasp and reeled sideways.\nDr. Bird felt his neck deluged with liquid and the smell of hot blood\nrose sickeningly on the air. He shook himself loose again and smote\nwith all of his strength at his nearest opponent. His blow landed fair\nbut at the same instant an iron bar fell across his arm and it dropped\nlimp and helpless. Again a knife flashed in the darkness and a howl of\npain came from the Russian who felt it bite home.\n\n\"We are attacked!\" cried one of them. They whirled about, their\nflashlights cutting paths through the thickening fog. With her back\nto the crippled doctor's Feodrovna Androvitch held aloft a bloody\nknife.\n\nSomething seemed to catch Dr. Bird by the throat and shut off his\nbreath. From a gash which had been cut in the lead box, a heavy gray\nfog was rising and enveloping everything in its deadening blanket. The\nfog penetrated into the doctor's lungs and an intolerable pain, as\nthough hot irons were searing the tissues, tore him. He tried to\ncough, but the sound could not force its way through his stiffening\nlips. Darkness closed in on him and he swayed. He was dimly conscious\nthat the Russians were swarming about Feodrovna, knives and clubs in\ntheir hands. Then through the night came an ear-splitting crack and a\nflash of orange flame. One of the Russians toppled and fell forward,\nknocking the weakened doctor down as he did so. Again came a flash and\na report, and to the doctor's fading senses came a sound of shouts and\npounding feet. Over his head another flash split the fog and then\ndarkness swarmed in and with a sigh of pain, Dr. Bird let his head\nfall forward on his chest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe recovered consciousness slowly and looked about him. He was in a\nwhite bed in a strange, yet somehow familiar, place with a ray of\nlight of almost intolerable brilliance boring its way into his brain.\nHe tried to raise his hand and found himself curiously weak. With a\ngreat effort he raised his hand until he could see it and let it fall\nwith a cry which came from his lips only as a feeble murmur. His hand\nwas thin almost to the point of emaciation. Blue veins stood out on\nthe back and his long, slim, mobile fingers, the fingers of an artist\nand dreamer, were mere claws, with the skin drawn tight over the\nbones.\n\nA man in a white uniform bent over him. \"Drink this, Doctor,\" came in\nsoothing tones.\n\nHe was too weak to protest and he managed to sip the drink through a\nglass tube. Slowly he felt himself sinking through vast unexplored\nreaches of darkness.\n\nHow long he lay there he did not know but when he again opened his\neyes the light was no longer over him. He strove to speak and a husky\nwhisper came from his lips. A tall woman in white hastened forward and\nbent over him.\n\n\"Where am I?\" he asked with difficulty.\n\n\"You're in the hospital at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Doctor,\" said the\nnurse. \"Everything is all right and you're doing splendidly. Just\ndon't excite yourself and you'll get well in no time. Captain Murdock\nwill be here in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"How long have I been here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, quite a while, Doctor. Now don't ask any more questions. You must\nrest and get well and strong, you know.\"\n\nStrength seemed to be surging slowly back into the doctor's wasted\nframe. His voice came clearer and stronger.\n\n\"How long have I been here?\" he demanded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe nurse hesitated, but her face suddenly cleared as Captain Murdock\nentered the ward.\n\n\"Oh, Captain,\" she cried, \"come here and take care of your patient. He\nwon't keep quiet.\"\n\n\"Out of his head again?\" asked Captain Murdock as he hastened forward.\n\n\"No more than you are,\" came in a husky whisper from Dr. Bird's lips.\n\nCaptain Murdock looked quickly down and smiled in relief. \"You'll\nlive, Dr. Bird,\" he said. \"Just take it easy for a few days and then\nyou can talk all you want to.\"\n\n\"I'll talk now,\" came in stronger tones from the doctor's lips. \"How\nlong have I been here?\"\n\nCaptain Murdock hesitated, but a glance at the doctor's flushed face\nwarned him that it was better to give in than to fight him.\n\n\"You were brought in here two weeks ago yesterday,\" he said. \"It was\ntouch and go for a while, and, but for the treatment you devised, you\nwould have been a goner. We fed you X-rays until I was afraid we would\nburn you up, but they did the business. It will cheer you up to learn\nthat every man who got your treatment is either well or on the high\nroad to recovery.\"\n\n\"The plague?\" asked the doctor faintly.\n\n\"Oh, that's all over, thanks to you. It reached the post that night\nbut under the influence of the daylight blue bulbs you had installed,\nit lost most of its virulence. We had a lot of sore throats in the\nmorning but there wasn't a man dangerously sick. It all faded when the\nsun hit it.\"\n\nAn orderly entered and spoke in an undertone to Captain Murdock. The\nsurgeon hesitated for a moment, his eyes on Dr. Bird, and then nodded.\n\n\"Bring him in,\" he said quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA small, unobtrusively dressed man entered the room and stepped to the\nbedside. Dr. Bird's face lighted up in one of its rare smiles and he\nstrove to raise his hand in greeting.\n\n\"Carnesy, old dear, I'm glad to see you got out all right,\" he\nwhispered. \"I was afraid your mask wouldn't hold up after the trouble\nyou had with it. Tell me what happened that night.\"\n\nCarnes glanced at Captain Murdock, who nodded.\n\n\"I went down to the narrows and watched, Doctor, and when the Russian\nboat passed, I started to make my way back to you. The tide had come\nin and I had to make quite a detour to get to you. I got there a\nlittle later than I liked but still in time to do some good. You were\ndown and Miss Andrews was standing over you with a bloody knife in her\nhand, fighting like a wildcat. I started shooting and ran in yelling\nas loud as I could. I managed to plug three of them and I guess they\nthought I was a dozen men. I tried to make enough noise for that many.\nThe rest took to their heels and Miss Andrews and I rigged one of\ntheir protectors over your face and dragged you to the scooter. The\nrest was plain sailing. We brought you in and Captain Murdock did the\nrest. That's all there was to it. If I hadn't been so slow, I could\nhave driven them off before they opened that box and saved you all of\nthis.\"\n\n\"Thelma?\" asked the doctor faintly.\n\n\"Oh, she's none the worse, Doctor. I want to apologize to you for the\npoor opinion I had of your judgment. That girl wasn't recognized; she\nrecognized Denberg on the streets of Washington and deliberately put\nher head into the lion's mouth by declaring herself. She got their\nwhole plan and went along to try to checkmate them. If she hadn't\nstarted knifing when she did, the devils meant to hold your head\ndirectly over that box and it would have been just too bad.\"\n\n\"What was in the box?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"She found that out. It was some kind of a microbe that Saranoff\ndeveloped in a Belgian laboratory which does something to the oxygen\nof the air. You'll have to get Dr. Burgess to explain that to you\nlater; he has some of the bugs shut up for you to play with when you\nget back on the job. When we found that you were knocked out, Davis\ngot him to come down from Washington to take charge. He has been\nrunning ray machines over the swamps for two weeks and says that every\ntrace of the bugs are gone except those he has in the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Saranoff has more.\"\n\n\"No, he hasn't, thanks to Miss Andrews. Every day they started a fresh\ncolony, leaving one lot back to start the next brood with. She tipped\nus off where they were kept and Bolton and Haggerty raided and got the\nlot and turned them over to Dr. Burgess.\"\n\n\"That's enough for to-day, Mr. Carnes,\" interrupted Captain Murdock.\n\"You can see Dr. Bird to-morrow, but he has had enough excitement for\nto-day.\"\n\nAs Carnes took his leave, the nurse spoke to Captain Murdock. He\nlooked carefully at Dr. Bird and nodded.\n\n\"For one minute. No longer!\" he said.\n\nThe nurse stepped to the door. Into the room came a slim young woman\nof remarkable beauty, her eyes glowing as with an internal light. Her\nparting lips of startling redness showed strong white teeth. Her eyes\ngrew misty as she leaned over the doctor's bed. Dr. Bird blinked for a\nmoment and his face grew stern.\n\n\"Miss Andrews,\" he said in a husky whisper, \"Mr. Carnes has told me\nwhat you did. In my service, success does not excuse disobedience. I\nthank you for your services which may have saved my life and which may\nhave put me in worse danger. In any event, please remember two things.\nUnless you can learn to entirely suppress your emotions and learn that\nI will tolerate nothing but implicit obedience, your usefulness to me\nwill be at an end and I will no longer need you.\"\n\nThe happiness faded from the girl's face as if by magic and an\nexpression of absolute immobility took its place. Her eyes looked as\nthough a curtain had been drawn over them.\n\n\"Yes, Doctor,\" she said in a toneless voice as she turned and left the\nroom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poisoned Air, by Sterner St. Paul Meek\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POISONED AIR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29069.txt or 29069.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/0/6/29069/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
