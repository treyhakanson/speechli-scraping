And all\nthrough the journey she'd studied her _Brief Introduction to Terrestrial\nManners and Mores_ avidly. Perhaps it was a bit overinspirational in\nspots, but it had facts in it, too.\n\nSo she knew that, since the natives were non-alate, she was not to take\nwing on Earth. She had, however, forgotten to correlate the knowledge of\ntheir winglessness with her own vertical habits. As a result, on leaving\nthe tender that had ferried her down from the Moon, she looked up\ninstead of right and narrowly escaped death at the jaws of a raging\ngroundcar that swerved out onto the field.\n\nShe recognized it as a taxi from one of the pictures in the handbook.\nIt was a pity, she thought sadly as she was knocked off her feet, that\nall those lessons she had so carefully learned were to go to waste.\n\nBut it was only the wind of the car's passage that had thrown her down.\nAs she struggled to get up, hampered by her awkward native skirts, the\ndoor of the taxi flew open. A tall young man--a Fizbian--burst out, the\nsoft yellowish-green down on his handsome face bristling with fright\nuntil each feather stood out separately.\n\n\"Miss Morfatch! Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Just--just a little shaky,\" she murmured, brushing dirt from her rosy\nleg feathers. _Too young to be Drosmig; too good-looking to be anyone\nimportant, she thought glumly. Must be the office boy._\n\nTo her surprise, he didn't help her up. Probably it would violate some\nnative taboo if he did, she deduced. The handbook hadn't mentioned\nanything that seemed to apply, but, after all, a little book like that\ncouldn't cover everything.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe could see the young man was embarrassed--his emerald crest was\nwaving to and fro.\n\n\"I'm Stet Zarnon,\" he introduced himself awkwardly.\n\nThe Managing Editor! The handsome young employer of her girlish dreams!\nBut perhaps he had a wife on Fizbus--no, the Grand Editor made a point\nof hiring people without families to use as a pretext for expensive\nvacations on the Home Planet.\n\nAs she opened her mouth to say something brilliantly witty, to show she\nwas no ordinary female but a creature of spirit and fire and\nintelligence, a sudden cacophony of shrill cries and explosions arose,\naccompanied by bursts of light. Her feathers stood erect and she clung\nto her employer with both feathered legs.\n\n\"If these are the friendly diplomatic relations Earth and Fizbus are\nsupposed to be enjoying,\" she said, \"I'm not enjoying them one bit!\"\n\n\"They're only taking pictures of you with native equipment,\" he\nexplained, pulling away from her. What was the matter with him? \"You're\nthe first Fizbian woman ever to come to Terra, you know.\"\n\nShe certainly did know--and, what was more, she had made the semi-finals\nfor Miss Fizbus only the year before. Perhaps he had some Terrestrial\nmalady he didn't want her to catch. Or could it be that in the four\nyears he had spent in voluntary exile on this planet, he had come to\nprefer the native females? Now it was her turn to shrink from him.\n\nHe was conversing rapidly in Terran with the chattering natives who\nmilled about them. Although Tarb had been an honors student in Terran\nback at school, she found herself unable to understand more than an\noccasional word of what they said. Then she remembered that they were\nnot at the world capital, Ottawa, but another community, New York.\nUndoubtedly they were all speaking some provincial dialect peculiar to\nthe locality.\n\nAnd nobody at all booed in appreciation, although, she told herself\nsternly, she really couldn't have expected them to. Standards of beauty\nwere different in different solar systems. At least they were picking up\nas souvenirs some of the feathers she'd shed in her tumble, which showed\nthey took an interest.\n\nStet turned back to her. \"These are fellow-members of the press.\"\n\nShe was able to catch enough of what he said next in Terran to\nunderstand that she was being formally introduced to the aboriginal\njournalists. Although you could never call the natives attractive, with\ntheir squat figures and curiously atrophied vestigial wings--_arms_, she\nreminded herself--they were very Fizboid in appearance and, with their\nwinglessness cloaked, could have creditably passed for singed Fizbians.\n\nMoreover, they seemed friendly; at any rate, the sounds they uttered\nwere welcoming. She began to make the three ritual _entrechats_, but\nStat stopped her. \"Just smile at them; that'll be enough.\"\n\nIt didn't seem like enough, but he was the boss.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thank the stars we're through with that,\" he sighed, as they finally\nwere able to escape their confr\u00e8res and get into the taxi. \"I suppose,\"\nhe added, wriggling inside the clumsy Terrestrial jacket which, cut to\nfit over his wings, did nothing either to improve his figure or to make\nhim look like a native, \"it was as much of an ordeal for you as for me.\"\n\n\"Well, I am a little bewildered by it all,\" Tarb admitted, settling\nherself as comfortably as possible on the seat cushions.\n\n\"No, don't do that!\" he cried. \"Here people don't crouch on seats. They\nsit,\" he explained in a kindlier tone. \"Like this.\"\n\n\"You mean I have to bend myself in that clumsy way?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"In public, at least.\"\n\n\"But it's so hard on the wings. I'm losing feathers foot over claw.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you could....\" He stopped. \"Well, anyhow, remember we have to\ncomply with local customs. You see, the Terrestrials have those things\ncalled arms instead of legs. That is, they have legs, but they use them\nonly for walking.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I'd read about the arms, but I had no idea the natives\nwould be so--so primitive as to actually use them.\"\n\n\"Considering they had no wings, it was very clever of them to make use\nof the vestigial appendages,\" he said hotly. \"If you take their physical\nlimitations into account, they've done a marvelous job with their little\nplanet. They can't fly; they have very little sense of balance; their\nvision is exceedingly poor--yet, in spite of all that, they have\nachieved a quite remarkable degree of civilization.\" He gestured toward\nthe horizontal building arrangements visible through the window. \"Why,\nyou could almost call those streets. As a matter of fact, the natives\ndo.\"\n\nAt the moment, she could take an interest in Terrestrial civilization\nonly as it affected her personally. \"But I'll be able to relax in the\noffice, won't I?\"\n\n\"To a certain extent,\" he replied cautiously. \"You see, we have to use a\ngood deal of native help because--well, our facilities are limited....\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said.\n\nThen she remembered that she was on Terra at least partly to demonstrate\nthe pluck of Fizbian femininity. Back on Fizbus, most of the _Times_\nexecutives had been dead set against having a woman sent out as\nDrosmig's assistant. But Grupe, the Grand Editor, had overruled them.\n\"Time we broke with tradition,\" he had said. He'd felt she could do the\njob, and, by the stars, she would justify his faith in her!\n\n\"Sounds like rather a lark,\" she said hollowly.\n\nStet brightened. \"That's the girl!\" His eyes, she noticed, were emerald\nshading into turquoise, like his crest. \"I certainly hope you'll like it\nhere. Very wise of Grupe to send a woman instead of a man, after all.\nWomen,\" he went on quickly, \"are so much better at working up the human\ninterest angle. And Drosmig is out of commission most of the time, so\nit's you who'll actually be in charge of 'Helpfully Yours.'\"\n\nShe herself in charge of the column that had achieved interstellar fame\nin three short years! Basically, it had been designed to give guidance,\nadvice and, if necessary, comfort to those Fizbians who found themselves\nliving on Terra, for the Fizbus _Times_ had stood for public service\nfrom time immemorial. As Grupe had put it, \"We don't run this paper for\nourselves, Tarb, but for our readers. And the same applies to our\nTerrestrial edition.\"\n\nWith the growing development of trade and cultural relations between the\ntwo planets, the Fizbians on Earth were an ever-increasing number. But\nthey were not the only readers of \"Helpfully Yours.\" Reprinted in the\nparent paper, it was read with edification and pleasure all over Fizbus.\nEveryone wanted to learn more about the ancient and other-worldly Terran\nculture.\n\nThe handbook, _A Brief Introduction to Terrestrial Manners and Mores_,\nowed much of its content to \"Helpfully Yours.\" A grateful, almost\nfulsome, introductory note had said so. But the column truly deserved\nall the praise that had been lavished upon it by the handbook. How well\nshe had studied the thoughtful letters that filled it and the excellent\nand well-reasoned advice--erring, if it erred at all, on the side of\novertolerance--that had been given in return. Of course, on Earth,\nspiritual adjustment apparently was more important than the physical;\nyou could tell that from the questions that were asked. A number of the\nletters had been reprinted in an appendix to the manual.\n\n     _New York_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _When in contact with Terrestrial culture, I find myself constantly\n     overawed and weighed down by the knowledge of my own inadequacy. I\n     cannot seem to appreciate the local art forms as disseminated by\n     the juke box, the comic strip, the tabloid._\n\n     _How can I help myself toward a greater understanding?_\n\n     _Hopefully yours,_\n\n     _Gnurmis Plitt_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     Dear Mr. Plitt:\n\n     Remember, Orkv was not excavated in a week. It took the\n     Terrestrials many centuries to develop their exquisite and esoteric\n     art forms. How can you expect to comprehend them in a few short\n     years? Expose yourself to their art. Work, study, meditate.\n\n     Understanding will come, I promise you.\n\n     Helpfully yours,\n\n     Senbot Drosmig\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     _Paris_\n\n     Dear Senbot Drosmig:\n\n     _To think that I am enjoying the benefits of Terra while my wife\n     and little ones are forced to remain on Fizbus makes my heart ache.\n     Surely it is not fair that I should have so much and they so\n     little. Imagine the inestimable advantage to the fledgling of even\n     a short contact with Terrestrial culture!_\n\n     _Why cannot my loved ones come to join me so that we can share all\n     these wonderful spiritual experiences and be enriched by them\n     together?_\n\n     _Poignantly yours,_\n\n     _Tpooly N'Ox_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     Dear Mr. N'Ox:\n\n     After all, it has been only five years since Fizbian spaceships\n     first came into contact with Terra. In keeping with our usual\n     colonial policy--so inappropriate and anachronistic when applied to\n     a well-developed civilization like Terra's--at first only males are\n     allowed to go to the new world until it is made certain over a\n     period of years that the planet is safe for mothers and future\n     mothers of Fizbus.\n\n     But Stet Zarnon himself, the celebrated and capable editor of the\n     Terran edition of _The Fizbus Times_, has taken up your cause, and\n     I promise you that eventually your loved ones will be able to join\n     you.\n\n     Meanwhile, work, study, meditate.\n\n     Helpfully yours,\n\n     Senbot Drosmig\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     _Ottawa_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _Having just completed a two-year tour of duty on Earth as part of\n     a diplomatic mission, I am regretfully leaving this fair planet.\n     What books, what objects of art, what, in short, souvenirs shall I\n     take back to Fizbus which will give our people some small idea of\n     Earth's rich cultural heritage and, at the same time, serve as\n     useful and appropriate gifts for my friends and relatives back\n     Home?_\n\n     _Inquiringly yours,_\n\n     _Solgus Zagroot_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     Dear Mr. Zagroot:\n\n     Take back nothing but your memories. They will be your best\n     souvenirs.\n\n     Out of context, any other mementos might convey little, if\n     anything, of the true beauty and advanced spirituality of\n     Terrestrial culture, and you might cheapen them were you to use\n     them crassly as souvenirs. Furthermore, it is possible that you, in\n     your ignorance, might unwittingly select some items that give a\n     distorted and false idea of our extrafizbian friends.\n\n     The Fizbian-Earth Cultural Commission, sponsored by _The Fizbian\n     Times_, in conjunction with the consulate, is preparing a vast\n     program of cultural interchange. Leave it to them to do the great\n     work, for you can be sure they will do it well.\n\n     And be sure to tell your fellow-laborers in the diplomatic\n     vineyards that it is wiser not to send unapproved Terran souvenirs\n     back Home. They might cause a fatal misunderstanding between the\n     two worlds. Tell them to spend their time on Earth in working,\n     studying and meditating, rather than shopping.\n\n     Helpfully yours,\n\n     Senbot Drosmig\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now she--Tarb Morfatch--herself was going to be the guiding spirit\nthat brought enlightenment and uplift to countless thousands on Terra\nand millions on Fizbus. Her name wouldn't appear on the columns, but the\nreward of having helped should be enough. Besides, Drosmig was due to\nretire soon. If she proved herself competent, she would take over the\ncolumn entirely and get the byline. Grupe had promised faithfully.\n\nBut what, she wondered, had put Drosmig \"out of commission\"?\n\nThe taxi drew up before a building with a vulgar number of floors\nshowing above ground.\n\n\"Ah--before we--er--meet the others,\" Stet suggested, twitching his\ncrest, \"I was wondering whether you would care to--er--have dinner with\nme tonight?\"\n\nThis roused Tarb from her speculations. \"Oh, I'd love to!\" _A date with\nthe boss right away!_\n\nStet fumbled in his garments for appropriate tokens with which to pay\nthe driver. \"You--you're not engaged or anything back Home, Miss\nMorfatch?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" she said. \"It so happens that I'm not.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" He made an abortive gesture with his leg, then let her get\nout of the taxi by herself. \"It makes the natives stare,\" he explained\nabashedly.\n\n\"But why shouldn't they?\" she asked, wondering whether to laugh or not.\n\"How could they help but stare? We are different.\" _He must be joking._\nShe ventured a smile.\n\nHe smiled back, but made no reply.\n\nThe pavement was hard under her thinly covered soles. Now that walking\nlooked as if it would present a problem, the ban on wing use loomed more\nthreateningly. She had, of course, walked before--on wet days when her\nwings were waterlogged or in high winds or when she had surface\nbusiness. However, the sidewalks on Fizbus were soft and resilient. Now\nshe understood why the Terrestrials wore such crippling foot armor, but\nthat didn't make her feel any better about it.\n\nA box-shaped machine took the two Fizbians up to the twentieth story in\ntwice the time it would have taken them to fly the same distance. Tarb\nsupposed that the offices were in an attic instead of a basement because\nexchange difficulties forced the _Times_ to such economy. She wondered\nruefully whether her own expense account would also suffer.\n\nBut it was no time to worry about such sordid matters; most important\nright now was making a favorable impression on her co-workers. She did\nwant them to like her.\n\nTaking out her compact, she carefully polished her eyeballs. The man at\nthe controls of the machine practically performed a ritual _entrechat_.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" Stet ordered in a harsh whisper.\n\n\"But why not?\" she asked, unable to restrain a trace of belligerence\nfrom her voice. He hadn't been very polite himself. \"The handbook said\nrespectable Terran women make up in public. Why shouldn't I?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"It'll take time for you to catch on, I suppose. There's a\nlot the handbook doesn't--can't--cover. You'll find the setup here\nrather different from on Fizbus,\" he went on as he kicked open the door\nneatly lettered _THE FIZBUS TIMES_ in both Fizbian and Terran. \"We've\nfound it expedient to follow the local newspaper practice. For\ninstance--\" he indicated a small green-feathered man seated at a desk\njust beyond the railing that bisected the room horizontally--\"we have a\nCopy Editor.\"\n\n\"What does he do?\" she asked, confused.\n\n\"He copies news from the other papers, of course.\"\n\n\"And what are _you_ doing tonight, Miss Morfatch?\" the Copy Editor\nasked, springing up from his desk to execute the three ritual entrechats\nwith somewhat more verve than was absolutely necessary.\n\n\"Having dinner with me,\" Stet said quickly.\n\n\"Pulling rank, eh, old bird? Well, we'll see whether position or\nsterling worth will win out in the end.\"\n\nAs the rest of the staff crowded around Tarb, leaping and booing as\nappreciatively as any girl could want, she managed to snatch a rapid\nlook around. The place wasn't really so very much different from a\nFizbian newsroom, once she got over the oddity of going across, not up\nand down, with the desks--queerly shaped but undeniably desks--arranged\nside by side instead of one over the other. There were chairs and\nstools, no perches, but that was to be expected in a wingless society.\nAnd it was noisy. Even though the little machines had stopped clattering\nwhen she came in, a distant roaring continued, as if, concealed\nsomewhere close by, larger, more sinister machines continued their work.\nA peculiar smell hung in the air--not unpleasant, exactly, but strange.\n\nShe sniffed inquiringly.\n\n\"Ink,\" Stet said.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Oh, some stuff the boys in the back shop use. The feature writers,\" he\nwent on quickly, before she could ask what the \"back shop\" was, \"have\nprivate offices where they can perch in comfort.\"\n\nHe led the way down a corridor, opening doors. \"Our drama editor.\" He\nindicated a middle-aged man with faded blue feathers, who hung head\ndownward from his perch. \"On the lobster-trick last night writing a\nreview, so he's catching fifty-one twinkles now.\"\n\n\"Enchanted, Miss Morfatch,\" the critic said, opening one bright eye. \"By\na curious chance, it so happens that tonight I have two tickets to--\"\n\n\"Tonight she's going out with me.\"\n\n\"Well, I can get tickets to any play, any night. And you haven't laughed\nunless you've seen a Terrestrial drama. Just say the word, chick.\"\n\nStet got Tarb out of the office and slammed the door shut. \"Over here is\nthe office of our food editor,\" he said, breathing hard, \"whom you'll be\nexpected to give a claw to now and then, since your jobs overlap. Can't\nintroduce you to him right now, though, because he's in the hospital\nwith ptomaine poisoning. And this is the office you'll share with\nDrosmig.\"\n\nStet opened the door.\n\nUnderneath the perch, Senbot Drosmig, dean of Fizbian journalists, lay\non the rug in a sodden stupor, letters to the editor scattered thickly\nover his shriveled person. The whole room reeked unmistakably of\ncaffeine.\n\nTarb shrank back and twined both feet around Stet's. This time he did\nnot repulse her. \"But how can a--an educated, cultured man like Senbot\nDrosmig sink to such depths?\"\n\n\"It's hard for anyone with even the slightest inclination toward the\nstuff to resist it here,\" Stet replied somberly. \"I can't deny it; the\nsale of caffeine is absolutely unrestricted on Earth. Coffee shops all\nover the place. Coffee served freely at even the best homes. And not\nonly coffee ... caffeine is insiduously present in other of their\npopular beverages.\"\n\nHer eyes bulged sideways. \"But how can a so-called civilized people be\nso depraved?\"\n\n\"Caffeine doesn't seem to affect them the way it does us. Their nervous\nsystems are so very uncomplicated, one almost envies them.\"\n\nDrosmig stirred restlessly under his blanket of correspondence. \"Go\nback ... Fizbus,\" he muttered. \"Warn you ... 'fore ... too late ... like\nme.\"\n\nTarb's rose-pink feathers stood on end. She looked apprehensively at\nStet.\n\n\"Senbot can't go back because he's in no shape to take the interstel\ndrive.\" The young editor was obviously annoyed. \"He's old and he's a\nphysical wreck. But that certainly doesn't apply to you, Miss Morfatch.\"\nHe looked long and hard into her eyes.\n\n\"Few years on planet,\" Drosmig groaned, struggling to his wings, \"'ply\nto anybody.\"\n\nHis feathers, Tarb noticed, were an ugly, darkish brown. She had never\nseen any one that color before, but she'd heard rumors that too much\ncaffeine could do that to you. At least she hoped it was only the\ncaffeine.\n\n\"For your information, he was almost as bad as this when he came!\" Stet\nsnapped. \"Frankly, that's why he was sent here--to get rid of his\nunfortunate addiction. Grupe had no idea, when he assigned him to Earth,\nthat there was caffeine on the planet.\"\n\nThe old man gave a sardonic laugh as he clumsily made his way to the\nperch and gripped it with quivering toes.\n\n\"That is, I don't _think_ he knew,\" Stet said dubiously.\n\nTarb reached over and picked a letter off the floor. The Fizbian\ncharacters were clumsy and ill-made, as if someone had formed them with\nhis feet. Could there be such poverty here that individuals existed who\ncould not afford a scripto? The letter didn't read like any that had\never been printed in the column--at least none that had been picked up\nin the Fizbus edition:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     _New York_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _I am a subaltern clerk in the shipping department of the FizbEarth\n     Trading Company, Inc. Although I have held this post for only three\n     months, I have already won the respect and esteem of my superiors\n     through my diligence and good character. My habits are exemplary: I\n     do not gamble, sing, or take caffeine._\n\n     _Earlier today, while engaged in evening meditation at my modest\n     apartments, I was aroused by a peremptory knock at the door. I\n     flung it open. A native stood there with a small case in his hand._\n\n     _\"Is the house on fire?\" I asked, wondering which of my few humble\n     possessions I should rescue first._\n\n     _\"No,\" he said. \"I would like to interest you in some brushes.\"_\n\n     _\"Are the offices of the FizbEarth Trading Company, Inc., on\n     fire?\"_\n\n     _\"Not to my knowledge,\" he replied, opening his case. \"Now I have\n     here a very nice hairbrush--\"_\n\n     _I wanted to give him every chance. \"Have you come to tell me of\n     any disaster relative to the FizbEarth Trading Company, to myself,\n     or to anyone or anything else with whom or with which I am\n     connected?\"_\n\n     _\"Why, no,\" he said. \"I have come to sell you brushes. Now here is\n     a little number I know you'll like. My company developed it with\n     you folks specially in mind. It's--\"_\n\n     _\"Do you know, sir, that you have wantonly interrupted me in the\n     midst of my meditations, which constitutes an established act of\n     privacy violation?\"_\n\n     _\"Is that a fact? Now this little item is particularly designed for\n     brushing the wings--\"_\n\n     _At that point, I knocked him down and punched him into\n     insensibility with my feet. Then I summoned the police. To my\n     surprise, they arrested me instead of him._\n\n     _I am writing this letter from jail. I do not like to ask my\n     employers to get me out because, even though I am innocent, you\n     know how a thing like this can leave a smudge on the record._\n\n     _What shall I do?_\n\n     _Anxiously yours,_\n\n     _Fruzmus Bloxx_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What should he do?\" Tarb asked, handing Stet the paper. \"Or is the\nquestion academic by now? The letter's five days old.\"\n\nStet sighed. \"I'll find out whether the consulate has been notified.\nNative police usually do that, you know. Very thoughtful fellows. If\nthis Bloxx hasn't been bailed out already, I'll see that he is.\"\n\n\"But how will we answer his letter? Advise him to sue for false arrest?\"\n\nStet smiled. \"But he has no grounds for false arrest. He is guilty of\nassault. The native was entirely within his rights in trying to sell him\na brush. Now--\" he put out a foot--\"brace yourself. Privacy violation is\nnot a crime on Terra. It is perfectly legal. In fact, it does not exist\nas such!\"\n\nAt that point, everything went maroon.\n\nWhen Tarb came to, she found herself lying upon Drosmig's desk. A\nskin-faced native woman was offering her water and clucking.\n\n\"Are you all right, Tarb--Miss Morfatch?\" Stet demanded anxiously.\n\n\"Yes. I--I think so,\" she murmured, raising herself to a crouch.\n\n\"Better ... have died,\" Drosmig groaned from his perch. \"Fate\nworse ... death ... awaits you.\"\n\nTarb tried to smile. \"Sorry to have been so much trouble.\" She stuck out\nher tongue at both Stet and the native.\n\nThe woman drew in her breath.\n\n\"Miss Morfatch,\" Stet reminded Tarb, \"sticking out the tongue is not an\napology on Terra; it is an insult. Fortunately, Miss Snow happens to be\nperhaps the only Terran who would not be offended. She has become\nthoroughly acquainted with us and our odd little customs. She even--\" he\nbeamed at the Terran female--\"has learned to speak our language.\"\n\n\"Hail to thee, O visitor from the stars,\" Miss Snow said in Fizbian.\n\"May thy sojourn upon Earth be an incessant delight and may peace and\nplenty shower their gifts in abundance upon thee.\"\n\nTarb put her hand to her aching head. \"I'm very glad to meet you,\" she\nsaid, glad she did not have to get up to make the ritual _entrechats_.\n\n\"Miss Snow is my right foot,\" Stet said, \"but I'm going to be noble and\nlet her act as your secretary until you can learn to operate a\ntypewriter.\"\n\n\"Secretary? Typewriter?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, there are no scriptos or superscriptos on Earth and we\ncan't import any from Home because the natives--\" Miss Snow\nsmiled--\"don't have the right kind of power here to run psychic\ninstallations. All prosifying has to be done directly on prosifying\nmachines or--\" he paused--\"by foot.\"\n\n\"Catch her!\" Miss Snow exclaimed in Terran.\n\nEverything had gone maroon for Tarb again. As she fell, she could hear a\nsudden thump. It was, she later discovered, Drosmig falling off his\nperch again--the result of insecure grip, she was given to understand,\nrather than excessive empathy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I didn't mean, of course, to give you the impression that we actually\nproduce the individual copies of the papers ourselves,\" Stet explained\nover the dinner table that night. \"We have native printers who do that.\nThey've turned out some really remarkable Fizbian type fonts.\" \"Very\nclever of them,\" Tarb said, knowing that was what she was expected to\nsay. She glanced around the restaurant. In their low-cut evening\ngarments, the Terrestrial females looked much less Fizboid than they had\nduring the day. All that naked-looking skin; one would think they'd want\nto cover it. Probably they were sick with jealousy of her beautiful\nrose-colored down--what they could see of it, anyway.\n\n\"Of course, our real problem is getting proofreaders. The proofing\nmachines won't operate here either, of course, and so we need human\npersonnel. But what Fizbian would do such degrading work? We had thought\nof convict labor, but--\"\n\n\"Why mustn't I take off my wrap?\" Tarb interrupted. \"No one else is\nwearing one.\"\n\nStet coughed. \"You'll feel much less self-conscious about your wings if\nyou keep it on. And try not to use your feet so conspicuously. I'm sure\neveryone understands you need them to eat with, but--\"\n\n\"But I'm not in the least self-conscious about my wings. On Fizbus, they\nwere considered rather nice-looking, if I do say so myself.\"\n\n\"It's better,\" he said firmly, \"not to emphasize the differences between\nthe natives and ourselves. You didn't object to wearing a Terrestrial\ncostume, did you?\"\n\n\"No, I realize I must make some concessions to native prudery, but--\"\n\n\"Matter of fact, I've been thinking it would be a good idea for you to\nwear a stole or a cape or something in the daytime when you go to and\nfrom the office. You wouldn't want to make yourself or the _Times_\nconspicuous, I'm sure.... No, waiter, no coffee. We'll take champagne.\"\n\n\"I want to try coffee,\" Tarb said mutinously. \"Champagne! You'd think I\nwas a fledgling, giving me that bubbly stuff!\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"Now don't be silly, Miss Morfatch ... Tarb. I can't\nlet you indulge in such rash experiments. You realize I am responsible\nfor you.\"\n\nTarb muttered darkly into her _coupe maison_.\n\nStet raised his eyebrows. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I was only wondering whether you'd remembered to check on whether that\nyoung man--Bloxx--ever did get out of jail.\"\n\nStet snapped his toes. \"Glad you reminded me. Completely slipped my\nmind. Let's go and see what happened to him, shall we?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they rose to leave, a dumpy Earthwoman rushed up to them,\nenthusiastically babbling in Terran. Seizing Tarb's foot, she clung to\nit before the Fizbian girl could do anything to prevent her. Tarb had to\nspread her wings wide to retain her balance. Her cloak flew off and an\nadjoining table of diners disappeared beneath it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nStet and the headwaiter rushed to the rescue with profuse apologies,\nStet's crest undulating as if it concealed a nest of snakes. But Tarb\nwas too much frightened to be calmed.\n\n\"Is this a hostile attack?\" she shrieked frantically at Stet. \"Because\nthe handbook never said shaking feet was an Earth custom!\"\n\n\"No, no, she's a friend!\" Stet yelled, leaving the diners still\nstruggling with the cloak as he sped back to her. \"And shaking feet\nisn't an Earth custom; she thinks it's a Fizbian one. You see.... Oh,\nhell, never mind--I'll explain the whole thing to you later. But she's\njust greeting you, trying to put you at your ease. It's Belinda Romney,\na very important Terrestrial. She owns the Solar Press--you must have\nheard of it even on Fizbus--biggest news service on the planet.\nAbsolutely wouldn't do to offend her. Mrs. Romney, may I present Miss\nMorfatch?\"\n\nThe woman beamed and continued to gush endlessly.\n\n\"Tell her to let go my foot!\" Tarb demanded. \"It's getting so it feels\ncarbonated.\"\n\nHe smiled deprecatingly. \"Now, Tarb, we mustn't be rude--\"\n\nFor the first time in her life, Tarb spoke Terran to a Terrestrial. She\nformed the words slowly and carefully: \"Sorry we must leave, but we have\nto go to jail.\"\n\nShe looked to Stet for approval ... and didn't get it. He started to\nexplain something quickly to the woman. Every time she'd heard him speak\nTerran, Tarb thought, he seemed to be introducing, explaining or\napologizing.\n\nIt turned out that, through some oversight, the usually thoughtful\nTerran police department had neglected to inform the Fizbian consul that\none of his people had been incarcerated, for the young man had already\nbeen tried, found guilty of assault plus contempt of court, and\nsentenced to pay a large fine. However, after Stet had given his version\nof the circumstances to a sympathetic judge, the sum was reduced to a\nnominal one, which the _Times_ paid.\n\n\"But I don't see why you should have paid anything at all,\" Bloxx\nprotested ungratefully. \"I didn't do anything wrong. You should have\nmade an issue of it.\"\n\n\"According to Earth laws, you did do wrong,\" Stet said wearily, \"and\nthis is Earth. What's more, if we take the matter up, it will naturally\nget into print. You don't want your employers to hear about it, do\nyou--even if you don't care about making Fizbians look ridiculous to\nTerrestrials?\"\n\n\"I suppose I wouldn't like FizbEarth to find out,\" Bloxx conceded. \"As\nit is, I'll have to do some fast explaining to account for my not having\nshown up for nearly a week. I'll say I caught some horrible Earth\ndisease--that'll scare them so much, they'll probably beg me to take\nanother week off. Though I do wish you fellows over at the _Times_ would\nanswer your mail sooner. I'm a regular subscriber, you know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But the same kind of thing's going to happen over and over again, isn't\nit, Stet?\" Tarb asked as a taxi took them back to the hotel in which\nmost of the _Times_ staff was domiciled. \"If privacy doesn't exist on\nEarth, it's bound to keep occurring.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Stet took his attention away from her toes with some difficulty.\n\"Some Earth people like privacy, too, but they have to fight for it.\nViolations aren't legally punishable--that's the only difference.\"\n\n\"Then surely the Terrestrials would understand about us, wouldn't they?\"\nshe asked eagerly. \"If they knew how strongly we felt about privacy,\nmaybe they wouldn't violate it--not as much, anyway. I'm sure they're\nnot vicious, just ignorant. And you can't just keep on getting Fizbians\nout of jail each time they run up against the problem. It would be too\nexpensive, for one thing.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he said, pressing her toes. \"I'll take care of the whole\nthing.\"\n\n\"An article in the paper wouldn't really help much,\" she persisted\nthoughtfully, \"and I suppose you must have run at least one already. It\nwould explain to the Fizbians that Terrestrials don't regard invasion of\nprivacy as a crime, but it wouldn't tell the Terrestrials that Fizbians\ndo. We'll have to think of--\"\n\n\"You're surely not going to tell me how to run my paper on your first\nday here, are you?\"\n\nHe tried to take the sting out of his words by twining his toes around\nhers, but she felt guilty. She had been presumptuous. Probably there\nwere lots of things she couldn't understand yet--like why she shouldn't\npolish her eyeballs in public. Stet had finally explained to her that,\nwhile Terrestrial women did make up in public, they didn't scour their\nirises, ever, and would be startled and horrified to see someone else\ndoing so.\n\n\"But I was horrified to see them raking their feathers in public!\" Tarb\nhad contended.\n\n\"Combing their hair, my dear. And why not? This is their planet.\"\n\nThat was always his answer. _I wonder_, she speculated, _whether he\nwould expect a Terrestrial visitor to Fizbus to fly ... because, after\nall, Fizbus is our planet._ But she didn't dare broach the question.\n\nHowever, if it was presumptuous of her to make helpful suggestions the\nfirst day, it was more than presumptuous of Stet to ask her up to his\nrooms to see his collection of rare early twentieth-century Terrestrial\nmilk bottles and other antiques. So she just told him courteously that\nshe was tired and wanted to go to roost. And, since the hotel had a\nwhole section fitted up to suit Fizbian requirements, she spent a more\ncomfortable night than she had expected.\n\nShe awoke the next day full of enthusiasm and ready to start in on the\ngreat work at once. Although she might have been a little too forward\nthe previous night, she knew, as she took a reassuring glance in the\nmirror, that Stet would forgive her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the office, she was, at first, somewhat self-conscious about Drosmig,\nwho hung insecurely from his perch muttering to himself, but she soon\nforgot him in her preoccupation with duty. The first letter she picked\nup--although again oddly unlike the ones she'd read in the paper on\nFizbus--seemed so simple that she felt she would have no difficulty in\nanswering it all by herself:\n\n     _Heidelberg_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _I am a professor of Fizbian History at a local university. Since\n     my salary is a small one, owing to the small esteem in which the\n     natives hold culture, I must economize wherever I can in order to\n     make both ends meet. Accordingly, I do my own cooking and shop at\n     the self-service supermarket around the corner, where I have found\n     that prices are lower than in the service groceries and the food no\n     worse._\n\n     _However, the manager and a number of the customers have objected\n     to my shopping with my feet. They don't so much mind my taking\n     packages off the shelves with them, but they have been quite\n     vociferous on the subject of my pinching the fruit with my toes.\n     Unripe fruit, however, makes me ill. What shall I do?_\n\n     _Sincerely yours,_\n\n     _Grez B'Groot_\n\nTarb dictated an unhesitating reply:\n\n     Dear Professor B'Groot:\n\n     Why don't you explain to the manager of the store that Fizbians\n     have wings and feet rather than arms and hands?\n\n     I'm sure his attitude and the attitudes of his customers will\n     change when they learn that your pinching the fruit with your feet\n     is not mere pedagogical eccentricity, but the regular practice on\n     our planet. Point out to him that your feet are covered and,\n     therefore, more sanitary than the bare hands of his other\n     customers.\n\n     And always put on clean socks before you go shopping.\n\n     Helpfully yours,\n\n     Senbot Drosmig\n\nMiss Snow raised pale eyebrows.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Tarb asked anxiously. \"Should I have put in that\nbit about work, study, meditate? It seems inappropriate somehow.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not that. It's just that your letter--well, violates Mr.\nZarnon's precept that, in Rome, one must do as the Romans do.\"\n\n\"But this isn't Rome,\" Tarb replied, bewildered. \"It's New York.\"\n\n\"He didn't make the saying up,\" Miss Snow replied testily. \"It's a\nTerrestrial proverb.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Tarb said.\n\nShe resented this creature's trying to tell her how to do her job. On\nthe other hand, Tarb was wise enough to realize that Miss Snow,\nunpleasant though she might be, probably did know Stet well enough to be\nable to predict his reactions.\n\nSo Tarb not only was reluctant to show Stet what she had already done,\nbut hesitated about answering another and even more urgent letter that\nhad just been brought in by special messenger. She tried to compromise\nby submitting the letters to Drosmig--for, technically speaking, it was\nhe who was her immediate superior--but he merely groaned, \"Tell 'em all\nto drop dead,\" from his perch and refused to open his eyes.\n\nIn the end, Tarb had to take the letters to Stet's office. Miss Snow\ntrailed along behind her, uninvited. And, since this was a place of\nbusiness, Tarb could not claim a privacy violation. Even if it weren't a\nplace of business, she remembered, she couldn't--not here on Earth.\nAdvanced spirituality, hah!\n\nAdvanced pain in the pinions!\n\nStet read the first letter and her answer smilingly. \"Excellent, Tarb--\"\nher hearts leaped--\"for a first try, but I'd like to suggest a few\nchanges, if I may.\"\n\n\"Well, of course,\" she said, pretending not to notice the smirk on Miss\nSnow's face.\n\n\"Just write this Professor B'Goot that he should do his shopping at a\ngrocery that offers service and practice his economies elsewhere. A\nprofessor, of all people, is expected to uphold the dignity of his own\nrace--the idea, sneering at a culture that was thousands of years old\nwhen we were still building nests! Terrestrials couldn't possibly have\nany respect for him if they saw him prodding kumquats with his toes.\"\n\n\"It's no sillier than writing with one's vestigial wings!\" Tarb blazed.\n\n\"Well!\" Miss Snow exclaimed in Terran. \"Well, _really_!\"\n\nTarb started to stick out her tongue, then remembered. \"I didn't mean to\noffend you, Miss Snow. I know it's your custom. But wouldn't you\nunderstand if I typewrote with my feet?\"\n\nMiss Snow tittered.\n\n\"If you want the honest truth, hon, it would make you look like a\nfeathered monkey.\"\n\n\"If you want the honest truth about what you look like to me,\ndearie--it's a plucked chicken!\"\n\n\"Tarb, I think you should apologize to Miss Snow!\"\n\n\"All right!\" Tarb stuck out her tongue. Miss Snow promptly thrust out\nhers in return.\n\n\"Ladies, ladies!\" Stet cried. \"I think there has been a slight confusion\nof folkways!\" He quickly changed the subject. \"Is that another letter\nyou have there, Tarb?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I didn't try to answer it. I thought you'd better have a look\nat it first, since Miss Snow didn't seem to think much of the job I did\nwith the other one.\"\n\n\"Miss Snow always has the _Times'_ welfare at heart,\" Stet remarked\nambiguously, and read:\n\n     _Chicago_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _I am employed as translator by the extraterrestrial division of\n     Burns and Deerhart, Inc., the well-known interstellar mail-order\n     house. As the company employs no other Fizbians and our offices are\n     situated in a small rural community where no others of our race\n     reside, I find myself rather lonely. Moreover, being a bachelor,\n     with neither chick nor child on Fizbus, I have nothing to look\n     forward to upon my return to the Home Planet some day._\n\n     _Accordingly, I decided to adopt a child to cheer my declining\n     years. I dispatched an interstellargram to a reliable orphanage on\n     Fizbus, outlining my hopes and requirements in some detail. After\n     they had satisfied themselves as to my income, strength of\n     character, etc., they sent me a fatherless and motherless egg in\n     cold storage, which I was supposed to hatch upon arrival._\n\n     _However, when the egg came to Earth, it was impounded by Customs.\n     They say it is forbidden to import extrasolar eggs. I have tried to\n     explain to them that it is not at all a question of importation but\n     of adoption; however, they cannot or will not understand._\n\n     _Please tell me what to do. I fear that they may not be keeping the\n     egg at the correct Fizbian freezing point--which, as you know, is a\n     good deal lower than Earth's. The fledgling may hatch by itself and\n     receive a traumatic shock that might very well damage its entire\n     psyche permanently._\n\n     _Frantically yours,_\n\n     _Glibmus Gluyt_\n\n\"Oh, for the stars' sake!\" Stet exploded. \"This is really too much! Viz\nour consul, Miss Snow. That egg must go back to Fizbus at once, before\nany Terrestrials hear of it! And I must notify the government back on\nthe Home Planet to keep a close check on all egg shipments. Something\nlike this must certainly not occur again.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't the Terrestrials hear of it?\" Tarb asked, outraged. \"And\nI think it's mean of you to send back a poor little orphan egg like that\nwhen it has a chance of getting a good home.\"\n\n\"An egg!\" Miss Snow repeated incredulously. \"You mean you really...?\"\nShe gave me one mad little hoot of laughter and then stopped and\nstrangled slightly. Her face turned purple in her efforts to restrain\nmirth. _Really_, Tarb thought, _she looks so much better that color_.\n\nStet's crest twitched violently. \"I hope--\" he began. \"I do hope you\nwill keep this ... knowledge to yourself, Miss Snow.\"\n\n\"But of course,\" she assured him, calming down. \"I'm dreadfully sorry I\nwas so rude. Naturally I wouldn't dream of telling a soul, Mr. Zarnon.\nYou can trust me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can, Miss Snow.\"\n\nTarb almost choked with indignation. \"You mean you've been keeping the\nfacts of our life from Terrestrials? As if they were fledglings ... no,\neven fledglings are told these days.\"\n\n\"One could hardly blame him for it, Miss Morfatch,\" Miss Snow said. \"You\nwouldn't want people to know that Fizbians laid eggs, would you?\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Tarb,\" Stet intervened, \"you don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't I? You're ashamed of the fact that we bear our children in a\nclean, decent, honorable way instead of--\" She stopped. \"I'm being as\nbad as you two are. Probably the Terrestrials' way of reproduction\ndoesn't seem dirty to them--but, since they do reproduce _that_ way,\nthey could scarcely find our way objectionable!\"\n\n\"Tarb, that's not how a young girl should talk!\"\n\n\"Oh, go lay an egg!\" she said, knowing that she had overstepped the\nlimits of propriety, but unable to let him get away with that. \"I hope\nto be a wife and mother some day,\" she added, \"and I only hope that when\nthat time comes, I'll be able to lay good eggs.\"\n\n\"Miss Morfatch,\" Stet said, keeping control of his temper with a visible\neffort, \"that will be enough from you. If common decency doesn't\nrestrain you, please remember that I am your employer and that _I_ set\nthe policies on _my_ paper. You'll do what you're told and keep a civil\ntongue in your head or you'll be sent back to Fizbus. Do I make myself\nclear?\"\n\n\"You do, indeed,\" Tarb said. How could she ever have thought he was\ncharming and handsome? Well, perhaps he still was handsome, but fine\nfeathers do not make fine deeds. And, if it came to that, it wasn't his\npaper.\n\n\"We have the same thing on Terra,\" Miss Snow murmured sympathetically to\nStet. \"These young whippersnappers think they can start in running the\npaper the very first day. Why, Belinda Romney herself--she's a distant\ncousin of mine, you know--told me--\"\n\n\"Miss Snow,\" Tarb said, \"I hope for the sake of Earth that you are not a\ntypical example of the Terrestrial species.\"\n\n\"And you, hon,\" Miss Snow retorted, \"don't belong on a paper, but in a\nchicken coop.\"\n\n\"Ladies!\" Stet said helplessly. \"Women,\" he muttered, \"certainly do not\nbelong on a newspaper. Matter of fact, they don't belong anywhere; their\nplace is in the home only because there's nowhere else to put them.\"\n\nBoth females glared at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next fortnight, Tarb gained fluency in Terran and also\nlearned to operate a Terrestrial typewriter equipped with Fizbian\ntype--mostly so that she could dispense with the services of the\ninvaluable Miss Snow. She didn't like typing, though--it chipped her\ntoenails and her temper. Besides, Drosmig kept complaining that the\nnoise prevented him from sleeping and she preferred him to sleep rather\nthan hang there making irrelevant and, sometimes, unpleasantly relevant\nremarks.\n\n\"Longing for the old scripto, eh?\" one of the cameramen smiled as he\nlounged in the open doorway of her office. Although she was fond of\nfresh air, Tarb realized that she would have to keep the door shut from\nnow on. Too many of the younger members of the staff kept booing at her\nas they passed, and now they had formed the habit of dropping in to\noffer her advice, encouragement and invitations to meals. At first, the\nattention had pleased her--but now she was much too busy to be bothered;\nshe was going to turn out acceptable answers to those letters or die\ntrying.\n\n\"Well, if the power can't be converted, it can't,\" she said grimly.\n\"Griblo, I do wish you'd be a dear and flutter off. I--\"\n\nHe snorted. \"Who says the power can't be converted? Stet, huh?\"\n\nShe took her feet off the keys and looked at him. \"Why do you say 'Stet'\nthat way?\"\n\n\"Because that's a lot of birdseed he gives you about not being able to\nconvert Earth power. Could be done all right, but he and the consul have\nit all fixed up to keep Fizbian technology off the planet. Consul's\nprobably being paid off by the International Association of\nManufacturers and Stet's in it for the preservation of indigenous\nculture--and maybe a little cash, too. After all, those rare antique\ncollections of his cost money.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" Tarb snapped. \"Griblo, please--I have so much work\nto get through!\"\n\n\"Okay, chick, but I warn you, you're going to have your bright-eyed\nillusions shattered. Why don't you wake up to the truth about\nStet? What you should do is maybe eschew the society of all journalists\nentirely, and a sordid lot they are, and devote yourself to\nphotographers--splendid fellows, all.\"\n\n\"Please shut the door behind you!\"\n\nThe door slammed.\n\nTarb gazed disconsolately at the letter before her. Would she ever be\nable to answer letters to Stet's satisfaction? The purpose of the whole\ncolumn was service--but did she and Stet mean the same thing by the same\nword? Or, if they did, whom was Stet serving?\n\nShe was paying too much attention to Griblo's idle remarks. Obviously he\nwas a sorehead--had some kind of grudge against Stet. Perhaps Stet was a\nbit too autocratic, perhaps he had even gone native to some extent, but\nyou couldn't say anything worse about him than that. All in all, he\nwasn't a bad bird and she mustn't let herself be influenced by\nrumormongers like Griblo.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTarb got up and took the letter to Stet. He was in his office dictating\nto Miss Snow. _After all_, Tarb could not repress the ugly thought, _why\nshould he care about the scriptos? He'll never have to use a\ntypewriter._\n\nAnd he was perfectly nice about being interrupted. The only thing he\ndidn't like was being contradicted. _I'm getting bitter_, she told\nherself in surprise. _And at my age, too. I wonder what I'll be like\nwhen I'm old._\n\nThis thought alarmed her and so she smiled very sweetly at Stet as she\nmurmured, \"Would you mind reading this?\" and gave him the letter.\n\n\"Run into another little snag, eh?\" he said affably, giving her foot a\ngentle pat with his. \"Well, let's see what we can do about it.\"\n\n     _Montreal_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _I am a chef at the Cafe Inter-stellaire, which, as everyone knows,\n     is one of the most chic eating establishments on this not very chic\n     planet. During my spare moments, I am a great amateur of the local\n     form of entertainment known as television. I am especially\n     fascinated by the native actress Ingeborg Swedenborg, who, in spite\n     of being a Terran, compares most favorably with our own Fizbian\n     footlight favorites._\n\n     _The other day, while I am in the kitchen engaged in preparing the\n     ragout celeste \u00e0 la fizbe for which I am justly celebrated on nine\n     planets, I hear a stir outside in the dining room. I strain my\n     ears. I hear the cry, \"It is Ingeborg Swedenborg!\"_\n\n     _I cannot help myself. I rush to the doorway. There, behold, the\n     incomparable Ingeborg herself! She follows the headwaiter to a\n     choice table. She is even more ravishing in real life than on the\n     screen. On her, it does not matter that she has no feathers save on\n     the head--even skin looks good. Overcome by involuntary ardor, I\n     boo at her. Whereupon I am violently assailed by a powerfully built\n     native whom I have not previously noticed to be escorting her._\n\n     _I am rescued before he can do me any permanent damage, though, if\n     you wish the truth, it will be a long time before I can fly again.\n     However, I am given notice by the cold-hearted management. Now I am\n     without a job. And what is more, if on this planet one is not\n     permitted to express one's instinctive and natural admiration for a\n     beautiful woman, then all I have to say is that it is a lousy\n     planet and I wiggle my toes at it. How do I go about getting\n     deported?_\n\n     _Impatiently yours,_\n\n     _Rajois Sludd_\n\n\"Oh, I suppose it serves him right,\" Tarb said quickly, before Stet\ncould comment, \"but don't you think it would be a good idea if the\n_Times_ got up a Fizbian-Terrestrial handbook of its own? It's the only\nsolution that I can see. The regular one, I recognize now, is more than\ninadequate, with all that spiritual gup--\" Miss Snow drew in her breath\nsharply--\"and not much else. All these problems are bound to arise again\nand again. Frankly speaking, Stet, your solutions only take care of the\nindividual cases; they don't establish a sound intercultural basis.\"\n\nHe grunted.\n\n\"What's more,\" she went on eagerly, \"we could not only give copies to\nevery Fizbian planning to visit Earth, but also print copies in Terran\nfor Terrestrials who are interested in learning more about Fizbus and\nthe Fizbians. In fact, all Terrans who come in contact with us should\nhave the book. It would help both races to understand each other so much\nbetter and--\"\n\n\"Unnecessary!\" Stet snapped, so violently that she stopped with her\nmouth open. \"The standard handbook is more than adequate. Whatever\nlimitations it may have are deliberate. Setting down in cold print all\nthat ... stuff you want to have included would make a point of things we\nprefer not to stress. I wouldn't want to have the Terrestrials humor me\nas if I were a fledgling or a foreigner.\"\n\nHe leaped out of his chair and paced up and down the office. One would\nthink he had forgotten he ever could fly.\n\n\"But you are a foreigner, Stet,\" Tarb said gently. \"No matter what you\ndo or say, Terrestrials and Fizbians are--well, worlds apart.\"\n\n\"Spiritually, I am much closer to the Terrestrials than--but you\nwouldn't understand.\" He and Miss Snow nodded sympathetically at each\nother. \"And you might be interested to know that I happen to be the\nauthor of all that 'spiritual gup.' I wrote the handbook--as a service\nto Fizbus, I might point out. I wasn't paid for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" Tarb said. \"Oh, _dear_! I really and truly am sorry, Stet.\"\n\nHe brushed her apologies aside. \"Answer that letter. Ignore the question\nabout deportation entirely.\" He ran a foot through his crest. \"Just tell\nthe fellow to see our personnel manager. We could use a chef in the\ncompany dining room. Haven't tasted a decent celestial ragout--at a\nprice I could afford--since I left Fizbus.\"\n\n\"Would you want me to print that reply in the column?\" she asked. \"'If\nyou lose your job because you're unfamiliar with Terrestrial customs,\ncome to the _Times_. We'll give you another job at a much lower\nsalary.'\"\n\n\"Of course not! Send your answer directly to him. You don't think we put\nany of those letters you've been answering in the column, do you? Or any\nthat come in at all, for that matter. I have to write all the letters\nthat are printed--and answer them myself.\"\n\n\"I should have recognized the style,\" Tarb said. \"So this is the service\nthe _Times_ offers to its subscribers. Nothing that would be of help.\nNothing that could prevent other Fizbians from making the same mistake.\nNothing that could be controversial. Nothing that would help\nTerrestrials to understand us. Nothing, in short, but a lot of\nbirdseed!\"\n\n\"Impertinence!\" Miss Snow remarked. \"You shouldn't let her talk to you\nlike that, Mr. Zarnon.\"\n\n\"Tarb!\" Stet roared, casting an impatient glance at Miss Snow. \"How dare\nyou talk to me in that way? And all this is none of your business,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"I'm a Fizbian,\" she stated, \"and it certainly is my business. I'm not\nashamed of having wings. I'm proud of them and sorry for people who\ndon't have them. And, by the stars, I'm going to fly. If skirts are\nimproper to wear for flying, then I can wear slacks. I saw them in a\nTerrestrial fashion magazine and they're perfectly respectable.\"\n\n\"Not for working hours,\" Miss Snow sniffed.\n\n\"I have no intention of flying during working hours,\" Tarb snapped back.\n\"Even you should be able to see that the ceiling's much too low.\"\n\nStet ran a foot through his crest again. \"I hate to say this, Tarb, but\nI don't feel you're the right person for this job. You mean well, I'm\nsure, but you're too--too inflexible.\"\n\n\"You mean I have principles,\" she retorted, \"and you don't.\" Which\nwasn't entirely true; he had principles--it was just that they were\nunprincipled.\n\n\"That will be enough, Tarb,\" he said sternly. \"You'd better go now while\nI think this over. I'd hate to send you back to Fizbus, because\nI'd--well, I'd miss you. On the other hand....\"\n\nTarb went back to her office and drafted a long interstel to a cousin on\nFizbus, explaining what she would like for a birthday present. \"And\nsend it special delivery,\" she concluded, \"because I am having an urgent\nand early birthday.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Tarb Morfatch!\" Stet howled, a few months later. \"What on Earth are you\ndoing?\"\n\n\"Dictating into my scripto,\" Tarb said cheerfully. \"Some of the boys\nfrom the print shop helped fix it up for me. They were very nice about\nit, too, considering that the superscriptos will probably throw them out\nof work. You know, Stet, Terrestrials can be quite decent people.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that scripto?\"\n\n\"Cousin Mylfis sent it to me for my birthday. I must have complained\nabout wearing out my claws on a typewriter and he didn't understand that\nscriptos won't work on Earth. Only they do.\" She beamed at her employer.\n\"All it needed was a transformer. I guess you're just not mechanically\nminded, Stet.\"\n\nHe clenched his feet. \"Tarb, Terrestrials aren't ready for our\ntechnology. You've done a very unwise thing in having that scripto sent\nto you. And I've done a very unwise thing in keeping you here against my\nbetter judgment.\"\n\n\"Maybe the Terrestrials aren't ready,\" she said, ignoring his last\nremark, \"but I'm not going to wear my feet to the bone if I can get a\ngadget that'll do the same thing with no expenditure of physical\nenergy.\" She placed a foot on his. \"I don't see how a thing like this\ncould possibly corrupt the Terrestrials, Stet. It's made a better,\nbrighter girl out of me already.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Drosmig hoarsely from his perch.\n\n\"Shut up, Senbot. You just don't understand, Tarb. If you'll only--\"\n\n\"But I'm afraid I do understand, Stet. And I won't send my scripto\nback.\"\n\n\"May I come in?\" Miss Snow tapped lightly on the door frame. \"Is what I\nhear true?\"\n\n\"About the scripto?\" Tarb asked. \"It certainly is. All you have to do is\ntalk into it and the words appear on the paper. Guess that makes you\nobsolete, doesn't it, Miss Snow?\"\n\n\"And high time, too,\" commented Drosmig. \"Never liked the old biddy.\"\n\n\"Senbot....\" Stet began, and stopped. \"Oh, what's the use trying to talk\nreasonably to either of you! Tarb, come back to my office with me.\"\n\nShe could not refuse and so she followed. Miss Snow, torn between\ncuriosity and the scripto, hesitated and then made after them.\n\n\"I've decided to take you off the column--for this morning, anyway--and\nsend you on an outside assignment,\" Stet told Tarb. \"The consul's wife\nis coming to Earth today. Once she heard there was another woman on\nTerra, nothing could stop her. Consul seems to think it's my fault,\ntoo,\" he added moodily. \"Won't believe I had nothing to do with hiring\nyou. I told the Home Office not to send a woman, that she'd disrupt the\noffice, and you sure as hell have.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said in your letters that you were doing everything\nin your power to bring Fizbian womenfolk to their men on Terra!\" Tarb\npointed out malevolently.\n\n\"Yes,\" he confessed. \"We must please our readers. You know that. Anyway,\nall that's irrelevant right now. What I want you to do is go meet the\nconsul's wife. Nice touch, having the only other Fizbian woman here be\nthe one to interview her. Human interest angle for the Terrestrial\npapers. Shouldn't be surprised if Solar Press picked it up--they like\nitems of that kind for fillers. Take Griblo along with you and make sure\nhe has film in his camera this time.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Tarb said. \"Anything you say, sir.\"\n\nHe pretended not to notice her sarcasm. \"I have a list of the questions\nyou should ask her.\" He fixed her with his eye. \"You stick to them, do\nyou hear me? I don't want anything controversial.\" He rummaged among the\npapers on his desk. \"I know I had it half an hour ago. Sit down, will\nyou, Tarb? Stop hopping around.\"\n\n\"If I can't have a perch, I want a stool,\" Tarb said. \"This is a private\noffice and I think it's a gross affectation for you to have those silly,\nuncomfortable chairs in it.\"\n\n\"If you would have your wings clipped like Mr. Zarnon's--\" Miss Snow\nbegan before Stet could stop her.\n\n\"Stet, you _didn't_!\"\n\nHis crest thrashed back and forth. \"They'll grow back again and it's so\nmuch more convenient this way. After all, I can't use them here and I do\nhave to associate with Terrestrials and use their equipment. The consul\nhas had his wings clipped also and so have several of our more prominent\nindustrialists--\"\n\n\"Oh, _Stet_!\" Tarb wailed. \"I was beginning to think some pretty hard\nthings about you, but I wouldn't ever have dreamed you'd do anything as\nawful as that!\"\n\n\"Why should I have to apologize to you?\" he raged. \"Who do you think you\nare, anyway? You're an incompetent little fool. I should have fired you\nthat first day. I've let you get away with so much only because you have\na pretty face. You've only been on Earth a couple of months; how can you\npresume to think you know what's good and what's bad for the Fizbians\nhere?\"\n\n\"I may not know what's good,\" she retorted, \"but I certainly do know\nwhat's bad. And that's you, Stet--you and everything you stand for. You\nnot only don't have the courage of your convictions, you don't even have\nany convictions. You're ashamed of being a Fizbian, ashamed of anything\nthat makes Fizbians different from Terrestrials, even if it's something\nbetter, something that most Terrans would like to have. You're a damned\nhypocrite, Stet Zarnon, that's what you are--professing to help our\npeople when actually you're hurting them by trying to force them into\nthe mold of an alien species.\"\n\nShe brushed back her crest. \"I take it I'm fired,\" she said more\nquietly. \"Do you want me to interview the consul's wife first or leave\nright away?\"\n\nIt took Stet a moment to bring his voice under control. \"Interview her\nfirst. We'll talk this over when you get back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was pleasant to be away from the office, she thought as the taxi\npulled toward the airfield, and doing wingwork again, even if it proved\nto be the first and last time on this planet. Griblo sat hunched in a\ncorner of the seat, too preoccupied with the camera, which, even after\ntwo years, he hadn't fully mastered, to pay attention to her.\n\nOutside, it was raining, the kind of thin drizzle that, on Fizbus or\nEarth, could go on for days. Tarb had brought along the native umbrella\nshe had purchased in the hotel gift shop--a delightful contraption that\nwas supposed to keep off the rain and didn't, and was supposed to\ncollapse and did, but at the wrong moments. She planned to take it back\nwith her when she returned to Fizbus. Approved souvenir or not, it was\nthe same beautiful purple as her eyes. And, besides, who had made the\nruling about approved souvenirs? Stet, of course.\n\n\"No reason why we couldn't have autofax brought from Home,\" Griblo\nsuddenly grumbled.\n\nTarb pulled herself back from her thoughts. \"I suppose Stet wouldn't let\nyou,\" she said. \"But now that one scripto's here,\" she went on somewhat\ncomplacently, \"he'll have to--\"\n\n\"Keep this planet charming and unspoiled, he says,\" Griblo interrupted\nungratefully. \"Its spiritual values will be corrupted by too much\ncontact with a crass advanced technology. And, of course, he's got the\nlocal camera manufacturers solidly behind him. I wonder whether they\nadvertise in the _Times_ because he helps keep autofax off Terra or\nwhether he keeps the autofax off Terra because they advertise in the\n_Times_.\"\n\n\"But what does he care about advertising? He may talk as if he owned the\n_Times_, but he doesn't.\"\n\nGriblo gave a nasty laugh. \"No, he doesn't, but if the Terran edition\ndidn't show a profit, it'd fold quicker than you can flip your wings and\nhe'd have to go back to nasty old up-to-date Fizbus as a lowly\nsub-editor. And he wouldn't like that one bit. Our Stet, as you may have\nnoticed, is fond of running things to suit himself.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Grupe told me that the _Times_ isn't interested in money. It's\nrunning this edition of the paper only as a service to--oh, I suppose\nall that was a lot of birdseed, too!\"\n\n\"Grupe!\" Griblo snorted. \"The sanctimonious old buzzard! He's a big\nstockholder on the paper. Bet you didn't know that, did you? All they're\nout for is money. Fizbian money, Terrestrial money--so long as it's\ncash.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Griblo,\" Tarb asked, \"what does 'When in Rome, do as the\nRomans do' mean?\"\n\nGriblo grinned sourly. \"Stet's favorite motto.\" He moved along the seat\ncloser to her. \"I'll tell you what it means, chicken. When on Earth,\ndon't be a Fizbian.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe consul's wife, an old mauve creature, did not seem overpleased to\nsee Tarb, since the younger, prettier Fizbian definitely took the\nspotlight away from her. The press had, of course, seen Tarb before, but\nat that time they hadn't been able to communicate directly with her and\nthey didn't, she now found out, think nearly as much of Stet as he did\nof them.\n\nTarb couldn't attempt to deviate much from Stet's questions, for the\nconsul's wife was not very cooperative and the consul himself watched\nboth women narrowly. He was a good friend of Stet's, Tarb knew, and\napparently Stet had taken the other man into his confidence.\n\nWhen the interviews were over and the consular party had left, Tarb\nremained to chat with the Terrestrial journalists. Despite Griblo's\nworried objections, she joined them in the Moonfield Restaurant, where\nshe daringly partook of a cup of coffee and then another and another.\n\nAfter that, things weren't very clear. She dimly remembered the other\nreporters assuring her that she shouldn't disfigure her lovely wings\nwith a stole ... and then pirouetting in the air over the bar to\nprolonged applause ... and then she was in the taxi again with Griblo\nshaking her.\n\n\"Wake up, Tarb--we're almost at the office! Stet'll have me plucked for\nthis!\"\n\nTarb sat up and pushed her crest out of her eyes. The sky was growing\ndark. They must have been gone a long time.\n\n\"I'll never hear the end of this,\" Griblo moaned. \"Why, if only he could\nget someone to fill my place, Stet would fire me like a shot! Not that I\nwouldn't quit if I could get another job.\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll be mostly me he'll be mad at.\" Tarb pulled out her compact.\nStet had warned her not to polish her eyeballs in public, but the ground\nwith him! Her head hurt. And her feathers, she saw in the mirror, had\nturned almost beige. She looked horrible. She felt horrible. And Stet\nwould probably think she was horrible.\n\n\"When Stet's mad,\" Griblo prophesied darkly, \"he's mad at _everybody_!\"\n\nAnd Stet _was_ mad. He was waiting in the newsroom, his emerald-blue\neyes blazing as if he had not only polished but lacquered them.\n\n\"What's the idea of taking six hours to cover a simple story!\" he\nshouted as soon as the door began to open. \"Aside from the trivial\nmatter of a deadline to be met--Griblo, _where's Tarb_? Nothing's\nhappened to her, has it?\"\n\n\"Naaah,\" Griblo said, unslinging his camera. \"She took a short cut,\nonly she got held up by a terrace. Snagged her umbrella on it, I\nbelieve. I heard her yelling when I was waiting for the elevator;\nI didn't know nice girls knew language like that. She should be up\nany minute now.... There she is.\"\n\nHe pointed to a window, through which the lissome form of the young\nfeature writer could be seen, tapping on the glass in order to attract\nattention.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Somebody better open it for her,\" the cameraman suggested. \"Probably\nnot meant to open from the outside. Not many people come in that way, I\nguess.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOpen-mouthed, the whole newsroom stared at the window. Finally the Copy\nEditor got up and let a dripping Tarb in.\n\n\"Nearly thought I wouldn't make it,\" she observed, shaking herself in a\nflurry of wet pink feathers. The rest of the staff ducked, most of them\ntoo late. \"Umbrella didn't do much good,\" she continued, closing it. It\nleft a little puddle on the rug. \"My wings got soaked right away.\" She\ntossed her wet crest out of her eyes. \"Golly, but it's good to fly\nagain. Haven't done it for months, but it seems like years.\" Her eye\ncaught Miss Snow's. \"You don't know what you're missing!\"\n\n\"Tarb,\" Stet thundered, \"you've been drinking coffee! _Griblo!_\" But the\ncameraman had nimbly sought sanctuary in the dark-room.\n\n\"You'd better go home, Tarb.\" When Stet's eye tufts met across his nose,\nhe was downright ugly, she realized. \"Griblo can give me the dope and\nI'll write up the story myself. I can fill it out with canned copy. And\nyou and I will discuss this situation in the morning.\"\n\n\"Won't go home when there's work to be done. Duty calls me.\" Giving a\nbrief and quite recognizable imitation of a Terrestrial trumpet, Tarb\nstalked down the corridor to her office.\n\nDrosmig looked up from his perch, to which he was still miraculously\nclinging at that hour. \"So it got you, too?... Sorry ... nice girl.\"\n\n\"It hasn't got me,\" Tarb replied, picking up a letter marked _Urgent_.\n\"I've got it.\" She scanned the letter, then made hastily for Stet's\noffice.\n\nHe sat drumming on his desk with the antique stainless steel spatula he\nused as a paperknife.\n\n\"Read this!\" she demanded, thrusting the letter into his face. \"Read\nthis, you traitor--sacrificing our whole civilization to what's most\nexpedient for you! Hypocrite! Cad!\"\n\n\"Tarb, listen to me! I'm--\"\n\n\"Read it!\" She slapped the letter down in front of him. \"Read it and see\nwhat you've done to us! Sure, we Fizbians keep to ourselves and so the\nonly people who know anything about us are the ones who want to sell us\nbrushes, while the people who want to help us don't know a damn thing\nabout us and--\"\n\n\"Oh, all right! I'll read it if you'll only keep quiet!\" He turned the\nletter right-side up.\n\n     _Johannesburg_\n\n     _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_\n\n     _I represent the Dzoglian Publishing Company, Inc., of which I know\n     you have heard, since your paper has seen fit to give our books\n     some of the most unjust reviews on record. However, be that as it\n     may, I have opened an office on Earth with the laudable purpose of\n     effecting an interchange of respective literatures, to see which\n     Terrestrial books might most profitably be translated into Fizbian,\n     and which of the authors on our own list might have potential\n     appeal for the Earth reader._\n\n     _Dealing with authors is, of course, a nerve-racking business and I\n     soon found myself in dire need of mental treatment. What was my\n     horror to find that this primitive, although charming, planet had\n     no neurotones, no psychoscopes, not even any cerebrophones--in\n     fact, no psychiatric machines at all! The very knowledge of this\n     brought me several degrees closer to a breakdown._\n\n     _Perhaps I should have consulted you at this juncture, but I admit\n     I was a bit of a snob. \"What sort of advice can a mere journalist\n     give me,\" I thought, \"that I could not give myself?\" So, more for\n     amusement than anything else, I determined to consult a native\n     practitioner. \"After all,\" I said to myself, \"a good laugh is a\n     step forward on the road to recovery.\"_\n\n     _Accordingly, I went to see this native fellow. They work entirely\n     without machines, I understand, using something like witchcraft. At\n     the same time, I thought I might pick up some material for a jolly\n     little book on primitive customs which I could get some unknown\n     writer to throw together inexpensively. Strong human interest items\n     like that always have great reader-appeal._\n\n     _The native chap--doctor, he calls himself--was most cordial,\n     which he should have been at the price I was paying him. One thing\n     I must say about these natives--backward they may be, but they have\n     a very shrewd commercial sense. You can't even imagine the trouble\n     I had getting those authors to sign even remotely reasonable\n     contracts ... which in part accounts for my mental disturbance,\n     I suppose._\n\n     _Well, anyway, I handed the native a privacy waiver carefully\n     filled out in Terran. He took it, smiled and said, \"We'll discuss\n     this afterward. My contact lenses have disappeared; I suppose one\n     of my patients has stolen them again. Can't see a thing without\n     them.\"_\n\n     _So we sat down and had a bit of a chat. He seemed remarkably\n     intelligent for a native; never interrupted me once._\n\n     _\"You are definitely in great trouble,\" he told me when I'd\n     finished. \"You need to be psycho-analyzed.\"_\n\n     _\"Good, good,\" I said. \"I see I've come to the right shop.\"_\n\n     _\"Now just lie down and make yourself comfortable.\"_\n\n     _\"Lie down?\" I repeated, puzzled. I have an excellent command of\n     Terran, but every now and then an idiom will throw me. \"I tell the\n     truth, sir, and when I am required by force of circumstances to\n     lie, I lie up.\"_\n\n     _\"No,\" he said, \"not that kind of lying. You know, the kind you do\n     at night when you go to sleep.\"_\n\n     _\"Oh, I get you,\" I said idiomatically. Without further ado, I\n     flung off my ulster and flew up to a thingummy hanging from the\n     ceiling--chandelier, I believe, is the native term--flipped upside\n     down, and hung from it by my toes. Wasn't the Presidential Perch,\n     by any means, but it wasn't bad at all. \"What do I do next?\" I\n     inquired affably._\n\n     _\"My dear fellow,\" the chap said, whipping out a notebook from the\n     recesses of his costume, \"how long have you had this delusion that\n     you are a bird--or is it a bat?\"_\n\n     _\"Sir,\" I said as haughtily as my position permitted, \"I am neither\n     a bird nor a bat. I am a Fizbian. Surely you have heard of\n     Fizbians?\"_\n\n     _\"Yes, yes, of course. They come from another country or planet or\n     something. Frankly, politics is a bit outside my sphere. All I'm\n     interested in is people--and Fizbians are people, aren't they?\"_\n\n     _\"Yes, certainly. If anything, it's you who.... Yes, they are\n     people.\"_\n\n     _\"Well, tell me then, Mr. Liznig, when was it you first started\n     thinking you were a bat or a bird?\"_\n\n     _I tried to control myself. \"I am neither a bird nor a bat! I am a\n     Fizbian! I have wings! See?\" I fluttered them._\n\n     _He peered at me. \"I wish I could,\" he said regretfully. \"Without\n     my glasses, though, I'm as blind as a bat--or a bird.\"_\n\n     _Well, the long and the short of it is that the natives are\n     planning to certify me as insane and incarcerate me, pending the\n     doctor's decision as to whether my delusion is that I am a bird or\n     a bat. They are using my privacy waiver as commitment papers._\n\n     _Save me, Senbot Drosmig, for I feel that if I have to wait for the\n     doctor's glasses to be delivered, I shall indeed go mad._\n\n     _Distractedly yours,_\n\n     _Tgos Liznig_\n\n\"I'll handle this myself,\" Stet said crisply. \"I'll tell the consul to\nadvise the Terran State Department that this man should be deported as\nan undesirable alien. That'll solve the problem neatly. We can't have\nthis contaminating the pure stream of Terrestrial literature with--\"\n\n\"But aren't you going to explain to them that he's perfectly sane?\" Tarb\ngasped.\n\n\"No need to bother. He'll be grateful enough to get off the planet.\nBesides, how do I know he is perfectly sane?\"\n\n\"Stet Zarnon, you're perfectly horrid!\"\n\n\"And you, Tarb Morfatch, are disgustingly drunk. Now you go right home\nand sleep it off. I know I was too harsh with you--my fault for letting\nyou go out alone with Griblo in the first place when you've been here\nonly a few months. Might have known those Terran journalists would lead\nyou astray. Nice fellows, but irresponsible.\" He flicked out his tongue.\n\"There, I've apologized. Now will you go home?\"\n\n\"Home!\" Tarb shrieked. \"Home when there's work to be done and--\"\n\n\"--and you're not going to be the one to do it. Tarb,\" he said,\nattempting to seize her foot, which she pulled away, \"I was going to\ntell you tomorrow, but you might as well know tonight. I've taken you\noff the column for good. I have a better job for you.\"\n\nShe looked at him. \"A better job? Are you being sarcastic? What as?\"\n\n\"As my wife.\" He got up and came over to her. She stood still, almost\nstunned. \"That solves the whole problem tidily. An office is no place\nfor you, darling--you're really a simple home-girl at heart. Newspaper\nwork is too strenuous for you; it upsets you and makes you nervous and\nirritable. I want you to stay home and take care of our house and hatch\nour eggs--unostentatiously, of course.\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" she spluttered.\n\nHe put his foot over her mouth. \"Don't give me your answer now. You're\nin no condition to think. Tell me tomorrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt rained all night and continued on into the morning. Tarb's head\nached, but she had to make an appearance at the office. First she vizzed\nan acquaintance she had made the day before; then she took her umbrella\nand set forth.\n\nAs she kicked open the door to the newsroom, all sound ceased. Voices\nstopped abruptly. Typewriters halted in mid-click. Even the roar of the\npresses downstairs suddenly seemed to mute. Every head turned to look at\nTarb.\n\n_Humph_, she thought, removing her plastic oversocks, _so suppose I was\na little oblique yesterday. They needn't stare at me. They never stare\nat Drosmig. Just because I'm a woman, I suppose!_ The gate crashed\nloudly behind her.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Morfatch,\" Miss Snow called. \"Mr. Zarnon said he wanted to\nsee you as soon as you came in. It's urgent.\" And she giggled.\n\n\"Really?\" Tarb said. \"Well, he'll just have to wait until I've wrung out\nmy wings.\" Sooner or later, she would have to face Stet, but she wanted\nto put it off as long as possible.\n\nShe opened the door to her office and halted in amazement. For, seated\non a stool behind the desk, haggard but vertical, was Senbot Drosmig,\nbusily reading letters and blue-penciling comments on them with his\nfeet.\n\n\"Good morning, my dear,\" he said, giving her a wan smile. \"Surprised to\nsee me functioning again, eh?\"\n\n\"Well--yes.\" She opened her dripping umbrella mechanically and stood it\nin a corner. \"How--\"\n\n\"I realized last night that all that happened to you was my fault. You\nwere my responsibility and I failed you.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be melodramatic, Senbot. I wasn't your responsibility and you\ndidn't fail me. Not that I'm not glad to see you up and doing again,\nbut--\"\n\n\"But I did fail you!\" the aged journalist insisted. \"And, in the same\nway, I failed my people. I shouldn't have given in. I should have fought\nZarnon as you, my dear, tried to do. But it isn't too late!\" The fire of\nthe crusader lit up in his watery old eyes. \"I can still fight him and\nhis sacred crows--his Earthlings! If I have to, I can go over his head\nto Grupe. Grupe may not understand Stet's moral failings, but he\ncertainly will comprehend his commercial ones. Grupe owns stock in other\nFizbian enterprises besides the _Times_. Autofax, for example.\"\n\n\"Oh, Senbot!\" Tarb wailed. \"The whole thing's such an awful mess!\"\n\n\"I don't think it'll be necessary to threaten that far,\" he comforted\nher. \"Stet is no fool. He knows which side of his breadnut is peeled.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do a wonderful job,\" she exclaimed, impulsively giving\na ritual _entrechat_. \"And I wish I could stay and help you, but....\"\n\n\"I know, my dear.\"\n\n\"You do?\" She was puzzled. \"But how did the news get around so quickly?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"The Terrestrial grapevine is almost as efficient as the\nFizbian. Didn't you notice any change in the--ah--atmosphere when you\ncame in?\"\n\n\"Oh, was that the reason?\" Tarb laughed merrily. \"Somehow it never\noccurred to me that they could have heard so soon.\"\n\n\"But the morning editions have been out for hours.\"\n\nThe door to the office was flung open. Stet stormed in, bristling with a\nmost unloverlike rage.\n\n\"Miss Morfatch--\" he waved a crumpled copy of the _Terrestrial Tribune_\nat her--\"when I give an order, I expect to be obeyed! Didn't Miss Snow\ntell you to report directly to my office the instant you came in?\nAlthough that's a question I don't have to ask; I know Miss Snow, at\nleast, is someone I can trust.\"\n\n\"I was coming to see you, Stet,\" Tarb said soothingly. \"Right away.\"\n\n\"Oh, you were, were you? And have you seen this?\" Stet fairly threw the\npaper at her. Smack in the middle of the front page was a picture of\nherself in full flight over the airfield bar. Not a very good picture,\nbut what could you expect with Terrestrial equipment? When the autofax\ncame, perhaps she would be done justice.\n\n                 FIZBIAN NEWSHEN GIVES EARTH A FLUTTER\n\n         \"Though No Mammal, I Pack a Lot of Uplift,\" Says\n          Beautiful Fizbian Gal Reporter\n\n     \"I feel that you Terrans and we Fizbians can get along much\n     better,\" lovely Tarb Morfatch, Fizbus _Times_ feature writer, told\n     her fellow-reporters yesterday at the Moonfield Restaurant, \"if we\n     learn to understand each other's differences as well as appreciate\n     our similarities.\n\n     \"With commerce between the two planets expanding as rapidly as it\n     has been,\" Miss Morfatch went on, \"it becomes increasingly\n     important that we make sure there is no clash of mores between us.\n     Where adaptation is impossible, we must both adjust. 'When in Rome,\n     do as the Romans do' is an outmoded concept in the complex\n     interstellar civilization of today. The Romans must learn to accept\n     us as we are, and vice versa.\n\n     \"Forgive me if I've offended you by my frankness,\" she said,\n     sticking out her tongue in the charming gesture of apology that is\n     acquiring such a vogue on Earth, Belinda Romney and many other\n     socialites having enthusiastically adopted it, \"but you've violated\n     our privacy so many times, I feel I'm entitled to hurt your\n     feelings just a teeny-weeny bit....\"\n\n\"Those Terran journalists,\" Tarb said admiringly. \"Never miss a trick,\ndo they? Am I in all the other papers too, Stet? Same cheesecake?\"\n\n\"You've made an ovulating circus out of us--that's what you've done!\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Good strong human interest stuff; it'll make us lovable as\nchicks all over the planet. Gee--\" she read on--\"did I say all that\nwhile I was caffeinated? I ought to turn out some pretty terrific copy\nsober.\"\n\n\"And to think you, the woman I had asked to make my wife, did this to\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Stet,\" Tarb said without looking up from the\npaper. \"I wasn't going to accept you, anyway.\"\n\n\"Good for you, Tarb,\" Drosmig approved.\n\n\"You're going back to Fizbus on the next liner--do you hear me?\" Stet\nraged.\n\nShe smiled sunnily. \"Oh, but I'm not, Stet. I'm going to stay right here\non Earth. I like it. You might say the spiritual aura got me.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"How can you possibly stay? You don't have an independent\nincome and this is an expensive planet. Besides, I won't let you stay on\nEarth. I have considerable influence, you know!\"\n\n\"Poor Stet.\" She smiled at him again. \"I'm afraid the Fizbian press--the\nFizbian consul even--are pretty small pullets beside the Solar Press\nSyndicate. You see, I came in this morning only to resign.\"\n\nHe stared at her.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" she informed him, \"I was offered another position--as\nfeature writer for the SP. I hadn't decided whether or not to accept\nwhen I reported back last evening, but you made up my mind for me, so I\ncalled them this morning and took the job. My work will be to explain\nFizbians to Terrans and Terrans to Fizbians--as I wanted to do for the\n_Times_, Stet, only you wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\"It's no use saying anything to you about loyalty, I suppose?\"\n\n\"None whatsoever,\" she said. \"I owe the _Times_ no loyalty and I'm doing\nwhat I do out of loyalty to Fizbus ... plus, of course, a much higher\nsalary.\"\n\n\"I'm glad for you, Tarb,\" Drosmig said sincerely.\n\n\"Be glad for yourself, Senbot, because Stet will have to let you conduct\nthe column your way from now on. Either it'll supplement my work in the\nTerrestrial papers or he'll look like a fool. And you do hate looking\nlike a fool, don't you, Stet?\"\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\n\"Better give up, Stet.\" She turned to Drosmig. \"Well, good-by,\nSenbot--or, rather, so long. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again.\nGood-by, Stet. No hard feelings, I hope?\"\n\nHe neither moved nor spoke.\n\n\"Well ... good-by, then,\" she said.\n\nThe door closed. Stet stared after her. The forgotten umbrella dripped\nforlornly in the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Helpfully Yours, by Evelyn E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
