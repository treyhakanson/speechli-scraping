Meek_\n\n    How could a human body be found actually splintered--broken into\n    sharp fragments like a shattered glass! Once again Dr. Bird\n    probes deep into an amazing mystery.\n\n[Illustration: \"_The bodies had broken into pieces, as though they had\nbeen made of glass._\"]\n\n\n\"Confound it, Carnes, I am on my vacation!\"\n\n\"I know it, Doctor, and I hate to disturb you, but I felt that I simply\nhad to. I have one of the weirdest cases on my hands that I have ever\nbeen mixed up in and I think that you'll forgive me for calling you when\nI tell you about it.\"\n\nDr. Bird groaned into the telephone transmitter.\n\n\"I took a vacation last summer, or tried to, and you hauled me away from\nthe best fishing I have found in years to help you on a case. This year\nI traveled all the way from Washington to San Francisco to get away from\nyou and the very day that I get here you are after me. I won't have\nanything to do with it. Where are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I am at Fallon, Nevada, Doctor. I'm sorry that you won't help me out\nbecause the case promises to be unusually interesting. Let me at least\ntell you about it.\"\n\nDr. Bird groaned louder than ever into the telephone transmitter.\n\n\"All right, go ahead and tell me about it if it will relieve your mind,\nbut I have given you my final answer. I am not a bit interested in it.\"\n\n\"That is quite all right, Doctor, I don't expect you to touch it. I\nhope, however, that you will be able to give me an idea of where to\nstart. Did you ever see a man's body broken in pieces?\"\n\n\"Do you mean badly smashed up?\"\n\n\"No indeed, I mean just what I said, broken in pieces. Legs snapped off\nas though the entire flesh had become brittle.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, and neither did anyone else.\"\n\n\"I have seen it, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Hooey! What had you been drinking?\"\n\nOperative Carnes of the United States Secret Service chuckled softly to\nhimself. The voice of the famous scientist of the Bureau of Standards\nplainly showed an interest which was quite at variance with his words.\n\n\"I was quite sober, Doctor, and so was Hughes, and we both saw it.\"\n\n\"Who is Hughes?\"\n\n\"He is an air mail pilot, one of the crack fliers of the Transcontinental\nAirmail Corporation. Let me tell you the whole thing in order.\"\n\n\"All right. I have a few minutes to spare, but I'll warn you again that\nI don't intend to touch the case.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Suit yourself, Doctor. I have no authority to requisition your\nservices. As you know, the T. A. C. has been handling a great deal of\nthe transcontinental air mail with a pretty clean record on accidents.\nThe day before yesterday, a special plane left Washington to carry two\npackages from there to San Francisco. One of them was a shipment of\njewels valued at a quarter of a million, consigned to a San Francisco\nfirm and the other was a sealed packet from the War Department. No one\nwas supposed to know the contents of that packet except the Chief of\nStaff who delivered it to the plane personally, but rumors got out, as\nusual, and it was popularly supposed to contain certain essential\nfeatures of the Army's war plans. This much is certain: The plane\ncarried not only the regular T. A. C. pilot and courier, but also an\narmy courier, and it was guarded during the trip by an army plane armed\nwith small bombs and a machine-gun. I rode in it. My orders were simply\nto guard the ship until it landed at Mills Field and then to guard the\ncourier from there to the Presidio of San Francisco until his packet was\ndelivered personally into the hands of the Commanding General of the\nNinth Corps Area.\n\n\"The trip was quiet and monotonous until after we left Salt Lake City at\ndawn this morning. Nothing happened until we were about a hundred miles\neast of Reno. We had taken elevation to cross the Stillwater Mountains\nand were skimming low over them, my plane trailing the T. A. C. plane by\nabout half a mile. I was not paying any particular attention to the\nother ship when I suddenly felt our plane leap ahead. It was a fast\nDouglas and the pilot gave it the gun and made it move, I can tell you.\nI yelled into the speaking tube and asked what was the reason. My pilot\nyelled back that the plane ahead was in trouble.\n\n\"As soon as it was called to my attention I could see myself that it\nwasn't acting normally. It was losing elevation and was pursuing a very\nerratic course. Before we could reach it it lost flying speed and fell\ninto a spinning nose dive and headed for the ground. I watched,\nexpecting every minute to see the crew make parachute jumps, but they\ndidn't and the plane hit the ground with a terrific crash.\"\n\n\"It caught fire, of course?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, Doctor, that is one of the funny things about the accident. It\ndidn't. It hit the ground in an open place free from brush and literally\nburst into pieces, but it didn't flame up. We headed directly for the\nscene of the crash and we encountered another funny thing. We almost\nfroze to death.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I say. Of course, it's pretty cold at that altitude all\nthe time, but this cold was like nothing I had ever encountered. It\nseemed to freeze the blood in our veins and it congealed frost on the\nwindshields and made the motor miss for a moment. It was only momentary\nand it only existed directly over the wrecked plane. We went past it and\nswung around in a circle and came back over the wreck, but we didn't\nfeel the cold again.\n\n\"The next thing we tried to do was to find a landing place. That country\nis pretty rugged and rough and there wasn't a flat place for miles that\nwas large enough to land a ship on. Hughes and I talked it over and\nthere didn't seem to be much of anything that we could do except to go\non until we found a landing place. I had had no experience in parachute\njumping and I couldn't pilot the plane if Hughes jumped. We swooped down\nover the wreck as close as we dared and that was when we saw the\ncondition of the bodies. The whole plane was cracked up pretty badly,\nbut the weird part of it was the fact that the bodies of the crew had\nbroken into pieces, as though they had been made of glass. Arms and legs\nwere detached from the torsos and lying at a distance. There was no sign\nof blood on the ground. We saw all this with our naked eyes from close\nat hand and verified it by observations through binoculars from a\ngreater height.\n\n\"When we had made our observations and marked the location of the wreck\nas closely as we could, we headed east until we found a landing place\nnear Fallon. Hughes dropped me here and went on to Reno, or to San\nFrancisco if necessary, to report the accident and get more planes to\naid in the search. I was wholly at sea, but it seemed to be in your line\nand as I knew that you were at the St. Francis, I called you up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are your plans?\"\n\n\"I made none until I talked with you. The country where the wreck\noccurred is unbelievably wild and we can't get near it with any\ntransportation other than burros. The only thing that I can see to do is\nto gather together what transportation I can and head for the wreck on\nfoot to rescue the packets and to bring out the bodies. Can you suggest\nanything better?\"\n\n\"When do you expect to start?\"\n\n\"As soon as I can get my pack train together. Possibly in three or four\nhours.\"\n\n\"Carnes, are you sure that those bodies were broken into bits? An arm or\na leg might easily be torn off in a complete crash.\"\n\n\"They were smashed into bits as nearly as I could tell, Doctor. Hughes\nis an old flier and he has seen plenty of crashes but he never saw\nanything like this. It beats anything that I ever saw.\"\n\n\"If your observations were accurate, there could be only one cause and\nthat one is a patent impossibility. I haven't a bit of equipment\nhere, but I expect that I can get most of the stuff I want from the\nUniversity of California across the bay at Berkeley. I can get a\nplane at Crissy Field. I'll tell you what to do, Carnes. Get your burro\ntrain together and start as soon as you can, but leave me half a\ndozen burros and a guide at Fallon. I'll get up there as soon as I can\nand I'll try to overtake you before you get to the wreck. If I don't,\ndon't disturb anything any more than you can help until my arrival. Do\nyou understand?\"\n\n\"I thought that you were on your vacation, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Oh shut up! Like most of my vacations, this one will have to be\npostponed. I'll move as swiftly as I can and I ought to be at Fallon\nto-night if I'm lucky and don't run into any obstacles. Burros are\nfairly slow, but I'll make the best time possible.\"\n\n\"I rather expected you would, Doctor. I can't get my pack train together\nuntil evening, so I'll wait for you right here. I'm mighty glad that you\nare going to get in on it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilently Carnes and Dr. Bird surveyed the wreck of the T. A. C. plane.\nThe observations of the secret service operative had been correct. The\nbodies of the unfortunate crew had been broken into fragments. Their\nlimbs had not been twisted off as a freak of the fall but had been\ncleanly broken off, as though the bodies had suddenly become brittle and\nhad shattered on their impact with the ground. Not only the bodies, but\nthe ship itself had been broken up. Even the clothing of the men was in\npieces or had long splits in the fabric whose edges were as clean as\nthough they had been cut with a knife.\n\nDr. Bird picked up an arm which had belonged to the pilot and examined\nit. The brittleness, if it had ever existed, was gone and the arm was\nlimp.\n\n\"No _rigor mortis_,\" commented the Doctor. \"How long ago was the\nwreck?\"\n\n\"About seventy-two hours ago.\"\n\n\"Hm-m! What about those packets that were on the plane?\"\n\nCarnes stepped forward and gingerly inspected first the body of the army\ncourier and then that of the courier of the T. A. C.\n\n\"Both gone, Doctor,\" he reported, straightening up.\n\nDr. Bird's face fell into grim lines.\n\n\"There is more to this case than appears on the surface, Carnes,\" he\nsaid. \"This was no ordinary wreck. Bring up that third burro; I want to\nexamine these fragments a little. Bill,\" he went on to one of the two\nguides who had accompanied them from Fallon, \"you and Walter scout\naround the ground and see what you can find out. I especially wish to\nknow whether anyone has visited the scene of the wreck.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guides consulted a moment and started out. Carnes drove up the burro\nthe Doctor had indicated and Dr. Bird unpacked it. He opened a mahogony\ncase and took from it a high powered microscope. Setting the instrument\nup on a convenient rock, he subjected portions of the wreck, including\nseveral fragments of flesh, to a careful scrutiny. When he had completed\nhis observations he fell into a brown study, from which he was aroused\nby Carnes.\n\n\"What did you find out about the cause of the wreck, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think. The immediate cause was that everything was\nfrozen. The plane ran into a belt of cold which froze up the motor and\nwhich probably killed the crew instantly. It was undoubtedly the\naftermath of that cold which you felt when you swooped down over the\nwreck.\"\n\n\"It seems impossible that it could have suddenly got cold enough to\nfreeze everything up like that.\"\n\n\"It does, and yet I am confident that that is what happened. It was no\nordinary cold, Carnes; it was cold of the type that infests interstellar\nspace; cold beyond any conception you have of cold, cold near the range\nof the absolute zero of temperature, nearly four hundred and fifty\ndegrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale. At such temperatures, things\nwhich are ordinarily quite flexible and elastic, such as rubber, or\nflesh, become as brittle as glass and would break in the manner which\nthese bodies have broken. An examination of the tissues of the flesh\nshows that it has been submitted to some temperature that is very low in\nthe scale, probably below that of liquid air. Such a temperature would\nproduce instant death and the other phenomena which we can observe.\"\n\n\"What could cause such a low temperature, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet, although I hope to find out before we are finished.\nCold is a funny thing, Carnes. Ordinarily it is considered as simply the\nabsence of heat; and yet I have always held it to be a definite negative\nquantity. All through nature we observe that every force has its\nopposite or negative force to oppose it. We have positive and negative\nelectrical charges, positive and negative, or north and south, magnetic\npoles. We have gravity and its opposite apergy, and I believe cold is\nreally negative heat.\"\n\n\"I never heard of anything like that, Doctor. I always thought that\nthings were cold because heat was taken from them--not because cold was\nadded. It sounds preposterous.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Such is the common idea, and yet I cannot accept it, for it does not\nexplain all the recorded phenomena. You are familiar with a searchlight,\nare you not?\"\n\n\"In a general way, yes.\"\n\n\"A searchlight is merely a source of light, and of course, of heat,\nwhich is placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector so that all of the\nrays emanating from the source travel in parallel lines. A searchlight,\nof course, gives off heat. If we place a lens of the same size as the\nsearchlight aperture in the path of the beam and concentrate all the\nlight, and heat, at one spot, the focal point of the lens, the\ntemperature at that point is the same as the temperature of the source\nof the light, less what has been lost by radiation. You understand that,\ndo you not?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Suppose that we place at the center of the aperture of the searchlight\na small opaque disc which is permeable neither to heat nor light, in\nsuch a manner as to interrupt the central portion of the beam. As a\nresult, the beam will go out in the form of a hollow rod, or pipe, of\nheat and light with a dark, cold core. This core will have the\ntemperature of the surrounding air plus the small amount which has\nradiated into it from the surrounding pipe. If we now pass this beam of\nlight through a lens in order to concentrate the beam, both the pipe of\nheat and the cold core will focus. If we place a temperature measuring\ndevice near the focus of the dark core, we will find that the\ntemperature is lower than the surrounding air. This means that we have\nfocused or concentrated cold.\"\n\n\"That sounds impossible. But I can offer no other criticism.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Nevertheless, it is experimentally true. It is one of the facts which\nlead me to consider cold as negative heat. However, this is true of\ncold, as it is of the other negative forces; they exist and manifest\nthemselves only in the presence of the positive forces. No one has yet\nconcentrated cold except in the presence of heat, as I have outlined.\nHow this cold belt which the T. A. C. plane encountered came to be there\nis another question. The thing which we have to determine is whether it\nwas caused by natural or artificial forces.\"\n\n\"Both of the packets which the plane carried are gone, Doctor,\" observed\nCarnes.\n\n\"Yes, and that seems to add weight to the possibility that the cause was\nartificial, but it is far from conclusive. The packets might not have\nbeen on the men when the plane fell, or someone may have passed later\nand taken them for safekeeping.\"\n\nThe doctor's remarks were interrupted by the guides.\n\n\"Someone has been here since the wreck, Doctor,\" said Bill. \"Walter and\nI found tracks where two men came up here and prowled around for some\ntime and then left by the way they came. They went off toward the\nnorthwest, and we followed their trail for about forty rods and then\nlost it. We weren't able to pick it up again.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Bill,\" replied the doctor. \"Well, Carnes, that seems to add\nmore weight to the theory that the spot of cold was made and didn't just\nhappen. If a prospecting party had just happened along they would either\nhave left the wreck alone or would have made some attempt to inter the\nbodies. That cold belt must have been produced artificially by men who\nplanned to rob this plane after bringing it down and who were near at\nhand to get their plunder. Is there any chance of following that\ntrail?\"\n\n\"I doubt it, Doc. Walter and I scouted around quite a little, but we\ncouldn't pick it up again.\"\n\n\"Is there any power line passing within twenty miles of here?\"\n\n\"None that Walter and I know of, Doc.\"\n\n\"Funny! Such a device as must have been used would need power and lots\nof it for operation. Well, I'll try my luck. Carnes, help me unpack and\nset up the rest of my apparatus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the aid of the operative, Dr. Bird unpacked two of the burros and\nextracted from cases where they were carefully packed and padded some\nelaborate electrical and optical apparatus. The first was a short\ntelescope of large diameter which he mounted on a base in such a manner\nthat it could be elevated or depressed and rotated in any direction. At\nthe focal point of the telescope was fastened a small knot of wire from\nwhich one lead ran to the main piece of apparatus, which he sat on a\nflat rock. The other lead from the wire knot ran into a sealed container\nsurrounded by a water bath under which a spirit lamp burned. From the\ncontainer another lead led to the main apparatus. This main piece\nconsisted of a series of wire coils mounted on a frame and attached to\nthe two leads. The doctor took from a padded case a tiny magnet\nsuspended on a piece of wire of exceedingly small diameter which he\nfastened in place inside the coils. Cemented to the magnet was a tiny\nmirror.\n\n\"What is that apparatus?\" asked Carnes as the doctor finished his set-up\nand surveyed it with satisfaction.\n\n\"Merely a thermocouple attached to a D'Arsonval galvanometer,\" replied\nthe doctor. \"This large, squat telescope catches and concentrates on the\nthermocouple and the galvanometer registers the temperature.\"\n\n\"You're out of my depth. What is a thermocouple?\"\n\n\"A juncture of two wires made of dissimilar metals, in this case of\nplatinum and of platinum-iridium alloy. There is another similar\njunction in this case, which is kept at a constant temperature by the\nwater bath. When the temperatures of the two junctions are the same, the\nsystem is in equilibrium. When they are at different temperatures, an\nelectrical potential is set up, which causes a current to flow from one\nto the other through the galvanometer. The galvanometer consists of a\nmagnet set up inside coils through which the current I spoke of flows.\nThis current causes the magnet to rotate and by watching the mirror, the\nrotation can be detected and measured.\n\n\"This device is one of the most sensitive ever made, and is used to\nmeasure the radiation from distant stars. Currents as small as\n.000000000000000000000000001 ampere have been detected and measured.\nThis particular instrument is not that sensitive to begin with, and has\nits sensitivity further reduced by having a high resistance in one of\nthe leads.\"\n\n\"What are you going to use it for?\"\n\n\"I am going to try to locate somewhere in these hills a patch of local\ncold. It may not work, but I have hopes. If you will manipulate the\ntelescope so as to search the hills around here, I will watch the\ngalvanometer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several minutes Carnes swung the telescope around. Twice Dr. Bird\nstopped him and decreased the sensitiveness of his instrument by\nintroducing more resistance in the lines in order to keep the magnet\nfrom twisting clear around, due to the fluctuations in the heats\nreceived on account of the varying conditions of reflection. As Carnes\nswung the telescope again the magnet swung around sharply, nearly to a\nright angle to its former position.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the doctor. \"Read your azimuth.\"\n\nCarnes read the compass bearing on the protractor attached to the frame\nwhich supported the telescope. Dr. Bird took a pair of binoculars and\nlooked long and earnestly in the indicated direction. With a sigh he\nlaid down the glasses.\n\n\"I can't see a thing, Carnesy,\" he said. \"We'll have to move over to the\nnext crest and make a new set-up. Plant a rod on the hill so that we can\nget an azimuth bearing and get the airline distance with a range\nfinder.\"\n\nOn the hilltop which Dr. Bird had pointed out the apparatus was again\nset up. For several minutes Carnes swept the hills before an exclamation\nfrom the doctor told him to pause. He read the new azimuth, and the\ndoctor laid off the two readings on a sheet of paper with a protractor\nand made a few calculations.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said reflectively when he had finished his\ncomputations. \"This darned instrument is still so sensitive that you may\nhave merely focused on a deep shadow or a cold spring or something of\nthat sort, but the magnet kicked clear around and it may mean that we\nhave located what we are looking for. It should be about two miles away\nand almost due west of here.\"\n\n\"There is no spring that I know of, Doc, and I think I know of every\nwater hole in this country,\" remarked Bill.\n\n\"There could hardly be a spring at this elevation, anyway,\" replied the\ndoctor. \"Maybe it is what we are seeking. We'll start out in that\ndirection, anyway. Bill, you had better take the lead, for you know the\ncountry. Spread out a little so that we won't be too bunched if anything\nhappens.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor three-quarters of an hour the little group of men made their way\nthrough the wilderness in the direction indicated by the doctor.\nPresently Bill, who was in the lead, held up his hand with a warning\ngesture. The other three closed up as rapidly as cautious progress would\nallow.\n\n\"What is it, Bill?\" asked the doctor in an undertone.\n\n\"Slip up ahead and look over that crest.\"\n\nThe doctor obeyed instructions. As he glanced over he gave vent to a low\nwhistle of surprise and motioned for Carnes to join him. The operative\ncrawled up and glanced over the crest. In a hollow before them was a\ncrude one-storied house, and erected on an open space before it was a\nmassive piece of apparatus. It consisted of a number of huge metallic\ncylinders, from which lines ran to a silvery concave mirror mounted on\nan elaborate frame which would allow it to be rotated so as to point in\nany direction.\n\n\"What is it?\" whispered Carnes.\n\n\"Some kind of a projector,\" muttered the doctor. \"I never saw one quite\nlike it, but it is meant to project something. I can't make out the\ncurve of that mirror. It isn't a parabola and it isn't an ellipse. It\nmust be a high degree subcatenary or else built on a transcendental\nfunction.\"\n\nHe raised himself to get a clearer view, and as he did so a puff of\nsmoke came from the house, to be followed in a moment by a sharp crack\nas a bullet flattened itself a few inches from his head. The doctor\ntumbled back over the crest out of sight of the house. Bill and Walter\nhurried forward, their rifles held ready for action.\n\n\"Get out on the flanks, men,\" directed the doctor. \"The man we want is\nin a house in that hollow. He's armed, and he means business.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBill and Walter crawled under the shelter of the rocks to a short\ndistance away and then, rifles ready, advanced to the attack. A report\ncame from the hollow and a bullet whined over Bill's head. Almost\ninstantly a crack came from Walter's rifle and splinters flew from the\nbuilding in the hollow a few inches from a loophole, through which\nprojected the barrel of a rifle.\n\nThe rifle barrel swung rapidly in a circle and barked in Walter's\ndirection; but as it did so, Bill's gun spoke and again splinters flew\nfrom the building.\n\n\"Good work!\" ejaculated Dr. Bird as he watched the slow advance of the\ntwo guides. \"If we just had rifles we could join in the party, but it's\na little far for effective pistol work. Let's go ahead, and we may get\nclose enough to do a little shooting.\"\n\nPistols in hand, Carnes and the doctor crawled over the crest and joined\nthe advance. Again and again the rifle spoke from the hollow and was\nanswered by the vicious barks of the rifles in the hands of the guides,\nCarnes and the doctor resting their pistols on rocks and sending an\noccasional bullet toward the loophole. The conditions of light and the\nmoving target were not conducive to good marksmanship on the part of the\nbesieged man, and none of the attackers were hit. Presently Walter\nsucceeded in sending a bullet through the loophole. The rifle barrel\nsuddenly disappeared. With a shout the four men rose from their cover\nand advanced toward the building at a run.\n\nAs they did so an ominous whirring sound came from the apparatus in\nfront of the house and a sudden chill filled the air.\n\n\"Back!\" shouted Dr. Bird. \"Back below the hill if you value your\nlives!\"\n\nHe turned and raced at full speed toward the sheltering crest of the\nhill, the others following him closely. The whirring sound continued,\nand the concave reflector turned with a grating sound on its gears. As\nthe path of its rays struck the ground the rocks became white with frost\nand one rock split with a sharp report, one fragment rolling down the\nslope, carrying others in its trail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith panic-stricken faces the four men raced toward the sheltering\ncrest, but remorselessly the reflector swung around in their direction.\nThe intense cold numbed the racing men, cutting off their breath and\nimpeding their efforts for speed.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the doctor suddenly. \"Fire at that reflector! It's our\nonly chance!\"\n\nHe set the example by turning and emptying his pistol futilely at the\nturning mirror. Bill, Walter and Carnes followed his example. Nearer\nand nearer to them came the deadly ray. Bill was the nearest to its\npath, and he suddenly stiffened and fell forward, his useless gun still\ngrasped in his hands. As his body struck the ground it rolled down hill\nfor a few feet, the deadly ray following it. His head struck a rock, and\nCarnes gave a cry of horror as it broke into fragments.\n\nWalter threw his rifle to his shoulder and fired again and again at the\nrotating disc. The cold had became intense and he could not control the\nactions of his muscles and his rifle wavered about. He threw himself\nflat on the ground, and, with an almost superhuman effort, steadied\nhimself for a moment and fired. His aim was true, and with a terrific\ncrash the reflector split into a thousand fragments. Dr. Bird staggered\nto his feet.\n\n\"It's out of order for a moment!\" he cried. \"To the house while we\ncan!\"\n\nAs swiftly as his numbed feet would allow him, he stumbled toward the\nhouse. The muzzle of the rifle again projected from the loophole and\nwith its crack the doctor staggered for a moment and then fell. Walter's\nrifle spoke again and the rifle disappeared through the loophole with a\nspasmodic jerk. Carnes stumbled over the doctor.\n\n\"Are you hit badly?\" he gasped through chattering teeth.\n\n\"I'm not hit at all,\" muttered the doctor. \"I stumbled and fell just as\nhe fired. Look out! He's going to shoot again!\"\n\nThe rifle barrel came slowly into view through the loophole. Walter\nfired, but his bullet went wild. Carnes threw himself behind a rock for\nprotection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rifle swung in Walter's direction and paused. As it did so, from the\nhouse came a strangled cry and a sound as of a blow. The rifle barrel\ndisappeared, and the sounds of a struggle came from the building.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried Carnes as he rose to his feet, and made his stumbling\nway forward, the others following at the best speed which their numbed\nlimbs would allow.\n\nAs they reached the door they were aware of a struggle which was going\non inside. With an oath the doctor threw his massive frame against the\ndoor. It creaked, but the solid oak of which it was composed was proof\nagainst the attack, and he drew back for another onslaught. From the\nhouse came a pistol shot, followed by a despairing cry and a guttural\nshout. Reinforced by Carnes, the doctor threw his weight against the\ndoor again. With a rending crash it gave, and they fell sprawling into\nthe cabin. The doctor was the first one on his feet.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked a voice from one corner. The doctor whirled like a\nflash and covered the speaker with his pistol.\n\n\"Put them up!\" he said tersely.\n\n\"I am unarmed,\" the voice replied. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"We're from the United States Secret Service,\" replied Carnes who had\ngained his feet. \"The game is up for you, and you'd better realize it.\"\n\n\"Secret Service! Thank God!\" cried the voice. \"Get Koskoff--he has the\nplans. He has gone out through the tunnel!\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" demanded Carnes.\n\n\"The entrance is that iron plate on the floor.\"\n\nCarnes and the doctor jumped at the plate and tried to lift it, without\nresult. There was no handle or projection on which they could take\nhold.\n\n\"Not that way,\" cried the voice. \"That cover is fastened on the inside.\nGo outside the building; he'll come out about two hundred yards north.\nShoot him as he appears or he'll get away.\"\n\nThe three men nearly tumbled over each other to get through the doorway\ninto the bitter cold outside. As they emerged from the cabin the gaze of\nthe guide swept the surrounding hills.\n\n\"There he goes!\" he cried.\n\n\"Get him!\" said Carnes sharply.\n\nWalter ran forward a few feet and dropped prone on the ground, cuddling\nthe stock of his rifle to his cheek. Two hundred yards ahead a figure\nwas scurrying over the rocks away from the cabin. Walter drew in his\nbreath and his hand suddenly grew steady as his keen gray eyes peered\nthrough the sights. Carnes and the doctor held their breath in\nsympathy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the rifle spoke, and the fleeing man threw up his arms and fell\nforward on his face.\n\n\"Got him,\" said Walter laconically.\n\n\"Go bring the body in, Carnes,\" exclaimed the doctor. \"I'll take care of\nthe chap inside.\"\n\n\"Did you get him?\" asked the voice eagerly, as the doctor stepped\ninside.\n\n\"He's dead all right,\" replied the doctor grimly. \"Who the devil are\nyou, and what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"There is a light switch on the left of the door as you come in,\" was\nthe reply.\n\nDr. Bird found the switch and snapped on a light. He turned toward the\ncorner from whence the voice had come and recoiled in horror. Propped in\nthe corner was the body of a middle-aged man, daubed and splashed with\nblood which ran from a wound in the side of his head.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he ejaculated. \"Let me help you.\"\n\n\"There's not much use,\" replied the man rather faintly. \"I am about done\nin. This face wound doesn't amount to much, but I am shot through the\nbody and am bleeding internally. If you try to move me, it may easily\nkill me. Leave me alone until your partners come.\"\n\nThe doctor drew a flask of brandy from his pocket and advanced toward\nthe corner.\n\n\"Take a few drops of this,\" he advised.\n\nWith an effort the man lifted the flask to his lips and gulped down a\nlittle of the fiery spirit. A sound of tramping feet came from the\noutside and then a thud as though a body had been dropped. Carnes and\nWalter entered the cabin.\n\n\"He's dead as a mackerel,\" said Carnes in answer to the doctor's look.\n\"Walter got him through the neck and broke his spinal cord. He never\nknew what hit him.\"\n\n\"The plans?\" came in a gasping voice from the man in the corner.\n\n\"We got them, too,\" replied Carnes. \"He had both packets inside his\ncoat. They have been opened, but I guess they are all here. Who the\ndevil are you?\"\n\n\"Since Koskoff is dead, and I am dying, there is no reason why I\nshouldn't tell you,\" was the answer. \"Leave that brandy handy to keep up\nmy strength. I have only a short time and I can't repeat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As to who I am or what I was, it doesn't really matter. Koskoff knew me\nas John Smith, and it will pass as well as any other name. Let my past\nstay buried. I am, or was, a scientist of some ability; but fortune\nfrowned on me, and I was driven out of the world. Money would\nrehabilitate me--money will do anything nowadays--so I set out to get\nit. In the course of my experimental work, I had discovered that cold\nwas negative heat and reacted to the laws which governed heat.\"\n\n\"I knew that,\" cried Dr. Bird; \"but I never could prove it.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded John Smith.\n\n\"Dr. Bird, of the Bureau of Standards.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bird. I've heard of you. You can understand me when I say that as\nheat, positive heat is a concomitant of ordinary light. I have found\nthat cold, negative heat, is a concomitant of cold light. Is my\napparatus in good shape outside?\"\n\n\"The reflector is smashed.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. You would have enjoyed studying it. I presume that you saw\nthat it was a catenary curve?\"\n\n\"I rather thought so.\"\n\n\"It was, and it was also adjustable. I could vary the focal point from a\nfew feet to several miles. With that apparatus I could throw a beam of\nnegative heat with a focal point which I could adjust at will. Close to\nthe apparatus, I could obtain a temperature almost down to absolute\nzero, but at the longer ranges it wasn't so cold, due to leakage into\nthe atmosphere. Even at two miles I could produce a local temperature of\nthree hundred degrees below zero.\"\n\n\"What was the source of your cold?\"\n\n\"Liquid helium. Those cylinders contain, or rather did contain, for I\nexpect that Koskoff has emptied them, helium in a liquid state.\"\n\n\"Where is your compressor?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I didn't have to use one. I developed a cold light under whose rays\nhelium would liquefy and remain in a state of equilibrium until exposed\nto light rays. Those cylinders had merely enough pressure to force the\nliquid out to where the sun could hit it, and then it turned to a gas,\ndropping the temperature at the first focal point of the reflector to\nabsolute zero. When I had this much done, Koskoff and I packed the whole\napparatus here and were ready for work.\n\n\"We were on the path of the transcontinental air mail, and I bided my\ntime until an especially valuable shipment was to be made. My plans,\nwhich worked perfectly, were to freeze the plane in midair and then rob\nthe wreck. I heard of the jewel shipment the T. A. C. was to carry and I\nplanned to get it. When the plane came over, Koskoff and I brought it\ndown. The unsuspected presence of another plane upset us a little, and I\nstarted to bring it down. But we had been all over this country and knew\nthere was no place that a plane could land. I let it go on in safety.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied Carnes with a grimace.\n\n\"We robbed the wreck and we found two packets, one the jewels I was\nafter, and the other a sealed packet, which proved to contain certain\nWar Department plans. That was when I learned who Koskoff was. I had\nhired him in San Francisco as a good mechanic who had no principles. He\nwas to get one-fourth of the loot. When we found these plans, he told me\nwho he was. He was really a Russian secret agent and he wanted to\ndeliver the plans to Russia. I may be a thief and a murderer, but I am\nnot yet ready to betray my country, and I told him so. He offered me\nalmost any price for the plans; but I wouldn't listen. We had a serious\nquarrel, and he overpowered me and bound me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We had a radio set here and he called San Francisco and sent some code\nmessage. I think he was waiting here for someone to come. Had we\nfollowed our original plans, we would have been miles from here before\nyou arrived.\n\n\"He had me bound and helpless, as he thought, but I worked my bonds a\nlittle loose. I didn't let him know it, for I knew that the plane I had\nlet get away would guide a party here and I thought I might be able to\nhelp out. When you came and attacked the house, I worked at my bonds\nuntil they were loose enough to throw off. I saw Koskoff start my cold\napparatus to working and then he quit, because he ran out of helium.\nWhen he started shooting again, I worked out of my bonds and tackled\nhim.\n\n\"He was a better man than I gave him credit for, or else he suspected\nme, for about the time I grabbed him he whirled and struck me over the\nhead with his gun barrel and tore my face open. The blow stunned me, and\nwhen I came to, I was thrown into this corner. I meant to have another\ntry at it, but I guess you rushed him too fast. He turned and ran for\nthe tunnel, but as he did so, he shot me through the body. I guess I\ndidn't look dead enough to suit him. You gentlemen broke open the door\nand came in. That's all.\"\n\n\"Not by a long shot, it isn't,\" exclaimed Dr. Bird. \"Where is that cold\nlight apparatus of yours?\"\n\n\"In the tunnel.\"\n\n\"How do you get into it?\"\n\n\"If you will open that cupboard on the wall, you'll find an open knife\nswitch on the wall. Close it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Bird found the switch and closed it. As he did so the cabin rocked\non its foundations and both Carnes and Walter were thrown to the ground.\nThe thud of a detonation deep in the earth came to their ears.\n\n\"What was that?\" cried the doctor.\n\n\"That,\" replied Smith with a wan smile, \"was the detonation of two\nhundred pounds of T.N.T. When you dig down into the underground cave\nwhere we used the cold light apparatus, you will find it in fragments.\nIt was my only child, and I'll take it with me.\"\n\nAs he finished his head slumped forward on his chest. With an\nexclamation of dismay Dr. Bird sprang forward and tried to lift the\nprostrate form.\n\nIn an agony of desire the Doctor tightened his grip on the dying man's\nshoulder. But Smith collapsed into a heap. Dr. Bird bent forward and\ntore open his shirt and listened at his chest. Presently he straightened\nup.\n\n\"He is gone,\" he said sadly, \"and I guess the results of his genius have\ndied with him. He doesn't strike me as a man who left overmuch to\nchance. Carnes, is your case completed?\"\n\n\"Very satisfactorily, Doctor. I have both of the lost packets.\"\n\n\"All right, then, come back to the wreck and help me pack my burros. I\ncan make my way back to Fallon without a guide.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Doctor?\"\n\n\"That, Carnes, old dear, is none of your blankety blanked business.\nPermit me to remind you that I am on my vacation. I haven't decided yet\njust where I am going, but I can tell you one thing. It's going to be\nsome place where you can't call me on the telephone.\"\n\n\n\n\nBrigands of the Moon\n\n(The Book of Gregg Haljan)\nBEGINNING A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\n    Black mutiny and brigandage stalk the Space-ship Planetara as\n    she speeds to the Moon to pick up a fabulously rich cache of\n    radium-ore.\n\n[Illustration: _I stood on the turret-balcony of the Planetara with Dr.\nFrank, watching the arriving passengers._]\n\n\n_Foreword by Ray Cummings_\n\nI have been thinking that if, during one of those long winter evenings\nat Valley Forge, someone had placed in George Washington's hands one of\nour present day best sellers, the illustrious Father of our Country\nwould have read it with considerable emotion. I do not mean what we call\na story of science, or fantasy--just a novel of action, adventure and\nromance. The sort of thing you and I like to read, but do not find\namazing in any way at all.\n\nBut I fancy that George Washington would have found it amazing. Don't\nyou? It might picture, for instance, a factory girl at a sewing machine.\nGeorge Washington would be amazed at a sewing machine. And the girl,\njourneying in the subway to and from her work! Stealing an opportunity\nto telephone her lover at the noon hour; going to the movies in the\nevening, or listening to a radio. And there might be a climax, perhaps,\nwith the girl and the villain in a transcontinental railway Pullman, and\nthe hero sending frantic telegrams, or telephoning the train, and then\nchasing it in his airplane.\n\nGeorge Washington would have found it amazing!\n\nAnd I am wondering how you and I would feel if someone were to give us\nnow a book of ordinary adventure of the sort which will be published a\nhundred and fifty years hence. I have been trying to imagine such a book\nand the nature of its contents.\n\nLet us imagine it together. Suppose we walk down Fifth Avenue, a\npleasant spring morning of May, 2080. Fifth Avenue, no doubt, will be\nthere. I don't know whether the New York Public Library will be there or\nnot. We'll assume that it is, and that it has some sort of books,\nprinted, or in whatever fashion you care to imagine.\n\nThe young man library attendant is surprised at our curiously antiquated\naspect. We look as though we were dressed for some historical costume\nball. We talk old-fashioned English, like actors in an historical play\nof the 1930 period.\n\nBut we get the book. The attendant assures us it is a good average story\nof action and adventure. Nothing remarkable, but he read it himself, and\nfound it interesting.\n\nWe thank him and take the book. But we find that the language in which\nit is written is too strange for comfortable reading. And it names so\nmany extraordinary things so casually! As though we knew all about them,\nwhich we certainly do not!\n\nSo we take it to the kind-hearted librarian in the language division. He\nmodifies it to old-fashioned English of 1930, and he puts occasional\nfootnotes to help explain some of the things we might not understand.\nWhy he should bother to do this for us I don't know; but let us assume\nthat he does.\n\nAnd now we take the book home--in the pneumatic tube, or aerial moving\nsidewalk, or airship, or whatever it is we take to get home.\n\nAnd now that we are home, let's read the book. It ought to be\ninteresting.\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n    _Tells of the Grantline Moon Expedition and of the Mysterious\n    Martian Who Followed Us in the City Corridor_\n\nOne may write about oneself and still not be an egoist. Or so, at least,\nthey tell me. My narrative went broadcast with a fair success. It was\npantomimed and the public flashed me a reasonable approval. And so my\ndisc publishers have suggested that I record it in more permanent form.\n\nI introduce myself, begging grace that I intrude upon your busy minutes,\nwith my only excuse that perhaps I may amuse you. For what the\ncommercial sellers of my pictured version were pleased to blare as my\nhandsome face, I ask your indulgence. My feminine audience of the\npantomimes was undoubtedly graciously pleased at my personality and\nphysical aspect. That I am \"tall as a Viking of old\"--and \"handsome as a\nyoung Norse God\"--is very pretty talk in the selling of my product. But\nI deplore its intrusion into the personality of this, my recorded\nnarrative. And so now, for preface, to all my audience I do give earnest\nassurance that Gregg Haljan is no conceited zebra, handsomely striped by\nnature, and proud of it. Not so. I am, I do beg you to believe, a very\nhumble fellow, striving for your approval, hoping only to entertain\nyou.\n\nMy introduction: My name, Gregg Haljan. My age, twenty-five years. I\nwas, at the time my narrative begins, Third Officer on the Space-Ship\nPlanetara. Our line was newly established; in 2070, to be exact,\nfollowing the modern improvements of the Martel Magnetic Levitation.[1]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur ship, whose home port was Great-New York, carried mail and passenger\ntraffic to and from both Venus and Mars. Of astronomical necessity, our\nflights were irregular. This spring, with the two other planets both\nclose to the earth, we were making two complete round trips. We had just\narrived in Great-New York, this May evening, from Grebhar, Venus Free\nState. With only five hours in port here, we were departing the same\nnight at the zero hour for Ferrok-Shahn, capital of the Martian Union.\n\nWe were no sooner at the landing stage than I found a code-flash\nsummoning Dan Dean and me to Divisional Detective Headquarters. Dan\n\"Snap\" Dean was one of my closest friends. He was radio-helio operator\nof the Planetara. A small, wiry, red-headed chap, with a quick, ready\nlaugh and a wit that made everyone like him.\n\nThe summons to Detective-Colonel Halsey's office surprised us. Snap eyed\nme.\n\n\"You haven't been opening any treasury vaults, have you, Gregg?\"\n\n\"He wants you, also,\" I retorted.\n\nHe laughed. \"Well, he can roar at me like a traffic switchman and my\nprivate life will remain my own.\"\n\nWe could not think why we should be wanted. It was the darkness of\nmid-evening when we left the Planetara for Halsey's office. It was not a\nlong trip. We went direct in the upper monorail, descending into the\nsubterranean city at Park-Circle 30.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had never been to Halsey's office before. We found it to be a gloomy,\nvaultlike place in one of the deepest corridors. The door lifted.\n\n\"Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean.\"\n\nThe guard stood aside. \"Come in.\"\n\nI own that my heart was unduly thumping as we entered. The door dropped\nbehind us. It was a small blue-lit apartment--a steel-lined room like a\nvault.\n\nColonel Halsey sat at his desk. And the big, heavy-set, florid Captain\nCarter--our commander of the Planetara--was here. That surprised us: we\nhad not seen him leave the ship.\n\nHalsey smiled at us gravely. Captain Carter said, \"Sit down, lads.\"\n\nWe took the seats. There was an alarming solemnity about this. If I had\nbeen guilty of anything that I could think of, it would have been\nfrightening. But Halsey's first words reassured me.\n\n\"It's about the Grantline Moon Expedition. In spite of our secrecy, the\nnews has gotten out. We want to know how. Can you tell us?\"\n\nCaptain Carter's huge bulk--he was about as tall as I am--towered over\nus as we sat before Halsey's desk. \"If you lads have told anyone--said\nanything--let slip the slightest hint about it--\"\n\nSnap smiled with relief; but he turned solemn at once. \"I haven't. Not a\nword!\"\n\n\"Nor have I,\" I declared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Grantline Moon Expedition! We had not thought of that as a reason\nfor this summons. Johnny Grantline was a close friend to us both. He had\norganized an exploring expedition to the Moon. Uninhabited, with its\nbleak, forbidding, airless, waterless surface, the Moon--even though so\nclose to the Earth--was seldom visited. No regular ship ever stopped\nthere. A few exploring parties of recent years had come to grief.\n\nBut there was a persistent rumor that upon the Moon, mineral riches of\nfabulous wealth were awaiting discovery. The thing had already caused\nsome interplanetary complications. The aggressive Martians would be only\ntoo glad to explore the Moon. But the U.S.W.[2] definitely warned them\naway. The Moon was World Territory, we announced, and we would protect\nit as such.\n\nThe threatened conflict between the Earth and Mars had come to nothing.\nThere was, this year of 2079, a thorough amity between all three of the\ninhabited planets. It still holds, and I pray that it may always hold.\n\nThere was, nevertheless, a realization by our government, that whatever\nriches might be upon the Moon should be seized at once and held by some\nreputable Earth Company. And when Johnny Grantline applied, with his\nfather's wealth and his own scientific record of attainment, the\ngovernment was only too glad to grant him its writ.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Grantline Expedition had started six months ago. The Martian\ngovernment had acquiesced in our ultimatum, yet brigands have been known\nto be financed under cover of a governmental disavowal. And so the\nexpedition was kept secret.\n\nMy words need give no offense to any Martian who comes upon them. I\nrefer to the history of our earth only. The Grantline Expedition was on\nthe Moon now. No word had come from it. One could not flash helios even\nin code without letting all the universe know that explorers were on the\nMoon. And why they were there, anyone could easily guess.\n\nAnd now Colonel Halsey was telling us that the news was abroad! Captain\nCarter eyed us closely; his flashing eyes under the white bushy brows\nwould pry a secret from anyone.\n\n\"You're sure? A girl of Venus, perhaps, with her cursed, seductive lure!\nA chance word, with you lads befuddled by alcolite?\"\n\nWe assured him we had been careful. By the heavens, I know that I had\nbeen. Not a whisper, even to Snap, of the name Grantline in six months\nor more.\n\nCaptain Carter added abruptly, \"We're insulated here, Halsey?\"\n\n\"Yes, talk as freely as you like. An eavesdropping ray will never get\ninto these walls.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey questioned us. They were satisfied at last that, though the secret\nhad escaped, we had not done it. Hearing it discussed, it occurred to me\nto wonder why Carter was concerned. I was not aware that he knew of\nGrantline's venture. I learned now the reason why the Planetara, upon\neach of her voyages, had managed to pass fairly close to the Moon. It\nhad been arranged with Grantline that if he wanted help or had any\nimportant message, he was to flash it locally to our passing ship. And\nthis Snap knew, and had never mentioned it, even to me.\n\nHalsey was saying, \"Well, we can't blame you, but the secret is out.\"\n\nSnap and I regarded each other. What could anyone do? What would anyone\ndare do?\n\nCaptain Carter said abruptly, \"Look here, lads, this is my chance now to\ntalk plainly to you. Outside, anywhere outside these walls, an\neavesdropping ray may be upon us. You know that? One may never even dare\nwhisper since that accursed ray was developed.\"\n\nSnap opened his mouth to speak but decided against it. My heart was\npounding.\n\nCaptain Carter went on, \"I know I can trust you two more than anyone\nelse under me on the Planetara--\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" I demanded. \"What--\"\n\nHe interrupted me. \"Nothing at all but what I say.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalsey smiled grimly. \"What he means, Haljan, is that things are not\nalways what they seem these days. One cannot always tell a friend from\nan enemy. The Planetara is a public vessel. You have--how many is it,\nCarter?--thirty or forty passengers this trip to-night?\"\n\n\"Thirty-eight,\" said Carter.\n\n\"There are thirty-eight people listed for the flight to Ferrok-Shahn\nto-night,\" Halsey said slowly. \"And some may not be what they seem.\" He\nraised his thin dark hand. \"We have information--\" He paused. \"I\nconfess, we know almost nothing--hardly more than enough to alarm us.\"\n\nCaptain Carter interjected, \"I want you and Dean to be on your guard.\nOnce on the Planetara it is difficult for us to talk openly, but be\nwatchful. I will arrange for us to be doubly armed.\"\n\nVague, perturbing words! Halsey said, \"They tell me George Prince is\nlisted for the voyage. I am suggesting, Haljan, that you keep your\neye especially upon him. Your duties on the Planetara leave you\ncomparatively free, don't they?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. With the first and second officers on duty, and the\ncaptain aboard, my routine was more or less that of an understudy.\n\nI said, \"George Prince! Who is he?\"\n\n\"A mechanical engineer,\" said Halsey. \"An under-official of the\nEarth Federated Radium Corporation. But he associates with bad\ncompanions--particularly Martians.\"\n\nI had never heard of this George Prince, though I was familiar with the\nFederated Radium Corporation, of course. A semi-government trust, which\ncontrolled virtually the entire Earth supply of radium.\n\n\"He was in the Automotive Department,\" Carter put in. \"You've heard of\nthe Federated Radium Motor?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had, of course. A recent Earth invention which promised to\nrevolutionize the automotive industry. An engine of a new type, using\nradium as its fuel.\n\nSnap demanded, \"What in the stars has this got to do with Johnny\nGrantline?\"\n\n\"Much,\" said Halsey quietly, \"or perhaps nothing. But George Prince some\nyears ago mixed in rather unethical transactions. We had him in custody\nonce. He is known now as unusually friendly with several Martians in New\nYork of bad reputation.\"\n\n\"Well--\" began Snap.\n\n\"What you don't know,\" Halsey went on quietly, \"is that Grantline\nexpects to find radium on the Moon.\"\n\nWe gasped.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Halsey. \"The ill-fated Ballon Expedition thought they\nhad found it on the Moon some years ago. A new type of ore, as rich in\nradium as our gold-bearing sands are rich in gold. Ballon's first\nsamples gave uranium atoms with a fair representation of ionium and\nthorium. A richly radio-active ore. A lode of the pure radium is there\nsomewhere, without doubt.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe added vehemently, \"Do you understand now why we should be suspicious\nof this George Prince? He has a criminal record. He has a thorough\ntechnical knowledge of radium ores. He associates with Martians of bad\nreputation. A large Martian Company has recently developed a radium\nengine to compete with our Earth motor. You know that? You know that\nthere is very little radium available on Mars, and our government will\nnot allow our own radium supply to be exported. That Martian Company\nneeds radium. It will do anything to get radium. What do you suppose it\nwould pay for a few tons of really rich radio-active ore--such as\nGrantline may have found on the Moon?\"\n\n\"But,\" I objected, \"that is a reputable Martian company. It's backed by\nthe government of the Martian Union. The government of Mars would not\ndare--\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" Captain Carter exclaimed sardonically. \"Not openly! But\nif Martian brigands had a supply of radium--I don't imagine where it\ncame from would make much difference. That Martian Company would buy\nit.\"\n\nHalsey added, \"And George Prince, my agents inform me, seems to know\nthat Grantline is on the Moon. Put it all together, lads. Little sparks\nshow the hidden current.\n\n\"More than that: George Prince knows that we have arranged to have the\nPlanetara stop at the Moon and bring back Grantline's radium-ore. This\nis your last voyage this year. You'll hear from Grantline this time,\nwe're convinced. He'll probably give you the signal as you pass the Moon\non your way out. Coming back, you'll stop at the Moon and transport\nwhatever radium-ore Grantline has ready. The Grantline Flyer is too\nsmall for ore transportation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalsey's voice turned grimly sarcastic. \"Doesn't it seem queer that\nGeorge Prince and a few of his Martian friends happen to be listed as\npassengers for this voyage?\"\n\nIn the silence that followed, Snap and I regarded each other. Halsey\nadded abruptly,\n\n\"We had George Prince typed that time we arrested him four years ago.\nI'll show him to you.\"\n\nHe snapped open an alcove, and said to his waiting attendant, \"Get me\nthe type of George Prince.\"\n\nThe disc in a moment came through the pneumatic. Halsey, smiling wryly,\nadjusted it.\n\n\"A nice looking fellow. Nicely spoken. Though at the time we made this\nhe was somewhat annoyed, naturally. He is older now. Twenty-nine, to be\nexact. Here he is.\"\n\nThe image glowed on the grids before us. His name, George Prince, in\nletters illumined upon his forehead, showed for a moment and then faded.\nHe stood smiling sourly before us as he repeated the official formula:\n\n\"My name is George Prince. I was born in Great-New York City twenty-five\nyears ago.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gazed at this life-size, moving image of George Prince. He stood\nsomber in the black detention uniform. A dark, almost a girlishly\nhandsome fellow, well below medium height--the rod beside him showed\nfive feet four inches. Slim and slight. Long, wavy black hair, falling\nabout his ears. A pale, clean-cut, really handsome face, almost\nbeardless. I regarded it closely. A face that would have been femininely\nbeautiful without its masculine touch of heavy black brows and firmly\nset jaw. His voice as he spoke was low and soft; but at the end, with\nthe concluding words, \"I am innocent!\" it flashed into strong\nmasculinity. His eyes, shaded with long, girlish black lashes, by chance\nmet mine. \"I am innocent.\" His curving sensuous lips drew down into a\ngrim sneer....\n\nThe type faded at its end. Halsey replaced the disc in its box and waved\nthe attendant away. \"Thank you.\"\n\nHe turned back to Snap and me. \"Well, there he is. We have nothing\ntangible against him now. But I'll say this: he's a clever fellow, one\nto be afraid of. I would not blare it from the newscasters' microphone,\nbut if he is hatching any plot, he has been too clever for my agents.\"\n\nWe talked for another half-hour, and then Captain Carter dismissed us.\nWe left Halsey's office with Carter's final words ringing in our ears.\n\"Whatever comes, lads, remember I trust you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap and I decided to walk a portion of the way back to the ship. It was\nbarely more than a mile through this subterranean corridor to where we\ncould get the vertical lift direct to the landing stage.\n\nWe started off on the lower level. Once outside the insulation of\nHalsey's office we did not dare talk of this thing. Not only electrical\nears, but every possible eavesdropping device might be upon us. The\ncorridor was two hundred feet or more below the ground level. At this\nhour of the night this business section was comparatively deserted. The\nthrough tube sounded over our heads with the passing of its occasional\ntrains. The ventilators buzzed and whirred. At the cross intersections,\nthe traffic directors dozed at their posts. It was hot and sticky down\nhere, and gloomy with the daylight globes extinguished, and only the\nnight lights to give a dim illumination. The stores and office arcades\nwere all closed and deserted; only an occasional night-light burning\nbehind their windows.\n\nOur footfalls echoed on the metal grids as we hurried along.\n\n\"Nice evening,\" said Snap awkwardly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"isn't it?\"\n\nI felt oppressed. As though prying eyes and ears were here. We walked\nfor a time in silence, each of us busy with memory of what had\ntranspired in Halsey's office.\n\nSuddenly Snap gripped me. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Where?\" I whispered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stopped at a corner. An entryway was here. Snap pulled me into it. I\ncould feel him quivering with excitement.\n\n\"What is it?\" I demanded in a whisper.\n\n\"We're being followed. Did you hear anything?\"\n\n\"No!\" Yet I thought now I could hear something. Vague footfalls. A\nrustling. And a microscopic electrical whine, as though some device were\nnear us.\n\nSnap was fumbling in his pocket. \"Wait, I've got a pair of low-scale\nphones.\"\n\nHe put the little grids against his ears. I could hear the sharp intake\nof his breath. Then he seized me, pulled me down to the metal floor of\nthe entryway.\n\n\"Back, Gregg! Get back!\" I could barely hear his whisper. We crouched as\nfar back into the doorway as we could get. I was armed. My official\npermit for the carrying of the pencil heat-ray allowed me to have it\nalways with me. I drew it now. But there was nothing to shoot at. I felt\nSnap clamping the grids on my ears. And now I heard something! An\nintensification of the vague footsteps I had thought I heard before.\n\nThere was something following us! Something out in the corridor there\nnow! A street light was nearby. The corridor was dim, but plainly\nvisible; and to my sight it was empty. But there was something there.\nSomething invisible! I could hear it moving. Creeping towards us. I\npulled the grids off my ears.\n\nSnap murmured, \"You've got a local phone.\"\n\n\"Yes! I'll get them to give us the street glare!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pressed the danger signal, giving our location to the nearest\noperator. In a second or two we got the light. The street in all this\nneighborhood burst into a brilliant actinic glare. The thing menacing\nus was revealed! A figure in a black cloak, crouching thirty feet away\nacross the corridor.\n\nSnap was on his feet. His voice rang shrilly, \"There it is! Give it a\nshot, Gregg!\"\n\nSnap was unarmed, but he flung his hands out menacingly. The figure,\nwhich may perhaps not have been aware of our city safeguard, was taken\nwholly by surprise. A human figure. Seven feet tall, at the least, and\ntherefore, I judged, doubtless a Martian man. The black cloak covered\nhis head. He took a step toward us, hesitated, and then turned in\nconfusion.\n\nSnap's shrill voice was bringing help. The whine of a street guard's\nalarm whistle nearby sounded. The figure was making off! My pencil-ray\nwas in my hand and I pressed its switch. The tiny heat-ray stabbed\nthrough the glare, but I missed. The figure stumbled, but did not fall.\nI saw a bare gray arm come from the cloak, flung up to maintain its\nbalance. Or perhaps my pencil-ray of heat had seared the arm. The\ngray-skinned arm of a Martian.\n\nSnap was shouting, \"Give him another!\" But the figure passed beyond the\nactinic glare and vanished.\n\nWe were detained in the turmoil of the corridor for ten minutes or more\nwith official explanations. Then a message from Halsey released us. The\nMartian who had been following us in his invisible cloak was never\ncaught.\n\nWe escaped from the crowd at last and made our way back to the\nPlanetara, where the passengers were already assembling for the outward\nMartian voyage.\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"_A Fleeting Glance_--\"\n\nI stood on the turret-balcony of the Planetara with Captain Carter and\nDr. Frank, the ship surgeon, watching the arriving passengers. It was\nclose to the zero hour: the level of the stage was a turmoil of\nconfusion. The escalators, with the last of the freight aboard, were\nfolded back. But the stage was jammed with the incoming passenger\nbaggage: the interplanetary customs and tax officials with their X-ray\nand Zed-ray paraphernalia and the passengers themselves, lined up for\nthe export inspection.\n\nAt this height, the city lights lay spread in a glare of blue and yellow\nbeneath us. The individual local planes came dropping like birds to our\nstage. Thirty-eight passengers for this flight to Mars, but that\naccursed desire of every friend and relative to speed the departing\nvoyager brought a hundred or more extra people to crowd our girders and\nbring added difficulty to everybody.\n\nCarter was too absorbed in his duties to stay with us long. But here in\nthe turret Dr. Frank and I found ourselves at the moment with nothing\nmuch to do but watch.\n\n\"Think we'll get away on time, Gregg?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"And this of all voyages--\"\n\nI checked myself, with thumping heart. My thoughts were so full of what\nHalsey and Carter had told us that it was difficult to rein my tongue.\nYet here in the turret, unguarded by insulation, I could say nothing.\nNor would I have dared mention the Grantline Moon Expedition to Dr.\nFrank. I wondered what he knew of this affair. Perhaps as much as\nI--perhaps nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a thin, dark, rather smallish man of fifty, this ship's surgeon,\ntrim in his blue and white uniform. I knew him well: we had made several\nflights together. An American--I fancy of Jewish ancestry. A likable\nman, and a skillful doctor and surgeon. He and I had always been good\nfriends.\n\n\"Crowded,\" he said. \"Johnson says thirty-eight. I hope they're\nexperienced travelers. This pressure sickness is a rotten nuisance--keeps\nme dashing around all night assuring frightened women they're not\ngoing to die. Last voyage, coming out of the Venus atmosphere--\"\n\nHe plunged into a lugubrious account of his troubles with space-sick\nvoyagers. But I was in no mood to listen. My gaze was down on the spider\nincline, up which, over the bend of the ship's sleek, silvery body, the\npassengers and their friends were coming in little groups. The upper\ndeck was already jammed with them.\n\nThe Planetara, as flyers go, was not a large vessel. Cylindrical of\nbody, forty feet maximum beam, and two hundred and seventy-five feet in\noverall length. The passenger superstructure--no more than a hundred\nfeet long--was set amidships. A narrow deck, metallic-enclosed, and with\nlarge bulls-eye windows, encircled the superstructure. Some of the\ncabins opened directly onto the deck. Others had doors to the interior\ncorridors. There were half a dozen small but luxurious public rooms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest of the vessel was given to freight storage and the mechanism\nand control compartments. Forward of the passenger structure the\ndeck level continued under the cylindrical dome-roof to the bow. The\nforward watch-tower observatory was here; officers' cabins; Captain\nCarter's navigating rooms and Dr. Frank's office. Similarly, under\nthe stern-dome, was the stern watch-tower and a series of power\ncompartments.\n\nAbove the superstructure a confusion of spider bridges, ladders and\nbalconies were laced like a metal network. The turret in which Dr. Frank\nand I now stood was perched here. Fifty feet away, like a bird's nest,\nSnap's instrument room stood clinging to the metal bridge. The\ndome-roof, with the glassite windows rolled back now, rose in a\nmound-peak to cover this highest middle portion of the vessel.\n\nBelow, in the main hull, blue-lit metal corridors ran the entire length\nof the ship. Freight storage compartments; gravity control rooms; the\nair renewal systems; heater and ventilators and pressure mechanisms--all\nwere located there. And the kitchens, stewards' compartments, and the\nliving quarters of the crew. We carried a crew of sixteen, this voyage,\nexclusive of the navigating officers, and the purser, Snap Dean, and Dr.\nFrank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe passengers coming aboard seemed a fair representation of what we\nusually had for the outward voyage to Ferrok-Shahn. Most were Earth\npeople--and returning Martians. Dr. Frank pointed out one. A huge\nMartian in a gray cloak. A seven-foot fellow.\n\n\"His name is Set Miko,\" Dr. Frank remarked. \"Ever heard of him?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Should I?\"\n\n\"Well--\" The doctor suddenly checked himself, as though he were sorry he\nhad spoken.\n\n\"I never heard of him,\" I repeated slowly.\n\nAn awkward silence fell suddenly between us.\n\nThere were a few Venus passengers. I saw one of them presently coming up\nthe incline, and recognized her. A girl traveling alone. We had brought\nher from Grebhar, last voyage but one. I remembered her. An alluring\nsort of girl, as most of them are. Her name was Venza. She spoke English\nwell. A singer and dancer who had been imported to Great-New York to\nfill some theatrical engagement. She'd made quite a hit on the Great\nWhite Way.\n\nShe came up the incline, with the carrier ahead of her. Gazing up, she\nsaw Dr. Frank and me at the turret window and waved her white arm in\ngreeting. And flashed us a smile.\n\nDr. Frank laughed. \"By the gods of the airways, there's Alta Venza! You\nsaw that look, Gregg? That was for me, not you.\"\n\n\"Reasonable enough,\" I retorted. \"But I doubt it--the Venza was nothing\nif not impartial.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wondered what could be taking Venza now to Mars. I was glad to see\nher. She was diverting. Educated. Well-traveled. Spoke English with a\ncolloquial, theatrical manner more characteristic of Great-New York than\nof Venus. And for all her light banter, I would rather put my trust in\nher than any Venus girl I had ever met.\n\nThe hum of the departing siren was sounding. Friends and relatives of\nthe passengers were crowding the exit incline. The deck was clearing. I\nhad not seen George Prince come aboard. And then I thought I saw him\ndown on the landing stage, just arrived from a private tube-car. A\nsmall, slight figure. The customs men were around him: I could only see\nhis head and shoulders. Pale, girlishly handsome face; long, black hair\nto the base of his neck. He was bareheaded, with the hood of his\ntraveling-cloak pushed back.\n\nI stared, and I saw that Dr. Frank was also gazing down. But neither of\nus spoke.\n\nThen I said upon impulse, \"Suppose we go down to the deck, Doctor?\"\n\nHe acquiesced. We descended to the lower room of the turret and\nclambered down the spider ladder to the upper deck-level. The head of\nthe arriving incline was near us. Preceded by two carriers who were\nlittered with hand-baggage, George Prince was coming up the incline. He\nwas closer now. I recognized him from the type we had seen in Halsey's\noffice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, with a shock, I saw it was not so. This was a girl coming\naboard. An arch-light over the incline showed her clearly when she was\nhalf way up. A girl with her hood pushed back; her face framed in thick\nblack hair. I saw now it was not a man's cut of hair; but long braids\ncoiled up under the dangling hood.\n\nDr. Frank must have remarked my amazed expression.\n\n\"Little beauty, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nWe were standing back against the wall of the superstructure. A\npassenger was near us--the Martian whom Dr. Frank had called Miko. He\nwas loitering here, quite evidently watching this girl come aboard. But\nas I glanced at him he looked away and casually sauntered off.\n\nThe girl came up and reached the deck. \"I am in A 22,\" she told the\ncarrier. \"My brother came aboard two hours ago.\"\n\nDr. Frank answered my whisper. \"That's Anita Prince.\"\n\nShe was passing quite close to us on the deck, following the carrier,\nwhen she stumbled and very nearly fell. I was nearest to her. I leaped\nforward and caught her as she went down.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried.\n\nWith my arm about her, I raised her up and set her upon her feet again.\nShe had twisted her ankle. She balanced herself upon it. The pain of it\neased up in a moment.\n\n\"I'm--all right--thank you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the dimness of the blue-lit deck, I met her eyes. I was holding her\nwith my encircling arm. She was small and soft against me. Her face,\nframed in the thick, black hair, smiled up at me. Small, oval\nface--beautiful--yet firm of chin, and stamped with the mark of its own\nindividuality. No empty-headed beauty, this.\n\n\"I'm all right, thank you very much--\"\n\nI became conscious that I had not released her. I felt her hands pushing\nat me. And then it seemed that for an instant she yielded and was\nclinging. And I met her startled, upflung gaze. Eyes like a purple night\nwith the sheen of misty starlight in them.\n\nI heard myself murmuring, \"I beg your pardon. Yes, of course!\" I\nreleased her.\n\nShe thanked me again and followed the carrier along the deck. She was\nlimping slightly from the twisted ankle.\n\nAn instant, while she had clung to me--and I had held her. A brief flash\nof something, from her eyes to mine--from mine back to hers. The poets\nwrite that love can be born of such a glance. The first meeting, across\nall the barriers of which love springs unsought, unbidden--defiant,\nsometimes. And the troubadours of old would sing: \"A fleeting glance; a\ntouch; two wildly beating hearts--and love was born.\"\n\nI think, with Anita and me, it must have been like that....\n\nI stood gazing after her, unconscious of Dr. Frank, who was watching me\nwith his humorous smile. And presently, no more than a quarter beyond\nthe zero hour, the Planetara got away. With the dome-windows battened\ntightly, we lifted from the landing stage and soared over the glowing\ncity. The phosphorescence of the electronic tubes was like a comet's\ntail behind us as we slid upward.\n\nAt the trinight hour the heat of our atmospheric passage was over. The\npassengers had all retired. The ship was quiet, with empty decks and\ndim, silent corridors. Vibrationless, with the electronic engines cut\noff and only the hum of the Martel magnetizers to break the unnatural\nstillness. We were well beyond the earth's atmosphere, heading out in\nthe cone-path of the earth's shadow, in the direction of the moon.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_In the Helio-room_\n\nAt six A. M., earth Eastern time, which we were still carrying, Snap\nDean and I were alone in his instrument room, perched in the network\nover the Planetara's deck. The bulge of the dome enclosed us; it rounded\nlike a great observatory window some twenty feet above the ceiling of\nthis little metal cubby-hole.\n\nThe Planetara was still in the earth's shadow. The firmament--black\ninterstellar space with its blazing white, red and yellow stars--lay\nspread around us. The moon, with nearly all its disc illumined, hung, a\ngreat silver ball, over our bow quarter. Behind it, to one side, Mars\nfloated like the red tip of a smoldering cigarillo in the blackness. The\nearth, behind our stern, was dimly, redly visible--a giant sphere,\netched with the configurations of its oceans and continents. Upon one\nlimb a touch of the sunlight hung on the mountain-tops with a crescent\nred-yellow sheen.\n\nAnd then we plunged from the cone-shadow. The sun, with the leaping\nCorona, burst through the blackness behind us. The earth lighted into a\nhuge, thin crescent with hooked cusps.\n\nTo Snap and me, the glories of the heavens were too familiar to be\nremarked. And upon this voyage particularly we were in no mood to\nconsider them. I had been in the helio-room several hours. When the\nPlanetara started, and my few routine duties were over, I could think of\nnothing save Halsey's and Carter's admonition: \"Be on your guard. And\nparticularly--watch George Prince.\"\n\nI had not seen George Prince. But I had seen his sister, whom Carter and\nHalsey had not bothered to mention. My heart was still pounding with the\nmemory....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the passengers had retired and the ship quieted, I prowled through\nthe passenger corridors. This was about the trinight hour.[3] Hot as the\ncorridors of hell, with our hull and the glassite dome seething with the\nfriction of our atmospheric flight. But the refrigerators mitigated\nthat; the ventilators blasted cold air from the renewers into every\ncorner of the vessel. Within an hour or two, with the cold of space\nstriking us, it was hot air that was needed.\n\nDr. Frank evidently was having little trouble with pressure-sick\npassengers[4]--the Planetara's equalizers were fairly efficient. I did\nnot encounter Dr. Frank. I prowled through the silent metal lounges and\npassages. I went to the door of A 22. It was on the deck-level, in a\ntiny transverse passage just off the main lounging room. Its name-grid\nglowed with the letters: \"_Anita Prince._\" I stood in my short white\ntrousers and white silk shirt, like a cabin steward gawping. Anita\nPrince! I had never heard the name until this night. But there was magic\nmusic in it now, as I murmured it to myself. Anita Prince....\n\nShe was here, doubtless asleep, behind this small metal door. It seemed\nas though that little oval grid were the gateway to a fairyland of my\ndreams.\n\nI turned away. And thought of the Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at\nme. George Prince--Anita's brother--he whom I had been told to watch.\nThis renegade--associate of dubious Martians, plotting God knows what.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw, upon the adjoining door, \"A 20, _George Prince_.\" I listened. In\nthe humming stillness of the ship's interior there was no sound from\nthese cabins. A 20 was without windows, I knew. But Anita's room had a\nwindow and a door which gave upon the deck. I went through the lounge,\nout its arch, and walked the deck length. The deck door and window of\nA 22 were closed and dark.\n\nThe ten-foot-wide deck was dim with white starlight from the side ports.\nChairs were here, but they were all empty. From the bow windows of the\narching dome a flood of moonlight threw long, slanting shadows down the\ndeck. At the corner where the superstructure ended, I thought I saw a\nfigure lurking as though watching me. I went that way, but it vanished.\n\nI turned the corner, went the width of the ship to the other side. There\nwas no one in sight save the observer on his spider bridge, high in the\nbow network, and the second officer, on duty on the turret balcony\nalmost directly over me.\n\nAs I stood and listened, I suddenly heard footsteps. From the direction\nof the bow a figure came. Purser Johnson.\n\nHe greeted me. \"Cooling off, Gregg?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nHe went past me and turned into the smoking room door nearby.\n\nI stood a moment at one of the deck windows, gazing at the stars; and\nfor no reason at all I realized I was tense. Johnson was a great one for\nhis regular sleep--it was wholly unlike him to be roaming about the ship\nat such an hour. Had he been watching me? I told myself it was nonsense.\nI was suspicious of everyone, everything, this voyage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI heard another step. Captain Carter appeared from his chart-room which\nstood in the center of the narrowing open deck space near the bow. I\njoined him at once.\n\n\"Who was that?\" he half-whispered.\n\n\"Johnson.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" He fumbled in his uniform; his gaze swept the moonlit deck.\n\"Gregg--take this.\" He handed me a small metal box. I stuffed it at once\ninto my shirt.\n\n\"An insulator,\" he added, swiftly. \"Snap is in his office. Take it to\nhim, Gregg. Stay with him--you'll have a measure of security--and you\ncan help him to make the photographs.\" He was barely whispering. \"I\nwon't be with you--no use making it look as though we were doing\nanything unusual. If your graphs show anything--or if Snap picks up any\nmessage--bring it to me.\" He added aloud, \"Well, it will be cool enough\npresently, Gregg.\"\n\nHe sauntered away toward his chart-room.\n\n\"By heavens, what a relief!\" Snap murmured as the current went on. We\nhad wired his cubby with the insulator; within its barrage we could at\nlast talk with a degree of freedom.\n\n\"You've seen George Prince, Gregg?\"\n\n\"No. He's assigned A 20. But I saw his sister. Snap, no one ever\nmentioned--\"\n\nSnap had heard of her, but he hadn't known that she was listed for this\nvoyage. \"A real beauty, so I've heard. Accursed shame for a decent girl\nto have a brother like that.\"\n\nI could agree with him there, but I made no comment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was now 6 A. M. Snap had been busy all night with routine cosmo-radios\nfrom the earth, following our departure. He had a pile of them beside\nhim. Many were for the passengers; but anything that savored of a code\nwas barred.\n\n\"Nothing queer looking?\" I suggested.\n\n\"No. Not a thing.\"\n\nWe were at this time no more than some sixty-five thousand miles from\nthe moon's surface. The Planetara presently would swing upon her direct\ncourse for Mars. There was nothing which could cause passenger comment\nin this close passing of the moon; normally we used the satellite's\nattraction to give us additional starting speed.\n\nIt was now or never that a message would come from Grantline. He was\nsupposed to be upon this earthward side of the moon. While Snap had\nrushed through with his routine, I had searched the moon surface with\nour glass, as I knew Carter was searching it--and also the observer in\nhis tower, very possibly.\n\nBut there was nothing. Copernicus and Kepler lay in full sunlight. The\nheights of the lunar mountains, the depths of the barren, empty seas\nwere etched black and white, clear and clean. Grim, forbidding\ndesolation, this unchanging moon! In romance, moonlight may shimmer and\nsparkle to light a lover's smile; but the reality of the moon is cold\nand bleak. There was nothing to show my prying eyes where the intrepid\nGrantline might be.\n\n\"Nothing at all, Snap.\"\n\nAnd Snap's helio mirrors, attuned for an hour now to pick up the\nfaintest signal, were motionless.\n\n\"If he has concentrated any appreciable amount of radio-active ore,\"\nsaid Snap, \"we should get an impulse from its Gamma rays.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut our receiving shield was dark, untouched. We tried taking hydrogen\nphotographic impressions of the visible moon surface. A sequence of\nthem, with stereoscopic lenses, forty-eight to the second. Our\nmirror-grid gave the magnified images; the spectro-heliograph, with its\nwave-length selection, pictured the mountain-levels, and slowly\ndescended into the deepest seas.\n\nThere was nothing.\n\nYet in those moon caverns--a million million recesses amid the crags of\nthat tumbled, barren surface--the pin-point of movement which might have\nbeen Grantline's expedition could so easily be hiding! Could he have the\nore insulated, fearing its Gamma rays would betray its presence to\nhostile watchers?\n\nOr might disaster have come to him? Or he might not be upon this\nhemisphere of the moon at all....\n\nMy imagination, sharpened by fancy of a lurking menace which seemed\neverywhere about the Planetara this voyage, ran rife with fears for\nJohnny Grantline. He had promised to communicate this voyage. It was\nnow, or perhaps never.\n\nSix-thirty came and passed. We were well beyond the earth's shadow now.\nThe firmament blazed with its vivid glories; the sun behind us was a\nball of yellow-red leaping flames. The earth hung, opened to a huge,\ndull-red half-sphere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were within some forty thousand miles of the moon. Giant white\nball--all of its disc visible to the naked eye. It poised over the bow,\nand presently, as the Planetara swung upon her course for Mars, it\nshifted sidewise. The light of it glared white and dazzling in our tiny\nside windows.\n\nSnap, with his habitual red celluloid eyeshade shoved high on his\nforehead, worked over our instruments.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\nThe receiving shield was glowing a trifle! Gamma rays were bombarding\nit! It glowed, gleamed phosphorescent, and the audible recorder began\nsounding its tiny tinkling murmurs.\n\nGamma rays! Snap sprang to the dials. The direction and strength were\nsoon obvious. A richly radio-active ore body, of considerable size, was\nconcentrated upon this hemisphere of the moon! It was unmistakable.\n\n\"He's got it, Gregg! He's--\"\n\nThe tiny helio mirrors began quivering. Snap exclaimed triumphantly,\n\"Here he comes! By God, the message at last! Bar off that light!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flung on the absorbers. The moonlight bathing the little room went\ninto them and darkness sprang around us. Snap fumbled at his instrument\nboard. Actinic light showed dimly in the quivering, thumbnail mirrors.\nTwo of them. They hung poised on their cobweb wires, infinitely\nsensitive to the infra-red light-rays Grantline was sending from the\nmoon. The mirrors in a moment began swinging. On the scale across the\nroom the actinic beams from them were magnified into sweeps of light.\n\nThe message!\n\nSnap spelled it out, decoded it.\n\n\"_Success! Stop for ore on your return voyage. Will give you our\nlocation later. Success beyond wildest hopes--_\"\n\nThe mirrors hung motionless. The shield, where the Gamma rays were\nbombarding, went suddenly dark.\n\nSnap murmured, \"That's all. He's got the ore! 'Success beyond wildest\nhopes.' That must mean an enormous quantity of it available!\"\n\nWe were sitting in darkness, and abruptly I became aware that across our\nopen window, where the insulation barrage was flung, the air was faintly\nhissing. An interference there! I saw a tiny swirl of purple sparks.\nSomeone--some hostile ray from the deck beneath us, or from the spider\nbridge that led to our little room--someone out there trying to pry\nin!\n\nSnap impulsively reached for the absorbers to let in the outside\nlight--it was all darkness to us outside. But I checked him.\n\n\"Wait!\" I cut off our barrage, opened our door and stepped to the narrow\nmetal bridge.\n\n\"Wait, Snap! You stay there.\" I added aloud, \"Well, Snap, I'm going to\nbed. Glad you've cleaned up that batch of work.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI banged the door upon him. The lacework of metal bridges and ladders\nseemed empty. I gazed up to the dome, and forward and aft. Twenty feet\nbeneath me was the metal roof of the cabin superstructure. Below it,\nboth sides of the deck showed. All patched with moonlight.\n\nNo one visible down there. I descended a ladder. The deck was empty. But\nin the silence something was moving! Footsteps moving away from me down\nthe deck! I followed; and suddenly I was running. Chasing something I\ncould hear, but could not see. It turned into the smoking room.\n\nI burst in. And a real sound smothered the phantom. Johnson the purser\nwas sitting here alone in the dimness. He was smoking. I noticed that\nhis cigar held a long, frail ash. It could not have been him I was\nchasing. He was sitting there quite calmly. A thick-necked, heavy\nfellow, easily out of breath. But he was breathing calmly now.\n\nHe sat up with amazement at my wild-eyed appearance, and the ash jarred\nfrom his cigar.\n\n\"Gregg! What in the devil--\"\n\nI tried to grin. \"I'm on my way to bed--worked all night helping Snap\nwith those damn Earth messages.\"\n\nI went past him, out the door into the main interior corridor. It was\nthe only way the invisible prowler could have gone. But I was too late\nnow--I could hear nothing. I dashed forward into the main lounge. It\nwas empty, dim and silent, a silence broken presently by a faint\nclick--a stateroom door hastily closing. I swung and found myself in a\ntiny transverse passage. The twin doors of A 22 and A 20 were before\nme.\n\nThe invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms! I listened\nat each of the panels, but there was only silence within.\n\nThe interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward's\nsiren--the call to awaken the passengers. It startled me. I moved\nswiftly away. But as the siren shut off, in the silence I heard a soft,\nmusical voice:\n\n\"Wake up, Anita--I think that's the breakfast call.\"\n\nAnd her answer: \"All right, George. I hear it.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_A Burn on a Martian Arm_\n\nI did not appear at that morning meal. I was exhausted and drugged with\nlack of sleep. I had a moment with Snap, to tell him what had occurred.\nThen I sought out Carter. He had his little chart-room insulated. And we\nwere cautious. I told him what Snap and I had learned: the Gamma rays\nfrom the moon, proving that Grantline had concentrated a considerable\nore-body. I also told him the message from Grantline.\n\n\"We'll stop on the way back, as he directs, Gregg.\" He bent closer to\nme. \"At Ferrok-Shahn I'm going to bring back a cordon of Interplanetary\nPolice. The secret will be out, of course, when once we stop at the\nmoon. We have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as unguarded\nas it is.\"\n\nHe was very solemn. And he was grim when I told him of the invisible\neavesdropper.\n\n\"You think he overheard Grantline's message?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said.\n\n\"Who was it? You seem to feel it was George Prince?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI was convinced that the prowler had gone into A 20. When I mentioned\nthe purser, who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night,\nand again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled\npast, Carter looked startled.\n\n\"Johnson is all right, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Is he? Does he know anything about this Grantline affair?\"\n\n\"No--no,\" said the captain hastily. \"You haven't mentioned it, have\nyou?\"\n\n\"Of course I haven't. I've been wondering why Johnson didn't hear that\neavesdropper. I could hear him when I was chasing him. But Johnson sat\nperfectly unmoved and let him go by. What was he sitting there for,\nanyway, at that hour of the morning?\"\n\n\"You're too suspicious, Gregg. Overwrought. But you're right--we can't\nbe too careful. I'm going to have that Prince suite searched when I\ncatch it unoccupied. Passengers don't ordinarily travel with invisible\ncloaks. Go to bed, Gregg--you need a rest.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went to my cabin. It was located aft, on the stern deck-space, near\nthe stern watch-tower. A small metal room, with a desk, a chair and\nbunk. I made sure no one was in it. I sealed the lattice grill and the\ndoor, set the alarm trigger against any opening of them, and went to\nbed.\n\nThe siren for the mid-day meal awakened me. I had slept heavily. I felt\nrefreshed. And hungry.\n\nI found the passengers already assembled at my table when I arrived in\nthe dining salon. It was a low-vaulted metal room of blue and yellow\ntube-lights. At the sides its oval windows showed the deck, with its\nports of the dome-side, through which a vista of the starry firmament\nwas visible. We were well on our course to Mars. The moon had dwindled\nto a pin-point of light beside the crescent earth. And behind them our\nsun blazed, visually the largest orb in the heavens. It was some\nsixty-eight million miles from the earth to Mars, this voyage. A flight,\nunder ordinary circumstances, of some ten days.\n\nThere were five tables in the dining salon, each with eight seats. Snap\nand I had one of the tables. We sat at the ends, with three passengers\non each of the sides.\n\nSnap was in his seat when I arrived. He eyed me down the length of the\ntable.\n\n\"Good morning, Gregg. We missed you at breakfast. Not pressure-sick, I\nhope?\"\n\nThere were three passengers already seated at our table--all men. Snap,\nin a gay mood, introduced me.\n\n\"This is our third officer, Gregg Haljan. Big, handsome fellow, isn't\nhe? And as pleasant as he is good-looking. Gregg, this is Sero Ob\nHahn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI met the keen, dark-eyed somber gaze of a Venus man of middle age. A\nsmall, slim, graceful man, with sleek black hair. His pointed face,\naccentuated by the pointed beard, was pallid. He wore a white and purple\nrobe; upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament, a device like a star\nand cross entwined.\n\n\"I am happy to meet you, sir.\" His voice was soft and sleek.\n\n\"Ob Hahn,\" I repeated. \"I should have heard of you, no doubt. But--\"\n\nA smile plucked at his thin, gray lips. \"That is the error of mine, not\nyours. My mission is that all the universe shall hear of me.\"\n\n\"He's preaching the religion of the Venus Mystics,\" Snap explained.\n\n\"And this enlightened gentleman,\" said Ob Hahn ironically, \"has just\ntermed it fetishism. The ignorance--\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" protested the man at Ob Hahn's side. \"I mean, you seem to\nthink I intended something opprobrious. As a matter of fact--\"\n\n\"We've an argument, Gregg,\" laughed Snap. \"This is Sir Arthur Coniston,\nan English gentleman, lecturer and sky-trotter--that is, he will be a\nsky-trotter; he tells us he plans a number of voyages.\"\n\nThe tall Englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgment.\n\"My compliments, Mr. Haljan. I hope you have no strong religious\nconvictions, else we will make your table here very miserable!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument. Snap\nintroduced him as Rance Rankin. An American--a quiet, blond fellow of\nthirty-five or forty.\n\nI ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on.\n\n\"Won't make me miserable,\" said Snap. \"I love an argument. You said, Sir\nArthur?...\n\n\"I mean to say, I think I said too much. Mr. Rankin, you are more\ndiplomatic.\"\n\nRankin laughed. \"I am a magician,\" he said to me. \"A theatrical\nentertainer. I deal in tricks--how to fool an audience--\" His keen,\namused gaze was on Ob Hahn. \"This gentleman from Venus and I have too\nmuch in common to argue.\"\n\n\"A nasty one!\" the Englishman exclaimed. \"By Jove! Really, Mr. Rankin,\nyou're a bit too cruel!\"\n\nI could see we were doomed to have turbulent meals this voyage. I like\nto eat in quiet; arguing passengers always annoy me. There were still\nthree seats vacant at our table; I wondered who would occupy them. I\nsoon learned the answer--for one seat at least. Rankin said calmly:\n\n\"Where is the little Venus girl this meal?\" His glance went to the empty\nseat at my right hand. \"The Venza--wasn't that her name? She and I are\ndestined for the same theater in Ferrok-Shahn.\"\n\nSo Venza was to sit beside me. It was good news. Ten days of a religious\nargument three times a day would be intolerable. But the cheerful Venza\nwould help.\n\n\"She never eats the mid-day meal,\" said Snap. \"She's on the deck, having\norange juice. I guess it's the old gag about diet, eh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy attention wandered about the salon. Most of the seats were occupied.\nAt the captain's table I saw the objects of my search. George Prince and\nhis sister sat one on each side of the captain. I saw George Prince in\nthe life now as a man who looked hardly twenty-five. He was at this\nmoment evidently in a gay mood. His clean-cut, handsome profile, with\nits poetic dark curls, was turned toward me. There seemed little of the\nvillain about him.\n\nAnd I saw Anita Prince now as a dark-haired, black eyed little beauty,\nin feature resembling her brother very strongly. She presently finished\nher meal. She rose, with him after her. She was dressed in Earth\nfashion--white blouse and dark jacket, wide, knee-length trousers of\ngray, with a red sash her only touch of color. She went past me, flashed\nme her smile and nod.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I answered her greeting, and met George Prince's\ncasual gaze. He, too, smiled, as though to signify that his sister had\ntold him of the service I had done her. Or was his smile an ironical\nmemory of how he had eluded me this morning when I chased him?\n\nI gazed after his small, white-suited figure as he followed Anita from\nthe salon. And thinking of her, I prayed that Carter and Halsey might be\nwrong. Whatever plotting against the Grantline Expedition might be going\non, I hoped that George Prince was innocent of it. Yet I knew in my\nheart it was a futile hope. Prince had been that eavesdropper outside\nthe helio-room. I could not really doubt it. But that his sister must be\nignorant of what he was doing, I was sure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table. I\nheard Ob Hahn's silky voice:\n\n\"We passed quite close to the moon last night, Mr. Dean.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Snap. \"We did, didn't we? Always do--it's a technical\nproblem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation. Explain it to\nthem, Gregg--you're an expert.\"\n\nI waved it away with a laugh. There was a brief silence. I could not\nhelp noticing Sir Arthur Coniston's queer look, and I think I have never\nseen so keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at me. Were all these people\naware of Grantline's treasure on the moon? It suddenly seemed so. I\nwished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were\nover and we were safely at Ferrok-Shahn. Captain Carter was absolutely\nright. Coming back we would have a cordon of interplanetary police\naboard.\n\nSir Arthur broke the awkward silence. \"Magnificent sight, the moon, from\nso close a viewpoint--though I was too much afraid of pressure-sickness\nto be up to see it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had nearly finished my hasty meal when another incident shocked me.\nThe two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats. A\nMartian girl and man. The girl had the seat at my left, with the man\nbeside her. All Martians are tall. This girl was about my own\nheight--that is, six feet, two inches. The man was seven feet or more.\nBoth wore the Martian outer robe. The girl flung hers back. Her limbs\nwere encased in pseudo-mail. She looked, as all Martians like to look, a\nvery warlike Amazon. But she was a pretty girl. She smiled at me with a\nkeen-eyed, direct gaze.\n\n\"Mr. Dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome. You are.\"\n\nThey were brother and sister, these Martians. Snap introduced them as\nSet Miko and Setta Moa.[5]\n\nThis Miko was, from our Earth standards, a tremendous, brawny giant. Not\nspindly, like most Martians, this fellow, for all his seven feet of\nheight, was almost heavy-set. He wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath\nhis robe, and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed\nas gray, hairy pillars of strength. He had come into the salon with a\nswagger, his sword-ornament clanking.\n\n\"A pleasant voyage so far,\" he said to me as he started his meal. His\nvoice had the heavy, throaty rasp characteristic of the Martian. He\nspoke perfect English--both Martians and Venus people are by heritage\nextraordinary linguists. Miko and his sister Moa had a touch of Martian\naccent, worn almost away by living for some years in Great-New York.\n\nThe shock to me came within a few minutes. Miko, absorbed in attacking\nhis meal, inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm. An\ninstant only, then it dropped again to his wrist. But in that instant I\nhad seen, upon the gray flesh, a thin sear turned red. A very recent\nburn--as though a pencil-ray of heat had caught his arm.\n\nMy mind flung back. Only last night in the City Corridor, Snap and I had\nbeen followed by a Martian. I had shot at him with the heat-ray; I\nthought I had hit him on the arm. Was this the mysterious Martian who\nhad followed us from Halsey's office?\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Venza the Venus Girl_\n\nIt was shortly after that mid-day meal when I encountered Venza sitting\non the starlit deck. I had been in the bow observatory; taken my routine\ncastings of our position and worked them out. I was, I think, of the\nPlanetara's officers the most expert handler of the mathematical\nmechanical calculators. The locating of our position and charting the\ntrajectory of our course was, under ordinary circumstances, about all I\nhad to do. And it took only a few minutes each twelve hours.\n\nI had a moment with Carter in the isolation of his chart-room.\n\n\"This voyage! Gregg, I'm getting like you--too fanciful. We've a normal\ngroup of passengers, apparently; but I don't like the look of any of\nthem. That Ob Hahn, at your table--\"\n\n\"Snaky-looking fellow,\" I commented. \"He and the Englishman are great on\narguments. Did you have Prince's cabin searched?\"\n\nMy breath hung on his answer.\n\n\"Yes. Nothing unusual among his things. We searched both his room and\nhis sister's.\"\n\nI did not follow that up. Instead I told him about the burn on Miko's\nthick gray arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stared. \"I wish to the Almighty we were at Ferrok-Shahn. Gregg,\nto-night when the passengers are asleep, come here to me. Snap will be\nhere, and Dr. Frank. We can trust him.\"\n\n\"He knows about--about the Grantline treasure?\"\n\n\"Yes. And so do Balch and Blackstone.\"\n\nBalch and Blackstone were our first and second officers.\n\n\"We'll all meet here, Gregg--say about the zero hour. We must take some\nprecautions.\"\n\nHe suddenly felt he should say no more now. He dismissed me.\n\nI found Venza seated alone in a secluded corner of the starlit deck. A\nporthole, with the black heavens and the blazing stars, was before her.\nThere was an empty seat nearby.\n\n\"Hola-lo,[6] Gregg! Sit here with me. I have been wondering when you\nwould come after me.\"\n\nI sat down beside her. \"What are you doing--going to Mars, Venza? I'm\nglad to see you.\"\n\n\"Many thanks. But I am glad to see you, Gregg. So handsome a man.... Do\nyou know, from Venus to the earth and I have no doubt on all of Mars, no\nman will please me more.\"\n\n\"Glib tongue,\" I laughed. \"Born to flatter the male--every girl of your\nworld.\" And I added seriously, \"You don't answer my question? What\ntakes you to Mars?\"\n\n\"Contract. By the stars, what else? Of course, a chance to make a voyage\nwith you--\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Venza.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI enjoyed her. I gazed at her small, slim figure gracefully reclining in\nthe deck chair. Her long, gray robe parted--by design, I have no\ndoubt--to display her shapely, satin-sheathed legs. Her black hair was\ncoiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck; her carmined lips were\nparted with a mocking, alluring smile. The exotic perfume of her\nenveloped me.\n\nShe glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes.\n\n\"Be serious,\" I added.\n\n\"I am serious. Sober. Intoxicated by you, but sober.\"\n\nI said, \"What sort of a contract?\"\n\n\"A theater in Ferrok-Shahn. Good money, Gregg. I'm to be there a year.\"\nShe sat up to face me. \"There's a fellow here on the Planetara, Rance\nRankin, he calls himself. At our table--a big, good-looking blond\nAmerican. He says he is a magician. Ever hear of him?\"\n\n\"That's what he told me. No, I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"Nor did I. And I thought I had heard of everyone of any importance. He\nis listed for the same theater where I'm going. Nice sort of fellow.\"\nShe paused, and added suddenly, \"If he's a professional entertainer, I'm\na motor-oiler.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt startled me. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\nInstinctively my gaze swept the deck. An Earth woman and child and a\nsmall Venus man were in sight, but not within earshot.\n\n\"Why do you look so furtive?\" she retorted. \"Gregg, there's something\nstrange about this voyage. I'm no fool, nor you, and you know it as well\nas I do.\"\n\n\"Rance Rankin--\" I prompted.\n\nShe leaned closer toward me. \"He could fool you. But not me--I've known\ntoo many real magicians.\" She grinned. \"I challenged him to trick me.\nYou should have seen him trying to evade!\"\n\n\"Do you know Ob Hahn?\" I interrupted.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Never heard of him. But he told me plenty at\nbreakfast. By Satan, what a flow of words that devil-driver can muster!\nHe and the Englishman don't mesh very well, do they?\"\n\nShe stared at me. I had not answered her grin; my mind was too busy with\nqueer fancies. Halsey's words: \"Things are not always what they seem--\"\nWere these passengers masqueraders? Put here by George Prince? And then\nI thought of Miko the Martian, and the burn upon his arm.\n\n\"Come back, Gregg! Don't go wandering off like that!\" She dropped her\nvoice to a whisper. \"I'll be serious. I want to know what in the hell is\ngoing on aboard this ship. I'm a woman, and I'm curious. You tell me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I parried.\n\n\"I mean a lot of things. What we've just been talking about. And what\nwas the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning?\"\n\n\"Excitement?\"\n\n\"Gregg, you may trust me.\" For the first time she was wholly serious.\nHer gaze made sure no one was within hearing. She put her hand on my\narm. I could barely hear her whisper: \"I know they might have a ray upon\nus--I'll be careful.\"\n\n\"They?\"\n\n\"Anyone. Something's going on. You know it--you are in it. I saw you\nthis morning, Gregg. Wild-eyed, chasing a phantom--\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"And I heard the phantom! A man's footsteps. A magnetic reflecting\ninvisible cloak. You couldn't fool an audience with that--it's too\ncommonplace. If Rance Rankin tried--\"\n\nI gripped her. \"Don't ramble, Venza! You saw me?\"\n\n\"Yes. My stateroom door was open. I was sitting with a cigarillo. I saw\nthe purser in the smoking room. He was visible from--\"\n\n\"Wait! Venza, that prowler went through the smoking room!\"\n\n\"I know he did. I could hear him.\"\n\n\"Did the purser hear him?\"\n\n\"Of course. The purser looked up, followed the sound with his gaze. I\nthought that was queer. He never made a move. And then you came along\nand he acted innocent. Why? What's going on, that's what I want to\nknow!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI held my breath. \"Venza, where did the prowler run to? Can you--\"\n\nShe whispered calmly, \"Into A 20. I saw the door open and close--I even\nthink I could see the blurred outline of him. Those magnetic cloaks!\"\nShe added, \"Why should George Prince be sneaking around with you after\nhim? And the purser acting innocent? And who is this George Prince,\nanyway?\"\n\nThe huge Martian, Miko, with his sister Moa came strolling along the\ndeck. They nodded as they passed us.\n\nI whispered, \"I can't explain anything now. But you're right, Venza:\nthere is something going on. Listen! Whatever you learn--anything you\nencounter which looks unusual--will you tell me? I--well, I do trust\nyou--really I do!--but the thing isn't mine to tell.\"\n\nThe somber pools of her eyes were shining. \"You are very lovable, Gregg.\nI won't question you.\" She was trembling with excitement. \"Whatever it\nis, I want to be in it. Here's something I can tell you now. We've two\nhigh-class gold-leaf gamblers aboard. Did you know that?\"\n\n\"No. Who are--\"\n\n\"Shac and Dud Ardley. Let me state every detective in Great-New York\nknows them. They had a wonderful game with that Englishman, Sir Arthur\nConiston, this morning. Stripped him of half a pound of eight-inch\nleaves--a neat little stack. A crooked game, of course. Those fellows\nare more nimble-fingered than Rance Rankin ever dared to be!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat staring at her. She was a mine of information, this girl.\n\n\"And Gregg, I tried my charms on Shac and Dud. Nice men, but dumb.\nWhatever's going on, they're not in it. They wanted to know what kind of\na ship this was. Why? Because Shac has a cute little eavesdropping\nmicrophone of his own. He had it working in the night last night. He\noverheard George Prince and that big giant Miko arguing about the\nmoon!\"\n\nI gasped. \"Venza, softer!\"\n\nAgainst all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself\nupon me. Her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear.\n\n\"Something about treasure on the moon--Shac couldn't understand what.\nAnd they mentioned you. He didn't hear what they said because the purser\njoined them.\" Her whispered words tumbled over one another. \"A hundred\npounds of gold leaf--that's the purser's price. He's with them, whatever\nit is. He promised to do something for them.\"\n\nShe stopped. \"Well?\" I prompted.\n\n\"That's all. Shac's current was interrupted.\"\n\n\"Tell him to try it again, Venza! I'll talk with him. No! I'd better let\nhim alone. Can you get him to keep his mouth shut?\"\n\n\"I think he might do anything I told him. He's a man.\"\n\n\"Find out what you can.\"\n\nShe sat away from me suddenly. \"There's Anita and George Prince.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came to the corner of the deck, but turned back. Venza caught my\nlook. And understood it.\n\n\"So you love Anita Prince so much as that, Gregg?\" Venza was smiling. \"I\nwish you--I wish some man handsome as you would gaze after me like\nthat.\"\n\nShe turned solemn. \"You may be interested to know that she loves you. I\ncould see it. I knew it when I mentioned you to her this morning.\"\n\n\"Me? Why, we've hardly spoken!\"\n\n\"Is it necessary? I never heard that it was.\"\n\nI could not see Venza's face; she stood up suddenly. And when I rose\nbeside her, she whispered,\n\n\"We should not be seen talking so long. I'll find out what I can.\"\n\nI stared after her slight robed figure as she turned into the lounge\narchway and vanished.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_A Traitor, and a Passing Asteroid_\n\nCaptain Carter was grim. \"So they've bought him off, have they? Go bring\nhim in here, Gregg. We'll have it out with him now.\"\n\nSnap, Dr. Frank, Balch, our first officer, and I were in the captain's\nchart-room. It was 4 P. M.--our Earth starting time. We were sixteen\nhours upon our voyage.\n\nI found Johnson in his office in the lounge. \"Captain wants to see you.\nClose up.\"\n\nHe closed his window upon an American woman passenger who was demanding\ndetails of Martian currency, and followed me forward. \"What is it,\nGregg?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nCaptain Carter banged the slide upon us. The chart-room was insulated.\nThe hum of the current was obvious. Johnson noticed it. He started at\nthe hostile faces of the surgeon and Balch. And he tried to bluster.\n\n\"What is this? Something wrong?\"\n\nCarter wasted no words. \"We have information, Johnson--there's some\nunder cover plot here aboard. I want to know what it is. Suppose you\ntell us frankly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe purser looked blank. \"What do you mean? We've gamblers aboard, if\nthat's--\"\n\n\"To hell with that,\" growled Balch. \"You had a secret interview with\nthat Martian, Set Miko, and with George Prince!\"\n\nJohnson scowled from under his heavy brows, and then raised them in\nsurprise.\n\n\"Did I? You mean changing their money? I don't like your tone, Balch.\nI'm not your under-officer!\"\n\n\"But you're under me,\" roared the captain. \"By God, I'm master here!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not disputing that,\" said the purser mildly. \"This fellow\nBalch--\"\n\n\"We're in no mood for argument,\" Dr. Frank cut in. \"Clouding the\nissue.\"\n\n\"I won't let it be clouded,\" the captain exclaimed. I had never seen\nCarter so choleric. He was evidently under a tremendous strain. He\nadded,\n\n\"Johnson, you've been acting suspiciously. I don't give a damn whether\nI've proof of it or not--I say it. Did you, or did you not meet George\nPrince and that Martian last night?\"\n\n\"No, I did not. And I don't mind telling you, Captain Carter, that your\ntone also is offensive!\"\n\n\"Is it?\" Carter suddenly seized him. They were both big men. Johnson's\nheavy face went purplish red.\n\n\"Take your hands!--\" They were struggling. Carter's hands were fumbling\nat the purser's pockets. I leaped, flung an arm around Johnson's neck,\npinning him.\n\n\"Easy there! We've got you, Johnson!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap tried to help me. \"Go on, bang him on the head, Gregg. Now's your\nchance!\"\n\nWe searched him. A heat-ray cylinder--that was legitimate. But we found\na small battery and eavesdropping microphone similar to the one Venza\nhad mentioned that Shac the gambler was carrying.\n\n\"What are you doing with that?\" the captain demanded.\n\n\"None of your business! Is it criminal? Carter, I'll have the Line\nofficials dismiss you for this! Take your hands off me, all of you!\"\n\n\"Look at this!\" exclaimed Dr. Frank.\n\nFrom Johnson's breast pocket the surgeon drew a folded document. It was\nthe scale drawing of the Planetara's interior corridors, the lower\ncontrol rooms and mechanisms. It was always kept in Johnson's safe. And\nwith it, another document: the ship's clearance papers--the secret code\npass-words for this voyage, to be used if we should be challenged by any\ninterplanetary police ship.\n\nSnap gasped. \"My God, that was in my helio-room strong box! I'm the only\none on this vessel except the captain who's entitled to know those\npass-words!\"\n\nOut of the silence, Balch demanded, \"Well, what about it, Johnson?\"\n\nThe purser was still defiant. \"I won't answer your questions, Balch. At\nthe proper time, I'll explain--Gregg Haljan, you're choking me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI eased up. But I shook him. \"You'd better talk.\"\n\nHe was exasperatingly silent.\n\n\"Enough!\" exploded Carter. \"He can explain when we get to port.\nMeanwhile I'll put him where he'll do no more damage. Gregg, lock him in\nthe cage.\"\n\nWe ignored his violent protestations. The cage--in the old days of\nsea-vessels on Earth, they called it the brig--was the ship's jail. A\nsteel-lined, windowless room located under the deck in the peak of the\nbow. I dragged the struggling Johnson there, with the amazed watcher\nlooking down from the observatory window at our lunging, starlit forms.\n\n\"Shut up, Johnson! If you know what's good for you--\"\n\nHe was making a fearful commotion. Behind us, where the deck narrowed at\nthe superstructure, half a dozen passengers were gazing in surprise.\n\n\"I'll have you thrown out of the Service, Gregg Haljan!\"\n\nI shut him up finally. And flung him down the ladder into the cage and\nsealed the deck trap-door upon him. I was headed back for the chart-room\nwhen from the observatory came the lookout's voice.\n\n\"An asteroid, Haljan! Officer Blackstone wants you.\"\n\nI hurried to the turret bridge. An asteroid was in sight. We had\nattained nearly our maximum speed now. An asteroid was approaching, so\ndangerously close that our trajectory would have to be altered. I heard\nBlackstone's signals ringing in the control rooms; and met Carter as he\nran to the bridge with me.\n\n\"That scoundrel! We'll get more out of him, Gregg. By God, I'll put the\nchemicals on him--torture him, illegal or not!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had no time for further discussion. The asteroid was rapidly\napproaching. Already, under the glass, it was a magnificent sight. I had\nnever seen this tiny world before--asteroids are not numerous between\nthe Earth and Mars, or in toward Venus. I never expected to see this one\nagain. How little of the future can we humans fathom, for all our\nscience! If I could only have looked into the future, even for a few\nshort hours! How different then would have been the outcome of this\ntragic voyage!\n\nThe asteroid came rushing at us. Its orbital velocity, I later computed,\nwas some twenty-two miles a second. Our own, at the present maximum, was\na fraction over seventy-seven. The asteroid had for some time been under\nobservation by the lookout. He gave his warning only when it seemed that\nour trajectory should be altered to avoid a dangerously close passing.\n\nAt the combined speeds of nearly a hundred miles a second the asteroid\nswept into view. With the naked eye, at first it was a tiny speck of\nstar-dust, unnoticed in the gem-strewn black velvet of Space. A speck.\nThen a gleaming dot, silver white, with the light of our Sun upon it.\n\nFive minutes. The dot grew to a disc. Expanding. A full moon,\nsilver-white. Brightest world in the firmament--the light from it bathed\nthe Planetara, illumined the deck, painting everything with silver.\n\nI stood with Carter and Blackstone on the turret bridge. It was obvious\nthat unless we altered our course, the asteroid would pass too close for\nsafety. Already we were feeling its attraction; from the control rooms\ncame the report that our trajectory was disturbed by this new mass so\nnear.\n\n\"Better make your calculations now, Gregg,\" Blackstone suggested.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cast up the rough elements from the observational instruments in the\nturret. It took me some ten or fifteen minutes. When I had us upon our\nnew course, with the attractive and repulsive plates in the Planetara's\nhull set in their altered combinations, I went out to the bridge again.\n\nThe asteroid hung over our bow quarter. No more than twenty or thirty\nthousand miles away. A giant ball now, filling all that quadrant of the\nheavens. The configurations of its mountains--its land and water\nareas--were plainly visible. Its axial rotation was apparent.\n\n\"Perfectly habitable,\" Blackstone said. \"But I've searched all over this\nhemisphere with the glass. No sign of human life--certainly nothing\ncivilized--nothing in the fashion of cities.\"\n\nA fair little world, by the look of it. A tiny globe: Blackstone had\nfigured it at some eight hundred miles in diameter. There seemed a\nnormal atmosphere. We could see areas where the surface was obscured by\nclouds. And oceans, and land masses. Polar icecaps. Lush vegetation at\nits equator.\n\nBlackstone had roughly cast its orbital elements. A narrow ellipse. No\nwonder we had never encountered this fair little world before. It had\ncome from the outer region beyond Neptune. At perihelion it would reach\ninside Mercury, round the Sun, and head outward again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe swept past the asteroid at a distance of some six thousand miles.\nClose enough, in very truth--a minute of flight at our combined speeds\ntotaling a hundred miles a second. I had descended to the passenger\ndeck, where I stood alone at a window, gazing.\n\nThe passengers were all gathered to view the passing little world. I\nsaw, not far from me, Anita, standing with her brother; and the giant\nfigure of Miko with them.\n\nHalf an hour since, first with the naked eye, this wandering little\nworld had shown itself; it swam slowly past, began to dwindle behind us.\nA huge half moon. A thinner, smaller quadrant. A tiny crescent, like a\nsilver bar-pin to adorn some lady's breast. And then it was a dot, a\npoint of light indistinguishable among the myriad others hovering in\nthis great black void.\n\nThe incident of the passing of the asteroid was over. I turned from the\ndeck window. My heart leaped. The moment for which all day I had been\nsubconsciously longing was at hand. Anita was sitting in a deck chair,\nmomentarily alone. Her gaze was on me as I looked her way, and she\nsmiled an invitation for me to join her.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Unspoken Love_\n\nUnspoken love! I think if I had yielded to the impulse of my heart, I\nwould have poured out all those protestations of a lover's ecstasy,\nincongruous here upon this starlit public deck, to a girl I hardly knew.\nI think, too, she might have received them with a tender acquiescence.\nThe starlight was mirrored in her dark eyes. Misty eyes, with great\nreaches of unfathomable space in their depths. Yet I felt their\ntenderness.\n\nUnfathomable strangeness of love! Who am I to write of it, with all the\npoets of all the ages striving to express the unexpressible? A bond,\nstrangely fashioned by nature, between me and this little dark-haired\nEarth beauty. As though marked by the stars we were destined to be\nlovers....\n\nThus ran the romance of my unspoken thoughts. But I was sitting quietly\nin the deck chair, striving to regard her gentle beauty impersonally.\nAnd saying:\n\n\"But Miss Prince, why are you and your brother going to Ferrok-Shahn?\nHis business--\"\n\nEven as I voiced it, I hated myself for such a question. So nimble is\nthe human mind that mingled with my rhapsodies of love was my need for\ninformation of George Prince....\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"this is pleasure, not business, for George.\" It seemed\nto me that a shadow crossed her expressive face. But it was gone in an\ninstant, and she smiled. \"We have always wanted to travel. We are alone\nin the world, you know--our parents died when we were children.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI filled in her pause. \"You will like Mars--so many interesting things\nto see.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, I understand so. Our Earth is so much the same all\nover, cast all in one mould.\"\n\n\"But a hundred or two hundred years ago it was not, Miss Prince. I have\nread how the picturesque Orient, differing from--well, Great-New York,\nor London, for instance--\"\n\n\"Transportation did that,\" she interrupted eagerly. \"Made everything the\nsame--the people all look alike--dress alike.\"\n\nWe discussed it. She had an alert, eager mind, childlike with its\ncuriosity, yet strangely matured. And her manner was na\u00efvely earnest.\nYet this was no clinging vine, this little Anita Prince. There was a\nfirmness, a hint of masculine strength in her chin, and in her manner.\n\n\"If I were a man, what wonders I could achieve in this marvelous age!\"\nHer sense of humor made her laugh at herself. \"Easy for a girl to say\nthat,\" she added.\n\n\"You have greater wonders to achieve, Miss Prince,\" I said impulsively.\n\n\"Yes? What are they?\" She had a very frank and level gaze, devoid of\ncoquetry.\n\nMy heart was pounding. \"The wonders of the next generation. A little\nson, cast in your own gentle image--\"\n\nWhat madness, this clumsy brash talk! I choked it off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut she took no offense. The dark rose-petals of her cheeks were mantled\ndeeper red, but she laughed.\n\n\"That is true.\" She turned abruptly serious. \"I should not laugh. The\nwonders of the next generation--conquering humans marching on....\" Her\nvoice trailed away. My hand went to her arm. Strange tingling something\nwhich poets call love! It burned and surged from my trembling fingers\ninto the flesh of her forearm.\n\nThe starlight glowed in her eyes. She seemed to be gazing, not at the\nsilver-lit deck, but away into distant reaches of the future. And she\nmurmured:\n\n\"A little son, cast in my own gentle image. But with the strength of his\nfather....\"\n\nOur moment. Just a breathless moment given us as we sat there with my\nhand burning her arm, as though we both might be seeing ourselves joined\nin a new individual--a little son, cast in his mother's gentle image and\nwith the strength of his father. Our moment, and then it was over. A\nstep sounded. I sat back. The giant gray figure of Miko came past, his\ngreat cloak swaying, with his clanking sword-ornament beneath it. His\nbullet head, with its close-clipped hair, was hatless. He gazed at us,\nswaggered past, and turned the deck corner.\n\nOur moment was gone. Anita said conventionally, \"It has been pleasant to\ntalk with you, Mr. Haljan.\"\n\n\"But we'll have many more,\" I said. \"Ten days--\"\n\n\"You think we'll reach Ferrok-Shahn on schedule?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think so.... As I was saying, Miss Prince, you'll enjoy Mars. A\nstrange, aggressively forward-looking people.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn oppression seemed on her. She stirred in her chair.\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" she said vaguely. \"My brother and I know many Martians\nin Great-New York.\" She checked herself abruptly. Was she sorry she had\nsaid that? It seemed so.\n\nMiko was coming back. He stopped this time before us.\n\n\"Your brother would see you, Anita. He sent me to bring you to his\nroom.\"\n\nThe glance he shot me had a touch of insolence. I stood up, and he\ntowered a head over me.\n\nAnita said, \"Oh yes. I'll come.\"\n\nI bowed. \"I will see you again, Miss Prince. I thank you for a pleasant\nhalf-hour.\"\n\nThe Martian led her away. Her little figure was like a child with a\ngiant. It seemed, as they passed the length of the deck with me staring\nafter them, that he took her arm roughly. And that she shrank from him\nin fear.\n\nAnd they did not go inside. As though to show me that he had merely\ntaken her from me, he stopped at a distant deck window and stood talking\nto her. Once he picked her up as one would pick up a child to show it\nsome distant object through the window.\n\n\"A little son with the strength of his father....\" Her words echoed in\nmy mind. Was Anita afraid of this Martian's wooing? Yet held to him by\nsome power he might have over her brother? The vagrant thought struck\nme.\n\nWas it that?\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_A Scream in the Night_\n\nWe kept, on the Planetara, always the time and routine of our port of\ndeparture. The rest of that afternoon and evening were a blank of\nconfusion to me. Anita's words; the touch of my hand upon her arm; that\nvast realm of what might be for us, like a glimpse of a magic land of\nhappiness which I had seen in her eyes, and perhaps she had seen in\nmine--all this surged within me.\n\nI wandered about the vessel. I was not hungry. I did not go to the\ndining salon for dinner. I carried Johnson food and water to his cage;\nand sat, with my heat-cylinder upon him, listening to his threats of\nwhat would happen when he could complain to the Line's higher\nofficials.\n\nBut what was Johnson doing carrying a plan of the ship's control rooms\nin his pockets? And worse: How had he dared open Snap's box in the\nhelio-room and abstract the code pass-words for this voyage? Without\nthem we would be an outlawed vessel, subject to arrest if any patrol\nhailed us. Had Johnson been planning to sell those pass-words to Miko? I\nthought so. I tried to get the confession out of him, but could not.\n\nI had a brief consultation with Captain Carter. He was genuinely\napprehensive now. The Planetara carried no long-range guns, and very few\nside-arms. A half-dozen of the heat-ray hand projectors; a few\nold-fashioned weapons of explosion-rifles and automatic revolvers. And\nhand projectors with the new Benson curve-light. We had models of this\nfor curved vision, so that one might see around a corner, so to speak.\nAnd with them, we could project the heat-ray in a curve as well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe weapons were all in Carter's chart-room, save the few we officers\nalways carried. Carter was apprehensive, but of what he could not say.\nHe had not thought that our plan to stop at the Moon for treasure could\naffect this outward voyage. Any danger would be upon the way back, when\nthe Planetara would be adequately guarded with long-range electronic\nguns, and manned with police-soldiers.\n\nBut now we were practically defenseless....\n\nI had a moment with Venza, but she had nothing new to communicate to\nme.\n\nAnd for half an hour I chatted with George Prince. He seemed a gay,\npleasant young man. I could almost have fancied I liked him. Or was it\nbecause he was Anita's brother? He told me how he looked forward to\ntraveling with her on Mars. No, he had never been there before, he\nsaid.\n\nHe had a measure of Anita's earnest na\u00efve personality. Or was he a very\nclever scoundrel, with irony lurking in his soft voice, and a chuckle\nthat he could so befool me?\n\n\"We'll talk again, Haljan. You interest me--I've enjoyed it.\"\n\nHe sauntered away from me, joining the saturnine Ob Hahn, with whom\npresently I heard him discussing religion.\n\nThe arrest of Johnson had caused considerable comment among the\npassengers. A few had seen me drag him forward to the cage. The incident\nhad been the subject of passenger discussion all afternoon. Captain\nCarter had posted a notice to the effect that Johnson's accounts had\nbeen found in serious error, and that Dr. Frank for this voyage would\nact in his stead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the helio-room\nand started for the chart-room, where we were to meet with Captain\nCarter and the other officers. The passengers had nearly all retired. A\ngame was in progress in the smoking room, but the deck was almost\ndeserted.\n\nSnap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors. The\nstateroom doors, with the illumined names of the passengers, were all\nclosed. The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps. Snap was in\nadvance of me. His body suddenly rose in the air. He went like a balloon\nto the ceiling, struck it gently, and all in a heap came floating down\nand landed on the floor!\n\n\"What in the infernal!--\"\n\nHe was laughing as he picked himself up. But it was a brief laugh. We\nknew what had happened: the artificial gravity-controls in the base of\nthe ship, which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard, were being\ntampered with! For just this instant, this particular small section of\nthis corridor had been cut off. The slight bulk of the Planetara,\nfloating in space, had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap's body, and\nthe impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the\ncorridor had thrown him to the ceiling. The area was normal now. Snap\nand I tested it gingerly.\n\nHe gripped me. \"That never went wrong by accident, Gregg! Someone down\nthere--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe rushed to the nearest descending ladder. In the deserted lower room\nthe bank of dials stood neglected. A score of dials and switches were\nhere, governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship. There\nshould have been a night operator, but he was gone.\n\nThen we saw him lying nearby, sprawled face down on the floor! In the\nsilence and dim lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes, we stood holding\nour breaths, peering and listening. No one here.\n\nThe guard was not dead. He lay unconscious from a blow on the head. A\nbrawny fellow. We had him revived in a few moments. A broadcast flash of\nthe call-buzz brought Dr. Frank in haste from the chart-room.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\nWe pointed at the unconscious man. \"Someone was here,\" I said hastily.\n\"Experimenting with the magnetic switches. Evidently unfamiliar with\nthem--pulling one or another to test their workings and so see the\nreactions on the dials.\"\n\nWe told him what had happened to Snap in the upper corridor.\n\nDr. Frank revived the guard in a moment. He was no worse off for the\nepisode, save a lump on his head, and a nasty headache.\n\nBut he had little to tell us. He had heard a step. Saw nothing--and\nthen had been struck on the head, by some invisible assailant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe left him nursing his head, sitting belligerent at his post. Armed now\nwith my heat-ray cylinder which I loaned him.\n\n\"Strange doings this voyage,\" he told us. \"All the crew knows it--all\nbeen talkin' about it. I stick it out now, but when we get back home I'm\ndone with this star travelin'. I belong on the sea anyway. A good old\nfreighter is all right for me.\"\n\nWe hurried back to the upper level. We would indeed have to plan\nsomething at this chart-room conference. This was the first tangible\nattack our adversaries had made.\n\nWe were on the passenger deck headed for the chart-room when all three\nof us stopped short, frozen with horror. Through the silent passenger\nquarters a scream rang out! A girl's shuddering, gasping scream. Terror\nin it. Horror. Or a scream of agony. In the silence of the dully\nvibrating ship it was utterly horrible. It lasted an instant--a single\nlong scream; then was abruptly stilled.\n\nAnd with blood pounding my temples and rushing like ice through my\nveins, I recognized it.\n\nAnita!\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Murder in A 22_\n\n\"Good God, what was that?\" Dr. Frank's face had gone white in the\nstarlight. Snap stood like a statue of horror.\n\nThe deck here was patched as always, silver radiance from the deck\nports. The empty deck chairs stood about. The scream was stilled, but\nnow we heard a commotion inside--the rasp of opening cabin doors;\nquestions from frightened passengers; the scurry of feet.\n\nI found my voice. \"Anita! Anita Prince!\"\n\n\"Come on!\" shouted Snap. \"Was it the Prince girl? I thought so too! In\nher stateroom, A 22!\" He was dashing for the lounge archway.\n\nDr. Frank and I followed. I realized that we passed the deck door and\nwindow of A 22. But they were dark, and evidently sealed on the inside.\nThe dim lounge was in a turmoil; passengers standing at their cabin\ndoors. I heard Sir Arthur Coniston:\n\n\"I say, what was that?\"\n\n\"Over there,\" said another man. \"Come back inside, Martha.\" He shoved\nhis wife back. \"Mr. Haljan!\" He plucked at me as I went past.\n\nI shouted, \"Go back to your rooms! We want order here--keep back!\"\n\nWe came to the twin doors of A 22 and A 20. Both were closed. Dr. Frank\nwas in advance of Snap and me. He paused at the sound of Captain\nCarter's voice behind us.\n\n\"Was it from in there? Wait a moment!\"\n\nCarter dashed up; he had a large heat-ray projector in his hand. He\nshoved us aside. \"Let me in first. Is the door sealed? Gregg, keep those\npassengers back!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door was not sealed. Carter burst into the room. I heard him gasp,\n\"Good God!\"\n\nSnap and I shoved back three or four crowding passengers, and in that\ninstant Dr. Frank had been in the room and out again.\n\n\"There's been an accident! Get back, Gregg! Snap, help him keep the\ncrowd away.\" He shoved me forcibly.\n\nFrom within, Carter was shouting, \"Keep them out! Where are you, Frank?\nCome back here! Send a flash for Balch--I want Balch!\"\n\nDr. Frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon Snap\nand me. I was unarmed--I had loaned my cylinder to the guard in the\nlower corridor. Weapon in hand, Snap forced the panic-stricken\npassengers back to their rooms.\n\n\"It's all right! An accident! Miss Prince is hurt.\"\n\nSnap reassured them glibly; but he knew no more about it than I. Moa,\nwith a night-robe drawn tight around her thin, tall figure, edged up to\nme.\n\n\"What has happened, Set Haljan?\"\n\nI gazed around for her brother Miko, but did not see him.\n\n\"An accident,\" I said shortly. \"Go back to your room. Captain's\norders.\"\n\nShe eyed me and then retreated. Snap was threatening everybody with his\ncylinder. Balch dashed up. \"What in the hell? Where's Carter?\"\n\n\"In there.\" I pounded on A 22. It opened cautiously. I could see only\nCarter, but I heard the murmuring voice of Dr. Frank through the\ninterior connecting door to A 20.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe captain rasped, \"Get out, Haljan! Oh, is that you, Balch? Come in.\"\nHe admitted the older officer and slammed the door again upon me. And\nimmediately reopened it.\n\n\"Gregg, keep the passengers quiet. Tell them everything's all right.\nMiss Prince got frightened, that's all. Then go up to the turret. Tell\nBlackstone what's happened.\"\n\n\"But I don't know what's happened,\" I protested miserably.\n\nCarter was grim and white. He whispered, \"I think it may turn out to be\nmurder, Gregg! No, not dead yet--Dr. Frank is trying--Don't stand there\nlike an ass, man! Get to the turret! Verify our trajectory--no--wait--\"\n\nThe captain was almost incoherent. \"Wait a minute, I don't mean that!\nTell Snap to watch his helio-room. Gregg, you and Blackstone stay in the\nchart-room. Arm yourselves and guard our weapons. By God, this murderer,\nwhoever he is--\"\n\nI stammered, \"If--if she dies--will you flash us word?\"\n\nHe stared at me strangely. \"I'll be there presently, Gregg.\"\n\nHe slammed the door upon me.\n\nI followed his orders, but it was like a dream of horror. The turmoil of\nthe ship gradually quieted. Snap went to the helio-room; Blackstone and\nI sat in the tiny steel chart-room. How much time passed, I do not\nknow. I was confused. Anita hurt! She might die.... Murdered.... But\nwhy? By whom? Had George Prince been in his own room when the attack\ncame? I thought now I recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in\nthere with Dr. Frank and Carter.\n\nWhere was Miko? It stabbed at me. I had not seen him among the\npassengers in the lounge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarter came into the chart-room. \"Gregg, you get to bed--you look like a\nghost!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"She's not dead--she may live. Dr. Frank and her brother are with her.\nThey're doing all they can.\" He told us what had happened. Anita and\nGeorge Prince had both been asleep, each in their respective rooms.\nSomeone unknown had opened Anita's corridor door.\n\n\"Wasn't it sealed?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yes. But the intruder opened it.\"\n\n\"Burst it? I didn't think it was broken.\"\n\n\"It wasn't broken. The assailant opened it somehow, and assaulted Miss\nPrince--shot her in the chest with a heat-ray. Her left lung.\"\n\n\"She is conscious?\" Balch demanded.\n\n\"Yes. But she did not see who did it. Nor did Prince. Her scream\nawakened him, but the intruder evidently fled out the corridor door of\nA 22, the way he entered.\"\n\nI stood weak and shaken at the chart-room entrance. \"A little son, cast\nin the gentle image of his mother. But with the strength of his\nfather....\" But Anita--dying, perhaps; and all my dreams were fading\ninto a memory of what might have been.\n\n\"You go to bed, Gregg--we don't need you.\"\n\nI was glad enough to get away. I would lie down for an hour, and then go\nto Anita's stateroom. I'd demand that Dr. Frank let me see her, if only\nfor a moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went to the stern deck-space where my cubby was located. My mind was\nconfused, but some instinct within me made me verify the seals of my\ndoor and window. They were intact. I entered cautiously, switched on the\ndimmer of the tube-lights, and searched the room. It had only a bunk, my\ntiny desk, a chair and clothes robe.\n\nThere was no evidence of any intruder here. I set my door and window\nalarm. Then I audiphoned to the helio-room.\n\n\"Snap?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI told him about Anita. Carter cut in on us from the chart-room. \"Stop\nthat, you fools!\"\n\nWe cut off. Fully dressed, I flung myself on my bed. Anita might\ndie....\n\nI must have fallen into a tortured sleep. I was awakened by the sound of\nmy alarm buzzer. Someone was tampering with my door! Then the buzzer\nceased; the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it. But\nit had done its work--awakened me.\n\nI had switched off the light; my cubby was Stygian dark. A heat-cylinder\nwas in the bunk-bracket over my head; I searched for it, pried it loose\nsoftly.\n\nI was fully awake. Alert. I could hear a faint sizzling--someone outside\ntrying to unseal the door. In the darkness, cylinder in hand, I crept\nfrom the bunk. Crouched at the door. This time I would capture or kill\nthis night prowler.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sizzling was faintly audible. My door-seal was breaking. Upon\nimpulse I reached for the door, jerked it open.\n\nNo one there! The starlit segment of deck was empty. But I had leaped,\nand I struck a solid body, crouching in the doorway. A giant man. Miko!\n\nHis electronized metallic robe burned my hands. I lunged against him--I\nwas almost as surprised as he. I shot, but the stab of heat evidently\nmissed him.\n\nThe shock of my encounter close-circuited his robe; he materialized in\nthe starlight. A brief, savage encounter. He struck the weapon from my\nhand. He had dropped his hydrogen torch, and tried to grip me. But I\ntwisted away from his hold.\n\n\"So it's you!\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Gregg Haljan! I only want to talk.\"\n\nWithout warning, a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand. It\ncaught me. Ran like ice through my veins. Seized and numbed my limbs.\n\nI fell helpless to the deck. Nerves and muscles paralyzed. My tongue was\nthick and inert. I could not speak, nor move. But I could see Miko\nbending over me. And hear him:\n\n\"I don't want to kill you, Haljan. We need you.\"\n\nHe gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms; carried me swiftly\nacross the deserted deck.\n\nSnap's helio-room in the network under the dome was diagonally overhead.\nA white actinic light shot from it--caught us, bathed us. Snap had been\nawake; had heard the slight commotion of our encounter.\n\nHis voice rang shrilly: \"Stop! I'll shoot!\" His warning siren rang out\nto arouse the ship. His spotlight clung to us.\n\nMiko ran with me a few steps. Then he cursed and dropped me, fled away.\nI fell like a sack of carbide to the deck. My senses faded into\nblackness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He's all right now.\"\n\nI was in the chart-room, with Captain Carter, Snap and Dr. Frank bending\nover me. The surgeon said,\n\n\"Can you speak now, Gregg?\"\n\nI tried it. My tongue was thick, but it would move. \"Yes.\"\n\nI was soon revived. I sat up, with Dr. Frank vigorously rubbing me.\n\n\"I'm all right.\" I told them what had happened.\n\nCaptain Carter said abruptly, \"Yes, we know that. And it was Miko also\nwho killed Anita Prince. She told us before she died.\"\n\n\"Died!...\" I leaped to my feet. \"She ... died....\"\n\n\"Yes, Gregg. An hour ago, Miko got into her stateroom and tried to force\nhis love on her. She repulsed him--he killed her.\"\n\nIt struck me blank. And then with a rush came the thought, \"He says Miko\nkilled her....\"\n\nI heard myself stammering, \"Why--why we must get him!\" I gathered my\nwits; a surge of hate swept me; a wild desire for vengeance.\n\n\"Why, by God, where is he? Why don't you go get him? I'll get him--I'll\nkill him, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Easy, Gregg!\" Dr. Frank gripped me.\n\nThe captain said gently, \"We know how you feel, Gregg. She told us\nbefore she died.\"\n\n\"I'll bring him in here to you! But I'll kill him, I tell you!\"\n\n\"No you won't, lad. You're hysterical now. We don't want him killed, not\nattacked even. Not yet. We'll explain later.\"\n\nThey sat me down, calming me.\n\nAnita dead. The door of the shining garden was closed. A brief glimpse,\ngiven to me and to her of what might have been. And now she was\ndead....\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_A Speck of Human Earth-dust, Falling Free...._\n\nI had not been able at first to understand why Captain Carter wanted\nMiko left at liberty. Within me there was that cry of vengeance, as\nthough to strike Miko down would somehow lessen my own grief at\nAnita's loss. Whatever Carter's purpose, Snap had not known it. But\nBalch and Dr. Frank were in the captain's confidence--all three of\nthem working on some plan of action. Snap and I argued it, and thought\nwe could fathom it; and in spite of my desire to kill Miko, the thing\nlooked reasonable.\n\nIt was obvious that at least two of our passengers were plotting with\nMiko and George Prince; trying during this voyage to learn what they\ncould about Grantline's activities on the Moon; scheming doubtless to\nseize the treasure when the Planetara stopped at the Moon on the return\nvoyage. I thought I could name those masquerading passengers. Ob Hahn,\nsupposedly a Venus Mystic. And Rance Rankin, who called himself an\nAmerican magician. Those two, Snap and I agreed, seemed most suspicious.\nAnd there was the purser.\n\nWith my hysteria still on me, I sat for a time on the deck outside the\nchart-room with Snap. Then Carter summoned us back, and we sat listening\nwhile he, Balch and Dr. Frank went on with their conference. Listening\nto them I could not but agree that our best plan was to secure evidence\nwhich would incriminate all who were concerned in the plot. Miko, we\nwere convinced, had been the Martian who followed Snap and me from\nHalsey's office in Great-New York. George Prince had doubtless been the\ninvisible eavesdropper outside the helio-room. He knew, and had told the\nothers, that Grantline had found radium-ore on the Moon--that the\nPlanetara would stop there on the way home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut we could not incarcerate George Prince for being an eavesdropper.\nNor had we the faintest tangible evidence against Ob Hahn or Rance\nRankin. And even the purser would probably be released by the\nInterplanetary Court of Ferrok-Shahn when it heard our evidence.\n\nThere was only Miko. We could arrest him for the murder of Anita. But\nthe others would be put on their guard. It was Carter's idea to let Miko\nremain at liberty for a time and see if we could not identify and\nincriminate his fellows. The murder of Anita obviously had nothing to do\nwith any plot against the Grantline Moon treasure.\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Balch, \"there might be--probably are--huge Martian\ninterests concerned in this thing. These men here aboard are only\nemissaries, making this voyage to learn what they can. When they get to\nFerrok-Shahn they'll make their report, and then we'll have a real\ndanger on our hands. Why, an outlaw ship could be launched from\nFerrok-Shahn that would beat us back to the Moon--and Grantline is\nentirely without warning of any danger!\"\n\nIt seemed obvious. Unscrupulous, moneyed criminals in Ferrok-Shahn would\nbe dangerous indeed, once these details of Grantline were given them.\nAnd so now it was decided that in the remaining nine days of our outward\nvoyage, we would attempt to secure enough evidence to arrest all these\nplotters.\n\n\"I'll have them all in the cage when we land,\" Carter declared grimly.\n\"They'll make no report to their principals. The thing will end, be\nstamped out!\"\n\nAh, the futile plans of men!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet we thought it practical. We were all doubly armed now. Explosive\nbullet-projectors and the heat-ray cylinders. And we had several\neavesdropping microphones which we planned to use whenever occasion\noffered.\n\nIt was now, Earth Eastern Time, A. M. Twenty-eight hours only of this\neventful voyage were passed. The Planetara was some six million miles\nfrom the Earth; it blazed behind us, a tremendous giant.\n\nThe body of Anita was being made ready for burial. George Prince was\nstill in his stateroom. Glutz, effeminate little hairdresser, who waxed\nrich acting as beauty doctor for the women passengers, and who in his\nyouth had been an undertaker, had gone with Dr. Frank to prepare the\nbody.\n\nGruesome details. I tried not to think of them. I sat, numbed, in the\nchart-room.\n\nAn astronomical burial--there was little precedent for it. I dragged\nmyself to the stern deck-space where, at five A. M., the ceremony took\nplace. Most of the passengers were asleep, unaware of all this--which\nwas why Carter hastened it.\n\nWe were a solemn little group, gathered there in the checkered starlight\nwith the great vault of the heavens around us. A dismantled electronic\nprojector--necessary when a long-range gun was mounted--had been rigged\nup in one of the deck ports.\n\nThey brought out the body. I stood apart, gazing reluctantly at the\nsmall bundle, wrapped like a mummy in a dark metallic screen-cloth. A\npatch of black silk rested over her face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour cabin stewards carried her. And beside her walked George Prince. A\nlong black robe covered him, but his head was bare. And suddenly he\nreminded me of the ancient play-character of Hamlet. His black, wavy\nhair; his finely chiseled, pallid face, set now in a stern, patrician\ncast. And staring, I realized that however much of a villain this man\nnot yet thirty might be, at this instant, walking beside the body of his\ndead sister, he was stricken with grief. He loved that sister with whom\nhe had lived since childhood; and to see him now, with his set white\nface, no one could doubt it.\n\nThe little procession stopped in a patch of starlight by the port. They\nrested the body on a bank of chairs. The black-robed Chaplain, roused\nfrom his bed and still trembling from excitement of this sudden,\ninexplicable death on board, said a brief, solemn little prayer. An\nappeal: That the Almighty Ruler of all these blazing worlds might guard\nthe soul of this gentle girl whose mortal remains were now to be\nreturned to Him.\n\nAh, if ever God seemed hovering close, it was now at this instant, on\nthis starlit deck floating in the black void of space.\n\nThen Carter for just a moment removed the black shroud from her face. I\nsaw her brother gaze silently; saw him stoop and implant a kiss--and\nturn away. I did not want to look, but I found myself moving slowly\nforward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe lay, so beautiful. Her face, white and calm and peaceful in death.\nMy sight blurred. Words seemed to echo: \"A little son, cast in the\ngentle image of his mother....\"\n\n\"Easy, Gregg!\" Snap was whispering to me. He had his arm around me.\n\"Come on away!\"\n\nThey tied the shroud over her face. I did not see them as they put her\nbody in the tube, sent it through the exhaust-chamber, and dropped it.\n\nBut a moment later I saw it--a small black oblong bundle--hovering\nbeside us. It was perhaps a hundred feet away, circling us. Held by the\nPlanetara's bulk, it had momentarily become our satellite. It swung\naround us like a moon. Gruesome satellite, by nature's laws forever to\nfollow us.\n\nThen from another tube at the bow, Blackstone operated a small\nZed-co-ray projector. Its dull light caught the floating bundle,\nneutralizing its metallic wrappings.\n\nIt swung off at a tangent. Speeding. Falling free in the dome of the\nheavens. A rotating black oblong. But in a moment distance dwindled it\nto a speck. A dull silver dot with the sunlight on it. A speck of human\nEarth-dust, falling free....\n\nIt vanished. Anita--gone. In my heart was an echo of the prayer that the\nAlmighty might watch over her and guard her always....\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The Electrical Eavesdropper_\n\nI turned from the deck. Miko was near me! So he had dared to show\nhimself here among us! But I realized that he could not be aware we knew\nhe was the murderer. George Prince had been asleep, had not seen Miko\nwith Anita. Miko, with impulsive rage, had shot the girl and escaped. No\ndoubt now he was cursing himself for having done it. And he could very\nwell assume that Anita had died without regaining consciousness to tell\nwho had killed her.\n\nHe gazed at me now, here on the deck. I thought for an instant he was\ncoming over to talk to me. Though he probably considered he was not\nsuspected of the murder of Anita, he realized, of course, that his\nattack on me was known; he must have wondered what action Captain Carter\nwould take.\n\nBut he did not approach me; he moved away, and went inside. Moa had been\nnear him; and as though by pre-arrangement with him she now accosted\nme.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, Set Haljan.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nI felt an instinctive aversion for this Martian girl. Yet she was not\nunattractive. Over six feet tall, straight and slim. Sleek blond hair.\nRather a handsome face. Not gray, like the burly Miko, but pink and\nwhite. Stern-lipped, yet feminine, too. She was smiling gravely now. Her\nblue eyes regarded me keenly. She said gently:\n\n\"A sad occurrence, Gregg Haljan. And mysterious. I would not question\nyou--\"\n\n\"Is that all you have to say?\" I demanded, when she paused.\n\n\"No. You are a handsome man, Gregg--attractive to women--to any Martian\nwoman.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe said it impulsively. Admiration for me was on her face, in her\neyes--a man cannot miss it.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I mean, I would be your friend. My brother Miko is so sorry about what\nhappened between you and him this morning. He only wanted to talk to\nyou, and he came to your cubby door--\"\n\n\"With a torch to break its seal,\" I interjected.\n\nShe waved that away. \"He was afraid you would not admit him. He told you\nhe would not hurt you.\"\n\n\"And so he struck me with one of your cursed Martian paralyzing rays!\"\n\n\"He is sorry....\"\n\nShe seemed gauging me, trying, no doubt, to find out what reprisal would\nbe taken against her brother. I felt sure that Moa was as active as a\nman in any plan that was under way to capture the Grantline treasure.\nMiko, with his ungovernable temper, was doing things that put their\nplans in jeopardy.\n\nI demanded abruptly, \"What did your brother want to talk to me about?\"\n\n\"Me,\" she said surprisingly. \"I sent him. A Martian girl goes after what\nshe wants. Did you know that?\"\n\nShe swung on her heel and left me. I puzzled over it. Was that why Miko\nhad struck me down, and was carrying me off? Was my accursed masculine\nbeauty so attractive to this Martian girl? I did not think so. I could\nnot believe that all these incidents were so unrelated to what I knew\nwas the main undercurrent. They wanted me, had tried to capture me. For\nsomething else than because Moa liked my looks....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Frank found me mooning alone.\n\n\"Go to bed, Gregg! You look awful.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Where's Snap?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was here a while ago.\" I had not seen him since the\nburial of Anita.\n\n\"The captain wants him.\" The surgeon left me.\n\nWithin an hour the morning siren would arouse the passengers. I was\nseated in a secluded corner of the deck, when George Prince came along.\nHe went past me, a slight, somber, dark-robed figure. He had on high,\nthick boots. A hood was over his head, but as he saw me he pushed it\nback and dropped down beside me.\n\nBut for a moment he did not speak. His face showed pallid in the pallid\nstar-gleams.\n\n\"She said you loved her.\" His soft voice was throaty with emotion.\n\n\"Yes.\" I said it almost against my will. There seemed a bond springing\nbetween this bereaved brother and me. He added, so softly I could\nbarely hear him, \"That makes you, I think, almost my friend. And you\nthought you were my enemy.\"\n\nI held my answer. An incautious tongue running under emotion is a\ndangerous thing. And I was sure of nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went on, \"Almost my friend. Because--we both loved her, and she loved\nus both.\" He was hardly more than whispering. \"And there is aboard--one\nwhom we both hate.\"\n\n\"Miko!\" It burst from me.\n\n\"Yes. But do not say it.\"\n\nAnother silence fell between us. He brushed back the black curls from\nhis forehead. And his dark eyes searched mine.\n\n\"Have you an eavesdropping microphone, Haljan?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was thinking....\" He leaned closer toward me. \"If, in half an hour,\nyou could use it upon Miko's cabin--I would rather tell you than the\ncaptain or anyone else. The cabin will be insulated, but I shall find a\nway of cutting off that insulation so that you may hear.\"\n\nSo George Prince had turned with us! The shock of his sister's\ndeath--himself allied to her murderer!--had been too much for him. He\nwas with us!\n\nYet his help must be given secretly. Miko would kill him in an instant\nif it became known.\n\nHe had been watchful of the deck. He stood up now.\n\n\"I think that is all.\"\n\nAs he turned away, I murmured, \"But I do thank you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe name Set Miko glowed upon the small metal door. It was in a\ntransverse corridor similar to A 22. The corridor was forward of the\nlounge: it opened off the small circular library.\n\nThe library was unoccupied and unlighted, dim with only the reflected\nlights from the nearby passages. I crouched behind a cylinder-case. The\ndoor of Miko's room was in sight, being some thirty feet away from me.\n\nI waited perhaps five minutes. No one entered. Then I realized\nthat doubtless the conspirators were already there. I set my tiny\neavesdropper on the library floor beside me; connected its little\nbattery; focused its projector. Was Miko's room insulated? I could not\ntell. There was a small ventilating grid above the door. Across its\nopening, if the room were insulated, a blue sheen of radiance\nwould be showing. And there would be a faint hum. But from this\ndistance I could not see or hear such details, and I was afraid to\napproach closer. Once in the transverse corridor, I would have no\nplace to hide, no way of escape; if anyone approached Miko's door, I\nwould be discovered.\n\nI threw the current into my little apparatus. I prayed, if it met\ninterference, that the slight sound would pass unnoticed. George Prince\nhad said he would make opportunity to disconnect the room's insulation.\nHe had evidently done so. I picked up the interior sounds at once; my\nheadphone vibrated with them. And with trembling fingers on the little\ndial between my knees as I crouched in the darkness behind the\ncylinder-case, I synchronized.\n\n\"Johnson is a fool.\" It was Miko's voice. \"We must have the pass-words.\"\n\n\"He got them from the helio-room.\" A man's voice; I puzzled over it at\nfirst, then recognized it. Rance Rankin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiko said, \"He is a fool. Walking around this ship as though with\nletters blazoned on his forehead--'Watch me--I need watching--' Hah! No\nwonder they apprehended him!\"\n\nWas George Prince in there? Rankin's voice said: \"He would have turned\nthe papers over to us. I would not blame him too much. What harm--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll release him,\" Miko declared. \"What harm? That braying ass did\nus plenty of harm. He has lost the pass-words. Better he had left them\nin the helio-room.\"\n\nMoa was in the room. Her voice said: \"We've got to have them. The\nPlanetara, upon such an important voyage as this, may be watched. How do\nwe know--\"\n\n\"It is, no doubt,\" Rankin said quietly. \"We ought to have the\npass-words. When we are in control of this ship....\"\n\nIt sent a shiver through me. Were they planning to try and seize the\nPlanetara? Now? It seemed so.\n\n\"Johnson undoubtedly memorized them,\" Moa was saying. \"When we get him\nout--\"\n\n\"Hahn is to do that, at the signal.\" Miko added, \"George could do it\nbetter, perhaps.\"\n\nAnd then I heard George Prince for the first time. He murmured, \"I will\ntry.\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Miko. \"I praise where praise is deserved. And I have\nlittle praise for you now, George!\"\n\nI could not see what happened. A look, perhaps, which Prince could not\navoid giving this man he had come to hate. Miko doubtless saw it, and\nthe Martian's hot anger leaped.\n\nRankin said hurriedly, \"Stop that!\"\n\nAnd Moa: \"Let him alone! Sit down, you fool!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could hear the sound of a scuffle. A blow--a cry, half suppressed,\nfrom George Prince.\n\nThen Miko: \"I will not hurt him. Craven coward! Look at him! Hating\nme--frightened!\"\n\nI could fancy George Prince sitting there with murder in his heart, and\nMiko taunting him:\n\n\"Hates me now, because I shot his sister!\"\n\nMoa: \"Hush!\"\n\n\"I will not! Why should I not say it? I will tell you something else,\nGeorge Prince. It was not Anita I shot at, but you! I meant nothing for\nher, but love. If you had not interfered--\"\n\nThis was different from what we had figured. George Prince had come in\nfrom his own room, had tried to rescue his sister, and in the scuffle,\nAnita had taken the shot intended for George.\n\n\"I did not even know I had hit her,\" Miko was saying. \"Not until I heard\nshe was dead.\" He added sardonically, \"I hoped it was you I had hit,\nGeorge. And I will tell you this: You hate me no more than I hate you.\nIf it were not for your knowledge of radium ores--\"\n\n\"Is this to be a personal wrangle?\" Rankin interrupted. \"I thought we\nwere here to plan--\"\n\n\"It is planned,\" Miko said shortly. \"I give orders, I do not plan. I am\nwaiting now for the moment--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe checked himself. Moa said, \"Does Rankin understand that no harm is to\ncome to Gregg Haljan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rankin. \"And Dean. We need them, of course. But you cannot\nmake Dean send messages if he refuses, nor make Haljan navigate.\"\n\n\"I know enough to check on them,\" Miko said grimly. \"They will not fool\nme. And they will obey me, have no fear. A little touch of sulphuric--\"\nHis laugh was gruesome. \"It makes the most stubborn very willing.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Moa, \"we had Haljan safely hidden. If he is hurt--killed--\"\n\nSo that was why Miko had tried to capture me? To keep me safe so that I\nmight navigate the ship.\n\nIt occurred to me that I should get Carter at once. A plot to seize the\nPlanetara? But when?\n\nI froze with startled horror.\n\nThe diaphragms at my ears rang with Miko's words: \"I have set the time\nfor now! In two minutes--\"\n\nIt seemed to startle both Rankin and George Prince almost as much as I.\nBoth exclaimed:\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"No? Why not? Everyone is at his post!\"\n\nPrince repeated: \"No!\"\n\nAnd Rankin: \"But can we trust them? The stewards--the crew?\"\n\n\"Eight of them are our own men! You didn't know that, Rankin? They've\nbeen aboard the Planetara for several voyages. Oh, this is no\nquickly-planned affair, even though we let you in on it so recently. You\nand Johnson. By God!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI crouched tense. There was a commotion in the stateroom. Miko had\ndiscovered that his insulation was cut off! He had evidently leaped to\nhis feet; I heard a chair overturn. And the Martian's roar: \"It's off!\nDid you do that, Prince? By God, if I thought--\"\n\nMy apparatus went suddenly dead as Miko flung on his insulation. I lost\nmy wits in the confusion; I should have instantly taken off my\nvibrations. There was interference; it showed in the dark space of the\nventilator grid over Miko's doorway; a snapping in the air there, a\nswirl of sparks.\n\nI heard with my unaided ears Miko's roar over his insulation: \"By God,\nthey're listening!\"\n\nThe scream of a hand-siren sounded from his stateroom. It rang over the\nship. His signal! I heard it answered from some distant point. And then\na shot; a commotion in the lower corridors....\n\nThe attack upon the Planetara had started!\n\nI was on my feet. The shouts of startled passengers sounded, a turmoil\nbeginning everywhere.\n\nI stood momentarily transfixed. The door of Miko's stateroom burst open.\nHe stood there, with Moa, Rankin and George Prince crowding behind him.\n\nHe saw me. \"You, Gregg Haljan!\"\n\nHe came leaping at me.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_The Weightless Combat_\n\nI was taken wholly by surprise. There was an instant when I stood\nnumbed, fumbling for a weapon at my belt, undecided whether to run or\nstand my ground. Miko was no more than twenty feet from me. He checked\nhis forward rush. The light from an overhead tube was on him; I saw in\nhis hand the cylinder projector of his paralyzing ray.\n\nI plucked my heat-cylinder from my belt, and fired without taking aim.\nMy tiny heat-beam flashed. I must have grazed Miko's hand. His roar of\nanger and pain rang out over the turmoil. He dropped his weapon; then\nstooped to pick it up. But Moa forestalled him. She leaped and seized\nit.\n\n\"Careful! Fool--you promised not to hurt him!\"\n\nA confusion of swift action. Rankin had turned and darted away. I saw\nGeorge Prince stumbling half in front of the struggling Miko and Moa.\nAnd I heard footsteps beside me; a hand gripped me, jerked at me.\n\nOver the turmoil Prince's voice sounded: \"Gregg--Haljan!\"\n\nI recall I had the impression that Prince was frightened; he had half\nfallen in front of Miko. And there was Miko's voice:\n\n\"Let go of me!\"\n\nAnd Moa: \"Come!\"\n\nIt was Balch gripping me. \"Gregg! This way--run! Get out of here! He'll\nkill you with that ray--\"\n\nMiko's ray flashed, but George Prince had knocked at his arm. I did not\ndare fire again. Prince was in the way. Balch, who was unarmed, shoved\nme violently back.\n\n\"Gregg--the chart-room!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned and ran, with Balch after me. Prince had fallen, or been felled\nby Miko. A flash followed me. Miko's weapon, but again it missed. He did\nnot pursue me; he ran the other way, through the port-side door of the\nlibrary.\n\nBalch and I found ourselves in the lounge. Shouting, frightened\npassengers were everywhere. The place was in wild confusion, the whole\nship ringing now with shouts.\n\n\"To the chart-room, Gregg!\"\n\nI called to the passengers: \"Get back to your rooms!\"\n\nI followed Balch. We ran through the archway to the deck. In the\nstarlight I saw figures scurrying aft, but none were near us. The deck\nforward was dim with heavy shadows. The oval window and door of the\nchart-room were blue-yellow from the tube-lights inside. No one seemed\non the deck there; and then, as we approached, I saw, further forward in\nthe bow, the trap-door to the cage standing open. Johnson had been\nreleased.\n\nFrom one of the chart-room windows a heat-ray sizzled. It barely missed\nus. Balch shouted, \"Carter--don't!\"\n\nThe captain called, \"Oh--you, Balch--and Haljan--\"\n\nHe came out on the deck as we rushed up. His left arm was dangling\nlimp.\n\n\"God--this--\" He got no further. From the turret overhead a tiny\nsearch-beam came down and disclosed us. Blackstone was supposed to be on\nduty up there, with a course-master at the controls. But, glancing up, I\nsaw, illumined by the turret lights, the figures of Ob Hahn in his\npurple-white robe, and Johnson the purser. And on the turret balcony,\ntwo fallen men--Blackstone and the course-master.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnson was training the spotlight on us. And Hahn fired a Martian ray.\nIt struck Balch beside me. He dropped.\n\nCarter was shouting, \"Inside! Gregg, get inside!\"\n\nI stopped to raise up Balch. Another beam came down. A heat-ray this\ntime. It caught the fallen Balch full in the chest, piercing him\nthrough. The smell of his burning flesh rose to sicken me. He was dead.\nI dropped his body. Carter shoved me into the chart-room.\n\nIn the small, steel-lined room, Carter and I slid the door closed. We\nwere alone here. The thing had come so quickly it had taken Captain\nCarter, like us all, wholly unawares. We had anticipated spying\neavesdroppers, but not this open brigandage. No more than a minute or\ntwo had passed since Miko's siren in his stateroom had given the signal\nfor the attack. Carter had been in the chart-room. Blackstone was in the\nturret. At the outbreak of confusion, Carter dashed out to see Hahn\nreleasing Johnson from the cage. From the forward chart-room window now\nI could see where Hahn with a torch had broken the cage-seal. The torch\nlay on the deck. There had been an exchange of shots; Carter's arm was\nparalyzed; Johnson and Hahn had escaped.\n\nCarter was as confused as I. There had simultaneously been an encounter\nup in the turret. Blackstone and the course-master were killed. The\nlookout had been shot from his post in the forward observatory. His body\ndangled now, twisted half in and half out of his window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe could see several of Miko's men--erstwhile members of our crew and\nsteward-corps--scurrying from the turret along the upper bridges toward\nthe dark and silent helio-room. Snap was up there. But was he? The\nhelio-room glowed suddenly with dim light, but there was no evidence of\na fight there. The fighting seemed mostly below the deck, down in the\nhull-corridors. A blended horror of sounds came up to us. Screams,\nshouts, and the hissing and snapping of ray weapons. Our crew--such of\nthem as were loyal--were making a stand down below. But it was brief.\nWithin a minute it died away. The passengers, amidships in the\nsuperstructure, were still shouting. Then above them Miko's roar\nsounded.\n\n\"Be quiet! Go in your rooms--you will not be harmed.\"\n\nThe brigands in these few minutes were in control of the ship. All but\nthis little chart-room, where, with most of the ship's weapons, Carter\nand I were intrenched.\n\n\"God, Gregg, that this should come upon us!\"\n\nCarter was fumbling with the chart-room weapons. \"Here, Gregg, help me.\nWhat have you got? Heat-ray? That's all I had ready.\"\n\nIt struck me then as I helped him make the connections that Carter in\nthis crisis was at best an inefficient commander. His red face had gone\nsplotchy purple; his hands were trembling. Skilled as captain of a\npeaceful liner, he was at a loss now. Nor could I blame him. It is easy\nto say we might have taken warning, done this or that, and come\ntriumphant through this attack. But only the fool looks backward and\nsays, \"I would have done better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI tried to summon my wits. The ship was lost to us, unless Carter and I\ncould do something. Our futile weapons! They were all here--four or\nfive heat-ray hand projectors that could send a pencil-ray a hundred\nfeet or so. I shot one diagonally up at the turret where Johnson was\nleering down at our rear window, but he saw my gesture and dropped back\nout of sight. The heat-beam flashed harmlessly up and struck the turret\nroof. Then across the turret window came a sheen of radiance--an\nelectro-barrage. And behind it, Hahn's suave, evil face appeared. He\nshouted down:\n\n\"We have orders to spare you, Gregg Haljan--or you would have been\nkilled long ago!\"\n\nMy answering shot hit his barrage with a shower of sparks, behind which\nhe stood unmoved.\n\nCarter handed me another weapon. \"Gregg, try this.\"\n\nI levelled the old explosive bullet projector; Carter crouched beside\nme. But before I could press the trigger, from somewhere down the\nstarlit deck an electro-beam hit me. The little rifle exploded, burst\nits breech. I sank back to the floor, tingling from the shock of the\nhostile current. My hands were blackened from the exploding powder.\n\nCarter seized me. \"No use! Hurt?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stars through the dome-windows were swinging. A long swing--the\nshadows and starlit patches on the deck were all shifting. The Planetara\nwas turning. The heavens revolved in a great round sweep of movement,\nthen settled as we took our new course. Hahn at the turret controls had\nswung us. The earth and the sun showed over our bow quarter. The\nsunlight mingled red-yellow with the brilliant starlight. Hahn's signals\nwere sounding; I heard them answered from the mechanism rooms down\nbelow. Brigands there--in full control. The gravity plates were being\nset to the new positions; we were on our new course. Headed a point or\ntwo off the Earth-line. Not headed for the moon? I wondered.\n\nCarter and I were planning nothing. What was there to plan? We were\nunder observation. A Martian paralyzing ray--or electronic beam, far\nmore deadly than our own puny police weapons--would have struck us the\ninstant we tried to leave the chart-room.\n\nMy swift-running thoughts were interrupted by a shout from down the\ndeck. At a corner of the cabin superstructure some fifty feet from our\nwindows the figure of Miko appeared. A barrage-radiance hung around him\nlike a shimmering mantle. His voice sounded:\n\n\"Gregg Haljan, do you yield?\"\n\nCarter leaped up from where he and I were crouching. Against all reason\nof safety he leaned from the low window, waving his hamlike fist.\n\n\"Yield? No! I am in command here, you pirate! Brigand--murderer!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pushed him back. \"Careful!\"\n\nHe was spluttering, and over it Miko's sardonic laugh sounded. \"Very\nwell--but you will talk? Shall we argue about it?\"\n\nI stood up. \"What do you want to say, Miko?\"\n\nBehind him the tall, thin figure of his sister showed. She was plucking\nat him. He turned violently.\n\n\"I won't hurt him! Gregg Haljan--is this a truce? You will not shoot?\"\nHe was shielding Moa.\n\n\"No,\" I called. \"For a moment, no. A truce. What is it you want to\nsay?\"\n\nI could hear the babble of passengers who were herded in the cabin with\nbrigands guarding them. George Prince, bareheaded, but shrouded in his\ncloak, showed in a patch of light behind Moa. He looked my way and then\nretreated into the lounge archway.\n\nMiko called, \"You must yield. We want you, Haljan.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I jeered.\n\n\"Alive. It is easy to kill you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could not doubt that. Carter and I were little more than rats in a\ntrap, here in the chart-room. But Miko wanted to take me alive: that was\nnot so simple. He added persuasively:\n\n\"We want you to help us navigate. Will you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Will you help us, Captain Carter? Tell your cub, this Haljan, to yield.\nYou are fools. We understand that Haljan has been handling the ship's\nmathematics. Him we need most.\"\n\nCarter roared: \"Get back from there! This is no truce!\"\n\nI shoved aside his levelled bullet-projector. \"Wait a minute!\" I called\nto Miko. \"Navigate--where?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he retorted, \"that is our business, not yours. When you lay down\nyour weapons and come out of there, I will give you the course.\"\n\n\"Back to the earth?\" I suggested.\n\nI could fancy him grinning behind the sheen of his barrage at my\nquestion.\n\n\"The earth? Yes--shall we go there? Give me your orders, Gregg Haljan.\nOf course I will obey them.\"\n\nHis sardonic words were interrupted. And I realized that all this parley\nwas a ruse of Miko's to take me alive. He had made a gesture. Hahn,\nwatching from the turret window, doubtless flashed a signal down to the\nhull-corridors. The magnetizer control under the chart-room was\naltered, our artificial gravity cut off. I felt the sudden lightness; I\ngripped the window casement and clung. Carter was startled into\nincautious movement. It flung him out into the center of the chart-room,\nhis arms and legs grotesquely flailing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd across the chart-room, in the opposite window, I felt rather than\nsaw the shape of something. A figure--almost invisible, but not\nquite--was trying to climb in! I flung the empty rifle I was holding. It\nhit something solid in the window; in a flare of sparks a black-hooded\nfigure materialized. A man climbing in! His weapon spat. There was a\ntiny electronic flash, deadly silent. The intruder had shot at Carter;\nstruck him. Carter gave one queer scream. He had floated to the floor;\nhis convulsive movement when he was hit hurled him to the ceiling. His\nbody struck, twitched; bounced back and sank inert on the floor-grid\nalmost at my feet.\n\nI clung to the casement. Across the space of the weightless room the\nhooded intruder was also clinging. His hood fell back. It was Johnson.\nHe leered at me.\n\n\"Killed him, the bully! Well, he deserved it. Now for you, Mr. Third\nOfficer Haljan!\"\n\nBut he did not dare fire at me--Miko had forbidden it. I saw him reach\nunder his robe, doubtless for a low-powered paralyzing ray such as Miko\nalready had used on me. But he never got it out. I had no weapon within\nreach. I leaned into the room, still holding the casement, and doubled\nmy legs under me. I kicked out from the window.\n\nThe force catapulted me across the space of the room like a volplane. I\nstruck the purser. We gripped. Our locked, struggling bodies bounced out\ninto the room. We struck the floor, surged up like balloons to the\nceiling, struck it with a flailing arm or a leg and floated back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrotesque, abnormal combat! Like fighting in weightless water. Johnson\nclutched his weapon, but I twisted his wrist, held his arm outstretched\nso that he could not aim it. I was aware of Miko's voice shouting on the\ndeck outside.\n\nJohnson's left hand was gouging at my face, his fingers plucking at my\neyes. We lunged down to the floor, then up again, close to the ceiling.\n\nI twisted his wrists. He dropped the weapon and it sank away. I tried to\nreach it, but could not. Then I had him by the throat. I was stronger\nthan he, and more agile. I tried choking him, his thick bull-neck within\nmy fingers. He kicked, scrambled, tore and gouged at me. Tried to shout,\nbut it ended in a gurgle. And then, as he felt his breath stopped, his\nhands came up in an effort to tear mine loose.\n\nWe sank again to the floor. We were momentarily upright. I felt my feet\ntouch. I bent my knees. We sank further.\n\nAnd then I kicked violently upward. Our locked bodies shot to the\nceiling. Johnson's head was above me. It struck the steel roof of the\nchart-room. A violent blow. I felt him go suddenly limp. I cast him off,\nand, doubling my body, I kicked at the ceiling. It sent me diagonally\ndownward to the window, where I clung and regained stability.\n\nAnd I saw Miko standing on the deck with a weapon levelled at me!\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_The Torture_\n\n\"Haljan! Yield or I'll fire! Moa, give me the smaller one. This\ncursed--\"\n\nHe had in his hand too large a projector. Its ray would kill me. If he\nwanted to take me alive, he would not fire. I chanced it.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nI tried to draw myself beneath the window. An automatic bullet projector\nwas on the floor where Carter had dropped it. I pulled myself down.\nMiko did not fire. I reached the revolver. The dead bodies of the\ncaptain and purser had drifted together on the floor in the center of\nthe room.\n\nI hitched myself back to the window. With upraised weapon I gazed\ncautiously out. Miko had disappeared. The deck within my line of vision\nwas empty.\n\nBut was it? Something told me to beware. I clung to the casement, ready\nupon the instant to shove myself down. There was a movement in a shadow\nalong the deck. Then a figure rose up.\n\n\"Don't fire, Haljan!\"\n\nThe sharp command, half appeal, stopped the pressure of my finger on the\ntrigger of the automatic. It was the tall lanky Englishman, Sir Arthur\nConiston, as he called himself. So he too was one of Miko's band! The\nlight through a dome-window fell full on him.\n\n\"If you fire, Haljan, and kill me--Miko will kill you then, surely.\"\n\nFrom where he had been crouching he could not command my window. But\nnow, upon the heels of his placating words, he abruptly shot. The\nlow-powered ray, had it struck, would have felled me without killing.\nBut it went over my head as I dropped. Its aura made my senses reel.\n\nConiston shouted, \"Haljan!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not answer. I wondered if he would dare approach to see if I had\nbeen hit. A minute passed. Then another. I thought I heard Miko's voice\non the deck outside. But it was an aerial, microscopic whisper close\nbeside me.\n\n\"We see you, Haljan! You must yield!\"\n\nTheir eavesdropping vibrations, with audible projection, were upon me. I\nretorted aloud.\n\n\"Come and get me! You cannot take me alive.\"\n\nI do protest if this action of mine in the chart-room may seem bravado.\nI had no wish to die. There was within me a very healthy desire for\nlife. But I felt, by holding out, that some chance might come wherewith\nI might turn events against these brigands. Yet reason told me it was\nhopeless. Our loyal members of the crew were killed, no doubt. Captain\nCarter and Balch were killed. The lookouts and Course-masters also. And\nBlackstone.\n\nThere remained only Dr. Frank and Snap. Their fate I did not yet know.\nAnd there was George Prince. He, perhaps, would help me if he could.\nBut, at best, he was a dubious ally.\n\n\"You are very foolish, Haljan,\" murmured the projection of Miko's voice.\nAnd then I heard Coniston:\n\n\"See here, why would not a hundred pounds of gold-leaf tempt you? The\ncode-words which were taken from Johnson--I mean to say, why not tell us\nwhere they are?\"\n\nSo that was one of the brigands new difficulties! Snap had taken the\ncode-word sheet, that time we sealed the purser in the cage.\n\nI said, \"You'll never find them. And when a police ship sights us, what\nwill you do then?\"\n\nThe chances of a police ship were slim indeed, but the brigands\nevidently did not know that. I wondered again what had become of Snap.\nWas he captured--or still holding them off?\n\nI was watching my windows; for at any moment, under cover of this talk,\nI might be assailed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGravity came suddenly to the room. Miko's voice said. \"We mean well by\nyou, Haljan. There is your normality. Join us. We need you to chart our\ncourse.\"\n\n\"And a hundred pounds of gold-leaf,\" urged Coniston. \"Or more. Why, this\ntreasure--\"\n\nI could hear an oath from Miko. And then his ironic voice: \"We will not\nbother you, Haljan. There is no hurry. You will be hungry in good time.\nAnd sleepy. Then we will come and get you. And a little acid will make\nyou think differently about helping us....\"\n\nHis vibrations died away. The pull of gravity in the room was normal. I\nwas alone in the dim silence, with the bodies of Carter and Johnson\nlying huddled on the grid. I bent to examine them. Both were dead.\n\nMy isolation was no ruse this time. The outlaws made no further attack.\nHalf an hour passed. The deck outside, what I could see of it, was\nvacant. Balch lay dead close outside the chart-room door. The bodies of\nBlackstone and the Course-master had been removed from the turret\nwindow. A forward lookout--one of Miko's men--was on duty in the nearby\ntower. Hahn was at the turret controls. The ship was under orderly\nhandling, heading back upon a new course. For the Earth? Or the Moon? It\ndid not seem so.\n\nI found, in the chart-room, a Benson curve-light projector which poor\nCaptain Carter had very nearly assembled. I worked on it, trained it\nthrough my rear window, along the empty deck; bent it into the lounge\narchway. Upon my grid the image of the lounge interior presently\nfocused. The passengers in the lounge were huddled in a group.\nDisheveled, frightened, with Moa standing watching them. Stewards were\nserving them with a meal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUpon a bench, bodies were lying. Some were dead. I saw Rance Rankin.\nOthers were evidently only injured. Dr. Frank was moving among them,\nattending them. Venza was there, unharmed. And I saw the gamblers, Shac\nand Dud, sitting white-faced, whispering together. And Glutz's little\nbe-ribboned, be-curled figure on a stool.\n\nGeorge Prince was there, standing against the walls shrouded in his\nmourning cloak, watching the scene with alert, roving eyes. And by the\nopposite doorway, the huge towering figure of Miko stood on guard. But\nSnap was missing.\n\nA brief glimpse. Miko saw my Benson-light. I could have equipped a\nheat-ray, and fired along the curved Benson-light into that lounge. But\nMiko gave me no time.\n\nHe slid the lounge door closed, and Moa leaped to close the one on my\nside. My light was cut off; my grid showed only the blank deck and\ndoor.\n\nAnother interval. I had made plans. Futile plans! I could get into the\nturret perhaps, and kill Hahn. I had the invisible cloak which Johnson\nwas wearing. I took it from his body. Its mechanism could be repaired.\nWhy, with it I could creep about the ship, kill these brigands one by\none perhaps. George Prince would be with me. The brigands who had been\nposing as the stewards and crew-members were unable to navigate; they\nwould obey my orders. There were only Miko, Coniston and Hahn to kill.\n\nFutile plans! From my window I could gaze up to the helio-room. And now\nabruptly I heard Snap's voice:\n\n\"No! I tell you--no!\"\n\nAnd Miko: \"Very well. We will try this.\"\n\nSo Snap was captured, but not killed. Relief swept me. He was in the\nhelio-room, and Miko was with him. But my relief was short-lived.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a brief interval there came a moan from Snap. It floated down from\nthe silence overhead. It made me shudder.\n\nMy Benson-beam shot into the helio window. It showed me Snap lying there\non the floor. He was bound with wire. His torso had been stripped. His\nlivid face was ghastly plain in my light.\n\nMiko was bending over him. Miko with a heat-cylinder no longer than a\nfinger. Its needle-beam played upon Snap's naked chest. I could see the\ngruesome little trail of smoke rising; and as Snap twisted and jerked,\nthere on his flesh was the red and blistered trail of the violet-hot\nray.\n\n\"Now will you tell?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nMiko laughed. \"No? Then I shall write my name a little deeper....\"\n\nA black scar now--a trail etched in the quivering flesh.\n\n\"Oh!--\" Snap's face went white as chalk as he pressed his lips\ntogether.\n\n\"Or a little acid? This fire-writing does not really hurt? Tell me what\nyou did with those code-words!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nIn his absorption Miko did not notice my light. Nor did I have the wit\nto try and fire along it. I was trembling. Snap under torture!\n\nAs the beam went deeper, Snap suddenly screamed. But he ended, \"No! I\nwill send--no message for you--\"\n\nIt had been only a moment. In the chart-room window beside me again a\nfigure appeared! No image. A solid, living person, undisguised by any\ncloak of invisibility. George Prince had chanced my fire and had crept\nup upon me.\n\n\"Haljan! Don't attack me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI dropped my light connections. As impulsively I stood up, I saw through\nthe window the figure of Coniston on the deck watching the result of\nPrince's venture.\n\n\"Haljan--yield.\"\n\nPrince no more than whispered it. He stood outside on the deck; the low\nwindow casement touched his waist. He leaned over it.\n\n\"He's torturing Snap! Call out that you will yield.\"\n\nThe thought had already been in my mind. Another scream from Snap\nchilled me with horror. I shouted,\n\n\"Miko! Stop!\"\n\nI rushed to the window and Prince gripped me.\n\n\"Louder!\"\n\nI called louder. \"_Miko!_ Stop!\" My upflung voice mingled with Snap's\nagony of protest. Then Miko heard me. His head and shoulders showed up\nthere at the helio-room oval.\n\n\"You, Haljan?\"\n\nPrince shouted, \"I have made him yield. He will obey you if you stop\nthat torture.\"\n\nI think that poor Snap must have fainted. He was silent. I called,\n\"Stop! I will do what you command.\"\n\nMiko jeered, \"That is good. A bargain, if you and Dean obey me. Disarm\nhim, Prince, and bring him out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiko moved back into the helio-room. On the deck Coniston was advancing,\nbut cautiously, mistrustful of me.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nGeorge Prince flung a leg over the casement and leaped lightly into the\ndim chart-room. His small slender figure stood beside me, clung to me.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nA moment, while we stood there together. No ray was upon us. Coniston\ncould not see us, nor could he hear our whispers.\n\n\"Gregg.\"\n\nA different voice; its throaty, husky quality gone. A soft pleading.\n\"Gregg--\n\n\"Gregg, don't you know me? Gregg, dear....\"\n\nWhy, what was this? Not George Prince? A masquerader, yet so like George\nPrince.\n\n\"Gregg, don't you know me?\"\n\nClinging to me. A soft touch upon my arm. Fingers, clinging. A surge of\nwarm, tingling current was flowing between us.\n\nMy sweep of instant thoughts. A speck of human Earth-dust, falling free.\nThat was George Prince, who had been killed. George Prince's body,\ndisguised by the scheming Carter and Dr. Frank, buried in the guise of\nhis sister. And this black-robed figure who was trying to help us--\n\n\"Anita! Dear God! Anita, darling! Anita!\"\n\n\"Gregg, dear one!\"\n\n\"Anita! Dear God!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy arms went around her, my lips pressed hers, and felt her tremulous,\neager answer.\n\n\"Gregg, dear.\"\n\n\"Anita, you!\"\n\nThe form of Coniston showed at our window. She cast me off. She said,\nwith her throaty swagger of assumed masculinity:\n\n\"I have him, Sir Arthur. He will obey us.\"\n\nI sensed her warning glance. She shoved me toward the window. She said\nironically, \"Have no fear, Haljan. You will not be tortured, you and\nDean, if you obey our commands.\"\n\nConiston gripped me. \"You fool! You caused us a lot of trouble, didn't\nyou? Move along there!\"\n\nHe jerked me roughly through the window. Marched me the length of the\ndeck. Out to the stern-space; opened the door of my cubby; flung me in\nand sealed the door upon me.\n\n\"Miko will come presently.\"\n\nI stood in the darkness of my tiny room, listening to his retreating\nfootsteps. But my mind was not on him....\n\nAll the Universe in that instant had changed for me. Anita was alive!\n\n(_To be continued_)\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n  [1] As early as 1910 it was discovered that an object magnetized under\n      certain conditions was subject to a loss of weight, its gravity\n      partially nullified.

A whistle from the locomotive\nahead had warned the two alert young men in the smoker to that effect,\nand they arose to leave the train. Both were neatly and quietly dressed.\nOne carried a medium-sized camera with the necessary tripod and\naccessory satchel. The other carried no impediments of any sort. Both\nwere smoking cigars, evidently not of expensive variety, judging by the\nunaromatic atmosphere thereabouts.\n\n\"Can't see what Bland shipped us up to this one-horse dump for,\"\ngrumbled Skip Handlon, the one who carried the camera. He was the\nslighter of the two and perhaps half a head shorter than the other. \"Do\nyou know anything about it?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" confessed the other as they alighted from the smoker. \"All I\ncan tell you is that Bland sent for me early this morning, told me to\nget a story out of this Professor Kell and to drag you along. After we\nget there you are to do as judgment dictates. But I remember that the\nChief was specific as regards one thing. You are to get the proff's mug.\nDon't forget. The old fellow may growl and show fight, but it's up to\nyou to deliver the goods--or, in this case, get them. Don't depend on me\nfor help. I expect to have troubles of my own.\" Thus gloomed Horace\nPerry, star reporter for the Journal.\n\n\"This Keegan place\"--Handlon was using his eyes swiftly and\ncomprehensively--\"isn't worth much. Can't see how it manages to even\nrate a name. Some dump, all right!\"\n\n\"You said a couple mouthfuls.\"\n\n\"How's the train service, if any?\"\n\n\"Rotten. Two trains a day.\" The other was anything but enthusiastic.\n\"We've a nice long wait for the next one, you can bet. Now, just add to\nthat a rough reception after we reach the old lion's lair and you get a\nnice idea of what Bland expects from his men.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHandlon made a wry face at this. \"The bird who first applied the words\n'Hard Boiled' to the Chief's monniker knew something.\"\n\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" retorted Perry encouragingly. \"Just\nwait and see what a beaut of a fit he can throw for _your_ benefit if\nyou fail to do your stuff--and I don't mean maybe.\"\n\nOld Man Bland owned the Journal, hired and fired his crew and did his\nown editing, with the help of as capable an office gang as could be\ngotten together. It is quite possible that \"Hard Boiled\" Bland demanded\nmore from his men than any other editor ever has before or since.\nNevertheless he got results, and none of his experienced underlings ever\nkicked, for the pay was right. If a hapless scribe had the temerity to\nenter the editorial sanctum with a negative report, the almost\ninvariable reply had been a glare and a peremptory order, \"Get the\ncopy.\"\n\nAnd get it they did. If a person refused an interview these clever\nfellows generally succeeded in getting their information from the next\nmost reliable source, and it arrived in print just the same.\n\nOf such a breed was Perry. Handlon, being a more recent acquisition to\nthe staff, was not yet especially aggressive in his work. On this\naccount the former took keen zest in scaring him into displaying a bit\nmore sand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe train had disappeared around a bend and the two reporters felt\nthemselves marooned. Keegan, without question, was a most forlorn\nlooking spot. A dismal shanty, much the worse for weather, stood beside\nthe track. In front, a few rotting planks proclaimed that once upon a\ntime the place had boasted a real freight platform. Probably, back in\nsome long-forgotten age, a station agent had also held forth in the\nrickety shanty. A sign hung on each end of the crumbling structure on\nwhich could still be deciphered the legend \"KEEGAN.\" On the opposite\nside of the track was an old, disused siding. The only other feature of\ninterest thereabouts was a well traveled country road which crossed the\ntracks near the shanty, wound sinuously over a rock-strewn hill and\nbecame lost in the mazes of an upland forest.\n\nThere being no signboard of any kind to indicate their destination, the\ntwo, after a moment's hesitation, started off briskly in a chance\ndirection. The air was hot and sultry, and in the open spaces the sun\nbeat down mercilessly upon the two hapless ones. As they proceeded into\nthe depths of the forest they were shielded somewhat from the worst of\nthe heat. Gradually upon their city-bred nostrils there stole the odor\nof conifers, accompanied by a myriad of other forest odors. Both sniffed\nthe air appreciatively.\n\n\"This is sure the life,\" remarked Perry. \"If I weren't so darn thirsty\nnow....\" He became lost in mournful thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA considerable time passed. The newspaper men trudged wearily along\nuntil finally another bend brought them to the beginning of a steep\ndescent. The forest had thinned out to nothing.\n\n\"Seems to me I smell smoke,\" blurted out Handlon suddenly. \"Must be that\nwe are approaching the old party's lair. Remember? Bland said that\nhe--\"\n\n\"Uh huh!\" the other grunted, almost inaudibly. Now that they seemed to\nbe arriving at their destination something had occurred to him. He had\nfished from his pocket a sheaf of clippings and was perusing them\nintently. \"Bland said, 'Get the copy',\" he muttered irrelevantly and\nhalf to himself.\n\nThe clippings all related directly to Professor Kell or to happenings\nlocal to Keegan. Some were of peculiar interest. The first one was\nheadlined thus:\n\n    MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF ROBERT MANION AND DAUGHTER STILL\n    UNSOLVED\n\nThe piece contained a description of the missing man, a fairly\nprosperous banker who had been seen four days previously driving through\nKeegan in a small roadster, and one of the girl, who was in the car with\nhim. It told that the banker and his daughter were last seen by a farmer\nnamed Willetts who lived in a shack on the East Keegan road, fleeing\nbefore a bad thunder storm. He believed the pair were trying to make the\nKell mansion ahead of the rain. Nothing more of the Manions or their car\nhad been seen, and their personal effects remained at their hotel in a\nnearby village unclaimed. The heavy rain had of course effectually\nobliterated all wheel tracks.\n\nAnother clipping was fairly lengthy, but Perry glanced only at the\nheadlines:\n\n    KELL STILL CARRYING ON HIS STRANGE EXPERIMENTS\n\n    Has Long Been Known to Have Fantastic Theories. Refuses to\n    Divulge Exact Methods Employed, or Nature of Results\n\nStill another appeared to be an excerpt from an article in an\nagricultural paper. It read:\n\n    A prize bull belonging to Alton Shepard, a Keegan cattle\n    breeder, has created considerable sensation by running amuck in\n    a most peculiar manner. While seemingly more intelligent than\n    heretofore, it has developed characteristics known to be utterly\n    alien to this type of animal.\n\n    Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the case is the refusal\n    of the animal to eat its accustomed food. Instead it now\n    consumes enormous quantities of meat. The terrific bellow of\n    the animal's voice has also undergone a marked change, now\n    resembling nothing earthly, although some have remarked that it\n    could be likened to the bay of an enormous hound. Some of its\n    later actions have seemingly added further canine attributes,\n    which make the matter all the more mystifying. Veterinaries are\n    asking why this animal should chase automobiles, and why it\n    should carry bones in its mouth and try to bury them!\n\nThe last one read in part:\n\n    Professor Kell has been questioned by authorities at Keegan\n    relative to the disappearance there last Tuesday of Robert\n    Manion and his daughter. Kell seemed unable to furnish clues of\n    any value, but officials are not entirely satisfied with the\n    man's attitude toward the questions.\n\nSomewhat bewildered by these apparently unrelated items, the reporter\nremained lost in thought for quite a space, the while he endeavored to\nmap out his course of action when he should meet the redoubtable\nProfessor. That many of the weird occurrences could be traced in some\nway to the latter's door had evidently occurred to Bland. Furthermore,\nthe Old Man relied implicitly upon Perry to get results.\n\nIt must be said that for once the star reporter was not overly\nenthusiastic with the assignment. Certain rumors aside from the\nclippings in his hand had produced in his mind a feeling of uneasiness.\nSo far as his personal preference was concerned he would have been well\nsatisfied if some cub reporter had been given the job. Try as he would,\nhowever, he could offer no tangible reason for the sudden wariness.\n\nHe was aroused from his absorption by his companion.\n\n\"Thought I smelled smoke a while back, and I was right. That's the\nhouse up in the edge of the pines. Deep grounds in front and all gone to\nseed; fits the description exactly. Thank Heaven we struck off from the\nstation in the right direction. This stroll has been long enough. Come\nout of it and let's get this job finished.\"\n\nSuiting the action to the words Handlon started off at a brisk pace down\nthe hill, followed at a more moderate rate by Perry. At length they came\nwithin full sight of the grounds. Extending for a considerable distance\nbefore them and enclosing a large tract of land now well covered with\nlush grass, was a formidable looking wall. In former days a glorious\nmantle of ivy had covered the rough stones; but now there was little\nleft, and what there was looked pitifully decrepit. They continued their\nprogress along this barrier, finally coming upon a huge iron gate now\nmuch the worse for rust. It stood wide open.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe road up to the house had long since become overgrown with rank grass\nand weeds. Faintly traceable through the mass of green could be seen a\nrough footpath which the two followed carefully. They met no one. As\nthey approached the night of black pines the mass of the old mansion\nbegan to loom up before them, grim and forbidding.\n\nInstinctively both shivered. The silence of the place was complete and\nof an uncannily tangible quality. Nervously they looked about them.\n\n\"How do you like it, Skip?\" The words from Perry's previously silent\nlips broke upon the stillness like a thunderclap. The other started.\n\n\"I should hate to die in it,\" Handlon answered solemnly. \"I'll bet the\nold joint is haunted. Nobody but a lunatic would ever live in it.\"\n\n\"I get a good deal the same impression myself,\" said Perry. \"I don't\nwonder that Bland sent two of us to cover the job.\"\n\nAs he spoke he mounted a flight of steps to a tumbledown veranda. There\nwas no sign of a door bell on the weather-beaten portal, but an ancient\nknocker of bronze hanging forlornly before him seemed to suggest a means\nof attracting attention. He raised it and rapped smartly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo answer.\n\nPossessing all the attributes of the conventional reporter and a few\nadditional ones, Perry did not allow himself to become disheartened, but\nmerely repeated his summons, this time with more vim.\n\n\"Well, Horace,\" grinned Handlon, \"it does look as if we were not so very\nwelcome here. However, seems to me if you were to pick up that piece of\ndead limb and do some real knocking with it.... The dear Professor may\nbe deaf, you know, or maybe he's--\"\n\n\"Skip, my boy, I don't know as we ought to go in right now after all. Do\nyou realize it will soon be dark?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, Horace, I'm not stuck on this assignment either.\nAnd I feel that after dark I should like it even less, somehow. But,\ngee, the Old Man....\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not thinking of quitting on the job. We don't do that on the\nJournal.\" Perry smiled paternally at the photographer. Could it be he\nhad purposely raised the other's hopes in order to chaff him some more?\n\"But I was thinking that it might be a good idea to look about the\noutbuildings a bit while we have a little daylight. Eh?\"\n\nHandlon looked disappointed, but nodded gamely. He delayed only long\nenough to deposit his camera and traps behind a grossly overgrown\nhydrangea by the steps, then, with a resigned air, declared himself\nready to follow wherever the other might lead.\n\nPerry elected to explore the barn first. This was a depressing old pile,\nunpainted in years, with what had once been stout doors now swinging and\nbumping in the light breeze. As the two men drew nearer, this\nbreeze--which seemed to sigh through the place at will--brought foul\nodors that told them the place was at least not tenantless. In some\ntrepidation they stepped inside and stood blinking in the half\ndarkness.\n\n\"Pretty Polly!\"\n\n\"Good God! What was that?\" Handlon whispered. He knew it was no parrot's\nvoice. This was a far deeper sound than that, a sound louder than\nanything a parrot's throat could produce. It came from the direction of\na ruinous stall over near a cobwebbed window. As Perry started fearfully\ntoward this, there issued from it a curious scraping sound, followed by\na fall that shook the floor, and a threshing as of hoofs. Now the great\nvoice could be heard again, this time uttering what sounded strangely\nlike oaths roared out in a foreign tongue. Yet when the newspaper men\nreached the stall they found it occupied only by a large mule.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe animal was lying on its side, its feet scraping feebly against the\nside of the stall. The heaving, foam-flecked body was a mass of hideous\nbruises, some of which were bleeding profusely. The creature seemed to\nbe in the last stage of exhaustion, lying with lips drawn back and eyes\nclosed. Beneath it and scattered all over the stall floor was a thick\nlayer of some whitish seeds.\n\n\"That's--why that's sunflower seed, Horace!\" Handlon almost whimpered.\n\"And look! Look in that crib! It's full of the same stuff! Where's the\nhay, Horace? Does this thing--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a mighty movement of the beast--a threshing that\nnearly blinded the men in the cloud of bloodstained seeds it raised.\nWith something between a curse and a sob, the mule lunged at its crib as\nif attempting to get bodily into it. But no: it was only trying to perch\non its edge! Now it had succeeded. The ungainly beast hung there a\nsecond, two, three. From its uplifted throat issued that usually\ninnocuous phrase, a phrase now a thing of delirious horror:\n\n\"Pretty Polly!\"\n\nWith a crash the tortured creature fell to the floor, to lie there\ngasping and moaning.\n\nSkip Handlon left that barn. Perry retained just enough wit to do what\nhe should have done the instant he first saw the animal. He whipped out\nhis automatic and fired one merciful shot. Then he too started for the\noutside. He arrived in the yard perhaps ten seconds behind Handlon.\n\n\"Good Heavens, Perry,\" gibbered Handlon. \"I'm not going to stay around\nthis place another minute. Just let me find where I left that suffering\ncamera, that's all I ask.\"\n\n\"Easy now.\" Perry laid a hand on his companion's shoulder. \"I guess\nwe're up against something pretty fierce here, but we're going to see it\nthrough, and you know it. So let's cut out the flight talk and go raise\nthe Professor.\"\n\nHandlon tried earnestly to don a look of determination. If Perry was set\non staying here the least he could do was stay with him. However, could\nPerry have foreseen the events which were to entangle them, he probably\nwould have led the race to the gate. As it was, he grasped a stick and\nmarched bravely up toward the front door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sudden commotion behind him caused him to wheel sharply around.\nSimultaneously a yell burst from Handlon.\n\n\"Look out, Horace!\"\n\nWhat he saw almost froze the blood in his veins. From a tumbledown coach\nhouse had issued an enormous wolf-hound which was now almost upon then,\neyes flaming, fangs gleaming horribly.\n\nSo unexpected was the attack that both men stood rooted in their tracks.\nThe next moment the charging brute was upon them, and had bowled\nHandlon off his equilibrium as if he were a child. The unfortunate\nphotographer made a desperate attempt to prevent injury to his precious\ncamera, which he had but a moment earlier succeeded in retrieving, and\nin doing so fell rather violently to the ground. Every moment he\nexpected to feel the powerful jaws crunch his throat, and he made no\neffort to rise. For several seconds he remained thus, until he could\nendure the suspense no longer. He glanced around only to see Perry,\nstaring open-mouthed at the animal which had so frightened them.\nApparently it had forgotten the presence of the two men.\n\nHandlon regained his feet rather awkwardly, the while keeping a watchful\neye on the beast, of whose uncertain temper he was by now fully aware.\nIn an undertone he addressed his companion.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he wanted to know. \"Did the critter bite\nyou?\"\n\n\"No. That's the queer part of it. Neither did he bite you, if you were\nto think it over a minute. Just put his nose down and _rammed_ you, head\non.\"\n\nThe photographer was flabbergasted. Involuntarily his gaze stole again\nin the direction of the offending brute.\n\n\"What on earth--\" he began. \"Is he sharpening his teeth on a rock\npreparatory to another attack upon us? Or--What the deuce _is_ he\ndoing?\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" came astonishingly from the watchful Perry, \"he's\neating grass, which is my idea of something damn foolish for a perfectly\nnormal hound, genus lupo, to be--Look out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe animal, as if suddenly remembering the presence of the men, suddenly\ncharged at them again, head down, eyes blazing. As before, it made no\neffort to bite. Though both men were somewhat disconcerted by the great\nbrute they held their ground, and when it presented the opportunity the\nolder reporter planted a terrific kick to the flank which sent the\nanimal whimpering back to its shed behind.\n\n\"Score one,\" breathed Handlon. \"If we--\" At a sudden grating sound\noverhead, he stopped.\n\nBoth turned to face the threatening muzzle of an ancient blunderbuss.\nBehind it was an irate countenance, nearly covered by an unclipped beard\nof a dirty gray color. In the eyes now glaring at them malevolently\nthrough heavily concaved spectacles they read hate unutterable. The\nbarrel of the blunderbuss swung slightly as it covered alternately one\nand the other. Both sensed that the finger even now tightening on the\ntrigger would not hesitate unduly. Being more or less hardened to\nrebuffs of all kinds in the pursuance of their calling, the reporters\ndid not hesitate in stating their purpose.\n\n\"What?\" yelled the old man. \"You dare to invade my grounds and disturb\nme at my labors for such a reason? Reporters! My scientific research\nwork is not for publicity, sirs; and futhermore I want it understood\nthat I am not to be dragged from my laboratory again for the purpose of\nentertaining you or any others of your ilk. Get away!\"\n\nWithout further ado the window was slammed down, a shutter closed on the\ninside, and once more the silence of the dead descended upon the spot.\nThe two men grinned ruefully at each other, Handlon finally breaking the\nstillness.\n\n\"My idea of the world's original one-sided conversation. We simply\ndidn't talk--and yet we're supposed to be reporters. You've got to hand\nit to the Proff, Horace, for the beautiful rock-crusher he just handed\nus.\"\n\n\"You didn't think we had anything easy, did you?\" said Perry irritably.\n\"He'll change his tune presently, when--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHandlon's jaw dropped. \"You don't mean you're going to take any more\nchances! Would you rouse him again after the way he treated us with\nthat gun? Besides, the train....\"\n\nPerry bent a scathing glance at his companion. \"What on earth has the\ntrain to do with our getting the Professor's confession of crime or\nwhatever he has to offer? You evidently don't know Bland--much. I deduce\nthat a lot of my sweetness has been wasted on the desert air. Once more,\nlet me assure you that if you propose to go back without the Proff's mug\non one of those plates you might as well mail your resignation from\n_here_. Get me?\"\n\nThe other wilted.\n\n\"I wonder,\" Perry ruminated as he stared in the direction of the shed\nwherein the canine monstrosity had disappeared. \"Do you suppose that you\ncan get a snap of the old boy's mug if I can get him to the window\nagain? If you can do that, just leave the rest to me. I've handled these\ncrusty birds before. What say?\"\n\n\"Go as far as you like.\" The photographer was once more grinning as he\nunslung his camera and carefully adjusted a plate in place. Everything\nat last to his satisfaction he gripped flash pan and bulb.\n\n\"I'm going to make some racket now,\" announced Perry grimly. \"If Kell\nshows up, work fast. He may shoot at you, but don't get excited. It's\nalmost dark, so his aim _might_ be poor.\"\n\nAt this suggestion his companion showed signs of panic, but the other\naffected not to notice this. There came a deafening hullaballoo as Perry\nbeat a terrific tattoo on the ancient door. Followed a deep silence,\nwhile Perry leaped back to stand in front of Skip and his camera. After\nperhaps a full minute's wait he once more opened up his bombardment, to\njump quickly back to the camera as before. This time he had better\nsuccess. The window was again opened and the muzzle of the blunderbuss\nput in its appearance. Handlon stood close behind Perry as he silently\nswung the camera into a more favorable position for action. The face at\nthe window was purple with wrath.\n\n\"You damned pests! Leave my grounds at once or I shall call my hound and\nset him upon you. And when--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrack! Flash! Click! Perry had made a sudden sidewise movement as\nHandlon went into action.\n\n\"Much obliged, Professor,\" said Perry politely. \"Your pose with that old\ncannon is going to be very effective from the front page. The write-up\nwill doubtless be interesting too. Probably the story won't be quite so\naccurate as it would be had you told it to us yourself; but we shall get\nas many of the details from the natives hereabouts as we can. Good-day\nto you, sir!\"\n\nMotioning to the other he turned on his heel and started down the\ndriveway. It was an old trick, and for a long moment of suspense he\nalmost feared that it would fail. Another moment--\n\n\"Wait!\" The quavering voice of the irascible old villain had lost some\nof its malice. \"Come back here a minute.\"\n\nWith simulated reluctance the two slowly retraced their steps. \"Is there\nsomething else, sir?\"\n\n\"Perhaps....\" The old man hesitated, as if pondering upon his words.\n\"Perhaps if you care to step in I can be of assistance to you after all.\nIt occurs to me that possibly I have been too abrupt with you.\"\n\n\"I am very glad that you have decided to cooperate with us, Professor\nKell,\" answered the reporter heartily, as they ascended the steps. The\nold man's head disappeared from the window and shortly the sound of\nfootsteps inside told of his approach. Finally the oaken door swung\nopen, and they were silently ushered into the musty smelling hallway.\nThough outwardly accepting the Professor's suddenly pacific attitude,\nPerry made up his mind to be on his guard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they entered what had evidently been the parlor in bygone days, an\noppressive, heavy odor smote their nostrils, telling of age-old carpets\nand of draperies allowed to decay unnoticed. On the walls hung several\nantique prints, a poorly executed crayon portrait of a person doubtless\nan ancestor of the present Kell, and one or two paintings done in oil,\nnow badly cracked and stained. Everything gave the impression of an era\nlong since departed, and the two men felt vaguely out of place. Their\nhost led them to a pair of dilapidated chairs, which they accepted\ngratefully. The ride to Keegan after a hard day's work had not tended to\nimprove their spirits.\n\n\"Now to business.\" Perry went straight to the point, desiring to get the\ninterview over as soon as possible. \"We have heard indirectly of various\nhappenings in this vicinity which many think have some connection with\nyour scientific experiments. Any statement you may care to make to us in\nregard to these happenings will be greatly appreciated by my paper.\nInasmuch as what little has already been printed is probably of an\nerroneous nature, we believe it will be in your own best interest to\ngive us as complete data as possible.\" Here he became slightly\nhistrionic. \"Of course we do not allow ourselves to take the stories\ntold by the local inhabitants too literally, as such persons are too\nliable to exaggerate, but we must assume that some of these stories have\npartial basis in fact. Any information relative to your scientific work,\nincidentally, will make good copy for us also.\"\n\nPerry gazed steadily at the patriarch as he spoke. For a moment, a\ncrafty expression passed over the old man's face, but as suddenly it\ndisappeared. Evidently he had arrived at a decision.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he wheezed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two newspaper men exchanged swift glances, the same thought in the\nmind of each. Were they about to be led into a trap? If the old man's\nshady reputation was at all deserved they would do well to be wary.\nPerry thought swiftly of the clippings he had read and of what gossip he\nhad heard, then glanced once more in the direction of Handlon. That\nworthy was smiling meaningly and had already arisen to follow the\nProfessor. Reluctantly Perry got to his feet and the three proceeded to\nclimb a rickety stairway to the third floor. The guide turned at the\nhead of the stairs and entered a long dark corridor. Here the floor was\ncovered with a thick carpet which, as they trod upon it, gave forth not\nthe slightest sound.\n\nThe hall gave upon several rooms, all dark and gloomy and giving the\nsame dismal impression of long disuse. How could the savant endure such\na depressing abode! The accumulation of dust and cobwebs in these long\nforgotten chambers, the general evidence of decay--all told of possible\nhorrors ahead. They became wary.\n\nBut they were not wary enough!\n\nThe uncouth figure ahead of them had stopped and was fumbling with the\nlock of an ancient door. Instinctively Perry noted that it was of great\nthickness and of heavy oak. Now the Professor had it open and was\nmotioning for them to enter. Handlon started forward eagerly, but\nhurriedly drew back as he felt the grip of the other reporter's hand on\nhis arm.\n\n\"Get back, you fool!\" The words were hissed into the ear of the\nincautious one. Then, to the Professor, Perry observed: \"If you have no\nobjection we would prefer that you precede us.\"\n\nA look of insane fury leaped to the face of the old man, lingered but an\ninstant and was gone. Though the expression was but momentary, both men\nhad seen, and seeing had realized their danger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey followed him into the chamber, which was soon illumined fitfully by\na smoky kerosene lamp. Both took a rapid survey of the place.\nConceivably it might have been the scene of scientific experiments, but\nits aspect surely belied such a supposition. The average imagination\nwould instantly pronounce it the abode of a maniac, or the lair of an\nalchemist. Again, that it might be the laboratory of an extremely\nslovenly veterinary was suggested by the several filthy cages to be seen\nresting against the wall. All of these were unoccupied except one in a\ndark corner, from which issued a sound of contented purring, evidently\ntelling of some well-satisfied cat.\n\nThe air was close and foul, being heavy with the odor of musty, decaying\ndrugs. In every possible niche and cranny the omnipresent dust had\nsettled in a uniform sheen of gray which showed but few signs of recent\ndisturbance.\n\n\"Here, gentlemen,\" their host was saying, \"is where I carry on my work.\nIt is rather gloomy here after dark, but then I do not spend much time\nhere during the night. I have decided to acquaint you with some of the\ndetails of one or two of my experiments. Doubtless you will find them\ninteresting.\"\n\nWhile speaking he had, mechanically it seemed, reached for a glass\nhumidor in which were perhaps a dozen cigars. Silently he selected one\nand extended the rest to the two visitors.\n\nAfter all three had puffed for a moment at the weeds, the old man began\nto talk, rapidly it seemed to them. Perry from time to time took notes,\nas the old man proceeded, an expression of utter amazement gradually\noverspreading his face. Handlon pulled away contentedly at his cigar,\nand on his features there grew an almost ludicrous expression of\nwell-being. Was the simple photographer so completely at ease that he\nhad at length forsaken all thought of possible danger?\n\nAs Professor Kell talked on he seemed to warm to his subject. At the end\nof five minutes he began uncovering a peculiar apparatus which had\nrested beneath the massive old table before which they were sitting. The\ntwo men caught the flash of light on glass, and a jumble of coiled wires\nbecame visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas the air in the laboratory getting unbearably close? Or was the queer\nleaden feeling that had taken possession of Perry's lungs but an\nindication of his overpowering weariness? He felt a steadily increasing\nirritation, as if for some strange reason he suddenly resented the words\nof their host, which seemed to be pouring out in an endless stream. The\ncigar had, paradoxically, an oddly soothing quality, and he puffed away\nin silence.\n\nWhy had the room suddenly taken on so hazy an aspect? Why did Handlon\ngrin in that idiotic manner? And the Professor ... he was getting\nfarther and farther away ... that perfecto ... or was it an El Cabbajo?\nWhat was the old archfiend doing to him anyhow?... Why was he laughing\nand leering at them so horribly?... Confound it all ... that cigar ...\nwhere was it?... Just one more puff....\n\nBlindly he groped for the missing weed, becoming aware of a cackle of\namusement nearby. Professor Kell was standing near the spot where he had\nfallen and now began prodding him contemptuously with his toe.\n\n\"Fools!\" he was saying. \"You thought to interfere with my program. But\nyou are in my power and you have no hope of escape. I am unexpectedly\nprovided with more subjects for my experiments. You will....\" His words\nbecame hazy and unintelligible, for the hapless reporter was drifting\noff into a numb oblivion. He had long since lost the power to move a\nmuscle. Out of the corner of an eye, just before he lost consciousness\naltogether, he perceived Handlon lying upon the floor still puffing at\nthe fateful drugged cigar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEons passed.\n\nTo the reporter came a vision of a throbbing, glaring inferno, wherein\nhe was shaken and tossed by terrific forces. His very vital essence\nseemed to respond to a mighty vibration. Now he was but a part of some\nterrific chaos. Dimly he became aware of another being with whom he must\ncontend. Now he was in a death struggle, and to his horror he found\nhimself being slowly but surely overpowered. A demoniac grin played upon\nthe features of the other as he forced the reporter to his knees. It was\nHandlon.... Once more he was sinking into soft oblivion, the while a\nhorrid miasma assailed his nostrils. He was nothing....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly, and with infinite effort, Perry felt himself returning to\nconsciousness, though he had no clear conception of his surroundings.\nHis brain was as yet but a whirling vortex of confused sounds, colors\nand--yes, odors. A temporary rift came in the mental cloud which\nfettered his faculties, and things began to take definite shape. He\nbecame aware that he was lying upon his back at some elevation from the\nfloor. Again the cloudy incubus closed in and he knew no more.\n\nWhen he finally recovered the use of his faculties it was to discover\nhimself the possessor of a violent headache. The pain came in such\nfearsome throbs that it was well nigh unendurable. The lamp still\nsputtered dimly where the professor had left it. At the moment it was on\nthe point of going out altogether. The reporter noticed this, and over\nhim stole a sense of panic. What if the light should fail altogether,\nleaving him lying in the dark in this frightful place! Still dizzy and\nsick, he managed to rise upon his elbows enough to complete a survey of\nthe room. He was still in the laboratory of Professor Kell, but that\nworthy had disappeared. Of Handlon there was no sign. The mysterious\napparatus, of which he now had but a vague remembrance, also had\nvanished.\n\nHis thoughts became confused again, and wearily he passed a hand over\nhis brow in the effort to collect all of his faculties. The lamp began\nto sputter, arousing him to action. Desperately he fought against the\nbenumbing sensation that was even again stealing over him. Gradually he\ngained the ascendancy. He struggled dizzily to his feet and took a few\ntentative steps.\n\nWhere was Handlon? He decided his friend had probably recovered from the\ndrug first and was gone, possibly to get a doctor for him, Perry.\nHowever, he must make some search to determine if Skip had really left\nthe premises.\n\nAs he walked through the open door the lamp in his hand gave a last\ndespairing flicker and went out. From there he was forced to grope his\nway down the dark hall to the stairs. Just how he reached the lower\nfloor he was never able to remember, for as yet all the effect of the\npowerful drug had not worn off. He had a dim recollection of being\nthankful to the ancestor of Kell who had provided such thick carpets in\nthese halls. Thanks to them his footsteps had been noiseless, at any\nrate.\n\nWhat was Kell's real object in giving them those drugged cigars? he\nwondered. How long had they been under the influence of the lethal\nstuff? Surely several hours. Upon glancing through a hall window he\nfound that outside was the blackness of midnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCautiously he explored the desolate chambers on the ground floor: the\nkitchen--where it could be plainly seen that cooking of a sort had been\ndone--the barn, and woodshed. Not a living thing could he find, not even\nthe huge wolf-hound which had attacked them in so strange a manner that\nafternoon.\n\nBy now he was quite frankly worried on Handlon's account. At that\nmoment, could he have known the actual fate that had overtaken his\ncompanion, it is quite probable he would have gone mad. He stumbled\nback and into the dark front hall, shouting his friend's name. The\nresponse was a hollow echo, and once or twice he thought he heard the\nghost of a mocking chuckle.\n\nAt length he gave up the search and started for the door, intent now\nonly upon flight from the accursed place. He would report the whole\nthing to the office and let Bland do what he pleased about it. Doubtless\nHandlon had already left. Then he stumbled over Handlon's camera.\nEvidently the Professor had neglected to take possession of it. That\nmust be rescued, at all costs. He picked it up and felt the exposed\nplate still inside. He started again for the door.\n\nWhat little light there was faded out and he felt stealing over him a\nhorrid sensation of weakness. Again came a period of agony during which\nhe felt the grip of unseen forces. Once more it seemed that he was\nengaged in mortal strife with Skip Handlon. Malevolently Handlon glared\nat him as he endeavored with all his strength to overcome Perry. This\ntime, however, the latter seemed to have more strength and resisted the\nattack for what must have been hours. Finally the other drew away\nbaffled.\n\nAt this the mental incubus surrounding Perry's faculties broke. Dimly he\nbecame aware of a grinding noise nearby and a constant lurching of his\nbody. At length his vision cleared sufficiently to enable him to\ndiscover the cause of the peculiar sensations.\n\nHe was in a railroad coach!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe took a rapid glance around and noted a drummer sitting in the seat\nacross the aisle, staring curiously at him. With an effort Perry assumed\nan inscrutable expression and determined to stare the other out of\ncountenance. Reluctantly the man glanced away, and after a moment, under\nPerry's stony gaze, he suddenly arose and chose a new seat in front of\nthe car. Perry took to the solace of a cigarette and stared out at the\nflying telegraph poles. From time to time he noted familiar landmarks.\nThe train had evidently left Keegan far behind and was already nearly\ninto the home town.\n\nFor the balance of the ride the reporter experienced pure nightmare. The\npeculiar sensations of dizziness, accompanied by frightful periods of\ninsensibility, kept recurring, now, however, not lasting more than ten\nor fifteen minutes at a time. At such times as he was conscious he found\nopportunity to wonder in an abstracted sort of way how he had ever\nmanaged to get on the train and pay his fare, which must have been a\ncash one, without arousing the conductor's suspicions. Discovery of a\nrebate in his pocket proved that he must have done so, however. The\nbusiness of leaving the train and getting to the office has always been\nan unknown chapter in Perry's life.\n\nHe came out of one of his mental fogs to find himself seated in the\nprivate editorial sanctum of the Journal. Evidently he had just arrived.\nBland, a thick-set man with the jaw of a bulldog, was eyeing him\nintently.\n\n\"Well! Any report to make?\" The question was crisp.\n\nThe reporter passed a hand across his perspiring forehead. \"Yes, I guess\nso. I--er--that is--you see--\"\n\n\"Where's Handlon? What happened to you? You act as if you were drunk.\"\nBland was not in an amiable mood.\n\n\"Search me,\" Perry managed to respond. \"If Skip isn't here old man Kell\nmust have done for him. I came back alone.\"\n\n\"You wha-a-t?\" the irate editor fairly roared, half rising from his\nchair. \"Tell me exactly what happened and get ready to go back there on\nthe next train. Or--no, on second thoughts you'd better go to bed. You\nlook all used up. Handlon may be dead or dying at this minute. That Kell\ncould do anything.\" He pressed the button on his desk.\n\n\"Johnny,\" he said to the office boy, \"get O'Hara in here on the double\nquick and tell him to bring along his hat and coat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned again to Perry, who was gazing nervously at the door. \"Now\ntell me everything that happened and make it fast,\" he ordered.\n\nThe reporter complied, omitting nothing except the little matter of his\nmental lapses at the house of Professor Kell and later on the train. The\nincident of the drugged cigars seemed to interest the Old Man hugely,\nand Perry did not forget to play up Handlon's exploits in getting the\npicture of the Professor. All through the recital he was in a sweat for\nfear that he might have a recurrence of one of his brain spells and that\nBland would become cognizant of it. When would the Chief finish and let\nhim escape from the office? Desperately he fought to prevent the numbing\nsensation from overcoming him. All that kept him from finally fleeing\nthe place in panic was the entrance of Jimmie O'Hara.\n\nSlight, wiry and efficient looking, this individual was a specimen of\nthe perfect Journal reporter. This is saying a good deal, for the news\ncrew and editorial force of the paper were a carefully selected body of\nmen indeed. Bland never hired a man unless experience had endowed him\nwith some unusual qualification. Most of them could write up a story\nwith realistic exactitude, being able in most cases to supply details\ngleaned from actual experience in one walk of life or another.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf this redoubtable crew probably the queerest was Jimmie O'Hara. Jimmie\nhad just finished a sentence in the \"pen\" for safe-cracking at the time\nhe landed the job with the Journal. Theoretically all men should have\nshunned him on account of his jailbird taint. Not so Bland. The Chief\nwas independent in his ideas on the eternal fitness of things and\nallowed none of the ordinary conventions of humanity to influence his\ndecisions. So Jimmie became one of the staff and worked hard to justify\nBland in hiring him. His former profession gave him valuable sidelights\nupon crime stories of all kinds, and he was almost invariably picked as\nthe man to write these up for the columns.\n\n\"Jimmie,\" said the Chief, \"we have need of an experienced strong-arm man\nand all around second story worker. You are the only man on the force\nwho fills the bill for this job. Perry here has just returned from\nKeegan, where I sent him to interview Professor Kell. Skip Handlon went\nwith him, but failed to return. We want to know what happened to Skip.\nThat is your job. _Get Handlon!_ If he is dead let me know by long\ndistance phone and I'll have a couple of headquarters men down there in\na hurry. Get a good fast car and don't waste any time. That's all.\"\n\nO'Hara stopped long enough to get the location of Professor Kell's place\nfixed in his mind, then abruptly departed. Bland gazed after him\nmusingly.\n\n\"The Professor will have some job to put anything over on that bird,\" he\nsaid grimly. \"Personally, I'm sorry for the old soul.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter leaving the Journal office Jimmie proceeded directly to a certain\nstable where he kept his private car. It was a long, low speedster with\na powerful engine, and capable of eating up distance. It was the work of\na minute to touch the starter and back out of the yard.\n\nFor the next hour he held the wheel grimly while the car roared over the\nseventy-odd miles to Keegan. Would he be in time? At last a sign post\ntold him that he was within five miles of the railroad crossing at\nKeegan. Now the headlights were picking out the black outlines of the\nfreight shed, and the next moment he had swept over the tracks. The\nluminous dial on his wrist watch notified him that he had been on the\nroad but little over an hour, but his spirits somehow refused to revive\nwith the knowledge.\n\nAbout a mile beyond the station he drove the car into a dark wood road\nand parked it, turning off all lights. The rest of the way to the\nProfessor's mansion he did on foot. Rather than approach from the front\nof the grounds he nimbly climbed a stone wall and, crossing a field or\ntwo, entered the stretch of woods which extended just behind the\nmansion. His pocket flashlight here came into use, and once or twice he\ngave a reassuring pat to a rear pocket where bulged a heavy Colt\nautomatic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was that? He had approached very close to the rear of the house\nnow. No lights were visible as yet, but unless he was greatly mistaken\nhe had heard a muffled scream. He stopped in his tracks and listened\nintently. Again it came, this time with a blood-curdling cadence ending\nin what he would have sworn was a choking sob.\n\nThe little job of getting the old-fashioned rear window open was a mere\nnothing to the experienced O'Hara, and in a moment he was inside the\nhouse. His feet struck soft carpet. Catlike, he stepped to one side in\norder to prevent any hidden eyes from perceiving his form silhouetted in\nthe dim light of the open window. He dared not use his flashlight for\nfear that the circle of light would betray his position, thus making him\nan excellent target for possible bullets. Following the wall closely he\nmanaged to circle the room without mishap. His searching fingers finally\ncame in contact with a door frame, and he breathed a sigh of relief.\nHere there was nothing to bar his progress except some moth-eaten\nportieres. These he brushed aside.\n\nThe room which he now entered was probably the same into which the\nProfessor had ushered Handlon and Perry the day before. There being\nstill no sign of life about, the reporter decided to throw caution to\nthe winds. He brought his flash into play. Quickly casting the powerful\nbeam around the chamber he examined the place with an all-searching\nglance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing.\n\nWith a stifled oath he turned his attention to the other rooms in the\nimmediate vicinity. The brilliant light revealed not the slightest trace\nof a person, living or dead. The sound must have come from the second\nstory or from the cellar. He decided on the upper floor.\n\nFeverish with impatience because of the valuable time he had already\nlost, he bounded up the heavily carpeted stairs two at a time. Now to\nhis keen ears came certain faint sounds which told him that he was on\nthe right track. Before him extended a long, dusty hall, terminating in\na single heavy door. Several other doors opened at intervals along the\ncorridor. One or two of these were open, and he threw the beam from his\nflash hastily into one after another of them. He saw only dusty and\nmildewed chamber furnishings of an ancient massive style.\n\nSuddenly he pricked up his ears.\n\nThe door ahead of him was creaking slowly open. Instantly he extinguished\nhis torch and leaped into the nearest room. Whoever was opening that end\ndoor was carrying a lamp. What if the Professor had accomplices who\nmight discover him and overpower him by force of numbers! O'Hara drew the\nautomatic from his pocket, deriving a comforting assurance from the\nfeel of the cold steel. Here was something no man could resist could he\nbut get it into action. The light was now nearly abreast of his door, and\nfor a sickening instant he thought the prowler was coming into the room.\nHe held his breath. Now the lamp was at the open door, and now it was\nquickly withdrawn. After a breathless second he tip-toed forward and\npeered cautiously down the hallway.\n\nAbout here it was that James O'Hara began to realize that this was\ngoing to be a horrible night indeed. He had wondered why the progress of\nthe light had been so deathly slow. Now he knew why, by reason of what\nhe saw--and what he saw made him feel rather sick. The man with the\nlantern was quite plainly Professor Kell, bent nearly double with the\nweight of a grotesquely big thing on his back, a thing that flung a dim,\ncontorted shadow on the ceiling. And that thing was a dead man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA corpse it was--the attitude proved that. With a numb relief O'Hara\nrealized it was not the body of Skip Handlon. This had been a much\nlarger man than Skip, and the clothing was different from anything\nHandlon had worn.\n\nThe light was now disappearing down the stairway. For a moment O'Hara\nfelt undecided as to his next move. Should he follow Kell and his\nburden, or should he not take advantage of this fine opportunity to\ncontinue his search of the upper story? That scream still rang in his\nears; there had been a very evident feminine quality in it, and the\nremembrance of that fact reproached him. Had he been guilty of mincing\ndaintily about in this old house while a woman was being done to death\nunder his nose, when a little bolder action on his part might have saved\nher?\n\nStepping once more into the hall he advanced to the door just closed\nbehind the Professor and tried it, only to find it locked. Out of a\npocket came several articles best known to the \"profession\"--a piece of\nstiff wire, a skeleton key and other paraphernalia calculated to reduce\nthe obstinate mechanism to submission. For a minute, two, three, he\nworked at the ancient lock; then, without a creak, the door swung open.\nA touch of oil to the hinges had insured their silence. Jimmie O'Hara\nbelieved in being artistic in his work, especially when it came to fine\npoints, and he was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found himself in the same room where the drugged cigars had been\nproved the undoing of Handlon and Perry. In order not to alarm the\nProfessor unduly by chance noises and perhaps invite a surprise attack\nupon himself, O'Hara closed the laboratory door behind him and let the\nlock spring again. Hastily he made search of the place. No trace of the\nmissing reporter could he find, except two half-consumed cigars in a\ncorner whence the Professor had impatiently kicked them.\n\nOn the big table in the center of the room, however, was an object which\nexcited his interest. It was apparently nothing more or less than a\ngiant Crookes tube, connected in some way with a complicated mechanism\ncontained in a wooden cabinet under the table. Probably this apparatus\nwas concerned in the Professor's weird experiments which had so aroused\nthe countryside. He studied it curiously, his eyes for the moment closed\nin thought, until a slight sound somewhere near at hand caused him to\nopen them wide. Was the Kell returning?\n\nQuickly he extinguished the lamp and glided to a nearby door, thinking\nto secrete himself here, and take Kell by surprise. To his consternation\nthe door swung inward at a touch. He prepared instinctively for battle\nagainst any foe who might present himself. For a moment he held himself\ntaut; then, nothing of an alarming nature having happened, he drew a\nswift breath of relief and flashed on his light. He gave vent to a low\nexclamation. The swiftly darting shaft from the torch had revealed the\nfigure of a girl, bound and gagged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl lay trembling on a wretched bed in a corner of the dilapidated\nold chamber. O'Hara crossed the room and bent over her. Still wary of a\ntrap he glanced back in the direction of the laboratory door: all safe\nthere. Jimmie made haste to remove the cruel gag from her mouth.\n\n\"Courage,\" he whispered. \"Half a minute and you will be free.\"\n\nHe produced a knife with a suspiciously long blade and cut her bonds. He\nthen assisted her to her feet, where she reeled dizzily. Realizing the\nneed for fast action he made her sit down while he massaged the bruised\narms and ankles, which were badly swollen from the tight ropes. The girl\nhad apparently been in the grip of such terrible fright that she had\ntemporarily lost her power of speech. Mentally he chalked up another\nscore against the Professor as the girl made several ineffectual\nattempts to speak.\n\n\"Easy, kid,\" Jimmie whispered. \"Just sit tight, and when you feel able\nyou can tell me all about it. I'm going to get him good for this, you\ncan bank on that.\"\n\nShe thanked him with a faint smile, and of a sudden she found her\nvoice.\n\n\"Who are you? Where is father? Oh, tell me, please! I am afraid that\nhorrible man has murdered him. Are you a servant here? Oh, I don't know\nwhom to trust.\"\n\n\"My name is Jimmie O'Hara,\" replied the reporter briefly; \"and I hope\nyou won't worry about me. I am gunning for the Proff myself. Tell me as\nquickly as you can what you know about him.\" He still kept an eye on the\ndoor of the adjoining laboratory. Any moment he expected to hear the\nsound of the old man's approach. The room would make an ideal place to\nambush the maniac, he had swiftly decided.\n\n\"I am Norma Manion. Please don't delay, but see if you can locate\nfather.\" The girl's voice was agonized. \"I heard him groan a half-hour\nago, and a little later came a terrific crash. Oh, I'm afraid he's\ndead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReluctantly Jimmie gave up the idea of ambushing the Professor.\n\n\"Wait here,\" he commanded curtly. \"If you hear a shot join me as soon as\nyou can. I want to take him alive if I can, but....\" With this parting\nhint he disappeared through the door into the laboratory. Down the\ncarpeted hall he crept to the stairway. Here he stopped and listened,\nbut to his sensitive ears came no sound from below.\n\n\"Must have gone down the cellar with the body,\" he muttered. \"Here goes\nfor a general exploration.\"\n\nWith more boldness than the occasion perhaps really justified he\ndescended the stairs and proceeded to examine the ground floor rooms\nminutely. The first was the room through which he had made entrance to\nthe house. It proved to be but a storeroom containing nothing of\ninterest, and he soon decided to waste no more time on it.\n\nThe adjoining chamber, however, yielded some surprising finds. He had\npushed back a dusty portiere to find himself in what could be\nnothing less than the Professor's sleeping chamber. At present the\nbed was unoccupied, though it showed signs of recent use. The\nelectric torch played swiftly over every possible corner which could\nconstitute a hiding place for an assassin, revealing nothing. Now\nthe ever-searching ray fell upon an old-fashioned dresser, on which\nwas piled a miscellaneous array of articles. Here were combs, brushes,\na wig, a huge magnifying glass, and a gold watch. With a barely\nsuppressed exclamation, Jimmie pounced upon the gold timepiece.\n\nHandlon's! So well did he know the particular design of his watch that\nhe could have recognized it in the dark by sense of touch alone. So the\nold man was not averse to robbery among his other activities! The former\ntwo-story man thought fast. Handlon had probably been done in, and the\nbody had been disposed of in some weird manner. The only thing that\nremained to be done, since the unlucky photographer was evidently past\nhuman help, was to cut short the Professor's list of murders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the intention of missing no essential detail O'Hara swept the ray\nof the searchlight around the chamber once more, but discovered no more\nof importance. Deciding that the sleeping chamber could yield no further\nclue he shut off the tell-tale ray and stepped noiselessly back into the\nnext room. Here he groped his way around until he encountered a door,\nwhich stood open. A moment's cautious exploration with an outstretched\nfoot revealed the top step of a descending staircase. No faintest\nglimmer of light was visible, but muffled sounds proceeding from the\ndepths told him that someone was below.\n\nWith infinite care, feeling his way gingerly over the rickety old steps\nand fearful that an unexpected creak from one of the ancient boards\nwould at any moment prove his undoing, he commenced the descent. Once a\nboard did groan softly, causing him to stop in his tracks and stand with\nbated breath. He listened for sign of a movement below, while his heart\nloudly told off a dozen strokes. Stealthily he continued his progress,\nuntil finally soft earth under his feet told him he had reached the\ncellar bottom.\n\nNow his straining eyes perceived a tiny bit of light, and simultaneously\nhe became conscious of a deathly stench. The damp earth padding his\nfootsteps, he advanced swiftly toward the source of light, which now\nseemed to lie in stripes across his line of vision. He soon saw that the\nstairs gave upon a small boarded-off section of the cellar proper, and\nlight was seeping between the boards. Ah, and here was a rickety door,\nfortuitously equipped with a large knot-hole. O'Hara applied an eye to\nthis--and what he saw nearly ruined even his cast iron nerve.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Professor was working beside a heavy wooden cask, from which issued\nthe horrible stench. From time to time a sodden thud told that he was\nhacking something to pieces with an ax. Now and then he would strain\nmightily at a dark and bulky thing which lay on the floor, a thing that\nrequired considerable strength to lift. It seemed to be getting lighter\nafter each spasm of frenzied chopping. For a second Kell's shadow\nwavered away from the thing, and the enervated newspaper man saw it\nplainly. His senses almost left him as he realized that he was\nwitnessing the dismemberment of a human body.\n\nAs he hacked the fragments of tissue from the torso the fiend carefully\ndeposited each in the huge cask. At such times a faint boiling sound was\nheard, and there arose an effluvium that bade fair to overcome even the\nmonster engaged in the foul work. At last the limbs and head had been\nentirely removed. The Professor evidently decided that the trunk should\nbe left whole, and he put his entire strength into the job of getting it\ninto the cask. It was almost more than he could negotiate, but finally a\ndull splash told that he had succeeded.\n\nAt this moment Jimmie O'Hara came out of his trance. The horrible\nproceeding had left him faint and shaken, and he wished heartily that he\ncould leave the disgusting place as fast as his legs could carry him.\nBut there was still work to be done and he resolved to get it over.\n\nThe lantern! First he must put that out of commission. The maniac would\nthen be at his mercy. Slowly, steadily he stole through the doorway, his\neyes glued to the Professor's back. Now he was within a yard of the\nlantern, and he drew back his foot for the kick.\n\nNext moment Jimmie found himself gazing into the glaring eyes of his\nintended victim. Instinctively he struck out with the clubbed automatic,\nbut the blow must have fallen short, or else the Professor had developed\nan uncanny agility. Now to his horror he saw the flashing blade of the\nbloodstained ax raised on high. He had no time to dodge the blow. He\npressed the trigger of the Colt from the position in which he held it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bullet grazed the upraised arm. The ax fell toward O'Hara from\nfingers lacking strength to retain it, and he grasped it by the handle\nin midair. The next moment the assassin collected his wits and sprang at\nhim. Silently, the breath of both coming in gasps, the two men strove,\neach clawing desperately at the other's throat. The reporter fought with\nthe knowledge that should he lose he would never again see the light of\nday, the other with the fear of the justice that would deal with him.\n\nThe maniac hugged his arms tightly about Jimmie, pinioning him so\ntightly that the reporter could not use his gun. At length their\nconvulsive movements brought the men close to the lantern, and the next\ninstant the cellar was plunged in darkness. A second later the Professor\ntripped over some hidden obstruction and fell, dragging his opponent\nwith him to the earthen floor. To Jimmie's surprise there was no further\nmovement from the body beneath him. Could the old villain be playing\npossum? He cautiously shifted his hold and grasped the hidden throat. He\npressed the Professor's windpipe for a moment, but there was no\nanswering struggle. Slowly the truth dawned upon him. The heavy fall to\nthe floor had rendered the older man insensible.\n\nHe must work fast. Reaching into his pocket he brought out the ever\nhandy electric torch and flashed it over the features of his prisoner.\nKell was breathing heavily. With dexterous hands O'Hara swiftly went\nthrough the old man's pockets, removing all which might tend to make\nthat worthy dangerous--an ugly looking pistol of large caliber, a\nblackjack similar to his own and a small bottle.\n\nThe latter item Jimmie examined curiously, finally uncorking it and\ninhaling the contents. He inhaled, not wisely but too well. The fumes\nfrom the vial were nigh overpowering, and he reeled back nauseated. The\ncork he hastily replaced. Just what the nature of the powerful stuff\nwas he never attempted to discover. One acquaintance was enough.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe staggered to his feet and got the lantern lighted, then sat, gun in\nhand, waiting for his prisoner's return to his senses. This was becoming\nincreasingly imminent, judging by certain changes in the Professor's\nrespiration. Finally there came a series of shuddering movements as the\nman attempted to raise his battered body.\n\n\"Get up, you damned butcher,\" ordered Jimmie, \"and march upstairs. And\njust remember that I've got you covered; don't make any false moves.\" He\nprodded the prostrate form of the by now glaring fiend before him. The\nstench of the place was nearly overcoming him, and again he felt an\noverwhelming desire to dash madly from that den of evil, and once more\nbreathe God's fresh air. Under the stimulus of several shoves the\nProfessor finally won to his feet and stumbled up the stairs. Jimmie was\ntaking no chances and kept the automatic sharply digging into the ribs\nof his prisoner. The fight, however, seemed temporarily to have been all\ntaken out of the old man, and he made no resistance as the reporter\ndrove him on up to the laboratory.\n\nThe room he found exactly as he left it. At a word from him Norma Manion\ncame from her hiding place in the horrible room where she had been kept\nprisoner.\n\nWith an hysterical scream she fell limply to the floor. The sight of her\nfather's murderer had proved too much for her. Forgetting his prisoner\nfor the moment Jimmie sprang to the girl's side.\n\nKell chose this moment to make a dash for freedom. His footsteps,\nhowever, were not as noiseless as he had intended, and O'Hara whirled\njust in time to see his quarry about to throw open the hall door. Jimmie\ndove for his gun, only to encounter the Professor's mysterious vial,\nwhich, though forgotten, still lay in his pocket. With no time to\nthink, he acted purely upon instinct. His arm drew back and the bottle\nflew straight for the Professor's head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy a miracle the missile missed its mark. Came a shivering crash, as the\nbottle struck a stud in the massive door. Of a sudden recalling the\nterrific potency of the contents of that particular bottle, Jimmie\ngasped in dismay. Norma Manion's safety drove every other thought from\nhis mind. At any cost he must remove her from the proximity of those\nlethal fumes.\n\nHastily and without a backward glance, he gathered the girl into his\narms and dashed into the room where he had first found her. Ascertaining\nthat she had but swooned he placed her gently on the bed. In some\nperplexity as to his next move he stared at the beautiful face now so\nwan and white. Queer that he hadn't noticed the fact before--she was\nbeautiful. He even took a second look, then noting a continued absence\nof all sound from the laboratory decided to investigate.\n\nGingerly he pushed open the door, sniffing the air cautiously as he\nadvanced. To his nostrils gradually came a slight scent, which though\nalmost imperceptible made his senses reel. As he approached the hall\ndoor he found the atmosphere heavy with the soporific vapors from the\nbroken vial, and he staggered drunkenly.\n\nHe gave a start of surprise. On the floor, lying in a grotesque huddle\nwhich suggested a most unpleasant possibility, was the inert body of\nProfessor Kell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJimmie bent over the body and put an experienced ear to the heart. Yes,\nthere as a faint beat--very faint. Even as he listened he perceived a\nslight increase in the respiration. Now the breath began coming in\ngreat, choking gasps, only to die suddenly to next to nothing. At last\nwith a rueful sigh Jimmie reached to his hip and produced the private\nO'Hara flagon. He stooped over the Professor's form once more and by\ndint of much prying at clenched jaws managed to force a sizeable charge\nof fiery liquid down the old man's throat. Jimmie had just begun to\nentertain a strong hope that this latter effort would bring the\nProfessor to life, when his keen ear detected signs of a commotion\nbelow.\n\nHe sprang from his position over the slowly reviving Kell and leaped to\na vantage point beside the door. A blackjack miraculously appeared from\nsome hidden part of his anatomy and the ever-dependable Colt also became\nin evidence. Now came the banging of a door, muffled voices, a crash as\nof a chair overturned in the dark. Up rolled a horrible oath, and the\nsame was rendered in a voice to Jimmie sweetly familiar. Came the sound\nof footsteps on the stairway and several persons coming along the hall.\n\n\"Where in hell is Jimmie?\" roared a wicked voice. \"If he's met with any\nmonkey business in this hell-hole I'll see that the damned place burns\nto the ground before I leave it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDelightedly Jimmie jerked open the door.\n\n\"Still alive, Chief,\" he chirped as the Old Man strode into the\nlaboratory. Bland was followed by Perry, who seemed to be in a sort of\ndaze. Bringing up the rear were a pair of plainclothesmen whom Jimmie\nknew very well--almost too well. One of these gentlemen bore a lantern\nwhich reminded Jimmie strongly of some he had seen that night guarding\nan open ditch in the public highway.\n\nThe Professor had fully regained consciousness and was struggling to his\nfeet. As for Norma Manion, she had suddenly appeared, leaning weakly\nagainst the door casing, and was surveying the group in great alarm.\n\nAfter being assured by O'Hara that they were her friends she smiled\nwanly. To Bland and the others she was, of course, an unexpected factor\nin the weird night's doings, and for several moments they regarded her\ncuriously.\n\nAt length Jimmie, sensing the question in the Old Man's eyes, elected to\noffer a few words of explanation.\n\n\"Miss Manion has just been through a terrible experience,\" he said.\n\"She and her father have been for some time at the mercy of this\nmonster\"--indicating Kell--\"and her nerves are completely shattered.\nWe'd better get her out of this as quickly as we can.\"\n\n\"Mike!\" Hard Boiled Bland glared at one of the officers. \"Don't stand\nthere with your teeth in your gums like that. Take this girl out to my\ncar and let her lie down. She needs a stimulant, too. If you search my\ncar and find any red liquor in the left back door pocket, I don't know a\nthing about it. And stay with her so she won't be afraid to go to\nsleep.\"\n\nShe smiled in silent gratitude and allowed the plainclothesman to lead\nher away from that chamber of horror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reporter lost no time in telling Bland of his failure to find Skip\nHandlon. He went on to acquaint his Chief with the facts of all that had\noccured while he had been at the Professor's house.\n\nThe fiery old fellow listened grimly. When Jimmie came to the story of\nthe corpse and the cask the editor breathed one word, \"Manion!\"\n\nJimmie nodded sadly. All eyes turned to the dejected huddle on the floor\nthat was Professor Kell. Finally Bland could wait no longer, but fixed a\nterrible eye on the murderer and demanded harshly, \"Where's Handlon?\"\n\nNow the Professor burst into a fit of insane laughter, laughter that\ncurdled the blood of the listeners.\n\n\"You ask me that! It's almost too good. Hee-hee! You sent your two\nprecious reporters out to my house to pry into my secrets, and thought\nto display my name all over your yellow sheet; but you forgot that you\nwere dealing with Professor Anton Kell, didn't you?\" The last he fairly\nshrieked. \"A lot of people have tried to intrude upon me before, but\nnone ever escaped me!\"\n\n\"We know that,\" cut in Jimmie, for he was getting impatient and the old\nman's boastings seemed out of place. \"You are slated for the rope\nanyway, after what I discovered down cellar.\" He jerked his eyes in the\ndirection of the door significantly. \"Now we propose to find Handlon,\nand the better it will be for you if you tell us what you have done with\nhim. Otherwise....\"\n\n\"You can go to hell!\" screamed the maniac. \"If you are so clever, find\nout for yourselves. He isn't so far away that you couldn't touch him by\nreaching out your hand. In fact, he's been with you quite a while.\nHee-hee-hee! Well, if you must know--there he is!\" With an insane\nchuckle he pointed at Horace Perry. And Perry did a strange thing.\n\n\"Yes, you fiend, here I am!\" Whose voice was that? Was it Perry\nspeaking, or was it Skip Handlon? Most assuredly Perry stood before\nthem, but the voice, in a subtle manner, reminded the group strongly of\npoor old Skip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he spoke Perry had launched himself at the Professor's throat and had\nto be restrained by the others. Savagely he fought them but slowly and\nsurely they overcame his struggles and placed him, writhing, in a\nchair.\n\nOf a sudden Bland leaned forward and scrutinized Perry's face sharply.\nHad the reporter gone insane too? The pupils of the eyes had taken on a\nsort of queer contraction, a fixed quality that was almost ludicrous. He\nlooked like a man under hypnosis. He had gone limp in their grasp, but\nnow suddenly he stiffened. The eyes underwent another startling change,\nthis time glowing undoubtedly with the look of reason. Bland was\nmystified and waited for Perry to explain his queer conduct. The latter\nseemed finally to come to. Simultaneously he realized that his peculiar\nlapse from consciousness had been observed by the others.\n\n\"Guess I may as well admit it,\" he said with a wry smile. \"Ever since I\ncame back from my assignment with Kell I have had a hell of a time. Half\nthe time I have been in a daze and have not had the least idea what I\nwas doing. Funny part of it is that I have seemed to keep right on doing\nthings even while I was out of my head.\" He told briefly of the visions\nhe had had in which he had seemed to contend with his brother reporter,\nthe horrid sensations as he felt himself overcome, the black oblivion in\nwhich he then found himself, and the mysterious manner in which he had\nleft Keegan on that ill-fated assignment.\n\n\"What have you done to Handlon?\" Jimmie's voice cut in. He was standing\nover the form of the maniac, rigid and menacing. \"You have exactly two\nminutes to go.\"\n\n\"Find out for yourself!\" snarled the bruised and battered fiend.\n\n\"I will,\" was the answer, and on the instant a horrible shriek rent the\nair. Jimmie had quickly grasped both of the Professor's arms at the\nwrists and was slowly twisting them in a grip of iron. Kell's face went\nwhite, the lips writhed back over toothless gums, the eyes closed in the\nsupreme effort to withstand the excruciating pain. Then--\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" he screamed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO'Hara eased the pressure slightly but retained his hold upon the\nclawlike hands. \"Talk fast,\" he ordered.\n\nThe old man struggled futilely in the grasp of the powerful reporter,\nfinally glancing in the direction of the others. Would they show signs\nof pity? Surely not Hard Boiled Bland. The Chief was watching the\nstruggles of the victim through a cloud of tobacco smoke which he was\nslowly exhaling through his nose. The plainclothesman displayed no sign\nof interest at all. The game was up!\n\n\"Very well,\" he said sullenly. \"Handlon and Perry are both occupying the\nsame body.\"\n\n\"Wh-a-a-t?\" roared Bland. \"Jimmie, I guess you'll have to put the screws\nto him some more. He's trying to make fools of us at the last minute!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" screamed the Professor. \"What I say is true. I have been\nworking for years on my system of de-astralization. This last year I at\nlength perfected my electric de-astralizer, which amplifies and exerts\nthe fifth influence of de-cohesion.\"\n\nThe whole party began to look uneasy and gazed apprehensively at the\nhuge Crookes tube which still stood in its supporting frame on the\ntable.\n\n\"I have been forced to experiment on animals for the most part,\" the\nProfessor continued. \"I succeeded in de-astralizing a dog and a bull and\ncaused them to exchange bodies. The bodies continued to function. I was\nenthusiastic. Other experiments took place of which I will not tell you.\nFinally I began to long for a human subject on which to try my fifth\ninfluence.\"\n\n\"Just get down to cases, if you don't mind, Kell.\" The Chief wanted\naction. \"Suppose you tell us just what you did to Handlon and where we\ncan find him. I may as well mention that your life depends upon it. If\nwe find that you have done for him, something worse than death may\nhappen to you.\" The tone was menacing. Although Handlon was a\ncomparatively late acquisition to the old Chief's staff, still he had\nbeen loyal to the paper.\n\n\"When your two damned reporters entered my driveway,\" Kell resumed. \"I\nsaw them coming through a powerful glass which I always have on hand. I\nhad no desire to see them, but they forced themselves upon me. At last I\ndetermined that they should furnish material for my experiments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If your men had looked into the grove behind the barn they would have\nfound the automobile which furnished two more subjects I was keeping on\nhand in a room upstairs. Old Manion and his daughter gave me quite a bit\nof trouble, but I kept them drugged most of the time. He broke out of\nthe room to-night though, and I had to kill him. It was self defense,\"\nhe added slyly.\n\n\"Anyway, I found it was possible to make two astrals exchange bodies.\nBut I also wanted to see if it were possible to cause two astrals to\noccupy the same body at the same time, and if so what the result would\nbe. I found out. It was rare sport to watch your star reporter leave my\nhouse. He was damned glad to leave, I believe....\" Again came the insane\ncackle.\n\n\"Guess we have to believe him whether we want to or not.\" The detective\ncame to life. \"How about making him release Handlon's--what d'ye call\nit?--astral--from Perry's body?\"\n\n\"Just a moment.\" The voice now was unmistakably Handlon's, though it was\nissuing from the throat of Perry. \"In the minute I have in consciousness\nlet me suggest that before you do any more de-astralizing you _locate my\nbody_. Until then, if I am released from this one I am a dead man.\"\n\nThe words struck the group dumb. Where _was_ Handlon's body? Could the\nProfessor produce it?\n\nThat worthy looked rather haunted at that moment, and they began to see\nthe fear of death coming upon him.\n\n\"Mercy, mercy!\" he begged as the four men started to advance upon him.\n\"As soon as I had de-astralized Handlon I destroyed his body in my\npickling barrel down cellar. But there is another way....\" He paused,\nuncertain as to how his next words would be received. \"Go out and get\nthe Manion girl. She can be de-astralized and friend Handlon can have\nher body.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this suggestion, advanced so na\u00efvely, the four men recoiled in\nhorror. It was entirely too much even for Hard Boiled Bland, and he\ncould hardly restrain himself from applying the editorial fist to the\nleering face before him. Undoubtedly Professor Kell was hopelessly\ninsane, and for that reason he held himself in leash.\n\n\"Kell, you are slated to pull off one more stunt,\" Jimmie addressed the\ncringing heap. \"You know what it is. Get busy. And just remember that I\nam standing over here\"--he indicated a corner well separated from the\nrest--\"with this cannon aimed in your direction. If things aren't just\naccording to Hoyle, you get plugged. Get me?\"\n\n\"What about it, men?\" Bland spoke up. \"Is it going to be treating\nHandlon right to de-astralize him now? It will be his last chance to\nhave a body on this earth.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately that body never belonged to Handlon,\" said O'Hara. \"Hence\nI fail to see why Perry should be discommoded for the balance of his\nlife with a companion astral. Perry is clearly entitled to his own body,\nfree and unhampered. Friend Skip is out of luck, unless--Well, I don't\nmind telling you, Kell, that you just gave me an idea. Snap into it\nnow!\"\n\nThe Professor dragged himself to his feet and under the menace of the\nautomatic fumbled under the table until he had located the intricate\napparatus before mentioned.\n\n\"Now if Mr. Perry--or Handlon--will kindly recline at full length on\nthis table,\" he said with an obscene leer, \"the experiment will begin.\"\n\n\"Just remember, Kell, this is no experiment,\" advised Bland, fixing the\nProfessor with an ugly eye. \"You do as you're told.\"\n\nThe other made no reply, but threw a hidden switch. Perry, lying flat on\nhis back on the ancient table, suddenly found himself being bathed by\nwhat seemed to be a ray of light, and yet was not a ray of light. What\nwas it? It was surely not visible, yet it was tangible. A terrific force\nwas emanating from that devilish globe above him, drawing him out of\nhimself--or--no--was he expanding? Again his ears became filled with\nconfused, horrible sounds, the outlines of the room faded from sight,\nhe felt a strange sense of inflation ... of lightness.... Oblivion!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom where the others sat a gasp of wonder went up. At the first contact\nof the switch there had been a momentary flash of greenish light within\nthe bulb, and then a swift transition to a beautiful orange. It had then\nfaded altogether, leaving the glass apparently inert and inactive.\n\nBut it was not so! The form lying beneath the bulb was evidently being\nracked with untold tortures. The face became a thing of horror. Now it\nhad twisted into a grotesque semblance of Handlon's--now it again\nresembled Perry's. The Professor quietly increased the pressure of the\ncurrent. From the bulb emanated a steel gray exhalation of what must be\ntermed light, and yet so real it was seemingly material. Assuredly it\nwas not a ray of light as we understand light. It came in great beating\nthrobs, in which the actual vibrations were entirely visible. Under each\nimpact the body of Perry seemed to change, slowly at first, then with\nincreasing speed. The body was now swelled to enormous size. Bland\nreached forward to touch it.\n\n\"This de-cohering influence,\" the Professor was murmuring, almost\nraptly, \"causes the atoms that go to make a living body repel one\nanother. When the body is sufficiently nebulized, the soul--Back! Back,\nyou fool!\" he suddenly shrieked, grasping Bland by the arm. \"Do you want\nto kill him?\"\n\nBland hurriedly retreated, convinced perforce that Kell's alarm was\ngenuine. The editorial fingers had penetrated the subject's garments\nwithout resistance and sank into the body as easily as if it were so\nmuch soft soap!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe body continued to expand until at length even the hard-headed\nplainclothesman realized that it had been reduced to a mere vapor.\nWithin this horrid vaporized body, which nearly filled the room and\nwhich had now lost all semblance to a man, could be discerned two faint\nshapes. Swiftly the Professor extinguished the lantern. The shapes,\nvague though they were, could be recognized as those of Horace Perry and\nSkip Handlon. And they were at strife!\n\nAll eyes were now focused on Professor Kell, who was evidently waiting\nfor something to happen. The two apparitions within the body-cloud were\nat death grips. One had been overcome and was temporarily helpless. It\nwas that of Handlon. And then again the astral of Perry forcibly ousted\nthat of Handlon from the cloud-cyst. And at that instant Professor Kell\nshut off the influence-tube.\n\nAt once a terrific metamorphosis took place. There came a sharp sound\nalmost like a clap of thunder, with the slight exception that this was\noccasioned by exactly the reverse effect. Instead of being an\n_ex_plosion it might more properly be termed an _in_plosion, for the\nmist-cloud suddenly vanished. The de-cohering influence having been\nremoved, the cloud had condensed into the form of Perry. Apparently none\nthe worse, he was even now beginning to recover consciousness. The\nastral of Handlon was no longer visible, though hovering in the\nvicinity.\n\nPerry's body was again his own.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this time Jimmie O'Hara elected to start something new by hitting the\nProfessor a workmanlike blow on the back of the head with the butt of\nhis automatic. The next thing Bland or anyone else present knew the\nunconscious body of the Professor was on the table and Jimmie was\ngroping for the concealed switch. At length he found it, and the green\nflash of light appeared in the bulb, followed by the brilliant orange\nmanifestation.\n\n\"What in hell are you doing?\" gasped Bland.\n\n\"De-astralizing the Professor,\" replied O'Hara cheerfully. \"Don't you\nget the idea yet? Watch!\"\n\nFascinated, the four men saw the terrific emanation take its baleful\neffect. As before, the body commenced to expand and gradually took on a\nmisty outline. Larger and larger it grew, until finally it had become a\nvast cloud of intangible nothingness which filled the room like some\nevil nebula.\n\nA cry of consternation from the detective aroused Jimmie. Skip Handlon's\nastral had appeared within the field of the nebula to fight for\npossession. There ensued what was perhaps the weirdest encounter ever\nwitnessed. Though he was in poor physical shape, the Professor seemed to\nhave an extremely powerful astral; and for some time the spectators\ndespaired of Handlon's victory. Once the latter, evidently realizing\nthat the powerful influence tube had rendered him visible, glanced\nsharply in Jimmie's direction. O'Hara was considerably puzzled at this,\nbut watched the progress of the struggle tensely. At length the moment\nseemed to arrive which the reporter's astral had been awaiting. It\nturned tail and fled away from the astral of the Professor, disappearing\nbeyond the outer confines of the nebula.\n\nJimmie suddenly divined the other's purpose and dived for the hidden\nswitch. As he had anticipated, Handlon had finally given up the attempt\nto overcome the astral of Kell by force and had made up his mind to\naccomplish his end by strategy. Almost on the instant that Jimmie's hand\nclosed on the switch the reporter's astral again leaped into the field\nof the nebula. Fiercely it signalled to the former second story man to\nshut off the current, but the admonition was unnecessary, for Jimmie had\nalready done so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwiftly the cloud-cyst faded. Even as the group caught a fleeting sight\nof Skip Handlon, the last that mortal eyes would ever see of him as he\nactually was, there came a violent disturbance at the edge of the\nshrinking nebula. Would the speed of condensation of the atoms which\ncomprised the body of Professor Kell serve to shut out the pursuing\nastral of Kell?\n\nEven Bland held his breath!\n\nThe cloud lost its luminous quality, the action of condensation\nincreasing in speed. It was barely visible in the enshrouding gloom. An\nastral had long since been enveloped within the rapidly accumulating\nsubstance. Came a sudden clap of sound as before, and the final act of\nresolution had been accomplished. Whether the Professor had succeeded in\nregaining a position within the cloud-cyst before the crucial second\nnone could say.\n\nJimmie relighted the lantern. Apparently the effect of the love tap\nadministered by his automatic was more or less of a lasting character,\nand the men were put to some ado to restore the body of Kell to\nconsciousness. At length their efforts began to bear fruit, however, and\nit became expedient to remove the patient to the softer couch in the\nsitting room below. As they moved forward to lay hold of the limp body a\nfigure appeared in the doorway to the hall. It was the plainclothesman,\nRiley.\n\n\"How about getting under way for town,\" he wanted to know. \"Is the old\nparty croaked yet? Miss Manion has had a fierce time and says she won't\nstay near this house another minute. I don't like this place myself\neither. Do you know I just got kicked by a poll parrot? Let's get away\nfrom here.\"\n\n\"Hold on, Riley, what are you talking about?\" growled Bland. \"Kicked by\na poll parrot! You're--\"\n\n\"That's all right, Chief,\" broke in the now thoroughly cheerful Perry.\n\"That jackass I shot could probably have told us all about it. I\npositively know the beast could talk.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" snorted Bland, \"Well, if a donkey can talk, and a bull can\nbite, and a hound can hook, why shouldn't a parrot--Judas Priest, I'm\ngetting as crazy as the rest of you! Hurry up and get Kell downstairs so\nwe can see who he is. There I go again! Oh, go lie down, Riley.\"\n\n\"But look, Bland, look!\" Riley was pointing a demoralized finger at a\ncage in the corner. He tugged frantically at Bland's coat sleeve. \"See\nwhat's in there, won't you? I--well, I did find some liquor in your car,\nand Miss Manion made me take some. I--I didn't know it would do this to\nme. Look in there; please, Mr. Bland!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBland gave Riley a dark look, but nevertheless he reached for O'Hara's\nflashlight. In the cage two yellow eyes blinked sleepily out at him.\nPerry began to laugh.\n\n\"Why, there's nothing in there but a cat. Skip and I heard it purring\nwhen we first came in here this afternoon. Guess Riley--\"\n\n\"Great God, Jimmie, give me your gun!\" Hard Boiled Bland for the moment\nfailed to merit his sobriquet. The torch in his hand threw a trembling\nbeam full into the cage. \"It's a snake! And--there! It's doing it\nagain!\"\n\nA snake it was, indubitably, a huge black specimen with bright yellow\nstripes. Bland's frenzied yell seemed not to have excited it at all, for\nnow the sleek fellow had arched its body neatly and was calmly licking\nits sides with a long forked tongue. After a moment it halted the\noperation long enough to rub its jaw against a bar of its cage, and gave\nvent to a sociable mew!\n\nEven this could not dash the spirits of Horace Perry. He laughed\ndelightedly again as he laid Bland by the arm.\n\n\"That creature is perfectly harmless, Chief,\" he told the editor.\n\"Somewhere I suppose there's a mighty dangerous kitty cat at large, but\nthere's no sense in taking it out on this poor reptile. Let's live and\nlet live.\"\n\nWith a show of reluctance Bland returned Jimmie's automatic, then strode\nover to where lay the form of Kell. Perry and O'Hara lingered by the\ncage long enough to arrange a plan to let the snake out doors as soon as\nopportunity offered, after which they joined their Chief. Riley went\nout to resume his vigil in Bland's car, while his fellow sleuth prepared\nto light the way downstairs. Under his guidance the sick man was carried\nbelow without mishap.\n\nDownstairs the now conscious form of the venerable Professor was laid\nout on the ancient sofa until his senses could clear a bit. Presently\nthe eyelids fluttered open and a feeble voice asked, \"Where the deuce am\nI, and how did all you guys get here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA joyous gasp went up. That voice! Although uttered in somewhat the same\nvocal quality as Kell's the intonation and accents had strangely\naltered. O'Hara leaned eagerly over the figure on the couch. The\nquestion he asked was startling in its incongruity:\n\n\"How are you feeling, _Skip_!\"\n\n\"Rotten,\" was the reply from the lips of Kell. \"What hit me such a crack\non the dome? I feel as if I had been dragged through a knot-hole. Lemme\nup.\"\n\n\"Stay still,\" commanded O'Hara, kindly but firmly. \"You aren't fit to\nmove yet. You are going on a long ride and will need your strength.\nDon't talk, either.\"\n\nA half-hour later they left the house. In the front yard the editor\ncalled a hasty conclave which included the entire party. Hard Boiled\nBland has never been known to talk so much at a stretch, before or\nsince.\n\n\"Before we start back,\" he began, \"we had better come to an understanding.\nIn the first place--Skip, come over here a minute.\"\n\nNorma Manion uttered an involuntary cry of fear as the aged form of Kell\npassed by her. Skip's instant response to his name had, of course, been\nperfectly natural to him. But it had an odd effect on the others.\n\n\"Miss Manion, and gentlemen,\" Bland went on, with a bow of mock\nceremony, \"I want you to meet Mister--er, Mister--oh hell, call him\nSaunders. This is Mr. Kenneth Saunders, ladies and gentlemen. When he\ngets a shave and has his new face patched up I believe you will like his\nappearance much more than you do now.\n\n\"Seriously though, folks, I hope that with a little fixing up the\ngentleman will hardly resemble Professor Anton Kell. Kell is dead.\nObviously, however, this gentleman can hardly continue his existence as\nSkip Handlon. Hence--well, hence Mr. Saunders. And don't forget the\nname.\n\n\"Now another little matter. This house has proven a curse to humanity.\nWhat has transpired here need never be known. Would it not be the wiser\nto eliminate all traces of to-night's happenings? There is a way.\" He\nlooked significantly at the others.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You mean--\" began Perry.\n\n\"That we destroy all traces of Professor Kell's villainy. Although he is\nno more, still someone might notice that _his body actively remains_.\nAnd no one wants to do any explaining.\"\n\n\"It's the only way we can protect Handlon,\" one of the sleuths\nruminated, half to himself. \"No judge would ever believe a word about\nthis de-astralization business. The chances are we would all go to the\nbooby hatch and Handlon would go to prison for Kell's crimes.\"\n\n\"There were four of us that witnessed the fact of the--the soul\ntransfusion, though,\" Perry objected. \"Wouldn't that be enough to clear\nSkip? Besides, wouldn't it be possible for us to lead a jury out here\nand duplicate the experiment?\"\n\n\"Too much undesirable publicity,\" growled Bland, who for once in his\nlife had found reason to keep something good out of the headlines. \"What\ndo you say, people?\"\n\n\"I move we move,\" from the detective who had had the uncomfortable job\nof attending to Norma Manion.\n\n\"Gentleman, I believe we understand each other,\" said Jimmie quietly.\n\"Now I am going into the barn\"--significantly--\"to see if everything's\nall right. While I am there something _might_ happen. You understand?\"\n\nThe others nodded silent assent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the snug seat of Jimmie's speedster Norma Manion shivered as she\nfollowed the direction indicated by her companion's finger. It was that\ndarkest hour which comes just before the dawn.\n\nTo the westward could be perceived a dull, red glow, which, even as they\nwatched with fascinated eyes, developed into an intense glare. Gradually\nthe fading stars became eclipsed in the greater glory.\n\nThree cars, motors throbbing as if eager to be gone, stood a space apart\non the main road. The car behind O'Hara's was the Manion machine, now\noccupied by Bland and Riley. The remaining one was a touring car and\ncontained the balance of the party. Perry was at the wheel, and beside\nhim sat the Handlon-Kell-Saunders combination.\n\n\"Thus passes a den of horror,\" whispered Jimmie to his companion.\n\n\"It is the funeral pyre of my father,\" the girl answered simply. She had\nlong since recovered from her initial outburst of grief at her loss, and\nnow watched the progress of the conflagration dry-eyed. At length Jimmie\nslipped an arm protectingly about the trembling shoulders.\n\n\"You have seen enough,\" he said. As the three cars raced from the scene\nof the holocaust, faint streamers in the east told of the rising orb of\nday.\n\n\"Good-by, Keegan, forever,\" murmured Norma.\n\n\"Amen,\" O'Hara devoutedly agreed.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Ocean's Depths\n\n_By Sewell Peaslee Wright_\n\n    Man came from the sea. Mercer, by his thought-telegraph, learns\n    from the weirdly beautiful ocean-maiden of a branch that\n    returned there.\n\n[Illustration: _Her head was a little to one side, in the attitude of one\nwho listens intently._]\n\n\nFrom somewhere out on the black, heaving Atlantic, the rapid, muffled\npopping of a speed-boat's exhaust drifted clearly through the night.\n\nI dropped my book and stretched, leaning back more comfortably in my\nchair. There was real romance and adventure! Rum-runners, seeking out\ntheir hidden port with their cargo of contraband from Cuba. Heading\nfearlessly through the darkness, fighting the high seas, still running\nafter the storm of a day or so before, daring a thousand dangers for the\nsake of the straw-packed bottles they carried. Sea-bronzed men, with\nhard, flat muscles and fearless eyes; ready guns slapping their thighs\nas they--\n\nAbsorbed in my mental picture of these modern free-booters, the sudden\nalarm of the telephone startled me like an unexpected shot fired beside\nmy ear. Brushing the cigarette ashes from my smoking-jacket, I crossed\nthe room and snatched up the receiver.\n\n\"Hello!\" I snapped ungraciously into the mouthpiece. It was after eleven\nby the ship's clock on the mantel, and if--\n\n\"Taylor?\" The voice--Warren Mercer's familiar voice--rattled on without\nwaiting for a reply. \"Get in your car and come down here as fast as\npossible. Come just as you are, and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I managed to interrupt him. \"Burglars?\" I had never\nheard Mercer speak in that high-pitched, excited voice before; his usual\nspeech was slow and thoughtful, almost didactic.\n\n\"Please, Taylor, don't waste time questioning me. If it weren't urgent,\nI wouldn't be calling you, you know. Will you come?\"\n\n\"You bet!\" I said quickly, feeling rather a fool for ragging him when he\nwas in such deadly earnest. \"Have--\"\n\nThe receiver snapped and crackled; Mercer had hung up the instant he had\nmy assurance that I would come. Usually the very soul of courtesy and\nconsideration, that act alone would have convinced me that there was an\nurgent need for my presence at The Monstrosity. That was Mercer's own\nname for the impressive pile that was at once his residence and his\nlaboratory.\n\nI threw off the smoking-jacket and pulled on a woolen golfing sweater,\nfor the wind was brisk and sharpish. In two minutes I was backing the\ncar out of the garage; a moment later I was off the gravelled drive and\ntearing down the concrete with the accelerator all the way down, and the\nblack wind shrieking around the windshield of my little roadster.\n\nMy own shack was out of the city limits--a little place I keep to live\nin when the urge to go fishing seizes me, which is generally about twice\na year. Mercer picked the place up for me at a song.\n\nThe Monstrosity was some four miles further out from town, and off the\nhighway perhaps a half-mile more.\n\nI made the four miles in just a shade over that many minutes, and\nclamped on the brakes as I saw the entrance to the little drive that led\ntoward the sea, and Mercer's estate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith gravel rattling on my fenders, I turned off the concrete and swept\nbetween the two massive, stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive. Both\nof them bore corroded bronze plates, \"The Billows,\" the name given The\nMonstrosity by the original owner, a newly-rich munitions manufacturer.\n\nThe structure itself loomed up before me in a few seconds, a rambling\naffair with square-shouldered balconies and a great deal of wrought-iron\nwork, after the most flamboyant Spanish pattern. It was ablaze with\nlight. Apparently every bulb in the place was burning.\n\nJust a few yards beyond the surf boomed hollowly on the smooth, shady\nshore, littered now, I knew, by the pitiful spoils of the storm.\n\nAs I clamped on my brakes, a swift shadow passed two of the lower\nwindows. Before I could leap from the car, the broad front door, with\nits rounded top and circular, grilled window, was flung wide, and Mercer\ncame running to meet me.\n\nHe was wearing a bathrobe, hastily flung on over a damp bathing suit,\nhis bare legs terminating in a pair of disreputable slippers.\n\n\"Fine, Taylor!\" he greeted me. \"I suppose you're wondering what it's all\nabout. I don't blame you. But come in, come in! Just wait till you see\nher!\"\n\n\"Her?\" I asked, startled. \"You're not in love, by any chance, and\nbringing me down here like this merely to back up your own opinion of\nthem eyes and them lips, Mercer?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe laughed excitedly.\n\n\"You'll see, you'll see! No, I'm not in love. And I want you to help,\nand not admire. There are only Carson and myself here, you know, and the\njob's too big for the two of us.\" He hurried me across the broad\nconcrete porch and into the house. \"Throw the cap anywhere and come\non!\"\n\nToo much amazed to comment further, I followed my friend. This was a\nWarren Mercer I did not know. Usually his clean-cut, olive-tinted face\nwas a polite mask that seldom showed even the slightest trace of\nemotion. His eyes, dark and large, smiled easily, and shone with\ninterest, but his almost beautiful mouth, beneath the long slim\nmustache, always closely cropped, seldom smiled with his eyes.\n\nBut it was his present excited speech that amazed me most. Mercer,\nduring all the years I had known him, had never been moved before to\nsuch tempestuous outbursts of enthusiasm. It was his habit to speak\nslowly and thoughtfully, in his low, musical voice; even in the midst of\nour hottest arguments, and we had had many of them, his voice had never\nlost its calm, unhurried gentleness.\n\nTo my surprise, instead of leading the way to the really comfortable,\nalthough rather gaudy living room, Mercer turned to the left, towards\nwhat had been the billiard room, and was now his laboratory.\n\nThe laboratory, brilliantly illuminated, was littered, as usual, with\napparatus of every description. Along one wall were the retorts, scales,\nracks, hoods and elaborate set-ups, like the articulated glass and\nrubber bones of some weird prehistoric monster, that demonstrated\nMercer's taste for this branch of science. On the other side of the room\na corresponding workbench was littered with a tangle of coils,\ntransformers, meters, tools and instruments, and at the end of the\nroom, behind high black control panels, with gleaming bus-bars and\nstaring, gaping meters, a pair of generators hummed softly. The other\nend of the room was nearly all glass, and opened onto the patio and the\nswimming pool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer paused a moment, with his hand on the knob of the door, a strange\nlight in his dark eyes.\n\n\"Now you'll see why I called you here,\" he said tensely. \"You can judge\nfor yourself whether the trip was worth while. Here she is!\"\n\nWith a gesture he flung open the door, and I stared, following his\nglance, down at the great tiled swimming pool.\n\nIt is difficult for me to describe the scene. The patio was not large,\nbut it was beautifully done. Flowers and shrubs, even a few small palms,\ngrew in profusion in the enclosure, while above, through the movable\nglass roof--made in sections to disappear in fine weather--was the empty\nblackness of the sky.\n\nNone of the lights provided for the illumination of the covered patio\nwas turned on, but all the windows surrounding the patio were aglow, and\nI could see the pool quite clearly.\n\nThe pool--and its occupant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were standing at one side of the pool, near the center. Directly\nopposite us, seated on the bottom of the pool, was a human figure, nude\nsave for a great mass of tawny hair that fell about her like a silken\nmantle. The strangely graceful figure of a girl, one leg stretched out\nstraight before her, the other drawn up and clasped by the interlocked\nfingers of her hands. Even in the soft light I could see her perfectly,\nthrough the clear water, her pale body outlined sharply against the jade\ngreen tiles.\n\nI tore myself away from the staring, curious eyes of the figure.\n\n\"In God's name, Mercer, what is it? Porcelain?\" I asked hoarsely. The\nthing had an indescribably eery effect.\n\nHe laughed wildly.\n\n\"Porcelain? Watch ... _look_!\"\n\nMy eyes followed his pointing finger. The figure was moving. Gracefully\nit arose to its full height. The great cloud of corn-colored hair\nfloated down about it, falling below the knees. Slowly, with a grace of\nmovement comparable only with the slow soaring of a gull, she came\ntoward me, walking on the bottom of the pool through the clear water as\nthough she floated in air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFascinated, I watched her. Her eyes, startlingly large and dark in the\nstrangely white face, were fixed on mine. There was nothing sinister in\nthe gaze, yet I felt my body shaking as though in the grip of a terrible\nfear. I tried to look away, and found myself unable to move. I felt\nMercer's tense, sudden grip upon my arm, but I did not, could not, look\nat him.\n\n\"She--she's smiling!\" I heard him exclaim. He laughed, an excited,\nhigh-pitched laugh that irritated me in some subtle way.\n\nShe was smiling, and looking up into my eyes. She was very close now,\nwithin a few feet of us. She came still closer, until she was at my very\nfeet as I stood on the raised ledge that ran around the edge of the\npool, her head thrown back, staring straight up at me through the\nwater.\n\nI could see her teeth, very white between her coral-pink lips, and her\nbosom rising and falling beneath the veil of pale gold hair. She was\nbreathing _water_!\n\nMercer literally jerked me away from the edge of the pool.\n\n\"What do you think of her, Taylor?\" he asked, his dark eyes dancing with\nexcitement.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" I said, shaking my head dazedly. \"She is not\nhuman?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think so. As human as you or I. I'll tell you all I\nknow, and then you can judge for yourself. I think we'll know in a few\nminutes, if my plans work out. But first slip on a bathing suit.\"\n\nI didn't argue the matter. I let Mercer lead me away without a word. And\nwhile I was changing, he told me all he knew of the strange creature in\nthe pool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Late this afternoon I decided to go for a little walk along the beach,\"\nMercer began. \"I had been working like the devil since early in the\nmorning, running some tests on what you call my thought-telegraph. I\nfelt the need of some fresh sea air.\n\n\"I walked along briskly for perhaps five minutes, keeping just out of\nreach of the rollers and the spray. The shore was littered with all\nsorts of flotsam and jetsam washed up by the big storm, and I was just\nthinking that I would have to have a man with a truck come and clean up\nthe shore in front of the place, when, in a little sandy pool, I\nsaw--_her_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"She was laying face down in the water, motionless, her head towards the\nsea, one arm stretched out before her, and her long hair wrapped around\nher like a half-transparent cloak.\n\n\"I ran up and lifted her from the water. Her body was cold, and deathly\nwhite, although her lips were faintly pink, and her heart was beating,\nfaintly but steadily.\n\n\"Like most people in an emergency. I forgot all I ever knew about first\naid. All I could think of was to give her a drink, and of course I\ndidn't have a flask on my person. So I picked her up in my arms and\nbrought her to the house as quickly as I could. She seemed to be\nreviving, for she was struggling and gasping when I got here with her.\n\n\"I placed her on the bed in the guest room and poured her a stiff drink\nof Scotch--half a tumblerful, I believe. Lifting up her head, I placed\nthe glass to her lips. She looked up me, blinking, and took the liquor\nin a single draught. She did not seem to drink it, but sucked it out of\nthe glass in a single amazing gulp--that's the only word for it. The\nnext instant she was off the bed, her face a perfect mask of hate and\nagony.\n\n\"She came at me, hands clutching and clawing, making odd murmuring or\nmewing sounds in her throat. It was then that I noticed for the first\ntime that her hands were webbed!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Webbed?\" I asked, startled.\n\n\"Webbed,\" nodded Mercer solemnly. \"As are her feet. But listen, Taylor.\nI was amazed, and not a little rattled when she came for me. I ran\nthrough the French windows out into the patio. For a moment she ran\nafter me, rather awkwardly and heavily, but swiftly, nevertheless. Then\nshe saw the pool.\n\n\"Apparently forgetting that I existed, she leaped into the water, and as\nI approached a moment later I could see her breathing deeply and\ngratefully, a smile of relief upon her features, as she lay upon the\nbottom of the pool. Breathing, Taylor, on the bottom of the pool! Under\neight feet of water!\"\n\n\"And then what, Mercer?\" I reminded him, as he paused, apparently lost\nin thought.\n\n\"I tried to find out more about her. I put on my bathing suit and dived\ninto the pool. Well, she came at me like a shark, quick as a flash, her\nteeth showing, her hands tearing like claws through the water. I turned,\nbut not quickly enough to entirely escape. See?\" Mercer threw back the\ndressing robe, and I saw a ragged tear in his bathing suit on his left\nside, near the waist. Through the rent three deep, jagged scratches were\nclearly visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"She managed to claw me, just once,\" Mercer resumed, wrapping the robe\nabout him again. \"Then I got out and called on Carson for help. I put\nhim into a bathing suit, and we both endeavored to corner her. Carson\ngot two bad scratches, and one rather serious bite that I have bandaged.\nI have a number of lacerations, but I didn't fare so badly as Carson\nbecause I am faster in the water than he is.\n\n\"The harder we tried, the more determined I became. She would sit there,\ncalm and placid, until one of us entered the water. Then she became a\nveritable fury. It was maddening.\n\n\"At last I thought of you. I phoned, and here we are!\"\n\n\"But, Mercer, it's a nightmare!\" I protested. We moved out of the room.\n\"Nothing human can live under water and breathe water, as she does!\"\n\nMercer paused a moment, staring at me oddly.\n\n\"The human race,\" he said gravely, \"came up out of sea. The human race\nas we know it. Some may have gone back.\" He turned and walked away\nagain, and I hurried after him.\n\n\"What do you mean. Mercer? 'Some may have gone back?' I don't get it.\"\n\nMercer shook his head, but made no other reply until we stood again on\nthe edge of the pool.\n\nThe girl was standing where we had left her, and as she looked up into\nmy face, she smiled again, and made a quick gesture with one hand. It\nseemed to me that she invited me to join her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I believe she likes you, Taylor,\" said Mercer thoughtfully. \"You're\nlight, light skin, light hair. Carson and I are both very dark, almost\nswarthy. And in that white bathing suit--yes, I believe she's taken a\nfancy to you!\"\n\nMercer's eyes were dancing.\n\n\"If she has,\" he went on, \"it'll make our work very easy.\"\n\n\"What work?\" I asked suspiciously. Mercer, always an indefatigable\nexperimenter, was never above using his friends in the benefit of\nscience. And some of his experiments in the past had been rather trying,\nnot to say exciting.\n\n\"I think I have what you call my thought-telegraph perfected,\nexperimentally,\" he explained rapidly. \"I fell asleep working on it at\nthree o'clock, or thereabouts, this morning, and some tests with Carson\nseem to indicate that it is a success. I should have called you\nto-morrow, for further test. Nearly five years of damned hard work to a\nsuccessful conclusion, Taylor, and then this mermaid comes along and\nmakes my experiment appear about as important as one of those breakers\nrolling in out there!\"\n\n\"And what do you plan to do now?\" I asked eagerly, glancing down at the\nbeautiful pale face that glimmered up at me through the clear water of\nthe pool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why, try it on her!\" exclaimed Mercer with mounting enthusiasm. \"Don't\nyou see, Taylor? If it will work on her, and we can direct her thoughts,\nwe can find out her history, the history of her people! We'll add a page\nto scientific history--a whole big chapter!--that will make us famous.\nMan this is so big it's swept me off my feet! Look!\" And he held out a\nthin, aristocratic brown hand before my eyes, a hand that shook with\nnervous excitement.\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" I said quickly. \"I'm no savant, and still I see\nwhat an amazing thing this is. Let's get busy. What can I do?\"\n\nMercer reached around the door into the laboratory and pressed a\nbutton.\n\n\"For Carson,\" he explained. \"We'll need his help. In the meantime, we'll\nlook over the set-up. The apparatus is strewn all over the place.\"\n\nHe had not exaggerated. The set-up consisted of a whole bank of tubes,\neach one in its own shielding copper box. On a much-drilled horizontal\npanel, propped up on insulators, were half a score of delicate meters of\none kind and another, with thin black fingers that pulsed and trembled.\nBehind the panel was a tall cylinder wound with shining copper wire, and\nbeside it another panel, upright, fairly bristling with knobs, contact\npoints, potentiometers, rheostats and switches. On the end of the table\nnearest the door was still another panel, the smallest of the lot,\nbearing only a series of jacks along one side, and in the center a\nswitch with four contact points. A heavy, snaky cable led from this\npanel to the maze of apparatus further on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"This is the control panel,\" explained Mercer. \"The whole affair, you\nunderstand, is in laboratory form. Nothing assembled. Put the different\nantennae plug into these jacks. Like this.\"\n\nHe picked up a weird, hastily built contrivance composed of two\nsemi-circular pieces of spring brass, crossed at right angles. On all\nfour ends were bright silvery electrodes, three of them circular in\nshape, one of them elongated and slightly curved. With a quick, nervous\ngesture, Mercer fitted the thing to his head, so that the elongated\nelectrode pressed against the back of his neck, extending a few inches\ndown his spine. The other three circular electrodes rested on his\nforehead and either side of his head. From the center of the contrivance\nran a heavy insulated cord, some ten feet in length, ending in a simple\nswitchboard plug, which Mercer fitted into the uppermost of the three\njacks.\n\n\"Now,\" he directed, \"you put on this one\"--he adjusted a second\ncontrivance upon my head, smiling as I shrank from the contact of the\ncold metal on my skin--\"and think!\"\n\nHe moved the switch from the position marked \"Off\" to the second contact\npoint, watching me intently, his dark eyes gleaming.\n\nCarson entered, and Mercer gestured to him to wait. Very nice old chap,\nCarson, impressive even in his bathing suit. Mercer was mighty lucky to\nhave a man like Carson....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething seemed to tick suddenly, somewhere deep in my consciousness.\n\n\"Yes, that's very true: Carson is a most decent sort of chap.\" The words\nwere not spoken. I did not _hear_ them, I _knew_ them. What--I glanced\nat Mercer, and he laughed aloud with pleasure and excitement.\n\n\"It worked!\" he cried. \"I received your thought regarding Carson, and\nthen turned the switch so that you received my thought. And you did!\"\n\nRather gingerly I removed the thing from my head and laid it on the\ntable.\n\n\"It's wizardry, Mercer! If it will work as well on _her_....\"\n\n\"It will, I know it will!--if we can get her to wear one of these,\"\nreplied Mercer confidently. \"I have only three of them; I had planned\nsome three-cornered experiments with you, Carson, and myself. We'll\nleave Carson out of to-night's experiment, however, for we'll need him\nto operate this switch. You see, as it is now wired only one person\ntransmits thoughts at a time. The other two receive. When the switch is\non the first contact, Number One sends, and Numbers Two and Three\nreceive. When the switch is on Number Two, then he sends thoughts, and\nNumbers One and Three receive them. And so on. I'll lengthen these leads\nso that we can run them out into the pool, and then we'll be ready.\nSomehow we must induce her to wear one of these things, even if we have\nto use force. I'm sure the three of us can handle her.\"\n\n\"We should be able to,\" I smiled. She was such a slim, graceful, almost\ndelicate little thing; the thought that three strong men might not be\nable to control her seemed almost amusing.\n\n\"You haven't seen her in action yet,\" said Mercer grimly, glancing up\nfrom his work of lengthening the cords that led from the antennae to the\ncontrol panel. \"And what's more, I hope you don't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI watched him in silence as he spliced and securely taped the last\nconnection.\n\n\"All set,\" he nodded. \"Carson, will you operate the switch for us? I\nbelieve everything is functioning properly.\" He surveyed the panel of\ninstruments hastily, assuring himself that every reading was correct.\nThen, with all three of the devices he called antennae in his hand,\ntheir leads plugged into the control panel, he led the way to the side\nof the pool.\n\nThe girl was strolling around the edge of the pool, feeling the smooth\ntile sides with her hands as we came into view, but as soon as she saw\nus she shot through the water to where we were standing.\n\nIt was the first time I had seen her move in this fashion. She seemed to\npropel herself with a sudden mighty thrust of her feet against the\nbottom; she darted through the water with the speed of an arrow, yet\nstopped as gently as though she had merely floated there.\n\nAs she looked up, her eyes unmistakably sought mine, and her smile\nseemed warm and inviting. She made again that strange little gesture of\ninvitation.\n\nWith an effort I glanced at Mercer. There was something devilishly\nfascinating about the girl's great, dark, searching eyes.\n\n\"I'm going in,\" I said hoarsely. \"Hand me one of your head-set things\nwhen I reach for it.\" Before he could protest, I dived into the pool.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI headed directly towards the heavy bronze ladder that led to the bottom\nof the pool. I had two reasons in mind. I would need something to keep\nme under water, with my lungs full of air, and I could get out quickly\nif it were necessary. I had not forgotten the livid, jagged furrows in\nMercer's side.\n\nQuickly as I shot to the ladder she was there before me, a dim, wavering\nwhite shape, waiting.\n\nI paused, holding to a rung of the ladder with one hand. She came\ncloser, walking with the airy grace I had noted before, and my heart\npounded against my ribs as she raised one long, slim arm towards me.\n\nThe hand dropped gently on my shoulder, pressed it as though in token\nof friendship. Perhaps, I thought quickly, this was, with her, a sign of\ngreeting. I lifted my own arm and returned the salutation, if salutation\nit were, aware of a strange rising and falling sound, as of a distant\nhumming, in my ears.\n\nThe sound ceased suddenly, on a rising note, as though of inquiry, and\nit dawned on me that I had heard the speech of this strange creature.\nBefore I could think of a course of action, my aching lungs reminded me\nof the need of air, and I released my hold on the ladder and let my body\nrise to the surface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs my head broke the water, a hand, cold and strong as steel, closed\naround my ankle. I looked down. The girl was watching me, and there was\nno smile on her face now.\n\n\"All right!\" I shouted across the pool to Mercer, who was watching\nanxiously. Then, filling my lungs with air again, I pulled myself, by\nmeans of the ladder, to the bottom of the pool. The restraining hand was\nremoved instantly.\n\nThe strange creature thrust her face close to mine as my feet touched\nbottom, and for the first time I saw her features distinctly.\n\nShe was beautiful, but in a weird, unearthly sort of way. As I had\nalready noticed, her eyes were of unusual size, and I saw now that they\nwere an intense shade of blue, with a pupil of extraordinary proportion.\nHer nose was well shaped, but the nostrils were slightly flattened, and\nthe orifices were rather more elongated than I had ever seen before. The\nmouth was utterly fascinating, and her teeth, revealed by her engaging\nsmile, were as perfect as it would be possible to imagine.\n\nThe great mane of hair which enveloped her was, as I have said, tawny in\nhue, and almost translucent, like the stems of some seaweeds I have\nseen. And as she raised one slim white hand to brush back some wisps\nthat floated by her face, I saw distinctly the webs between her\nfingers. They were barely noticeable, for they were as transparent as\nthe fins of a fish, but they were there, extending nearly to the last\njoint of each finger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs her face came close to my own, I became aware of the humming,\ncrooning sound I had heard before, louder this time. I could see, from\nthe movement of her throat, that I had been correct in assuming that she\nwas attempting to speak with me. I smiled back at her and shook my head.\nShe seemed to understand, for the sound ceased, and she studied me with\na little thoughtful frown, as though trying to figure out some other\nmethod of communication.\n\nI pointed upward, for I was feeling the need for fresh air again, and\nslowly mounted the ladder. This time she did not grasp me, but watched\nme intently, as though understanding what I did, and the reasons for\nit.\n\n\"Bring one of your gadgets over here, Mercer,\" I called across the pool.\n\"I think I'm making progress.\"\n\n\"Good boy!\" he cried, and came running with two of the antennae, the\nlong insulated cords trailing behind him. Through the water the girl\nwatched him, evident dislike in her eyes. She glanced at me with sudden\nsuspicion as Mercer handed me the two instruments, but made no hostile\nmove.\n\n\"You won't be able to stay in the water with her,\" explained Mercer\nrapidly. \"The salt water would short the antennae, you see. Try to get\nher to wear one, and then you get your head out of water, and don yours.\nAnd remember, she won't be able to communicate with us by words--we'll\nhave to get her to convey her thoughts by means of mental pictures. I'll\ntry to impress that on her. Understand?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded, and picked up one of the instruments. \"Fire when ready,\nGridley,\" I commented, and sank again to the bottom of the pool.\n\nI touched the girl's head with one finger, and then pointed to my own\nhead, trying to convey to her that she could get her thoughts to me.\nThen I held up the antennae and placed it on my own head to show that it\ncould not harm her.\n\nMy next move was to offer her the instrument, moving slowly, and smiling\nreassuringly--no mean feat under water.\n\nShe hesitated a moment, and then, her eyes fixed on mine, she slowly\nfixed the instrument over her own head as she had seen me adjust it upon\nmy own.\n\nI smiled and nodded, and pressed her shoulder in token of friendly\ngreeting. Then, gesturing toward my own head again, and pointing upward.\nI climbed the ladder.\n\n\"All right, Mercer,\" I shouted. \"Start at once, before she grows\nrestless!\"\n\n\"I've already started!\" he called back, and I hurriedly donned my own\ninstrument.\n\nBearing in mind what Mercer had said, I descended the ladder but a few\nrungs, so that my head remained out of water, and smiled down at the\ngirl, touching the instrument on my head, and then pointing to hers.\n\nI could sense Mercer's thoughts now. He was picturing himself walking\nlong the shore, with the stormy ocean in the background. Ahead of him I\nsaw the white body lying face downward in the pool. I saw him run up to\nthe pool and lift the slim, pale figure in his arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLet me make it clear, at this point, that when I say that I saw\nthese things, I mean only that mental images of them penetrated my\nconsciousness. I visualized them just as I could close my eyes and\nvisualize, for example, the fireplace in the living room of my own\nhome.\n\nI looked down at the girl. She was frowning, and her eyes were very\nwide. Her head was a little on one side, in the attitude of one who\nlistens intently.\n\nSlowly and carefully Mercer thought out the whole story of his\nexperiences with the girl until she had plunged into the pool. Then I\nsaw again the beach, with the girl's figure in the pool. The picture\ngrew hazy; I realized Mercer was trying to picture the bottom of the\nsea. Then he pictured again the girl lying in the pool, and once again\nthe sea. I was aware of the soft little tick in the center of my brain\nthat announced that the switch had been moved to another contact point.\n\nI glanced down at her. She was staring up at me with her great, curious\neyes, and I sensed, through the medium of the instrument I wore, that\nshe was thinking of me. I saw my own features, idealized, glowing with a\nstrange beauty that was certainly none of my own. I realized that I saw\nmyself, in short, as she saw me. I smiled back at her, and shook my\nhead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA strange, dim whirl of pictures swept through my consciousness. I was\non the bottom of the ocean. Shadowy shapes swept by silently, and from\nabove, a dim bluish light filtered down on a scene such as mortal eyes\nhave never seen.\n\nAll around were strange structures of jagged coral, roughly circular as\nto base, and rounded on top, resembling very much the igloos of the\nEskimos. The structures varied greatly in size, and seemed to be\narranged in some sort of regular order, like houses along a narrow\nstreet. Around many of them grew clusters of strange and colorful\nseaweeds that waved their banners gently, as though some imperceptible\ncurrent dallied with them in passing.\n\nHere and there figures moved, slim white figures that strolled along the\nnarrow street, or at times shot overhead like veritable torpedoes.\n\nThere were both men and women moving there. The men were broader of\nshoulder, and their hair, which they wore to their knees, was somewhat\ndarker in color than that of the women. Both sexes were slim, and there\nwas a remarkable uniformity of size and appearance.\n\nNone of the strange beings wore garments of any kind, nor were they\nnecessary. The clinging tresses were cinctured at the waist with a sort\nof cord of twisted orange-colored material, and some of the younger\nwomen wore bands of the same material around their brows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNearest of all the figures was the girl who was visualizing all this for\nus. She was walking slowly away from the cluster of coral structures.\nOnce or twice she paused, and seemed to hold conversation with others of\nthe strange people, but each time she moved on.\n\nThe coral structures grew smaller and poorer. Finally the girl trod\nalone on the floor of the ocean, between great growths of kelp and\nseaweeds, with dim, looming masses of faintly tinted coral everywhere.\nOnce she passed close to a tilted, ragged hulk of some ancient vessel,\nits naked ribs packed with drifted sand.\n\nSauntering dreamily, she moved away from the ancient derelict. Suddenly\na dim shadow swept across the sand at her feet, and she arrowed from the\nspot like a white, slim meteor. But behind her darted a black and\nswifter shadow--a shark!\n\nLike a flash she turned and faced the monster. Something she had drawn\nfrom her girdle shone palely in her hand. It was a knife of whetted\nstone or bone.\n\nDarting swiftly downward her feet spurned the yellow sand, and she shot\nat her enemy with amazing speed. The long blade swept in an arc, ripped\nthe pale belly of the monster just as he turned to dart away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA great cloud of blood dyed the water. The white figure of the girl shot\nonward through the scarlet flood.\n\nBlinded, she did not see that the jutting ribs of the ancient ship were\nin her path. I seemed to see her crash, head on, into one of the\nmassive timbers, and I cried out involuntarily, and glanced down at the\ngirl in the water at my feet.\n\nHer eyes were glowing. She knew that I had understood.\n\nHazily, then, I seemed to visualize her body floating limply in the\nwater. It was all very vague and indistinct, and I understood that this\nwas not what she had seen, but what she thought had happened. The\nimpressions grew wilder, swirled, grew gray and indistinct. Then I had a\nview of Mercer's face, so terribly distorted it was barely recognizable.\nThen a kaleidoscopic maze of inchoate scenes, shot through with flashes\nof vivid, agonizing colors. The girl was thinking of her suffering,\ntaken out of her native element. In trying to save her, Mercer had\nalmost killed her. That, no doubt, was why she hated him.\n\nMy own face appeared next, almost godlike in its kindliness and its\nimagined beauty, and I noticed now that she was thinking of me with my\nyellow hair grown long, my nostrils elongated like her own--adjusted to\nher own ideas of what a man should be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flung the instrument from my head and dropped to the bottom of the\npool. I gripped both her shoulders, gently, to express my thanks and\nfriendship.\n\nMy heart was pounding. There was a strange fascination about this girl\nfrom the depths of the sea, a subtle appeal that was answered from some\ndeep subterranean cavern of my being. I forgot, for the moment, who and\nwhat I was. I remembered only that a note had been sounded that awoke an\necho of a long-forgotten instinct.\n\nI think I kissed her. I know her arms were about me, and that I pressed\nher close, so that our faces almost met. Her great, weirdly blue eyes\nseemed to bore into my brain. I could feel them throbbing there....\n\nI forgot time and space. I saw only that pale, smiling face and those\ngreat dark eyes. Then, strangling, I tore myself from her embrace and\nshot to the surface.\n\nCoughing, I cleared my lungs of the water I had inhaled. I was weak and\nshaking when I finished, but my head was clear. The grip of the strange\nfantasy that had gripped me was shaken off.\n\nMercer was bending over me; speaking softly.\n\n\"I was watching, old man,\" he said gently. \"I can imagine what happened.\nA momentary, psychic fusing of an ancient, long since broken link. You,\ntogether with all mankind, came up out of the sea. But there is no\nretracing the way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded, my head bowed on my streaming chest.\n\n\"Sorry, Mercer,\" I muttered. \"Something got into me. Those big eyes of\nhers seemed to tug at threads of memory ... buried.... I can't describe\nit....\"\n\nHe slapped me on my naked shoulder, a blow that stung, as he had\nintended it to. It helped jerk me back to the normal.\n\n\"You've got your feet on the ground again, Taylor,\" he commented\nsoothingly. \"I think there's no danger of you losing your grip on terra\nfirma again. Shall we carry on?\"\n\n\"There's more you'd like to learn? That you think she can give us?\" I\nasked hesitantly.\n\n\"I believe,\" replied Mercer, \"that she can give us the history of her\npeople, if we can only make her understand what we wish. God! If we only\ncould!\" The name of the Deity was a prayer as Mercer uttered it.\n\n\"We can try, old-timer,\" I said, a bit shakenly.\n\nMercer hurried back to the other side of the pool, and I adjusted my\nhead-set again, smiling down at the girl. If only Mercer could make her\nunderstand, and if only she knew what we wanted to learn!\n\nI was conscious of the little click that told me the switch had been\nmoved. Mercer was ready to get his message to her.\n\nFixing my eyes on the girl pleadingly, I settled myself by the edge of\nthe pool to await the second and more momentous part of our experiment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vision was vague, for Mercer was picturing his thoughts with\ndifficulty. But I seemed to see again the floor of the ocean, with the\nvague light filtering down from above, and soft, monstrous growths\nwaving their branches lazily in the flood.\n\nFrom the left came a band of men and women, looking around as though in\nsearch of some particular spot. They stopped, and one of the older men\npointed, the others gathering around him as though in council.\n\nThen the band set to work. Coral growth were dragged to the spot. The\nfoundation for one of the semi-circular houses was laid. The scene\nswirled and cleared again. The house was completed. Several other houses\nwere in process of building.\n\nSlowly and deliberately, the scene moved. The houses were left behind.\nBefore my consciousness now was only a vague and shadowy expanse of\nocean floor, and in the sand dim imprints that marked where the strange\npeople had trod, the vague footprints disappearing in the gloom in the\ndirection from which the little weary band had come. To me, at least, it\nwas quite clear that Mercer was asking whence they came. Would it be as\nclear to the girl? The switch clicked, and for a moment I was sure\nMercer had not been able to make his question clear to her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scene was the interior of one of the coral houses. There were\npersons there, seated on stone or coral chairs, padded with marine\ngrowths. One of the occupants of the room was a very old man; his face\nwas wrinkled, and his hair was silvery. With him were a man and a woman,\nand a little girl. Somehow I seemed to recognize the child as the girl\nin the pool.\n\nThe three of them were watching the old man. While his lips did not\nmove, I could see his throat muscles twitching as the girl's had done\nwhen she made the murmuring sound I had guessed was her form of speech.\n\nThe scene faded. For perhaps thirty seconds I was aware of nothing more\nthan a dim gray mist that seemed to swirl in stately circles. Then,\ngradually, it cleared somewhat. I sensed the fact that what I saw now\nwas what the old man was telling, and that the majestic, swirling mist\nwas the turning back of time.\n\nHere was no ocean bottom, but land, rich tropical jungle. Strange exotic\ntrees and dense growths of rank undergrowth choked the earth. The trees\nwere oddly like undersea growths, which puzzled me for an instant. Then\nI recalled that the girl could interpret the old man's words only in\nterms of that which she had seen and understood. This was the way she\nvisualized the scene.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a gray haze of mist everywhere. The leaves were glistening\nwith condensed moisture; swift drops fell incessantly to the soaking\nground below.\n\nInto the scene roamed a pitiful band of people. Men with massive frames,\nsunken in with starvation, women tottering with weakness. The men\ncarried great clubs, some tipped with rudely shaped stone heads, and\nboth men and women clothed only in short kittles of skin.\n\nThey searched ceaselessly for something, and I guessed that something\nwas food. Now and then one or the other of the little band tore up a\nroot and bit at it, and those that did so soon doubled into a twitching\nknot of suffering and dropped behind.\n\nAt last they came to the edge of the sea. A few yards away the water was\nlost in the dense steaming miasma that hemmed them in on all sides.\nWith glad expressions on their faces, the party ran down to the edge of\nthe water and gathered up great masses of clams and crabs. At first they\nate the food raw, tearing the flesh from the shells. Then they made what\nI understood was a fire, although the girl was able to visualize it only\nas a bright red spot that flickered.\n\nThe scene faded, and there was only the slowly swirling mist that I\nunderstood indicated the passing of centuries. Then the scene cleared\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw that same shore line, but the people had vanished. There was only\nthe thick, steamy mist, the tropic jungle crowding down to the shore,\nand the waves rolling in monotonously from the waste of gray ocean\nbeyond the curtain of fog.\n\nSuddenly, from out of the sea, appeared a series of human heads, and\nthen a band of men and women that waded ashore and seated themselves\nupon the beach, gazing restlessly out across the sea.\n\nThis was not the same band I had seen at first. These were a slimmer\nrace, and whereas the first band had been exceedingly swarthy, these\nwere very fair.\n\nThey did not stay long on shore, for they were restless and ill at ease.\nIt seemed to me they came there only from force of habit, as though they\nobeyed some inner urge they did not understand. In a few seconds they\nrose and ran into the water, plunged into it as though they welcomed its\nembrace, and disappeared. Then again the vision was swallowed up by the\nswirling mists of time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the scene cleared again, it showed the bottom of the sea. A group\nof perhaps a hundred pale creatures moved along the dim floor of the\nocean. Ahead I could see the dim outlines of one of their strange\ncities. The band approached, seemed to talk with those there, and moved\non.\n\nI saw them capture and kill fish for food, saw them carve the thick,\nspongy hearts from certain giant growths and eat them. I saw a pair of\nkiller sharks swoop down on the band, and the quick, deadly accuracy\nwith which both men and woman met the attack. One man, older than the\nrest, was injured before the sharks were vanquished, and when their\nefforts to staunch his wounds proved unavailing, they left him there and\nmoved on. And as they left I saw a dim, crawling shape move closer,\nthrow out a long, whiplike tentacle, and wrap the body in a hungry\nembrace.\n\nThey came to and passed other communities of beings like themselves, and\na city of their own, in much the way that Mercer had visualized it.\n\nFading, the scene changed to the interior of the coral house again. The\nold man finished his story, and moved off into a cubicle in the rear of\nthe place. Dimly, I could see there a low couch, piled high with soft\nmarine growths. Then the scene shifted once more.\n\nA man and a woman hurried up and down the narrow streets of the strange\ncity the girl had pictured when she showed us how she had met with the\nshark, and struck her head, so that for a long period she lost\nconsciousness and was washed ashore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOthers, after a time, joined them in their search, which spread out to\nthe floor of the ocean, away from the dwellings. One party came to the\ngaunt skeleton of the ancient wreck, and found the scattered,\nfresh-picked bones of the shark the girl had killed. The man and the\nwoman came up, and I looked closely into their faces. The woman's\nfeatures were torn with grief; the man's lips were set tight with\nsuffering. Here, it was easy to guess, were the mother and the father of\nthe girl.\n\nA milling mass of white forms shot through the water in every direction,\nsearching. It seemed that they were about to give up the search when\nsuddenly, from out of the watery gloom, there shot a slim white\nfigure--the girl!\n\nStraight to the mother and father she came, gripping the shoulder of\neach with frantic joy. They returned the caress, the crowd gathered\naround them, listening to her story as they moved slowly, happily,\ntowards the distant city.\n\nInstead of a picture, I was conscious then of a sound, like a single\npleading word repeated softly, as though someone said \"Please! Please!\nPlease!\" over and over again. The sound was not at all like the English\nword. It was a soft, musical beat, like the distant stroke of a mellow\ngong, but it had all the pleading quality of the word it seemed to bring\nto mind.\n\nI looked down into the pool. The girl had mounted the ladder until her\nface was just below the surface of the water. Her eyes met mine and I\nknew that I had not misunderstood.\n\nI threw off the instrument on my head, and dropped down beside her. With\nboth hands I grasped her shoulders, and, smiling, I nodded my head\nvigorously.\n\nShe understood, I know she did. I read it in her face. When I climbed\nthe ladder again, she looked after me, smiling confidently.\n\nAlthough I had not spoken to her, she had read and accepted the\npromise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMercer stared at me silently, grimly, as I told him what I wished.\nWhatever eloquence I may have, I used on him, and I saw his cold,\nscientific mind waver before the warmth of my appeal.\n\n\"We have no right to keep her from her people,\" I concluded. \"You saw\nher mother and father, saw their suffering, and the joy her return would\nbring. You will, Mercer--you will return her to the sea?\"\n\nFor a long time, Mercer did not reply. Then he lifted his dark eyes to\nmine, and smiled, rather wearily.\n\n\"It is the only thing we can do, Taylor,\" he said quietly. \"She is not a\nscientific specimen; she is, in her way, as human as you or I. She\nwould probably die, away from her own kind, living under conditions\nforeign to her. And you promised her, Taylor, whether you spoke your\npromise or not.\" His smile deepened a bit. \"We cannot let her receive\ntoo bad an opinion of her cousins who live above the surface of the\nsea!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so, just as the dawn was breaking, we took her to the shore. I\ncarried her, unresisting, trustful, in my arms, while Mercer bore a huge\nbasin of water, in which her head was submerged, so that she might not\nsuffer.\n\nStill in our bathing suits we waded out into the ocean, until the waves\nsplashed against our faces. Then I lowered her into the sea. Crouching\nthere, so that the water was just above the tawny glory of her hair, she\ngazed up at us. Two slim white hands reached towards us, and with one\naccord, Mercer and I bent towards her. She gripped both our shoulders\nwith a gentle pressure, smiling at us.\n\nThen she did a strange thing. She pointed, under the water, out towards\nthe depths and with a broad, sweeping motion of her arm, indicated the\nshore, as though to say that she intended to return. With a last swift,\nsmiling glance up into my face, she turned. There was a flash of white\nthrough the water. She was gone....\n\nSilently, through the silence and beauty of the dawn, we made our way\nback to the house.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we passed through the laboratory, Mercer glanced out at the empty\npool.\n\n\"Man came up from the sea,\" he said slowly, \"and some men went back to\nit. They were forced back to the teeming source from whence they came,\nfor lack of food. You saw that, Taylor--saw her forebears become\namphibians, like the now extinct Dipneusta and Ganoideii, or the still\nexisting Neoceratodus, Polypterus and Amia. Then their lungs became, in\neffect, gills, and they lost their power of breathing atmospheric air,\nand could use only air dissolved in water.\n\n\"A whole people there beneath the waves that land-man never dreamed\nof--except, perhaps, the sailors of olden days, with their tales of\nmermaids, which we are accustomed to laugh at in our wisdom!\"\n\n\"But why were no bodies ever washed ashore?\" I asked. \"I would think--\"\n\n\"You saw why,\" interrupted Mercer grimly. \"The ocean teems with hungry\nlife. Death is the signal for a feast. It was little more than a miracle\nthat her body came ashore, a miracle due perhaps to the storm which sent\nthe hungry monsters to the greater depths. And even had a body come\nashore it would have been buried as that of some unknown, unfortunate\nhuman. The differences between these people and ourselves would not be\nnoticeable to a casual observer.\n\n\"No, Taylor, we have been party to what was close to a miracle. And we\nare the only witnesses to it, you and Carson and myself. And\"--he sighed\ndeeply--\"it is over.\"\n\nI did not reply. I was thinking of the girl's odd gesture, at parting,\nand I wondered if it were indeed a finished chapter.\n\n\n\n\nVandals of the Stars\n\n_By A. T. Locke_\n\n    A livid flame flares across Space--and over Manhattan hovers\n    Teuxical, vassal of Malfero, Lord of the Universe, who comes\n    with ten thousand warriors to ravage and subjugate one more\n    planet for his master.\n\n[Illustration: _Many planes and Zeppelins were circling around the\nmysterious visitant._]\n\n\nIt came suddenly, without warning, and it brought consternation to the\npeople of the world.\n\nA filament of flame darted down the dark skies one moonless night and\nthose who saw it believed, at first, that it was a meteor. Instead of\nstreaking away into oblivion, however, it became larger and larger,\nuntil it seemed as though some vagrant, blazing star was about to plunge\ninto the earth and annihilate the planet and every vestige of life upon\nit. But then it drew slowly to a stop high up in the atmosphere, where\nit remained motionless, glowing white and incandescent against the\nStygian background of the overcast skies.\n\nIn shape it resembled a Zeppelin, but its dimensions very apparently\nexceeded by far those of any flying craft that ever had been fabricated\nby the hand of man.\n\nAs it hung poised high up in the air it gradually lost its dazzling glow\nand became scarlet instead of white. Then, as it continued to cool, the\ncolor swiftly drained from it and, in a few minutes, it shone only with\nthe dull and ugly crimson of an expiring ember. In a half-hour after it\nfirst had appeared its effulgence had vanished completely and it was\nbarely visible to the millions who were staring up toward it from the\nearth.\n\nIt seemed to be suspended directly above Manhattan, and the inhabitants\nof New York were thrown into a feverish excitement by the strange and\nunprecedented phenomenon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor it scarcely had come to a stop, and certainly it had not been poised\naloft for more than a few minutes, when most of those who had not\nactually witnessed its sensational appearance were apprised of the\ninexplicable occurrence by the radiovision, which were scattered\nthroughout the vast metropolis. In theaters and restaurants and other\ngathering places, as well as in millions of homes, a voice from the\nWorldwide Broadcasting Tower announced the weird visitant. And its\nimage, as it glowed in the night, was everywhere transmitted to the\npublic.\n\nOnly a short time after it first had been observed people were thronging\nroof-tops, terraces, and streets, and gazing with awe and wonder at the\ngreat luminous object that was floating high above them.\n\nThere were those who thought that the world was coming to an end, and\nthey either were dumb with fright or strident with hysteria. People with\nmore judgment, and a smattering of scientific knowledge, dismissed the\nthing as some harmless meteorological manifestation that, while\ninteresting, was not necessarily dangerous. And there were many,\ninclined to incredulity and skepticism, who believed that they were\nwitnessing a hoax or an advertising scheme of some new sort.\n\nBut as the moments went by the world commenced to become stirred and\nalarmed by the reports which came over the radiovisors.\n\nFor powerful planes and metal-shelled Zeppelins had climbed swiftly\naloft to investigate the incomprehensible Thing that was poised high\nabove Manhattan, and almost unbelievable reports were being sent\nearthward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk Vanderpool had been sitting alone on the broad terrace of his\napartment that occupied the upper stories of the great Gotham Gardens\nBuilding when he saw that streak of fire slip down against the darkness\nof the night.\n\nFor a moment he, too, had believed that he was watching a meteor, but,\nwhen he saw it come to a slow stop and hang stationary in the heavens,\nhe rose to his feet with an exclamation of surprise.\n\nFor a while he gazed upward with an expression of astonishment on his\nface and then he turned as he heard someone walking softly in his\ndirection. It was Barstowe, his valet, and the eyes of the man were\nalive with fear.\n\n\"What is that thing, Mr. Vanderpool?\" he asked in a voice that trembled\nwith alarm. Barstowe was a man of middle age, diminutive in size, and he\nhad the appearance of being nearly petrified with terror. \"They are\nsaying over the televisor that--\"\n\n\"What are they saying about it?\" asked Dirk somewhat impatiently.\n\n\"That no one can explain what it is,\" continued Barstowe. \"It must be\nsomething terrible, Mr. Vanderpool.\"\n\n\"Wheel out the luciscope,\" ordered Dirk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBarstowe disappeared into the apartment and returned with a cabinet that\nwas mounted on small, rubber-tired wheels. The top of it was formed of a\nmetallic frame in which a heavy, circular, concave glass was fitted. The\nframe was hinged in front so that it could be raised from the rear and\nadjusted to any angle necessary to catch the light rays from any distant\nobject. Within the cabinet the rays passed through an electrical device\nthat amplified them millions of times, thus giving a clear, telescopic\nvision of the object on which the luciscope was focused.\n\nThis instrument, years before, had supplanted entirely the old-fashioned\ntelescopes which not only had been immense and unwieldly but which also\nhad a very limited range of vision.\n\nDirk adjusted the light-converger so that it caught the rays that were\nbeing emanated by the weird and shimmering mass that was suspended\nalmost directly above the lofty terrace on which he was standing.\n\nThen he switched on the current and glanced into the eye-piece of the\napparatus. For several moments he remained silent, studying the image\nthat was etched so vividly on the ground-glass within the luciscope.\n\n\"It is a queer thing, there is no doubt about that,\" he confessed when\nfinally he raised his head. \"It resembles a gigantic Zeppelin in shape\nbut it does not seem to have any undercarriage or, as far as I can see,\nany indication of propellers or portholes. I would say, though,\nBarstowe, that it might be a ship from some other planet if it wasn't\nfor the fact that it seems to be in an almost molten state.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk again looked into the luciscope and then he made a few adjustments\nwith a thumb-screw that projected from the side of the apparatus.\n\n\"It is up about forty thousand feet,\" he told Barstowe, \"and it must be\nmore than a half-mile in length. Probably,\" he added, \"it is a planetary\nfragment of some odd composition that is less responsive to gravitation\nthan the materials with which we are familiar. You will find, Barstowe,\nthat there is nothing about it that science will not be able to explain.\nThat will be all now,\" he concluded.\n\nBarstowe walked over the terrace and disappeared into the apartment.\nDirk, left alone, wheeled the luciscope over by the chair in which he\nhad been sitting and near which a radiovisor was standing.\n\nHe switched on the latter and listened to the low but very distinct\nvoice of the news-dispatcher.\n\n\"--and planes and Zeppelins now are starting up to investigate the\nstrange phenomenon--\"\n\nAgain Dirk placed an eye to the lens of the luciscope and once more the\nThing leaped into his vision. The powerful machine brought it so close\nto him that he could see the heat waves quiver up from it.\n\nThe light that it radiated illuminated the night for thousands of feet\nand Dirk could see, by means of that crimson glare, that many planes and\nZeppelins were circling around the mysterious visitant. None of them,\nhowever, approached the alien freak, the heat apparently being too\nintense to permit close inspection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk himself was tempted for a moment to jump into a plane and go up and\ntake a look at the fiery mass.\n\nBut, after a moment's consideration, he decided, that it would be far\nmore interesting and comfortable to remain right where he was and listen\nto the reports which were being sent down from above.\n\n\"--thus far there seems to be no cause for alarm, and people are advised\nto remain calm--careful observations of the luminous monster are being\nmade and further reports concerning it will be broadcast--\"\n\nDirk Vanderpool rose to his feet, walked to the coping of the terrace\nand peered into the magnascope that was set into the wall.\n\nHe saw that the street, far below him, was jammed with struggling people\nand the device through which he was looking brought their faces before\nhim in strong relief. Dirk was deeply interested and, at the same time,\ngravely concerned as he studied the upturned countenances in the mob.\n\nFear, despair, reckless abandon, mirth, doubt, religious ecstasy and all\nthe other nuances in the gamut of human emotions and passions were\nreflected in those distorted visages which were gazing skyward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe silvery humming of a bell diverted his attention from the scene of\ncongestion below him and, turning away, he walked across the terrace and\ninto the great living room of his luxurious abode.\n\nStepping to the televisor, he turned a tiny switch, and the face of a\ngirl appeared in the glass panel that was framed above the sound-box. He\nsmiled as he lifted the receiver and placed it to his ear.\n\n\"What is the matter, Inga?\" he asked. \"You look as if you were\nexpecting--well, almost anything disastrous.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dirk, what is that thing?\" the girl asked. \"I really am frightened!\"\n\nHe could see by the expression in her blue eyes that she, too, was\nbecoming a victim of the hysteria that was taking possession of many\npeople.\n\n\"I wouldn't be alarmed, Inga,\" he replied reassuringly. \"I don't know\nwhat it is, and no one else seems to be able to explain it.\"\n\n\"But it is frightful and uncanny, Dirk,\" the girl insisted, \"and I am\nsure that something terrible is going to happen. I wish,\" she pleaded,\n\"that you would come over and stay with me for a little while. I am all\nalone and--\"\n\n\"All right, Inga,\" he told her. \"I will be with you in a few minutes.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver of the televisor and clicked off the switch. The\nimage of the golden-haired girl to whom he had been speaking slowly\nfaded from the glass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAttiring himself for a short sixty-mile hop down Long Island, Dirk\npassed out to the landing stage and, stepping into the cabin of his\nplane, he threw in the helicopter lever. The machine rose straight into\nthe air for a couple of hundred feet and then Dirk headed it westward to\nwhere the nearest ascension beam sent its red light towering toward the\nstars. It marked a vertical air-lane that led upward to the horizontal\nlanes of flight.\n\nNorthbound ships flew between two and four thousand feet; southbound\nplanes between five and seven thousand feet; those eastbound confined\nthemselves to the level between nine and eleven thousand feet, while the\nwestbound flyers monopolized the air between twelve and fourteen\nthousand feet.\n\nAll planes flying parallel to the earth were careful to avoid those red\nbeacons which marked ascension routes, and the shafts of green light\ndown which descending planes dropped to the earth or into lower levels\nof travel.\n\nWhen Dirk's altimeter indicated seventy-five hundred feet he turned the\nnose of his ship eastward and adjusted his rheostat until his motors,\nfed by wireless current, were revolving at top speed.\n\nThe great canyons of Manhattan, linked by arches and highways which\njoined and passed through various levels of the stupendous structures of\nsteelite and quartzite, passed swiftly beneath him; and, after passing\nfor a few minutes over the deserted surface of Long Island, he completed\nhis sixty-mile flight and brought his ship to a rest on a landing stage\nthat was far up on the side of a vast pile that rose up close to the\nshore of the Sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as he stepped from the door of the cabin he was joined by a girl\nwho, apparently, had been lingering there, awaiting his arrival.\n\nShe was perhaps twenty years old, and she had the golden hair, the light\ncomplexion, and the blue eyes which still were characteristic of the\nwomen of northern Europe.\n\nThe slender lines of her exquisite figure and the supple grace which she\ndisplayed when she moved toward Dirk were evidence, however, of the\nLatin blood which was in her veins.\n\nFor Inga Fragoni, the daughter and heiress of Orlando Fragoni, seemed to\nbe a culmination of all of the desirable qualities of the women of the\nsouth and those of the north.\n\nThe terrace on which Dirk had landed was illuminated by lights which\nsimulated sunshine, and their soft bright glow revealed the violet hue\nof her eyes and the shimmering gloss of her silken hair. She wore a\nsleeveless, light blue tunic which was gathered around her waist with a\nbejeweled girdle.\n\nOn her tiny feet she wore sandals which were spun of webby filaments of\ngold and platinum.\n\n\"Dirk, I am so glad that you are here!\" she exclaimed. \"I felt so much\nalone when I called you up. Dad is locked in the observatory with\nProfessor Nachbaren and three or four other men and the servants--well,\nthey all are so terrified that it simply alarms me to have them\naround.\"\n\n\"But that is Stanton's plane there, isn't it?\" asked Dirk, indicating a\npowerful looking machine that stood on the terrace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, Dirk,\" the girl replied. \"He arrived here three or four minutes\nbefore you did. I thought, at first, that it was you coming. And Dirk,\"\nshe continued, with a note of excitement in her voice, \"he flew up to\nlook at that thing, and I know that he is as frightened about it as I\nam.\"\n\nDirk grunted, but he gave no expression of the dislike and distrust that\nStanton aroused in him. The latter, he knew, was very much inclined to\nlook with favor on Inga, and his presumption annoyed Dirk because, while\nhe and the girl had not declared their intention of living together,\nthey were very much in love with each other.\n\n\"You will want to hear him tell about it, I know, Dirk,\" the girl said.\n\"I left Stanton up on the garden terrace when I saw you coming down.\nCome; we will go and join him.\"\n\nDirk and Inga strolled slowly along paths which were lined with exotic\nshrubbery and plants. Here and there a fountain tossed its glittering\nspray high into the air while birds, invisible in the feathery foliage,\nwarbled and thrilled entrancingly. Soft music, transmitted from the\nauditoriums below, blended so harmoniously with the atmosphere of the\nterraces that it seemed to mingle with and be a part of the drifting,\nsubtle scents of the abundant flowers which bloomed on every side.\n\nFor these upper terraces of Fragoni's palace were enclosed, during\ninclement weather, with great glass plates which, at the touch of a\nbutton, automatically appeared or disappeared.\n\nWinding their way easily upward, Dirk and Inga came finally to a\nsecluded terrace which overlooked the Sound. Here they saw Stanton, who\nwas unaware of their approach, looking skyward at the dim and sinister\nshape which was outlined against the sky. Stanton's brow was contracted\nand his expression was filled with apprehension. He started suddenly\nwhen he became conscious of the presence of Dirk and the lovely daughter\nof Fragoni.\n\nHe rose to his feet, a short man in his forties, stocky in build and\nsomewhat swarthy in complexion. He contrasted very unfavorably with\nDirk, who was tall and well-built and who had abundant blond hair and\nsteady steel-blue eyes.\n\n\"What do you make of that thing, Vanderpool?\" he asked, almost ignoring\nthe presence of Inga.\n\n\"I don't know enough about it yet to be able to express an opinion,\"\nDirk replied. \"We will find out about it soon enough,\" he added, \"so why\nworry about it in the meantime?\"\n\n\"It is well enough to affect such an attitude,\" said Stanton, with a\ntouch of sarcasm in his voice, \"but let me tell you, Vanderpool, that\nthere is good reason to worry about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk frowned at the statement as he saw a shadow pass over the fair face\nof Inga.\n\n\"That thing up there,\" continued Stanton, with conviction in his voice,\n\"is not a natural phenomenon. I flew fairly close to it in my plane and\nI know what I am speaking about. That thing is some sort of a monster,\nVanderpool, that is made of metal or of some composition that is an\nunearthly equivalent of metal. It is a diabolical creation of some sort\nthat has come from out of the fathomless depths of the universe.\" He\nshuddered at the fantasy that his feverish imagination was creating. \"It\nis metal, I tell you,\" he continued, \"but it is metal that is endowed\nwith some sort of intelligence. I was up there,\" he breathed swiftly,\n\"and I saw it hanging there in the sky, quivering with heat and life.\"\n\n\"You are nervous, Stanton,\" said Vanderpool coolly. \"Get a grip on\nyourself, man, and look at the thing reasonably. If that thing has\nintelligence,\" he added, \"we will find some way to slay it.\"\n\n\"Slay it!\" exclaimed Stanton. \"How can you expect to slay a mad creation\nthat can leap through space, from world to world, like a wasp goes\ndarting from flower to flower? How can you kill a thing which not only\ndefies absolute zero but also the immeasurable heat which its friction\nwith the atmosphere generated when it plunged toward the earth? How can\nyou kill a thing that seems to have brains and nerves and bones and\nflesh of some strange substance that is harder and tougher than any\nearthly compound we have discovered?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped speaking for a moment. They listened to the voice that was\nbroadcasting from the Worldwide Tower.\n\n\"--our planes have approached to within a few thousand feet of it\nand are playing their searchlights over the surface of the leviathan.\nIt is not a meteorite of any kind that scientists have heretofore\nexamined--its surface is smooth and unpitted and shows no apparent\neffect of the tremendous heat to which it was subjected during its drop\nthrough the atmosphere. It seems to be immune to gravity--its weight\nmust be tremendous, and it is fully three-quarters of a mile long and\nbetween seven and eight hundred feet in diameter at its widest part, but\nit lies motionless--motionless--at about forty thousand feet.\"\n\n\"It doesn't appear now as if it would prove very dangerous,\" remarked\nDirk.\n\n\"--and people are warned again to maintain their composure and to go to\ntheir homes and remain there for their own protection and the protection\nof others. Riots and serious disturbances are reported from cities in\nall parts of the world--mobs are swarming the streets of Manhattan and\nthe other boroughs of New York, and the police are finding it difficult\nto restrain the frenzied populations in other centers....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a pause, then, of some moments, and then the voice of the\nbroadcaster, vibrant with excitement, was heard again.\n\n\"--a plane has made a landing on the surface of the monstrosity, which,\nit seems, has not only lost its heat but is becoming decidedly cold--\"\n\nA servant appeared from among the shrubbery and paused before Dirk.\n\n\"There is a call for you, Mr. Vanderpool,\" he said respectfully.\n\nDirk excused himself and, entering the sumptuous apartment that opened\nfrom the terrace, went to the televisor. He saw the face of Sears, the\nchief secretary of Fragoni, in the glass panel.\n\n\"There will be a meeting of the council at nine o'clock in the morning,\nMr. Vanderpool,\" came the voice over the wire.\n\n\"Thank you, Sears,\" replied Dirk. \"It happens that Stanton is here at\nthe present time. Shall I notify him of the conclave?\"\n\n\"If you will, please,\" Sears responded. \"By the way, Mr. Vanderpool, is\nthere anything wrong at your apartment? I tried to call you there before\nI located you here and I failed to get any response.\"\n\n\"I guess that all of my servants have run out from under cover because\nof their fear of that thing in the sky,\" Dirk responded. \"Do you know\nanything about it, Sears?\" he asked.\n\n\"It will be discussed at the meeting to-morrow morning,\" replied Sears\nshortly. \"Good night, Mr. Vanderpool.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk, upon returning to the terrace, saw that both Stanton and Inga were\nsilently and fearfully looking up into the night.\n\n\"A meeting of the council at nine o'clock in the morning, Stanton,\" Dirk\nsaid abruptly. \"I told Sears I would notify you.\"\n\n\"I thought that we would be called together very soon,\" said Stanton.\n\"It's concerning that damn thing up there.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" agreed Dirk carelessly. \"Well,\" he added, \"I believe that I\nwill hop home and get some sleep.\"\n\n\"Sleep!\" exclaimed Stanton. \"Sleep? On a night like this?\"\n\n\"Oh, Dirk,\" pleaded Inga, \"stay here with me, won't you? I am not going\nto bed because I just know that I wouldn't be able to close my eyes.\"\n\n\"Let him go, Inga, if he wants to sleep,\" urged Stanton. \"I will stay\nhere and keep watch with you.\"\n\n\"--and if order is not restored in the streets of Manhattan within the\ncourse of a short time, the authorities will resort to morphite gas to\nquell the turbulence and rioting--\"\n\n\"The streets must be frightfully congested,\" said Inga. \"It is the first\noccasion in a long time that the police have had to threaten the use of\nmorphite.\"\n\n\"--we do not want to alarm people unnecessarily but we have to report,\"\ncame the hurried voice of the broadcaster, \"that the monstrous mass that\nhas been hanging above the city just made a sudden drop of five thousand\nfeet and again came to a stop. It is now a little more than six miles\nover Manhattan and--again it has dropped. This time it fell like a\nplummet for twelve thousand feet. It is now about twenty thousand feet,\nsome four miles, above Manhattan and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA cry of alarm came from the lips of Inga as she gazed upward and saw\nthat gigantic, ominous-appearing object loom dim and vast in the\ndarkness above them.\n\nShe went to Dirk and threw her arms around him, as if she were clinging\nto him for protection.\n\n\"Don't leave me, Dirk,\" she whispered. \"I can just feel that something\nterrible is going to happen, and I want you with me!\"\n\n\"I'll stay with you, of course,\" whispered Dirk. Something of that\nfeeling of dread and apprehension which so fully possessed his two\ncompanions entered into his mind. \"Don't tremble so, Inga,\" he pleaded.\n\"It is a strange thing, but we will know more about it in the morning.\nBe calm until then, my dear, if you can.\"\n\nHe looked over the shoulder of the girl, whose face was buried against\nhis breast, and he saw a hundred great red and green shafts of light\nshooting up into the air. Fleeting shadows seemed to pass swiftly up and\ndown them, and he knew that thousands of planes were abroad, some of\nthem seeking the heights and others dropping down.\n\nThe great towers of Long Island were all aglow, and it was apparent that\nfew people were sleeping that night. The scarlet sky over Manhattan\nindicated that the center of the metropolis, too, was alive to the\nmenace of the weird visitant that now was so plainly visible.\n\nAll night long they remained on the terrace. Dirk and Inga seated close\ntogether and Stanton, at a distance, brooding alone over the disaster\nwhich he felt was impending.\n\nThe illuminated dial of the great clock that was a part of the\nbeacon-tower on the Metropole Landing Field told of the slow passing of\nthe hours.\n\nAll night long they listened to the reports that came through the\nradiovisor and watched that immobile, threatening monster of metal.\n\nBut it remained static during the rest of the night. And, with the\ncoming of a gray and sunless dawn, it still hung there, motionless,\nsilent and sinister.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning the President of the United States of the World, from\nthe capitol at The Hague, issued a proclamation of martial law, to\nbecome effective at once in all parts of the world.\n\nThe edict forbade people to leave their homes, and it was vigorously\nexecuted, wherever the police themselves were not in a state of\ndemoralization.\n\nAt about the same time a special meeting of the Supreme Congress was\ncalled, the body to remain in session until some solution of the mystery\nhad been arrived at.\n\nAt the same time that martial law was declared, however, and the special\nassemblage of lawmakers convened, a statement was issued in which an\nattempt was made to eliminate from the minds of the people the idea that\nthe undefinable object above the metropolis was at all dangerous.\n\nIt was, indeed, suggested that it very probably was some sort of new\ndevice which had been constructed on the earth and which was being\nintroduced to the people of the world in a somewhat sensational manner\nby the person or persons who were responsible for it.\n\nThe fears of the populace were, to some extent, allayed by this means,\nand some degree of order restored.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock Dirk Vanderpool was shown into the council chamber in\nthe palace of Orlando Fragoni, and he was closely followed by Stanton.\nFragoni was already there, and he greeted the two men with a countenance\nthat was serene but that, nevertheless, revealed indications of concern.\nHe was a man past middle age, tall and strikingly handsome in\nappearance. His eyes were dark and penetrating and his forehead, high\nand wide, was crowned by an abundance of snow-white hair. His voice,\nwhile pleasing to the ear, was vibrant with life and energy, and he\nspoke with the incisive directness of one accustomed to command.\n\nFor Orlando Fragoni, as nearly as any one man might be, was the ruler of\nthe world.\n\nIt was in the early part of the twentieth century that wealth had\ncommenced to concentrate into a relatively few hands. This was followed\nby a period in which vast mergers and consolidations had been effected\nas a result of the financial power and genius for organization which a\nfew men possessed. A confederation of the countries of the world was\nbrought about by industrial kings who had learned, in one devastating\nwar, that militarism, while it might bring riches to a few, was, in the\nfinal analysis, destructive and wasteful.\n\nMankind the world over, relieved of the menace of war, made more\nprogress in a decade than they had made in any previous century, but all\nthe time the invisible concentration of power and money continued.\n\nAnd, in 1975, the affairs of the world were controlled by five men, of\nwhom Orlando Fragoni was the most powerful and most important.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis grandfather had been a small banker, and out of his obscure\ntransactions the great House of Fragoni had arisen. The money power of\nthe world was now controlled by Orlando Fragoni. Dirk Vanderpool, partly\nas a result of a vast inheritance and partly through his own ability and\nuntiring industry, dominated the transportation facilities of the world.\nPlanes and Zeppelins, railroad equipment and ships, were built in his\nplants and operated by the many organizations which he controlled.\n\nStanton had inherited the agricultural activities of the world and, in\naddition to this, he was the sovereign of distribution. He owned immense\nacreages in all of the continents; he not only cultivated every known\nvariety of produce, but also handled the sale of his products through\nhis own great chains of stores. His father had been one of the great\ngeniuses of the preceding generation, but Stanton, while inheriting the\ncommercial empire which he had ruled, had not inherited much of the\nability which had gone into the establishment of it.\n\nThere were two other members of that invisible council of Five, the\nvery existence of which was not even suspected by the general populace\nof the world.\n\nSigmund Lazarre was the world's mightiest builder, and millions of great\nstructures, which were built of material from his own mines, were under\nhis control. It was Lazarre, too, who owned the theaters and other\namusement centers in which millions upon millions of people sought\nrelaxation every day. The creation and application of electrical power\nmade up the domain of Wilhelm Steinholt, who also owned the factories\nthat made the machinery of the world.\n\nAbsolute control of all of the necessities and luxuries of life, in\nfact, were in the hands of the five men, who used their vast power\nwisely and beneficently.\n\nOstensibly the peoples of the world ruled themselves by means of a\ndemocratic form of government.\n\nIn reality their lives were directed by a few men whose power and wealth\nwere entirely unsuspected by any but those who were close to them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe council room in which Fragoni had received Dirk and Stanton was\nlofty and sumptuously appointed.\n\nThe rugs which covered the floor were soft to the tread, and the walls\nand ceiling were adorned with a series of murals which represented the\nvarious heavenly constellations.\n\nAt the far end of the chamber there was a staircase, and Dirk was among\nthose who knew that it led up to the great observatory in which Fragoni\nand certain of his scientific associates spent so much of their time at\nnight.\n\nFor men had commenced to talk about the conquest of the stars, and it\nwas generally believed that it would not be many years more before a way\nwould be found to traverse the interplanetary spaces.\n\n\"We are rather fortunate, my friends,\" Fragoni said to his two\nassociates, \"to have been the witnesses of the event that transpired\nlast night.\"\n\n\"Fortunate!\" exclaimed Stanton. \"Then you know that the thing is\nharmless?\"\n\nA little smile lit the benign and scholarly countenance of Fragoni as he\ncalmly regarded Stanton.\n\n\"We know very little about it,\" he replied after a brief pause, \"and, if\nour surmises are correct, it may be very far from harmless. It is\nintensely interesting, nevertheless,\" he continued, \"because that thing,\nas you term it, unquestionably is directed by intelligence. Without the\nslightest doubt the people of the earth are about to behold a form of\nlife from some far-away planet. What that form will be,\" he added, with\nan almost imperceptible shrug of his shoulders, \"it is impossible to\nforecast.\"\n\n\"But it was so hot,\" commenced Stanton, \"that--\"\n\n\"True,\" agreed Fragoni, \"but it also is large and it may be that only\nthe outer shell of it was affected by friction with the atmosphere that\nsurrounds the earth. Nachbaren,\" he continued, \"is certain that there is\nintelligent life within it; and Nachbaren,\" he added dryly, \"is usually\nright.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Fragoni had been speaking, two more men had quietly joined them.\n\n\"Good morning, Lazarre,\" Fragoni said, addressing a short, swarthy man\nwho, very apparently, was of Jewish extraction.\n\n\"Good morning,\" the other replied in a soft and mellifluous voice. \"It\nseems,\" he continued, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"as if some of my\npretty buildings may be toppled over soon.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Fragoni. \"And maybe,\" he added more seriously, \"much\nmore than your buildings will be toppled over, Lazarre.\"\n\n\"That thing, then, is...?\" questioned the heavy-set, slow-speaking,\nblue-eyed Teuton who had come into the room with Lazarre.\n\n\"We do not know, Steinholt,\" admitted Fragoni, \"but our knowledge\nundoubtedly will be increased considerably within the next few hours.\nAnd now,\" he said, \"we will consider the problem at hand.\"\n\n\"--the object which has created such unrest is slowly rising. It is now\nsome twenty-five thousand feet above Manhattan. It is--\"\n\nThe voice from the radiovisor attracted the attention of the five men,\nand, with one accord, they rushed to the terrace and looked toward\nManhattan. They saw the great leviathan high in the air for a moment,\nand then, suddenly, it seemed to vanish from sight.\n\n\"It's gone!\" exclaimed Stanton, with a sigh of relief. \"It must have\nbeen some odd atmospheric freak, that's all.\"\n\nThey searched the skies through the luciscope that was on the terrace,\nbut failed to detect any trace of the monster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That seems to simplify matters,\" remarked Fragoni as they again walked\nback into the great conference room. But here, once more, they heard the\nvoice from the Worldwide Tower.\n\n\"--we are advised by Chicago that the thing, dull-red with heat, is\nhovering only a couple of thousand feet over the city. Thousands in the\nstreets are being killed by the heat it is radiating--panic reigns,\ndespite a rigorous enforcement of martial law. The strange object just\nrose suddenly to a high altitude and disappeared--\"\n\n\"It's another one of those damned things,\" asserted Stanton. \"That\ncouldn't go a thousand miles a minute!\"\n\n\"It can go faster than that, if I am not mistaken,\" said Fragoni. And it\npresently appeared that he was right, for in a couple of minutes the\nradiovisor transmitted the news that it was over San Francisco, where it\nremained for only a few seconds. It was not more than a minute later\nthat word came from Shanghai that it had passed slowly over that city.\nThen again it was poised high over Manhattan, crimson with heat.\n\n\"Is there any possible defense against it, Steinholt?\" Fragoni asked.\nThe Teuton shook his head with an air of finality.\n\n\"None,\" he said, \"as far as I can determine now. We can create and\ndirect artificial lightning that would reduce this building to a mass of\npowdered stone and fused metal in a fraction of a second. But I am\ncertain that it wouldn't leave as much as a scratch on that monster up\nthere. We might try the Z-Rays on it, but an intelligence that could\ndevise such a craft would undoubtedly have the wisdom to protect it\nagainst such an elementary menace as rays. Even the mightiest explosives\nthat we have wouldn't send a tremor through that mighty mass.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why not await developments?\" asked Dirk. \"We do not even know the\nnature of the thing we are trying to combat.\"\n\n\"It's solid metal,\" insisted Stanton tenaciously. \"It's a metal body\nwith a metal brain.\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" said Steinholt. \"It seems quite apparent that the\ncraft has come from another planet, and, if I am not greatly mistaken,\nthere are intelligent creatures inside it.\"\n\n\"In any event,\" said Dirk, \"it seems impractical to make any plans until\nwe know more about it. I suggest that we empower Fragoni to act for the\nrest of us in this matter.\"\n\n\"That is very agreeable to me,\" said Steinholt. \"A crisis very possibly\nmay arise in which the quick judgment of one man may be necessary to\navert the danger that always is inherent in delay.\"\n\n\"You hold my proxy,\" Lazarre said to Fragoni, \"and I assume that Stanton\nis agreeable to this procedure.\"\n\n\"--the thing is moving very slowly eastward in the direction of Long\nIsland Sound. It is, at the same time, losing altitude. Its movements\nare being carefully watched. As yet we see no cause for immediate\nalarm--people are advised to remain calm--\"\n\n\"Yes, I am agreeable,\" said Stanton nervously and hastily. \"If there are\nthings in it with which we can compromise, I would suggest that we do\nnot offend them.\"\n\n\"I am, then, empowered to act for all of you,\" said Fragoni, ignoring\nthe suggestion of Stanton.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rose from his chair and walked out on the terrace. The others\nfollowed after him.\n\nLooking westward, they saw the mammoth craft descending slowly in their\ndirection.\n\nIts vast dimensions became more and more apparent as, spellbound, they\nwatched it approach closer and closer to them.\n\nThe thing in the sky was now not more than three thousand feet above\nthem and only a few miles to the westward.\n\nThe observers on the terrace regarded it for a moment in silence as it\ndrifted forward and downward.\n\n\"It's colossal!\" Steinholt then exclaimed, lost in scientific admiration\nof the mammoth craft. \"Magnificent! Superb!\"\n\n\"But it's coming right toward us!\" cried Stanton.\n\n\"What makes it move, I wonder?\" asked Dirk. \"And how in the world is it\ncontrolled?\"\n\n\"It surely is not of this world,\" said Fragoni quietly. \"That gigantic\nthing has come to us from somewhere out of the infinite and terrible\ndepths of space.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother minute elapsed while they watched it, speechless with wonder.\n\n\"Do you know,\" Lazarre then said calmly, \"I believe that it is going to\nland in the waters of the Sound. It appears so to me, anyway.\"\n\nIt was nearly opposite them by this time, and not more than a thousand\nfeet above the water. A few planes which, very apparently, were being\nflown by intrepid and fearless flyers, were hovering close around it.\n\nThen finally it came to rest, as Lazarre had predicted, in the water\nsome two miles off shore, and it was obscured by a great cloud of vapor\nfor several minutes.\n\n\"Steam,\" asserted Steinholt. \"That trip around the world, which it made\nin a few minutes, generated considerable frictional heat in the shell.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Fragoni, \"we'll fly out and look the thing over.\"\n\nAround the corner of the building, on the level of the terrace, there\nwas a landing stage which was occupied by a number of planes of various\nsizes.\n\nDirk entered the door of a small twenty passenger speedster, and the\nothers filed in after him.\n\n\"Ready?\" he asked, after he had seated himself at the controls.\n\n\"Ready!\" replied Fragoni.\n\nThe plane rose straight up into the air and then darted gracefully out\nover the Sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk swooped straight down at the leviathan which lay so quietly on the\nsurface of the Sound and then slowly circled around it. No sign of an\naperture of any sort could be seen in the craft. Then he dropped the\nplane lightly on the water, close to the metallic monster, which towered\nfully four hundred feet above them, despite the fact that more than half\nof it was submerged.\n\n\"It must be hollow,\" remarked Steinholt, \"or it wouldn't be so far out\nof the water. In fact, it most certainly would sink, if it was solid.\"\n\nAt the touch of a lever which lay under one of Dirk's hands the plane\nrose straight out of the water, and he maneuvered it directly over the\ntop of the strange enigma. Then he touched a button and the pontoons\nwere drawn up into the undercarriage of the craft.\n\n\"Shall I make a landing on it?\" he asked, turning his head and\naddressing Fragoni.\n\nThe latter nodded his head, and Dirk dropped the ship gently onto the\nsmooth surface of the monster, the pneumatic gearing completely\nabsorbing the shock of the landing.\n\nDirk relinquished the controls and, opening the door of the cabin, he\nstepped out onto the rough and pitted substance of which the leviathan\nwas compounded. He stood there while the others came out after him.\n\nA large area on the top of the monster was perfectly flat and, within a\nvery few moments, Dirk discovered that it was decidedly warm. He had\nbrought the plane down close to the middle of the length of the strange\ncraft in the belief that there, if anywhere, some indication of an\nentrance might be found.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe voice of Steinholt, tense with suppressed excitement, appraised him\nthat his surmise had been correct.\n\n\"There is a manhole of some sort,\" the electrical wizard exclaimed. \"And\nlook, it is turning!\"\n\nThey saw, not far ahead of them, a circular twelve-foot section of the\ndeck slowly revolving, and, even as they watched, it commenced to rise\nslowly upward as the threads with which it was provided turned gradually\naround.\n\nAlmost involuntarily they retreated a few feet and stood there,\nspellbound, as they stared at the massive, revolving section of the\ndeck.\n\nIt continued to turn until fully ten feet of the mobile cylinder had\nbeen exposed. Then the bottom of it appeared. Even then it continued to\nrevolve and rise on a comparatively small shaft which supported it and,\nat the same time, thrust it upward. Dirk and his companions kept their\neyes on the rim of the well which had been exposed, and awaited the\nappearance of something, they knew not what. When the top of the great\ncylinder was fully twelve feet above the deck of the craft it slowly\nceased to revolve.\n\nMoment succeeded moment as the members of the little group rigidly and\nalmost breathlessly awaited developments.\n\nThen Dirk, with an impatient ejaculation, stepped forward toward the\nyawning hole and cautiously peered over the edge of it.\n\nHe stood there for a moment, as if transfixed, and then, with an\nexclamation of horror, retreated swiftly to where his friends were\nstanding.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What is it?\" gasped Steinholt. \"What did you see when--\"\n\nBut the words died on his lips for, swarming swiftly over every side of\nthe well, there poured an array of erect, piercing-eyed beings, who had\nall the characteristics of humans. They were clad in tight-fitting\nattire of thin and pliant metal which, with the exception of their\nfaces, shielded them from head to foot. On their heads they wore\nclose-fitting helmets, apparently equipped with visors which could be\ndrawn down to cover their unprepossessing features.\n\nEach one of them carried a tube which bore a striking resemblance to a\nportable electric flashlight.\n\nSwiftly they advanced, in ranks of eight, toward Dirk and his companions\nwho, gripped with amazement, held their positions.\n\nThe first line came to a halt not more than four feet from the little\ngroup on the deck. The other lines halted, too, and formed a great\nplatoon. Then a shrill whistle sounded and the formation parted in the\nmiddle, leaving an open path that led backward to the entrance, to the\nwell.\n\nA moment later the watchers saw the regal figure of a man emerge from\nthe orifice and, after a moment's pause, advance slowly in their\ndirection with a stately stride.\n\nHe was tall and muscular and blond and his attire, golden in texture,\nglittered with sparkling gems.\n\nAs he approached them he raised his right hand and, inasmuch as his\ncountenance was calm and benign, his gesture appeared to be one of\npeace and good-will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFollowing close behind him there was a younger man who, very apparently,\nwas of the same lineage. His expression, however, was petulant and\nhaughty and it contained more than a suggestion of rapacity and evil.\n\nBehind him there were others of the same fair type, all of them\nsumptuously and ornately attired.\n\nFragoni stepped forward, himself a dignified and striking figure, as the\nleader of the strange adventurers came forth from the lane that had been\nformed by his immobile guard of warriors.\n\nThe two men confronted each other, one whose power and wealth gave him a\ndominate position on earth, and the other a personage from some domain\nthat was remote in the abyss of space.\n\nFragoni bowed and spoke a few friendly words of welcome and the\nstranger, to the utter amazement of the banker and his associates,\nresponded in an English that was rather peculiar in accent but that they\ncould understand without any difficulty.\n\n\"From what part of the world do you come,\" asked the astounded Fragoni,\n\"that you speak our language?\"\n\n\"We come from no part of this world,\" replied the stranger. \"The empire\nof my ruler is infinitely far away. But language, my friend, is not a\nthing of accident. Life grows out of the substance of the universe and\nlanguage comes out of life. The speech of mankind, in your state of\ndevelopment, varies but little throughout all space and I have heard\nyour English, as you call it, spoken among those who dwell in many, many\nworlds.\"\n\n\"And your world?\" asked Steinholt with avid curiosity. \"Tell us of the\nplanet from which you come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Fragoni, smiling at the eagerness of Steinholt, interposed with a\nkindly but arresting gesture.\n\n\"My name is Fragoni,\" he said to the stranger, \"and I would have you\npartake, of my hospitality and refresh yourself after your long journey.\nThese,\" he added, \"are my friends, Steinholt, Vanderpool and Lazarre.\"\n\n\"I am Teuxical, vassal of his Supreme Highness, Malfero of Lodore,\" the\nother replied. \"This is my son, Zitlan,\" he continued, indicating the\nyoung man behind him, \"and the others are my high captains, Anteucan,\nOrzitza and Huazibar. More of my officers are below together with ten\nthousand armed and armored men such as you see before you.\"\n\nIf the last part of the statement was intended as a threat or a warning,\nthe expression on Fragoni's face gave no indication that he was aware of\nit.\n\n\"You carry a large crew, sir,\" Fragoni replied, \"but we gladly will make\nprovisions for all of your men. As for yourself, your son, and your\ncaptains, if you will come with me....\"\n\nHe nodded in the direction of the plane which rested on the great\ninterplanetary vessel and started to walk slowly in the direction of it.\nThe leader of the skymen walked by his side and the other men from\nLodore followed close after them.\n\nDirk, Steinholt and Lazarre brought up the rear, while the soldiers\nremained motionless in their serried array.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInnumerable planes were circling overhead and hundreds of them had\nlanded on the water in the vicinity. Dirk saw that the wanderers from\nthe stars regarded them curiously as if they never before had seen\naircraft of that particular type.\n\nWhen the cabin door of the plane was thrown open, Teuxical turned to one\nof his captains.\n\n\"Remain here, Anteucan, with the soldiers,\" he commanded, \"and await our\nreturn.\"\n\nTeuxical then entered the plane with his men and Fragoni, Steinholt and\nLazarre followed after them. Then Dirk took his seat at the controls.\n\n\"These are strange craft you use,\" he heard Teuxical say. \"I have seen\nthem in only one of the multitude of other worlds on which I have set my\nfeet, worlds which all pay tribute to Malfero of Lodore. It is safer and\nswifter to ride the magnetic currents than it is to ride the unstable\ncurrents of the air.\"\n\nDirk caught the significance of the reference to tribute and he admired\nthe clever diplomacy of Teuxical while, at the same time, he wondered if\nthe earth and all of those who dwelt upon it were doomed to fall under\nthe sway of some remote and unseen despot.\n\nHe also realized that the Lodorians had, in some way, devised a craft\nthat rode the great magnetic streams which flowed through the universe\nin much the same way that men, in ships, navigated the streams of the\nearth.\n\nHe threw on the helicopter switch and the plane rose swiftly into the\nair, the myriad other flying craft which were circling nearby keeping at\na safe distance from it.\n\n\"Land on the grand terrace,\" Fragoni directed. The flight was short and\nrapid and it was only a matter of seconds before Dirk brought the plane\ndown on the landing stage which they had left only a scant half-hour\nbefore.\n\nHe opened the cabin door and stepped out of the plane and the others\nfiled out after him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFragoni led the way along the stage, walking and chatting with Teuxical,\nand Dirk, following after the others, was the last to turn a corner that\nbrought him a sweeping view of the magnificent terrace that fronted the\nprivate apartments of the banker and his daughter.\n\nAnd, when he did, he saw that Inga was standing there, superbly\nbeautiful, with Stanton a few paces behind her.\n\nHer lovely eyes were alive with awe and wonder and her slender white\nhands were crossed over her heart.\n\nAnd Dirk saw, too, that Zitlan, son of Teuxical, had paused and was\nstanding quite still, with his unwavering and insolent eyes fixed on\nthe girl. Resentment, and a touch of apprehension, agitated Dirk when he\nsaw the expression on the face of the young Lodorian.\n\nThere was admiration in that disagreeable countenance, but it was\nblended with arrogance, haughtiness and ill-concealed desire.\n\nDirk went quickly to Inga, standing between the girl and the one from\nLodore who was staring at her so brazenly.\n\n\"What does it all mean, Dirk?\" she asked in a low voice. \"Those strange\npeople, where are they from?\"\n\nStanton had come quickly forward and had joined Inga and Dirk.\n\n\"They are from some far-off world, Inga,\" he explained, \"that we know\nnothing about as yet.\"\n\n\"But what do they want?\" she persisted. \"What do they intend to do? I\nsaw those horrible creatures through the magnascope when they came\nswarming out of the inside of that thing on the water and I thought, at\nfirst, that they were going to kill you all.\"\n\n\"No, they seem to come in peace,\" Dirk replied. \"Teuxical, their leader,\nseems to be gracious and kindly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We are all doomed,\" asserted Stanton, \"unless something happens. They\ncan crumble our cities with heat and bury us under the ruins of them.\"\n\n\"Keep your silence!\" breathed Dirk, quietly but tensely. \"We will find a\nway to destroy those creatures if it becomes necessary.\"\n\n\"That man who keeps staring at me, who is he?\" asked Inga in a voice\nthat betrayed her nervousness.\n\nDirk turned and saw that Zitlan was still standing where he had paused\nand that he still was looking with searching eyes in the direction of\nthe girl.\n\nHe returned the insolent gaze of the young Lodorian with an impatient\nand threatening stare and the countenance of Zitlan at once became\nstern and menacing. He came striding in the direction of Inga, Dirk and\nStanton and paused within a few feet of them, his rapacious eyes still\nfixed on the girl.\n\n\"My lady,\" he said, \"your beauty pleases me. I have walked on many\nworlds but never before have I seen one as lovely as yourself. Of the\nspoils of this world, all that I crave possession of is you. When we\nreturn to Lodore,\" he added with an air of finality, \"I will take you\nwith me and place you with my other women in the Seraglio of the\nStars.\"\n\nDirk swiftly stepped close to Zitlan and the latter quickly clasped a\ntube that hung at his side, a tube of the sort that the soldiers had\ncarried.\n\n\"Your words and your manner are insolent,\" asserted Dirk angrily, \"and I\nwarn you now to cease making yourself offensive.\"\n\n\"Dog!\" exclaimed Zitlan fiercely, leveling the metal tube, \"I'll--\"\n\nBut the left fist of Dirk cut short his threat as it made a sudden\nimpact with his chin, and the Lodorian went crashing backward into some\nexotic shrubbery with a look of surprise on his countenance.\n\nThen Dirk heard an odd hissing and crackling sound, and he felt himself\nbecoming dizzy and weak.\n\nDarkness seemed to sweep in upon him; he felt that he was dropping\nswiftly through space, and then he lost consciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA vague and shadowy figure was standing close by his side and peering\ndown into his face. After a while he realized that it was Steinholt.\n\n\"Steinholt!\" he gasped. \"Why--why am I here--in Fragoni's? I must have\nhad a dream--and yet....\"\n\nHe furrowed his brow in thought and, gradually, he commenced to remember\nwhat had happened.\n\n\"It was no dream,\" said the scientist softly. \"Do you remember the\ntrouble that you had with Zitlan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Dirk. \"I remember that he was insolent to Inga and that I\nlost my temper and struck him. But what happened to me? I don't recall\nthat anybody hit me. I did hear sort of a peculiar sound just before I\nstarted to pass out, but--\"\n\n\"Teuxical took a shot at you,\" said Steinholt, \"and you have been\nunconscious for over thirty-six hours.\"\n\n\"Took a shot at me!\" exclaimed Dirk. \"What did he shoot me with?\"\n\n\"That is what we all would like to know,\" said Steinholt. \"He leveled\none of those damn tubes at you and pressed a button on it. There was a\nhissing sound, a flash of light, and you got groggy, and went out. He\npotted Zitlan, too,\" continued Steinholt, \"and he apologized for the\ntrouble that his son was responsible for. Do you know,\" he added, \"I\nsort of like the old man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLazarre, with a sympathetic smile on his face, entered the room at that\nmoment and overheard the conversation.\n\n\"Old man is right,\" he remarked, with a little note of awe in his voice.\n\"Teuxical admits that he is three thousand years old and that he has at\nleast two thousand more ahead of him. That Lodore must be a queer\nworld,\" he commented, shaking his grizzly head.\n\n\"It is not so queer when you take everything into consideration,\" said\nSteinholt. \"It seems quite natural when Teuxical explains it. Lodore it\nseems, is something like a hundred thousand times as big as this\nminiature world we live on. It took Lodore infinitely longer to solidify\nfrom a gaseous state than it took this world, and its entire evolution\nhas been relatively slower than ours. Therefore, according to Teuxical,\nthe people up there live longer and, incidentally, know infinitely more\nthan we do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What time is it now?\" asked Dirk, after a moment of thought.\n\n\"It is just about twelve o'clock at night,\" Steinholt informed him.\n\n\"Have these Lodorians made any demands yet?\" Dirk asked. \"Does anybody\nknow what they are going to do or what they want?\"\n\n\"They are liable to do almost anything,\" said Lazarre, \"and it looks as\nthough they will be able to get anything that they want. Teuxical, as I\nunderstand it, just gave you a slight shock with his death-ray device.\nIf he had pulled the trigger all the way you would have become just a\nlittle pile of dust that the first breeze would have blown away.\"\n\n\"Our own death-rays are somewhat similar,\" said Steinholt, \"but they are\nnot a hundredth as powerful. And they won't work on the Lodorians,\neither,\" he added, \"because those metal sheaths that they wear make them\nimmune to all kinds of destructive rays.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It appears,\" remarked Lazarre morosely, \"as if this little world of\nours is going to be taken for a ride. And it's too bad, considering that\nit's the only world we've got. There has been no formal presentation of\ndemands yet, but it seems to be sort of understood that the earth is\ngoing to become a tributary of Lodore. It is a good thing,\" he added,\n\"that Teuxical, and not Zitlan, is the boss of that outfit. I don't like\nthe looks of that young fellow. He's only twelve hundred years old and\nhe is sort of hot-blooded, I guess.\"\n\n\"I was talking with Anteucan,\" said Steinholt, \"and he told me that the\nLodorians usually make heavy levies on worlds which they discover and\ndominate. As soon as Teuxical returns to Lodore and announces a new\ndiscovery a fleet of those damned monsters is sent out to mop up the new\nplanet. That Malfero, who is the emperor of Lodore, is considerable of a\nmonarch, and it seems that he has a passion for piling up wealth. Gold\nand platinum are as precious on Lodore as they are here and he also\nlikes pretty stones.\"\n\n\"And what is worse,\" added Steinholt, \"is his practice of enslaving\nentire populations and making toilers or warriors out of them. Those\nsoldiers on the ship are not Lodorians. Millions of them were seized on\nsome planet and converted into troops. It was a strange conversion,\ntoo,\" said Steinholt with a shudder. \"Their brains were operated on and\nmost of their faculties removed. They have no sense of fear, no\nconsciences, no power of reasoning. They respond only to certain signals\non a whistle and their only definite and active impulse is that of\nmurder and destruction.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to do,\" said Dirk positively, \"but to kill all of\nthese interlopers, if we hope to save our world from being desolated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three men looked at each other in silence for a moment and then\nDirk, somewhat weakly, rose into a sitting position in the bed which he\nhad been occupying.\n\n\"But how,\" asked Steinholt, \"can we kill them? We might, of course, get\nrid of a few of them, but that simply would lead to our destruction by\nthose who were left.\"\n\n\"There must be some way,\" asserted Dirk, \"and it is up to us to think of\nit without delay. If we let those Lodorians get a foothold on the world\nall will be lost.\"\n\n\"The old man seems to be reasonable enough,\" said Lazarre. \"He doesn't\nseem inclined to be destructive.\"\n\n\"We must not trust him or any of the others,\" said Dirk imperatively.\n\"We must rid the earth of every one of them. And the sooner we strike\nthe better!\"\n\n\"It had best be soon if it is to be at all,\" said Steinholt. \"Fragoni\nhas arranged to have Teuxical appear before the Congress, and the\nmeeting has been called for to-night when, I imagine, certain specific\ndemands will be made upon us. We all will go to The Hague together on\nthe ship of the Lodorians.\"\n\n\"And we leave?\" questioned Dirk.\n\n\"The meeting is set for ten P. M., New York time,\" said Lazarre. \"We\nwill start east at about four o'clock in the morning, I guess, because\nit will only take a minute or so to arrive at our destination.\"\n\n\"Is Fragoni going?\" asked Dirk.\n\n\"Naturally,\" replied Lazarre.\n\n\"And Inga?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Lazarre told him. \"Fragoni was both afraid to take her\nand to leave her behind, but finally he decided that he wanted her with\nhim in case of trouble.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And are they--the Lodorians--still here?\" queried Dirk.\n\n\"Yes,\" responded Lazarre. \"Teuxical returned to his ship last night with\nZitlan and his other followers, but they came back late this afternoon,\nand they are still here. Zitlan seemed to be all right this afternoon,\ntoo. They must have used some means of bringing him out of the daze that\nhe was in. We did everything we could to revive you, but none of our\nmeasures were effective.\"\n\n\"I'm all right now,\" asserted Dirk, as he finished attiring himself. \"I\nwant to see Fragoni at once.\"\n\n\"We'll go out on the terrace then,\" said Steinholt. \"They are all out\nthere.\"\n\nDirk, with his two companions, strolled out through the maze of rooms\nand corridors that led to the garden which hung so high above the city\nand the Sound below it.\n\nThe first thing that Dirk saw, when he passed out onto the terrace, was\nthe white tunic of Inga, who was leaning against a coping and talking\nwith Zitlan.\n\nThe latter was pointing skyward and, very apparently, he was telling her\nof worlds which circled high among the stars.\n\nAs if she were suddenly aware of his presence, Inga turned and saw Dirk\nand he realized, by the expression on her face, that she was distraught\nand nervous. She came toward him quickly, after a few words to Zitlan,\nand the face of the latter darkened. There was hatred in his expression\nas he stared malevolently at Dirk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteinholt and Lazarre passed along and joined Fragoni and Teuxical, who\nwere the center of a group that had formed in another part of the\nterrace.\n\n\"Oh, Dirk,\" said Inga, \"I am so afraid of that frightful Zitlan. He has\nbeen telling me again that he is going to take me back to his own world\nwith him and it makes me shudder to think of it. He is so strange and\nqueer and his eyes are so terrible. He can't be as young as he looks,\nbecause he speaks of years like we speak of minutes. I will die if I\never find myself in that monster's power! He has been telling me of all\nthe creatures he has slain on the worlds on which he has landed, and I\ntell you, Dirk, that he is cruel and ruthless and horrible.\"\n\n\"He will never have you!\" swore Dirk. \"And if I hear of any more of his\ninsolence, I will throw him headlong from this terrace.\"\n\n\"Please, Dirk,\" she begged, \"don't do anything--not yet. He is utterly\nunscrupulous, Dirk. He told me that, even now, he is plotting against\nsome Malfero who rules Lodore like a god, and that he is planning to\nseize the throne of the planet. He wants to make me the queen of that\nfearful world when he becomes king. He boasted that, if I were on the\nthrone, millions of people from other worlds would be sacrificed in my\nhonor in the temples of Lodore.\" Her voice trembled and her eyes were\nterror-stricken as she continued. \"They tear out the hearts of living\nvictims,\" she whispered, \"and burn them on their high and mammoth\npyramids.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRage took possession of Dirk and, casting a glance at Zitlan, he saw\nthat the Lodorian was smiling insolently at him.\n\n\"I'll kill that beast, if it's the last thing that I do!\" he exclaimed\nto Inga.\n\n\"Dirk, Dirk,\" she implored, \"don't even look at him. He is proud and\nimpetuous, and he will kill you in defiance of his own father.\"\n\n\"We will find some way to rid the world of the scourge that has\ndescended upon it,\" asserted Dirk confidently, \"and he will die with the\nrest of that monstrous crew.\"\n\n\"I am going in, Dirk,\" Inga said. \"Please,\" she begged, \"don't do\nanything rash. If--something--should happen to you, I would lose all the\nhope that I have and I would, I think, kill myself.\"\n\n\"Don't lose hope, my dear,\" said Dirk reassuringly. \"I believe that I\nknow of a way to destroy the plague that menaces us.\"\n\nHe pressed her hand and, after she left him, he walked over and joined\nthe other men on the terrace. Zitlan, coming from the terrace wall,\nstretched out in a chair not far from Dirk.\n\nTeuxical regarded the latter with a countenance that was calm and\namicable. \"I am sorry, my young friend,\" he apologized, \"that I had to\nintervene between you and my son.\" He paused a moment and sat in\nsilence, a thoughtful expression on his face. \"Ah,\" he then said, \"what\ndisasters have arisen out of the desire of men for women. In my\nwanderings over the starlit worlds, I have seen....\" He ceased speaking,\nbrooded for a moment, and then shook his head slowly. \"But you cannot\nsay that I was not just,\" he continued, addressing Dirk. \"I punished\nZitlan for his presumption. Fragoni tells me that the woman has pledged\nherself to you. Let her pledge be kept!\" he exclaimed sternly, looking\nstraight at Zitlan.\n\n\"We are the conquerors,\" asserted the latter boldly, \"and to us should\nbelong the spoils of our daring!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" thundered Teuxical. \"My own son, above all others, shall be\nobedient to my commands! Or, like others have done, he shall die because\nof insubordination!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZitlan, a defiant expression on his face, ceased to speak, but Dirk\ncould see that he was livid with suppressed rage.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" Teuxical remarked, turning to Fragoni, \"I am getting\nold and long have I been weary of conquest. I have seen your world and\nit pleases me. It is a tiny and peaceful place, far removed from the\nstrife and turbulence of the restless centers of the universe. So it is\nmy will to leave you unscathed and return to Lodore for a brief time to\nask of the mighty Malfero the grant of this little provincial land. And\nthen, with his permission, I will return here and rule it with wisdom\nand benevolence.\n\n\"I will bring to you much knowledge, and peace will be to the people of\nthis earth and peace will be to me.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" replied Fragoni. \"No world, I am certain, could hope for a\nwiser and more just ruler than yourself, and our Congress surely will\nreceive you with acclaim.\"\n\nTeuxical bowed in recognition of the compliment, and his countenance\nindicated that he was gratified.\n\n\"We will go, now, back to our vessel,\" he said, addressing the other\nLodorians. \"We will return for you at the appointed hour and conduct you\nto our ship,\" he added, speaking to Fragoni.\n\n\"We will be ready,\" Fragoni replied.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZitlan had arisen with the rest of them and Dirk, with a look of\ncontempt and amusement in his eyes, regarded him casually.\n\n\"May I have the honor of conducting our guests back to their ship in a\nplane?\" Stanton requested of Fragoni.\n\nThe latter nodded and Stanton walked across the terrace in the direction\nof the landing stage.\n\nZitlan, as he followed after the others, passed close to Dirk and,\npausing for a moment, fixed his hateful eyes on him.\n\n\"You dog,\" he whispered malignantly, \"remember what I tell you! The\ntime will come when I will cast you to the carnaphlocti in the dark and\nicy caverns of sunless Tiganda. You will die,\" he swore, \"the death of a\nmillion agonies!\"\n\nFor a moment Dirk felt an almost irresistible impulse to hurl himself on\nthe Lodorian and slay him.\n\nHe managed to maintain his control, however, and only regarded Zitlan\nwith disdain as the latter turned and went on his way.\n\nIn another moment the plane, containing Stanton and the Lodorians, was\nhigh up in the darkness.\n\nDirk glanced at the great clock that gleamed atop of the beacon-tower on\nthe Metropole Landing Field.\n\nThe hour was close to twelve-thirty A. M.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA moment of silence on the terrace followed the departure of the plane\nthat bore the Lodorians back to their craft.\n\nFor an hour the clouds had been gathering in the sky and now a fine,\ncold rain commenced to fall.\n\nA peal of thunder echoed above them after a sharp flash of lightning had\nstreaked across the black night above them.\n\nA servant appeared from the entrance to the apartment and pressed a\nbutton close to the door.\n\nProtective plates of glass noiselessly enveloped the terrace, sheltering\nthose upon it from the inclement weather.\n\n\"It is well,\" remarked Fragoni, breaking the silence, \"that we were\nfound by a leader like Teuxical. Our tribute will not be unbearable, and\nhe will bestow many benefits upon us.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" protested Dirk, \"you do not intend to surrender without a\nstruggle! Nothing but disaster,\" he asserted earnestly, \"will come upon\nthe earth if you do. Teuxical may be honest and just but, after all, he\nneither is immortal nor all-powerful, and something may happen to him at\nany moment. And there are those like Zitlan who would turn the world\nover to ravage and rape, and then convert it into a blazing pyre, if\nthey had their way. These vandals,\" he insisted, \"must be slain one and\nall, or, mark my words, our world will be laid waste.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk spoke with such a sense of conviction that his words held his\nlisteners spellbound.\n\n\"Who is Teuxical,\" he asked, \"but the vassal of a monarch whose\ncorsairs, very apparently, are carrying on a war of conquest in the\nuniverse? It will be disastrous, I say, to place any dependence in the\ngood will of this one Lodorian. If he, or any of his men, return to that\nfar-off planet where they dwell word will be carried there of the\nexistence of our world. But who can say that Teuxical ever will return\nhere again? It may be the whim of his ruler to refuse his request, or\nany one of a thousand other events might arise to thwart his desire to\nlive among us. No,\" concluded Dirk passionately, \"it never will do to\nlet that great engine of destruction rise into the skies again!\"\n\n\"He is right!\" asserted Steinholt positively. \"It will be far better to\nannihilate these raiders, if such a thing can be accomplished!\"\n\nLazarre was rather inclined to take sides with Fragoni.\n\n\"But how,\" he demanded, \"can such destruction be brought about? We know\nnothing of the capabilities of that monster that is lying down there in\nthe Sound. It is undoubtedly equipped with the deadliest of devices and\nthey all will be turned upon us if we fail in an effort to destroy the\nthing and those who have come from space upon it. If there was a way to\nsmite them suddenly, to bring death to the Lodorians and to those\nswarming, mindless, murderous minions who act in obedience to them, I\nwould favor doing it.\n\n\"But, as it is,\" he concluded, \"it seems like inviting disaster even to\nthink of such an attempt, much less to try it.\"\n\n\"It can be done, though,\" asserted Dirk, \"or there is at least a\nfighting chance of accomplishing it. The electrosceotan--\" He paused,\nand looked questioningly at Steinholt. \"The top of that monster is open\nand....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Teuton furrowed his brow and considered the proposition for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding his head, \"it might be done.\" Again he silently\ngave the subject his thought. \"It is well worth trying,\" he asserted\nwith an air of decision. \"But we will have to make haste,\" he warned,\n\"if the thing is to be done before the flight to The Hague.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Fragoni. \"We will apply ourselves to the task at hand.\nI, too,\" he confessed, \"had rather see these vandals destroyed like so\nmuch vermin rather than have them carry the news of the existence of\nthis earth back into those strange worlds in the depth of space. I will\nonly regret the passing of Teuxical, who could have taught us much\nwisdom. And now,\" he continued briskly, \"I will place myself under your\norders, Dirk. You are the one who suggested this plan and upon you will\nfall the responsibility of executing it. And, if it succeeds,\" he added,\n\"the glory will be yours.\"\n\n\"I care little for the glory,\" replied Dirk, \"but I gladly accept the\nduties and the responsibilities. These,\" he said to Fragoni, \"are my\ninstructions to you. Inasmuch as Teuxical and his captains will return\nhere at about four o'clock in the morning to convey us back to their\ncraft, it will be necessary to have this building emptied of its\ninhabitants by that time. Let all of those who dwell here depart from\nit, a few at a time, so as not to excite suspicion. Inga, above all\nothers, must leave and retreat to a place of safety. Then, as the hour\napproaches for the arrival of the Lodorians, we will escape by plane\nfrom one of the rear terraces. They will land in search of us\nand--well, then they will feel the force of our power.\"\n\n\"I will follow your orders explicitly,\" promised Fragoni. \"I wonder,\" he\nadded, \"where Stanton is? He should be advised of what we are going to\nattempt.\"\n\n\"He will return in due time,\" replied Dirk. \"And, if not, it will be the\nworse for him. Lazarre will remain here with you,\" he then told Fragoni,\n\"and Steinholt and I will now go about our part of the task at hand.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk, followed by Steinholt, hurried across the terrace and, leaving the\nshelter of its quartzite plates, sought the landing stage.\n\nThe rain still was falling and the heavens were congested with dark and\nheavy clouds.\n\nDirk, selecting one of the smaller planes, entered the cabin and\nSteinholt, following after him, closed the door and threw on the\nlights.\n\nSwiftly they shot straight up into the air, Dirk ignoring all of the\nrules of flight in his haste to be under way. Once in the westbound\nlane, he headed his plane toward Manhattan and threw his rheostat wide\nopen. In a few minutes they were skimming over the great city and past\nthe three-thousand-foot steel tower of the Worldwide Broadcasting\nStation.\n\nFor fifteen minutes more he kept the plane on a straight course and\nthen, bringing it to a quick stop, he let it drop like a plummet toward\nthe earth.\n\nIt landed, among many other planes, on the transparent, quartzite roof\nof a vast building and, looking down into the interior, they could see\nseveral rows of great dynamos. Some of them were turning, and the\nhumming that they made could be heard plainly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk and Steinholt ran rapidly across the roof until they came to a\nsuperstructure, which they entered. There was a shaft inside. Dirk\npressed a button, and an elevator shot up and stopped at the door,\nwhich automatically flashed open.\n\nHe closed it after he and his companion had entered the cage and,\ndropping rapidly downward, they came to a stop in a lighted chamber that\nwas far below the surface of the ground.\n\nA stoop-shouldered old man greeted them, an expression of surprise on\nhis face.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" he exclaimed. \"What is--\"\n\n\"Power, Gaeble!\" commanded Steinholt tensely. \"Power! Let every dynamo\nrun its swiftest. To-night we have to use for the electrosceotan!\"\n\n\"But I thought it was peace that those from the stars desired,\" said the\nold electrician. \"Through my radiovisor I heard--\"\n\n\"That was sent out,\" explained Steinholt, \"to relieve the fears of the\npeople and to keep them in order.\"\n\nSwiftly the distorted figure of the old man sped to a great switchboard,\nwhere he pressed button after button.\n\nThe very ground commenced to vibrate around them and the massive\nstructure seemed to be alive with straining power.\n\nThen Steinholt, going to a corner of the intricate board, adjusted a few\nlevers, while his gnomelike companion watched him carefully.\n\n\"And now, Gaeble,\" the scientist said impressively, \"these are your\norders. At precisely the hour of four o'clock in the morning make one\nconnection with this switch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe indicated, with a stubby finger, the lever to be operated.\n\n\"Keep the circuit closed for just four seconds,\" he added slowly, \"and\nthen break it. Do you understand, Gaeble?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I do,\" replied the old man.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Steinholt, \"after you break that connection you\nquickly will close this next circuit. Keep it closed for four seconds\nand then, after opening it for one second, close it again for four\nseconds. Repeat the procedure twice more, Gaeble, after that, and then\nawait my further instructions. Is everything clear?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is, sir,\" the old man replied. \"I will follow your orders\nimplicitly.\"\n\n\"There is one thing more,\" Steinholt said. \"Get the Worldwide Tower on\nthe televisor and warn them of what is to happen.\"\n\n\"I will do that immediately,\" Gaeble replied.\n\nDirk and Steinholt shot up to the roof again and the building over which\nthey walked seemed to be quivering with life.\n\nThey could see that all of the mammoth dynamos beneath them were\nrevolving and the humming which they had heard before had changed into\nan ugly, vibrant roar.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain they took flight and, reaching Manhattan, they continued north and\neast to the shore of Long Island Sound.\n\nLong before the old East River had been filled in and the space which it\nhad occupied reclaimed for building purposes. All indications of its\nformer bed had been obliterated by mammoth terraced structures.\n\nWhen they reached their destination on the shore of the Sound a small\nsubmarine, which Dirk had ordered by radio, was awaiting them.\n\n\"Submerge and proceed up the Sound,\" Dirk ordered the officer, \"and take\nus directly under the craft of the Lodorians.\"\n\nIn a few minutes they were skimming over the surface of the water and,\nwhen a sufficient depth had been gained, the tiny boat disappeared\nbeneath the rain-rippled sea.\n\nDirk sat at a port and watched the aquatic life as it was illuminated by\nthe powerful aquamarine searchlights.\n\nProgress under the water was comparatively slow, as mankind had made but\nlittle progress in underwater navigation. Air liners long before had\nalmost superseded travel by land and sea and the abolition of warfare\nhad swept all of the old navies from the ocean.\n\nIt was more than an hour before the officer in charge of the boat\nannounced that the mammoth hull of the monster that was lying on the\nSound was visible directly above them.\n\nBoth Dirk and Steinholt donned diving apparatus, and the former\ncarefully adjusted the mechanism that was contained in a metallic box\nabout two feet square.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen they stepped up into a chamber in the conning tower of the boat\nand, after a door slipped shut beneath them, water slowly commenced to\npour into the compartment.\n\nWhen it was full a sliding door that was in front of them slowly opened\nand they passed out onto the deck of the underwater craft.\n\nSteinholt had been provided with some welding apparatus and, in a few\nminutes, the box which Dirk had carried was attached securely to the\nbottom of the craft of the Lodorians.\n\nThey then reentered the submarine by reversing the process which had\nattended their exit. Very soon they were in the cabin of the boat\nagain.\n\n\"If everything goes well,\" said Dirk, \"those damned Lodorians will never\nknow what struck them.\"\n\n\"I only hope,\" said Steinholt, \"that we don't destroy that leviathan\naltogether. We might solve the secret of it and then we, too, could ride\nout into the heart of the universe.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to imagine what will happen,\" Dirk replied, \"until\nafter we launch our attack.\"\n\nBoth of the men were silent during the return trip of the small undersea\ncraft, which emerged at its dock a little before three-thirty in the\nmorning.\n\n\"We'll have to hurry,\" urged Dirk nervously, \"because we will need a\nlittle time to make preparations after we get back to Fragoni's.\"\n\nThey entered their plane and Dirk shot it swiftly up into the night,\nfollowing the red shaft of light that rose almost directly from the\npoint at which they had made their landing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, having reached the eastbound level, he headed straight in the\ndirection of the palace of Fragoni.\n\nDirk cast a glance at the great city that lay far beneath him. High up\ninto the heavens it tossed the fulgurant fires that betokened its wealth\nand power. And, down among those myriad lights, millions and millions of\npeople were restless under the danger that menaced them. It was only a\nmatter of moments now before their fate, and the fate of their great\nmetropolis, would be decided. By dawn they would be free forever from\nthe threat of subjugation and slavery or else they, and all that they\nhad toiled and striven for, would be the veriest dust of dying embers.\n\nAnd whatever befell them likewise would befall the rest of the world and\nevery living thing that moved upon it.\n\nDirk was high above Fragoni's when he stopped the forward flight of the\nplane and, dropping it rapidly through the misty night, brought up\neasily on the landing stage. The other planes which had been there when\nhe and Steinholt had taken their departure were gone and Dirk felt a\nsense of relief when he observed this. Inga, then, must have departed\nwith the other occupants of the colossal structure. Things were going\naccording to the plan that he had conceived. He stepped out of the\ncabin, followed by Steinholt, and proceeded hastily along the terrace\nand turned the corner into the garden.\n\nThen he came to an abrupt halt because there, before him, was Zitlan,\nwith one of the deadly ray-tubes of the Lodorians in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk knew immediately that something unexpected had happened and that he\nwas in the power of one who not only hated him but who had an unholy\ndesire for Inga.\n\nHe realized, too, that any show of resistance would be nothing short of\nsuicide, for he was well aware of the deadliness of the strange weapon\nwith which he and Steinholt were being menaced by the gloating\nLodorian.\n\n\"One false move and you die!\" warned Zitlan. \"Come forward, now, and\njoin those two others over whom Anteucan and Huazibar are watching.\"\n\nDirk and Steinholt promptly obeyed the command of Zitlan and walked over\nto where Fragoni and Lazarre were being guarded by two of the\nconquerors.\n\nThe rain had ceased to fall, but the skies were dark and overcast with\nheavy clouds. There was an occasional flash of lightning, and thunder\nrolled and echoed through the night.\n\nThe terrace, however, was brightly illuminated and every detail of the\nscene around him was visible to Dirk.\n\nHe saw Stanton, on another part of the terrace, standing among some\nLodorians he had not seen before. Stanton, apparently, was not being\ntreated as a prisoner and Dirk wondered, rather vaguely, why this was.\n\n\"What happened?\" Dirk asked Fragoni quietly.\n\n\"According to what I have heard,\" the latter replied, \"Zitlan murdered\nhis father in a fit of rage, and has taken over the command of the ship.\nMany of the Lodorians are his adherents and even those who do not favor\nhim are so terrified that they will be obedient to his wishes.\"\n\n\"And Inga?\" questioned Dirk.\n\n\"She is inside the apartment,\" said Fragoni, a note of desperation in\nhis voice. \"Zitlan surprised us completely and he and his men had us\ncovered before we realized that Teuxical was not among them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZitlan, in the meantime, had entered the suite of Fragoni and he now\ncame out, Inga walking before him.\n\nShe was silent and proudly erect but there was a pallor in her face that\nindicated her realization of the danger that she was threatened with.\n\nWhen Dirk saw her she gave him a brave smile, which he answered with a\nglance of reassurance.\n\nHe could see the great clock in the Metropole Tower, and he noticed,\nwith a feeling of grave apprehension, that it was twenty minutes to four\no'clock.\n\nThere were only a few minutes more in which to make a desperate and\napparently a hopeless effort to save Inga, his friends and himself from\na catastrophe which he had been instrumental in contriving.\n\nThen Zitlan stood before him, haughty and arrogant, his lowering\ncountenance ugly with hatred.\n\n\"So, dog,\" he said, \"you who dared to defy Zitlan now stand before him a\ncaptive!\"\n\nNeither Dirk nor any one of the three others who were guarded with him\nreplied to the utterance.\n\n\"You and that woman of yours,\" continued the Lodorian insolently, \"both\nare my prisoners to do with as I please. Your fate,\" he continued, \"I\nalready have planned for you and I assure you that it will not be as\npleasurable as the one to which she is destined. You will find that\nTigana, on which you and those with you will be cast, is a world of\nterror such as you never could dream of. Even the monsters which crawl\nthrough the deliriums of the mind are not as horrible as those which\ninfest the mad and haunted world of which I speak.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe paused a moment, a cruel smile on his face, as if he wished the full\nimport of his words to sear themselves into the minds of the doomed\nmen.\n\n\"But the woman,\" he added, \"will return to Lodore with me and be the\nqueen of all women. And soon,\" he said savagely, \"she may be queen of\nall Lodore, of the worlds which pay tribute to Lodore, and of other\nworlds which I will conquer and ravage. My father stood in my way and he\ndied at my own hands. So will others perish who thwart my ambition, and\nI will become supreme in the universe!\"\n\nA feeling of reckless fury possessed Dirk as he listened to the words of\nZitlan and he felt an almost irresistible desire to drive a fist square\nbetween the mad, glittering eyes of the Lodorian.\n\nHe glanced at the great clock, however, and he saw that the time to act\nhad not yet come. At the last moment he would make one desperate attempt\nto frustrate the evil designs of Zitlan. If it failed--well, all would\nbe lost. But it was a far better thing to die resisting the despicable\nZitlan and his minions than it would be to live and to know that,\nwithout a struggle, he had abandoned to degradation the girl he loved.\n\n\"This world of yours will be my world,\" he heard Zitlan boast, \"and the\nspoils from it will add to my riches. This one here,\" he continued,\nindicating Stanton, \"has offered to show me where all of the treasures\nof the earth may be found. And, as a reward, he will return to Lodore\nwith me and there be elevated to a high position.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat, then, was why Stanton was not under guard like the rest of them.\n\n\"Our good friend, Stanton,\" said Lazarre, \"seems to have become\nsomething of a Judas.\"\n\n\"And let his name be forever cursed, like the name of Judas,\" said\nDirk.\n\n\"Silence!\" thundered the Lodorian. \"I, Zitlan, am speaking.\" He paused a\nmoment. \"When I garner up the treasures of this world in the way of\nprecious stones and metals I also shall gather more priceless loot in\nthe way of women. And then, having taken all that I desire, I will lay\nwaste to this earth so that those who survive will fear the name of\nZitlan and will grovel before him like a god when once again he appears\nto them.\"\n\nWhile Zitlan had been speaking, Dirk had been studying the opponents\nwith whom he soon had to clash.\n\nThe two Lodorians who were standing guard over himself and his\ncompanions were close to his left side. Zitlan was directly in front of\nhim, and there were seven of his minions clustered behind him.\n\nAgain Dirk glanced at the great dial of the clock, and he saw that it\nwas seven minutes of four.\n\nThe moment had come to act if action was to prove of any avail.\n\n\"I will--\"\n\nBut the words of Zitlan were interrupted by Dirk, who suddenly made a\nmighty sweep with his left arm and knocked the deadly tubes from the\nhands of Anteucan and Huazibar. Startled by the assault, they went\nreeling backward. At almost the same instant Dirk leaped forward and,\nseizing Zitlan, hurled him among those Lodorians who had been massed\nbehind him. Then he threw himself violently into the tangled mass, his\nfists driving in and out with deadly strength!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the corner of one eye he saw Inga pass the melee and dart swiftly\nto the corner of the terrace. Instead of passing around to the landing\nstage, however, she lingered there and watched the combat.\n\nDirk, as he fought, became conscious that Steinholt and Fragoni were at\nhis side, battling with him against his enemies. He saw, too, that\nStanton had retired to the far end of the terrace and that he was\nwatching the struggle with frightened eyes.\n\n\"We must reach the plane and get away,\" gasped Dirk. \"In another three\nminutes--\"\n\nHe felled a Lodorian who, having lost his tube, was about to grapple\nwith him. He saw Steinholt send another one of their opponents reeling\nbackward.\n\n\"Fragoni!\" he exclaimed. \"The plane! Get in with Inga! We will come!\"\n\nEven as he spoke his fists were flailing back and forth between each one\nof his staccato commands.\n\nHe saw beneath him a hand reaching toward a tube, and he kicked the\ninstrument of death. It hurtled over in the direction of Stanton and\nlanded close to his feet. Stanton might have picked it up and been in\npossession of the means of aiding his old friends or his new allies. But\nhe shrunk away, panic-stricken, from the thing that lay so close to his\nreach.\n\nA Lodorian leaped upon Dirk's back in an effort to bring him to the\nground, but he stooped swiftly forward and his assailant was catapulted\nover his head into those who were in front of him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe caught a flash of the contorted face of Zitlan flying through the\nair, and saw him land with a crash on the terrace, and lie there\nwrithing in pain.\n\n\"Steinholt, Lazarre!\" he said convulsively. \"We've got to strike once\nmore! And then--run!\"\n\nHe plunged into their enemies with every bit of energy that he had left,\nand saw two of them toppling down. Then, like a flash, he turned to\nLazarre, who was trying to fight off three of the Lodorians. Seizing one\nof them by the waist, Dirk hurled him backward and he disposed of\nanother one in the same manner. His sheer desperation seemed to have\ngiven him unbounded strength and power.\n\nLazarre sent his third opponent down with a blow under the chin and\nthen, with Dirk at his side, they turned to the assistance of\nSteinholt.\n\nWith one mad rush they crashed into a group of Lodorians and sent them\nreeling away like so many nine-pins.\n\n\"Now! To the plane!\" exclaimed Dirk, taking to his heels across the\nterrace. Steinholt and Lazarre followed after him and, turning the\ncorner, they saw that the ship was in place and that Fragoni was\nanxiously waiting by the door of the cabin. Inga, Dirk knew, already was\ninside and safe. He stood aside while Steinholt and Lazarre leaped in.\nDuring the momentary wait he caught a glimpse of the great clock. It\nwas one minute to four. Dirk jumping into the plane and switched on the\nhelicopter without even waiting to close the cabin door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship shot skyward like a rocket. When it reached an altitude of\nthirty-five hundred feet, he turned it north and raced at top speed in\nthat direction.\n\nIt was miles away from the palace of Fragoni in less than thirty\nseconds. Dirk then stopped the plane and held it poised in the air with\nthe helicopter.\n\nThe skies were turgid and black and the massed clouds, reflecting the\nlights of the great city below them, were permeated with an ugly,\nfeverish, red glow.\n\nFrom where they were hanging in midair, the occupants of the plane could\nplainly see the sparkling palace of Fragoni towering high up into the\ndarkness of the night.\n\nThe lights of the magnificent mansion were reflected far out into the\nSound where, looming in the golden ripples, lay the sinister monster\nfrom the terrible depths of unfathomable space.\n\nDirk took a watch from his pocket and, after glancing at it, he hastily\nreplaced it.\n\n\"Two seconds more,\" he said, \"and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sharp and dazzling bolt of greenish fire came hurling suddenly out of\nthe west and, with a thunderous concussion, seemed to fasten itself on\nthe crest of Fragoni's palace.\n\nIt trembled and quivered, as if endowed with some uncanny life and\npower, as it remained there against the darkness, throwing a weird,\ngreen tinge over the water and up into the skies.\n\nBlue waves of light could be seen pulsing and racing along the terrible\nbeam and there, where it had fastened itself, they seemed to disappear\nin the vast and crumbling structure.\n\nFor four seconds that destructive streak of light, one end of which was\nlost back in the mists that concealed Manhattan, tore at the proud\npile.\n\nAnd, as the stone crumbled and the steelite fused under the mighty\nassault, an ominous roar swept through the night. The air was so\nviolently agitated that the plane, miles away, tossed up and down like a\ntiny boat on a stormy sea.\n\nThen suddenly the bolt was gone, but its livid image still burned in the\neyes of those who had been watching it.\n\nOnce more, it came hurling out of the west and, like the fang of some\ngreat and deadly serpent, darted into the monster that lay in the waters\nof the Sound.\n\nDirk and his companions could see plainly, by the light of the bolt\nitself, that it had crashed into the well from which the Lodorians first\nhad appeared, and that it was beating and hammering its way into the\nvery vitals of the craft.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDazzling, blinding fire seemed to pour from the aperture through which\nthe bolt had passed. The clamor that arose was deafening.\n\nThen again the streak of fires was withdrawn, leaving the night\nintensely black until, in a moment more, it came thundering out of the\nwest again and, with an impact that made the land and the sea and the\nvery heavens tremble, hurled its way into the depths of the doomed\nleviathan.\n\nTwice again it fell, a fiery scimitar out of the darkness, and twice\nagain it careened at the vitals of the stricken monster.\n\nThen, after the assault was over, the ship still floated on the surface\nof the Sound and its shell, as far as Dirk and the others could judge,\nstill was unscathed.\n\n\"We will soon know our fate,\" remarked Steinholt calmly. \"If that didn't\nkill those beasts we might as well give up our ghosts.\"\n\n\"I'll drop the plane a little lower and a little nearer to the ship,\"\nsaid Dirk. \"I don't believe that any life is surviving in that thing.\"\n\n\"My beautiful palace is nothing but dust,\" sighed Fragoni, mournfully.\n\"And all my beautiful treasures, too.\"\n\n\"And that beautiful Zitlan,\" Lazarre reminded him, \"and his beautiful\nboy friends, they are all dust too, thank God!\"\n\n\"It was a queer fate that Stanton met,\" suggested Dirk. \"He thought that\nhe would save his life by going over to our enemies, and, instead of\nthat, he lost it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Poor Stanton,\" said Steinholt. \"He was born that way, I suppose, and I,\nfor one, am ready to forgive and forget him. And now,\" continued the\nTeuton, \"I hope that we didn't do too much damage to that little boat of\nthe Lodorians. If we could get just a little peep at the inside of it we\nmight learn the secret of its contrivance. And then, my friends, we\ncould do a little journeying ourselves.\"\n\n\"Have you any theory regarding it?\" asked Fragoni.\n\n\"Teuxical intimated that it rode the magnetic currents which, of course,\nflow through all the suns and planets in the universe,\" replied\nSteinholt. \"We have been working along that line ourselves, of course,\nand it probably won't be very long anyway before we have the solution of\ninterplanetary travel.\"\n\n\"Those Lodorians would have solved it for us if it hadn't been for\nthat artificial lightning,\" said Lazarre. \"That's powerful stuff,\nSteinholt.\"\n\n\"Yes, with that three-thousand-foot Worldwide Tower to hurl it from,\"\nagreed Steinholt, \"we can get fair range with it. If the Lodorians\nhadn't left the well of their ship open, though, the lightning wouldn't\nhave done us much good. I was afraid, too, for a time, that we might\nhave trouble in welding that automatic wireless circuit box to the\nbottom of the ship.\"\n\nDirk, in the meantime, had brought the plane down to within a half-mile\nof the leviathan, and he was holding it poised there.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" he said, after scrutinizing the monster for a couple\nof minutes, \"that it is moving in the water. It is!\" he exclaimed.\n\"Steinholt! Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnly a comparatively short time had elapsed since the last bolt of\nlightning had vanished back into the darkness.\n\n\"It is still rocking with the force of the shock that we gave it,\"\nasserted Steinholt. \"You would be rocking, too, if you had been tickled\nby a bolt like that one.\"\n\n\"It is rising, I tell you!\" said Dirk. \"The front end of it is slowly\ngetting higher in the water!\"\n\n\"You're right, Dirk,\" said Fragoni, excitement straining his voice.\n\"Look! It just dropped back into the water!\"\n\nThen, as they watched, the movements of the leviathan became more and\nmore agitated, until it was churning up the waves around it like a\nwounded and agonized monster of the sea.\n\nSuddenly the front end tilted upward and the monster rose clear of the\nwater. It shot straight up into the air at a speed so terrific that they\ncould scarcely follow it.\n\n\"It's gone!\" gasped Fragoni. \"Those brainless, mindless automatons must\nhave survived!\"\n\n\"No,\" remarked Steinholt thoughtfully. \"I don't believe that there is\nany life left on that thing. No one had closed the well when it rose,\nand it would mean death to go out into space with the ship in that\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Then what made it go up?\" demanded Lazarre. \"Can the damn thing run\nitself, Steinholt?\"\n\n\"I imagine,\" recalled the Teuton, \"that our bolts killed every living\nthing that was on the craft but that, at the same time, they set the\nmechanism of the monster into action. Ah,\" he moaned, \"but that is too\nbad. We could have learned much by an examination of the interior of\nthat liner of the air.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA cry from Inga startled them and they saw that she was looking skyward,\nwith terror in her eyes.\n\nThey followed her gaze and there, streaking through the black clouds,\nthey saw a long trail of white fire.\n\n\"It's that thing!\" exclaimed Fragoni. \"I tell you that those upon it\nstill live and that they are about to wreak vengeance upon us.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Steinholt positively. \"You are wrong, Fragoni. What is\nhappening may be almost as disastrous, though,\" he admitted. \"That\nleviathan is in its death agonies; it is a metal monster gone mad, and\nnone can say what will happen before it expires.\"\n\n\"The place for us,\" asserted Dirk hurriedly, \"is in the Worldwide Tower.\nThere we can keep track of what is transpiring and try to decide what to\ndo.\"\n\nThe others agreed with him and, seeking the westward level of flight, he\nsped the plane in the direction of the mammoth pyramid from which the\nnews of the world was broadcast.\n\nThey reached the vast structure in a few minutes, and, after dropping\nthe plane on a landing stage, they went into the operating room.\n\nHere they learned quickly that the craft of the Lodorians was doing\nincalculable damage, and that it was throwing the population of the\nworld into an unprecedented panic.\n\nIt was, apparently, following an erratic, uncertain orbit that took it\nfar out into space and then back quite close to the surface of the earth\nagain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had passed through the very heart of Chicago within a few yards of\nthe ground, and it had cut and burned a swath more than a mile wide\nthrough the buildings of that metropolis.\n\nOther cities in America had felt the devastating effects of its\nirresistible and molten heat and, within a short time, thousands of\npeople had been slain by it.\n\nTime and again, from the terrace of the great tower, Dirk and his\ncompanions saw the skies above them light up as that terrible, blazing,\nprojectile which, uncontrolled, went hurtling on its way through the\nnight.\n\nFor three hours it careened on its mad course and hysteria reigned\nthroughout the cities of the whole civilized world.\n\nBut then a report came from a rocket-liner that had left Berlin en route\nfor San Francisco.\n\n\"Either a great meteor or that leviathan of the Lodorians just swept\ndown past us in mid-Atlantic and plunged into the sea. Apparently it has\nexploded, for it has thrown a great column of water for miles up into\nthe air. We are stopping and standing by, although the heat is intense\nand clouds of steam are rising from the sea.\"\n\nAs the minutes passed by after the report from the rocket-ship had been\nreceived, the disappearance from the sky of the flaming craft from space\nseemed to confirm the belief that it had been swallowed by the ocean.\nThis was accepted as a certainty by eight o'clock in the morning.\n\n\"Ah,\" sighed Steinholt, \"if only it had crashed on land somewhere. If\nthere only was enough of it left for us to--\"\n\n\"Enough of any damn contraption of that kind,\" swore Lazarre fervently,\n\"is altogether too much. I hope, for one, that its fragments are\nscattered so far that we never can put them together again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDirk and Inga leaned against one of the parapets that evening on a\ngardened terrace of his own great mansion in Manhattan.\n\nTheir little party had gone there after leaving the Worldwide Tower in\nthe morning.\n\nAfter resting during the day, Lazarre and Fragoni were somewhere\ntogether, discussing the plans for a new palace to take the place of the\none that was destroyed so that Zitlan and his minions might die in its\nruins.\n\nSteinholt, elsewhere, was delving into oceanography and submarine\nengineering, in an attempt to learn whether or not it would be feasible\nto fish for the remains of the lost ship of Lodore.\n\n\"It seems like a dream, doesn't it, Dirk?\" the girl remarked. \"It is\ndifficult to believe that we actually have seen and talked with people\nfrom some far-away world.\"\n\nTogether they looked up into the crystalline skies, where mazes of\nshining stars gave testimony to the countless worlds which were wheeling\naround them.\n\n\"And just to think, Dirk,\" Inga continued proudly, \"that it was you who\nsaved this world and all of its people from that horrible Zitlan and his\nhorde.\"\n\n\"I saved you,\" he told her gravely and tenderly, \"and that somehow means\nmore to me than saving all of this world and all of the other worlds\nwhich are rolling through the uncharted ways of time and space.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  COMING--\n  Murder Madness\n  _An Extraordinary Novel_\n\n  _By_ MURRAY LEINSTER\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber Notes\n\nTypographical inconsistencies have been changed and are listed below.\n\nHyphenation standardized.\n\nArchaic and variable spelling is preserved.\n\nAuthors' punctuation style is preserved.\n\nPassages in italics indicated by _underscores_.\n\nPassages in bold indicated by =equal signs=.\n\n\nTranscriber Changes\n\nThe following changes were made to the original text:\n\n  Page 298: Changed =work= to =wreck= (wish to know whether anyone has\n            visited the scene of the =wreck=)\n\n  Page 299: Changed =focussed= to =focused= (This means that we have\n            =focused= or concentrated cold)\n\n  Page 317: Added beginning quotes (Its name-grid glowed with the\n            letters: =\"_Anita Prince._\"=)\n\n  Page 321: Changed =eavesdroopper= to =eavesdropper= (sitting in the\n            smoking room when the =eavesdropper= fled past)\n\n  Page 321: Changed =pressure-cick= to =pressure-sick= (We missed you at\n            breakfast.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
