P. O. outward mail towers. My purpose was a run to Quebec\nin \"Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be appointed\"; and the\nPostmaster-General himself countersigned the order. This talisman opened\nall doors, even those in the despatching-caisson at the foot of the\ntower, where they were delivering the sorted Continental mail. The bags\nlay packed close as herrings in the long gray under-bodies which our\nG.\u00a0P. O. still calls \"coaches.\" Five such coaches were filled as I\nwatched, and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting\npackets three hundred feet nearer the stars.\n\nFrom the despatching-caisson I was conducted by a courteous and\nwonderfully learned official--Mr. L. L. Geary, Second Despatcher of the\nWestern Route--to the Captains' Room (this wakes an echo of old\nromance), where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty. He\nintroduces me to the Captain of \"162\"--Captain Purnall, and his relief,\nCaptain Hodgson. The one is small and dark; the other large and red; but\neach has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and\na\u00ebronauts. You can see it in the pictures of our racing professionals,\nfrom L. V. Rautsch to little Ada Warrleigh--that fathomless abstraction\nof eyes habitually turned through naked space.\n\nOn the notice-board in the Captains' Room, the pulsing arrows of some\ntwenty indicators register, degree by geographical degree, the progress\nof as many homeward-bound packets. The word \"Cape\" rises across the face\nof a dial; a gong strikes: the South African mid-weekly mail is in at\nthe Highgate Receiving Towers. That is all. It reminds one comically of\nthe traitorous little bell which in pigeon-fanciers' lofts notifies the\nreturn of a homer.\n\n\"Time for us to be on the move,\" says Captain Purnall, and we are shot\nup by the passenger-lift to the top of the despatch-towers. \"Our coach\nwill lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard.\"...\n\n\"No. 162\" waits for us in Slip E of the topmost stage. The great curve\nof her back shines frostily under the lights, and some minute alteration\nof trim makes her rock a little in her holding-down slips.\n\nCaptain Purnall frowns and dives inside. Hissing softly, \"162\" comes to\nrest as level as a rule. From her North Atlantic Winter nose-cap (worn\nbright as diamond with boring through uncounted leagues of hail, snow,\nand ice) to the inset of her three built-out propeller-shafts is some\ntwo hundred and forty feet. Her extreme diameter, carried well forward,\nis thirty-seven. Contrast this with the nine hundred by ninety-five of\nany crack liner and you will realize the power that must drive a hull\nthrough all weathers at more than the emergency-speed of the \"Cyclonic\"!\n\nThe eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping\nhair-crack of the bow-rudder--Magniac's rudder that assured us the\ndominion of the unstable air and left its inventor penniless and\nhalf-blind. It is calculated to Castelli's \"gull-wing\" curve. Raise a\nfew feet of that all but invisible plate three-eighths of an inch and\nshe will yaw five miles to port or starboard ere she is under control\nagain. Give her full helm and she returns on her track like a whip-lash.\nCant the whole forward--a touch on the wheel will suffice--and she\nsweeps at your good direction up or down. Open the complete circle and\nshe presents to the air a mushroom-head that will bring her up all\nstanding within a half mile.\n\n\"Yes,\" says Captain Hodgson, answering my thought, \"Castelli thought\nhe'd discovered the secret of controlling a\u00ebroplanes when he'd only\nfound out how to steer dirigible balloons. Magniac invented his rudder\nto help war-boats ram each other; and war went out of fashion and\nMagniac he went out of his mind because he said he couldn't serve his\ncountry any more. I wonder if any of us ever know what we're really\ndoing.\"\n\n\"If you want to see the coach locked you'd better go aboard. It's due\nnow,\" says Mr. Geary. I enter through the door amidships. There is\nnothing here for display. The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to\nwithin a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of\nthe bilges. Liners and yachts disguise their tanks with decoration, but\nthe G.\u00a0P.\u00a0O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint. The\ninner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but\nthe bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the\nstern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost\namidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an\naperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be\nlocked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the\ndespatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is\nobscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It\nenlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and\nlast a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it\ncomes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap\ninto the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy\nthemselves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the waybill\nover the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr.\nGeary. Receipt has been given and taken. \"Pleasant run,\" says Mr. Geary,\nand disappears through the door which a foot-high pneumatic compressor\nlocks after him.\n\n\"A-ah!\" sighs the compressor released. Our holding-down clips part with\na tang. We are clear.\n\nCaptain Hodgson opens the great colloid underbody-porthole through\nwhich I watch million-lighted London slide eastward as the gale gets\nhold of us. The first of the low winter clouds cuts off the well-known\nview and darkens Middlesex. On the south edge of it I can see a postal\npacket's light ploughing through the white fleece. For an instant she\ngleams like a star ere she drops toward the Highgate Receiving Towers.\n\"The Bombay Mail,\" says Captain Hodgson, and looks at his watch. \"She's\nforty minutes late.\"\n\n\"What's our level?\" I ask.\n\n\"Four thousand. Aren't you coming up on the bridge?\"\n\nThe bridge (let us ever bless the G.\u00a0P.\u00a0O. as a repository of ancientest\ntradition!) is represented by a view of Captain Hodgson's legs where he\nstands on the control platform that runs thwartships overhead. The bow\ncolloid is unshuttered and Captain Purnall, one hand on the wheel, is\nfeeling for a fair slant. The dial shows 4,300 feet.\n\n\"It's steep to-night,\" he mutters, as tier on tier of cloud drops under.\n\"We generally pick up an easterly draught below three thousand at this\ntime o' the year. I hate slathering through fluff.\"\n\n\"So does Van Cutsem. Look at him huntin' for a slant!\" says Captain\nHodgson. A fog-light breaks cloud a hundred fathoms below. The Antwerp\nNight Mail makes her signal and rises between two racing clouds far to\nport, her flanks blood-red in the glare of Sheerness Double Light. The\ngale will have us over the North Sea in half an hour, but Captain\nPurnall lets her go composedly--nosing to every point of the compass as\nshe rises.\n\n\"Five thousand--six, six thousand eight hundred\"--the dip-dial reads ere\nwe find the easterly drift, heralded by a flurry of snow at the\nthousand-fathom level. Captain Purnall rings up the engines and keys\ndown the governor on the switch before him. There is no sense in urging\nmachinery when \u00c6olus himself gives you good knots for nothing. We are\naway in earnest now--our nose notched home on our chosen star. At this\nlevel the lower clouds are laid out all neatly combed by the dry fingers\nof the East. Below that again is the strong westerly blow through which\nwe rose. Overhead, a film of southerly drifting mist draws a theatrical\ngauze across the firmament. The moonlight turns the lower strata to\nsilver without a stain except where our shadow underruns us. Bristol and\nCardiff Double Lights (those statelily inclined beams over Severnmouth)\nare dead ahead of us; for we keep the Southern Winter Route. Coventry\nCentral, the pivot of the English system, stabs upward once in ten\nseconds its spear of diamond light to the north; and a point or two off\nour starboard bow The Leek, the great cloud-breaker of Saint David's\nHead, swings its unmistakable green beam twenty-five degrees each way.\nThere must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather, but it does\nnot affect The Leek.\n\n\"Our planet's overlighted if anything,\" says Captain Purnall at the\nwheel, as Cardiff-Bristol slides under. \"I remember the old days of\ncommon white verticals that 'ud show two or three thousand feet up in a\nmist, if you knew where to look for 'em. In really fluffy weather they\nmight as well have been under your hat. One could get lost coming home\nthen, an' have some fun. Now, it's like driving down Piccadilly.\"\n\nHe points to the pillars of light where the cloud-breakers bore through\nthe cloud-floor. We see nothing of England's outlines: only a white\npavement pierced in all directions by these manholes of variously\ncoloured fire--Holy Island's white and red--St. Bee's interrupted white,\nand so on as far as the eye can reach. Blessed be Sargent, Ahrens, and\nthe Dubois brothers, who invented the cloud-breakers of the world\nwhereby we travel in security!\n\n\"Are you going to lift for The Shamrock?\" asks Captain Hodgson. Cork\nLight (green, fixed) enlarges as we rush to it. Captain Purnall nods.\nThere is heavy traffic hereabouts--the cloud-bank beneath us is streaked\nwith running fissures of flame where the Atlantic boats are hurrying\nLondonward just clear of the fluff. Mail-packets are supposed, under the\nConference rules, to have the five-thousand-foot lanes to themselves,\nbut the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties with English air.\n\"No. 162\" lifts to a long-drawn wail of the breeze in the fore-flange of\nthe rudder and we make Valencia (white, green, white) at a safe 7,000\nfeet, dipping our beam to an incoming Washington packet.\n\nThere is no cloud on the Atlantic, and faint streaks of cream round\nDingle Bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast. A big\nS.\u00a0A.\u00a0T.\u00a0A. liner (_Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Transports A\u00ebriens_) is diving\nand lifting half a mile below us in search of some break in the solid\nwest wind. Lower still lies a disabled Dane: she is telling the liner\nall about it in International. Our General Communication dial has caught\nher talk and begins to eavesdrop. Captain Hodgson makes a motion to shut\nit off but checks himself. \"Perhaps you'd like to listen,\" he says.\n\n\"'Argol' of St. Thomas,\" the Dane whimpers. \"Report owners three\nstarboard shaft collar-bearings fused. Can make Flores as we are, but\nimpossible further. Shall we buy spares at Fayal?\"\n\nThe liner acknowledges and recommends inverting the bearings. The\n\"Argol\" answers that she has already done so without effect, and begins\nto relieve her mind about cheap German enamels for collar-bearings. The\nFrenchman assents cordially, cries \"_Courage, mon ami_,\" and switches\noff.\n\nTheir lights sink under the curve of the ocean.\n\n\"That's one of Lundt & Bleamers's boats,\" says Captain Hodgson. \"Serves\n'em right for putting German compos in their thrust-blocks. _She_ won't\nbe in Fayal to-night! By the way, wouldn't you like to look round the\nengine-room?\"\n\nI have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and I follow Captain\nHodgson from the control-platform, stooping low to avoid the bulge of\nthe tanks. We know that Fleury's gas can lift anything, as the\nworld-famous trials of '89 showed, but its almost indefinite powers of\nexpansion necessitate vast tank room. Even in this thin air the\nlift-shunts are busy taking out one-third of its normal lift, and still\n\"162\" must be checked by an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our\nflight would become a climb to the stars. Captain Purnall prefers an\noverlifted to an underlifted ship; but no two captains trim ship alike.\n\"When _I_ take the bridge,\" says Captain Hodgson, \"you'll see me shunt\nforty per cent. of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper\nrudder. With a swoop upwards instead of a swoop downwards, _as_ you say.\nEither way will do. It's only habit. Watch our dip-dial! Tim fetches her\ndown once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing.\"\n\nSo is it shown on the dip-dial. For five or six minutes the arrow creeps\nfrom 6,700 to 7,300. There is the faint \"szgee\" of the rudder, and back\nslides the arrow to 6,500 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots.\n\n\"In heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well,\" says Captain\nHodgson, and, unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engine-room\nfrom the bare deck, he leads me on to the floor.\n\nHere we find Fleury's Paradox of the Bulkheaded Vacuum--which we accept\nnow without thought--literally in full blast. The three engines are\nH.\u00a0T.\u00a0&.\u00a0T. assisted-vacuo Fleury turbines running from 3,000 to the\nLimit--that is to say, up to the point when the blades make the air\n\"bell\"--cut out a vacuum for themselves precisely as over-driven marine\npropellers used to do. \"162's\" Limit is low on account of the small size\nof her nine screws, which, though handier than the old colloid\nThelussons, \"bell\" sooner. The midships engine, generally used as a\nreinforce, is not running; so the port and starboard turbine\nvacuum-chambers draw direct into the return-mains.\n\nThe turbines whistle reflectively. From the low-arched expansion-tanks\non either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbine-chests, and\nthence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a\nforce that would whip the teeth out of a power-saw. Behind, is its own\npressure held in leash or spurred on by the lift-shunts; before it, the\nvacuum where Fleury's Ray dances in violet-green bands and whirled\nturbillions of flame. The jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are\npressure-tempered colloid (no glass would endure the strain for an\ninstant) and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray\nintently. It is the very heart of the machine--a mystery to this day.\nEven Fleury who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multi-millionaire,\ncould not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube\ncan, in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious blast of\ngas into a chill grayish-green liquid that drains (you can hear it\ntrickle) from the far end of the vacuum through the eduction-pipes and\nthe mains back to the bilges. Here it returns to its gaseous, one had\nalmost written sagacious, state and climbs to work afresh. Bilge-tank,\nupper tank, dorsal-tank, expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a\nliquid), and bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury's Ray\nsees to that; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to\nFleury's Ray. If a speck of oil, if even the natural grease of the human\nfinger touch the hooded terminals Fleury's Ray will wink and disappear\nand must be laboriously built up again. This means half a day's work\nfor all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventy-odd pounds to\nthe G.\u00a0P.\u00a0O. for radium-salts and such trifles.\n\n\"Now look at our thrust-collars. You won't find much German compo there.\nFull-jewelled, you see,\" says Captain Hodgson as the engineer shunts\nopen the top of a cap. Our shaft-bearings are C. M. C. (Commercial\nMinerals Company) stones, ground with as much care as the lens of a\ntelescope. They cost \u00a337 apiece. So far we have not arrived at their\nterm of life. These bearings came from \"No. 97,\" which took them over\nfrom the old \"Dominion of Light,\" which had them out of the wreck of the\n\"Perseus\" a\u00ebroplane in the years when men still flew linen kites over\nthorium engines!\n\nThey are a shining reproof to all low-grade German \"ruby\" enamels,\nso-called \"boort\" facings, and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina\ncompounds which please dividend-hunting owners and turn skippers crazy.\n\nThe rudder-gear and the gas lift-shunt, seated side by side under the\nengine-room dials, are the only machines in visible motion. The former\nsighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch.\nThe latter, cased and guarded like the U-tube aft, exhibits another\nFleury Ray, but inverted and more green than violet. Its function is to\nshunt the lift out of the gas, and this it will do without watching.\nThat is all! A tiny pump-rod wheezing and whining to itself beside a\nsputtering green lamp. A hundred and fifty feet aft down the flat-topped\ntunnel of the tanks a violet light, restless and irresolute. Between the\ntwo, three white-painted turbine-trunks, like eel-baskets laid on their\nside, accentuate the empty perspectives. You can hear the trickle of\nthe liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the bilge-tanks and the\nsoft _gluck-glock_ of gas-locks closing as Captain Purnall brings \"162\"\ndown by the head. The hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our\nskin is no more than a cotton-wool wrapping to the universal stillness.\nAnd we are running an eighteen-second mile.\n\nI peer from the fore end of the engine-room over the hatch-coamings into\nthe coach. The mail-clerks are sorting the Winnipeg, Calgary, and\nMedicine Hat bags: but there is a pack of cards ready on the table.\n\nSuddenly a bell thrills; the engineers run to the turbine-valves and\nstand by; but the spectacled slave of the Ray in the U-tube never lifts\nhis head. He must watch where he is. We are hard-braked and going\nastern; there is language from the control-platform.\n\n\"Tim's sparking badly about something,\" says the unruffled Captain\nHodgson. \"Let's look.\"\n\nCaptain Purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since, but the\nembodied authority of the G.\u00a0P.\u00a0O. Ahead of us floats an ancient,\naluminum-patched, twin-screw tramp of the dingiest, with no more right\nto the 5,000 foot lane than has a horse-cart to a modern town. She\ncarries an obsolete \"barbette\" conning-tower--a six-foot affair with\nrailed platform forward--and our warning beam plays on the top of it as\na policeman's lantern flashes on the area sneak. Like a sneak-thief,\ntoo, emerges a shock-headed navigator in his shirt-sleeves. Captain\nPurnall wrenches open the colloid to talk with him man to man. There are\ntimes when Science does not satisfy.\n\n\"What under the stars are you doing here, you sky-scraping\nchimney-sweep?\" he shouts as we two drift side by side. \"Do you know\nthis is a Mail-lane? You call yourself a sailor, sir? You ain't fit to\npeddle toy balloons to an Esquimaux. Your name and number! Report and\nget down, and be----!\"\n\n\"I've been blown up once,\" the shock-headed man cries, hoarsely, as a\ndog barking. \"I don't care two flips of a contact for anything _you_ can\ndo, Postey.\"\n\n\"Don't you, sir? But I'll make you care. I'll have you towed stern first\nto Disko and broke up. You can't recover insurance if you're broke for\nobstruction. Do you understand _that_?\"\n\nThen the stranger bellows: \"Look at my propellers! There's been a\nwulli-wa down under that has knocked us into umbrella-frames! We've been\nblown up about forty thousand feet! We're all one conjuror's watch\ninside! My mate's arm's broke; my engineer's head's cut open; my Ray\nwent out when the engines smashed; and ... and ... for pity's sake give\nme my height, Captain! We doubt we're dropping.\"\n\n\"Six thousand eight hundred. Can you hold it?\" Captain Purnall overlooks\nall insults, and leans half out of the colloid, staring and snuffing.\nThe stranger leaks pungently.\n\n\"We ought to blow into St. John's with luck. We're trying to plug the\nfore-tank now, but she's simply whistling it away,\" her captain wails.\n\n\"She's sinking like a log,\" says Captain Purnall in an undertone. \"Call\nup the Banks Mark Boat, George.\" Our dip-dial shows that we, keeping\nabreast the tramp, have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes.\n\nCaptain Purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing\nthrough the night, twizzling spokes of light across infinity.\n\n\"That'll fetch something,\" he says, while Captain Hodgson watches the\nGeneral Communicator. He has called up the North Banks Mark Boat, a few\nhundred miles west, and is reporting the case.\n\n\"I'll stand by you,\" Captain Purnall roars to the lone figure on the\nconning-tower.\n\n\"Is it as bad as that?\" comes the answer. \"She isn't insured, she's\nmine.\"\n\n\"Might have guessed as much,\" mutters Hodgson. \"Owner's risk is the\nworst risk of all!\"\n\n\"Can't I fetch St. John's--not even with this breeze?\" the voice\nquavers.\n\n\"Stand by to abandon ship. Haven't you _any_ lift in you, fore or aft?\"\n\n\"Nothing but the midship tanks and they're none too tight. You see, my\nRay gave out and--\" he coughs in the reek of the escaping gas.\n\n\"You poor devil!\" This does not reach our friend. \"What does the Mark\nBoat say, George?\"\n\n\"Wants to know if there's any danger to traffic. Says she's in a bit of\nweather herself and can't quit station. I've turned in a General Call,\nso even if they don't see our beam some one's bound to help--or else we\nmust. Shall I clear our slings. Hold on! Here we are! A Planet liner,\ntoo! She'll be up in a tick!\"\n\n\"Tell her to have her slings ready,\" cries his brother captain. \"There\nwon't be much time to spare.... Tie up your mate,\" he roars to the\ntramp.\n\n\"My mate's all right. It's my engineer. He's gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Shunt the lift out of him with a spanner. Hurry!\"\n\n\"But I can make St. John's if you'll stand by.\"\n\n\"You'll make the deep, wet Atlantic in twenty minutes. You're less than\nfifty-eight hundred now. Get your papers.\"\n\nA Planet liner, east bound, heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the\nair of us humming. Her underbody colloid is open and her\ntransporter-slings hang down like tentacles. We shut off our beam as she\nadjusts herself--steering to a hair--over the tramp's conning-tower. The\nmate comes up, his arm strapped to his side, and stumbles into the\ncradle. A man with a ghastly scarlet head follows, shouting that he must\ngo back and build up his Ray. The mate assures him that he will find a\nnice new Ray all ready in the liner's engine-room. The bandaged head\ngoes up wagging excitedly. A youth and a woman follow. The liner cheers\nhollowly above us, and we see the passengers' faces at the saloon\ncolloid.\n\n\"That's a good girl. What's the fool waiting for now?\" says Captain\nPurnall.\n\nThe skipper comes up, still appealing to us to stand by and see him\nfetch St. John's. He dives below and returns--at which we little human\nbeings in the void cheer louder than ever--with the ship's kitten. Up\nfly the liner's hissing slings; her underbody crashes home and she\nhurtles away again. The dial shows less than 3,000 feet.\n\nThe Mark Boat signals we must attend to the derelict, now whistling her\ndeath song, as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags.\n\n\"Keep our beam on her and send out a General Warning,\" says Captain\nPurnall, following her down.\n\nThere is no need. Not a liner in air but knows the meaning of that\nvertical beam and gives us and our quarry a wide berth.\n\n\"But she'll drown in the water, won't she?\" I ask.\n\n\"Not always,\" is his answer. \"I've known a derelict up-end and sift her\nengines out of herself and flicker round the Lower Lanes for three weeks\non her forward tanks only. We'll run no risks. Pith her, George, and\nlook sharp. There's weather ahead.\"\n\nCaptain Hodgson opens the underbody colloid, swings the heavy\npithing-iron out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a\nsettee, and at two hundred feet releases the catch. We hear the whir of\nthe crescent-shaped arms opening as they descend. The derelict's\nforehead is punched in, starred across, and rent diagonally. She falls\nstern first, our beam upon her; slides like a lost soul down that\npitiless ladder of light, and the Atlantic takes her.\n\n[Illustration: \"SLIDES LIKE A LOST SOUL DOWN THAT PITILESS LADDER OF\nLIGHT, AND THE ATLANTIC TAKES HER\"]\n\n\"A filthy business,\" says Hodgson. \"I wonder what it must have been like\nin the old days.\"\n\nThe thought had crossed my mind too. What if that wavering carcass\nhad been filled with International-speaking men of all the\nInternationalities, each one of them taught (_that_ is the horror of\nit!) that after death he would very possibly go forever to unspeakable\ntorment?\n\nAnd not half a century since, we (one knows now that we are only our\nfathers re-enlarged upon the earth), _we_, I say, ripped and rammed and\npithed to admiration.\n\nHere Tim, from the control-platform, shouts that we are to get into our\ninflators and to bring him his at once.\n\nWe hurry into the heavy rubber suits--and the engineers are already\ndressed--and inflate at the air-pump taps. G.\u00a0P.\u00a0O. inflators are\nthrice as thick as a racing man's \"flickers,\" and chafe abominably under\nthe armpits. George takes the wheel until Tim has blown himself up to\nthe extreme of rotundity. If you kicked him off the c. p. to the deck he\nwould bounce back. But it is \"162\" that will do the kicking.\n\n\"The Mark Boat's mad--stark ravin' crazy,\" he snorts, returning to\ncommand. \"She says there's a bad blow-out ahead and wants me to pull\nover to Greenland. I'll see her pithed first! We wasted an hour and a\nquarter over that dead duck down under, and now I'm expected to go\nrubbin' my back all round the Pole. What does she think a postal\npacket's made of? Gummed silk? Tell her we're coming on straight,\nGeorge.\"\n\nGeorge buckles him into the Frame and switches on the Direct Control.\nNow under Tim's left toe lies the port-engine Accelerator; under his\nleft heel the Reverse, and so with the other foot. The lift-shunt stops\nstand out on the rim of the steering-wheel where the fingers of his left\nhand can play on them. At his right hand is the midships engine lever\nready to be thrown into gear at a moment's notice. He leans forward in\nhis belt, eyes glued to the colloid, and one ear cocked toward the\nGeneral Communicator. Henceforth he is the strength and direction of\n\"162,\" through whatever may befall.\n\nThe Banks Mark Boat is reeling out pages of A. B. C. Directions to the\ntraffic at large. We are to secure all \"loose objects\"; hood up our\nFleury Rays; and \"on no account to attempt to clear snow from our\nconning-towers till the weather abates.\" Under-powered craft, we are\ntold, can ascend to the limit of their lift, mail-packets to look out\nfor them accordingly; the lower lanes westward are pitting very badly,\n\"with frequent blow-outs, vortices, laterals, etc.\"\n\nStill the clear dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the\nelectric skin-tension (I feel as though I were a lace-maker's pillow)\nand an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator\nincreases almost to hysteria.\n\nWe have made eight thousand feet since we pithed the tramp and our\nturbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots.\n\nVery far to the west an elongated blur of red, low down, shows us the\nNorth Banks Mark Boat. There are specks of fire round her rising and\nfalling--bewildered planets about an unstable sun--helpless shipping\nhanging on to her light for company's sake. No wonder she could not quit\nstation.\n\nShe warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which\n(her beam shows it) she is even now reeling.\n\nThe pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous\nfilms--wreathing and uneasy shapes. One forms itself into a globe of\npale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by. It\nleaps monstrously across the blackness, alights on the precise tip of\nour nose, pirouettes there an instant, and swings off. Our roaring bow\nsinks as though that light were lead--sinks and recovers to lurch and\nstumble again beneath the next blow-out. Tim's fingers on the lift-shunt\nstrike chords of numbers--1:4:7:--2:4:6:--7:5:3, and so on; for he is\nrunning by his tanks only, lifting or lowering her against the uneasy\nair. All three engines are at work, for the sooner we have skated over\nthis thin ice the better. Higher we dare not go. The whole upper vault\nis charged with pale krypton vapours, which our skin friction may\nexcite to unholy manifestations. Between the upper and the lower\nlevels--5,000, and 7,000, hints the Mark Boat--we may perhaps bolt\nthrough if.... Our bow clothes itself in blue flame and falls like a\nsword. No human skill can keep pace with the changing tensions. A vortex\nhas us by the beak and we dive down a two-thousand-foot slant at an\nangle (the dip-dial and my bouncing body record it) of thirty-five. Our\nturbines scream shrilly; the propellers cannot bite on the thin air; Tim\nshunts the lift out of five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her\nbulletwise through the maelstrom till she cushions with a jar on an\nup-gust, three thousand feet below.\n\n\"_Now_ we've done it,\" says George in my ear. \"Our skin-friction that\nlast slide, has played Old Harry with the tensions! Look out for\nlaterals, Tim, she'll want some holding.\"\n\n\"I've got her,\" is the answer. \"Come _up_, old woman.\"\n\nShe comes up nobly, but the laterals buffet her left and right like the\npinions of angry angels. She is jolted off her course in four ways at\nonce, and cuffed into place again, only to be swung aside and dropped\ninto a new chaos. We are never without a corposant grinning on our bows\nor rolling head over heels from nose to midships, and to the crackle of\nelectricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of\nhail--hail that will never fall on any sea. Slow we must or we may break\nour back, pitch-poling.\n\n\"Air's a perfectly elastic fluid,\" roars George above the tumult. \"About\nas elastic as a head sea off the Fastnet, aint it?\"\n\n[Illustration: THE STORM]\n\nHe is less than just to the good element. If one intrudes on the\nHeavens when they are balancing their volt-accounts; if one disturbs the\nHigh Gods' market-rates by hurling steel hulls at ninety knots across\ntremblingly adjusted electric tensions, one must not complain of any\nrudeness in the reception. Tim met it with an unmoved countenance, one\ncorner of his under lip caught up on a tooth, his eyes fleeting into the\nblackness twenty miles ahead, and the fierce sparks flying from his\nknuckles at every turn of the hand. Now and again he shook his head to\nclear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows, and it was then that\nGeorge, watching his chance, would slide down the life-rail and swab his\nface quickly with a big red handkerchief. I never imagined that a human\nbeing could so continuously labour and so collectedly think as did Tim\nthrough that Hell's half hour when the flurry was at its worst. We were\ndragged hither and yon by warm or frozen suctions, belched up on the\ntops of wulli-was, spun down by vortices and clubbed aside by laterals\nunder a dizzying rush of stars in the company of a drunken moon. I heard\nthe rushing click of the midship-engine-lever sliding in and out, the\nlow growl of the lift-shunts, and, louder than the yelling winds\nwithout, the scream of the bow-rudder gouging into any lull that\npromised hold for an instant. At last we began to claw up on a cant,\nbow-rudder and port-propeller together; only the nicest balancing of\ntanks saved us from spinning like the rifle-bullet of the old days.\n\n\"We've got to hitch to windward of that Mark Boat somehow,\" George\ncried.\n\n\"There's no windward,\" I protested feebly, where I swung shackled to a\nstanchion. \"How can there be?\"\n\nHe laughed--as we pitched into a thousand foot blow-out--that red man\nlaughed beneath his inflated hood!\n\n\"Look!\" he said. \"We must clear those refugees with a high lift.\"\n\nThe Mark Boat was below and a little to the sou'west of us, fluctuating\nin the centre of her distraught galaxy. The air was thick with moving\nlights at every level. I take it most of them were trying to lie head to\nwind but, not being hydras, they failed. An under-tanked Moghrabi boat\nhad risen to the limit of her lift and, finding no improvement, had\ndropped a couple of thousand. There she met a superb wulli-wa and was\nblown up spinning like a dead leaf. Instead of shutting off she went\nastern and, naturally, rebounded as from a wall almost into the Mark\nBoat, whose language (our G. C. took it in) was humanly simple.\n\n\"If they'd only ride it out quietly it 'ud be better,\" said George in a\ncalm, as we climbed like a bat above them all. \"But some skippers\n_will_ navigate without enough lift. What does that Tad-boat think she\nis doing, Tim?\"\n\n\"Playin' kiss in the ring,\" was Tim's unmoved reply. A Trans-Asiatic\nDirect liner had found a smooth and butted into it full power. But there\nwas a vortex at the tail of that smooth, so the T. A. D. was flipped out\nlike a pea from off a fingernail, braking madly as she fled down and all\nbut over-ending.\n\n\"Now I hope she's satisfied,\" said Tim. \"I'm glad I'm not a Mark\nBoat.... Do I want help?\" The C. G. dial had caught his ear. \"George,\nyou may tell that gentleman with my love--love, remember, George--that I\ndo not want help. Who _is_ the officious sardine-tin?\"\n\n\"A Rimouski drogher on the lookout for a tow.\"\n\n\"Very kind of the Rimouski drogher. This postal packet isn't being towed\nat present.\"\n\n\"Those droghers will go anywhere on a chance of salvage,\" George\nexplained. \"We call 'em kittiwakes.\"\n\nA long-beaked, bright steel ninety-footer floated at ease for one\ninstant within hail of us, her slings coiled ready for rescues, and a\nsingle hand in her open tower. He was smoking. Surrendered to the\ninsurrection of the airs through which we tore our way, he lay in\nabsolute peace. I saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his\nboat dropped, it seemed, like a stone in a well.\n\nWe had just cleared the Mark Boat and her disorderly neighbours when the\nstorm ended as suddenly as it had begun. A shooting-star to northward\nfilled the sky with the green blink of a meteorite dissipating itself in\nour atmosphere.\n\nSaid George: \"That may iron out all the tensions.\" Even as he spoke, the\nconflicting winds came to rest; the levels filled; the laterals died out\nin long easy swells; the airways were smoothed before us. In less than\nthree minutes the covey round the Mark Boat had shipped their\npower-lights and whirred away upon their businesses.\n\n\"What's happened?\" I gasped. The nerve-storm within and the volt-tingle\nwithout had passed: my inflators weighed like lead.\n\n\"God, He knows!\" said Captain George, soberly. \"That old shooting-star's\nskin-friction has discharged the different levels. I've seen it happen\nbefore. Phew! What a relief!\"\n\nWe dropped from ten to six thousand and got rid of our clammy suits. Tim\nshut off and stepped out of the Frame. The Mark Boat was coming up\nbehind us. He opened the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mopped\nhis face.\n\n\"Hello, Williams!\" he cried. \"A degree or two out o' station, ain't\nyou?\"\n\n\"May be,\" was the answer from the Mark Boat. \"I've had some company this\nevening.\"\n\n\"So I noticed. Wasn't that quite a little draught?\"\n\n\"I warned you. Why didn't you pull out round by Disko? The east-bound\npackets have.\"\n\n\"Me? Not till I'm running a Polar consumptives' Sanatorium boat. I was\nsquinting through a colloid before you were out of your cradle, my son.\"\n\n\"I'd be the last man to deny it,\" the captain of the Mark Boat replies\nsoftly. \"The way you handled her just now--I'm a pretty fair judge of\ntraffic in a volt-flurry--it was a thousand revolutions beyond anything\neven _I_'ve ever seen.\"\n\nTim's back supples visibly to this oiling. Captain George on the c. p.\nwinks and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden\npinned up on Tim's telescope-bracket above the steering-wheel.\n\nI see. Wholly and entirely do I see!\n\nThere is some talk overhead of \"coming round to tea on Friday,\" a brief\nreport of the derelict's fate, and Tim volunteers as he descends: \"For\nan A. B. C. man young Williams is less of a high-tension fool than\nsome.... Were you thinking of taking her on, George? Then I'll just have\na look round that port-thrust--seems to me it's a trifle warm--and we'll\njog along.\"\n\nThe Mark Boat hums off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed\neyrie. Here she will stay, a shutterless observatory; a life-boat\nstation; a salvage tug; a court of ultimate appeal-cum-meteorological\nbureau for three hundred miles in all directions, till Wednesday next\nwhen her relief slides across the stars to take her buffeted place. Her\nblack hull, double conning-tower, and ever-ready slings represent all\nthat remains to the planet of that odd old word authority. She is\nresponsible only to the A\u00ebrial Board of Control--the A. B. C. of which\nTim speaks so flippantly. But that semi-elected, semi-nominated body of\na few score persons of both sexes, controls this planet. \"Transportation\nis Civilization,\" our motto runs. Theoretically, we do what we please so\nlong as we do not interfere with the traffic _and all it implies_.\nPractically, the A. B. C. confirms or annuls all international\narrangements and, to judge from its last report, finds our tolerant,\nhumorous, lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden\nof private administration on its shoulders.\n\nI discuss this with Tim, sipping mat\u00e9 on the c. p. while George fans her\nalong over the white blur of the Banks in beautiful upward curves of\nfifty miles each. The dip-dial translates them on the tape in flowing\nfreehand.\n\nTim gathers up a skein of it and surveys the last few feet, which record\n\"162's\" path through the volt-flurry.\n\n\"I haven't had a fever-chart like this to show up in five years,\" he\nsays ruefully.\n\nA postal packet's dip-dial records every yard of every run. The tapes\nthen go to the A.\u00a0B.\u00a0C., which collates and makes composite photographs\nof them for the instruction of captains. Tim studies his irrevocable\npast, shaking his head.\n\n\"Hello! Here's a fifteen-hundred-foot drop at eighty-five degrees! We\nmust have been standing on our heads then, George.\"\n\n\"You don't say so,\" George answers. \"I fancied I noticed it at the\ntime.\"\n\nGeorge may not have Captain Purnall's catlike swiftness, but he is all\nan artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the shunt-stops.\nThe delicious flight-curves come away on the tape with never a waver.\nThe Mark Boat's vertical spindle of light lies down to eastward, setting\nin the face of the following stars. Westward, where no planet should\nrise, the triple verticals of Trinity Bay (we keep still to the Southern\nroute) make a low-lifting haze. We seem the only thing at rest under all\nthe heavens; floating at ease till the earth's revolution shall turn up\nour landing-towers.\n\nAnd minute by minute our silent clock gives us a sixteen-second mile.\n\n\"Some fine night,\" says Tim. \"We'll be even with that clock's Master.\"\n\n\"He's coming now,\" says George, over his shoulder. \"I'm chasing the\nnight west.\"\n\nThe stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under\nunobserved, but the deep air-boom on our skin changes to a joyful shout.\n\n\"The dawn-gust,\" says Tim. \"It'll go on to meet the Sun. Look! Look!\nThere's the dark being crammed back over our bow! Come to the\nafter-colloid. I'll show you something.\"\n\nThe engine-room is hot and stuffy; the clerks in the coach are asleep,\nand the Slave of the Ray is near to follow them. Tim slides open the aft\ncolloid and reveals the curve of the world--the ocean's deepest\npurple--edged with fuming and intolerable gold. Then the Sun rises and\nthrough the colloid strikes out our lamps. Tim scowls in his face.\n\n\"Squirrels in a cage,\" he mutters. \"That's all we are. Squirrels in a\ncage! He's going twice as fast as us. Just you wait a few years, my\nshining friend and we'll take steps that will amaze you. _We'll_ Joshua\nyou!\"\n\nYes, that is our dream: to turn all earth into the Vale of Ajalon at our\npleasure. So far, we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length in\nthese latitudes. But some day--even on the Equator--we shall hold the\nSun level in his full stride.\n\nNow we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic. A big submersible\nbreaks water suddenly. Another and another follow with a swash and a\nsuck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures. The deep-sea\nfreighters are rising to lung up after the long night, and the\nleisurely ocean is all patterned with peacock's eyes of foam.\n\n\"We'll lung up, too,\" says Tim, and when we return to the c. p. George\nshuts off, the colloids are opened, and the fresh air sweeps her out.\nThere is no hurry. The old contracts (they will be revised at the end of\nthe year) allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind\nher in ten. So we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which\npushes us along at a languid twenty.\n\nTo enjoy life, and tobacco, begin both on a sunny morning half a mile or\nso above the dappled Atlantic cloud-belts and after a volt-flurry which\nhas cleared and tempered your nerves. While we discussed the thickening\ntraffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved\nto ourselves, we heard (and I for the first time) the morning hymn on a\nHospital boat.\n\nShe was cloaked by a skein of ravelled fluff beneath us and we caught\nthe chant before she rose into the sunlight. \"_Oh, ye Winds of God_,\"\nsang the unseen voices: \"_bless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him\nforever!_\"\n\nWe slid off our caps and joined in. When our shadow fell across her\ngreat open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands\nneighbourly while they sang. We could see the doctors and the nurses and\nthe white-button-like faces of the cot-patients. She passed slowly\nbeneath us, heading northward, her hull, wet with the dews of the night,\nall ablaze in the sunshine. So took she the shadow of a cloud and\nvanished, her song continuing. _Oh, ye holy and humble men of heart,\nbless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him forever._\n\n\"She's a public lunger or she wouldn't have been singing the\n_Benedicite_; and she's a Greenlander or she wouldn't have snow-blinds\nover her colloids,\" said George at last. \"She'll be bound for\nFrederikshavn or one of the Glacier sanatoriums for a month. If she was\nan accident ward she'd be hung up at the eight-thousand-foot level.\nYes--consumptives.\"\n\n\"Funny how the new things are the old things. I've read in books,\" Tim\nanswered, \"that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to the\ntops of hills because microbes were fewer there. We hoist 'em into\nsterilized air for a while. Same idea. How much do the doctors say we've\nadded to the average life of a man?\"\n\n\"Thirty years,\" says George with a twinkle in his eye. \"Are we going to\nspend 'em all up here, Tim?\"\n\n\"Flap along, then. Flap along. Who's hindering?\" the senior captain\nlaughed, as we went in.\n\nWe held a good lift to clear the coastwise and Continental shipping;\nand we had need of it. Though our route is in no sense a populated one,\nthere is a steady trickle of traffic this way along. We met Hudson Bay\nfurriers out of the Great Preserve, hurrying to make their departure\nfrom Bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets. We\nover-crossed Keewatin liners, small and cramped; but their captains, who\nsee no land between Trepassy and Blanco, know what gold they bring back\nfrom West Africa. Trans-Asiatic Directs, we met, soberly ringing the\nworld round the Fiftieth Meridian at an honest seventy knots; and\nwhite-painted Ackroyd & Hunt fruiters out of the south fled beneath us,\ntheir ventilated hulls whistling like Chinese kites. Their market is in\nthe North among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their\ngrapefruit and bananas across the cold snows. Argentine beef boats we\nsighted too, of enormous capacity and unlovely outline. They, too, feed\nthe northern health stations in ice-bound ports where submersibles dare\nnot rise.\n\nYellow-bellied ore-flats and Ungava petrol-tanks punted down leisurely\nout of the north like strings of unfrightened wild duck. It does not pay\nto \"fly\" minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary; but the\nrisks of transhipping to submersibles in the ice-pack off Nain or Hebron\nare so great that these heavy freighters fly down to Halifax direct, and\nscent the air as they go. They are the biggest tramps aloft except the\nAthabasca grain-tubs. But these last, now that the wheat is moved, are\nbusy, over the world's shoulder, timber-lifting in Siberia.\n\nWe held to the St. Lawrence (it is astonishing how the old water-ways\nstill pull us children of the air), and followed his broad line of\nblack between its drifting ice blocks, all down the Park that the wisdom\nof our fathers--but every one knows the Quebec run.\n\nWe dropped to the Heights Receiving Towers twenty minutes ahead of time\nand there hung at ease till the Yokohama Intermediate Packet could pull\nout and give us our proper slip. It was curious to watch the action of\nthe holding-down clips all along the frosty river front as the boats\ncleared or came to rest. A big Hamburger was leaving Pont Levis and her\ncrew, unshipping the platform railings, began to sing \"Elsinore\"--the\noldest of our chanteys. You know it of course:\n\n   _Mother Rugen's tea-house on the Baltic_--\n     _Forty couple waltzing on the floor!_\n   _And you can watch my Ray,_\n   _For I must go away_\n     _And dance with Ella Sweyn at Elsinore!_\n\nThen, while they sweated home the covering-plates:\n\n     _Nor-Nor-Nor-Nor-_\n   _West from Sourabaya to the Baltic--_\n     _Ninety knot an hour to the Skaw!_\n   _Mother Rugen's tea-house on the Baltic_\n     _And a dance with Ella Sweyn at Elsinore!_\n\nThe clips parted with a gesture of indignant dismissal, as though\nQuebec, glittering under her snows, were casting out these light and\nunworthy lovers. Our signal came from the Heights. Tim turned and\nfloated up, but surely then it was with passionate appeal that the great\ntower arms flung open--or did I think so because on the upper staging a\nlittle hooded figure also opened her arms wide towards her father?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn ten seconds the coach with its clerks clashed down to the\nreceiving-caisson; the hostlers displaced the engineers at the idle\nturbines, and Tim, prouder of this than all, introduced me to the maiden\nof the photograph on the shelf. \"And by the way,\" said he to her,\nstepping forth in sunshine under the hat of civil life, \"I saw young\nWilliams in the Mark Boat. I've asked him to tea on Friday.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"I'VE ASKED HIM TO TEA ON FRIDAY\"]\n\n\n\n\nAERIAL BOARD OF CONTROL BULLETIN\n\n\n\n\nAerial Board of Control\n\nLights\n\n\nNo changes in English Inland lights for week ending Dec. 18.\n\nPLANETARY COASTAL LIGHTS.

From all\nquarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the\nhigher levels. Racing-planes and digs alike have suffered severely--the\nformer from unequal deposits of half-frozen slush on their vans (and\nonly those who have \"held up\" a badly balanced plane in a cross wind\nknow what that means), and the latter from loaded bows and snow-cased\nbodies. As a consequence, the Northern and Northwestern upper levels\nhave been practically abandoned, and the high fliers have returned to\nthe ignoble security of the Three, Five, and Six hundred foot levels.\nBut there remain a few undaunted sun-hunters who, in spite of frozen\nstays and ice-jammed connecting-rods, still haunt the blue empyrean.\n\n\nBat-Boat Racing\n\nThe scandals of the past few years have at last moved the yachting world\nto concerted action in regard to \"bat\" boat racing.\n\nWe have been treated to the spectacle of what are practically keeled\nracing-planes driven a clear five foot or more above the water, and only\neased down to touch their so-called \"native element\" as they near the\nline. Judges and starters have been conveniently blind to this\nabsurdity, but the public demonstration off St. Catherine's Light at the\nAutumn Regattas has borne ample, if tardy, fruit. In future the \"bat\"\nis to be a boat, and the long-unheeded demand of the true sportsman for\n\"no daylight under mid-keel in smooth water\" is in a fair way to be\nconceded. The new rule severely restricts plane area and lift alike. The\ngas compartments are permitted both fore and aft, as in the old type,\nbut the water-ballast central tank is rendered obligatory. These things\nwork, if not for perfection, at least for the evolution of a sane and\nwholesome _waterborne_ cruiser. The type of rudder is unaffected by the\nnew rules, so we may expect to see the Long-Davidson make (the patent on\nwhich has just expired) come largely into use henceforward, though the\nstrain on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is\nadmittedly very severe. But bat-boat racing has a great future before\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCORRESPONDENCE\n\n\n\n\nCorrespondence\n\n\nSkylarking on the Equator\n\nTO THE EDITOR--Only last week, while crossing the Equator (W. 26.15), I\nbecame aware of a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or\ntwenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft. level, I found a party of\nTransylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest\npattern atmospheric bombs (A. B. C. standard) and, in the intervals of\ntheir pleasing labours, firing bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This\norgy--I can give it no other name--went on for at least two hours, and\nnaturally produced violent electric derangements. My compasses, of\ncourse, were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two\nbrisk shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told\nthat these \"professors\" were engaged in scientific experiments. The\nextent of their \"scientific\" knowledge may be judged by the fact that\nthey expected to produce (I give their own words) \"a little blue sky\" if\n\"they went on long enough.\" This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450\nfeet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place\n(it can be found at the 2,000 level for practically twelve months out of\nthe year), but I submit, with all deference to the educational needs of\nTransylvania, that \"sky-larking\" in the centre of a main-travelled road\nwhere, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off one's\nstanchions and screw blades, is unnecessary. When my friends had\nfinished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted with unequal\npressure-layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments for at least an\nhour. I pitched badly twice in an upward rush--solely due to these\ndiabolical throw-downs--that came near to wrecking my propeller.\nEquatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without\nthe added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.\n\n   Rhyl.                                    J. VINCENT MATHEWS.\n\n[We entirely sympathize with Professor Mathews's views, but unluckily\ntill the Board sees fit to further regulate the Southern areas in which\nscientific experiments may be conducted, we shall always be exposed to\nthe risk which our correspondent describes. Unfortunately, a chimera\nbombinating in a vacuum is, nowadays, only too capable of producing\nsecondary causes.--_Editor_.]\n\n\nAnswers to Correspondents\n\nVIGILANS--The Laws of Auroral Derangements are still imperfectly\nunderstood. Any overheated motor may of course \"seize\" without warning;\nbut so many complaints have reached us of accidents similar to yours\nwhile shooting the Aurora that we are inclined to believe with Lavalle\nthat the upper strata of the Aurora Borealis are practically one big\nelectric \"leak,\" and that the paralysis of your engines was due to\ncomplete magnetization of all metallic parts. Low-flying planes often\n\"glue up\" when near the Magnetic Pole, and there is no reason in science\nwhy the same disability should not be experienced at higher levels when\nthe Auroras are \"delivering\" strongly.\n\nINDIGNANT--On your own showing, you were not under control. That you\ncould not hoist the necessary N. U. C. lights on approaching a\ntraffic-lane because your electrics had short-circuited is a misfortune\nwhich might befall any one. The A. B. C., being responsible for the\nplanet's traffic, cannot, however, make allowance for this kind of\nmisfortune. A reference to the Code will show that you were fined on the\nlower scale.\n\nPLANISTON--(1) The Five Thousand Kilometre (overland) was won last year\nby L. V. Rautsch, R. M. Rautsch, his brother, in the same week pulling\noff the Ten Thousand (oversea). R. M.'s average worked out at a fraction\nover 500 kilometres per hour, thus constituting a record. (2)\nTheoretically, there is no limit to the lift of a dirigible. For\ncommercial and practical purposes 15,000 tons is accepted as the most\nmanageable.\n\nPATERFAMILIAS--None whatever. He is liable for direct damage both to\nyour chimneys and any collateral damage caused by fall of bricks into\ngarden, etc., etc. Bodily inconvenience and mental anguish may be\nincluded, but the average jury are not, as a rule, men of sentiment. If\nyou can prove that his grapnel removed _any_ portion of your roof, you\nhad better rest your case on decoverture of domicile (See Parkins _v_.\nDuboulay). We entirely sympathize with your position, but the night of\nthe 14th was stormy and confused, and--you may have to anchor on a\nstranger's chimney yourself some night. _Verbum sap!_\n\nALDEBARAN--War, as a paying concern, ceased in 1967. (2) The Convention\nof London expressly reserves to every nation the right of waging war so\nlong as it does not interfere with the world's traffic. (3) The A. B. C.\nwas constituted in 1949.\n\nL. M. D.--Keep her dead head-on at half-power, taking advantage of the\nlulls to speed up and creep into it. She will strain much less this way\nthan in quartering across a gale. (2) Nothing is to be gained by\nreversing into a following gale, and there is always risk of a\nturn-over. (3) The formul\u00e6 for stun'sle brakes are uniformly unreliable,\nand will continue to be so as long as air is compressible.\n\nPEGAMOID--Personally we prefer glass or flux compounds to any other\nmaterial for winter work nose-caps as being absolutely non-hygroscopic.\n(2) We cannot recommend any particular make.\n\nPULMONAR--For the symptoms you describe, try the Gobi Desert Sanitaria.\nThe low levels of the Saharan Sanitaria are against them except at the\noutset of the disease. (2) We do not recommend boarding-houses or hotels\nin this column.\n\nBEGINNER--On still days the air above a large inhabited city being\nslightly warmer--i. e., thinner--than the atmosphere of the surrounding\ncountry, a plane drops a little on entering the rarefied area, precisely\nas a ship sinks a little in fresh water. Hence the phenomena of \"jolt\"\nand your \"inexplicable collisions\" with factory chimneys. In air, as on\nearth, it is safest to fly high.\n\nEMERGENCY--There is only one rule of the road in air, earth, and water.\nDo you want the firmament to yourself?\n\nPICCIOLA--Both Poles have been overdone in Art and Literature. Leave\nthem to Science for the next twenty years. You did not send a stamp with\nyour verses.\n\nNORTH NIGERIA--The Mark Boat was within her right in warning you up on\nthe Reserve. The shadow of a low-flying dirigible scares the game. You\ncan buy all the photos you need at Sokoto.\n\nNEW ERA--It is not etiquette to overcross an A. B. C. official's boat\nwithout asking permission. He is one of the body responsible for the\nplanet's traffic, and for that reason must not be interfered with. You,\npresumably, are out on your own business or pleasure, and should leave\nhim alone. For humanity's sake don't try to be \"democratic.\"\n\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nThe Life of Xavier Lavalle\n\n(_Reviewed by R\u00e9n\u00e9 Talland. \u00c9cole A\u00ebronautique, Paris_)\n\nTen years ago Lavalle, \"that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens,\" as\nLazareff hailed him, gathered together the fruits of a lifetime's\nlabour, and gave it, with well-justified contempt, to a world bound hand\nand foot to Barald's Theory of Vertices and \"compensating electric\nnodes.\" \"They shall see,\" he wrote--in that immortal postscript to \"The\nHeart of the Cyclone\"--\"the Laws whose existence they derided written in\nfire _beneath_ them.\"\n\n\"But even here,\" he continues, \"there is no finality. Better a thousand\ntimes my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should\nlie across the threshold of the temple of Science--a bar to further\ninquiry.\"\n\nSo died Lavalle--a prince of the Powers of the Air, and even at his\nfuneral C\u00e9llier jested at \"him who had gone to discover the secrets of\nthe Aurora Borealis.\"\n\nIf I choose thus to be banal, it is only to remind you that C\u00e9llier's\ntheories are to-day as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the\nSpanish school. In the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we\nhave, definitely, Lavalle's Law of the Cyclone which he surprised in\ndarkness and cold at the foot of the overarching throne of the Aurora\nBorealis. It is there that I, intent on my own investigations, have\npassed and re-passed a hundred times the worn leonine face, white as the\nsnow beneath him, furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and gashes upon\nthe North Cape; the nervous hand, integrally a part of the mechanism of\nhis flighter; and above all, the wonderful lambent eyes turned to the\nzenith.\n\n\"Master,\" I would cry as I moved respectfully beneath him, \"what is it\nyou seek to-day?\" and always the answer, clear and without doubt, from\nabove: \"The old secret, my son!\"\n\nThe immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path, but (cry of the\nhuman always!) had I known--if I had known--I would many times have\nbartered my poor laurels for the privilege, such as Tinsley and Herrera\npossess, of having aided him in his monumental researches.\n\nIt is to the filial piety of Victor Lavalle that we owe the two volumes\nconsecrated to the ground-life of his father, so full of the holy\nintimacies of the domestic hearth. Once returned from the abysms of the\nutter North to that little house upon the outskirts of Meudon, it was\nnot the philosopher, the daring observer, the man of iron energy that\nimposed himself on his family, but a fat and even plaintive jester, a\nfarceur incarnate and kindly, the co-equal of his children, and, it must\nbe written, not seldom the comic despair of Madame Lavalle, who, as she\nwrites five years after the marriage, to her venerable mother, found \"in\nthis unequalled intellect whose name I bear the abandon of a large and\nvery untidy boy.\" Here is her letter:\n\n\"Xavier returned from I do not know where at midnight, absorbed in\ncalculations on the eternal question of his Aurora--_la belle Aurore_,\nwhom I begin to hate. Instead of anchoring--I had set out the\nguide-light above our roof, so he had but to descend and fasten the\nplane--he wandered, profoundly distracted, above the town with his\nanchor down! Figure to yourself, dear mother, it is the roof of the\nmayor's house that the grapnel first engages! That I do not regret, for\nthe mayor's wife and I are not sympathetic; but when Xavier uproots my\npet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the conservatory I\nprotest at the top of my voice. Little Victor in his night-clothes runs\nto the window, enormously amused at the parabolic flight without reason,\nfor it is too dark to see the grapnel, of my prized tree. The Mayor of\nMeudon thunders at our door in the name of the Law, demanding, I\nsuppose, my husband's head. Here is the conversation through the\nmegaphone--Xavier is two hundred feet above us.\n\n\"'Mons. Lavalle, descend and make reparation for outrage of domicile.\nDescend, Mons. Lavalle!'\n\n\"No one answers.\n\n\"'Xavier Lavalle, in the name of the Law, descend and submit to process\nfor outrage of domicile.'\n\n\"Xavier, roused from his calculations, only comprehending the last\nwords: 'Outrage of domicile? My dear mayor, who is the man that has\ncorrupted thy Julie?'\n\n\"The mayor, furious, 'Xavier Lavalle----'\n\n\"Xavier, interrupting: 'I have not that felicity. I am only a dealer in\ncyclones!'\n\n\"My faith, he raised one then! All Meudon attended in the streets, and\nmy Xavier, after a long time comprehending what he had done, excused\nhimself in a thousand apologies. At last the reconciliation was effected\nin our house over a supper at two in the morning--Julie in a wonderful\ncostume of compromises, and I have her and the mayor pacified in beds in\nthe blue room.\"\n\nAnd on the next day, while the mayor rebuilds his roof, her Xavier\ndeparts anew for the Aurora Borealis, there to commence his life's\nwork. M. Victor Lavalle tells us of that historic collision (_en plane_)\non the flank of Hecla between Herrera, then a pillar of the Spanish\nschool, and the man destined to confute his theories and lead him\nintellectually captive. Even through the years, the immense laugh of\nLavalle as he sustains the Spaniard's wrecked plane, and cries:\n\"Courage! _I_ shall not fall till I have found Truth, and I hold _you_\nfast!\" rings like the call of trumpets. This is that Lavalle whom the\nworld, immersed in speculations of immediate gain, did not know nor\nsuspect--the Lavalle whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a\ntheorist.\n\nThe human, as apart from the scientific, side (developed in his own\nvolumes) of his epoch-making discoveries is marked with a simplicity,\nclarity, and good sense beyond praise. I would specially refer such as\ndoubt the sustaining influence of ancestral faith upon character and\nwill to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters, in which are contained the\nopening and consummation of the Tellurionical Records extending over\nnine years. Of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest\nhouse at Meudon knew as little as that the Records would one day be the\nworld's standard in all official meteorology. It was enough for them\nthat their Xavier--this son, this father, this husband--ascended\nperiodically to commune with powers, it might be angelic, beyond their\ncomprehension, and that they united daily in prayers for his safety.\n\n\"Pray for me,\" he says upon the eve of each of his excursions, and\nreturning, with an equal simplicity, he renders thanks \"after supper in\nthe little room where he kept his barometers.\"\n\nTo the last Lavalle was a Catholic of the old school, accepting--he who\nhad looked into the very heart of the lightnings--the dogmas of papal\ninfallibility, of absolution, of confession--of relics great and small.\nMarvellous--enviable contradiction!\n\nThe completion of the Tellurionical Records closed what Lavalle himself\nwas pleased to call the theoretical side of his labours--labours from\nwhich the youngest and least impressionable planeur might well have\nshrunk. He had traced through cold and heat, across the deeps of the\noceans, with instruments of his own invention, over the inhospitable\nheart of the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts, league by\nleague, patiently, unweariedly, remorselessly, from their ever-shifting\ncradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted death-bed in the utmost\nether of the upper atmosphere--each one of the Isoconical\nTellurions--Lavalle's Curves, as we call them to-day. He had\ndisentangled the nodes of their intersections, assigning to each its\nregulated period of flux and reflux. Thus equipped, he summons Herrera\nand Tinsley, his pupils, to the final demonstration as calmly as though\nhe were ordering his flighter for some midday journey to Marseilles.\n\n\"I have proved my thesis,\" he writes. \"It remains now only that you\nshould witness the proof. We go to Manila to-morrow. A cyclone will form\noff the Pescadores S. 17 E. in four days, and will reach its maximum\nintensity in twenty-seven hours after inception. It is there I will show\nyou the Truth.\"\n\nA letter heretofore unpublished from Herrera to Madame Lavalle tells us\nhow the Master's prophecy was verified.\n\n   (_To be continued_.)\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISING SECTION\n\n\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n\nWANTS\n\nRequired immediately, for East Africa, a thoroughly competent Plane and\nDirigible Driver, acquainted with Petrol Radium and Helium motors and\ngenerators.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
