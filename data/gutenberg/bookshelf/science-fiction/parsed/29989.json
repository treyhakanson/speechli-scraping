PEACE\n\n                        THE OUTBREAK OF PEACE\n\n\n\n                            By H. B. FYFE\n\n\n                      Illustrated by van Dongen\n\n\n        _When properly conducted, a diplomatic mission can turn the\n         most smashing of battle-successes into a fabulous Pyrrhic\n         victory._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great pity, Space Marshal Wilbur Hennings reflected, as he\ngazed through the one-way glass of the balcony door, that the local\ncitizens had insisted upon decorating the square before their capitol\nwith the hulk of the first spaceship ever to have landed on Pollux V.\n\nA hundred and fifty years probably seemed impressive to them, amid the\nexplosive spread of Terran colonies and federations. Actually, in the\nmarshal's opinion, it was merely long enough to reveal such symbols as\nmore than antiquated but less than historically precious.\n\n\"I presume you plan to have me march past that heap!\" he complained,\ntugging at the extremely \"historical\" sword that completed the effect\nof his dazzling white and gold uniform.\n\nCommodore Miller, his aide, stiffened nervously.\n\n\"Around to the right of it, sir,\" he gestured. \"As you see, the local\nmilitary are already keeping the route clear of onlookers. We thought\nit would be most impressive if your party were to descend the outer\nstairway from the palace balcony here ... to heighten the importance\nof--\"\n\n\"To draw out the pomp and circumstance of opening the conference?\"\n\n\"Well, sir ... and then across the square to the conference hall of\nthe capitol, outside which you will pause for a few gracious words to\nthe crowd--\"\n\n\"And that will probably be my last opportunity to enjoy the morning\nsunlight. Oh, well, it seems much too bright here in any case.\"\n\nThe commodore absently reached out to adjust a fold of his chief's\nsky-blue sash, and the marshal as absently parried the gesture.\n\n\"I shall be hardly less than half an hour crossing the square,\" he\npredicted sourly. \"With the cheering throngs they have undoubtedly\narranged, and the sunlight reflecting from all that imitation marble,\nit will be no place to collect one's thoughts.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned back to the huge chamber constituting the \"office\" of the\nsuite supplied by his Polluxian hosts. The skeleton staff of men and\nwomen remaining occupied chairs and benches along only one wall, since\nthe bulk of the delegation had been sent out to make themselves\npopular with the local populace.\n\nHennings presumed the bulk of the local populace to consist of\nPolluxians assigned to making themselves popular with his Ursan\nFederation delegation. His people would be listening politely to\nmyriad reasons why the Polluxians had a natural right to occupy all\nthe star systems from here to Castor, a dozen light-years farther\nfrom Terra. No one would mention the true motive--their illogical\nchoice in naming themselves the Twin Empire.\n\n\"Well, now!\" he said crisply. \"Once more over the main points of the\nsituation! No, commodore, not the schedule of experts that will\naccompany me to the table; I rely upon you to have perfected that. But\nhave there been any unforeseen developments in the actual fighting?\"\n\nA cluster of aides, mostly in uniform but including a few in\ndiscreetly elegant civilian attire, moved forward. Each was somehow\nfollowed within arm's reach by an aide of his own, so that the advance\npresented overtones of a small sortie.\n\nHennings first nodded to the first, a youngish man whose air suggested\ntechnical competence more than the assurance of great authority. The\nofficer placed his brief case upon the glistening surface of a large\ntable and touched a switch on the flap.\n\n\"It's as well to be sure, sir,\" the commodore approved. \"Our men have\nbeen unable to detect any devices, but the walls may have ears.\"\n\n\"They won't scan through this scrambler, sir,\" asserted the young\nofficer.\n\nHennings accepted a seat at the table and looked up to one of the\nothers.\n\n\"Mirelli's Star,\" an older officer reported briskly. \"The same\nsituation prevails, with both sides having landed surface troops in\nforce on Mirelli II, Mirelli III, and Mirelli V, the fourth planet\nbeing inhabited by a partly civilized, nonhuman race protected under\nthe Terran Convention.\"\n\n\"Recent engagements?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Maneuvering continues, but actual encounters have declined\nin frequency. Casualties are modest and evenly matched. General\nNilssen on Mirelli III continues to receive Polluxian agents seeking\nhis defection.\"\n\n\"I never thought to ask,\" murmured Hennings. \"Is he really a distant\nconnection of the Polluxian Nilssen family?\"\n\n\"It is improbable, sir, but they are polite enough to accept the\npretense. Of course, he rejects every offer in a very high-minded\nmanner, and seems to be making an adequate impression of chivalry.\"\n\nHe stepped back at Henning's nod, to be replaced by another officer.\n\n\"One minor space skirmish in the Agohki system to report, sir. The\nadmiral in command appears to have recouped after the error of two\ndays ago, when that Polluxian detachment was so badly mauled. He\narranged the capture of three of our cruisers.\"\n\n\"Was that not a trifle rash?\" demanded Hennings.\n\n\"Intelligence is inclined to think not, sir. The ships were armed only\nwith weapons listed as general knowledge items. The crews were not\nonly trained in prisoner-of-war tactics, but also well supplied with\nsmall luxuries. The Polluxian fleet in that system is known to have\nbeen in space for several months, so a friendly effect is\nanticipated.\"\n\nHennings considered the condensed report proffered for his perusal. He\nnoted that the Polluxians had been quite gentlemanly about notifying\nUrsan headquarters of the capture and of the complete lack of\ncasualties. He also saw that while the message was ostensibly directed\nto the Federation flagship, it had been beamed in such fashion as to\nbe conveniently intercepted at the secret Ursan Federation\nheadquarters on Agohki VII.\n\n\"That was a bit rude of them,\" he commented. \"We have never dragged\ntheir secrets into the open.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, sir,\" the commodore suggested, \"it may be an\nalmost sophisticated method of permitting us to enjoy our superior\nfinesse.\"\n\n\"I am just as pleased to have the reminder,\" said Hennings. \"It will\nserve to alert us all the more when we sit down with them over there.\"\n\nAn elegant civilian, a large man with patient, drooping features,\nstated that nothing had occurred to change the economic situation.\nAnother reported that unofficial channels of information were holding\nup as well as could be expected. A uniformed officer summarized the\nbattle situation in two more star systems.\n\n\"Those are positions we actually desire to hold, are they not?\"\nHennings asked. \"Is action to be taken there?\"\n\n\"Plans call for local civilian riots at the height of the conference,\nsir.\"\n\n\"But ... can we lay no groundwork sooner than that? Sometime in the\nforeseeable future, at least! Take it up with Propaganda, Blauvelt! It\nseems to me that the briefing mentioned an indigenous race on one of\nthese planets--\"\n\nBlauvelt dropped his eyes momentarily, equivalent in that gathering to\na blush of intense embarrassment. Hennings coughed apologetically.\n\n\"Well, now, I should not pry into arrangements I must later be able to\ndeny convincingly with a clear conscience. I can only plead, my dear\nBlauvelt, the tenseness of the past several days.\"\n\nThe officer murmured inaudibly, fumbled with his papers, and edged to\nthe rear rank. Someone, at Commodore Miller's fluttering, obtained a\nvacuum jug of ice water and a glass for the marshal, but Hennings\nchose instead to produce a long cigar from a pocket concealed beneath\nhis resplendent collection of medals.\n\n\"My apologies to all of you,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I fear that any\nof you who may expect contact with the local population had better see\nDr. Ibn Talal about the hypnosis necessary to counteract my little\nindiscretion. And now--what remains?\"\n\n\"Nothing but the prisoner exchange, sir,\" Commodore Miller announced\nafter collecting the eyes of the principal officers.\n\nHennings got his cigar going. He listened to confirmation of a\nprevious report that a massive exchange of \"sick and wounded\"\nprisoners had been accomplished, and learned that the Ursans now\nsuspected that they had accepted unknowingly about as many secret\nagents as they had sent the Polluxians.\n\n\"Oh, well!\" he sighed. \"As long as the amenities were preserved! We\nmust be as friendly as possible about that sort of thing, or run the\nrisk of antagonizing them.\"\n\nSeeing that the commodore was tense with impatience, the marshal rose\nto his feet. An aide deftly received the cigar for disposal, and the\nparty drifted expectantly toward the balcony doors.\n\nFrom among that part of the staff which would remain to man\nheadquarters, an officer was dispatched to alert the Polluxian honor\nguard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_One more touch before the die is cast_, thought the marshal, as two\nyoung officers opened the balcony doors to admit the blare of\ntrumpets.\n\nCheers rolled successively across the square, rising like distant\nwaves from somewhere beneath the gigantic banner that draped the\ncapitol opposite with fiery letters spelling out \"PEACE CONFERENCE.\"\n\nWith a dramatic gesture, Hennings held up the sheaf of reports they\nhad just reviewed. Smiles disappeared in response to his own serious\nmien.\n\n\"So much for the hostilities!\" he snapped. He tossed the reports to\nthe officer who would remain in charge. \"_Now for the actual war!_\"\n\nPivoting on his heel, he led them smartly out to the ornate balcony\nstairway that curved down into the sea of cheering Polluxians.\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Outbreak of Peace, by Horace Brown Fyfe\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE OUTBREAK OF PEACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29989.txt or 29989.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/9/8/29989/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
