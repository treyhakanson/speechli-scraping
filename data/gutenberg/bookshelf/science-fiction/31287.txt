     _Every era in history has had its Pop Ganlon's. Along in
      years and not successful and not caring much anyway. A
      matter of living out their years, following an obscure path
      to oblivion._

     _It was that way in ancient Egypt, just as it will be when
      the Solar System shrinks to our size. And once in a while
      such men are given an opportunity to contribute to the
      society that has forgotten them...._

       *       *       *       *       *




Pop Ganlon was no hero--he was only a spaceman. A spaceman and a
father. In fact, Pop was rather no-account, even in a profession that
abounded with drifters. He had made a meagre living prospecting
asteroids and hauling light freight and an occasional passenger out
in the Belt Region. Coffee and cakes, nothing more. Not many people
knew Pop had a son in the Patrol, and even fewer knew it when the boy
was blasted to a cinder in a back alley in Lower Marsport.

Pop went on eating and breathing, but his life was over after that. He
hit the bottle a little harder and his ship, _The Luck_, grew rustier
and tackier, and those were the only outward signs that Pop Ganlon was
a living dead man. He kept on grubbing among the cold rocks and
pushing _The Luck_ from Marsport to Callisto and back with whatever
low-mass payloads he could pick up. He might have lived out his string
of years like that, obscure and alone, if it hadn't been for John
Kane. Kane was Pop Ganlon's ticket to a sort of personal
immortality--if there is such a thing for an old spaceman.

It was in Yakki, down-canal from Marsport, that Kane found Pop. There
is a small spaceport there--a boneyard, really--for buckets whose
skippers can't pay the heavy tariff imposed by the big ramp. All the
wrecks nest there while waiting hopefully for a payload or a
grubstake. They have all of Solis Lacus for a landing field, and if
they spill it doesn't matter much. The drifting red sands soon cover
up the scattered shards of dural and the slow, lonely life of Yakki
goes on like before.

The Patrol was on Kane's trail and the blaster in his hand was still
warm when he shoved it up against Pop Ganlon's ribs and made his
proposition.

He wanted to get off Mars--out to Callisto. To Blackwater, to Ley's
Landing, it didn't matter too much. Just off Mars, and quickly. His
eyes had a metallic glitter and his hand was rock-steady. Pop knew he
meant what he said when he told him life was cheap. Someone else's
life, not Kane's.

       *       *       *       *       *

That's how it happened that _The Luck_ lifted that night from Yakki,
outward bound for Ley's Landing, with Pop and Kane aboard her alone.

Sitting at the battered console of _The Luck_, Pop watched his
passenger. He knew Kane, of course. Or rather, he knew of him. A
killer. The kind that thrives and grows fat on the frontiers. The
bulky frame, the cropped black hair, the predatory eyes that looked
like two blaster muzzles. They were all familiar to Pop. Kane was all
steel and meanness. The kind of carrion bird that took what others had
worked for. Not big time, you understand. In another age he'd have
been a torpedo--a hireling killer. But out among the stars he was
working for himself. And doing well.

Pop didn't care. His loyalty to the Patrol had stopped quite suddenly
not long before--in a dark alley in Lower Marsport. This was only a
job, he told himself now. A job for coffee and cakes, and maybe a
grubstake to work a few more lonely rocks. Life had become a habit for
Pop, even if living had ended.

"What are you staring at, Pop?" Kane's voice was like the rest of him.
Harsh and cold as space itself.

"At you, I guess," Pop said, "I was wondering what you'd done--and
where--and to whom."

"You're a nosey old man," Kane said. "Just get me to Ley's Landing.
That's what I'm paying for, not a thing more."

Pop nodded slowly and turned back to the control board. They were
above the Belt by now, and a few short hours from turnover point. The
cranky drives of _The Luck_ needed all his attention.

Presently he said, "We'll be turning over soon. Want to get some
rest?"

Kane laughed. "No thanks, old man. I'll stay here and watch you."

Pop eyed the ready blaster and nodded again. He wondered vaguely how
it would feel to die under the blast of such a weapon. It couldn't be
very painful. He hoped it wasn't painful. Perhaps the boy hadn't
suffered. It would be nice to be sure, he thought.

There wasn't much for Pop to remember about the boy. He'd never been
one for writing many letters. But the District Patrolman had come down
to Yakki and looked Pop up--afterward. He'd said the boy was a good
officer. A good cop. Died doing his job, and all that sort of thing.
Pop swallowed hard. His job. What had 'his job' been that night in
Lower Marsport, he wondered. Had someone else finished it for him?

He remembered about that time hearing on the Mars Radio that a
Triangle Post Office had been knocked over by a gunman. That might
have been it. The Patrol would be after anyone knocking over EMV
Triangle property. The Earth-Mars-Venus Government supported the
Patrol for things like that.

Pop guided _The Luck_ skillfully above the Belt, avoiding with
practiced ease the few errant chunks of rock that hurtled up out of
the swarms. He talked to Kane because he was starved for
talk--certainly not because he was trying to play Sherlock. Pop had
long ago realized that he was no mental giant. Besides, he owed the
Patrol nothing. Not a damned thing.

"Made this trip often?" Pop tried to strike up a conversation with
Kane. His long loneliness seemed sharper, somehow, more poignant,
when he actually had someone to talk to.

"Not often. I'm no space pig." It was said with scorn.

"There's a lot to spacing, you know," Pop urged.

Kane shrugged. "I know easier ways to make a buck, old timer."

"Like how?"

"A nosey old man, like I said," Kane smiled. Somehow, the smile wasn't
friendly. "Okay, Pop, since you ask. Like knocking off wacky old
prospectors for their dust. Or sticking up sandcar caravans out in
Syrtis. Who's the wiser? The red dust takes care of the leftovers."

Pop shook his head. "Not for me. There's the Patrol to think of."

Kane laughed. "Punks. Bell-boys. They'd better learn to shoot before
they leave their school-books."

Pop Ganlon frowned slightly. "You talk big, mister."

Kane's eyes took on that metallic glitter again. He leaned forward and
threw a canvas packet on the console. It spilled crisp new EMV
certificates. Large ones. "I take big, too," he said.

Pop stared. Not at the money. It was more than he had ever seen in one
pile before, but it wasn't that that shook him. It was the canvas
packet. It was marked: _Postal Service, EMV_. Pop suddenly felt cold,
as though an icy wind had touched him.

"You ... you killed a Patrolman for this," he said slowly.

"That's right, Pop," grinned Kane easily. "Burned him down in an alley
in Lower Marsport. It was like taking candy from a baby...."

Pop Ganlon swallowed hard. "Like taking candy from a ... baby. As easy
as that...."

"As easy as that, old man," Kane said.

       *       *       *       *       *

Pop knew he was going to die then. He knew Kane would blast him right
after turnover point, and he knew fear. He felt something else, too.
Something that was new to him. Hate. An icy hate that left him shaken
and weak.

So the boy's job hadn't been finished. It was still to do.

There was no use in dreaming of killing Kane. Pop was old. Kane was
young--and a killer. Pop was alone and without weapons--save _The
Luck_....

Time passed slowly. Outside, the night of deep space keened
soundlessly. The stars burned bright, alien and strange. It was time,
thought Pop bleakly. Time to turn _The Luck_.

"Turnover point," he said softly.

Kane motioned with his blaster. "Get at it."

Pop began winding the flywheel. It made a whirring sound in the
confined space of the tiny control room. Outside, the night began to
pivot slowly.

"We have to turn end-for-end," Pop said. "That way we can decelerate
on the drop into Callisto. But, of course, you know all about that,
Mr. Kane."

"I told you I'm no space pig," Kane said brusquely. "I can handle a
landing and maybe a takeoff, but the rest of it I leave for the
boatmen. Like you, Pop."

Pop spun the flywheel in silence, listening to the soft whir.
Presently, he let the wheel slow and then stop. He straightened and
looked up at Kane. The blaster muzzle was six inches from his belly.
He swallowed against the dryness in his throat.

"You ... you're going to kill me," Pop said. It wasn't a question.
Kane smiled, showing white teeth.

"I ... I know you are," Pop said unsteadily. "But first, I want to say
something to you."

"Talk, old timer," Kane said. "But not too much."

"That boy--that boy you killed in Marsport. He was my son," Pop said.

Kane's face did not change expression. "Okay. So what?"

Pop's lips twitched. "I just wanted to hear you say it." He looked at
the impassive face of the killer. "You made a mistake, Mr. Kane. You
shouldn't have done that to my boy."

"Is that all?"

Pop nodded slowly. "I guess that's all."

Kane grinned. "Afraid, old man?"

"I'm a space pig," Pop said. "Space takes care of its own."

"You're in a bad way, old timer," Kane said, "and you haven't much
sense. I'm doing you a favor."

Pop lifted his hands in an instinctive gesture of futile protection as
the blaster erupted flame.

There was a smell in the control room like burnt meat as Kane
holstered his weapon and turned the old man over with a foot. Pop was
a blackened mass. Kane dragged him to the valve and jettisoned the
body into space.

       *       *       *       *       *

Alone among the stars, _The Luck_ moved across the velvet night. The
steady beat of flame from her tubes was a tiny spark of man-made
vengeance on the face of the deeps.

From her turnover point, she drove outward toward the spinning Jovian
moons. For a short while she could be seen from the EMV Observatory on
Callisto, but very soon she faded into the outer darkness.

Much later, the Observatory at Land's End on Triton watched her
heading past the gibbous mass of Pluto--out into the interstellar
fastnesses.

The thrumming of the jets was still at last. A wild-eyed thing that
may once have been a man stared in horror at the fading light of the
yellow star far astern.

It had taken Kane time to understand what had happened to him, and now
it was too late. Space had taken care of its own. The air in _The
Luck_ was growing foul and the food was gone. Death hung in the fetid
atmosphere of the tiny control room.

The old man--the boy--the money. They all seemed to spin in a
narrowing circle. Kane wanted suddenly to shriek with laughter. A
circle. The turnover circle. The full circle that the old man had made
instead of the proper half-turn of a turnover. Three hundred sixty
degrees instead of one hundred eighty. Three hundred sixty degrees to
leave the nose of _The Luck_ pointing outward toward the stars,
instead of properly toward the Sun. A full circle to pile G on G until
the Jovian moons were missed, and the Uranian moons and Triton, too.
_Ad Astra per Ardua...._

With the last fragment of his failing sanity, Kane thought of how Pop
Ganlon and the boy must be laughing. He was still thinking that as the
long night closed in around him.

       *       *       *       *       *

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
