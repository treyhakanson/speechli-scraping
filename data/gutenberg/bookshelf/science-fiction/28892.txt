    _We can anticipate that robots will be fiercely resented, at first,
    in a society that will see them as the latest--and an
    indestructible--widespread threat to the workers whom they will
    replace. The men who will seek to alter the status quo will be
    called "robot lovers" and stoned. But what happens next?_


 benefactor

 _by ... George H. Smith_


 He clutched at the lever with more force than he'd
 intended. It was set for further in the future....


"They're crazy! They're insane! That mob outside is made up of madmen,"
Jacob Clark told his young assistant, Bill Towney.

"They'll be battering at the door any minute now, sir," Towney said
nervously.

"But why? Why are they doing it? My inventions have advanced the world a
hundred years. I've always been a benefactor of man, not a destroyer."

"It's the robots. People are in a rage because they say the robots cause
unemployment by replacing workers."

"It's utter nonsense, you know," Clark said impatiently. "Why can't they
see that my intelligent, self-controlled robots are the greatest boon
the human race has ever received from one man?"

"I don't know, sir, but they don't." Towney paused as the shouting and
pounding outside became more intense. "They demanded that you take the
robots out of the labor market and order your factories to stop making
them. This is the result of your refusal."

"DOWN WITH CLARK! DOWN WITH THE TIN MEN! DEATH TO THE ROBOT LOVERS!"
The furious mob was battering at the door now.

"Really, sir," Towney said, "you should leave here. They'll kill you if
you don't!"

"Leave here? I should say not. I'll defy the fools. I'll tell them what
I've done for them and make them understand." He glanced nervously at
the door. "Besides there's only one door. I couldn't get away now."

"There's the time machine, sir."

"But isn't there some other way? Perhaps if you went out and talked to
them...."

"You know there's no other way. Those people believe you've brought
disaster to the human race and they mean to kill you. And if you don't
hurry they will," Towney said urgently. "The time machine is set for
twenty years in the future. Please hurry, sir!"

The door was beginning to give. Clark looked around unhappily and then
walked to the time machine. "All right, I'll go. In the future I know
the results of my work will be appreciated. I'll be a hero and
benefactor of mankind."

Towney heard the door crash and roughly pushed his employer into the
time machine as the mob burst through. "Push the starting button, push
the starting button. Quick!" he screamed as the first of the mob reached
him.

Clark's hand leaped to the control lever just as a brick crashed into
his head. His hand completed its motion with more force than he had
intended as he sank unconscious to the floor and the machine was set for
a thousand years in the future instead of twenty.

       *       *       *       *       *

The year three thousand had been a brilliant one for the robots, in
fact, the most brilliant since the last human being had died some five
hundred years before. They had reached Venus and Mars and were now
planning a trip to Jupiter. And this very day, a huge statue of Jacob
Clark, the creator and benefactor, was to be dedicated on the site of
what once had been his laboratory. It seemed a shame that most of the
records concerning him and his time had been lost in one of the great
wars that had helped to extinguish the humans. The statue though was
good for surely he looked like a robot. One of the few human books still
in existence said that the Creator had created in his own image.

It was right at the foot of his own statue that the Guardians of the
Shrine found Jacob Clark. They picked up his unconscious, bleeding body
and laid it tenderly on a nearby bench. They bent over him with all the
gentleness and solicitude that had been installed in his very first
models and had been handed down from generation to generation of robots.
They wanted to help him but they were very puzzled.

"Perhaps it came from a far part of the earth," one of them said.

"Or maybe a mistake was made at one of the birth factories," said
another. "See, it is losing oil at a great rate."

"Perhaps," mused the elder, "it is a new model. At any rate it is a
robot and has been damaged. As our great creator taught us, he must be
aided. We will take it to the central repair factory in the city."

"But," the first robot protested, "it's awfully bulky to be carried so
far."

Being creatures of logic, they thought about it for a moment and then
the elder came to a decision that was both effective and reasonable.

"Since he is so bulky, we will disassemble him for transportation
purposes," he said as he leaned over and gently twisted off Clark's
right arm.

"Rather primitive and messy construction, I'd say," said the second
robot as he tenderly unscrewed Jacob Clark's head from his body.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
