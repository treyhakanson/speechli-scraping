FIELD TRIP

By Gene Hunter


Kial was disgusted with the slow, cumbersome train. He disliked using
this uncomfortable means of travel, but since he wanted to learn more
about these strange creatures who were his ancestors, he had decided to
try to become used to their ways.

He was lonely in this strange, backward age and when he unexpectedly saw
another being like himself in the same coach, he hastened to make his
presence known. He introduced himself and asked politely:

"When are _you_ from?"

"8000," the other replied. "Name's Broyk, from VII Galaxy."

"I'm from out XIX way myself," Kial said. "Just a country boy. But
8000--that's only a period ahead of my own time. Maybe you could tell
me ..."

"Ah, ah!" the other admonished. "Remember the First Law of Thek!"

"Oh, Center," Kial grumbled. "I know: 'One may not divulge any
scientific, technical or social information to anyone from his own past
whom he may meet at an equidistant point in a Thek-travel.' I forgot."

"Bad," Broyk said. Then he added, almost jokingly: "You wouldn't want to
be marooned in this dismal era, would you?"

Kial shuddered. "Of course not. But the Laws seem so ridiculous."

"Not a bit," Broyk said, warming up to the subject. "It's very simple,
really. Same principle that doesn't allow anyone to Thek-travel into the
future.

"Look. I'm from 8000. Say that I went into 12,000, where I memorized as
much information as I could on some subject such as medicine. So I
return to 8000, retaining all such knowledge in my mind that's been
learned in four periods. Therefore, I'd have knowledge that wasn't
dreamed of in my own time, but was discovered sometime during the next
four periods. But then it couldn't be discovered, because I'd brought
it back to 8000 and--well, I'm no Logician, but you see my point."

"Oh, it's reasonable, I suppose," Kial admitted. "I realize the Laws are
really for our own good. By the way--I'm here on a field trip to gather
material for my thesis on Advanced Therapeutical Psychology and its
development since the Twentieth Century. What phase of this era are you
here to study?"

"I--I'm afraid I couldn't tell you that," Broyk said. "It's of rather a
secret nature and ..."

"You mean we might violate a Law and be stuck here for good--is that
it?"

"Yes--in a way."

Frightened, Kial let the matter drop. His gaze wandered through the
coach, examining the other passengers with interest. As time-travelers
from a different space-time plane from their 20th Century ancestors, he
and Broyk were naturally invisible to their fellow travelers.

Two pompous old gentlemen were lighting cigars and Kial was about to
remark on the habit of smoking when he noticed an even more remarkable
phenomenon. A few seats ahead of them sat a good-looking young couple,
oblivious to others about them.

"Look!" Kial cried excitedly. "Lovers! Honeymooners! I've read about
such things! Isn't it disgusting?"

"Oh, I don't know," Broyk said, a little wistfully. "I sometimes think
it was a mistake for Center to do away with sex. It must have been
interesting."

"Atavist!" Kial snapped in horror.

Had his people's emotional make-up provided for blushing, Kial would
undoubtedly have turned beet-red. Broyk's words had caused him acute
embarrassment.

       *       *       *       *       *

As he sat reflecting upon his strange companion, he suddenly began to
feel a sensation he had often heard about but never before had
experienced. Terror and dismay filled him as he sought to throw off the
probing finger that was penetrating his mind.

He looked at Broyk. There was the faintest notion of a smile on the
other's face as he said: "Yes, Kial--I am a Telepath."

Kial's mind reeled. He felt himself on the brink of some gigantic abyss
and then, as suddenly as it had come, the searching sensation faded
away.

"Since you are unable to enter my mind," Broyk said calmly, "it's only
fair that I tell you about myself. You were right--I'm an atavist. Even
in period 8000, such things can happen. Always such creatures are
destroyed after their first psychotests, but my case was different.
The Controller who bred me was only a dabbler in such things. I
was a failure, but he took a fancy to me. I was allowed to mature
secretly--few people knew of my existence. When I reached my majority my
presence became dangerous and I was sent back into time to try and find
the proper place for myself. And I think I've found it--here!"

Kial was a very amazed young man. "But such a barbarous age," he
complained. "Sex and atom bombs and everything ..."

"Remember," Broyk smiled, "these people are the forebears of the
geniuses who created Center and the Galactic Empire. They'll survive,
despite their barbarism. The existence of Center is proof."

"It's rather horrible to contemplate," Kial said thoughtfully, calmer
now, "and yet, this might really be a great age. In a way I almost envy
you."

"Of course you do," Broyk said. "You have certain tendencies--they
bother you, although you manage to hide them well. I discovered them
when I took the liberty of telepathing you. Artificial Genetics isn't
perfect, even in our time--perhaps because we originally sprang from
man. Perhaps we'll never be quite perfect, because of that, even after
thousands of periods of breeding."

Kial took another look at the loving young couple. "It--it might be fun,
after all."

Broyk laughed. "You needn't envy me at all, you know."

Kial frowned.

"I'm telling you about myself," Broyk went on, "I have also told you of
a specific condition existing a period ahead of your own time. Remember
the First Law?"

"Center!"

"We're marooned in the Twentieth Century. You have to accept it."

"But what will we _do_?" Kial's mind was reeling again.

"Since we've already broken the First Law," Broyk said, "we may just as
well break the Second: 'No Thek-traveler may enter the body of a native
of a foreign space-time ...'"

       *       *       *       *       *

The young lovers kissed again and this time there seemed to be an added
zest, even to their passionate embrace.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
