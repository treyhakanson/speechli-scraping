             It could be deadly. It had to be tested. But
             Sales wanted a new product this very minute.


Amos Parry, a regional manager for Whelan, Inc. (Farm & Ranch Chemicals
& Feeds), had come to work a few minutes early and was waiting in the
lab when Frank Barnes arrived. He saw that the division's chief chemist
was even more nervous than usual, so he invested a few minutes in
soothing small talk before saying, "Frank, Sales is beginning to push
for that new hormone."

Immediately, Barnes came unsoothed. "Bill Detrick was on the phone
about it yesterday, Mr. Parry. I'm sorry I was abrupt with him."

Amos grinned. "If you were, he hasn't had a chance to mention it to
me yet. But I think we'd better light a fire under the thing. We'll
probably get a blast from Buffalo before long. How many men do you have
on it?"

"Well, two helping with routine work, but I've done most of it myself,
evenings and weekends. I didn't want anybody to know too much about it.
Mr. Parry, I'm worried about it."

"Worried? How do you mean?"

"Well--let me show you the litter we've been testing it on."

The pigs were in pens outside the lab. Amos had seen figures on
weight gain and general health (the latter was what promised to be
sensational) but hadn't seen the animals for two weeks. He eyed the
first bunch. "How old is that boar pig?"

"Not quite four months."

Amos was no expert, but he'd spent many hours on customers' farms and
he thought the animal looked more mature than that. So did the shoats
in the same pen, though they tended more to fat. All of the group had
an odd look, certainly not normal for Yorkshires of their age. He
thought of wild hogs. "Is it just the general health factor?" he asked.

"I don't think so, Mr. Parry. You remember I told you this wasn't
actually a hormone."

"I know. You wanted to call it that for secrecy, you told me."

"Yes, sir, but I didn't tell you what it really was. Mr. Parry, are you
familiar with hypnotics? Mescaline, especially?"

"No, I'm not, Frank."

"Well, it's a drug that causes strong hallucinations. This is a
chemical derivative of it."

Amos grinned again. "Pipe dreams for hogs?"

He quit grinning as implications struck him. If this thing didn't pan
out, after the money they'd spent and the rumors that had seeped out,
there'd be some nasty questions from Buffalo. And if it did, and they
began selling it....

"What would it do to human beings?" asked Amos.

Barnes avoided his eyes. "That's one of the things I'm worried about,"
he said. "I want to show you another pig."

This one was isolated in its own pen, and it looked even stranger than
its siblings. In the first place, its hair was thicker, and black.
There was an oddness in its shape and a vaguely familiar sinuousness in
the way it moved that made Amos' skin prickle.

"What's wrong with it?" he asked.

"It's healthy except for the way it looks and acts."

"Same litter and dosage?"

"Yes, sir--all of them got just one dose. The effects seem to be
permanent."

They were leaning over the fence and the animal was looking up at
them. There was an oddity in its eyes; not intelligence exactly, but
something unpiglike. Abruptly, it stood up on its hind legs, putting
its forefeet against the fence and raising its head toward them.
It squealed as if begging for attention. Amos knew that pigs made
affectionate pets. Drawn to it as well as repelled, he reached down and
patted it, and the squealing stopped.

It was standing too easily in that position, and suddenly Amos
recognized what was familiar about it. He jerked his hand away, feeling
a strong desire for soap and water. "How long's it been this way?"

"It's changed fast in the last week."

Amos looked toward the doorway of the lab, just inside of which a large
black tomcat sat watching them. "Is the cat out here a lot?"

Barnes' eyes went to the cat, widened, and turned back to the pig. He
looked as ill as Amos felt.

       *       *       *       *       *

When Amos got to his office, his sales manager was already waiting.
His mind only half present, Amos sized up the stuffed briefcase and
the wider-than-necessary smile as he responded automatically to the
amenities. "Just get back?" he asked.

"Early train. Darned planes grounded again." Detrick looked full of
energy, though he'd undoubtedly rushed home, shaved, showered and
changed, and hurried to the office with no rest. He sat down, extracted
papers from the briefcase, and beamed, "Wrote up the Peach Association."

He'll give me the good news first, Amos thought. "Fine, fine," he said.
"The whole year?"

"Yep. Got a check from the Almond Growers, too. All paid up now."

"Good," said Amos, and waited.

It came. "Say, I was talking to Frank Barnes about that new hormone
he's got and he seemed a little negative about it. When do you think we
can have it?"

It was a temptation to answer with false optimisms and duck the issue
for a while, but Amos said, "The slowest thing will be State and
Federal testing and registration. I'd say not less than a year."

Detrick nodded. "Competition's selling more and more stuff that's not
registered."

"Fly-by-night outfits and they're always getting caught."

Detrick smiled. "Every night they fly away with more business."

Amos managed a smile, though the argument was old and weary. "We'll
put it up to Buffalo if you want to, Bill. You know I can't okay it
myself."

Detrick dropped the subject, not being a man to beat his head against
a stone wall if there were ways around it, and for the next hour Amos
had to listen to the troubles: competition had cut prices on this,
upped active ingredients in that, put such and such a new product on
the market (Whelan's factories and warehouses already groaned under a
crippling diversity of products but Sales didn't feel that was _their_
problem) and even the credit policies needed revising. But the worst
of all was a fifteen-thousand-dollar claim for damage to pear trees,
caused by a bad batch of Whelan's arsenical insecticide.

Amos got rid of Detrick with a few definite concessions, some tentative
ones, and some stand-offs. He made sure no one was waiting to see him
and told his secretary he didn't want to be bothered before lunch.

He had a lunch date with a customer and dreaded it--it meant three or
four highballs and overeating and an upset stomach later. Before then,
though, he had a few minutes to try to get his mind straightened out.
He mixed a glassful of the stuff he was supposed to take about now.
The Compleat Executive, he thought; with physician and prescription
attached. It didn't seem possible that this same body had once breezed
through anything from football to fried potatoes.

Mechanically, his mind on the lab's pigs, he got a small bag of grain
out of a desk drawer. He hoped nobody (except his secretary, of course)
knew he wasted time feeding pigeons, but it helped his nerves, and he
felt he had a right to one or two eccentricities.

They were already waiting. Some of them knew him and didn't shoo off
when he opened the window and scattered grain on the ledge outside. A
few ate from his hand.

It was a crisp day, but the sun slanting into the window was warm.
He leaned there, watching the birds--more were circling in now--and
looking out over the industrial part of the city. The rude shapes were
softened by haze and there was nothing noisy close by. He could almost
imagine it as some country landscape.

He looked at his watch, sighed, pulled his head in and shut the window.
The air conditioner's hiss replaced the outside sounds.

Not even imagination could get rid of the city for long.

       *       *       *       *       *

Going through the outer office, he saw that Alice Grant, his secretary,
already had her lunch out on her desk. She was a young thirty, not very
tall and just inclined to plumpness. She wore her blonde hair pulled
back into a knot that didn't succeed in making her look severe, and her
features were well-formed and regular, if plain. Amos noticed a new
bruise on one cheek and wondered how long she'd stay with her sot of a
husband. There were no children to hold her.

"I'll probably be back late," he said. "Anything for this afternoon?"

"Just Jim at two-thirty and the union agent at three."

The lunch didn't go too badly, lubricated as the customer liked it, and
Amos was feeling only hazily uneasy when he got back.

A stormy session with his plant superintendent jarred him into
the normal disquiet. Jim Glover was furious at having to take the
fifteen-thousand-dollar claim, though it was clearly a factory error.
He also fought a stubborn delaying action before giving Amos a
well-hedged estimate of fifty thousand to equip for the new drug. He
complained that Frank Barnes hadn't given him enough information.

Amos was still trembling from that encounter when the union business
agent arrived. The lunch was beginning to lump up and he didn't spar
effectively. Not that it made much difference. The union was going to
have a raise or else. By the time he'd squirmed through that interview,
then dictated a few letters, it was time to go home.

He hoped his wife would be out so he could take some of his
prescription and relax, but she met him at the door with a verbal
barrage. Their son, nominally a resident of the house, had gotten
ticketed with the college crowd for drunken driving and Amos was to get
it fixed; the Templetons were coming for the weekend; her brother's boy
was graduating and thought he might accept a position with Amos.

She paused and studied him. "I hope this isn't one of your grumpy
evenings. The Ashtons are coming for bridge."

His control slipped a little and he expressed himself pungently on
Wednesday night bridge, after a nightclub party on Tuesday and a
formless affair at somebody's house on Monday.

She stared at him without compassion or comprehension. "Well, they're
all business associates of yours. I wonder where you think you'd be
without a wife who was willing to entertain."

He'd been getting a lot of that lately; she was squeezing the role
of Executive's Wife for the last drop of satisfaction. Well, since he
couldn't relax with his indigestion there was only one thing to do. He
headed for the bar.

"Now don't get tipsy before dinner," she called after him.

He got through the evening well enough, doused with martinis, and the
night that followed was no worse than most.

       *       *       *       *       *

At nine the next morning, the call he'd been expecting from Buffalo
came through. "Hello, Stu," he said to the president of the company.

"Hello, Amos. Still morning out there, eh? How's the family? Good.
Say, Amos; couple of things. This big factory charge. Production's
screaming."

"It was definitely a bad batch, Stu."

"Well, that's it, then. Question is, how'd it happen?"

"Jim Glover says he needs another control chemist."

"Hope you're not practicing false economy out there."

"We wanted to hire another man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it down."

"You should have brought it to me personally if it was that important.
It's going to take a big bite out of your year's profit. Been able to
get your margin up any?"

Amos didn't feel up to pointing out that Sales wanted lower prices and
the union wanted higher wages, so that the margin would get even worse.
He described a couple of minor economies he'd been able to find, then
mentioned the contract with the Peach Association.

"Yes, I heard about that," said the president of the company. "Nice
piece of business. By the way, how you coming on that animal hormone?"

That was the main reason for the call, of course. Detrick had
undoubtedly phoned east and intimated that Amos was dragging his feet
on a potential bonanza. "I was going to call you on that, Stu. It'll
take a year to test and get registered and--"

"Amos, I hope you're not turning conservative on us."

The message was plain; Amos countered automatically. "You know me
better than that, Stu. It's the Legal Department I'm worried about. If
they set up a lot of roadblocks, we may need you to run interference."

"You know I'm always right behind you, Amos."

That's true, thought Amos as he hung up. Right behind me. A hell of a
place to run interference.

He knew exactly what to expect. If he tried to cut corners, the Legal
Department would scream about proper testing and registration,
Production would say he was pushing Jim Glover unreasonably, and
everyone who could would assume highly moral positions astraddle the
fence. A ton of paperwork would go to Buffalo to be distributed among
fifty desks and expertly stalled.

Not to mention that this was no ordinary product. He realized for the
first time that the Government might not let him produce it, let alone
sell it. Even as a minute percentage in feeds. If it was a narcotic, it
could be misused.

       *       *       *       *       *

His buzzer sounded, and he was surprised when Mrs. Grant announced
Frank Barnes. It was out of character for Frank not to make a formal
appointment first.

One look told Amos what was coming. He listened to Frank's resignation
with a fraction of his mind while the rest of it mused upon the
purposeful way things were converging.

Barnes stopped talking and Amos said mechanically, "You've been part
of the team for a long time, Frank. It's especially awkward to lose
you just now." It was banal, but it didn't matter; he wasn't going to
change the man's mind anyway. He looked closer. The timidity was gone.
So were the eyeglasses. A frightening thought struck him. "You've
taken some of that drug."

Barnes grinned and handed a small vial full of powder across the desk,
along with a file folder. "Last night," he said. "Between frustration
with the job and curiosity about this stuff, I yielded to temptation."

Amos took the vial and folder. "What are these for?"

"So you can destroy them if you want to. I've doctored up the lab
records to make the whole thing look like a false alarm. You're holding
all that's left of the whole program."

Amos looked for signs of irrationality and saw none. "Do you feel all
right?"

"Better than you can imagine. But let me tell you what you're up
against. I can at least do that for you, Mr. Parry."

"Thanks. Don't you suppose you could call me Amos now?"

"Sure, Amos. First of all, you were right about that pig trying to
imitate the cat. He couldn't do much because he only had a pig's brain
to work with." He stopped and grinned, evidently at Amos' expression.
"I'll try to explain. What is an animal? Physically, I mean?"

Amos shook his head. "You've got the floor."

"All right. An animal is a colony of cells. Different kinds of cells
form organs and do different things for the colony, but each cell has
a life of its own, too. When it dies a new one of the same kind takes
over. But what regulates the colony? What maintains the pattern?"

Amos waited.

"Part of it's automatic replacement, cell for cell. But beyond that
there's a control; and it's the unconscious mind." He paused and
studied Amos. "You think I'm theorizing. I'm not. That drug broke down
some barriers, and I see all this as you see your own fingers moving."

Amos remembered the mention of hallucinations.

       *       *       *       *       *

Barnes grinned again. "Let's say it's only one per cent awake and
walled off from the conscious mind. What would happen if something
removed the wall and woke up the other ninety-nine per cent?"

Remembering the pig, it was impossible not to feel a cold seed of
belief. Amos dreaded what was coming next; clearly, it would be a
demonstration.

Barnes held out his hand, palm up. In a few seconds a pink spot
appeared. It turned red, oozed dismayingly, and became a small pool
of blood. Barnes let it stay for a moment, then wiped it off with a
handkerchief. There was no more bleeding. "That's something I can do
fast," he said. "I opened the pores, directed blood to them, then
closed them again. Amos, do you believe in werewolves?"

Amos wanted to jump up and shout, "No! You're insane!" but he could
only sit staring.

"I could move that thumb around to the other side of my hand," Barnes
said thoughtfully. "I'm still exploring, but I don't think even the
bone would take too long. You'll notice I don't need glasses any more."

The buzzer buzzed. Amos jumped, and from habit answered. "Bill Detrick
and that customer are here, Mr. Parry," came Alice Grant's voice.

"I--ask them to wait," he managed.

His mind was a muddle; he needed time. "You--Frank--will you stay for a
few days?"

"Sure. I'm in no hurry now. And while you're thinking, let me give you
a few hints. No more cripples or disease. No ugly people, unless they
choose to be. And no law."

"No--law?"

"How would you police such a world? A man could change his face at
will, or his fingerprints. Even his teeth. Probably he could do things
I can't imagine yet."

The buzzer went again, with Mrs. Grant's subtle urgency. Amos ignored
it, yet he hardly knew when Frank left the room.

He realized the chemist had done him a favor. The selfish thing would
have been to keep the secret and the boon all to himself; instead, he'd
given Amos the choice.

But what was the choice? Suppressing the drug would cost him his job.
There was no doubt about that.

He was standing with his back to the door when he heard it open. He
turned and faced Detrick's annoyed frown. "Amos, we can't keep this man
waiting. He's--"

All of Amos' frustration and the new burden coalesced into rage. He ran
toward Detrick. "You baboon-faced huckster!" he yelled. "Get out! Get
out! I'll tell you when you can come in here!" He barely caught his
upraised fist in time.

Detrick stood petrified, his face ludicrous. Then he came to life,
ducked out, and pulled the door shut behind him.

Amos waited no longer; if he had to decide, he wanted the data
first-hand. He spread out the file Barnes had left him and looked
through it for dosages. Apparently it wasn't critical, so he poured a
little of the powder into a tumbler, added water and threw it down.
There was a mild alkaline taste, which he washed out of his mouth with
more water. Then he sat down to wait.

       *       *       *       *       *

A monotone seemed to be rattling off trivia; almost faster than he
could grasp it, even though it was in his head and not in his ears:
"Paris green/calcium acetoarsenite/beetle invasion Texan cotton/paint
pigment/obsolete/should eliminate/compensation claim/man probably
faking infection/Detrick likes because we only source/felt like hitting
him when we argued about it/correspondence Buffalo last year/they say
keep/check how use as poison/damned wife--"

The last thought shocked his intellect awake. "Hey!" Intellect
demanded. "What's going on here?"

"Oh; you've broken through," said Unconscious. "That was fast.
Fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds since you drank it.
Probable error, one-third second. I've only been awake a few minutes
myself. Minute/sixty per hour/twenty-four hours day/days getting
shorter/September/have raincoat in car/wife wants new car/raincoat
sweats plasticizer/stinks/Hyatt used camphor--"

"Hold up a minute!" cried Intellect.

"You want me to stop scanning?"

"Is that what you're doing? Scanning what?"

"Memory banks, of course. Don't you remember the book we read three
years ago? 'Human brain estimated--' Oh, all right; I'll slow down.
You could follow me better if you'd let me grow some permanent direct
connections."

"Am I stopping you?"

"Well, not you, exactly. I'll show you." Unconscious began directing
the growth of certain nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos could only
follow it vaguely.

"Fear!" screamed a soundless voice. "Stop!"

"What was that?" Intellect asked, startled.

"That was Id. He always fights any improvements, and I can't override
him."

"Can _I_?"

"Of course; that's mainly what you're for. Wait till I get these
connections finished and you'll see the whole setup."

"FEAR!" shrieked Id. "STOP! NO CHANGE!"

"SHUT UP!" yelled Intellect.

It was strange being integrated; Amos found he was aware on two
levels simultaneously. While he responded normally to his external
environment, a lightning inner vision saw everything in vastly greater
detail. The blink of an eye, for instance, was an amazing project. Even
as commands flashed out and before the muscles started to respond,
extra blood was rushing into the area to nourish the working parts.
Reports flowed back like battle assessments: these three muscles
were on schedule; this was lagging; that was pulling too hard. An
infinitesimal twinge of pain marked some minor accident, and correction
began at once. A censor watched the whole operation and labeled each
incoming report: trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record;
trivial, do not record; worth watching, record in temporary banks;
trivial, do not....

He felt now that he could look forward to permanent health, and so far
he didn't seem to be losing his identity or becoming a moral monster
(though certain previously buried urges--toward Alice Grant, for
instance--were now rather embarrassingly uncovered). He was not, like
Frank Barnes, inclined to slip out of the situation at once. He still
felt the responsibility to make the decision.

He carried the vial of powder and the lab records home with him,
smuggled them past his wife's garrulity (it didn't bother him now)
and hid them. He went out with her cheerfully to visit some people he
didn't like, and found himself amused at them instead of annoyed. In
general, he felt buoyant, and they stayed quite late.

       *       *       *       *       *

When they did get home, an urgent message was waiting on the telephone
recorder, and it jolted him. He grabbed up the hat and coat he'd just
laid down.

"What is it?" his wife demanded.

"I've got to go down to the plant." He hesitated; it was hard to say
the words that were charged with personal significance. "The watchman
found Frank Barnes dead in the laboratory."

"Who?"

"Frank Barnes! My chief chemist!"

"Oh." She looked at him, obviously concerned only with what effect, if
any, it might have on her own circumstances. "Why do you have to get
mixed up in it?"

"I'm the boss, damn it!" He left her standing there and ran for the
garage.

The police were already at the plant when he arrived. Fred's body lay
on the floor of his office, in a corner behind some file cabinets, face
up.

"What was it?" Amos asked the man from the coroner's office, dreading
the answer he expected.

The answer wasn't the one he expected. "Heart attack."

Amos wondered if they were mistaken. He looked around the office.
Things weren't disarrayed in any way; it looked as if Frank had simply
lain down and died. "When did you find him?" he asked the watchman.

"A little after one. The door was closed and the lights were out, but I
heard the cat yowling in here, so I came in to let it out, and saw the
body."

"Any family?" one of the city men asked.

"No," said Amos slowly, "he lived alone. I guess you might as well take
him to the ... morgue. When can I call about the autopsy?"

"Try after lunch."

Amos watched them carry Frank away. Then he put out the lights and
closed up the laboratory. He told the watchman he'd be around for a
while, and went to his office to think.

As nearly as he knew, Frank had taken the drug less than twenty-four
hours before he had. Death had come late at night, which meant Frank
had been working overtime. Why? And why hadn't he been able to save
himself?

"Not logical," his unconscious stated firmly. "He should have felt it
coming and made repairs."

"This whole thing's a delusion," said Amos dully, aloud.

"No, it isn't," said a peculiar voice behind him.

He whirled and saw the black tomcat grinning up at him. He gasped,
wondering if he were completely insane, but in a flash understanding
came. "Frank!"

"Well, don't act so surprised. I can tell that you took some yourself."

"Yes--but how--"

"I thought it would be an easy life and I want to stay around here and
watch things for a while. It ought to be fun."

"But _how_?"

"I anesthetized the cat and grew a bridge into his skull. It took five
hours to transfer the bulk of my personality. It's odd, but it blended
right in with his."

"But--your speech!"

"I've made some changes. I'm omnivorous now, too, not just
carnivorous--or will be in a few more hours. I can go into the hills
and live on grass, or grow back into a man, or whatever I like."

Amos consulted his own inwardness again. "Is this possible? Can a human
mind be compressed into a cat's brain?"

"Sure," said Unconscious, "if you're willing to junk all the excess."

He thought about it. "So you're going to stay around and watch," he
said to the cat--no, Frank. "An intriguing idea. My family's taken care
of, and nobody'll really miss me."

"Except Alice Grant," said Frank cattily. "I've seen the way you look
at her. The cat part of me has, I mean. And she looks back, too, when
you aren't watching."

"Well," said Amos. "Hm. Maybe we can do something there too."

       *       *       *       *       *

His own metamorphosis took a lot longer than five hours; he had a much
bigger job of alterations to finish. It was nearly two months before he
got back to the plant.

He peered in through the window at Detrick, who'd inherited Amos' old
office. Detrick was chewing out a salesman. Amos knew what would be
happening now; Derrick's ambitious but unsound expansion would have
gotten the division all tangled up. In fact, with his sharp new eyes,
Amos could read part of a letter from Buffalo that lay on the desk. It
was quite critical of Detrick's margin of profit.

The salesman Detrick had on the carpet was a good man, and Amos
wondered if he was to blame for whatever it was about. Maybe Detrick
was just preparing to throw him to the wolves. A man could hang on a
long time like that, shifting the blame to his subordinates.

The salesman was finally excused, and Detrick sat alone with all the
frustration and selfish scheming plain on his face. No, Amos thought,
I'm not going to turn this drug loose on the world for a while. Not
while there are people like Detrick around.

There were no other pigeons on the window ledge except himself and
Alice; the rest had stopped coming when Amos disappeared and the
feeding ended. For that matter, they tended to avoid him and Alice,
possibly because of the abnormal size, especially around the head, and
the other differences.

He noticed that Alice was changing the color of her feet again. Just
like a woman, he thought fondly.

"Come on, Pigeon," he said, "let's go somewhere else. This tightwad
Detrick isn't going to give us anything to eat."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
