           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from
                     Galaxy Magazine August 1962.

         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]




                They didn't have to worry about a thing
                for the rest of their natural lives....


James Ypsilanti swung at the door with the steak cuber. Or was it
the cube steaker? No matter. The door was a good, hardwood door and
resisted his onslaught well. But time was on his side.

He had the energy and the time, he knew, and sooner or later the door
would be kindling.

It was the door to his room. It was evident to him that he did not need
the door to his room and that he _did_ need heat. In fact he had better
get some heat pretty soon--although he was keeping warm enough for the
present by beating on the door. So he would beat this door to kindling,
and then he would build a nice, cozy fire in the hall that would keep
him warm for a long time ... if he was stingy with his fuel.

The carpenter came by. The carpenter was always coming by, except when
you wanted him, Jim realized. The carpenter was a mighty, mighty busy
fellow.

The carpenter stopped short when he saw Jim demolishing the door. In
fact he came to a grinding halt.

"Jim, why didn't you tell me!"

"Carpenter, how was I to know where you were? Who can ever find you?"

"I know Jim. Jim, you work so hard!"

"Yes!" he said, pounding.

"Take this hatchet, Jim. A hatchet is what you demolish doors with!
Good-by." The carpenter departed.

James Ypsilanti swung on the door with his newly acquired hatchet. Soon
he was ready for his fire. He struck a match, and in no time had the
pile of varnished kindling blazing smokily in the hall. He held his
hands over the blaze.

"Ah, good, good. Good." He closed his eyes. "What could be better than
this?" Then he opened them again regretfully. "It's dinner time. I'd
better fix it while I have my fire going." He hurried to the kitchen
and chose a can of eggs-bacon-and-pancakes from the massive stores.

       *       *       *       *       *

Opening the large can, he heated it over his hall fire. Then he dumped
the contents on his tin plate and ate.

"Murder," he thought somberly. "That's what I'm in for. Practically
murder with consent. She said she couldn't live without me. Margie
begged me to kill her, you might as well say. Good old Margie; a good
kid, but I killed her. And now.... Well, that's life!" He speared a
pancake.

"Damn, but it's _cold_!" He threw an armload of wood on the fire and it
blazed up. "Sure wish these carpenters had feelings. My lord, they got
no feelings at all!"

The carpenter arrived with a new hardwood door. Whistling cheerily, he
began to install it where the other one had just been hatcheted away.

"Carpenter, that door won't be staying there long. I'm almost out of
fuel."

"I hope you don't expect me to be surprised, Jim, if this door doesn't
last very long. The previous twenty-two doors at this location,
Jim, did not last very long either." Still whistling to himself, he
installed the last of the hinge screws.

"Why don't you just _give_ me the doors, instead of causing yourself
all this work?" demanded James Ypsilanti.

"'Inmates will not be issued materials,' Jim. I've quoted that section
of the rules to you many times, Jim."

"But couldn't you just _lean_ the door up against the door jamb and
leave it?" argued the inmate. "You go to a ridiculous amount of
trouble."

"It is not ridiculous, Jim. I am a carpenter, Jim. Good-by."

After lunch, James Ypsilanti crawled into his escape tunnel.

He liked to go in there every day and daydream. The tunnel ended
abortively at the wall of the prison, for the prison wall extended down
into solid bed rock for a meter, and it was fabricated of one-meter
thick compressed steel. It was the nearest thing to an exit that the
prison had.

Officials had always come and gone through the massive, englobing wall
by matter transmitters. "Smarties couldn't find me though, when I was
in my escape tunnel," he chortled, as he stretched out in the cave
under the concrete. "They can walk through walls, but they couldn't
find _me_." Then his tone became baleful. "The smarties'll never find
me."

       *       *       *       *       *

As James Ypsilanti chopped on the door next day, the carpenter stood
cheerily watching.

"Carpenter, why don't you fix the damn heating plant? Then I wouldn't
have to be chopping up your doors all the time to keep warm."

"I am a carpenter, Jim, not a heat-plant fixer, as you well know from
our previous negotiations on the subject."

"What will you do, carpenter, when I have used up all your doors?" the
convict jibed.

"Why, Jim, we will have to send out for some more," the carpenter
answered condescendingly.

"Still, I wish you would let _me_ work on that heat plant," urged
Ypsilanti. "I might fix it."

"'Inmates will not be permitted to disassemble or otherwise interfere
with the machinery of the institution,'" quoted the carpenter. "Need I
say more, Jim?"

"Okay," said James Ypsilanti, resuming his destructive work on the new
door. "Scram, stupid." The carpenter departed.

"That dope," Jim said between blows, "is even foggier in the head than
my lousy lawyer was, and that's going some."

"Jim," said the carpenter, returning and sounding very pleased with
himself, "look here at what I have found, Jim."

James Ypsilanti turned to look at what the carpenter held in his hand.
It was a carpenter's square sheathed in plastic.

"Found enough of them to last me a lifetime, Jim," said the carpenter
complacently. "I'll never have to buy any."

"No, you won't," agreed James Ypsilanti bitterly. "Can't you get it
into your head that you and I are the only ones left on Earth? After
the war the rest left. They couldn't _find_ us when they evacuated this
atomic-explosion wrecked planet, because we were in this escape-proof
jug. So they went away and _left_ us!"

"I know, Jim."

Ypsilanti studied the mobile features of the carpenter, searching
intently for a sign.

But the carpenter robot strolled away, whistling.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
