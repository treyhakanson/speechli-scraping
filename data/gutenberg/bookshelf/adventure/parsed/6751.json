The cold steel and khaki of\nnative Indian cavalry at attention gleamed motionless between British\ninfantry and two batteries of horse artillery. The only noticeable\nsound was the voice of a general officer, that rose and fell explaining\nand asserting pride in his command, but saying nothing as to the why of\nexercises in the mud. Nor did he mention why the censorship was in full\nforce. He did not say a word of Germany, or Belgium.\n\nIn front of the third squadron from the right, Risaldar-Major Ranjoor\nSingh sat his charger like a big bronze statue. He would have stooped\nto see his right spur better, that shone in spite of mud, for though he\nhas been a man these five-and-twenty years, Ranjoor Singh has neither\nlost his boyhood love of such things, nor intends to; he has been\naccused of wearing solid silver spurs in bed. But it hurt him to bend\nmuch, after a day's hard exercise on a horse such as he rode.\n\nOnce--in a rock-strewn gully where the whistling Himalayan wind was\nActing Antiseptic-of-the-Day--a young surgeon had taken hurried\nstitches over Ranjoor Singh's ribs without probing deep enough for an\nAfghan bullet; that bullet burned after a long day in the saddle. And\nBagh was--as the big brute's name implied--a tiger of a horse,\nunweakened even by monsoon weather, and his habit was to spring with\nterrific suddenness when his rider moved on him.\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh sat still. He was willing to eat agony at any time for\nthe squadron's sake--for a squadron of Outram's Own is a unity to\nmarvel at, or envy; and its leader a man to be forgiven spurs a\nhalf-inch longer than the regulation. As a soldier, however, he was\ncareful of himself when occasion offered.\n\nSikh-soldier-wise, he preferred Bagh to all other horses in the world,\nbecause it had needed persuasion, much stroking of a black beard--to\nhide anxiety--and many a secret night-ride--to sweat the brute's\nsavagery--before the colonel-sahib could be made to see his virtues as\na charger and accept him into the regiment. Sikh-wise, he loved all\nthings that expressed in any way his own unconquerable fire. Most of\nall, however, he loved the squadron; there was no woman, nor anything\nbetween him and D Squadron; but Bagh came next.\n\nSpurs were not needed when the general ceased speaking, and the British\ncolonel of Outram's Own shouted an order. Bagh, brute energy beneath\nhand-polished hair and plastered dirt, sprang like a loosed\nHell-tantrum, and his rider's lips drew tight over clenched teeth as he\nmastered self, agony and horse in one man's effort. Fight how he would,\nheel, tooth and eye all flashing, Bagh was forced to hold his rightful\nplace in front of the squadron, precisely the right distance behind the\nlast supernumerary of the squadron next in front.\n\nLine after rippling line, all Sikhs of the true Sikh baptism except for\nthe eight of their officers who were European, Outram's Own swept down\na living avenue of British troops; and neither gunners nor infantry\ncould see one flaw in them, although picking flaws in native regiments\nis almost part of the British army officer's religion.\n\nTo the blare of military music, through a bog of their own mixing, the\nSikhs trotted for a mile, then drew into a walk, to bring the horses\ninto barracks cool enough for watering.\n\nThey reached stables as the sun dipped under the near-by acacia trees,\nand while the black-bearded troopers scraped and rubbed the mud from\nweary horses, Banjoor Singh went through a task whose form at least was\npart of his very life. He could imagine nothing less than death or\nactive service that could keep him from inspecting every horse in the\nsquadron before he ate or drank, or as much as washed himself.\n\nBut, although the day had been a hard one and the strain on the horses\nmore than ordinary, his examination now was so perfunctory that the\nsquadron gaped; the troopers signaled with their eyes as he passed,\nlittle more than glancing at each horse. Almost before his back had\nvanished at the stable entrance, wonderment burst into words.\n\n\"For the third time he does thus!\"\n\n\"See! My beast overreached, and he passed without detecting it! Does\nthe sun set the same way still?\"\n\n\"I have noticed that he does thus each time after a field-day. What is\nthe connection? A field-day in the rains--a general officer talking to\nus afterward about the Salt, as if a Sikh does not understand the Salt\nbetter than a British general knows English--and our risaldar-major\nneglecting the horses--is there a connection?\"\n\n\"Aye. What is all this? We worked no harder in the war against the\nChitralis. There is something in my bones that speaks of war, when I\nlisten for a while!\"\n\n\"War! Hear him, brothers! Talk is talk, but there will be no war until\nIndia grows too fat to breathe--unless the past be remembered and we\nmake one for ourselves!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence for a while, if a change of sounds is silence. The\nDelhi mud sticks as tight as any, and the kneading of it from out of\nhorsehair taxes most of a trooper's energy and full attention. Then,\nthe East being the East in all things, a solitary trooper picked up\nthe scent and gave tongue, as a true hound guides the pack.\n\n\"Who is _she_?\" he wondered, loud enough for fifty men to hear.\n\nFrom out of a cloud of horse-dust, where a stable helper on probation\ncombed a tangled tail, came one word of swift enlightenment.\n\n\"Yasmini!\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h!\" In a second the whole squadron was by the ears, and the\nstable-helper was the center of an interest he had not bargained for.\n\n\"Nay, sahibs, I but followed him, and how should I know? Nay, then I\ndid not follow him! It so happened. I took that road, and he stepped\nout of a _tikka-gharri_ at her door. Am I blind? Do I not know her\ndoor? Does not everybody know it? Who am I that I should know why he\ngoes again? But--does a moth fly only once to the lamp-flame? Does a\ndrunkard drink but once? By the Guru, nay! May my tongue parch in my\nthroat if I said he is a drunkard! I said--I meant to say--seeing she\nis Yasmini, and he having been to see her once--and being again in a\ngreat hurry--whither goes he?\"\n\nSo the squadron chose a sub-committee of inquiry, seven strong, that\nbeing a lucky number the wide world over, and the movements of the\nrisaldar-major were reported one by one to the squadron with the\ninfinite exactness of small detail that seems so useless to all save\nEasterns.\n\nFifteen minutes after he had left his quarters, no longer in khaki\nuniform, but dressed as a Sikh gentleman, the whole squadron knew the\ncolor of his undershirt, also that he had hired a _tikka-gharri_, and\nthat his only weapon was the ornamental dagger that a true Sikh wears\ntwisted in his hair. One after one, five other men reported him nearly\nall the way through Delhi, through the Chandni Chowk--where the last\nman but one nearly lost him in the evening crowd--to the narrow place\nwhere, with a bend in the street to either hand, is Yasmini's.\n\nThe last man watched him through Yasmini's outer door and up the lower\nstairs before hurrying back to the squadron. And a little later on,\nbeing almost as inquisitive as they were careful for their major, the\nsquadron delegated other men, in mufti, to watch for him at the foot of\nYasmini's stairs, or as near to the foot as might be, and see him\nsafely home again if they had to fight all Asia on the way.\n\nThese men had some money with them, and weapons hidden underneath their\nclothes; for, having betted largely on the quail-fight at Abdul's\nstables, the squadron was in funds.\n\n\"In case of trouble one can bribe the police,\" counseled Nanak Singh,\nand he surely ought to know, for he was the oldest trooper, and trouble\neverlasting had preserved him from promotion. \"But weapons are good,\nwhen policemen are not looking,\" he added, and the squadron agreed with\nhim.\n\nIt was Tej Singh, not given to talking as is rule, who voiced the\ngeneral opinion.\n\n\"Now we are on the track of things. Now, perhaps, we shall know the\nmeaning of field exercises during the monsoon, with our horses up to\nthe belly in blue mud! The winds of all the world blow into Yasmini's\nand out again. Our risaldar-major knows nothing at all of women--and\nthat is the danger. But he can listen to the wind; and, what he hears,\nsooner or later we shall know, too. I smell happenings!\"\n\nThose three words comprised the whole of it. The squadron spent most of\nthe night whispering, dissecting, analyzing, subdividing, weighing,\nguessing at that smell of happenings, while its risaldar-major,\nthinking his secret all his own, investigated nearer to its source.\n\n\n  Have you heard the dry earth shrug herself\n  For a storm that tore the trees?\n\n  Have you watched loot-hungry Faithful\n  Praising Allah on their knees?\n\n  Have you felt the short hairs rising\n  When the moon slipped out of sight,\n\n  And the chink of steel on rock explained\n  That footfall in the night?\n\n  Have you seen a gray boar sniff up-wind\n  In the mauve of waking day?\n\n  Have you heard a mad crowd pause and think?\n  Have you seen all Hell to pay?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nYasmini bears a reputation that includes her gift for dancing and her\nskill in song, but is not bounded thereby, Her stairs illustrated\nit--the two flights of steep winding stairs that lead to her\nbewildering reception-floor; they seem to have been designed to take\nmen's breath away, and to deliver them at the top defenseless.\n\nBut Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh mounted them with scarcely an effort,\nas a man who could master Bagh well might, and at the top his\nmiddle-aged back was straight and his eye clear. The cunning, curtained\nlights did not distract him; so he did not make the usual mistake of\nthinking that the Loveliness who met him was Yasmini.\n\nYasmini likes to make her first impression of the evening on a man just\nas he comes from making an idiot of himself; so the maid who curtsies\nin the stair-head maze of mirrored lights has been trained to imitate\nher. But Ranjoor Singh flipped the girl a coin, and it jingled at her\nfeet.\n\nThe maid ceased bowing, too insulted to retort. The piece of\nsilver--she would have stooped for gold, just as surely as she would\nhave recognized its ring--lay where it fell. Ranjoor Singh stepped\nforward toward a glass-bead curtain through which a soft light shone,\nand an unexpected low laugh greeted him. It was merry, mocking,\nmusical--and something more. There was wisdom hidden in\nit--masquerading as frivolity; somewhere, too, there was\nvillainy-villainy that she who laughed knew all about and found more\ninteresting than a play.\n\nThen suddenly the curtain parted, and Yasmini blocked the way, standing\nwith arms spread wide to either door-post, smiling at him; and Ranjoor\nSingh had to stop and stare whether it suited him or not.\n\nYasmini is not old, nor nearly old, for all that India is full of tales\nabout her, from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. In a land where twelve\nis a marriageable age, a woman need not live to thirty to be talked\nabout; and if she can dance as Yasmini does--though only the Russian\nballet can do that--she has the secret of perpetual youth to help her\ndefy the years. No doubt the soft light favored her, but she might have\nbeen Ranjoor Singh's granddaughter as she barred his way and looked him\nup and down impudently through languorous brown eyes.\n\n\"Salaam, O plowman!\" she mocked. She was not actually still an instant,\nfor the light played incessantly on her gauzy silken trousers and\njeweled slippers, but she made no move to admit him. \"My honor grows!\nTwice--nay, three times in a little while!\"\n\nShe spoke in the Jat tongue fluently; but that was not remarkable,\nbecause Yasmini is mistress of so many languages that men say one can\nnot speak in her hearing and not be understood.\n\n\"I am a soldier,\" answered Ranjoor Singh more than a little stiffly.\n\n\"'I am a statesman,' said the viceroy's babu! A Sikh is a Jat farmer\nwith a lion's tail and the manners of a buffalo! Age or gallantry will\nbend a man's back. What keeps it straight--the smell of the farmyard on\nhis shoes?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh did not answer, nor did he bow low as she intended. She\nforgot, perhaps, that on a previous occasion he had seen her snatch a\nman's turban from his head and run with it into the room, to the man's\nsweating shame. He kicked his shoes off calmly and waited as a man\nwaits on parade, looking straight into her eyes that were like dark\njewels, only no jewels in the world ever glowed so wonderfully; he\nthought he could read anger in them, but that ruffled him no more than\nher mockery.\n\n\"Enter, then, O farmer!\" she said, turning lithely as a snake, to\nbeckon him and lead the way.\n\nNow he had only a back view of her, but the contour of her neck and\nchin and her shoulders mocked him just as surely as her lips were\nmaking signals that he could not see. One answer to the signals was the\ntittering of twenty maids, who sat together by the great deep window,\nready to make music.\n\n\"They laugh to see a farmer strayed from his manure-pile!\" purred\nYasmini over her shoulder; but Ranjoor Singh followed her unperturbed.\n\nHe was finding time to study the long room, its divans and deep\ncushions around the walls; and it did not escape his notice that many\npeople were expected. He guessed there was room for thirty or forty to\nsit at ease.\n\nLike a pale blue will-o'-the-wisp, a glitter in the cunning lights, she\nled him to a far end of the room where many cushions were, There she\nturned on him with a snake-like suddenness that was one of her surest\ntricks.\n\n\"I shall have great guests to-night--I shall be busy.\"\n\n\"That is thy affair,\" said Ranjoor Singh, aware that her eyes were\nseeking to read his soul. The dropped lids did not deceive him.\n\n\"Then, what do you want here?\"\n\nThat question was sheer impudence. It is very well understood in Delhi\nthat any native gentleman of rank may call on Yasmini between midday\nand midnight without offering a reason for his visit; otherwise it\nwould be impossible to hold a salon and be a power in politics, in a\nland where politics run deep, but where men do not admit openly to\nwhich party they belong. But Yasmini represents the spirit of the Old\nEast, sweeter than a rose and twice as tempting--with a poisoned thorn\ninside. And here was the New East, in the shape of a middle-aged Sikh\nofficer taught by Young England.\n\nHe annoyed her.\n\nRanjoor Singh's answer was to seat himself, with a dignity the West has\nyet to learn, on a long divan against the wall that gave him a good\nview of the entrance and all the rest of the room, window included.\nInstantly Yasmini flung herself on the other end of it, and lay face\ndownward, with her chin resting on both hands.\n\nShe studied his face intently for sixty seconds, and it very seldom\ntakes her that long to read a man's character, guess at his past, and\nmake arrangements for his future, if she thinks him worth her while.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" she asked again at the end of her scrutiny.\n\nRanjoor Singh seemed not to hear her; he was watching other men who\nentered, and listening to the sound of yet others on the stairs. No\nother Sikh came in, nor more than one of any other caste or tribe; yet\nhe counted thirty men in half as many minutes.\n\n\"I think you are a buffalo!\" she said at last; but if Ranjoor Singh was\ninterested in her thoughts he forgot to admit it.\n\nA dozen more men entered, and the air, already heavy, grew thick with\ntobacco smoke mingling with the smoke of sandal-wood that floated back\nand forth in layers as the punkahs swung lazily. Outside, the rain\nswished and chilled the night air; but the hot air from inside hurried\nout to meet the cool, and none of the cool came in. The noise of rain\nbecame depressing until Yasmini made a signal to her maids and they\nstarted to make music.\n\nThen Yasmini caught a new sound on the stairs, and swiftly, instantly,\ninstead of glancing to the entrance, her eyes sought Ranjoor Singh's;\nand she saw that he had heard it too. So she sat up as if enlightenment\nhad come and had brought disillusion in its wake.\n\nThe glass-bead curtain jingled, and a maid backed through it giggling,\nfollowed in a hurry by a European, dressed in a white duck apology for\nevening clothes. He seemed a little the worse for drink, but not too\ndrunk to recognize the real Yasmini when he saw her and to blush\ncrimson for having acted like an idiot.\n\n\"Queen of the Night!\" he said in Hindustani that was peculiarly\nmispronounced.\n\n\"_Box-wallah!_\" she answered under her breath; but she smiled at him,\nand aloud she said, \"Will the sahib honor us all by being seated?\"\n\nA maid took charge of the man at once, and led him to a seat not far\nfrom the middle of the room. Yasmini, whose eyes were on Ranjoor Singh\nevery other second, noticed that the Sikh, having summed up the\nEuropean, had already lost all interest.\n\nBut there, were other footsteps. The curtain parted again to admit a\nsecond European, a somewhat older man, who glanced back over his\nshoulder deferentially and, to Yasmini's unerring eye, tried to carry\noff prudish timidity with an air of knowingness.\n\n\"Who is he?\" demanded Ranjoor Singh; and Yasmini rattled the bracelets\non her ankles loud enough to hide a whisper.\n\n\"An agent,\" she answered. \"He has an office here in Delhi. The first\nman is his clerk, who is supposed to be the leader into mischief; they\nhave made him a little drunk lest he understand too much. I have sent a\nmaid to him that he may understand even less.\"\n\nThe second man was closely followed by a third, and Yasmini smothered a\nsqueal of excitement, for she saw that Ranjoor Singh's eyes were ablaze\nat last and that he had sat bolt upright without knowing it. The third\nman was dressed like the other two in white duck, but he wore his\nclothes not as they did. He was tall and straight. One could easily\nenough imagine him dressed better.\n\nHis quick, intelligent gray eyes swept over the whole room while he\ntook two steps, and at once picked out Yasmini as the mistress of the\nplace; but he waited to bow to her until the first man pointed her out.\nThen it seemed to Ranjoor Singh--who was watching as minutely as\nYasmini in turn watched him--that, when he bowed, this tall,\nconfident-looking individual almost clicked his heels together, but\nremembered not to do so just in time. The eyes of the East miss no\nsmall details. Yasmini, letting her jeweled ankles jingle again,\nchuckled to Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"And they say he comes from Europe selling goods,\" she whispered. \"The\nfat man who is frightened claims to be a customer for bales of\nblankets. Since when has the customer been humble while the seller\ncalls the tune? Look!\"\n\nThe second arrival and the third sat down together as she spoke; and\nwhile the second sat like a merchant, nursing fat hands on a\nconsequential paunch, the third sat straight-backed, kicking a little\nsidewise with his left leg. Ranjoor Singh saw, too, that he kept his\nheels a little more than a spur's length off from the divan's drapery.\n\n\"Listen!\" hissed Ranjoor Singh.\n\nYasmini wriggled closer, and pretended to be watching her maids over by\nthe window.\n\n\"That man who came last,\" said the risaldar-major, \"has been told that\nthou art like a spider, watching from the middle of the web of India.\"\n\n\"Then for once they have told the truth!\" she chuckled.\n\n\"In the bazaar he asked to be shown men of all the tribes, that he\nmight study their commercial needs. He was told to come here and meet\nthem; and these were sent for from the caravanserais. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Art thou thyself for the Raj?\" asked Yasmini.\n\n\"I lead a squadron of Sikh cavalry,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and you ask\nme am I for the Raj?\"\n\n\"The buffalo that carries water for the office lawn is for the Raj!\"\nsaid Yasmini.\n\n\"Then he and I are brothers.\"\n\n\"And he, yonder--what of him?\" She was growing impatient, for the tune\nwas nearly at an end, and it would be time presently for her to take up\nthe burden of entertainment.\n\n\"He will ask, perhaps, to speak with a Sikh of influence.\"\n\n\"Sahib, 'to hear is to obey,'\" she mocked, rising to her feet.\n\n\"Listen yet!\" commanded Ranjoor Singh. \"Serve me in this matter, and\nthere will be great reward. I, who am only one, might die by a dagger,\nor a rope in the dark, or ground glass in my bread; but then there\nwould be a squadron, and perhaps a regiment, to ask questions.\"\n\n\"Perhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Who knows?\"\n\nHe spoke from modesty, sure of the squadron that he loved so much\nbetter than his life, but not caring to magnify his own importance by\nclaiming the regard of the other squadrons, too. But Yasmini, who never\nin her life went straight from point to point of an idea and never\ncould believe that anybody else did, supposed he meant that one\nsquadron was in his confidence, whereas the rest had not yet been\nsounded.\n\n\"So speaks one who is for the Raj!\" she grinned.\n\nPlaying for profit and amusement, she never, never let anybody know\nwhich side she had taken in any game. Therefore she despised a man who\nshowed his hand to her, as she believed Ranjoor Singh had done. But she\nonly showed contempt when it suited her, and by no means always when\nshe felt it.\n\nThe minor music ceased and all eyes in the room were turned to her. She\nrose to her feet as a hooded cobra comes toward its prey, sparing a\nsidewise surreptitious smile of confidence for Ranjoor Singh that no\neye caught save his; yet as she turned from him and swayed in the first\nfew steps of a dance devised that minute, his quick ear caught the\ntruth of her opinion:\n\n\"Buffalo!\" she murmured.\n\nThe flutes in the window wailed about mystery. The lights, and the\nsandal-smoke, and the expectant silence emphasized it. Step by step, as\nif the spirit of all dancing had its home in her, she told a wordless\ntale, using her feet and every sinuous muscle as no other woman in all\nIndia ever did.\n\nMen say that Yasmini is partly Russian, and that may be true, for she\nspeaks Russian fluently. Russian or not, the members of the Russian\nballet are the only others in the world who share her art. Certainly,\nshe keeps in touch with Russia, and knows more even than the Indian\ngovernment about what goes on beyond India's northern frontier. She\nmakes and magnifies the whole into a mystery; and her dance that night\nexpressed the fascination mystery has for her.\n\nAnd then she sang. It is her added gift of song that makes Yasmini\nunique, for she can sing in any of a dozen languages, and besides the\nlove-songs that come southward from the hills, she knows all the\ninterminable ballads of the South and the Central Provinces. But when,\nas that evening, she is at her best, mixing magic under the eyes of the\ninquisitive, she sings songs of her own making and only very rarely the\nsame song twice. She sang that night of the winds of the world which,\nshe claims, carry the news to her; although others say her sources of\ninformation speak more distinctly.\n\nIt seemed that the thread of an idea ran through song and dance alike,\nand that the hillmen and beyond-the-hills-men, who sat back-to-the-wall\nand watched, could follow the meaning of it. They began to crowd\ncloser, to squat cross-legged on the floor, in circles one outside the\nother, until the European three became the center of three rings of men\nwho stared at them with owls' solemnity.\n\nThen Yasmini ceased dancing. Then one of the Europeans drew his watch\nout; and he had to show it to the other two before he could convince\nthem that they had sat for two hours without wanting to do anything but\nwatch and listen.\n\n\"So _wass!_\" said one of them--the drunken.\n\n_\"Du lieber Gott--schon halb zwolf!\"_ said the second.\n\nThe third man made no remark at all. He was watching Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThe risaldar--major had left the divan by the end wall and walked--all\ngrim straight lines in contrast to Yasmini's curves--to a spot directly\nfacing the three Europeans; and it seemed there sat a hillman on the\npiece of floor he coveted.\n\n\"Get up!\" he commanded. \"Make room!\"\n\nThe hillman did not budge, for an Afridi pretends to feel for a Sikh\nthe scorn that a Sikh feels truly for Afridis. The flat of Ranjoor\nSingh's foot came to his assistance, and the hillman budged. In an\ninstant he was on his feet, with a lightning right hand reaching for\nhis knife.\n\nBut Yasmini allows no butcher's work on her premises, and her words\nwithin those walls are law, since no man knows who is on whose side.\nYasmini beckoned him, and the Afridi slouched toward her sullenly. She\nwhispered something, and he started for the stairs at once, without any\nfurther protest.\n\nThen there vanished all doubt as to which of the three Europeans was\nmost important. The man who had come in first had accepted sherbet from\nthe maid who sat beside him; he went suddenly from drowsiness to\nslumber, and the woman spurned his bullet-head away from her shoulder,\nletting him fall like a log among the cushions. The stout second man\nlooked frightened and sat nursing helpless hands. But the third man sat\nforward, and tense silence fell on the assembly as the eyes of every\nman sought his.\n\nOnly Yasmini, hovering in the background, had time to watch anything\nother than those gray European eyes; she saw that they were interested\nmost in Ranjoor Singh, and the maids who noticed her expression of\nsweet innocence knew that she was thinking fast.\n\n\"You are a Sikh?\" said the gray-eyed man; and the crowd drew in its\nbreath, for he spoke Hindustani with an accent that very few achieve,\neven with long practise.\n\n\"Then you are of a brave nation--you will understand me. The Sikhs are\na martial race. Their theory of politics is based on the military\nspirit--is it not so?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh, who understood and tried to live the Sikh religion with\nall his gentlemanly might, was there to acquire information, not to\nimpart it. He grunted gravely.\n\n\"All martial nations expand eventually. They tell me--I have\nheard--some of you Sikhs have tried Canada?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh did not wince, though his back stiffened when the men\naround him grinned; it is a sore point with the Sikhs that Canada does\nnot accept their emigrants.\n\n\"Sikhs are admitted into all the German colonies,\" said the man with\nthe gray eyes. \"They are welcome.\"\n\n\"Do many go?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"That is the point. The Sikhs want a place in the sun from which they\nare barred at present--eh? Now, Germany--\"\n\n\"Germany? Where is Germany?\" asked Yasmini. She understands the last\ntrick in the art of getting a story on its way. \"To the west is\nEngland. Farther west, Ameliki. To the north lies Russia. To the south\nthe _kali pani_-ocean. Where is Germany?\"\n\nThe man with the gray eyes took her literally, since his nation are not\nslow at seizing opportunity. He launched without a word more of\npreliminary into a lecture on Germany that lasted hours and held his\naudience spellbound. It was colorful, complete, and it did not seem to\nhave been memorized. But that was art.\n\nHe had no word of blame for England. He even had praise, when praise\nmade German virtue seem by that much greater; and the inference from\nfirst to last was of German super-virtue.\n\nSome one in the crowd--who bore a bullet-mark in proof he did not\njest--suggested to him that the British army was the biggest and\nfiercest in the world. So he told them of a German army, millions\nstrong, that marched in league--long columns--an army that guarded by\nthe prosperous hundred thousand factory chimneys that smoked until the\ncentral European sky was black.\n\nLong, long after midnight, in a final burst of imagination, he likened\nGermany to a bee--hive from which a swarm must soon emerge for lack of\nroom inside. And he proved, then, that he knew he had made an\nimpression on them, for he dismissed them with an impudence that would\nhave set them laughing at him when he first began to speak.\n\n\"Ye have my leave to go!\" he said, as if he owned the place; and they\nall went except one.\n\n\"That is a lot of talk,\" said Ranjoor Singh, when the last man had\nstarted for the stairs. \"What does it amount to? When will the bees\nswarm?\"\n\nThe German eyed him keenly, but the Sikh's eyes did not flinch.\n\n\"What is your rank?\" the German asked.\n\n\"Squadron leader!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nThe two stood up, and now there was no mistake about the German's\nheels; they clicked. The two were almost of a height, although the\nSikh's head--dress made him seem the taller. They were both unusually\nfine--looking men, and limb for limb they matched.\n\n\"If war were in Europe you would be taken there to fight,\" said the\nGerman.\n\nRanjoor Singh showed no surprise.\n\n\"Whether you wanted to fight or not.\"\n\nThere was no hint of laughter in the Sikh's brown eyes.\n\n\"Germany has no quarrel with the Sikhs.\"\n\n\"I have heard of none,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Wherever the German flag should fly, after a war, the Sikhs would have\nfree footing.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh looked interested, even pleased.\n\n\"Who is not against Germany is for her.\"\n\n\"Let us have plain words' said Ranjoor Singh, leading the way to a\ncorner in which he judged they could not be overheard; there he turned\nsuddenly, borrowing a trick from Yasmini.\n\n\"I am a Sikh--a patriot. What are you offering?\"\n\n\"The freedom of the earth!\" the German answered. \"Self--government! The\nright to emigrate. Liberty!\"\n\n\"On what condition? For a bargain has two sides.\"\n\n\"That the Sikhs fail England!\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When the time comes! What is the answer?\"\n\n\"I will answer when the time comes,\" answered Ranjoor Singh, saluting\nstiffly before turning on his heel.\n\nThen he stalked out of the room, with a slight bow to Yasmini as he\npassed.\n\n\"Buffalo!\" she murmured after him. \"Jat buffalo!\"\n\nThen the Germans went away, after some heavy compliments that seemed to\namuse Yasmini prodigiously, helping along the man who had drunk sherbet\nand who now seemed inclined to weep. They dragged him down the stairs\nbetween them, backward. Yasmini waited at the stair--head until she\nheard them pull him into a _gharri_ and drive away. Then she turned to\nher favorite maid.\n\n\"Them--those cattle--I understand!\" she said. \"But it does not suit me\nthat a Sikh, a Jat, a buffalo, should come here making mysteries of his\nown without consulting me! And what does not suit me I do not tolerate!\nGo, get that Afridi whom the soldier kicked--I told him to wait outside\nin the street until I sent for him.\"\n\nThe Afridi came, nearly as helpless as the man who had drunk sherbet,\nthough less tearful and almost infinitely more resentful. What clothing\nhad not been torn from him was soaked in blood, and there was no inch\nof him that was not bruised.\n\n\"Krishna!\" said Yasmini impiously.\n\n\"Allah!\" swore the Afridi.\n\n\"Who did it? What has happened?\"\n\n\"Outside in the street I said to some men who waited that Ranjoor Singh\nthe Sikh is a bastard. From then until now they beat me, only leaving\noff to follow him hence when he came out through the door!\"\n\nYasmini laughed, peal upon peal of silver laughter--of sheer merriment.\n\n\"The gods love Yasmini!\" she chuckled. \"Aye, the gods love me! The Jat\nspoke of a squadron; it is evident that he spoke truth. So his squadron\nwatched him here! Go, _jungli_! Go, wash the blood away. Thou shalt\nhave revenge! Come again to--morrow. Nay, go now, I would sleep when I\nhave finished laughing. Aye--the gods love Yasmini!\"\n\n\n  The West Wind blows through the Ajmere Gate\n    And whispers low (Oh, listen ye!),\n  \"The fed wolf curls by his drowsy mate\n  In a tight--trod earth; but the lean wolves wait,\n    And the hunger gnaws!\" (Oh, listen ye!)\n  \"Can fed wolves fight? But yestere'en\n  Their eyes were bright, their fangs were clean;\n  They viewed, they took but yestere'en,\"\n    (Oh, listen, wise heads, listen ye!)\n  \"Because they fed, is blood less red,\n  Or fangs less sharp, or hunger dead?\"\n    (Look well to the loot, and listen ye!)\n\nYASMINI'S SONG\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe colonel of Outram's Own dropped into a club where he was only one,\nand not the greatest, of many men entitled to respect. There were three\nmen talking by a window, their voices drowned by the din of rain on the\nveranda roof, each of whom nodded to him. He chose, however, a solitary\nchair, for, though subalterns do not believe it, a colonel has exactly\nthat diffidence about approaching senior civilians which a subaltern\nought to feel.\n\nIn a moment all that was visible of him from the door was a pair of\nbrown riding-boots, very much fore-shortened, resting on the long arm\nof a cane chair, and two sets of wonderfully modeled fingers that held\nup a newspaper. From the window where the three men talked he could be\nseen in profile.\n\n\"Wears well--doesn't he?\" said one of them.\n\n\"Swears well, too, confound him!\"\n\n\"Hah! Been trying to pump him, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's like a big bird catching flies--picks off your questions one\nat a time, with one eye on you and the other one cocked for the next\nquestion. Get nothing out of him but yes or no. Good fellow, though,\nwhen you're not drawing him.\"\n\n\"You mean trying to draw him. He's the best that come. Wish they were\nall like Kirby.\"\n\nThe man who had not spoken yet--he looked younger, was some years\nolder, and watched the faces of the other two while seeming to listen\nto something in the distance--looked at a cheap watch nervously.\n\n\"Wish the Sikhs were all like Kirby!\" he said. \"If this business comes\nto a head, we're going to wish we had a million Kirbys. What did he\nsay? Temper of his men excellent, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Used that one word.\" \"Um-m-m! No suspicions, eh?\" \"Said, 'No, no\nsuspicions!'\" \"Uh! I'll have a word with him.\" He waddled off, shaking\nhis drab silk suit into shape and twisting a leather watch-guard around\nhis finger.\n\n\"Believe it will come to anything?\" asked one of the two men he had\nleft behind.\n\n\"Dunno. Hope not. Awful business if it does.\"\n\n\"Remember how we were promised a world-war two years ago, just before\nthe Balkans took fire?\"\n\n\"Yes. That was a near thing, too. But they weren't quite ready then.\nNow they are ready, and they think we're not. If I were asked, I'd say\nwe ought to let them know we're ready for 'em. They want to fight\nbecause they think they can catch us napping; they'd think twice if\nthey knew they couldn't do it.\"\n\n\"Are they blind and deaf? Can't they see and hear?\"\n\n\"_Quern deus vult perdere, prius dementat_, Ponsonby, my boy.\"\n\nThe man in drab silk slipped into a chair next to Kirby's as a wolf\nslips into his lair, very circumspectly, and without noise; then he\nrutched the chair sidewise toward Kirby with about as much noise as a\ncompany of infantry would make.\n\n\"Had a drink?\" he asked, as Kirby looked up from his paper. \"Have one?\"\n\n\"Ginger ale, please,\" said Kirby, putting the paper down.\n\nA turbaned waiter brought long glasses in which ice tinkled, and the\ntwo sipped slowly, not looking at each other.\n\n\"Know Yasmini?\" asked the man in drab silk suddenly.\n\n\"Heard of her, of course.\"\n\n\"Ever see her?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ah! Most extraordinary woman. Wonderful!\"\n\nKirby looked puzzled, and held his peace.\n\n\"Any of your officers ever visit her?\"\n\n\"Not when they're supposed to be on duty.\"\n\n\"But at other times?\"\n\n\"None of my affair if they do. Don't know, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby, without vehemence.\n\n\"Look at his beak!\" said one of the two men by the window. \"Never see a\nbig bird act that way? Look at his bright eye!\"\n\n\"Wish mine were as bright, and my beak as aquiline; means\ndirectness--soldierly directness, that does!\"\n\n\"Who is your best native officer, supposing you've any choice?\" asked\nthe man in the drab silk suit, speaking to the ceiling apparently.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh,\" said Kirby promptly.\n\nIt was quite clear there was no doubt in his mind.\n\n\"How is he best? In what way?\"\n\n\"Best man I've got. Fit to command the regiment.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\nThe man in drab sat sidewise and caught Kirby's eye, which was not\ndifficult. There was nothing furtive about him.\n\n\"With a censorship that isn't admitted, but which has been rather\nobvious for more than a month; with all forces undergoing field\ntraining during the worst of the rains--it's fair to suppose your men\nsmell something?\"\n\n\"They've been sweating, certainly.\"\n\n\"Do they smell a rat?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ask questions?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you tell them?\"\n\n\"That I don't know, and they must wait until I do.\"\n\n\"Any recent efforts been made to tamper with them?\"\n\n\"Not more than I reported. You know, of course, of the translations\nfrom Canadian papers, discussing the rejection of Sikh immigrants? Each\nman received a copy through the mail.\"\n\n\"Yes. We caught the crowd who printed that. Couldn't discover, though,\nhow it got into the regiment's mail bags without being postmarked.\nLet's see--wasn't Ranjoor Singh officer-of-the-day?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m! Would it surprise you to know that Ranjoor Singh visits\nYasmini?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't interest me.\"\n\n\"What follows is in strict confidence, please.\"\n\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\n\"I want you to hear reason. India, the whole of India, mind, has its\near to the ground. All up and down the length of the land--in every\nbazaar--in the ranks of every native regiment--it's known that people\nrepresenting some other European Power are trying to sow discontent\nwith our rule; and it's obvious to any native that we're on the watch\nfor something big that we expect to break any minute. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Our strongest card is the loyalty of the native troops.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows that. Also, this thing we're looking for is most\ndamnably real--might burst to-day, to-morrow--any time. So, even with\nthe censorship in working order, it wouldn't be wise to arrest a native\nofficer merely on suspicion.\"\n\n\"I'd arrest one of mine,\" said Kirby, \"if I had any reason to suspect\nhim for a second.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't be wise! You mustn't!\" The man in drab silk shook his head.\n\"Now, suppose you were to arrest Ranjoor Singh--\"\n\nKirby laughed outright.\n\n\"Suppose the Chandni Chowk were Regent Street!\" he jeered.\n\n\"Last night,\" said the man in drab silk, \"Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh\nvisited Yasmini, leaving six or more of the men of his squadron waiting\nfor him in the street outside. In Yasmini's room he listened for hours\nto a lecture on Germany, delivered by a German who has British\nnaturalization papers, whether forged or not is not yet clear.\n\n\"After the lecture he had a private conversation lasting some minutes\nwith the German who says he is an Englishman, and who, by the way,\nspeaks Hindustani like a native. And, before he started home, his men\nwho waited in the street thrashed an Afridi within an inch of his life\nfor threatening to report Ranjoor Singh's presence at the lecture to\nthe authorities.\"\n\n\"Who told you this?\" asked Colonel Kirby.\n\n\"The Afridi, Yasmini, and three hillmen who were there by invitation. I\nspoke with them all less than an hour ago. They all agree. But if\nRanjoor Singh were asked about it, he would lie himself out of it in\nany of a dozen ways, and would be on his guard in future. If he were\narrested, it would bring to a head what may prove to be a passing\ntrifle; it would make the men angry, and the news would spread,\nwhatever we might do to prevent it.\"\n\n\"What am I to understand that you want, then?\" asked Kirby.\n\n\"Watch him closely, without letting him suspect it.\"\n\n\"Before I'd seriously consider orders to do that, they'd have to come\nthrough military channels in the regular way,\" said Kirby, without\nemotion.\n\n\"I could arrange that, of course. I'll mention it to Todhunter.\"\n\n\"And if the order reached me in the regular way, I'd resign rather than\ncarry it out.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!\" said the man in drab silk.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"You seem to forget that I, too, represent a government department, and\nhave the country's interests at heart. Do you imagine I have a grudge\nagainst Ranjoor Singh?\"\n\n\"I forget nothing of the kind,\" said Kirby, \"and imagination doesn't\nenter into it. I know Ranjoor Singh, and that's enough. If he's a\ntraitor, so am I. If he's not a loyal gallant officer, then I'm not\neither. I'll stand or fall by his honor, for I know the man and you\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Uh!\" said the man in drab silk.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Colonel Kirby.\n\n\"Look!\" said one of the two men at the window. \"Direct as a hornet's\nsting--isn't a kink in him! Look at the angle of his chin!\"\n\n\"You can tell his Sikh officers; they imitate him.\"\n\n\"Do I understand you to refuse me point--blank?\" asked the man in the\ndrab suit, still fidgeting with his watch--guard. Perhaps he guessed\nthat two men in the window were discussing him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"I shall have to go over your head.\"\n\n\"Understand me, then. If an order of that kind reaches me, I shall\narrest Ranjoor Singh at once, so that he may stand trial and be cleared\nlike a gentleman. I'll have nothing done to one of my officers that\nwould be intolerable if done to me, so long as I command the regiment!\"\n\n\"What alternative do you suggest?\" asked the man in gray, with a wry\nface.\n\n\"Ask Ranjoor Singh about it.\"\n\n\"Who? You or I?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't answer you.\"\n\n\"Then ask him yourself. But I shall remember, Colonel Kirby, that you\ndid not oblige me in the matter.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Kirby,\n\n\"Another drink?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"Who won?\" asked one of the two men in the window.\n\n\"Kirby!\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I've been watching his face. He's the least bit\nrattled. It's somebody else who has won; he's been fighting another\nman's battle. But it's obvious who lost--look at that watch-chain\ngoing! Come away.\"\n\n\n_If a man has a price at all, his price is neither high nor low, but\njust that price that you will pay him._\n\nNATIVE PROVERB.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nOf course an Afridi can be depended on to overdo anything. The\nparticular Afridi whom Ranjoor Singh had kicked was able to see very\nlittle virtue in Yasmin's method of attack. Suckled in a mountain-range\nwhere vengeance is believed as real and worthy as love must be\ntransitory, his very bowels ached for physical retaliation, just as his\nskin and bones smarted from the beating the risaldar-major's men had\ngiven him.\n\nHe was scoffed at by small boys as he slunk through byways of the big\nbazaar. A woman who had smiled at him but a day ago now emptied\nunseemly things on him from an upper story when he went to moan beneath\nher window. He decided to include that woman in his vengeance, too, if\npossible, but not to miss Ranjoor Singh on her account; there was not\nroom for him and Ranjoor Singh on one rain-pelted earth, but, if needs\nmust, the woman might wait a while.\n\nAs nearly all humans do when their mood is similar to his, he slunk\ninto dark places, growling like a dog and believing all the world his\nenemy. He came very near to the summit of exasperation when, on making\napplication at a free dispensary, his sores were dressed for him by a\nHindu assistant apothecary who lectured him on brotherly love with\ninterlarded excerpts from Carlyle done into Hindustani. But the climax\ncame when a native policeman poked him in the ribs with a truncheon and\nordered him out of sight.\n\nWith a snarl that would have done credit to a panther driven off its\nprey, he slunk up a byway to shelter himself and think of new\nobscenities; and as he stood beneath a cloth awning to await the\npassing of a more than usually heavy downpour, the rotten fibers burst\nat last and let ten gallons of filthy rain down on him.\n\nFrom that minute he could see only red; so it was in a red haze that\ntwo of the troopers from Ranjoor Singh's squadron passed the end of the\nlane. He felt himself clutching at a red knife, breathing red air\nthrough distended nostrils. He forgot his sores; forgot to feel them.\n\nAs he hunted the two troopers through the maze of streets, he\nrecognized them for two of the men who had thrashed him; so he drew\ncloser, for fear they might escape him in the crowd. Now that he no\nlonger wandered objectless, but looked ahead and walked with a will and\na purpose, street-corner \"constabeels\" ceased to trouble him; there\nwere too many people in those thronged, kaleidoscopic streets for any\nbut the loafers to be noticed. He drew nearer and nearer to the\ntroopers, all unsuspected.\n\nBut the pace was fast, and they approached their barracks, where his\nchance of ramming a knife into them and getting away unseen would be\nincreasingly more remote; and he had no desire to die until he had\nkilled the other four men, Ranjoor Singh himself, and the woman who had\nspurned his love. He must kill these two, he decided, while yet safe\nfrom barrack hue and cry.\n\nHe crept yet closer, and--now that his plan was forming in his\nmind-began to see less red. In a minute more he recognized a house at a\nstreet corner, whose lower story once had been a shop, but that now was\nboarded up and showed from outside little sign of occupation. But he\nsaw that the door at the end of an alley by the building was ajar, and\nthrough a chink between the shutters of an upper story his keen\nnorthern eyes detected lamp-light. That was enough. He set his teeth\nand drew his long clean knife.\n\nWounds, bruises, pain, all mean nothing to a hillman when there is\nmurder in his eye, unless they be spurs that goad him to greater frenzy\nand more speed. The troopers swaggered at a drilled man's marching\npace; the Afridi came like a wind--devil, ripping down a gully from the\nnorthern hills, all frenzy.\n\nHad he not seen red again, had only a little brain--work mingled in his\nrage, he would have scored a clean victory and have been free to wreak\nred vengeance on the rest. As it was, rage mastered him, and he yelled\nas he drove the long knife home between the shoulders of one of the\ntroopers in front of him.\n\nThat yell was a mistake, for he was dealing with picked, drilled men of\nbirth and a certain education. The struck man sank to his knees, but\nthe other turned in time to guard the next blow with his forearm; he\nseized a good fistful of the Afridi's bandages and landed hard on his\nnaked foot with the heel of an ammunition boot. The Afridi screamed\nlike a wild beast as he wrenched himself away, leaving the bandages in\nthe trooper's hand; and for an instant the trooper half turned to\nsuccor his comrade.\n\n\"Nay, after him!\" urged the wounded man in the Jat tongue; and, seeing\na crowd come running from four directions, the Sikh let him lie, to\nrace after the Afridi.\n\nHe caught little more than a glimpse of torn clothes disappearing\nthrough the little door at the end of the alley by the boarded shop,\nand a second after he had started in pursuit he saw the door shut with\na slam and thought he heard a bolt snick home.\n\nThe door, though small, looked stout, and, thinking as he charged to\nthe assault, the Sikh put all the advantage he had of weight, and\nsteel-shod boots, and strength, and speed into the effort. A yard from\nthe door he took off, as a man does at the broad jump in the\ninter-regimental sports, landing against the lower panel with his heels\ntwo feet from the bottom.\n\nThe door went inward as if struck by a blast of dynamite, and the\nSikh's head struck a flagstone. Long strong arms seized him by the feet\nand dragged him inside. Then the door closed again, and this time a\nbolt really did shoot home, to be followed by two others and a bar that\nfitted vertically into the beam above and the floor beneath.\n\nOutside, thirty feet from the street corner, the crowd came together as\na tide-race meets amid the rocks, roaring, shouting, surging, swaying\nback and forth, nine-tenths questioning at the limit of its lungs, and\none-tenth yelling information that was false before they had it. Those\nat the back believed already that there were ten men down. In the next\nstreet there was supposed to be a riot. And the shrill repeated whistle\nof the nearest policeman summoning help confirmed the crowd in its\nbelief, besides convincing it of new atrocities as yet unguessed.\n\nOnly one man in the crowd had wit enough to carry the tale to barracks\nwhere it might be expected to produce action. He was a Bengali babu,\nbare of leg and fat of paunch, who had enough imagination to conceive\nof a regiment in receipt of the news, and the mental picture so\nappealed to him that he held his protruding stomach in both hands while\nhe ran down-street like a landslide, his mouth agape and his eyes all\nbut popping from his head.\n\nHe reached the barrack gate speechless and breathless, just as Ranjoor\nSingh rode up on Bagh, mud-plastered after an afternoon's work teaching\nscouts. He clung to the risaldar-major's stirrup, and was dragged ten\nfeet, slobbering and bubbling incoherencies, before the savage charger\ncould be reined in and made to stand.\n\n\"What is it, oh, _babuji?_\" laughed Ranjoor Singh. \"Are the Moslems out\nafter your temple gods?\"\n\n\"Aha! Run! Gallop! Bring all the guns!\" This in English, all of it.\n\"Blood in the gutter--blood like water--twentee policemen are already\ndead, and your men have done it! Gallop quicklee. _Jaldee, jaldee!_\"\n\n\"Go and get twenty more policemen to wipe away the blood!\" advised\nRanjoor Singh, sitting back in the saddle to get a better look at him,\nand reining back the impatient Bagh. \"I am not a constabeel; I am a\nsoldier.\"\n\n\"Aha! Yes. You better hurry. All your men are\nunderneath--what-you-call-it?--bottom dog. You better hurry like\nslippery! One Afridi is beginning things, and where is one Afridi with\na long knife are many more kinds of trouble!\"\n\nThe babu was recovering his breath, and with it his yearning to behold\na regiment careering through the barrack gate to the rescue. He still\nclung to the stirrup, and since he would not let go, Ranjoor Singh\nproceeded to tow him, with a cautious, booted right leg ready to spur\nBagh away to the left should the brute commence to kick.\n\n\"You are hard-hearted person, and your fate is forever sealed if you\nrefuse to listen!\" wailed the babu. \"The blood of your men lies in\nstreet calling aloud for vengeance!\" A university education works\nwonders for babu vocabulary. \"I tell you it is a riot, and most\nextremelee serious affair!\"\n\nThat was the wrong appeal to make, as the babu himself would have known\nhad he been less excited. In time of riot the place for a Sikh officer\nwould be at the regiment's headquarters, in readiness for the order\nfrom a civil magistrate without which interference would cost him his\ncommission. But the babu was beside himself, what with breathlessness\nand disappointment. He decided it was expedient to strengthen his\nappeal, and his imagination was still working.\n\n\"There will be two regiments of Tommees--drunken Tommees, presentlee.\nThey will take your men to jail. The Tommees are already on the way.\nShould they get there first your men will be everlastinglee disgraced\nas well as muleted. You should hurry.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh ceased from frowning and looked satisfied. If there were\ntrouble enough in the bazaar to call for the despatch of British\nsoldiers to the scene, then nothing in the world was more certain than\nthat any men of his who happened to be in danger would be rescued with\nneatness and speed. If there was no trouble yet, there would very\nlikely be some swearing when the soldiers got there. In the meantime he\nwas wet through, both with rain and perspiration. The thought of a bath\nand dry clothes urged him like the voice of a siren calling; and he had\nshown the babu all the courtesy his Sikh creed and profession demanded.\n\nSo he clucked to Bagh, and the big brute plunged into a canter, just as\neager for his sais and gram as his master was for clean dry clothes.\nFor two strides the babu clung to the stirrup, wrenching it free from\nthe risaldar-major's foot; then the horse grew savage at the\nunaccustomed extra weight, and lashed out hard behind him, missing the\nbabu twice in quick succession, but filling him full to the stuttering\nteeth with fear. Ranjoor Singh touched the horse with his right spur,\nand in a second the babu lay along on his stomach in the mud.\n\nHe lay for a minute, believing himself dead. Then he cried aloud, since\nhe knew he must be broken into pieces. Then he felt himself. At last he\nrose, and after a speechless glance at the back of the risaldar-major,\nstarted slowly along the street toward where the \"riot\" was.\n\n\"It is enough,\" he said in English, since he was a \"failed B.A.,\" \"to\ntry the patience of Job's comforter. This militaree business has\ncorrupted even Sikh cavalry until they no longer are dependable. Yes.\nIt is time! It is time indeed that German influence be felt, in order\nthat British yoke may be cast off for good and all. Now I take it a\nGerman soldier would have arrested everybodee, and I would have\nreceived much _kudos_ in addition to cash reward paid for information.\nIn meantime, it is to be seen whether or not--yes, precisely--a pencil\nis mightier than a sword, which means that a babu is superior in wit\nand general attainments. Let us see!\"\n\nHe began to run again, at a truly astonishing pace, considering his\npaunch and all-round ungainliness, getting over the ground faster than\nmany a thin man could have done. As he ran his lips worked, for though\nhe had no breath to spare for speech, his brain was forming words that\ncrowded for expression.\n\n\"The Sikhs!\" he screamed, as he came within earshot of the milling\ncrowd, through which four small policemen were trying to force a path.\n\"The Sikhs! They ride to the rescue!\"\n\n\"The Sikhs!\" yelled somebody on the edge of the crowd, who had more\nbreath but not enough imagination to ask questions. \"The Sikhs are\ncoming! Run!\"\n\n\"The Sikhs! The Sikhs!\"\n\nThe crowd took it up. And since it was a crowd, and there was nothing\nelse to do; and since it had had protection but no violence at Sikh\nhands ever since '57; and since the babu really did look frightened, it\nshouted that the Sikhs were coming until it believed the news and had\nmade itself thoroughly afraid.\n\n\"Run, brothers!\" shouted some man in the middle who owned a voice like\na bull-buffalo's. And that being a new idea and just as good as any,\nthe whole crowd took to its heels, leaving the four policemen staring\nat the body of a dead Sikh, and the fat babu complacently regarding all\nof them.\n\nPresently a European police officer trotted up on a white pony,\nexamined the body, asked a dozen questions of the four policemen, wrote\nin his memorandum book, and ordered the body to be taken to the morgue.\n\n\"Come here, you!\" he called to the babu.\n\nSo the babu waddled to him, judging his salaam shrewdly so that it\nsuggested deference while leaving no doubt as to the intended insult.\n\n\"What do you know about this?\"\n\n\"As peaceful citizen in pursuance of daily bread and other perquisites,\nI claim protection of police! While proceeding on way was thrown to\nground violentlee by galloping horse whose rider urged same in opposite\ndirection. Observe my deshabille. Regard this mud on my person. I\ninsist on full rigor of the law for which I am taxed inordinately.\"\n\n\"What sort of a horse? Who rode it? How long ago?\"\n\n\"Am losing all count of time since being overwhelmed. Should say veree\nrecently, however. The horse was ridden by a person who urged it\nvehemently. It was a brown horse, I think.\"\n\n\"Which way did he go?\"\n\n\"How should I know? He went away, knocking me over in transit and\ncausing me great distress.\"\n\n\"Was he armed?\"\n\n\"Two arms. With one he steered the animal. With the other he urged him,\nthus.\"\n\nThe babu described in pantomime an imaginary human riding for his life,\nwhom not even the adroitest police officer could recognize as Ranjoor\nSingh, even had he been acquainted with the risaldar-major.\n\n\"Had he a weapon of any kind?\"\n\n\"Not knowing, would prefer to say nothing about that. It was with the\nhorse--with the rump of the animal that he hit me, and not with a sword\nof any kind.\"\n\n\"Well, you had better come with me to the office, and there we'll take\ndown your deposition.\"\n\n\"Am I arrested?\"\n\n\"No. You're a witness.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am prosecutor! I demand as stated formerly full\nrigor of the law. I demand capture and arrest, together with fine and\nimprisonment of party assaulting me, failing which I shall address\ncomplaint to government!\"\n\n\"Come along. We'll talk about that at the office.\"\n\nSo the babu was escorted to the stuffy little police office, where he\nwas made to sit on a bench beside ten native witnesses of other crimes;\nand presently he was called to a desk at which a native clerk presided.\nThere he was made to recite his story again, and since he had had time\nin which to think, he told a most amazing, disconnected yarn that\nlooked even more untruthful by the time the clerk had written his own\nversion of it on a sheet. To this version the babu was required to\nswear, and he did so without a blink.\n\nThen there was more delay, while somebody was found who knew him and\ncould certify to his address, and it was nearly evening by the time he\nwas allowed to go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was also nearly evening when a messenger arrived at the barracks to\nreport the death of a Sikh trooper by murder in the bazaar. The man's\nname and regimental number proved him to have been one of D Squadron's\nmen, and since its commander, Ranjoor Singh, was then in quarters, the\nnews was brought to him at once.\n\n\"Killed where?\" he demanded; so they told him.\n\n\"Exactly when?\"\n\nIt became evident to Ranjoor Singh that there had been some truth after\nall in the babu's tale. The verbal precis of the only witness, given\nfrom memory, about a man who galloped away on horseback, threw no light\nat all on the case; so, because he could think of nothing better to do\nat the moment, the risaldar-major sent for a _tikka-gharri_ and drove\ndown to the morgue to identify the body.\n\nOn the way back from the morgue he looked in at the police station, but\nthe babu had been gone some ten minutes when he arrived.\n\nThe police could tell him nothing. It was explained that the crowd\ndirectly after the murder had been too great to allow any but those\nnearest to see anything; and it was admitted that the crowd had been\nsuddenly panic-stricken and had scattered before the police could\nsecure witnesses. So he drove away, wondering, and ordered the driver\nto follow the road taken by the murdered trooper.\n\nIt was just on the edge of evening, when the lighted street-lamps were\nyet too pale to show distinctly, that he passed the disused boarded\nshop and saw, on the side of the street opposite, the babu who had\nbrought him the story of riot that afternoon. He stopped his carriage\nand stepped out. On second thought he ordered the carriage away, for he\nwas in plain clothes and not likely to attract notice; and he had a\nsuspicion in his mind that he might care to investigate a little on his\nown account. He walked straight to the babu, and that gentleman eyed\nhim with obvious distrust.\n\n\"Did you see my trooper murdered?\" he demanded; for he had learned\ndirectness under Colonel Kirby, and applied it to every difficulty that\nconfronted him.\n\nNatives understand directness from an Englishman, and can parry it; but\nfrom another native it bewilders them, just as a left-handed swordsman\nis bewildered by another left-hander. The babu blinked.\n\n\"How much had you seen when you ran to warn me this afternoon?\"\n\nThe babu looked pitiful. His fat defenseless body was an absolute\ncontrast to the Sikh's tall manly figure. His eye was furtive, glancing\never sidewise; but the Sikh looked straight and spoke abruptly though\nwith a note of kindness in his voice.\n\n\"There is no need to fear me,\" he said, since the babu would not\nanswer. \"Speak! How much do you know?\"\n\nSo the babu took heart of grace, producing a voice from somewhere down\nin his enormous stomach and saying, of course, the very last thing\nexpected of him.\n\n\"Grief chokes me!\" he asserted.\n\n\"Take care that I choke thee not, _babuji_! I have asked a question. I\nam no lawyer to maneuver for my answer. Did you see that trooper\nkilled?\"\n\nThe babu nodded; but his nod was not much more than tentative. He could\nhave denied it next minute without calling much on his imagination.\n\n\"Oh! Which way went the murderer?\"\n\n\"Grief overwhelms me!\" said the babu.\n\n\"Grief for what?\"\n\n\"For my money--my good money--my emoluments!\"\n\nDirect as an arrow though he was in all his dealings, Ranjoor Singh had\nnot forgotten how the Old East thinks. He recognized the preliminaries\nof a bargain, and searched his mind to recall how much money he had\nwith him; to have searched his pocket would have been too puerile.\n\n\"What of them?\"\n\n\"Lost!\"\n\n\"Where? How?\"\n\n\"While standing here, observing movements of him whom I suspected to be\nmurderer, a person unknown--possibly a Sikh--perhaps not--removed money\nsurreptitiously from my person.\"\n\n\"How much money?\"\n\n\"Rupees twenty-five, annas eight,\" said the babu unwinking. He neither\nblushed nor hesitated.\n\n\"I will take compassion on your loss and replace five rupees of it,\"\nsaid Ranjoor Singh, \"when you have told me which way the murderer went.\"\n\n\"My eyes are too dim, and my heart too full with grief,\" said the babu.\n\"No man's memory works under such conditions. Now, that money--\"\n\n\"I will give you ten rupees,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThis was too easy! The babu was prepared to bargain for an hour,\nfighting for rupee after rupee until his wit assured him he had reached\nthe limit. Now he began to believe he had set the limit far too low.\n\n\"I do not remember,\" he said slowly but with great conviction,\nscratching at his stomach as if he kept his recollections stored there.\n\n\"You said twenty-five rupees, eight annas? Well, I will pay the half of\nit, and no more,\" said Ranjoor Singh in a new voice that seemed to\nsuggest unutterable things. \"Moreover, I will pay it when I have proved\nthy memory true. Now, scratch that belly of thine and let the thoughts\ncome forth!\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib, I forget.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh drew out his purse and counted twelve rupees and three\nquarters into the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Which way?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Twenty-five rupees, eight annas of earned emolument--gone while I\nwatched the movements of a murderer! It is not easy to keep brave heart\nand remember things!\"\n\n\"See here, thou bellyful of memories! Remember and tell me, or I return\nthis money to my purse and march thee by the nape of thy fat neck to\nthe police station, where they will put thee in a cell for the night\nand jog thy memory in ways the police are said to understand! Speak!\nHere, take the money!\"\n\nThe babu reached out a fat hand and the silver changed owners.\n\n\"There!\" said the babu, jerking a thumb over his right shoulder.\n\"Through that door!\"\n\n\"That narrow teak door, down the passage?\"\n\nBut the babu was gone, hurrying as if goaded by fear of hell and all\nits angels.\n\nRanjoor Singh strode across the street in a bee-line and entered the\ndark passage. He had seen the yellow light of a lamp-flame through a\nchink in an upper shutter, and he intended to try directness on the\nproblem once again. It was ten full paces down the passage to the door;\nhe counted them, finishing the last one with a kick against the panel\nthat would have driven it in had it been less than teak.\n\nThere came no answer, so he kicked again. Then he beat on the door with\nhis clenched fists. Presently he turned his back to the door and kept\nup a steady thunder on it with his heels. And then, after about five\nminutes, he heard movement within.\n\nHe congratulated himself then that the noise he had made had called the\nattention of passers-by and of all the neighbors, and though he had had\nno fear and no other intention than to enter the house at all costs, he\ncertainly had that much less compunction now.\n\nHe heard three different bolts drawn back, and then there was a pause.\nHe thought he heard whispering, so he resumed his thunder. Almost at\nonce there followed the unmistakable squeak of a big beam turning on\nits pivot, and the door opened about an inch.\n\nHe pushed, but some one inside pushed harder, and the door closed\nagain. So Ranjoor Singh leaned all his weight and strength against the\ndoor, drawing in his breath and shoving with all his might. Resistance\nceased. The door flew inward, as it had done once before that day, and\nclosed with a bang behind him.\n\n\n  Long were the days and oh! wicked the weather--\n    Endless and thankless the round--\n  Grinding God's Grit into rookies together;\n  I was the upper stone, he was the nether,\n    And Gad, sir, they groaned as we ground!\n  Bitter the blame (but he helped me to bear it),\n    Grim the despair that we ate!\n  But hell's loose! The dam's down, and none can repair it!\n  'Tis our turn! Go, summon my brother to share it!\n    His squadron's at arms, and we wait!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nA regiment is more exacting of its colonel than ever was lady of her\nlord; the more truly he commands, the better it loves him, until at\nlast the regiment swallows him and he becomes part of it, in thought\nand word and deed. Distractions such as polo, pig-sticking,\ntiger-shooting are tolerable insofar as they steady his nerve and train\nhis hand and eye; to that extent they, too, subserve the regiment. But\na woman is a rival. So it is counted no sin against a cavalry colonel\nshould he be a bachelor.\n\nThere remained no virtue, then, in the eyes of Outram's Own for Colonel\nKirby to acquire; he had all that they could imagine, besides at least\na dozen they had not imagined before he came to them. There was not one\nblack-bearded gentleman who couched a lance behind him but believed\nColonel Kirby some sort of super-man; and, in return, Colonel Kirby\nfound the regiment so satisfying that there was not even a lady on the\nsky-line who could look forward to encroaching on the regiment's\npreserves.\n\nHis heart, his honor, and his rare ability were all the regiment's, and\nthe regiment knew it; so he was studied as is the lot of few. His\nservant knew which shoes he would wear on a Thursday morning, and would\nhave them ready; the mess-cook spiced the curry so exactly to his taste\nthat more than one cook-book claimed it to be a species apart and\nlabeled it with his name. If he frowned, the troopers knew somebody had\ntried to flatter him; if he smiled, the regiment grinned; and when his\nface lacked all expression, though his eyes were more than usually\nquick, officer, non-commissioned officer and man alike would sit tight\nin the saddle, so to speak, and gather up their reins.\n\nHis mood was recognized that afternoon as he drove back from the club\nwhile he was yet four hundred yards away, although twilight was closing\ndown. The waler mare--sixteen three and a half, with one white stocking\nand a blaze that could be seen from the sky-line--brought his big\ndog-cart through the street mud at a speed which would have insured the\narrest of the driver of a motor; but that, if anything, was a sign of\nordinary health.\n\nNor was the way he took the corner by the barrack gate, on one wheel,\nany criterion; he always did it, just as he never failed to acknowledge\nthe sentry's salute by raising his whip. It needed the observant eyes\nof Outram's Own to detect the rather strained calmness and the almost\ninhumanly active eye.\n\n\"Beware!\" called the sentry, while he was yet three hundred yards away.\n\"Be awake!\"\n\n\"Be awake! Be awake! Beware!\"\n\nThe warning went from lip to lip, troop to troop, from squadron stables\non to squadron stables, until six hundred men were ready for all\ncontingencies. A civilian might not have recognized the difference, but\nKirby's soldier servant awakened from his nap on the colonel's door-mat\nand straightened his turban in a hurry, perfectly well aware that there\nwas something in the wind.\n\nIt was too early to dress for dinner yet; too late to dress for games\nof any kind. The servant was nonplussed. He stood in silence, awaiting\norders that under ordinary circumstances, or at an ordinary hour, would\nhave been unnecessary. But for a while no orders came. The only sound\nin those extremely unmarried quarters was the steady drip of water into\na flat tin bath that the servant had put beneath a spot where the roof\nleaked; the rain had ceased but the ceiling cloth still drooped and\ndrooled.\n\nSuddenly Kirby threw himself backward into a long chair, and the\nservant made ready for swift action.\n\n\"Present my compliments to Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh sahib, and ask\nhim to be good enough to see me here.\"\n\nThe servant saluted and was gone. Kirby relapsed again into the depth\nof the chair, staring at the wall in front of him, letting his eye\ntravel from one to another of the accurately spaced-out pictures,\npieces of furniture and trophies that proclaimed him unmarried. There\nwas nothing whatever in his quarters to decoy him from his love. There\nwere polo sticks in a corner where a woman would have placed a standard\nlamp, and where the flowers should have stood was a chest to hold\nhorse-medicines. There was a vague smell about the place of varnish,\npolish and good leather.\n\nThe servant was back again, stiff at the salute, within five minutes.\n\n\"_Ne hai_.\"\n\n\"Not there? Not where? Not in his quarters? Then go and find him. Ask\nwhere he is. Hurry!\"\n\nSo, since the regiment was keyed to watchfulness, it took about five\nminutes more before it was known that Ranjoor Singh was not in\nbarracks. The servant returned to report that he had been seen driving\ntoward the bazaar in a _tikka-gharri_.\n\nThen entered Warrington, the adjutant, and the servant was dismissed at\nonce.\n\n\"Bad business,\" said Warrington, looking thoroughly cheerful.\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"One of Squadron D's men murdered in the bazaar this afternoon. Body's\nin the morgue in charge of the police. 'Nother man who was with him\napparently missing. No explanation, and the p'lice say there aren't any\nclues.\"\n\nHe twisted at a little black mustache and began to hum.\n\n\"Know where Ranjoor Singh is by any chance?\" asked Kirby.\n\n\"Give me three guesses--no, two. One--he's raising hell with all the\npolice in Delhi. Two--he's at the scene of the murder, doing detective\nwork on his own. I heard he'd driven away--and, anyhow, it's his\nsquadron. Man's probably his second cousin, twenty or thirty times\nremoved.\"\n\n\"Send somebody to find him!\" ordered Kirby.\n\n\"Say you want to have a word with him?\"\n\nKirby nodded, and Warrington swaggered out, humming to himself exactly\nas he hoped to be humming when his last grim call should come, the\nincarnation of efficiency, awake and very glad. A certain number of\nseconds after he had gone two mounted troopers clattered out toward the\nbazaar. Ten minutes later Warrington returned.\n\n\"D Squadron's squattin' on its hunkers in rings an' lookin' gloomy,\" he\nsaid, as if he were announcing some good news that had a touch of humor\nin it. \"By the look of 'em you'd say they'd been passed over for active\nservice and were meditatin' matrimony.\"\n\n\"By gad, Warrington! You don't know how near that guess is to the\ntruth!\"\n\nKirby's lips were smiling, but his voice was hard. Warrington glanced\nquickly at him once and then looked serious.\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Has it broken yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is it goin' to break?\"\n\n\"Looks like it. Looks to me as if it's all been prearranged. Our crowd\nare sparring for time, and the Prussians are all in a hurry. Looks that\nway to me.\"\n\n\"And you mean--there's a chance--even a chance of us--of Outram's Own\nbein' out of it? Beg your pardon, sir, but are you serious?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby, and Warrington's jaw fell.\n\n\"Any details that are not too confidential for me to know?\" asked\nWarrington.\n\n\"Tell you all about it after I've had a word with Ranjoor Singh.\"\n\n\"Hadn't I better go and help look for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you like.\"\n\nSo, within another certain number of split seconds, Captain Charlie\nWarrington rode, as the French say, belly-to-the-earth, and the fact\nthat the monsoon chose that instant to let pour another Noah's deluge\nseemed to make no difference at all to his ardor or the pace to which\nhe spurred his horse.\n\nAn angry police officer grumbled that night at the club about the\narrogance of all cavalrymen, but of one Warrington in particular.\n\n\"Wanted to know, by the Big Blue Bull of Bashan, whether I knew when a\ncase was serious or not! Yes, he did! Seemed to think the murder of one\nsowar was the only criminal case in all Delhi, and had the nerve to\ninvite me to set every constable in what he termed my parish on the one\njob. What did I say? Told him to call to-morrow, of course--said I'd\nsee. Gad! You should have heard him swear then--thought his eyes 'ud\nburn holes in my tunic. Went careering out of the office as if war had\nbeen declared.\"\n\n\"Talking of war,\" said somebody, nursing a long drink under the\nswinging punkah, \"do you suppose--\"\n\nSo the manners of India's pet cavalry were forgotten at once in the\nvortex of the only topic that had interest for any one in clubdom, and\nit was not noticed whether Warrington or his colonel, or any other\nofficer of native cavalry looked in at the club that night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWarrington rode into the rain at the same speed at which he had\ngalloped to the police station, overhauled one of the mounted troopers\nwhom he himself had sent in search of Ranjoor Singh, rated him soundly\nin Punjabi for loafing on the way, and galloped on with the troop-horse\nlaboring in his wake. He reined in abreast of the second trooper, who\nhad halted by a cross-street and was trying to appear to enjoy the\ndeluge.\n\n\"Any word?\" asked Warrington.\n\n\"I spoke with two who said he entered by that door-that small door down\nthe passage, sahib, where there is no light. It is a teak door, bolted\nand with no keyhole on the outside.\"\n\n\"Good for you,\" said Warrington, glancing quickly up and down the wet\nstreet, where the lamps gleamed deceptively in pools of running water.\nThere seemed nobody in sight; but that is a bold guess in Delhi, where\nthe shadows all have eyes.\n\nHe gave a quiet order, and trooper number one passed his reins to\nnumber two.\n\n\"Go and try that door. Kick it in if you can--but be quick, and try not\nto be noisy!\"\n\nThe trooper swung out of the saddle and obeyed, while Warrington and\nthe other man faced back to back, watching each way against surprise.\nIn India, as in lands less \"civilized,\" the cavalry are not allowed to\nusurp the functions of police, and the officer or man who tries it does\nso at his own risk. There came a sound of sudden thundering on teak\nthat ceased after two minutes.\n\n\"The door is stout. There is no answer from within,\" said the trooper.\n\n\"Then wait here on foot,\" commanded Warrington. \"Get under cover and\nwatch. Stay here until you're relieved, unless something particularly\nworth reporting happens; in that case, hurry and report. For\ninstance\"--he hesitated, trying to imagine something out of the\nunimaginable--\"suppose the risaldar-major were to come out, then give\nhim the message and come home with him. But--oh, suppose the place\ntakes fire, or there's a riot, or you hear a fight going on\ninside--then hurry to barracks--understand?\"\n\nThe wet trooper nodded and saluted.\n\n\"Get into a shadow, then, and keep as dry as you can,\" ordered\nWarrington. \"Come on!\" he called to the other man.\n\nAnd a second later he was charging through the street as if he rode\nwith despatches through a zone of rifle fire. Behind him clattered a\nrain-soaked trooper and two horses.\n\nColonel Kirby stepped out of his bathroom just as Warrington arrived,\nand arranged his white dress-tie before the sitting-room mirror.\n\n\"Looks fishy to me, sir,\" said Warrington, hurrying in and standing\nwhere the rain from his wet clothes would do least harm.\n\nThere was a space on the floor between two tiger-skins where the\nmatting was a little threadbare. Messengers, orderlies or servants\nalways stood on that spot. After a moment, however, Kirby's servant\nbrought Warrington a bathroom mat.\n\n\"How d'ye mean?\"\n\nWarrington explained.\n\n\"What did the police say?\"\n\n\"Said they were busy.\"\n\n\"Now, I could go to the club,\" mused Kirby, \"and see Hetherington, and\nhave a talk with him, and get him to sign a search-warrant. Armed with\nthat, we could--\"\n\n\"Perhaps persuade a police officer to send two constables with it\nto-morrow morning!\" said Warrington, with a grin.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"And if we do much on our own account we'll fall foul of the Indian\nPenal Code, which altereth every week,\" said Warrington.\n\n\"If it weren't for the fact that I particularly want a word with him,\"\nsaid Kirby, giving a last tweak to his tie and reaching out for his\nmess-jacket that the servant had laid on a chair, \"there'd not be much\nground that I can see for action of any kind. He has a right to go\nwhere he likes.\"\n\nThat point of view did not seem to have occurred to Warrington before;\nnor did he quite like it, for he frowned.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" said Kirby, diving into his mess-jacket and\nshrugging his neat shoulders until they fitted into it as a charger\nfits into his skin, \"under the circumstances--and taking into\nconsideration certain private information that has reached me--if I\nwere supposed to be behind a bolted door in the bazaar, I'd rather\nappreciate it if Ranjoor Singh, for instance, were to--ah--take action\nof some kind.\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir.\"\n\n\"Hallo--what's that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA motor-car, driven at racing speed, thundered up the lane between the\nold stacked cannon and came to a panting standstill by the colonel's\nouter door. A gruff question was answered gruffly, and a man's step\nsounded on the veranda. Then the servant flung the door wide, and a\nBritish soldier stepped smartly into the room, saluted and held out a\ntelegram.\n\nKirby tore it open. His eyes blazed, but his hands were steady. The\nsoldier held out a receipt book and a pencil, and Kirby took time to\nscribble his initials in the proper place. Warrington, humming to\nhimself, began to squeeze the rain out of his tunic to hide impatience.\nThe soldier saluted, faced about and hurried to the waiting car. Then\nKirby read the telegram. He nodded to Warrington. Warrington, his\nfinger-ends pressed tight into his palms and his forearms quivering,\nraised one eyebrow.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"War, sir?\"\n\n\"War.\"\n\n\"We're under orders?\"\n\n\"Not yet. It says, 'War likely to be general. Be ready.' Here, read it\nfor yourself.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't have sent us that if--\"\n\n\"Addressed to O.C. troops. They had those ready written out and sent\none to every O.C. on the list the second they knew.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"Leave the room, Lal Singh!\"\n\nThe servant, who was screwing up his courage to edge nearer, did as he\nwas told.\n\nKirby stood still, facing the mirror, with both arms behind him.\n\n\"They're certain to send native Indian troops to Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"We're ready, sir! We're ready to a shoe-string! We'll go first!\"\n\n\"We'll be last, Warrington, supposing we go at all, unless we find\nRanjoor Singh! They'll send us to do police work in Bengal, or to guard\nthe Bombay docks and watch the other fellows go. I'm going to the club.\nYou'd better come with me. Hurry into dry clothes.\" He glanced at the\nclock. \"We'll just have time to drive past the house where you say he's\nsupposed to be, if you hurry.\"\n\nThe last three words were lost, for Captain Warrington had turned into\na thunderbolt and disappeared; the noise of his going was as when a\nsudden windstorm slams all the doors at once. A moment later he could\nbe heard shouting from outside his quarters to his servant to be ready\nfor him.\n\nHe certainly bathed, for the noise of the tub overturning when he was\ndone with it was unmistakable. And eight minutes after his departure he\nwas back again, dressed, cloaked and ready.\n\n\"Got your pistol, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Thought I'd bring mine along. You never know, you know.\"\n\nTogether they climbed into the colonel's dog-cart, well smothered under\nwaterproofs. Kirby touched up another of his road-devouring walers, the\nsais grabbed at the back seat and jumped for his life, and they shot\nout of the compound, down the line of useless cannon and out into the\nstreet, taking the corner as the honor of the regiment required. Then\nthe two big side-lamps sent their shafts of light straight down the\nmetaled, muddy road, and the horse settled down between them to do his\nequine \"demdest\"; there was a touch on the reins he recognized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the edge of the bazaar to find the crowd stirring,\nalthough strangely mute.\n\n\"They'll have got the news in an hour from now,\" said Kirby. \"They can\nsmell it already.\"\n\n\"Wonder how much truth there is in all this talk about German merchants\nand propaganda.\"\n\n\"_H-rrrrr-ummm_!\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Steady, sir! Lookout!\"\n\nThe near wheel missed a native woman by a fraction of an inch, and her\nshrill scream followed them. But Kirby kept his eyes ahead, and the\nshadows continued to flash by them in a swift procession until\nWarrington leaned forward, and then Kirby leaned back against the reins.\n\n\"There he is, sir!\"\n\nThey reined to a halt, and a drenched trooper jumped up behind to kneel\non the back seat and speak in whispers.\n\n\"No sign of him at all?\" asked Kirby.\n\n\"No, sahib. But there has been a light behind a shutter above there. It\ncomes and goes. They light it and extinguish it.\"\n\n\"Has anybody come out of that door?\"\n\n\"No, sahib.\"\n\n\"None gone in?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Any other door to the place?\"\n\n\"There may be a dozen, sahib. That is an old house, and it backs up\nagainst six others.\"\n\n\"What we suffer from in this country is information,\" said Warrington,\nbeginning to hum to himself.\n\nBut Kirby signed to the trooper, and the man began to scramble out of\nthe cart.\n\n\"Between now and our return, report to the club if anything happens,\"\ncalled Warrington.\n\nThe whip swished, the horse shot forward, and they were off again as if\nthey would catch up with the hurrying seconds. People scattered to the\nright and left in front of them; a constable at a street crossing blew\nhis whistle frantically; once the horse slipped in a deep puddle, and\nall but came to earth; but they reached the club without mishap and\ndrove up the winding drive at a speed more in keeping with convention.\n\n\"Oh, hallo, Kirby! Glad you've come!\" said a voice.\n\n\"Evening, sir!\"\n\nKirby descended, almost into the arms of a general in evening dress.\nThey walked into the club together, leaving the adjutant wondering what\nto do. He decided to follow them at a decent distance, still humming\nand looking happy enough for six men.\n\n\"You'll be among the first,\" said the general. \"Are you ready,\nKirby--absolutely ready?\"\n\n\"Yes,\"\n\n\"The wires are working to the limit. It isn't settled yet whether\ntroops go from here via Canada or the Red Sea--probably won't be until\nthe Navy's had a chance to clear the road. All that's known--yet--is\nthat Belgium's invaded, and that every living man Jack who can be\nhurried to the front in time to keep the Germans out of Paris will be\nsent. Hold yourself ready to entrain any minute, Kirby.\"\n\n\"Is martial law proclaimed yet?\" asked Kirby in a voice that the\ngeneral seemed to think was strained, for he looked around sharply.\n\n\"Not yet. Why?\"\n\n\"Information, sir. Anything else?\"\n\n\"No. Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night, sir.\"\n\nKirby nearly ran into Warrington as he hurried back toward the door.\n\n\"Find a police officer!\" he ordered.\n\n\"They all passed you a minute ago, sir,\" answered Warrington. \"They're\nheaded for police headquarters. Heard one of 'em say so.\"\n\nKirby pulled himself together. A stranger would not have noticed that\nhe needed it, but Warrington at his elbow saw the effort and was glad.\n\n\"Go to police headquarters, then,\" he ordered. \"Try to get them to\nbring a dozen men and search, that house; but don't say that Ranjoor\nSingh's in there.\"\n\n\"Where'll I find you, sir?\"\n\n\"Barracks. Oh, by the way, we're a sure thing for the front.\"\n\n\"I knew there was some reason why I kept feelin' cheerful!\" said\nWarrington. \"The risaldar-major looks like gettin' left.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" said Kirby, \"you can get the police to act to-night--or\nunless martial law's proclaimed at once, and I can think of an excuse\nto search the house with a hundred men myself. Find somebody to give\nyou a lift. So long.\"\n\nKirby swung into his dog-cart, the sais did an acrobatic turn behind,\nand again the horse proceeded to lower records. Zigzag-wise, through\nstreets that were growing more and yet more thronged instead of silent,\nthey tore barrackward, missing men by a miracle every twelve yards.\nKirby's eyes were on a red blotch, now, that danced and glowed above\nthe bazaar a mile ahead. It reminded him of pain.\n\nPresently the horse sniffed smoke, and notified as much before settling\ndown into his stride again. The din of hoarse excitement reached\nKirby's ears, and in a moment more a khaki figure leaped out of a\nshadow and a panting trooper snatched at the back seat, was grabbed by\nthe sais, and swung up in the rear.\n\n\"Sahib--\"\n\n\"All right. I know,\" said Kirby, though he did not know how he knew.\n\nThey raced through another dozen streets until the glare grew blinding\nand the smoke nearly choked him. Then they were stopped entirely by the\ncrowd, and Colonel Kirby sat motionless; for he had a nearly perfect\nview of a holocaust. The house in which Ranjoor Singh was supposed to\nbe was so far burned that little more than the walls was standing.\n\n\n  The North Wind hails from the Northern snows,\n    (His voice is loud--oh, listen ye!)\n  He cried of death--the death he knows--\n    Of the mountain death. (Oh, listen ye!)\n  Who looks to the North for love looks long!\n  Who goes to the North for gain goes wrong!\n  Men's hearts are hard, and the goods belong\n    To the strong in the North! (Oh, listen ye!)\n  Whose lot is fair--who loves his life--\n  Walks wide, stays wide of the Northern knife!\n    (Ye men o' the world, oh, listen ye!)\n\nYASMINI'S SONG.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThere were police and to spare now, nor any doubt of it. Even the\nbreath of war's beginning could not keep them elsewhere when a fire had\ncharge in the densest quarters of the danger zone. The din of ancient\nDelhi roared skyward, and the Delhi crowd surged and fought to be\nnearer to the flame; but the police already had a cordon around the\nbuilding, and another detachment was forcing the swarms of men and\nwomen into eddying movement in which something like a system developed\npresently, for there began to be a clear space in which the fire\nbrigade could work.\n\n\"Any bodies recovered?\" asked Colonel Kirby, leaning from the seat of\nhis high dogcart to speak to the English fireman who stood sentry over\nthe water-plug.\n\n\"No, sir. The fire had too much headway before the alarm went in. When\nwe got here the whole lower part was red-hot.\"\n\n\"Any means of escape from the building from the rear?\"\n\n\"As many as from a rat-run, sir. That house is as old as Delhi--about;\nand there are as any galleries up above connecting with houses at the\nrear as there are run-holes from cellar to cellar.\"\n\n\"Any chance for anybody down in the cellar?\"\n\n\"Doubt it, sir. The fire started there; the water'll do what the fire\nleft undone. Pretty bad trap, sir, I should say, if you asked me.\"\n\n\"No reports of escape or rescue?\"\n\n\"None that I've heard tell of.\"\n\n\"And the house seems doomed, eh? Be some days before they can sort the\ndebris over?\"\n\n\"Lucky if we save the ten houses nearest it! Look, sir! There she goes!\"\n\nThe roof fell in, sending five separate volumes of red sparks up into\nthe cloudy night as floor after floor collapsed beneath the weight. The\nthunder of it was almost drowned in a roar of delight, for the crowd,\nsensing the new spirit of its masters, was in a mood for the terrible.\nThen silence fell, as if that had been an overture.\n\nOut of the silence and through the sea of hot humanity, the white of\nhis dress-shirt showing through the unbuttoned front of a military\ncloak, Warrington rode a borrowed Arab pony, the pony's owner's sais\nrunning beside him to help clear a passage. Warrington was still\nhumming to himself as he dismissed both sais and pony and climbed up\nbeside Kirby in the dog-cart.\n\n\"If Ranjoor Singh's in that house, he's in a predicament,\" he said\ncheerfully. \"I went to police headquarters, and the first officer I\nspoke to told me to go to hell. So I went into the next office, where\nall the big panjandrums hide--and some of the little ones--and they\ntold me what you know, sir, that the house is in flames and every\npoliceman who can be spared is on the job, so I came to see. If Ranjoor\nSingh's in there--but I don't believe he is!\"\n\n\"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't believe the Lord 'ud send us active service--not a real red\nwar against a real enemy--and play a low-down trick on Ranjoor Singh.\nRanjoor Singh's a gentleman. It wouldn't be sportsmanlike to let him\ndie before the game begins.\"\n\nFor a minute or two they watched the sparks go up and the crowd\nstriking at the rats that still seemed to find some place of exit.\n\n\"There's a place below there that isn't red--hot yet,\" said Kirby.\n\"Those rats are not cooked through. Did you tell the police that you\nwanted a search warrant?\"\n\n\"Yes. Might as well argue with an ant-heap. All of 'em too busy tryin'\nfor commissions in the Volunteers to listen. They've got it all cut an'\ndried--somebody in the basement upset a lamp, according to them--nobody\nup-stairs--nobody to turn in the alarm until the fire had complete\ncharge! They offer to prove it when the fire's out and they can sort\nthe ashes.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m! Tell 'em a trooper of ours saw a light there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"'Doubtless the lamp that was kicked over!'\"\n\nColonel Kirby clucked to his horse and worked a way out to the edge of\nthe crowd with the skill of one whose business is to handle men in\nquantity. Then he shot like a dart up side streets and made for\nbarracks by a detour.\n\n\"Gad!\" said Warrington suddenly.\n\n\"Who's told 'em d'you suppose?\"\n\n\"Dunno, sir. News leaks in Delhi like water from a lump of ice.\"\n\nIn the darkness of the barrack wall there were more than a thousand\nmen, women and children, many of them Sikhs, who clamored to be told\nthings, and by the gate was a guard of twenty men drawn up to keep the\ncrowd at bay. The shrill voices of the women drowned the answers of the\nnative officer as well as the noise of the approaching wheels, and the\nguard had to advance into the road to clear a way for its colonel.\n\nThe native officer saluted and grinned.\n\n\"Is it true, sahib?\" he shouted, and Kirby raised his whip in the\naffirmative. From that instant the guard began to make more noise than\nthe crowd beyond the wall.\n\nKirby whipped his horse and took the drive that led to his quarters at\na speed there was no overhauling. He wanted to be alone. But his senior\nmajor had forestalled him and was waiting by his outer door.\n\n\"Oh, hallo, Brammle. Yes, come in.\"\n\n\"Is it peace, Jehu?\" asked Brammle.\n\n\"War. We'll be the first to go. No, no route yet--likely to get it any\nminute.\"\n\n\"I'll bet, then. Bet you it's Bombay--a P. and O.--Red Sea and\nMarseilles! Oh, who wouldn't be light cavalry? First-class all the way,\nfirst aboard, and first crack at 'em! Any orders, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes. Take charge. I'm going out, and Warrington's going with me. Don't\nknow how long we'll be gone. If anybody asks for me, tell him I'll be\nback soon. Tell the men.\"\n\n\"Somebody's told 'em--listen!\"\n\n\"Tell 'em that whoever misbehaves from now forward will be left behind.\nGive 'em my definite promise on that point!\"\n\n\"Anything else, sir?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then see you later.\"\n\n\"See you later.\"\n\nThe major went away, and Kirby turned to his adjutant.\n\n\"Go and order the closed shay, Warrington. Pick a driver who won't\ntalk. Have some grub sent in here to me, and join me at it in half an\nhour; say fifteen minutes later. I've some things to see to.\"\n\nKirby wanted very much to be alone. The less actual contact a colonel\nhas with his men, and the more he has with his officers, the better--as\na rule; but it does not pay to think in the presence of either.\nOfficers and men alike should know him as a man-who-has-thought, a man\nin whose voice is neither doubt nor hesitation.\n\nThirty minutes later Warrington found him just emerging from a brown\nstudy.\n\n\"India's all roots-in-the-air an' dancin'!\" he remarked cheerfully.\n\"There was a babu sittin' by the barrack gate who offers to eat a\nGerman a day, as long as we'll catch 'em for him. He's the same man\nthat was tryin' for a job as clerk the other day.\"\n\n\"Fat man?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"Uh-h-h! No credentials--bad hat! Send him packing?\"\n\n\"The guard did.\"\n\nFood was laid on a small table by a silent servant who had eyes in the\nback of his head and ears that would have caught and analyzed the\nlightest whisper; but the colonel and his adjutant ate hurriedly in\nsilence, and the only thing remarkable that the servant was able to\nreport to the regiment afterward was that both drank only water. Since\nall Sikhs are supposed to be abstainers from strong drink, that was\naccepted as a favorable omen.\n\nThe shay arrived on time to the second. It was the only closed carriage\nthe regiment owned--a heavy C-springed landau thing, taken over from\nthe previous mess. The colonel peered through outer darkness at the box\nseat, but the driver did not look toward him; all he could see was that\nthere was only one man on the box.\n\n\"Where to?\" asked Warrington.\n\n\"The club.\"\n\nWarrington jumped in after him, and the driver sent his pair straining\nat the traces as if they had a gun behind them. Three hundred yards\nbeyond the barrack wall Colonel Kirby knelt on the front seat and poked\nthe driver from behind.\n\n\"Oh! You?\" he remarked, as he recognized a native risaldar of D\nSquadron. Until the novelty wears off it would disconcert any man to\ndiscover suddenly that his coachman is a troop commander.\n\n\"D'you know a person named Yasmini?\" he asked.\n\n\"Who does not, sahib?\"\n\n\"Drive us to her house--in a hurry!\"\n\nThe immediate answer was a plunge as the whip descended on both horses\nand the heavy carriage began to sway like a boat in a beam-sea swell.\nThey tore through streets that were living streams of human\nbeings--streams that split apart to let them through and closed like\nwater again behind them. With his spurred heels on the front seat,\nWarrington hummed softly to himself as ever, happy, so long as there\nwere only action.\n\n\"I've heard India spoken of as dead,\" he remarked after a while. \"Gad!\nLook at that color against the darkness!\"\n\n\"If Ranjoor Singh is dead, I'm going to know it!\" said Colonel Kirby.\n\"And if he isn't dead, I'm going to dig him out or know the reason why.\nThere's been foul play, Warrington. I happen to know that Ranjoor Singh\nhas been suspected in a certain quarter. Incidentally, I staked my own\nreputation on his honesty this afternoon. And besides, we can't afford\nto lose a wing commander such as he is on the eve of the real thing.\nWe've got to find him!\"\n\nOnce or twice as they flashed by a street-lamp they were recognized as\nBritish officers, and then natives, who would have gone to some trouble\nto seem insolent a few hours before, stopped to half-turn and salaam to\nthem.\n\n\"Wonder how they'd like German rule for a change?\" mused Warrington.\n\n\"India doesn't often wear her heart on her sleeve,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"It's there to-night!\" said Warrington. \"India's awake, if this is\nDelhi and not a nightmare! India's makin' love to the British\nsoldier-man!\"\n\nThey tore through a city that is polychromatic in the daytime and by\nnight a dream of phantom silhouettes. But, that night, day and night\nwere blended in one uproar, and the Chandni Chowk was at floodtide,\nwave on wave of excited human beings pouring into it from a hundred\nbystreets and none pouring out again.\n\nSo the risaldar drove across the Chandni Chowk, fighting his way with\nthe aid of whip and voice, and made a wide circuit through dark lanes\nwhere groups of people argued at the corners, and sometimes a would-be\nholy man preached that the end of the world had come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached Yasmini's from the corner farthest from the Chandni Chowk,\nand sprang out of the carriage the instant that the risaldar drew rein.\n\n\"Wait within call!\" commanded Kirby, and the risaldar raised his whip.\n\nThen, with his adjutant at his heels, Colonel Kirby dived through the\ngloomy opening in a wall that Yasmini devised to look as little like an\napproach to her--or heaven--as possible.\n\n\"Wonder if he's brought us to the right place?\" he whispered, sniffing\ninto the moldy darkness.\n\n\"Dunno, sir. There're stairs to your left.\"\n\nThey caught the sound of faint flute music on an upper floor, and as\nKirby felt cautiously for his footing on the lower step Warrington\nbegan to whistle softly to himself. Next to war, an adventure of this\nkind was the nearest he could imagine to sheer bliss, and it was all he\ncould do to contrive to keep from singing.\n\nThe heavy teak stairs creaked under their joint weight, and though\ntheir eyes could not penetrate the upper blackness, yet they both\nsuspected rather than sensed some one waiting for them at the top.\n\nKirby's right hand instinctively sought a pocket in his cloak.\nWarrington felt for his pistol, too.\n\nFor thirty or more seconds--say, three steps--they went up like\nconspirators, trying to move silently and holding to the rail; then the\nabsurdity of the situation appealed to both, and without a word said\neach stepped forward like a man, so that the staircase resounded.\n\nThey stumbled on a little landing after twenty steps, and wasted about\na minute knocking on what felt like the panels of a door; but then\nWarrington peered into the gloom higher up and saw dim light.\n\nSo they essayed a second flight of stairs, in single file as before,\nand presently--when they had climbed some ten steps and had turned to\nnegotiate ten more that ascended at an angle--a curtain moved a little,\nand the dim light changed to a sudden shaft that nearly blinded them.\n\nThen a heavy black curtain was drawn back on rings, and a hundred\nlights, reflected in a dozen mirrors, twinkled and flashed before them\nso that they could not tell which way to turn. Somewhere there was a\nglassbead curtain, but there were so many mirrors that they could not\ntell which was the curtain and which were its reflections.\n\nThe curtains all parted, and from the midst of each there stepped a\nlittle nutbrown maid, who seemed too lovely to be Indian. Even then\nthey could not tell which was maid and which reflections until she\nspoke.\n\n\"Will the sahibs give their names?\" she asked in Hindustani; and her\nvoice suggested flutes.\n\nShe smiled, and her teeth were whiter than a pipe-clayed sword-belt;\nthere is nothing on earth whiter than her teeth were.\n\n\"Colonel Kirby and Captain Warrington\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Will the sahibs state their business?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Then whom do the sahibs seek to see?\"\n\n\"Does a lady live here named Yasmini?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahib.\"\n\n\"I wish to talk with her.\"\n\nA dozen little maids seemed to step back through a dozen swaying\ncurtains, and a second later for the life of them they could neither of\nthem tell through which it was that the music came and the smell of\nmusk and sandal-smoke. But she came back and beckoned to them, laughing\nover her shoulder and holding the middle curtain apart for them to\nfollow.\n\nSo, one after the other, they followed her, Kirby--as became a\nseriously-minded colonel on the eve of war--feeling out of place and\nfoolish, but Warrington, possessed by such a feeling of curiosity as he\nhad never before tasted.\n\nThe heat inside the room they entered was oppressive, in spite of a\ngreat open window at which sat a dozen maids, and of the punkahs\nswinging overhead, so Kirby undid his cloak and walked revealed, a\nsoldier in mess dress.\n\n\"Look at innocence aware of itself!\" whispered Warrington.\n\n\"Shut up!\" commanded Kirby, striding forward.\n\nA dozen--perhaps more--hillmen, of three or four different tribes, had\nsat back against one wall and looked suspicious when they entered, but\nat sight of Kirby's military clothes they had looked alarmed and moved\nas if a whip had been cracked not far away. The Northern adventurer\ndoes not care to be seen at his amusements, nor does he love to be\nlooked in on by men in uniform.\n\nBut the little maid beckoned them on, still showing her teeth and\ntripping in front of them as if a gust of wind were blowing her. Her\nmotion was that of a dance reduced to a walk for the sake of decorum.\n\nThrough another glass-bead curtain at the farther end of the long room\nshe led them to a second room, all hung about with silks and furnished\nwith deep-cushioned divans. There were mirrors in this room, too, so\nthat Kirby laughed aloud to see how incongruous and completely out of\nplace he and his adjutant locked. His gruff laugh came so suddenly that\nthe maid nearly jumped out of her skin.\n\n\"Will the sahibs be seated?\" she asked almost in a whisper, as if they\nhad half-frightened the life out of her, and then she ran out of the\nroom so quickly that they were only aware of the jingling curtain.\n\nSo they sat down, Kirby trying the cushions with his foot until he\nfound some firm enough to allow him to retain his dignity. Cavalry\ndress-trousers are not built to sprawl on cushions in; a man should sit\nreasonably upright or else stand.\n\n\"I'll say this for myself,\" he grunted, as he settled into place, \"it's\nthe first time in my life I was ever inside a native woman's premises.\"\n\nWarrington did not commit himself to speech.\n\nThey sat for five minutes looking about them, Warrington beginning to\nbe bored, but Kirby honestly interested by the splendor of the hangings\nand the general atmosphere of Eastern luxury. It was Warrington who\ngrew uneasy first.\n\n\"Feel as if any one was lookin' at you, sir?\" he asked out of one side\nof his mouth. And then Kirby noticed it, and felt his collar awkwardly.\n\nIn all the world there is nothing so well calculated to sap a man's\nprepossession as the feeling that he is secretly observed. There was no\nsound, no movement, no sign of any one, and Warrington looked in the\nmirrors keenly while he pretended to be interested in his little\nmustache. Yet the sweat began to run down Colonel Kirby's temples, and\nhe felt at his collar again to make sure that it stood upright.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I do. I'm going to get up and walk about.\"\n\nHe paced the length of the long room twice, turning quickly at each\nend, but detecting no movement and no eyes. Then he sat down again\nbeside Warrington; but the feeling still persisted.\n\nSuddenly a low laugh startled them, a delicious laugh, full of\ncamaraderie, that would have disarmed the suspicion of a wolf. Just as\nunexpectedly a curtain less than a yard away from Kirby moved, and she\nstood before them--Yasmini. She could only be Yasmini. Besides, she had\njasmine flowers worked into her hair.\n\nLike a pair of bull buffaloes startled from their sleep, the colonel\nand his adjutant shot to their feet and faced her, and to their credit\nlet it be recorded that they dropped their eyes, both of them. They\nfelt like bounders. They hated themselves for breaking in on such\nloveliness.\n\n\"Will the sahibs not be seated again?\" she asked them in a velvet\nvoice; and, sweating in the neck, they each sat down.\n\nNow that the first feeling of impropriety had given way to curiosity,\nneither had eyes for anything but her. Neither had ever seen anything\nso beautiful, so fascinating, so impudently lovely. She was laughing at\nthem; each knew it, yet neither felt resentful.\n\n\"Well?\" she asked in Hindustani, and arched her eyebrows questioning.\n\nAnd Colonel Kirby stammered because she had made him think of his\nmother, and the tender prelude to a curtain lecture. Yet this woman was\nnot old enough to have been his wife!\n\n\"I-I-I came to ask about a friend of mine--by name Risaldar--Major\nRanjoor Singh. I understand you know him?\"\n\nShe nodded, and Kirby fought with a desire to let his mind wander. The\nsubtle hypnotism that the East knows how to stage and use was creeping\nover him. She stood so close! She seemed so like the warm soft spirit\nof all womanhood that only the measured rising and falling of her\nbosom, under the gauzy drapery, made her seem human and not a spirit.\nSubtly, ever so cunningly, she had contrived to touch a chord in\nColonel Kirby's heart that he did not know lived any more. Warrington\nwas speechless; he could not have trusted himself to speak. She had\ntouched another chord in him.\n\n\"He came here more than once, or so I've been given to understand,\"\nsaid Kirby, and his own voice startled him, for it seemed harsh. \"He is\nsaid to have listened to a lecture here--I was told the lecture was\ndelivered by a German--and there was some sort of a fracas outside in\nthe street afterward. I'm told some of his squadron were near, and they\nthrashed a man. Now, Ranjoor Singh is missing.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Yasmini, arching her whole lithe body into a setting for the\nprettiest yawn that Kirby had ever seen. \"So the Jat is missing! Yes,\nhe came here, sahib. He was never invited, but he came. He sat here\nsaying nothing until it suited him to sit where another man was; then\nhe struck the other man--so, with the sole of his foot--and took the\nman's place, and heard what he came to hear. Later, outside in the\nstreet, he and his men set on the Afridi whom he had struck with his\nfoot and beat him.\"\n\n\"I have heard a variation of that,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Have you ever heard, sahib, that he who strikes the wearer of a\nNorthern knife is like to feel that knife? So Ranjoor Singh, the Jat,\nis missing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby, frowning, for he was not pleased to hear Ranjoor\nSingh spoken of slightingly. A Jat may be a good enough man, and\nusually is, but a Sikh is a Jat who is better.\n\n\"And if he is missing, what has that to do with me?\" asked Yasmini.\n\n\"I have heard--men say--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she said, laughing, for it amused her almost more than any other\nthing to see dignity disarmed.\n\n\"Men say that you know most of what goes on in Delhi--\"\n\n\"And--?\" She was Impudence arrayed in gossamer.\n\nColonel Kirby pulled himself together; after all, it was not for long\nthat anything less than an army corps could make him feel unequal to a\nsituation. This woman was the loveliest thing he had ever seen, but....\n\n\"I've come to find out whether Ranjoor Singh's alive or dead,\" he said\nsternly, \"and, if he's alive, to take him away with me.\"\n\nShe smiled as graciously as evening smiles on the seeded plains, and\nsank on to a divan with the grace it needs a life of dancing to bestow.\n\n\"Sahib,\" she said, with a suddenly assumed air of candidness, \"they\nhave told the truth. There is little that goes on in Delhi--in the\nworld--that I can not hear of if I will. The winds of the world flow in\nand out of these four walls.\"\n\n\"Then where is Ranjoor Singh?\" asked Colonel Kirby.\n\nShe did not hesitate an instant. He was watching her amazing eyes that\nsurely would have betrayed her had she been at a moment's loss; they\ndid not change nor darken for a second.\n\n\"How much, does the sahib know already?\" she asked calmly, as if she\nwished to spare him an unnecessary repetition of mere beginnings.\n\n\"A trooper of D Squadron--that's Ranjoor Singh's squadron--was murdered\nin the bazaar this afternoon. The risaldar-major went to the morgue to\nidentify the body--drove through the bazaar, and possibly discovered\nsome clue to the murderer. At all events, he is known to have entered a\nhouse in the bazaar, and that house is now in flames.\"\n\n\"The sahib knows that much? And am I to quell the flames?\" asked\nYasmini.\n\nShe neither sat nor lay on the divan. She was curled on it, leaning on\nan elbow, like an imp from another world.\n\n\"Who owns that house?\" asked Kirby, since he could think of nothing\nelse to ask.\n\n\"That is the House-of-the-Eight-Half--brothers,\" said Yasmini. \"He who\nbuilt it had eight wives, and a son by each. That was ages ago, and the\ndescendants of the eight half-brothers are all at law about the\nownership. There are many stories told about that house.\"\n\nSuddenly she broke into laughter, leaning on her hand and mocking them\nas Puck mocked mortals. A man could not doubt her. Colonel and\nadjutant, both men who had seen grim service and both self-possessed as\na rule, knew that she could read clean through them, and that from the\nbottom of her deep, wise soul she was amused.\n\n\"I am from the North,\" she said, \"and the North is cold; there is\nlittle mercy in the hills, and I was weaned amid them. Yet--would the\nsahib not better beg of me?\"\n\n\"How d'ye mean?\" asked Kirby, surprised into speaking English.\n\n\"_Three days_ ago there came a wind that told _me_ of war--of a\nworld-war, surely not this time stillborn. Two years ago the same wind\nbrought me news of its conception, though the talk of the world was\nthen of universal peace and of horror at a war that was. Now, to-night,\nthis greatest war is loose, born and grown big within three days, but\nconceived two years ago--Russia, Germany, Austria, France are\nfighting--is it not so? Am I wrong?\"\n\n\"I came to ask about Ranjoor Singh,\" said Colonel Kirby, twisting at\nhis closely cropped mustache.\n\nThere was a hint of iron in his voice, and he was obviously not the man\nto threaten and not fulfil. But she laughed in his face.\n\n\"All in good time!\" she answered him. \"You shall beg for your Ranjoor\nSingh, and then perhaps he shall step forth from the burning house! But\nfirst you shall know why you _must_ beg.\"\n\nShe clapped her hands, and a maid appeared. She gave an order, and the\nmaid brought sherbet that Kirby sniffed suspiciously before tasting.\nAgain she laughed deliciously.\n\n\"Does the sahib think that he could escape alive from this room did I\nwill otherwise?\" she asked. \"Would I need to drug--I who have so many\nmeans?\"\n\nNow, it is a maxim of light cavalry that the best means of defense lies\nin attack; a threat of force should be met by a show of force, and\nforce by something quicker. Kirby's eyes and his adjutant's met. Each\nfelt for his hidden pistol. But she laughed at them with mirth that was\nso evidently unassumed that they blushed to their ears.\n\n\"Look!\" she said; and they looked.\n\nTwo great gray cobras, male and female, swayed behind them less than a\nyard away, balanced for the strike, hoods raised. The awful, ugly black\neyes gleamed with malice. And a swaying cobra's head is not an easy\nthing to hit with an automatic-pistol bullet, supposing, for wild\nimagination's sake, that the hooded devil does not strike first.\n\n\"It is not wise to move!\" purred Yasmini.\n\nThey did not see her make any sign, though she must have made one, for\ntheir eyes were fixed on the swaying snakes, and their brains were\nactive with the problem of whether to try to shoot or not. It seemed to\nthem that the snakes reached a resolution first, and struck. And in the\nsame instant as each drew his pistol the hooded messengers of death\nwere jerked out of sight by hands that snatched at horsehair from\nbehind the hangings.\n\n\"I have many such!\" smiled Yasmini, and they turned to meet her eyes\nagain, hoping she could not read the fear in theirs. \"But that is not\nwhy the sahib shall beg of me.\" Kirby was not too overcome to notice\nthe future tense. \"That is only a reason why the sahibs should forget\ntheir Western manners. But--if the pistols please the sahibs--\"\n\nThey stowed their pistols away again and sat as if the very cushions\nmight be stuffed with snakes, both of them aware that she had produced\na mental effect which was more to her advantage than the pistols would\nhave been had they made her a present of them. She gave a sudden shrill\ncry that startled them and made them look wildly for the door; but she\nhad done no more than command a punkah-wallah, and the heavy-beamed\npunkah began to swing rhythmically overhead, adding, if that were\npossible, to the mesmeric spell.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"I will tell a little of the why of things.\" And\nColonel Kirby hoped it was the punkah, and not funk, that made the\nsweat stream down his neck until his collar was a mere uncomfortable\nmess. \"For more than a year there has been much talk in India. The\nwinds have brought it all to me. There was talk--and the government has\nknown it, for I am one of those who told the government--of a ripe time\nfor a blow for independence.\n\n\"There have been agents of another Power, pretending to be merchants,\nwho have sown their seed carefully in the bazaars. And then there went\nnatives in the pay of the merchants who had word with native sowars,\nsaying that it is not well to be carried over sea to fight another's\nquarrels. All this the government knew, though, of course, thou art not\nthe government, but only a soldier with a ready pistol and a dull wit.\"\n\n\"What bearing has this on Ranjoor Singh?\" asked Kirby. It was so long\nsince he had been spoken to so bluntly that he could not sit still\nunder it.\n\n\"I am explaining why the colonel sahib shall beg for his Ranjoor\nSingh,\" she smiled. \"Does the fire burn yet, I wonder?\"\n\nShe struck a gong, and a maid appeared in the door like an instant echo.\n\n\"Does the fire still burn?\" she asked.\n\nThe maid disappeared, and was gone five minutes, during which Kirby and\nWarrington sat in silent wonder. They wondered chiefly what the\nregiment would say if it knew--and whether the regiment would ever\nknow. Then the maid came back.\n\n\"It burns,\" she said. \"I can see flame from the roof, though not so\nmuch flame.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Yasmini. \"Listen, sahibs.\"\n\nIt is doubtful if a trumpet could have summoned them away, for she had\nthem bound in her spells, and each in a different spell, as her way is.\nShe had little need to order them to listen.\n\n\"The talk in the bazaars did little harm, for the fat _bunnias_ know\nwell whose rule has given them their pickings. They talk for the love\nof words, but they trade for the love of money, and the government\nprotects their money. Nay, it was not the _bunnias_ who mattered.\n\n\"But there came a day when the rings of talk had reached the hills, and\nhillmen came to Delhi to hear more, as they ever have come since India\nwas India. And it was clear then to the government that proof of\ndisloyalty among the native regiments would set the hillmen screaming\nfor a holy war-for the hills are cold, sahibs, and the hillmen have\ncold hearts and are quick to take advantage, even as I am, of others'\nembarrassment. Hillmen have no mercy, Colonel sahib. I was weaned amid\nthe hills.\"\n\nIt seemed to Kirby and Warrington both--for not all their wits were\nstupefied--that she was sparring for time. And then Warrington saw a\nface reflected in one of the mirrors and nudged Kirby, and Kirby saw it\ntoo. They both saw that she was watching it. It was a fat face, and it\nlooked terrified, but the lips did not move and only the eyes had\nexpression. In a moment a curtain seemed to be drawn in front of it,\nand Yasmini took up her tale.\n\n\"And then, sahibs, as I have told already, there came a wind that\nwhistled about war; and it pleased the government to know which, if\nany, of the native regiments had been affected by the talk. So a closer\nwatch was set, then a net was drawn, and Ranjoor Singh ran into the\nnet.\"\n\n\"An antelope might blunder into a net set for a tiger,\" said Kirby. \"I\nam here to cut him out again.\"\n\nYasmini laughed.\n\n\"With pistols to shoot the cobras and sweat to put out flame? Nay, what\nis there to cut but the dark that closes up again? Sahib, thou shalt\n_beg_ for Ranjoor Singh, who struck a hillman in my house, he was so\neager to hear treason!\"\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh's honor and mine are one!\" said Colonel Kirby, using a\nnative phrase that admits of no double meaning, and for a second\nYasmini stared at him in doubt.\n\nShe had heard that phrase used often to express native regard for a\nnative, or for an Englishman, but never before by an Englishman for a\nnative.\n\n\"Then beg for him!\" she grinned mischievously. \"Aye, I know the tale!\nIt is the eve of war, and he commands a squadron, and there is need of\nhim. Is it not so? Yet the house that he entered burns. And the\nhillman's knife is long and keen, sahib! Beg for him!\"\n\nKirby had risen to his feet, and Warrington followed suit. Kirby's\nself-possession was returning and she must have known it; perhaps she\neven intended that it should. But she lay curled on the divan, laughing\nup at him, and perfectly unimpressed by his recovered dignity.\n\n\"If he's alive, and you know where he is,\" said Kirby, \"I will pay you\nyour price. Name it!\"\n\n\"Beg for him! There is no other price. The\nHouse-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers burns! Beg for him!\"\n\nNow, the colonel of a regiment of light cavalry is so little given to\nbeg for things that the word beg has almost lapsed out of his\nvocabulary from desuetude.\n\n\"I beg you to tell me where he is,\" he said stiffly, and she clapped\nher hands and laughed with such delight that he blushed to his ears\nagain.\n\n\"I have had a prince on his knees to me, and many a priest,\" she\nchuckled, \"aye, and many a soldier--but never yet a British colonel\nsahib. Kneel and beg!\"\n\n\"Why--what--what d'ye mean?\" demanded Kirby.\n\n\"Is his honor not your honor? I have heard it said. Then beg, Colonel\nsahib, on your knees--on those stiff British knees--beg for the honor\nof Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"D'you mean--d'you mean--?\"\n\n\"Beg for his honor, and beg for his life, on your knees, Colonel sahib!\"\n\n\"I could look the other way, sir,\" whispered Warrington, for the\nregiment's need was very real.\n\n\"Nay, both of you! Ye shall both beg!\" said Yasmini, \"or Ranjoor Singh\nshall taste a hillman's mercy. He shall die so dishonored that the\nregiment shall hang its head in shame.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Kirby. \"His honor is as good as mine!'\n\n\"Then beg for his and thine--on your knees, Colonel sahib!\"\n\nThen it seemed to Colonel Kirby that the room began to swim, for what\nwith the heat and what with an unconquerable dread of snakes, he was\nnot in shape to play his will against this woman's.\n\n\"What if I kneel?\" he asked.\n\n\"I will promise you Ranjoor Singh, alive and clean!\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"In time!\"\n\n\"In time for what?\"\n\n\"Against the regiment's need!\"\n\n\"No use. I want him at once!\" said Colonel Kirby.\n\n\"Then go, sahib! Put out the fire with the sweat that streams from\nthee! Nay, go, both of you--ye have my leave to go! And what is a Sikh\nrisaldar more or less? Nay, go, and let the Jat die!\"\n\nIt is not to be written lightly that the British colonel of Outram's\nOwn and his adjutant both knelt to a native woman--if she is a\nnative--in a top back-room of a Delhi bazaar. But it has to be recorded\nthat for the sake of Ranjoor Singh they did.\n\nThey knelt and placed their foreheads where she bade them, against the\ndivan at her feet, and she poured enough musk in their hair, for the\nlove of mischief, to remind them of what they had done until in the\ncourse of slowly moving nature the smell should die away. And then in a\nsecond the lights went out, each blown by a fan from behind the silken\nhangings.\n\nThey heard her silvery laugh, and they heard her spring to the floor.\nIn cold, creeping sweat they listened to footsteps, and a little voice\nwhispered in Hindustani:\n\n\"This way, sahibs!\"\n\nThey followed, since there was nothing else to do and their pride was\nall gone, to be pushed and pulled by unseen hands and chuckling girls\ndown stairs that were cut out of sheer blackness. And at the foot of\nthe dark a voice that Warrington recognized shed new interest but no\nlight on the mystery.\n\n\"Salaam, sahibs,\" said a fat babu, backing through a door in front of\nthem and showing himself silhouetted against the lesser outer darkness.\n\"Seeing regimental risaldar on the box seat, I took liberty. The\nrisaldar-major is sending this by as yet unrewarded messenger, and word\nto the effect that back way out of burning house was easier than front\nway in. He sends salaam. I am unrewarded messenger.\"\n\nHe slipped something into Colonel Kirby's hands, and Kirby struck a\nmatch to examine it. It was Ranjoor Singh's ring that had the\nregimental crest engraved on it.\n\n\"Not yet rewarded!\" said the babu.\n\n\n  Let the strong take the wall of the weak,\n    (And there's plenty of room in the dust!)\n  Let the bully be brave, but the meek\n    No more in the way than he must.\n  Be crimson and ermine and gold,\n    Good lying and living and mirth,\n  (Oh, laugh and be fat!) the reward of the bold,\n    But--(sotto voce)--the meek shall inherit the earth!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\n\"That's the man whose face was in the mirror!\" said Warrington\nsuddenly, reaching out to seize the babu's collar. \"He's the man who\nwanted to be regimental clerk! He's the man who was offering to eat a\nGerman a day!... No--stand still, and I won't hurt you!\"\n\n\"Bring him out into the fresh air!\" ordered Kirby.\n\nThe illimitable sky did not seem big enough just then; four walls could\nnot hold him. Kirby, colonel of light cavalry, and considered by many\nthe soundest man in his profession, was in revolt against himself; and\nhis collar was a beastly mess.\n\n\"Hurry out of this hole, for heaven's sake!\" he exclaimed.\n\nSo Warrington applied a little science to the babu, and that gentleman\nwent out through a narrow door backward at a speed and at an angle that\nwere new to him--so new that he could not express his sensations in the\nform of speech. The door shut behind them with a slam, and when they\nlooked for it they could see no more than a mark in the wall about\nfifty yards from the bigger door by which they had originally entered.\n\n\"There's the carriage waiting, sir!\" said Warrington, and with a glance\ntoward it to reassure himself, Kirby opened his mouth wide and filled\nhis lungs three times with the fresh, rain-sweetened air.\n\nThere were splashes of rain falling, and he stood with bared head, face\nupward, as if the rain would wash Yasmini's musk from him. It was\nnearly pitch-dark, but Warrington could just see that the risaldar on\nthe box seat raised his whip to them in token of recognition.\n\n\"Now then! Speak, my friend! What were you doing in there?\" demanded\nWarrington.\n\n\"No, not here!\" said Kirby. \"We might be recognized. Bring him into the\nshay.\"\n\nThe babu uttered no complaint, but allowed himself to be pushed along\nat a trot ahead of the adjutant, and bundled head-foremost through the\ncarriage door.\n\n\"Drive slowly!\" ordered Kirby, clambering in last; and the risaldar\nsent the horses forward at a steady trot.\n\n\"Now!\" said Warrington.\n\n\"H-r-r-ump!\" said Kirby.\n\n\"My God, gentlemen!\" said the babu. \"Sahibs, I am innocent of all\ncomplicitee in this or any other eventualitee. I am married man, having\nfamily responsibilitee and other handicaps. Therefore--\"\n\n\"Where did you get this ring?\" demanded Kirby.\n\n\"That? Oh, that!\" said the babu. \"That is veree simplee told. That is\nsimple little matter. There is nothing untoward in that connection.\nRisaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh, who is legal owner of ring, same being\nhis property, gave it into my hand.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\nBoth men demanded to know that in one voice.\n\n\"Sahibs, having no means of telling time, how can I guess?\"\n\n\"How long ago? About how long ago?\"\n\n\"Being elderly person of advancing years and much, adipose tissue, I am\nnot able to observe more than one thing at a time. And yet many things\nhave been forced on my attention. I do not know how long ago.\"\n\n\"Since I saw you outside the barrack gate?\" demanded Warrington.\n\n\"Oh, yes. Oh, certainly. By all means!\"\n\n\"Less than two hours ago, then, sir!\" said Warrington, looking at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Then he isn't burned to death!\" said Kirby, with more satisfaction\nthan he had expressed all the evening.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir! Positivelee not, sahib! The risaldar-major is all\nvitalitee!\"\n\n\"Where did he give you the ring?\"\n\n\"Into the palm of my hand, sahib.\"\n\n\"Where--in what place--in what street--at whose house?\"\n\n\"At nobody's house, sahib. It was in the dark, and the dark is very\nbig.\"\n\n\"Did he give it you at Yasmini's?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sahib! Positivelee not!\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"Sahib, how should I know, who am but elderly person of no metaphysical\nattainments, only failed B.A.?\"\n\n\"What did he say when he gave it to you?\"\n\n\"Sahib, he threatened me!\"\n\n\"Confound you, what did he say?\"\n\n\"He said, '_Babuji_, present this ring to Colonel Kirby sahib. You will\nfind him, _babuji_, where you will find him, but in any case you will\nlose no time at all in finding him. When you have given the ring to him\nhe will ask you questions, and you will say Ranjoor Singh said, \"All\nwill presently be made clear\"; and should you forget the message,\n_babuji_, or should you fail to find him soon, there are those who will\nmake it their urgent business, _babuji_, to open that belly of thine\nand see what is in it!' So, my God, gentlemen! I am veree timid man! I\nhave given the ring and the message, but how will they know that I have\ngiven it? I did not think of that! Moreover, I am unrewarded--I have no\nemolument--as yet!\"\n\n\"How will _who_ know?\" demanded Warrington.\n\n\"They, sahib.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\" asked Kirby.\n\n\"The men who will investigate the inside of my belly, sahib. Oh, a\nbelly is so sensitive! I am afraid!\"\n\n\"Did he tell you who 'they' were?\"\n\n\"No, sahib. Had he done so, I would at once have sought police\nprotection. Not knowing names of individuals, what was use of going to\npolice, who would laugh at me? I went to Yasmini, who understands all\nthings. She laughed, too; but she told me where is Colonel Kirby sahib.\"\n\nColonel Kirby became possessed of a bright idea, his first since\nYasmini had thrown her spell over him.\n\n\"Could you find the way,\" he asked, \"from here to wherever it was that\nRisaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh gave you that ring?\"\n\nThe babu thrust his head out of the carriage window and gazed into the\ndark for several minutes.\n\n\"Conceivablee yes, sahib.\"\n\n\"Then tell the driver where to turn!\"\n\n\"I could direct with more discernment from box-seat,\" said the babu,\nwith a hand on the door.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" commanded Warrington.\n\n\"Let go that handle! What I want to know is why were you so afraid at\nYasmini's?\"\n\n\"I, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yes, you! I saw your face in a mirror, and you were scared nearly to\ndeath. Of what?\"\n\n\"Who is not afraid of Yasmini? Were the sahibs not also afraid?\"\n\n\"Of what besides Yasmini were you afraid? Of what in particular?\"\n\n\"Of her cobras, sahib!\"\n\n\"What of them?\" demanded Warrington, with a reminiscent shudder.\n\n\"Certain of her women showed them to me.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To further convince me, sahib, had that been necessary. Oh, but I was\nalready quite convinced. Bravery is not my _vade mecum!_\"\n\n\"Confound the man! To convince you of what?\"\n\n\"That if I tell too much one of those snakes will shortlee be my\nbedmate. Ah! To think of it causes me to perspirate with sweat. Sahibs,\nthat is a--\"\n\n\"You shall go to jail if you don't tell me what I want to know!\" said\nKirby.\n\n\"Ah, sahib, I was jail clerk once--dismissed for minor offenses but\ncumulative in effect. Being familiar with inside of jail, am able to\nmake choice.\"\n\n\"Get on the box-seat with him!\" commanded Kirby. \"Let him show the\ndriver where to turn. But watch him! Keep hold of him!\"\n\nSo again the babu was propelled on an involuntary course, and\nWarrington proceeded to pinch certain of his fat parts to encourage him\nto mount the box with greater speed; but his helplessness became so\nobvious that Warrington turned friend and shoved him up at last,\nkeeping hold of his loin-cloth when he wedged his own muscular anatomy\ninto the small space left.\n\n\"To the right,\" said the babu, pointing. And the risaldar drove to the\nright.\n\n\"To the left,\" said the babu, and Warrington made note of the fact that\nthey were not so very far away from the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers.\n\nSoon the babu began to scratch his stomach.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded Warrington.\n\n\"They said they would cut my belly open, sahib! A belly is so\nsensitive!\"\n\nWarrington laughed sympathetically; for the fear was genuine and\ncandidly expressed. The babu continued scratching.\n\n\"To the right,\" he said after a while, and the risaldar drove to the\nright, toward where a Hindu temple cast deep shadows, and a row of\ntrees stood sentry in spasmodic moonlight. In front of the temple,\nseated on a mat, was a wandering fakir of the none-too-holy type. By\nhis side was a flat covered basket.\n\n\"Look, sahib!\" said the babu; and Warrington looked.\n\n\"My belly crawls!\"\n\n\"What's the matter, man?\"\n\n\"He is a fakir. There are snakes in that basket--cobras, sahib!\nOw-ow-ow!\"\n\nWarrington, swaying precariously over the edge, held tight by the\nloin-cloth, depending on it as a yacht in a tideway would to three\nhundred pounds of iron.\n\n\"Oh, cobras are so veree dreadful creatures!\" wailed the babu,\ncaressing his waist again. \"Look, sahib! Look! Oh, look! Between devil\nand over-sea what should a man do? Ow!\"\n\nThe carriage lurched at a mud-puddle. The babu's weight lurched with\nit, and Warrington's center of gravity shifted. The babu seemed to\nshrug himself away from the snakes, but the effect was to shove\nWarrington the odd half-inch it needed to put him overside. He clung to\nthe loin-cloth and pulled hard to haul himself back again, and the\nloin-cloth came away.\n\n\"Halt!\" yelled Warrington; and the risaldar reined in.\n\nBut the horses took fright and plunged forward, though the risaldar\nswore afterward that the babu did nothing to them; he supposed it must\nhave been the fakir squatting in the shadows that scared them.\n\nAnd whatever it may have been--snakes or not--that had scared the babu,\nit had scared all his helplessness away. Naked from shirt to socks, he\nrolled like a big ball backward over the carriage top, fell to earth\nbehind the carriage, bumped into Warrington, who was struggling to his\nfeet, knocking him down again, and departed for the temple shadows,\nscreaming. The temple door slammed just as Warrington started after him.\n\nBy that time the risaldar had got the horses stopped, and Colonel Kirby\nrealized what had happened.\n\n\"Come back, Warrington!\" he ordered peremptorily.\n\nWarrington obeyed, but without enthusiasm.\n\n\"I can run faster than that fat brute, sir!\" he said. \"And I saw him go\ninto the temple. We won't find Ranjoor Singh now in a month of Sundays!\"\n\nHe was trying to wipe the mud from himself with the aid of the\nloin-cloth.\n\n\"Anyhow, I've got the most important part of his costume,\" he said\nvindictively. \"Gad, I'd like to get him on the run now through the\npublic street!\"\n\n\"Come along in!\" commanded Kirby, opening the door. \"There has been\ntrouble enough already without a charge of temple breaking. Tell the\nrisaldar to drive back to quarters. I'm going to get this musk out of\nmy hair before dawn!\"\n\nWarrington sniffed as he climbed in. The outer night had given him at\nleast a standard by which to judge things.\n\n\"I'd give something to listen to the first man who smells the inside of\nthis shay!\" he said cheerily. \"D 'you suppose we can blame it on the\nbabu, sir?\"\n\n\"We can try!\" said Kirby. \"Is that his loin-cloth you've got still?\"\n\n\"Didn't propose to leave it in the road for him to come and find, sir!\nHis present shame is about the only consolation prize we get out of the\nevening's sport. I wish it smelt of musk--but it doesn't; it smells of\nbabu--straight babu, undiluted. Hallo--what's this?\"\n\nHe began to untwist a corner of the cloth, holding it up to get a\nbetter view of it in the dim light that entered through the window. He\nproduced a piece of paper that had to be untwisted, too.\n\n\"Got a match, sir?\"\n\nKirby struck one.\n\n\"It's addressed to 'Colonel Kirby sahib!' Bet you it's from Ranjoor\nSingh! Now--d'you suppose that heathen meant to hold on to that until\nhe could get his price for it?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" said Kirby with indifference, opening the note as fast as\ntrembling fingers could unfold it. He would not have admitted to\nhimself what his fingers told so plainly--the extent of his regard for\nRanjoor Singh.\n\nThe note was short, and Kirby read it aloud, since it was not marked\nprivate, and there was nothing in it that even the babu might not have\nread:\n\n\"To Colonel Kirby sahib, from his obedient servant, Risaldar-Major\nRanjoor Singh--Leave of absence being out of question after declaration\nof war, will Colonel Kirby sahib please put in Order of the Day that\nRisaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh is assigned to special duty, or words to\nsame effect?\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Warrington.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"Suppose it's a forgery?\"\n\n\"The ring rather proves it isn't, and I've another way of knowing.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\nThey sat in silence in the swaying shay until the smell of musk and the\nsense of being mystified became too much for Warrington, and he began\nto hum to himself. Humming brought about a return to his usual\nwide-awakefulness, and he began to notice things.\n\n\"Shay rides like a gun,\" he said suddenly.\n\nKirby grunted.\n\n\"All the weight's behind and--\" He put his head out of the window to\ninvestigate, but Kirby ordered him to sit still.\n\n\"Want to be recognized?\" he demanded. \"Keep your head inside, you young\nass!\"\n\nSo Warrington sat back against the cushions until the guard at the\nbarrack gate turned out to present arms to the risaldar's raised whip.\nAs if he understood the requirements of the occasion without being\ntold, the risaldar sent the horses up the drive at a hard gallop. It\nwas rather more than half-way up the drive that Warrington spoke again.\n\n\"Feel that, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"I ordered that place to be seen to yesterday!\" growled Kirby. \"Why\nwasn't it done?\"\n\n\"It was, sir.\"\n\n\"Why did we bump there, then?\"\n\n\"Why aren't we running like a gun any longer?\" wondered Warrington.\n\"Felt to me as if we'd dropped a load.\"\n\n\"Well, here we are, thank God! What do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Rounds,\" said Warrington.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nKirby dived through his door, while Warrington went behind the shay to\nhave a good look for causes. He could find none, although a black\nleather apron, usually rolled up behind in order to be strapped over\nbaggage when required, was missing.\n\n\"Didn't see who took that apron, did you?\" he asked the risaldar; but\nthe risaldar had not known that it was gone.\n\n\"All right, then, and thank you!\" said Warrington, walking off into the\ndarkness bareheaded, to help the smell evaporate from his hair; and the\nshay rumbled away to its appointed place, with the babu's loin-cloth\ninside it on the front seat.\n\nIt need surprise nobody that Colonel Kirby found time first to go to\nhis bathroom. His regiment was as ready for active service at any\nminute as a fire-engine should be--in that particular, India's speed is\nas three to Prussia's one. The moment orders to march should come, he\nwould parade it in full marching order and lead it away. But there were\nno orders yet; he had merely had warning.\n\nSo he sent for dog-soap and a brush, and proceeded to scour his head.\nAfter twenty minutes of it, and ten changes of water, when he felt that\nhe dared face his own servant without blushing, he made that wondering\nSikh take turns at shampooing him until he could endure the friction no\nlonger.\n\n\"What does my head smell of now?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Musk, sahib!\"\n\n\"Not of dog-soap?\"\n\n\"No, sahib!\"\n\n\"Bring that carbolic disinfectant here!\"\n\nThe servant obeyed, and Kirby mixed a lotion that would outsmell most\nthings. He laved his head in it generously, and washed it off sparingly.\n\n\"Bring me brown paper?\" he ordered then; and again the wide-eyed Sikh\nobeyed.\n\nKirby rolled the paper into torches, and giving the servant one,\nproceeded to fumigate the room and his own person until not even a\nbloodhound could have tracked him back to Yasmini's, and the reek of\nmusk had been temporarily, at least, subdued into quiescence.\n\n\"Go and ask Major Brammle to come and see me,\" said Kirby then.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrammle came in sniffing, and Kirby cursed him through tight lips with\nwords that were no less fervent for lack of being heard.\n\n\"Hallo! Burning love-letters? The whole mess is doin' the same thing.\nHaven't had time to burn mine yet--was busy sorting things over when\nyou called. Look here!\"\n\nHe opened the front of his mess-jacket and produced a little lace\nhandkerchief, a glove and a powder-puff.\n\n\"Smell 'em!\" he said. \"Patchouli! Shame to burn 'em, what? S'pose I\nmust, though.\"\n\n\"Any thing happen while I was gone?\" asked Kirby.\n\n\"Yes. Most extraordinary thing. You know that a few hours ago D\nSquadron were all sitting about in groups looking miserable? We set it\ndown to their trooper being murdered and another man being missing.\nWell, just about the time you and Warrington drove off in the mess\nshay, they all bucked up and began grinning! Wouldn't say a word. Just\ngrinned, and became the perkiest squadron of the lot!\n\n\"Now they're all sleeping like two-year-olds. Reason? Not a word of\nreason! I saw young Warrington just now on his way to their quarters\nwith a lantern, and if he can find any of 'em awake perhaps he can get\nthe truth out of 'em, for they'll talk to him when they won't to\nanybody else. By the way, Warrington can't have come in with you, did\nhe?\"\n\nKirby ignored the question.\n\n\"Did you tell Warrington to go and ask them?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes. Passed him in the dark, but did not recognize him by the smell.\nNo--no! Got as near him as I could, and then leaned up against the\nscent to have a word with him! Musk! Never smelt anything like it in my\nlife! Talk about girls! He must be in love with half India, and native\nat that! Brazen-faced young monkey! I asked him where he got the\ndisinfectant, and he told me he fell into a mud-puddle!\"\n\n\"Perhaps he did,\" said Kirby. \"Was there mud on him?\"\n\n\"Couldn't see. Didn't dare get so near him! Don't you think he ought to\nbe spoken to? I mean, the eve of war's the eve of war and all that kind\nof thing, but--\"\n\n\"I wish you'd let me see the Orders of the Day,\" Kirby interrupted. \"I\nwant to make an addition to them.\"\n\n\"I'll send an orderly.\"\n\n\"Wish you would.\"\n\nFive minutes later Kirby sat at his private desk, while Brammle puffed\nat a cigar by the window. Kirby, after a lot of thinking, wrote:\n\n\"Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh (D Squadron) assigned to special duty.\"\n\nHe handed the orders back to Brammle, and the major eyed the addition\nwith subdued amazement.\n\n\"What'll D Squadron say?\" he asked.\n\n\"Remains to be seen,\" said Kirby.\n\nOutside in the muggy blackness that shuts down on India in the rains,\nWarrington walked alone, swinging a lantern and chuckling to himself as\nhe reflected what D Squadron would be likely to invent as a reason for\nthe smell that walked with him. For he meant to wake D Squadron and\nlearn things.\n\nBut all at once it occurred to him that he had left the babu's\nloin-cloth on the inside front seat of the shay; and, because if that\nwere seen it would have given excuse for a thousand tales too many and\ntoo imaginative, he hurried in search of it, taking a short cut to\nwhere by that time the shay should be. On his way, close to his\ndestination, he stumbled over something soft that tripped him. He\nstooped, swung the lantern forward, and picked up--the missing leather\napron from behind the shay.\n\nThe footpath on which he stood was about a yard wide; the shay could\nnot possibly have come along it. And it certainly had been behind the\nshay when they left barracks. Moreover, close examination proved it to\nbe the identical apron beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\nWarrington began to hum to himself. And then he ceased from humming.\nThen he set the lantern down and stepped away from it sidewise until\nits light no longer shone on him. He listened, as a dog does, with\nintelligence and skill. Then, suddenly, he sprang and lit on a bulky\nmass that yielded--gasped--spluttered--did anything but yell.\n\n\"So you rode on the luggage-rack behind the carriage, did you,\n_babuji?_\" he smiled. \"And curled under the apron to look like luggage\nwhen we passed the guard, eh?\"\n\n\"But, my God, sahib!\" said a plaintive voice. \"Should I walk through\nDelhi naked? You, who wear pants, you laugh at me, but I assure you,\nsahib--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" ordered Warrington; and the babu seemed very glad to hush.\n\n\"There was a note in a corner of that cloth of yours!\"\n\n\"And the sahib found it? Oh, then I am relieved. I am preserved from\npangs of mutual regret!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you give that note to Colonel Kirby sahib when you had the\nchance? Eh?\" asked Warrington, keeping firm hold of him.\n\n\"Sahib! Your honor! Not being yet remunerated on account of ring and\nverbal message duly delivered, commercial precedent was all on my side\nthat I should retain further article of value pending settlement. Now,\nI ask you--\"\n\n\"Where was Ranjoor Singh when he gave you that ring and message?\"\ndemanded Warrington sternly, increasing his grip on the babu's fat arm.\n\n\"Sahib, when I have received payment for first service rendered, my\ndisposition may be changed. I am as yet in condition of _forma\npauperis._\"\n\nStill holding him tight, Warrington produced twenty rupees in paper\nmoney.\n\n\"Can you see those, _babuji_? See them? Then earn them!\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, sahib, I have positivelee earned a lakh of rupees this\nnight already!\"\n\n\"Where was Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh when he--\"\n\nFootsteps were approaching--undoubtedly a guard on his way to\ninvestigate. The babu seemed to sense Warrington's impatience.\n\n\n\"Sahib,\" he said, \"I am very meek person, having family of wife and\nchildren all dependent. Is that rupees twenty? I would graciously\naccept same, and positivelee hold my tongue!\"\n\nThe steps came nearer.\n\n\"I was on my way to D Squadron quarters, sahib, to narrate story and\npass begging bowl. Total price of story rupees twenty. Or else the\nsahib may deliver me to guard, and guard shall be regaled free gratis\nwith full account of evening's amusement? Yes?\"\n\nThe steps came nearer yet. Recognizing an officer, the men halted a few\npaces away.\n\n\"Sahib, for sum of rupees twenty I could hold tongue for twenty years,\nunless in meantime deceased, in which case--\"\n\n\"Take 'em!\" ordered Warrington; and the babu's fingers shut tight on\nthe money.\n\n\"Guard!\" ordered Warrington. \"Put this babu out into the street!\"\n\n\"Good night, sahib!\" said the babu. \"Kindlee present my serious\nrespects to the colonel sahib. Salaam, sahib!\"\n\nBut Warrington had gone into the darkness.\n\n\n  The Four Winds come, the Four Winds go,\n    (Ye wise o' the world, oh, listen ye!),\n  Whispering, whistling what they know,\n  Wise, since wandering made them so\n    (Ye stay-at-homes, oh, listen ye!).\n  Ever they seek and sift and pry--\n  Listening here, and hurrying by--\n  Restless, ceaseless--know ye why?\n    (Then, wise o' the world, oh, listen ye!)\n  The goal of the search of the hurrying wind\n  Is the key to the maze of a woman's mind,\n    (And there is no key! Oh, listen ye!)\n\nYASMINI'S SONG.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSo in a darkness that grew blacker every minute, Warrington swung his\nlantern and found his way toward D Squadron's quarters. He felt rather\npleased with himself. From his own point of view he would have rather\nenjoyed to have a story anent himself and Yasmini go the round of\nbarracks--with modifications, of course, and the kneeling part left\nout--but he realized that it would not do at all to have Colonel\nKirby's name involved in anything of the sort, and he rather flattered\nhimself on his tact in bribing the babu or being blackmailed by him.\n\n\"Got to admit that babu's quite a huntsman!\" he told himself, beginning\nto hum. \"One day, if the war doesn't account for me, I'll come back and\ntake a fall out of that babu. Hallo--what's that? Who in thunder--who's\nwaking up the horses at this unearthly hour? Sick horse, I suppose. Why\ndon't they get him out and let the others sleep?\"\n\nHe began to hurry. A light in stables close to midnight was not to be\naccounted for on any other supposition than an accident or serious\nemergency, and if there were either it was his affair as adjutant to\nknow all the facts at once.\n\n\"What's going on in there?\" he shouted in a voice of authority while he\nwas yet twenty yards away.\n\nBut there was no answer. He could hear a horse plunge, but nothing more.\n\n\"Um-m-m! Horse cast himself!\" he straightway decided.\n\nBut there was no cast horse, as he was aware the moment he had looked\ndown both long lines of sleepy brutes that whickered their protest\nagainst interrupted sleep. At the far end he could see that two men\nlabored, and a big horse fiercely resented their unseasonable\nattentions to himself. He walked down the length of the stable, and\npresently recognized Bagh, Ranjoor Singh's charger.\n\n\"What are you grooming him for at this hour?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It is an order, sahib.\"\n\n\"Whose order?\"\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh sahib's order.\"\n\n\"The deuce it is! When did the order come?\"\n\n\"But now.\"\n\n\"Who brought it?\"\n\n\"A babu, with a leather apron.\"\n\nWarrington walked away ten paces in order to get command of himself,\nand pinch himself, and make quite sure he was awake.\n\n\"A fat babu?\" he asked, walking back again.\n\n\"Very fat,\" said one of the troopers, continuing to brush the resentful\ncharger.\n\n\"So he delivered his message first, and then went to hunt for his\nloin-cloth!\" mused Warrington. \"And he had enough intuition, and guts\nenough, to look for it first in the shay! I'm beginning to admire that\nman!\" Aloud he asked the trooper: \"What was the wording of the\nrisaldar-major sahib's message?\"\n\n\"'Let Bagh be well groomed and held ready against all contingencies!'\"\nsaid the trooper.\n\n\"Then take him outside!\" ordered Warrington. \"Groom him where you won't\ndisturb the other horses! How often have you got to be told that a\nhorse needs sleep as much as a man? The squadron won't be fit to march\na mile if you keep 'em awake all night! Lead him out quietly, now!\nWhoa, you brute! Now--take him out and keep him out--put him in the end\nstall in my stable when you've finished him--d'you hear?\"\n\nHe flattered himself again. With all these mysterious messages and\norders coming in from nowhere, he told himself it would be good to know\nat all times where Ranjoor Singh's charger was, as well as a service to\nRanjoor Singh to stable the brute comfortably. He told himself that was\na very smart move, and one for which Ranjoor Singh would some day thank\nhim, provided, of course, that--\n\n\"Provided what?\" he wondered half aloud. \"Seems to me as if Ranjoor\nSingh has got himself into some kind of a scrape, and hopes to get out\nof it by the back-door route and no questions asked! Well, let's hope\nhe gets out! Let's hope there'll be no court-martial nastiness! Let's\nhope--oh, damn just hoping! Ranjoor Singh's a better man than I am.\nHere's believing in him! Here's to him, thick and thin!\nForward--walk--march!\"\n\nHe turned out the guard, and the particular troop sergeant with whom he\nwished to speak not being on duty, he ordered him sent for. Ten minutes\nlater the sergeant came, still yawning, from his cot.\n\n\"Come over here, Arjan Singh,\" he called, thinking fast and furiously\nas he led the way.\n\nIf he made one false move or aroused one suspicion in the man's mind,\nhe was likely to learn less than nothing; but if he did not appear to\nknow at least something, he would probably learn nothing either.\n\nAs he turned, at a distance from the guard-room light, to face the\nsergeant, though not to meet his eyes too keenly, the fact that would\nnot keep out of his brain was that the fat babu had been out in the\nroad, offering to eat Germans, a little while before he and the colonel\nhad started out that evening. And, according to what Brammle had told\nhim when they met near the colonel's quarters, it was very shortly\nafter that that the squadron came out of its gloom.\n\n\"What was the first message that the babu brought this evening?\" he\nasked, still being very careful not to look into the sergeant's eyes.\nHe spoke as comrade to comrade--servant of the \"Salt\" to servant of the\n\"Salt.\"\n\n\"Which babu, sahib?\" asked Arjan Singh, unblinking.\n\nNow, in all probability, this man--since he had been asleep--knew\nnothing about the message to groom Bagh. To have answered, \"The babu\nwho spoke about the charger,\" might have been a serious mistake.\n\n\"Arjan Singh, look me in the eyes!\" he ordered, and the Sikh obeyed. He\nwas taller than Warrington, and looked down on him.\n\n\"Are you a true friend of the risaldar-major?\"\n\n\"May I die, sahib, if I am not!\"\n\n\"And I? What of me? Am I his friend or his enemy?\"\n\nThe sergeant hesitated.\n\n\"Can I read men's hearts?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Warrington. \"And so can I. That is why I had you called\nfrom your sleep. I sent for you to learn the truth. What was the\nmessage given by the fat babu to one of the guard by the outer gate\nthis evening, and delivered by him or by some other man to D Squadron?\"\n\n\"Sahib, it was not a written message.\"\n\n\"Repeat it to me.\"\n\n\"Sahib, it was verbal. I can not remember it.\"\n\n\"Arjan Singh, you lie! Did I ever lie to you? Did I ever threaten you\nand not carry out my threats--promise you and not keep my promise? I am\na soldier! Are you a cur?\"\n\n\"God forbid, sahib! I--\"\n\n\"Arjan Singh! Repeat that message to me word for word, please, not as a\nfavor, nor as obeying an order, but as a friend of Ranjoor Singh to a\nfriend of Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"The message was to the squadron, not to me, sahib.\"\n\n\"Are you not of the squadron?\"\n\n\"Make it an order, sahib!\"\n\n\"Certainly not--nor a favor either!\"\n\n\"Sahib, I--\"\n\n\"Nor will I threaten you! I guarantee you absolute immunity if you\nrefuse to repeat it. My word on it! I am Ranjoor Singh's friend, and I\nask of his friend!\"\n\n\"The babu said: 'Says Ranjoor Singh, \"Let the squadron be on its best\nbehavior! Let the squadron know that surely before the blood runs he\nwill be there to lead it, wherever it is! Meanwhile, let the squadron\nbe worthy of its salt and of its officers!\"'\"\n\n\"Was that all?\" asked Warrington.\n\n\"All, sahib. May my tongue rot if I lie!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Arjan Singh. That's all. You needn't mention our\nconversation. Good night.\"\n\n\"Fooled,\" chuckled Warrington. \"She's fooled us to the limit of our\nspecial bent, and I take it that's stiff-neckedness!\"\n\nHe hurried away toward Colonel Kirby's quarters, swinging his lantern\nand humming to himself.\n\n\"And this isn't the Arabian Nights!\" he told himself. \"It's\nDelhi--Twentieth Century A.D.! Gad! Wouldn't the whole confounded army\nrock with laughter!\"\n\nThen he stopped chuckling, to hurry faster, for a giant horn had rooted\nchunks out of the blackness by the barrack gate, and now what sounded\nlike a racing car was tearing up the drive. The head-lights dazzled\nhim, but he ran and reached the colonel's porch breathless. He was\nadmitted at once, and found the colonel and Brammle together, facing an\naide-de-camp. In the colonel's hand was a medium-sized, sealed envelope.\n\n\"Shall I repeat it, sir?\" asked the aide-de-camp.\n\n\"Yes, if you think it necessary\" answered Kirby.\n\n\"The sealed orders are not to be opened until out at sea. You are\nexpected to parade at dawn the day after to-morrow, and there will be\nsomebody from headquarters to act as guide for the occasion. In fact,\nyou will be guided at each point until it is time to open your orders.\nNo explanations will be given about anything until later on. That's\nall. Good night, sir--and good luck!\"\n\nThe aide-de-camp held out his hand, and Colonel Kirby shook it a trifle\nperfunctorily; he was not much given to display of sentiment. The\naide-de-camp saluted, and a minute later the giant car spurned the\ngravel out from under its rear wheels as it started off to warn another\nregiment.\n\n\"So we've got our route!\" said Kirby.\n\n\"And, thank God, we take our own horses!\" said Brammle fervently.\n\n\"Bet you a thousand the other end's Marseilles!\" said Warrington.\n\"We're in luck. They'd have mounted us on bus-horses if we hadn't\nbrought our own; we'd have had to ring a bell to start and stop a\nsquadron. Who wouldn't be light cavalry?\"\n\nKirby put the sealed letter in an inside pocket.\n\n\"I'm going to sleep,\" said Brammle, yawning. \"Night, sir!\"\n\n\"Night!\" said Kirby; but Warrington stayed on. He went and stood near\nthe window, and when Kirby had seen Brammle to the door, he joined him\nthere.\n\n\"What now, Warrington?\"\n\n\"Caught 'em grooming Ranjoor Singh's charger in the dark!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Said it was an order from Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I don't know what to make of it.\"\n\n\"That isn't nearly the worst, sir. Listen to this! Long before Yasmini\npromised us--before we knelt to save his life and honor--Ranjoor Singh\nhad sent a message to his squadron guaranteein' to be with 'em before\nthe blood runs! Specific guarantee, and no conditions!\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir!\"\n\n\"She fooled us, eh?\"\n\n\"D'you suppose she's for or against the government, sir?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Thank God we've got our marching orders! Go and wash\nyour head! And, Warrington--hold your tongue!\"\n\nWarrington held up his right hand.\n\n\"So help me, sir!\" he grinned, \"But will she hold hers?\"\n\n\n  Westward, into the hungry West,\n    (Oh, listen, wise men, listen ye!)\n  Whirls the East Wind on his quest,\n  Whimpering, worrying, hurrying, lest\n    The light o'ertake him. Listen ye!\n  Mark ye the burden of his sigh:\n  \"Westward sinks the sun to die!\n  Westward wing the vultures!\"--Aye,\n    (Listen, wise men, listen ye!)\n  The East must lose--the West must gain,\n  For none come back to the East again,\n    Though widows call them! Listen ye!\n\nYASMINI'S SONG.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nNow, India is unlike every other country in the world in all\nparticulars, and Delhi is in some respects the very heart through which\nIndia's unusualness flows. Delhi has five railway stations with which\nto cope with latter-day floods of paradoxical necessity; and nobody\nknew from which railway station troops might be expected to entrain or\nwhither, although Delhi knew that there was war.\n\nThere did not seem to be anything very much out of the ordinary at any\nof the stations. In India one or two sidings are nearly always full of\nempty trains; there did not seem to be more of them than usual.\n\nAt the British barracks there was more or less commotion, because\nThomas Atkins likes to voice his joy when the long peace breaks at last\nand he may justify himself; but in the native lines, where dignity is\ndifferently understood, the only men who really seemed unusually busy\nwere the farriers, and the armourers who sharpened swords.\n\nThe government offices appeared to be undisturbed, and certainly no\nmore messengers ran about than usual, the only difference was that one\nor two of them were open at a very early hour. But even in them--and\nEnglishmen were busy in them--there seemed no excitement. Delhi had\nfound time in a night to catch her breath and continue listening; for,\nunlike most big cities that brag with or without good reason, Delhi is\nlistening nearly all the time.\n\nA man was listening in the dingiest of all the offices on the ground\nfloor of a big building on the side away from the street--a man in a\ndrab silk suit, who twisted a leather watch-guard around his thumb and\nuntwisted it incessantly. There was a telephone beside him, and a\nfair-sized pile of telegraph forms, but beyond that not much to show\nwhat his particular business might be. He did not look aggressive, but\nhe seemed nervous, for he jumped perceptibly when the telephone-bell\nrang; and being a government telephone, with no commercial aims, it did\nnot ring loud.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with the receiver at his ear. \"Yes, yes. Who else? Oh,\nI forgot for the moment. Four, three, two, nine, two. Give yours! Very\nwell, I'm listening.\"\n\nWhoever was speaking at the other end had a lot to say, and none of it\ncan have been expected, for the man in the drab silk suit twisted his\nwrinkled face and worked his eyes in a hundred expressions that began\nwith displeasure and passed through different stages of surprise to\nacquiescence.\n\n\"I want you to know,\" he said, \"that I got my information at first\nhand. I got it from Yasmini herself, from three of the hill-men who\nwere present, and from the Afridi who was kicked and beaten. All except\nthe Afridi, who wasn't there by that time, agreed that Ranjoor Singh\nhad words with the German afterward. Eh? What's that?\"\n\nHe listened again for about five minutes, and then hung up the receiver\nwith an expression of mixed irritation and amusement.\n\n\"Caught me hopping on the wrong leg this time!\" he muttered, beginning\nto twist at his watch-guard again.\n\nPresently he sat up and looked bored, for he heard the fast trot of a\nbig, long-striding horse. A minute later a high dogcart drew up in the\nstreet, and he heard a man's long--striding footsteps coming round the\ncorner.\n\n\"Like horse, like man, like regiment!\" he muttered. \"Pick his stride or\nhis horse's out of a hundred, and\"--he pulled out his nickel\nwatch--\"he's ten minutes earlier than I expected him! Morning, Colonel\nKirby!\" he said pleasantly, as Kirby strode in, helmet in hand. \"Take a\nseat.\"\n\nHe noticed Kirby's scalp was red and that he smelt more than faintly of\ncarbolic.\n\n\"Morning!\" said Kirby.\n\n\"I'm wondering what's brought you,\" said the man in drab.\n\n\"I've come about Ranjoor Singh,\" said Kirby; and the man in drab tried\nto look surprised.\n\n\"What about him? Reconsidered yesterday's decision?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kirby. \"I've come to ask what news you have of him.\" And\nKirby's eye, that some men seemed to think so like a bird's, transfixed\nthe man in drab, so that he squirmed as if he had been impaled.\n\n\"You must understand, Colonel Kirby--in fact, I'm sure you do\nunderstand--that my business doesn't admit of confidences. Even if I\nwanted to divulge information, I'm not allowed to. I stretched a point\nyesterday when I confided in you my suspicions regarding Ranjoor Singh,\nbut that doesn't imply that I'm going to tell you all I know. I asked\nyou what _you_ knew, you may remember.\"\n\n\"I told you!\" snapped Kirby. \"Is Ranjoor Singh still under suspicion?\"\n\nThat was a straight question of the true Kirby type that admitted of no\nevasion, and the man in drab pulled his watch out, knocking it on the\ndesk absent-mindedly, as if it were an egg that he wished to crack. He\nmust either answer or not, it seemed, so he did neither.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" he parried.\n\n\"I've a right to know! Ranjoor Singh's my wing commander, and a better\nofficer or a more loyal gentleman doesn't exist. I want him! I want to\nknow where he is! And if he's under a cloud, I want to know why! Where\nis he?\"\n\n\"I don't know where he is,\" said the man in drab. \"Is he--ah--absent\nwithout leave?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Kirby. \"I've seen to that!\"\n\n\"Then you've communicated with him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then if his regiment were to march without him--\"\n\n\"It won't if I can help it!\" said Kirby.\n\n\"And if you can't help it, Colonel Kirby?\"\n\n\"In that case he has got what he asked for, and there can be no charge\nagainst him until he shows up.\"\n\n\"I understand you have your marching orders?\"\n\n\"I have sealed orders!\" snapped Kirby.\n\n\"To be opened at sea?\"\n\n\"To be opened when I see fit!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby. \"I asked you is Ranjoor Singh still under suspicion!\"\n\n\"My good sir, I am not the arbiter of Ranjoor Singh's destiny! How\nshould I know?\"\n\n\"I intend to know!\" vowed Kirby, rising.\n\n\"I'm prepared to state that Ranjoor Singh is not in danger of arrest. I\ndon't see that you have right to ask more than that, Colonel Kirby.\nMartial law has been declared this morning, and things don't take their\nordinary course any longer, you know.\"\n\nKirby paced once across the office floor, and once back again. Then he\nfaced the man in drab as a duelist faces his antagonist.\n\n\"I don't like to go over men's heads,\" he said, \"as you threatened to\ndo to me, for instance, yesterday. If you will give me satisfactory\nassurance that Ranjoor Singh is being treated as a loyal officer should\nbe, I will ask no more. If not, I shall go now to the general\ncommanding. As you say, there's martial law now, he's the man to see.\"\n\n\"Colonel Kirby,\" said the man in drab, twisting at his watch-guard\nfuriously, \"if you'll tell me what's in your sealed orders--open them\nand see--I'll tell you what I know about Ranjoor Singh, and we'll call\nit a bargain!\"\n\n\"I wasn't joking,\" said Kirby, turning red as his scalp from the roots\nof his hair to his collar.\n\n\"I'm in deadly earnest!\" said the man in drab.\n\nSo, without a word more, Colonel Kirby hurried out again, carrying his\nsaber in his left hand at an angle that was peculiar to him, and that\nillustrated determination better than words could have done.\n\nHis huge horse plunged away almost before he had gained the seat, and,\nsaber and all, he gained the seat at a step-and-a-jump. But the sais\nwas not up behind, and Kirby had scarcely settled down to drive before\nthe man in drab had the telephone mouthpiece to his lips and had given\nhis mysterious number again--4-3-2-9-2.\n\n\"He's coming, sir!\" he said curtly.\n\nSomebody at the other end apparently asked, \"Who is coming?\" for the\nman in drab answered:\n\n\"Kirby.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes later Kirby caught a general at breakfast, and was\nreceived with courtesy and feigned surprise.\n\n\"D'you happen to know anything about my risaldar-major, Ranjoor Singh?\"\nasked Kirby, after a hasty apology for bursting in.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He was under suspicion yesterday--I was told so. Next he disappeared.\nThen I received a message from him asking me to assign him to special\nduty; that was after I'd more than half believed him burned to death in\na place called the 'House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers.' He has sent some\nmost extraordinary messages to his squadron by the hand of a mysterious\nbabu, but not a word of explanation of any kind. Can you tell me\nanything about him, sir?\"\n\n\"Wasn't a trooper of yours murdered yesterday?\" the general asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"And another missing?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did Ranjoor Singh go off to search for the missing man?\"\n\n\"I was told so.\"\n\n\"H-rrrr-ump! Well, I'm glad you came; you've saved me trouble! Did you\nput Ranjoor Singh in Orders as assigned to special duty?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What is the missing trooper's name?\"\n\n\"Jagut Singh.\"\n\n\"Well, please enter him in Orders, too.\"\n\n\"Special service?\"\n\n\"Special service,\" said the general. \"How about Ranjoor Singh's\ncharger?\"\n\n\"I understand that he's been kept well groomed by Ranjoor Singh's\norders, and my adjutant tells me he has the horse in care in his own\nstable.\"\n\nThe general made a note.\n\n\"Whose stable?\" lie asked.\n\n\"Warrington's.\"\n\n\"Warrington, of Outram's Own, eh? Captain Warrington?\"\n\nThe general wrote that down, while Kirby watched him bewildered.\n\n\"Well now, Kirby, that'll be all right Have the horse left there, will\nyou? I hope You've been able to dispose of your own horses to\nadvantage. Two chargers don't seem a large allowance for a commanding\nofficer of a cavalry regiment, but that's all you can take with you.\nYou'll have to leave the rest behind.\"\n\n\"Haven't given it a thought, sir! Too busy thinking about Ranjoor\nSingh. Worried about him.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't worry!\" said the general. \"Ranjoor Singh's all right.\"\n\n\"That's the first assurance I've had of it, except by way of a\nmysterious note,\" said Kirby.\n\n\"By all right, I mean that he isn't in disgrace. But now about your\nhorses and private effects. You've done nothing about them?\"\n\n\"I'll have time to attend to that this afternoon, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you won't. That's why I'm glad you came! These\"--he gave him a\nsealed envelope--\"are supplementary orders, to be opened when you get\nback to barracks. I want you out of the way by noon if possible. We'll\nsend a man down this morning to take charge of whatever any of you want\nkept, and you'd better tell him to sell the rest and pay the money to\nyour bankers; he'll be a responsible officer. That's all. Good-by,\nKirby, and good luck!\"\n\nThe general held out his hand.\n\n\"One more minute, sir,\" said Kirby. \"About Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"Well, sir--what about him?\"\n\n\"What have you heard?\"\n\n\"That--I've heard a sort of promise that he'll be with his squadron, to\nlead it, before the blood runs.\"\n\n\"Won't that be time enough?\" asked the general, smiling. He was looking\nat Kirby very closely. \"Not sick, are you?\" he asked. \"No? I thought\nyour scalp looked rather redder than usual.\"\n\nKirby flushed to the top of his collar instantly, and the general\npretended to arrange a sheaf of papers on the table.\n\n\"One reason why you're being sent first, my boy,\" said the general,\nholding out his hand again, \"is that you and your regiment are fittest\nto be sent. But I've taken into consideration, too, that I don't want\nyou or your adjutant killed by a cobra in any event.\nAnd--_snf--snf_--the salt sea air gets rid of the smell of musk quicker\nthan anything. Good-by, Kirby, my boy, and God bless you!\"\n\n\"Good-by, sir!\"\n\nKirby stammered the words, and almost ran down the steps to his waiting\ndog-cart. As all good men do, when undeserved ridicule or blame falls\nto their lot, he wondered what in the world he could have done wrong.\n\nHe had no blame for anybody, only a fierce resentment of injustice--an\nalmost savage sense of shame that any one should know about the\nadventure of the night before, and a rising sense of joy in his\nsoldier's heart because he had orders in his pocket to be up and doing.\nSo, and only so, could he forget it all.\n\nHe whipped up his horse and went down the general's drive at a pace\nthat made the British sentry at the gate grin from ear to ear with\nwhole-souled approval. He did not see a fat babu approach the general's\nbungalow from the direction of the bazaar. The babu salaamed\nprofoundly, but Kirby's eyes were fixed on the road ahead, and his\nthoughts were already deep in the future. He saw nothing except the\nroad, until he took the last corner into barracks on one wheel, and\ndrew up a minute later in front of the bachelor quarters that had\nsheltered him for the past four years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pack! Campaign kit! One trunk!\" he ordered his servant. \"Orderly!\"\n\nAn orderly ran in from outside.\n\n\"Tell Major Brammle and Captain Warrington to come to me!\"\n\nIt took ten minutes to find Warrington, since every job was his, and\nnearly every responsibility, until his colonel should take charge of a\nparaded, perfect regiment, and lead it away to its fate. He came at\nlast, however, and on the run, and Brammle with him.\n\n\"Orders changed!\" said Kirby. \"March at noon! Man'll be here this\nmorning to take charge of officers' effects. Better have things ready\nfor him and full instructions. One trunk allowed each officer. Two\nchargers.\"\n\n\"Destination, sir?\" asked Brammle.\n\n\"Not disclosed!\"\n\n\"Where do we entrain?\" asked Warrington.\n\n\"We march out of Delhi. Entrain later, at a place appointed on the\nroad.\"\n\nWarrington began to hum to himself and to be utterly, consciously happy.\n\n\"Then I'll get a move on!\" he said, starting to hurry out.\n\"Everything's ready, but--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" commanded Kirby; and Warrington remained in the room\nafter Brammle had left it.\n\n\"You haven't said anything to anybody, of course, about that incident\nlast night?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Then _she_ has!\"\n\nWarrington whistled.\n\n\"Are you sure she has?\"\n\n\"Quite. I've just had proof of it!\"\n\n\"Makes a fellow reverence the sex!\" swore Warrington.\n\n\"It'll be forgotten by the time we're back in India,\" said Kirby\nsolemnly. \"Remember to keep absolutely silent about it. The best way to\nhelp others forget it is to forget it yourself. Not one word now to\nanybody, even under provocation!\"\n\n\"Not a word, sir!\"\n\n\"All right. Go and attend to business!\"\n\nWhat \"attending to business\" meant nobody can guess who has not been in\nat the breaking up of quarters at short notice. Everything was ready,\nas Warrington had boasted, but even an automobile may \"stall\" for a\ntime in the hands of the best chauffeur, and a regiment contains as\nmany separate human equations as it has men in its ranks.\n\nThe amount of personal possessions that had to be jettisoned, or left\nto the tender mercies of a perfunctory agent, would have wrung groans\nfrom any one but soldiers. The last minute details that seemed to be\nnobody's job, and that, therefore, all fell to Warrington because\nsomebody had to see to them, were beyond the imagination of any but an\nadjutant, and not even Warrington's imagination proved quite equal to\nthe task.\n\n\"We're ready, sir!\" he reported at last to Kirby. \"We're paraded and\nwaiting. Brammle's inspected 'em, and I've done ditto. There are only\nthirteen thousand details left undone that I can't think of, and not\none of 'em's important enough to keep us waitin'!\"\n\nSo Kirby rode out on parade and took the regiment's salute. There was\nnobody to see them off. There were not even women to wail by the\nbarrack gate, for they marched away at dinner-time and official lies\nhad been distributed where they would do most good.\n\nEnglishman and Sikh alike rode untormented by the wails or waving\nfarewells of their kindred; and there was only a civilian on a white\npony, somewhere along ahead, who seemed to know that they were more\nthan just parading. He led them toward the Ajmere Gate, and by the time\nthat the regiment's luggage came along in wagons, with the little\nrear-guard last of all, it was too late to run and warn people.\nOutram's Own had gone at high noon, and nobody the wiser!\n\nThere was no music as they marched and no talking. Only the jingling\nbits and rattling hoofs proclaimed that India's best were riding on a\nsudden summons to fight for the \"Salt.\" They marched in the direction\nleast expected of them, three-quarters of a day before their scheduled\ntime, and even \"Guppy,\" the mess bull-terrier, who ran under the wagon\nwith the officers' luggage, behaved as if all ends of the world were\none to him. He waved his tail with dignity and trotted in content.\n\nHard by the Ajmere Gate they halted, for some bullock carts had claimed\ntheir centuries-long prerogative of getting in the way. While the\nbullocks, to much tail-twisting and objurgation, labored in the mud in\nevery direction but the right one, Colonel Kirby sat his charger almost\nunderneath the gate, waiting patiently. Then the advance-guard\nclattered off and he led along.\n\nHe never knew where it came from and he never tried to guess. He caught\nit instinctively, and kept it for the sake of chivalry, or perhaps\nbecause she had made him think for a moment of his mother. At all\nevents, the bunch of jasmine flowers that fell into his lap found a\nwarm berth under his buttoned tunic, and he rode on through the great\ngate with a kinder thought for Yasmini than probably she would guess.\n\nWith that resentment gone, he could ride now as suited him, with all\nhis thoughts ahead, and there lacked then only one thing to complete\nhis pleasure--he missed Ranjoor Singh.\n\nIt was not that the squadron would lack good leading. An English\nofficer had taken Ranjoor Singh's place. It was the man he missed--the\ndecent loyal gentleman who had worked untiringly to sweat a squadron\ninto shape to Kirby's liking and never once presumed, nor had taken\noffense at criticism--the man who had been good enough to understand\nthe ethics of an alien colonel, and to translate them for the benefit\nof his command. It is not easy for a Sikh to rise to the rank of major\nand lead a squadron for the Raj.\n\nHe counted Ranjoor Singh his friend, and he knew that Ranjoor Singh\nwould have given all the rest of his life to ride away now for only one\nencounter on a foreign battle-field. Nothing, nothing less than the\nword of Ranjoor Singh himself, would ever convince him of the man's\ndisloyalty. And he would have felt better if he could have shaken hands\nwith Ranjoor Singh before going, since it seemed to be the order of the\nday that the Sikh should stay behind.\n\nIt did not seem quite the thing to be riding away to war with the best\nnative officer in all India somewhere in Delhi on \"special\nservice\"--whatever that might be.\n\nHe was given, as a rule, to smiling at any man who did his best. On any\nother day he would have very likely exchanged a joke with the\nbullock-man who labored so unavailingly to get the road cleared in a\nhurry. But to-day, since his thoughts were of Ranjoor Singh, he paid\nthe man no attention; he had not even formed a mental picture of him by\nthe time he passed the gate.\n\nIt was Warrington, cantering up from behind a minute or so later, who\nchanged the color of the earth and sky.\n\n\"Did you recognize him, sir?\"\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"No! Where?\"\n\n\"Not the bullock-man who blocked the road, but the man who ran out from\nbehind the gate and straightened things out again. That man was Ranjoor\nSingh in mufti!\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I recognized him. So did his squadron--look at them! They're riding\nlike new men!\"\n\nKirby looked, and there was no doubt about D Squadron.\n\n\"Is he there still?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can see a man standing there--see him? Fellow in white between two\nbullock carts?\"\n\nKirby pulled out to the roadside and let the regiment pass him. Then he\ncantered back. The man between the bullock carts had his back turned,\nand was gazing toward Delhi under his hand.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh!\" said Kirby, reining suddenly. \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Uh?\" The man faced about. He was no more Ranjoor Singh than he was\nColonel Kirby.\n\n\"Where is the man who came from behind the gate to clear the road?\"\n\nThe man pointed toward the gate. Inside, within the gloom of the gate\nitself, Kirby was certain he saw a Sikh who stood at the salute. He\ncantered to the gate, for he would have given a year's pay for word\nwith Ranjoor Singh. But when he reached the gate the man was gone.\n\n\"And he promised he'd be there to lead his squadron when the blood\nruns,\" wondered Kirby.\n\n\n  \"Now a trap,\" said the tiger, \"is easy to spot,\"\n    (Oh, jungli, be seated and listen!)\n  \"Some tempt you with live bait, and others do not;\"\n    (Oh, jungli, be leery and listen!)\n  \"The easiest sort to detect have a door--\n  A box, with three walls and a roof and a floor--\n  That the veriest, hungriest cub should ignore.\"\n    (Oh, jungli, stop laughing and listen!)\n  \"This isn't a trap, as I'll show you, my friend.\"\n  But the tiger fell into it. That is the end.\n    (Oh, jungli, be loving and listen!)\n\nYASMINI'S SONG.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nRanjoor Singh; on the trail of a murderer, shoved with his whole\nstrength against a little door of the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers.\nIt yielded suddenly. He shot in headlong, and the door slammed behind\nhim. As he fell forward into pitch blackness he was conscious of\nshooting bolts behind and of the squeaking of a beam swung into place.\n\nBut, having served the Raj for more years than he wanted to remember,\nthrough three campaigns in the Himalayas, once against the Masudis, and\nonce in China, he was in full possession of trained soldier senses.\nDarkness, he calculated instantly, was a shield to him who can use it,\nand a danger only to the unwary; and there are grades of wariness, just\nas there are grades of sloth.\n\nTwo men who thought themselves so wide awake as to be beyond the reach\nof government, each threw a noosed rope, and caught each other. Ranjoor\nSingh could not see the ropes, but he could hear the stifled swearing\nand the ensuing struggle; and an ear is as good as an eye in the dark.\n\nSomething--he never knew what--warned him to duck and step forward. He\nfelt the whistle of a club that missed him by so little as to make the\nskin twitch on the back of his neck.\n\nHis right leg shot sidewise, and he tripped a man. In another second he\nhad the club, and there was no measurable interval of time then before\nthe darkness was a living miracle of blows that came from everywhere\nand missed nothing.\n\nThree men went down, and Ranjoor Singh was in command of a situation\nwhose wherefore and possibilities he could not guess until an electric\ntorch declared itself some twenty feet away, at more than twice his\nheight, and he stood vignetted in a circle of white light.\n\n\"The sahib proves a gentle guest!\" purred a voice he thought he\nrecognized. It was a woman's. \"Has the sahib a pistol with him?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh, cursing his own neglect of soldierly precaution, saw fit\nnot to answer. A human arm reached like a snake into the ring of light.\nHe struck at it with the club, and a groan announced that he had struck\nhard enough.\n\n\"Does the sahib think that the noise of a pistol would cause his\nfriends to come? Is Ranjoor Singh ashamed? Speak, sahib! Is it well to\nbreak into a house and be surly with the hostess?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh stepped backward, and the ring of light followed him,\nuntil he stood pressed against the teak door and could feel the heavy\nbeam that ran up and down it, locked firmly above and below. He prodded\nover his head behind him with the club, trying to find what held the\nbeam, and the ring of light lifted a foot or two, then five feet, until\nits center was on the center of the club's handle.\n\nA pistol cracked and flashed then, from behind the light, and the club\nsplintered. He dropped it, and the torch-light ceased, leaving him\ndazed, but not so dazed that he did not hear a man sneak up and carry\nthe splintered club away. He followed after the man, for he knew now\nthat he was in a narrow passage and no man could get by him to attack\nfrom behind.\n\nBut again the torch-light sought him out. Half-way to the foot of steep\nstairs that he could dimly outline he halted, for advance against\nhidden pistol-fire and dazzling light was futile.\n\n\"Look!\" said the same soft, woman's voice. \"Look, sahib! See, Ranjoor\nSingh! the hooded death! See the hooded death behind you!\"\n\nIt was not her command that made him look. He knew better than to turn\nhis head at an unseen woman's bidding in the dark. But he heard them\nhiss, and he turned to see four cobras come toward him, with the front\nthird of their bodies raised from the floor and their hoods extended.\nHe saw that a panel in the wooden wall had slid, and the last snake's\ntail was yet inside the gap. There was no need of a man to slip between\nhim and the door!\n\n\"There are more in the wall, Ranjoor Singh! Will they follow thee\nup-stairs? See, they come! Step swiftly, for the hooded death is swift!\"\n\nThe light went out again, and his ears were all he had to warn him of\nthe snakes' approach--ears and imagination. Swift as a well launched\ncharge of light cavalry, he leaped for the stairs and took them four at\na time. He reached the top one sooner than he knew it. The torch\nflashed in his eyes, and he saw a pistol-mouth just beyond arm-reach.\n\n\"Stand, Ranjoor Singh!\" said a voice that he felt sure he recognized.\nHis eyes began to search beyond the light for glimpses of dim outline.\n\n\"Back, Ranjoor Singh! Back to the right--toward that door! In, through\nthat door--so!\"\n\nHe obeyed, since he knew now with whom he had to deal. There was no\nsense at all in taking liberties with Yasmini. He stepped into a bare,\ndark, teak-walled room, and she followed him, and she had scarcely\nclosed the door at her back before another door opened at the farther\nend, and two of her maids appeared, carrying candle-lamps.\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" demanded Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay! Did I invite the sahib?\"\n\n\"I came about a murderer who entered by that door through which I came.\"\n\n\"To pay him the reward, perhaps?\" she asked impudently.\n\n\"Is this thy house?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"This is the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers, sahib.\"\n\n\"This is a hole where murderers hide! A man of mine was slain in the\nstreet below, and the murderer came in here. Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He and the bigger fool who followed him,\" said Yasmini, poising\nherself like a nodding blossom and smiling like the promise of new\nlove, as she paused to be insolent and let the insolence sink home,\n\"are at my mercy!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh did not answer, but she could draw no amusement from his\nsilence, for his eye was unafraid.\n\n\"I am from the North, where the quality of mercy is thought weakness,\"\nshe smiled sweetly.\n\n\"Who asks mercy? I was seen and heard to enter. There will be a hundred\nseeking me within an hour!\"\n\n\"Sahib, within two hours there will be five thousand around this house,\nyet none will seek to enter! And they will find no murderer, though\nthou shalt see thy murderer. Come this way, sahib.\"\n\nA whiff of warm wind might have blown her, so swiftly, lissomely she\nran toward the other door, laughing back at him across her shoulder and\nleaving a trail of aromatic scent. The two maids held their\ncandle-lanterns high, and, striding like a soldier, Ranjoor Singh\nfollowed Yasmini, not caring that the maids shut the heavy door behind\nhim and bolted it. He argued to himself that he was as safe in one room\nas in another, and she as dangerous; also, that it made no difference\nin which room he might be when the squadron or his colonel missed him.\n\n\"Look, Ranjoor Singh! Look through that hole!\"\n\nThere was plenty of light in this room, for there was a lantern in\nevery corner. He could see that she was gazing through a hole in the\nwall at something that amused her, and she motioned to another hole\neight feet away from it. He crossed a floor that was solid and age-old;\nno two planks of it were of even width or length, but none creaked.\n\nAt her invitation he looked through the little square hole she pointed\nout. And then, for the first time, he confessed surprise.\n\n\"Thou, Jagut Singh!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHe stepped back, blinked to reassure himself, and stepped to the hole\nagain. Back to back, tied right hand to right, left hand to left, so\nthat their arms were crossed behind them, and lashed waist to waist, a\ntrooper of D Squadron and the Afridi whom lie had kicked at Yasmini's\nsat on the floor facing opposite walls. Dumb misery was stamped on the\nSikh's face, the despair of evaporated savagery on the Afridi's.\n\n\"Jagut Singh!\" said the risaldar-major, louder this time; and the\ntrooper looked up, almost as if hope had been that instant born in him.\n\n\"Jagut Singh!\"\n\nThe trooper grinned. A white row of ivory showed between his black\nbeard and mustache. He tried to look sidewise, but the rope that held\nhim tight to the Afridi hurt his neck.\n\n\"I knew it, sahib!\" he shouted. \"I knew that one would come for me!\nThis hill wildcat has fought until the ropes cut both of us; but take\ntime, sahib! I can wait. Attend to the duty first. Only let him who\ncomes bring water with him, for this is a thirsty place!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh looked sidewise. He could see that Yasmini was absorbed\nin contemplation of her prisoners. Her little lithe form was pressed\ntightly against the wall, less than two yards away. He could guess, and\nhe had heard a dozen times, that dancing had made her stronger than a\npanther and more swift. Yet he thought that if he had her in his arms\nhe could crush those light ribs until she would yield and order her\nprisoner released. The trooper's confidence deserved immediate, not\npostponed, reward.\n\nHe watched for a minute. He could see that her bosom rose and fell\nregularly against the woodwork; she was all unconscious of her danger,\nhe was sure of it. He changed his position, and she neither looked nor\nmoved. He changed it again, so that his weight was all on his left\nfoot; he was sure she had not noticed. Then he sprang.\n\nHe sprang sidewise, as a horse does that sees a snake by the roadside,\nevery nerve and sinew keyed to the tightest pitch--eye, ear and\ninstinct working together. And she, in the same second, turned to meet\nhim smiling, with outstretched arms, as if she would meet him half-way\nand hug him to her bosom, only she stepped a pace backward, instead of\nforward as she had seemed to intend.\n\nHe landed where he had meant to, on the spot where she had stood. His\nleft hand clutched at the wall, and a second too late he made a wild\ngrab at the hole she had peered through, trying to get his fingers into\nit. What she had done he never knew, but the floor she had stood on\nyielded, and he heard her laugh as he slipped through the opening like\na tiger into a pit-trap, and fell downward into blackness.\n\nWith a last tremendous effort he caught at the floor and held himself\nsuspended by his finger-ends. But she came and trod on them, and though\nher weight was light, malice made her skilful, and she hurt him until\nhe had to set his teeth and drop. He would never have believed that\nthose soft slipper-soles could have given so much pain.\n\n\"Forget not thy trooper in his need!\" she called, as he fell away\nthrough the opening. And then the trap shut.\n\nTo his surprise he did not fall very far, and though he landed on an\nelbow and a hip, he struck so softly that for a moment he believed he\nmust be mad, or dead, or dreaming. Then his fingers, numb from\nYasmini's pressure, began to recognize the feel of gunny-bags, and of\ncotton-wool, and of paper. Also, he smelled kerosene or something very\nlike it.\n\n\"Forget not the water for thy trooper, Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\nHe looked up to see Yasmini's face framed in the opening, and he\nthought there was more devilment expressed in it, for all her\nloveliness, than in her voice that never quite lost its hint of\nlaughter. He did not answer, and the trap-door closed again.\n\nHe knelt and began to grope through the dark on hands and knees, but\ngave that up presently because the dust from old sacks and piles of\nrubbish began to choke him. Then rats came to investigate him. He heard\nseveral of them scamper close, and one bit his leg; so he made ready to\nfight for his life against the worst enemy a man may have, praying a\nlittle in the Sikh way, that does not reckon God to be far off at any\ntime.\n\nSuddenly the trap-door opened, and the rats scampered away from the\nlight and noise.\n\n\"Thus is a soldier answered!\" muttered Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Is the risaldar-major sahib thirsty?\" wondered Yasmini.\n\nHe could hear her pouring water out of a brass ewer into a dish, and\npouring it back again. The metal rang and the water splashed\ndeliriously, but he was not very thirsty yet; he had been thirstier on\nparade a hundred times.\n\nWhen her head and shoulders darkened the aperture, he did not trouble\nthis time to look at her.\n\n\"Is it dark down there?\" she asked him; but he did not answer.\n\nSo she struck a match and lit a newspaper. In a moment a ball of fire\nwas floating downward to him, and it was then that the smell of dust\nand kerosene entered his consciousness as pincers enter the flesh of\nmen in torment. He stood up with hands upstretched to catch the\nfire--caught it--bore it downward--and smothered it in gunny-bags.\n\n\"Still dark?\" she said, looking through the aperture once more. \"I will\nsend another one!\"\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh found his tongue and cursed her with a force and\ncomprehensiveness that only Asia can command; he gave her to understand\nthat the next fire she dropped on him should be allowed to work God's\nwill and burn her--her, her rats, her cobras, and her cutthroats. Two\nhonest Sikhs, he swore, would die well to such an end.\n\n\"Drop thy fire and I will fan the flame!\" he vowed, and she believed\nhim.\n\n\"I will send my cobras down to keep the sahib company!\" she mocked.\n\nBut Ranjoor Singh proposed to take one danger at a time, and he was\nquite sure that she wanted him alive, not dead, for otherwise he would\nhave been dead already. He held his tongue and listened while she\nsplashed the water.\n\n\"Thy trooper is very thirsty, sahib!\"\n\nShe was on a warmer scent now, for that squadron of his and the men of\nhis squadron were the one love of his warrior life. Some spirit of\nmalice whispered her as much.\n\n\"The trooper shall have water when Ranjoor Singh sahib has promised on\nhis Sikh honor.\"\n\n\"Promised what?\" His voice betrayed interest at last; it suggested\nfuture possibilities instead of a grim present.\n\n\"That he will do what is required of him!\"\n\n\"Is that the price of a drink for Jagut Singh?\"\n\n\"Aye! Will the sahib pay, or will he let the trooper parch?\"\n\n\"Ask Jagut Singh! Go, ask him! Let it be as he answers!\"\n\nHe could hear her hurry away, although she slammed the trap-door shut.\nEvidently she was not satisfied to speak through the little hole, and\nhe suspected that she was showing the man water, perhaps giving some to\nthe Afridi for sweet suggestion's sake. She was back within five\nminutes, and by the way she opened the trap and grinned at him he knew\nwhat her answer would be.\n\n\"He begs that you promise! He begs, sahib! He says he is thy trooper,\nthy dog, thy menial, and very thirsty!\"\n\n\"Bring some one who knows better how to lie!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"I\n_know_ what his answer was! He said, 'Say to the risaldar-major sahib\nthat I have eaten salt, but I am not thirsty!' Go, tell him his answer\nwas a good one, and that I know he said it! I know that man, as men\nknow each other. Thou art a woman, and thy knowledge is but emptiness.\nThou hast heard now twice what the answer is, once from him and once\nfrom me!\"\n\n\"I will leave thee to the rats!\" she said, slamming the trap-door tight.\n\nThe rats came, and he began to grope about for a weapon to use against\nthem. He caught one rat in his fingers, squeezed the squealing brute to\ndeath and flung it away, and he heard a hundred of its messmates race\nto devour the carcass.\n\nHe began to see little active eyes around him in the blackness, that\nwatched his every movement, and he kept moving since that seemed to\npuzzle them. Also he wondered, as a drowning man might wonder about\nthings, how long it would be before Colonel Kirby would send for him to\nask about the murdered trooper. Something would happen then, he felt\nquite sure.\n\nThe rats by this time had grown very daring, and he had been bitten\nagain twice; he found time to wonder what lies Yasmini would tell to\naccount for her share in things. He did not doubt she would lie herself\nout of it, but he wondered just how, along what unexpected line. It\nbegan to seem to him that the colonel and his squadron were a very long\ntime coming.\n\n\"But they will come!\" he assured himself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was nearer to the mark when he expected unexpectedness from Yasmini,\nfor she did not disappoint him. A door opened at one end of the black\ndark cellar, and again the rats scampered for cover as Yasmini herself\nstood framed in it, with a lantern above her head. She was alone, and\nhe could not see that she had any weapon.\n\n\"This way, sahib!\" she called sweetly to him.\n\nNever--North, South, East or West, in olden days or modern--did a siren\ncall half so seductively. Every move she ever made was poetry\nexpressed, but framed in a golden aura shed by the lamp, and swaying in\nthe velvet blackness of the pit's mouth, she was, it seemed to Ranjoor\nSingh, as no man had ever yet seen woman.\n\n\"Come, sahib!\" she called again; and he moved toward her.\n\n\"Food and water wait! Thy trooper has drunk his fill. Come, sahib!\"\n\nShe made no move at all to protect herself from him. She did not lead\ninto the cavern beyond the door. She waited for him, leaning against\nthe door-post and smiling as if she and he were old friends who\nunderstood each other.\n\n\"I but tried thee, Ranjoor Singh!\" she smiled, looking up into his face\nand holding the lantern closer to his eyes, as if she would read behind\nthem. \"Thou art a soldier, and not a buffalo at all! I am sorry that I\ncalled thee buffalo. My heart goes out ever to a brave man, Ranjoor\nSingh!\"\n\nHe was actually at her side, her clothes touched his, and he could have\nflung his arms around her. But it was the move next after that which\nseemed obscure. He wondered what her reply would be; and, moving the\nlantern a little, she read the hesitation in his eyes--the wavering\nbetween desire for vengeance, a soldierly regard for sex, and mistrust\nof her apparent helplessness. And, being Yasmini, she dared him.\n\n\"Like swords I have seen!\" she laughed. \"Two cutting edges and a point!\nNot to be held save by the hilt, eh, Ranjoor Singh? Search me for\nweapons first, and then use that dagger in thy hair--I am unarmed!\"\n\n\"Lead on!\" he commanded in a voice that grated harshly, for it needed\nall his willpower to prevent his self-command from giving out. He knew\nthat behind temptation of any kind there lie the iron teeth of\nunexpected consequences.\n\nShe let the lantern swing below her knees and leaned back to laugh at\nhim, until the cavern behind her echoed as if all the underworld had\nseen and was amused.\n\n\"I called thee a buffalo!\" she panted. \"Nay, I was very wrong! I laugh\nat my mistake! Come, Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\nWith a swing of the lantern and a swerve of her lithe body, she slipped\nout of his reach and danced down an age-old hewn-stone passage, out of\nwhich doors seemed to lead at every six or seven yards; only the doors\nwere all made fast with iron bolts so huge that it would take two men\nto manage them.\n\nHe hurried after her. But the faster he followed the faster she ran,\nuntil it needed little imagination to conceive her a will-o'-the-wisp\nand himself a crazy man.\n\n\"Come!\" she kept calling to him. \"Come!\"\n\nAnd then she commenced to sing, as if dark passages beneath the Delhi\nstreets were a fit setting for her skill and loveliness. Ranjoor Singh\nhad never heard the song before. It was about a tiger who boasted and\nfell into a trap. It made him more cautious than he might have been,\nand when the darkness began to grow less opaque he slowed into a walk.\nThen he stood still, for he could not see her any longer.\n\nIt occurred to him to turn back. But that thought had not more than\ncrossed his mind when a noose was pulled tight around his legs and a\nbig sheet, thrown out of the darkness, was wrapped and wrapped about\nhim until he could neither shout nor move. He knew that they were women\nwho managed the sheet, because he bit one's finger through it and she\nscreamed. Then he heard Yasmini's voice close to his ear.\n\n\"Thy colonel sahib and another are outside!\" she whispered. \"It is not\nwell to wait here, Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\nNext he felt a great rush of air, and after that the roar of flame was\nso unmistakable--although he could feel no heat yet--that he wondered\nwhether he was to be burned alive.\n\n\"Is it well alight?\" asked Yasmini.\n\n\"Yes!\" said a maid whose teeth chattered.\n\n\"Good! Presently the fools will come and pour water enough to fill this\npassage. Thus none may follow us! Come!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh was gathered up and carried by frightened women--he could\nfeel them tremble. For a moment he felt the outer air, and he caught\nthe shout of a crowd that had seen flames. Then he was thrown face\ndownward on the floor of some sort of carriage and driven away.\n\nHe lost all sense of direction after a moment, though he did not forget\nto count, and by his rough reckoning he was driven through the streets\nfor about nine minutes at a fast trot. Then the carriage stopped, and\nhe was carried out again, up almost endless stairs, across a floor that\nseemed yet more endless, and thrown into a corner.\n\nHe heard a door slam shut, and almost at the same moment his fingers,\nthat had never once ceased working, tore a corner of the sheet loose.\n\nIn another minute he was free.\n\nHe threw the sheet from him and looked about, accustoming his eyes to\ndarkness. Presently, not far from him, he made out the sheeted figure\nof another man, who lay exactly as he had done and worked with tired\nfingers. He drew the dagger out of his hair and cut the man loose.\n\n\"Jagut Singh!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe trooper stood up and saluted.\n\n\"Who brought thee here?\"\n\n\"Women, sahib, in a carriage!\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Even now!\"\n\n\"Where is that Afridi?\"\n\n\"Dead, sahib!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"She brought us water in a brass vessel, saying it was by thy orders,\nsahib. She cut us loose and gave him water first. Then, while she gave\nme to drink the Afridi attacked her, and I slew him with my hands,\ntearing his throat out--thus! While the life yet fluttered in him they\nthrew a sheet over me--and here I am! Salaam, sahib!\"\n\nThe trooper saluted again.\n\n\"Who made thee prisoner in the first place?\"\n\n\"Hillmen, sahib, at the orders of the Afridi who is now dead. They made\nready to torture me, showing me the knives they would use. But she\ncame, and they obeyed her, binding the Afridi fast to me. After that I\nheard the sahib's voice, and then this happened. That is all, sahib.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Ranjoor Singh. And for the third time his trooper saw fit\nto salute him.\n\n\n  Who shall be trusted to carry my trust?\n    (Hither, and answer me, stranger!)\n  Slow to give ground be he--swifter to thrust--\n    Instant,--yet wary o' danger!\n  Hand without craftiness, eye without lust,\n  Lip without flattery! Such an one must\n  Prove yet his worthiness--yet earn my trust!\n    (Closer, and answer me, stranger!)\n  First let me lead him alone, and apart;\n  There let me feel of his pulse and his heart!\n    (Hither, and play with me, stranger!)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nMen say Yasmini does not sleep. Of course, that is absurd. None the\nless, it is certain she must do much of her plotting in the daytime,\nfor by night, until after midnight, she is always the Yasmini whom the\nNorthern gentry know, at home to all comers in her wonderful apartment.\n\nIt is ever a mystery to them how she knows all that is going on in\nDelhi, and in India, and in the greater outer world, although they\nthemselves bring her information that no government could ever suck out\nof the silent hills. They know where she keeps her cobras--where the\nstrong-box is, in which her jewels lie crowded--who run her\nerrands--and some of her past history, for not even a mongoose is more\ninquisitive than a man born in the hills, and Yasmini has many maids.\nBut none--not even her favorite, most confidential maids--know what is\nin the little room that she reaches down a private flight of stairs\nthat have a steel door at the top.\n\nShe keeps the key to that steel door, and it has, besides, a\ncombination lock that only she understands.\n\nOnce a very clever hillman, who had been south for an education and had\nlearned skepticism in addition to the rule of three, undertook to\ndiscover wires leading over roof-tops to that room; but he searched for\na week and did not find them. When his search was over, and all had\ndone laughing at him, he was found one night with a knife-wound between\nhis shoulder-blades, and, later still, Yasmini sang a song about him.\nNone searched for wires after that, and the consensus of opinion still\nis that she makes magic in the room below-stairs.\n\nShe sought that room the minute Ranjoor Singh was safely locked in with\nhis trooper, although her maids reported more than one Northern\ngentleman waiting impatiently in the larger of her two reception-rooms\nfor official information of the war. Government bulletins are regarded\nas pure fiction always, unless confirmed by Yasmini.\n\nAnd, within five minutes of Ranjoor Singh's release of his trooper from\nthe sheet, no less a personage than a general officer had thrown aside\nother business and had drawn on a cloak of secrecy that not even his\nown secretary could penetrate.\n\n\"Closed carriage!\" he ordered; and, as though the fire brigade were\ndoing double duty, a carriage came, and the horses, rump-down, halted\nfrom the gallop outside his door.\n\n\"Pathan turban!\" he ordered; and his servant brought him one.\n\n\"Sheepskin cloak!\"\n\nIn a moment the upper half of him would have passed in the dark for\nthat of a rather portly Northern trader. He decided that a rug would do\nthe rest, and snatched one as he ran for the carriage with the turban\nunder his arm. He gave no order to the driver other than \"Cheloh!\" and\nthat means \"Go ahead\"; so the driver, who was a Sikh, went ahead as the\nguns go into action, asway and aswing, regardless of everything but\nspeed.\n\n\"Yasmini's!\" said the general, at the end of a hundred yards; and the\nSikh took a square, right-angle turn at full gallop with a neatness the\nHorse Artillery could not have bettered. There seemed to be no need of\nfurther instructions, for the Sikh pulled up unbidden at the private\ndoor that is to all appearance only a mark on the dirty-looking wall.\n\nWith a rug around his middle, there shot out then what a watching small\nboy described afterward as \"a fat hill-rajah on his way to be fleeced.\"\nThe carriage drove on, for coachmen who wait outside Yasmini's door are\nlikely to be butts for questions. The door opened without any audible\nsignal, and the man with the rug around his middle disappeared.\n\nHe had ceased to bear any resemblance to any one but a stout English\ngeneral in mess-dress by the time he reached the dark stairhead; and\nYasmini took the precaution of being there alone to meet him. She held,\na candle-lantern.\n\n\"Whom have you?\" he demanded.\n\nThey seemed to understand each other--these two. He paid her no\ncompliments, and she expected none; she made no attempt at all to\nflatter him or deceive him. But, being Yasmini, it did not lie in her\nto answer straightly.\n\n\"I set a trap and a buffalo blundered into it! He will do better than\nany other!\"\n\n\"Whom have you?\"\n\n\"Risaldar-Major Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\nThe general whistled softly.\n\n\"Of the Sikh Light Cavalry?\" he asked.\n\n\"One of Kirby sahib's officers, and a trooper into the bargain!\"\n\nThe general whistled again.\n\n\"There were two troopers whom I meant to catch,\" she said hurriedly,\nfor it was evident that the general did not at all approve of the turn\naffairs had taken. \"I had a trap for them at the\nHouse-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers, and some hillmen in there ready to\nrush out and seize them as they passed. But a fool Afridi murdered one,\nand I only got there in the nick of time to save the other's life. I\nmeant that Ranjoor Singh, who is a buffalo, should be troubled about\nhis troopers and suspected on his own account, for he and I have a\nprivate quarrel. I did not mean to catch him, or make use of him. But\nhe walked into the trap. What shall be done with him? Let the sahib say\nthe word and----\"\n\nHer gesture was inimitable. Not so the gurgle that she gave, for a\nman's breath bubbling through the blood of a slit throat makes the same\nshuddersome sound exactly. The general took no notice whatever of that,\nfor wise men of the West understand the East's attempts to scandalize\nthem. It is the everlasting amusement of Yasmini, and a thousand\nothers, to pretend that the English are even more blood careless than\nthemselves, just as it is their practise to build confidently on the\nopposite fact.\n\n\"Did _you_ fire the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers?\" asked the\ngeneral suddenly. \"Am I a sweeper?\" she retorted.\n\n\"Did you order it done?\"\n\n\"Did Jumna rise when the rain came? There were six good cobras of mine\nburned alive, to say nothing of the bones of a dead Afridi! Nay, sahib,\nI ordered a clear trail left from there to here, connecting me and thee\nand Ranjoor Singh to the Germans and a dog of an Afridi murderer. I\nleft a trail that even the police could follow!\"\n\n\"Whose property is that house?\"\n\n\"Whose? Ask the lawyers! They have fought about it in the courts until\nlawyers own every stick and stone of it, and now the lawyers fight one\nanother! The government will spend a year now,\" she laughed, \"seeking\nwhom to fine for the fire. It will be good to see the lawyers run to\ncover!\"\n\n\"This is a bad business!\" said the general sternly; and he used two\nwords in the native tongue that are thirty times more expressive of\nbadness as applied to machinations than are the English for them. \"The\nplan was to kidnap a trooper, or two troopers--to tempt him, or\nthem--and, should they prove incorruptible, to give them certain work\nto do. And what have you done?\"\n\nYasmini laughed at him--merry, mocking laughter that stung him because\nit was so surely genuine. She did not need to tell him in words that\nshe was not afraid of him; she could laugh in his face and make the\ntruth sink deeper.\n\n\"And now what will the _burra_ sahib do?\" she mocked. \"There is war--a\ngreat war--a war of all the world--but Yasmini fired a rat-run and\navenged a murdered Sikh. First let us punish Yasmini! Shall I send for\npolice to arrest me, _burra_ sahib? Or shall I send a maid in search of\nbabu Sita Ram that the game may continue?\"\n\n\"What do you want Sita Ram for?\"\n\n\"Sita Ram is nearly always useful, sahib. He is on a message now. He is\na fool who likes to meddle where he _thinks_ none notice him. Such are\nthe sort who cost least and work the longest hours. Who, for instance,\nsahib, is to balk Kirby sahib when he grows suspicious and begins to\nsearch in earnest for his Ranjoor Singh? He knew that Ranjoor Singh was\nat the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers; there was a man on watch\noutside. He will come here next, for Ranjoor Singh has been reported to\nhim as having talked with Germans in my house.\"\n\n\"Reported by whom?\"\n\n\"By the Afridi who is now dead.\"\n\n\"Who killed the Afridi?\"\n\n\"Does the _burra_ sahib think I killed him?\"\n\n\"I asked a question!\" snapped the general.\n\n\"In the first place, then, Ranjoor Singh, the buffalo, struck the\nAfridi with his foot. The Afridi, who was a dog with yellow teeth, went\noutside to sing sweet compliments to Ranjoor Singh. Certain Sikhs heard\nhim--of whom one was the trooper who waits in another room with Ranjoor\nSingh--and they beat him nearly to death because, being buffaloes\nthemselves, they love Ranjoor Singh, who is the greatest buffalo of all.\n\n\"For revenge, the Afridi told tales of Ranjoor Singh, and later knifed\none Sikh trooper who had beaten him. The other trooper followed him\ninto the House-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers, where he soon had\nopportunity for vengeance. Now the _burra_ sahib knows all. Is it not a\nsweet love-story! Now the _burra_ sahib may arrest everybody, and all\nwill be well!\"\n\n\"Where did Ranjoor Singh kick the Afridi?\"\n\n\"Here--in my house!\"\n\n\"Then he was here?\"\n\n\"How else would he kick the man here? Could he send his foot by\nmessenger?\"\n\n\"Was the German here? Did he have word with the German?\"\n\n\"Surely. He spoke with him alone. So the Afridi reported him to the\n'Rat sahib.'\"\n\nThe general frowned. However deeply the military may intrigue, they\nneither like nor profess to like civilians who play the same game.\n\n\"If Ranjoor Singh is under suspicion, what is the use of--\"\n\n\"Oh, all men are alike!\" jeered Yasmini, holding up the light and\nlooking more impudent than the general had ever seen her--and he had\nseen her often, for most of his private information about the regions\nnorth of the Himalayas had come through her in one way or another, and\noften enough from her lips direct. \"I have said that Ranjoor Singh is a\nbuffalo! He was born a buffalo--he has been trained to be one by the\nBritish--he likes to be one--and he will die one, with a German bullet\nin his belly, unless this business prove too much for him and he dies\nof fretting before he can get away to fight!\n\n\"I--look at me, sahib! I have tempted Ranjoor Singh, and he did not\nyield a hair! I stood closer to him than I am to you, and his pulse\nbeat no faster! All he thought of was whether he could crush me and\nmake me give up my prisoner.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh is a buffalo of buffaloes--a Jat buffalo of no\nimagination and no sense. He is buffalo enough to love the British Raj\nand his squadron of Jat farmers with all his stupid Sikh heart! There\n_could_ not be a better for the purpose than this Ranjoor Singh! He is\nstupid enough, and nearly blunt enough, to be an Englishman. He is just\nof the very caliber to fool a German! Trust me, sahib--I, who picked\nthe man who--\"\n\n\"That'll do!\" said the general; and Yasmini laughed again like the\ntinkling of a silver bell.\n\nThere came then a soft rap on the door. It opened about six inches, and\na maid whispered.\n\n\"Wait!\" ordered Yasmini. \"Come through! Wait here!\" She pulled the maid\nthrough the door to the little back stair-head landing. \"Did you hear?\"\nshe hissed excitedly. \"She says Kirby sahib has come, and another with\nhim!\"\n\nShe was twitching with excitement. Her fingers clutched the general's\nsleeve, and he found himself thinking of his youth. He released her\nfingers gently and she spared a giggle for him.\n\n\"Bad business!\" said the general again. \"Kirby will ask questions and\ngo away; but the troopers of Ranjoor Singh's squadron will come later,\nand they will not go away in such a hurry. You can fool Colonel Kirby\nsahib, but you can not fool a hundred troopers!\"\n\n\"No?\" she purred. She had done thinking and was herself again, impudent\nand artful. \"I can fool anybody, and any thousand men! I have sent Sita\nRam already with a message to the troopers of Ranjoor Singh's squadron.\nThe message was supposed to be from him, and it was worded just as he\nwould have worded it. Presently Sita Ram will come back, when he has\nhelped himself to payment. Then I can send him with yet another message.\n\n\"Go and put thoughts into the buffalo's head, General sahib, and be\nquick! There must be a message--a written message from Ranjoor Singh to\nKirby sahib--and a token--forget not the token, in proof that the\nwriting is not forged! Forget not the token. There must surely be a\ntoken!\"\n\nShe pushed the general forward down a passage, through a series of\ndoors, and down another passage--halted him while she fitted a strange\nnative key into a lock--opened another door, and pushed him through.\nThen she ran back to her maid.\n\n\"Send somebody to find Sita Ram! Bid him hurry! When he comes, put him\nin the small room next the cobras, and let him be shown the cobras\nuntil fear of too much talking has grown greater in him than the love\nof being heard! Then let me see him in a mirror, so that I may know\nwhen it is time. Have cobras in a hair-noose ready, close behind where\nthe sahibs sit, and watch through the hangings for my signal! Both\nsahibs will kneel to me. Then watch for another signal, and let all\nlights be blown out instantly! Or, if the sahibs do not kneel (though\nthey _shall!_), then watch yet more closely for a signal which I will\ngive to extinguish lights.\n\n\"So--now, go! Am I beautiful? Are my eyes bright? Twist me that jasmine\nin my hair--so. Now run--I will surprise them through the hangings!\"\n\nSo Yasmini surprised Kirby and his adjutant, as has been told, and it\nneed not be repeated how she humbled the pride of India's army on their\nknees. She would have to forego the delight of being Yasmini before she\ncould handle any situation or plan any coup along ordinary lines, and\nKirby and his adjutant were not the first Englishmen, nor likely to be\nthe last, to feed her merriment.\n\nThe general, for his part, had--even although pushed without ceremony\nthrough a door--behaved with perfect confidence, for he knew that,\nwhatever her whim or her sense of humor, or her impudence, Yasmini\nwould not fail him in the pinch. Even she, whose jest it is to see men\nwrithe under her hand, has to own somebody her master, and though she\nwould giggle at the notion of fearing any one man, or any dozen, she\ndoes fear the representative of what she and perhaps a hundred others\ncall \"The Game.\" For the night, and for the place, the general was that\nrepresentative, and however much he might disapprove, he had no doubt\nof her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRanjoor Singh stood aghast at sight of him, and the trooper saluted\nlike an automaton, since nothing save obedience was any affair of his.\n\n\"Evening, Risaldar-Major!\" smiled the general.\n\n\"Salaam, General sahib!\"\n\n\"To save time, I will tell you that I know stage by stage how you got\nhere.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh looked suspicious. For five-and-twenty years he had\nwatched British justice work, and British justice gives both sides a\nhearing; he had not told his own version yet.\n\n\"I know that you have had word in another part of this house with a\nGerman, who pretends to be a merchant but who is really a spy.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh looked even more suspicious. The charge was true, though,\nso he did not answer.\n\n\"Your being brought to this house was part of a plan--part of the same\nplan that leaves the German still at liberty. You are wanted to take\nfurther part in it.\"\n\n\"General sahib, am I an officer of the Raj or am I dreaming?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh had found his tongue at last, and the general noted with\nkeen pleasure that eye, voice and manner were angry and unafraid.\n\n\"I command a squadron, sahib, unless I have been stricken mad! Since\nwhen is a squadron commander brought face-downward in a carriage out of\nrat-traps by a woman to do a general's bidding? That has been my fate\nto-night. Now I am wanted to take further part! Is my honor not yet\ndirtied enough, General sahib? I will take no further part. I refuse to\nobey! I order this trooper not to obey. I demand court martial!\"\n\n\"I see I'd better begin with an apology,\" smiled the general! He was\nnot trying to pretend he felt comfortable.\n\n\"Nay, sahib! I would accept no apology. It must first be proved to me\nthat he, who tells me I am wanted to take further part in this rat-hole\ntreachery, is not a traitor to the Raj! I have read of generals turning\ntraitors! I have read about Napoleon; I know how his generals behaved\nwhen the sand in his glass seemed run. I am for the Raj in this and in\nany other hour! I refuse to obey or to accept apology! Let the\nexplanation be made me at court martial, with Colonel Kirby sahib\npresent to bear witness to my character!\"\n\n\"As you were!\"\n\nThe general's eyes met those of the Sikh officer, and neither could\nhave told then, or at any other time, what exactly it was that each man\nrecognized.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh, when I entered this house ten minutes ago I had no\nnotion I should find you here. I have served the same 'Salt' with you,\non the same campaigns. I even wear the same medals. In the same house I\nam entitled to the same credit.\n\n\"I am here on urgent business for the Raj, and you are here owing to a\ngrave mistake, which I admit and for which I tender you the most\nsincere apology on behalf of the government, but which I can not alter.\nI expected to find a trooper here, not necessarily of your regiment,\nwho should have been waylaid and tempted beyond any doubt as to his\ntrustworthiness.\n\n\"I received a message that Yasmini had two absolutely honest men ready,\nand I came at once to give them their instructions. I ask you to\nsacrifice your pride, as we all of us must on occasion, and your\nrights, as is a soldier's privilege, and see this business through to a\nfinish. It is too late to make other arrangements, Ranjoor Singh.\"\n\n\"Sahib, squadron-leading is my trade! I am not cut out for rat-run\nsoldiering! I am willing to leave this house and hold my tongue, and to\ntake this trooper with me and see that he holds his tongue. By nine\ntomorrow morning I will have satisfied myself that you are for and not\nagainst the Raj. And having satisfied myself, I and this trooper here\nwill hold our tongues for ever. _Bass!_\"\n\nThe general stood as still on his square foot of floor as did Ranjoor\nSingh on his. It was the fact that he did not flinch and did not strut\nabout, but stood in one spot with his arms behind him that confirmed\nRanjoor Singh in his reading of the general's eye.\n\n\"You may leave the house, then, and take your trooper. I accept your\npromise. Before you go, though, I'll tell you something. The ordering\nof troops for the front--for France--is in my hands. Your regiment is\nslated for to-morrow. But it can't go unless you'll see this through.\nThe whole regiment will be needed, instead, to mount guard over Delhi.\"\n\n\"The regiment is to go, sahib, and my squadron, and--and I not? I am\nnot to go?\"\n\n\"That is the sacrifice you are asked to make!\"\n\n\"Have I made no sacrifices for the Raj? How has my life been spent?\nSahib----\"\n\nThe Sikh's voice broke and he ceased speaking, but the general, too,\nseemed at a loss for words.\n\n\"Sahib--do I understand? If I do this--this rat-business, whatever it\nis--Colonel Kirby and the regiment go, and another leads my squadron?\nAnd unless I do this, whatever it is, the regiment will not go?\"\n\nThe general nodded. He felt and looked ashamed.\n\n\"Has war been declared, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yes. Germany has invaded Belgium.\"\n\nFor a second the Sikh's eyes blazed, but the fire died down again. He\nclasped his hands in front of him and hung his head. \"I will do this\nthing that I am asked to do,\" he said; but his words were scarcely\naudible. His trooper came a step closer, to be nearer to him in his\nminute of acutest agony.\n\n\"Thou and I, Jagut Singh! We both stay behind!\"\n\n\"Now, Risaldar-Major, I want you to listen! You've promised like a\nman,\" said the general. \"I'll make you the best promise I can in\nreturn. Mine's conditional, but it's none the less emphatic. If\npossible, you shall catch your regiment before it puts to sea. If\nthat's impossible, you shall take passage on another ship and try to\novertake it. If that again is impossible, you shall follow your\nregiment and be in France in time to lead your squadron. I think I may\nsay you are sure to be there before the regiment goes into action. But,\nunderstand--I said, 'If possible!'\"\n\nRanjoor Singh's eye brightened and he straightened perceptibly.\n\n\"This trooper, sahib----\"\n\n\"My promise is for him as well.\"\n\n\"We accept, sahib! What is the duty?\"\n\n\"First, write a note to Colonel Kirby--I'll see that it's\ndelivered--asking him to put your name in Orders as assigned to special\nduty. Here's paper and a fountain pen.\"\n\n\"Why should all this be secret from Colonel Kirby?\" asked Ranjoor\nSingh. \"There is no wiser and no more loyal officer!\"\n\n\"Nor any officer more pugnacious on his juniors' account, I assure you!\nI can't imagine his agreeing to the use I'm making of you. I've no time\nto listen to his protests. Write, man, write!\"\n\n\"Give me the paper and the pen, sahib!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh wrote by the light of a flickering oil lamp, using his\ntrooper's shoulder for support. He passed the finished note back to the\ngeneral.\n\n\"Now some token, please, Risaldar-Major, that Colonel Kirby will be\nsure to recognize--something to prove that the note is not forged.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh pulled a ring from his finger and held it out.\n\n\"Colonel Kirby sahib gave me this,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Thanks. Shake hands, will you? I've been talking to a man to-night--to\ntwo men--if I ever did in my life! I shall go now and give this letter\nto somebody to deliver to Colonel Kirby, and I shall not see you again\nprobably until all this is over. Please do what Yasmini directs until\nyou hear from me or can see for yourself that your task is finished.\nDepend on me to remember my promise!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh saluted, military-wise, although he was not in uniform.\nThe general answered his salute and left the room, to be met by a maid,\nwho took the note and the ring from him. Five minutes later, with his\nrough disguise resumed, the general hunted about among the shadows of\nthe neighboring streets until he had found his carriage. He recognized,\nbut was not recognized by, the risaldar on the box-seat of Colonel\nKirby's shay.\n\n\n  Teeth of a wolf on a whitened bone,\n    What do the splinters say?\n  Scent of a sambur, up and gone,\n    Where will he stand at bay?\n  Sparks in the whirl of a hurrying wind.\n    Who was it laid the light?\n  Mischief, back of a woman's mind,\n    Why do the thoughtless fight?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nBlack smoke still billowed upward from the gutted\nHouse-of-the-Eight-Half-brothers, and although there were few stars\nvisible, a watery moon looked out from between dark cloudracks and\nshowed up the smoke above the Delhi roofs. Yasmini picked the right\nsimile as usual. It looked as if the biggest genie ever dreamed of must\nbe hurrying out of a fisherman's vase.\n\n\"And who is the fisherman?\" she laughed, for she is fond of that sort\nof question that sets those near her thinking and disguises the trend\nof her own thoughts as utterly as if she had not any.\n\n\"The genie might be the spirit of war!\" ventured a Baluchi, forgetting\nthe one God of his Koran in a sententious effort to please Yasmini.\n\nShe flashed a glance at him.\n\n\"Or it might be the god of the Rekis,\" she suggested; and everybody\nchuckled, because Baluchis do not relish reference to their lax\nreligious practise any more than they like to be called \"desert\npeople.\" This man was a Rind Baluch of the Marri Hills, and proud of\nit; but pride is not always an asset at Yasmini's.\n\nThey--and the police would have dearly loved to know exactly who \"they\"\nwere--stood clustered in Yasmini's great, deep window that overlooks\nher garden--the garden that can not be guessed at from the street.\nThere was not one of them who could have explained how they came to\nassemble all on that side of the room; the movement had seemed to\nevolve out of the infinite calculation that everybody takes for\ngranted, and Moslems particularly, since there seems nothing else to do\nabout it.\n\nIt did not occur to anybody to credit Yasmini with the arrangement, or\nwith the suddenly aroused interest in smoke against the after-midnight\nsky. Yet, when another man entered whose disguise was a joke to any\npractised eye--and all in the room were practised--it looked to the\nnewcomer almost as if his reception had been ready staged.\n\nHe was dressed as a Mohammedan gentleman. But his feet, when he stood\nstill, made nearly a right angle to each other, and his shoulders had\nnone of the grace that goes with good native breeding; they were proud\nenough, but the pride had been drilled in and cultivated. It sat\nsquare. And if a native gentleman had walked through the streets as\nthis man walked, all the small boys of the bazaars would have followed\nhim to learn what nation his might be.\n\nYasmini seemed delighted with him. She ran toward him, curtsied to him,\nand called him _bahadur_. She made two maids bring a chair for him, and\nmade them set it near the middle of the window whence he could see the\nsmoke, pushing the men away on either side until he had a clear view.\n\nBut he knew enough of the native mind, at all events, to look at the\nsmoke and not remark on it. It was so obvious that he was meant to talk\nabout the smoke, or to ask about it, that even a German Orientalist\nunderstanding the East through German eyes had tact enough to look in\nsilence, and so to speak, \"force trumps.\"\n\nAnd that again, of course, was exactly what Yasmini wanted. Moreover,\nshe surprised him by not leading trumps.\n\n\"They are here,\" she said, with a side-wise glance at the more than\nthirty men who crowded near the window.\n\nThe German--and he made no pretense any longer of being anything but\nGerman--sat sidewise with both hands on his knees to get a better view\nof them. He scanned each face carefully, and each man entertained a\nfeeling that he had been analyzed and ticketed and stood aside.\n\n\"I have seen all these before,\" he said. \"They are men of the North,\nand good enough fighters, I have no doubt. But they are not what I\nasked for. How many of these are trained soldiers? Which of these could\nswing the allegiance of a single native regiment. It is time now for\nproofs and deeds. The hour of talk is gone. Bring me a soldier!\"\n\n\"These also say it is all talk, sahib--words, words, words! They say\nthey will wait until the fleet that has been spoken of comes to bombard\nthe coast. For the present there are none to rally round.\"\n\n\"Yet you hinted at soldiers!\" said the German. \"You hinted at a\nregiment ready to revolt!\"\n\n\"Aye, sahib! I have repeated what _these_ say. When the soldier comes\nthere shall be other talk! See yonder smoke, _bahadur?_\"\n\nNow, then, it was time to notice things, and the German gazed over the\ngarden and Delhi walls and roofs at what looked very much more\nimportant than it really was. It looked as if at least a street must be\non fire.\n\n\"He made that holocaust, did the soldier!\"\n\nYasmini's manner was of blended awe and admiration.\n\n\"He was suspected of disloyalty. He entered that house to make\narrangements for the mutiny of a whole regiment of Sikhs, who are not\nwilling to be sent to fight across the sea. He was followed to the\nhouse, and so, since he would not be taken, he burned all the houses.\nSuch, a man is he who comes presently. Did the sahib hear the mob roar\nwhen the flames burst out at evening? No? A pity! There were many\nsoldiers in the mob, and many thousand discontented people!\"\n\nShe went close to the window, to be between the German and the light,\nand let him see her silhouetted in an attitude of hope awakening. She\ngazed at the billowing smoke as if the hope of India were embodied in\nit.\n\n\"It was thus in 'fifty-seven,\" she said darkly. \"Men began with\nburnings!\"\n\nBrown eyes, behind the German, exchanged glances, for the East is chary\nof words when it does not understand. The German nodded, for he had\nstudied history and was sure he understood.\n\n\"Sahib _hai_!\" said a sudden woman's voice, and Yasmini started as if\ntaken by surprise. There were those in the room who knew that when\ntaken by surprise she never started; but they were not German. \"He is\nhere!\" she whispered; and the German showed that he felt a crisis had\narrived. He settled down to meet it like a soldier and a man.\n\n\"Salaam!\" purred Yasmini in her silveriest voice, as Ranjoor Singh\nstrode down the middle of the room with the dignity the West may some\nday learn.\n\n\"See!\" whispered Yasmini. \"He trusts nobody. He brings his own guard\nwith him!\"\n\nBy the door at which he had entered stood a trooper of D Squadron,\nOutram's Own, no longer in uniform, but dressed as a Sikh servant. The\nman's arms were folded on his breast. The rigidity, straight stature,\nand attitude appealed to the German as the sight of sea did to the\nancient Greeks.\n\n\"Salaam!\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThe German noticed that his eyes glowed, but the rest of him was all\ncalm dignity.\n\n\"We have met before,\" said the German, rising. \"You are the Sikh with\nwhom I spoke the other night--the Sikh officer--the squadron leader!\"\n\n_\"Ja!\"_ said Ranjoor Singh; and the one word startled the German so\nthat he caught his breath.\n\n_\"Sie sprechen Deutsch?\"_\n\n_\"Ja wohl!\"_\n\nThe German muttered something half under his breath that may have been\nmeant for a compliment to Ranjoor Singh, but the risaldar-major missed\nit, for he had stepped up to the nearest of the Northern gentlemen and\nconfronted him. There was a great show of looking in each other's eyes\nand muttering under the breath some word and counter-word. Each made a\nsign with his right hand, then with his left, that the German could not\nsee, and then Ranjoor Singh stepped side wise to the next man.\n\nMan by man, slowly and with care, he looked each man present in the\neyes and tested him for the password, while Yasmini watched admiringly.\n\n\"Any who do not know the word will die to-night!\" she whispered; and\nthe German nodded, because it was evident that the Northerners were\nquite afraid. He approved of that kind of discipline.\n\n\"These are all true men--patriots,\" said Ranjoor Singh, walking back to\nhim. \"Now say what you have to say.\"\n\n\"_Jetzt_----\" began the German.\n\n\"Speak Hindustani that they all may understand,\" said Ranjoor Singh;\nand the others gathered closer.\n\n\"My friend, I am told----\"\n\nBut Yasmini broke in, bursting between Ranjoor Singh and the German.\n\n\"Nay, let the sahibs go alone into the other room. Neither will speak\nhis mind freely before company--is it not so? Into the other room,\nsahibs, while we wait here!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh bowed, and the German clicked his heels together. Ranjoor\nSingh made a sign, but the German yielded precedence; so Ranjoor Singh\nstrode ahead, and the German followed him, wishing to high Heaven he\ncould learn to walk with such consummate grace. As they disappeared\nthrough the jingling bead-curtain, the Sikh trooper followed them, and\ntook his stand again with folded arms by the door-post. The German saw\nhim, and smiled; he approved of that.\n\nThen Yasmini gathered her thirty curious Northerners together around\nher and proceeded to entertain them while the plot grew nearer to its\nclimax in another room. She led them back to the divans by the inner\nwall. She set them to smoking while she sang a song to them. She\nparried their questions with dark hints and innuendoes that left them\nmore mystified than ever; yet no man would admit he could not\nunderstand.\n\nAnd then she danced to them. She danced for an hour, to the wild minor\nmusic that her women made, and she seemed to gather strength and\nlightness as the night wore on. Near dawn the German and Ranjoor Singh\ncame out together, to find her yet dancing, and she ceased only to pull\nthe German aside and speak to him.\n\n\"Does he _really_ speak German?\" she whispered.\n\n\"He? He has read Nietzsche and von Bernhardi in the German!\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"They are difficult to read--philosophers.\"\n\n\"Has he satisfied you?\"\n\n\"He has promised that he will.\"\n\n\"Then go before I send the rest away!\"\n\nSo the German tried to look like a Mohammedan again, and went below to\na waiting landau. Before he was half-way down the stairs Yasmini's\nhands gripped tight on Ranjoor Singh's forearms and she had him backed\ninto a corner.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh, thou art no buffalo! I was wrong! Thou are a great man,\nRanjoor Singh!\"\n\nShe received no answer.\n\n\"What hast thou promised him?\"\n\n\"To show him a mutinous regiment of Sikhs.\"\n\n\"And what has he promised?\"\n\n\"To show me what we seek.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Good!\" she said.\n\n\"So now I promise thee something,\" said Ranjoor Singh sternly.\n\"To-morrow--to-day--I shall eat black shame on thy account, for this is\nthy doing. Later I will go to France. Later again, I will come back\nand--\"\n\n\"And love me as they all do!\" laughed Yasmini, pushing him away.\n\n\n  If I must lie, who love the truth,\n    (And honour bids me lie),\n  I'll tell a lordly lie forsooth\n    To be remembered by.\n  If I must cheat, whose fame is fair,\n    And fret my fame away,\n  I'll do worse than the devil dare\n    That men may rue the day!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nBeyond question Yasmini is a craftsman of amazing skill, and her\ngenius--as does all true genius--extends to the almost infinite\nconsideration of small details. The medium in which she works--human\nweakness--affords her unlimited opportunity; and she owns the trick,\nthat most great artists win, of not letting her general plan be known\nbefore the climax. Neither friend nor enemy is ever quite sure which is\nwhich until she solves the problem to the enemy's confusion.\n\nBut Yasmini could have failed in this case through overmuch finesse.\nShe was not used to Germans, and could not realize until too late that\nher compliance with this man's every demand only served to make him\nmore peremptory and more one-sided in his point of view. From a mere\nagent, offering the almost unimaginable in return for mere promises, he\nhad grown already into a dictator, demanding action as a prelude to\nreward. He had even threatened to cause her, Yasmini, to be reported to\nthe police unless she served his purpose better!\n\nIf she had obeyed the general and had picked a trooper for the business\nin hand, it is likely that Yasmini would have had to write a failure to\nher account. She had come perilously near to obedience on this\noccasion, and it had been nothing less than luck that put Ranjoor Singh\ninto her hands, luck being the pet name of India's kindest god. Ranjoor\nSingh was needed in the instant when he came to bring the German back\nto earth and a due sense of proportion.\n\nThe Sikh had a rage in his heart that the German mistook for zeal and\nnative ferocity; his manners became so brusk under the stress of it\nthat they might almost have been Prussian, and, met with its own\nreflection, that kind of insolence grows limp.\n\nHaving agreed to lie, Ranjoor Singh lied with such audacity and so much\nskill that it would have needed Yasmini to dare disbelieve him.\n\nThe German sat in state near Yasmini's great window and received, one\nafter another, liars by the dozen from the hills where lies are current\ncoin. Some of them had listened to his lectures, and some had learned\nof them at second hand; every man of them had received his cue from\nYasmini. There was too much unanimity among them; they wanted too\nlittle and agreed too readily to what the German had to say; he was\ngrowing almost suspicious toward half-past ten, when Ranjoor Singh came\nin.\n\nThere was no trooper behind him this time, for the man had been sent to\nwatch for the regiment's departure, and to pounce then on Bagh, the\ncharger, and take him away to safety. After the charger had been\ngroomed and fed and hidden, the trooper was to do what might be done\ntoward securing the risaldar-major's kit; but under no condition was\nthe kit to have precedence.\n\n\"Groom him until he shines! Guard him until I call for him! Keep him\nexercised!\" was the three-fold order that sang through the trooper's\nhead and overcame astonishment in the hurry to obey.\n\nNow it was the German's turn to be astonished. Ranjoor Singh strode in,\ndressed as a Sikh farmer, and frowned down Yasmini's instant desire to\npoke fun at him. The German rose to salute him, and the Sikh\nacknowledged the salute with a nod such as royalty might spare for a\nmenial.\n\n\"Come!\" he said curtly, and the German followed him out through the\ndoor to the stair-head where so many mirrors were. There Ranjoor Singh\nmade quite a little play of making sure they were not overheard, while\nthe German studied his own Mohammedan disguise from twenty different\nangles.\n\n\"Too much finery!\" growled Ranjoor Singh. \"I will attend to that.\nFirst, listen! Other than your talk, I have had no proof at all of you!\nYou are a spy!\"\n\n\"I am a--\"\n\n\"You are a spy! All the spies I ever met were liars from the ground up!\nI am a patriot. I am working to save my country from a yoke that is\nunbearable, and I _must_ deal in subterfuge and treachery if I would\nwin. But you are merely one who sows trouble. You are like the little\njackal--the dirty little jackal--who starts a fight between two tigers\nso that he may fill his mean belly! Don't speak--listen!\"\n\nThe German's jaw had dropped, but not because words rushed to his lips.\nHe seemed at a loss for them.\n\n\"You made me an offer, and I accepted it,\" continued Ranjoor Singh. \"I\naccepted it on behalf of India. I shall show you in about an hour from\nnow a native regiment--one of the very best native regiments, so\nmutinous that its officers must lead it out of Delhi to a camp where it\nwill be less dangerous and less likely to corrupt others.\"\n\nThe German nodded. He had asked no more.\n\n\"Then, if you fail to fulfill your part,\" said Ranjoor Singh grimly, \"I\nshall lock you in the cellar of this house, where Yasmini keeps her\ncobras!\"\n\n_\"Vorwarts!\"_ laughed the German, for there was conviction in every\nword the Sikh had said. \"I will show you how a German keeps his\nbargain!\"\n\n\"A German?\" growled Ranjoor Singh. \"A German--Germany is nothing to me!\nIf Germany can pick the bones I leave, what do I care? One does not\nbargain with a spy, either; one pays his price, and throws him to the\ncobras if he fail! Come!\"\n\nThe question of precedence no longer seemed to trouble Ranjoor Singh;\nhe turned his back without apology, and as the German followed him\ndown-stairs there came a giggle from behind the curtains.\n\n\"Were we overheard?\" he asked.\n\nBut Ranjoor Singh did not seem to care any more, and did not trouble to\nanswer him.\n\nOutside the door was a bullock-cart, of the kind in which women make\nlong journeys, with a painted, covered super-structure. The German\nfollowed Ranjoor Singh into it, and without any need for orders the\nSikh driver began to twist the bullocks' tails and send them along at\nthe pace all India loves. Then Ranjoor Singh began to pay attention to\nthe German's dress, pulling off his expensive turban and replacing that\nand his clothes with cheaper, dirtier ones.\n\n\"Why?\" asked the German.\n\n\"I will show you why,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThen they sat back, each against a side of the cart, squatting native\nstyle.\n\n\"This regiment that I will show you is mine,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"I\ncommand a squadron of it--or, rather, did, until I became suspected.\nEvery man in the regiment is mine, and will follow me at a word. When I\ngive the word they will kill their English officers.\"\n\nHe leaned his head out of the opening to spit; there seemed something\nin his mouth that tasted nasty.\n\n\"Why did they mutiny?\" asked the German.\n\n\"Ordered to France!\" said Ranjoor Singh, with lowered eyes.\n\nFor a while there was silence as the cart bumped through the muddy\nrutty streets; the only sound that interfered with thought was the\ndriver's voice, apostrophizing the bullocks; and the abuse he poured on\nthem was so time-honored as to be unnoticeable, like the cawing of the\ncity crows.\n\n\"It is strange,\" said the German, after a while. \"For years I have\ntried to get in touch with native officers. Here and there I have found\na Sepoy who would talk with me, but you are the first officer.\" He was\nbrown-studying, talking almost to himself. He did not see the curse in\nthe risaldar-major's eyes.\n\n\"I have found plenty of merchants who would promise to finance revolt,\nand plenty of hillmen who would promise anything. But all said, 'We\nwill do what the army does!' And I could not find in all this time,\namong all those people, anybody to whom I dared show what\nwe--Germany--can do to help. I have seen from the first it was only\nwith the aid of the army that we could accomplish anything, yet the\narmy has been unapproachable. How is it that you have seemed so loyal,\nall of you, until the minute of war?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh spat again through the opening with thoroughness and\ngreat deliberation. Then he proceeded to give proof that, as Yasmini\nhad said, he was really not a buffalo at all. A fool would have taken\nchances with any one of a dozen other explanations. Ranjoor Singh, with\nan expression that faintly suggested Colonel Kirby, picked the right,\nconvincing one.\n\n\"The English are not bad people,\" he said simply. \"They have left India\nbetter than they found it. They have been unselfish. They have treated\nus soldiers fairly and honorably. We would not have revolted had the\nopportunity not come, but we have long been waiting for the opportunity.\n\n\"We are not madmen--we are soldiers. We know the value of mere words.\nWe have kept our plans secret from the merchants and the hillmen,\nknowing well that they would all follow our lead. If you think that\nyou, or Germany, have persuaded us, you are mistaken. You could not\npersuade me, or any other true soldier, if you tried for fifty years!\n\n\"It is because we had decided on revolt already that I was willing to\nlisten to your offer of material assistance. We understand that Germany\nexpects to gain advantage from our revolt, but we can not help that;\nthat is incidental. As soldiers, we accept what aid we can get from\nanywhere!\"\n\n\"So?\" said the German.\n\n_\"Ja!\"_ said Ranjoor Singh. \"And that is why, if you fail me, I shall\ngive you to Yasmini's cobras!\"\n\n\"You will admit,\" said the German, \"when I have shown you, that\nGermany's foresight has been long and shrewd. Your great chance of\nsuccess, my friend, like Germany's in this war, depends on a sudden,\nswift, tremendous success at first; the rest will follow as a logical\ncorollary. It is the means of securing that first success that we have\nbeen making ready for you for two years and more.\"\n\n\"You should have credit for great secrecy,\" admitted Ranjoor Singh.\n\"Until a little while ago I had heard nothing of any German plans.\"\n\n\"Russia got the blame for what little was guessed at!\" laughed the\nGerman.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nA little before midday they reached the Ajmere Gate, and the lumbering\ncart passed under it. At the farther side the driver stopped his oxen\nwithout orders, and Ranjoor Singh stepped out, looking quickly up and\ndown the road. There were people about, but none whom he chose to favor\nwith a second glance.\n\nClose by the gate, almost under the shadow of it, and so drab and dirty\nas to be almost unnoticeable, there was a little cotton-tented booth,\nwith a stock of lemonade and sweetmeats, that did interest him. He\nlooked three times at it, and at the third look a Mohammedan wriggled\nout of it and walked away without a word.\n\n\"Come!\" commanded Ranjoor Singh, and the German got out of the cart,\nlooking not so very much unlike the poor Mohammedan who had gone away.\n\n\"Get in there!\" The German slipped into the real owner's place. So far\nas appearances went, he was a very passable sweetmeat and lemonade\nseller, and Ranjoor Singh proved competent to guard against\ncontingencies.\n\nHe picked a long stick out of the gutter and took his stand near by,\nfrowning as he saw a carriage he suspected to be Yasmini's drive under\nthe gate and come to a stand at the roadside, fifty or sixty yards away.\n\n\"If the officers should recognize me,\" he growled to the German, though\nseeming not to talk to him at all, \"I should be arrested at once, and\nshot later. But the men _will_ recognize me, and you shall see what you\nshall see!\"\n\nThree small boys came with a coin to spend, but Ranjoor Singh drove\nthem away with his long stick; they argued shrilly from a distance, and\none threw a stone at him, but finally they decided he was some new sort\nof plain-clothes \"constabeel,\" and went away.\n\nOne after another, several natives came to make small purchases, but,\nnot being boys any longer, a gruff word was enough to send them\nrunning. And then came the clatter of hoofs of the advance-guard, and\nthe German looked up to see a fire in Ranjoor Singh's eyes that a caged\ntiger could not have outdone.\n\nAll this while the bullock-cart in which they had come remained in the\nmiddle of the road, its driver dozing dreamily on his seat and the\nbullocks perfectly content to chew the cud. At the sound of the hoofs\nbehind him, the driver suddenly awoke and began to belabor and kick his\nanimals; he seemed oblivious of another cart that came toward him, and\nof a third that hurried after him from underneath the gate.\n\nIn less than sixty seconds all three carts were neatly interlocked, and\ntheir respective drivers were engaged in a war of words that beggared\nBabel.\n\nThe advance-guard halted and added words to the torrent. Colonel Kirby\ncaught up the advance-guard and halted, too.\n\n\"Does he look like a man who commands a loyal regiment?\" asked Ranjoor\nSingh; and the German studied the bowed head and thoughtful angle of a\nman who at that minute was regretting his good friend the\nrisaldar-major.\n\n\"You will note that he looks chastened!\"\n\nThe German nodded.\n\nIn his own good time Ranjoor Singh ran out and helped with that long\nstick of his to straighten out the mess; then in thirty seconds the\nwheels were unlocked again and the carts moving in a hurry to the\nroadside. The advance-guard moved on, and Kirby followed. Then, troop\nby troop, the whole of Outram's Own rode by, and the German began to\nwonder. It seemed to him that the rest of the officers were not demure\nenough, although he admitted to himself that the enigmatic Eastern\nfaces in the ranks might mean anything at all. He noted that there was\nalmost no talking, and he took that for a good sign for Germany.\n\nD Squadron came last of all, and convinced him. They rode regretfully,\nas men who missed their squadron leader, and who, in spite of a message\nfrom him, would have better loved to see him riding on their flank.\n\nBut Ranjoor Singh stepped out into the road, and the right-end man of\nthe front four recognized him. Not a word was said that the German\ncould hear, but he could see the recognition run from rank to rank and\ntroop to troop, until the squadron knew to a man; he saw them glance at\nRanjoor Singh, and from him to one another, and ride on with a new\nstiffening and a new air of \"now we'll see what comes of it!\"\n\nIt was as evident, to his practised eye, that they were glad to have\nseen Ranjoor Singh, and looked forward to seeing him again very\nshortly, as that they were in a mood for trouble, and he decided to\nbelieve the whole of what the Sikh had said on the strength of the\nobvious truth of part of it.\n\n\"Watch now the supply train!\" growled Ranjoor Singh, as the wagons\nbegan to rumble by.\n\nThe German had no means of knowing that the greater part of the\nregiment's war provisions had gone away by train from a Delhi station.\nThe wagons that followed the regiment on the march were a generous\nallowance for a regiment going into camp, but not more than that. The\nspies whose duty it was to watch the railway sidings reported to\nsomebody else and not to him.\n\nRanjoor Singh beckoned him after a while, and they came out into the\nroad, to stand between two of the bullock-wagons and gaze after the\nregiment. The shuttered carriage that Ranjoor Singh had suspected to be\nYasmini's passed them again, and the man beside the driver said\nsomething to Ranjoor Singh in an undertone, but the German did not hear\nit; he was watching the colonel and another officer talking together\nbeside the road in the distance. The shuttered carriage passed on, but\nstopped in the shadow of the gate.\n\n\"Look!\" said the German. \"I thought that officer--the adjutant, isn't\nhe--recognized you. Now he is pointing you out to the colonel! Look!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh did look, and he saw that Colonel Kirby was waiting to\nlet the regiment go by. He knew what was passing through Kirby's mind,\nsince it is given to some men, native and English, to have faith in\neach other. And he knew that there was danger ahead of him through\nwhich he might not come with his life, perhaps even with his honor. He\nwould have given, like Kirby, a full year's pay for a hand-shake then,\nand have thought the pay well spent.\n\nKirby began to canter back.\n\n\"He has recognized you!\" said the German.\n\n\"And he is coming to cut me down!\" swore Ranjoor Singh.\n\nHe dragged the German back behind the nearest cart, and together they\nran for the gloom of the big gate, leaving the driver of the\nbullock-cart standing at gaze where Ranjoor Singh had stood. The door\nof the shuttered carriage flew open as they reached it, and Ranjoor\nSingh pushed the German in. He stood a moment longer, with his foot on\nthe carriage step, watching Colonel Kirby; he watched him question the\nbullock-cart driver.\n\nThen a voice that he recognized said, \"Buffalo!\" and he followed into\nthe carriage, shutting the door behind him.\n\nThe carriage was off almost before the door slammed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Am I to be kept waiting for a week, while a Jat farmer gazes at cattle\non the road?\" demanded Yasmini, sitting forward out of the darkest\ncorner of the carriage and throwing aside a veil. \"He cares nothing for\nthee!\" she whispered. \"Didst thou see the jasmine drop into his lap\nfrom the gate? That was mine! Didst thou see him button it into his\ntunic? So, Ranjoor Singh! That for thy colonel sahib! And his head will\nsmell of _my_ musk for a week to come! What--what fools men are!\n_Jaldee, jaldee!\"_ she called to the driver through the shutters, and\nthe man whipped up his pair.\n\nIt was more than scandalous to be driven through Delhi streets in a\nshuttered carriage with a native lady, and even the German's presence\nscarcely modified the sensation; the German did not appreciate the\nrarity of his privilege, for he was too busy staring through the\nshutters at a world which tried its best to hide excitement; but\nRanjoor Singh was aware all the time of Yasmini's mischievous eyes and\nof mirth that held her all but speechless. He knew that she would make\nup tales about that ride, and would have told them to half of India to\nhis enduring shame before a year was out.\n\n\"Are you satisfied?\" she asked the German, after a long silence.\n\n\"Of what?\" asked the German.\n\n\"That Ranjoor Singh sahib can do what he has promised.\"\n\nThe German laughed.\n\n\"I have an excuse for doing what I promised,\" he said, \"if that is what\nyou mean.\"\n\n\"That regiment,\" said Ranjoor Singh, since he had made up his mind to\nlie thoroughly, \"will camp a day's march out of Delhi. The men will\nwait to hear from me for a day or two, but after that they will mutiny\nand be done with it; the men are almost out of hand with excitement.\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\nThe German's eyebrows rose, and his light-blue eyes sought Ranjoor\nSingh's.\n\n\"I mean that now is the time to do your part, that I may continue doing\nmine!\" he answered.\n\n\"What I have to offer would be of no use without the regiment to use\nit,\" said the German. \"Let the regiment mutiny, and I will lead you and\nit at once to what I spoke of.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"It does not suit my plan, or my convenience, that there should be any\noutbreak until I myself have knowledge of all my resources. When\neverything is in my hand, I will strike hard and fast in my own good\ntime.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget,\" said the German, \"that the material aid I offer\nis from Germany, and that therefore Germany has a right to state the\nterms. Of course, I know there are the cobras, but I am not afraid of\nthem. Our stipulation is that there shall be at least a show of fight\nbefore aid is given. If the cobras deal with me, and my secret dies\nwith me, there will be one German less and that is all. That regiment I\nhave seen looks ripe for mutiny.\"\n\nRanjoor Singh drew breath slowly through set teeth.\n\n\"Let it mutiny,\" said the German, \"and I am ready with such material\nassistance as will place Delhi at its mercy. Delhi is the key to India!\"\n\n\"It shall mutiny to-night!\" said Ranjoor Singh abruptly.\n\nThe German stared hard at him, though not so hard as Yasmini; the chief\ndifference was that nobody could have told she was staring, whereas the\nGerman gaped.\n\n\"It shall mutiny to-night, and you shall be there! You shall lead us\nthen to this material aid you promise, and after that, if it all turns\nout to be a lie, as I suspect, we will talk about cobras.\"\n\nFor a minute, two minutes, three minutes, while the rubber tires bumped\nalong the road toward Yasmini's, the German sat in silence, looking\nstraight in front of him.\n\n\"Order horses for him and me!\" commanded Ranjoor Singh; and Yasmini\nbowed obedience.\n\n\"When will you start?\" the German asked.\n\n\"Now! In twenty minutes! We will follow the regiment and reach camp\nsoon after it.\"\n\n\"I must speak first with my colleagues,\" said the German.\n\n\"No!\" growled the Sikh.\n\n\"My secret information is that several regiments are ordered oversea.\nSome of them will consent to go, my friend. We will do well to wait\nuntil as many regiments as possible are on the water, and then strike\nhard with the aid of such as have refused to go.\"\n\nThe carriage drew up at Yasmini's front door, and a man jumped off the\nbox seat to open the carriage.\n\n\"Say the rest inside!\" she ordered. \"Go into the house! Quickly!\"\n\nSo the German stepped out first, moving toward the door much too spryly\nfor the type of street merchant he was supposed to be.\n\n\"Do you mean that?\" whispered Yasmini, as she pushed past Ranjoor\nSingh. \"Do you mean to ride away with him and stage a mutiny? How can\nyou?\"\n\n\"She-buffalo!\" he answered, with the first low laugh she had heard from\nhim since the game began.\n\nShe ran into the house and all the way up the two steep flights of\nstairs, laughing like a dozen peals of fairy bells.\n\nAt the head of the stairs she began to sing, for she looked back and\nsaw babu Sita Ram waddling wheezily up-stairs after Ranjoor Singh and\nthe German.\n\n\"The gods surely love Yasmini!\" she told her maids. \"Catch me that babu\nand bottle him! Drive him into a room where I can speak with him alone!\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" wailed the babu at the stair-head from amid a\nmaze of women who hustled and shoved him all one way, and that the way\nhe did not want to go. \"I must speak with that German gentleman who was\ngiving lecture here--must positivelee give him warning, or all his\nhopes will be blasted everlastinglee! No--that is room where are\ncobras--I will not go there!\"\n\nIn three native languages, one after the other, he pleaded and wailed\nto no good end; the women were too many for him. He was shoved into a\nsmall room as a fat beast is driven into a slaughter-stall, and a door\nwas slammed shut on him. He screamed at an unexpected voice from behind\na curtain, and a moment later burst into a sweat from reaction at the\nsight of Yasmini.\n\n\"Listen, _babuji,_\" she purred to him.\n\n\"Who was that man asking for me?\" demanded the German.\n\n\"How should I know?\" snorted Ranjoor Singh. \"Are we to turn aside for\nevery fat babu that asks to speak to us? I have sent for horses.\"\n\n\"I will speak with that man!\" said the German.\n\nHe began to walk up and down the length of the long room, pushing aside\nthe cushions irritably, and at one end knocking over a great bowl of\nflowers. He did not appear conscious of his clumsiness, and did not\nseem to see the maids who ran to mop up the water. At the next turn\ndown the room he pushed between them as if they had not been there.\nRanjoor Singh stood watching him, stroking a black beard reflectively;\nhe was perfectly sure that Yasmini would make the next move, and was\nwilling to wait for it.\n\n\"The horses should be here in a few minutes,\" he said hopefully, after\na while, for he heard a door open.\n\nThen babu Sita Ram burst in, half running, and holding his great\nstomach as he always did when in a hurry.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" he wailed. \"Quick! Where is German gentleman? And not\nknowing German, how shall I make meaning clear? German should be\nreckoned among dead languages and--Ah! My God, sir, you astonish me!\nResemblance to Mohammedan of no particular standing in community is\nfirst class! How shall I--\"\n\n\"Say it in English!\" said the German, blocking his way.\n\n\"My God, sahib, it is bad news! How shall I avoid customaree stigma\nattaching to bearer of ill tidings?\"\n\n\"Speak!\" said the German. \"I won't hurt you!\"\n\n\"Sahib, in pursuit unavailingly of chance emolument in neighborhood of\nChandni Chowk just recently--\"\n\n\"How recently?\" the German asked.\n\n\"Oh, my God! So recently that there are yet erections of cuticle all\ndown my back! Sahib, not more than twenty minutes have elapsed, and I\nsaw this with my own eyes!\"\n\n\"Saw what--where?\"\n\n\"Where? Have I not said where? My God, I am so upset as to be losing\nsense of all proportion! Where? At German place of business--Sigelman\nand Meyer--in small street leading out of Chandni Chowk. In search of\nchance emolument, and finding none yet--finding none yet, sahib--sahib,\nI am poor man, having wife and familee dependent and also many other\ndisabilitees, including wife's relatives.\"\n\nThe German gave him some paper money impatiently. The babu unfolded it,\neyed the denomination with a spasm of relief, folded it again, and\nappeared to stow it into his capacious stomach.\n\n\"Sahib, while I was watching, police came up at double-quick march and\narrested everybodee, including all Germans in building. There was much\nannoyance manifested when search did not reveal presence of one other\nsahib. So I ran to give warning, being veree poor man and without\nsalaried employment.\"\n\n\"What happened to the Germans?\"\n\n\"Jail, sahib! All have gone to jail! By this time they are all\nexcommunication, supplied with food and water by authorities. Having\nonce been jail official myself, I can testify--\"\n\n\"What happened to the office?\"\n\n\"Locked up, sahib! Big red seal--much sealing wax, and stamp of police\ndepartment, with notice regarding penalty for breaking same, and also\npolice sentry at door!\"\n\nLooking more unlike a Mohammedan street vender than ever, the German\nbegan to pace the room again with truly martial strides, frowning as he\nsought through the recesses of his mind for the correct solution of the\nproblem.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said, coming to a stand in front of Ranjoor Singh. \"I have\nchanged my mind!\"\n\n\"The horses are ready,\" answered Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"The German government has been to huge expense to provide aid of the\nright kind, to be ready at the right minute. My sole business is to see\nthat the utmost use is made of it.\"\n\n\"That also is my sole business!\" vowed Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"You have heard that the police are after me?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh nodded.\n\n\"Can you get away from here unseen--unknown to the police?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh nodded again, for he was very sure of Yasmini's resource.\n\nAgain the German began to pace the room, now with his hands behind him,\nnow with folded arms, now with his chin down to his breast, and now\nwith a high chin as he seemed on the verge of reaching some\ndetermination. And then Yasmini began to loose the flood of her\nresources, that Ranjoor Singh might make use of what he chose; she was\nsatisfied to leave the German in the Sikh's hands and to squander aid\nat random.\n\nMen began to come in, one at a time. They would whisper to Ranjoor\nSingh, and hurry out again. Some of them would whisper to Yasmini over\nin the window, and she would give them mock messages to carry, very\nseriously. Babu Sita Ram was stirred out of a meditative coma and sent\nhurrying away, to come back after a little while and wring his hands.\nHe ran over to Yasmini.\n\n\"It is awful!\" he wailed. \"Soon there will be no troops left with which\nto quell Mohammedan uprising. All loyal troops are leaving, and none\nbut disloyal men are left behind. The government is mad, and I am veree\nmuch afraid!\"\n\nYasmini quieted him, and Ranjoor Singh, pretending to be busy with\nother messengers, noted the effect of the babu's wail on the German. He\njudged the \"change of mind\" had gone far enough.\n\n\"We should lose time by following my regiment,\" he said at last. \"There\nare now five more regiments ready to mutiny, and they will come to me\nto wherever I send for them.\"\n\nThe German's blue eyes gazed into the Sikh's brown ones very shrewdly\nand very long. His hand sought the neighborhood of his hip, and dwelt\nthere a moment longer than the Sikh thought necessary.\n\n\"I have decided we must hurry,\" he said. \"I will show you what I have\nto show. I will not be taking chances. You must bring a messenger, and\nhe must go for your mutineers while you stay there with me. When we are\nthere, you will be in my power until the regiments come; and when they\ncome I will surrender to you. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Then choose your messenger. Choose a man who will not try to play\ntricks--a man who will not warn the authorities, because if there is\nany slip, any trickery, I will undo in one second all that has been\ndone!\"\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh conferred with Yasmini over the two great bowls of\nflowers that always stand in her big window; and she suppressed a\nsqueal of excitement while she watched the German resume his pacing up\nand down.\n\n\"Take Sita Ram!\" she advised.\n\nRanjoor Singh scowled at the babu.\n\n\"That fat bellyful of fear!\" he growled. \"I would rather take a pig!\"\n\n\"All the same, take Sita Ram!\" she advised.\n\nSo the babu was roused again out of a comfortable snooze, and Yasmini\nwhispered to him something that frightened him so much that he trembled\nlike a man with palsy.\n\n\"I am married man with children!\" he expostulated.\n\n\"I will be kind to your widow!\" purred Yasmini.\n\n\"I will not go!\" vowed the babu.\n\n\"Put him in the cobra room!\" she commanded, and some maids came closer\nto obey.\n\n\"I will go!\" said Sita Ram. \"But, oh, my God, a man should receive\npecuniary recompense far greater than legendary ransom! I shall not\ncome back alive! I know I shall not come back alive!\"\n\n\"Who cares, _babuji?_\" asked Yasmini.\n\n\"True!\" said Sita Ram. \"This is land of devil-take-hindmost, and with\nmy big stomach I am often last. I am veree full of fear!\"\n\n\"We shall need food,\" interposed the German. \"Water will be there, but\nwe had better have sufficient food with us for two nights.\"\n\nYasmini gave a sharp order, and several of her maids ran out of the\nroom. Ten minutes later they returned with three baskets, and gave one\neach to the German, to Ranjoor Singh, and to Sita Ram. Sita Ham opened\nhis and peered in. The German opened his, looked pleased, and closed\nthe lid again. Ranjoor Singh accepted his at its face value, and did\nnot open it.\n\n\"May the memsahib never lack plenty from which to give!\" he said, for\nthere is no word for \"Thank you\" in all India.\n\n\"I will bless the memsahib at each mouthful!\" said Sita Ram.\n\n\"Truly a bellyful of blessings!\" laughed Yasmini.\n\nThen they all went to the stair-head and watched and listened through\nthe open door while a closed carriage was driven away in a great hurry.\nThree maids and six men came up-stairs one after another, at intervals,\nto report the road all clear; the first carriage had not been followed,\nand there was nobody watching; another carriage waited. Babu Sita Ram\nwas sent downstairs to get into the waiting carriage and stay there on\nthe lookout.\n\n\"Now bring him better clothes!\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nBut Yasmini had anticipated that order.\n\n\"They are in the carriage, on the seat,\" she said.\n\nSo the German went down-stairs and climbed in beside the babu, changing\nhis turban at once for the better one that he found waiting in there.\n\n\"This performance is worth a rajah's ransom!\" grumbled babu Sita Ram.\n\"Will sahib not put elbow in my belly, seeing same is highly sensitive?\"\n\nBut the German laughed at him.\n\n\"Love is rare, non-contagious sickness!\" asserted Sita Ram with\nconviction.\n\nAt the head of the stairs Ranjoor Singh and Yasmini stood looking into\neach other's eyes. He looked into pools of laughter and mystery that\ntold him nothing at all; she saw a man's heart glowing in his brown\nones.\n\n\"It will be for you now,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"to act with speed and\nall discretion. I don't know what we are going to see, although I know\nit is artillery of some sort. I am sure he has a plan for destroying\nevery trace of whatever it is, and of himself and me, if he suspects\ntreachery. I know no more. I can only go ahead.\"\n\n\"And trust me!\" said Yasmini.\n\nThe Sikh did not answer.\n\n\"And trust me!\" repeated Yasmini. \"I will save you out of this, Ranjoor\nSingh sahib, that we may fight our quarrel to a finish later on. What\nwould the world be without enemies? You will not find artillery!\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I have known for nearly two years what you will find there, my friend!\nOnly I have not known exactly where to find it. And yet sometimes I\nhave thought that I have known that, too! Go, Ranjoor Singh. You will\nbe in danger. Above all, do not try to force that German's hand too far\nuntil I come with aid. It is better to talk than fight, so long as the\nenemy is strongest!\"\n\n\"Woman!\" swore Ranjoor Singh so savagely that she laughed straight into\nhis face. \"If you suspect--if you can guess where we are going--send\nmen to surround the place and watch!\"\n\n\"Will a tiger walk into a watched lair?\" she answered. \"Go, talker! Go\nand do things!\"\n\nSo, swearing and dissatisfied, Ranjoor Singh went down and climbed on\nto the box seat of a two-horse carriage.\n\n\"Which way?\" he asked; and the German growled an answer through the\nshutters.\n\n\"Now straight on!\" said the German, after fifteen minutes. \"Straight on\nout of Delhi!\"\n\nThey were headed south, and driving very slowly, for to have driven\nfast would have been to draw attention to themselves. Ranjoor Singh\nscarcely troubled to look about him, and Sita Ram fell into a doze, in\nspite of his protestations of fear. The German was the only one of the\nparty who was at pains to keep a lookout, and he was most exercised to\nknow whether they were being followed; over and over again he called on\nRanjoor Singh to stop until a following carriage should overtake them\nand pass on.\n\nSo they were a very long time driving to Old Delhi, where the ruins of\nold cities stand piled against one another in a tangled mass of verdure\nthat is hardly penetrable except where the tracks wind in and out. The\nshadow of the Kutb Minar was long when they drove past it, and it was\ndusk when the German shouted and Ranjoor Singh turned the horses in\nbetween two age-old trees and drew rein at a shattered temple door.\n\nSome monkeys loped away, chattering, and about a thousand parakeets\nflew off, shrilling for another roost. But there was no other sign of\nlife.\n\n\"Stable the horses in here!\" said the German; and they did so, Ranjoor\nSingh dipping water out of a rain-pool and filling a stone trough that\nhad once done duty as receptacle for gifts for a long-forgotten god.\nThen they pushed the carriage under a tangle of hanging branches.\n\n\"Look about you!\" advised the German, as he emptied food for the horses\non the temple floor; and babu Sita Ram made very careful note of the\ntemple bearings, while Ranjoor Singh and the German blocked the old\ndoorway with whatever they could find to keep night-prowlers outside\nand the horses in.\n\nThen the German led the way into the dark, swinging a lantern that he\nhad unearthed from some recess. Babu Sita Ram walked second,\ncomplaining audibly and shuddering at every shadow. Last came Ranjoor\nSingh, grim, silent. And the rain beat down on all three of them until\nthey were drenched and numb, and their feet squelched in mud at every\nstep.\n\nFor all the darkness, Ranjoor Singh made note of the fact that they\nwere following a wagon track, into which the wheels of a native cart\nhad sunk deep times without number. Only native ox-carts leave a track\nlike that.\n\nIt must have been nine o'clock, and the babu was giving signs of nearly\ncomplete exhaustion, when they passed beyond a ring of trees into a\nclearing. They stood at the edge of the clearing in a shadow for about\nten minutes, while the German watched catwise for signs of life.\n\n\"It is now,\" he said, tapping Ranjoor Singh's chest, \"that you begin to\nbe at my mercy. I assure you that the least disobedience on your part\nwill mean your instant death!\"\n\n\"Lead on!\" growled Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Do you recognize the place?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh peered through the rain in every direction. At each\ncorner of the clearing, north, south, east and west, he could dimly see\nsome sort of ruined arch, and there was another ruin in the center.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the oldest temple ruin anywhere near Delhi. On some\ninscriptions it is called 'Temple of the Four Winds,' but the old Hindu\nwho lived in it before we bribed him to go away called it the 'Winds of\nthe World.' It is known as 'Winds of the World' on the books of the\nGerman War Office. I think it is really of Greek origin myself, but I\nam not an Orientalist, and the text-books all say that I am wrong.\"\n\n\"Lead on!\" said Ranjoor Singh; and the German led them, swinging his\nlantern and seeming not at all afraid of being seen now.\n\n\"We have taken steps quite often to make the people hereabouts believe\nthis temple haunted!\" he said. \"They avoid it at night as if the devil\nlived here. If any of them see my lantern, they will not stop running\ntill they reach the sea!\"\n\nThey came to a ruin that was such an utter ruin that it looked as if an\nearthquake must have shaken a temple to pieces to be disintegrated by\nthe weather; but Ranjoor Singh noticed that the cart-tracks wound\naround the side of it, and when they came to a fairly large teak\ntrap-door, half hidden by creepers, he was not much surprised.\n\n\"My God, gentlemen!\" said Sita Ram. \"That place is wet-weather refuge\nfor many million cobras! If I must die, I will prefer to perish in\nrain, where wife and family may find me for proper funeral rites. I\nwill not go in there!\"\n\nBut the German raised the trap-door, and Ranjoor Singh took the unhappy\nbabu by the scruff of his fat neck.\n\n\"In with you!\" he ordered.\n\nAnd, chattering as if his teeth were castanets, the babu trod gingerly\ndown damp stone steps whose center had been worn into ruts by countless\nfeet. The German came last, and let the trap slam shut.\n\n\"My God!\" yelled the babu. \"Let me go! I am family man!\"\n\n\"_Vorwarts_!\" laughed the German, leading the way toward a teak door\nset in a stone wall.\n\nThey were in an ancient temple vault that seemed to have miraculously\nescaped from the destruction that had overwhelmed the whole upper part.\nNot a stone of it was out of place. It was wind and water-tight, and\nthe vaulted roof, that above was nothing better than a mound of debris,\nfrom below looked nearly as perfect as when the stones had first been\nfitted into place.\n\nThe German produced a long key, opened the teak door, and stood aside\nto let them pass.\n\n\"No, no!\" shuddered Sita Ram; but Ranjoor Singh pushed him through; the\nGerman followed, and the door slammed shut as the trap had done.\n\n\"And now, my friends, I will convince you!\" said the German, holding\nthe lantern high. \"What are those?\"\n\nThe light from the solitary lantern fell on rows and rows of bales,\narranged in neat straight lines, until away in the distance it\nsuggested endless other shadowy bales, whose outlines could be little\nmore than guessed at. They were in a vault so huge that Ranjoor Singh\nmade no attempt to estimate its size.\n\n\"See this!\" said the German, walking close to something on a wooden\nstand, and he held the light above it. \"In the office in Delhi that the\npolice have just sealed up there is a wireless apparatus very much like\nthis. This, that you see here, is a detonator. This is fulminate of\nmercury. This is dynamite. With a touch of a certain key in Delhi we\ncould have blown up this vault at any minute of the past two years, if\nwe had thought it necessary to hide our tracks. A shot from this pistol\nwould have much the same effect,\" he added darkly.\n\n\"But the bales?\" asked Ranjoor Singh. \"What is in the bales?\"\n\n\"Dynamite bombs, my friend! You native soldiers have no artillery, and\nwe have seen from the first the necessity of supplying a substitute. By\nmaking full use of the element of surprise, these bombs should serve\nyour purpose. There are one million of them, packed two hundred in a\nbale--much more useful than artillery in the hands of untrained men!\n\n\"Those look like bales of blankets. They are. Cotton blankets from\nMuenchen-Gladbach. Only, the middle blankets have been omitted, and the\nouter ones have served as a cushion to prevent accidental discharge.\nThey have been imported in small lots at a time, and brought here four\nor five at a time in ox-carts from one or other of the Delhi railway\nstations by men who are no longer in this part of India--men who have\nbeen pensioned off.\"\n\n\"How did you get them through the Customs?\" wondered Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Did you ever see a rabbit go into his hole?\" the German asked. \"They\nwere very small consignments, obviously of blankets. The duty was paid\nwithout demur, and the price paid the Customs men was worth their\nwhile. That part was easy!\"\n\n\"Of what size are the bombs?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"About the size of an orange. Come, I'll show you.\"\n\nHe led him to an opened bale, and showed him two hundred of them\nnestling like the eggs of some big bird.\n\n\"My God!\" moaned Sita Ram. \"Are those dynamite? Sahibs--snakes are\nbetter! Snakes can feel afraid, but those--ow! Let me go away!\"\n\n\"Let him go,\" said the German. \"Let him take his message.\"\n\n\"Go, then!\" ordered Ranjoor Singh; and the German walked to the door to\nlet him out.\n\n\"What is your message?\" he asked.\n\n\"To Yasmini first, for she is in touch with all of them,\" said Sita\nRam. \"First I will go to Yasmini. Then she will come here to say the\nregiments have started. First she will come alone; after her the\nregiments.\"\n\n\"She had better be alone!\" said the German. \"Go on, run! And don't\nforget the way back? Wait! How will she know the way? How will you\ndescribe it to her?\"\n\n\"She? Describe it to her? I will tell her 'The Winds of the World,' and\nshe will come straight.\"\n\n\"How? How will she know?\"\n\n\"The priest who used to be here--whom you bribed to go away--he is her\nnight doorkeeper now!\" said Sita Ram. \"Yes, she will come veree\nquickly!\"\n\nThe German let him out with an air mixed of surprise and disbelief, and\nreturned to Ranjoor Singh with far less iron in his stride, though with\nno less determination.\n\n\"Now we shall see!\" he said, drawing an automatic pistol and cocking it\ncarefully. \"This is not meant as a personal threat to you, so long as\nwe two are in here alone. It's in case of trickery from outside. I\nshall blow this place sky-high if anything goes wrong. If the regiments\ncome, good! You shall have the bombs. If they don't come, or if there's\na trick played--click! Good-by! We'll argue the rest in Heaven!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Ranjoor Singh; and, to show how little he felt\nconcerned, he drew his basket to him and began to eat.\n\nThe German followed suit. Then Ranjoor Singh took most of his wet\nclothes off and spread them upon the bales to dry. The German imitated\nthat too.\n\n\"Go to sleep if you care to,\" said the German. \"I shall stand watch,\"\nhe added, with a dry laugh.\n\nBut if a Sikh soldier can not manage without sleep, there is nobody on\nearth who can. Ranjoor Singh sat back against a bale, and the watch\nresolved itself into a contest of endurance, with the end by no means\nin sight.\n\n\"How long should it take that man to reach her?\" asked the German.\n\n\"Who knows?\" the Sikh answered.\n\n\"Perhaps three hours, perhaps a week! She is never still, and there are\nthose five regiments to hold in readiness.\"\n\n\"She is a wonderful woman,\" said the German.\n\nRanjoor Singh grunted.\n\n\"How is it that she has known of this place all this time, and yet has\nnever tried to meddle with us?\"\n\n\"I, too, am anxious to know that!\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"You are surly, my friend! You do not like this pistol? You take it as\nan insult? Is that it?\"\n\n\"I am thinking of those regiments, and of these grenades, and of what I\nmean to do,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Let us talk it over.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Please your self!\"\n\nThey sat facing each other for hour after dreary hour, leaning back\nagainst bales and thinking each his own thoughts. After about four\nhours of it, it occurred to the German to dismantle the wireless\ndetonator.\n\n\"We should have been blown up if the police had grown inquisitive,\" he\nsaid, with a shrug of his shoulders, returning to his seat.\n\nAfter that they sat still for four hours more, and then put their\nclothes on, not that they were dry yet, but the German had grown tired\nof comparing Ranjoor Singh's better physique with his own. He put his\nclothes on to hide inferiority, and Ranjoor Singh followed suit for the\nsake of manners.\n\n\"What rank do you hold in your army at home?\" asked Ranjoor Singh,\nafter an almost endless interval.\n\n\"If I told you that, my friend, you would be surprised.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"I think you are an officer who was\ndismissed from the service.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it!\"\n\n\"What makes you sure?\"\n\n\"You are too well educated for a noncommissioned officer. If you had\nnot been dismissed from the service you would be on the fighting\nstrength, or else in the reserve and ready for the front in Europe. And\nwhat army keeps spies of your type on its strength? Am I right?\"\n\nBut then came Yasmini, carrying her food-basket as the rest had done.\nShe knocked at the outer trap-door, and the German ran to peep through\na hidden window at her. Then he went up a partly ruined stair and\nlooked all around the clearing through gaps in the debris overhead that\nhad been glazed for protection's sake. Then he admitted her.\n\nShe ran in past him, ran past him again when he opened the second door,\nand laughed at Ranjoor Singh. She seemed jubilant and very little\ninterested in the bombs that the German was at pains to explain to her.\nShe had to tell of five regiments on the way.\n\n\"The first will be here in two or three hours\" she asserted; \"your men,\nRanjoor Singh--your Jat Sikhs that are ever first to mutiny!\"\n\nShe squealed delight as the Sikh's face flushed at the insult.\n\n\"What is the cocked pistol for?\" she asked the German.\n\nHe told her, but she did not seem frightened in the least. She began to\nsing, and her voice echoed strangely through the vault until she\nherself seemed to grow hypnotized by it, and she began to sway, pushing\nher basket away from her behind a bale near where the German sat.\n\n\"I will dance for you!\" she said suddenly.\n\nShe arose and produced a little wind instrument from among her\nclothing--a little bell-mouthed wooden thing, with a voice like Scots\nbagpipes.\n\n\"Out of the way, Ranjoor Singh!\" she ordered. \"Sit yonder. I will dance\nbetween you, so that the German sahib may watch both of us at once!\"\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh went back twenty feet away, wondering at her mood and\nwondering even more what trick she meant to play. He had reached the\nconclusion, very reluctantly, that presently the German would fire that\npistol of his and end the careers of all three of them; so he was\nthinking of the squadron on its way to France. In a way he was sorry\nfor Yasmini; but it was the squadron and Colonel Kirby that drew his\nheart-strings.\n\nSwaying to and fro, from the waist upward, Yasmini began to play her\nlittle instrument. The echoing vault became a solid sea of throbbing\nnoise, and as she played she increased her speed of movement, until the\nGerman sat and gaped. He had seen her dance on many more than one\noccasion. So had Ranjoor Singh. Never had either of them, or any living\nman, seen Yasmini dance as she did that night.\n\nShe was a storm. Her instrument was but an added touch of artistry to\nheighten the suggestion. Prom a slow, rhythmic swing she went by gusts\nand fits and starts to the wildest, utterly abandoned fury of a\nhurricane, sweeping a wide circle with her gauzy dress; and at the\nheight of each elemental climax, in mid-whirl of some new amazing\nfigure, she would set her instrument to screaming, until the German\nshouted \"Bravo!\" and Ranjoor Singh nodded grave approval.\n\n\"_Kreuz blitzen!_\" swore the German suddenly, leaping to his feet and\nstaggering.\n\nAnd Yasmini pounced on him. Ranjoor Singh could not see what had\nhappened, but he sprang to his feet and ran toward them. But before he\ncould reach them Yasmini had snatched the German's pistol and tossed it\nto him, standing back from the writhing German, panting, with blazing\neyes, and looking too lovely to be human. She did not speak. She looked.\n\nAnd Ranjoor Singh looked too. Under the writhing German, and back again\nover him, there crawled a six-foot hooded cobra, seeming to caress the\ncarcass of his prey.\n\n\"He will be dead in five--ten minutes,\" said Yasmini, \"and then I will\ncatch my snake again! If you want to ask him questions you had better\nhurry!\"\n\nThen Ranjoor Singh recalled the offices that men had done for him when\nhe was wounded. He asked the German if he might send messages, and to\nwhom. But the dying man seemed to be speechless, and only writhed. It\nwas nearly a minute before Ranjoor Singh divined his purpose, and\npounced on the hand that lay underneath him. He wrenched away another\npistol only just in time. The snake crawled away, and Yasmini coaxed it\nslowly back into its basket.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"when he is dead we will drive back to Delhi and amuse\nourselves! You shall run away to fight men you never quarreled with,\nand I will govern India! Is that not so?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh did not answer her. He kept trying again and again to get\nsome message from the German to send perhaps to a friend in Germany.\nBut the man died speechless, and Ranjoor Singh could find no scrap of\npaper on him or no mark that would give any clue to his identity.\n\n\"Come!\" said Yasmini. \"Lock the door on him. We will tell the general\nsahib, and the general sahib will send some one to bury him. Come!\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Speak. When did you first know that\nthese Germans had taken this vault to use?\"\n\n\"More than two years ago,\" she boasted, \"when the old priest, that was\nno priest at all, came to me to be doorkeeper.\"\n\n\"And when did you know that they were storing dynamite in here?\"\n\n\"I did not know.\"\n\n\"Then, blankets?\"\n\n\"Bah! Two years ago, when a Customs clerk with too much money began to\nmake love to a maid of mine.\"\n\n\"Then why did you not warn the government at once, and so save all this\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"Buffalo! Much fun that would have been! Ranjoor Singh, thy Jat\nimagination does thee justice. Come, come and chase that regiment of\nthine, and spill those stupid brains in France! Lock the door and come\naway!\"\n\n\n  Brother, a favor I came to crave,\n    Oh, more than brother, oh, more than friend!\n  Spare me a half o' thy soldier grave,\n    That I sleep with thee at the end!\n  Spur to spur, and knee to knee,\n    Brother, I'll ride to death with thee!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe crew of the Messageries Maritimes steamship _Duc d'Orleans_ will\ntell of a tall Sikh officer, with many medals on his breast, who\nboarded their ship in Bombay with letters to the captain from a British\nofficer of such high rank as to procure him instant accession to his\nrequest. Bound homeward from Singapore, the _Duc d'Orleans_ had put\ninto Bombay for coal, supplies and orders. She left with orders for\nMarseilles, and on board her there went this same Sikh officer, who, it\nseemed, had missed the transport on which his regiment had sailed.\n\nHe had with him a huge, ill-mannered charger, and one Sikh trooper by\nway of servant. The charger tried to eat all that came near him,\nincluding his horse-box, the ship's crew, and enough hay for at least\ntwo ordinary horses. But Ranjoor Singh, who said very little to anybody\nabout anything, had a certain way with him, and men put up with the\ncharger's delinquencies for its owner's sake.\n\nWhen they reached the Red Sea, and the ship rolled less, Ranjoor Singh\nand his trooper went to most extraordinary lengths to keep the charger\nin condition. They took him out of his box and walked him around the\ndecks for hours at a time, taking turns at it until officer, trooper\nand horse were tired out.\n\nThey did the same all down the Mediterranean. And when they landed at\nMarseilles the horse was fit, as he proved to his own brute\nsatisfaction by trying to kick the life out of a gendarme on the quay.\n\nAnother letter from somebody very high, in authority to a French\ngeneral officer in Marseilles procured the instant supply of a horse\nfor the Sikh trooper and two passes on a northbound train. The evening\nof their landing saw them on their way to the front, Ranjoor Singh in a\nfirst-class compartment, and his man in the horse-box. Neither knew any\nFrench to speak of, but the French were very kind to these dark-skinned\ngentlemen who were in so much hurry to help them win the war.\n\nIt was dark--nearly pitch--dark at the journey's end. The moon shone\nnow and then through banks of black clouds, and showed long lines of\npoplar trees. Beyond, in the distance, there was a zone in which great\nflashes leaped and died--great savage streaks of fire of many\ncolors--and a thundering that did not cease at all.\n\nAlong the road that ran between the poplars two men sent their horses\nat a rousing clip, though not so fast as to tax them to the utmost. The\nman in front rode a brute that lacked little of seventeen hands and\nthat fought for the bit as if he would like to eat the far horizon.\n\nIn the very, very dark zone, on the near side of where the splashes of\nred fire fell, jingling bits and a kick now and then proclaimed the\npresence of a regiment of cavalry. Nothing else betrayed them until one\nwas near enough to see the whites of men's eyes in the dark, for they\nwere native Indian cavalry, who know the last master-touches of the art\nof being still.\n\nBetween them and the very, very dark zone--which was what the Frenchmen\ncall a forest, and some other nations call a stand of timber--a little\ngroup of officers sat talking in low tones, eight Englishmen and the\nothers Sikhs.\n\n\"They say they're working round the edge--say they can't hold 'em. It\nlooks very much as if we're going to get our chance to-night. When a\nred light flashes three times at this near corner of the woods, we're\nto ride into 'em in line--it'll mean that our chaps are falling back in\na hurry, leaving lots of room between 'em and the wood for us to ride\nthrough. Better join your men, you fellows! Oh, lord! What wouldn't\nRanjoor Singh have given to be here! What's that?\"\n\nThere came a challenge from the rear. Two horsemen cantered up.\n\n\"Who are you? What d' you want?\"\n\n\"Sahib! Colonel Kirby sahib!\"\n\n\"What is it? Hallo--there are the three lights--no, two lights--that's\n'Get ready!' Who are you? Why--Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\n\"Salaam, sahib!\"\n\n\"Shake hands. By gad--I'm glad! Find your squadron, Ranjoor Singh--find\nit at once, man--you're just in time. There go the three lights!\n_Outram's Own!--in line of squadron columns to the right--Trot, March!\nRight!\"_\n\nRanjoor Singh had kept the word of babu Sita Ram, and had managed to be\nwith them when the first blood ran.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Winds of the World, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WINDS OF THE WORLD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6751.txt or 6751.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/7/5/6751/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Charles Franks and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
