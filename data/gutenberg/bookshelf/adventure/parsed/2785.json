France, with Paris and all her children still rushes\nblindly, madly on; defies the powerful coalition,--Austria, England,\nSpain, Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of carnage,--defies\nthe Universe and defies God!\n\nParis this September 1793!--or shall we call it Vendemiaire, Year I.\nof the Republic?--call it what we will! Paris! a city of bloodshed, of\nhumanity in its lowest, most degraded aspect. France herself a gigantic\nself-devouring monster, her fairest cities destroyed, Lyons razed to the\nground, Toulon, Marseilles, masses of blackened ruins, her bravest sons\nturned to lustful brutes or to abject cowards seeking safety at the cost\nof any humiliation.\n\nThat is thy reward, oh mighty, holy Revolution! apotheosis of equality\nand fraternity! grand rival of decadent Christianity.\n\nFive weeks now since Marat, the bloodthirsty Friend of the People,\nsuccumbed beneath the sheath-knife of a virgin patriot, a month since\nhis murderess walked proudly, even enthusiastically, to the guillotine!\nThere has been no reaction--only a great sigh!... Not of content or\nsatisfied lust, but a sigh such as the man-eating tiger might heave\nafter his first taste of long-coveted blood.\n\nA sigh for more!\n\nA king on the scaffold; a queen degraded and abased, awaiting death,\nwhich lingers on the threshold of her infamous prison; eight hundred\nscions of ancient houses that have made the history of France; brave\ngenerals, Custine, Blanchelande, Houchard, Beauharnais; worthy patriots,\nnoble-hearted women, misguided enthusiasts, all by the score and by the\nhundred, up the few wooden steps which lead to the guillotine.\n\nAn achievement of truth!\n\nAnd still that sigh for more!\n\nBut for the moment,--a few seconds only,--Paris looked round her mighty\nself, and thought things over!\n\nThe man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful jaws\nand pondered!\n\nSomething new!--something wonderful!\n\nWe have had a new Constitution, a new Justice, new Laws, a new Almanack!\n\nWhat next?\n\nWhy, obviously!--How comes it that great, intellectual, aesthetic Paris\nnever thought of such a wonderful thing before?\n\nA new religion!\n\nChristianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats, wealthy\noppressors of the People, the Church but another form of wanton tyranny.\n\nLet us by all means have a new religion.\n\nAlready something has been done to destroy the old! To destroy! always\nto destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars spoliated, tombs\ndesecrated, priests and curates murdered; but that is not enough.\n\nThere must be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a new\nGod.\n\n\"Man is a born idol-worshipper.\"\n\nVery well then! let the People have a new religion and a new God.\n\nStay!--Not a God this time!--for God means Majesty, Power, Kingship!\neverything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of France has\nstruggled and fought to destroy.\n\nNot a God, but a goddess.\n\nA goddess! an idol! a toy! since even the man-eating tiger must play\nsometimes.\n\nParis wanted a new religion, and a new toy, and grave men, ardent\npatriots, mad enthusiasts, sat in the Assembly of the Convention and\nseriously discussed the means of providing her with both these things\nwhich she asked for.\n\nChaumette, I think it was, who first solved the difficulty:--Procureur\nChaumette, head of the Paris Municipality, he who had ordered that\nthe cart which bore the dethroned queen to the squalid prison of the\nConciergerie should be led slowly past her own late palace of the\nTuileries, and should be stopped there just long enough for her to see\nand to feel in one grand mental vision all that she had been when she\ndwelt there, and all that she now was by the will of the People.\n\nChaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic;--the torture of the fallen\nQueen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the guillotine on her\nneck.\n\nNo wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first\ndiscovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now.\n\n\"Let us have a Goddess of Reason,\" he said, \"typified if you will by\nthe most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of the Goddess of\nReason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws which for centuries\nhave been flaunted by overbearing priests before the eyes of starving\nmultitudes, let the People rejoice and dance around that funeral pile,\nand above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The\nGoddess of Reason! the only deity our new and regenerate France shall\nacknowledge throughout the centuries which are to come!\"\n\nLoud applause greeted the impassioned speech.\n\n\"A new goddess, by all means!\" shouted the grave gentlemen of the\nNational Assembly, \"the Goddess of Reason!\"\n\nThey were all eager that the People should have this toy; something to\nplay with and to tease, round which to dance the mad Carmagnole and sing\nthe ever-recurring \"Ca ira.\"\n\nSomething to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of\nits own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.\n\nProcureur Chaumette enlarged upon his original idea; like a true artist\nwho sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the\nminute details, he was already busy elaborating his scheme.\n\n\"The goddess must be beautiful... not too young... Reason can only go\nhand in hand with the riper age of second youth... she must be decked\nout in classical draperies, severe yet suggestive... she must be rouged\nand painted... for she is a mere idol... easily to be appeased with\nincense, music and laughter.\"\n\nHe was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking minutiae of\ndetail, with which to render his theme more and more attractive.\n\nBut patience was never the characteristic of the Revolutionary\nGovernment of France. The National Assembly soon tired of Chaumette's\ndithyrambic utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain, Danton was yawning\nlike a gigantic leopard.\n\nSoon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than that of\nthe Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand National fete,\nsemi-religious in character, but of the new religion which destroyed and\ndesecrated and never knelt in worship.\n\nCitizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means--Henriot conceded\nthat the idea was a good one--but the goddess merely as a figure-head:\naround her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests, typifying\nthe destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules carrying loads of sacred\nvessels, the spoils of ten thousand churches of France, and ballet girls\nin bacchanalian robes, dancing the Carmagnole around the new deity.\n\nPublic Prosecutor Foucquier Tinville thought all these schemes very\ntame. Why should the People of France be led to think that the era of\na new religion would mean an era of milk and water, of pageants and of\nfireworks? Let every man, woman, and child know that this was an era of\nblood and again of blood.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed in passionate accents, \"would that all the traitors\nin France had but one head, that it might be cut off with one blow of\nthe guillotine!\"\n\nHe approved of the National fete, but he desired an apotheosis of the\nguillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on\none grand and glorious day: ten thousand heads to adorn the Place de\nla Revolution on a great, never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the\nguillotine had accomplished this record work.\n\nBut Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately hailed from\nthe South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the\nwhole of this horrible decade. He would not be outdone by Tinville's\nbloodthirsty schemes.\n\nHe was the inventor of the \"Noyades,\" which had been so successful at\nLyons and Marseilles. \"Why not give the inhabitants of Paris one of\nthese exhilarating spectacles?\" he asked with a coarse, brutal laugh.\n\nThen he explained his invention, of which he was inordinately proud.\nSome two or three hundred traitors, men, women, and children, tied\nsecurely together with ropes in great, human bundles and thrown upon a\nbarge in the middle of the river: the barge with a hole in her bottom!\nnot too large! only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly, very slowly,\nin sight of the crowd of delighted spectators.\n\nThe cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as they felt\nthe waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they felt themselves\npowerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved most exhilarating,\nso Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the true patriots of Lyons.\n\nThus the discussion continued.\n\nThis was the era when every man had but one desire, that of outdoing\nothers in ferocity and brutality, and but one care, that of saving his\nown head by threatening that of his neighbour.\n\nThe great duel between the Titanic leaders of these turbulent parties,\nthe conflict between hot-headed Danton on the one side and cold-blooded\nRobespierre on the other, had only just begun; the great, all-devouring\nmonsters had dug their claws into one another, but the issue of the\ncombat was still at stake.\n\nNeither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent\nthe new religion and the new goddess. Danton gave signs now and then\nof the greatest impatience, and muttered something about a new form of\ntyranny, a new kind of oppression.\n\nOn the left, Robespierre in immaculate sea-green coat and carefully\ngauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand\nagainst the palm of his left.\n\nBut nothing escaped him of what was going on. His ferocious egoism, his\nunbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself\nmight accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the National\nfete, what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom.\n\nThe matter outwardly seemed trivial enough, but already his keen and\ncalculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place\nhim--Robespierre--on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle.\n\nSurrounded by those who hated him, those who envied and those who feared\nhim, he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold-blooded\nsavagery, by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty.\n\nHe cared about nobody but himself, about nothing but his own exaltation:\nevery action of his career, since he gave up his small practice in a\nquiet provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex\nof revolutionary politics, every word he ever uttered had but one\naim--Himself.\n\nHe saw his colleagues and comrades of the old Jacobin Clubs ruthlessly\ndestroyed around him: friends he had none, and all left him indifferent;\nand now he had hundreds of enemies in every assembly and club in Paris,\nand these too one by one were being swept up in that wild whirlpool\nwhich they themselves had created.\n\nImpassive, serene, always ready with a calm answer, when passion\nraged most hotly around him, Robespierre, the most ambitious, most\nself-seeking demagogue of his time, had acquired the reputation of being\nincorruptible and selfless, an enthusiastic servant of the Republic.\n\nThe sea-green Incorruptible!\n\nAnd thus whilst others talked and argued, waxed hot over schemes for\nprocessions and pageantry, or loudly denounced the whole matter as the\nwork of a traitor, he, of the sea-green coat, sat quietly polishing his\nnails.\n\nBut he had already weighed all these discussions in the balance of his\nmind, placed them in the crucible of his ambition, and turned them into\nsomething that would benefit him and strengthen his position.\n\nAye! the feast should be brilliant enough! gay or horrible, mad or\nfearful, but through it all the people of France must be made to feel\nthat there was a guiding hand which ruled the destinies of all, a head\nwhich framed the new laws, which consolidated the new religion and\nestablished its new goddess: the Goddess of Reason.\n\nRobespierre, her prophet!\n\n\n\n\nChapter II: A Retrospect\n\n\n\nThe room was close and dark, filled with the smoke from a defective\nchimney.\n\nA tiny boudoir, once the dainty sanctum of imperious Marie Antoinette; a\nfaint and ghostly odour, like unto the perfume of spectres, seemed still\nto cling to the stained walls, and to the torn Gobelin tapestries.\n\nEverywhere lay the impress of a heavy and destroying hand: that of the\ngreat and glorious Revolution.\n\nIn the mud-soiled corners of the room a few chairs, with brocaded\ncushions rudely torn, leant broken and desolate against the walls. A\nsmall footstool, once gilt-legged and satin-covered, had been overturned\nand roughly kicked to one side, and there it lay on its back, like some\nlittle animal that had been hurt, stretching its broken limbs upwards,\npathetic to behold.\n\nFrom the delicately wrought Buhl table the silver inlay had been harshly\nstripped out of its bed of shell.\n\nAcross the Lunette, painted by Boucher and representing a chaste\nDiana surrounded by a bevy of nymphs, an uncouth hand had scribbled in\ncharcoal the device of the Revolution: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite\nou la Mort; whilst, as if to give a crowning point to the work of\ndestruction and to emphasise its motto, someone had decorated the\nportrait of Marie Antoinette with a scarlet cap, and drawn a red and\nominous line across her neck.\n\nAnd at the table two men were sitting in close and eager conclave.\n\nBetween them a solitary tallow candle, unsnuffed and weirdly flickering,\nthrew fantastic shadows upon the walls, and illumined with fitful and\nuncertain light the faces of the two men.\n\nHow different were these in character!\n\nOne, high cheek-boned, with coarse, sensuous lips, and hair elaborately\nand carefully powdered; the other pale and thin-lipped, with the keen\neyes of a ferret and a high intellectual forehead, from which the sleek\nbrown hair was smoothly brushed away.\n\nThe first of these men was Robespierre, the ruthless and incorruptible\ndemagogue; the other was Citizen Chauvelin, ex-ambassador of the\nRevolutionary Government at the English Court.\n\nThe hour was late, and the noises from the great, seething city\npreparing for sleep came to this remote little apartment in the now\ndeserted Palace of the Tuileries, merely as a faint and distant echo.\n\nIt was two days after the Fructidor Riots. Paul Deroulede and the woman\nJuliette Marny, both condemned to death, had been literally spirited\naway out of the cart which was conveying them from the Hall of Justice\nto the Luxembourg Prison, and news had just been received by the\nCommittee of Public Safety that at Lyons, the Abbe du Mesnil, with the\nci-devant Chevalier d'Egremont and the latter's wife and family, had\neffected a miraculous and wholly incomprehensible escape from the\nNorthern Prison.\n\nBut this was not all. When Arras fell into the hands of the\nRevolutionary army, and a regular cordon was formed round the town, so\nthat not a single royalist traitor might escape, some three score women\nand children, twelve priests, the old aristocrats Chermeuil, Delleville\nand Galipaux and many others, managed to pass the barriers and were\nnever recaptured.\n\nRaids were made on the suspected houses: in Paris chiefly where the\nescaped prisoners might have found refuge, or better still where their\nhelpers and rescuers might still be lurking. Foucquier Tinville, Public\nProsecutor, led and conducted these raids, assisted by that bloodthirsty\nvampire, Merlin. They heard of a house in the Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie\nwhere an Englishmen was said to have lodged for two days.\n\nThey demanded admittance, and were taken to the rooms where the\nEnglishman had stayed. These were bare and squalid, like hundreds of\nother rooms in the poorer quarters of Paris. The landlady, toothless and\ngrimy, had not yet tidied up the one where the Englishman had slept: in\nfact she did not know he had left for good.\n\nHe had paid for his room, a week in advance, and came and went as he\nliked, she explained to Citizen Tinville. She never bothered about him,\nas he never took a meal in the house, and he was only there two days.\nShe did not know her lodger was English until the day he left. She\nthought he was a Frenchman from the South, as he certainly had a\npeculiar accent when he spoke.\n\n\"It was the day of the riots,\" she continued; \"he would go out, and I\ntold him I did not think that the streets would be safe for a foreigner\nlike him: for he always wore such very fine clothes, and I made sure\nthat the starving men and women of Paris would strip them off his back\nwhen their tempers were roused. But he only laughed. He gave me a bit of\npaper and told me that if he did not return I might conclude that he had\nbeen killed, and if the Committee of Public Safety asked me questions\nabout me, I was just to show the bit of paper and there would be no\nfurther trouble.\"\n\nShe had talked volubly, more than a little terrified at Merlin's scowls,\nand the attitude of Citizen Tinville, who was known to be very severe if\nanyone committed any blunders.\n\nBut the Citizeness--her name was Brogard and her husband's brother kept\nan inn in the neighbourhood of Calais--the Citizeness Brogard had a\nclear conscience. She held a license from the Committee of Public Safety\nfor letting apartments, and she had always given due notice to the\nCommittee of the arrival and departure of her lodgers. The only thing\nwas that if any lodger paid her more than ordinarily well for the\naccommodation and he so desired it, she would send in the notice\nconveniently late, and conveniently vaguely worded as to the\ndescription, status and nationality of her more liberal patrons.\n\nThis had occurred in the case of her recent English visitor.\n\nBut she did not explain it quite like that to Citizen Foucquier Tinville\nor to Citizen Merlin.\n\nHowever, she was rather frightened, and produced the scrap of paper\nwhich the Englishman had left with her, together with the assurance that\nwhen she showed it there would be no further trouble.\n\nTinville took it roughly out of her hand, but would not glance at it.\nHe crushed it into a ball and then Merlin snatched it from him with a\ncoarse laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee and studied it for a\nmoment.\n\nThere were two lines of what looked like poetry, written in a language\nwhich Merlin did not understand. English, no doubt.\n\nBut what was perfectly clear, and easily comprehended by any one, was\nthe little drawing in the corner, done in red ink and representing a\nsmall star-shaped flower.\n\nThen Tinville and Merlin both cursed loudly and volubly, and bidding\ntheir men follow them, turned away from the house in the Rue de\nl'Ancienne Comedie and left its toothless landlady on her own doorstep\nstill volubly protesting her patriotism and her desire to serve the\ngovernment of the Republic.\n\nTinville and Merlin, however, took the scrap of paper to Citizen\nRobespierre, who smiled grimly as he in his turn crushed the offensive\nlittle document in the palm of his well-washed hands.\n\nRobespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or oaths, but he\nslipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his silver snuff box\nand then he sent a special messenger to Citizen Chauvelin in the Rue\nCorneille, bidding him come that same evening after ten o'clock to room\nNo. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the Tuileries.\n\nIt was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat opposite one\nanother in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette, and between them on\nthe table, just below the tallow-candle, was a much creased, exceedingly\ngrimy bit of paper.\n\nIt had passed through several unclean hands before Citizen Robespierre's\nimmaculately white fingers had smoothed it out and placed it before the\neyes of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.\n\nThe latter, however, was not looking at the paper, he was not even\nlooking at the pale, cruel face before him. He had closed his eyes and\nfor a moment had lost sight of the small dark room, of Robespierre's\nruthless gaze, of the mud-stained walls and greasy floor. He was seeing,\nas in a bright and sudden vision, the brilliantly-lighted salons of the\nForeign Office in London, with beautiful Marguerite Blakeney gliding\nqueenlike on the arm of the Prince of Wales.\n\nHe heard the flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, and\nabove all the din and sound of dance music, he heard an inane laugh and\nan affected voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that was even now written\non that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him:\n\n     \"We seek him here, and we seek him there,\n      Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!\n      Is he in heaven, is he in hell,\n      That demmed elusive Pimpernel?\"\n\nIt was a mere flash! One of memory's swiftly effaced pictures, when she\nshows us for the fraction of a second, indelible pictures from out our\npast. Chauvelin, in that same second, while his own eyes were closed\nand Robespierre's fixed upon him, also saw the lonely cliffs of Calais,\nheard the same voice singing: \"God save the King!\" the volley of\nmusketry, the despairing cries of Marguerite Blakeney; and once again he\nfelt the keen and bitter pang of complete humiliation and defeat.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III: Ex-Ambassador Chauvelin\n\n\n\nRobespierre had quietly waited the while. He was in no hurry: being a\nnight-bird of very pronounced tastes, he was quite ready to sit here\nuntil the small hours of the morning watching Citizen Chauvelin mentally\nwrithing in the throes of recollections of the past few months.\n\nThere was nothing that delighted the sea-green Incorruptible quite so\nmuch as the aspect of a man struggling with a hopeless situation and\nfeeling a net of intrigue drawing gradually tighter and tighter around\nhim.\n\nEven now, when he saw Chauvelin's smooth forehead wrinkled into an\nanxious frown, and his thin hand nervously clutched upon the table,\nRobespierre heaved a pleasurable sigh, leaned back in his chair, and\nsaid with an amiable smile:\n\n\"You do agree with me, then, Citizen, that the situation has become\nintolerable?\"\n\nThen as Chauvelin did not reply, he continued, speaking more sharply:\n\n\"And how terribly galling it all is, when we could have had that man\nunder the guillotine by now, if you had not blundered so terribly last\nyear.\"\n\nHis voice had become hard and trenchant like that knife to which he was\nso ready to make constant allusion. But Chauvelin still remained silent.\nThere was really nothing that he could say.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin, how you must hate that man!\" exclaimed Robespierre\nat last.\n\nThen only did Chauvelin break the silence which up to now he had\nappeared to have forced himself to keep.\n\n\"I do!\" he said with unmistakable fervour.\n\n\"Then why do you not make an effort to retrieve the blunders of last\nyear?\" queried Robespierre blandly. \"The Republic has been unusually\npatient and long-suffering with you, Citizen Chauvelin. She has taken\nyour many services and well-known patriotism into consideration. But\nyou know,\" he added significantly, \"that she has no use for worthless\ntools.\"\n\nThen as Chauvelin seemed to have relapsed into sullen silence, he\ncontinued with his original ill-omened blandness:\n\n\"Ma foi! Citizen Chauvelin, were I standing in your buckled shoes, I\nwould not lose another hour in trying to avenge mine own humiliation!\"\n\n\"Have I ever had a chance?\" burst out Chauvelin with ill-suppressed\nvehemence. \"What can I do single-handed? Since war has been declared\nI cannot go to England unless the Government will find some official\nreason for my doing so. There is much grumbling and wrath over here, and\nwhen that damned Scarlet Pimpernel League has been at work, when a score\nor so of valuable prizes have been snatched from under the very knife\nof the guillotine, then, there is much gnashing of teeth and useless\ncursings, but nothing serious or definite is done to smother those\naccursed English flies which come buzzing about our ears.\"\n\n\"Nay! you forget, Citizen Chauvelin,\" retorted Robespierre, \"that we of\nthe Committee of Public Safety are far more helpless than you. You\nknow the language of these people, we don't. You know their manners and\ncustoms, their ways of thought, the methods they are likely to employ:\nwe know none of these things. You have seen and spoken to men in England\nwho are members of that damned League. You have seen the man who is its\nleader. We have not.\"\n\nHe leant forward on the table and looked more searchingly at the thin,\npallid face before him.\n\n\"If you named that leader to me now, if you described him, we could\ngo to work more easily. You could name him, and you would, Citizen\nChauvelin.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" retorted Chauvelin doggedly.\n\n\"Ah! but I think you could. But there! I do not blame your silence. You\nwould wish to reap the reward of your own victory, to be the instrument\nof your own revenge. Passions! I think it natural! But in the name of\nyour own safety, Citizen, do not be too greedy with your secret. If the\nman is known to you, find him again, find him, lure him to France! We\nwant him--the people want him! And if the people do not get what they\nwant, they will turn on those who have withheld their prey.\"\n\n\"I understand, Citizen, that your own safety and that of your government\nis involved in this renewed attempt to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel,\"\nretorted Chauvelin drily.\n\n\"And your head, Citizen Chauvelin,\" concluded Robespierre.\n\n\"Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, and you will,\nCitizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The question is,\nif I am to lure that man to France what will you and your government do\nto help me?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" replied Robespierre, \"provided you have a definite plan\nand a definite purpose.\n\n\"I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a semi-official\ncapacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in disguise in out-of-the-way\ncorners.\"\n\n\"That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British\nauthorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects\nsettled in England. After a good deal of correspondence they have\nsuggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look\nafter the interests of our own people commercially and financially.\nWe can easily send you over in that capacity if it would suit your\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as well as\nanother.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know that I\nam fully trusted. Above all, I must have power--decisive, absolute,\nillimitable power.\"\n\nThere was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad man, who\nlooked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the face and brought a\nfirm fist resolutely down upon the table before him. Robespierre paused\na while ere he replied; he was eying the other man keenly, trying to\nread if behind that earnest, frowning brow there did not lurk some\nselfish, ulterior motive along with that demand for absolute power.\n\nBut Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make every\ncheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that slight moment\nof hesitation Robespierre said quietly:\n\n\"You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in every town\nor borough of France which you may visit. The Revolutionary Government\nshall create you, before you start for England, Supreme Head of all the\nSub-Committees of Public Safety. This will mean that in the name of the\nsafety of the Republic every order given by you, of whatsoever nature\nit might be, must be obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for\ntreason.\"\n\nChauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction, which he\ndid not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.\n\n\"I shall want agents,\" he said, \"or shall we say spies? and, of course,\nmoney.\"\n\n\"You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in\nEngland and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much\ndissatisfaction in their Midland counties--you remember the Birmingham\nriots? They were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then you know\nCandeille, the actress? She had found her way among some of those\ncircles in London who have what they call liberal tendencies. I believe\nthey are called Whigs. Funny name, isn't it? It means perruque, I think.\nCandeille has given charity performances in aid of our Paris poor,\nin one or two of these Whig clubs, and incidentally she has been very\nuseful to us.\"\n\n\"A woman is always useful in such cases. I shall seek out the Citizeness\nCandeille.\"\n\n\"And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer her\nwhat should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!\" he added,\ncontemplating with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on his\nfinger-nails. \"There is a vacancy in the Maison Moliere. Or--what might\nprove more attractive still--in connection with the proposed National\nfete, and the new religion for the people, we have not yet chosen\na Goddess of Reason. That should appeal to any feminine mind. The\nimpersonation of a goddess, with processions, pageants, and the rest...\nGreat importance and prominence given to one personality.... What\nsay you, Citizen? If you really have need of a woman for the furtherance\nof your plans, you have that at your disposal which may enhance her\nzeal.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin calmly. \"I always entertained\na hope that some day the Revolutionary Government would call again on\nmy services. I admit that I failed last year. The Englishman is\nresourceful. He has wits and he is very rich. He would not have\nsucceeded, I think, but for his money--and corruption and bribery are\nrife in Paris and on our coasts. He slipped through my fingers at the\nvery moment when I thought that I held him most securely. I do admit all\nthat, but I am prepared to redeem my failure of last year, and... there\nis nothing more to discuss.--I am ready to start.\"\n\nHe looked round for his cloak and hat, and quietly readjusted the set\nof his neck-tie. But Robespierre detained him a while longer: that\nborn mountebank, born torturer of the souls of men, had not gloated\nsufficiently yet on the agony of mind of this fellow-man.\n\nChauvelin had always been trusted and respected. His services in\nconnection with the foreign affairs of the Revolutionary Government had\nbeen invaluable, both before and since the beginning of the European\nWar. At one time he formed part of that merciless decemvirate\nwhich--with Robespierre at its head--meant to govern France by laws of\nbloodshed and of unparalleled ferocity.\n\nBut the sea-green Incorruptible had since tired of him, then had\nendeavoured to push him on one side, for Chauvelin was keen and clever,\nand, moreover, he possessed all those qualities of selfless patriotism\nwhich were so conspicuously lacking in Robespierre.\n\nHis failure in bringing that interfering Scarlet Pimpernel to justice\nand the guillotine had completed Chauvelin's downfall. Though not\notherwise molested, he had been left to moulder in obscurity during this\npast year. He would soon enough have been completely forgotten.\n\nNow he was not only to be given one more chance to regain public favour,\nbut he had demanded powers which in consideration of the aim in\nview, Robespierre himself could not refuse to grant him. But the\nIncorruptible, ever envious and jealous, would not allow him to exult\ntoo soon.\n\nWith characteristic blandness he seemed to be entering into all\nChauvelin's schemes, to be helping in every way he could, for there\nwas something at the back of his mind which he meant to say to the\nex-ambassador, before the latter took his leave: something which\nwould show him that he was but on trial once again, and which would\ndemonstrate to him with perfect clearness that over him there hovered\nthe all-powerful hand of a master.\n\n\"You have but to name the sum you want, Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the\nIncorruptible, with an encouraging smile, \"the government will not stint\nyou, and you shall not fail for lack of authority or for lack of funds.\"\n\n\"It is pleasant to hear that the government has such uncounted wealth,\"\nremarked Chauvelin with dry sarcasm.\n\n\"Oh! the last few weeks have been very profitable,\" retorted\nRobespierre; \"we have confiscated money and jewels from emigrant\nroyalists to the tune of several million francs. You remember the\ntraitor Juliette Marny, who escape to England lately? Well! her mother's\njewels and quite a good deal of gold were discovered by one of our most\nable spies to be under the care of a certain Abbe Foucquet, a calotin\nfrom Boulogne--devoted to the family, so it seems.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" queried Chauvelin indifferently.\n\n\"Our men seized the jewels and gold, that is all. We don't know yet what\nwe mean to do with the priest. The fisherfolk of Boulogne like him, and\nwe can lay our hands on him at any time, if we want his old head for\nthe guillotine. But the jewels were worth having. There's a historic\nnecklace worth half a million at least.\"\n\n\"Could I have it?\" asked Chauvelin.\n\nRobespierre laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You said it belonged to the Marny family,\" continued the ex-ambassador.\n\"Juliette Marny is in England. I might meet her. I cannot tell what may\nhappen: but I feel that the historic necklace might prove useful. Just\nas you please,\" he added with renewed indifference. \"It was a thought\nthat flashed through my mind when you spoke--nothing more.\"\n\n\"And to show you how thoroughly the government trusts you, Citizen\nChauvelin,\" replied Robespierre with perfect urbanity, \"I will myself\ndirect that the Marny necklace be placed unreservedly in your hands; and\na sum of fifty thousand francs for your expenses in England. You see,\"\nhe added blandly, \"we give you no excuse for a second failure.\"\n\n\"I need none,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, as he finally rose from his\nseat, with a sigh of satisfaction that this interview was ended at last.\n\nBut Robespierre too had risen, and pushing his chair aside he took\na step or two towards Chauvelin. He was a much taller man than the\nex-ambassador. Spare and gaunt, he had a very upright bearing, and\nin the uncertain light of the candle he seemed to tower strangely\nand weirdly above the other man: the pale hue of his coat, his\nlight-coloured hair, the whiteness of his linen, all helped to give to\nhis appearance at that moment a curious spectral effect.\n\nChauvelin somehow felt an unpleasant shiver running down his spine as\nRobespierre, perfectly urbane and gentle in his manner, placed a long,\nbony hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the Incorruptible, with some degree of\ndignified solemnity, \"meseems that we very quickly understood one\nanother this evening. Your own conscience, no doubt, gave you a\npremonition of what the purport of my summons to you would be. You say\nthat you always hoped the Revolutionary Government would give you one\ngreat chance to redeem your failure of last year. I, for one, always\nintended that you should have that chance, for I saw, perhaps, just\na little deeper into your heart than my colleagues. I saw not only\nenthusiasm for the cause of the People of France, not only abhorrence\nfor the enemy of your country, I saw a purely personal and deadly hate\nof an individual man--the unknown and mysterious Englishman who proved\ntoo clever for you last year. And because I believe that hatred will\nprove sharper and more far-seeing than selfless patriotism, therefore I\nurged the Committee of Public Safety to allow you to work out your own\nrevenge, and thereby to serve your country more effectually than any\nother--perhaps more pure-minded patriot would do. You go to England\nwell-provided with all that is necessary for the success of your plans,\nfor the accomplishment of your own personal vengeance. The Revolutionary\nGovernment will help you with money, passports, safe conducts; it\nplaces its spies and agents at your disposal. It gives you practically\nunlimited power, wherever you may go. It will not enquire into your\nmotives, nor yet your means, so long as these lead to success. But\nprivate vengeance or patriotism, whatever may actuate you, we here in\nFrance demand you deliver into our hands the man who is known in two\ncountries as the Scarlet Pimpernel! We want him alive if possible,\nor dead if it must be so, and we want as many of his henchmen as will\nfollow him to the guillotine. Get them to France, and we'll know how to\ndeal with them, and let the whole of Europe be damned.\"\n\nHe paused for a while, his hand still resting on Chauvelin's shoulder,\nhis pale green eyes holding those of the other man as if in a trance.\nBut Chauvelin neither stirred nor spoke. His triumph left him quite\ncalm; his fertile brain was already busy with his plans. There was no\nroom for fear in his heart, and it was without the slightest tremor that\nhe waited for the conclusion of Robespierre's oration.\n\n\"Perhaps, Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the latter at last, \"you have already\nguessed what there is left for me to say. But lest there should remain\nin your mind one faint glimmer of doubt or of hope, let me tell you\nthis. The Revolutionary Government gives you this chance of redeeming\nyour failure, but this one only; if you fail again, your outraged\ncountry will know neither pardon nor mercy. Whether you return to France\nor remain in England, whether you travel North, South, East or West,\ncross the Oceans, or traverse the Alps, the hand of an avenging People\nwill be upon you. Your second failure will be punished by death,\nwherever you may be, either by the guillotine, if you are in France, or\nif you seek refuge elsewhere, then by the hand of an assassin.\n\n\"Look to it, Citizen Chauvelin! for there will be no escape this time,\nnot even if the mightiest tyrant on earth tried to protect you, not even\nif you succeeded in building up an empire and placing yourself upon a\nthrone.\"\n\nHis thin, strident voice echoed weirdly in the small, close boudoir.\nChauvelin made no reply. There was nothing that he could say. All that\nRobespierre had put so emphatically before him, he had fully realised,\neven whilst he was forming his most daring plans.\n\nIt was an \"either--or\" this time, uttered to HIM now. He thought again\nof Marguerite Blakeney, and the terrible alternative he had put before\nHER less than a year ago.\n\nWell! he was prepared to take the risk. He would not fail again. He was\ngoing to England under more favourable conditions this time. He knew who\nthe man was, whom he was bidden to lure to France and to death.\n\nAnd he returned Robespierre's threatening gaze boldly and unflinchingly;\nthen he prepared to go. He took up his hat and cloak, opened the door\nand peered for a moment into the dark corridor, wherein, in the far\ndistance, the steps of a solitary sentinel could be faintly heard: he\nput on his hat, turned to look once more into the room where Robespierre\nstood quietly watching him, and went his way.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV: The Richmond Gala\n\n\n\nIt was perhaps the most brilliant September ever known in England, where\nthe last days of dying summer are nearly always golden and beautiful.\n\nStrange that in this country, where that same season is so peculiarly\nradiant with a glory all its own, there should be no special expression\nin the language with which to accurately name it.\n\nSo we needs must call it \"fin d'ete\": the ending of the summer; not the\nabsolute end, nor yet the ultimate departure, but the tender lingering\nof a friend obliged to leave us anon, yet who fain would steal a day\nhere and there, a week or so in which to stay with us: who would make\nthat last pathetic farewell of his endure a little while longer still,\nand brings forth in gorgeous array for our final gaze all that he has\nwhich is most luxuriant, most desirable, most worthy of regret.\n\nAnd in this year of grace 1793, departing summer had lavished the\ntreasures of her palette upon woodland and river banks; had tinged the\nonce crude green of larch and elm with a tender hue of gold, had brushed\nthe oaks with tones of warm russet, and put patches of sienna and\ncrimson on the beech.\n\nIn the gardens the roses were still in bloom, not the delicate blush\nor lemon ones of June, nor yet the pale Banksias and climbers, but the\nfull-blooded red roses of late summer, and deep-coloured apricot ones,\nwith crinkled outside leaves faintly kissed by the frosty dew. In\nsheltered spots the purple clematis still lingered, whilst the dahlias,\nbrilliant of hue, seemed overbearing in their gorgeous insolence,\nflaunting their crudely colored petals against sober backgrounds of\nmellow leaves, or the dull, mossy tones of ancient, encircling walls.\n\nThe Gala had always been held about the end of September. The weather,\non the riverside, was most dependable then, and there was always\nsufficient sunshine as an excuse for bringing out Madam's last new\nmuslin gown, or her pale-coloured quilted petticoat. Then the ground\nwas dry and hard, good alike for walking and for setting up tents and\nbooths. And of these there was of a truth a most goodly array this year:\nmountebanks and jugglers from every corner of the world, so it seemed,\nfor there was a man with a face as black as my lord's tricorne, and\nanother with such flat yellow cheeks as made one think of batter\npudding, and spring aconite, of eggs and other very yellow things.\n\nThere was a tent wherein dogs--all sorts of dogs, big, little, black,\nwhite or tan--did things which no Christian with respect for his own\nbackbone would have dared to perform, and another where a weird-faced\nold man made bean-stalks and walking sticks, coins of the realm and lace\nkerchiefs vanish into thin air.\n\nAnd as it was nice and hot one could sit out upon the green and listen\nto the strains of the band, which discoursed sweet music, and watch the\nyoung people tread a measure on the sward.\n\nThe quality had not yet arrived: for humbler folk had partaken of very\nearly dinner so as to get plenty of fun, and long hours of delight for\nthe sixpenny toll demanded at the gates.\n\nThere was so much to see and so much to do: games of bowls on the\ngreen, and a beautiful Aunt Sally, there was a skittle alley, and two\nmerry-go-rounds: there were performing monkeys and dancing bears, a\nwoman so fat that three men with arms outstretched could not get round\nher, and a man so thin that he could put a lady's bracelet round his\nneck and her garter around his waist.\n\nThere were some funny little dwarfs with pinched faces and a knowing\nmanner, and a giant come all the way from Russia--so 'twas said.\n\nThe mechanical toys too were a great attraction. You dropped a penny\ninto a little slit in a box and a doll would begin to dance and play the\nfiddle: and there was the Magic Mill, where for another modest copper\na row of tiny figures, wrinkled and old and dressed in the shabbiest of\nrags, marched in weary procession up a flight of steps into the Mill,\nonly to emerge again the next moment at a further door of this wonderful\nbuilding looking young and gay, dressed in gorgeous finery and tripping\na dance measure as they descended some steps and were finally lost to\nview.\n\nBut what was most wonderful of all and collected the goodliest crowd of\ngazers and the largest amount of coins, was a miniature representation\nof what was going on in France even at this very moment.\n\nAnd you could not help but be convinced of the truth of it all, so\ncleverly was it done. There was a background of houses and a very\nred-looking sky. \"Too red!\" some people said, but were immediately\nquashed by the dictum of the wise, that the sky represented a sunset, as\nanyone who looked could see. Then there were a number of little figures,\nno taller than your hand, but with little wooden faces and arms and\nlegs, just beautifully made little dolls, and these were dressed in\nkirtles and breeches--all rags mostly--and little coats and wooden\nshoes. They were massed together in groups with their arms all turned\nupwards.\n\nAnd in the center of this little stage on an elevated platform there\nwere miniature wooden posts close together, and with a long flat board\nat right angles at the foot of the posts, and all painted a bright red.\nAt the further end of the boards was a miniature basket, and between the\ntwo posts, at the top, was a miniature knife which ran up and down in a\ngroove and was drawn by a miniature pulley. Folk who knew said that this\nwas a model of a guillotine.\n\nAnd lo and behold! when you dropped a penny into a slot just below the\nwooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving their arms up\nand down, and another little doll would ascend the elevated platform and\nlie down on the red board at the foot of the wooden posts. Then a figure\ndressed in brilliant scarlet put out an arm presumably to touch the\npulley, and the tiny knife would rattle down on to the poor little\nreclining doll's neck, and its head would roll off into the basket\nbeyond.\n\nThen there was a loud whirr of wheels, a buzz of internal mechanism, and\nall the little figures would stop dead with arms outstretched, whilst\nthe beheaded doll rolled off the board and was lost to view, no doubt\npreparatory to going through the same gruesome pantomime again.\n\nIt was very thrilling, and very terrible: a certain air of hushed awe\nreigned in the booth where this mechanical wonder was displayed.\n\nThe booth itself stood in a secluded portion of the grounds, far from\nthe toll gates, and the band stand and the noise of the merry-go-round,\nand there were great texts, written in red letters on a black ground,\npinned all along the walls.\n\n\"Please spare a copper for the starving poor of Paris.\"\n\nA lady, dressed in grey quilted petticoat and pretty grey and black\nstriped paniers, could be seen walking in the booth from time to time,\nthen disappearing through a partition beyond. She would emerge again\npresently carrying an embroidered reticule, and would wander round among\nthe crowd, holding out the bag by its chain, and repeating in tones\nof somewhat monotonous appeal: \"For the starving poor of Paris, if you\nplease!\"\n\nShe had fine, dark eyes, rather narrow and tending upwards at the outer\ncorners, which gave her face a not altogether pleasant expression.\nStill, they were fine eyes, and when she went round soliciting alms,\nmost of the men put a hand into their breeches pocket and dropped a coin\ninto her embroidered reticule.\n\nShe said the word \"poor\" in rather a funny way, rolling the \"r\" at the\nend, and she also said \"please\" as if it were spelt with a long line of\n\"e's,\" and so it was concluded that she was French and was begging for\nher poorer sisters. At stated intervals during the day, the mechanical\ntoy was rolled into a corner, and the lady in grey stood up on a\nplatform and sang queer little songs, the words of which nobody could\nunderstand.\n\n\"Il etait une bergere et ron et petit pataplon....\"\n\nBut it all left an impression of sadness and of suppressed awe upon the\nminds and susceptibilities of the worthy Richmond yokels come with\ntheir wives or sweethearts to enjoy the fun of the fair, and gladly\ndid everyone emerge out of that melancholy booth into the sunshine, the\nbrightness and the noise.\n\n\"Lud! but she do give me the creeps,\" said Mistress Polly, the pretty\nbarmaid from the Bell Inn, down by the river. \"And I must say that I\ndon't see why we English folk should send our hard-earned pennies to\nthose murdering ruffians over the water. Bein' starving so to speak,\ndon't make a murderer a better man if he goes on murdering,\" she added\nwith undisputable if ungrammatical logic. \"Come, let's look at something\nmore cheerful now.\"\n\nAnd without waiting for anyone else's assent, she turned towards the\nmore lively portion of the grounds, closely followed by a ruddy-faced,\nsomewhat sheepish-looking youth, who very obviously was her attendant\nswain.\n\nIt was getting on for three o-clock now, and the quality were beginning\nto arrive. Lord Anthony Dewhurst was already there, chucking every\npretty girl under the chin, to the annoyance of her beau. Ladies were\narriving all the time, and the humbler feminine hearts were constantly\nset a-flutter at sight of rich brocaded gowns, and the new Charlottes,\nall crinkled velvet and soft marabout, which were so becoming to the\npretty faces beneath.\n\nThere was incessant and loud talking and chattering, with here and there\nthe shriller tones of a French voice being distinctly noticeable in the\ndin. There were a good many French ladies and gentlemen present, easily\nrecognisable, even in the distance, for their clothes were of more sober\nhue and of lesser richness than those of their English compeers.\n\nBut they were great lords and ladies, nevertheless, Dukes and Duchesses\nand Countesses, come to England for fear of being murdered by those\ndevils in their own country. Richmond was full of them just now, as they\nwere made right welcome both at the Palace and at the magnificent home\nof Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney.\n\nAh! here comes Sir Andrew Ffoulkes with his lady! so pretty and\ndainty does she look, like a little china doll, in her new-fashioned\nshort-waisted gown: her brown hair in soft waves above her smooth\nforehead, her great, hazel eyes fixed in unaffected admiration on the\ngallant husband by her side.\n\n\"No wonder she dotes on him!\" sighed pretty Mistress Polly after she had\nbobbed her curtsy to my lady. \"The brave deeds he did for love of her!\nRescued her from those murderers over in France and brought her to\nEngland safe and sound, having fought no end of them single-handed, so\nI've beard it said. Have you not, Master Thomas Jezzard?\"\n\nAnd she looked defiantly at her meek-looking cavalier.\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Master Thomas with quite unusual vehemence in response to\nthe disparaging look in her brown eyes, \"'Tis not he who did it all,\nas you well know, Mistress Polly. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes is a gallant\ngentleman, you may take your Bible oath on that, but he that fights\nthe murdering frogeaters single-handed is he whom they call The Scarlet\nPimpernel: the bravest gentleman in all the world.\"\n\nThen, as at mention of the national hero, he thought that he detected in\nMistress Polly's eyes an enthusiasm which he could not very well ascribe\nto his own individuality, he added with some pique:\n\n\"But they do say that this same Scarlet Pimpernel is mightily\nill-favoured, and that's why no one ever sees him. They say he is fit to\nscare the crows away and that no Frenchy can look twice at his face, for\nit's so ugly, and so they let him get out of the country, rather than\nlook at him again.\"\n\n\"Then they do say a mighty lot of nonsense,\" retorted Mistress Polly,\nwith a shrug of her pretty shoulders, \"and if that be so, then why don't\nyou go over to France and join hands with the Scarlet Pimpernel? I'll\nwarrant no Frenchman'll want to look twice at your face.\"\n\nA chorus of laughter greeted this sally, for the two young people had\nin the meanwhile been joined by several of their friends, and now formed\npart of a merry group near the band, some sitting, others standing, but\nall bent on seeing as much as there was to see in Richmond Gala this\nday. There was Johnny Cullen, the grocer's apprentice from Twickenham,\nand Ursula Quekett, the baker's daughter, and several \"young 'uns\" from\nthe neighbourhood, as well as some older folk.\n\nAnd all of them enjoyed a joke when they heard one and thought Mistress\nPolly's retort mightily smart. But then Mistress Polly was possessed of\ntwo hundred pounds, all her own, left to her by her grandmother, and\non the strength of this extensive fortune had acquired a reputation for\nbeauty and wit not easily accorded to a wench that had been penniless.\n\nBut Mistress Polly was also very kind-hearted. She loved to tease Master\nJezzard, who was an indefatigable hanger-on at her pretty skirts, and\nwhose easy conquest had rendered her somewhat contemptuous, but at the\nlook of perplexed annoyance and bewildered distress in the lad's face,\nher better nature soon got the upper hand. She realized that her remark\nhad been unwarrantably spiteful, and wishing to make atonement, she\nsaid with a touch of coquetry which quickly spread balm over the honest\nyokel's injured vanity:\n\n\"La! Master Jezzard, you do seem to make a body say some queer things.\nBut there! you must own 'tis mighty funny about that Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\nshe added, appealing to the company in general, just as if Master\nJezzard had been disputing the fact. \"Why won't he let anyone see who he\nis? And those who know him won't tell. Now I have it for a fact from\nmy lady's own maid Lucy, that the young lady as is stopping at Lady\nBlakeney's house has actually spoken to the man. She came over from\nFrance, come a fortnight to-morrow; she and the gentleman they call\nMossoo Deroulede. They both saw the Scarlet Pimpernel and spoke to him.\nHe brought them over from France. Then why won't they say?\"\n\n\"Say what?\" commented Johnny Cullen, the apprentice.\n\n\"Who this mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel is.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he isn't,\" said old Clutterbuck, who was clerk of the vestry at\nthe church of St. John's the Evangelist.\n\n\"Yes!\" he added sententiously, for he was fond of his own sayings and\nusually liked to repeat them before he had quite done with them, \"that's\nit, you may be sure. Perhaps he isn't.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Master Clutterbuck?\" asked Ursula Quekett, for she\nknew the old man liked to explain his wise saws, and as she wanted to\nmarry his son, she indulged him whenever she could. \"What do you mean?\nHe isn't what?\"\n\n\"He isn't. That's all,\" explained Clutterbuck with vague solemnity.\n\nThen seeing that he had gained the attention of the little party round\nhim, he condescended to come to more logical phraseology.\n\n\"I mean, that perhaps we must not ask, 'who IS this mysterious Scarlet\nPimpernel?' but 'who WAS that poor and unfortunate gentleman?'\"\n\n\"Then you think...\" suggested Mistress Polly, who felt unaccountably\nlow-spirited at this oratorical pronouncement.\n\n\"I have it for a fact,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck solemnly, \"that he whom\nthey call the Scarlet Pimpernel no longer exists now: that he was\ncollared by the Frenchies, as far back as last fall, and in the language\nof the poets, has never been heard of no more.\"\n\nMr. Clutterbuck was very fond of quoting from the works of certain\nwriters whose names he never mentioned, but who went by the poetical\ngenerality of \"the poets.\" Whenever he made use of phrases which he was\nsupposed to derive from these great and unnamed authors, he solemnly\nand mechanically raised his hat, as a tribute of respect to these giant\nminds.\n\n\"You think that The Scarlet Pimpernel is dead, Mr. Clutterbuck? That\nthose horrible Frenchies murdered him? Surely you don't mean that?\"\nsighed Mistress Polly ruefully.\n\nMr. Clutterbuck put his hand up to his hat, preparatory no doubt to\nmaking another appeal to the mysterious poets, but was interrupted in\nthe very act of uttering great thoughts by a loud and prolonged laugh\nwhich came echoing from a distant corner of the grounds.\n\n\"Lud! but I'd know that laugh anywhere,\" said Mistress Quekett, whilst\nall eyes were turned in the direction whence the merry noise had come.\n\nHalf a head taller than any of his friends around him, his lazy blue\neyes scanning from beneath their drooping lids the motley throng around\nhim, stood Sir Percy Blakeney, the centre of a gaily-dressed little\ngroup which seemingly had just crossed the toll-gate.\n\n\"A fine specimen of a man, for sure,\" remarked Johnnie Cullen, the\napprentice.\n\n\"Aye! you may take your Bible oath on that!\" sighed Mistress Polly, who\nwas inclined to be sentimental.\n\n\"Speakin' as the poets,\" pronounced Mr. Clutterbuck sententiously,\n\"inches don't make a man.\"\n\n\"Nor fine clothes neither,\" added Master Jezzard, who did not approve of\nMistress Polly's sentimental sigh.\n\n\"There's my lady!\" gasped Miss Barbara suddenly, clutching Master\nClutterbuck's arm vigorously. \"Lud! but she is beautiful to-day!\"\n\nBeautiful indeed, and radiant with youth and happiness, Marguerite\nBlakeney had just gone through the gates and was walking along the sward\ntowards the band stand. She was dressed in clinging robes of shimmery\ngreen texture, the new-fashioned high-waisted effect suiting her\ngraceful figure to perfection. The large Charlotte, made of velvet to\nmatch the gown, cast a deep shadow over the upper part of her face, and\ngave a peculiar softness to the outline of her forehead and cheeks.\n\nLong lace mittens covered her arms and hands and a scarf of diaphanous\nmaterial edged with dull gold hung loosely around her shoulders.\n\nYes! she was beautiful! No captious chronicler has ever denied that! and\nno one who knew her before, and who saw her again on this late summer's\nafternoon, could fail to mark the additional charm of her magnetic\npersonality. There was a tenderness in her face as she turned her head\nto and fro, a joy of living in her eyes that was quite irresistibly\nfascinating.\n\nJust now she was talking animatedly with the young girl who was walking\nbeside her, and laughing merrily the while:\n\n\"Nay! we'll find your Paul, never fear! Lud! child, have you forgotten\nhe is in England now, and that there's no fear of his being kidnapped\nhere on the green in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe young girl gave a slight shudder and her child-like face became a\nshade paler than before. Marguerite took her hand and gave it a kindly\npressure. Juliette Marny, but lately come to England, saved from under\nthe very knife of the guillotine, by a timely and daring rescue, could\nscarcely believe as yet that she and the man she loved were really out\nof danger.\n\n\"There is Monsieur Deroulede,\" said Marguerite after a slight pause,\ngiving the young girl time to recover herself and pointing to a group of\nmen close by. \"He is among friends, as you see.\"\n\nThey made such a pretty picture, these two women, as they stood together\nfor a moment on the green with the brilliant September sun throwing\ngolden reflections and luminous shadows on their slender forms.\nMarguerite, tall and queen-like in her rich gown, and costly jewels,\nwearing with glorious pride the invisible crown of happy wifehood:\nJuliette, slim and girlish, dressed all in white, with a soft, straw\nhat on her fair curls, and bearing on an otherwise young and child-like\nface, the hard imprint of the terrible sufferings she had undergone, of\nthe deathly moral battle her tender soul had had to fight.\n\nSoon a group of friends joined them. Paul Deroulede among these, also\nSir Andrew and Lady Ffoulkes, and strolling slowly towards them, his\nhands buried in the pockets of his fine cloth breeches, his broad\nshoulders set to advantage in a coat of immaculate cut, priceless lace\nruffles at neck and wrist, came the inimitable Sir Percy.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V: Sir Percy and His Lady\n\n\n\nTo all appearances he had not changed since those early days of\nmatrimony, when his young wife dazzled London society by her wit and by\nher beauty, and he was one of the many satellites that helped to bring\ninto bold relief the brilliance of her presence, of her sallies and of\nher smiles.\n\nHis friends alone, mayhap--and of these only an intimate few--had\nunderstood that beneath that self-same lazy manner, those shy and\nawkward ways, that half-inane, half-cynical laugh, there now lurked an\nundercurrent of tender and passionate happiness.\n\nThat Lady Blakeney was in love with her own husband, nobody could fail\nto see, and in the more frivolous cliques of fashionable London this\nextraordinary phenomenon had oft been eagerly discussed.\n\n\"A monstrous thing, of a truth, for a woman of fashion to adore her own\nhusband!\" was the universal pronouncement of the gaily-decked little\nworld that centred around Carlton House and Ranelagh.\n\nNot that Sir Percy Blakeney was unpopular with the fair sex. Far be it\nfrom the veracious chronicler's mind even to suggest such a thing. The\nladies would have voted any gathering dull if Sir Percy's witty sallies\ndid not ring from end to end of the dancing hall, if his new satin coat\nand 'broidered waistcoat did not call for comment or admiration.\n\nBut that was the frivolous set, to which Lady Blakeney had never\nbelonged.\n\nIt was well known that she had always viewed her good-natured husband\nas the most willing and most natural butt for her caustic wit; she still\nwas fond of aiming a shaft or two at him, and he was still equally ready\nto let the shaft glance harmlessly against the flawless shield of his\nown imperturbable good humour, but now, contrary to all precedent, to\nall usages and customs of London society, Marguerite seldom was seen at\nrouts or at the opera without her husband; she accompanied him to all\nthe races, and even one night--oh horror!--had danced the gavotte with\nhim.\n\nSociety shuddered and wondered! tried to put Lady Blakeney's sudden\ninfatuation down to foreign eccentricity, and finally consoled itself\nwith the thought that after all this nonsense could not last, and that\nshe was too clever a woman and he too perfect a gentleman to keep up\nthis abnormal state of things for any length of time.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the ladies averred that this matrimonial love was a\nvery one-sided affair. No one could assert that Sir Percy was anything\nbut politely indifferent to his wife's obvious attentions. His lazy eyes\nnever once lighted up when she entered a ball-room, and there were those\nwho knew for a fact that her ladyship spent many lonely days in her\nbeautiful home at Richmond whilst her lord and master absented himself\nwith persistent if unchivalrous regularity.\n\nHis presence at the Gala had been a surprise to everyone, for all\nthought him still away, fishing in Scotland or shooting in Yorkshire,\nanywhere save close to the apron strings of his doting wife. He himself\nseemed conscious of the fact that he had not been expected at this\nend-of-summer fete, for as he strolled forward to meet his wife and\nJuliette Marny, and acknowledge with a bow here and a nod there the many\ngreetings from subordinates and friends, there was quite an apologetic\nair about his good-looking face, and an obvious shyness in his smile.\n\nBut Marguerite gave a happy little laugh when she saw him coming towards\nher.\n\n\"Oh, Sir Percy!\" she said gaily, \"and pray have you seen the show? I vow\n'tis the maddest, merriest throng I've seen for many a day. Nay! but for\nthe sighs and shudders of my poor little Juliette, I should be enjoying\none of the liveliest days of my life.\"\n\nShe patted Juliette's arm affectionately.\n\n\"Do not shame me before Sir Percy,\" murmured the young girl, casting shy\nglances at the elegant cavalier before her, vainly trying to find in the\nindolent, foppish personality of this society butterfly, some trace of\nthe daring man of action, the bold adventurer who had snatched her and\nher lover from out the very tumbril that bore them both to death.\n\n\"I know I ought to be gay,\" she continued with an attempt at a smile, \"I\nought to forget everything, save what I owe to...\"\n\nSir Percy's laugh broke in on her half-finished sentence.\n\n\"Lud! and to think of all that I ought not to forget!\" he said loudly.\n\"Tony here has been clamouring for iced punch this last half-hour, and I\npromised to find a booth wherein the noble liquid is properly dispensed.\nWithin half an hour from now His Royal Highness will be here. I assure\nyou, Mlle. Juliette, that from that time onwards I have to endure the\nqualms of the damned, for the heir to Great Britain's throne always\ncontrives to be thirsty when I am satiated, which is Tantalus' torture\nmagnified a thousandfold, or to be satiated when my parched palate most\nrequires solace; in either case I am a most pitiable man.\"\n\n\"In either case you contrive to talk a deal of nonsense, Sir Percy,\"\nsaid Marguerite gaily.\n\n\"What else would your ladyship have me do this lazy, hot afternoon?\"\n\n\"Come and view the booths with me,\" she said. \"I am dying for a sight of\nthe fat woman and the lean man, the pig-faced child, the dwarfs and\nthe giants. There! Monsieur Deroulede,\" she added, turning to the young\nFrenchman who was standing close beside her, \"take Mlle. Juliette to\nhear the clavecin players. I vow she is tired of my company.\"\n\nThe gaily-dressed group was breaking up. Juliette and Paul Deroulede\nwere only too ready to stroll off arm-in-arm together, and Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes was ever in attendance on his young wife.\n\nFor one moment Marguerite caught her husband's eye. No one was within\nearshot.\n\n\"Percy,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, m'dear.\"\n\n\"When did you return?\"\n\n\"Early this morning.\"\n\n\"You crossed over from Calais?\"\n\n\"From Boulogne.\"\n\n\"Why did you not let me know sooner?\"\n\n\"I could not, dear. I arrived at my lodgings in town, looking a\ndisgusting object.... I could not appear before you until I had washed\nsome of the French mud from off my person. Then His Royal Highness\ndemanded my presence. He wanted news of the Duchesse de Verneuil, whom I\nhad the honour of escorting over from France. By the time I had told him\nall that he wished to hear, there was no chance of finding you at home,\nand I thought I should see you here.\"\n\nMarguerite said nothing for a moment, but her foot impatiently tapped\nthe ground, and her fingers were fidgeting with the gold fringe of her\nscarf. The look of joy, of exquisite happiness, seemed to have suddenly\nvanished from her face; there was a deep furrow between her brows.\n\nShe sighed a short, sharp sigh, and cast a rapid upward glance at her\nhusband.\n\nHe was looking down at her, smiling good-naturedly, a trifle\nsarcastically perhaps, and the frown on her face deepened.\n\n\"Percy,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"Yes, m'dear.\"\n\n\"These anxieties are terrible to bear. You have been twice over to\nFrance within the last month, dealing with your life as lightly as if\nit did not now belong to me. When will you give up these mad adventures,\nand leave others to fight their own battles and to save their own lives\nas best they may?\"\n\nShe had spoken with increased vehemence, although her voice was scarce\nraised above a whisper. Even in her sudden, passionate anger she was on\nher guard not to betray his secret. He did not reply immediately, but\nseemed to be studying the beautiful face on which heartbroken anxiety\nwas now distinctly imprinted.\n\nThen he turned and looked at the solitary booth in the distance, across\nthe frontal of which a large placard had been recently affixed, bearing\nthe words: \"Come and see the true representation of the guillotine!\"\n\nIn front of the booth a man dressed in ragged breeches, with Phrygian\ncap on his head, adorned with a tri-colour cockade, was vigorously\nbeating a drum, shouting volubly the while:\n\n\"Come in and see, come in and see! the only realistic presentation of\nthe original guillotine. Hundreds perish in Paris every day! Come and\nsee! Come and see! the perfectly vivid performance of what goes on\nhourly in Paris at the present moment.\"\n\nMarguerite had followed the direction of Sir Percy's eyes. She too was\nlooking at the booth, she heard the man's monotonous, raucous cries. She\ngave a slight shudder and once more looked imploringly at her husband.\nHis face--though outwardly as lazy and calm as before--had a strange set\nlook about the mouth and firm jaw, and his slender hand, the hand of a\ndandy accustomed to handle cards and dice and to play lightly with the\nfoils, was clutched tightly beneath the folds of the priceless Mechlin\nfrills.\n\nIt was but a momentary stiffening of the whole powerful frame, an\ninstant's flash of the ruling passion hidden within that very secretive\nsoul. Then he once more turned towards her, the rigid lines of his face\nrelaxed, he broke into a pleasant laugh, and with the most elaborate and\nmost courtly bow he took her hand in his and raising her fingers to his\nlips, he gave the answer to her questions:\n\n\"When your ladyship has ceased to be the most admired woman in Europe,\nnamely, when I am in my grave.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI: For the Poor of Paris\n\n\n\nThere was no time to say more then. For the laughing, chatting groups\nof friends had once more closed up round Marguerite and her husband,\nand she, ever on the alert, gave neither look nor sign that any serious\nconversation had taken place between Sir Percy and herself.\n\nWhatever she might feel or dread with regard to the foolhardy adventures\nin which he still persistently embarked, no member of the League\never guarded the secret of his chief more loyally than did Marguerite\nBlakeney.\n\nThough her heart overflowed with a passionate pride in her husband, she\nwas clever enough to conceal every emotion save that which Nature had\ninsisted on imprinting in her face, her present radiant happiness\nand her irresistible love. And thus before the world she kept up that\nbantering way with him, which had characterized her earlier matrimonial\nlife, that good-natured, easy contempt which he had so readily accepted\nin those days, and which their entourage would have missed and would\nhave enquired after, if she had changed her manner towards him too\nsuddenly.\n\nIn her heart she knew full well that within Percy Blakeney's soul\nshe had a great and powerful rival: his wild, mad, passionate love of\nadventure. For it he would sacrifice everything, even his life; she\ndared not ask herself if he would sacrifice his love.\n\nTwice in a few weeks he had been over to France: every time he went she\ncould not know if she would ever see him again. She could not imagine\nhow the French Committee of Public Safety could so clumsily allow the\nhated Scarlet Pimpernel to slip through its fingers. But she never\nattempted either to warn him or to beg him not to go. When he brought\nPaul Deroulede and Juliette Marny over from France, her heart went\nout to the two young people in sheer gladness and pride because of his\nprecious life, which he had risked for them.\n\nShe loved Juliette for the dangers Percy had passed, for the anxieties\nshe herself had endured; only to-day, in the midst of this beautiful\nsunshine, this joy of the earth, of summer and of the sky, she had\nsuddenly felt a mad, overpowering anxiety, a deadly hatred of the\nwild adventurous life, which took him so often away from her side. His\npleasant, bantering reply precluded her following up the subject, whilst\nthe merry chatter of people round her warned her to keep her words and\nlooks under control.\n\nBut she seemed now to feel the want of being alone, and, somehow, that\ndistant booth with its flaring placard, and the crier in the Phrygian\ncap, exercised a weird fascination over her.\n\nInstinctively she bent her steps thither, and equally instinctively the\nidle throng of her friends followed her. Sir Percy alone had halted in\norder to converse with Lord Hastings, who had just arrived.\n\n\"Surely, Lady Blakeney, you have no though of patronising that\ngruesome spectacle?\" said Lord Anthony Dewhurst, as Marguerite almost\nmechanically had paused within a few yards of the solitary booth.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, with enforced gaiety, \"the place seems\nto attract me. And I need not look at the spectacle,\" she added\nsignificantly, as she pointed to a roughly-scribbled notice at the\nentrance of the tent: \"In aid of the starving poor of Paris.\"\n\n\"There's a good-looking woman who sings, and a hideous mechanical toy\nthat moves,\" said one of the young men in the crowd. \"It is very dark\nand close inside the tent. I was lured in there for my sins, and was in\na mighty hurry to come out again.\"\n\n\"Then it must be my sins that are helping to lure me too at the present\nmoment,\" said Marguerite lightly. \"I pray you all to let me go in there.\nI want to hear the good-looking woman sing, even if I do not see the\nhideous toy on the move.\"\n\n\"May I escort you then, Lady Blakeney?\" said Lord Tony.\n\n\"Nay! I would rather go in alone,\" she replied a trifle impatiently. \"I\nbeg of you not to heed my whim, and to await my return, there, where the\nmusic is at its merriest.\"\n\nIt had been bad manners to insist. Marguerite, with a little\ncomprehensive nod to all her friends, left the young cavaliers still\nprotesting and quickly passed beneath the roughly constructed doorway\nthat gave access into the booth.\n\nA man, dressed in theatrical rags and wearing the characteristic scarlet\ncap, stood immediately within the entrance, and ostentatiously rattled a\nmoney box at regular intervals.\n\n\"For the starving poor of Paris,\" he drawled out in nasal monotonous\ntones the moment he caught sight of Marguerite and of her rich gown. She\ndropped some gold into the box and then passed on.\n\nThe interior of the booth was dark and lonely-looking after the glare\nof the hot September sun and the noisy crowd that thronged the sward\noutside. Evidently a performance had just taken place on the elevated\nplatform beyond, for a few yokels seemed to be lingering in a desultory\nmanner as if preparatory to going out.\n\nA few disjointed comments reached Marguerite's ears as she approached,\nand the small groups parted to allow her to pass. One or two women\ngaped in astonishment at her beautiful dress, whilst others bobbed a\nrespectful curtsey.\n\nThe mechanical toy arrested her attention immediately. She did not find\nit as gruesome as she expected, only singularly grotesque, with all\nthose wooden little figures in their quaint, arrested action.\n\nShe drew nearer to have a better look, and the yokels who had lingered\nbehind, paused, wondering if she would make any remark.\n\n\"Her ladyship was born in France,\" murmured one of the men, close to\nher, \"she would know if the thing really looks like that.\"\n\n\"She do seem interested,\" quoth another in a whisper.\n\n\"Lud love us all!\" said a buxom wench, who was clinging to the arm of a\nnervous-looking youth, \"I believe they're coming for more money.\"\n\nOn the elevated platform at the further end of the tent, a slim\nfigure had just made its appearance, that of a young woman dressed in\npeculiarly sombre colours, and with a black lace hood thrown lightly\nover her head.\n\nMarguerite thought that the face seemed familiar to her, and she also\nnoticed that the woman carried a large embroidered reticule in her\nbemittened hand.\n\nThere was a general exodus the moment she appeared. The Richmond yokels\ndid not like the look of that reticule. They felt that sufficient\ndemand had already been made upon their scant purses, considering the\nmeagerness of the entertainment, and they dreaded being lured to further\nextravagance.\n\nWhen Marguerite turned away from the mechanical toy, the last of the\nlittle crowd had disappeared, and she was alone in the booth with the\nwoman in the dark kirtle and black lace hood.\n\n\"For the poor of Paris, Madame,\" said the latter mechanically, holding\nout her reticule.\n\nMarguerite was looking at her intently. The face certainly seemed\nfamiliar, recalling to her mind the far-off days in Paris, before\nshe married. Some young actress no doubt driven out of France by that\nterrible turmoil which had caused so much sorrow and so much suffering.\nThe face was pretty, the figure slim and elegant, and the look of\nobvious sadness in the dark, almond-shaped eyes was calculated to\ninspire sympathy and pity.\n\nYet, strangely enough, Lady Blakeney felt repelled and chilled by this\nsombrely-dressed young person: an instinct, which she could not have\nexplained and which she felt had no justification, warned her that\nsomehow or other, the sadness was not quite genuine, the appeal for the\npoor not quite heartfelt.\n\nNevertheless, she took out her purse, and dropping some few sovereigns\ninto the capacious reticule, she said very kindly:\n\n\"I hope that you are satisfied with your day's work, Madame; I fear\nme our British country folk hold the strings of their purses somewhat\ntightly these times.\"\n\nThe woman sighed and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Oh, Madame!\" she said with a tone of great dejection, \"one does what\none can for one's starving countrymen, but it is very hard to elicit\nsympathy over here for them, poor dears!\"\n\n\"You are a Frenchwoman, of course,\" rejoined Marguerite, who had noted\nthat though the woman spoke English with a very pronounced foreign\naccent, she had nevertheless expressed herself with wonderful fluency\nand correctness.\n\n\"Just like Lady Blakeney herself,\" replied the other.\n\n\"You know who I am?\n\n\"Who could come to Richmond and not know Lady Blakeney by sight.\"\n\n\"But what made you come to Richmond on this philanthropic errand of\nyours?\"\n\n\"I go where I think there is a chance of earning a little money for\nthe cause which I have at heart,\" replied the Frenchwoman with the same\ngentle simplicity, the same tone of mournful dejection.\n\nWhat she said was undoubtedly noble and selfless. Lady Blakeney felt in\nher heart that her keenest sympathy should have gone out to this\nyoung woman--pretty, dainty, hardly more than a girl--who seemed to be\ndevoting her young life in a purely philanthropic and unselfish cause.\nAnd yet in spite of herself, Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that\ncurious sense of mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor\nthat feeling of unreality and staginess with which the Frenchwoman's\nattitude had originally struck her.\n\nYet she tried to be kind and to be cordial, tried to hide that coldness\nin her manner which she felt was unjustified.\n\n\"It is all very praiseworthy on your part, Madame,\" she said somewhat\nlamely. \"Madame...?\" she added interrogatively.\n\n\"My name is Candeille--Desiree Candeille,\" replied the Frenchwoman.\n\n\"Candeille?\" exclaimed Marguerite with sudden alacrity, \"Candeille...\nsurely...\"\n\n\"Yes... of the Varietes.\"\n\n\"Ah! then I know why your face from the first seemed familiar to me,\"\nsaid Marguerite, this time with unaffected cordiality. \"I must have\napplauded you many a time in the olden days. I am an ex-colleague, you\nknow. My name was St. Just before I married, and I was of the Maison\nMoliere.\"\n\n\"I knew that,\" said Desiree Candeille, \"and half hoped that you would\nremember me.\"\n\n\"Nay! who could forget Demoiselle Candeille, the most popular star in\nthe theatrical firmament?\"\n\n\"Oh! that was so long ago.\"\n\n\"Only four years.\"\n\n\"A fallen star is soon lost out of sight.\"\n\n\"Why fallen?\"\n\n\"It was a choice for me between exile from France and the guillotine,\"\nrejoined Candeille simply.\n\n\"Surely not?\" queried Marguerite with a touch of genuine sympathy.\nWith characteristic impulsiveness, she had now cast aside her former\nmisgivings: she had conquered her mistrust, at any rate had relegated\nit to the background of her mind. This woman was a colleague: she had\nsuffered and was in distress; she had every claim, therefore, on a\ncompatriot's help and friendship. She stretched out her hand and took\nDesiree Candeille's in her own; she forced herself to feel nothing but\nadmiration for this young woman, whose whole attitude spoke of sorrows\nnobly borne, of misfortunes proudly endured.\n\n\"I don't know why I should sadden you with my story,\" rejoined Desiree\nCandeille after a slight pause, during which she seemed to be waging\nwar against her own emotion. \"It is not a very interesting one. Hundreds\nhave suffered as I did. I had enemies in Paris. God knows how that\nhappened. I had never harmed anyone, but someone must have hated me and\nmust have wished me ill. Evil is so easily wrought in France these days.\nA denunciation--a perquisition--an accusation--then the flight from\nParis... the forged passports... the disguise... the bribe... the\nhardships... the squalid hiding places.... Oh! I have gone through\nit all... tasted every kind of humiliation... endured every kind of\ninsult.... Remember! that I was not a noble aristocrat... a Duchess\nor an impoverished Countess...\" she added with marked bitterness, \"or\nperhaps the English cavaliers whom the popular voice has called the\nLeague of the Scarlet Pimpernel would have taken some interest in me. I\nwas only a poor actress and had to find my way out of France alone, or\nelse perish on the guillotine.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry!\" said Marguerite simply.\n\n\"Tell me how you got on, once you were in England,\" she continued after\na while, seeing that Desiree Candeille seemed absorbed in thought.\n\n\"I had a few engagements at first,\" replied the Frenchwoman. \"I played\nat Sadler's Wells and with Mrs. Jordan at Covent Garden, but the Aliens'\nBill put an end to my chances of livelihood. No manager cared to give me\na part, and so...\"\n\n\"And so?\"\n\n\"Oh! I had a few jewels and I sold them.... A little money and I live on\nthat.... But when I played at Covent Garden I contrived to send part of\nmy salary over to some of the poorer clubs of Paris. My heart aches for\nthose that are starving.... Poor wretches, they are misguided and misled\nby self-seeking demagogues.... It hurts me to feel that I can do nothing\nmore to help them... and eases my self-respect if, by singing at public\nfairs, I can still send a few francs to those who are poorer than\nmyself.\"\n\nShe had spoken with ever-increasing passion and vehemence. Marguerite,\nwith eyes fixed into vacancy, seeing neither the speaker nor her\nsurroundings, seeing only visions of those same poor wreckages of\nhumanity, who had been goaded into thirst for blood, when their shrunken\nbodies should have been clamouring for healthy food,--Marguerite\nthus absorbed, had totally forgotten her earlier prejudices and now\ncompletely failed to note all that was unreal, stagy, theatrical, in the\noratorical declamations of the ex-actress from the Varietes.\n\nPre-eminently true and loyal herself in spite of the many deceptions and\ntreacheries which she had witnessed in her life, she never looked for\nfalsehood or for cant in others. Even now she only saw before her a\nwoman who had been wrongfully persecuted, who had suffered and had\nforgiven those who had caused her to suffer. She bitterly accused\nherself for her original mistrust of this noble-hearted, unselfish\nwoman, who was content to tramp around in an alien country, bartering\nher talents for a few coins, in order that some of those, who were the\noriginators of her sorrows, might have bread to eat and a bed in which\nto sleep.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" she said warmly, \"truly you shame me, who am also\nFrench-born, with the many sacrifices you so nobly make for those who\nshould have first claim on my own sympathy. Believe me, if I have\nnot done as much as duty demanded of me in the cause of my starving\ncompatriots, it has not been for lack of good-will. Is there any way\nnow,\" she added eagerly, \"in which I can help you? Putting aside the\nquestion of money, wherein I pray you to command my assistance, what can\nI do to be of useful service to you?\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Lady Blakeney...\" said the other hesitatingly.\n\n\"Well? What is it? I see there is something in your mind...\"\n\n\"It is perhaps difficult to express... but people say I have a good\nvoice... I sing some French ditties... they are a novelty in England, I\nthink.... If I could sing them in fashionable salons... I might\nperhaps...\"\n\n\"Nay! you shall sing in fashionable salons,\" exclaimed Marguerite\neagerly, \"you shall become the fashion, and I'll swear the Prince of\nWales himself shall bid you sing at Carlton House... and you shall name\nyour own fee, Mademoiselle... and London society shall vie with the\nelite of Bath, as to which shall lure you to its most frequented\nrouts.... There! there! you shall make a fortune for the Paris poor...\nand to prove to you that I mean every word I say, you shall begin your\ntriumphant career in my own salon to-morrow night. His Royal Highness\nwill be present. You shall sing your most engaging songs... and for\nyour fee you must accept a hundred guineas, which you shall send to\nthe poorest workman's club in Paris in the name of Sir Percy and Lady\nBlakeney.\"\n\n\"I thank your ladyship, but...\"\n\n\"You'll not refuse?\"\n\n\"I'll accept gladly... but... you will understand... I am not very old,\"\nsaid Candeille quaintly, \"I... I am only an actress... but if a young\nactress is unprotected... then...\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Marguerite gently, \"that you are far too pretty\nto frequent the world all alone, and that you have a mother, a sister\nor a friend... which?... whom you would wish to escort you to-morrow. Is\nthat it?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" rejoined the actress, with marked bitterness, \"I have neither\nmother, nor sister, but our Revolutionary Government, with tardy\ncompassion for those it has so relentlessly driven out of France,\nhas deputed a representative of theirs in England to look after the\ninterests of French subjects over here!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"They have realised over in Paris that my life here has been devoted to\nthe welfare of the poor people of France. The representative whom the\ngovernment has sent to England is specially interested in me and in\nmy work. He is a stand-by for me in case of trouble... in case of\ninsults... A woman alone is oft subject to those, even at the hands of\nso-called gentlemen... and the official representative of my own country\nbecomes in such cases my most natural protector.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"You will receive him?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Then may I present him to your ladyship?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like.\"\n\n\"Now, and it please you.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Yes. Here he comes, at your ladyship's service.\"\n\nDesiree Candeille's almond-shaped eyes were fixed upon a distant part of\nthe tent, behind Lady Blakeney in the direction of the main entrance\nto the booth. There was a slight pause after she had spoken and\nthen Marguerite slowly turned in order to see who this official\nrepresentative of France was, whom at the young actress' request she had\njust agreed to receive in her house. In the doorway of the tent, framed\nby its gaudy draperies, and with the streaming sunshine as a brilliant\nbackground behind him, stood the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII: Premonition\n\n\n\nMarguerite neither moved nor spoke. She felt two pairs of eyes fixed\nupon her, and with all the strength of will at her command she forced\nthe very blood in her veins not to quit her cheeks, forced her eyelids\nnot to betray by a single quiver the icy pang of a deadly premonition\nwhich at sight of Chauvelin seemed to have chilled her entire soul.\n\nThere he stood before her, dressed in his usual somber garments, a look\nalmost of humility in those keen grey eyes of his, which a year ago on\nthe cliffs of Calais had peered down at her with such relentless hate.\n\nStrange that at this moment she should have felt an instinct of fear.\nWhat cause had she to throw more than a pitiful glance at the man who\nhad tried so cruelly to wrong her, and who had so signally failed?\n\nHaving bowed very low and very respectfully, Chauvelin advanced towards\nher, with all the airs of a disgraced courtier craving audience from his\nqueen.\n\nAs he approached she instinctively drew back.\n\n\"Would you prefer not to speak to me, Lady Blakeney?\" he said humbly.\n\nShe could scarcely believe her ears, or trust her eyes. It seemed\nimpossible that a man could have so changed in a few months. He even\nlooked shorter than last year, more shrunken within himself. His hair,\nwhich he wore free from powder, was perceptibly tinged with grey.\n\n\"Shall I withdraw?\" he added after a pause, seeing that Marguerite made\nno movement to return his salutation.\n\n\"It would be best, perhaps,\" she replied coldly. \"You and I, Monsieur\nChauvelin, have so little to say to one another.\"\n\n\"Very little indeed,\" he rejoined quietly; \"the triumphant and happy\nhave ever very little to say to the humiliated and the defeated. But\nI had hoped that Lady Blakeney in the midst of her victory would have\nspared one thought of pity and one of pardon.\"\n\n\"I did not know that you had need of either from me, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Pity perhaps not, but forgiveness certainly.\"\n\n\"You have that, if you so desire it.\"\n\n\"Since I failed, you might try to forget.\"\n\n\"That is beyond my power. But believe me, I have ceased to think of the\ninfinite wrong which you tried to do to me.\"\n\n\"But I failed,\" he insisted, \"and I meant no harm to YOU.\"\n\n\"To those I care for, Monsieur Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"I had to serve my country as best I could. I meant no harm to your\nbrother. He is safe in England now. And the Scarlet Pimpernel was\nnothing to you.\"\n\nShe tried to read his face, tried to discover in those inscrutable eyes\nof his, some hidden meaning to his words. Instinct had warned her of\ncourse that this man could be nothing but an enemy, always and at all\ntimes. But he seemed so broken, so abject now, that contempt for his\ndejected attitude, and for the defeat which had been inflicted on him,\nchased the last remnant of fear from her heart.\n\n\"I did not even succeed in harming that enigmatical personage,\"\ncontinued Chauvelin with the same self-abasement. \"Sir Percy Blakeney,\nyou remember, threw himself across my plans, quite innocently of course.\nI failed where you succeeded. Luck has deserted me. Our government\noffered me a humble post, away from France. I look after the interests\nof French subjects settled in England. My days of power are over. My\nfailure is complete. I do not complain, for I failed in a combat of\nwits... but I failed... I failed... I failed... I am almost a fugitive\nand I am quite disgraced. That is my present history, Lady Blakeney,\" he\nconcluded, taking once more a step towards her, \"and you will understand\nthat it would be a solace if you extended your hand to me just once\nmore, and let me feel that although you would never willingly look upon\nmy face again, you have enough womanly tenderness in you to force your\nheart to forgiveness and mayhap to pity.\"\n\nMarguerite hesitated. He held out his hand and her warm, impulsive\nnature prompted her to be kind. But instinct would not be gainsaid: a\ncurious instinct to which she refused to respond. What had she to fear\nfrom this miserable and cringing little worm who had not even in him\nthe pride of defeat? What harm could he do to her, or to those whom she\nloved? Her brother was in England! Her husband! Bah! not the enmity of\nthe entire world could make her fear for him!\n\nNay! That instinct, which caused her to draw away from Chauvelin, as\nshe would from a venomous asp, was certainly not fear. It was hate! She\nhated this man! Hated him for all that she had suffered because of\nhim; for that terrible night on the cliffs of Calais! The peril to\nher husband who had become so infinitely dear! The humiliations and\nself-reproaches which he had endured.\n\nYes! it was hate! and hate was of all emotions the one she most\ndespised.\n\nHate? Does one hate a slimy but harmless toad or a stinging fly?\nIt seemed ridiculous, contemptible and pitiable to think of hate in\nconnection with the melancholy figure of this discomfited intriguer,\nthis fallen leader of revolutionary France.\n\nHe was holding out his hand to her. If she placed even the tips of\nher fingers upon it, she would be making the compact of mercy and\nforgiveness which he was asking of her. The woman Desiree Candeille\nroused within her the last lingering vestige of her slumbering wrath.\nFalse, theatrical and stagy--as Marguerite had originally suspected--she\nappeared to have been in league with Chauvelin to bring about this\nundesirable meeting.\n\nLady Blakeney turned from one to another, trying to conceal her contempt\nbeneath a mask of passionless indifference. Candeille was standing close\nby, looking obviously distressed and not a little puzzled. An instant's\nreflection was sufficient to convince Marguerite that the whilom actress\nof the Varietes Theatre was obviously ignorant of the events to\nwhich Chauvelin had been alluding: she was, therefore, of no serious\nconsequence, a mere tool, mayhap, in the ex-ambassador's hands. At the\npresent moment she looked like a silly child who does not understand the\nconversation of the \"grown-ups.\"\n\nMarguerite had promised her help and protection, had invited her to her\nhouse, and offered her a munificent gift in aid of a deserving cause.\nShe was too proud to go back now on that promise, to rescind the\ncontract because of an unexplainable fear. With regard to Chauvelin,\nthe matter stood differently: she had made him no direct offer of\nhospitality: she had agreed to receive in her house the official\nchaperone of an unprotected girl, but she was not called upon to show\ncordiality to her own and her husband's most deadly enemy.\n\nShe was ready to dismiss him out of her life with a cursory word of\npardon and a half-expressed promise of oblivion: on that understanding\nand that only she was ready to let her hand rest for the space of one\nsecond in his.\n\nShe had looked upon her fallen enemy, seen his discomfiture and his\nhumiliation! Very well! Now let him pass out of her life, all the\nmore easily, since the last vision of him would be one of such utter\nabjection as would even be unworthy of hate.\n\nAll these thoughts, feelings and struggles passed through her mind\nwith great rapidity. Her hesitation had lasted less than five seconds:\nChauvelin still wore the look of doubting entreaty with which he had\nfirst begged permission to take her hand in his. With an impulsive toss\nof the head, she had turned straight towards him, ready with the phrase\nwith which she meant to dismiss him from her sight now and forever, when\nsuddenly a well-known laugh broke in upon her ear, and a lazy, drawly\nvoice said pleasantly:\n\n\"La! I vow the air is fit to poison you! Your Royal Highness, I entreat,\nlet us turn our backs upon these gates of Inferno, where lost souls\nwould feel more at home than doth your humble servant.\"\n\nThe next moment His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had entered the\ntent, closely followed by Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Invitation\n\n\n\nIt was in truth a strange situation, this chance meeting between Percy\nBlakeney and ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.\n\nMarguerite looked up at her husband. She saw him shrug his broad\nshoulders as he first caught sight of Chauvelin, and glance down in his\nusual lazy, good-humoured manner at the shrunken figure of the silent\nFrenchman. The words she meant to say never crossed her lips; she was\nwaiting to hear what the two men would say to one another.\n\nThe instinct of the grande dame in her, the fashionable lady accustomed\nto the exigencies of society, just gave her sufficient presence of mind\nto make the requisite low curtsey before His Royal Highness. But the\nPrince, forgetting his accustomed gallantry, was also absorbed in the\nlittle scene before him. He, too, was looking from the sable-clad figure\nof Chauvelin to that of gorgeously arrayed Sir Percy. He, too, like\nMarguerite, was wondering what was passing behind the low, smooth\nforehead of that inimitable dandy, what behind the inscrutably\ngood-humoured expression of those sleepy eyes.\n\nOf the five persons thus present in the dark and stuffy booth, certainly\nSir Percy Blakeney seemed the least perturbed. He had paused just long\nenough to allow Chauvelin to become fully conscious of a feeling\nof supreme irritation and annoyance, then he strolled up to the\nex-ambassador, with hand outstretched and the most engaging of smiles.\n\n\"Ha!\" he said, with his usual half-shy, half-pleasant-tempered smile,\n\"my engaging friend from France! I hope, sir, that our demmed climate\ndoth find you well and hearty to-day.\"\n\nThe cheerful voice seemed to ease the tension. Marguerite sighed a sigh\nof relief. After all, what was more natural than that Percy with his\namazing fund of pleasant irresponsibility should thus greet the man\nwho had once vowed to bring him to the guillotine? Chauvelin, himself,\naccustomed by now to the audacious coolness of his enemy, was scarcely\ntaken by surprise. He bowed low to His Highness, who, vastly amused at\nBlakeney's sally, was inclined to be gracious to everyone, even though\nthe personality of Chauvelin as a well-known leader of the regicide\ngovernment was inherently distasteful to him. But the Prince saw in\nthe wizened little figure before him an obvious butt for his friend\nBlakeney's impertinent shafts, and although historians have been unable\nto assert positively whether or no George Prince of Wales knew aught of\nSir Percy's dual life, yet there is no doubt that he was always ready\nto enjoy a situation which brought about the discomfiture of any of the\nScarlet Pimpernel's avowed enemies.\n\n\"I, too, have not met M. Chauvelin for many a long month,\" said His\nRoyal Highness with an obvious show of irony. \"And I mistake not, sir,\nyou left my father's court somewhat abruptly last year.\"\n\n\"Nay, your Royal Highness,\" said Percy gaily, \"my friend Monsieur...\ner... Chaubertin and I had serious business to discuss, which could only\nbe dealt with in France.... Am I not right, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Quite right, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin curtly.\n\n\"We had to discuss abominable soup in Calais, had we not?\" continued\nBlakeney in the same tone of easy banter, \"and wine that I vowed\nwas vinegar. Monsieur... er... Chaubertin... no, no, I beg pardon...\nChauvelin... Monsieur Chauvelin and I quite agreed upon that point.\nThe only matter on which we were not quite at one was the question of\nsnuff.\"\n\n\"Snuff?\" laughed His Royal Highness, who seemed vastly amused.\n\n\"Yes, your Royal Highness... snuff... Monsieur Chauvelin here had--if I\nmay be allowed to say so--so vitiated a taste in snuff that he prefers\nit with an admixture of pepper... Is that not so, Monsieur... er...\nChaubertin?\"\n\n\"Chauvelin, Sir Percy,\" remarked the ex-ambassador drily.\n\nHe was determined not to lose his temper and looked urbane and pleasant,\nwhilst his impudent enemy was enjoying a joke at his expense. Marguerite\nthe while had not taken her eyes off the keen, shrewd face. Whilst the\nthree men talked, she seemed suddenly to have lost her sense of the\nreality of things. The present situation appeared to her strangely\nfamiliar, like a dream which she had dreamt oft times before.\n\nSuddenly it became absolutely clear to her that the whole scene had been\narranged and planned: the booth with its flaring placard, Demoiselle\nCandeille soliciting her patronage, her invitation to the young actress,\nChauvelin's sudden appearance, all, all had been concocted and arranged,\nnot here, not in England at all, but out there in Paris, in some dark\ngathering of blood-thirsty ruffians, who had invented a final trap for\nthe destruction of the bold adventurer, who went by the name of the\nScarlet Pimpernel.\n\nAnd she also was only a puppet, enacting a part which had been written\nfor her: she had acted just as THEY had anticipated, had spoken the very\nwords they had meant her to say: and when she looked at Percy, he seemed\nsupremely ignorant of it all, unconscious of this trap of the existence\nof which everyone here present was aware, save indeed himself. She\nwould have fought against this weird feeling of obsession, of being a\nmechanical toy would up to do certain things, but this she could not do;\nher will appeared paralysed, her tongue even refused her service.\n\nAs in a dream she heard His Royal Highness ask for the name of the young\nactress who was soliciting alms for the poor of Paris.\n\nThat also had been prearranged. His Royal Highness for the moment was\nalso a puppet, made to dance, to speak and to act as Chauvelin and his\ncolleagues over in France had decided that he should. Quite mechanically\nMarguerite introduced Demoiselle Candeille to the Prince's gracious\nnotice.\n\n\"If your Highness will permit,\" she said, \"Mademoiselle Candeille will\ngive us some of her charming old French songs at my rout to-morrow.\"\n\n\"By all means! By all means!\" said the Prince. \"I used to know some\nin my childhood days. Charming and poetic.... I know.... I know.... We\nshall be delighted to hear Mademoiselle sing, eh, Blakeney?\" he added\ngood-humouredly, \"and for your rout to-morrow will you not also invite\nM. Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"Nay! but that goes without saying, your Royal Highness,\" responded Sir\nPercy, with hospitable alacrity and a most approved bow directed at his\narch-enemy. \"We shall expect M. Chauvelin. He and I have not met for so\nlong, and he shall be made right welcome at Blakeney Manor.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX: Demoiselle Candeille\n\n\n\nHer origin was of the humblest, for her mother--so it was said--had\nbeen kitchen-maid in the household of the Duc de Marny, but Desiree had\nreceived some kind of education, and though she began life as a dresser\nin one of the minor theatres of Paris, she became ultimately one of its\nmost popular stars.\n\nShe was small and dark, dainty in her manner and ways, and with a\ngraceful little figure, peculiarly supple and sinuous. Her humble\norigin certainly did not betray itself in her hands and feet, which were\nexquisite in shape and lilliputian in size.\n\nHer hair was soft and glossy, always free from powder, and cunningly\narranged so as to slightly overshadow the upper part of her face.\n\nThe chin was small and round, the mouth extraordinarily red, the neck\nslender and long. But she was not pretty: so said all the women. Her\nskin was rather coarse in texture and darkish in colour, her eyes\nwere narrow and slightly turned upwards at the corners; no! she was\ndistinctly not pretty.\n\nYet she pleased the men! Perhaps because she was so artlessly determined\nto please them. The women said that Demoiselle Candeille never left a\nman alone until she had succeeded in captivating his fancy if only for\nfive minutes; an interval in a dance... the time to cross a muddy road.\n\nBut for five minutes she was determined to hold any man's complete\nattention, and to exact his admiration. And she nearly always succeeded.\n\nTherefore the women hated her. The men were amused. It is extremely\npleasant to have one's admiration compelled, one's attention so\ndeterminedly sought after.\n\nAnd Candeille could be extremely amusing, and as Madelon in Moliere's\n\"Les Precieuses\" was quite inimitable.\n\nThis, however, was in the olden days, just before Paris went quite mad,\nbefore the Reign of Terror had set in, and ci-devant Louis the King had\nbeen executed.\n\nCandeille had taken it into her frolicsome little head that she would\nlike to go to London. The idea was of course in the nature of an\nexperiment. Those dull English people over the water knew so little\nof what good acting really meant. Tragedy? Well! passons! Their heavy,\nlarge-boned actresses might manage one or two big scenes where a\ncommanding presence and a powerful voice would not come amiss, and where\nprominent teeth would pass unnoticed in the agony of a dramatic climax.\n\nBut Comedy!\n\nAh! ca non, par example! Demoiselle Candeille had seen several English\ngentlemen and ladies in those same olden days at the Tuileries, but\nshe really could not imagine any of them enacting the piquant scenes of\nMoliere or Beaumarchais.\n\nDemoiselle Candeille thought of every English-born individual as having\nvery large teeth. Now large teeth do not lend themselves to well-spoken\ncomedy scenes, to smiles, or to double entendre.\n\nHer own teeth were exceptionally small and white, and very sharp, like\nthose of a kitten.\n\nYes! Demoiselle Candeille thought it would be extremely interesting to\ngo to London and to show to a nation of shopkeepers how daintily one can\nbe amused in a theatre.\n\nPermission to depart from Paris was easy to obtain. In fact the fair\nlady had never really found it difficult to obtain anything she very\nmuch wanted.\n\nIn this case she had plenty of friends in high places. Marat was still\nalive and a great lover of the theatre. Tallien was a personal admirer\nof hers, Deputy Dupont would do anything she asked.\n\nShe wanted to act in London, at a theatre called Drury Lane. She wanted\nto play Moliere in England in French, and had already spoken with\nseveral of her colleagues, who were ready to join her. They would give\npublic representations in aid of the starving population of France;\nthere were plenty of Socialistic clubs in London quite Jacobin and\nRevolutionary in tendency: their members would give her full support.\n\nShe would be serving her country and her countrymen and incidentally see\nsomething of the world, and amuse herself. She was bored in Paris.\n\nThen she thought of Marguerite St. Just, once of the Maison Moliere, who\nhad captivated an English milor of enormous wealth. Demoiselle Candeille\nhad never been of the Maison Moliere; she had been the leading star of\none of the minor--yet much-frequented--theatres of Paris, but she felt\nherself quite able and ready to captivate some other unattached milor,\nwho would load her with English money and incidentally bestow an English\nname upon her.\n\nSo she went to London.\n\nThe experiment, however, had not proved an unmitigated success. At first\nshe and her company did obtain a few engagements at one or two of the\nminor theatres, to give representations of some of the French classical\ncomedies in the original language.\n\nBut these never quite became the fashion. The feeling against France\nand all her doings was far too keen in that very set, which Demoiselle\nCandeille had desired to captivate with her talents, to allow of the\nEnglish jeunesse doree to flock and see Moliere played in French, by a\nFrench troupe, whilst Candeille's own compatriots resident in England\nhad given her but scant support.\n\nOne section of these--the aristocrats and emigres--looked upon the\nactress who was a friend of all the Jacobins in Paris as nothing better\nthan canaille. They sedulously ignored her presence in this country, and\nsnubbed her whenever they had an opportunity.\n\nThe other section--chiefly consisting of agents and spies of the\nRevolutionary Government--she would gladly have ignored. They had at\nfirst made a constant demand on her purse, her talents and her time:\nthen she grew tired of them, and felt more and more chary of being\nidentified with a set which was in such ill-odour with that very same\njeunesse doree whom Candeille had desired to please.\n\nIn her own country she was and always had been a good republican: Marat\nhad given her her first start in life by his violent praises of her\ntalent in his widely-circulated paper; she had been associated in\nParis with the whole coterie of artists and actors: every one of them\nrepublican to a man. But in London, although one might be snubbed by\nthe emigres and aristocrats--it did not do to be mixed up with the\nsans-culotte journalists and pamphleteers who haunted the Socialistic\nclubs of the English capital, and who were the prime organizers of all\nthose seditious gatherings and treasonable unions that caused Mr. Pitt\nand his colleagues so much trouble and anxiety.\n\nOne by one, Desiree Candeille's comrades, male and female, who had\naccompanied her to England, returned to their own country. When war was\ndeclared, some of them were actually sent back under the provisions of\nthe Aliens Bill.\n\nBut Desiree had stayed on.\n\nHer old friends in Paris had managed to advise her that she would not\nbe very welcome there just now. The sans-culotte journalists of England,\nthe agents and spies of the Revolutionary Government, had taken their\nrevenge of the frequent snubs inflicted upon them by the young actress,\nand in those days the fact of being unwelcome in France was apt to have\na more lurid and more dangerous significant.\n\nCandeille did not dare return: at any rate not for the present.\n\nShe trusted to her own powers of intrigue, and her well-known\nfascinations, to re-conquer the friendship of the Jacobin clique, and\nshe once more turned her attention to the affiliated Socialistic clubs\nof England. But between the proverbial two stools, Demoiselle Candeille\nsoon came to the ground. Her machinations became known in official\nquarters, her connection with all the seditious clubs of London was soon\nbruited abroad, and one evening Desiree found herself confronted with\na document addressed to her: \"From the Office of His Majesty's Privy\nSeal,\" wherein it was set forth that, pursuant to the statute 33 George\nIII. cap. 5, she, Desiree Candeille, a French subject now resident in\nEngland, was required to leave this kingdom by order of His Majesty\nwithin seven days, and that in the event of the said Desiree Candeille\nrefusing to comply with this order, she would be liable to commitment,\nbrought to trial and sentenced to imprisonment for a month, and\nafterwards to removal within a limited time under pain of transportation\nfor life.\n\nThis meant that Demoiselle Candeille had exactly seven days in which to\nmake complete her reconciliation with her former friends who now ruled\nParis and France with a relentless and perpetually bloodstained hand.\nNo wonder that during the night which followed the receipt of this\nmomentous document, Demoiselle Candeille suffered gravely from insomnia.\n\nShe dared not go back to France, she was ordered out of England! What\nwas to become of her?\n\nThis was just three days before the eventful afternoon of the Richmond\nGala, and twenty-four hours after ex-Ambassador Chauvelin had landed in\nEngland. Candeille and Chauvelin had since then met at the \"Cercle des\nJacobins Francais\" in Soho Street, and now fair Desiree found herself in\nlodgings in Richmond, the evening of the day following the Gala, feeling\nthat her luck had not altogether deserted her.\n\nOne conversation with Citizen Chauvelin had brought the fickle jade\nback to Demoiselle Candeilles' service. Nay, more, the young actress\nsaw before her visions of intrigue, of dramatic situations, of pleasant\nlittle bits of revenge;--all of which was meat and drink and air to\nbreathe for Mademoiselle Desiree.\n\nShe was to sing in one of the most fashionable salons in England: that\nwas very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and see her! that\nopened out a vista of delightful possibilities! And all she had to do\nwas to act a part dictated to her by Citizen Chauvelin, to behave as\nhe directed, to move in the way he wished! Well! that was easy enough,\nsince the part which she would have to play was one peculiarly suited to\nher talents.\n\nShe looked at herself critically in the glass. Her maid Fanchon--a\nlittle French waif picked up in the slums of Soho--helped to readjust a\nstray curl which had rebelled against the comb.\n\n\"Now for the necklace, Mademoiselle,\" said Fanchon with suppressed\nexcitement.\n\nIt had just arrived by messenger: a large morocco case, which now lay\nopen on the dressing table, displaying its dazzling contents.\n\nCandeille scarcely dared to touch it, and yet it was for her. Citizen\nChauvelin had sent a note with it.\n\n\"Citizeness Candeille will please accept this gift from the government\nof France in acknowledgment of useful services past and to come.\"\n\nThe note was signed with Robespierre's own name, followed by that of\nCitizen Chauvelin. The morocco case contained a necklace of diamonds\nworth the ransom of a king.\n\n\"For useful services past and to come!\" and there were promises of still\nfurther rewards, a complete pardon for all defalcations, a place\nwithin the charmed circle of the Comedie Francaise, a grand pageant\nand apotheosis with Citizeness Candeille impersonating the Goddess of\nReason, in the midst of a grand national fete, and the acclamations of\nexcited Paris: and all in exchange for the enactment of a part--simple\nand easy--outlined for her by Chauvelin!...\n\nHow strange! how inexplicable! Candeille took the necklace up in her\ntrembling fingers and gazed musingly at the priceless gems. She had seen\nthe jewels before, long, long ago! round the neck of the Duchesse de\nMarny, in whose service her own mother had been. She--as a child--had\noften gazed at and admired the great lady, who seemed like a wonderful\nfairy from an altogether world, to the poor little kitchen slut.\n\nHow wonderful are the vagaries of fortune! Desiree Candeille, the\nkitchen-maid's daughter, now wearing her ex-mistress' jewels.\nShe supposed that these had been confiscated when the last of the\nMarnys--the girl, Juliette--had escaped from France! confiscated and now\nsent to her--Candeille--as a reward or as a bribe!\n\nIn either case they were welcome. The actress' vanity was soothed. She\nknew Juliette Marny was in England, and that she would meet her to-night\nat Lady Blakeney's. After the many snubs which she had endured from\nFrench aristocrats settled in England, the actress felt that she was\nabout to enjoy an evening of triumph.\n\nThe intrigue excited her. She did not quite know what schemes Chauvelin\nwas aiming at, what ultimate end he had had in view when he commanded\nher services and taught her the part which he wished her to play.\n\nThat the schemes were vast and the end mighty, she could not doubt. The\nreward she had received was proof enough of that.\n\nLittle Fanchon stood there in speechless admiration, whilst her mistress\nstill fondly fingered the magnificent necklace.\n\n\"Mademoiselle will wear the diamond to-night?\" she asked with evident\nanxiety: she would have been bitterly disappointed to have seen the\nbeautiful thing once more relegated to its dark morocco case.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Fanchon!\" said Candeille with a sigh of great satisfaction;\n\"see that they are fastened quite securely, my girl.\"\n\nShe put the necklace round her shapely neck and Fanchon looked to see\nthat the clasp was quite secure.\n\nThere came the sound of loud knocking at the street door.\n\n\"That is M. Chauvelin come to fetch me with the chaise. Am I quite\nready, Fanchon?\" asked Desiree Candeille.\n\n\"Oh yes, Mademoiselle!\" sighed the little maid; \"and Mademoiselle looks\nvery beautiful to-night.\"\n\n\"Lady Blakeney is very beautiful too, Fanchon,\" rejoined the actress\nnaively, \"but I wonder if she will wear anything as fine as the Marny\nnecklace?\"\n\nThe knocking at the street door was repeated. Candeille took a final,\nsatisfied survey of herself in the glass. She knew her part and felt\nthat she had dressed well for it. She gave a final, affectionate\nlittle tap to the diamonds round her neck, took her cloak and hood from\nFanchon, and was ready to go.\n\n\n\n\nChapter X: Lady Blakeney's Rout\n\n\n\nThere are several accounts extant, in the fashionable chronicles of the\ntime, of the gorgeous reception given that autumn by Lady Blakeney in\nher magnificent riverside home.\n\nNever had the spacious apartments of Blakeney Manor looked more\nresplendent than on this memorable occasion--memorable because of the\nevents which brought the brilliant evening to a close.\n\nThe Prince of Wales had come over by water from Carlton House; the Royal\nPrincesses came early, and all fashionable London was there, chattering\nand laughing, displaying elaborate gowns and priceless jewels dancing,\nflirting, listening to the strains of the string band, or strolling\nlistlessly in the gardens, where the late roses and clumps of heliotrope\nthrew soft fragrance on the balmy air.\n\nBut Marguerite was nervous and agitated. Strive how she might, she\ncould not throw off that foreboding of something evil to come, which had\nassailed her from the first moment when she met Chauvelin face to face.\n\nThat unaccountable feeling of unreality was still upon her, that sense\nthat she, and the woman Candeille, Percy and even His Royal Highness\nwere, for the time being, the actors in a play written and stage-managed\nby Chauvelin. The ex-ambassador's humility, his offers of friendship,\nhis quietude under Sir Percy's good-humoured banter, everything was a\nsham. Marguerite knew it; her womanly instinct, her passionate love, all\ncried out to her in warning: but there was that in her husband's nature\nwhich rendered her powerless in the face of such dangers, as, she felt\nsure, were now threatening him.\n\nJust before her guests had begun to assemble, she had been alone with\nhim for a few minutes. She had entered the room in which he sat, looking\nradiantly beautiful in a shimmering gown of white and silver, with\ndiamonds in her golden hair and round her exquisite neck.\n\nMoments like this, when she was alone with him, were the joy of her\nlife. Then and then only did she see him as he really was, with that\nwistful tenderness in his deep-set eyes, that occasional flash\nof passion from beneath the lazily-drooping lids. For a few\nminutes--seconds, mayhap--the spirit of the reckless adventurer was laid\nto rest, relegated into the furthermost background of this senses by the\npowerful emotions of the lover.\n\nThen he would seize her in his arms, and hold her to him, with a strange\nlonging to tear from out his heart all other thoughts, feelings and\npassions save those which made him a slave to her beauty and her smiles.\n\n\"Percy!\" she whispered to him to-night when freeing herself from his\nembrace she looked up at him, and for this one heavenly second felt\nhim all her own. \"Percy, you will do nothing rash, nothing foolhardy\nto-night. That man had planned all that took place yesterday. He hates\nyou, and ...\"\n\nIn a moment his face and attitude had changed, the heavy lids drooped\nover the eyes, the rigidity of the mouth relaxed, and that quaint,\nhalf-shy, half-inane smile played around the firm lips.\n\n\"Of course he does, m'dear,\" he said in his usual affected, drawly\ntones, \"of course he does, but that is so demmed amusing. He does not\nreally know what or how much he knows, or what I know.... In fact...\ner... we none of us know anything... just at present....\"\n\nHe laughed lightly and carelessly, then deliberately readjusted the set\nof his lace tie.\n\n\"Percy!\" she said reproachfully.\n\n\"Yes, m'dear.\"\n\n\"Lately when you brought Deroulede and Juliette Marny to England... I\nendured agonies of anxiety... and...\"\n\nHe sighed, a quick, short, wistful sigh, and said very gently:\n\n\"I know you did, m'dear, and that is where the trouble lies. I know that\nyou are fretting, so I have to be so demmed quick about the business,\nso as not to keep you in suspense too long.... And now I can't take\nFfoulkes away from his young wife, and Tony and the others are so mighty\nslow.\"\n\n\"Percy!\" she said once more with tender earnestness.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" he said with a slight frown of self-reproach. \"La!\nbut I don't deserve your solicitude. Heavens know what a brute I was for\nyears, whilst I neglected you, and ignored the noble devotion which I,\nalas! do even now so little to deserve.\"\n\nShe would have said something more, but was interrupted by the entrance\nof Juliette Marny into the room.\n\n\"Some of your guests have arrived, Lady Blakeney,\" said the young girl,\napologising for her seeming intrusion. \"I thought you would wish to\nknow.\"\n\nJuliette looked very young and girlish in a simple white gown, without\na single jewel on her arms or neck. Marguerite regarded her with\nunaffected approval.\n\n\"You look charming to-night, Mademoiselle, does she not, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Thanks to your bounty,\" smiled Juliette, a trifle sadly. \"Whilst\nI dressed to-night, I felt how I should have loved to wear my dear\nmother's jewels, of which she used to be so proud.\"\n\n\"We must hope that you will recover them, dear, some day,\" said\nMarguerite vaguely, as she led the young girl out of the small study\ntowards the larger reception rooms.\n\n\"Indeed I hope so,\" sighed Juliette. \"When times became so troublous in\nFrance after my dear father's death, his confessor and friend, the Abbe\nFoucquet, took charge of all my mother's jewels for me. He said they\nwould be safe with the ornaments of his own little church at Boulogne.\nHe feared no sacrilege, and thought they would be most effectually\nhidden there, for no one would dream of looking for the Marny diamonds\nin the crypt of a country church.\"\n\nMarguerite said nothing in reply. Whatever her own doubts might be upon\nsuch a subject, it could serve no purpose to disturb the young girl's\nserenity.\n\n\"Dear Abbe Foucquet,\" said Juliette after a while, \"his is the kind of\ndevotion which I feel sure will never be found under the new regimes of\nanarchy and of so-called equality. He would have laid down his life for\nmy father or for me. And I know that he would never part with the jewels\nwhich I entrusted to his care, whilst he had breath and strength to\ndefend them.\"\n\nMarguerite would have wished to pursue the subject a little further.\nIt was very pathetic to witness poor Juliette's hopes and confidences,\nwhich she felt sure would never be realised.\n\nLady Blakeney knew so much of what was going on in France just now:\nspoliations, confiscations, official thefts, open robberies, all in the\nname of equality, of fraternity and of patriotism. She knew nothing,\nof course, of the Abbe Foucquet, but the tender little picture of the\ndevoted old man, painted by Juliette's words, had appealed strongly to\nher sympathetic heart.\n\nInstinct and knowledge of the political aspect of France told her that\nby entrusting valuable family jewels to the old Abbe, Juliette had most\nunwittingly placed the man she so much trusted in danger of persecution\nat the hands of a government which did not even admit the legality of\nfamily possessions. However, there was neither time nor opportunity now\nto enlarge upon the subject. Marguerite resolved to recur to it a little\nlater, when she would be alone with Mlle. de Marny, and above all\nwhen she could take counsel with her husband as to the best means of\nrecovering the young girl's property for her, whilst relieving a devoted\nold man from the dangerous responsibility which he had so selflessly\nundertaken.\n\nIn the meanwhile the two women had reached the first of the long line\nof state apartments wherein the brilliant fete was to take place.\nThe staircase and the hall below were already filled with the early\narrivals. Bidding Juliette to remain in the ballroom, Lady Blakeney now\ntook up her stand on the exquisitely decorated landing, ready to greet\nher guests. She had a smile and a pleasant word for all, as, in a\nconstant stream, the elite of London fashionable society began to file\npast her, exchanging the elaborate greetings which the stilted mode of\nthe day prescribed to this butterfly-world.\n\nThe lacqueys in the hall shouted the names of the guests as they passed\nup the stairs: names celebrated in politics, in worlds of sport, of\nscience or of art, great historic names, humble, newly-made ones, noble\nillustrious titles. The spacious rooms were filling fast. His Royal\nHighness, so 'twas said, had just stepped out of his barge. The noise of\nlaughter and chatter was incessant, like unto a crowd of gaily-plumaged\nbirds. Huge bunches of apricot-coloured roses in silver vases made the\nair heavy with their subtle perfume. Fans began to flutter. The string\nband struck the preliminary cords of the gavotte.\n\nAt that moment the lacqueys at the foot of the stairs called out in\nstentorian tones:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille! and Monsieur Chauvelin!\"\n\nMarguerite's heart gave a slight flutter; she felt a sudden tightening\nof the throat. She did not see Candeille at first, only the slight\nfigure of Chauvelin dressed all in black, as usual, with head bent\nand hands clasped behind his back; he was slowly mounting the wide\nstaircase, between a double row of brilliantly attired men and women,\nwho looked with no small measure of curiosity at the ex-ambassador from\nrevolutionary France.\n\nDemoiselle Candeille was leading the way up the stairs. She paused on\nthe landing in order to make before her hostess a most perfect and most\nelaborate curtsey. She looked smiling and radiant, beautifully dressed,\na small wreath of wrought gold leaves in her hair, her only jewel an\nabsolutely regal one, a magnificent necklace of diamonds round her\nshapely throat.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI: The Challenge\n\n\n\nIt all occurred just before midnight, in one of the smaller rooms, which\nlead in enfilade from the principal ballroom.\n\nDancing had been going on for some time, but the evening was close,\nand there seemed to be a growing desire on the part of Lady Blakeney's\nguests to wander desultorily through the gardens and glasshouses, or sit\nabout where some measure of coolness could be obtained.\n\nThere was a rumour that a new and charming French artiste was to sing a\nfew peculiarly ravishing songs, unheard in England before. Close to\nthe main ballroom was the octagon music-room which was brilliantly\nilluminated, and in which a large number of chairs had been obviously\ndisposed for the comfort of an audience. Into this room many of\nthe guests had already assembled. It was quite clear that a\nchamber-concert--select and attractive as were all Lady Blakeney's\nentertainments--was in contemplation.\n\nMarguerite herself, released for a moment from her constant duties near\nher royal guests, had strolled through the smaller rooms, accompanied by\nJuliette, in order to search for Mademoiselle Candeille and to suggest\nthe commencement of the improvised concert.\n\nDesiree Candeille had kept herself very much aloof throughout the\nevening, only talking to the one or two gentlemen whom her hostess had\npresented to her on her arrival, and with M. Chauvelin always in close\nattendance upon her every movement.\n\nPresently, when dancing began, she retired to a small boudoir, and\nthere sat down, demurely waiting, until Lady Blakeney should require her\nservices.\n\nWhen Marguerite and Juliette Marny entered the little room, she rose and\ncame forward a few steps.\n\n\"I am ready, Madame,\" she said pleasantly, \"whenever you wish me to\nbegin. I have thought out a short programme,--shall I start with the gay\nor the sentimental songs?\"\n\nBut before Marguerite had time to utter a reply, she felt her arm\nnervously clutched by a hot and trembling hand.\n\n\"Who... who is this woman?\" murmured Juliette Marny close to her ear.\n\nThe young girl looked pale and very agitated, and her large eyes were\nfixed in unmistakable wrath upon the French actress before her. A little\nstartled, not understanding Juliette's attitude, Marguerite tried to\nreply lightly:\n\n\"This is Mademoiselle Candeille, Juliette dear,\" she said, affecting\nthe usual formal introduction, \"of the Varietes Theatre of\nParis--Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille, who will sing some charming\nFrench ditties for us to-night.\"\n\nWhile she spoke she kept a restraining hand on Juliette's quivering\narm. Already, with the keen intuition which had been on the qui-vive the\nwhole evening, she scented some mystery in this sudden outburst on the\npart of her young protegee.\n\nBut Juliette did not heed her: she felt surging up in her young,\noverburdened heart all the wrath and the contempt of the persecuted,\nfugitive aristocrat against the triumphant usurper. She had suffered so\nmuch from that particular class of the risen kitchen-wench of which the\nwoman before her was so typical and example: years of sorrow, of poverty\nwere behind her: loss of fortune, of kindred, of friends--she, even now\na pauper, living on the bounty of strangers.\n\nAnd all this through no fault of her own: the fault of her class mayhap!\nbut not hers!\n\nShe had suffered much, and was still overwrought and nerve-strung: for\nsome reason she could not afterwards have explained, she felt spiteful\nand uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury by the look of insolence and\nof triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her.\n\nAfterwards she would willingly have bitten out her tongue for her\nvehemence, but for the moment she was absolutely incapable of checking\nthe torrent of her own emotions.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Candeille, indeed?\" she said in wrathful scorn, \"Desiree\nCandeille, you mean, Lady Blakeney! my mother's kitchen-maid, flaunting\nshamelessly my dear mother's jewels which she has stolen mayhap...\"\n\nThe young girl was trembling from head to foot, tears of anger obscured\nher eyes; her voice, which fortunately remained low--not much above a\nwhisper--was thick and husky.\n\n\"Juliette! Juliette! I entreat you,\" admonished Marguerite, \"you must\ncontrol yourself, you must, indeed you must. Mademoiselle Candeille, I\nbeg of you to retire....\"\n\nBut Candeille--well-schooled in the part she had to play--had no\nintention of quitting the field of battle. The more wrathful and excited\nMademoiselle de Marny became the more insolent and triumphant waxed\nthe young actress' whole attitude. An ironical smile played round the\ncorners of her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes were half-closed, regarding\nthrough dropping lashed the trembling figure of the young impoverished\naristocrat. Her head was thrown well back, in obvious defiance of\nthe social conventions, which should have forbidden a fracas in Lady\nBlakeney's hospitable house, and her fingers provocatively toyed with\nthe diamond necklace which glittered and sparkled round her throat.\n\nShe had no need to repeat the words of a well-learnt part: her own wit,\nher own emotions and feelings helped her to act just as her employer\nwould have wished her to do. Her native vulgarity helped her to assume\nthe very bearing which he would have desired. In fact, at this moment\nDesiree Candeille had forgotten everything save the immediate present: a\nmore than contemptuous snub from one of those penniless aristocrats, who\nhad rendered her own sojourn in London so unpleasant and unsuccessful.\n\nShe had suffered from these snubs before, but had never had the chance\nof forcing an esclandre, as a result of her own humiliation. That spirit\nof hatred for the rich and idle classes, which was so characteristic of\nrevolutionary France, was alive and hot within her: she had never had\nan opportunity--she, the humble fugitive actress from a minor Paris\ntheatre--to retort with forcible taunts to the ironical remarks made at\nand before her by the various poverty-stricken but haughty emigres who\nswarmed in those very same circles of London society into which she\nherself had vainly striven to penetrate.\n\nNow at last, one of this same hated class, provoked beyond self-control,\nwas allowing childish and unreasoning fury to outstrip the usual calm\nirony of aristocratic rebuffs.\n\nJuliette had paused awhile, in order to check the wrathful tears which,\nmuch against her will, were choking the words in her throat and blinding\nher eyes.\n\n\"Hoity! toity!\" laughed Candeille, \"hark at the young baggage!\"\n\nBut Juliette had turned to Marguerite and began explaining volubly:\n\n\"My mother's jewels!\" she said in the midst of her tears, \"ask her\nhow she came by them. When I was obliged to leave the home of my\nfathers,--stolen from me by the Revolutionary Government--I contrived to\nretain my mother's jewels... you remember, I told you just now.... The\nAbbe Foucquet--dear old man! Saved them for me... that and a little\nmoney which I had... he took charge of them... he said he would place\nthem in safety with the ornaments of his church, and now I see them\nround that woman's neck... I know that he would not have parted with\nthem save with his life.\"\n\nAll the while that the young girl spoke in a voice half-choked with\nsobs, Marguerite tried with all the physical and mental will at her\ncommand to drag her out of the room and thus to put a summary ending to\nthis unpleasant scene. She ought to have felt angry with Juliette for\nthis childish and senseless outburst, were it not for the fact that\nsomehow she knew within her innermost heart that all this had been\narranged and preordained: not by Fate--not by a Higher Hand, but by the\nmost skilful intriguer present-day France had ever known.\n\nAnd even now, as she was half succeeding in turning Juliette away from\nthe sight of Candeille, she was not the least surprised or startled\nat seeing Chauvelin standing in the very doorway through which she had\nhoped to pass. One glance at his face had made her fears tangible and\nreal: there was a look of satisfaction and triumph in his pale, narrow\neyes, a flash in them of approbation directed at the insolent attitude\nof the French actress: he looked like the stage-manager of a play,\ncontent with the effect his own well-arranged scenes were producing.\n\nWhat he hoped to gain by this--somewhat vulgar--quarrel between the two\nwomen, Marguerite of course could not guess: that something was lurking\nin his mind, inimical to herself and to her husband, she did not for a\nmoment doubt, and at this moment she felt that she would have given\nher very life to induce Candeille and Juliette to cease this passage of\narms, without further provocation on either side.\n\nBut though Juliette might have been ready to yield to Lady Blakeney's\npersuasion, Desiree Candeille, under Chauvelin's eye, and fired by her\nown desire to further humiliate this overbearing aristocrat, did not\nwish the little scene to end so tamely just yet.\n\n\"Your old calotin was made to part with his booty, m'dear,\" she said,\nwith a contemptuous shrug of her bare shoulders. \"Paris and France have\nbeen starving these many years past: a paternal government seized all\nit could with which to reward those that served it well, whilst all that\nwould have been brought bread and meat for the poor was being greedily\nstowed away by shameless traitors!\"\n\nJuliette winced at the insult.\n\n\"Oh!\" she moaned, as she buried her flaming face in her hands.\n\nToo late now did she realise that she had deliberately stirred up a\nmud-heap and sent noisome insects buzzing about her ears.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Marguerite authoritatively, \"I must ask you to\nremember that Mlle. de Marny is my friend and that you are a guest in my\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Aye! I try not to forget it,\" rejoined Candeille lightly, \"but of a\ntruth you must admit, Citizeness, that it would require the patience\nof a saint to put up with the insolence of a penniless baggage, who but\nlately has had to stand her trial in her own country for impurity of\nconduct.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, whilst Marguerite distinctly heard a\nshort sigh of satisfaction escaping from the lips of Chauvelin. Then a\npleasant laugh broke upon the ears of the four actors who were enacting\nthe dramatic little scene, and Sir Percy Blakeney, immaculate in his\nrich white satin coat and filmy lace ruffles, exquisite in manners and\ncourtesy, entered the little boudoir, and with his long back slightly\nbent, his arm outstretched in a graceful and well-studied curve, he\napproached Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille.\n\n\"May I have the honour,\" he said with his most elaborate air of courtly\ndeference, \"of conducting Mademoiselle to her chaise?\"\n\nIn the doorway just behind him stood His Royal Highness the Prince of\nWales chatting with apparent carelessness to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and\nLord Anthony Dewhurst. A curtain beyond the open door was partially\ndrawn aside, disclosing one or two brilliantly dressed groups, strolling\ndesultorily through the further rooms.\n\nThe four persons assembled in the little boudoir had been so absorbed\nby their own passionate emotions and the violence of their quarrel\nthat they had not noticed the approach of Sir Percy Blakeney and of his\nfriends. Juliette and Marguerite certainly were startled and Candeille\nwas evidently taken unawares. Chauvelin alone seemed quite indifferent\nand stood back a little when Sir Percy advanced, in order to allow him\nto pass.\n\nBut Candeille recovered quickly enough from her surprise: without\nheeding Blakeney's proffered arm, she turned with all the airs of an\ninsulted tragedy queen towards Marguerite.\n\n\"So 'tis I,\" she said with affected calm, \"who am to bear every insult\nin a house in which I was bidden as a guest. I am turned out like some\nintrusive and importunate beggar, and I, the stranger in this land, am\ndestined to find that amidst all these brilliant English gentlemen there\nis not one man of honour.\n\n\"M. Chauvelin,\" she added loudly, \"our beautiful country has, meseems,\ndeputed you to guard the honour as well as the worldly goods of your\nunprotected compatriots. I call upon you, in the name of France, to\navenge the insults offered to me to-night.\"\n\nShe looked round defiantly from one to the other of the several faces\nwhich were now turned towards her, but no one, for the moment, spoke or\nstirred. Juliette, silent and ashamed, had taken Marguerite's hand in\nhers, and was clinging to it as if wishing to draw strength of character\nand firmness of purpose through the pores of the other woman's delicate\nskin.\n\nSir Percy with backbone still bent in a sweeping curve had not relaxed\nhis attitude of uttermost deference. The Prince of Wales and his friends\nwere viewing the scene with slightly amused aloofness.\n\nFor a moment--seconds at most--there was dead silence in the room,\nduring which time it almost seemed as if the beating of several hearts\ncould be distinctly heard.\n\nThen Chauvelin, courtly and urbane, stepped calmly forward.\n\n\"Believe me, Citizeness,\" he said, addressing Candeille directly and\nwith marked emphasis, \"I am entirely at your command, but am I not\nhelpless, seeing that those who have so grossly insulted you are of your\nown irresponsible, if charming, sex?\"\n\nLike a great dog after a nap, Sir Percy Blakeney straightened his long\nback and stretched it out to its full length.\n\n\"La!\" he said pleasantly, \"my ever engaging friend from Calais. Sir,\nyour servant. Meseems we are ever destined to discuss amiable matters,\nin an amiable spirit.... A glass of punch, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"I must ask you, Sir Percy,\" rejoined Chauvelin sternly, \"to view this\nmatter with becoming seriousness.\"\n\n\"Seriousness is never becoming, sir,\" said Blakeney, politely smothering\na slight yawn, \"and it is vastly unbecoming in the presence of ladies.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand then, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, \"that you are\nprepared to apologize to Mademoiselle Candeille for this insult offered\nto her by Lady Blakeney?\"\n\nSir Percy again tried to smother that tiresome little yawn, which seemed\nmost distressing, when he desired to be most polite. Then he flicked\noff a grain of dust from his immaculate lace ruffle and buried his long,\nslender hands in the capacious pockets of his white satin breeches;\nfinally he said with the most good-natured of smiles:\n\n\"Sir, have you seen the latest fashion in cravats? I would wish to\ndraw your attention to the novel way in which we in England tie a\nMechlin-edged bow.\"\n\n\"Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin firmly, \"since you will not offer\nMademoiselle Candeille the apology which she has the right to expect\nfrom you, are you prepared that you and I should cross swords like\nhonourable gentlemen?\"\n\nBlakeney laughed his usual pleasant, somewhat shy laugh, shook his\npowerful frame and looked from his altitude of six feet three inches\ndown on the small, sable-clad figure of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.\n\n\"The question is, sir,\" he said slowly, \"should we then be two\nhonourable gentlemen crossing swords?\"\n\n\"Sir Percy...\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nChauvelin, who for one moment had seemed ready to lose his temper,\nnow made a sudden effort to resume a calm and easy attitude and said\nquietly:\n\n\"Of course, if one of us is coward enough to shirk the contest...\"\n\nHe did not complete the sentence, but shrugged his shoulders expressive\nof contempt. The other side of the curtained doorway a little crowd had\ngradually assembled, attracted hither by the loud and angry voices which\ncame from that small boudoir. Host and hostess had been missed from the\nreception rooms for some time, His Royal Highness, too, had not been\nseen for the quarter of an hour: like flies attracted by the light, one\nby one, or in small isolated groups, some of Lady Blakeney's quests had\nfound their way to the room adjoining the royal presence.\n\nAs His Highness was standing in the doorway itself, no one could of\ncourse cross the threshold, but everyone could see into the room, and\ncould take stock of the various actors in the little comedy. They were\nwitnessing a quarrel between the French envoy and Sir Percy Blakeney\nwherein the former was evidently in deadly earnest and the latter merely\npolitely bored. Amused comments flew to and fro: laughter and a babel of\nirresponsible chatter made an incessant chirruping accompaniment to the\nduologue between the two men.\n\nBut at this stage, the Prince of Wales, who hitherto had seemingly kept\naloof from the quarrel, suddenly stepped forward and abruptly interposed\nthe weight of his authority and of his social position between the\nbickering adversaries.\n\n\"Tush, man!\" he said impatiently, turning more especially towards\nChauvelin, \"you talk at random. Sir Percy Blakeney is an English\ngentleman, and the laws of this country do not admit of duelling, as you\nunderstand it in France; and I for one certainly could not allow...\"\n\n\"Pardon, your Royal Highness,\" interrupted Sir Percy with irresistible\nbonhomie, \"your Highness does not understand the situation. My engaging\nfriend here does not propose that I should transgress the laws of this\ncountry, but that I should go over to France with him, and fight him\nthere, where duelling and... er... other little matters of that sort are\nallowed.\"\n\n\"Yes! quite so!\" rejoined the Prince, \"I understand M. Chauvelin's\ndesire. ... But what about you, Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Sir Percy lightly, \"I have accepted his challenge, of\ncourse!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII: Time--Place--Conditions\n\n\n\nIt would be very difficult indeed to say why--at Blakeney's lightly\nspoken words--an immediate silence should have fallen upon all those\npresent. All the actors in the little drawing-room drama, who had played\ntheir respective parts so unerringly up to now, had paused a while, just\nas if an invisible curtain had come down, marking the end of a scene,\nand the interval during which the players might recover strength and\nenergy to resume their roles. The Prince of Wales as foremost spectator\nsaid nothing for the moment, and beyond the doorway, the audience there\nassembled seemed suddenly to be holding its breath, waiting--eager,\nexpectant, palpitation--for what would follow now.\n\nOnly here and there the gentle frou-frou of a silk skirt, the rhythmic\nflutter of a fan, broke those few seconds' deadly, stony silence.\n\nYet it was all simple enough. A fracas between two ladies, the gentlemen\ninterposing, a few words of angry expostulation, then the inevitable\nsuggestion of Belgium or of some other country where the childish and\nbarbarous custom of settling such matters with a couple of swords had\nnot been as yet systematically stamped out.\n\nThe whole scene--with but slight variations--had occurred scores of\ntimes in London drawing-rooms, English gentlemen had scores of times\ncrossed the Channel for the purpose of settling similar quarrels in\ncontinental fashion.\n\nWhy should the present situation appear so abnormal? Sir Percy\nBlakeney--an accomplished gentleman--was past master in the art of\nfence, and looked more than a match in strength and dexterity for the\nmeagre, sable-clad little opponent who had so summarily challenged him\nto cross over to France, in order to fight a duel.\n\nBut somehow everyone had a feeling at this moment that this proposed\nduel would be unlike any other combat every fought between two\nantagonists. Perhaps it was the white, absolutely stony and unexpressive\nface of Marguerite which suggested a latent tragedy: perhaps it was the\nlook of unmistakable horror in Juliette's eyes, or that of triumph\nin those of Chauvelin, or even that certain something in His Royal\nHighness' face, which seemed to imply that the Prince, careless man of\nthe world as he was, would have given much to prevent this particular\nmeeting from taking place.\n\nBe that as it may, there is no doubt that a certain wave of electrical\nexcitement swept over the little crowd assembled there, the while\nthe chief actor in the little drama, the inimitable dandy, Sir Percy\nBlakeney himself, appeared deeply engrossed in removing a speck of\npowder from the wide black satin ribbon which held his gold-rimmed\neyeglass.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" said His Royal Highness suddenly, \"we are forgetting the\nladies. My lord Hastings,\" he added, turning to one of the gentlemen\nwho stood close to him, \"I pray you to remedy this unpardonable neglect.\nMen's quarrels are not fit for ladies' dainty ears.\"\n\nSir Percy looked up from his absorbing occupation. His eyes met those\nof his wife; she was like a marble statue, hardly conscious of what was\ngoing on round her. But he, who knew every emotion which swayed that\nardent and passionate nature, guessed that beneath that stony calm there\nlay a mad, almost unconquerable impulse: and that was to shout to all\nthese puppets here, the truth, the awful, the unanswerable truth, to\ntell them what this challenge really meant; a trap wherein one man\nconsumed with hatred and desire for revenge hoped to entice a brave and\nfearless foe into a death-dealing snare.\n\nFull well did Percy Blakeney guess that for the space of one second\nhis most cherished secret hovered upon his wife's lips, one turn of\nthe balance of Fate, one breath from the mouth of an unseen sprite, and\nMarguerite was ready to shout:\n\n\"Do not allow this monstrous thing to be! The Scarlet Pimpernel, whom\nyou all admire for his bravery, and love for his daring, stands before\nyou now, face to face with his deadliest enemy, who is here to lure him\nto his doom!\"\n\nFor that momentous second therefore Percy Blakeney held his wife's\ngaze with the magnetism of his own; all there was in him of love, of\nentreaty, of trust, and of command went out to her through that look\nwith which he kept her eyes riveted upon his face.\n\nThen he saw the rigidity of her attitude relax. She closed her eyes in\norder to shut out the whole world from her suffering soul. She seemed\nto be gathering all the mental force of which her brain was capable, for\none great effort of self-control. Then she took Juliette's hand in hers,\nand turned to go out of the room; the gentlemen bowed as she swept past\nthem, her rich silken gown making a soft hush-sh-sh as she went. She\nnodded to some, curtseyed to the Prince, and had at the last moment\nthe supreme courage and pride to turn her head once more towards her\nhusband, in order to reassure him finally that his secret was as safe\nwith her now, in this hour of danger, as it had been in the time of\ntriumph.\n\nShe smiled and passed out of his sight, preceded by Desiree Candeille,\nwho, escorted by one of the gentlemen, had become singularly silent and\nsubdued.\n\nIn the little room now there only remained a few men. Sir Andrew\nFfoulkes had taken the precaution of closing the door after the ladies\nhad gone.\n\nThen His Royal Highness turned once more to Monsieur Chauvelin and said\nwith an obvious show of indifference:\n\n\"Faith, Monsieur! meseems we are all enacting a farce, which can have\nno final act. I vow that I cannot allow my friend Blakeney to go over to\nFrance at your bidding. Your government now will not allow my father's\nsubjects to land on your shores without a special passport, and then\nonly for a specific purpose.\"\n\n\"La, your Royal Highness,\" interposed Sir Percy, \"I pray you have no\nfear for me on that score. My engaging friend here has--an I mistake\nnot--a passport ready for me in the pocket of his sable-hued coat, and\nas we are hoping effectually to spit one another over there... gadzooks!\nbut there's the specific purpose.... Is it not true, sir,\" he added,\nturning once more to Chauvelin, \"that in the pocket of that exquisitely\ncut coat of yours, you have a passport--name in blank perhaps--which you\nhad specially designed for me?\"\n\nIt was so carelessly, so pleasantly said, that no one save Chauvelin\nguessed the real import of Sir Percy's words. Chauvelin, of course, knew\ntheir inner meaning: he understood that Blakeney wished to convey to him\nthe fact that he was well aware that the whole scene to-night had been\nprearranged, and that it was willingly and with eyes wide open that he\nwalked into the trap which the revolutionary patriot had so carefully\nlaid for him.\n\n\"The passport will be forthcoming in due course, sir,\" retorted\nChauvelin evasively, \"when our seconds have arranged all formalities.\"\n\n\"Seconds be demmed, sir,\" rejoined Sir Percy placidly, \"you do not\npropose, I trust, that we travel a whole caravan to France.\"\n\n\"Time, place and conditions must be settled, Sir Percy,\" replied\nChauvelin; \"you are too accomplished a cavalier, I feel sure, to wish to\narrange such formalities yourself.\"\n\n\"Nay! neither you nor I, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin,\" quoth Sir Percy\nblandly, \"could, I own, settle such things with persistent good-humour;\nand good-humour in such cases is the most important of all formalities.\nIs it not so?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Sir Percy.\"\n\n\"As for seconds? Perish the thought. One second only, I entreat, and\nthat one a lady--the most adorable--the most detestable--the most\ntrue--the most fickle amidst all her charming sex.... Do you agree,\nsir?\"\n\n\"You have not told me her name, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Chance, Monsieur, Chance.... With His Royal Highness' permission let\nthe wilful jade decide.\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Three throws of the dice, Monsieur.... Time... Place... Conditions, you\nsaid--three throws and the winner names them.... Do you agree?\"\n\nChauvelin hesitated. Sir Percy's bantering mood did not quite fit\nin with his own elaborate plans, moreover the ex-ambassador feared\na pitfall of some sort, and did not quite like to trust to this\narbitration of the dice-box.\n\nHe turned, quite involuntarily, in appeal to the Prince of Wales and the\nother gentlemen present.\n\nBut the Englishman of those days was a born gambler. He lived with the\ndice-box in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other. The Prince\nhimself was no exception to this rule, and the first gentleman in\nEngland was the most avowed worshipper of Hazard in the land.\n\n\"Chance, by all means,\" quoth His Highness gaily.\n\n\"Chance! Chance!\" repeated the others eagerly.\n\nIn the midst of so hostile a crowd, Chauvelin felt it unwise to resist.\nMoreover, one second's reflection had already assured him that this\nthrowing of the dice could not seriously interfere with the success of\nhis plans. If the meeting took place at all--and Sir Percy now had gone\ntoo far to draw back--then of necessity it would have to take place in\nFrance.\n\nThe question of time and conditions of the fight, which at best would\nbe only a farce--only a means to an end--could not be of paramount\nimportance.\n\nTherefore he shrugged his shoulders with well-marked indifference, and\nsaid lightly:\n\n\"As you please.\"\n\nThere was a small table in the centre of the room with a settee and two\nor three chairs arranged close to it. Around this table now an eager\nlittle group had congregated: the Prince of Wales in the forefront,\nunwilling to interfere, scarce knowing what madcap plans were floating\nthrough Blakeney's adventurous brain, but excited in spite of himself at\nthis momentous game of hazard the issues of which seemed so nebulous,\nso vaguely fraught with dangers. Close to him were Sir Andrew Ffoulkes,\nLord Anthony Dewhurst, Lord Grenville and perhaps a half score\ngentlemen, young men about town mostly, gay and giddy butterflies of\nfashion, who did not even attempt to seek in this strange game of chance\nany hidden meaning save that it was one of Blakeney's irresponsible\npranks.\n\nAnd in the centre of the compact group, Sir Percy Blakeney in his\ngorgeous suit of shimmering white satin, one knee bent upon a chair, and\nleaning with easy grace--dice-box in hand--across the small gilt-legged\ntable; beside him ex-Ambassador Chauvelin, standing with arms folded\nbehind his back, watching every movement of his brilliant adversary like\nsome dark-plumaged hawk hovering near a bird of paradise.\n\n\"Place first, Monsieur?\" suggested Sir Percy.\n\n\"As you will, sir,\" assented Chauvelin.\n\nHe took up a dice-box which one of the gentlemen handed to him and the\ntwo men threw.\n\n\"'Tis mine, Monsieur,\" said Blakeney carelessly, \"mine to name the place\nwhere shall occur this historic encounter, 'twixt the busiest man\nin France and the most idle fop that e'er disgraced these three\nkingdoms.... Just for the sake of argument, sir, what place would you\nsuggest?\"\n\n\"Oh! the exact spot is immaterial, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin coldly,\n\"the whole of France stands at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Aye! I thought as much, but could not be quite sure of such boundless\nhospitality,\" retorted Blakeney imperturbably.\n\n\"Do you care for the woods around Paris, sir?\"\n\n\"Too far from the coast, sir. I might be sea-sick crossing over the\nChannel, and glad to get the business over as soon as possible.... No,\nnot Paris, sir--rather let us say Boulogne.... Pretty little place,\nBoulogne... do you not think so...?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, Sir Percy.\"\n\n\"Then Boulogne it is.. the ramparts, an you will, on the south side of\nthe town.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily. \"Shall we throw again?\"\n\nA murmur of merriment had accompanied this brief colloquy between the\nadversaries, and Blakeney's bland sallies were received with shouts of\nlaughter. Now the dice rattled again and once more the two men threw.\n\n\"'Tis yours this time, Monsieur Chauvelin,\" said Blakeney, after a rapid\nglance at the dice. \"See how evenly Chance favours us both. Mine, the\nchoice of place... admirably done you'll confess.... Now yours the\nchoice of time. I wait upon your pleasure, sir.... The southern ramparts\nat Boulogne--when?\"\n\n\"The fourth day from this, sir, at the hour when the Cathedral bell\nchimes the evening Angelus,\" came Chauvelin's ready reply.\n\n\"Nay! but methought that your demmed government had abolished\nCathedrals, and bells and chimes.... The people of France have now to\ngo to hell their own way... for the way to heaven has been barred by\nthe National Convention.... Is that not so?... Methought the Angelus was\nforbidden to be rung.\"\n\n\"Not at Boulogne, I think, Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, \"and\nI'll pledge you my word that the evening Angelus shall be rung that\nnight.\"\n\n\"At what hour is that, sir?\"\n\n\"One hour after sundown.\"\n\n\"But why four days after this? Why not two or three?\"\n\n\"I might have asked, why the southern ramparts, Sir Percy; why not the\nwestern? I chose the fourth day--does it not suit you?\" asked Chauvelin\nironically.\n\n\"Suit me! Why, sir, nothing could suit me better,\" rejoined Blakeney\nwith his pleasant laugh. \"Zounds! but I call it marvellous... demmed\nmarvellous... I wonder now,\" he added blandly, \"what made you think of\nthe Angelus?\"\n\nEveryone laughed at this, a little irrelevantly perhaps.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued Blakeney gaily, \"I remember now.... Faith! to think that\nI was nigh forgetting that when last you and I met, sir, you had just\ntaken or were about to take Holy Orders.... Ah! how well the thought\nof the Angelus fits in with your clerical garb.... I recollect that the\nlatter was mightily becoming to you, sir...\"\n\n\"Shall we proceed to settle the conditions of the fight, Sir Percy?\"\nsaid Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's gibes, and\ntrying to disguise his irritation beneath a mask of impassive reserve.\n\n\"The choice of weapons you mean,\" here interposed His Royal Highness,\n\"but I thought that swords had already been decided on.\"\n\n\"Quite so, your Highness,\" assented Blakeney, \"but there are various\nlittle matters in connection with this momentous encounter which are of\nvast importance.... Am I not right, Monsieur?... Gentlemen, I appeal to\nyou.... Faith! one never knows... my engaging opponent here might desire\nthat I should fight him in green socks, and I that he should wear a\nscarlet flower in his coat.\"\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Why not, Monsieur? It would look so well in your buttonhole, against\nthe black of the clerical coat, which I understand you sometime affect\nin France... and when it is withered and quite dead you would find that\nit would leave an overpowering odour in your nostrils, far stronger than\nthat of incense.\"\n\nThere was general laughter after this. The hatred which every member of\nthe French revolutionary government--including, of course, ex-Ambassador\nChauvelin--bore to the national hero was well known.\n\n\"The conditions then, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, without seeming to\nnotice the taunt conveyed in Blakeney's last words. \"Shall we throw\nagain?\"\n\n\"After you, sir,\" acquiesced Sir Percy.\n\nFor the third and last time the two opponents rattled the dice-box and\nthrew. Chauvelin was now absolutely unmoved. These minor details quite\nfailed to interest him. What mattered the conditions of the fight which\nwas only intended as a bait with which to lure his enemy in the open?\nThe hour and place were decided on and Sir Percy would not fail to come.\nChauvelin knew enough of his opponent's boldly adventurous spirit not\nto feel in the least doubtful on that point. Even now, as he gazed with\ngrudging admiration at the massive, well-knit figure of his arch-enemy,\nnoted the thin nervy hands and square jaw, the low, broad forehead and\ndeep-set, half-veiled eyes, he knew that in this matter wherein Percy\nBlakeney was obviously playing with his very life, the only emotion that\nreally swayed him at this moment was his passionate love of adventure.\n\nThe ruling passion strong in death!\n\nYes! Sir Percy would be on the southern ramparts of Boulogne one\nhour after sunset on the day named, trusting, no doubt, in his usual\nmarvellous good-fortune, his own presence of mind and his great physical\nand mental strength, to escape from the trap into which he was so ready\nto walk.\n\nThat remained beyond a doubt! Therefore what mattered details?\n\nBut even at this moment, Chauvelin had already resolved on one great\nthing: namely, that on that eventful day, nothing whatever should be\nleft to Chance; he would meet his cunning enemy not only with cunning,\nbut also with power, and if the entire force of the republican army\nthen available in the north of France had to be requisitioned for the\npurpose, the ramparts of Boulogne would be surrounded and no chance of\nescape left for the daring Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nHis wave of meditation, however, was here abruptly stemmed by Blakeney's\npleasant voice.\n\n\"Lud! Monsieur Chauvelin,\" he said, \"I fear me your luck has deserted\nyou. Chance, as you see, has turned to me once more.\"\n\n\"Then it is for you, Sir Percy,\" rejoined the Frenchman, \"to name the\nconditions under which we are to fight.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is so, is it not, Monsieur?\" quoth Sir Percy lightly. \"By my\nfaith! I'll not plague you with formalities.... We'll fight with our\ncoats on if it be cold, in our shirtsleeves if it be sultry.... I'll\nnot demand either green socks or scarlet ornaments. I'll even try and\nbe serious for the space of two minutes, sir, and confine my whole\nattention--the product of my infinitesimal brain--to thinking out some\npleasant detail for this duel, which might be acceptable to you. Thus,\nsir, the thought of weapons springs to my mind.... Swords you said, I\nthink. Sir! I will e'en restrict my choice of conditions to that of the\nactual weapons with which we are to fight.... Ffoulkes, I pray you,\" he\nadded, turning to his friend, \"the pair of swords which lie across the\ntop of my desk at this moment....\n\n\"We'll not ask a menial to fetch them, eh, Monsieur?\" he continued\ngaily, as Sir Andrew Ffoulkes at a sign from him had quickly left the\nroom. \"What need to bruit our pleasant quarrel abroad? You will like the\nweapons, sir, and you shall have your own choice from the pair.... You\nare a fine fencer, I feel sure... and you shall decide if a scratch or\ntwo or a more serious wound shall be sufficient to avenge Mademoiselle\nCandeille's wounded vanity.\"\n\nWhilst he prattled so gaily on, there was dead silence among all\nthose present. The Prince had his shrewd eyes steadily fixed upon him,\nobviously wondering what this seemingly irresponsible adventurer held\nat the back of his mind. There is no doubt that everyone felt oppressed,\nand that a strange murmur of anticipatory excitement went round the\nlittle room, when, a few seconds later, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes returned,\nwith two sheathed swords in his hand.\n\nBlakeney took them from his friend and placed them on the little table\nin front of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin. The spectators strained their necks\nto look at the two weapons. They were exactly similar one to the\nother: both encased in plain black leather sheaths, with steel ferrules\npolished to shine like silver; the handles too were of plain steel,\nwith just the grip fashioned in a twisted basket pattern of the same\nhighly-tempered metal.\n\n\"What think you of these weapons, Monsieur?\" asked Blakeney, who was\ncarelessly leaning against the back of a chair.\n\nChauvelin took up one of the two swords and slowly drew it from out its\nscabbard, carefully examining the brilliant, narrow steel blade as he\ndid so.\n\n\"A little old-fashioned in style and make, Sir Percy,\" he said, closely\nimitating his opponent's easy demeanour, \"a trifle heavier, perhaps,\nthan we in France have been accustomed to lately, but, nevertheless, a\nbeautifully tempered piece of steel.\"\n\n\"Of a truth there's not much the matter with the tempering, Monsieur,\"\nquoth Blakeney, \"the blades were fashioned at Toledo just two hundred\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"Ah! here I see an inscription,\" said Chauvelin, holding the sword close\nto his eyes, the better to see the minute letters engraved in the steel.\n\n\"The name of the original owner. I myself bought them--when I travelled\nin Italy--from one of his descendants.\"\n\n\"Lorenzo Giovanni Cenci,\" said Chauvelin, spelling the Italian names\nquite slowly.\n\n\"The greatest blackguard that ever trod this earth. You, no doubt,\nMonsieur, know his history better than we do. Rapine, theft, murder,\nnothing came amiss to Signor Lorenzo... neither the deadly drug in the\ncup nor the poisoned dagger.\"\n\nHe had spoken lightly, carelessly, with that same tone of easy banter\nwhich he had not forsaken throughout the evening, and the same drawly\nmanner which was habitual to him. But at these last words of his,\nChauvelin gave a visible start, and then abruptly replaced the\nsword--which he had been examining--upon the table.\n\nHe threw a quick, suspicious glance at Blakeney, who, leaning back\nagainst the chair and one knee resting on the cushioned seat, was\nidly toying with the other blade, the exact pair to the one which the\nex-ambassador had so suddenly put down.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur,\" quoth Sir Percy after a slight pause, and meeting\nwith a swift glance of lazy irony his opponent's fixed gaze. \"Are you\nsatisfied with the weapons? Which of the two shall be yours, and which\nmine?\"\n\n\"Of a truth, Sir Percy...\" murmured Chauvelin, still hesitating.\n\n\"Nay, Monsieur,\" interrupted Blakeney with pleasant bonhomie, \"I know\nwhat you would say... of a truth, there is no choice between this pair\nof perfect twins: one is as exquisite as the other.... And yet you must\ntake one and I the other... this or that, whichever you prefer....\nYou shall take it home with you to-night and practise thrusting at a\nhaystack or at a bobbin, as you please... The sword is yours to command\nuntil you have used it against my unworthy person... yours until you\nbring it out four days hence--on the southern ramparts of Boulogne, when\nthe cathedral bells chime the evening Angelus; then you shall cross\nit against its faithless twin.... There, Monsieur--they are of equal\nlength... of equal strength and temper... a perfect pair... Yet I pray\nyou choose.\"\n\nHe took up both the swords in his hands and carefully balancing them by\nthe extreme tip of their steel-bound scabbards, he held them out towards\nthe Frenchman. Chauvelin's eyes were fixed upon him, and he from his\ntowering height was looking down at the little sable-clad figure before\nhim.\n\nThe Terrorist seemed uncertain what to do. Though he was one of\nthose men whom by the force of their intellect, the strength of their\nenthusiasm, the power of their cruelty, had built a new anarchical\nFrance, had overturned a throne and murdered a king, yet now, face to\nface with this affected fop, this lazy and debonnair adventurer, he\nhesitated--trying in vain to read what was going on behind that low,\nsmooth forehead or within the depth of those lazy, blue eyes.\n\nHe would have given several years of his life at this moment for one\nshort glimpse into the innermost brain cells of this daring mind, to see\nthe man start, quiver but for the fraction of a second, betray himself\nby a tremor of the eyelid. What counterplan was lurking in Percy\nBlakeney's head, as he offered to his opponent the two swords which had\nonce belonged to Lorenzo Cenci?\n\nDid any thought of foul play, of dark and deadly poisonings linger in\nthe fastidious mind of this accomplished gentleman?\n\nSurely not!\n\nChauvelin tried to chide himself for such fears. It seemed madness even\nto think of Italian poisons, of the Cencis or the Borgias in the midst\nof this brilliantly lighted English drawing-room.\n\nBut because he was above all a diplomatist, a fencer with words and with\nlooks, the envoy of France determined to know, to probe and to read. He\nforced himself once more to careless laughter and nonchalance of manner\nand schooled his lips to smile up with gentle irony at the good-humoured\nface of his arch-enemy.\n\nHe tapped one of the swords with his long pointed finger.\n\n\"Is this the one you choose, sir?\" asked Blakeney.\n\n\"Nay! which do you advise, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin lightly. \"Which\nof those two blades think you is most like to hold after two hundred\nyears the poison of the Cenci?\"\n\nBut Blakeney neither started nor winced. He broke into a laugh, his own\nusual pleasant laugh, half shy and somewhat inane, then said in tones of\nlively astonishment:\n\n\"Zounds! sir, but you are full of surprises.... Faith! I never would\nhave thought of that....Marvellous, I call it... demmed marvellous....\nWhat say you, gentlemen?... Your Royal Highness, what think you?... Is\nnot my engaging friend here of a most original turn of mind.... Will you\nhave this sword or that, Monsieur?... Nay, I must insist--else we shall\nweary our friends if we hesitate too long.... This one then, sir, since\nyou have chosen it,\" he continued, as Chauvelin finally took one of\nthe swords in his hand. \"And now for a bowl of punch.... Nay, Monsieur,\n'twas demmed smart what you said just now... I must insist on your\njoining us in a bowl.... Such wit as yours, Monsieur, must need whetting\nat times. ... I pray you repeat that same sally again...\"\n\nThen finally turning to the Prince and to his friends, he added:\n\n\"And after that bowl, gentlemen, shall we rejoin the ladies?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII: Reflections\n\n\n\nIt seemed indeed as if the incident were finally closed, the chief\nactors in the drama having deliberately vacated the centre of the stage.\n\nThe little crowd which had stood in a compact mass round the table,\nbegan to break up into sundry small groups: laughter and desultory talk,\nchecked for a moment by that oppressive sense of unknown danger, which\nhad weighed on the spirits of those present, once more became general.\nBlakeney's light-heartedness had put everyone into good-humour; since he\nevidently did not look upon the challenge as a matter of serious moment,\nwhy then, no one else had any cause for anxiety, and the younger men\nwere right glad to join in that bowl of punch which their genial host\nhad offered with so merry a grace.\n\nLacqueys appeared, throwing open the doors. From a distance the sound of\ndance music once more broke upon the ear.\n\nA few of the men only remained silent, deliberately holding aloof from\nthe renewed mirthfulness. Foremost amongst these was His Royal Highness,\nwho was looking distinctly troubled, and who had taken Sir Percy by\nthe arm, and was talking to him with obvious earnestness. Lord Anthony\nDewhurst and Lord Hastings were holding converse in a secluded corner of\nthe room, whilst Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, as being the host's most intimate\nfriend, felt it incumbent on him to say a few words to ex-Ambassador\nChauvelin.\n\nThe latter was desirous of effecting a retreat. Blakeney's invitation to\njoin in the friendly bowl of punch could not be taken seriously, and the\nTerrorist wanted to be alone, in order to think out the events of the\npast hour.\n\nA lacquey waited on him, took the momentous sword from his hand, found\nhis hat and cloak and called his coach for him: Chauvelin having taken\nformal leave of his host and acquaintances, quickly worked his way to\nthe staircase and hall, through the less frequented apartments.\n\nHe sincerely wished to avoid meeting Lady Blakeney face to face. Not\nthat the slightest twinge of remorse disturbed his mind, but he feared\nsome impulsive action on her part, which indirectly might interfere with\nhis future plans. Fortunately no one took much heed of the darkly-clad,\ninsignificant little figure that glided so swiftly by, obviously\ndetermined to escape attention.\n\nIn the hall he found Demoiselle Candeille waiting for him. She, too, had\nevidently been desirous of leaving Blakeney Manor as soon as possible.\nHe saw her to her chaise; then escorted her as far as her lodgings,\nwhich were close by: there were still one or two things which he wished\nto discuss with her, one or two final instructions which he desired to\ngive.\n\nOne the whole, he was satisfied with his evening's work: the young\nactress had well supported him, and had played her part so far with\nmarvellous sang-froid and skill. Sir Percy, whether willingly or\nblindly, had seemed only too ready to walk into the trap which was being\nset for him.\n\nThis fact alone disturbed Chauvelin not a little, and as half an hour\nor so later, having taken final leave of his ally, he sat alone in the\ncoach, which was conveying him back to town, the sword of Lorenzo Cenci\nclose to his hand, he pondered very seriously over it.\n\nThat the adventurous Scarlet Pimpernel should have guessed all along,\nthat sooner or later the French Revolutionary Government--whom he had\ndefrauded of some of its most important victims,--would desire to be\neven with him, and to bring him to the scaffold, was not to be wondered\nat. But that he should be so blind as to imagine that Chauvelin's\nchallenge was anything else but a lure to induce him to go to France,\ncould not possibly be supposed. So bold an adventurer, so keen an\nintriguer was sure to have scented the trap immediately, and if he\nappeared ready to fall into it, it was because there had already sprung\nup in his resourceful mind some bold coup or subtle counterplan, with\nwhich he hoped to gratify his own passionate love of sport, whilst once\nmore bringing his enemies to discomfiture and humiliation.\n\nUndoubtedly Sir Percy Blakeney, as an accomplished gentleman of the\nperiod, could not very well under the circumstances which had been so\ncarefully stage-managed and arranged by Chauvelin, refuse the latter's\nchallenge to fight him on the other side of the Channel. Any hesitation\non the part of the leader of that daring Scarlet Pimpernel League would\nhave covered him with a faint suspicion of pusillanimity, and a subtle\nbreath of ridicule, and in a moment the prestige of the unknown and\nelusive hero would have vanished forever.\n\nBut apart from the necessity of the fight, Blakeney seemed to enter\ninto the spirit of the plot directed against his own life, with such\nlight-hearted merriment, such zest and joy, that Chauvelin could not\nhelp but be convinced that the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel at\nBoulogne or elsewhere would not prove quite so easy a matter as he had\nat first anticipated.\n\nThat same night he wrote a long and circumstantial letter to his\ncolleague, Citizen Robespierre, shifting thereby, as it were, some of\nthe responsibility of coming events from his own shoulders on to the\nexecutive of the Committee of Public Safety.\n\n\"I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre,\" he wrote, \"and to the members\nof the Revolutionary Government who have entrusted me with the delicate\nmission, that four days from this date at one hour after sunset, the man\nwho goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel, will be on the\nramparts of Boulogne on the south side of the town. I have done what has\nbeen asked of me. On that day and at that hour, I shall have brought\nthe enemy of the Revolution, the intriguer against the policy of the\nrepublic, within the power of the government which he has flouted and\noutraged. Now look to it, citizens all, that the fruits of my diplomacy\nand of my skill be not lost to France again. The man will be there at my\nbidding, 'tis for you to see that he does not escape this time.\"\n\nThis letter he sent by special courier which the National Convention\nhad placed at his disposal in case of emergency. Having sealed it and\nentrusted it to the man, Chauvelin felt at peace with the world and with\nhimself. Although he was not so sure of success as he would have wished,\nhe yet could not see _how_ failure could possibly come about: and the\nonly regret which he felt to-night, when he finally in the early dawn\nsought a few hours' troubled rest, was that that momentous fourth day\nwas still so very far distant.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV: The Ruling Passion\n\n\n\nIn the meanwhile silence had fallen over the beautiful old manorial\nhouse. One by one the guests had departed, leaving that peaceful sense\nof complete calm and isolation which follows the noisy chatter of any\ngreat throng bent chiefly on enjoyment.\n\nThe evening had been universally acknowledged to have been brilliantly\nsuccessful. True, the much talked of French artiste had not sung the\npromised ditties, but in the midst of the whirl and excitement of\ndances, of the inspiring tunes of the string band, the elaborate supper\nand recherche wines, no one had paid much heed to this change in the\nprogramme of entertainments.\n\nAnd everyone had agreed that never had Lady Blakeney looked more\nradiantly beautiful than on this night. She seemed absolutely\nindefatigable; a perfect hostess, full of charming little attentions\ntowards every one, although more than ordinarily absorbed by her duties\ntowards her many royal guests.\n\nThe dramatic incidents which had taken place in the small boudoir had\nnot been much bruited abroad. It was always considered bad form in\nthose courtly days to discuss men's quarrels before ladies, and in this\ninstance, those who were present when it all occurred instinctively felt\nthat their discretion would be appreciated in high circles, and held\ntheir tongues accordingly.\n\nThus the brilliant evening was brought to a happy conclusion without a\nsingle cloud to mar the enjoyment of the guests. Marguerite performed a\nveritable miracle of fortitude, forcing her very smiles to seem natural\nand gay, chatting pleasantly, even wittily, upon every known fashionable\ntopic of the day, laughing merrily the while her poor, aching heart was\nfilled with unspeakable misery.\n\nNow, when everybody had gone, when the last of her guests had bobbed\nbefore her the prescribed curtsey, to which she had invariably responded\nwith the same air of easy self-possession, now at last she felt free to\ngive rein to her thoughts, to indulge in the luxury of looking her own\nanxiety straight in the face and to let the tension of her nerves relax.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes had been the last to leave and Percy had strolled\nout with him as far as the garden gate, for Lady Ffoulkes had left in\nher chaise some time ago, and Sir Andrew meant to walk to his home, not\nmany yards distant from Blakeney Manor.\n\nIn spite of herself Marguerite felt her heartstrings tighten as she\nthought of this young couple so lately wedded. People smiled a\nlittle when Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' name was mentioned, some called him\neffeminate, others uxorious, his fond attachment for his pretty little\nwife was thought to pass the bounds of decorum. There was no doubt that\nsince his marriage the young man had greatly changed. His love of sport\nand adventure seemed to have died out completely, yielding evidently to\nthe great, more overpowering love, that for his young wife.\n\nSuzanne was nervous for her husband's safety. She had sufficient\ninfluence over him to keep him at home, when other members of the brave\nlittle League of The Scarlet Pimpernel followed their leader with mad\nzest, on some bold adventure.\n\nMarguerite too at first had smiled in kindly derision when Suzanne\nFfoulkes, her large eyes filled with tears, had used her wiles to keep\nSir Andrew tied to her own dainty apronstrings. But somehow, lately,\nwith that gentle contempt which she felt for the weaker man, there had\nmingled a half-acknowledged sense of envy.\n\nHow different 'twixt her and her husband.\n\nPercy loved her truly and with a depth of passion proportionate to his\nown curious dual personality: it were sacrilege, almost, to doubt the\nintensity of his love. But nevertheless she had at all times a feeling\nas if he were holding himself and his emotions in check, as if his love,\nas if she, Marguerite, his wife, were but secondary matters in his life;\nas if her anxieties, her sorrow when he left her, her fears for his\nsafety were but small episodes in the great book of life which he had\nplanned out and conceived for himself.\n\nThen she would hate herself for such thoughts: they seemed like doubts\nof him. Did any man ever love a woman, she asked herself, as Percy loved\nher? He was difficult to understand, and perhaps--oh! that was an awful\n\"perhaps\"--perhaps there lurked somewhere in his mind a slight mistrust\nof her. She had betrayed him once! unwittingly 'tis true! did he fear\nshe might do so again?\n\nAnd to-night after her guests had gone she threw open the great windows\nthat gave on the beautiful terrace, with its marble steps leading down\nto the cool river beyond. Everything now seemed so peaceful and still;\nthe scent of the heliotrope made the midnight air swoon with its\nintoxicating fragrance: the rhythmic murmur of the waters came gently\nechoing from below, and from far away there came the melancholy cry of a\nnight-bird on the prowl.\n\nThat cry made Marguerite shudder: her thoughts flew back to the\nepisodes of this night and to Chauvelin, the dark bird of prey with his\nmysterious death-dealing plans, his subtle intrigues which all tended\ntowards the destruction of one man: his enemy, the husband whom\nMarguerite loved.\n\nOh! how she hated these wild adventures which took Percy away from her\nside. Is not a woman who loves--be it husband or child--the most truly\nselfish, the most cruelly callous creature in the world, there, where\nthe safety and the well-being of the loved one is in direct conflict\nwith the safety and well-being of others.\n\nShe would right gladly have closed her eyes to every horror perpetrated\nin France, she would not have known what went on in Paris, she wanted\nher husband! And yet month after month, with but short intervals, she\nsaw him risk that precious life of his, which was the very essence of\nher own soul, for others! for others! always for others!\n\nAnd she! she! Marguerite, his wife, was powerless to hold him back!\npowerless to keep him beside her, when that mad fit of passion seized\nhim to go on one of those wild quests, wherefrom she always feared he\ncould not return alive: and this, although she might use every noble\nartifice, every tender wile of which a loving and beautiful wife is\ncapable.\n\nAt times like those her own proud heart was filled with hatred and with\nenvy towards everything that took him away from her: and to-night all\nthese passionate feelings which she felt were quite unworthy of her and\nof him seemed to surge within her soul more tumultuously than ever. She\nwas longing to throw herself in his arms, to pour out into his loving\near all that she suffered, in fear and anxiety, and to make one more\nappeal to his tenderness and to that passion which had so often made him\nforget the world at her feet.\n\nAnd so instinctively she walked along the terrace towards that more\nsecluded part of the garden just above the river bank, where she had\nso oft wandered hand in hand with him, in the honeymoon of their\nlove. There great clumps of old-fashioned cabbage roses grew in untidy\nsplendour, and belated lilies sent intoxicating odours into the air,\nwhilst the heavy masses of Egyptian and Michaelmas daisies looked like\nghostly constellations in the gloom.\n\nShe thought Percy must soon be coming this way. Though it was so late,\nshe knew that he would not go to bed. After the events of the night, his\nruling passion, strong in death, would be holding him in its thrall.\n\nShe too felt wide awake and unconscious of fatigue; when she reached\nthe secluded path beside the river, she peered eagerly up and down, and\nlistened for a sound.\n\nPresently it seemed to her that above the gentle clapper of the waters\nshe could hear a rustle and the scrunching of the fine gravel under\ncarefully measured footsteps. She waited a while. The footsteps seemed\nto draw nearer, and soon, although the starlit night was very dark, she\nperceived a cloaked and hooded figure approaching cautiously toward her.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" she called suddenly.\n\nThe figure paused: then came rapidly forward, and a voice said timidly:\n\n\"Ah! Lady Blakeney!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Marguerite peremptorily.\n\n\"It is I... Desiree Candeille,\" replied the midnight prowler.\n\n\"Demoiselle Candeille!\" ejaculated Marguerite, wholly taken by surprise.\n\"What are you doing here? alone? and at this hour?\"\n\n\"Sh-sh-sh...\" whispered Candeille eagerly, as she approached quite close\nto Marguerite and drew her hood still lower over her eyes. \"I am all\nalone ... I wanted to see someone--you if possible, Lady Blakeney... for\nI could not rest... I wanted to know what had happened.\"\n\n\"What had happened? When? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"What happened between Citizen Chauvelin and your husband?\" asked\nCandeille.\n\n\"What is that to you?\" replied Marguerite haughtily.\n\n\"I pray you do not misunderstand me...\" pleaded Candeille eagerly. \"I\nknow my presence in your house... the quarrel which I provoked must have\nfilled your heart with hatred and suspicion towards me... but oh! how\ncan I persuade you?... I acted unwillingly... will you not believe\nme?... I was that man's tool... and... Oh God!\" she added with sudden,\nwild vehemence, \"if only you could know what tyranny that accursed\ngovernment of France exercises over poor helpless women or men who\nhappen to have fallen within reach of its relentless clutches...\"\n\nHer voice broke down in a sob. Marguerite hardly knew what to say or\nthink. She had always mistrusted this woman with her theatrical ways and\nstagy airs, from the very first moment she saw her in the tent on the\ngreen: and she did not wish to run counter against her instinct, in\nanything pertaining to the present crisis. And yet in spite of her\nmistrust the actress' vehement words found an echo in the depths of her\nown heart. How well she knew that tyranny of which Candeille spoke with\nsuch bitterness! Had she not suffered from it, endured terrible sorrow\nand humiliation, when under the ban of that same appalling tyranny\nshe had betrayed the identity--then unknown to her--of the Scarlet\nPimpernel?\n\nTherefore when Candeille paused after those last excited words, she said\nwith more gentleness than she had shown hitherto, though still quite\ncoldly:\n\n\"But you have not yet told me why you came back here to-night? If\nCitizen Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all that has\noccurred.\"\n\n\"I had a vague hope that I might see you.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"To warn you if I could.\"\n\n\"I need no warning.\"\n\n\"Or are too proud to take one.... Do you know, Lady Blakeney, that\nCitizen Chauvelin has a personal hatred against your husband?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" asked Marguerite, with her suspicions once more\non the qui-vive. She could not understand Candeille's attitude. This\nmidnight visit, the vehemence of her language, the strange mixture of\nknowledge and ignorance which she displayed. What did this woman know of\nChauvelin's secret plans? Was she his open ally, or his helpless tool?\nAnd was she even now playing a part taught her or commanded her by that\nprince of intriguers?\n\nCandeille, however, seemed quite unaware of the spirit of antagonism\nand mistrust which Marguerite took but little pains now to disguise. She\nclasped her hands together, and her voice shook with the earnestness of\nher entreaty.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said eagerly, \"have I not seen that look of hatred in\nChauvelin's cruel eyes?... He hates your husband, I tell you.... Why I\nknow not... but he hates him.. and means that great harm shall come to\nSir Percy through this absurd duel.... Oh! Lady Blakeney, do not let him\ngo... I entreat you, do not let him go!\"\n\nBut Marguerite proudly drew back a step or two, away from the reach of\nthose hands, stretched out towards her in such vehement appeal.\n\n\"You are overwrought, Mademoiselle,\" she said coldly. \"Believe me, I\nhave no need either of your entreaties or of your warning.... I should\nlike you to think that I have no wish to be ungrateful... that I\nappreciate any kind thought you may have harboured for me in your\nmind.... But beyond that... please forgive me if I say it somewhat\ncrudely--I do not feel that the matter concerns you in the least.... The\nhour is late,\" she added more gently, as if desiring to attenuate the\nharshness of her last words. \"Shall I send my maid to escort you home?\nShe is devoted and discreet...\"\n\n\"Nay!\" retorted the other in tones of quiet sadness, \"there is no need\nof discretion... I am not ashamed of my visit to you to-night.... You\nare very proud, and for your sake I will pray to God that sorrow and\nhumiliation may not come to you, as I feared.... We are never likely\nto meet again, Lady Blakeney... you will not wish it, and I shall have\npassed out of your life as swiftly as I had entered into it.... But\nthere was another thought lurking in my mind when I came to-night....\nIn case Sir Percy goes to France... the duel is to take place in or near\nBoulogne... this much I do know... would you not wish to go with him?\"\n\n\"Truly, Mademoiselle, I must repeat to you...\"\n\n\"That 'tis no concern of mine... I know... I own that.... But, you see\nwhen I came back here to-night in the silence and the darkness--I had\nnot guessed that you would be so proud... I thought that I, a woman,\nwould know how to touch your womanly heart.... I was clumsy, I\nsuppose.... I made so sure that you would wish to go with your husband,\nin case... in case he insisted on running his head into the noose, which\nI feel sure Chauvelin has prepared for him.... I myself start for France\nshortly. Citizen Chauvelin has provided me with the necessary passport\nfor myself and my maid, who was to have accompanied me.... Then, just\nnow, when I was all alone... and thought over all the mischief which\nthat fiend had forced me to do for him, it seemed to me that perhaps...\"\n\nShe broke off abruptly, and tried to read the other woman's face in\nthe gloom. But Marguerite, who was taller than the Frenchwoman, was\nstanding, very stiff and erect, giving the young actress neither\ndiscouragement nor confidence. She did not interrupt Candeille's long\nand voluble explanation: vaguely she wondered what it was all about,\nand even now when the Frenchwoman paused, Marguerite said nothing, but\nwatched her quietly as she took a folded paper from the capacious pocked\nof her cloak and then held it out with a look of timidity towards Lady\nBlakeney.\n\n\"My maid need not come with me,\" said Desiree Candeille humbly. \"I would\nfar rather travel alone... this is her passport and... Oh! you need not\ntake it out of my hand,\" she added in tones of bitter self-deprecation,\nas Marguerite made no sign of taking the paper from her. \"See! I will\nleave it here among the roses!... You mistrust me now... it is only\nnatural... presently, perhaps, calmer reflection will come... you will\nsee that my purpose now is selfless... that I only wish to serve you and\nhim.\"\n\nShe stooped and placed the folded paper in the midst of a great clump of\ncentifolium roses, and then without another word she turned and went her\nway. For a few moments, whilst Marguerite still stood there, puzzled and\nvaguely moved, she could hear the gentle frou-frou of the other woman's\nskirts against the soft sand of the path, and then a long-drawn sigh\nthat sounded like a sob.\n\nThen all was still again. The gentle midnight breeze caressed the tops\nof the ancient oaks and elms behind her, drawing murmurs from their\ndying leaves like unto the whisperings of ghosts.\n\nMarguerite shuddered with a slight sense of cold. Before her, amongst\nthe dark clump of leaves and the roses, invisible in the gloom, there\nfluttered with a curious, melancholy flapping, the folded paper placed\nthere by Candeille. She watched it for awhile, as, disturbed by the\nwind, it seemed ready to take its flight towards the river. Anon it fell\nto the ground, and Marguerite with sudden overpowering impulse, stooped\nand picked it up. Then clutching it nervously in her hand, she walked\nrapidly back towards the house.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV: Farewell\n\n\n\nAs she neared the terrace, she became conscious of several forms moving\nabout at the foot of the steps, some few feet below where she was\nstanding. Soon she saw the glimmer of lanthorns, heard whispering\nvoices, and the lapping of the water against the side of a boat.\n\nAnon a figure, laden with cloaks and sundry packages, passed down the\nsteps close beside her. Even in the darkness Marguerite recognized\nBenyon, her husband's confidential valet. Without a moment's hesitation,\nshe flew along the terrace towards the wing of the house occupied by Sir\nPercy. She had not gone far before she discerned his tall figure walking\nleisurely along the path which here skirted part of the house.\n\nHe had on his large caped coat, which was thrown open in front,\ndisplaying a grey travelling suit of fine cloth; his hands were as\nusual buried in the pockets of his breeches, and on his head he wore the\nfolding chapeau-bras which he habitually affected.\n\nBefore she had time to think, or to realize that he was going, before\nshe could utter one single word, she was in his arms, clinging to him\nwith passionate intensity, trying in the gloom to catch every expression\nof his eyes, every quiver of the face now bent down so close to her.\n\n\"Percy, you cannot go... you cannot go!...\" she pleaded.\n\nShe had felt his strong arms closing round her, his lips seeking hers,\nher eyes, her hair, her clinging hands, which dragged at his shoulders\nin a wild agony of despair.\n\n\"If you really loved me, Percy,\" she murmured, \"you would not go, you\nwould not go...\"\n\nHe would not trust himself to speak; it well-nigh seemed as if his\nsinews cracked with the violent effort at self-control. Oh! how she\nloved him, when she felt in him the passionate lover, the wild, untamed\ncreature that he was at heart, on whom the frigid courtliness of manner\nsat but as a thin veneer. This was his own real personality, and there\nwas little now of the elegant and accomplished gentleman of fashion,\nschooled to hold every emotion in check, to hide every thought, every\ndesire save that for amusement or for display.\n\nShe--feeling her power and his weakness now--gave herself wholly to his\nembrace, not grudging one single, passionate caress, yielding her lips\nto him, the while she murmured:\n\n\"You cannot go... you cannot... why should you go?... It is madness to\nleave me... I cannot let you go...\"\n\nHer arms clung tenderly round him, her voice was warm and faintly shaken\nwith suppressed tears, and as he wildly murmured: \"Don't! for pity's\nsake!\" she almost felt that her love would be triumphant.\n\n\"For pity's sake, I'll go on pleading, Percy!\" she whispered. \"Oh! my\nlove, my dear! do not leave me!... we have scarce had time to savour our\nhappiness.. we have such arrears of joy to make up.... Do not go,\nPercy... there's so much I want to say to you.... Nay! you shall not!\nyou shall not!\" she added with sudden vehemence. \"Look me straight in\nthe eyes, my dear, and tell me if you can leave now?\"\n\nHe did not reply, but, almost roughly, he placed his hand over her\ntear-dimmed eyes, which were turned up to his, in an agony of tender\nappeal. Thus he blindfolded her with that wild caress. She should\nnot see--no, not even she!--that for the space of a few seconds stern\nmanhood was well-nigh vanquished by the magic of her love.\n\nAll that was most human in him, all that was weak in this strong and\nuntamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness: for long\nsummer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the companionship of horses\nand dogs and of flowers, with no thought or cares save those for the\nnext evening's gavotte, no graver occupation save that of sitting at HER\nfeet.\n\nAnd during these few seconds, whilst his hand lay across her eyes, the\nlazy, idle fop of fashionable London was fighting a hand-to-hand fight\nwith the bold leader of a band of adventurers: and his own passionate\nlove for his wife ranged itself with fervent intensity on the side of\nhis weaker self. Forgotten were the horrors of the guillotine, the\ncalls of the innocent, the appeal of the helpless; forgotten the daring\nadventures, the excitements, the hair's-breadth escapes; for those few\nseconds, heavenly in themselves, he only remembered her--his wife--her\nbeauty and her tender appeal to him.\n\nShe would have pleaded again, for she felt that she was winning in this\nfight: her instinct--that unerring instinct of the woman who loves and\nfeels herself beloved--told her that for the space of an infinitesimal\nfraction of time, his iron will was inclined to bend; but he checked her\npleading with a kiss.\n\nThen there came a change.\n\nLike a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent emotion\nseemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of self-control. Was\nit a call from the boatmen below? a distant scrunching of feet upon the\ngravel?--who knows, perhaps only a sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly\nsummons from the land of dreams that recalled him to himself.\n\nEven as Marguerite was still clinging to him, with the ardent fervour of\nher own passion, she felt the rigid tension of his arms relax, the power\nof his embrace weaken, the wild love-light become dim in his eyes.\n\nHe kissed her fondly, tenderly, and with infinite gentleness smoothed\naway the little damp curls from her brow. There was a wistfulness now in\nhis caress, and in his kiss there was the finality of a long farewell.\n\n\"'Tis time I went,\" he said, \"or we shall miss the tide.\"\n\nThese were the first coherent words he had spoken since first she\nhad met him here in this lonely part of the garden, and his voice\nwas perfectly steady, conventional and cold. An icy pang shot through\nMarguerite's heart. It was as if she had been abruptly wakened from a\nbeautiful dream.\n\n\"You are not going, Percy!\" she murmured, and her own voice now sounded\nhollow and forced. \"Oh! if you loved me you would not go!\"\n\n\"If I love you!\"\n\nNay! in this at least there was no dream! no coldness in his voice when\nhe repeated those words with such a sigh of tenderness, such a world of\nlonging, that the bitterness of her great pain vanished, giving place to\ntears. He took her hand in his. The passion was momentarily conquered,\nforced within his innermost soul, by his own alter ego, that second\npersonality in him, the cold-blooded and coolly-calculating adventurer\nwho juggled with his life and tossed it recklessly upon the sea of\nchance 'twixt a doggerel and a smile. But the tender love lingered on,\nfighting the enemy a while longer, the wistful desire was there for her\nkiss, the tired longing for the exquisite repose of her embrace.\n\nHe took her hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with the warmth of\nhis kiss upon it, she felt a moisture like a tear.\n\n\"I must go, dear,\" he said, after a little while.\n\n\"Why? Why?\" she repeated obstinately. \"Am I nothing then? Is my life\nof no account? My sorrows? My fears? My misery? Oh!\" she added with\nvehement bitterness, \"why should it always be others? What are others\nto you and to me, Percy?... Are we not happy here?... Have you not\nfulfilled to its uttermost that self-imposed duty to people who can be\nnothing to us?... Is not your life ten thousand times more precious to\nme than the lives of ten thousand others?\"\n\nEven through the darkness, and because his face was so close to hers,\nshe could see a quaint little smile playing round the corners of his\nmouth.\n\n\"Nay, m'dear,\" he said gently, \"'tis not ten thousand lives that call to\nme to-day... only one at best.... Don't you hate to think of that poor\nlittle old cure sitting in the midst of his ruined pride and hopes:\nthe jewels so confidently entrusted to his care, stolen from him, he\nwaiting, perhaps, in his little presbytery for the day when those brutes\nwill march him to prison and to death.... Nay! I think a little sea\nvoyage and English country air would suit the Abbe Foucquet, m'dear, and\nI only mean to ask him to cross the Channel with me!...\"\n\n\"Percy!\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Oh! I know! I know!\" he rejoined with that short deprecatory sigh of\nhis, which seemed always to close any discussion between them on that\npoint, \"you are thinking of that absurd duel...\" He laughed lightly,\ngood-humouredly, and his eyes gleamed with merriment.\n\n\"La, m'dear!\" he said gaily, \"will you not reflect a moment? Could\nI refuse the challenge before His Royal Highness and the ladies? I\ncouldn't. ... Faith! that was it.... Just a case of couldn't.... Fate\ndid it all... the quarrel... my interference... the challenge.... HE had\nplanned it all of course.... Let us own that he is a brave man, seeing\nthat he and I are not even yet, for that beating he gave me on the\nCalais cliffs.\"\n\n\"Yes! he has planned it all,\" she retorted vehemently. \"The quarrel\nto-night, your journey to France, your meeting with him face to face at\na given hour and place where he can most readily, most easily close the\ndeath-trap upon you.\"\n\nThis time he broke into a laugh. A good, hearty laugh, full of the joy\nof living, of the madness and intoxication of a bold adventure, a laugh\nthat had not one particle of anxiety or of tremor in it.\n\n\"Nay! m'dear!\" he said, \"but your ladyship is astonishing.... Close a\ndeath-trap upon your humble servant?... Nay! the governing citizens\nof France will have to be very active and mighty wide-awake ere they\nsucceed in stealing a march on me.... Zounds! but we'll give them an\nexciting chase this time.... Nay! little woman, do not fear!\" he said\nwith sudden infinite gentleness, \"those demmed murderers have not got me\nyet.\"\n\nOh! how often she had fought with him thus: with him, the adventurer,\nthe part of his dual nature that was her bitter enemy, and which took\nhim, the lover, away from her side. She knew so well the finality of\nit all, the amazing hold which that unconquerable desire for these mad\nadventures had upon him. Impulsive, ardent as she was, Marguerite\nfelt in her very soul an overwhelming fury against herself for her\nown weakness, her own powerlessness in the face of that which forever\nthreatened to ruin her life and her happiness.\n\nYes! and his also! for he loved her! he loved her! he loved her! the\nthought went on hammering in her mind, for she knew of its great truth!\nHe loved her and went away! And she, poor, puny weakling, was unable to\nhold him back; the tendrils which fastened his soul to hers were not\nso tenacious as those which made him cling to suffering humanity, over\nthere in France, where men and women were in fear of death and torture,\nand looked upon the elusive and mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel as a\nheaven-born hero sent to save them from their doom. To them at these\ntimes his very heartstrings seemed to turn with unconquerable force, and\nwhen, with all the ardour of her own passion, she tried to play upon\nthe cords of his love for her, he could not respond, for they--the\nstrangers--had the stronger claim.\n\nAnd yet through it all she knew that this love of humanity, this mad\ndesire to serve and to help, in no way detracted from his love for her.\nNay, it intensified it, made it purer and better, adding to the joy of\nperfect intercourse the poetic and subtle fragrance of ever-recurring\npain.\n\nBut now at last she felt weary of the fight: her heart was aching,\nbruised and sore. An infinite fatigue seemed to weigh like lead upon\nher very soul. This seemed so different to any other parting, that had\nperforce been during the past year. The presence of Chauvelin in her\nhouse, the obvious planning of this departure for France, had filled\nher with a foreboding, nay, almost a certitude of a gigantic and deadly\ncataclysm.\n\nHer senses began to reel; she seemed not to see anything very\ndistinctly: even the loved form took on a strange and ghostlike shape.\nHe now looked preternaturally tall, and there was a mist between her and\nhim.\n\nShe thought that he spoke to her again, but she was not quite sure,\nfor his voice sounded like some weird and mysterious echo. A bosquet\nof climbing heliotrope close by threw a fragrance into the evening air,\nwhich turned her giddy with its overpowering sweetness.\n\nShe closed her eyes, for she felt as if she must die, if she held them\nopen any longer; and as she closed them it seemed to her as if he folded\nher in one last, long, heavenly embrace.\n\nHe felt her graceful figure swaying in his arms like a tall and slender\nlily bending to the wind. He saw that she was but half-conscious, and\nthanked heaven for this kindly solace to his heart-breaking farewell.\n\nThere was a sloping, mossy bank close by, there where the marble terrace\nyielded to the encroaching shrubbery: a tangle of pale pink monthly\nroses made a bower overhead. She was just sufficiently conscious to\nenable him to lead her to this soft green couch. There he laid her\namongst the roses, kissed the dear, tired eyes, her hands, her lips, her\ntiny feet, and went.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI: The Passport\n\n\n\nThe rhythmic clapper of oars roused Marguerite from this trance-like\nswoon.\n\nIn a moment she was on her feet, all her fatigue gone, her numbness\nof soul and body vanished as in a flash. She was fully conscious now!\nconscious that he had gone! that according to every probability under\nheaven and every machination concocted in hell, he would never return\nfrom France alive, and that she had failed to hear the last words which\nhe spoke to her, had failed to glean his last look or to savour his\nfinal kiss.\n\nThough the night was starlit and balmy it was singularly dark, and\nvainly did Marguerite strain her eyes to catch sight of that boat which\nwas bearing him away so swiftly now: she strained her ears, vaguely\nhoping to catch one last, lingering echo of his voice. But all was\nsilence, save that monotonous clapper, which seemed to beat against her\nheart like a rhythmic knell of death.\n\nShe could hear the oars distinctly: there were six or eight, she\nthought: certainly no fewer. Eight oarsmen probably, which meant the\nlarger boat, and undoubtedly the longer journey... not to London only\nwith a view to posting to Dover, but to Tilbury Fort, where the \"Day\nDream\" would be in readiness to start with a favourable tide.\n\nThought was returning to her, slowly and coherently: the pain of the\nlast farewell was still there, bruising her very senses with its dull\nand heavy weight, but it had become numb and dead, leaving her,\nherself, her heart and soul, stunned and apathetic, whilst her brain was\ngradually resuming its activity.\n\nAnd the more she thought it over, the more certain she grew that her\nhusband was going as far as Tilbury by river and would embark on the\n\"Day Dream\" there. Of course he would go to Boulogne at once. The duel\nwas to take place there, Candeille had told her that... adding that she\nthought she, Marguerite, would wish to go with him.\n\nTo go with him!\n\nHeavens above! was not that the only real, tangible thought in that\nwhirling chaos which was raging in her mind?\n\nTo go with him! Surely there must be some means of reaching him yet!\nFate, Nature, God Himself would never permit so monstrous a thing as\nthis: that she should be parted from her husband, now when his life was\nnot only in danger, but forfeited already... lost... a precious thing\nall but gone from this world.\n\nPercy was going to Boulogne... she must go too. By posting at once to\nDover, she could get the tidal boat on the morrow and reach the French\ncoast quite as soon as the \"Day Dream.\" Once at Boulogne, she would have\nno difficulty in finding her husband, of that she felt sure. She would\nhave but to dog Chauvelin's footsteps, find out something of his plans,\nof the orders he gave to troops or to spies,--oh! she would find him! of\nthat she was never for a moment in doubt!\n\nHow well she remembered her journey to Calais just a year ago, in\ncompany with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes! Chance had favoured her then, had\nenabled her to be of service to her husband if only by distracting\nChauvelin's attention for awhile to herself. Heaven knows! she had but\nlittle hope of being of use to him now: an aching sense was in her that\nfate had at last been too strong! that the daring adventurer had staked\nonce too often, had cast the die and had lost.\n\nIn the bosom of her dress she felt the sharp edge of the paper left for\nher by Desiree Candeille among the roses in the park. She had picked it\nup almost mechanically then, and tucked it away, hardly heeding what she\nwas doing. Whatever the motive of the French actress had been in placing\nthe passport at her disposal, Marguerite blessed her in her heart for\nit. To the woman she had mistrusted, she would owe the last supreme\nhappiness of her life.\n\nHer resolution never once wavered. Percy would not take her with him:\nthat was understandable. She could neither expect it nor think it. But\nshe, on the other hand, could not stay in England, at Blakeney Manor,\nwhilst any day, any hour, the death-trap set by Chauvelin for the\nScarlet Pimpernel might be closing upon the man whom she worshipped. She\nwould go mad if she stayed. As there could be no chance of escape for\nPercy now, as he had agreed to meet his deadly enemy face to face at a\ngiven place, and a given hour, she could not be a hindrance to him: and\nshe knew enough subterfuge, enough machinations and disguises by now, to\nescape Chauvelin's observation, unless... unless Percy wanted her, and\nthen she would be there.\n\nNo! she could not be a hindrance. She had a passport in her pocket,\neverything en regle, nobody could harm her, and she could come and go as\nshe pleased. There were plenty of swift horses in the stables, plenty of\ndevoted servants to do her bidding quickly and discreetly: moreover, at\nmoments like these, conventionalities and the possible conjectures\nand surmises of others became of infinitesimally small importance.\nThe household of Blakeney Manor were accustomed to the master's sudden\njourneys and absences of several days, presumably on some shooting\nor other sporting expeditions, with no one in attendance on him, save\nBenyon, his favourite valet. These passed without any comments now! Bah!\nlet everyone marvel for once at her ladyship's sudden desire to go to\nDover, and let it all be a nine days' wonder; she certainly did not\ncare. Skirting the house, she reached the stables beyond. One or two\nmen were astir. To these she gave the necessary orders for her coach and\nfour, then she found her way back to the house.\n\nWalking along the corridor, she went past the room occupied by Juliette\nde Marny. For a moment she hesitated, then she turned and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\nJuliette was not yet in bed, for she went to the door herself and opened\nit. Obviously she had been quite unable to rest, her hair was falling\nloosely over her shoulders, and there was a look of grave anxiety on her\nyoung face.\n\n\"Juliette,\" said Marguerite in a hurried whisper, the moment she had\nclosed the door behind her and she and the young girl were alone, \"I am\ngoing to France to be near my husband. He has gone to meet that fiend in\na duel which is nothing but a trap, set to capture him, and lead him\nto his death. I want you to be of help to me, here in my house, in my\nabsence.\"\n\n\"I would give my life for you, Lady Blakeney,\" said Juliette simply, \"is\nit not HIS since he saved it?\"\n\n\"It is only a little presence of mind, a little coolness and patience,\nwhich I will ask of you, dear,\" said Marguerite. \"You of course know\nwho your rescuer was, therefore you will understand my fears. Until\nto-night, I had vague doubts as to how much Chauvelin really knew,\nbut now these doubts have naturally vanished. He and the French\nRevolutionary Government know that the Scarlet Pimpernel and Percy\nBlakeney are one and the same. The whole scene to-night was prearranged:\nyou and I and all the spectators, and that woman Candeille--we were all\npuppets piping to that devil's tune. The duel, too, was prearranged!...\nthat woman wearing your mother's jewels!... Had you not provoked her, a\nquarrel between her and me, or one of my guests would have been forced\nsomehow... I wanted to tell you this, lest you should fret, and think\nthat you were in any way responsible for what has happened.... You were\nnot.... He had arranged it all.... You were only the tool... just as I\nwas. ... You must understand and believe that.... Percy would hate\nto think that you felt yourself to blame... you are not that, in any\nway.... The challenge was bound to come.... Chauvelin had arranged that\nit should come, and if you had failed him as a tool, he soon would have\nfound another! Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"I believe that you are an angel of goodness, Lady Blakeney,\" replied\nJuliette, struggling with her tears, \"and that you are the only woman in\nthe world worthy to be his wife.\"\n\n\"But,\" insisted Marguerite firmly, as the young girl took her cold hand\nin her own, and gently fondling it, covered it with grateful kisses,\n\"but if... if anything happens... anon... you will believe firmly that\nyou were in no way responsible?... that you were innocent.. and merely a\nblind tool?...\"\n\n\"God bless you for that!\"\n\n\"You will believe it?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And now for my request,\" rejoined Lady Blakeney in a more quiet, more\nmatter-of-fact tone of voice. \"You must represent me, here, when I am\ngone: explain as casually and as naturally as you can, that I have\ngone to join my husband on his yacht for a few days. Lucie, my maid, is\ndevoted and a tower of secrecy; she will stand between you and the rest\nof the household, in concocting some plausible story. To every friend\nwho calls, to anyone of our world whom you may meet, you must tell the\nsame tale, and if you note an air of incredulity in anyone, if you hear\nwhispers of there being some mystery, well! let the world wag its busy\ntongue--I care less than naught: it will soon tire of me and my doings,\nand having torn my reputation to shreds will quickly leave me in peace.\nBut to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes,\" she added earnestly, \"tell the whole truth\nfrom me. He will understand and do as he thinks right.\"\n\n\"I will do all you ask, Lady Blakeney, and am proud to think that I\nshall be serving you, even in so humble and easy a capacity. When do you\nstart?\"\n\n\"At once. Good-bye, Juliette.\"\n\nShe bent down to the young girl and kissed her tenderly on the forehead,\nthen she glided out of the room as rapidly as she had come. Juliette, of\ncourse, did not try to detain her, or to force her help of companionship\non her when obviously she would wish to be alone.\n\nMarguerite quickly reached her room. Her maid Lucie was already waiting\nfor her. Devoted and silent as she was, one glance at her mistress' face\ntold her that trouble--grave and imminent--had reached Blakeney Manor.\n\nMarguerite, whilst Lucie undressed her, took up the passport and\ncarefully perused the personal description of one, Celine Dumont, maid\nto Citizeness Desiree Candeille, which was given therein: tall, blue\neyes, light hair, age about twenty-five. It all might have been vaguely\nmeant for her. She had a dark cloth gown, and long black cloak with hood\nto come well over the head. These she now donned, with some thick shoes,\nand a dark-coloured handkerchief tied over her head under the hood, so\nas to hide the golden glory of her hair.\n\nShe was quite calm and in no haste. She made Lucie pack a small hand\nvalise with some necessaries for the journey, and provided herself\nplentifully with money--French and English notes--which she tucked well\naway inside her dress.\n\nThen she bade her maid, who was struggling with her tears, a kindly\nfarewell, and quickly went down to her coach.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII: Boulogne\n\n\n\nDuring the journey Marguerite had not much leisure to think. The\ndiscomforts and petty miseries incidental on cheap travelling had\nthe very welcome effect of making her forget, for the time being, the\nsoul-rendering crisis through which she was now passing.\n\nFor, of necessity, she had to travel at the cheap rate, among the crowd\nof poorer passengers who were herded aft the packet boat, leaning up\nagainst one another, sitting on bundles and packages of all kinds; that\npart of the deck, reeking with the smell of tar and sea-water, damp,\nsqually and stuffy, was an abomination of hideous discomfort to\nthe dainty, fastidious lady of fashion, yet she almost welcomed the\nintolerable propinquity, the cold douches of salt water, which every now\nand then wetted her through and through, for it was the consequent\nsense of physical wretchedness that helped her to forget the intolerable\nanguish of her mind.\n\nAnd among these poorer travellers she felt secure from observation. No\none took much notice of her. She looked just like one of the herd, and\nin the huddled-up little figure, in the dark bedraggled clothes, no\none would for a moment have recognized the dazzling personality of Lady\nBlakeney.\n\nDrawing her hood well over her head, she sat in a secluded corner of the\ndeck, upon the little black valise which contained the few belongings\nshe had brought with her. Her cloak and dress, now mud-stained and dank\nwith splashings of salt-water, attracted no one's attention. There was\na keen northeasterly breeze, cold and penetrating, but favourable to a\nrapid crossing. Marguerite, who had gone through several hours of\nweary travelling by coach, before she had embarked at Dover in the late\nafternoon, was unspeakably tired. She had watched the golden sunset\nout at sea until her eyes were burning with pain, and as the dazzling\ncrimson and orange and purple gave place to the soft grey tones of\nevening, she descried the round cupola of the church of Our Lady of\nBoulogne against the dull background of the sky.\n\nAfter that her mind became a blank. A sort of torpor fell over her\nsense: she was wakeful and yet half-asleep, unconscious of everything\naround her, seeing nothing but the distant massive towers of old\nBoulogne churches gradually detaching themselves one by one from out the\nfast gathering gloom.\n\nThe town seemed like a dream city, a creation of some morbid\nimagination, presented to her mind's eye as the city of sorrow and\ndeath.\n\nWhen the boat finally scraped her sides along the rough wooden jetty,\nMarguerite felt as if she were forcibly awakened. She was numb and stiff\nand thought she must have fallen asleep during the last half hour of the\njourney. Everything round her was dark. The sky was overcast, and the\nnight seemed unusually sombre. Figures were moving all around her, there\nwas noise and confusion of voices, and a general pushing and shouting\nwhich seemed strangely weird in this gloom. Here among the poorer\npassengers, there had not been thought any necessity for a light, one\nsolitary lantern fixed to a mast only enhanced the intense blackness of\neverything around. Now and then a face would come within range of this\nmeagre streak of yellow light, looking strangely distorted, with\ngreat, elongated shadows across the brow and chin, a grotesque, ghostly\napparition which quickly vanished again, scurrying off like some\nfrightened gnome, giving place other forms, other figures all equally\ngrotesque and equally weird.\n\nMarguerite watched them all half stupidly and motionlessly for awhile.\nShe did not quite know what she ought to do, and did not like to ask any\nquestions: she was dazed and the darkness blinded her. Then gradually\nthings began to detach themselves more clearly. On looking straight\nbefore her, she began to discern the landing place, the little wooden\nbridge across which the passengers walked one by one from the boat onto\nthe jetty. The first-class passengers were evidently all alighting now:\nthe crowd of which Marguerite formed a unit, had been pushed back in a\nmore compact herd, out of the way for the moment, so that their betters\nmight get along more comfortably.\n\nBeyond the landing stage a little booth had been erected, a kind of\ntent, open in front and lighted up within by a couple of lanthorns.\nUnder this tent there was a table, behind which sat a man dressed in\nsome sort of official looking clothes, and wearing the tricolour scarf\nacross his chest.\n\nAll the passengers from the boat had apparently to file past this tent.\nMarguerite could see them now quite distinctly, the profiles of the\nvarious faces, as they paused for a moment in front of the table, being\nbrilliantly illuminated by one of the lanterns. Two sentinels wearing\nthe uniform of the National Guard stood each side of the table. The\npassengers one by one took out their passport as they went by, handed\nit to the man in the official dress, who examined it carefully, very\nlengthily, then signed it and returned the paper to its owner: but at\ntimes, he appeared doubtful, folded the passport and put it down in\nfront of him: the passenger would protest; Marguerite could not hear\nwhat was said, but she could see that some argument was attempted,\nquickly dismissed by a peremptory order from the official. The doubtful\npassport was obviously put on one side for further examination, and the\nunfortunate owner thereof detained, until he or she had been able\nto give more satisfactory references to the representatives of the\nCommittee of Public Safety, stationed at Boulogne.\n\nThis process of examination necessarily took a long time. Marguerite\nwas getting horribly tired, her feet ached and she scarcely could hold\nherself upright: yet she watched all these people mechanically, making\nabsurd little guesses in her weary mind as to whose passport would find\nfavour in the eyes of the official, and whose would be found suspect and\ninadequate.\n\nSuspect! a terrible word these times! since Merlin's terrible law\ndecreed now that every man, woman or child, who was suspected by the\nRepublic of being a traitor was a traitor in fact.\n\nHow sorry she felt for those whose passports were detained: who tried\nto argue--so needlessly!--and who were finally led off by a soldier,\nwho had stepped out from somewhere in the dark, and had to await further\nexamination, probably imprisonment and often death.\n\nAs to herself, she felt quite safe: the passport given to her by\nChauvelin's own accomplice was sure to be quite en regle.\n\nThen suddenly her heart seemed to give a sudden leap and then to stop in\nits beating for a second or two. In one of the passengers, a man who\nwas just passing in front of the tent, she had recognized the form and\nprofile of Chauvelin.\n\nHe had no passport to show, but evidently the official knew who he\nwas, for he stood up and saluted, and listened deferentially whilst\nthe ex-ambassador apparently gave him a few instructions. It seemed to\nMarguerite that these instructions related to two women who were close\nbehind Chauvelin at the time, and who presently seemed to file past\nwithout going through the usual formalities of showing their passports.\nBut of this she could not be quite sure. The women were closely hooded\nand veiled and her own attention had been completely absorbed by this\nsudden appearance of her deadly enemy.\n\nYet what more natural than that Chauvelin should be here now? His object\naccomplished, he had no doubt posted to Dover, just as she had done.\nThere was no difficulty in that, and a man of his type and importance\nwould always have unlimited means and money at his command to accomplish\nany journey he might desire to undertake.\n\nThere was nothing strange or even unexpected in the man's presence here;\nand yet somehow it had made the whole, awful reality more tangible, more\nwholly unforgettable. Marguerite remembered his abject words to her,\nwhen first she had seen him at the Richmond fete: he said that he\nhad fallen into disgrace, that, having failed in his service to the\nRepublic, he had been relegated to a subordinate position, pushed aside\nwith contumely to make room for better, abler men.\n\nWell! all that was a lie, of course, a cunning method of gaining access\ninto her house; of that she had already been convinced, when Candeille\nprovoked the esclandre which led to the challenge.\n\nThat on French soil he seemed in anything but a subsidiary position,\nthat he appeared to rule rather than to obey, could in no way appear to\nMarguerite in the nature of surprise.\n\nAs the actress had been a willing tool in the cunning hands of\nChauvelin, so were probably all these people around her. Where others\ncringed in the face of officialism, the ex-ambassador had stepped forth\nas a master: he had shown a badge, spoken a word mayhap, and the man in\nthe tent who had made other people tremble, stood up deferentially and\nobeyed all commands.\n\nIt was all very simple and very obvious: but Marguerite's mind had been\nasleep, and it was the sight of the sable-clad little figure which had\nroused it from its happy torpor.\n\nIn a moment now her brain was active and alert, and presently it seemed\nto her as if another figure--taller than those around--had crossed the\nbarrier immediately in the wake of Chauvelin. Then she chided herself\nfor her fancies!\n\nIt could not be her husband. Not yet! He had gone by water, and would\nscarce be in Boulogne before the morning!\n\nAh! now at last came the turn of the second-class passengers! There was\na general bousculade and the human bundle began to move. Marguerite lost\nsight of the tent and its awe-inspiring appurtenances: she was a mere\nunit again in this herd on the move. She too progressed along slowly,\none step at a time; it was wearisome and she was deadly tired. She was\nbeginning to form plans now that she had arrived in France. All along\nshe had made up her mind that she would begin by seeking out the Abbe\nFoucquet, for he would prove a link 'twixt her husband and herself. She\nknew that Percy would communicate with the abbe; had he not told\nher that the rescue of the devoted old man from the clutches of the\nTerrorists would be one of the chief objects of his journey? It had\nnever occurred to her what she would do if she found the Abbe Foucquet\ngone from Boulogne.\n\n\"He! la mere! your passport!\"\n\nThe rough words roused her from her meditations. She had moved forward,\nquite mechanically, her mind elsewhere, her thoughts not following the\naim of her feet. Thus she must have crossed the bridge along with some\nof the crowd, must have landed on the jetty, and reached the front of\nthe tent, without really knowing what she was doing.\n\nAh yes! her passport! She had quite forgotten that! But she had it\nby her, quite in order, given to her in a fit of tardy remorse by\nDemoiselle Candeille, the intimate friend of one of the most influential\nmembers of the Revolutionary Government of France.\n\nShe took the passport from the bosom of her dress and handed it to the\nman in the official dress.\n\n\"Your name?\" he asked peremptorily.\n\n\"Celine Dumont,\" she replied unhesitatingly, for had she not rehearsed\nall this in her mind dozens of times, until her tongue could rattle off\nthe borrowed name as easily as it could her own; \"servitor to Citizeness\nDesiree Candeille!\"\n\nThe man who had very carefully been examining the paper the while,\nplaced it down on the table deliberately in front of him, and said:\n\n\"Celine Dumont! Eh! la mere! what tricks are you up to now?\"\n\n\"Tricks? I don't understand!\" she said quietly, for she was not afraid.\nThe passport was en regle: she knew she had nothing to fear.\n\n\"Oh! but I think you do!\" retorted the official with a sneer, \"and\n'tis a mighty clever one, I'll allow. Celine Dumont, ma foi! Not badly\nimagined, ma petite mere: and all would have passed off splendidly;\nunfortunately, Celine Dumont, servitor to Citizeness Desiree Candeille,\npassed through these barriers along with her mistress not half an hour\nago.\"\n\nAnd with long, grimy finger he pointed to an entry in the large book\nwhich lay open before him, and wherein he had apparently been busy\nmaking notes of the various passengers who had filed past him.\n\nThen he looked up with a triumphant leer at the calm face of Marguerite.\nShe still did not feel really frightened, only puzzled and perturbed;\nbut all the blood had rushed away from her face, leaving her cheeks\nashen white, and pressing against her heart, until it almost choked her.\n\n\"You are making a mistake, Citizen,\" she said very quietly. \"I am\nCitizeness Candeille's maid. She gave me the passport herself, just\nbefore I left for England; if you will ask her the question, she will\nconfirm what I say, and she assured me that it was quite en regle.\"\n\nBut the man only shrugged his shoulders and laughed derisively. The\nincident evidently amused him, yet he must have seen many of the same\nsort; in the far corner of the tent Marguerite seemed to discern a few\nmoving forms, soldiers, she thought, for she caught sight of a glint\nlike that of steel. One or two men stood close behind the official at\nthe desk, and the sentinels were to the right and left of the tent.\n\nWith an instinctive sense of appeal, Marguerite looked round from one\nface to the other: but each looked absolutely impassive and stolid,\nquite uninterested in this little scene, the exact counterpart of a\ndozen others, enacted on this very spot within the last hour.\n\n\"He! la! la! petite mere!\" said the official in the same tone of easy\npersiflage which he had adopted all along, \"but we do know how to\nconcoct a pretty lie, aye! and so circumstantially too! Unfortunately\nit was Citizeness Desiree Candeille herself who happened to be standing\njust where you are at the present moment, along with her maid, Celine\nDumont, both of whom were specially signed for and recommended as\nperfectly trustworthy, by no less a person than Citoyen Chauvelin of the\nCommittee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"But I assure you that there is a mistake,\" pleaded Marguerite\nearnestly, \"'Tis the other woman who lied, I have my passport and...\"\n\n\"A truce on this,\" retorted the man peremptorily. \"If everything is\nas you say, and if you have nothing to hide, you'll be at liberty to\ncontinue your journey to-morrow, after you have explained yourself\nbefore the citizen governor. Next one now, quick!\"\n\nMarguerite tried another protest, just as those others had done, whom\nshe had watched so mechanically before. But already she knew that that\nwould be useless, for she had felt that a heavy hand was being placed on\nher shoulder, and that she was being roughly led away.\n\nIn a flash she had understood and seen the whole sequel of the awful\ntrap which had all along been destined to engulf her as well as her\nhusband.\n\nWhat a clumsy, blind fool she had been!\n\nWhat a miserable antagonist the subtle schemes of a past master of\nintrigue as was Chauvelin. To have enticed the Scarlet Pimpernel to\nFrance was a great thing! The challenge was clever, the acceptance of\nit by the bold adventurer a forgone conclusion, but the master stroke of\nthe whole plan was done, when she, the wife, was enticed over too with\nthe story of Candeille's remorse and the offer of the passport.\n\nFool! fool that she was!\n\nAnd how well did Chauvelin know feminine nature! How cleverly he had\ndivined her thoughts, her feelings, the impulsive way in which she would\nact; how easily he had guessed that, knowing her husband's danger, she,\nMarguerite, would immediately follow him.\n\nNow the trap had closed on her--and she saw it all, when it was too\nlate.\n\nPercy Blakeney in France! His wife a prisoner! Her freedom and safety in\nexchange for his life!\n\nThe hopelessness of it all struck her with appalling force, and her\nsenses reeled with the awful finality of the disaster.\n\nYet instinct in her still struggled for freedom. Ahead of her, and all\naround, beyond the tent and in the far distance there was a provocative\nalluring darkness: if she only could get away, only could reach the\nshelter of that remote and sombre distance, she would hide, and wait,\nnot blunder again, oh no! she would be prudent and wary, if only she\ncould get away!\n\nOne woman's struggles, against five men! It was pitiable, sublime,\nabsolutely useless.\n\nThe man in the tent seemed to be watching her with much amusement for a\nmoment or two, as her whole graceful body stiffened for that absurd and\nunequal physical contest. He seemed vastly entertained at the sight of\nthis good-looking young woman striving to pit her strength against five\nsturdy soldiers of the Republic.\n\n\"Allons! that will do now!\" he said at last roughly. \"We have no time\nto waste! Get the jade away, and let her cool her temper in No. 6, until\nthe citizen governor gives further orders.\n\n\"Take her away!\" he shouted more loudly, banging a grimy fist down on\nthe table before him, as Marguerite still struggled on with the blind\nmadness of despair. \"Pardi! can none of you rid us of that turbulent\nbaggage?\"\n\nThe crowd behind were pushing forward: the guard within the tent were\njeering at those who were striving to drag Marguerite away: these latter\nwere cursing loudly and volubly, until one of them, tired out, furious\nand brutal, raised his heavy fist and with an obscene oath brought it\ncrashing down upon the unfortunate woman's head.\n\nPerhaps, though it was the work of a savage and cruel creature, the blow\nproved more merciful than it had been intended: it had caught Marguerite\nfull between the eyes; her aching senses, wearied and reeling already,\ngave way beneath this terrible violence; her useless struggles ceased,\nher arms fell inert by her side: and losing consciousness completely,\nher proud, unbendable spirit was spared the humiliating knowledge of her\nfinal removal by the rough soldiers, and of the complete wreckage of her\nlast, lingering hopes.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: No. 6\n\n\n\nConsciousness returned very slowly, very painfully.\n\nIt was night when last Marguerite had clearly known what was going on\naround her; it was daylight before she realized that she still lived,\nthat she still knew and suffered.\n\nHer head ached intolerably: that was the first conscious sensation which\ncame to her; then she vaguely perceived a pale ray of sunshine, very\nhazy and narrow, which came from somewhere in front of her and struck\nher in the face. She kept her eyes tightly shut, for that filmy light\ncaused her an increase of pain.\n\nShe seemed to be lying on her back, and her fingers wandering restlessly\naround felt a hard paillasse, beneath their touch, then a rough pillow,\nand her own cloak laid over her: thought had not yet returned, only the\nsensation of great suffering and of infinite fatigue.\n\nAnon she ventured to open her eyes, and gradually one or two objects\ndetached themselves from out the haze which still obscured her vision.\n\nFirstly, the narrow aperture--scarcely a window--filled in with tiny\nsquares of coarse, unwashed glass, through which the rays of the morning\nsun were making kindly efforts to penetrate, then the cloud of dust\nillumined by those same rays, and made up--so it seemed to the poor\ntired brain that strove to perceive--of myriads of abnormally large\nmolecules, over-abundant, and over-active, for they appeared to be\ndancing a kind of wild saraband before Marguerite's aching eyes,\nadvancing and retreating, forming themselves into groups and taking on\nfunny shapes of weird masques and grotesque faces which grinned at the\nunconscious figure lying helpless on the rough paillasse.\n\nThrough and beyond them Marguerite gradually became aware of three walls\nof a narrow room, dank and grey, half covered with whitewash and half\nwith greenish mildew! Yes! and there, opposite to her and immediately\nbeneath that semblance of a window, was another paillasse, and on it\nsomething dark, that moved.\n\nThe words: \"Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite ou la Mort!\" stared out at her\nfrom somewhere beyond those active molecules of dust, but she also saw\njust above the other paillasse the vague outline of a dark crucifix.\n\nIt seemed a terrible effort to co-ordinate all these things, and to\ntry and realize what the room was, and what was the meaning of the\npaillasse, the narrow window and the stained walls, too much altogether\nfor the aching head to take in save very slowly, very gradually.\n\nMarguerite was content to wait and to let memory creep back as\nreluctantly as it would.\n\n\"Do you think, my child, you could drink a little of this now?\"\n\nIt was a gentle, rather tremulous voice which struck upon her ear.\nShe opened her eyes, and noticed that the dark something which had\npreviously been on the opposite paillasse was no longer there, and\nthat there appeared to be a presence close to her only vaguely defined,\nsomeone kindly and tender who had spoken to her in French, with that\nsoft sing-song accent peculiar to the Normandy peasants, and who now\nseemed to be pressing something cool and soothing to her lips.\n\n\"They gave me this for you!\" continued the tremulous voice close to her\near. \"I think it would do you good, if you tried to take it.\"\n\nA hand and arm was thrust underneath the rough pillow, causing her to\nraise her head a little. A glass was held to her lips and she drank.\n\nThe hand that held the glass was all wrinkled, brown and dry, and\ntrembled slightly, but the arm which supported her head was firm and\nvery kind.\n\n\"There! I am sure you feel better now. Close your eyes and try to go to\nsleep.\"\n\nShe did as she was bid, and was ready enough to close her eyes. It\nseemed to her presently as if something had been interposed between her\naching head and that trying ray of white September sun.\n\nPerhaps she slept peacefully for a little while after that, for though\nher head was still very painful, her mouth and throat felt less parched\nand dry. Through this sleep or semblance of sleep, she was conscious of\nthe same pleasant voice softly droning Paters and Aves close to her ear.\n\nThus she lay, during the greater part of the day. Not quite fully\nconscious, not quite awake to the awful memories which anon would crowd\nupon her thick and fast.\n\nFrom time to time the same kind and trembling hands would with gentle\npressure force a little liquid food through her unwilling lips: some\nwarm soup, or anon a glass of milk. Beyond the pain in her head, she\nwas conscious of no physical ill; she felt at perfect peace, and an\nextraordinary sense of quiet and repose seemed to pervade this small\nroom, with its narrow window through which the rays of the sun came\ngradually in more golden splendour as the day drew towards noon, and\nthen they vanished altogether.\n\nThe drony voice close beside her acted as a soporific upon her nerves.\nIn the afternoon she fell into a real and beneficent sleep....\n\nBut after that, she woke to full consciousness!\n\nOh! the horror, the folly of it all!\n\nIt came back to her with all the inexorable force of an appalling\ncertainty.\n\nShe was a prisoner in the hands of those who long ago had sworn to bring\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel to death!\n\nShe! his wife, a hostage in their hands! her freedom and safety offered\nto him as the price of his own! Here there was no question of dreams\nor of nightmares: no illusions as to the ultimate intentions of her\nhusband's enemies. It was all a reality, and even now, before she had\nthe strength fully to grasp the whole nature of this horrible situation,\nshe knew that by her own act of mad and passionate impulse, she had\nhopelessly jeopardized the life of the man she loved.\n\nFor with that sublime confidence in him begotten of her love, she never\nfor a moment doubted which of the two alternatives he would choose, when\nonce they were placed before him. He would sacrifice himself for her; he\nwould prefer to die a thousand deaths so long as they set her free.\n\nFor herself, her own sufferings, her danger or humiliation she cared\nnothing! Nay! at this very moment she was conscious of a wild passionate\ndesire for death.... In this sudden onrush of memory and of thought she\nwished with all her soul and heart and mind to die here suddenly, on\nthis hard paillasse, in this lonely and dark prison... so that she\nshould be out of the way once and for all... so that she should NOT be\nthe hostage to be bartered against his precious life and freedom.\n\nHe would suffer acutely, terribly at her loss, because he loved her\nabove everything else on earth, he would suffer in every fibre of his\npassionate and ardent nature, but he would not then have to endure\nthe humiliations, the awful alternatives, the galling impotence and\nmiserable death, the relentless \"either--or\" which his enemies were even\nnow preparing for him.\n\nAnd then came a revulsion of feeling. Marguerite's was essentially a\nbuoyant and active nature, a keen brain which worked and schemed and\nplanned, rather than one ready to accept the inevitable.\n\nHardly had these thoughts of despair and of death formulated themselves\nin her mind, than with brilliant swiftness, a new train of ideas began\nto take root.\n\nWhat if matters were not so hopeless after all?\n\nAlready her mind had flown instinctively to thoughts of escape. Had she\nthe right to despair? She, the wife and intimate companion of the man\nwho had astonished the world with his daring, his prowess, his amazing\ngood luck, she to imagine for a moment that in this all-supreme moment\nof adventurous life the Scarlet Pimpernel would fail!\n\nWas not English society peopled with men, women and children whom his\ningenuity had rescued from plights quite as seemingly hopeless as her\nown, and would not all the resources of that inventive brain be brought\nto bear upon this rescue which touched him nearer and more deeply than\nany which he had attempted hitherto.\n\nNow Marguerite was chiding herself for her doubts and for her fears.\nAlready she remembered that amongst the crowd on the landing stage\nshe had perceived a figure--unusually tall--following in the wake of\nChauvelin and his companions. Awakened hope had already assured her that\nshe had not been mistaken, that Percy, contrary to her own surmises,\nhad reached Boulogne last night: he always acted so differently to what\nanyone might expect, that it was quite possible that he had crossed over\nin the packet-boat after all unbeknown to Marguerite as well as to his\nenemies.\n\nOh yes! the more she thought about it all, the more sure was she that\nPercy was already in Boulogne, and that he knew of her capture and her\ndanger.\n\nWhat right had she to doubt even for a moment that he would know how to\nreach her, how--when the time came--to save himself and her?\n\nA warm glow began to fill her veins, she felt excited and alert,\nabsolutely unconscious now of pain or fatigue, in this radiant joy of\nreawakened hope.\n\nShe raised herself slightly, leaning on her elbow: she was still very\nweak and the slight movement had made her giddy, but soon she would\nbe strong and well... she must be strong and well and ready to do his\nbidding when the time for escape would have come.\n\n\"Ah! you are better, my child, I see...\" said that quaint, tremulous\nvoice again, with its soft sing-song accent, \"but you must not be so\nventuresome, you know. The physician said that you had received a cruel\nblow. The brain has been rudely shaken... and you must lie quite still\nall to-day, or your poor little head will begin to ache again.\"\n\nMarguerite turned to look at the speaker, and in spite of her\nexcitement, of her sorrow and of her anxieties, she could not help\nsmiling at the whimsical little figure which sat opposite to her, on a\nvery rickety chair, solemnly striving with slow and measured movement\nof hand and arm, and a large supply of breath, to get up a polish on the\nworn-out surface of an ancient pair of buckled shoes.\n\nThe figure was slender and almost wizened, the thin shoulders round\nwith an habitual stoop, the lean shanks were encased in a pair of\nmuch-darned, coarse black stockings. It was the figure of an old man,\nwith a gentle, clear-cut face furrowed by a forest of wrinkles, and\nsurmounted by scanty white locks above a smooth forehead which looked\nyellow and polished like an ancient piece of ivory.\n\nHe had looked across at Marguerite as he spoke, and a pair of innately\nkind and mild blue eyes were fixed with tender reproach upon her.\nMarguerite thought that she had never seen quite so much goodness and\nsimple-heartedness portrayed on any face before. It literally beamed out\nof those pale blue eyes, which seemed quite full of unshed tears.\n\nThe old man wore a tattered garment, a miracle of shining cleanliness,\nwhich had once been a soutane of smooth black cloth, but was now a\nmass of patches and threadbare at shoulders and knees. He seemed deeply\nintent in the task of polishing his shoes, and having delivered himself\nof his little admonition, he very solemnly and earnestly resumed his\nwork.\n\nMarguerite's first and most natural instinct had, of course, been one of\ndislike and mistrust of anyone who appeared to be in some way on guard\nover her. But when she took in every detail of the quaint figure of the\nold man, his scrupulous tidiness of apparel, the resigned stoop of his\nshoulders, and met in full the gaze of those moist eyes, she felt that\nthe whole aspect of the man, as he sat there polishing his shoes, was\ninfinitely pathetic and, in its simplicity, commanding of respect.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Lady Blakeney at last, for the old man after\nlooking at her with a kind of appealing wonder, seemed to be waiting for\nher to speak.\n\n\"A priest of the good God, my dear child,\" replied the old man with a\ndeep sigh and a shake of his scanty locks, \"who is not allowed to serve\nhis divine Master any longer. A poor old fellow, very harmless and very\nhelpless, who had been set here to watch over you.\n\n\"You must not look upon me as a jailer because of what I say, my child,\"\nhe added with a quaint air of deference and apology. \"I am very old and\nvery small, and only take up a very little room. I can make myself very\nscarce; you shall hardly know that I am here. They forced me to it much\nagainst my will.... But they are strong and I am weak, how could I deny\nthem since they put me here. After all,\" he concluded naively, \"perhaps\nit is the will of le bon Dieu, and He knows best, my child, He knows\nbest.\"\n\nThe shoes evidently refused to respond any further to the old man's\nefforts at polishing them. He contemplated them now, with a whimsical\nlook of regret on his furrowed face, then set them down on the floor and\nslipped his stockinged feet into them.\n\nMarguerite was silently watching him, still leaning on her elbow.\nEvidently her brain was still numb and fatigued, for she did not seem\nable to grasp all that the old man said. She smiled to herself too as\nshe watched him. How could she look upon him as a jailer? He did not\nseem at all like a Jacobin or a Terrorist, there was nothing of the\ndissatisfied democrat, of the snarling anarchist ready to lend his hand\nto any act of ferocity directed against a so-called aristocrat, about\nthis pathetic little figure in the ragged soutane and worn shoes.\n\nHe seemed singularly bashful too and ill at ease, and loath to meet\nMarguerite's great, ardent eyes, which were fixed questioningly upon\nhim.\n\n\"You must forgive me, my daughter,\" he said shyly, \"for concluding my\ntoilet before you. I had hoped to be quite ready before you woke, but I\nhad some trouble with my shoes; except for a little water and soap the\nprison authorities will not provide us poor captives with any means of\ncleanliness and tidiness, and le bon Dieu does love a tidy body as well\nas a clean soul.\n\n\"But there, there,\" he added fussily, \"I must not continue to gossip\nlike this. You would like to get up, I know, and refresh your face and\nhands with a little water. Oh! you will see how well I have thought it\nout. I need not interfere with you at all, and when you make your little\nbit of toilette, you will feel quite alone... just as if the old man was\nnot there.\"\n\nHe began busying himself about the room, dragging the rickety,\nrush-bottomed chairs forward. There were four of these in the room, and\nhe began forming a kind of bulwark with them, placing two side by side,\nthen piling the two others up above.\n\n\"You will see, my child, you will see!\" he kept repeating at intervals\nas the work of construction progressed. It was no easy matter, for\nhe was of low stature, and his hands were unsteady from apparently\nuncontrollable nervousness.\n\nMarguerite, leaning slightly forward, her chin resting in her hand, was\ntoo puzzled and anxious to grasp the humour of this comical situation.\nShe certainly did not understand. This old man had in some sort of way,\nand for a hitherto unexplained reason, been set as a guard over her; it\nwas not an unusual device on the part of the inhuman wretches who now\nruled France, to add to the miseries and terrors of captivity, where a\nwoman of refinement was concerned, the galling outrage of never leaving\nher alone for a moment.\n\nThat peculiar form of mental torture, surely the invention of brains\nrendered mad by their own ferocious cruelty, was even now being\ninflicted on the hapless, dethroned Queen of France. Marguerite, in\nfar-off England, had shuddered when she heard of it, and in her heart\nhad prayed, as indeed every pure-minded woman did then, that proud,\nunfortunate Marie Antoinette might soon find release from such torments\nin death.\n\nThere was evidently some similar intention with regard to Marguerite\nherself in the minds of those who now held her prisoner. But this old\nman seemed so feeble and so helpless, his very delicacy of thought as\nhe built up a screen to divide the squalid room in two, proved him to be\nsingularly inefficient for the task of a watchful jailer.\n\nWhen the four chairs appeared fairly steady, and in comparatively little\ndanger of toppling, he dragged the paillasse forward and propped it\nup against the chairs. Finally he drew the table along, which held the\ncracked ewer and basin, and placed it against this improvised partition:\nthen he surveyed the whole construction with evident gratification and\ndelight.\n\n\"There now!\" he said, turning a face beaming with satisfaction to\nMarguerite, \"I can continue my prayers on the other side of the\nfortress. Oh! it is quite safe...\" he added, as with a fearsome hand he\ntouched his engineering feat with gingerly pride, \"and you will be quite\nprivate.... Try and forget that the old abbe is in the room.... He does\nnot count... really he does not count... he has ceased to be of any\nmoment these many months now that Saint Joseph is closed and he may no\nlonger say Mass.\"\n\nHe was obviously prattling on in order to hide his nervous bashfulness.\nHe ensconced himself behind his own finely constructed bulwark, drew a\nbreviary from his pocket and having found a narrow ledge on one of\nthe chairs, on which he could sit, without much danger of bringing the\nelaborate screen onto the top of his head, he soon became absorbed in\nhis orisons.\n\nMarguerite watched him for a little while longer: he was evidently\nendeavouring to make her think that he had become oblivious of her\npresence, and his transparent little manoeuvers amused and puzzled her\nnot a little.\n\nHe looked so comical with his fussy and shy ways, yet withal so gentle\nand so kindly that she felt completely reassured and quite calm.\n\nShe tried to raise herself still further and found the process\nastonishingly easy. Her limbs still ached and the violent, intermittent\npain in her head certainly made her feel sick and giddy at times, but\notherwise she was not ill. She sat up on the paillasse, then put\nher feet to the ground and presently walked up to the improvised\ndressing-room and bathed her face and hands. The rest had done her good,\nand she felt quite capable of co-ordinating her thoughts, of moving\nabout without too much pain, and of preparing herself both mentally and\nphysically for the grave events which she knew must be imminent.\n\nWhile she busied herself with her toilet her thoughts dwelt on the one\nall-absorbing theme: Percy was in Boulogne, he knew that she was here,\nin prison, he would reach her without fail, in fact he might communicate\nwith her at any moment now, and had without a doubt already evolved a\nplan of escape for her, more daring and ingenious than any which he had\nconceived hitherto; therefore, she must be ready, and prepared for any\neventuality, she must be strong and eager, in no way despondent, for if\nhe were here, would he not chide her for her want of faith?\n\nBy the time she had smoothed her hair and tidied her dress, Marguerite\ncaught herself singing quite cheerfully to herself.\n\nSo full of buoyant hope was she.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX: The Strength of the Weak\n\n\n\n\"M. L'Abbe!...\" said Marguerite gravely.\n\n\"Yes, mon enfant.\"\n\nThe old man looked up from his breviary, and saw Marguerite's great\nearnest eyes fixed with obvious calm and trust upon him. She had\nfinished her toilet as well as she could, had shaken up and tidied the\npaillasse, and was now sitting on the edge of it, her hands clasped\nbetween her knees. There was something which still puzzled her, and\nimpatient and impulsive as she was, she had watched the abbe as he\ncalmly went on reading the Latin prayers for the last five minutes, and\nnow she could contain her questionings no longer.\n\n\"You said just now that they set you to watch over me...\"\n\n\"So they did, my child, so they did...\" he replied with a sigh, as he\nquietly closed his book and slipped it back into his pocket. \"Ah! they\nare very cunning... and we must remember that they have the power. No\ndoubt,\" added the old man, with his own, quaint philosophy, \"no doubt le\nbon Dieu meant them to have the power, or they would not have it, would\nthey?\"\n\n\"By 'they' you mean the Terrorists and Anarchists of France,\nM. L'Abbe.... The Committee of Public Safety who pillage and murder,\noutrage women, and desecrate religion.... Is that not so?\"\n\n\"Alas! my child!\" he sighed.\n\n\"And it is 'they' who have set you to watch over me?... I confess I\ndon't understand...\"\n\nShe laughed, quite involuntarily indeed, for in spite of the reassurance\nin her heart her brain was still in a whirl of passionate anxiety.\n\n\"You don't look at all like one of 'them,' M. l'Abbe,\" she said.\n\n\"The good God forbid!\" ejaculated the old man, raising protesting hands\nup toward the very distant, quite invisible sky. \"How could I, a humble\npriest of the Lord, range myself with those who would flout and defy\nHim.\"\n\n\"Yet I am a prisoner of the Republic and you are my jailer, M. l'Abbe.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he sighed. \"But I am very helpless. This was my cell. I had\nbeen here with Francois and Felicite, my sister's children, you know.\nInnocent lambs, whom those fiends would lead to slaughter. Last night,\"\nhe continued, speaking volubly, \"the soldiers came in and dragged\nFrancois and Felicite out of this room, where, in spite of the danger\nbefore us, in spite of what we suffered, we had contrived to be quite\nhappy together. I could read the Mass, and the dear children would say\ntheir prayers night and morning at my knee.\"\n\nHe paused awhile. The unshed tears in his mild blue eyes struggled\nfor freedom now, and one or two flowed slowly down his wrinkled cheek.\nMarguerite, though heartsore and full of agonizing sorrow herself, felt\nher whole noble soul go out to this kind old man, so pathetic, so high\nand simple-minded in his grief.\n\nShe said nothing, however, and the Abbe continued after a few seconds'\nsilence.\n\n\"When the children had gone, they brought you in here, mon enfant, and\nlaid you on the paillasse where Felicite used to sleep. You looked\nvery white, and stricken down, like one of God's lambs attacked by\nthe ravening wolf. Your eyes were closed and you were blissfully\nunconscious. I was taken before the governor of the prison, and he told\nme that you would share the cell with me for a time, and that I was to\nwatch you night and day, because...\"\n\nThe old man paused again. Evidently what he had to say was very\ndifficult to put into words. He groped in his pockets and brought out\na large bandana handkerchief, red and yellow and green, with which\nhe began to mop his moist forehead. The quaver in his voice and the\ntrembling of his hands became more apparent and pronounced.\n\n\"Yes, M. l'Abbe? Because?...\" queried Marguerite gently.\n\n\"They said that if I guarded you well, Felicite and Francois would\nbe set free,\" replied the old man after a while, during which he made\nvigorous efforts to overcome his nervousness, \"and that if you escaped\nthe children and I would be guillotined the very next day.\"\n\nThere was silence in the little room now. The Abbe was sitting quite\nstill, clasping his trembling fingers, and Marguerite neither moved nor\nspoke. What the old man had just said was very slowly finding its way to\nthe innermost cells of her brain. Until her mind had thoroughly grasped\nthe meaning of it all, she could not trust herself to make a single\ncomment.\n\nIt was some seconds before she fully understood it all, before she\nrealized what it meant not only to her, but indirectly to her husband.\nUntil now she had not been fully conscious of the enormous wave of hope\nwhich almost in spite of herself had risen triumphant above the dull,\ngrey sea of her former despair; only now when it had been shattered\nagainst this deadly rock of almost superhuman devilry and cunning did\nshe understand what she had hoped, and what she must now completely\nforswear.\n\nNo bolts and bars, no fortified towers or inaccessible fortresses could\nprove so effectual a prison for Marguerite Blakeney as the dictum which\nmorally bound her to her cell.\n\n\"If you escape the children and I would be guillotined the very next\nday.\"\n\nThis meant that even if Percy knew, even if he could reach her, he\ncould never set her free, since her safety meant death to two innocent\nchildren and to this simple hearted man.\n\nIt would require more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet Pimpernel\nhimself to untie this Gordian knot.\n\n\"I don't mind for myself, of course,\" the old man went on with gentle\nphilosophy. \"I have lived my life. What matters if I die to-morrow, or\nif I linger on until my earthly span is legitimately run out? I am ready\nto go home whenever my Father calls me. But it is the children, you\nsee. I have to think of them. Francois is his mother's only son, the\nbread-winner of the household, a good lad and studious too, and Felicite\nhas always been very delicate. She is blind from birth and...\"\n\n\"Oh! don't... for pity's sake, don't...\" moaned Marguerite in an agony\nof helplessness. \"I understand... you need not fear for your children,\nM. l'Abbe: no harm shall come to them through me.\"\n\n\"It is as the good God wills!\" replied the old man quietly.\n\nThen, as Marguerite had once more relapsed into silence, he fumbled\nfor his beads, and his gentle voice began droning the Paters and Aves\nwherein no doubt his child-like heart found peace and solace.\n\nHe understood that the poor woman would not wish to speak, he knew as\nwell as she did the overpowering strength of his helpless appeal. Thus\nthe minutes sped on, the jailer and the captive, tied to one another by\nthe strongest bonds that hand of man could forge, had nothing to say\nto one another: he, the old priest, imbued with the traditions of his\ncalling, could pray and resign himself to the will of the Almighty, but\nshe was young and ardent and passionate, she loved and was beloved,\nand an impassable barrier was built up between her and the man she\nworshipped!\n\nA barrier fashioned by the weak hands of children, one of whom was\ndelicate and blind. Outside was air and freedom, reunion with her\nhusband, an agony of happy remorse, a kiss from his dear lips, and\ntrembling held her back from it all, because of Francois who was the\nbread-winner and of Felicite who was blind.\n\nMechanically now Marguerite rose again, and like an automaton--lifeless\nand thoughtless--she began putting the dingy, squalid room to rights.\nThe Abbe helped her demolish the improvised screen; with the same gentle\ndelicacy of thought which had caused him to build it up, he refrained\nfrom speaking to her now: he would not intrude himself on her grief and\nher despair.\n\nLater on, she forced herself to speak again, and asked the old man his\nname.\n\n\"My name is Foucquet,\" he replied, \"Jean Baptiste Marie Foucquet,\nlate parish priest of the Church of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of\nBoulogne.\"\n\nFoucquet! This was l'Abbe Foucquet! the faithful friend and servant of\nthe de Marny family.\n\nMarguerite gazed at him with great, questioning eyes.\n\nWhat a wealth of memories crowded in on her mind at sound of that name!\nHer beautiful home at Richmond, her brilliant array of servants and\nguests, His Royal Highness at her side! life in free, joyous happy\nEngland--how infinitely remote it now seemed. Her ears were filled with\nthe sound of a voice, drawly and quaint and gentle, a voice and a laugh\nhalf shy, wholly mirthful, and oh! so infinitely dear:\n\n\"I think a little sea voyage and English country air would suit the Abbe\nFoucquet, m'dear, and I only mean to ask him to cross the Channel with\nme...\"\n\nOh! the joy and confidence expressed in those words! the daring, the\nambition! the pride! and the soft, languorous air of the old-world\ngarden round her then, the passion of his embrace! the heavy scent of\nlate roses and of heliotrope, which caused her to swoon in his arms!\n\nAnd now a narrow prison cell, and that pathetic, tender little creature\nthere, with trembling hands and tear-dimmed eyes, the most powerful and\nmost relentless jailer which the ferocious cunning of her deadly enemies\ncould possible have devised.\n\nThen she talked to him of Juliette Marny.\n\nThe Abbe did not know that Mlle. de Marny had succeeded in reaching\nEngland safely and was overjoyed to hear it.\n\nHe recounted to Marguerite the story of the Marny jewels: how he had put\nthem safely away in the crypt of his little church, until the Assembly\nof the Convention had ordered the closing of the churches, and placed\nbefore every minister of le bon Dieu the alternative of apostasy or\ndeath.\n\n\"With me it has only been prison so far,\" continued the old man simply,\n\"but prison has rendered me just as helpless as the guillotine would\nhave done, for the enemies of le bon Dieu have ransacked the Church of\nSaint Joseph and stolen the jewels which I should have guarded with my\nlife.\"\n\nBut it was obvious joy for the Abbe to talk of Juliette Marny's\nhappiness. Vaguely, in his remote little provincial cure, he had heard\nof the prowess and daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel and liked to think\nthat Juliette owed her safety to him.\n\n\"The good God will reward him and those whom he cares for,\" added Abbe\nFoucquet with that earnest belief in divine interference which seemed so\nstrangely pathetic under these present circumstances.\n\nMarguerite sighed, and for the first time in this terrible soul-stirring\ncrisis through which she was passing so bravely, she felt a beneficent\nmoisture in her eyes: the awful tension of her nerves relaxed. She went\nup to the old man took his wrinkled hand in hers and falling on her\nknees beside him she eased her overburdened heart in a flood of tears.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX: Triumph\n\n\n\nThe day that Citizen Chauvelin's letter was received by the members of\nthe Committee of Public Safety was indeed one of great rejoicing.\n\nThe Moniteur tells us that in the Seance of September 22nd, 1793, or\nVendemiaire 1st of the Year I. it was decreed that sixty prisoners,\nnot absolutely proved guilty of treason against the Republic--only\nsuspected--were to be set free.\n\nSixty!... at the mere news of the possible capture of the Scarlet\nPimpernel.\n\nThe Committee was inclined to be magnanimous. Ferocity yielded for the\nmoment to the elusive joy of anticipatory triumph.\n\nA glorious prize was about to fall into the hands of those who had the\nwelfare of the people at heart.\n\nRobespierre and his decemvirs rejoiced, and sixty persons had cause\nto rejoice with them. So be it! There were plans evolved already as to\nnational fetes and wholesale pardons when that impudent and meddlesome\nEnglishman at last got his deserts.\n\nWholesale pardons which could easily be rescinded afterwards. Even\nwith those sixty it was a mere respite. Those of le Salut Public only\nloosened their hold for a while, were nobly magnanimous for a day, quite\nprepared to be doubly ferocious the next.\n\nIn the meanwhile let us heartily rejoice!\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel is in France or will be very soon, and on an\nappointed day he will present himself conveniently to the soldiers of\nthe Republic for capture and for subsequent guillotine. England is at\nwar with us, there is nothing therefore further to fear from her. We\nmight hang every Englishman we can lay hands on, and England could do no\nmore than she is doing at the present moment: bombard our ports, bluster\nand threaten, join hands with Flanders, and Austria and Sardinia, and\nthe devil if she choose.\n\nAllons! vogue la galere! The Scarlet Pimpernel is perhaps on our shores\nat this very moment! Our most stinging, most irritating foe is about to\nbe delivered into our hands.\n\nCitizen Chauvelin's letter is very categorical:\n\n\"I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre, and to the Members of the\nRevolutionary Government who have entrusted me with the delicate\nmission...\"\n\nRobespierre's sensuous lips curl into a sarcastic smile. Citizen\nChauvelin's pen was ever florid in its style: \"entrusted me with the\ndelicate mission,\" is hardly the way to describe an order given under\npenalty of death.\n\nBut let it pass.\n\n\"... that four days from this date, at one hour after sunset, the man\nwho goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel will be on the\nsouthern ramparts of Boulogne, at the extreme southern corner of the\ntown.\"\n\n\"Four days from this date...\" and Citizen Chauvelin's letter is dated\nthe nineteenth of September, 1793.\n\n\"Too much of an aristocrat--Monsieur le Marquis Chauvelin...\" sneers\nMerlin, the Jacobin. \"He does not know that all good citizens had called\nthat date the 28th Fructidor, Year I. of the Republic.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" retorts Robespierre with impatient frigidity, \"whatever we\nmay call the day it was forty-eight hours ago, and in forty-eight hours\nmore that damned Englishman will have run his head into a noose, from\nwhich, an I mistake not, he'll not find it easy to extricate himself.\"\n\n\"And you believe in Citizen Chauvelin's assertion,\" commented Danton\nwith a lazy shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Only because he asks for help from us,\" quoth Robespierre drily; \"he is\nsure that the man will be there, but not sure if he can tackle him.\"\n\nBut many were inclined to think that Chauvelin's letter was an idle\nboast. They knew nothing of the circumstances which had caused that\nletter to be written: they could not conjecture how it was that the\nex-ambassador could be so precise in naming the day and hour when the\nenemy of France would be at the mercy of those whom he had outraged and\nflouted.\n\nNevertheless Citizen Chauvelin asks for help, and help must not be\ndenied him. There must be no shadow of blame upon the actions of the\nCommittee of Public Safety.\n\nChauvelin had been weak once, had allowed the prize to slip through his\nfingers; it must not occur again. He has a wonderful head for devising\nplans, but he needs a powerful hand to aid him, so that he may not fail\nagain.\n\nCollot d'Herbois, just home from Lyons and Tours, is the right man in\nan emergency like this. Citizen Collot is full of ideas; the inventor\nof the \"Noyades\" is sure to find a means of converting Boulogne into one\ngigantic prison out of which the mysterious English adventurer will find\nit impossible to escape.\n\nAnd whilst the deliberations go on, whilst this committee of butchers\nare busy slaughtering in imagination the game they have not yet\nsucceeded in bringing down, there comes another messenger from Citizen\nChauvelin.\n\nHe must have ridden hard on the other one's heels, and something very\nunexpected and very sudden must have occurred to cause the Citizen to\nsend this second note.\n\nThis time it is curt and to the point. Robespierre unfolds it and reads\nit to his colleagues.\n\n\"We have caught the woman--his wife--there may be murder attempted\nagainst my person, send me some one at once who will carry out my\ninstructions in case of my sudden death.\"\n\nRobespierre's lips curl in satisfaction, showing a row of yellowish\nteeth, long and sharp like the fangs of a wolf. A murmur like unto the\nsnarl of a pack of hyenas rises round the table, as Chauvelin's letter\nis handed round.\n\nEveryone has guessed the importance of this preliminary capture:\n\"the woman--his wife.\" Chauvelin evidently thinks much of it, for he\nanticipates an attempt against his life, nay! he is quite prepared for\nit, ready to sacrifice it for the sake of his revenge.\n\nWho had accused him of weakness?\n\nHe only thinks of his duty, not of his life; he does not fear for\nhimself, only that the fruits of his skill might be jeopardized through\nassassination.\n\nWell! this English adventurer is capable of any act of desperation to\nsave his wife and himself, and Citizen Chauvelin must not be left in the\nlurch.\n\nThus, Citizen Collot d'Herbois is despatched forthwith to Boulogne to be\na helpmeet and counsellor to Citizen Chauvelin.\n\nEverything that can humanly be devised must be done to keep the woman\nsecure and to set the trap for that elusive Pimpernel.\n\nOnce he is caught the whole of France shall rejoice, and Boulogne, who\nhad been instrumental in running the quarry to earth, must be specially\nprivileged on that day.\n\nA general amnesty for all prisoners the day the Scarlet Pimpernel is\ncaptured. A public holiday and a pardon for all natives of Boulogne who\nare under sentence of death: they shall be allowed to find their way to\nthe various English boats--trading and smuggling craft--that always lie\nat anchor in the roads there.\n\nThe Committee of Public Safety feel amazingly magnanimous towards\nBoulogne; a proclamation embodying the amnesty and the pardon is at once\ndrawn up and signed by Robespierre and his bloodthirsty Council of Ten,\nit is entrusted to Citizen Collot d'Herbois to be read out at every\ncorner of the ramparts as an inducement to the little town to do its\nlevel best. The Englishman and his wife--captured in Boulogne--will\nboth be subsequently brought to Paris, formally tried on a charge of\nconspiring against the Republic and guillotined as English spies, but\nBoulogne shall have the greater glory and shall reap the first and\nrichest reward.\n\nAnd armed with the magnanimous proclamation, the orders for general\nrejoicings and a grand local fete, armed also with any and every power\nover the entire city, its municipality, its garrisons, its forts, for\nhimself and his colleague Chauvelin, Citizen Collot d'Herbois starts for\nBoulogne forthwith.\n\nNeedless to tell him not to let the grass grow under his horse's\nhoofs. The capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, though not absolutely an\naccomplished fact, is nevertheless a practical certainty, and no one\nrejoices over this great event more than the man who is to be present\nand see all the fun.\n\nRiding and driving, getting what relays of horses or waggons from\nroadside farms that he can, Collot is not likely to waste much time on\nthe way.\n\nIt is 157 miles to Boulogne by road, and Collot, burning with ambition\nto be in at the death, rides or drives as no messenger of good tidings\nhas ever ridden or driven before.\n\nHe does not stop to eat, but munches chunks of bread and cheese in the\nrecess of the lumbering chaise or waggon that bears him along whenever\nhis limbs refuse him service and he cannot mount a horse.\n\nThe chronicles tell us that twenty-four hours after he left Paris,\nhalf-dazed with fatigue, but ferocious and eager still, he is borne\nto the gates of Boulogne by an old cart horse requisitioned from some\ndistant farm, and which falls down, dead, at the Porte Gayole, whilst\nits rider, with a last effort, loudly clamours for admittance into the\ntown \"in the name of the Republic.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI: Suspense\n\n\n\nIn his memorable interview with Robespierre, the day before he left for\nEngland, Chauvelin had asked that absolute power be given him, in\norder that he might carry out the plans for the capture of the Scarlet\nPimpernel, which he had in his mind. Now that he was back in France he\nhad no cause to complain that the revolutionary government had grudged\nhim this power for which he had asked.\n\nImplicit obedience had followed whenever he had commanded.\n\nAs soon as he heard that a woman had been arrested in the act of\nuttering a passport in the name of Celine Dumont, he guessed at once\nthat Marguerite Blakeney had, with characteristic impulse, fallen into\nthe trap which, with the aid of the woman Candeille, he had succeeded in\nlaying for her.\n\nHe was not the least surprised at that. He knew human nature, feminine\nnature, far too well, ever to have been in doubt for a moment that\nMarguerite would follow her husband without calculating either costs or\nrisks.\n\nYe gods! the irony of it all! Had she not been called the cleverest\nwoman in Europe at one time? Chauvelin himself had thus acclaimed her,\nin those olden days, before she and he became such mortal enemies, and\nwhen he was one of the many satellites that revolved round brilliant\nMarguerite St. Just. And to-night, when a sergeant of the town guards\nbrought him news of her capture, he smiled grimly to himself; the\ncleverest woman in Europe had failed to perceive the trap laid\ntemptingly open for her.\n\nOnce more she had betrayed her husband into the hands of those who would\nnot let him escape a second time. And now she had done it with her eyes\nopen, with loving, passionate heart which ached for self-sacrifice, and\nonly succeeded in imperilling the loved one more hopelessly than before.\n\nThe sergeant was waiting for orders. Citizen Chauvelin had come to\nBoulogne, armed with more full and more autocratic powers than any\nservant of the new republic had ever been endowed with before.\nThe governor of the town, the captain of the guard, the fort and\nmunicipality were all as abject slaves before him.\n\nAs soon as he had taken possession of the quarters organized for him in\nthe town hall, he had asked for a list of prisoners who for one cause or\nanother were being detained pending further investigations.\n\nThe list was long and contained many names which were of not the\nslightest interest to Chauvelin: he passed them over impatiently.\n\n\"To be released at one,\" he said curtly.\n\nHe did not want the guard to be burdened with unnecessary duties, nor\nthe prisons of the little sea-port town to be inconveniently encumbered.\nHe wanted room, space, air, the force and intelligence of the entire\ntown at his command for the one capture which meant life and revenge to\nhim.\n\n\"A woman--name unknown--found in possession of a forged passport in\nthe name of Celine Dumont, maid to the Citizeness Desiree\nCandeille--attempted to land--was interrogated and failed to give\nsatisfactory explanation of herself--detained in room No. 6 of the\nGayole prison.\"\n\nThis was one of the last names on the list, the only one of any\nimportance to Citizen Chauvelin. When he read it he nearly drove his\nnails into the palms of his hands, so desperate an effort did he make\nnot to betray before the sergeant by look or sigh the exultation which\nhe felt.\n\nFor a moment he shaded his eyes against the glare of the lamp, but it\nwas not long before he had formulated a plan and was ready to give his\norders.\n\nHe asked for a list of prisoners already detained in the various forts.\nThe name of l'Abbe Foucquet with those of his niece and nephew attracted\nhis immediate attention. He asked for further information respecting\nthese people, heard that the boy was a widow's only son, the sole\nsupporter of his mother's declining years: the girl was ailing,\nsuffering from incipient phthisis, and was blind.\n\nPardi! the very thing! L'Abbe himself, the friend of Juliette Marny, the\npathetic personality around which this final adventure of the Scarlet\nPimpernel was intended to revolve! and these two young people! his\nsister's children! one of them blind and ill, the other full of vigour\nand manhood.\n\nCitizen Chauvelin had soon made up his mind.\n\nA few quick orders to the sergeant of the guard, and l'Abbe Foucquet,\nweak, helpless and gentle, became the relentless jailer who would guard\nMarguerite more securely than a whole regiment of loyal soldiers could\nhave done.\n\nThen, having despatched a messenger to the Committee of Public Safety,\nChauvelin laid himself down to rest. Fate had not deceived him. He\nhad thought and schemed and planned, and events had shaped themselves\nexactly as foreseen, and the fact that Marguerite Blakeney was at the\npresent moment a prisoner in his hands was merely the result of his own\ncalculations.\n\nAs for the Scarlet Pimpernel, Chauvelin could not very well conceive\nwhat he would do under these present circumstances. The duel on the\nsouthern ramparts had of course become a farce, not likely to be enacted\nnow that Marguerite's life was at stake. The daring adventurer was\ncaught in a network at last, from which all his ingenuity, all his wit,\nhis impudence and his amazing luck could never extricate him.\n\nAnd in Chauvelin's mind there was still something more. Revenge was the\nsweetest emotion his bruised and humbled pride could know: he had not\nyet tasted its complete intoxicating joy: but every hour now his cup of\ndelight became more and more full: in a few days it would overflow.\n\nIn the meanwhile he was content to wait. The hours sped by and there\nwas no news yet of that elusive Pimpernel. Of Marguerite he knew nothing\nsave that she was well guarded; the sentry who passed up and down\noutside room No. 6 had heard her voice and that of the Abbe Foucquet, in\nthe course of the afternoon.\n\nChauvelin had asked the Committee of Public Safety for aid in his\ndifficult task, but forty-eight hours at least must elapse before such\naid could reach him. Forty-eight hours, during which the hand of an\nassassin might be lurking for him, and might even reach him ere his\nvengeance was fully accomplished.\n\nThat was the only thought which really troubled him. He did not want to\ndie before he had seen the Scarlet Pimpernel a withered abject creature,\ncrushed in fame and honour, too debased to find glorification even in\ndeath.\n\nAt this moment he only cared for his life because it was needed for the\ncomplete success of his schemes. No one else he knew would have that\nnote of personal hatred towards the enemy of France which was necessary\nnow in order to carry out successfully the plans which he had formed.\n\nRobespierre and all the others only desired the destruction of a man who\nhad intrigued against the reign of terror which they had established;\nhis death on the guillotine, even if it were surrounded with the halo\nof martyrdom, would have satisfied them completely. Chauvelin looked\nfurther than that. He hated the man! He had suffered humiliation through\nhim individually. He wished to see him as an object of contempt rather\nthan of pity. And because of the anticipation of this joy, he was\ncareful of his life, and throughout those two days which elapsed\nbetween the capture of Marguerite and the arrival of Collot d'Herbois at\nBoulogne, Chauvelin never left his quarters at the Hotel de Ville, and\nrequisitioned a special escort consisting of proved soldiers of the town\nguard to attend his every footstep.\n\nOn the evening of the 22nd, after the arrival of Citizen Collot in\nBoulogne, he gave orders that the woman from No. 6 cell be brought\nbefore him in the ground floor room of the Fort Gayole.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII: Not Death\n\n\n\nTwo days of agonizing suspense, of alternate hope and despair, had told\nheavily on Marguerite Blakeney.\n\nHer courage was still indomitable, her purpose firm and her faith\nsecure, but she was without the slightest vestige of news, entirely shut\noff from the outside world, left to conjecture, to scheme, to expect and\nto despond alone.\n\nThe Abbe Foucquet had tried in his gentle way to be of comfort to her,\nand she in her turn did her very best not to render his position more\ncruel than it already was.\n\nA message came to him twice during those forty-eight hours from Francois\nand Felicite, a little note scribbled by the boy, or a token sent by the\nblind girl, to tell the Abbe that the children were safe and well, that\nthey would be safe and well so long as the Citizeness with the name\nunknown remained closely guarded by him in room No. 6.\n\nWhen these messages came, the old man would sigh and murmur something\nabout the good God: and hope, which perhaps had faintly risen in\nMarguerite's heart within the last hour or so, would once more sink back\ninto the abyss of uttermost despair.\n\nOutside the monotonous walk of the sentry sounded like the perpetual\nthud of a hammer beating upon her bruised temples.\n\n\"What's to be done? My God? what's to be done?\"\n\nWhere was Percy now?\n\n\"How to reach him!... Oh, God! grant me light!\"\n\nThe one real terror which she felt was that she would go mad. Nay! that\nshe was in a measure mad already. For hours now,--or was it days?... or\nyears?... she had heard nothing save that rhythmic walk of the sentinel,\nand the kindly, tremulous voice of the Abbe whispering consolations,\nor murmuring prayers in her ears, she had seen nothing save that prison\ndoor, of rough deal, painted a dull grey, with great old-fashioned lock,\nand hinges rusty with the damp of ages.\n\nShe had kept her eyes fixed on that door until they burned and ached\nwith well-nigh intolerable pain; yet she felt that she could not look\nelsewhere, lest she missed the golden moment when the bolts would be\ndrawn, and that dull, grey door would swing slowly on its rusty hinges.\n\nSurely, surely, that was the commencement of madness!\n\nYet for Percy's sake, because he might want her, because he might have\nneed of her courage and of her presence of mind, she tried to keep her\nwits about her. But it was difficult! oh! terribly difficult! especially\nwhen the shade of evening began to gather in, and peopled the squalid,\nwhitewashed room with innumerable threatening ghouls.\n\nThen when the moon came up, a silver ray crept in through the tiny\nwindow and struck full upon that grey door, making it look weird and\nspectral like the entrance to a house of ghosts.\n\nEven now as there was a distinct sound of the pushing of bolts and bars,\nMarguerite thought that she was the prey of hallucinations. The Abbe\nFoucquet was sitting in the remote and darkest corner of the room,\nquietly telling his beads. His serene philosophy and gentle placidity\ncould in no way be disturbed by the opening or shutting of a door, or by\nthe bearer of good or evil tidings.\n\nThe room now seemed strangely gloomy and cavernous, with those deep,\nblack shadows all around and that white ray of the moon which struck so\nweirdly on the door.\n\nMarguerite shuddered with one of those unaccountable premonitions of\nsomething evil about to come, which ofttimes assail those who have a\nnervous and passionate temperament.\n\nThe door swung slowly open upon its hinges: there was a quick word of\ncommand, and the light of a small oil lamp struck full into the gloom.\nVaguely Marguerite discerned a group of men, soldiers no doubt, for\nthere was a glint of arms and the suggestion of tricolour cockades and\nscarves. One of the men was holding the lamp aloft, another took a few\nsteps forward into the room. He turned to Marguerite, entirely ignoring\nthe presence of the old priest, and addressed her peremptorily.\n\n\"Your presence is desired by the citizen governor,\" he said curtly;\n\"stand up and follow me.\"\n\n\"Whither am I to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"To where my men will take you. Now then, quick's the word. The citizen\ngovernor does not like to wait.\"\n\nAt a word of command from him, two more soldiers now entered the room\nand placed themselves one on each side of Marguerite, who, knowing that\nresistance was useless, had already risen and was prepared to go.\n\nThe Abbe tried to utter a word of protest and came quickly forward\ntowards Marguerite, but he was summarily and very roughly pushed aside.\n\n\"Now then, calotin,\" said the first soldier with an oath, \"this is none\nof your business. Forward! march!\" he added, addressing his men, \"and\nyou, Citizeness, will find it wiser to come quietly along and not to\nattempt any tricks with me, or the gag and manacles will have to be\nused.\"\n\nBut Marguerite had no intention of resisting. She was too tired even to\nwonder as to what they meant to do with her or whither they were going;\nshe moved as in a dream and felt a hope within her that she was being\nled to death: summary executions were the order of the day, she knew\nthat, and sighed for this simple solution of the awful problem which had\nbeen harassing her these past two days.\n\nShe was being led along a passage, stumbling ever and anon as she\nwalked, for it was but dimly lighted by the same little oil lamp, which\none of the soldiers was carrying in front, holding it high up above his\nhead: then they went down a narrow flight of stone steps, until she and\nher escort reached a heavy oak door.\n\nA halt was ordered at this point: and the man in command of the little\nparty pushed the door open and walked in. Marguerite caught sight of\na room beyond, dark and gloomy-looking, as was her own prison cell.\nSomewhere on the left there was obviously a window; she could not see\nit but guessed that it was there because the moon struck full upon the\nfloor, ghost-like and spectral, well fitting in with the dream-like\nstate in which Marguerite felt herself to be.\n\nIn the centre of the room she could discern a table with a chair close\nbeside it, also a couple of tallow candles, which flickered in the\ndraught caused no doubt by that open window which she could not see.\n\nAll these little details impressed themselves on Marguerite's mind, as\nshe stood there, placidly waiting until she should once more be told to\nmove along. The table, the chair, that unseen window, trivial objects\nthough they were, assumed before her overwrought fancy an utterly\ndisproportionate importance. She caught herself presently counting up\nthe number of boards visible on the floor, and watching the smoke of the\ntallow-candles rising up towards the grimy ceiling.\n\nAfter a few minutes' weary waiting which seemed endless to Marguerite,\nthere came a short word of command from within and she was roughly\npushed forward into the room by one of the men. The cool air of a late\nSeptember's evening gently fanned her burning temples. She looked round\nher and now perceived that someone was sitting at the table, the other\nside of the tallow-candles--a man, with head bent over a bundle of\npapers and shading his face against the light with his hand.\n\nHe rose as she approached, and the flickering flame of the candles\nplayed weirdly upon the slight, sable-clad figure, illumining the keen,\nferret-like face, and throwing fitful gleams across the deep-set eyes\nand the narrow, cruel mouth.\n\nIt was Chauvelin.\n\nMechanically Marguerite took the chair which the soldier drew towards\nher, ordering her curtly to sit down. She seemed to have but\nlittle power to move. Though all her faculties had suddenly become\npreternaturally alert at sight of this man, whose very life now was\nspent in doing her the most grievous wrong that one human being can do\nto another, yet all these faculties were forcefully centred in the one\nmighty effort not to flinch before him, not to let him see for a moment\nthat she was afraid.\n\nShe compelled her eyes to look at him fully and squarely, her lips not\nto tremble, her very heart to stop its wild, excited beating. She felt\nhis keen eyes fixed intently upon her, but more in curiosity than in\nhatred or satisfied vengeance.\n\nWhen she had sat down he came round the table and moved towards her.\nWhen he drew quite near, she instinctively recoiled. It had been an\nalmost imperceptible action on her part and certainly an involuntary\none, for she did not wish to betray a single thought or emotion, until\nshe knew what he wished to say.\n\nBut he had noted her movement--a sort of drawing up and stiffening of\nher whole person as he approached. He seemed pleased to see it, for\nhe smiled sarcastically but with evident satisfaction, and--as if his\npurpose was now accomplished--he immediately withdrew and went back to\nhis former seat on the other side of the table. After that he ordered\nthe soldiers to go.\n\n\"But remain at attention outside, you and your men,\" he added, \"ready to\nenter if I call.\"\n\nIt was Marguerite's turn to smile at this obvious sign of a lurking fear\non Chauvelin's part, and a line of sarcasm and contempt curled her full\nlips.\n\nThe soldiers having obeyed and the oak door having closed upon them,\nMarguerite was now alone with the man whom she hated and loathed beyond\nevery living thing on earth.\n\nShe wondered when he would begin to speak and why he had sent for her.\nBut he seemed in no hurry to begin. Still shading his face with his\nhand, he was watching her with utmost attention: she, on the other hand,\nwas looking through and beyond him, with contemptuous indifference, as\nif his presence here did not interest her in the least.\n\nShe would give him no opening for this conversation which he had\nsought and which she felt would prove either purposeless or else deeply\nwounding to her heart and to her pride. She sat, therefore, quite still\nwith the flickering and yellow light fully illumining her delicate face,\nwith its child-like curves, and delicate features, the noble, straight\nbrow, the great blue eyes and halo of golden hair.\n\n\"My desire to see you here to-night, must seem strange to you, Lady\nBlakeney,\" said Chauvelin at last.\n\nThen, as she did not reply, he continued, speaking quite gently, almost\ndeferentially:\n\n\"There are various matters of grave importance, which the events of the\nnext twenty-four hours will reveal to your ladyship: and believe me\nthat I am actuated by motives of pure friendship towards you in this\nmy effort to mitigate the unpleasantness of such news as you might hear\nto-morrow perhaps, by giving you due warning of what its nature might\nbe.\"\n\nShe turned great questioning eyes upon him, and in their expression she\ntried to put all the contempt which she felt, all the bitterness, all\nthe defiance and the pride.\n\nHe quietly shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Ah! I fear me,\" he said, \"that your ladyship, as usual doth me grievous\nwrong. It is but natural that you should misjudge me, yet believe me...\"\n\n\"A truce on this foolery, M. Chauvelin,\" she broke in, with sudden\nimpatient vehemence, \"pray leave your protestations of friendship and\ncourtesy alone, there is no one here to hear them. I pray you proceed\nwith what you have to say.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" It was a sigh of satisfaction on the part of Chauvelin. Her\nanger and impatience even at this early stage of the interview proved\nsufficiently that her icy restraint was only on the surface.\n\nAnd Chauvelin always knew how to deal with vehemence. He loved to play\nwith the emotions of a passionate fellow-creature: it was only the\nimperturbable calm of a certain enemy of his that was wont to shake his\nown impenetrable armour of reserve.\n\n\"As your ladyship desires,\" he said, with a slight and ironical bow of\nthe head. \"But before proceeding according to your wish, I am compelled\nto ask your ladyship just one question.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"Have you reflected what your present position means to that inimitable\nprince of dandies, Sir Percy Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Is it necessary for your present purpose, Monsieur, that you should\nmention my husband's name at all?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is indispensable, fair lady,\" he replied suavely, \"for is not the\nfate of your husband so closely intertwined with yours, that his actions\nwill inevitably be largely influenced by your own.\"\n\nMarguerite gave a start of surprise, and as Chauvelin had paused she\ntried to read what hidden meaning lay behind these last words of his.\nWas it his intention then to propose some bargain, one of those terrible\n\"either-or's\" of which he seemed to possess the malignant secret? Oh!\nif that was so, if indeed he had sent for her in order to suggest one of\nthose terrible alternatives of his, then--be it what it may, be it the\nwildest conception which the insane brain of a fiend could invent, she\nwould accept it, so long as the man she loved were given one single\nchance of escape.\n\nTherefore she turned to her arch-enemy in a more conciliatory spirit\nnow, and even endeavoured to match her own diplomatic cunning against\nhis.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" she said tentatively. \"How can my actions\ninfluence those of my husband? I am a prisoner in Boulogne: he probably\nis not aware of that fact yet and...\"\n\n\"Sir Percy Blakeney may be in Boulogne at any moment now,\" he\ninterrupted quietly. \"An I mistake not, few places can offer such great\nattractions to that peerless gentleman of fashion than doth this humble\nprovincial town of France just at this present.... Hath it not the\nhonour of harbouring Lady Blakeney within its gates?... And your\nladyship may indeed believe me when I say that the day that Sir Percy\nlands in our hospitable port, two hundred pairs of eyes will be fixed\nupon him, lest he should wish to quit it again.\"\n\n\"And if there were two thousand, sir,\" she said impulsively, \"they would\nnot stop his coming or going as he pleased.\"\n\n\"Nay, fair lady,\" he said, with a smile, \"are you then endowing Sir\nPercy Blakeney with the attributes which, as popular fancy has it,\nbelong exclusively to that mysterious English hero, the Scarlet\nPimpernel?\"\n\n\"A truce to your diplomacy, Monsieur Chauvelin,\" she retorted, goaded by\nhis sarcasm, \"why should we try to fence with one another? What was the\nobject of your journey to England? of the farce which you enacted in\nmy house, with the help of the woman Candeille? of that duel and\nthat challenge, save that you desired to entice Sir Percy Blakeney to\nFrance?\"\n\n\"And also his charming wife,\" he added with an ironical bow.\n\nShe bit her lip, and made no comment.\n\n\"Shall we say that I succeeded admirably?\" he continued, speaking with\npersistent urbanity and calm, \"and that I have strong cause to hope that\nthe elusive Pimpernel will soon be a guest on our friendly shores?...\nThere! you see I too have laid down the foils.... As you say, why should\nwe fence? Your ladyship is now in Boulogne, soon Sir Percy will come to\ntry and take you away from us, but believe me, fair lady, that it would\ntake more than the ingenuity and the daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel\nmagnified a thousandfold to get him back to England again... unless...\"\n\n\"Unless?...\"\n\nMarguerite held her breath. She felt now as if the whole universe must\nstand still during the next supreme moment, until she had heard what\nChauvelin's next words would be.\n\nThere was to be an \"unless\" then? An \"either-or\" more terrible no doubt\nthan the one he had formulated before her just a year ago.\n\nChauvelin, she knew, was past master in the art of putting a knife at\nhis victim's throat and of giving it just the necessary twist with his\ncruel and relentless \"unless\"!\n\nBut she felt quite calm, because her purpose was resolute. There is no\ndoubt that during this agonizing moment of suspense she was absolutely\nfirm in her determination to accept any and every condition which\nChauvelin would put before her as the price of her husband's safety.\nAfter all, these conditions, since he placed them before HER, could\nresolve themselves into questions of her own life against her husband's.\n\nWith that unreasoning impulse which was one of her most salient\ncharacteristics, she never paused to think that, to Chauvelin, her own\nlife or death were only the means to the great end which he had in view:\nthe complete annihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nThat end could only be reached by Percy Blakeney's death--not by her\nown.\n\nEven now as she was watching him with eyes glowing and lips tightly\nclosed, lest a cry of impatient agony should escape her throat,\nhe,--like a snail that has shown its slimy horns too soon, and is not\nready to face the enemy as yet,--seemed suddenly to withdraw within his\nformer shell of careless suavity. The earnestness of his tone vanished,\ngiving place to light and easy conversation, just as if he were\ndiscussing social topics with a woman of fashion in a Paris\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"Nay!\" he said pleasantly, \"is not your ladyship taking this matter in\ntoo serious a spirit? Of a truth you repeated my innocent word 'unless'\neven as if I were putting knife at your dainty throat. Yet I meant\nnaught that need disturb you yet. Have I not said that I am your friend?\nLet me try and prove it to you.\"\n\n\"You will find that a difficult task, Monsieur,\" she said drily.\n\n\"Difficult tasks always have had a great fascination for your humble\nservant. May I try?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Shall we then touch at the root of this delicate matter? Your ladyship,\nso I understand, is at this moment under the impression that I desire\nto encompass--shall I say?--the death of an English gentleman for whom,\nbelieve me, I have the greatest respect. That is so, is it not?\"\n\n\"What is so, M. Chauvelin?\" she asked almost stupidly, for truly she had\nnot even begun to grasp his meaning. \"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"You think that I am at this moment taking measures for sending the\nScarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine? Eh?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Never was so great an error committed by a clever woman. Your ladyship\nmust believe me when I say that the guillotine is the very last place\nin the world where I would wish to see that enigmatic and elusive\npersonage.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to fool me, M. Chauvelin? If so, for what purpose? And\nwhy do you lie to me like that?\"\n\n\"On my honour, 'tis the truth. The death of Sir Percy Blakeney--I may\ncall him that, may I not?--would ill suit the purpose which I have in\nview.\"\n\n\"What purpose? You must pardon me, Monsieur Chauvelin,\" she added with\na quick, impatient sigh, \"but of a truth I am getting confused, and my\nwits must have become dull in the past few days. I pray to you to add\nto your many protestations of friendship a little more clearness in your\nspeech and, if possible, a little more brevity. What then is the purpose\nwhich you had in view when you enticed my husband to come over to\nFrance?\"\n\n\"My purpose was the destruction of the Scarlet Pimpernel, not the death\nof Sir Percy Blakeney. Believe me, I have a great regard for Sir Percy.\nHe is a most accomplished gentleman, witty, brilliant, an inimitable\ndandy. Why should he not grace with his presence the drawing-rooms of\nLondon or of Brighton for many years to come?\"\n\nShe looked at him with puzzled inquiry. For one moment the thought\nflashed through her mind that, after all, Chauvelin might be still in\ndoubt as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel.... But no! that hope\nwas madness.... It was preposterous and impossible.... But then, why?\nwhy? why?... Oh God! for a little more patience!\n\n\"What I have just said may seem a little enigmatic to your ladyship,\" he\ncontinued blandly, \"but surely so clever a woman as yourself, so great\na lady as is the wife of Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet, will be aware\nthat there are other means of destroying an enemy than the taking of his\nlife.\"\n\n\"For instance, Monsieur Chauvelin?\"\n\n\"There is the destruction of his honour,\" he replied slowly.\n\nA long, bitter laugh, almost hysterical in its loud outburst, broke from\nthe very depths of Marguerite's convulsed heart.\n\n\"The destruction of his honour!... ha! ha! ha! ha!... of a truth,\nMonsieur Chauvelin, your inventive powers have led you beyond the bounds\nof dreamland!... Ha! ha! ha! ha!... It is in the land of madness\nthat you are wandering, sir, when you talk in one breath of Sir Percy\nBlakeney and the possible destruction of his honour!\"\n\nBut he remained apparently quite unruffled, and when her laughter had\nsomewhat subsided, he said placidly:\n\n\"Perhaps!...\"\n\nThen he rose from his chair, and once more approached her. This time she\ndid not shrink from him. The suggestion which he had made just now, this\ntalk of attacking her husband's honour rather than his life, seemed so\nwild and preposterous--the conception truly of a mind unhinged--that she\nlooked upon it as a sign of extreme weakness on his part, almost as an\nacknowledgement of impotence.\n\nBut she watched him as he moved round the table more in curiosity now\nthan in fright. He puzzled her, and she still had a feeling at the back\nof her mind that there must be something more definite and more evil\nlurking at the back of that tortuous brain.\n\n\"Will your ladyship allow me to conduct you to yonder window?\" he said,\n\"the air is cool, and what I have to say can best be done in sight of\nyonder sleeping city.\"\n\nHis tone was one of perfect courtesy, even of respectful deference\nthrough which not the slightest trace of sarcasm could be discerned, and\nshe, still actuated by curiosity and interest, not in any way by fear,\nquietly rose to obey him. Though she ignored the hand which he was\nholding out towards her, she followed him readily enough as he walked up\nto the window.\n\nAll through this agonizing and soul-stirring interview she had felt\nheavily oppressed by the close atmosphere of the room, rendered nauseous\nby the evil smell of the smoky tallow-candles which were left to spread\ntheir grease and smoke abroad unchecked. Once or twice she had gazed\nlongingly towards the suggestion of pure air outside.\n\nChauvelin evidently had still much to say to her: the torturing, mental\nrack to which she was being subjected had not yet fully done its work.\nIt still was capable of one or two turns, a twist or so which might\nsucceed in crushing her pride and her defiance. Well! so be it! she\nwas in the man's power: had placed herself therein through her own\nunreasoning impulse. This interview was but one of the many soul-agonies\nwhich she had been called upon to endure, and if by submitting to it all\nshe could in a measure mitigate her own faults and be of help to the\nman she loved, she would find the sacrifice small and the mental torture\neasy to bear.\n\nTherefore when Chauvelin beckoned to her to draw near, she went up to\nthe window, and leaning her head against the deep stone embrasure, she\nlooked out into the night.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII The Hostage\n\n\n\nChauvelin, without speaking, extended his hand out towards the city as\nif to invite Marguerite to gaze upon it.\n\nShe was quite unconscious what hour of the night it might be, but it\nmust have been late, for the little town, encircled by the stony arms\nof its forts, seemed asleep. The moon, now slowly sinking in the west,\nedged the towers and spires with filmy lines of silver. To the right\nMarguerite caught sight of the frowning Beffroi, which even as she gazed\nout began tolling its heavy bell. It sounded like the tocsin, dull and\nmuffled. After ten strokes it was still.\n\nTen o'clock! At this hour in far-off England, in fashionable London, the\nplay was just over, crowds of gaily dressed men and women poured out of\nthe open gates of the theatres calling loudly for attendant or chaise.\nThence to balls or routs, gaily fluttering like so many butterflies,\nbrilliant and irresponsible....\n\nAnd in England also, in the beautiful gardens of her Richmond home,\nofttimes at ten o'clock she had wandered alone with Percy, when he was\nat home, and the spirit of adventure in him momentarily laid to rest.\nThen, when the night was very dark and the air heavy with the scent of\nroses and lilies, she lay quiescent in his arms in that little arbour\nbeside the river. The rhythmic lapping of the waves was the only sound\nthat stirred the balmy air. He seldom spoke then, for his voice would\nshake whenever he uttered a word: but his impenetrable armour of\nflippancy was pierced through and he did not speak because his lips were\npressed to hers, and his love had soared beyond the domain of speech.\n\nA shudder of intense mental pain went through her now as she gazed on\nthe sleeping city, and sweet memories of the past turned to bitterness\nin this agonizing present. One by one as the moon gradually disappeared\nbehind a bank of clouds, the towers of Boulogne were merged in the\ngloom. In front of her far, far away, beyond the flat sand dunes, the\nsea seemed to be calling to her with a ghostly and melancholy moan.\n\nThe window was on the ground floor of the Fort, and gave direct onto the\nwide and shady walk which runs along the crest of the city walls; from\nwhere she stood Marguerite was looking straight along the ramparts, some\nthirty metres wide at this point, flanked on either side by the granite\nbalustrade, and adorned with a double row of ancient elms stunted and\ntwisted into grotesque shapes by the persistent action of the wind.\n\n\"These wide ramparts are a peculiarity of this city...\" said a voice\nclose to her ear, \"at times of peace they form an agreeable promenade\nunder the shade of the trees, and a delightful meeting-place for\nlovers... or enemies....\"\n\nThe sound brought her back to the ugly realities of the present: the\nrose-scented garden at Richmond, the lazily flowing river, the tender\nmemories which for that brief moment had confronted her from out a happy\npast, suddenly vanished from her ken. Instead of these the brine-laden\nsea-air struck her quivering nostrils, the echo of the old Beffroi died\naway in her ear, and now from out one of the streets or open places of\nthe sleeping city there came the sound of a raucous voice, shooting in\nmonotonous tones a string of words, the meaning of which failed to reach\nher brain.\n\nNot many feet below the window, the southern ramparts of the town\nstretched away into the darkness. She felt unaccountably cold suddenly\nas she looked down upon them and, with aching eyes, tried to pierce the\ngloom. She was shivering in spite of the mildness of this early\nautumnal night: her overwrought fancy was peopling the lonely walls\nwith unearthly shapes strolling along, discussing in spectral language a\nstrange duel which was to take place here between a noted butcher of men\nand a mad Englishman overfond of adventure.\n\nThe ghouls seemed to pass and repass along in front of her and to be\nlaughing audibly because that mad Englishman had been offered his life\nin exchange for his honour. They laughed and laughed, no doubt because\nhe refused the bargain--Englishmen were always eccentric, and in these\ndays of equality and other devices of a free and glorious revolution,\nhonour was such a very marketable commodity that it seemed ridiculous to\nprize it quite so highly. Then they strolled away again and disappeared,\nwhilst Marguerite distinctly heard the scrunching of the path beneath\ntheir feet. She leant forward to peer still further into the darkness,\nfor this sound had seemed so absolutely real, but immediately a\ndetaining hand was place upon her arm and a sarcastic voice murmured at\nher elbow:\n\n\"The result, fair lady, would only be a broken leg or arm; the height is\nnot great enough for picturesque suicides, and believe me these ramparts\nare only haunted by ghosts.\"\n\nShe drew back as if a viper had stung her; for the moment she had become\noblivious of Chauvelin's presence. However, she would not take notice\nof his taunt, and, after a slight pause, he asked her if she could hear\nthe town crier over in the public streets.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\"What he says at this present moment is of vast importance to your\nladyship,\" he remarked drily.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship is a precious hostage. We are taking measures to guard\nour valuable property securely.\"\n\nMarguerite thought of the Abbe Foucquet, who no doubt was still quietly\ntelling his beads, even if in his heart he had begun to wonder what had\nbecome of her. She thought of Francois, who was the breadwinner, and of\nFelicite, who was blind.\n\n\"Methinks you and your colleagues have done that already,\" she said.\n\n\"Not as completely as we would wish. We know the daring of the Scarlet\nPimpernel. We are not even ashamed to admit that we fear his luck, his\nimpudence and his marvellous ingenuity.... Have I not told you that I\nhave the greatest possible respect for that mysterious English hero....\nAn old priest and two young children might be spirited away by that\nenigmatical adventurer, even whilst Lady Blakeney herself is made to\nvanish from our sight.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see your ladyship is taking my simple words as a confession\nof weakness,\" he continued, noting the swift sigh of hope which had\ninvoluntarily escaped her lips. \"Nay! and it please you, you shall\ndespise me for it. But a confession of weakness is the first sign of\nstrength. The Scarlet Pimpernel is still at large, and whilst we guard\nour hostage securely, he is bound to fall into our hands.\"\n\n\"Aye! still at large!\" she retorted with impulsive defiance. \"Think\nyou that all your bolts and bars, the ingenuity of yourself and your\ncolleagues, the collaboration of the devil himself, would succeed in\noutwitting the Scarlet Pimpernel, now that his purpose will be to try\nand drag ME from out your clutches.\"\n\nShe felt hopeful and proud. Now that she had the pure air of heaven in\nher lungs, that from afar she could smell the sea, and could feel\nthat perhaps in a straight line of vision from where she stood, the\n\"Day-Dream\" with Sir Percy on board, might be lying out there in the\nroads, it seemed impossible that he should fail in freeing her and those\npoor people--an old man and two children--whose lives depended on her\nown.\n\nBut Chauvelin only laughed a dry, sarcastic laugh and said:\n\n\"Hm! perhaps not!... It of course will depend on you and your\npersonality... your feelings in such matters... and whether an English\ngentleman likes to save his own skin at the expense of others.\"\n\nMarguerite shivered as if from cold.\n\n\"Ah! I see,\" resumed Chauvelin quietly, \"that your ladyship has not\nquite grasped the position. That public crier is a long way off: the\nwords have lingered on the evening breeze and have failed to reach your\nbrain. Do you suppose that I and my colleagues do not know that all the\ningenuity of which the Scarlet Pimpernel is capable will now be directed\nin piloting Lady Blakeney, and incidentally the Abbe Foucquet with his\nnephew and niece, safely across the Channel! Four people!... Bah! a\nbagatelle, for this mighty conspirator, who but lately snatched twenty\naristocrats from the prisons of Lyons.... Nay! nay! two children and\nan old man were not enough to guard our precious hostage, and I was not\nthinking of either the Abbe Foucquet or of the two children, when I\nsaid that an English gentleman would not save himself at the expense of\nothers.\"\n\n\"Of whom then were you thinking, Monsieur Chauvelin? Whom else have you\nset to guard the prize which you value so highly?\"\n\n\"The whole city of Boulogne,\" he replied simply.\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Let me make my point clear. My colleague, Citizen Collot d'Herbois,\nrode over from Paris yesterday; like myself he is a member of the\nCommittee of Public Safety whose duty it is to look after the welfare\nof France by punishing all those who conspire against her laws and the\nliberties of the people. Chief among these conspirators, whom it is our\nduty to punish is, of course, that impudent adventurer who calls himself\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel. He has given the government of France a great\ndeal of trouble through his attempts--mostly successful, as I have\nalready admitted,--at frustrating the just vengeance which an oppressed\ncountry has the right to wreak on those who have proved themselves to be\ntyrants and traitors.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary to recapitulate all this, Monsieur Chauvelin?\" she\nasked impatiently.\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied blandly. \"You see, my point is this. We feel\nthat in a measure now the Scarlet Pimpernel is in our power. Within the\nnext few hours he will land at Boulogne... Boulogne, where he has agreed\nto fight a duel with me... Boulogne, where Lady Blakeney happens to\nbe at this present moment... as you see, Boulogne has a great\nresponsibility to bear: just now she is to a certain extent the proudest\ncity in France, since she holds within her gates a hostage for the\nappearance on our shores of her country's most bitter enemy. But she\nmust not fall from that high estate. Her double duty is clear before\nher: she must guard Lady Blakeney and capture the Scarlet Pimpernel;\nif she fail in the former she must be punished, if she succeed in the\nlatter she shall be rewarded.\"\n\nHe paused and leaned out of the window again, whilst she watched him,\nbreathless and terrified. She was beginning to understand.\n\n\"Hark!\" he said, looking straight at her. \"Do you hear the crier now? He\nis proclaiming the punishment and the reward. He is making it clear\nto the citizens of Boulogne that on the day when the Scarlet Pimpernel\nfalls into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety a general amnesty\nwill be granted to all natives of Boulogne who are under arrest at the\npresent time, and a free pardon to all those who, born within these\ncity walls, are to-day under sentence of death.... A noble reward, eh?\nwell-deserved you'll admit.... Should you wonder then if the whole town\nof Boulogne were engaged just now in finding that mysterious hero, and\ndelivering him into our hands?... How many mothers, sisters, wives,\nthink you, at the present moment, would fail to lay hands on the English\nadventurer, if a husband's or a son's life or freedom happened to be\nat stake?... I have some records there,\" he continued, pointing in the\ndirection of the table, \"which tell me that there are five and thirty\nnatives of Boulogne in the local prisons, a dozen more in the prisons\nof Paris; of these at least twenty have been tried already and are\ncondemned to death. Every hour that the Scarlet Pimpernel succeeds in\nevading his captors so many deaths lie at his door. If he succeeds in\nonce more reaching England safely three score lives mayhap will be the\nprice of his escape.... Nay! but I see your ladyship is shivering with\ncold...\" he added with a dry little laugh, \"shall I close the window? or\ndo you wish to hear what punishment will be meted out to Boulogne, if on\nthe day that the Scarlet Pimpernel is captured, Lady Blakeney happens to\nhave left the shelter of these city walls?\"\n\n\"I pray you proceed, Monsieur,\" she rejoined with perfect calm.\n\n\"The Committee of Public Safety,\" he resumed, \"would look upon this city\nas a nest of traitors if on the day that the Scarlet Pimpernel becomes\nour prisoner Lady Blakeney herself, the wife of that notorious English\nspy, had already quitted Boulogne. The whole town knows by now that you\nare in our hands--you, the most precious hostage we can hold for the\nultimate capture of the man whom we all fear and detest. Virtually the\ntown-crier is at the present moment proclaiming to the inhabitants of\nthis city: 'We want that man, but we already have his wife, see to it,\ncitizens, that she does not escape! for if she do, we shall summarily\nshoot the breadwinner in every family in the town!'\"\n\nA cry of horror escaped Marguerite's parched lips.\n\n\"Are you devils then, all of you,\" she gasped, \"that you should think of\nsuch things?\"\n\n\"Aye! some of us are devils, no doubt,\" said Chauvelin drily; \"but why\nshould you honour us in this case with so flattering an epithet? We are\nmere men striving to guard our property and mean no harm to the citizens\nof Boulogne. We have threatened them, true! but is it not for you\nand that elusive Pimpernel to see that the threat is never put into\nexecution?\"\n\n\"You would not do it!\" she repeated, horror-stricken.\n\n\"Nay! I pray you, fair lady, do not deceive yourself. At present the\nproclamation sounds like a mere threat, I'll allow, but let me assure\nyou that if we fail to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel and if you on\nthe other hand are spirited out of this fortress by that mysterious\nadventurer we shall undoubtedly shoot or guillotine every able-bodied\nman and woman in this town.\"\n\nHe had spoken quietly and emphatically, neither with bombast, nor with\nrage, and Marguerite saw in his face nothing but a calm and ferocious\ndetermination, the determination of an entire nation embodied in this\none man, to be revenged at any cost. She would not let him see the depth\nof her despair, nor would she let him read in her face the unutterable\nhopelessness which filled her soul. It were useless to make an appeal\nto him: she knew full well that from him she could obtain neither\ngentleness nor mercy.\n\n\"I hope at last I have made the situation quite clear to your ladyship?\"\nhe was asking quite pleasantly now. \"See how easy is your position: you\nhave but to remain quiescent in room No. 6, and if any chance of escape\nbe offered you ere the Scarlet Pimpernel is captured, you need but to\nthink of all the families of Boulogne, who would be deprived of their\nbreadwinner--fathers and sons mostly, but there are girls too, who\nsupport their mothers or sisters; the fish curers of Boulogne are mostly\nwomen, and there are the net-makers and the seamstresses, all would\nsuffer if your ladyship were no longer to be found in No. 6 room of this\nancient fort, whilst all would be included in the amnesty if the Scarlet\nPimpernel fell into our hands...\"\n\nHe gave a low, satisfied chuckle which made Marguerite think of the evil\nspirits in hell exulting over the torments of unhappy lost souls.\n\n\"I think, Lady Blakeney,\" he added drily and making her an ironical bow,\n\"that your humble servant hath outwitted the elusive hero at last.\"\n\nQuietly he turned on his heel and went back into the room, Marguerite\nremaining motionless beside the open window, where the soft, brine-laden\nair, the distant murmur of the sea, the occasional cry of a sea-mew, all\nseemed to mock her agonizing despair.\n\nThe voice of the town-crier came nearer and nearer now: she could hear\nthe words he spoke quite distinctly: something about \"amnesty\" and\npardon, the reward for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the lives\nof men, women and children in exchange for his.\n\nOh! she knew what all that meant! that Percy would not hesitate one\nsingle instant to throw his life into the hands of his enemies, in\nexchange for that of others. Others! others! always others! this\nsigh that had made her heart ache so often in England, what terrible\nsignificance it bore now!\n\nAnd how he would suffer in his heart and in his pride, because of her\nwhom he could not even attempt to save since it would mean the death of\nothers! of others, always of others!\n\nShe wondered if he had already landed in Boulogne! Again she remembered\nthe vision on the landing stage: his massive figure, the glimpse she had\nof the loved form, in the midst of the crowd!\n\nThe moment he entered the town he would hear the proclamation read, see\nit posted up no doubt on every public building, and realize that she had\nbeen foolish enough to follow him, that she was a prisoner and that he\ncould do nothing to save her.\n\nWhat would he do? Marguerite at the thought instinctively pressed her\nhands to her heart, the agony of it all had become physically painful.\nShe hoped that perhaps this pain meant approaching death! oh! how easy\nwould this simple solution be!\n\nThe moon peered out from beneath the bank of clouds which had obscured\nher for so long; smiling, she drew her pencilled silver lines along the\nedge of towers and pinnacles, the frowning Beffroi and those stony walls\nwhich seemed to Marguerite as if they encircled a gigantic graveyard.\n\nThe town-crier had evidently ceased to read the proclamation. One by\none the windows in the public square were lighted up from within. The\ncitizens of Boulogne wanted to think over the strange events which had\noccurred without their knowledge, yet which were apparently to have such\ndireful or such joyous consequences for them.\n\nA man to be captured! the mysterious English adventurer of whom they\nhad all heard, but whom nobody had seen. And a woman--his wife--to be\nguarded until the man was safely under lock and key.\n\nMarguerite felt as if she could almost hear them talking it over and\nvowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should\nsoon be captured.\n\nA gentle wind stirred the old gnarled trees on the southern ramparts, a\nwind that sounded like the sigh of swiftly dying hope.\n\nWhat could Percy do now? His hands were tied, and he was inevitably\ndestined to endure the awful agony of seeing the woman he loved die a\nterrible death beside him.\n\nHaving captured him, they would not keep him long; no necessity for a\ntrial, for detention, for formalities of any kind. A summary execution\nat dawn on the public place, a roll of drums, a public holiday to mark\nthe joyful event, and a brave man will have ceased to live, a noble\nheart have stilled its beatings forever, whilst a whole nation gloried\nover the deed.\n\n\"Sleep, citizens of Boulogne! all is still!\"\n\nThe night watchman had replaced the town-crier. All was quiet within\nthe city walls: the inhabitants could sleep in peace, a beneficent\ngovernment was wakeful and guarding their rest.\n\nBut many of the windows of the town remained lighted up, and at a little\ndistance below her, round the corner so that she could not see it, a\nsmall crowd must have collected in front of the gateway which led into\nthe courtyard of the Gayole Fort. Marguerite could hear a persistent\nmurmur of voices, mostly angry and threatening, and once there were loud\ncries of: \"English spies,\" and \"a la lanterne!\"\n\n\"The citizens of Boulogne are guarding the treasures of France!\"\ncommented Chauvelin drily, as he laughed again, that cruel, mirthless\nlaugh of his.\n\nThen she roused herself from her torpor: she did not know how long she\nhad stood beside the open window, but the fear seized her that that man\nmust have seen and gloated over the agony of her mind. She straightened\nher graceful figure, threw back her proud head defiantly, and quietly\nwalked up to the table, where Chauvelin seemed once more absorbed in the\nperusal of his papers.\n\n\"Is this interview over?\" she asked quietly, and without the slightest\ntremor in her voice. \"May I go now?\"\n\n\"As soon as you wish,\" he replied with gentle irony.\n\nHe regarded her with obvious delight, for truly she was beautiful: grand\nin this attitude of defiant despair. The man, who had spent the last\nhalf-hour in martyrizing her, gloried over the misery which he had\nwrought, and which all her strength of will could not entirely banish\nfrom her face.\n\n\"Will you believe me, Lady Blakeney?\" he added, \"that there is no\npersonal animosity in my heart towards you or your husband? Have I not\ntold you that I do not wish to compass his death?\"\n\n\"Yet you propose to send him to the guillotine as soon as you have laid\nhands on him.\"\n\n\"I have explained to you the measures which I have taken in order to\nmake sure that we DO lay hands on the Scarlet Pimpernel. Once he is in\nour power, it will rest with him to walk to the guillotine or to embark\nwith you on board his yacht.\"\n\n\"You propose to place an alternative before Sir Percy Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"To offer him his life?\"\n\n\"And that of his charming wife.\"\n\n\"In exchange for what?\"\n\n\"His honour.\"\n\n\"He will refuse, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nThen he touched a handbell which stood on the table, and within a few\nseconds the door was opened and the soldier who had led Marguerite\nhither, re-entered the room.\n\nThe interview was at an end. It had served its purpose. Marguerite knew\nnow that she must not even think of escape for herself, or hope for\nsafety for the man she loved. Of Chauvelin's talk of a bargain which\nwould touch Percy's honour she would not even think: and she was too\nproud to ask anything further from him.\n\nChauvelin stood up and made her a deep bow, as she crossed the room and\nfinally went out of the door. The little company of soldiers closed in\naround her and she was once more led along the dark passages, back to\nher own prison cell.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV: Colleagues\n\n\n\nAs soon as the door had closed behind Marguerite, there came from\nsomewhere in the room the sound of a yawn, a grunt and a volley of\noaths.\n\nThe flickering light of the tallow candles had failed to penetrate into\nall the corners, and now from out one of these dark depths, a certain\nsomething began to detach itself, and to move forward towards the table\nat which Chauvelin had once more resumed his seat.\n\n\"Has the damned aristocrat gone at last?\" queried a hoarse voice, as a\nburly body clad in loose-fitting coat and mud-stained boots and breeches\nappeared within the narrow circle of light.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Chauvelin curtly.\n\n\"And a cursed long time you have been with the baggage,\" grunted the\nother surlily. \"Another five minutes and I'd have taken the matter in my\nown hands.\n\n\"An assumption of authority,\" commented Chauvelin quietly, \"to which\nyour position here does not entitle you, Citizen Collot.\"\n\nCollot d'Herbois lounged lazily forward, and presently he threw his\nill-knit figure into the chair lately vacated by Marguerite. His heavy,\nsquare face bore distinct traces of the fatigue endured in the past\ntwenty-four hours on horseback or in jolting market waggons. His temper\ntoo appeared to have suffered on the way, and, at Chauvelin's curt and\ndictatorial replies, he looked as surly as a chained dog.\n\n\"You were wasting your breath over that woman,\" he muttered, bringing a\nlarge and grimy fist heavily down on the table, \"and your measures are\nnot quite so sound as your fondly imagine, Citizen Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"They were mostly of your imagining, Citizen Collot,\" rejoined the other\nquietly, \"and of your suggestion.\"\n\n\"I added a touch of strength and determination to your mild\nmilk-and-water notions, Citizen,\" snarled Collot spitefully. \"I'd have\nknocked that intriguing woman's brains out at the very first possible\nopportunity, had I been consulted earlier than this.\"\n\n\"Quite regardless of the fact that such violent measures would\ncompletely damn all our chances of success as far as the capture of\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel is concerned,\" remarked Chauvelin drily, with\na contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. \"Once his wife is dead, the\nEnglishman will never run his head into the noose which I have so\ncarefully prepared for him.\"\n\n\"So you say, Chauvelin; and therefore I suggested to you certain\nmeasures to prevent the woman escaping which you will find adequate, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"You need have no fear, Citizen Collot,\" said Chauvelin curtly, \"this\nwoman will make no attempt at escape now.\"\n\n\"If she does...\" and Collot d'Herbois swore an obscene oath.\n\n\"I think she understands that we mean to put our threat in execution.\"\n\n\"Threat?... It was no empty threat, Citizen.... Sacre tonnerre! if that\nwoman escapes now, by all the devils in hell I swear that I'll wield the\nguillotine myself and cut off the head of every able-bodied man or woman\nin Boulogne, with my own hands.\"\n\nAs he said this his face assumed such an expression of inhuman cruelty,\nsuch a desire to kill, such a savage lust for blood, that instinctively\nChauvelin shuddered and shrank away from his colleague. All through\nhis career there is no doubt that this man, who was of gentle birth,\nof gentle breeding, and who had once been called M. le Marquis de\nChauvelin, must have suffered in his susceptibilities and in his pride\nwhen in contact with the revolutionaries with whom he had chosen to cast\nhis lot. He could not have thrown off all his old ideas of refinement\nquite so easily, as to feel happy in the presence of such men as Collot\nd'Herbois, or Marat in his day--men who had become brute beasts, more\nferocious far than any wild animal, more scientifically cruel than any\nfeline prowler in jungle or desert.\n\nOne look in Collot's distorted face was sufficient at this moment to\nconvince Chauvelin that it were useless for him to view the proclamation\nagainst the citizens of Boulogne merely as an idle threat, even if he\nhad wished to do so. That Marguerite would not, under the circumstances,\nattempt to escape, that Sir Percy Blakeney himself would be forced\nto give up all thoughts of rescuing her, was a foregone conclusion\nin Chauvelin's mind, but if this high-born English gentleman had not\nhappened to be the selfless hero that he was, if Marguerite Blakeney\nwere cast in a different, a rougher mould--if, in short, the Scarlet\nPimpernel in the face of the proclamation did succeed in dragging his\nwife out of the clutches of the Terrorists, then it was equally certain\nthat Collot d'Herbois would carry out his rabid and cruel reprisals\nto the full. And if in the course of the wholesale butchery of the\nable-bodied and wage-earning inhabitants of Boulogne, the headsman\nshould sink worn out, then would this ferocious sucker of blood put his\nown hand to the guillotine, with the same joy and lust which he had\nfelt when he ordered one hundred and thirty-eight women of Nantes to\nbe stripped naked by the soldiery before they were flung helter-skelter\ninto the river.\n\nA touch of strength and determination! Aye! Citizen Collot d'Herbois had\nplenty of that. Was it he, or Carriere who at Arras commanded mothers to\nstand by while their children were being guillotined? And surely it was\nMaignet, Collot's friend and colleague, who at Bedouin, because the Red\nFlag of the Republic had been mysteriously torn down over night, burnt\nthe entire little village down to the last hovel and guillotined every\none of the three hundred and fifty inhabitants.\n\nAnd Chauvelin knew all that. Nay, more! he was himself a member of that\nso-called government which had countenanced these butcheries, by giving\nunlimited powers to men like Collot, like Maignet and Carriere. He\nwas at one with them in their republican ideas and he believed in the\nregeneration and the purification of France, through the medium of the\nguillotine, but he propounded his theories and carried out his most\nbloodthirsty schemes with physically clean hands and in an immaculately\ncut coat.\n\nEven now when Collot d'Herbois lounged before him, with mud-bespattered\nlegs stretched out before him, with dubious linen at neck and wrists,\nand an odour of rank tobacco and stale, cheap wine pervading his whole\npersonality, the more fastidious man of the world, who had consorted\nwith the dandies of London and Brighton, winced at the enforced\nproximity.\n\nBut it was the joint characteristic of all these men who had turned\nFrance into a vast butchery and charnel-house, that they all feared\nand hated one another, even more whole-heartedly than they hated the\naristocrats and so-called traitors whom they sent to the guillotine.\nCitizen Lebon is said to have dipped his sword into the blood which\nflowed from the guillotine, whilst exclaiming: \"Comme je l'aime ce sang\ncoule de traitre!\" but he and Collot and Danton and Robespierre, all of\nthem in fact would have regarded with more delight still the blood of\nany one of their colleagues.\n\nAt this very moment Collot d'Herbois and Chauvelin would with utmost\nsatisfaction have denounced, one the other, to the tender mercies of the\nPublic Prosecutor. Collot made no secret of his hatred for Chauvelin,\nand the latter disguised it but thinly under the veneer of contemptuous\nindifference.\n\n\"As for that dammed Englishman,\" added Collot now, after a slight pause,\nand with another savage oath, \"if 'tis my good fortune to lay hands on\nhim, I'd shoot him then and there like a mad dog, and rid France once\nand forever of this accursed spy.\"\n\n\"And think you, Citizen Collot,\" rejoined Chauvelin with a shrug of the\nshoulders, \"that France would be rid of all English adventurers by the\nsummary death of this one man?\"\n\n\"He is the ringleader, at any rate...\"\n\n\"And has at least nineteen disciples to continue his traditions of\nconspiracy and intrigue. None perhaps so ingenuous as himself, none\nwith the same daring and good luck perhaps, but still a number of ardent\nfools only too ready to follow in the footsteps of their chief. Then\nthere's the halo of martyrdom around the murdered hero, the enthusiasm\ncreated by his noble death... Nay! nay, Citizen, you have not lived\namong these English people, you do not understand them, or you would not\ntalk of sending their popular hero to an honoured grave.\"\n\nBut Collot d'Herbois only shook his powerful frame like some big, sulky\ndog, and spat upon the floor to express his contempt of this wild talk\nwhich seemed to have no real tangible purpose.\n\n\"You have not caught your Scarlet Pimpernel yet, Citizen,\" he said with\na snort.\n\n\"No, but I will, after sundown to-morrow.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I have ordered the Angelus to be rung at one of the closed churches,\nand he agreed to fight a duel with me on the southern ramparts at that\nhour and on that day,\" said Chauvelin simply.\n\n\"You take him for a fool?\" sneered Collot.\n\n\"No, only for a foolhardy adventurer.\"\n\n\"You imagine that with his wife as hostage in our hands, and the whole\ncity of Boulogne on the lookout for him for the sake of the amnesty,\nthat the man would be fool enough to walk on those ramparts at a given\nhour, for the express purpose of getting himself caught by you and your\nmen?\"\n\n\"I am quite sure that if we do not lay hands on him before that given\nhour, that he will be on the ramparts at the Angelus to-morrow,\" said\nChauvelin emphatically.\n\nCollot shrugged his broad shoulders.\n\n\"Is the man mad?\" he asked with an incredulous laugh.\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" rejoined the other with a smile.\n\n\"And having caught your hare,\" queried Collot, \"how do you propose to\ncook him?\"\n\n\"Twelve picked men will be on the ramparts ready to seize him the moment\nhe appears.\"\n\n\"And to shoot him at sight, I hope.\"\n\n\"Only as a last resource, for the Englishman is powerful and may cause\nour half-famished men a good deal of trouble. But I want him alive, if\npossible...\"\n\n\"Why? a dead lion is safer than a live one any day.\"\n\n\"Oh! we'll kill him right enough, Citizen. I pray you have no fear. I\nhold a weapon ready for that meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel, which will be\na thousand times more deadly and more effectual than a chance shot, or\neven a guillotine.\"\n\n\"What weapon is that, Citizen Chauvelin?\"\n\nChauvelin leaned forward across the table and rested his chin in his\nhands; instinctively Collot too leaned towards him, and both men peered\nfurtively round them as if wondering if prying eyes happened to be\nlurking round. It was Chauvelin's pale eyes which now gleamed with\nhatred and with an insatiable lust for revenge at least as powerful as\nCollot's lust for blood; the unsteady light of the tallow candles threw\ngrotesque shadows across his brows, and his mouth was set in such rigid\nlines of implacable cruelty that the brutish sot beside him gazed on him\namazed, vaguely scenting here a depth of feeling which was beyond his\npower to comprehend. He repeated his question under his breath:\n\n\"What weapon do you mean to use against that accursed spy, Citizen\nChauvelin?\"\n\n\"Dishonour and ridicule!\" replied the other quietly.\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"In exchange for his life and that of his wife.\"\n\n\"As the woman told you just now... he will refuse.\"\n\n\"We shall see, Citizen.\"\n\n\"You are mad to think such things, Citizen, and ill serve the Republic\nby sparing her bitterest foe.\"\n\nA long, sarcastic laugh broke from Chauvelin's parted lips.\n\n\"Spare him?--spare the Scarlet Pimpernel!...\" he ejaculated. \"Nay,\nCitizen, you need have no fear of that. But believe me, I have schemes\nin my head by which the man whom we all hate will be more truly\ndestroyed than your guillotine could ever accomplish: schemes, whereby\nthe hero who is now worshipped in England as a demi-god will suddenly\nbecome an object of loathing and of contempt.... Ah! I see you\nunderstand me now... I wish to so cover him with ridicule that the very\nname of the small wayside flower will become a term of derision and of\nscorn. Only then shall we be rid of these pestilential English spies,\nonly then will the entire League of the Scarlet Pimpernel become a thing\nof the past when its whilom leader, now thought akin to a god, will have\nfound refuge in a suicide's grave, from the withering contempt of the\nentire world.\"\n\nChauvelin had spoken low, hardly above a whisper, and the echo of his\nlast words died away in the great, squalid room like a long-drawn-out\nsigh. There was dead silence for a while save for the murmur in the\nwind outside and from the floor above the measured tread of the sentinel\nguarding the precious hostage in No. 6.\n\nBoth men were staring straight in front of them. Collot d'Herbois\nincredulous, half-contemptuous, did not altogether approve of these\nschemes which seemed to him wild and uncanny: he liked the direct\nsimplicity of a summary trial, of the guillotine, or of his own well\nstage-managed \"Noyades.\" He did not feel that any ridicule or dishonour\nwould necessarily paralyze a man in his efforts at intrigue, and would\nhave liked to set Chauvelin's authority aside, to behead the woman\nupstairs and then to take his chances of capturing the man later on.\n\nBut the orders of the Committee of Public Safety had been peremptory: he\nwas to be Chauvelin's help--not his master, and to obey in all things.\nHe did not dare to take any initiative in the matter, for in that case,\nif he failed, the reprisals against him would indeed be terrible.\n\nHe was fairly satisfied now that Chauvelin had accepted his suggestion\nof summarily sending to the guillotine one member of every family\nresident in Boulogne, if Marguerite succeeded in effecting an escape,\nand, of a truth, Chauvelin had hailed the fiendish suggestion with\ndelight. The old abbe with his nephew and niece were undoubtedly\nnot sufficient deterrents against the daring schemes of the Scarlet\nPimpernel, who, as a matter of fact, could spirit them out of Boulogne\njust as easily as he would his own wife.\n\nCollot's plan tied Marguerite to her own prison cell more completely\nthan any other measure could have done, more so indeed than the\noriginator thereof knew or believed.... A man like this d'Herbois--born\nin the gutter, imbued with every brutish tradition, which generations of\njail-birds had bequeathed to him,--would not perhaps fully realize the\nfact that neither Sir Percy nor Marguerite Blakeney would ever save\nthemselves at the expense of others. He had merely made the suggestion,\nbecause he felt that Chauvelin's plans were complicated and obscure,\nand above all insufficient, and that perhaps after all the English\nadventurer and his wife would succeed in once more outwitting him, when\nthere would remain the grand and bloody compensation of a wholesale\nbutchery in Boulogne.\n\nBut Chauvelin was quite satisfied. He knew that under present\ncircumstances neither Sir Percy nor Marguerite would make any attempt to\nescape. The ex-ambassador had lived in England: he understood the class\nto which these two belonged, and was quite convinced that no attempt\nwould be made on either side to get Lady Blakeney away whilst the\npresent ferocious order against the bread-winner of every family in the\ntown held good.\n\nAye! the measures were sound enough. Chauvelin was easy in his\nmind about that. In another twenty-four hours he would hold the man\ncompletely in his power who had so boldly outwitted him last year;\nto-night he would sleep in peace: an entire city was guarding the\nprecious hostage.\n\n\"We'll go to bed now, Citizen,\" he said to Collot, who, tired and sulky,\nwas moodily fingering the papers on the table. The scraping sound which\nhe made thereby grated on Chauvelin's overstrung nerves. He wanted to\nbe alone, and the sleepy brute's presence here jarred on his own solemn\nmood.\n\nTo his satisfaction, Collot grunted a surly assent. Very leisurely he\nrose from his chair, stretched out his loose limbs, shook himself like\na shaggy cur, and without uttering another word he gave his colleague a\ncurt nod, and slowly lounged out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV: The Unexpected\n\n\n\nChauvelin heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction when Collot d'Herbois\nfinally left him to himself. He listened for awhile until the heavy\nfootsteps died away in the distance, then leaning back in his chair, he\ngave himself over to the delights of the present situation.\n\nMarguerite in his power. Sir Percy Blakeney compelled to treat for her\nrescue if he did not wish to see her die a miserable death.\n\n\"Aye! my elusive hero,\" he muttered to himself, \"methinks that we shall\nbe able to cry quits at last.\"\n\nOutside everything had become still. Even the wind in the trees out\nthere on the ramparts had ceased their melancholy moaning. The man was\nalone with his thoughts. He felt secure and at peace, sure of victory,\ncontent to await the events of the next twenty-four hours. The other\nside of the door the guard which he had picked out from amongst the more\nfeeble and ill-fed garrison of the little city for attendance on his own\nperson were ranged ready to respond to his call.\n\n\"Dishonour and ridicule! Derision and scorn!\" he murmured, gloating\nover the very sound of these words, which expressed all that he hoped to\naccomplish, \"utter abjections, then perhaps a suicide's grave...\"\n\nHe loved the silence around him, for he could murmur these words and\nhear them echoing against the bare stone walls like the whisperings of\nall the spirits of hate which were waiting to lend him their aid.\n\nHow long he had remained thus absorbed in his meditations, he could not\nafterwards have said; a minute or two perhaps at most, whilst he leaned\nback in his chair with eyes closed, savouring the sweets of his own\nthoughts, when suddenly the silence was interrupted by a loud and\npleasant laugh and a drawly voice speaking in merry accents:\n\n\"The lud live you, Monsieur Chaubertin, and pray how do you propose to\naccomplish all these pleasant things?\"\n\nIn a moment Chauvelin was on his feet and with eyes dilated, lips parted\nin awed bewilderment, he was gazing towards the open window, where\nastride upon the sill, one leg inside the room, the other out, and with\nthe moon shining full on his suit of delicate-coloured cloth, his wide\ncaped coat and elegant chapeau-bras, sat the imperturbable Sir Percy.\n\n\"I heard you muttering such pleasant words, Monsieur,\" continued\nBlakeney calmly, \"that the temptation seized me to join in the\nconversation. A man talking to himself is ever in a sorry plight... he\nis either a mad man or a fool...\"\n\nHe laughed his own quaint and inane laugh and added apologetically:\n\n\"Far be if from me, sir, to apply either epithet to you... demmed bad\nform calling another fellow names... just when he does not quite feel\nhimself, eh?... You don't feel quite yourself, I fancy just now... eh,\nMonsieur Chauberin... er... beg pardon, Chauvelin...\"\n\nHe sat there quite comfortably, one slender hand resting on the\ngracefully-fashioned hilt of his sword--the sword of Lorenzo Cenci,--the\nother holding up the gold-rimed eyeglass through which he was regarding\nhis avowed enemy; he was dressed as for a ball, and his perpetually\namiable smile lurked round the corners of his firm lips.\n\nChauvelin had undoubtedly for the moment lost his presence of mind. He\ndid not even think of calling to his picked guard, so completely taken\naback was he by this unforeseen move on the part of Sir Percy. Yet,\nobviously, he should have been ready for this eventuality. Had he not\ncaused the town-crier to loudly proclaim throughout the city that if\nONE female prisoner escaped from Fort Gayole the entire able-bodied\npopulation of Boulogne would suffer?\n\nThe moment Sir Percy entered the gates of the town, he could not help\nbut hear the proclamation, and hear at the same time that this one\nfemale prisoner who was so precious a charge, was the wife of the\nEnglish spy: the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nMoreover, was it not a fact that whenever or wherever the Scarlet\nPimpernel was least expected there and then would he surely appear?\nHaving once realized that it was his wife who was incarcerated in Fort\nGayole, was it not natural that he would go and prowl around the prison,\nand along the avenue on the summit of the southern ramparts, which was\naccessible to every passer-by? No doubt he had lain in hiding among\nthe trees, had perhaps caught snatches of Chauvelin's recent talk with\nCollot.\n\nAye! it was all so natural, so simple! Strange that it should have been\nso unexpected!\n\nFurious at himself for his momentary stupor, he now made a vigorous\neffort to face his impudent enemy with the same sang-froid of which the\nlatter had so inexhaustible a fund.\n\nHe walked quietly towards the window, compelling his nerves to perfect\ncalm and his mood to indifference. The situation had ceased to astonish\nhim; already his keen mind had seen its possibilities, its grimness and\nits humour, and he was quite prepared to enjoy these to the full.\n\nSir Percy now was dusting the sleeve of his coat with a lace-edged\nhandkerchief, but just as Chauvelin was about to come near him, he\nstretched out one leg, turning the point of a dainty boot towards the\nex-ambassador.\n\n\"Would you like to take hold of me by the leg, Monsieur Chaubertin?\" he\nsaid gaily. \"'Tis more effectual than a shoulder, and your picked guard\nof six stalwart fellows can have the other leg.... Nay! I pray you,\nsir, do not look at me like that.... I vow that it is myself and not my\nghost.... But if you still doubt me, I pray you call the guard... ere I\nfly out again towards that fitful moon...\"\n\n\"Nay, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, with a steady voice, \"I have no\nthought that you will take flight just yet.... Methinks you desire\nconversation with me, or you had not paid me so unexpected a visit.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, the air is too oppressive for lengthy conversation... I was\nstrolling along these ramparts, thinking of our pleasant encounter at\nthe hour of the Angelus to-morrow... when this light attracted me....\nfeared I had lost my way and climbed the window to obtain information.\"\n\n\"As to your way to the nearest prison cell, Sir Percy?\" queried\nChauvelin drily.\n\n\"As to anywhere, where I could sit more comfortably than on this demmed\nsill.... It must be very dusty, and I vow 'tis terribly hard...\"\n\n\"I presume, Sir Percy, that you did my colleague and myself the honour\nof listening to our conversation?\"\n\n\"An you desired to talk secrets, Monsieur... er... Chaubertin... you\nshould have shut this window... and closed this avenue of trees against\nthe chance passer-by.\"\n\n\"What we said was no secret, Sir Percy. It is all over the town\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Quite so... you were only telling the devil your mind... eh?\"\n\n\"I had also been having conversation with Lady Blakeney.... Pray did you\nhear any of that, sir?\"\n\nBut Sir Percy had evidently not heard the question, for he seemed quite\nabsorbed in the task of removing a speck of dust from his immaculate\nchapeau-bras.\n\n\"These hats are all the rage in England just now,\" he said airily, \"but\nthey have had their day, do you not think so, Monsieur? When I return\nto town, I shall have to devote my whole mind to the invention of a new\nheadgear...\"\n\n\"When will you return to England, Sir Percy?\" queried Chauvelin with\ngood-natured sarcasm.\n\n\"At the turn of the tide to-morrow eve, Monsieur,\" replied Blakeney.\n\n\"In company with Lady Blakeney?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir... and yours if you will honour us with your company.\"\n\n\"If you return to England to-morrow, Sir Percy, Lady Blakeney, I fear\nme, cannot accompany you.\"\n\n\"You astonish me, sir,\" rejoined Blakeney with an exclamation of genuine\nand unaffected surprise. \"I wonder now what would prevent her?\"\n\n\"All those whose death would be the result of her flight, if she\nsucceeded in escaping from Boulogne...\"\n\nBut Sir Percy was staring at him, with wide open eyes expressive of\nutmost amazement.\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear.... Lud! but that sounds most unfortunate...\"\n\n\"You have not heard of the measures which I have taken to prevent Lady\nBlakeney quitting this city without our leave?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur Chaubertin... no... I have heard nothing...\" rejoined Sir\nPercy blandly. \"I lead a very retired life when I come abroad and...\"\n\n\"Would you wish to hear them now?\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary, sir, I assure you... and the hour is getting\nlate...\"\n\n\"Sir Percy, are you aware of the fact that unless you listen to what I\nhave to say, your wife will be dragged before the Committee of Public\nSafety in Paris within the next twenty-four hours?\" said Chauvelin\nfirmly.\n\n\"What swift horses you must have, sir,\" quoth Blakeney pleasantly. \"Lud!\nto think of it!... I always heard that these demmed French horses would\nnever beat ours across country.\"\n\nBut Chauvelin now would not allow himself to be ruffled by Sir Percy's\napparent indifference. Keen reader of emotions as he was, he had\nnot failed to note a distinct change in the drawly voice, a sound\nof something hard and trenchant in the flippant laugh, ever since\nMarguerite's name was first mentioned. Blakeney's attitude was\napparently as careless, as audacious as before, but Chauvelin's keen\neyes had not missed the almost imperceptible tightening of the jaw and\nthe rapid clenching of one hand on the sword hilt even whilst the other\ntoyed in graceful idleness with the filmy Mechlin lace cravat.\n\nSir Percy's head was well thrown back, and the pale rays of the moon\ncaught the edge of the clear-cut profile, the low massive brow, the\ndrooping lids through which the audacious plotter was lazily regarding\nthe man who held not only his own life, but that of the woman who was\ninfinitely dear to him, in the hollow of his hand.\n\n\"I am afraid, Sir Percy,\" continued Chauvelin drily, \"that you are under\nthe impression that bolts and bars will yield to your usual good luck,\nnow that so precious a life is at stake as that of Lady Blakeney.\"\n\n\"I am a greater believer in impressions, Monsieur Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"I told her just now that if she quitted Boulogne ere the Scarlet\nPimpernel is in our hands, we should summarily shoot one member of every\nfamily in the town--the bread-winner.\"\n\n\"A pleasant conceit, Monsieur... and one that does infinite credit to\nyour inventive faculties.\"\n\n\"Lady Blakeney, therefore, we hold safely enough,\" continued Chauvelin,\nwho no longer heeded the mocking observations of his enemy; \"as for the\nScarlet Pimpernel...\"\n\n\"You have but to ring a bell, to raise a voice, and he too will be under\nlock and key within the next two minutes, eh?... Passons, Monsieur...\nyou are dying to say something further... I pray you proceed... your\nengaging countenance is becoming quite interesting in its seriousness.\"\n\n\"What I wish to say to you, Sir Percy, is in the nature of a proposed\nbargain.\"\n\n\"Indeed?... Monsieur, you are full of surprises... like a pretty\nwoman.... And pray what are the terms of this proposed bargain?\"\n\n\"Your side of the bargain, Sir Percy, or mine? Which will you hear\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Oh yours, Monsieur... yours, I pray you.... Have I not said that you\nare like a pretty woman?... Place aux dames, sir! always!\"\n\n\"My share of the bargain, sir, is simple enough: Lady Blakeney, escorted\nby yourself and any of your friends who might be in this city at\nthe time, shall leave Boulogne harbour at sunset to-morrow, free and\nunmolested, if you on the other hand will do your share...\"\n\n\"I don't yet know what my share in this interesting bargain is to be,\nsir... but for the sake of argument let us suppose that I do not carry\nit out.... What then?...\"\n\n\"Then, Sir Percy... putting aside for the moment the question of the\nScarlet Pimpernel altogether... then, Lady Blakeney will be taken to\nParis, and will be incarcerated in the prison of the Temple lately\nvacated by Marie Antoinette--there she will be treated in exactly the\nsame was as the ex-queen is now being treated in the Conciergerie.... Do\nyou know what that means, Sir Percy?... It does not mean a summary trial\nand a speedy death, with the halo and glory of martyrdom thrown in... it\nmeans days, weeks, nay, months, perhaps, of misery and humiliation...\nit means, that like Marie Antoinette, she will never be allowed solitude\nfor one single instant of the day or night... it means the constant\nproximity of soldiers, drunk with cruelty and with hate... the insults,\nthe shame...\"\n\n\"You hound!... you dog!... you cur!... do you not see that I must\nstrangle you for this!...\"\n\nThe attack had been so sudden and so violent that Chauvelin had not the\ntime to utter the slightest call for help. But a second ago, Sir Percy\nBlakeney had been sitting on the window-sill, outwardly listening with\nperfect calm to what his enemy had to say; now he was at the latter's\nthroat, pressing with long and slender hands the breath out of the\nFrenchman's body, his usually placid face distorted into a mask of hate.\n\n\"You cur!... you cur!...\" he repeated, \"am I to kill you or will you\nunsay those words?\"\n\nThen suddenly he relaxed his grip. The habits of a lifetime would not\nbe gainsaid even now. A second ago his face had been livid with rage\nand hate, now a quick flush overspread it, as if he were ashamed of this\nloss of self-control. He threw the little Frenchman away from him like\nhe would a beast which had snarled, and passed his hand across his brow.\n\n\"Lud forgive me!\" he said quaintly, \"I had almost lost my temper.\"\n\nChauvelin was not slow in recovering himself. He was plucky and alert,\nand his hatred for this man was so great that he had actually ceased to\nfear him. Now he quietly readjusted his cravat, made a vigorous effort\nto re-conquer his breath, and said firmly as soon as he could contrive\nto speak at all:\n\n\"And if you did strangle me, Sir Percy, you would do yourself no\ngood. The fate which I have mapped out for Lady Blakeney, would then\nirrevocably be hers, for she is in our power and none of my colleagues\nare disposed to offer you a means of saving her from it, as I am ready\nto do.\"\n\nBlakeney was now standing in the middle of the room, with his hands\nburied in the pockets of his breeches, his manner and attitude once more\ncalm, debonnair, expressive of lofty self-possession and of absolute\nindifference. He came quite close to the meagre little figure of his\nexultant enemy, thereby forcing the latter to look up at him.\n\n\"Oh!... ah!... yes!\" he said airily, \"I had nigh forgotten... you were\ntalking of a bargain... my share of it... eh?... Is it me you want?...\nDo you wish to see me in your Paris prisons?... I assure you, sir, that\nthe propinquity of drunken soldiers may disgust me, but it would in no\nway disturb the equanimity of my temper.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of that, Sir Percy--and I can but repeat what I had the\nhonour of saying to Lady Blakeney just now--I do not desire the death of\nso accomplished a gentleman as yourself.\"\n\n\"Strange, Monsieur,\" retorted Blakeney, with a return of his accustomed\nflippancy. \"Now I do desire your death very strongly indeed--there would\nbe so much less vermin on the face of the earth.... But pardon me--I was\ninterrupting you.... Will you be so kind as to proceed?\"\n\nChauvelin had not winced at the insult. His enemy's attitude now left\nhim completely indifferent. He had seen that self-possessed man of\nthe world, that dainty and fastidious dandy, in the throes of an\novermastering passion. He had very nearly paid with his life for the\njoy of having roused that supercilious and dormant lion. In fact he was\nready to welcome any insults from Sir Percy Blakeney now, since these\nwould be only additional evidences that the Englishman's temper was not\nyet under control.\n\n\"I will try to be brief, Sir Percy,\" he said, setting himself the\ntask of imitating his antagonist's affected manner. \"Will you not sit\ndown?... We must try and discuss these matters like two men of the\nworld.... As for me, I am always happiest beside a board littered with\npapers.... I am not an athlete, Sir Percy... and serve my country with\nmy pen rather than with my fists.\"\n\nWhilst he spoke he had reached the table and once more took the chair\nwhereon he had been sitting lately, when he dreamed the dreams which\nwere so near realization now. He pointed with a graceful gesture to the\nother vacant chair, which Blakeney took without a word.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Chauvelin with a sigh of satisfaction, \"I see that we are\nabout to understand one another.... I have always felt it was a pity,\nSir Percy, that you and I could not discuss certain matters pleasantly\nwith one another.... Now, about this unfortunate incident of Lady\nBlakeney's incarceration, I would like you to believe that I had no part\nin the arrangements which have been made for her detention in Paris. My\ncolleagues have arranged it all... and I have vainly tried to protest\nagainst the rigorous measures which are to be enforced against her in\nthe Temple prison.... But these are answering so completely in the\ncase of the ex-queen, they have so completely broken her spirit and her\npride, that my colleagues felt that they would prove equally useful in\norder to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel--through his wife--to an humbler\nframe of mind.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, distinctly pleased with his peroration, satisfied\nthat his voice had been without a tremor and his face impassive, and\nwondering what effect this somewhat lengthy preamble had upon Sir\nPercy, who through it all had remained singularly quiet. Chauvelin was\npreparing himself for the next effect which he hoped to produce, and\nwas vaguely seeking for the best words with which to fully express his\nmeaning, when he was suddenly startled by a sound as unexpected as it\nwas disconcerting.\n\nIt was the sound of a loud and prolonged snore. He pushed the candle\naside, which somewhat obstructed his line of vision, and casting a rapid\nglance at the enemy, with whose life he was toying even as a cat doth\nwith that of a mouse, he saw that the aforesaid mouse was calmly and\nunmistakably asleep.\n\nAn impatient oath escaped Chauvelin's lips, and he brought his fist\nheavily down on the table, making the metal candlesticks rattle and\ncausing Sir Percy to open one sleepy eye.\n\n\"A thousand pardons, sir,\" said Blakeney with a slight yawn. \"I am so\ndemmed fatigued, and your preface was unduly long.... Beastly bad form,\nI know, going to sleep during a sermon... but I haven't had a wink of\nsleep all day.... I pray you to excuse me...\"\n\n\"Will you condescend to listen, Sir Percy?\" queried Chauvelin\nperemptorily, \"or shall I call the guard and give up all thoughts of\ntreating with you?\"\n\n\"Just whichever you demmed well prefer, sir,\" rejoined Blakeney\nimpatiently.\n\nAnd once more stretching out his long limbs, he buried his hands in\nthe pockets of his breeches and apparently prepared himself for another\nquiet sleep. Chauvelin looked at him for a moment, vaguely wondering\nwhat to do next. He felt strangely irritated at what he firmly believed\nwas mere affectation on Blakeney's part, and although he was burning\nwith impatience to place the terms of the proposed bargain before this\nman, yet he would have preferred to be interrogated, to deliver his\n\"either-or\" with becoming sternness and decision, rather than to take\nthe initiative in this discussion, where he should have been calm and\nindifferent, whilst his enemy should have been nervous and disturbed.\n\nSir Percy's attitude had disconcerted him, a touch of the grotesque had\nbeen given to what should have been a tense moment, and it was terribly\ngalling to the pride of the ex-diplomatist that with this elusive\nenemy and in spite of his own preparedness for any eventuality, it was\ninvariably the unforeseen that happened.\n\nAfter a moment's reflection, however, he decided upon a fresh course of\naction. He rose and crossed the room, keeping as much as possible an eye\nupon Sir Percy, but the latter sat placid and dormant and evidently\nin no hurry to move. Chauvelin having reached the door, opened it\nnoiselessly, and to the sergeant in command of his bodyguard who stood\nat attention outside, he whispered hurriedly:\n\n\"The prisoner from No. 6.... Let two of the men bring her hither back to\nme at once.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI: The Terms of the Bargain\n\n\n\nLess than three minutes later, there came to Chauvelin's expectant ears\nthe soft sound made by a woman's skirts against the stone floor. During\nthose three minutes, which had seemed an eternity to his impatience, he\nhad sat silently watching the slumber--affected or real--of his enemy.\n\nDirectly he heard the word: \"Halt!\" outside the door, he jumped to his\nfeet. The next moment Marguerite had entered the room.\n\nHardly had her foot crossed the threshold than Sir Percy rose, quietly\nand without haste but evidently fully awake, and turning towards her,\nmade her a low obeisance.\n\nShe, poor woman, had of course caught sight of him at once. His presence\nhere, Chauvelin's demand for her reappearance, the soldiers in a small\ncompact group outside the door, all these were unmistakable proofs that\nthe awful cataclysm had at last occurred.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel, Percy Blakeney, her husband, was in the hands of\nthe Terrorists of France, and though face to face with her now, with\nan open window close to him, and an apparently helpless enemy under\nhis hand, he could not--owing to the fiendish measures taken by\nChauvelin--raise a finger to save himself and her.\n\nMercifully for her, nature--in the face of this appalling\ntragedy--deprived her of the full measure of her senses. She could move\nand speak and see, she could hear and in a measure understand what was\nsaid, but she was really an automaton or a sleep-walker, moving and\nspeaking mechanically and without due comprehension.\n\nPossibly, if she had then and there fully realized all that the future\nmeant, she would have gone mad with the horror of it all.\n\n\"Lady Blakeney,\" began Chauvelin after he had quickly dismissed the\nsoldiers from the room, \"when you and I parted from one another just\nnow, I had no idea that I should so soon have the pleasure of a personal\nconversation with Sir Percy.... There is no occasion yet, believe me,\nfor sorrow or fear.... Another twenty-four hours at most, and you will\nbe on board the 'Day-Dream' outward bound for England. Sir Percy himself\nmight perhaps accompany you; he does not desire that you should journey\nto Paris, and I may safely say, that in his mind, he has already\naccepted certain little conditions which I have been forced to impose\nupon him ere I sign the order for your absolute release.\"\n\n\"Conditions?\" she repeated vaguely and stupidly, looking in bewilderment\nfrom one to the other.\n\n\"You are tired, m'dear,\" said Sir Percy quietly, \"will you not sit\ndown?\"\n\nHe held the chair gallantly for her. She tried to read his face,\nbut could not catch even a flash from beneath the heavy lids which\nobstinately veiled his eyes.\n\n\"Oh! it is a mere matter of exchanging signatures,\" continued Chauvelin\nin response to her inquiring glance and toying with the papers which\nwere scattered on the table. \"Here you see is the order to allow Sir\nPercy Blakeney and his wife, nee Marguerite St. Just, to quit the town\nof Boulogne unmolested.\"\n\nHe held a paper out towards Marguerite, inviting her to look at it. She\ncaught sight of an official-looking document, bearing the motto and\nseal of the Republic of France, and of her own name and Percy's written\nthereon in full.\n\n\"It is perfectly en regle, I assure you,\" continued Chauvelin, \"and only\nawaits my signature.\"\n\nHe now took up another paper which looked like a long closely-written\nletter. Marguerite watched his every movement, for instinct told her\nthat the supreme moment had come. There was a look of almost superhuman\ncruelty and malice in the little Frenchman's eyes as he fixed them on\nthe impassive figure of Sir Percy, the while with slightly trembling\nhands he fingered that piece of paper and smoothed out its creases with\nloving care.\n\n\"I am quite prepared to sign the order for your release, Lady Blakeney,\"\nhe said, keeping his gaze still keenly fixed upon Sir Percy. \"When it\nis signed you will understand that our measures against the citizens of\nBoulogne will no longer hold good, and that on the contrary, the general\namnesty and free pardon will come into force.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand that,\" she replied.\n\n\"And all that will come to pass, Lady Blakeney, the moment Sir Percy\nwill write me in his own hand a letter, in accordance with the draft\nwhich I have prepared, and sign it with his name.\n\n\"Shall I read it to you?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"You will see how simple it all is.... A mere matter of form.... I pray\nyou do not look upon it with terror, but only as the prelude to that\ngeneral amnesty and free pardon, which I feel sure will satisfy the\nphilanthropic heart of the noble Scarlet Pimpernel, since three score at\nleast of the inhabitants of Boulogne will owe their life and freedom to\nhim.\"\n\n\"I am listening, Monsieur,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"As I have already had the honour of explaining, this little document\nis in the form of a letter addressed personally to me and of course in\nFrench,\" he said finally, and then he looked down on the paper and began\nto read:\n\nCitizen Chauvelin--\n\nIn consideration of a further sum of one million francs and on the\nunderstanding that this ridiculous charge brought against me of\nconspiring against the Republic of France is immediately withdrawn, and\nI am allowed to return to England unmolested, I am quite prepared to\nacquaint you with the names and whereabouts of certain persons who under\nthe guise of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel are even now conspiring\nto free the woman Marie Antoinette and her son from prison and to place\nthe latter upon the throne of France. You are quite well aware that\nunder the pretence of being the leader of a gang of English adventurers,\nwho never did the Republic of France and her people any real harm, I\nhave actually been the means of unmasking many a royalist plot before\nyou, and of bringing many persistent conspirators to the guillotine. I\nam surprised that you should cavil at the price I am asking this time\nfor the very important information with which I am able to furnish you,\nwhilst you have often paid me similar sums for work which was a\ngreat deal less difficult to do. In order to serve your government\neffectually, both in England and in France, I must have a sufficiency of\nmoney, to enable me to live in a costly style befitting a gentleman of\nmy rank. Were I to alter my mode of life I could not continue to mix in\nthat same social milieu to which all my friends belong and wherein, as\nyou are well aware, most of the royalist plots are hatched.\n\nTrusting therefore to receive a favourable reply to my just demands\nwithin the next twenty-four hours, whereupon the names in question shall\nbe furnished you forthwith,\n\nI have the honour to remain, Citizen,\n\nYour humble and obedient servant,\n\nWhen he had finished reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up\nagain, and then only did he look at the man and the woman before him.\n\nMarguerite sat very erect, her head thrown back, her face very pale\nand her hands tightly clutched in her lap. She had not stirred whilst\nChauvelin read out the infamous document, with which he desired to brand\na brave man with the ineradicable stigma of dishonour and of shame.\nAfter she heard the first words, she looked up swiftly and questioningly\nat her husband, but he stood at some little distance from her, right\nout of the flickering circle of yellowish light made by the burning\ntallow-candle. He was as rigid as a statue, standing in his usual\nattitude with legs apart and hands buried in his breeches pockets.\n\nShe could not see his face.\n\nWhatever she may have felt with regard to the letter, as the meaning of\nit gradually penetrated into her brain, she was, of course, convinced\nof one thing, and that was that never for a moment would Percy dream\nof purchasing his life or even hers at such a price. But she would have\nliked some sign from him, some look by which she could be guided as to\nher immediate conduct: as, however, he gave neither look nor sign, she\npreferred to assume an attitude of silent contempt.\n\nBut even before Chauvelin had had time to look from one face to the\nother, a prolonged and merry laugh echoed across the squalid room.\n\nSir Percy, with head thrown back, was laughing whole-heartedly.\n\n\"A magnificent epistle, sir,\" he said gaily, \"Lud love you, where\ndid you wield the pen so gracefully?... I vow that if I signed this\ninteresting document no one will believe I could have expressed myself\nwith perfect ease.. and in French too...\"\n\n\"Nay, Sir Percy,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily, \"I have thought of all that,\nand lest in the future there should be any doubt as to whether your own\nhand had or had not penned the whole of this letter, I also make it a\ncondition that you write out every word of it yourself, and sign it here\nin this very room, in the presence of Lady Blakeney, of myself, of\nmy colleagues and of at least half a dozen other persons whom I will\nselect.\"\n\n\"It is indeed admirably thought out, Monsieur,\" rejoined Sir Percy,\n\"and what is to become of the charming epistle, may I ask, after I\nhave written and signed it?... Pardon my curiosity.... I take a natural\ninterest in the matter... and truly your ingenuity passes belief...\"\n\n\"Oh! the fate of this letter will be as simple as was the writing\nthereof.... A copy of it will be published in our 'Gazette de Paris'\nas a bait for enterprising English journalists.... They will not be\nbackward in getting hold of so much interesting matter.... Can you not\nsee the attractive headlines in 'The London Gazette,' Sir Percy? 'The\nLeague of the Scarlet Pimpernel unmasked! A gigantic hoax! The origin\nof the Blakeney millions!'... I believe that journalism in England has\nreached a high standard of excellence... and even the 'Gazette de Paris'\nis greatly read in certain towns of your charming country.... His Royal\nHighness the Prince of Wales, and various other influential gentlemen\nin London, will, on the other hand, be granted a private view of the\noriginal through the kind offices of certain devoted friends whom we\npossess in England.... I don't think that you need have any fear, Sir\nPercy, that your caligraphy will sink into oblivion. It will be our\nbusiness to see that it obtains the full measure of publicity which it\ndeserves...\"\n\nHe paused a moment, then his manner suddenly changed: the sarcastic tone\ndied out of his voice, and there came back into his face that look of\nhatred and cruelty which Blakeney's persiflage had always the power to\nevoke.\n\n\"You may rest assured of one thing, Sir Percy,\" he said with a harsh\nlaugh, \"that enough mud will be thrown at that erstwhile glorious\nScarlet Pimpernel... some of it will be bound to stick...\"\n\n\"Nay, Monsieur... er... Chaubertin,\" quoth Blakeney lightly, \"I have no\ndoubt that you and your colleagues are past masters in the graceful art\nof mud-throwing.... But pardon me... er.... I was interrupting you....\nContinue, Monsieur... continue, I pray. 'Pon my honour, the matter is\nvastly diverting.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, after the publication of this diverting epistle, meseems your\nhonour will ceased to be a marketable commodity.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, sir,\" rejoined Sir Percy, apparently quite unruffled,\n\"pardon a slip of the tongue... we are so much the creatures of\nhabit.... As you were saying...?\"\n\n\"I have but little more to say, sir.... But lest there should even now\nbe lurking in your mind a vague hope that, having written this letter,\nyou could easily in the future deny its authorship, let me tell you\nthis: my measures are well taken, there will be witnesses to your\nwriting of it.... You will sit here in this room, unfettered, uncoerced\nin any way, and the money spoken of in the letter will be handed over to\nyou by my colleague, after a few suitable words spoken by him, and you\nwill take the money from him, Sir Percy... and the witnesses will\nsee you take it after having seen you write the letter... they will\nunderstand that you are being PAID by the French government for giving\ninformation anent royalist plots in this country and in England... they\nwill understand that your identity as the leader of that so-called band\nis not only known to me and to my colleague, but that it also covers\nyour real character and profession as the paid spy of France.\"\n\n\"Marvellous, I call it... demmed marvellous,\" quoth Sir Percy blandly.\n\nChauvelin had paused, half-choked by his own emotion, his hatred and\nprospective revenge. He passed his handkerchief over his forehead, which\nwas streaming with perspiration.\n\n\"Warm work, this sort of thing... eh... Monsieur... er...\nChaubertin?...\" queried his imperturbable enemy.\n\nMarguerite said nothing; the whole thing was too horrible for words,\nbut she kept her large eyes fixed upon her husband's face... waiting\nfor that look, that sign from him which would have eased the agonizing\nanxiety in her heart, and which never came.\n\nWith a great effort now, Chauvelin pulled himself together and, though\nhis voice still trembled, he managed to speak with a certain amount of\ncalm:\n\n\"Probably, Sir Percy, you know,\" he said, \"that throughout the whole of\nFrance we are inaugurating a series of national fetes, in honour of the\nnew religion which the people are about to adopt.... Demoiselle Desiree\nCandeille, whom you know, will at these festivals impersonate the\nGoddess of Reason, the only deity whom we admit now in France.... She\nhas been specially chosen for this honour, owing to the services which\nshe has rendered us recently... and as Boulogne happens to be the lucky\ncity in which we have succeeded in bringing the Scarlet Pimpernel to\njustice, the national fete will begin within these city walls, with\nDemoiselle Candeille as the thrice-honoured goddess.\"\n\n\"And you will be very merry here in Boulogne, I dare swear...\"\n\n\"Aye, merry, sir,\" said Chauvelin with an involuntary and savage snarl,\nas he placed a long claw-like finger upon the momentous paper before\nhim, \"merry, for we here in Boulogne will see that which will fill the\nheart of every patriot in France with gladness.... Nay! 'twas not the\ndeath of the Scarlet Pimpernel we wanted... not the noble martyrdom of\nEngland's chosen hero... but his humiliation and defeat... derision\nand scorn... contumely and contempt. You asked me airily just now, Sir\nPercy, how I proposed to accomplish this object... Well! you know it\nnow--by forcing you... aye, forcing--to write and sign a letter and\nto take money from my hands which will brand you forever as a liar and\ninformer, and cover you with the thick and slimy mud of irreclaimable\ninfamy...\"\n\n\"Lud! sir,\" said Sir Percy pleasantly, \"what a wonderful command you\nhave of our language.... I wish I could speak French half as well...\"\n\nMarguerite had risen like an automaton from her chair. She felt that she\ncould no longer sit still, she wanted to scream out at the top of her\nvoice, all the horror she felt for this dastardly plot, which surely\nmust have had its origin in the brain of devils. She could not\nunderstand Percy. This was one of those awful moments, which she\nhad been destined to experience once or twice before, when the whole\npersonality of her husband seemed to become shadowy before her, to slip,\nas it were, past her comprehension, leaving her indescribably lonely and\nwretched, trusting yet terrified.\n\nShe thought that long ere this he would have flung back every insult in\nhis opponent's teeth; she did not know what inducements Chauvelin had\nheld out in exchange for the infamous letter, what threats he had used.\nThat her own life and freedom were at stake, was, of course, evident,\nbut she cared nothing for life, and he should know that certainly she\nwould care still less if such a price had to be paid for it.\n\nShe longed to tell him all that was in her heart, longed to tell him how\nlittle she valued her life, how highly she prized his honour! but how\ncould she, before this fiend who snarled and sneered in his anticipated\ntriumph, and surely, surely Percy knew!\n\nAnd knowing all that, why did he not speak? Why did he not tear that\ninfamous paper from out that devil's hands and fling it in his face?\nYet, though her loving ear caught every intonation of her husband's\nvoice, she could not detect the slightest harshness in his airy laugh;\nhis tone was perfectly natural and he seemed to be, indeed, just as he\nappeared--vastly amused.\n\nThen she thought that perhaps he would wish her to go now, that he felt\ndesire to be alone with this man, who had outraged him in everything\nthat he held most holy and most dear, his honour and his wife... that\nperhaps, knowing that his own temper was no longer under control, he did\nnot wish her to witness the rough and ready chastisement which he was\nintending to mete out to this dastardly intriguer.\n\nYes! that was it no doubt! Herein she could not be mistaken; she knew\nhis fastidious notions of what was due and proper in the presence of a\nwoman, and that even at a moment like this, he would wish the manners of\nLondon drawing-rooms to govern his every action.\n\nTherefore she rose to go, and as she did so, once more tried to read the\nexpression in his face... to guess what was passing in his mind.\n\n\"Nay, Madam,\" he said, whilst he bowed gracefully before her, \"I fear me\nthis lengthy conversation hath somewhat fatigued you.... This merry jest\n'twixt my engaging friend and myself should not have been prolonged so\nfar into the night.... Monsieur, I pray you, will you not give orders\nthat her ladyship be escorted back to her room?\"\n\nHe was still standing outside the circle of light, and Marguerite\ninstinctively went up to him. For this one second she was oblivious\nof Chauvelin's presence, she forgot her well-schooled pride, her\nfirm determination to be silent and to be brave: she could no longer\nrestrain the wild beatings of her heart, the agony of her soul, and\nwith sudden impulse she murmured in a voice broken with intense love and\nsubdued, passionate appeal:\n\n\"Percy!\"\n\nHe drew back a step further into the gloom: this made her realize the\nmistake she had made in allowing her husband's most bitter enemy to\nget this brief glimpse into her soul. Chauvelin's thin lips curled with\nsatisfaction, the brief glimpse had been sufficient for him, the rapidly\nwhispered name, the broken accent had told him what he had not known\nhitherto: namely, that between this man and woman there was a bond far\nmore powerful that that which usually existed between husband and wife,\nand merely made up of chivalry on the one side and trustful reliance on\nthe other.\n\nMarguerite having realized her mistake, ashamed of having betrayed\nher feelings even for a moment, threw back her proud head and gave her\nexultant foe a look of defiance and of scorn. He responded with one of\npity, not altogether unmixed with deference. There was something almost\nunearthly and sublime in this beautiful woman's agonizing despair.\n\nHe lowered his head and made her a deep obeisance, lest she should see\nthe satisfaction and triumph which shone through his pity.\n\nAs usual Sir Percy remained quite imperturbable, and now it was he, who,\nwith characteristic impudence, touched the hand-bell on the table:\n\n\"Excuse this intrusion, Monsieur,\" he said lightly, \"her ladyship is\noverfatigued and would be best in her room.\"\n\nMarguerite threw him a grateful look. After all she was only a woman\nand was afraid of breaking down. In her mind there was no issue to the\npresent deadlock save in death. For this she was prepared and had but\none great hope that she could lie in her husband's arms just once again\nbefore she died. Now, since she could not speak to him, scarcely dared\nto look into the loved face, she was quite ready to go.\n\nIn answer to the bell, the soldier had entered.\n\n\"If Lady Blakeney desires to go...\" said Chauvelin.\n\nShe nodded and Chauvelin gave the necessary orders: two soldiers stood\nat attention ready to escort Marguerite back to her prison cell. As she\nwent towards the door she came to within a couple of steps from where\nher husband was standing, bowing to her as she passed. She stretched\nout an icy cold hand towards him, and he, in the most approved London\nfashion, with the courtly grace of a perfect English gentleman, took\nthe little hand in his and stooping very low kissed the delicate\nfinger-tips.\n\nThen only did she notice that the strong, nervy hand which held hers\ntrembled perceptibly, and that his lips--which for an instant rested on\nher fingers--were burning hot.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII: The Decision\n\n\n\nOnce more the two men were alone.\n\nAs far as Chauvelin was concerned he felt that everything was not yet\nsettled, and until a moment ago he had been in doubt as to whether Sir\nPercy would accept the infamous conditions which had been put before\nhim, or allow his pride and temper to get the better of him and throw\nthe deadly insults back into his adversary's teeth.\n\nBut now a new secret had been revealed to the astute diplomatist. A\nname, softly murmured by a broken-hearted woman, had told him a tale of\nlove and passion, which he had not even suspected before.\n\nSince he had made this discovery he knew that the ultimate issue was no\nlonger in doubt. Sir Percy Blakeney, the bold adventurer, ever ready\nfor a gamble where lives were at stake, might have demurred before\nhe subscribed to his own dishonour, in order to save his wife from\nhumiliation and the shame of the terrible fate that had been mapped\nout for her. But the same man passionately in love with such a woman as\nMarguerite Blakeney would count the world well lost for her sake.\n\nOne sudden fear alone had shot through Chauvelin's heart when he stood\nface to face with the two people whom he had so deeply and cruelly\nwronged, and that was that Blakeney, throwing aside all thought of the\nscores of innocent lives that were at stake, might forget everything,\nrisk everything, dare everything, in order to get his wife away there\nand then.\n\nFor the space of a few seconds Chauvelin had felt that his own life\nwas in jeopardy, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel would indeed make\na desperate effort to save himself and his wife. But the fear was\nshort-lived: Marguerite--as he had well foreseen--would never save\nherself at the expense of others, and she was tied! tied! tied! That was\nhis triumph and his joy!\n\nWhen Marguerite finally left the room, Sir Percy made no motion to\nfollow her, but turned once more quietly to his antagonist.\n\n\"As you were saying, Monsieur?...\" he queried lightly.\n\n\"Oh! there is nothing more to say, Sir Percy,\" rejoined Chauvelin; \"my\nconditions are clear to you, are they not? Lady Blakeney's and your own\nimmediate release in exchange for a letter written to me by your own\nhand, and signed here by you--in this room--in my presence and that of\nsundry other persons whom I need not name just now. Also certain money\npassing from my hand to yours. Failing the letter, a long, hideously\nhumiliating sojourn in the Temple prison for your wife, a prolonged\ntrial and the guillotine as a happy release!... I would add, the same\nthing for yourself, only that I will do you the justice to admit that\nyou probably do not care.\"\n\n\"Nay! a grave mistake, Monsieur.... I do care... vastly care, I assure\nyou ... and would seriously object to ending my life on your demmed\nguillotine... a nasty, uncomfortable thing, I should say... and I am\ntold that an inexperienced barber is deputed to cut one's hair....\nBrrr!... Now, on the other hand, I like the idea of a national fete...\nthat pretty wench Candeille, dressed as a goddess... the boom of the\ncannon when your amnesty comes into force.... You WILL boom the cannon,\nwill you not, Monsieur?... Cannon are demmed noisy, but they are\neffective sometimes, do you not think so, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Very effective certainly, Sir Percy,\" sneered Chauvelin, \"and we will\ncertainly boom the cannon from this very fort, an it so please you....\"\n\n\"At what hour, Monsieur, is my letter to be ready?\"\n\n\"Why! at any hour you please, Sir Percy.\"\n\n\"The 'Day-Dream' could weigh anchor at eight o'clock... would an hour\nbefore that be convenient to yourself?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Sir Percy... if you will honour me by accepting my\nhospitality in these uncomfortable quarters until seven o'clock\nto-morrow eve?...\"\n\n\"I thank you, Monsieur...\"\n\n\"Then am I to understand, Sir Percy, that...\"\n\nA loud and ringing laugh broke from Blakeney's lips.\n\n\"That I accept your bargain, man!... Zounds! I tell you I accept... I'll\nwrite the letter, I'll sign it... an you have our free passes ready for\nus in exchange.... At seven o'clock to-morrow eve, did you say?... Man!\ndo not look so astonished.... The letter, the signature, the money...\nall your witnesses... have everything ready.... I accept, I say....\nAnd now, in the name of all the evil spirits in hell, let me have some\nsupper and a bed, for I vow that I am demmed fatigued.\"\n\nAnd without more ado Sir Percy once more rang the handbell, laughing\nboisterously the while: then suddenly, with quick transition of mood,\nhis laugh was lost in a gigantic yawn, and throwing his long body onto\na chair, he stretched out his legs, buried his hands in his pockets, and\nthe next moment was peacefully asleep.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII: The Midnight Watch\n\n\n\nBoulogne had gone through many phases, in its own languid and sleepy\nway, whilst the great upheaval of a gigantic revolution shook other\ncities of France to their very foundations.\n\nAt first the little town had held somnolently aloof, and whilst Lyons\nand Tours conspired and rebelled, whilst Marseilles and Toulon opened\ntheir ports to the English and Dunkirk was ready to surrender to\nthe allied forces, she had gazed through half-closed eyes at all the\nturmoil, and then quietly turned over and gone to sleep again.\n\nBoulogne fished and mended nets, built boats and manufactured boots\nwith placid content, whilst France murdered her king and butchered her\ncitizens.\n\nThe initial noise of the great revolution was only wafted on the\nsoutherly breezes from Paris to the little seaport towns of Northern\nFrance, and lost much of its volume and power in this aerial transit:\nthe fisher folk were too poor to worry about the dethronement of kings:\nthe struggle for daily existence, the perils and hardships of deep-sea\nfishing engrossed all the faculties they possessed.\n\nAs for the burghers and merchants of the town, they were at first\ncontent with reading an occasional article in the \"Gazette de Paris\" or\nthe \"Gazette des Tribunaux,\" brought hither by one or other of the many\ntravellers who crossed the city on their way to the harbour. They were\ninterested in these articles, at times even comfortably horrified at the\ndoings in Paris, the executions and the tumbrils, but on the whole they\nliked the idea that the country was in future to be governed by duly\nchosen representatives of the people, rather than be a prey to the\ndespotism of kings, and they were really quite pleased to see the\ntricolour flag hoisted on the old Beffroi, there where the snow-white\nstandard of the Bourbons had erstwhile flaunted its golden fleur-de-lis\nin the glare of the midday sun.\n\nThe worthy burgesses of Boulogne were ready to shout: \"Vive la\nRepublique!\" with the same cheerful and raucous Normandy accent as they\nhad lately shouted \"Dieu protege le Roi!\"\n\nThe first awakening from this happy torpor came when that tent was put\nup on the landing stage in the harbour. Officials, dressed in shabby\nuniforms and wearing tricolour cockades and scarves, were now quartered\nin Town Hall, and repaired daily to that roughly erected tent,\naccompanied by so many soldiers from the garrison.\n\nThere installed, they busied themselves with examining carefully\nthe passports of all those who desired to leave or enter Boulogne.\nFisher-folk who had dwelt in the city--father and son and grandfather\nand many generations before that--and had come and gone in and out of\ntheir own boats as they pleased, were now stopped as they beached their\ncraft and made to give an account of themselves to these officials from\nParis.\n\nIt was, of a truth, more than ridiculous, that these strangers should\nask of Jean-Marie who he was, or of Pierre what was his business, or\nof Desire Francois whither he was going, when Jean-Marie and Pierre\nand Desire Francois had plied their nets in the roads outside Boulogne\nharbour for more years than they would care to count.\n\nIt also caused no small measure of annoyance that fishermen were\nordered to wear tricolour cockades on their caps. They had no special\nill-feeling against tricolour cockades, but they did not care about\nthem. Jean-Marie flatly refused to have one pinned on, and being\nadmonished somewhat severely by one of the Paris officials, he became\nobstinate about the whole thing and threw the cockade violently on the\nground and spat upon it, not from any sentiment of anti-republicanism,\nbut just from a feeling of Norman doggedness.\n\nHe was arrested, shut up in Fort Gayole, tried as a traitor and publicly\nguillotined.\n\nThe consternation in Boulogne was appalling.\n\nThe one little spark had found its way to a barrel of blasting\npowder and caused a terrible explosion. Within twenty-four hours\nof Jean-Marie's execution the whole town was in the throes of\nthe Revolution. What the death of King Louis, the arrest of Marie\nAntoinette, the massacres of September had failed to do, that the arrest\nand execution of an elderly fisherman accomplished in a trice.\n\nPeople began to take sides in politics. Some families realized that they\ncame from ancient lineage, and that their ancestors had helped to build\nup the throne of the Bourbons. Others looked up ancient archives and\nremembered past oppressions at the hands of the aristocrats.\n\nThus some burghers of Boulogne became ardent reactionaries, whilst\nothers secretly nursed enthusiastic royalist convictions: some were\nready to throw in their lot with the anarchists, to deny the religion\nof their fathers, to scorn the priests and close the places of worship;\nothers adhered strictly still to the usages and practices of the Church.\n\nArrest became frequent: the guillotine, erected in the Place de la\nSenechaussee, had plenty of work to do. Soon the cathedral was closed,\nthe priests thrown into prison, whilst scores of families hoped to\nescape a similar fate by summary flight.\n\nVague rumours of a band of English adventurers soon reached the little\nsea-port town. The Scarlet Pimpernel--English spy or hero, as he was\nalternately called--had helped many a family with pronounced royalist\ntendencies to escape the fury of the blood-thirsty Terrorists.\n\nThus gradually the anti-revolutionaries had been weeded out of the city:\nsome by death and imprisonment, others by flight. Boulogne became the\nhotbed of anarchism: the idlers and loafers, inseparable from any town\nwhere there is a garrison and a harbour, practically ruled the city now.\nDenunciations were the order of the day. Everyone who owned any money,\nor lived with any comfort was accused of being a traitor and suspected\nof conspiracy. The fisher folk wandered about the city, surly and\ndiscontented: their trade was at a standstill, but there was a trifle\nto be earned by giving information: information which meant the arrest,\nofttimes the death of men, women and even children who had tried to seek\nsafety in flight, and to denounce whom--as they were trying to hire a\nboat anywhere along the coast--meant a good square meal for a starving\nfamily.\n\nThen came the awful cataclysm.\n\nA woman--a stranger--had been arrested and imprisoned in the Fort Gayole\nand the town-crier publicly proclaimed that if she escaped from jail,\none member of every family in the town--rich or poor, republican or\nroyalist, Catholic or free-thinker--would be summarily guillotined.\n\nThat member, the bread-winner!\n\n\"Why, then, with the Duvals it would be young Francois-Auguste. He keeps\nhis old mother with his boot-making...\"\n\n\"And it would be Marie Lebon, she has her blind father dependent on her\nnet-mending.\"\n\n\"And old Mother Laferriere, whose grandchildren were left penniless...\nshe keeps them from starvation by her wash-tub.\"\n\n\"But Francois-Auguste is a real Republican; he belongs to the Jacobin\nClub.\"\n\n\"And look at Pierre, who never meets a calotin but he must needs spit on\nhim.\"\n\n\"Is there no safety anywhere?... are we to be butchered like so many\ncattle?...\"\n\nSomebody makes the suggestion:\n\n\"It is a threat... they would not dare!...\"\n\n\"Would not dare?...\"\n\n'Tis old Andre Lemoine who has spoken, and he spits vigorously on the\nground. Andre Lemoine has been a soldier; he was in La Vendee. He was\nwounded at Tours... and he knows!\n\n\"Would not dare?...\" he says in a whisper. \"I tell you, friends, that\nthere's nothing the present government would not dare. There was the\nPlaine Saint Mauve... Did you ever hear about that?... little children\nfusilladed by the score... little ones, I say, and women with babies at\ntheir breasts ... weren't they innocent?... Five hundred innocent people\nbutchered in La Vendee... until the Headsman sank--worn not... I could\ntell worse than that... for I know.... There's nothing they would not\ndare!...\"\n\nConsternation was so great that the matter could not even be discussed.\n\n\"We'll go to Gayole and see this woman at any rate.\"\n\nAngry, sullen crowds assembled in the streets. The proclamation had been\nread just as the men were leaving the public houses, preparing to go\nhome for the night.\n\nThey brought the news to the women, who, at home, were setting the soup\nand bread on the table for their husbands' supper. There was no thought\nof going to bed or of sleeping that night. The bread-winner in every\nfamily and all those dependent on him for daily sustenance were\ntrembling for their lives.\n\nResistance to the barbarous order would have been worse than useless,\nnor did the thought of it enter the heads of these humble and ignorant\nfisher folk, wearied out with the miserable struggle for existence.\nThere was not sufficient spirit left in this half-starved population\nof a small provincial city to suggest open rebellion. A regiment of\nsoldiers come up from the South were quartered in the Chateau, and the\nnatives of Boulogne could not have mustered more than a score of disused\nblunderbusses between them.\n\nThen they remembered tales which Andre Lemoine had told, the fate of\nLyons, razed to the ground, of Toulon burnt to ashes, and they did not\ndare rebel.\n\nBut brothers, fathers, sons trooped out towards Gayole, in order to\nhave a good look at the frowning pile, which held the hostage for their\nsafety. It looked dark and gloomy enough, save for one window which gave\non the southern ramparts. This window was wide open and a feeble light\nflickered from the room beyond, and as the men stood about, gazing at\nthe walls in sulky silence, they suddenly caught the sound of a loud\nlaugh proceeding from within, and of a pleasant voice speaking quite\ngaily in a language which they did not understand, but which sounded\nlike English.\n\nAgainst the heavy oaken gateway, leading to the courtyard of the prison,\nthe proclamation written on stout parchment had been pinned up. Beside\nit hung a tiny lantern, the dim light of which flickered in the evening\nbreeze, and brought at times into sudden relief the bold writing and\nheavy signature, which stood out, stern and grim, against the yellowish\nbackground of the paper, like black signs of approaching death.\n\nFacing the gateway and the proclamation, the crowd of men took its\nstand. The moon, from behind them, cast fitful, silvery glances at the\nweary heads bent in anxiety and watchful expectancy: on old heads and\nyoung heads, dark, curly heads and heads grizzled with age, on backs\nbent with toil, and hands rough and gnarled like seasoned timber.\n\nAll night the men stood and watched.\n\nSentinels from the town guard were stationed at the gates, but these\nmight prove inattentive or insufficient, they had not the same price\nat stake, so the entire able-bodied population of Boulogne watched the\ngloomy prison that night, lest anyone escaped by wall or window.\n\nThey were guarding the precious hostage whose safety was the stipulation\nfor their own.\n\nThere was dead silence among them, and dead silence all around, save for\nthat monotonous tok-tok-tok of the parchment flapping in the breeze. The\nmoon, who all along had been capricious and chary of her light, made\na final retreat behind a gathering bank of clouds, and the crowd, the\nsoldiers and the great grim walls were all equally wrapped in gloom.\n\nOnly the little lantern on the gateway now made a ruddy patch of light,\nand tinged that fluttering parchment with the colour of blood. Every now\nand then an isolated figure would detach itself from out the watching\nthrong, and go up to the heavy, oaken door, in order to gaze at the\nproclamation. Then the light of the lantern illumined a dark head or a\ngrey one, for a moment or two: black or white locks were stirred gently\nin the wind, and a sigh of puzzlement and disappointment would be\ndistinctly heard.\n\nAt times a group of three or four would stand there for awhile, not\nspeaking, only sighing and casting eager questioning glances at one\nanother, whilst trying vainly to find some hopeful word, some turn of\nphrase of meaning that would be less direful, in that grim and ferocious\nproclamation. Then a rough word from the sentinel, a push from the\nbutt-end of a bayonet would disperse the little group and send the men,\nsullen and silent, back into the crowd.\n\nThus they watched for hours whilst the bell of the Beffroi tolled all\nthe hours of that tedious night. A thin rain began to fall in the small\nhours of the morning, a wetting, soaking drizzle which chilled the weary\nwatchers to the bone.\n\nBut they did not care.\n\n\"We must not sleep, for the woman might escape.\"\n\nSome of them squatted down in the muddy road, the luckier ones managed\nto lean their backs against the slimy walls.\n\nTwice before the hour of midnight they heard that same quaint and merry\nlaugh proceeding from the lighted room, through the open window. Once it\nsounded very low and very prolonged, as if in response to a delightful\njoke.\n\nAnon the heavy gateway of Gayole was opened from within, and half a\ndozen soldiers came walking out of the courtyard. They were dressed in\nthe uniform of the town-guard, but had evidently been picked out of the\nrank and file, for all six were exceptionally tall and stalwart, and\ntowered above the sentinel, who saluted and presented arms as they\nmarched out of the gate.\n\nIn the midst of them walked a slight, dark figure, clad entirely in\nblack, save for the tricolour scarf round his waist.\n\nThe crowd of watchers gazed on the little party with suddenly awakened\ninterest.\n\n\"Who is it?\" whispered some of the men.\n\n\"The citizen-governor,\" suggested one.\n\n\"The new public executioner,\" ventured another.\n\n\"No! no!\" quoth Pierre Maxime, the doyen of Boulogne fishermen, and a\ngreat authority on every matter public or private with the town; \"no, no\nhe is the man who has come down from Paris, the friend of Robespierre.\nHe makes the laws now, the citizen-governor even must obey him. 'Tis he\nwho made the law that if the woman up yonder should escape...\"\n\n\"Hush!... sh!... sh!...\" came in frightened accents from the crowd.\n\n\"Hush, Pierre Maxine!... the Citizen might hear thee,\" whispered the man\nwho stood closest to the old fisherman; \"the Citizen might hear thee,\nand think that we rebelled....\"\n\n\"What are these people doing here?' queried Chauvelin as he passed out\ninto the street.\n\n\"They are watching the prison, Citizen,\" replied the sentinel, whom he\nhad thus addressed, \"lest the female prisoner should attempt to escape.\"\n\nWith a satisfied smile, Chauvelin turned toward the Town Hall, closely\nsurrounded by his escort. The crowd watched him and the soldiers as\nthey quickly disappeared in the gloom, then they resumed the stolid,\nwearisome vigil of the night.\n\nThe old Beffroi now tolled the midnight hour, the one solitary light in\nthe old Fort was extinguished, and after that the frowning pile remained\ndark and still.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX: The National Fete\n\n\n\n\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nThey had not slept, only some of them had fallen into drowsy somnolence,\nheavy and nerve-racking, worse indeed than any wakefulness.\n\nWithin the houses, the women too had kept the tedious vigil, listening\nfor every sound, dreading every bit of news, which the wind might waft\nin through the small, open windows.\n\nIf one prisoner escaped, every family in Boulogne would be deprived of\nthe bread-winner. Therefore the women wept, and tried to remember those\nPaters and Aves which the tyranny of liberty, fraternity and equality\nhad ordered them to forget.\n\nBroken rosaries were fetched out from neglected corners, and knees stiff\nwith endless, thankless toil were bent once more in prayer.\n\n\"Oh God! Good God! Do not allow that woman to flee!\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! Mother of God! Make that she should not escape!\"\n\nSome of the women went out in the early dawn to take hot soup and coffee\nto their men who were watching outside the prison.\n\n\"Has anything been seen?\"\n\n\"Have ye seen the woman?\"\n\n\"Which room is she in?\"\n\n\"Why won't they let us see her?\"\n\n\"Are you sure she hath not already escaped?\"\n\nQuestions and surmises went round in muffled whispers as the steaming\ncans were passed round. No one had a definite answer to give, although\nDesire Melun declared that he had, once during the night, caught sight\nof a woman's face at one of the windows above: but as he could not\ndescribe the woman's face, nor locate with any degree of precision the\nparticular window at which she was supposed to have appeared, it was\nunanimously decided that Desire must have been dreaming.\n\n\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nThe cry came first from the Town Hall, and therefore from behind the\ncrowd of men and women, whose faces had been so resolutely set for all\nthese past hours towards the Gayole prison.\n\nThey were all awake! but too tired and cramped to move as yet, and to\nturn in the direction whence arose that cry.\n\n\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nIt was just the voice of Auguste Moleux, the town-crier of Boulogne,\nwho, bell in hand, was trudging his way along the Rue Daumont, closely\nfollowed by two fellows of the municipal guard.\n\nAuguste was in the very midst of the sullen crowd, before the men even\ntroubled about his presence here, but now with many a vigorous \"Allons\ndonc!\" and \"Voyez-moi ca, fais donc place, voyons!\" he elbowed his way\nthrough the throng.\n\nHe was neither tired nor cramped; he served the Republic in comfort\nand ease, and had slept soundly on his paillasse in the little garret\nallotted to him in the Town Hall.\n\nThe crowd parted in silence, to allow him to pass. Auguste was lean and\npowerful, the scanty and meagre food, doled out to him by a paternal\ngovernment, had increased his muscular strength whilst reducing his fat.\nHe had very hard elbows, and soon he managed, by dint of pushing and\ncursing to reach the gateway of Gayole.\n\n\"Voyons! enlevez-moi ca,\" he commanded in stentorian tones, pointing to\nthe proclamation.\n\nThe fellows of the municipal guard fell to and tore the parchment away\nfrom the door whilst the crowd looked on with stupid amazement.\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nThen Auguste Moleux turned and faced the men.\n\n\"Mes enfants,\" he said, \"my little cabbages! wake up! the government of\nthe Republic has decreed that to-day is to be a day of gaiety and public\nrejoicings!\"\n\n\"Gaiety?... Public rejoicings forsooth, when the bread-winner of every\nfamily...\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush! Be silent, all of you,\" quoth Auguste impatiently, \"you do\nnot understand!... All that is at an end... There is no fear that the\nwoman shall escape.... You are all to dance and rejoice.... The Scarlet\nPimpernel has been captured in Boulogne, last night...\"\n\n\"Qui ca the Scarlet Pimpernel?\"\n\n\"Mais! 'tis that mysterious English adventurer who rescued people from\nthe guillotine!\"\n\n\"A hero? quoi?\"\n\n\"No! no! only an English spy, a friend of aristocrats... he would have\ncared nothing for the bread-winners of Boulogne...\"\n\n\"He would not have raised a finger to save them.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" sighed a feminine voice, \"perhaps he came to Boulogne to\nhelp them.\"\n\n\"And he has been caught anyway,\" concluded Auguste Moleux sententiously,\n\"and, my little cabbages, remember this, that so great is the pleasure\nof the all-powerful Committee of Public Safety at this capture, that\nbecause he has been caught in Boulogne, therefore Boulogne is to be\nspecially rewarded!\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin, who'd have thought it?\"\n\n\"Sh... Jeanette, dost not know that there's no Holy Virgin now?\"\n\n\"And dost know, Auguste, how we are to be rewarded?\"\n\nIt is a difficult matter for the human mind to turn very quickly from\ndespair to hope, and the fishermen of Boulogne had not yet grasped the\nfact that they were to make merry and that thoughts of anxiety must be\nabandoned for those of gaiety.\n\nAuguste Moleux took out a parchment from the capacious pocket of his\ncoat; he put on his most solemn air of officialdom, and pointing with\nextended forefinger to the parchment, he said:\n\n\"A general amnesty to all natives of Boulogne who are under arrest at\nthe present moment: a free pardon to all natives of Boulogne who are\nunder sentence of death: permission to all natives of Boulogne to quit\nthe town with their families, to embark on any vessel they please, in\nor out of the harbour, and to go whithersoever they choose, without\npassports, formalities or questions of any kind.\"\n\nDead silence followed this announcement. Hope was just beginning to\ncrowd anxiety and sullenness out of the way.\n\n\"Then poor Andre Legrand will be pardoned,\" whispered a voice suddenly;\n\"he was to have been guillotined to-day.\"\n\n\"And Denise Latour! she was innocent enough, the gentle pigeon.\"\n\n\"And they'll let poor Abbe Foucquet out of prison too.\"\n\n\"And Francois!\"\n\n\"And poor Felicite, who is blind!\"\n\n\"M. l'Abbe would be wise to leave Boulogne with the children.\"\n\n\"He will too: thou canst be sure of that!\"\n\n\"It is not good to be a priest just now!\"\n\n\"Bah! calotins are best dead than alive.\"\n\nBut some in the crowd were silent, others whispered eagerly.\n\n\"Thinkest thou it would be safer for us to get out of the country whilst\nwe can?\" said one of the men in a muffled tone, and clutching nervously\nat a woman's wrist.\n\n\"Aye! aye! it might leak out about that boat we procured for...\"\n\n\"Sh!... I was thinking of that...\"\n\n\"We can go to my aunt Lebrun in Belgium...\"\n\nOthers talked in whispers of England or the New Land across the seas:\nthey were those who had something to hide, money received from refugee\naristocrats, boats sold to would-be emigres, information withheld,\ndenunciations shirked: the amnesty would not last long, 'twas best to be\nsafely out of the way.\n\n\"In the meanwhile, my cabbages,\" quoth Auguste sententiously, \"are you\nnot grateful to Citizen Robespierre, who has sent this order specially\ndown from Paris?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" assented the crowd cheerfully.\n\n\"Hurrah for Citizen Robespierre!\"\n\n\"Viva la Republique!\"\n\n\"And you will enjoy yourselves to-day?\"\n\n\"That we will!\"\n\n\"Processions?\"\n\n\"Aye! with music and dancing.\"\n\nOut there, far away, beyond the harbour, the grey light of dawn was\nyielding to the crimson glow of morning. The rain had ceased and heavy\nslaty clouds parted here and there, displaying glints of delicate\nturquoise sky, and tiny ethereal vapours in the dim and remote distance\nof infinity, flecked with touches of rose and gold.\n\nThe towers and pinnacles of old Boulogne detached themselves one by one\nfrom the misty gloom of night. The old bell of the Beffroi tolled the\nhour of six. Soon the massive cupola of Notre Dame was clothed in purple\nhues, and the gilt cross on St. Joseph threw back across the square a\nblinding ray of gold.\n\nThe town sparrows began to twitter, and from far out at sea in the\ndirection of Dunkirk there came the muffled boom of cannon.\n\n\"And remember, my pigeons,\" admonished Auguste Moleux solemnly, \"that in\nthis order which Robespierre has sent from Paris, it also says that from\nto-day onwards le bon Dieu has ceased to be!\"\n\nMany faces were turned towards the East just then, for the rising\nsun, tearing with one gigantic sweep the banks of cloud asunder, now\ndisplayed his magnificence in a gorgeous immensity of flaming crimson.\nThe sea, in response, turned to liquid fire beneath the glow, whilst the\nwhole sky was irradiated with the first blush of morning.\n\nLe bon Dieu has ceased to be!\n\n\"There is only one religion in France now,\" explained Auguste Moleux,\n\"the religion of Reason! We are all citizens! We are all free and all\nable to think for ourselves. Citizen Robespierre has decreed that there\nis no good God. Le bon Dieu was a tyrant and an aristocrat, and, like\nall tyrants and aristocrats, He has been deposed. There is no good God,\nthere is no Holy Virgin and no Saints, only Reason, who is a goddess and\nwhom we all honour.\"\n\nAnd the townsfolk of Boulogne, with eyes still fixed on the gorgeous\nEast, shouted with sullen obedience:\n\n\"Hurrah! for the Goddess of Reason!\"\n\n\"Hurrah for Robespierre!\"\n\nOnly the women, trying to escape the town-crier's prying eyes, or the\nsoldiers' stern gaze, hastily crossed themselves behind their husbands'\nbacks, terrified lest le bon Dieu had, after all, not altogether ceased\nto exist at the bidding of Citizen Robespierre.\n\nThus the worthy natives of Boulogne, forgetting their anxieties and\nfears, were ready enough to enjoy the national fete ordained for them by\nthe Committee of Public Safety, in honour of the capture of the Scarlet\nPimpernel. They were even willing to accept this new religion which\nRobespierre had invented: a religion which was only a mockery, with an\nactress to represent its supreme deity.\n\nMais, que voulez-vous? Boulogne had long ago ceased to have faith in\nGod: the terrors of the Revolution, which culminated in that agonizing\nwatch of last night, had smothered all thoughts of worship and of\nprayer.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel must indeed be a dangerous spy that his arrest\nshould cause so much joy in Paris!\n\nEven Boulogne had learned by experience that the Committee of Public\nSafety did not readily give up a prey, once its vulture-like claws had\nclosed upon it. The proportion of condemnations as against acquittals\nwas as a hundred to one.\n\nBut because this one man was taken, scores to-day were to be set free!\n\nIn the evening at a given hour--seven o'clock had Auguste Moleux, the\ntown-crier, understood--the boom of the cannon would be heard, the gates\nof the town would be opened, the harbour would become a free port.\n\nThe inhabitants of Boulogne were ready to shout:\n\n\"Vive the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nWhatever he was--hero or spy--he was undoubtedly the primary cause of\nall their joy.\n\nBy the time Auguste Moleux had cried out the news throughout the town,\nand pinned the new proclamation of mercy up on every public building,\nall traces of fatigue and anxiety had vanished. In spite of the fact\nthat wearisome vigils had been kept in every home that night, and that\nhundreds of men and women had stood about for hours in the vicinity of\nthe Gayole Fort, no sooner was the joyful news known, than all lassitude\nwas forgotten and everyone set to with a right merry will to make the\ngreat fete-day a complete success.\n\nThere is in every native of Normandy, be he peasant or gentleman, an\ninfinite capacity for enjoyment, and at the same time a marvellous\nfaculty for co-ordinating and systematizing his pleasures.\n\nIn a trice the surly crowds had vanished. Instead of these, there were\ngroups of gaily-visaged men pleasantly chattering outside every eating\nand drinking place in the town. The national holiday had come upon\nthese people quite unawares, so the early part of it had to be spent\nin thinking out a satisfactory programme for it. Sipping their beer\nor coffee, or munching their cherries a l'eau-de-vie, the townsfolk\nof Boulogne, so lately threatened with death, were quietly organizing\nprocessions.\n\nThere was to be a grand muster on the Place de la Senechaussee, then\na torchlight and lanthorn-light march, right round the Ramparts,\nculminating in a gigantic assembly outside the Town Hall, where the\nCitizen Chauvelin, representing the Committee of Public Safety, would\nreceive an address of welcome from the entire population of Boulogne.\n\nThe procession was to be in costume! There were to be Pierrots and\nPierettes, Harlequins and English clowns, aristocrats and goddesses! All\nday the women and girls were busy contriving travesties of all sorts,\nand the little tumbledown shops in the Rue de Chateau and the Rue\nFrederic Sauvage--kept chiefly by Jews and English traders--were\nransacked for old bits of finery, and for remnants of costumes, worn\nin the days when Boulogne was still a gay city and Carnivals were held\nevery year.\n\nAnd then, of course, there would be the Goddess of Reason, in her\ntriumphal car! the apotheosis of the new religion, which was to make\neverybody happy, rich and free.\n\nForgotten were the anxieties of the night, the fears of death, the\ngreat and glorious Revolution, which for this one day would cease her\nperpetual demand for the toll of blood.\n\nNothing was remembered save the pleasures and joys of the moment, and at\ntimes the name of that Englishman--spy, hero or adventurer--the cause of\nall this bounty: the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXX: The Procession\n\n\n\nThe grandfathers of the present generation of Boulonnese remembered\nthe great day of the National Fete, when all Boulogne, for twenty-four\nhours, went crazy with joy. So many families had fathers, brothers,\nsons, languishing in prison under some charge of treason, real or\nimaginary; so many had dear ones for whom already the guillotine loomed\nahead, that the feast on this memorable day of September, 1793, was one\nof never-to-be-forgotten relief and thanksgiving.\n\nThe weather all day had been exceptionally fine. After that glorious\nsunrise, the sky had remained all day clad in its gorgeous mantle of\nblue and the sun had continued to smile benignly on the many varied\ndoings of this gay, little seaport town. When it began to sink slowly\ntowards the West a few little fluffy clouds appeared on the horizon,\nand from a distance, although the sky remained clear and blue, the sea\nlooked quite dark and slaty against the brilliance of the firmament.\n\nGradually, as the splendour of the sunset gave place to the delicate\npurple and grey tints of evening, the little fluffy clouds merged\nthemselves into denser masses, and these too soon became absorbed in the\ngreat, billowy banks which the southwesterly wind was blowing seawards.\n\nBy the time that the last grey streak of dusk vanished in the West, the\nwhole sky looked heavy with clouds, and the evening set in, threatening\nand dark.\n\nBut this by no means mitigated the anticipation of pleasure to come. On\nthe contrary, the fast-gathering gloom was hailed with delight, since it\nwould surely help to show off the coloured lights of the lanthorns, and\ngive additional value to the glow of the torches.\n\nOf a truth 'twas a motley throng which began to assemble on the Place de\nla Senechaussee, just as the old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of\nsix. Men, women and children in ragged finery, Pierrots with neck frills\nand floured faces, hideous masks of impossible beasts roughly besmeared\nin crude colours. There were gaily-coloured dominoes, blue, green, pink\nand purple, harlequins combining all the colours of the rainbow in\none tight-fitting garment, and Columbines with short, tarlatan skirts,\nbeneath which peeped bare feet and ankles. There were judges' perruqes,\nand soldiers' helmets of past generations, tall Normandy caps adorned\nwith hundreds of streaming ribbons, and powdered headgear which recalled\nthe glories of Versailles.\n\nEverything was torn and dirty, the dominoes were in rags, the Pierrot\nfrills, mostly made up of paper, already hung in strips over the\nwearers' shoulders. But what mattered that?\n\nThe crowd pushed and jolted, shouted and laughed, the girls screamed as\nthe men snatched a kiss here and there from willing or unwilling lips,\nor stole an arm round a gaily accoutred waist. The spirit of Old King\nCarnival was in the evening air--a spirit just awakened from a long Rip\nvan Winkle-like sleep.\n\nIn the centre of the Place stood the guillotine, grim and gaunt with\nlong, thin arms stretched out towards the sky, the last glimmer of\nwaning light striking the triangular knife, there, where it was not\nrusty with stains of blood.\n\nFor weeks now Madame Guillotine had been much occupied plying her\ngruesome trade; she now stood there in the gloom, passive and immovable,\nseeming to wait placidly for the end of this holiday, ready to begin her\nwork again on the morrow. She towered above these merrymakers, hoisted\nup on the platform whereon many an innocent foot had trodden, the\ntattered basket beside her, into which many an innocent head had rolled.\n\nWhat cared they to-night for Madame Guillotine and the horrors of\nwhich she told? A crowd of Pierrots with floured faces and tattered\nneck-frills had just swarmed up the wooden steps, shouting and laughing,\nchasing each other round and round on the platform, until one of them\nlost his footing and fell into the basket, covering himself with bran\nand staining his clothes with blood.\n\n\"Ah! vogue la galere! We must be merry to-night!\"\n\nAnd all these people who for weeks past had been staring death and the\nguillotine in the face, had denounced each other with savage callousness\nin order to save themselves, or hidden for days in dark cellars to\nescape apprehension, now laughed, and danced and shrieked with gladness\nin a sudden, hysterical outburst of joy.\n\nClose beside the guillotine stood the triumphal car of the Goddess of\nReason, the special feature of this great national fete. It was only a\nrough market cart, painted by an unpractised hand with bright, crimson\npaint and adorned with huge clusters of autumn-tinted leaves, and the\nscarlet berries of mountain ash and rowan, culled from the town gardens,\nor the country side outside the city walls.\n\nIn the cart the goddess reclined on a crimson-draped seat, she, herself,\nswathed in white, and wearing a gorgeous necklace around her neck.\nDesiree Candeille, a little pale, a little apprehensive of all this\nnoise, had obeyed the final dictates of her taskmaster. She had been the\nmeans of bringing the Scarlet Pimpernel to France and vengeance, she was\nto be honoured therefore above every other woman in France.\n\nShe sat in the car, vaguely thinking over the events of the past few\ndays, whilst watching the throng of rowdy merrymakers seething around\nher. She thought of the noble-hearted, proud woman whom she had helped\nto bring from her beautiful English home to sorrow and humiliation in\na dank French prison, she thought of the gallant English gentleman with\nhis pleasant voice and courtly, debonnair manners.\n\nChauvelin had roughly told her, only this morning, that both were now\nunder arrest as English spies, and that their fate no longer concerned\nher. Later on the governor of the city had come to tell her that Citizen\nChauvelin desired her to take part in the procession and the national\nfete, as the Goddess of Reason, and that the people of Boulogne were\nready to welcome her as such. This had pleased Candeille's vanity, and\nall day, whilst arranging the finery which she meant to wear for the\noccasion, she had ceased to think of England and of Lady Blakeney.\n\nBut now, when she arrived on the Place de la Senechaussee, and mounting\nher car, found herself on a level with the platform of the guillotine,\nher memory flew back to England, to the lavish hospitality of Blakeney\nManor, Marguerite's gentle voice, the pleasing grace of Sir Percy's\nmanners, and she shuddered a little when that cruel glint of evening\nlight caused the knife of the guillotine to glisten from out the gloom.\n\nBut anon her reflections were suddenly interrupted by loud and prolonged\nshouts of joy. A whole throng of Pierrots had swarmed into the Place\nfrom every side, carrying lighted torches and tall staves, on which were\nhung lanthorns with many-coloured lights.\n\nThe procession was ready to start. A stentorian voice shouted out in\nresonant accents:\n\n\"En avant, la grosse caisse!\"\n\nA man now, portly and gorgeous in scarlet and blue, detached himself\nfrom out the crowd. His head was hidden beneath the monstrous mask of\na cardboard lion, roughly painted in brown and yellow, with crimson\nfor the widely open jaws and the corners of the eyes, to make them seem\nferocious and bloodshot. His coat was of bright crimson cloth, with cuts\nand slashings in it, through which bunches of bright blue paper were\nmade to protrude, in imitation of the costume of mediaeval times.\n\nHe had blue stockings on and bright scarlet slippers, and behind him\nfloated a large strip of scarlet flannel, on which moons and suns and\nstars of gold had been showered in plenty.\n\nUpon his portly figure in front he was supporting the big drum, which\nwas securely strapped round his shoulders with tarred cordages, the\nspoil of some fishing vessel.\n\nThere was a merciful slit in the jaw of the cardboard lion, through\nwhich the portly drummer puffed and spluttered as he shouted lustily:\n\n\"En avant!\"\n\nAnd wielding the heavy drumstick with a powerful arm, he brought it\ncrashing down against the side of the mighty instrument.\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah! en avant les trompettes!\"\n\nA fanfare of brass instruments followed, lustily blown by twelve\nyoung men in motley coats of green, and tall, peaked hats adorned with\nfeathers.\n\nThe drummer had begun to march, closely followed by the trumpeters.\nBehind them a bevy of Columbines in many-coloured tarlatan skirts and\nhair flying wildly in the breeze, giggling, pushing, exchanging ribald\njokes with the men behind, and getting kissed or slapped for their\npains.\n\nThen the triumphal car of the goddess, with Demoiselle Candeille\nstanding straight up in it, a tall gold wand in one hand, the other\nresting in a mass of scarlet berries. All round the car, helter-skelter,\ntumbling, pushing, came Pierrots and Pierrettes, carrying lanthorns, and\nHarlequins bearing the torches.\n\nAnd after the car the long line of more sober folk, the older fisherman,\nthe women in caps and many-hued skirts, the serious townfolk who had\nscorned the travesty, yet would not be left out of the procession. They\nall began to march, to the tune of those noisy brass trumpets which were\nthundering forth snatches from the newly composed \"Marseillaise.\"\n\nAbove the sky became more heavy with clouds. Anon a few drops of rain\nbegan to fall, making the torches sizzle and splutter, and scatter\ngrease and tar around and wetting the lightly-covered shoulders\nof tarlatan-clad Columbines. But no one cared! The glow of so much\nmerrymaking kept the blood warm and the skin dry.\n\nThe flour all came off the Pierrots' faces, the blue paper slashings of\nthe drummer-in-chief hung in pulpy lumps against his gorgeous scarlet\ncloak. The trumpeters' feathers became streaky and bedraggled.\n\nBut in the name of that good God who had ceased to exist, who in the\nworld or out of it cared if it rained, or thundered and stormed! This\nwas a national holiday, for an English spy was captured, and all natives\nof Boulogne were free of the guillotine to-night.\n\nThe revellers were making the circuit of the town, with lanthorns\nfluttering in the wind, and flickering torches held up aloft illumining\nlaughing faces, red with the glow of a drunken joy, young faces that\nonly enjoyed the moment's pleasure, serious ones that withheld a frown\nat thought of the morrow. The fitful light played on the grotesque\nmasques of beasts and reptiles, on the diamond necklace of a very\nearthly goddess, on God's glorious spoils from gardens and country-side,\non smothered anxiety and repressed cruelty.\n\nThe crowd had turned its back on the guillotine, and the trumpets\nnow changed the inspiriting tune of the \"Marseillaise\" to the ribald\nvulgarity of the \"Ca ira!\"\n\nEveryone yelled and shouted. Girls with flowing hair produced\nbroomsticks, and astride on these, broke from the ranks and danced a mad\nand obscene saraband, a dance of witches in the weird glow of sizzling\ntorches, to the accompaniment of raucous laughter and of coarse jokes.\n\nThus the procession passed on, a sight to gladden the eyes of those who\nhad desired to smother all thought of the Infinite, of Eternity and of\nGod in the minds of those to whom they had nothing to offer in return.\nA threat of death yesterday, misery, starvation and squalor! all the\nhideousness of a destroying anarchy, that had nothing to give save a\nnational fete, a tinsel goddess, some shallow laughter and momentary\nintoxication, a travesty of clothes and of religion and a dance on the\nashes of the past.\n\nAnd there along the ramparts where the massive walls of the city\nencircled the frowning prisons of Gayole and the old Chateau, dark\ngroups were crouching, huddled together in compact masses, which in\nthe gloom seemed to vibrate with fear. Like hunted quarry seeking for\nshelter, sombre figures flattened themselves in the angles of the\ndank walls, as the noisy carousers drew nigh. Then as the torches and\nlanthorns detached themselves from out the evening shadows, hand would\nclutch hand and hearts would beat with agonized suspense, whilst the\ndark and shapeless forms would try to appear smaller, flatter, less\nnoticeable than before.\n\nAnd when the crowd had passed noisily along, leaving behind it a trail\nof torn finery, of glittering tinsel and of scarlet berries, when the\nboom of the big drum and the grating noise of the brass trumpets had\nsomewhat died away, wan faces, pale with anxiety, would peer from out\nthe darkness, and nervous hands would grasp with trembling fingers the\nsmall bundles of poor belongings tied up hastily in view of flight.\n\nAt seven o'clock, so 'twas said, the cannon would boom from the old\nBeffroi. The guard would throw open the prison gates, and those who had\nsomething or somebody to hide, and those who had a great deal to fear,\nwould be free to go whithersoever they chose.\n\nAnd mothers, sisters, sweethearts stood watching by the gates, for\nloved ones to-night would be set free, all along of the capture of that\nEnglish spy, the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI: Final Dispositions\n\n\n\nTo Chauvelin the day had been one of restless inquietude and nervous\napprehension.\n\nCollot d'Herbois harassed him with questions and complaints intermixed\nwith threats but thinly veiled. At his suggestion Gayole had been\ntransformed into a fully-manned, well-garrisoned fortress. Troops\nwere to be seen everywhere, on the stairs and in the passages, the\nguard-rooms and offices: picked men from the municipal guard, and the\ncompany which had been sent down from Paris some time ago.\n\nChauvelin had not resisted these orders given by his colleague. He knew\nquite well that Marguerite would make no attempt at escape, but he had\nlong ago given up all hope of persuading a man of the type of Collot\nd'Herbois that a woman of her temperament would never think of saving\nher own life at the expense of others, and that Sir Percy Blakeney, in\nspite of his adoration for his wife, would sooner see her die before\nhim, than allow the lives of innocent men and women to be the price of\nhers.\n\nCollot was one of those brutish sots--not by any means infrequent among\nthe Terrorists of that time--who, born in the gutter, still loved to\nwallow in his native element, and who measured all his fellow-creatures\nby the same standard which he had always found good enough for\nhimself. In this man there was neither the enthusiastic patriotism of\na Chauvelin, nor the ardent selflessness of a Danton. He served the\nrevolution and fostered the anarchical spirit of the times only because\nthese brought him a competence and a notoriety, which an orderly and\nfastidious government would obviously have never offered him.\n\nHistory shows no more despicable personality than that of Collot\nd'Herbois, one of the most hideous products of that utopian Revolution,\nwhose grandly conceived theories of a universal levelling of mankind\nonly succeeded in dragging into prominence a number of half-brutish\ncreatures who, revelling in their own abasement, would otherwise have\nremained content in inglorious obscurity.\n\nChauvelin tolerated and half feared Collot, knowing full well that if\nnow the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped from his hands, he could expect no\nmercy from his colleagues.\n\nThe scheme by which he hoped to destroy not only the heroic leader but\nthe entire League by bringing opprobrium and ridicule upon them, was\nwonderfully subtle in its refined cruelty, and Chauvelin, knowing by now\nsomething of Sir Percy Blakeney's curiously blended character, was never\nfor a moment in doubt but that he would write the infamous letter, save\nhis wife by sacrificing his honour, and then seek oblivion and peace in\nsuicide.\n\nWith so much disgrace, so much mud cast upon their chief, the League of\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel would cease to be. THAT had been Chauvelin's plan\nall along. For the end he had schemed and thought and planned, from the\nmoment that Robespierre had given him the opportunity of redeeming his\nfailure of last year. He had built up the edifice of his intrigue, bit\nby bit, from the introduction of his tool, Candeille, to Marguerite at\nthe Richmond gala, to the arrest of Lady Blakeney in Boulogne. All that\nremained for him to see now, would be the attitude of Sir Percy Blakeney\nto-night, when, in exchange for the stipulated letter, he would see his\nwife set free.\n\nAll day Chauvelin had wondered how it would all go off. He had\nstage-managed everything, but he did not know how the chief actor would\nplay his part.\n\nFrom time to time, when his feeling of restlessness became quite\nunendurable, the ex-ambassador would wander round Fort Gayole and on\nsome pretext or other demand to see one or the other of his prisoners.\nMarguerite, however, observed complete silence in his presence: she\nacknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of the head, and\nin reply to certain perfunctory queries of his--which he put to her\nin order to justify his appearance--she either nodded or gave curt\nmonosyllabic answers through partially closed lips.\n\n\"I trust that everything is arranged for your comfort, Lady Blakeney.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"You will be rejoining the 'Day-Dream' to-night. Can I send a messenger\nover to the yacht for you?\"\n\n\"I thank you. No.\"\n\n\"Sir Percy is well. He is fast asleep, and hath not asked for your\nladyship. Shall I let him know that you are well?\"\n\nA nod of acquiescence from Marguerite and Chauvelin's string of queries\nwas at an end. He marvelled at her quietude and thought that she should\nhave been as restless as himself.\n\nLater on in the day, and egged on by Collot d'Herbois and by his own\nfears, he had caused Marguerite to be removed from No. 6.\n\nThis change he heralded by another brief visit to her, and his attitude\nthis time was one of deferential apology.\n\n\"A matter of expediency, Lady Blakeney,\" he explained, \"and I trust that\nthe change will be for your comfort.\"\n\nAgain the same curt nod of acquiescence on her part, and a brief:\n\n\"As you command, Monsieur!\"\n\nBut when he had gone, she turned with a sudden passionate outburst\ntowards the Abbe Foucquet, her faithful companion through the past long,\nweary hours. She fell on her knees beside him and sobbed in an agony of\ngrief.\n\n\"Oh! if I could only know... if I could only see him!... for a minute...\na second!... if I could only know!...\"\n\nShe felt as if the awful uncertainty would drive her mad.\n\nIf she could only know! If she could only know what he meant to do.\n\n\"The good God knows!\" said the old man, with his usual simple\nphilosophy, \"and perhaps it is all for the best.\"\n\nThe room which Chauvelin had now destined for Marguerite was one which\ngave from the larger one, wherein last night he had had his momentous\ninterview with her and with Sir Percy.\n\nIt was small, square and dark, with no window in it: only a small\nventilating hole high up in the wall and heavily grated. Chauvelin,\nwho desired to prove to her that there was no wish on his part to add\nphysical discomfort to her mental tortures, had given orders that the\nlittle place should be made as habitable as possible. A thick, soft\ncarpet had been laid on the ground; there was an easy chair and a\ncomfortable-looking couch with a couple of pillows and a rug upon it,\nand oh, marvel! on the round central table, a vase with a huge bunch\nof many-coloured dahlias which seemed to throw a note as if of gladness\ninto this strange and gloomy little room.\n\nAt the furthest corner, too, a construction of iron uprights and\ncrossway bars had been hastily contrived and fitted with curtains,\nforming a small recess, behind which was a tidy washstand, fine clean\ntowels and plenty of fresh water. Evidently the shops of Boulogne had\nbeen commandeered in order to render Marguerite's sojourn here outwardly\nagreeable.\n\nBut as the place was innocent of window, so was it innocent of doors.\nThe one that gave into the large room had been taken out of its hinges,\nleaving only the frame, on each side of which stood a man from the\nmunicipal guard with fixed bayonet.\n\nChauvelin himself had conducted Marguerite to her new prison. She\nfollowed him--silent and apathetic--with not a trace of that awful\ntorrent of emotion which had overwhelmed her but half-an-hour ago when\nshe had fallen on her knees beside the old priest and sobbed her heart\nout in a passionate fit of weeping. Even the sight of the soldiers\nleft her outwardly indifferent. As she stepped across the threshold she\nnoticed that the door itself had been taken away: then she gave another\nquick glance at the soldiers, whose presence there would control her\nevery movement.\n\nThe thought of Queen Marie Antoinette in the Conciergerie prison with\nthe daily, hourly humiliation and shame which this constant watch\nimposed upon her womanly pride and modesty, flashed suddenly across\nMarguerite's mind, and a deep blush of horror rapidly suffused her pale\ncheeks, whilst an almost imperceptible shudder shook her delicate frame.\n\nPerhaps, as in a flash, she had at this moment received an inkling\nof what the nature of that terrible \"either--or\" might be, with which\nChauvelin was trying to force an English gentleman to dishonour. Sir\nPercy Blakeney's wife had been threatened with Marie Antoinette's fate.\n\n\"You see, Madame,\" said her cruel enemy's unctuous voice close to her\near, \"that we have tried our humble best to make your brief sojourn here\nas agreeable as possible. May I express a hope that you will be quite\ncomfortable in this room, until the time when Sir Percy will be ready to\naccompany you to the 'Day-Dream.'\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" she replied quietly.\n\n\"And if there is anything you require, I pray you to call. I shall be in\nthe next room all day and entirely at your service.\"\n\nA young orderly now entered bearing a small collation--eggs, bread, milk\nand wine--which he set on the central table. Chauvelin bowed low before\nMarguerite and withdrew. Anon he ordered the two sentinels to stand the\nother side of the doorway, against the wall of his own room, and well\nout of sight of Marguerite, so that, as she moved about her own narrow\nprison, if she ate or slept, she might have the illusion that she was\nunwatched.\n\nThe sight of the soldiers had had the desired effect on her. Chauvelin\nhad seen her shudder and knew that she understood of that she guessed.\nHe was now satisfied and really had no wish to harass her beyond\nendurance.\n\nMoreover, there was always the proclamation which threatened the\nbread-winners of Boulogne with death if Marguerite Blakeney escaped,\nand which would be in full force until Sir Percy had written, signed and\ndelivered into Chauvelin's hands the letter which was to be the signal\nfor the general amnesty.\n\nChauvelin had indeed cause to be satisfied with his measures. There was\nno fear that his prisoners would attempt to escape.\n\nEven Collot d'Herbois had to admit everything was well done. He had read\nthe draft of the proposed letter and was satisfied with its contents.\nGradually now into his loutish brain there had filtrated the conviction\nthat Citizen Chauvelin was right, that that accursed Scarlet Pimpernel\nand his brood of English spies would be more effectually annihilated\nby all the dishonour and ridicule which such a letter written by the\nmysterious hero would heap upon them all, than they could ever be\nthrough the relentless work of the guillotine. His only anxiety now was\nwhether the Englishman would write that letter.\n\n\"Bah! he'll do it,\" he would say whenever he thought the whole matter\nover: \"Sacre tonnerre! but 'tis an easy means to save his own skin.\"\n\n\"You would sign such a letter without hesitation, eh, Citizen Collot,\"\nsaid Chauvelin, with well-concealed sarcasm, on one occasion when his\ncolleague discussed the all-absorbing topic with him; \"you would show\nno hesitation, if your life were at stake, and you were given the choice\nbetween writing that letter and... the guillotine?\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" responded Collot with conviction.\n\n\"More especially,\" continued Chauvelin drily, \"if a million francs were\npromised you as well?\"\n\n\"Sacre Anglais!\" swore Collot angrily, \"you don't propose giving him that\nmoney, do you?\"\n\n\"We'll place it ready to his hand, at any rate, so that it should appear\nas if he had actually taken it.\"\n\nCollot looked up at his colleague in ungrudging admiration. Chauvelin\nhad indeed left nothing undone, had thought everything out in this\nstrangely conceived scheme for the destruction of the enemy of France.\n\n\"But in the name of all the dwellers in hell, Citizen,\" admonished\nCollot, \"guard that letter well, once it is in your hands.\"\n\n\"I'll do better than that,\" said Chauvelin, \"I will hand it over to you,\nCitizen Collot, and you shall ride with it to Paris at once.\"\n\n\"To-night!\" assented Collot with a shout of triumph, as he brought his\ngrimy fist crashing down on the table, \"I'll have a horse ready saddled\nat this very gate, and an escort of mounted men... we'll ride like\nhell's own furies and not pause to breathe until that letter is in\nCitizen Robespierre's hands.\"\n\n\"Well thought of, Citizen,\" said Chauvelin approvingly. \"I pray you\ngive the necessary orders, that the horses be ready saddled, and the\nmen booted and spurred, and waiting at the Gayole gate, at seven o'clock\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"I wish the letter were written and safely in our hands by now.\"\n\n\"Nay! the Englishman will have it ready by this evening, never fear. The\ntide is high at half-past seven, and he will be in haste for his wife to\nbe aboard his yacht, ere the turn, even if he...\"\n\nHe paused, savouring the thoughts which had suddenly flashed across his\nmind, and a look of intense hatred and cruel satisfaction for a moment\nchased away the studied impassiveness of his face.\n\n\"What do you mean, Citizen?\" queried Collot anxiously, \"even if he...\nwhat?...\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing, nothing! I was only trying to make vague guesses as to\nwhat the Englishman will do AFTER he has written the letter,\" quoth\nChauvelin reflectively.\n\n\"Morbleu! he'll return to his own accursed country... glad enough to\nhave escaped with his skin.... I suppose,\" added Collot with sudden\nanxiety, \"you have no fear that he will refuse at the last moment to\nwrite that letter?\"\n\nThe two men were sitting in the large room, out of which opened the one\nwhich was now occupied by Marguerite. They were talking at the further\nend of it, close to the window, and though Chauvelin had mostly spoken\nin a whisper, Collot had ofttimes shouted, and the ex-ambassador was\nwondering how much Marguerite had heard.\n\nNow at Collot's anxious query he gave a quick furtive glance in the\ndirection of the further room wherein she sat, so silent and so still,\nthat it seemed almost as if she must be sleeping.\n\n\"You don't think that the Englishman will refuse to write the letter?\"\ninsisted Collot with angry impatience.\n\n\"No!\" replied Chauvelin quietly.\n\n\"But if he does?\" persisted the other.\n\n\"If he does, I send the woman to Paris to-night and have him hanged as\na spy in this prison yard without further formality or trial...\" replied\nChauvelin firmly; \"so either way, you see, Citizen,\" he added in a\nwhisper, \"the Scarlet Pimpernel is done for.... But I think that he will\nwrite the letter.\"\n\n\"Parbleu! so do I!...\" rejoined Collot with a coarse laugh.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII: The Letter\n\n\n\nLater on, when his colleague left him in order to see to the horses and\nto his escort for to-night, Chauvelin called Sergeant Hebert, his old\nand trusted familiar, to him and gave him some final orders.\n\n\"The Angelus must be rung at the proper hour, friend Hebert,\" he began\nwith a grim smile.\n\n\"The Angelus, Citizen?\" quoth the Sergeant, with complete stupefaction,\n\"'tis months now since it has been rung. It was forbidden by a decree of\nthe Convention, and I doubt me if any of our men would know how to set\nabout it.\"\n\nChauvelin's eyes were fixed before him in apparent vacancy, while the\nsame grim smile still hovered round his thin lips. Something of that\nirresponsible spirit of adventure which was the mainspring of all Sir\nPercy Blakeney's actions, must for the moment have pervaded the mind of\nhis deadly enemy.\n\nChauvelin had thought out this idea of having the Angelus rung to-night,\nand was thoroughly pleased with the notion. This was the day when the\nduel was to have been fought; seven o'clock would have been the very\nhour, and the sound of the Angelus to have been the signal for combat,\nand there was something very satisfying in the thought, that that same\nAngelus should be rung, as a signal that the Scarlet Pimpernel was\nwithered and broken at last.\n\nIn answer to Hebert's look of bewilderment Chauvelin said quietly:\n\n\"We must have some signal between ourselves and the guard at the\ndifferent gates, also with the harbour officials: at a given moment the\ngeneral amnesty must take effect and the harbour become a free port. I\nhave a fancy that the signal shall be the ringing of the Angelus: the\ncannons at the gates and the harbour can boom in response; then the\nprisons can be thrown open and prisoners can either participate in\nthe evening fete or leave the city immediately, as they choose. The\nCommittee of Public Safety has promised the amnesty: it will carry out\nits promise to the full, and when Citizen Collot d'Herbois arrives in\nParis with the joyful news, all natives of Boulogne in the prisons there\nwill participate in the free pardon too.\"\n\n\"I understand all that, Citizen,\" said Hebert, still somewhat\nbewildered, \"but not the Angelus.\"\n\n\"A fancy, friend Hebert, and I mean to have it.\"\n\n\"But who is to ring it, Citizen?\"\n\n\"Morbleu! haven't you one calotin left in Boulogne whom you can press\ninto doing this service?\"\n\n\"Aye! calotins enough! there's the Abbe Foucquet in this very\nbuilding... in No. 6 cell...\"\n\n\"Sacre tonnerre!\" ejaculated Chauvelin exultingly, \"the very man! I\nknow his dossier well! Once he is free, he will make straightway for\nEngland... he and his family... and will help to spread the glorious\nnews of the dishonour and disgrace of the much-vaunted Scarlet\nPimpernel!... The very man, friend Hebert!... Let him be stationed\nhere... to see the letter written... to see the money handed over--for\nwe will go through with that farce--and make him understand that the\nmoment I give him the order, he can run over to his old church St.\nJoseph and ring the Angelus. ... The old fool will be delighted... more\nespecially when he knows that he will thereby be giving the very signal\nwhich will set his own sister's children free.... You understand?...\"\n\n\"I understand, Citizen.\"\n\n\"And you can make the old calotin understand?\"\n\n\"I think so, Citizen.... You want him in this room.... At what time?\"\n\n\"A quarter before seven.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll bring him along myself, and stand over him, lest he play any\npranks.\"\n\n\"Oh! he'll not trouble you,\" sneered Chauvelin, \"he'll be deeply\ninterested in the proceedings. The woman will be here too, remember,\" he\nadded with a jerky movement of the hand in the direction of Marguerite's\nroom, \"the two might be made to stand together, with four of your\nfellows round them.\"\n\n\"I understand, Citizen. Are any of us to escort the Citizen Foucquet\nwhen he goes to St. Joseph?\"\n\n\"Aye! two men had best go with him. There will be a crowd in the streets\nby then... How far is it from here to the church?\"\n\n\"Less than five minutes.\"\n\n\"Good. See to it that the doors are opened and the bell ropes easy of\naccess.\"\n\n\"It shall be seen to, Citizen. How many men will you have inside this\nroom to-night?\"\n\n\"Let the walls be lined with men whom you can trust. I anticipate\nneither trouble nor resistance. The whole thing is a simple formality to\nwhich the Englishman has already intimated his readiness to submit. If\nhe changes his mind at the last moment there will be no Angelus rung, no\nbooming of the cannons or opening of the prison doors: there will be\nno amnesty, and no free pardon. The woman will be at once conveyed\nto Paris, and... But he'll not change his mind, friend Hebert,\" he\nconcluded in suddenly altered tones, and speaking quite lightly, \"he'll\nnot change his mind.\"\n\nThe conversation between Chauvelin and his familiar had been carried on\nin whispers: not that the Terrorist cared whether Marguerite overheard\nor not, but whispering had become a habit with this man, whose tortuous\nways and subtle intrigues did not lend themselves to discussion in a\nloud voice.\n\nChauvelin was sitting at the central table, just where he had been\nlast night when Sir Percy Blakeney's sudden advent broke in on his\nmeditations. The table had been cleared of the litter of multitudinous\npapers which had encumbered it before. On it now there were only a\ncouple of heavy pewter candlesticks, with the tallow candles fixed ready\nin them, a leather-pad, an ink-well, a sand-box and two or three quill\npens: everything disposed, in fact, for the writing and signing of the\nletter.\n\nAlready in imagination, Chauvelin saw his impudent enemy, the bold and\ndaring adventurer, standing there beside that table and putting his name\nto the consummation of his own infamy. The mental picture thus evoked\nbrought a gleam of cruel satisfaction and of satiated lust into the\nkeen, ferret-like face, and a smile of intense joy lit up the narrow,\npale-coloured eyes.\n\nHe looked round the room where the great scene would be enacted: two\nsoldiers were standing guard outside Marguerite's prison, two more at\nattention near the door which gave on the passage: his own half-dozen\npicked men were waiting his commands in the corridor. Presently the\nwhole room would be lined with troops, himself and Collot standing with\neyes fixed on the principal actor of the drama! Hebert with specially\nselected troopers standing on guard over Marguerite!\n\nNo, no! he had left nothing to chance this time, and down below the\nhorses would be ready saddled, that were to convey Collot and the\nprecious document to Paris.\n\nNo! nothing was left to chance, and in either case he was bound to win.\nSir Percy Blakeney would either write the letter in order to save\nhis wife, and heap dishonour on himself, or he would shrink from the\nterrible ordeal at the last moment and let Chauvelin and the Committee\nof Public Safety work their will with her and him.\n\n\"In that case the pillory as a spy and summary hanging for you, my\nfriend,\" concluded Chauvelin in his mind, \"and for your wife... Bah,\nonce you are out of the way, even she will cease to matter.\"\n\nHe left Hebert on guard in the room. An irresistible desire seized him\nto go and have a look at his discomfited enemy, and from the latter's\nattitude make a shrewd guess as to what he meant to do to-night.\n\nSir Percy had been given a room on one of the upper floors of the old\nprison. He had in no way been closely guarded, and the room itself\nhad been made as comfortable as may be. He had seemed quite happy and\ncontented when he had been conducted hither by Chauvelin, the evening\nbefore.\n\n\"I hope you quite understand, Sir Percy, that you are my guest here\nto-night,\" Chauvelin had said suavely, \"and that you are free to come\nand go, just as you please.\"\n\n\"Lud love you, sir,\" Sir Percy had replied gaily, \"but I verily believe\nthat I am.\"\n\n\"It is only Lady Blakeney whom we have cause to watch until to-morrow,\"\nadded Chauvelin with quiet significance. \"Is that not so, Sir Percy?\"\n\nBut Sir Percy seemed, whenever his wife's name was mentioned, to lapse\ninto irresistible somnolence. He yawned now with his usual affectation,\nand asked at what hour gentlemen in France were wont to breakfast.\n\nSince then Chauvelin had not seen him. He had repeatedly asked how the\nEnglish prisoner was faring, and whether he seemed to be sleeping and\neating heartily. The orderly in charge invariably reported that the\nEnglishman seemed well, but did not eat much. On the other hand, he\nhad ordered, and lavishly paid for, measure after measure of brandy and\nbottle after bottle of wine.\n\n\"Hm! how strange these Englishmen are!\" mused Chauvelin; \"this so-called\nhero is nothing but a wine-sodden brute, who seeks to nerve himself for\na trying ordeal by drowning his faculties in brandy... Perhaps after all\nhe doesn't care!...\"\n\nBut the wish to have a look at that strangely complex creature--hero,\nadventurer or mere lucky fool--was irresistible, and Chauvelin in the\nlatter part of the afternoon went up to the room which had been allotted\nto Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nHe never moved now without his escort, and this time also two of his\nfavourite bodyguards accompanied him to the upper floor. He knocked at\nthe door, but received no answer, and after a second or two he bade his\nmen wait in the corridor and, gently turning the latch, walked in.\n\nThere was an odour of brandy in the air; on the table two or three empty\nbottles of wine and a glass half filled with cognac testified to the\ntruth of what the orderly had said, whilst sprawling across the camp\nbedstead, which obviously was too small for his long limbs, his head\nthrown back, his mouth open for a vigorous snore, lay the imperturbable\nSir Percy fast asleep.\n\nChauvelin went up to the bedstead and looked down upon the reclining\nfigure of the man who had oft been called the most dangerous enemy of\nRepublican France.\n\nOf a truth, a fine figure of a man, Chauvelin was ready enough to admit\nthat; the long, hard limbs, the wide chest, and slender, white hands,\nall bespoke the man of birth, breeding and energy: the face too looked\nstrong and clearly-cut in repose, now that the perpetually inane smile\ndid not play round the firm lips, nor the lazy, indolent expression\nmar the seriousness of the straight brow. For one moment--it was a mere\nflash--Chauvelin felt almost sorry that so interesting a career should\nbe thus ignominiously brought to a close.\n\nThe Terrorist felt that if his own future, his own honour and integrity\nwere about to be so hopelessly crushed, he would have wandered up and\ndown this narrow room like a caged beast, eating out his heart with\nself-reproach and remorse, and racking his nerves and brain for an issue\nout of the terrible alternative which meant dishonour or death.\n\nBut this man drank and slept.\n\n\"Perhaps he doesn't care!\"\n\nAnd as if in answer to Chauvelin's puzzled musing a deep snore escaped\nthe sleeping adventurer's parted lips.\n\nChauvelin sighed, perplexed and troubled. He looked round the little\nroom, then went up to a small side table which stood against the wall\nand on which were two or three quill pens and an ink-well, also some\nloosely scattered sheets of paper. These he turned over with a careless\nhand and presently came across a closely written page. ---- \"Citizen\nChauvelin:--In consideration of a further sum of one million francs...\"\n\nIt was the beginning of the letter!... only a few words so far... with\nseveral corrections of misspelt words... and a line left out here and\nthere which confused the meaning... a beginning made by the unsteady\nhand of that drunken fool... an attempt only at present....\n\nBut still... a beginning.\n\nClose by was the draft of it as written out by Chauvelin, and which Sir\nPercy had evidently begun to copy.\n\nHe had made up his mind then.... He meant to subscribe with his own hand\nto his lasting dishonour... and meaning it, he slept!\n\nChauvelin felt the paper trembling in his hand. He felt strangely\nagitated and nervous, now that the issue was so near... so sure!...\n\n\"There's no demmed hurry for that, is there... er... Monsieur\nChaubertin?...\" came from the slowly wakening Sir Percy in somewhat\nthick, heavy accents, accompanied by a prolonged yawn. \"I haven't got\nthe demmed thing quite ready...\"\n\nChauvelin had been so startled that the paper dropped from his hand. He\nstooped to pick it up.\n\n\"Nay! why should you be so scared, sir?\" continued Sir Percy lazily,\n\"did you think I was drunk?... I assure you, sir, on my honour, I am not\nso drunk as you think I am.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin ironically, \"that you\nhave all your marvellous faculties entirely at your command.... I\nmust apologize for disturbing your papers,\" he added, replacing the\nhalf-written page on the table, \"I thought perhaps that if the letter\nwas ready ...\"\n\n\"It will be, sir... it will be... for I am not drunk, I assure you....\nand can write with a steady hand... and do honour to my signature....\"\n\n\"When will you have the letter ready, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"The 'Day-Dream' must leave the harbour at the turn of the tide,\" quoth\nSir Percy thickly. \"It'll be demmed well time by then... won't it,\nsir?...\"\n\n\"About sundown, Sir Percy... not later...\"\n\n\"About sundown... not later...\" muttered Blakeney, as he once more\nstretched his long limbs along the narrow bed.\n\nHe gave a loud and hearty yawn.\n\n\"I'll not fail you...\" he murmured, as he closed his eyes, and gave a\nfinal struggle to get his head at a comfortable angle, \"the letter will\nbe written in my best cali... calig.... Lud! but I'm not so drunk as you\nthink I am. ...\"\n\nBut as if to belie his own oft-repeated assertion, hardly was the last\nword out of his mouth than his stertorous and even breathing proclaimed\nthe fact that he was once more fast asleep.\n\nWith a shrug of the shoulders and a look of unutterable contempt at\nhis broken-down enemy, Chauvelin turned on his heel and went out of the\nroom.\n\nBut outside in the corridor he called the orderly to him and gave strict\ncommands that no more wine or brandy was to be served to the Englishman\nunder any circumstances whatever.\n\n\"He has two hours in which to sleep off the effects of all that brandy\nwhich he had consumed,\" he mused as he finally went back to his own\nquarters, \"and by that time he will be able to write with a steady\nhand.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII: The English Spy\n\n\n\nAnd now at last the shades of evening were drawing in thick and fast.\nWithin the walls of Fort Gayole the last rays of the setting sun had\nlong ago ceased to shed their dying radiance, and through the thick\nstone embrasures and the dusty panes of glass, the grey light of dusk\nsoon failed to penetrate.\n\nIn the large ground-floor room with its window opened upon the wide\npromenade of the southern ramparts, a silence reigned which was\noppressive. The air was heavy with the fumes of the two tallow candles\non the table, which smoked persistently.\n\nAgainst the walls a row of figures in dark blue uniforms with scarlet\nfacings, drab breeches and heavy riding boots, silent and immovable,\nwith fixed bayonets like so many automatons lining the room all round;\nat some little distance from the central table and out of the immediate\ncircle of light, a small group composed of five soldiers in the same\nblue and scarlet uniforms. One of these was Sergeant Hebert. In the\ncentre of this group two persons were sitting: a woman and an old man.\n\nThe Abbe Foucquet had been brought down from his prison cell a few\nminutes ago, and told to watch what would go on around him, after which\nhe would be allowed to go to his old church of St. Joseph and ring the\nAngelus once more before he and his family left Boulogne forever.\n\nThe Angelus would be the signal for the opening of all the prison gates\nin the town. Everyone to-night could come and go as they pleased, and\nhaving rung the Angelus, the abbe would be at liberty to join Francois\nand Felicite and their old mother, his sister, outside the purlieus of\nthe town.\n\nThe Abbe Foucquet did not quite understand all this, which was very\nrapidly and roughly explained to him. It was such a very little while\nago that he had expected to see the innocent children mounting up those\nawful steps which lead to the guillotine, whilst he himself was looking\ndeath quite near in the face, that all this talk of amnesty and of\npardon had not quite fully reached his brain.\n\nBut he was quite content that it had all been ordained by le bon Dieu,\nand very happy at the thought of ringing the dearly-loved Angelus in his\nown old church once again. So when he was peremptorily pushed into the\nroom and found himself close to Marguerite, with four or five soldiers\nstanding round them, he quietly pulled his old rosary from his pocket\nand began murmuring gentle \"Paters\" and \"Aves\" under his breath.\n\nBeside him sat Marguerite, rigid as a statue: her cloak thrown over her\nshoulders, so that its hood might hide her face. She could not now have\nsaid how that awful day had passed, how she had managed to survive the\nterrible, nerve-racking suspense, the agonizing doubt as to what was\ngoing to happen. But above all, what she had found most unendurable was\nthe torturing thought that in this same grim and frowning building her\nhusband was there... somewhere... how far or how near she could not\nsay... but she knew that she was parted from him and perhaps would not\nsee him again, not even at the hour of death.\n\nThat Percy would never write that infamous letter and LIVE, she knew.\nThat he might write it in order to save her, she feared was possible,\nwhilst the look of triumph on Chauvelin's face had aroused her most\nagonizing terrors.\n\nWhen she was summarily ordered to go into the next room, she realized\nat once that all hope now was more than futile. The walls lined with\ntroops, the attitude of her enemies, and above all that table with\npaper, ink and pens ready as it were for the accomplishment of the\nhideous and monstrous deed, all made her very heart numb, as if it were\nheld within the chill embrace of death.\n\n\"If the woman moves, speaks or screams, gag her at once!\" said Collot\nroughly the moment she sat down, and Sergeant Hebert stood over her,\ngag and cloth in hand, whilst two soldiers placed heavy hands on her\nshoulders.\n\nBut she neither moved nor spoke, not even presently when a loud and\ncheerful voice came echoing from a distant corridor, and anon the door\nopened and her husband came in, accompanied by Chauvelin.\n\nThe ex-ambassador was very obviously in a state of acute nervous\ntension; his hands were tightly clasped behind his back, and his\nmovements were curiously irresponsible and jerky. But Sir Percy Blakeney\nlooked a picture of calm unconcern: the lace bow at his throat was tied\nwith scrupulous care, his eyeglass upheld at quite the correct angle,\nand his delicate-coloured caped coat was thrown back just sufficiently\nto afford a glimpse of the dainty cloth suit and exquisitely embroidered\nwaistcoat beneath.\n\nHe was the perfect presentation of a London dandy, and might have\nbeen entering a royal drawing-room in company with an honoured guest.\nMarguerite's eyes were riveted on him as he came well within the circle\nof light projected by the candles, but not even with that acute sixth\nsense of a passionate and loving woman could she detect the slightest\ntremor in the aristocratic hands which held the gold-rimmed eyeglass,\nnor the faintest quiver of the firmly moulded lips.\n\nThis had occurred just as the bell of the old Beffroi chimed\nthree-quarters after six. Now it was close on seven, and in the centre\nof the room and with his face and figure well lighted up by the candles,\nat the table pen in hand sat Sir Percy writing.\n\nAt his elbow just behind him stood Chauvelin on the one side and Collot\nd'Herbois on the other, both watching with fixed and burning eyes the\nwriting of that letter.\n\nSir Percy seemed in no hurry. He wrote slowly and deliberately,\ncarefully copying the draft of the letter which was propped up in front\nof him. The spelling of some of the French words seemed to have\ntroubled him at first, for when he began he made many facetious\nand self-deprecatory remarks anent his own want of education, and\ncarelessness in youth in acquiring the gentle art of speaking so elegant\na language.\n\nPresently, however, he appeared more at his ease, or perhaps less\ninclined to talk, since he only received curt monosyllabic answers to\nhis pleasant sallies. Five minutes had gone by without any other sound,\nsave the spasmodic creak of Sir Percy's pen upon the paper, the while\nChauvelin and Collot watched every word he wrote.\n\nBut gradually from afar there had arisen in the stillness of evening a\ndistant, rolling noise like that of surf breaking against the cliffs.\nNearer and louder it grew, and as it increased in volume, so it gained\nnow in diversity. The monotonous, roll-like, far-off thunder was just as\ncontinuous as before, but now shriller notes broke out from amongst\nthe more remote sounds, a loud laugh seemed ever and anon to pierce the\ndistance and to rise above the persistent hubbub, which became the mere\naccompaniment to these isolated tones.\n\nThe merrymakers of Boulogne, having started from the Place de la\nSenechaussee, were making the round of the town by the wide avenue which\ntops the ramparts. They were coming past the Fort Gayole, shouting,\nsinging, brass trumpets in front, big drum ahead, drenched, hot, and\nhoarse, but supremely happy.\n\nSir Percy looked up for a moment as the noise drew neared, then turned\nto Chauvelin and pointing to the letter, he said:\n\n\"I have nearly finished!\"\n\nThe suspense in the smoke-laden atmosphere of this room was becoming\nunendurable, and four hearts at least were beating wildly with\noverpowering anxiety. Marguerite's eyes were fixed with tender intensity\non the man she so passionately loved. She did not understand his actions\nor his motives, but she felt a wild longing in her, to drink in every\nline of that loved face, as if with this last, long look she was bidding\nan eternal farewell to all hopes of future earthly happiness.\n\nThe old priest had ceased to tell his beads. Feeling in his kindly heart\nthe echo of the appalling tragedy which was being enacted before him, he\nhad put out a fatherly, tentative hand towards Marguerite, and given her\nicy fingers a comforting pressure.\n\nAnd in the hearts of Chauvelin and his colleague there was satisfied\nrevenge, eager, exultant triumph and that terrible nerve-tension which\nimmediately precedes the long-expected climax.\n\nBut who can say what went on within the heart of that bold adventurer,\nabout to be brought to the lowest depths of humiliation which it is in\nthe power of man to endure? What behind that smooth unruffled brow still\nbent laboriously over the page of writing?\n\nThe crowd was now on the Place Daumont; some of the foremost in\nthe ranks were ascending the stone steps which lead to the southern\nramparts. The noise had become incessant: Pierrots and Pierrettes,\nHarlequins and Columbines had worked themselves up into a veritable\nintoxication of shouts and laughter.\n\nNow as they all swarmed up the steps and caught sight of the open window\nalmost on a level with the ground, and of the large dimly-lighted room,\nthey gave forth one terrific and voluminous \"Hurrah!\" for the paternal\ngovernment up in Paris, who had given them cause for all this joy. Then\nthey recollected how the amnesty, the pardon, the national fete, this\nbrilliant procession had come about, and somebody in the crowd shouted:\n\n\"Allons! les us have a look at that English spy!...\"\n\n\"Let us see the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! let us see what he is like!\"\n\nThey shouted and stamped and swarmed round the open window, swinging\ntheir lanthorns and demanding in a loud tone of voice that the English\nspy be shown to them.\n\nFaces wet with rain and perspiration tried to peep in at the window.\nCollot gave brief orders to the soldiers to close the shutters at once\nand to push away the crowd, but the crowd would not be pushed. It would\nnot be gainsaid, and when the soldiers tried to close the window, twenty\nangry fists broke the panes of glass.\n\n\"I can't finish this writing in your lingo, sir, whilst this demmed row\nis going on,\" said Sir Percy placidly.\n\n\"You have not much more to write, Sir Percy,\" urged Chauvelin with\nnervous impatience, \"I pray you, finish the matter now, and get you gone\nfrom out this city.\"\n\n\"Send that demmed lot away, then,\" rejoined Sir Percy calmly.\n\n\"They won't go.... They want to see you...\"\n\nSir Percy paused a moment, pen in hand, as if in deep reflection.\n\n\"They want to see me,\" he said with a laugh. \"Why, demn it all... then,\nwhy not let em?...\"\n\nAnd with a few rapid strokes of the pen, he quickly finished the letter,\nadding his signature with a bold flourish, whilst the crowd, pushing,\njostling, shouting and cursing the soldiers, still loudly demanded to\nsee the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nChauvelin felt as if his heart would veritably burst with the wildness\nof its beating.\n\nThen Sir Percy, with one hand lightly pressed on the letter, pushed his\nchair away and with his pleasant ringing voice, said once again:\n\n\"Well! demn it... let 'em see me!...\"\n\nWith that he sprang to his feet and up to his full height, and as he did\nso he seized the two massive pewter candlesticks, one in each hand, and\nwith powerful arms well outstretched he held them high above his head.\n\n\"The letter...\" murmured Chauvelin in a hoarse whisper.\n\nBut even as he was quickly reaching out a hand, which shook with the\nintensity of his excitement, towards the letter on the table, Blakeney,\nwith one loud and sudden shout, threw the heavy candlesticks onto\nthe floor. They rattled down with a terrific crash, the lights were\nextinguished, and the whole room was immediately plunged in utter\ndarkness.\n\nThe crowd gave a wild yell of fear: they had only caught sight for\none instant of that gigantic figure--which, with arms outstretched had\nseemed supernaturally tall--weirdly illumined by the flickering light of\nthe tallow candles and the next moment disappearing into utter darkness\nbefore their very gaze. Overcome with sudden superstitious fear,\nPierrots and Pierrettes, drummer and trumpeters turned and fled in every\ndirection.\n\nWithin the room all was wild confusion. The soldiers had heard a cry:\n\n\"La fenetre! La fenetre!\"\n\nWho gave it no one knew, no one could afterwards recollect: certain it\nis that with one accord the majority of the men made a rush for the open\nwindow, driven thither partly by the wild instinct of the chase after\nan escaping enemy, and partly by the same superstitious terror which had\ncaused the crowd to flee. They clambered over the sill and dropped down\non to the ramparts below, then started in wild pursuit.\n\nBut when the crash came, Chauvelin had given one frantic shout:\n\n\"The letter!!!... Collot!!... A moi.... In his hand.... The letter!...\"\n\nThere was the sound of a heavy thud, of a terrible scuffle there on the\nfloor in the darkness and then a yell of victory from Collot d'Herbois.\n\n\"I have the letter! A Paris!\"\n\n\"Victory!\" echoed Chauvelin, exultant and panting, \"victory!! The\nAngelus, friend Hebert! Take the calotin to ring the Angelus!!!\"\n\nIt was instinct which caused Collot d'Herbois to find the door; he tore\nit open, letting in a feeble ray of light from the corridor. He stood in\nthe doorway one moment, his slouchy, ungainly form distinctly outlined\nagainst the lighter background beyond, a look of exultant and malicious\ntriumph, of deadly hate and cruelty distinctly imprinted on his face and\nwith upraised hand wildly flourishing the precious document, the brand\nof dishonour for the enemy of France.\n\n\"A Paris!\" shouted Chauvelin to him excitedly. \"Into Robespierre's\nhands. ... The letter!...\"\n\nThen he fell back panting, exhausted on the nearest chair.\n\nCollot, without looking again behind him, called wildly for the men\nwho were to escort him to Paris. They were picked troopers, stalwart\nveterans from the old municipal guard. They had not broken their ranks\nthroughout the turmoil, and fell into line in perfect order as they\nfollowed Citizen Collot out of the room.\n\nLess than five minutes later there was the noise of stamping and\nchamping of bits in the courtyard below, a shout from Collot, and the\nsound of a cavalcade galloping at break-neck speed towards the distant\nParis gate.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV: The Angelus\n\n\n\nAnd gradually all noises died away around the old Fort Gayole. The\nshouts and laugher of the merrymakers, who had quickly recovered from\ntheir fright, now came only as the muffled rumble of a distant storm,\nbroken here and there by the shrill note of a girl's loud laughter, or a\nvigorous fanfare from the brass trumpets.\n\nThe room where so much turmoil had taken place, where so many hearts had\nbeaten with torrent-like emotions, where the awesome tragedy of revenge\nand hate, of love and passion had been consummated, was now silent and\nat peace.\n\nThe soldiers had gone: some in pursuit of the revellers, some with\nCollot d'Herbois, others with Hebert and the calotin who was to ring the\nAngelus.\n\nChauvelin, overcome with the intensity of his exultation and the agony\nof the suspense which he had endured, sat, vaguely dreaming, hardly\nconscious, but wholly happy and content. Fearless, too, for his triumph\nwas complete, and he cared not now if he lived or died.\n\nHe had lived long enough to see the complete annihilation and dishonour\nof his enemy.\n\nWhat had happened to Sir Percy Blakeney now, what to Marguerite, he\nneither knew nor cared. No doubt the Englishman had picked himself up\nand got away through the window or the door: he would be anxious to get\nhis wife out of the town as quickly as possible. The Angelus would\nring directly, the gates would be opened, the harbour made free to\neveryone....\n\nAnd Collot was a league outside Boulogne by now... a league nearer to\nParis.\n\nSo what mattered the humbled wayside English flower?--the damaged and\nwithered Scarlet Pimpernel?...\n\nA slight noise suddenly caused him to start. He had been dreaming, no\ndoubt, having fallen into some kind of torpor, akin to sleep, after the\ndeadly and restless fatigue of the past four days. He certainly had been\nunconscious of everything around him, of time and of place. But now he\nfelt fully awake.\n\nAnd again he heard that slight noise, as if something or someone was\nmoving in the room.\n\nHe tried to peer into the darkness, but could distinguish nothing.\nHe rose and went to the door. It was still open, and close behind it\nagainst the wall a small oil lamp was fixed which lit up the corridor.\n\nChauvelin detached the lamp and came back with it into the room. Just\nas he did so there came to his ears the first sound of the little church\nbell ringing the Angelus.\n\nHe stepped into the room holding the lamp high above his head; its\nfeeble rays fell full upon the brilliant figure of Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nHe was smiling pleasantly, bowing slightly towards Chauvelin, and in his\nhand he held the sheathed sword, the blade of which had been fashioned\nin Toledo for Lorenzo Cenci, and the fellow of which was lying\nnow--Chauvelin himself knew not where.\n\n\"The day and hour, Monsieur, I think,\" said Sir Percy with courtly\ngrace, \"when you and I are to cross swords together; those are the\nsouthern ramparts, meseems. Will you precede, sir? and I will follow.\"\n\nAt sight of this man, of his impudence and of his daring, Chauvelin felt\nan icy grip on his heart. His cheeks became ashen white, his thin lips\nclosed with a snap, and the hand which held the lamp aloft trembled\nvisibly. Sir Percy stood before him, still smiling and with a graceful\ngesture pointing towards the ramparts.\n\nFrom the Church of St. Joseph the gentle, melancholy tones of the\nAngelus sounding the second Ave Maria came faintly echoing in the\nevening air.\n\nWith a violent effort Chauvelin forced himself to self-control,\nand tried to shake off the strange feeling of obsession which had\noverwhelmed him in the presence of this extraordinary man. He walked\nquite quietly up to the table and placed the lamp upon it. As in a flash\nrecollection had come back to him.. the past few minutes!... the letter!\nand Collot well on his way to Paris!\n\nBah! he had nothing to fear now, save perhaps death at the hand of this\nadventurer turned assassin in his misery and humiliation!\n\n\"A truce on this folly, Sir Percy,\" he said roughly, \"as you well know,\nI had never any intention of fighting you with these poisoned swords of\nyours and...\"\n\n\"I knew that, M. Chauvelin.... But do YOU know that I have the intention\nof killing you now... as you stand... like a dog!...\"\n\nAnd throwing down the sword with one of those uncontrolled outbursts of\nalmost animal passion, which for one instant revealed the real, inner\nman, he went up to Chauvelin and towering above him like a great\navenging giant, he savoured for one second the joy of looking down on\nthat puny, slender figure which he could crush with sheer brute force,\nwith one blow from his powerful hands.\n\nBut Chauvelin at this moment was beyond fear.\n\n\"And if you killed me now, Sir Percy,\" he said quietly and looking the\nman whom he so hated fully in the eyes, \"you could not destroy that\nletter which my colleague is taking to Paris at this very moment.\"\n\nAs he had anticipated, his words seemed to change Sir Percy's mood in\nan instant. The passion in the handsome, aristocratic face faded in\na trice, the hard lines round the jaw and lips relaxed, the fire of\nrevenge died out from the lazy blue eyes, and the next moment a long,\nloud, merry laugh raised the dormant echoes of the old fort.\n\n\"Nay, Monsieur Chaubertin,\" said Sir Percy gaily, \"but this is\nmarvellous... demmed marvellous... do you hear that, m'dear?...\nGadzooks! but 'tis the best joke I have heard this past\ntwelve-months.... Monsieur here thinks... Lud! but I shall die of\nlaughing.... Monsieur here thinks... that 'twas that demmed letter which\nwent to Paris... and that an English gentleman lay scuffling on the\nfloor and allowed a letter to be filched from him...\"\n\n\"Sir Percy!...\" gasped Chauvelin, as an awful thought seemed suddenly to\nflash across his fevered brain.\n\n\"Lud, sir, you are astonishing!\" said Sir Percy, taking a very much\ncrumpled sheet of paper from the capacious pocket of his elegant caped\ncoat, and holding it close to Chauvelin's horror-stricken gaze. \"THIS is\nthe letter which I wrote at that table yonder in order to gain time and\nin order to fool you.... But, by the Lord, you are a bigger demmed fool\nthan ever I took you to be, if you thought it would serve any other\npurpose save that of my hitting you in the face with it.\"\n\nAnd with a quick and violent gesture he struck Chauvelin full in the\nface with the paper.\n\n\"You would like to know, Monsieur Chaubertin, would you not?...\" he\nadded pleasantly, \"what letter it is that your friend, Citizen Collot,\nis taking in such hot haste to Paris for you.... Well! the letter is\nnot long and 'tis written in verse.... I wrote it myself upstairs to-day\nwhilst you thought me sodden with brandy and three-parts asleep. But\nbrandy is easily flung out of the window.... Did you think I drank it\nall?... Nay! as you remember, I told you that I was not so drunk as you\nthought?... Aye! the letter is writ in English verse, Monsieur, and it\nreads thus:\n\n\"We seek him here! we seek him there! Those Frenchies seek him\neverywhere! Is he in heaven? is he in hell? That demmed elusive\nPimpernel?\n\n\"A neat rhyme, I fancy, Monsieur, and one which will, if rightly\ntranslated, greatly please your friend and ruler, Citizen\nRobespierre.... Your colleague Citizen Collot is well on his way to\nParis with it by now. ... No, no, Monsieur... as you rightly said just\nnow... I really could not kill you... God having blessed me with the\nsaving sense of humour...\"\n\nEven as he spoke the third Ave Maria of the Angelus died away on the\nmorning air. From the harbour the old Chateau there came the loud boom\nof cannon.\n\nThe hour of the opening of the gates, of the general amnesty and free\nharbour was announced throughout Boulogne.\n\nChauvelin was livid with rage, fear and baffled revenge. He made a\nsudden rush for the door in a blind desire to call for help, but Sir\nPercy had toyed long enough with his prey. The hour was speeding on:\nHebert and some of the soldiers might return, and it was time to think\nof safety and of flight. Quick as a hunted panther, he had interposed\nhis tall figure between his enemy and the latter's chance of calling for\naid, then, seizing the little man by the shoulders, he pushed him back\ninto that portion of the room where Marguerite and the Abbe Foucquet had\nbeen lately sitting.\n\nThe gag, with cloth and cord, which had been intended for a woman were\nlying on the ground close by, just where Hebert had dropped them, when\nhe marched the old Abbe off to the Church.\n\nWith quick and dexterous hands, Sir Percy soon reduced Chauvelin to\nan impotent and silent bundle. The ex-ambassador after four days of\nharrowing nerve-tension, followed by so awful a climax, was weakened\nphysically and mentally, whilst Blakeney, powerful, athletic and always\nabsolutely unperturbed, was fresh in body and spirit. He had slept\ncalmly all the afternoon, having quietly thought out all his plans, left\nnothing to chance, and acted methodically and quickly, and invariably\nwith perfect repose.\n\nHaving fully assured himself that the cords were well fastened, the gag\nsecure and Chauvelin completely helpless, he took the now inert mass up\nin his arms and carried it into the adjoining room, where Marguerite for\ntwelve hours had endured a terrible martyrdom.\n\nHe laid his enemy's helpless form upon the couch, and for one moment\nlooked down on it with a strange feeling of pity quite unmixed with\ncontempt. The light from the lamp in the further room struck vaguely\nupon the prostrate figure of Chauvelin. He seemed to have lost\nconsciousness, for the eyes were closed, only the hands, which were tied\nsecurely to his body, had a spasmodic, nervous twitch in them.\n\nWith a good-natured shrug of the shoulders the imperturbable Sir Percy\nturned to go, but just before he did so, he took a scrap of paper from\nhis waistcoat pocket, and slipped it between Chauvelin's trembling\nfingers. On the paper were scribbled the four lines of verse which in\nthe next four and twenty hours Robespierre himself and his colleagues\nwould read.\n\nThen Blakeney finally went out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV: Marguerite\n\n\n\nAs he re-entered the large room, she was standing beside the table,\nwith one dainty hand resting against the back of the chair, her whole\ngraceful figure bent forward as if in an agony of ardent expectation.\n\nNever for an instant, in that supreme moment when his precious life was\nat stake, did she waver in courage or presence of mind. From the moment\nthat he jumped up and took the candlesticks in his hands, her sixth\nsense showed her as in a flash what he meant to do and how he would wish\nher to act.\n\nWhen the room was plunged in darkness she stood absolutely still;\nwhen she heard the scuffle on the floor she never trembled, for her\npassionate heart had already told her that he never meant to deliver\nthat infamous letter into his enemies' hands. Then, when there was the\ngeneral scramble, when the soldiers rushed away, when the room became\nempty and Chauvelin alone remained, she shrank quietly into the darkest\ncorner of the room, hardly breathing, only waiting.... Waiting for a\nsign from him!\n\nShe could not see him, but she felt the beloved presence there,\nsomewhere close to her, and she knew that he would wish her to wait....\nShe watched him silently... ready to help if he called... equally ready\nto remain still and to wait.\n\nOnly when the helpless body of her deadly enemy was well out of the\nway did she come from out the darkness, and now she stood with the full\nlight of the lamp illumining her ruddy golden hair, the delicate blush\non her cheek, the flame of love dancing in her glorious eyes.\n\nThus he saw her as he re-entered the room, and for one second he paused\nat the door, for the joy of seeing her there seemed greater than he\ncould bear.\n\nForgotten was the agony of mind which he had endured, the humiliations\nand the dangers which still threatened: he only remembered that she\nloved him and that he worshipped her.\n\nThe next moment she lay clasped in his arms. All was still around\nthem, save for the gentle patter-patter of the rain on the trees of the\nramparts: and from very far away the echo of laughter and music from the\ndistant revellers.\n\nAnd then the cry of the sea-mew thrice repeated from just beneath the\nwindow.\n\nBlakeney and Marguerite awoke from their brief dream: once more the\npassionate lover gave place to the man of action.\n\n\"'Tis Tony, an I mistake not,\" he said hurriedly, as with loving fingers\nstill slightly trembling with suppressed passion, he readjusted the hood\nover her head.\n\n\"Lord Tony?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Aye! with Hastings and one or two others. I told them to be ready for\nus to-night as soon as the place was quiet.\"\n\n\"You were so sure of success then, Percy?\" she asked in wonderment.\n\n\"So sure,\" he replied simply.\n\nThen he led her to the window, and lifted her onto the sill. It was not\nhigh from the ground and two pairs of willing arms were there ready to\nhelp her down.\n\nThen he, too, followed, and quietly the little party turned to walk\ntoward the gate. The ramparts themselves now looked strangely still\nand silent: the merrymakers were far away, only one or two passers-by\nhurried swiftly past here and there, carrying bundles, evidently bent on\nmaking use of that welcome permission to leave this dangerous soil.\n\nThe little party walked on in silence, Marguerite's small hand resting\non her husband's arm. Anon they came upon a group of soldiers who were\nstanding somewhat perfunctorily and irresolutely close by the open gate\nof the Fort.\n\n\"Tiens c'est l'Anglais!\" said one.\n\n\"Morbleu! he is on his way back to England,\" commented another lazily.\n\nThe gates of Boulogne had been thrown open to everyone when the Angelus\nwas rung and the cannon boomed. The general amnesty had been proclaimed,\neveryone had the right to come and go as they pleased, the sentinels had\nbeen ordered to challenge no one and to let everyone pass.\n\nNo one knew that the great and glorious plans for the complete\nannihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League had come to naught,\nthat Collot was taking a mighty hoax to Paris, and that the man who had\nthought out and nearly carried through the most fiendishly cruel plan\never conceived for the destruction of an enemy, lay helpless, bound and\ngagged, within his own stronghold.\n\nAnd so the little party, consisting of Sir Percy and Marguerite, Lord\nAnthony Dewhurst and my Lord Hastings, passed unchallenged through the\ngates of Boulogne.\n\nOutside the precincts of the town they met my Lord Everingham and Sir\nPhilip Glynde, who had met the Abbe Foucquet outside his little church\nand escorted him safely out of the city, whilst Francois and Felicite\nwith their old mother had been under the charge of other members of the\nLeague.\n\n\"We were all in the procession, dressed up in all sorts of ragged\nfinery, until the last moment,\" explained Lord Tony to Marguerite as the\nentire party now quickly made its way to the harbour. \"We did not know\nwhat was going to happen.... All we knew was that we should be wanted\nabout this time--the hour when the duel was to have been fought--and\nsomewhere near here on the southern ramparts... and we always have\nstrict orders to mix with the crowd if there happens to be one. When we\nsaw Blakeney raise the candlesticks we guessed what was coming, and we\neach went to our respective posts. It was all quite simple.\"\n\nThe young man spoke gaily and lightly, but through the easy banter of\nhis tone, there pierced the enthusiasm and pride of the soldier in the\nglory and daring of his chief.\n\nBetween the city walls and the harbour there was much bustle and\nagitation. The English packet-boat would lift anchor at the turn of the\ntide, and as every one was free to get aboard without leave or passport,\nthere were a very large number of passengers, bound for the land of\nfreedom.\n\nTwo boats from the \"Day-Dream\" were waiting in readiness for Sir Percy\nand my lady and those whom they would bring with them.\n\nSilently the party embarked, and as the boats pushed off and the sailors\nfrom Sir Percy's yacht bent to their oars, the old Abbe Foucquet began\ngently droning a Pater and Ave to the accompaniment of his beads.\n\nHe accepted joy, happiness and safety with the same gentle philosophy\nas he would have accepted death, but Marguerite's keen and loving ears\ncaught at the end of each \"Pater\" a gently murmured request to le bon\nDieu to bless and protect our English rescuer.\n\n\n\nOnly once did Marguerite make allusion to that terrible time which had\nbecome the past.\n\nThey were wandering together down the chestnut alley in the beautiful\ngarden at Richmond. It was evening, and the air was heavy with the\nrich odour of wet earth, of belated roses and dying mignonette. She had\npaused in the alley, and placed a trembling hand upon his arm, whilst\nraising her eyes filled with tears of tender passion up to his face.\n\n\"Percy!\" she murmured, \"have you forgiven me?\"\n\n\"What, m'dear?\"\n\n\"That awful evening in Boulogne... what that fiend demanded... his awful\n'either--or'... I brought it all upon you... it was all my fault.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear, for that 'tis I should thank you...\"\n\n\"Thank me?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" he said, whilst in the fast-gathering dusk she could only just\nperceive the sudden hardening of his face, the look of wild passion in\nhis eyes, \"but for that evening in Boulogne, but for that alternative\nwhich that devil placed before me, I might never have known how much you\nmeant to me.\"\n\nEven the recollection of all the sorrow, the anxiety, the torturing\nhumiliations of that night seemed completely to change him; the voice\nbecame trenchant, the hands were tightly clenched. But Marguerite drew\nnearer to him; her two hands were on his breast; she murmured gently:\n\n\"And now?...\"\n\nHe folded her in his arms, with an agony of joy, and said earnestly:\n\n\"Now I know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Elusive Pimpernel, by Baroness Emmuska Orczy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ELUSIVE PIMPERNEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2785.txt or 2785.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/7/8/2785/\n\nProduced by J.C.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
