The Man in the Iron Mask we're\nfamiliar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.\n[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the\nconfusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]\n\nWe intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four\netexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la\nValliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in\nthe Iron Mask.\n\nOne thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,\nentitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.\nWhile this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years\nAfter, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts\nthat we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years\nAfter, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty\nYears \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different\nwords \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after\nthe Twenty Years later.. .as per history. Also, the third book of the\nD'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the\nsubtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different\nvolumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the\nfirst volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later\ncan, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the\nfour-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,\nit refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material\nin the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the\nseries which may prove helpful:\n\nThe Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1625-1628.\n\nTwenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1648-1649.

Covers the years\n1661-1673.\n\nIf we've calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to\nthe modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still\nwidely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de\nBragelonne.\n\nHere is a list of the other Dumas Etexts we have published so far:\n\nSep 1999 La Tulipe Noire, by Alexandre\nDumas[Pere#6/French][tlpnrxxx.xxx]1910 This is an abridged edition in\nFrench, also see our full length English Etext Jul 1997 The Black Tulip,\nby Alexandre Dumas[Pere][Dumas#1][tbtlpxxx.xxx] 965 Jan 1998 The Count\nof Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas[Pere][crstoxxx.xxx]1184\n\n\nMany thanks to Dr. David Coward, whose editions of the D'Artagnan\nRomances have proved an invaluable source of information.\n\nIntroduction: In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le\nSiecle, the first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated\nplaywright Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some\nmanuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale\nwhile researching a history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They\nchronicled the adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon\nentering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues,\ninternational politics, and ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over\nthe next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth and\nhis three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits\nunraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in\nFrench and even English history.\n\nEventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,\nand became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief\nsummary of the first two novels:\n\nThe Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.\nThe young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and\nalmost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.\nInstead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's\nguards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.\nThe four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord\nto find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them\nacross both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the\nCardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,\nnamed simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of\nAustria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the\nfour friends.\n\nTwenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now\n1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has\ndied, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit\nupon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,\nthe real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.\nD'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have\nretired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de\nla Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.\nAramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of\nshedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has\nmarried a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But\ntrouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the\ninstitution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at\nhome the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings\nhis friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,\nbut Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death\nat the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our\nheroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,\nquiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,\n1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English\ntranslation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at\nvarious points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does\nnot give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the\nthree-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of\nthis etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition\ndoes, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first two\netexts:\n\nThe Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and\nD'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become\ndisgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with\nthe Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on\nhis own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,\nand, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune\nin the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich\ncitizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's\nbrother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own\nestate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to\nassume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly\nMazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,\nthe king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any\nmeans necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant\nbestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's\nloyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention\nthat Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could\npossibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation\nagainst the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends\nhim to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his\nlong-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At\nBelle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications\nis, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.\nThe blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting,\nshow evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.\nD'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,\nwhich is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting\nthat D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis\ntricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,\nand sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of\nthe danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a\npresent, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating\nColbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an\naudience with the king.\n\nTen Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of\nEngland arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into\ncomplete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is\nin love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,\nthankfully prevented by Raoul's timely and tactful intervention. After\nthe marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of\nBuckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke\nfights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and\nspiteful man, the sworn enemy of D'Artagnan, and, by the same token,\nthat of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are\nseriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.\nRaoul's friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to\nHenrietta's charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De\nGuiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king's eye falls on\nMadame Henrietta during the comte's absence, and this time Monsieur's\njealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and\nhis sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king\ncan pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They\nunfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul's fiancee. While the\ncourt is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears\nLouise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends\nbeneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for\nMadame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De\nGuiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their\nown affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise\nare trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the\nscandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise's attachment,\nthe king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite\nperiod.\n\nMeanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.\nAlthough the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask\nFouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it\nfor him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his\nnew mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels\nand her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown\nfriendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that\nBaisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D'Artagnan while inquiring of him\nas to Aramis's whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the\nmusketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden\novernight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet\nhad already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the\ngovernor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable\nresemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses\nthe existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the\ngeneral of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new\ngeneral of the order. On Aramis's advice, hoping to use Louise's\ninfluence with the king to counteract Colbert's influence, Fouquet also\nwrites a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never\nreaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it\nturns out to be an agent of Colbert's.\n\nPorthos, in the meantime, has been recovering from his midnight ride\nfrom Belle-Isle at Fouquet's residence at Saint-Mande. Athos has\nretired, once again to La Fere. D'Artagnan, little amused by the court's\nactivities at Fontainebleau, and finding himself with nothing to do, has\nreturned to Paris, and we find him again in Planchet's grocery shop.\n\nAnd so, the story continues in this, the third etext of The Vicomte de\nBragelonne. Enjoy!\n\nJohn Bursey\n\n\n\n\nChapter I. Malaga.\n\nDuring all these long and noisy debates between the opposite ambitions\nof politics and love, one of our characters, perhaps the one least\ndeserving of neglect, was, however, very much neglected, very much\nforgotten, and exceedingly unhappy. In fact, D'Artagnan--D'Artagnan,\nwe say, for we must call him by his name, to remind our readers of his\nexistence--D'Artagnan, we repeat, had absolutely nothing whatever to do,\namidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion. After following the king\nduring two whole days at Fontainebleau, and critically observing\nthe various pastoral fancies and heroi-comic transformations of his\nsovereign, the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to\nsatisfy the cravings of his nature. At every moment assailed by\npeople asking him, \"How do you think this costume suits me, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan?\" he would reply to them in quiet, sarcastic tones, \"Why,\nI think you are quite as well-dressed as the best-dressed monkey to\nbe found in the fair at Saint-Laurent.\" It was just such a compliment\nD'Artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any other:\nand, whether agreeable or not, the inquirer was obliged to be satisfied\nwith it. Whenever any one asked him, \"How do you intend to dress\nyourself this evening?\" he replied, \"I shall undress myself;\" at which\nthe ladies all laughed, and a few of them blushed. But after a couple\nof days passed in this manner, the musketeer, perceiving that nothing\nserious was likely to arise which would concern him, and that the king\nhad completely, or, at least, appeared to have completely forgotten\nParis, Saint-Mande, and Belle-Isle--that M. Colbert's mind was occupied\nwith illuminations and fireworks--that for the next month, at least,\nthe ladies had plenty of glances to bestow, and also to receive in\nexchange--D'Artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of\nprivate business. At the moment D'Artagnan made his request, his majesty\nwas on the point of going to bed, quite exhausted from dancing.\n\n\"You wish to leave me, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" inquired the king, with an\nair of astonishment; for Louis XIV. could never understand why any one\nwho had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave\nhim.\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I leave you simply because I am not of the\nslightest service to you in anything. Ah! if I could only hold the\nbalancing-pole while you were dancing, it would be a very different\naffair.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the king, gravely, \"people\ndance without balancing-poles.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" said the musketeer, continuing his imperceptible tone of\nirony, \"I had no idea such a thing was possible.\"\n\n\"You have not seen me dance, then?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"Yes; but I always thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic\nfeats. I was mistaken; all the more greater reason, therefore, that I\nshould leave for a time. Sire, I repeat, you have no present occasion\nfor my services; besides, if your majesty should have any need of me,\nyou would know where to find me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the king, and he granted him leave of absence.\n\nWe shall not look for D'Artagnan, therefore, at Fontainebleau, for to do\nso would be useless; but, with the permission of our readers, follow him\nto the Rue des Lombards, where he was located at the sign of the Pilon\nd'Or, in the house of our old friend Planchet. It was about eight\no'clock in the evening, and the weather was exceedingly warm; there\nwas only one window open, and that one belonging to a room on the\n_entresol_. A perfume of spices, mingled with another perfume less\nexotic, but more penetrating, namely, that which arose from the street,\nascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer. D'Artagnan, reclining\nin an immense straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out,\nbut simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form\nthat could possibly be seen. Both his arms were crossed over his head,\nhis head reclining upon his left shoulder, like Alexander the Great.\nHis eyes, usually so quick and intelligent in their expression, were\nnow half-closed, and seemed fastened, as it were, upon a small corner of\nblue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys; there was\njust enough blue, and no more, to fill one of the sacks of lentils, or\nharicots, which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the\nground floor. Thus extended at his ease, and sheltered in his place of\nobservation behind the window, D'Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased\nto be a soldier, as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the\npalace, but was, on the contrary, a quiet, easy-going citizen in a state\nof stagnation between his dinner and supper, or between his supper and\nhis bed; one of those strong, ossified brains, which have no more room\nfor a single idea, so fiercely does animal matter keep watch at the\ndoors of intelligence, narrowly inspecting the contraband trade which\nmight result from the introduction into the brain of a symptom of\nthought. We have already said night was closing in, the shops were being\nlighted, while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed,\nand the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch\ncould be heard retreating. D'Artagnan continued, however, to think\nof nothing, except the blue corner of the sky. A few paces from him,\ncompletely in the shade, lying on his stomach, upon a sack of Indian\ncorn, was Planchet, with both his arms under his chin, and his eyes\nfixed on D'Artagnan, who was either thinking, dreaming, or sleeping,\nwith his eyes open. Planchet had been watching him for a tolerably long\ntime, and, by way of interruption, he began by exclaiming, \"Hum! hum!\"\nBut D'Artagnan did not stir. Planchet then saw that it was necessary\nto have recourse to more effectual means still: after a prolonged\nreflection on the subject, the most ingenious means that suggested\nitself to him under the present circumstances, was to let himself roll\noff the sack on to the floor, murmuring, at the same time, against\nhimself, the word \"stupid.\" But, notwithstanding the noise produced\nby Planchet's fall, D'Artagnan, who had in the course of his existence\nheard many other, and very different falls, did not appear to pay the\nleast attention to the present one. Besides, an enormous cart, laden\nwith stones, passing from the Rue Saint-Mederic, absorbed, in the noise\nof its wheels, the noise of Planchet's tumble. And yet Planchet fancied\nthat, in token of tacit approval, he saw him imperceptibly smile at the\nword \"stupid.\" This emboldened him to say, \"Are you asleep, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"No, Planchet, I am not _even_ asleep,\" replied the musketeer.\n\n\"I am in despair,\" said Planchet, \"to hear such a word as _even_.\"\n\n\"Well, and why not; is it not a grammatical word, Monsieur Planchet?\"\n\n\"Of course, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Well, then, the word distresses me beyond measure.\"\n\n\"Tell me why you are distressed, Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"If you say that you are not _even_ asleep, it is as much as to say that\nyou have not even the consolation of being able to sleep; or, better\nstill, it is precisely the same as telling me that you are getting bored\nto death.\"\n\n\"Planchet, you know that I am never bored.\"\n\n\"Except to-day, and the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, it is a week since you returned here from\nFontainebleau; in other words, you have no longer your orders to issue,\nor your men to review and maneuver. You need the sound of guns, drums,\nand all that din and confusion; I, who have myself carried a musket, can\neasily believe that.\"\n\n\"Planchet,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I assure you I am not bored in the\nleast in the world.\"\n\n\"In that case, what are you doing, lying there, as if you were dead?\"\n\n\"My dear Planchet, there was, once upon a time, at the siege of La\nRochelle, when I was there, when you were there, when we both were\nthere, a certain Arab, who was celebrated for the manner in which he\nadjusted culverins. He was a clever fellow, although of a very odd\ncomplexion, which was the same color as your olives. Well, this Arab,\nwhenever he had done eating or working, used to sit down to rest\nhimself, as I am resting myself now, and smoked I cannot tell you\nwhat sort of magical leaves, in a large amber-mouthed tube; and if any\nofficers, happening to pass, reproached him for being always asleep, he\nused quietly to reply: 'Better to sit down than to stand up, to lie\ndown than to sit down, to be dead than to lie down.' He was an acutely\nmelancholy Arab, and I remember him perfectly well, form the color of\nhis skin, and the style of his conversation. He used to cut off the\nheads of Protestants with the most singular gusto!\"\n\n\"Precisely; and then used to embalm them, when they were worth the\ntrouble; and when he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about\nhim, he looked like a basket-maker making baskets.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Planchet, he did.\"\n\n\"Oh! I can remember things very well, at times!\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it; but what do you think of his mode of reasoning?\"\n\n\"I think it good in one sense, but very stupid in another.\"\n\n\"Expound your meaning, M. Planchet.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, in point of fact, then, 'better to sit down than to\nstand up,' is plain enough, especially when one may be fatigued,\" and\nPlanchet smiled in a roguish way; \"as for 'better to be lying down,'\nlet that pass, but as for the last proposition, that it is 'better to\nbe dead than alive,' it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own undoubted\npreference being for my bed; and if you are not of my opinion, it is\nsimply, as I have already had the honor of telling you, because you are\nboring yourself to death.\"\n\n\"Planchet, do you know M. La Fontaine?\"\n\n\"The chemist at the corner of the Rue Saint-Mederic?\"\n\n\"No, the writer of fables.\"\n\n\"Oh! _Maitre Corbeau!_\"\n\n\"Exactly; well, then, I am like his hare.\"\n\n\"He has got a hare also, then?\"\n\n\"He has all sorts of animals.\"\n\n\"Well, what does his hare do, then?\"\n\n\"M. La Fontaine's hare thinks.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\"\n\n\"Planchet, I am like that hare--I am thinking.\"\n\n\"You are thinking, you say?\" said Planchet, uneasily.\n\n\"Yes; your house is dull enough to drive people to think; you will admit\nthat, I hope.\"\n\n\"And yet, monsieur, you have a look-out upon the street.\"\n\n\"Yes; and wonderfully interesting that is, of course.\"\n\n\"But it is no less true, monsieur, that, if you were living at the back\nof the house, you would bore yourself--I mean, you would think--more\nthan ever.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Planchet, I hardly know that.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said the grocer, \"if your reflections are at all like those\nwhich led you to restore King Charles II.--\" and Planchet finished by a\nlittle laugh which was not without its meaning.\n\n\"Ah! Planchet, my friend,\" returned D'Artagnan, \"you are getting\nambitious.\"\n\n\"Is there no other king to be restored, M. d'Artagnan--no second Monk to\nbe packed up, like a salted hog, in a deal box?\"\n\n\"No, my dear Planchet; all the kings are seated on their respective\nthrones; less comfortably so, perhaps, than I am upon this chair; but,\nat all events, there they are.\" And D'Artagnan sighed deeply.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Planchet, \"you are making me very uneasy.\"\n\n\"You are very good, Planchet.\"\n\n\"I begin to suspect something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, you are getting thin.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, striking his chest which sounded like an empty\ncuirass, \"it is impossible, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Planchet, slightly overcome; \"if you were to get thin in my\nhouse--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I should do something rash.\"\n\n\"What would you do? Tell me.\"\n\n\"I should look out for the man who was the cause of all your anxieties.\"\n\n\"Ah! according to your account, I am anxious now.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are anxious; and you are getting thin, visibly getting thin.\n_Malaga!_ if you go on getting thin, in this way, I will take my sword\nin my hand, and go straight to M. d'Herblay, and have it out with him.\"\n\n\"What!\" said M. d'Artagnan, starting in his chair; \"what's that you say?\nAnd what has M. d'Herblay's name to do with your groceries?\"\n\n\"Just as you please. Get angry if you like, or call me names, if you\nprefer it; but, the deuce is in it. _I know what I know_.\"\n\nD'Artagnan had, during this second outburst of Planchet's, so placed\nhimself as not to lose a single look of his face; that is, he sat with\nboth his hands resting on both his knees, and his head stretched out\ntowards the grocer. \"Come, explain yourself,\" he said, \"and tell me\nhow you could possibly utter such a blasphemy. M. d'Herblay, your old\nmaster, my friend, an ecclesiastic, a musketeer turned bishop--do you\nmean to say you would raise your sword against him, Planchet?\"\n\n\"I could raise my sword against my own father, when I see you in such a\nstate as you are now.\"\n\n\"M. d'Herblay, a gentleman!\"\n\n\"It's all the same to me whether he's a gentleman or not. He gives you\nthe blue devils, that is all I know. And the blue devils make people\nget thin. _Malaga!_ I have no notion of M. d'Artagnan leaving my house\nthinner than when he entered it.\"\n\n\"How does he give me the blue devils, as you call it? Come, explain,\nexplain.\"\n\n\"You have had the nightmare during the last three nights.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you; and in your nightmare you called out, several times, 'Aramis,\ndeceitful Aramis!'\"\n\n\"Ah! I said that, did I?\" murmured D'Artagnan, uneasily.\n\n\"Yes, those very words, upon my honor.\"\n\n\"Well, what else? You know the saying, Planchet, 'dreams go by\ncontraries.'\"\n\n\"Not so; for every time, during the last three days, when you went out,\nyou have not once failed to ask me, on your return, 'Have you seen\nM. d'Herblay?' or else 'Have you received any letters for me from M.\nd'Herblay?'\"\n\n\"Well, it is very natural I should take an interest in my old friend,\"\nsaid D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Of course; but not to such an extent as to get thin on that account.\"\n\n\"Planchet, I'll get fatter; I give you my word of honor I will.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur, I accept it; for I know that when you give your\nword of honor, it is sacred.\"\n\n\"I will not dream of Aramis any more; and I will never ask you again\nif there are any letters from M. d'Herblay; but on condition that you\nexplain one thing to me.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I am a great observer; and just now you made use of a very singular\noath, which is unusual for you.\"\n\n\"You mean _Malaga!_ I suppose?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"It is the oath I have used ever since I have been a grocer.\"\n\n\"Very proper, too; it is the name of a dried grape, or raisin, I\nbelieve?\"\n\n\"It is my most ferocious oath; when I have once said _Malaga!_ I am a\nman no longer.\"\n\n\"Still, I never knew you use that oath before.\"\n\n\"Very likely not, monsieur. I had a present made me of it,\" said\nPlanchet; and, as he pronounced these words, he winked his eye with a\ncunning expression, which thoroughly awakened D'Artagnan's attention.\n\n\"Come, come, M. Planchet.\"\n\n\"Why, I am not like you, monsieur,\" said Planchet. \"I don't pass my life\nin thinking.\"\n\n\"You do wrong, then.\"\n\n\"I mean in boring myself to death. We have but a very short time to\nlive--why not make the best of it?\"\n\n\"You are an Epicurean philosopher, I begin to think, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Why not? My hand is still as steady as ever; I can write, and can weigh\nout my sugar and spices; my foot is firm; I can dance and walk about; my\nstomach has its teeth still, for I eat and digest very well; my heart is\nnot quite hardened. Well, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Well, what, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Why, you see--\" said the grocer, rubbing his hands together.\n\nD'Artagnan crossed one leg over the other, and said, \"Planchet, my\nfriend, I am unnerved with extreme surprise; for you are revealing\nyourself to me under a perfectly new light.\"\n\nPlanchet, flattered in the highest degree by this remark, continued to\nrub his hands very hard together. \"Ah, ah,\" he said, \"because I happen\nto be only slow, you think me, perhaps, a positive fool.\"\n\n\"Very good, Planchet; very well reasoned.\"\n\n\"Follow my idea, monsieur, if you please. I said to myself,\" continued\nPlanchet, \"that, without enjoyment, there is no happiness on this\nearth.\"\n\n\"Quite true, what you say, Planchet,\" interrupted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"At all events, if we cannot obtain pleasure--for pleasure is not so\ncommon a thing, after all--let us, at least, get consolations of some\nkind or another.\"\n\n\"And so you console yourself?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"Tell me how you console yourself.\"\n\n\"I put on a buckler for the purpose of confronting _ennui_. I place my\ntime at the direction of patience; and on the very eve of feeling I am\ngoing to get bored, I amuse myself.\"\n\n\"And you don't find any difficulty in that?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"And you found it out quite by yourself?\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"It is miraculous.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say, that your philosophy is not to be matched in the Christian or\npagan world, in modern days or in antiquity!\"\n\n\"You think so?--follow my example, then.\"\n\n\"It is a very tempting one.\"\n\n\"Do as I do.\"\n\n\"I could not wish for anything better; but all minds are not of the same\nstamp; and it might possibly happen that if I were required to amuse\nmyself in the manner you do, I should bore myself horribly.\"\n\n\"Bah! at least try first.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me what you do.\"\n\n\"Have you observed that I leave home occasionally?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In any particular way?\"\n\n\"Periodically.\"\n\n\"That's the very thing. You have noticed it, then?\"\n\n\"My dear Planchet, you must understand that when people see each other\nevery day, and one of the two absents himself, the other misses him. Do\nyou not feel the want of my society when I am in the country?\"\n\n\"Prodigiously; that is to say, I feel like a body without a soul.\"\n\n\"That being understood then, proceed.\"\n\n\"What are the periods when I absent myself?\"\n\n\"On the fifteenth and thirtieth of every month.\"\n\n\"And I remain away?\"\n\n\"Sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes four days at a time.\"\n\n\"Have you ever given it a thought, why I was absent?\"\n\n\"To look after your debts, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And when I returned, how did you think I looked, as far as my face was\nconcerned?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly self-satisfied.\"\n\n\"You admit, you say, that I always look satisfied. And what have you\nattributed my satisfaction to?\"\n\n\"That your business was going on very well; that your purchases of rice,\nprunes, raw sugar, dried apples, pears, and treacle were advantageous.\nYou were always very picturesque in your notions and ideas, Planchet;\nand I was not in the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected\ngrocery as an occupation, which is of all trades the most varied, and\nthe very pleasantest, as far as the character is concerned; inasmuch as\none handles so many natural and perfumed productions.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, monsieur; but you are very greatly mistaken.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"In thinking that I leave here every fortnight, to collect my money or\nto make purchases. Ho, ho! how could you possibly have thought such\na thing? Ho, ho, ho!\" And Planchet began to laugh in a manner that\ninspired D'Artagnan with very serious misgivings as to his sanity.\n\n\"I confess,\" said the musketeer, \"that I do not precisely catch your\nmeaning.\"\n\n\"Very true, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'very true'?\"\n\n\"It must be true, since you say it; but pray, be assured that it in no\nway lessens my opinion of you.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is lucky.\"\n\n\"No; you are a man of genius; and whenever the question happens to be\nof war, tactics, surprises, or good honest blows to be dealt with, why,\nkings are marionettes, compared to you. But for the consolations of the\nmind, the proper care of the body, the agreeable things of like, if one\nmay say so--ah! monsieur, don't talk to me about men of genius; they are\nnothing short of executioners.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said D'Artagnan, really fidgety with curiosity, \"upon my word\nyou interest me in the highest degree.\"\n\n\"You feel already less bored than you did just now, do you not?\"\n\n\"I was not bored; yet since you have been talking to me, I feel more\nanimated.\"\n\n\"Very good, then; that is not a bad beginning. I will cure you, rely\nupon that.\"\n\n\"There is nothing I should like better.\"\n\n\"Will you let me try, then?\"\n\n\"Immediately, if you like.\"\n\n\"Very well. Have you any horses here?\"\n\n\"Yes; ten, twenty, thirty.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no occasion for so many as that, two will be quite\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"They are quite at your disposal, Planchet.\"\n\n\"Very good; then I shall carry you off with me.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Ah, you are asking too much.\"\n\n\"You will admit, however, that it is important I should know where I am\ngoing.\"\n\n\"Do you like the country?\"\n\n\"Only moderately, Planchet.\"\n\n\"In that case you like town better?\"\n\n\"That is as may be.\"\n\n\"Very well; I am going to take you to a place, half town and half\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"To a place where I am sure you will amuse yourself.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"Yes; and more wonderful still, to a place from which you have just\nreturned for the purpose only, it would seem, of getting bored here.\"\n\n\"It is to Fontainebleau you are going, then?\"\n\n\"Exactly; to Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"And, in Heaven's name, what are you going to do at Fontainebleau?\"\n\nPlanchet answered D'Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor.\n\n\"You have some property there, you rascal.\"\n\n\"Oh, a very paltry affair; a little bit of a house--nothing more.\"\n\n\"I understand you.\"\n\n\"But it is tolerable enough, after all.\"\n\n\"I am going to Planchet's country-seat!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Whenever you like.\"\n\n\"Did we not fix to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Let us say to-morrow, if you like; and then, besides, to-morrow is the\n14th, that is to say, the day before the one when I am afraid of getting\nbored; so we will look upon it as an understood thing.\"\n\n\"Agreed, by all means.\"\n\n\"You will lend me one of your horses?\"\n\n\"The best I have.\"\n\n\"No; I prefer the gentlest of all; I never was a very good rider, as\nyou know, and in my grocery business I have got more awkward than ever;\nbesides--\"\n\n\"Besides what?\"\n\n\"Why,\" added Planchet, \"I do not wish to fatigue myself.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" D'Artagnan ventured to ask.\n\n\"Because I should lose half the pleasure I expect to enjoy,\" replied\nPlanchet. And thereupon he rose from his sack of Indian corn, stretching\nhimself, and making all his bones crack, one after the other, with a\nsort of harmony.\n\n\"Planchet! Planchet!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"I do declare that there is\nno sybarite upon the face of the globe who can for a moment be compared\nto you. Oh, Planchet, it is very clear that we have never yet eaten a\nton of salt together.\"\n\n\"Why so, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Because, even now I can scarcely say I know you,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and\nbecause, in point of fact, I return to the opinion which, for a moment,\nI had formed of you that day at Boulogne, when you strangled, or did so\nas nearly as possible, M. de Wardes's valet, Lubin; in plain language,\nPlanchet, that you are a man of great resources.\"\n\nPlanchet began to laugh with a laugh full of self-conceit; bade the\nmusketeer good-night, and went down to his back shop, which he used as\na bedroom. D'Artagnan resumed his original position upon his chair, and\nhis brow, which had been unruffled for a moment, became more pensive\nthan ever. He had already forgotten the whims and dreams of Planchet.\n\"Yes,\" said he, taking up again the thread of his thoughts, which\nhad been broken by the whimsical conversation in which we have just\npermitted our readers to participate. \"Yes, yes, those three points\ninclude everything: First, to ascertain what Baisemeaux wanted with\nAramis; secondly, to learn why Aramis does not let me hear from him; and\nthirdly, to ascertain where Porthos is. The whole mystery lies in these\nthree points. Since, therefore,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"our friends tell\nus nothing, we must have recourse to our own poor intelligence. I must\ndo what I can, _mordioux_, or rather _Malaga_, as Planchet would say.\"\n\n\n\nChapter II. A Letter from M. Baisemeaux.\n\nD'Artagnan, faithful to his plan, went the very next morning to pay\na visit to M. de Baisemeaux. It was cleaning up or tidying day at the\nBastile; the cannons were furbished up, the staircases scraped and\ncleaned; and the jailers seemed to be carefully engaged in polishing\nthe very keys. As for the soldiers belonging to the garrison, they were\nwalking about in different courtyards, under the pretense that they were\nclean enough. The governor, Baisemeaux, received D'Artagnan with more\nthan ordinary politeness, but he behaved towards him with so marked a\nreserve of manner, that all D'Artagnan's tact and cleverness could not\nget a syllable out of him. The more he kept himself within bounds,\nthe more D'Artagnan's suspicion increased. The latter even fancied he\nremarked that the governor was acting under the influence of a recent\nrecommendation. Baisemeaux had not been at the Palais Royal with\nD'Artagnan the same cold and impenetrable man which the latter now found\nin the Baisemeaux of the Bastile. When D'Artagnan wished to make him\ntalk about the urgent money matters which had brought Baisemeaux in\nsearch of D'Artagnan, and had rendered him expansive, notwithstanding\nwhat had passed on that evening, Baisemeaux pretended that he had some\norders to give in the prison, and left D'Artagnan so long alone waiting\nfor him, that our musketeer, feeling sure that he should not get another\nsyllable out of him, left the Bastile without waiting until Baisemeaux\nreturned from his inspection. But D'Artagnan's suspicions were aroused,\nand when once that was the case, D'Artagnan could not sleep or remain\nquiet for a moment. He was among men what the cat is among quadrupeds,\nthe emblem of anxiety and impatience, at the same moment. A restless cat\ncan no more remain the same place than a silk thread wafted idly to and\nfro with every breath of air. A cat on the watch is as motionless as\ndeath stationed at its place of observation, and neither hunger nor\nthirst can draw it from its meditations. D'Artagnan, who was burning\nwith impatience, suddenly threw aside the feeling, like a cloak which\nhe felt too heavy on his shoulders, and said to himself that that which\nthey were concealing from him was the very thing it was important he\nshould know; and, consequently, he reasoned that Baisemeaux would not\nfail to put Aramis on his guard, if Aramis had given him any particular\nrecommendation, and this was, in fact, the very thing that happened.\n\nBaisemeaux had hardly had time to return from the donjon, than\nD'Artagnan placed himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit-Musc,\nso as to see every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile. After\nhe had spent an hour on the look-out from the \"Golden Portcullis,\" under\nthe pent-house of which he could keep himself a little in the shade,\nD'Artagnan observed a soldier leave the Bastile. This was, indeed, the\nsurest indication he could possibly have wished for, as every jailer\nor warder has certain days, and even certain hours, for leaving the\nBastile, since all are alike prohibited from having either wives or\nlodgings in the castle, and can accordingly leave without exciting any\ncuriosity; but a soldier once in barracks is kept there for four and\ntwenty hours when on duty,--and no one knew this better than D'Artagnan.\nThe guardsman in question, therefore, was not likely to leave his\nregimentals, except on an express and urgent order. The soldier, we\nwere saying, left the Bastile at a slow and lounging pace, like a happy\nmortal, in fact, who, instead of mounting sentry before a wearisome\nguard-house, or upon a bastion no less wearisome, has the good luck\nto get a little liberty, in addition to a walk--both pleasures being\nluckily reckoned as part of his time on duty. He bent his steps towards\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying the fresh air and the warmth of the\nsun, and looking at all the pretty faces he passed. D'Artagnan followed\nhim at a distance; he had not yet arranged his ideas as what was to be\ndone. \"I must, first of all,\" he thought, \"see the fellow's face. A man\nseen is a man judged.\" D'Artagnan increased his pace, and, which was not\nvery difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of the soldier. Not only\ndid he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of intelligence\nand resolution, but he noticed also that his nose was a little red. \"He\nhas a weakness for brandy, I see,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. At the\nsame moment that he remarked his red nose, he saw that the soldier had a\nwhite paper in his belt.\n\n\"Good, he has a letter,\" added D'Artagnan. The only difficulty was to\nget hold of the letter. But a common soldier would, of course, be only\ntoo delighted at having been selected by M. de Baisemeaux as a special\nmessenger, and would not be likely to sell his message. As D'Artagnan\nwas biting his nails, the soldier continued to advance more and more\ninto the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. \"He is certainly going to Saint-Mande,\"\nhe said to himself, \"and I shall not be able to learn what the letter\ncontains.\" It was enough to drive him wild. \"If I were in uniform,\" said\nD'Artagnan to himself, \"I would have this fellow seized, and his letter\nwith him. I could easily get assistance at the very first guard-house;\nbut the devil take me if I mention my name in an affair of this kind.\nIf I were to treat him to something to drink, his suspicions would be\nroused; and besides, he might drink me drunk. _Mordioux!_ my wits\nseem to have left me,\" said D'Artagnan; \"it is all over with me. Yet,\nsupposing I were to attack this poor devil, make him draw his sword\nand kill him for the sake of his letter? No harm in that, if it were\na question of a letter from a queen to a nobleman, or a letter from a\ncardinal to a queen; but what miserable intrigues are those of Messieurs\nAramis and Fouquet with M. Colbert. A man's life for that? No, no,\nindeed; not even ten crowns.\" As he philosophized in this manner, biting\nfirst his nails, and then his mustaches, he perceived a group of archers\nand a commissary of the police engaged in carrying away a man of very\ngentlemanly exterior, who was struggling with all his might against\nthem. The archers had torn his clothes, and were dragging him roughly\naway. He begged they would lead him along more respectfully, asserting\nthat he was a gentleman and a soldier. And observing our soldier walking\nin the street, he called out, \"Help, comrade.\"\n\nThe soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had\ncalled out to him, followed by the crowd. An idea suddenly occurred to\nD'Artagnan; it was his first one, and we shall find it was not a bad one\neither. During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that\nhe had just been seized in a house as a thief, when the truth was he\nwas only there as a lover; and while the soldier was pitying him, and\noffering him consolation and advice with that gravity which a French\nsoldier has always ready whenever his vanity or his _esprit de corps_ is\nconcerned, D'Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed\nin by the crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash, snatched\nthe letter from his belt. As at this moment the gentleman with the torn\nclothes was pulling about the soldier, to show how the commissary of\npolice had pulled him about, D'Artagnan effected his pillage of the\nletter without the slightest interference. He stationed himself about\nten paces distant, behind the pillar of an adjoining house, and read\non the address, \"To Monsieur du Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquet's,\nSaint-Mande.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he said, and then he unsealed, without tearing the letter,\ndrew out the paper, which was folded in four, from the inside; which\ncontained only these words:\n\n\"DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON,--Will you be good enough to tell Monsieur\nd'Herblay that _he_ has been to the Bastile, and has been making\ninquiries.\n\n\"Your devoted\n\n\"DE BAISEMEAUX.\"\n\n\n\"Very good! all right!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan; \"it is clear enough now.\nPorthos is engaged in it.\" Being now satisfied of what he wished to\nknow: \"_Mordioux!_\" thought the musketeer, \"what is to be done with that\npoor devil of a soldier? That hot-headed, cunning fellow, De Baisemeaux,\nwill make him pay dearly for my trick,--if he returns without the\nletter, what will they do to him? Besides, I don't want the letter;\nwhen the egg has been sucked, what is the good of the shell?\" D'Artagnan\nperceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in\nconvincing the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner,\nthe latter being still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing his\ncomplaints. D'Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let\nthe letter fall, without any one having observed him, and then retreated\nrapidly. The soldier resumed his route towards Saint-Mande, his mind\noccupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection. Suddenly\nhe thought of his letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no\nlonger there. D'Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden,\nterrified cry. The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked\nround him on every side, and at last, about twenty paces behind him,\nhe perceived the lucky envelope. He pounced on it like a falcon on its\nprey. The envelope was certainly a little dirty, and rather crumpled,\nbut at all events the letter itself was found. D'Artagnan observed that\nthe broken seal attracted the soldier's attention a good deal, but he\nfinished apparently by consoling himself, and returned the letter to his\nbelt. \"Go on,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I have plenty of time before me, so you\nmay precede me. It appears that Aramis is not in Paris, since Baisemeaux\nwrites to Porthos. Dear Porthos, how delighted I shall be to see him\nagain, and to have some conversation with him!\" said the Gascon. And,\nregulating his pace according to that of the soldier, he promised\nhimself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M. Fouquet's.\n\n\n\nChapter III. In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos\nHas Lost Nothing of His Muscularity.\n\nD'Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated that every hour\nis worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth sixty seconds. Thanks to\nthis perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he reached the\nsuperintendent's door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with\nhis belt empty. D'Artagnan presented himself at the door, which a porter\nwith a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him. D'Artagnan\nwould very much have liked to enter without giving his name, but this\nwas impossible, and so he gave it. Notwithstanding this concession,\nwhich ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least\nD'Artagnan thought so, the _concierge_ hesitated; however, at the second\nrepetition of the title, captain of the king's guards, the _concierge_,\nwithout quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it\ncompletely. D'Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive\ncharacter had been given. He decided, therefore, to tell a falsehood,--a\ncircumstance, moreover, which did not seriously affect his peace of\nmind, when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state\nitself, or even purely and simply his own individual personal interest,\nmight be at stake. He moreover added to the declarations he had already\nmade, that the soldier sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger,\nand that the only object that letter had in view was to announce his\nintended arrival. From that moment, no one opposed D'Artagnan's entrance\nany further, and he entered accordingly. A valet wished to accompany\nhim, but he answered that it was useless to take that trouble on his\naccount, inasmuch as he knew perfectly well where M. du Vallon was.\nThere was nothing, of course, to say to a man so thoroughly and\ncompletely informed on all points, and D'Artagnan was permitted,\ntherefore, to do as he liked. The terraces, the magnificent apartments,\nthe gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly inspected by the musketeer.\nHe walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal residence,\nwhich included as many wonders as articles of furniture, and as many\nservants as there were columns and doors. \"Decidedly,\" he said to\nhimself, \"this mansion has no other limits than the pillars of the\nhabitable world. Is it probable Porthos has taken it into his head to go\nback to Pierrefonds without even leaving M. Fouquet's house?\" He finally\nreached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a stone wall, which was\ncovered with a profusion of thick plants, luxuriant in blossoms as large\nand solid as fruit. At equal distances on the top of this wall were\nplaced various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes. These were\nvestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick, sinuous\nfolds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and guarding the\npalace with their fugitive glances. A statue of Hermes, with his\nfinger on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night,\nsprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and outbuildings,\nwhich could be seen through the trees. All these statues threw in white\nrelief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses, which\ndarted their somber summits towards the sky. Around these cypresses were\nentwined climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every\nfork of the branches, and spread over the lower boughs and the various\nstatues, showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance. These enchantments\nseemed to the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human\nmind. He felt in a dreamy, almost poetical, frame of mind. The idea\nthat Porthos was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of\nPorthos, showing how tremendously true it is, that even the very highest\norders of minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings.\nD'Artagnan found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind\nof spring which he detected; having touched it, the door flew open.\nD'Artagnan entered, closed the door behind him, and advanced into a\npavilion built in a circular form, in which no other sound could be\nheard but cascades and the songs of birds. At the door of the pavilion\nhe met a lackey.\n\n\"It is here, I believe,\" said D'Artagnan, without hesitation, \"that M.\nle Baron du Vallon is staying?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" answered the lackey.\n\n\"Have the goodness to tell him that M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan, captain\nof the king's musketeers, is waiting to see him.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was introduced into the _salon_, and had not long to remain\nin expectation: a well-remembered step shook the floor of the adjoining\nroom, a door opened, or rather flew open, and Porthos appeared and threw\nhimself into his friend's arms with a sort of embarrassment which did\nnot ill become him. \"You here?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"And you?\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Ah, you sly fellow!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, with a somewhat embarrassed smile; \"yes, you see\nI am staying in M. Fouquet's house, at which you are not a little\nsurprised, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not at all; why should you not be one of M. Fouquet's friends? M.\nFouquet has a very large number, particularly among clever men.\"\n\nPorthos had the modesty not to take the compliment to himself.\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"you saw me at Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"A greater reason for my believing you to be one of M. Fouquet's\nfriends.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I am acquainted with him,\" said Porthos, with a certain\nembarrassment of manner.\n\n\"Ah, friend Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"how treacherously you have\nbehaved towards me.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" exclaimed Porthos.\n\n\"What! you complete so admirable a work as the fortifications of\nBelle-Isle, and you did not tell me of it!\" Porthos colored. \"Nay, more\nthan that,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"you saw me out yonder, you know I\nam in the king's service, and yet you could not guess that the king,\njealously desirous of learning the name of the man whose abilities had\nwrought a work of which he heard the most wonderful accounts,--you could\nnot guess, I say, that the king sent me to learn who this man was?\"\n\n\"What! the king sent you to learn--\"\n\n\"Of course; but don't let us speak of that any more.\"\n\n\"Not speak of it!\" said Porthos; \"on the contrary, we will speak of it;\nand so the king knew that we were fortifying Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Of course; does not the king know everything?\"\n\n\"But he did not know who was fortifying it?\"\n\n\"No, he only suspected, from what he had been told of the nature of the\nworks, that it was some celebrated soldier or another.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Porthos, \"if I had only known that!\"\n\n\"You would not have run away from Vannes as you did, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No; what did you say when you couldn't find me?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I reflected.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed; you reflect, do you? Well, and what did that reflection\nlead to?\"\n\n\"It led me to guess the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Come, then, tell me what did you guess after all?\" said Porthos,\nsettling himself into an armchair, and assuming the airs of a sphinx.\n\n\"I guessed, in the first place, that you were fortifying Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"There was no great difficulty in that, for you saw me at work.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute; I also guessed something else,--that you were fortifying\nBelle-Isle by M. Fouquet's orders.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"But even that is not all. Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing,\nI do not stop on my road; and so I guessed that M. Fouquet wished to\npreserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications.\"\n\n\"I believe that was his intention, in fact,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Yes, but do you know why he wished to keep it secret?\"\n\n\"In order it should not become known, perhaps,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"That was his principal reason. But his wish was subservient to a bit of\ngenerosity--\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"I have heard it said that M. Fouquet was a very\ngenerous man.\"\n\n\"To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"You seem surprised at that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you didn't guess?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I know it, then.\"\n\n\"You are a wizard.\"\n\n\"Not at all, I assure you.\"\n\n\"How do you know it, then?\"\n\n\"By a very simple means. I heard M. Fouquet himself say so to the king.\"\n\n\"Say what to the king?\"\n\n\"That he fortified Belle-Isle on his majesty's account, and that he had\nmade him a present of Belle Isle.\"\n\n\"And you heard M. Fouquet say that to the king?\"\n\n\"In those very words. He even added: 'Belle-Isle has been fortified by\nan engineer, one of my friends, a man of a great deal of merit, whom I\nshall ask your majesty's permission to present to you.'\n\n\"'What is his name?' said the king.\n\n\"'The Baron du Vallon,' M. Fouquet replied.\n\n\"'Very well,' returned his majesty, 'you will present him to me.'\"\n\n\"The king said that?\"\n\n\"Upon the word of a D'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos. \"Why have I not been presented, then?\"\n\n\"Have they not spoken to you about this presentation?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; but I am always kept waiting for it.\"\n\n\"Be easy, it will be sure to come.\"\n\n\"Humph! humph!\" grumbled Porthos, which D'Artagnan pretended not to\nhear; and, changing the conversation, he said, \"You seem to be living in\na very solitary place here, my dear fellow?\"\n\n\"I always preferred retirement. I am of a melancholy disposition,\"\nreplied Porthos, with a sigh.\n\n\"Really, that is odd,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I never remarked that before.\"\n\n\"It is only since I have taken to reading,\" said Porthos, with a\nthoughtful air.\n\n\"But the labors of the mind have not affected the health of the body, I\ntrust?\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest degree.\"\n\n\"Your strength is as great as ever?\"\n\n\"Too great, my friend, too great.\"\n\n\"Ah! I had heard that, for a short time after your arrival--\"\n\n\"That I could hardly move a limb, I suppose?\"\n\n\"How was it?\" said D'Artagnan, smiling, \"and why was it you could not\nmove?\"\n\nPorthos, perceiving that he had made a mistake, wished to correct it.\n\"Yes, I came from Belle-Isle upon very hard horses,\" he said, \"and that\nfatigued me.\"\n\n\"I am no longer astonished, then, since I, who followed you, found seven\nor eight lying dead on the road.\"\n\n\"I am very heavy, you know,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"So that you were bruised all over.\"\n\n\"My marrow melted, and that made me very ill.\"\n\n\"Poor Porthos! But how did Aramis act towards you under those\ncircumstances?\"\n\n\"Very well, indeed. He had me attended to by M. Fouquet's own doctor.\nBut just imagine, at the end of a week I could not breathe any longer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The room was too small; I had absorbed every atom of air.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"I was told so, at least; and so I was removed into another apartment.\"\n\n\"Where you were able to breathe, I hope and trust?\"\n\n\"Yes, more freely; but no exercise--nothing to do. The doctor pretended\nthat I was not to stir; I, on the contrary, felt that I was stronger\nthan ever; that was the cause of a very serious accident.\"\n\n\"What accident?\"\n\n\"Fancy, my dear fellow, that I revolted against the directions of that\nass of a doctor, and I resolved to go out, whether it suited him or\nnot: and, consequently, I told the valet who waited on me to bring me my\nclothes.\"\n\n\"You were quite naked, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! on the contrary, I had a magnificent dressing-gown to wear. The\nlackey obeyed; I dressed myself in my own clothes, which had become\ntoo large for me; but a strange circumstance had happened,--my feet had\nbecome too large.\"\n\n\"Yes, I quite understand.\"\n\n\"And my boots too small.\"\n\n\"You mean your feet were still swollen?\"\n\n\"Exactly; you have hit it.\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_ And is that the accident you were going to tell me about?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I did not make the same reflection you have done. I said to\nmyself: 'Since my feet have entered my boots ten times, there is no\nreason why they should not go in the eleventh.'\"\n\n\"Allow me to tell you, my dear Porthos, that on this occasion you failed\nin your logic.\"\n\n\"In short, then, they placed me opposite to a part of the room which\nwas partitioned; I tried to get my boot on; I pulled it with my hands,\nI pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg, making the most\nunheard-of efforts, when suddenly the two tags of my boot remained in my\nhands, and my foot struck out like a ballista.\"\n\n\"How learned you are in fortification, dear Porthos.\"\n\n\"My foot darted out like a ballista, and came against the partition,\nwhich it broke in; I really thought that, like Samson, I had demolished\nthe temple. And the number of pictures, the quantity of china, vases\nof flowers, carpets, and window-panes that fell down were really\nwonderful.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Without reckoning that on the other side of the partition was a small\ntable laden with porcelain--\"\n\n\"Which you knocked over?\"\n\n\"Which I dashed to the other side of the room,\" said Porthos, laughing.\n\n\"Upon my word, it is, as you say, astonishing,\" replied D'Artagnan,\nbeginning to laugh also; whereupon Porthos laughed louder than ever.\n\n\"I broke,\" said Porthos, in a voice half-choked from his increasing\nmirth, \"more than three thousand francs worth of china--ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I smashed more than four thousand francs worth of glass!--ho, ho, ho!\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"Without counting a luster, which fell on my head and was broken into a\nthousand pieces--ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"Upon your head?\" said D'Artagnan, holding his sides.\n\n\"On top.\"\n\n\"But your head was broken, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, since I tell you, on the contrary, my dear fellow, that it was the\nluster which was broken, like glass, which, in point of fact, it was.\"\n\n\"Ah! the luster was glass, you say.\"\n\n\"Venetian glass! a perfect curiosity, quite matchless, indeed, and\nweighed two hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"And it fell upon your head!\"\n\n\"Upon my head. Just imagine, a globe of crystal, gilded all over, the\nlower part beautifully encrusted, perfumes burning at the top, with jets\nfrom which flame issued when they were lighted.\"\n\n\"I quite understand, but they were not lighted at the time, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Happily not, or I should have been grilled prematurely.\"\n\n\"And you were only knocked down flat, instead?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"How, 'not at all?'\"\n\n\"Why, the luster fell on my skull. It appears that we have upon the top\nof our heads an exceedingly thick crust.\"\n\n\"Who told you that, Porthos?\"\n\n\"The doctor. A sort of dome which would bear Notre-Dame.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Yes, it seems that our skulls are made in that manner.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, my dear fellow, it is your own skull that is made\nin that manner, and not the skulls of other people.\"\n\n\"Well, that may be so,\" said Porthos, conceitedly, \"so much, however,\nwas that the case, in my instance, that no sooner did the luster fall\nupon the dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a\nreport like a cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I fell,\ncovered from head to foot.\"\n\n\"With blood, poor Porthos!\"\n\n\"Not at all; with perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was\ndelicious, but the odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it;\nperhaps you have experienced it sometimes yourself, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Yes, in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my\npoor friend, you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the\nperfumes?\"\n\n\"Yes; but what is very remarkable, for the doctor told me he had never\nseen anything like it--\"\n\n\"You had a bump on your head I suppose?\" interrupted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I had five.\"\n\n\"Why five?\"\n\n\"I will tell you; the luster had, at its lower extremity, five gilt\nornaments; excessively sharp.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Well, these five ornaments penetrated my hair, which, as you see, I\nwear very thick.\"\n\n\"Fortunately so.\"\n\n\"And they made a mark on my skin. But just notice the singularity of\nit, these things seem really only to happen to me! Instead of making\nindentations, they made bumps. The doctor could never succeed in\nexplaining that to me satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will explain it to you.\"\n\n\"You will do me a great service if you will,\" said Porthos, winking his\neyes, which, with him, was sign of the profoundest attention.\n\n\"Since you have been employing your brain in studies of an exalted\ncharacter, in important calculations, and so on, the head has gained a\ncertain advantage, so that your head is now too full of science.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. The result is, that, instead of allowing any foreign\nmatter to penetrate the interior of the head, your bony box or skull,\nwhich is already too full, avails itself of the openings which are made\nin allowing this excess to escape.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that\nof the doctor.\n\n\"The five protuberances, caused by the five ornaments of the luster,\nmust certainly have been scientific globules, brought to the surface by\nthe force of circumstances.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"the real truth is, that I felt far worse\noutside my head than inside. I will even confess, that when I put my hat\nupon my head, clapping it on my head with that graceful energy which we\ngentlemen of the sword possess, if my fist was not very gently applied,\nI experienced the most painful sensations.\"\n\n\"I quite believe you, Porthos.\"\n\n\"Therefore, my friend,\" said the giant, \"M. Fouquet decided, seeing how\nslightly built the house was, to give me another lodging, and so they\nbrought me here.\"\n\n\"It is the private park, I think, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where the rendezvous are made; that park, indeed, which is\nso celebrated in some of those mysterious stories about the\nsuperintendent?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories\nmyself, but they have authorized me to exercise my muscles, and I take\nadvantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To keep my hand in, and also to take some birds' nests; I find it more\nconvenient than climbing.\"\n\n\"You are as pastoral as Tyrcis, my dear Porthos.\"\n\n\"Yes, I like the small eggs; I like them very much better than larger\nones. You have no idea how delicate an _omelette_ is, if made of four\nor five hundred eggs of linnets, chaffinches, starlings, blackbirds, and\nthrushes.\"\n\n\"But five hundred eggs is perfectly monstrous!\"\n\n\"A salad-bowl will hold them easily enough,\" said Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes, as if\nhe had seen him for the first time, while Porthos spread his chest\nout joyously and proudly. They remained in this state several minutes,\nPorthos smiling, and D'Artagnan looking at him. D'Artagnan was evidently\ntrying to give the conversation a new turn. \"Do you amuse yourself much\nhere, Porthos?\" he asked at last, very likely after he had found out\nwhat he was searching for.\n\n\"Not always.\"\n\n\"I can imagine that; but when you get thoroughly bored, by and by, what\ndo you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Oh! I shall not be here for any length of time. Aramis is waiting until\nthe last bump on my head disappears, in order to present me to the king,\nwho I am told cannot endure the sight of a bump.\"\n\n\"Aramis is still in Paris, then?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts is he, then?\"\n\n\"At Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"With M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Very good. But do you happen to know one thing?\"\n\n\"No, tell it me, and then I shall know.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I think Aramis is forgetting you.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"Yes; for at Fontainebleau yonder, you must know, they are laughing,\ndancing, banqueting, and drawing the corks of M. de Mazarin's wine in\nfine style. Are you aware that they have a ballet every evening there?\"\n\n\"The deuce they have!\"\n\n\"I assure you that your dear Aramis is forgetting you.\"\n\n\"Well, that is not at all unlikely, and I have myself thought so\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"Unless he is playing you a trick, the sly fellow!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"You know that Aramis is as sly as a fox.\"\n\n\"Yes, but to play _me_ a trick--\"\n\n\"Listen: in the first place, he puts you under a sort of sequestration.\"\n\n\"He sequestrates me! Do you mean to say I am sequestrated?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"I wish you would have the goodness to prove that to me.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier. Do you ever go out?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Do you ever ride on horseback?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Are your friends allowed to come and see you?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; never to go out, never to ride on horseback, never to\nbe allowed to see your friends, that is called being sequestrated.\"\n\n\"But why should Aramis sequestrate me?\" inquired Porthos.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"be frank, Porthos.\"\n\n\"As gold.\"\n\n\"It was Aramis who drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle-Isle,\nwas it not?\"\n\nPorthos colored as he said, \"Yes; but that was all he did.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and my own opinion is that it was no very great affair after\nall.\"\n\n\"That is mine, too.\"\n\n\"Very good; I am delighted we are of the same opinion.\"\n\n\"He never even came to Belle-Isle,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"There now, you see.\"\n\n\"It was I who went to Vannes, as you may have seen.\"\n\n\"Say rather, as I did see. Well, that is precisely the state of the\ncase, my dear Porthos. Aramis, who only drew the plans, wishes to pass\nhimself off as the engineer, whilst you, who, stone by stone, built the\nwall, the citadel, and the bastions, he wishes to reduce to the rank of\na mere builder.\"\n\n\"By builder, you mean mason, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Mason; the very word.\"\n\n\"Plasterer, in fact?\"\n\n\"Hodman?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! my dear Aramis, you seem to think you are only five and twenty\nyears of age still.\"\n\n\"Yes, and that is not all, for he believes you are fifty.\"\n\n\"I should have amazingly liked to have seen him at work.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"A fellow who has got the gout?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who has lost three of his teeth?\"\n\n\"Four.\"\n\n\"While I, look at mine.\" And Porthos, opening his large mouth very wide,\ndisplayed two rows of teeth not quite as white as snow, but even, hard,\nand sound as ivory.\n\n\"You can hardly believe, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"what a fancy the\nking has for good teeth. Yours decide me; I will present you to the king\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Why not? Do you think I have less credit at court than Aramis?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Do you think I have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications\nat Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"It is your own interest alone which would induce me to do it.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it in the least.\"\n\n\"Well, I am the intimate friend of the king; and a proof of that is,\nthat whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him, it is I who\nhave to do it.\"\n\n\"But, dear D'Artagnan, if you present me--\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Aramis will be angry.\"\n\n\"With me?\"\n\n\"No, with _me_.\"\n\n\"Bah! whether he or I present you, since you are to be presented, what\ndoes it matter?\"\n\n\"They were going to get me some clothes made.\"\n\n\"Your own are splendid.\"\n\n\"Oh! those I had ordered were far more beautiful.\"\n\n\"Take care: the king likes simplicity.\"\n\n\"In that case, I will be simple. But what will M. Fouquet say, when he\nlearns that I have left?\"\n\n\"Are you a prisoner, then, on parole?\"\n\n\"No, not quite that. But I promised him I would not leave without\nletting him know.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, we shall return to that presently. Have you anything to\ndo here?\"\n\n\"I, nothing: nothing of any importance, at least.\"\n\n\"Unless, indeed, you are Aramis's representative for something of\nimportance.\"\n\n\"By no means.\"\n\n\"What I tell you--pray, understand that--is out of interest for you. I\nsuppose, for instance, that you are commissioned to send messages and\nletters to him?\"\n\n\"Ah! letters--yes. I send certain letters to him.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Have you any letters, then?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Nay, let me speak. Have you any letters, I say?\"\n\n\"I have just received one for him.\"\n\n\"Interesting?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"You do not read them, then?\"\n\n\"I am not at all curious,\" said Porthos, as he drew out of his pocket\nthe soldier's letter which Porthos had not read, but D'Artagnan had.\n\n\"Do you know what to do with it?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Of course; do as I always do, send it to him.\"\n\n\"Not so.\"\n\n\"Why not? Keep it, then?\"\n\n\"Did they not tell you that this letter was important?\"\n\n\"Very important.\"\n\n\"Well, you must take it yourself to Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"To Aramis?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"And since the king is there--\"\n\n\"You will profit by that.\"\n\n\"I shall profit by the opportunity to present you to the king.\"\n\n\"Ah! D'Artagnan, there is no one like you for expedients.\"\n\n\"Therefore, instead of forwarding to our friend any messages, which may\nor may not be faithfully delivered, we will ourselves be the bearers of\nthe letter.\"\n\n\"I had never even thought of that, and yet it is simple enough.\"\n\n\"And therefore, because it is urgent, Porthos, we ought to set off at\nonce.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Porthos, \"the sooner we set off the less chance there is\nof Aramis's letter being delayed.\"\n\n\"Porthos, your reasoning is always accurate, and, in your case, logic\nseems to serve as an auxiliary to the imagination.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"It is the result of your hard reading,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"So come\nalong, let us be off.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Porthos, \"my promise to M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Not to leave Saint-Mande without telling him of it.\"\n\n\"Ah! Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"how very young you still are.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"You are going to Fontainebleau, are you not, where you will find M.\nFouquet?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Probably in the king's palace?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Porthos, with an air full of majesty.\n\n\"Well, you will accost him with these words: 'M. Fouquet, I have the\nhonor to inform you that I have just left Saint-Mande.'\"\n\n\"And,\" said Porthos, with the same majestic mien, \"seeing me at\nFontainebleau at the king's, M. Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am\nnot speaking the truth.\"\n\n\"My dear Porthos, I was just on the point of opening my lips to make\nthe same remark, but you anticipate me in everything. Oh! Porthos, how\nfortunately you are gifted! Years have made not the slightest impression\non you.\"\n\n\"Not over-much, certainly.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing more to say?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"All your scruples are removed?\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"In that case I shall carry you off with me.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and I will go and get my horse saddled.\"\n\n\"You have horses here, then?\"\n\n\"I have five.\"\n\n\"You had them sent from Pierrefonds, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, M. Fouquet gave them to me.\"\n\n\"My dear Porthos, we shall not want five horses for two persons;\nbesides, I have already three in Paris, which would make eight, and that\nwill be too many.\"\n\n\"It would not be too many if I had some of my servants here; but, alas!\nI have not got them.\"\n\n\"Do you regret them, then?\"\n\n\"I regret Mousqueton; I miss Mousqueton.\"\n\n\"What a good-hearted fellow you are, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but\nthe best thing you can do is to leave your horses here, as you have left\nMousqueton out yonder.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, by and by, it might turn out a very good thing if M. Fouquet\nhad never given you anything at all.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"It is not necessary you should understand.\"\n\n\"But yet--\"\n\n\"I will explain to you later, Porthos.\"\n\n\"I'll wager it is some piece of policy or other.\"\n\n\"And of the most subtle character,\" returned D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos nodded his head at this word policy; then, after a moment's\nreflection, he added, \"I confess, D'Artagnan, that I am no politician.\"\n\n\"I know that well.\"\n\n\"Oh! no one knows what you told me yourself, you, the bravest of the\nbrave.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you, Porthos?\"\n\n\"That every man has his day. You told me so, and I have experienced it\nmyself. There are certain days when one feels less pleasure than others\nin exposing one's self to a bullet or a sword-thrust.\"\n\n\"Exactly my own idea.\"\n\n\"And mine, too, although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that\nkill outright.\"\n\n\"The deuce! and yet you have killed a few in your time.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I have never been killed.\"\n\n\"Your reason is a very good one.\"\n\n\"Therefore, I do not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword\nor a gun-shot.\"\n\n\"In that case, then, you are afraid of nothing. Ah! water, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Oh! I swim like an otter.\"\n\n\"Of a quartan fever, then?\"\n\n\"I have never had one yet, and I don't believe I ever shall; but there\nis one thing I will admit,\" and Porthos dropped his voice.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked D'Artagnan, adopting the same tone of voice as\nPorthos.\n\n\"I must confess,\" repeated Porthos, \"that I am horribly afraid of\npolitics.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Upon my word, it's true,\" said Porthos, in a stentorian voice. \"I have\nseen his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu, and his eminence\nMonsieur le Cardinal de Mazarin; the one was a red politician, the other\na black politician; I never felt very much more satisfied with the one\nthan with the other; the first struck off the heads of M. de Marillac,\nM. de Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Chalais, M. de Bouteville, and M. de\nMontmorency; the second got a whole crowd of Frondeurs cut in pieces,\nand we belonged to them.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, we did not belong to them,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh! indeed, yes; for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal, I\nstruck it for the king.\"\n\n\"My good Porthos!\"\n\n\"Well, I have done. My dread of politics is such, that if there is any\nquestion of politics in the matter, I should greatly prefer to return to\nPierrefonds.\"\n\n\"You would be quite right, if that were the case. But with me, my dear\nPorthos, no politics at all, that is quite clear. You have labored hard\nin fortifying Belle-Isle; the king wished to know the name of the clever\nengineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you are\nmodest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes to put you\nunder a bushel. But I happen to seize hold of you; I make it known\nwho you are; I produce you; the king rewards you; and that is the only\npolicy I have to do with.\"\n\n\"And the only one I will have to do with either,\" said Porthos, holding\nout his hand to D'Artagnan.\n\nBut D'Artagnan knew Porthos's grasp; he knew that, once imprisoned\nwithin the baron's five fingers, no hand ever left it without being\nhalf-crushed. He therefore held out, not his hand, but his fist, and\nPorthos did not even perceive the difference. The servants talked a\nlittle with each other in an undertone, and whispered a few words,\nwhich D'Artagnan understood, but which he took very good care not to let\nPorthos understand. \"Our friend,\" he said to himself, \"was really and\ntruly Aramis's prisoner. Let us now see what the result will be of the\nliberation of the captive.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV. The Rat and the Cheese.\n\nD'Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as D'Artagnan had set out.\nWhen D'Artagnan, as he entered the shop of the Pilon d'Or, announced to\nPlanchet that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and\nas the plume in Porthos's hat made the wooden candles suspended over the\nfront jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the\ndelight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow. But the grocer\nhad a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times--a trait that\ncarries youth into old age. So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort of\ninternal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received Porthos with\nrespect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality. Porthos, who was a\nlittle cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social\ndifference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer, soon\nbegan to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and so many kind\nattentions in Planchet. He was particularly touched by the liberty which\nwas permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried\nfruits and preserves, into the sacks of nuts and almonds, and into the\ndrawers full of sweetmeats. So that, notwithstanding Planchet's pressing\ninvitations to go upstairs to the _entresol_, he chose as his favorite\nseat, during the evening which he had to spend at Planchet's house, the\nshop itself, where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose\ndetected. The delicious figs from Provence, filberts from the forest,\nTours plums, were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five\nconsecutive hours. His teeth, like millstones, cracked heaps of nuts,\nthe shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were\ntrampled by every one who went in and out of the shop; Porthos pulled\nfrom the stalk with his lips, at one mouthful, bunches of the rich\nMuscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom, half a pound of which\npassed at one gulp from his mouth to his stomach. In one of the corners\nof the shop, Planchet's assistants, huddled together, looked at each\nother without venturing to open their lips. They did not know who\nPorthos was, for they had never seen him before. The race of those\nTitans who had worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus,\nand Francis I. had already begun to disappear. They could hardly help\nthinking he might be the ogre of the fairy tale, who was going to turn\nthe whole contents of Planchet's shop into his insatiable stomach, and\nthat, too, without in the slightest degree displacing the barrels and\nchests that were in it. Cracking, munching, chewing, nibbling, sucking,\nand swallowing, Porthos occasionally said to the grocer:\n\n\"You do a very good business here, friend Planchet.\"\n\n\"He will very soon have none at all to do, if this sort of thing\ncontinues,\" grumbled the foreman, who had Planchet's word that he should\nbe his successor. In the midst of his despair, he approached Porthos,\nwho blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to\nthe shop itself. He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement\nwould distract his devouring ideas.\n\n\"What do you want, my man?\" asked Porthos, affably.\n\n\"I should like to pass you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Porthos, \"it does not trouble me in the least.\"\n\nAt the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband,\nlifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other\nside, smiling all the while with the same affable expression. As soon as\nPorthos had placed him on the ground, the lad's legs so shook under him\nthat he fell back upon some sacks of corks. But noticing the giant's\ngentleness of manner, he ventured again, and said:\n\n\"Ah, monsieur! pray be careful.\"\n\n\"What about?\" inquired Porthos.\n\n\"You are positively putting a fiery furnace into your body.\"\n\n\"How is that, my good fellow?\"\n\n\"All those things are very heating to the system!\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Raisins, nuts, and almonds.\"\n\n\"Yes; but if raisins, nuts, and almonds are heating--\"\n\n\"There is no doubt at all of it, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Honey is very cooling,\" said Porthos, stretching out his hand toward\na small barrel of honey which was open, and he plunged the scoop with\nwhich the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and swallowed a\ngood half-pound at one gulp.\n\n\"I must trouble you for some water now, my man,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"In a pail, monsieur?\" asked the lad, simply.\n\n\"No, in a water-bottle; that will be quite enough;\" and raising the\nbottle to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the\nbottle at a single draught.\n\nPlanchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem.\nHowever, a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in\nearly days, he feigned to be talking very earnestly with D'Artagnan, and\nincessantly repeated:--\"Ah! monsieur, what a happiness! what an honor!\"\n\n\"What time shall we have supper, Planchet?\" inquired Porthos, \"I feel\nhungry.\"\n\nThe foreman clasped his hands together. The two others got under the\ncounters, fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh.\n\n\"We shall only take a sort of snack here,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and when we\nget to Planchet's country-seat, we will have supper.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! so we are going to your country-house, Planchet,\" said Porthos;\n\"so much the better.\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me, monsieur le baron.\"\n\nThe \"monsieur le baron\" had a great effect upon the men, who detected\na personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. This\ntitle, too, reassured them. They had never heard that an ogre was ever\ncalled \"monsieur le baron\".\n\n\"I will take a few biscuits to eat on the road,\" said Porthos,\ncarelessly; and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge\npocket of his doublet.\n\n\"My shop is saved!\" exclaimed Planchet.\n\n\"Yes, as the cheese was,\" whispered the foreman.\n\n\"What cheese?\"\n\n\"The Dutch cheese, inside which a rat had made his way, and we found\nonly the rind left.\"\n\nPlanchet looked all round his shop, and observing the different articles\nwhich had escaped Porthos's teeth, he found the comparison somewhat\nexaggerated. The foreman, who remarked what was passing in his master's\nmind, said, \"Take care; he is not gone yet.\"\n\n\"Have you any fruit here?\" said Porthos, as he went upstairs to the\n_entresol_, where it had just been announced that some refreshment was\nprepared.\n\n\"Alas!\" thought the grocer, addressing a look at D'Artagnan full of\nentreaty, which the latter half understood.\n\nAs soon as they had finished eating they set off. It was late when the\nthree riders, who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at\nFontainebleau. The journey passed very agreeably. Porthos took a fancy\nto Planchet's society, because the latter was very respectful in his\nmanners, and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his\nwoods, and his rabbit-warrens. Porthos had all the taste and pride of\na landed proprietor. When D'Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest\nconversation, he took the opposite side of the road, and letting his\nbridle drop upon his horse's neck, separated himself from the whole\nworld, as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet. The moon shone\nsoftly through the foliage of the forest. The breezes of the open\ncountry rose deliciously perfumed to the horse's nostrils, and they\nsnorted and pranced along delightedly. Porthos and Planchet began to\ntalk about hay-crops. Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced\nyears of his life, he had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits\nfor commerce, but that his childhood had been passed in Picardy in the\nbeautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees, and where\nhe had played under the green apple-trees covered with red-cheeked\nfruit; he went on to say, that he had solemnly promised himself that as\nsoon as he should have made his fortune, he would return to nature, and\nend his days, as he had begun them, as near as he possibly could to the\nearth itself, where all men must sleep at last.\n\n\"Eh, eh!\" said Porthos; \"in that case, my dear Monsieur Planchet, your\nretirement is not far distant.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Why, you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon.\"\n\n\"Well, we are getting on pretty well, I must admit,\" replied Planchet.\n\n\"Come, tell me what is the extent of your ambition, and what is the\namount you intend to retire upon?\"\n\n\"There is one circumstance, monsieur,\" said Planchet, without answering\nthe question, \"which occasions me a good deal of anxiety.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" inquired Porthos, looking all round him as if in search of\nthe circumstance that annoyed Planchet, and desirous of freeing him from\nit.\n\n\"Why, formerly,\" said the grocer, \"you used to call me Planchet quite\nshort, and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar\nmanner than you do now.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly, I should have said so formerly,\" replied the\ngood-natured Porthos, with an embarrassment full of delicacy; \"but\nformerly--\"\n\n\"Formerly I was M. d'Artagnan's lackey; is not that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well if I am not quite his lackey, I am as much as ever I was his\ndevoted servant; and more than that, since that time--\"\n\n\"Well, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Since that time, I have had the honor of being in partnership with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos. \"What, has D'Artagnan gone into the grocery\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said D'Artagnan, whom these words had drawn out of his\nreverie, and who entered into the conversation with that readiness and\nrapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and body. \"It\nwas not D'Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet\nwho entered into a political affair with me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Planchet, with mingled pride and satisfaction, \"we\ntransacted a little business which brought me in a hundred thousand\nfrancs and M. d'Artagnan two hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Porthos, with admiration.\n\n\"So that, monsieur le baron,\" continued the grocer, \"I again beg you to\nbe kind enough to call me Planchet, as you used to do; and to speak\nto me as familiarly as in old times. You cannot possibly imagine the\npleasure it would give me.\"\n\n\"If that be the case, my dear Planchet, I will do so, certainly,\"\nreplied Porthos. And as he was quite close to Planchet, he raised\nhis hand, as if to strike him on the shoulder, in token of friendly\ncordiality; but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim,\nso that his hand fell on the crupper of Planchet's horse, instead; which\nmade the animal's legs almost give way.\n\nD'Artagnan burst out laughing, as he said, \"Take care, Planchet; for\nif Porthos begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he\ncaresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake. Porthos is still as\nstrong as ever, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Planchet, \"Mousqueton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron\nis very fond of him.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Porthos, with a sigh which made all the three horses\nrear; \"and I was only saying, this very morning, to D'Artagnan, how much\nI regretted him. But tell me, Planchet?\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur le baron, thank you.\"\n\n\"Good lad, good lad! How many acres of park have you got?\"\n\n\"Of park?\"\n\n\"Yes; we will reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts, monsieur?\" \"At your chateau.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur le baron, I have neither chateau, nor park, nor meadows,\nnor woods.\"\n\n\"What have you got, then?\" inquired Porthos, \"and why do you call it a\ncountry-seat?\"\n\n\"I did not call it a country-seat, monsieur le baron,\" replied Planchet,\nsomewhat humiliated, \"but a country-box.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! I understand. You are modest.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur le baron, I speak the plain truth. I have rooms for a\ncouple of friends, that's all.\"\n\n\"But in that case, whereabouts do your friends walk?\"\n\n\"In the first place, they can walk about the king's forest, which is\nvery beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know the forest is very fine,\" said Porthos; \"nearly as\nbeautiful as my forest at Berry.\"\n\nPlanchet opened his eyes very wide. \"Have you a forest of the same kind\nas the forest at Fontainebleau, monsieur le baron?\" he stammered out.\n\n\"Yes; I have two, indeed, but the one at Berry is my favorite.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"Because I don't know where it ends; and, also, because it is full of\npoachers.\"\n\n\"How can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you?\"\n\n\"Because they hunt my game, and I hunt them--which, in these peaceful\ntimes, is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small\nscale.\"\n\nThey had reached this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up,\nperceived the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau, the lofty\noutlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of the\nheavens; whilst, rising above the compact and irregularly formed mass\nof buildings, the pointed roofs of the chateau were clearly visible, the\nslates of which glistened beneath the light of the moon, like the scales\nof an immense fish. \"Gentlemen,\" said Planchet, \"I have the honor to\ninform you that we have arrived at Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\n\nChapter V. Planchet's Country-House.\n\nThe cavaliers looked up, and saw that what Planchet had announced to\nthem was true. Ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the\nRue de Lyon, on the opposite side of the hostelry of the Beau Paon.\nA high hedge of bushy elders, hawthorn, and wild hops formed an\nimpenetrable fence, behind which rose a white house, with a high tiled\nroof. Two of the windows, which were quite dark, looked upon the street.\nBetween the two, a small door, with a porch supported by a couple of\npillars, formed the entrance to the house. The door was gained by a step\nraised a little from the ground. Planchet got off his horse, as if he\nintended to knock at the door; but, on second thoughts, he took hold of\nhis horse by the bridle, and led it about thirty paces further on, his\ntwo companions following him. He then advanced about another thirty\npaces, until he arrived at the door of a cart-house, lighted by an\niron grating; and, lifting up a wooden latch, pushed open one of the\nfolding-doors. He entered first, leading his horse after him by the\nbridle, into a small courtyard, where an odor met them which revealed\ntheir close vicinity to a stable. \"That smells all right,\" said Porthos,\nloudly, getting off his horse, \"and I almost begin to think I am near my\nown cows at Pierrefonds.\"\n\n\"I have only one cow,\" Planchet hastened to say modestly.\n\n\"And I have thirty,\" said Porthos; \"or rather, I don't exactly know how\nmany I have.\"\n\nWhen the two cavaliers had entered, Planchet fastened the door behind\nthem. In the meantime, D'Artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual\nagility, inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian\nfeels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage, plucked a piece\nof honeysuckle with one hand, and of sweet-briar with the other. Porthos\nclawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into\nthe ground, and ate, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all: and\nPlanchet was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm peasant,\nwho was fast asleep in a shed, lying on a bed of moss, and dressed in\nan old stable suit of clothes. The peasant, recognizing Planchet, called\nhim \"the master,\" to the grocer's great satisfaction. \"Stable the horses\nwell, old fellow, and you shall have something good for yourself,\" said\nPlanchet.\n\n\"Yes, yes; fine animals they are too,\" said the peasant. \"Oh! they shall\nhave as much as they like.\"\n\n\"Gently, gently, my man,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we are getting on a little\ntoo fast. A few oats and a good bed--nothing more.\"\n\n\"Some bran and water for my horse,\" said Porthos, \"for it is very warm,\nI think.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, gentlemen,\" replied Planchet; \"Daddy Celestin is an\nold gendarme, who fought at Ivry. He knows all about horses; so come\ninto the house.\" And he led the way along a well-sheltered walk, which\ncrossed a kitchen-garden, then a small paddock, and came out into a\nlittle garden behind the house, the principal front of which, as we have\nalready noticed, faced the street. As they approached, they could\nsee, through two open windows on the ground floor, which led into a\nsitting-room, the interior of Planchet's residence. This room, softly\nlighted by a lamp placed on the table, seemed, from the end of the\ngarden, like a smiling image of repose, comfort, and happiness. In every\ndirection where the rays of light fell, whether upon a piece of old\nchina, or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness,\nor upon the weapons hanging against the wall, the soft light was softly\nreflected; and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or\nanother, agreeable to the eye. The lamp which lighted the room, whilst\nthe foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the\nwindow-frames, splendidly illuminated a damask table-cloth as white as\nsnow. The table was laid for two persons. Amber-colored wine sparkled\nin a long cut-glass bottle; and a large jug of blue china, with a silver\nlid, was filled with foaming cider. Near the table, in a high-backed\narmchair, reclined, fast asleep, a woman of about thirty years of age,\nher face the very picture of health and freshness. Upon her knees lay\na large cat, with her paws folded under her, and her eyes half-closed,\npurring in that significant manner which, according to feline habits,\nindicates perfect contentment. The two friends paused before the window\nin complete amazement, while Planchet, perceiving their astonishment,\nwas in no little degree secretly delighted at it.\n\n\"Ah! Planchet, you rascal,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I now understand your\nabsences.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! there is some white linen!\" said Porthos, in his turn, in a\nvoice of thunder. At the sound of this gigantic voice, the cat took\nflight, the housekeeper woke up with a start, and Planchet, assuming\na gracious air, introduced his two companions into the room, where the\ntable was already laid.\n\n\"Permit me, my dear,\" he said, \"to present to you Monsieur le Chevalier\nd'Artagnan, my patron.\" D'Artagnan took the lady's hand in his in the\nmost courteous manner, and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he\nwould have taken Madame's.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,\" added\nPlanchet. Porthos bowed with a reverence which Anne of Austria would\nhave approved of.\n\nIt was then Planchet's turn, and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady\nin question, not, however, until he had made a sign as if requesting\nD'Artagnan's and Porthos's permission, a permission as a matter of\ncourse frankly conceded. D'Artagnan complimented Planchet, and said,\n\"You are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable.\"\n\n\"Life, monsieur,\" said Planchet, laughing, \"is capital which a man ought\nto invest as sensibly as he possibly can.\"\n\n\"And you get very good interest for yours,\" said Porthos, with a burst\nof laughter like a peal of thunder.\n\nPlanchet turned to his housekeeper. \"You have before you,\" he said to\nher, \"the two gentlemen who influenced the greatest, gayest, grandest\nportion of my life. I have spoken to you about them both very\nfrequently.\"\n\n\"And about two others as well,\" said the lady, with a very decided\nFlemish accent.\n\n\"Madame is Dutch?\" inquired D'Artagnan. Porthos curled his mustache, a\ncircumstance which was not lost upon D'Artagnan, who noticed everything.\n\n\"I am from Antwerp,\" said the lady.\n\n\"And her name is Madame Getcher,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"You should not call her madame,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"Because it would make her seem older every time you call her so.\"\n\n\"Well, I call her Truchen.\"\n\n\"And a very pretty name too,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Truchen,\" said Planchet, \"came to me from Flanders with her virtue and\ntwo thousand florins. She ran away from a brute of a husband who was in\nthe habit of beating her. Being myself a Picard born, I was always\nvery fond of the Artesian women, and it is only a step from Artois to\nFlanders; she came crying bitterly to her godfather, my predecessor\nin the Rue des Lombards; she placed her two thousand florins in my\nestablishment, which I have turned to very good account, and which have\nbrought her in ten thousand.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Planchet.\"\n\n\"She is free and well off; she has a cow, a maid servant and old\nCelestin at her orders; she mends my linen, knits my winter stockings;\nshe only sees me every fortnight, and seems to make herself in all\nthings tolerably happy.\n\n\"And indeed, gentlemen, I _am_ very happy and comfortable,\" said\nTruchen, with perfect ingenuousness.\n\nPorthos began to curl the other side of his mustache. \"The deuce,\"\nthought D'Artagnan, \"can Porthos have any intentions in that quarter?\"\n\nIn the meantime Truchen had set her cook to work, had laid the table for\ntwo more, and covered it with every possible delicacy that could convert\na light supper into a substantial meal, a meal into a regular feast.\nFresh butter, salt beef, anchovies, tunny, a shopful of Planchet's\ncommodities, fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the\nriver, game from the forest--all the produce, in fact, of the province.\nMoreover, Planchet returned from the cellar, laden with ten bottles of\nwine, the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of\ndust which covered them. Porthos's heart began to expand as he said, \"I\nam hungry,\" and he sat himself beside Madame Truchen, whom he looked at\nin the most killing manner. D'Artagnan seated himself on the other side\nof her, while Planchet, discreetly and full of delight, took his seat\nopposite.\n\n\"Do not trouble yourselves,\" he said, \"if Truchen should leave the\ntable now and then during supper; for she will have to look after your\nbedrooms.\"\n\nIn fact, the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they\ncould hear, on the first floor above them, the creaking of the wooden\nbedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor. While this\nwas going on, the three men, Porthos especially, ate and drank\ngloriously,--it was wonderful to see them. The ten full bottles were ten\nempty ones by the time Truchen returned with the cheese. D'Artagnan\nstill preserved his dignity and self-possession, but Porthos had lost\na portion of his; and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious.\nD'Artagnan recommended a new descent into the cellar, and, as Planchet\nno longer walked with the steadiness of a well-trained foot-soldier,\nthe captain of the musketeers proposed to accompany him. They set off,\nhumming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening.\nTruchen remained behind at table with Porthos. While the two\nwine-bibbers were looking behind the firewood for what they wanted, a\nsharp report was heard like the impact of a pair of lips on a lady's\ncheek.\n\n\"Porthos fancies himself at La Rochelle,\" thought D'Artagnan, as they\nreturned freighted with bottles. Planchet was singing so loudly that\nhe was incapable of noticing anything. D'Artagnan, whom nothing ever\nescaped, remarked how much redder Truchen's left cheek was than her\nright. Porthos was sitting on Truchen's left, and was curling with both\nhis hands both sides of his mustache at once, and Truchen was looking at\nhim with a most bewitching smile. The sparkling wine of Anjou very soon\nproduced a remarkable effect upon the three companions. D'Artagnan had\nhardly strength enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up\nhis own staircase. Planchet was pulling Porthos along, who was following\nTruchen, who was herself jovial enough. It was D'Artagnan who found out\nthe rooms and the beds. Porthos threw himself into the one destined for\nhim, after his friend had undressed him. D'Artagnan got into his own\nbed, saying to himself, \"_Mordioux!_ I had made up my mind never to\ntouch that light-colored wine, which brings my early camp days back\nagain. Fie! fie! if my musketeers were only to see their captain in such\na state.\" And drawing the curtains of his bed, he added, \"Fortunately\nenough, though, they will not see me.\"\n\n\"The country is very amusing,\" said Porthos, stretching out his legs,\nwhich passed through the wooden footboard, and made a tremendous\ncrash, of which, however, no one in the house was capable of taking\nthe slightest notice. By two o'clock in the morning every one was fast\nasleep.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. Showing What Could Be Seen from Planchet's House.\n\nThe next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly. Truchen had\nclosed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the\nleaden-lidded eyes of her guests, like a kind, good housekeeper. It\nwas still perfectly dark, then, beneath Porthos's curtains and under\nPlanchet's canopy, when D'Artagnan, awakened by an indiscreet ray of\nlight which made its way through a peek-hole in the shutters, jumped\nhastily out of bed, as if he wished to be the first at a forlorn hope.\nHe took by assault Porthos's room, which was next to his own. The worthy\nPorthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder; in the dim\nobscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed, and\nhis swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet. D'Artagnan\nawoke Porthos, who rubbed his eyes in a tolerably good humor. In the\nmeantime Planchet was dressing himself, and met at their bedroom doors\nhis two guests, who were still somewhat unsteady from their previous\nevening's entertainment. Although it was yet very early, the whole\nhousehold was already up. The cook was mercilessly slaughtering in\nthe poultry-yard; Celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden.\nPorthos, brisk and lively as ever, held out his hand to Planchet's, and\nD'Artagnan requested permission to embrace Madame Truchen. The latter,\nto show that she bore no ill-will, approached Porthos, upon whom she\nconferred the same favor. Porthos embraced Madame Truchen, heaving an\nenormous sigh. Planchet took both his friends by the hand.\n\n\"I am going to show you over the house,\" he said; \"when we arrived last\nnight it was as dark as an oven, and we were unable to see anything;\nbut in broad daylight, everything looks different, and you will be\nsatisfied, I hope.\"\n\n\"If we begin by the view you have here,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that charms\nme beyond everything; I have always lived in royal mansions, you know,\nand royal personages have tolerably sound ideas upon the selection of\npoints of view.\"\n\n\"I am a great stickler for a good view myself,\" said Porthos. \"At my\nChateau de Pierrefonds, I have had four avenues laid out, and at the\nend of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the\nothers.\"\n\n\"You shall see _my_ prospect,\" said Planchet; and he led his two guests\nto a window.\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is the Rue de Lyon.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have two windows on this side, a paltry, insignificant view,\nfor there is always that bustling and noisy inn, which is a very\ndisagreeable neighbor. I had four windows here, but I bricked up two.\"\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nThey entered a corridor leading to the bedrooms, and Planchet pushed\nopen the outside blinds.\n\n\"Hollo! what is that out yonder?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"The forest,\" said Planchet. \"It is the horizon,--a thick line of green,\nwhich is yellow in the spring, green in the summer, red in the autumn,\nand white in the winter.\"\n\n\"All very well, but it is like a curtain, which prevents one seeing a\ngreater distance.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Planchet; \"still, one can see, at all events, everything\nthat intervenes.\"\n\n\"Ah, the open country,\" said Porthos. \"But what is that I see out\nthere,--crosses and stones?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is the cemetery,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Planchet; \"I assure you it is very curious. Hardly a\nday passes that some one is not buried there; for Fontainebleau is by no\nmeans an inconsiderable place. Sometimes we see young girls clothed in\nwhite carrying banners; at others, some of the town-council, or rich\ncitizens, with choristers and all the parish authorities; and then, too,\nwe see some of the officers of the king's household.\"\n\n\"I should not like that,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"There is not much amusement in it, at all events,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I assure you it encourages religious thoughts,\" replied Planchet.\n\n\"Oh, I don't deny that.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Planchet, \"we must all die one day or another, and\nI once met with a maxim somewhere which I have remembered, that the\nthought of death is a thought that will do us all good.\"\n\n\"I am far from saying the contrary,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"But,\" objected D'Artagnan, \"the thought of green fields, flowers,\nrivers, blue horizons, extensive and boundless plains, is not likely to\ndo us good.\"\n\n\"If I had any, I should be far from rejecting them,\" said Planchet; \"but\npossessing only this little cemetery, full of flowers, so moss-grown,\nshady, and quiet, I am contented with it, and I think of those who live\nin town, in the Rue des Lombards, for instance, and who have to listen\nto the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day, and to\nthe soulless tramp, tramp, tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand\nfoot-passengers.\"\n\n\"But living,\" said Porthos; \"living, remember that.\"\n\n\"That is exactly the reason,\" said Planchet, timidly, \"why I feel it\ndoes me good to contemplate a few dead.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that fellow Planchet is born a\nphilosopher as well as a grocer.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Planchet, \"I am one of those good-humored sort of men\nwhom Heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days,\nand of considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay\non earth.\"\n\nD'Artagnan sat down close to the window, and as there seemed to be\nsomething substantial in Planchet's philosophy, he mused over it.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" exclaimed Planchet, \"if I am not mistaken, we are going to\nhave a representation now, for I think I heard something like chanting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I hear singing too.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is only a burial of a very poor description,\" said Planchet,\ndisdainfully; \"the officiating priest, the beadle, and only one\nchorister boy, nothing more. You observe, messieurs, that the defunct\nlady or gentleman could not have been of very high rank.\"\n\n\"No; no one seems to be following the coffin.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos; \"I see a man.\"\n\n\"You are right; a man wrapped in a cloak,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"It's not worth looking at,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"I find it interesting,\" said D'Artagnan, leaning on the window-sill.\n\n\"Come, come, you are beginning to take a fancy to the place already,\"\nsaid Planchet, delightedly; \"it is exactly my own case. I was so\nmelancholy at first that I could do nothing but make the sign of the\ncross all day, and the chants were like so many nails being driven into\nmy head; but now, they lull me to sleep, and no bird I have ever seen\nor heard can sing better than those which are to be met with in this\ncemetery.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"this is beginning to get a little dull for me,\nand I prefer going downstairs.\"\n\nPlanchet with one bound was beside his guest, whom he offered to lead\ninto the garden.\n\n\"What!\" said Porthos to D'Artagnan, as he turned round, \"are you going\nto remain here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will join you presently.\"\n\n\"Well, M. D'Artagnan is right, after all,\" said Planchet: \"are they\nbeginning to bury yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, the grave-digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round\nthe bier. But, see, a woman has just entered the cemetery at the other\nend.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, quickly, \"leave me,\nleave me; I feel I am beginning already to be much comforted by my\nmeditations, so do not interrupt me.\"\n\nPlanchet left, and D'Artagnan remained, devouring with his eager gaze\nfrom behind the half-closed blinds what was taking place just before\nhim. The two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which\nthey carried the litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into\nthe open grave. At a few paces distant, the man with the cloak wrapped\nround him, the only spectator of this melancholy scene, was leaning\nwith his back against a large cypress-tree, and kept his face and person\nentirely concealed from the grave-diggers and the priests; the corpse\nwas buried in five minutes. The grave having been filled up, the priests\nturned away, and the grave-digger having addressed a few words to them,\nfollowed them as they moved away. The man in the mantle bowed as they\npassed him, and put a piece of gold into the grave-digger's hand.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" murmured D'Artagnan; \"it is Aramis himself.\"\n\nAramis, in fact, remained alone, on that side at least; for hardly had\nhe turned his head when a woman's footsteps, and the rustling of her\ndress, were heard in the path close to him. He immediately turned round,\nand took off his hat with the most ceremonious respect; he led the lady\nunder the shelter of some walnut and lime trees, which overshadowed a\nmagnificent tomb.\n\n\"Ah! who would have thought it,\" said D'Artagnan; \"the bishop of\nVannes at a rendezvous! He is still the same Abbe Aramis as he was\nat Noisy-le-Sec. Yes,\" he added, after a pause; \"but as it is in a\ncemetery, the rendezvous is sacred.\" But he almost laughed.\n\nThe conversation lasted for fully half an hour. D'Artagnan could not see\nthe lady's face, for she kept her back turned towards him; but he saw\nperfectly well, by the erect attitude of both the speakers, by their\ngestures, by the measured and careful manner with which they glanced\nat each other, either by way of attack or defense, that they must be\nconversing about any other subject than of love. At the end of the\nconversation the lady rose, and bowed profoundly to Aramis.\n\n\"Oh, oh,\" said D'Artagnan; \"this rendezvous finishes like one of a very\ntender nature though. The cavalier kneels at the beginning, the\nyoung lady by and by gets tamed down, and then it is she who has to\nsupplicate. Who is this lady? I would give anything to ascertain.\"\n\nThis seemed impossible, however, for Aramis was the first to leave;\nthe lady carefully concealed her head and face, and then immediately\ndeparted. D'Artagnan could hold out no longer; he ran to the window\nwhich looked out on the Rue de Lyon, and saw Aramis entering the inn.\nThe lady was proceeding in quite an opposite direction, and seemed, in\nfact, to be about to rejoin an equipage, consisting of two led horses\nand a carriage, which he could see standing close to the borders of\nthe forest. She was walking slowly, her head bent down, absorbed in the\ndeepest meditation.\n\n\"_Mordioux! Mordioux!_ I must and will learn who that woman is,\" said\nthe musketeer again; and then, without further deliberation, he set off\nin pursuit of her. As he was going along, he tried to think how he could\npossibly contrive to make her raise her veil. \"She is not young,\" he\nsaid, \"and is a woman of high rank in society. I ought to know that\nfigure and peculiar style of walk.\" As he ran, the sound of his spurs\nand of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange\njingling noise; a fortunate circumstance in itself, which he was far\nfrom reckoning upon. The noise disturbed the lady; she seemed to fancy\nshe was being either followed or pursued, which was indeed the case, and\nturned round. D'Artagnan started as if he had received a charge of small\nshot in his legs, and then turning suddenly round as if he were going\nback the same way he had come, he murmured, \"Madame de Chevreuse!\"\nD'Artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything. He asked\nCelestin to inquire of the grave-digger whose body it was they had\nburied that morning.\n\n\"A poor Franciscan mendicant friar,\" replied the latter, \"who had not\neven a dog to love him in this world, and to accompany him to his last\nresting-place.\"\n\n\"If that were really the case,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"we should not\nhave found Aramis present at his funeral. The bishop of Vannes is not\nprecisely a dog as far as devotion goes: his scent, however, is quite as\nkeen, I admit.\"\n\n\n\nChapter VII. How Porthos, Truchen, and Planchet Parted with Each Other\non Friendly Terms, Thanks to D'Artagnan.\n\nThere was good living in Planchet's house. Porthos broke a ladder and\ntwo cherry-trees, stripped the raspberry-bushes, and was only unable to\nsucceed in reaching the strawberry-beds on account, as he said, of his\nbelt. Truchen, who had become quite sociable with the giant, said that\nit was not the belt so much as his corporation; and Porthos, in a state\nof the highest delight, embraced Truchen, who gathered him a pailful of\nthe strawberries, and made him eat them out of her hands. D'Artagnan,\nwho arrived in the midst of these little innocent flirtations, scolded\nPorthos for his indolence, and silently pitied Planchet. Porthos\nbreakfasted with a very good appetite, and when he had finished, he\nsaid, looking at Truchen, \"I could make myself very happy here.\"\nTruchen smiled at his remark, and so did Planchet, but not without\nembarrassment.\n\nD'Artagnan then addressed Porthos: \"You must not let the delights of\nCapua make you forget the real object of our journey to Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"My presentation to the king?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I am going to take a turn in the town to get everything\nready for that. Do not think of leaving the house, I beg.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Porthos.\n\nPlanchet looked at D'Artagnan nervously.\n\n\"Will you be away long?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No, my friend; and this very evening I will release you from two\ntroublesome guests.\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur d'Artagnan! can you say--\"\n\n\"No, no; you are a noble-hearted fellow, but your house is very small.\nSuch a house, with half a dozen acres of land, would be fit for a king,\nand make him very happy, too. But you were not born a great lord.\"\n\n\"No more was M. Porthos,\" murmured Planchet.\n\n\"But he has become so, my good fellow; his income has been a hundred\nthousand francs a year for the last twenty years, and for the last fifty\nyears Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone,\nwhich are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of France.\nPorthos is a man of the very greatest consequence compared to you,\nand... well, I need say no more, for I know you are an intelligent\nfellow.\"\n\n\"No, no, monsieur, explain what you mean.\"\n\n\"Look at your orchard, how stripped it is, how empty your larder, your\nbedstead broken, your cellar almost exhausted, look too... at Madame\nTruchen--\"\n\n\"Oh! my goodness gracious!\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Madame Truchen is an excellent person,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"but\nkeep her for yourself, do you understand?\" and he slapped him on the\nshoulder.\n\nPlanchet at this moment perceived Porthos and Truchen sitting close\ntogether in an arbor; Truchen, with a grace of manner peculiarly\nFlemish, was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double\ncherry, while Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company\nof Delilah. Planchet pressed D'Artagnan's hand, and ran towards the\narbor. We must do Porthos the justice to say that he did not move as\nthey approached, and, very likely, he did not think he was doing any\nharm. Nor indeed did Truchen move either, which rather put Planchet out;\nbut he, too, had been so accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop,\nthat he found no difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed\ndisagreeable or rude. Planchet seized Porthos by the arm, and proposed\nto go and look at the horses, but Porthos pretended he was tired.\nPlanchet then suggested that the Baron du Vallon should taste some\nnoyeau of his own manufacture, which was not to be equaled anywhere; an\noffer the baron immediately accepted; and, in this way, Planchet managed\nto engage his enemy's attention during the whole of the day, by dint of\nsacrificing his cellar, in preference to his _amour propre_. Two hours\nafterwards D'Artagnan returned.\n\n\"Everything is arranged,\" he said; \"I saw his majesty at the very moment\nhe was setting off for the chase; the king expects us this evening.\"\n\n\"The king expects _me!_\" cried Porthos, drawing himself up. It is a sad\nthing to have to confess, but a man's heart is like an ocean billow;\nfor, from that very moment Porthos ceased to look at Madame Truchen\nin that touching manner which had so softened her heart. Planchet\nencouraged these ambitious leanings as best as he could. He talked over,\nor rather gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last\nreign, its battles, sieges, and grand court ceremonies. He spoke of the\nluxurious display which the English made; the prizes the three brave\ncompanions carried off; and how D'Artagnan, who at the beginning had\nbeen the humblest of the four, finished by becoming the leader. He fired\nPorthos with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his\nearly youth now passed away; he boasted as much as he could of the moral\nlife this great lord had led, and how religiously he respected the ties\nof friendship; he was eloquent, and skillful in his choice of subjects.\nHe tickled Porthos, frightened Truchen, and made D'Artagnan think. At\nsix o'clock, the musketeer ordered the horses to be brought round, and\ntold Porthos to get ready. He thanked Planchet for his kind hospitality,\nwhispered a few words about a post he might succeed in obtaining for\nhim at court, which immediately raised Planchet in Truchen's estimation,\nwhere the poor grocer--so good, so generous, so devoted--had become much\nlowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of the two\ngreat gentlemen. Such, however, is a woman's nature; they are anxious\nto possess what they have not got, and disdain it as soon as it is\nacquired. After having rendered this service to his friend Planchet,\nD'Artagnan said in a low tone of voice to Porthos: \"That is a very\nbeautiful ring you have on your finger.\"\n\n\"It is worth three hundred pistoles,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Madame Truchen will remember you better if you leave her that ring,\"\nreplied D'Artagnan, a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to\nadopt.\n\n\"You think it is not beautiful enough, perhaps,\" said the musketeer. \"I\nunderstand your feelings; a great lord such as you would not think of\naccepting the hospitality of an old servant without paying him most\nhandsomely for it: but I am sure that Planchet is too good-hearted a\nfellow to remember that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs\na year.\"\n\n\"I have more than half a mind,\" said Porthos, flattered by the remark,\n\"to make Madame Truchen a present of my little farm at Bracieux; it has\ntwelve acres.\"\n\n\"It is too much, my good Porthos, too much just at present... Keep it\nfor a future occasion.\" He then took the ring off Porthos's finger, and\napproaching Truchen, said to her:--\"Madame, monsieur le baron hardly\nknows how to entreat you, out of your regard for him, to accept this\nlittle ring. M. du Vallon is one of the most generous and discreet\nmen of my acquaintance. He wished to offer you a farm that he has at\nBracieux, but I dissuaded him from it.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Truchen, looking eagerly at the diamond.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron!\" exclaimed Planchet, quite overcome.\n\n\"My good friend,\" stammered out Porthos, delighted at having been so\nwell represented by D'Artagnan. These several exclamations, uttered at\nthe same moment, made quite a pathetic winding-up of a day which might\nhave finished in a very ridiculous manner. But D'Artagnan was there,\nand, on every occasion, wheresoever D'Artagnan exercised any control,\nmatters ended only just in the very way he wished and willed. There were\ngeneral embracings; Truchen, whom the baron's munificence had restored\nto her proper position, very timidly, and blushing all the while,\npresented her forehead to the great lord with whom she had been on such\nvery pretty terms the evening before. Planchet himself was overcome by\na feeling of genuine humility. Still, in the same generosity of\ndisposition, Porthos would have emptied his pockets into the hands of\nthe cook and of Celestin; but D'Artagnan stopped him.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"it is now my turn.\" And he gave one pistole to the woman\nand two to the man; and the benedictions which were showered down\nupon them would have rejoiced the heart of Harpagon himself, and have\nrendered even him a prodigal.\n\nD'Artagnan made Planchet lead them to the chateau, and introduced\nPorthos into his own apartment, where he arrived safely without having\nbeen perceived by those he was afraid of meeting.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. The Presentation of Porthos at Court.\n\nAt seven o'clock the same evening, the king gave an audience to an\nambassador from the United Provinces, in the grand reception-room. The\naudience lasted a quarter of an hour. His majesty afterwards received\nthose who had been recently presented, together with a few ladies, who\npaid their respects first. In one corner of the salon, concealed behind\na column, Porthos and D'Artagnan were conversing together, waiting until\ntheir turn arrived.\n\n\"Have you heard the news?\" inquired the musketeer of his friend.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Well, look, then.\" Porthos raised himself on tiptoe, and saw M. Fouquet\nin full court dress, leading Aramis towards the king.\n\n\"Aramis!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Presented to the king by M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Porthos.\n\n\"For having fortified Belle-Isle,\" continued D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And I?\"\n\n\"You--oh, you! as I have already had the honor of telling you, are the\ngood-natured, kind-hearted Porthos; and so they begged you to take care\nof Saint-Mande a little.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" repeated Porthos.\n\n\"But, happily, I was there,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and presently it will be\n_my_ turn.\"\n\nAt this moment Fouquet addressed the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" he said, \"I have a favor to solicit of your majesty. M.\nd'Herblay is not ambitious, but he knows when he can be of service. Your\nmajesty needs a representative at Rome, who would be able to exercise\na powerful influence there; may I request a cardinal's hat for M.\nd'Herblay?\" The king started. \"I do not often solicit anything of your\nmajesty,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"That is a reason, certainly,\" replied the king, who always expressed\nany hesitation he might have in that manner, and to which remark there\nwas nothing to say in reply.\n\nFouquet and Aramis looked at each other. The king resumed: \"M. d'Herblay\ncan serve us equally well in France; an archbishopric, for instance.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" objected Fouquet, with a grace of manner peculiarly his own,\n\"your majesty overwhelms M. d'Herblay; the archbishopric may, in your\nmajesty's extreme kindness, be conferred in addition to the hat; the one\ndoes not exclude the other.\"\n\nThe king admired the readiness which he displayed, and smiled, saying:\n\"D'Artagnan himself could not have answered better.\" He had no sooner\npronounced the name than D'Artagnan appeared.\n\n\"Did your majesty call me?\" he said.\n\nAramis and Fouquet drew back a step, as if they were about to retire.\n\n\"Will your majesty allow me,\" said D'Artagnan quickly, as he led forward\nPorthos, \"to present to your majesty M. le Baron du Vallon, one of the\nbravest gentlemen of France?\"\n\nAs soon as Aramis saw Porthos, he turned as pale as death, while Fouquet\nclenched his hands under his ruffles. D'Artagnan smiled blandly at\nboth of them, while Porthos bowed, visibly overcome before the royal\npresence.\n\n\"Porthos here?\" murmured Fouquet in Aramis's ear.\n\n\"Hush! deep treachery at work,\" hissed the latter.\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is more than six years ago I ought to have\npresented M. du Vallon to your majesty; but certain men resemble stars,\nthey move not one inch unless their satellites accompany them. The\nPleiades are never disunited, and that is the reason I have selected,\nfor the purpose of presenting him to you, the very moment when you would\nsee M. d'Herblay by his side.\"\n\nAramis almost lost countenance. He looked at D'Artagnan with a proud,\nhaughty air, as though willing to accept the defiance the latter seemed\nto throw down.\n\n\"Ah! these gentlemen are good friends, then?\" said the king.\n\n\"Excellent friends, sire; the one can answer for the other. Ask M. de\nVannes now in what manner Belle-Isle was fortified?\" Fouquet moved back\na step.\n\n\"Belle-Isle,\" said Aramis, coldly, \"was fortified by that gentleman,\"\nand he indicated Porthos with his hand, who bowed a second time.\nLouis could not withhold his admiration, though at the same time his\nsuspicions were aroused.\n\n\"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but ask monsieur le baron whose assistance he\nhad in carrying the works out?\"\n\n\"Aramis's,\" said Porthos, frankly; and he pointed to the bishop.\n\n\"What the deuce does all this mean?\" thought the bishop, \"and what sort\nof a termination are we to expect to this comedy?\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the king, \"is the cardinal's, I mean this bishop's,\nname _Aramis?_\"\n\n\"His _nom de guerre_,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"My nickname,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"A truce to modesty!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan; \"beneath the priest's robe,\nsire, is concealed the most brilliant officer, a gentleman of the most\nunparalleled intrepidity, and the wisest theologian in your kingdom.\"\n\nLouis raised his head. \"And an engineer, also, it appears,\" he said,\nadmiring Aramis's calm, imperturbable self-possession.\n\n\"An engineer for a particular purpose, sire,\" said the latter.\n\n\"My companion in the musketeers, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, with great\nwarmth of manner, \"the man who has more than a hundred times aided your\nfather's ministers by his advice--M. d'Herblay, in a word, who, with\nM. du Vallon, myself, and M. le Comte de la Fere, who is known to your\nmajesty, formed that quartette which was a good deal talked about during\nthe late king's reign, and during your majesty's minority.\"\n\n\"And who fortified Belle-Isle?\" the king repeated, in a significant\ntone.\n\nAramis advanced and bowed: \"In order to serve the son as I served the\nfather.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked very narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words,\nwhich displayed so much true respect, so much warm devotion, such entire\nfrankness and sincerity, that even he, D'Artagnan, the eternal doubter,\nhe, the almost infallible in judgment, was deceived by it. \"A man who\nlies cannot speak in such a tone as that,\" he said.\n\nLouis was overcome by it. \"In that case,\" he said to Fouquet, who\nanxiously awaited the result of this proof, \"the cardinal's hat is\npromised. Monsieur d'Herblay, I pledge you my honor that the first\npromotion shall be yours. Thank M. Fouquet for it.\" Colbert overheard\nthese words; they stung him to the quick, and he left the salon\nabruptly. \"And you, Monsieur du Vallon,\" said the king, \"what have you\nto ask? I am truly pleased to have it in my power to acknowledge the\nservices of those who were faithful to my father.\"\n\n\"Sire--\" began Porthos, but he was unable to proceed with what he was\ngoing to say.\n\n\"Sire,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"this worthy gentleman is utterly\noverpowered by your majesty's presence, he who so valiantly sustained\nthe looks and the fire of a thousand foes. But, knowing what his\nthoughts are, I--who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun--can\ntranslate them: he needs nothing, absolutely nothing; his sole desire\nis to have the happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of an\nhour.\"\n\n\"You shall sup with me this evening,\" said the king, saluting Porthos\nwith a gracious smile.\n\nPorthos became crimson from delight and pride. The king dismissed him,\nand D'Artagnan pushed him into the adjoining apartment, after he had\nembraced him warmly.\n\n\"Sit next to me at table,\" said Porthos in his ear.\n\n\"Yes, my friend.\"\n\n\"Aramis is annoyed with me, I think.\"\n\n\"Aramis has never liked you so much as he does now. Fancy, it was I who\nwas the means of his getting the cardinal's hat.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Porthos. \"By the by, does the king like his guests to\neat much at his table?\"\n\n\"It is a compliment to himself if you do,\" said D'Artagnan, \"for he\nhimself possesses a royal appetite.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IX. Explanations.\n\nAramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the purpose of finding\nD'Artagnan and Porthos. He came up to the latter, behind one of the\ncolumns, and, as he pressed his hand, said, \"So you have escaped from my\nprison?\"\n\n\"Do not scold him,\" said D'Artagnan; \"it was I, dear Aramis, who set him\nfree.\"\n\n\"Ah! my friend,\" replied Aramis, looking at Porthos, \"could you not have\nwaited with a little more patience?\"\n\nD'Artagnan came to the assistance of Porthos, who already began to\nbreathe hard, in sore perplexity.\n\n\"You see, you members of the Church are great politicians; we mere\nsoldiers come at once to the point. The facts are these: I went to pay\nBaisemeaux a visit--\"\n\nAramis pricked up his ears at this announcement.\n\n\"Stay!\" said Porthos; \"you make me remember that I have a letter from\nBaisemeaux for you, Aramis.\" And Porthos held out the bishop the letter\nwe have already seen. Aramis begged to be allowed to read it, and read\nit without D'Artagnan feeling in the slightest degree embarrassed by\nthe circumstance that he was so well acquainted with the contents of it.\nBesides, Aramis's face was so impenetrable, that D'Artagnan could not\nbut admire him more than ever; after he had read it, he put the letter\ninto his pocket with the calmest possible air.\n\n\"You were saying, captain?\" he observed.\n\n\"I was saying,\" continued the musketeer, \"that I had gone to pay\nBaisemeaux a visit on his majesty's service.\"\n\n\"On his majesty's service?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and, naturally enough, we talked about you and\nour friends. I must say that Baisemeaux received me coldly; so I soon\ntook my leave of him. As I was returning, a soldier accosted me, and\nsaid (no doubt as he recognized me, notwithstanding I was in private\nclothes), 'Captain, will you be good enough to read me the name written\non this envelope?' and I read, 'To Monsieur du Vallon, at M. Fouquet's\nhouse, Saint-Mande.' The deuce, I said to myself, Porthos has not\nreturned, then, as I fancied, to Bell-Isle, or to Pierrefonds, but is\nat M. Fouquet's house, at Saint-Mande; and as M. Fouquet is not at\nSaint-Mande, Porthos must be quite alone, or, at all events, with\nAramis; I will go and see Porthos, and I accordingly went to see\nPorthos.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Aramis, thoughtfully.\n\n\"You never told me that,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I had no time, my friend.\"\n\n\"And you brought back Porthos with you to Fontainebleau?\"\n\n\"Yes, to Planchet's house.\"\n\n\"Does Planchet live at Fontainebleau?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"Yes, near the cemetery,\" said Porthos, thoughtlessly.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'near the cemetery?'\" said Aramis, suspiciously.\n\n\"Come,\" thought the musketeer, \"since there is to be a squabble, let us\ntake advantage of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, the cemetery,\" said Porthos. \"Planchet is a very excellent fellow,\nwho makes very excellent preserves; but his house has windows which look\nout upon the cemetery. And a confoundedly melancholy prospect it is! So\nthis morning--\"\n\n\"This morning?\" said Aramis, more and more excited.\n\nD'Artagnan turned his back to them, and walked to the window, where he\nbegan to play a march upon one of the panes of glass.\n\n\"Yes, this morning we saw a man buried there.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Very depressing, was it not? I should never be able to live in a house\nwhere burials can always be seen from the window. D'Artagnan, on the\ncontrary, seems to like it very much.\"\n\n\"So D'Artagnan saw it as well?\"\n\n\"Not simply _saw_ it; he literally never took his eyes off the whole\ntime.\"\n\nAramis started, and turned to look at the musketeer, but the latter was\nengaged in earnest conversation with Saint-Aignan. Aramis continued to\nquestion Porthos, and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this\nenormous lemon, he threw the peel aside. He turned towards his friend\nD'Artagnan, and clapping him on the shoulder, when Saint-Aignan had left\nhim, the king's supper having been announced, said, \"D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear fellow,\" he replied.\n\n\"We do not sup with his majesty, I believe?\"\n\n\"Well?--_we_ do.\"\n\n\"Can you give me ten minutes' conversation?\"\n\n\"Twenty, if you like. His majesty will take quite that time to get\nproperly seated at table.\"\n\n\"Where shall we talk, then?\"\n\n\"Here, upon these seats if you like; the king has left, we can sit down,\nand the apartment is empty.\"\n\n\"Let us sit down, then.\"\n\nThey sat down, and Aramis took one of D'Artagnan's hands in his.\n\n\"Tell me, candidly, my dear friend, whether you have not counseled\nPorthos to distrust me a little?\"\n\n\"I admit, I have, but not as you understand it. I saw that Porthos was\nbored to death, and I wished, by presenting him to the king, to do for\nhim, and for you, what you would never do for yourselves.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Speak in your own praise.\"\n\n\"And you have done it most nobly; I thank you.\"\n\n\"And I brought the cardinal's hat a little nearer, just as it seemed to\nbe retreating from you.\"\n\n\"Ah! I admit that,\" said Aramis, with a singular smile, \"you are,\nindeed, not to be matched for making your friends' fortunes for them.\"\n\n\"You see, then, that I only acted with the view of making Porthos's\nfortune for him.\"\n\n\"I meant to have done that myself; but your arm reaches farther than\nours.\"\n\nIt was now D'Artagnan's turn to smile.\n\n\"Come,\" said Aramis, \"we ought to deal truthfully with each other. Do\nyou still love me, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"The same as I used to do,\" replied D'Artagnan, without compromising\nhimself too much by this reply.\n\n\"In that case, thanks; and now, for the most perfect frankness,\" said\nAramis; \"you visited Belle-Isle on behalf of the king?\"\n\n\"_Pardieu!_\"\n\n\"You wished to deprive us of the pleasure of offering Bell-Isle\ncompletely fortified to the king.\"\n\n\"But before I could deprive you of that pleasure, I ought to have been\nmade acquainted with your intention of doing so.\"\n\n\"You came to Belle-Isle without knowing anything?\"\n\n\"Of you! yes. How the devil could I imagine that Aramis had become\nso clever an engineer as to be able to fortify like Polybius, or\nArchimedes?\"\n\n\"True. And yet you smelt me out over yonder?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes.\"\n\n\"And Porthos, too?\"\n\n\"I did not divine that Aramis was an engineer. I was only able to guess\nthat Porthos might have become one. There is a saying, one becomes an\norator, one is born a poet; but it has never been said, one is born\nPorthos, and one becomes an engineer.\"\n\n\"Your wit is always amusing,\" said Aramis, coldly.\n\n\"Well, I will go on.\"\n\n\"Do. When you found out our secret, you made all the haste you could to\ncommunicate it to the king.\"\n\n\"I certainly made as much haste as I could, since I saw that you were\nmaking still more. When a man weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, as\nPorthos does, rides post; when a gouty prelate--I beg your pardon, but\nyou yourself told me you were so--when a prelate scours the highway--I\nnaturally suppose that my two friends, who did not wish to be\ncommunicative with me, had certain matters of the highest importance\nto conceal from me, and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the\nabsence of gout would allow.\"\n\n\"Did it not occur to you, my dear friend, that you might be rendering\nPorthos and myself a very sad service?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought it not unlikely; but you and Porthos made me play a very\nridiculous part at Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"So that,\" pursued Aramis, \"you now know everything?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"You know I was obliged to inform M. Fouquet of what had happened, in\norder that he would be able to anticipate what you might have to tell\nthe king?\"\n\n\"That is rather obscure.\"\n\n\"Not at all: M. Fouquet has his enemies--you will admit that, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And one in particular.\"\n\n\"A dangerous one?\"\n\n\"A mortal enemy. Well, in order to counteract that man's influence, it\nwas necessary that M. Fouquet should give the king a proof of his great\ndevotion to him, and of his readiness to make the greatest sacrifices.\nHe surprised his majesty by offering him Belle-Isle. If you had been the\nfirst to reach Paris, the surprise would have been destroyed, it would\nhave looked as if we had yielded to fear.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"That is the whole mystery,\" said Aramis, satisfied that he had at last\nquite convinced the musketeer.\n\n\"Only,\" said the latter, \"it would have been more simple to have\ntaken me aside, and said to me, 'My dear D'Artagnan, we are fortifying\nBelle-Isle, and intend to offer it to the king. Tell us frankly, for\nwhom you are acting. Are you a friend of M. Colbert, or of M. Fouquet?'\nPerhaps I should not have answered you, but you would have added,--'Are\nyou my friend?' I should have said 'Yes.'\" Aramis hung down his head.\n\"In this way,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"you would have paralyzed my\nmovements, and I should have gone to the king, and said, 'Sire, M.\nFouquet is fortifying Belle-Isle, and exceedingly well, too; but here is\na note, which the governor of Belle-Isle gave me for your majesty;' or,\n'M. Fouquet is about to wait upon your majesty to explain his intentions\nwith regard to it.' I should not have been placed in an absurd position;\nyou would have enjoyed the surprise so long planned, and we should not\nhave had any occasion to look askant at each other when we met.\"\n\n\"While, on the contrary,\" replied Aramis, \"you have acted altogether\nas one friendly to M. Colbert. And you really are a friend of his, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, indeed!\" exclaimed the captain. \"M. Colbert is a mean\nfellow, and I hate him as I used to hate Mazarin, but without fearing\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Aramis, \"I love M. Fouquet, and his interests are\nmine. You know my position. I have no property or means whatever. M.\nFouquet gave me several livings, a bishopric as well; M. Fouquet has\nserved and obliged me like the generous-hearted man he is, and I know\nthe world sufficiently well to appreciate a kindness when I meet with\none. M. Fouquet has won my regard, and I have devoted myself to his\nservice.\"\n\n\"You could not possibly do better. You will find him a very liberal\nmaster.\"\n\nAramis bit his lips; and then said, \"The best a man could possibly\nhave.\" He then paused for a minute, D'Artagnan taking good care not to\ninterrupt him.\n\n\"I suppose you know how Porthos got mixed up in all this?\"\n\n\"No,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I am curious, of course, but I never question a\nfriend when he wishes to keep a secret from me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will tell you.\"\n\n\"It is hardly worth the trouble, if the confidence is to bind me in any\nway.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not be afraid.; there is no man whom I love better than\nPorthos, because he is so simple-minded and good-natured. Porthos is\nso straightforward in everything. Since I have become a bishop, I have\nlooked for these primeval natures, which make me love truth and hate\nintrigue.\"\n\nD'Artagnan stroked his mustache, but said nothing.\n\n\"I saw Porthos and again cultivated his acquaintance; his own time\nhanging idly on his hands, his presence recalled my earlier and better\ndays without engaging me in any present evil. I sent for Porthos to come\nto Vannes. M. Fouquet, whose regard for me is very great, having\nlearnt that Porthos and I were attached to each other by old ties of\nfriendship, promised him increase of rank at the earliest promotion, and\nthat is the whole secret.\"\n\n\"I shall not abuse your confidence,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I am sure of that, my dear friend; no one has a finer sense of honor\nthan yourself.\"\n\n\"I flatter myself that you are right, Aramis.\"\n\n\"And now\"--and here the prelate looked searchingly and scrutinizingly\nat his friend--\"now let us talk of ourselves and for ourselves; will you\nbecome one of M. Fouquet's friends? Do not interrupt me until you know\nwhat that means.\"\n\n\"Well, I am listening.\"\n\n\"Will you become a marechal of France, peer, duke, and the possessor of\na duchy, with a million of francs?\"\n\n\"But, my friend,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"what must one do to get all\nthat?\"\n\n\"Belong to M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"But I already belong to the king.\"\n\n\"Not exclusively, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh! a D'Artagnan cannot be divided.\"\n\n\"You have, I presume, ambitions, as noble hearts like yours have.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly I have.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! I wish to be a marechal; the king will make me marechal, duke,\npeer; the king will make me all that.\"\n\nAramis fixed a searching look upon D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Is not the king master?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No one disputes it; but Louis XIII. was master also.\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear friend, between Richelieu and Louis XIII. stood no\nD'Artagnan,\" said the musketeer, very quietly.\n\n\"There are many stumbling-blocks round the king,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Not for the king's feet.\"\n\n\"Very likely not; still--\"\n\n\"One moment, Aramis; I observe that every one thinks of himself, and\nnever of his poor prince; I will maintain myself maintaining him.\"\n\n\"And if you meet with ingratitude?\"\n\n\"The weak alone are afraid of that.\"\n\n\"You are quite certain of yourself?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Still, the king may some day have no further need for you!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think his need of me will soon be greater than ever;\nand hearken, my dear fellow, if it became necessary to arrest a new\nConde, who would do it? This--this alone in France!\" and D'Artagnan\nstruck his sword, which clanked sullenly on the tesselated floor.\n\n\"You are right,\" said Aramis, turning very pale; and then he rose and\npressed D'Artagnan's hand.\n\n\"That is the last summons for supper,\" said the captain of the\nmusketeers; \"will you excuse me?\"\n\nAramis threw his arm round the musketeer's neck, and said, \"A\nfriend like you is the brightest jewel in the royal crown.\" And they\nimmediately separated.\n\n\"I was right,\" mused D'Artagnan; \"there is, indeed, something strangely\nserious stirring.\"\n\n\"We must hasten the explosion,\" breathed the coming cardinal, \"for\nD'Artagnan has discovered the existence of a plot.\"\n\n\n\nChapter X. Madame and De Guiche.\n\nIt will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the queen-mother's\napartments on the day when Louis XIV. presented La Valliere with the\nbeautiful bracelets he had won in the lottery. The comte walked to and\nfro for some time outside the palace, in the greatest distress, from\na thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his mind was beset.\nPresently he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of\ntrees, watching for Madame's departure. More than half an hour passed\naway; and as he was at that moment quite alone, the comte could hardly\nhave had any very diverting ideas at his command. He drew his tables\nfrom his pocket, and, after hesitating over and over again, determined\nto write these words:--\"Madame, I implore you to grant me one moment's\nconversation. Do not be alarmed at this request, which contains nothing\nin any way opposed to the profound respect with which I subscribe\nmyself, etc., etc.\" He had signed and folded this singular love-letter,\nwhen he suddenly observed several ladies leaving the chateau, and\nafterwards several courtiers too; in fact, almost every one that formed\nthe queen's circle. He saw La Valliere herself, then Montalais talking\nwith Malicorne; he watched the departure of the very last of the\nnumerous guests that had a short time before thronged the queen-mother's\ncabinet.\n\nMadame herself had not yet passed; she would be obliged, however, to\ncross the courtyard in order to enter her own apartments; and, from the\nterrace where he was standing, De Guiche could see all that was going on\nin the courtyard. At last he saw Madame leave, attended by a couple\nof pages, who were carrying torches before her. She was walking very\nquickly; as soon as she reached the door, she said:\n\n\"Let some one go and look for De Guiche: he has to render an account\nof a mission he had to discharge for me; if he should be disengaged,\nrequest him to be good enough to come to my apartment.\"\n\nDe Guiche remained silent, hidden in the shade; but as soon as Madame\nhad withdrawn, he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a\nmost indifferent air, so that the pages who were hurrying towards his\nrooms might meet him.\n\n\"Ah! it is Madame, then, who is seeking me!\" he said to himself, quite\novercome; and he crushed in his hand the now worse than useless letter.\n\n\"M. le comte,\" said one of the pages, approaching him, \"we are indeed\nmost fortunate in meeting you.\"\n\n\"Why so, messieurs?\"\n\n\"A command from Madame.\"\n\n\"From Madame!\" said De Guiche, looking surprised.\n\n\"Yes, M. le comte, her royal highness has been asking for you; she\nexpects to hear, she told us, the result of a commission you had to\nexecute for her. Are you at liberty?\"\n\n\"I am quite at her royal highness's orders.\"\n\n\"Will you have the goodness to follow us, then?\"\n\nWhen De Guiche entered the princess's apartments, he found her pale and\nagitated. Montalais was standing at the door, evidently uneasy about\nwhat was passing in her mistress's mind. De Guiche appeared.\n\n\"Ah! is that you, Monsieur de Guiche?\" said Madame; \"come in, I beg.\nMademoiselle de Montalais, I do not require your attendance any longer.\"\n\nMontalais, more puzzled than ever, courtesied and withdrew. De Guiche\nand the princess were left alone. The comte had every advantage in his\nfavor; it was Madame who had summoned him to a rendezvous. But how was\nit possible for the comte to make use of this advantage? Madame was so\nwhimsical, and her disposition so changeable. She soon allowed this to\nbe perceived, for, suddenly, opening the conversation, she said: \"Well!\nhave you nothing to say to me?\"\n\nHe imagined she must have guessed his thoughts; he fancied (for those\nwho are in love are thus constituted, being as credulous and blind as\npoets or prophets), he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see\nher, and also the subject uppermost in his mind.\n\n\"Yes, Madame,\" he said, \"and I think it very singular.\"\n\n\"The affair of the bracelets,\" she exclaimed, eagerly, \"you mean that, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"And you think the king is in love; do you not?\"\n\nGuiche looked at her for some time; her eyes sank under his gaze, which\nseemed to read her very heart.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that the king may possibly have had an idea of\nannoying some one; were it not for that, the king would hardly show\nhimself so earnest in his attentions as he is; he would not run the risk\nof compromising, from mere thoughtlessness of disposition, a young girl\nagainst whom no one has been hitherto able to say a word.\"\n\n\"Indeed! the bold, shameless girl,\" said the princess, haughtily.\n\n\"I can positively assure your royal highness,\" said De Guiche, with a\nfirmness marked by great respect, \"that Mademoiselle de la Valliere\nis beloved by a man who merits every respect, for he is a brave and\nhonorable gentleman.\"\n\n\"Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"My friend; yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"Well, and though he is your friend, what does that matter to the king?\"\n\n\"The king knows that Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la\nValliere; and as Raoul has served the king most valiantly, the king will\nnot inflict an irreparable injury upon him.\"\n\nMadame began to laugh in a manner that produced a sinister impression\nupon De Guiche.\n\n\"I repeat, Madame, I do not believe the king is in love with\nMademoiselle de la Valliere; and the proof that I do not believe it is,\nthat I was about to ask you whose _amour propre_ it is likely the king\nis desirous of wounding? You, who are well acquainted with the whole\ncourt, can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that; and assuredly, with\ngreater certainty, since it is everywhere said that your royal highness\nis on very friendly terms with the king.\"\n\nMadame bit her lips, and, unable to assign any good and sufficient\nreasons, changed the conversation. \"Prove to me,\" she said, fixing on\nhim one of those looks in which the whole soul seems to pass into the\neyes, \"prove to me, I say, that you intended to interrogate me at the\nvery moment I sent for you.\"\n\nDe Guiche gravely drew from his pocket the now crumpled note that he had\nwritten, and showed it to her.\n\n\"Sympathy,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the comte, with an indescribable tenderness of tone,\n\"sympathy. I have explained to you how and why I sought you; you,\nhowever, have yet to tell me, Madame, why you sent for me.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied the princess. She hesitated, and then suddenly\nexclaimed, \"Those bracelets will drive me mad.\"\n\n\"You expected the king would offer them to you,\" replied De Guiche.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"But before you, Madame, before you, his sister-in-law, was there not\nthe queen herself to whom the king should have offered them?\"\n\n\"Before La Valliere,\" cried the princess, wounded to the quick, \"could\nhe not have presented them to me? Was there not the whole court, indeed,\nto choose from?\"\n\n\"I assure you, Madame,\" said the comte, respectfully, \"that if any one\nheard you speak in this manner, if any one were to see how red your eyes\nare, and, Heaven forgive me, to see, too, that tear trembling on your\neyelids, it would be said that your royal highness was jealous.\"\n\n\"Jealous!\" said the princess, haughtily, \"jealous of La Valliere!\"\n\nShe expected to see De Guiche yield beneath her scornful gesture and her\nproud tone; but he simply and boldly replied, \"Jealous of La Valliere;\nyes, Madame.\"\n\n\"Am I to suppose, monsieur,\" she stammered out, \"that your object is to\ninsult me?\"\n\n\"It is not possible, Madame,\" replied the comte, slightly agitated, but\nresolved to master that fiery nature.\n\n\"Leave the room!\" said the princess, thoroughly exasperated, De Guiche's\ncoolness and silent respect having made her completely lose her temper.\n\nDe Guiche fell back a step, bowed slowly, but with great respect, drew\nhimself up, looking as white as his lace cuffs, and, in a voice slightly\ntrembling, said, \"It was hardly worth while to have hurried here to be\nsubjected to this unmerited disgrace.\" And he turned away with hasty\nsteps.\n\nHe had scarcely gone half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a\ntigress after him, seized him by the cuff, and making him turn round\nagain, said, trembling with passion as she did so, \"The respect you\npretend to have is more insulting than the insult itself. Insult me, if\nyou please, but at least speak.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the comte, gently, as he drew his sword, \"thrust this\nblade into my heart, rather than kill me by degrees.\"\n\nAt the look he fixed upon her,--a look full of love, resolution, and\ndespair, even,--she knew how readily the comte, so outwardly calm in\nappearance, would pass his sword through his own breast if she added\nanother word. She tore the blade from his hands, and, pressing his arm\nwith a feverish impatience, which might pass for tenderness, said, \"Do\nnot be too hard upon me, comte. You see how I am suffering, and yet you\nhave no pity for me.\"\n\nTears, the cries of this strange attack, stifled her voice. As soon as\nDe Guiche saw her weep, he took her in his arms and carried her to an\narmchair; in another moment she would have been suffocated.\n\n\"Oh, why,\" he murmured, as he knelt by her side, \"why do you conceal\nyour troubles from me? Do you love any one--tell me? It would kill me,\nI know, but not until I should have comforted, consoled, and served you\neven.\"\n\n\"And do you love me to that extent?\" she replied, completely conquered.\n\n\"I do indeed love you to that extent, Madame.\"\n\nShe placed both her hands in his. \"My heart is indeed another's,\" she\nmurmured in so low a tone that her voice could hardly be heard; but he\nheard it, and said, \"Is it the king you love?\"\n\nShe gently shook her head, and her smile was like a clear bright streak\nin the clouds, through which after the tempest has passed one almost\nfancies Paradise is opening. \"But,\" she added, \"there are other passions\nin a high-born heart. Love is poetry; but the real life of the heart is\npride. Comte, I was born on a throne, I am proud and jealous of my rank.\nWhy does the king gather such unworthy objects round him?\"\n\n\"Once more, I repeat,\" said the comte, \"you are acting unjustly towards\nthat poor girl, who will one day be my friend's wife.\"\n\n\"Are you simple enough to believe that, comte?\"\n\n\"If I did not believe it,\" he said, turning very pale, \"Bragelonne\nshould be informed of it to-morrow; indeed he should, if I thought that\npoor La Valliere had forgotten the vows she had exchanged with Raoul.\nBut no, it would be cowardly to betray a woman's secret; it would be\ncriminal to disturb a friend's peace of mind.\"\n\n\"You think, then,\" said the princess, with a wild burst of laughter,\n\"that ignorance is happiness?\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" he replied.\n\n\"Prove it to me, then,\" she said, hurriedly.\n\n\"It is easily done, Madame. It is reported through the whole court that\nthe king loves you, and that you return his affection.\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said, breathing with difficulty.\n\n\"Well; admit for a moment that Raoul, my friend, had come and said to\nme, 'Yes, the king loves Madame, and has made an impression upon her\nheart,' I possibly should have slain Raoul.\"\n\n\"It would have been necessary,\" said the princess, with the obstinacy of\na woman who feels herself not easily overcome, \"for M. de Bragelonne to\nhave had proofs before he ventured to speak to you in that manner.\"\n\n\"Such, however, is the case,\" replied De Guiche, with a deep sigh,\n\"that, not having been warned, I have never examined into the matter\nseriously; and I now find that my ignorance has saved my life.\"\n\n\"So, then, you drive selfishness and coldness to that extent,\" said\nMadame, \"that you would let this unhappy young man continue to love La\nValliere?\"\n\n\"I would, until La Valliere's guilt were revealed.\"\n\n\"But the bracelets?\"\n\n\"Well, Madame, since you yourself expected to receive them from the\nking, what can I possibly say?\"\n\nThe argument was a telling one, and the princess was overwhelmed by it,\nand from that moment her defeat was assured. But as her heart and\nmind were instinct with noble and generous feelings, she understood De\nGuiche's extreme delicacy. She saw that in his heart he really suspected\nthat the king was in love with La Valliere, and that he did not wish\nto resort to the common expedient of ruining a rival in the mind of\na woman, by giving the latter the assurance and certainty that this\nrival's affections were transferred to another woman. She guessed that\nhis suspicions of La Valliere were aroused, and that, in order to leave\nhimself time for his convictions to undergo a change, so as not to ruin\nLouise utterly, he was determined to pursue a certain straightforward\nline of conduct. She could read so much real greatness of character, and\nsuch true generosity of disposition in her lover, that her heart really\nwarmed with affection towards him, whose passion for her was so pure and\ndelicate. Despite his fear of incurring her displeasure, De Guiche, by\nretaining his position as a man of proud independence of feeling and\ndeep devotion, became almost a hero in her estimation, and reduced her\nto the state of a jealous and little-minded woman. She loved him for\nthis so tenderly, that she could not refuse to give him a proof of her\naffection.\n\n\"See how many words we have wasted,\" she said, taking his hand,\n\"suspicions, anxieties, mistrust, sufferings--I think we have enumerated\nall those words.\"\n\n\"Alas! Madame, yes.\"\n\n\"Efface them from your heart as I drive them from mine. Whether La\nValliere does or does not love the king, and whether the king does\nor does not love La Valliere--from this moment you and I will draw a\ndistinction in the two characters I have to perform. You open your eyes\nso wide that I am sure you hardly understand me.\"\n\n\"You are so impetuous, Madame, that I always tremble at the fear of\ndispleasing you.\"\n\n\"And see how he trembles now, poor fellow,\" she said, with the most\ncharming playfulness of manner. \"Yes, monsieur, I have two characters\nto perform. I am the sister of the king, the sister-in-law of the\nking's wife. In this character ought I not to take an interest in these\ndomestic intrigues? Come, tell me what you think?\"\n\n\"As little as possible, Madame.\"\n\n\"Agreed, monsieur; but it is a question of dignity; and then, you\nknow, I am the wife of the king's brother.\" De Guiche sighed. \"A\ncircumstance,\" she added, with an expression of great tenderness, \"which\nwill remind you that I am always to be treated with the profoundest\nrespect.\" De Guiche fell at her feet, which he kissed, with the\nreligious fervor of a worshipper. \"And I begin to think that, really and\ntruly, I have another character to perform. I was almost forgetting it.\"\n\n\"Name it, oh! name it,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"I am a woman,\" she said, in a voice lower than ever, \"and I love.\"\nHe rose, she opened her arms, and their lips met. A footstep was heard\nbehind the tapestry, and Mademoiselle de Montalais appeared.\n\n\"What do you want?\" said Madame.\n\n\"M. de Guiche is wanted,\" replied Montalais, who was just in time to see\nthe agitation of the actors of these four characters; for De Guiche had\nconsistently carried out his part with heroism.\n\n\n\nChapter XI. Montalais and Malicorne.\n\nMontalais was right. M. de Guiche, thus summoned in every direction, was\nvery much exposed, from such a multiplication of business, to the\nrisk of not attending to any. It so happened that, considering the\nawkwardness of the interruption, Madame, notwithstanding her wounded\npride, and secret anger, could not, for the moment at least, reproach\nMontalais for having violated, in so bold a manner, the semi-royal order\nwith which she had been dismissed on De Guiche's entrance. De Guiche,\nalso, lost his presence of mind, or, it would be more correct to say,\nhad already lost it, before Montalais's arrival, for, scarcely had he\nheard the young girl's voice, than, without taking leave of Madame, as\nthe most ordinary politeness required, even between persons equal in\nrank and station, he fled from her presence, his heart tumultuously\nthrobbing, and his brain on fire, leaving the princess with one hand\nraised, as though to bid him adieu. Montalais was at no loss, therefore,\nto perceive the agitation of the two lovers--the one who fled was\nagitated, and the one who remained was equally so.\n\n\"Well,\" murmured the young girl, as she glanced inquisitively round her,\n\"this time, at least, I think I know as much as the most curious\nwoman could possibly wish to know.\" Madame felt so embarrassed by this\ninquisitorial look, that, as if she heard Montalais's muttered side\nremark, she did not speak a word to her maid of honor, but, casting down\nher eyes, retired at once to her bedroom. Montalais, observing this,\nstood listening for a moment, and then heard Madame lock and bolt her\ndoor. By this she knew that the rest of the evening was at her own\ndisposal; and making, behind the door which had just been closed, a\ngesture which indicated but little real respect for the princess, she\nwent down the staircase in search of Malicorne, who was very busily\nengaged at that moment in watching a courier, who, covered with dust,\nhad just left the Comte de Guiche's apartments. Montalais knew that\nMalicorne was engaged in a matter of some importance; she therefore\nallowed him to look and stretch out his neck as much as he pleased; and\nit was only when Malicorne had resumed his natural position, that she\ntouched him on the shoulder. \"Well,\" said Montalais, \"what is the latest\nintelligence you have?\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche is in love with Madame.\"\n\n\"Fine news, truly! I know something more recent than that.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you know?\"\n\n\"That Madame is in love with M. de Guiche.\"\n\n\"The one is the consequence of the other.\"\n\n\"Not always, my good monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is that remark intended for me?\"\n\n\"Present company always excepted.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Malicorne. \"Well, and in the other direction, what is\nstirring?\"\n\n\"The king wished, this evening, after the lottery, to see Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Well, and he has seen her?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"The door was shut and locked.\"\n\n\"So that--\"\n\n\"So that the king was obliged to go back again, looking very sheepish,\nlike a thief who has forgotten his crowbar.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"And in the third place?\" inquired Montalais.\n\n\"The courier who has just arrived for De Guiche came from M. de\nBragelonne.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said Montalais, clapping her hands together.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because we have work to do. If we get weary now, something unlucky will\nbe sure to happen.\"\n\n\"We must divide the work, then,\" said Malicorne, \"in order to avoid\nconfusion.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" replied Montalais. \"Three intrigues, carefully nursed,\nand carefully encouraged, will produce, one with another, and taking a\nlow average, three love letters a day.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Malicorne, shrugging his shoulders, \"you cannot mean\nwhat you say, darling; three letters a day, that may do for sentimental\ncommon people. A musketeer on duty, a young girl in a convent, may\nexchange letters with their lovers once a day, perhaps, from the top\nof a ladder, or through a hole in the wall. A letter contains all the\npoetry their poor little hearts have to boast of. But the cases we have\nin hand require to be dealt with very differently.\"\n\n\"Well, finish,\" said Montalais, out of patience with him. \"Some one may\ncome.\"\n\n\"Finish! Why, I am only at the beginning. I have still three points as\nyet untouched.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, he will be the death of me, with his Flemish\nindifference,\" exclaimed Montalais.\n\n\"And you will drive me mad with your Italian vivacity. I was going to\nsay that our lovers here will be writing volumes to each other. But what\nare you driving at?\"\n\n\"At this. Not one of our lady correspondents will be able to keep the\nletters they may receive.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche will not be able to keep his either.\"\n\n\"That is probable.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; I will take care of all that.\"\n\n\"That is the very thing that is impossible,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because you are not your own mistress; your room is as much La\nValliere's as yours; and there are certain persons who will think\nnothing of visiting and searching a maid of honor's room; so that I am\nterribly afraid of the queen, who is as jealous as a Spaniard; of the\nqueen-mother, who is as jealous as a couple of Spaniards; and, last of\nall, of Madame herself, who has jealousy enough for ten Spaniards.\"\n\n\"You forgot some one else.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Monsieur.\"\n\n\"I was only speaking of the women. Let us add them up, then: we will\ncall Monsieur, No. 1.\"\n\n\"De Guiche?\"\n\n\"No. 2.\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"No. 3.\"\n\n\"And the king, the king?\"\n\n\"No. 4. Of course the king, who not only will be more jealous, but more\npowerful than all the rest put together. Ah, my dear!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Into what a wasp's nest you have thrust yourself!\"\n\n\"And as yet not quite far enough, if you will follow me into it.\"\n\n\"Most certainly I will follow you where you like. Yet--\"\n\n\"Well, yet--\"\n\n\"While we have time, I think it will be prudent to turn back.\"\n\n\"But I, on the contrary, think the wisest course to take is to put\nourselves at once at the head of all these intrigues.\"\n\n\"You will never be able to do it.\"\n\n\"With you, I could superintend ten of them. I am in my element, you must\nknow. I was born to live at the court, as the salamander is made to live\nin the fire.\"\n\n\"Your comparison does not reassure me in the slightest degree in the\nworld, my dear Montalais. I have heard it said, and by learned men too,\nthat, in the first place, there are no salamanders at all, and that, if\nthere had been any, they would have been infallibly baked or roasted on\nleaving the fire.\"\n\n\"Your learned men may be very wise as far as salamanders are concerned,\nbut they would never tell you what I can tell you; namely, that Aure\nde Montalais is destined, before a month is over, to become the first\ndiplomatist in the court of France.\"\n\n\"Be it so, but on condition that I shall be the second.\"\n\n\"Agreed; an offensive and defensive alliance, of course.\"\n\n\"Only be very careful of any letters.\"\n\n\"I will hand them to you as I receive them.\"\n\n\"What shall we tell the king about Madame?\"\n\n\"That Madame is still in love with his majesty.\"\n\n\"What shall we tell Madame about the king?\"\n\n\"That she would be exceedingly wrong not to humor him.\"\n\n\"What shall we tell La Valliere about Madame?\"\n\n\"Whatever we choose, for La Valliere is in our power.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Every way.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"In the first place, through the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"You do not forget, I hope, that Monsieur de Bragelonne has written many\nletters to Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"I forget nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it was I who received, and I who intercepted those\nletters.\"\n\n\"And, consequently, it is you who have them still?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where,--here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I have them safe at Blois, in the little room you know well\nenough.\"\n\n\"That dear little room,--that darling little room, the ante-chamber of\nthe palace I intend you to live in one of these days. But, I beg your\npardon, you said that all those letters are in that little room?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you not put them in a box?\"\n\n\"Of course; in the same box where I put all the letters I received from\nyou, and where I put mine also when your business or your amusements\nprevented you from coming to our rendezvous.\"\n\n\"Ah, very good,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Why are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Because I see there is a possibility of not having to run to Blois\nafter the letters, for I have them here.\"\n\n\"You have brought the box away?\"\n\n\"It was very dear to me, because it belonged to you.\"\n\n\"Be sure and take care of it, for it contains original documents that\nwill be of priceless value by and by.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly well aware of that indeed, and that is the very reason\nwhy I laugh as I do, and with all my heart, too.\"\n\n\"And now, one last word.\"\n\n\"Why _last?_\"\n\n\"Do we need any one to assist us?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"Valets or maid-servants?\"\n\n\"Bad policy. You will give the letters,--you will receive them. Oh!\nwe must have no pride in this affair, otherwise M. Malicorne and\nMademoiselle Aure, not transacting their own affairs themselves, will\nhave to make up their minds to see them done by others.\"\n\n\"You are quite right; but what is going on yonder in M. de Guiche's\nroom?\"\n\n\"Nothing; he is only opening his window.\"\n\n\"Let us be gone.\" And they both immediately disappeared, all the terms\nof the contract being agreed on.\n\nThe window just opened was, in fact, that of the Comte de Guiche. It\nwas not alone with the hope of catching a glimpse of Madame through her\ncurtains that he seated himself by the open window for his preoccupation\nof mind had at that time a different origin. He had just received, as\nwe have already stated, the courier who had been dispatched to him by\nBragelonne, the latter having written to De Guiche a letter which had\nmade the deepest impression upon him, and which he had read over and\nover again. \"Strange, strange!\" he murmured. \"How irresponsible are the\nmeans by which destiny hurries men onward to their fate!\" Leaving the\nwindow in order to approach nearer to the light, he once more read the\nletter he had just received:--\n\n\n\"CALAIS.\n\n\"MY DEAR COUNT,--I found M. de Wardes at Calais; he has been\nseriously wounded in an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. De Wardes\nis, as you know, unquestionably brave, but full of malevolent and wicked\nfeelings. He conversed with me about yourself, for whom, he says, he\nhas a warm regard, also about Madame, whom he considers a beautiful and\namiable woman. He has guessed your affection for a certain person. He\nalso talked to me about the lady for whom I have so ardent a regard, and\nshowed the greatest interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for\nme, accompanied, however, by dark hints which alarmed me at first, but\nwhich I at last looked upon as the result of his usual love of mystery.\nThese are the facts: he had received news of the court; you will\nunderstand, however, that it was only through M. de Lorraine. The report\ngoes, so says the news, that a change has taken place in the king's\naffections. You know whom that concerns. Afterwards, the news continues,\npeople are talking about one of the maids of honor, respecting whom\nvarious slanderous reports are being circulated. These vague phrases\nhave not allowed me to sleep. I have been deploring, ever\nsince yesterday, that my diffidence and vacillation of purpose,\nnotwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I may possess, have\nleft me unable to reply to these insinuations. In a word, M. de Wardes\nwas setting off for Paris, and I did not delay his departure with\nexplanations; for it seemed rather hard, I confess, to cross-examine a\nman whose wounds are hardly yet closed. In short, he travelled by short\nstages, as he was anxious to leave, he said, in order to be present at a\ncurious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer within a short time.\nHe added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague sympathizing\nexpressions. I could not understand the one any more than the other. I\nwas bewildered by my own thoughts, and tormented by a mistrust of this\nman,--a mistrust which, you know better than any one else, I have never\nbeen able to overcome. As soon as he left, my perceptions seemed\nto become clearer. It is hardly possible that a man of De Wardes's\ncharacter should not have communicated something of his own malicious\nnature to the statements he made to me. It is not unlikely, therefore,\nthat in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence, there may\nbe a mysterious signification, which I might have some difficulty in\napplying either to myself or to some one with whom you are acquainted.\nBeing compelled to leave as soon as possible, in obedience to the king's\ncommands, the idea did not occur to me of running after De Wardes in\norder to ask him to explain his reserve; but I have dispatched a courier\nto you with this letter, which will explain in detail my various doubts.\nI regard you as myself; you have reflected and observed; it will be for\nyou to act. M. de Wardes will arrive very shortly; endeavor to learn\nwhat he meant, if you do not already know. M. de Wardes, moreover,\npretended that the Duke of Buckingham left Paris on the very best of\nterms with Madame. This was an affair which would have unhesitatingly\nmade me draw my sword, had I not felt that I was under the necessity\nof dispatching the king's mission before undertaking any quarrel\nwhatsoever. Burn this letter, which Olivain will hand you. Whatever\nOlivain says, you may confidently rely on. Will you have the goodness,\nmy dear comte, to recall me to the remembrance of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, whose hands I kiss with the greatest respect.\n\n\"Your devoted\n\n\"DE BRAGELONNE.\n\n\"P. S.--If anything serious should happen--we should be prepared for\neverything, dispatch a courier to me with this one single word, 'come,'\nand I will be in Paris within six and thirty hours after the receipt of\nyour letter.\"\n\n\nDe Guiche sighed, folded up the letter a third time, and, instead of\nburning it, as Raoul had recommended him to do, placed it in his pocket.\nHe felt it needed reading over and over again.\n\n\"How much distress of mind, yet what sublime confidence, he shows!\"\nmurmured the comte; \"he has poured out his whole soul in this letter.\nHe says nothing of the Comte de la Fere, and speaks of his respect for\nLouise. He cautions me on my own account, and entreats me on his. Ah!\"\ncontinued De Guiche, with a threatening gesture, \"you interfere in my\naffairs, Monsieur de Wardes, do you? Very well, then; I will shortly\noccupy myself with yours. As for you, poor Raoul,--you who intrust your\nheart to my keeping, be assured I will watch over it.\"\n\nWith this promise, De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his\napartments, if possible. Malicorne acknowledged the invitation with an\nactivity which was the first result of his conversation with Montalais.\nAnd while De Guiche, who thought that his motive was undiscovered,\ncross-examined Malicorne, the latter, who appeared to be working in the\ndark, soon guessed his questioner's motives. The consequence was,\nthat, after a quarter of an hour's conversation, during which De Guiche\nthought he had ascertained the whole truth with regard to La Valliere\nand the king, he had learned absolutely nothing more than his own eyes\nhad already acquainted him with, while Malicorne learned, or guessed,\nthat Raoul, who was absent, was fast becoming suspicious, and that De\nGuiche intended to watch over the treasure of the Hesperides. Malicorne\naccepted the office of dragon. De Guiche fancied he had done everything\nfor his friend, and soon began to think of nothing but his personal\naffairs. The next evening, De Wardes's return and first appearance at\nthe king's reception were announced. When that visit had been paid, the\nconvalescent waited on Monsieur; De Guiche taking care, however, to be\nat Monsieur's apartments before the visit took place.\n\n\n\nChapter XII. How De Wardes Was Received at Court.\n\nMonsieur had received De Wardes with that marked favor light and\nfrivolous minds bestow on every novelty that comes in their way. De\nWardes, who had been absent for a month, was like fresh fruit to him.\nTo treat him with marked kindness was an infidelity to old friends, and\nthere is always something fascinating in that; moreover, it was a sort\nof reparation to De Wardes himself. Nothing, consequently, could exceed\nthe favorable notice Monsieur took of him. The Chevalier de Lorraine,\nwho feared this rival but a little, but who respected a character and\ndisposition only too parallel to his own in every particular, with the\naddition of a bull-dog courage he did not himself possess, received De\nWardes with a greater display of regard and affection than even Monsieur\nhad done. De Guiche, as we have said, was there also, but kept in the\nbackground, waiting very patiently until all these interchanges were\nover. De Wardes, while talking to the others, and even to Monsieur\nhimself, had not for a moment lost sight of De Guiche, who, he\ninstinctively felt, was there on his account. As soon as he had finished\nwith the others, he went up to De Guiche. They exchanged the most\ncourteous compliments, after which De Wardes returned to Monsieur and\nthe other gentlemen.\n\nIn the midst of these congratulations Madame was announced. She had\nbeen informed of De Wardes's arrival, and knowing all the details of his\nvoyage and duel, she was not sorry to be present at the remarks she\nknew would be made, without delay, by one who, she felt assured, was her\npersonal enemy. Two or three of her ladies accompanied her. De Wardes\nsaluted Madame in the most graceful and respectful manner, and, as a\ncommencement of hostilities, announced, in the first place, that he\ncould furnish the Duke of Buckingham's friends with the latest news\nabout him. This was a direct answer to the coldness with which Madame\nhad received him. The attack was a vigorous one, and Madame felt the\nblow, but without appearing to have even noticed it. He rapidly cast a\nglance at Monsieur and at De Guiche,--the former colored, and the latter\nturned very pale. Madame alone preserved an unmoved countenance; but,\nas she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and feelings her enemy could\nawaken in the two persons who were listening to him, she smilingly\nbent forward towards the traveler, as if to listen to the news he had\nbrought--but he was speaking of other matters. Madame was brave, even to\nimprudence; if she were to retreat, it would be inviting an attack; so,\nafter the first disagreeable impression had passed away, she returned to\nthe charge.\n\n\"Have you suffered much from your wounds, Monsieur de Wardes?\" she\ninquired, \"for we have been told that you had the misfortune to get\nwounded.\"\n\nIt was now De Wardes's turn to wince; he bit his lips, and replied, \"No,\nMadame, hardly at all.\"\n\n\"Indeed! and yet in this terribly hot weather--\"\n\n\"The sea-breezes were very fresh and cool, Madame, and then I had one\nconsolation.\"\n\n\"Indeed! What was it?\"\n\n\"The knowledge that my adversary's sufferings were still greater than my\nown.\"\n\n\"Ah! you mean he was more seriously wounded than you were; I was not\naware of that,\" said the princess, with utter indifference.\n\n\"Oh, Madame, you are mistaken, or rather you pretend to misunderstand\nmy remark. I did not say that he was a greater sufferer in body than\nmyself; but his heart was very seriously affected.\"\n\nDe Guiche comprehended instinctively from what direction the struggle\nwas approaching; he ventured to make a sign to Madame, as if entreating\nher to retire from the contest. But she, without acknowledging De\nGuiche's gesture, without pretending to have noticed it even, and still\nsmiling, continued:\n\n\"Is it possible,\" she said, \"that the Duke of Buckingham's heart was\ntouched? I had no idea, until now, that a heart-wound could be cured.\"\n\n\"Alas! Madame,\" replied De Wardes, politely, \"every woman believes that;\nand it is this belief that gives them that superiority to man which\nconfidence begets.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand altogether, dearest,\" said the prince, impatiently;\n\"M. de Wardes means that the Duke of Buckingham's heart had been\ntouched, not by the sword, but by something sharper.\"\n\n\"Ah! very good, very good!\" exclaimed Madame. \"It is a jest of M. de\nWardes's. Very good; but I should like to know if the Duke of Buckingham\nwould appreciate the jest. It is, indeed, a very great pity he is not\nhere, M. de Wardes.\"\n\nThe young man's eyes seemed to flash fire. \"Oh!\" he said, as he clenched\nhis teeth, \"there is nothing I should like better.\"\n\nDe Guiche did not move. Madame seemed to expect that he would come to\nher assistance. Monsieur hesitated. The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced\nand continued the conversation.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"De Wardes knows perfectly well that for a\nBuckingham's heart to be touched is nothing new, and what he has said\nhas already taken place.\"\n\n\"Instead of an ally, I have two enemies,\" murmured Madame; \"two\ndetermined enemies, and in league with each other.\" And she changed the\nconversation. To change the conversation is, as every one knows, a\nright possessed by princes which etiquette requires all to respect. The\nremainder of the conversation was moderate enough in tone; the principal\nactors had rehearsed their parts. Madame withdrew easily, and Monsieur,\nwho wished to question her on several matters, offered her his hand on\nleaving. The chevalier was seriously afraid that an understanding might\nbe established between the husband and wife if he were to leave them\nquietly together. He therefore made his way to Monsieur's apartments, in\norder to surprise him on his return, and to destroy with a few words all\nthe good impressions Madame might have been able to sow in his heart. De\nGuiche advanced towards De Wardes, who was surrounded by a large number\nof persons, and thereby indicated his wish to converse with him; De\nWardes, at the same time, showing by his looks and by a movement of his\nhead that he perfectly understood him. There was nothing in these signs\nto enable strangers to suppose they were otherwise than upon the most\nfriendly footing. De Guiche could therefore turn away from him, and wait\nuntil he was at liberty. He had not long to wait; for De Wardes,\nfreed from his questioners, approached De Guiche, and after a fresh\nsalutation, they walked side by side together.\n\n\"You have made a good impression since your return, my dear De Wardes,\"\nsaid the comte.\n\n\"Excellent, as you see.\"\n\n\"And your spirits are just as lively as ever?\"\n\n\"Better.\"\n\n\"And a very great happiness, too.\"\n\n\"Why not? Everything is so ridiculous in this world, everything so\nabsurd around us.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"You are of my opinion, then?\"\n\n\"I should think so! And what news do you bring us from yonder?\"\n\n\"I? None at all. I have come to look for news here.\"\n\n\"But, tell me, you surely must have seen some people at Boulogne, one of\nour friends, for instance; it is no great time ago.\"\n\n\"Some people--one of our friends--\"\n\n\"Your memory is short.\"\n\n\"Ah! true; Bragelonne, you mean.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"Who was on his way to fulfil a mission, with which he was intrusted to\nKing Charles II.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Well, then, did he not tell you, or did not you tell him--\"\n\n\"I do not precisely know what I told him, I must confess: but I do know\nwhat I did _not_ tell him.\" De Wardes was _finesse_ itself. He\nperfectly well knew from De Guiche's tone and manner, which was cold\nand dignified, that the conversation was about to assume a disagreeable\nturn. He resolved to let it take what course it pleased, and to keep\nstrictly on his guard.\n\n\"May I ask you what you did not tell him?\" inquired De Guiche.\n\n\"All about La Valliere.\"\n\n\"La Valliere... What is it? and what was that strange circumstance you\nseem to have known over yonder, which Bragelonne, who was here on the\nspot, was not acquainted with?\"\n\n\"Do you really ask me that in a serious manner?\"\n\n\"Nothing more so.\"\n\n\"What! you, a member of the court, living in Madame's household, a\nfriend of Monsieur's, a guest at their table, the favorite of our lovely\nprincess?\"\n\nGuiche colored violently from anger. \"What princess are you alluding\nto?\" he said.\n\n\"I am only acquainted with one, my dear fellow. I am speaking of Madame\nherself. Are you devoted to another princess, then? Come, tell me.\"\n\nDe Guiche was on the point of launching out, but he saw the drift of\nthe remark. A quarrel was imminent between the two young men. De Wardes\nwished the quarrel to be only in Madame's name, while De Guiche would\nnot accept it except on La Valliere's account. From this moment, it\nbecame a series of feigned attacks, which would have continued until one\nof the two had been touched home. De Guiche therefore resumed all the\nself-possession he could command.\n\n\"There is not the slightest question in the world of Madame in this\nmatter, my dear De Wardes.\" said Guiche, \"but simply of what you were\ntalking about just now.\"\n\n\"What was I saying?\"\n\n\"That you had concealed certain things from Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Certain things which you know as well as I do,\" replied De Wardes.\n\n\"No, upon my honor.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"If you tell me what they are, I shall know, but not otherwise, I\nswear.\"\n\n\"What! I who have just arrived from a distance of sixty leagues, and you\nwho have not stirred from this place, who have witnessed with your\nown eyes that which rumor informed me of at Calais! Do you now tell\nme seriously that you do not know what it is about? Oh! comte, this is\nhardly charitable of you.\"\n\n\"As you like, De Wardes; but I again repeat, I know nothing.\"\n\n\"You are truly discreet--well!--perhaps it is very prudent of you.\"\n\n\"And so you will not tell me anything, will not tell me any more than\nyou told Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"You are pretending to be deaf, I see. I am convinced that Madame could\nnot possibly have more command over herself than _you_ have.\"\n\n\"Double hypocrite,\" murmured Guiche to himself, \"you are again returning\nto the old subject.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" continued De Wardes, \"since we find it so difficult\nto understand each other about La Valliere and Bragelonne let us speak\nabout your own affairs.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said De Guiche, \"I have no affairs of my own to talk about. You\nhave not said anything about me, I suppose, to Bragelonne, which you\ncannot repeat to my face?\"\n\n\"No; but understand me, Guiche, that however much I may be ignorant of\ncertain matters, I am quite as conversant with others. If, for instance,\nwe were conversing about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at\nParis, as I did during my journey with the duke, I could tell you a\ngreat many interesting circumstances. Would you like me to mention\nthem?\"\n\nDe Guiche passed his hand across his forehead, which was covered\nin perspiration. \"No, no,\" he said, \"a hundred times no! I have no\ncuriosity for matters which do not concern me. The Duke of Buckingham\nis for me nothing more than a simple acquaintance, whilst Raoul is\nan intimate friend. I have not the slightest curiosity to learn what\nhappened to the duke, while I have, on the contrary, the greatest\ninterest in all that happened to Raoul.\"\n\n\"In Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes, in Paris, or Boulogne. You understand I am on the spot; if\nanything should happen, I am here to meet it; whilst Raoul is absent,\nand has only myself to represent him; so, Raoul's affairs before my\nown.\"\n\n\"But he will return?\"\n\n\"Not, however, until his mission is completed. In the meantime, you\nunderstand, evil reports cannot be permitted to circulate about him\nwithout my looking into them.\"\n\n\"And for a better reason still, that he will remain some time in\nLondon,\" said De Wardes, chuckling.\n\n\"You think so,\" said De Guiche, simply.\n\n\"Think so, indeed! do you suppose he was sent to London for no other\npurpose than to go there and return again immediately? No, no; he was\nsent to London to remain there.\"\n\n\"Ah! De Wardes,\" said De Guiche, grasping De Wardes's hand, \"that is a\nvery serious suspicion concerning Bragelonne, which completely confirms\nwhat he wrote to me from Boulogne.\"\n\nDe Wardes resumed his former coldness of manner: his love of raillery\nhad led him too far, and by his own imprudence, he had laid himself open\nto attack.\n\n\"Well, tell me, what did he write to you about?\" he inquired.\n\n\"He told me that you had artfully insinuated some injurious remarks\nagainst La Valliere, and that you had seemed to laugh at his great\nconfidence in that young girl.\"\n\n\"Well, it is perfectly true I did so,\" said De Wardes, \"and I was quite\nready, at the time, to hear from the Vicomte de Bragelonne that which\nevery man expects from another whenever anything may have been said\nto displease him. In the same way, for instance, if I were seeking a\nquarrel with you, I should tell you that Madame after having shown\nthe greatest preference for the Duke of Buckingham, is at this moment\nsupposed to have sent the handsome duke away for your benefit.\"\n\n\"Oh! that would not wound me in the slightest degree, my dear De\nWardes,\" said De Guiche, smiling, notwithstanding the shiver that\nran through his whole frame. \"Why, such a favor would be too great a\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"I admit that, but if I absolutely wished to quarrel with you, I should\ntry and invent a falsehood, perhaps, and speak to you about a certain\narbor, where you and that illustrious princess were together--I should\nspeak also of certain gratifications, of certain kissings of the hand;\nand you who are so secret on all occasions, so hasty, so punctilious--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said De Guiche, interrupting him, with a smile upon his lips,\nalthough he almost felt as if he were going to die; \"I swear I should\nnot care for that, nor should I in any way contradict you; for you must\nknow, my dear marquis, that for all matters which concern myself I am a\nblock of ice; but it is a very different thing when an absent friend\nis concerned, a friend, who, on leaving, confided his interests to my\nsafe-keeping; for such a friend, De Wardes, believe me, I am like fire\nitself.\"\n\n\"I understand you, Monsieur de Guiche. In spite of what you say, there\ncannot be any question between us, just now, either of Bragelonne or of\nthis insignificant girl, whose name is La Valliere.\"\n\nAt this moment some of the younger courtiers were crossing the\napartment, and having already heard the few words which had just been\npronounced, were able also to hear those which were about to follow. De\nWardes observed this, and continued aloud:--\"Oh! if La Valliere were a\ncoquette like Madame, whose innocent flirtations, I am sure, were, first\nof all, the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to England,\nand afterwards were the reason of your being sent into exile; for you\nwill not deny, I suppose, that Madame's pretty ways really had a certain\ninfluence over you?\"\n\nThe courtiers drew nearer to the speakers, Saint-Aignan at their head,\nand then Manicamp.\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, whose fault was that?\" said De Guiche, laughing.\n\"I am a vain, conceited fellow, I know, and everybody else knows it too.\nI took seriously that which was only intended as a jest, and got myself\nexiled for my pains. But I saw my error. I overcame my vanity, and I\nobtained my recall, by making the _amende honorable_, and by promising\nmyself to overcome this defect; and the consequence is, that I am so\nthoroughly cured, that I now laugh at the very thing which, three or\nfour days ago, would have almost broken my heart. But Raoul is in love,\nand is loved in return; he cannot laugh at the reports which disturb his\nhappiness--reports which you seem to have undertaken to interpret, when\nyou know, marquis, as I do, as these gentlemen do, as every one does in\nfact, that all such reports are pure calumny.\"\n\n\"Calumny!\" exclaimed De Wardes, furious at seeing himself caught in the\nsnare by De Guiche's coolness of temper.\n\n\"Certainly--calumny. Look at this letter from him, in which he tells me\nyou have spoken ill of Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and where he asks\nme, if what you reported about this young girl is true or not. Do you\nwish me to appeal to these gentlemen, De Wardes, to decide?\" And with\nadmirable coolness, De Guiche read aloud the paragraph of the letter\nwhich referred to La Valliere. \"And now,\" continued De Guiche, \"there\nis no doubt in the world, as far as I am concerned, that you wished\nto disturb Bragelonne's peace of mind, and that your remarks were\nmaliciously intended.\"\n\nDe Wardes looked round him, to see if he could find support from any\none; but, at the idea that De Wardes had insulted, either directly or\nindirectly, the idol of the day, every one shook his head; and De Wardes\nsaw that he was in the wrong.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said De Guiche, intuitively divining the general feeling,\n\"my discussion with Monsieur de Wardes refers to a subject so delicate\nin its nature, that it is most important no one should hear more than\nyou have already heard. Close the doors, then, I beg you, and let us\nfinish our conversation in the manner which becomes two gentlemen, one\nof whom has given the other the lie.\"\n\n\"Messieurs, messieurs!\" exclaimed those who were present.\n\n\"Is it your opinion, then, that I was wrong in defending Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere?\" said De Guiche. \"In that case, I pass judgment upon\nmyself, and am ready to withdraw the offensive words I may have used to\nMonsieur de Wardes.\"\n\n\"The deuce! certainly not!\" said Saint-Aignan. \"Mademoiselle de la\nValliere is an angel.\"\n\n\"Virtue and purity itself,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"You see, Monsieur de Wardes,\" said De Guiche, \"I am not the only one\nwho undertakes the defense of that poor girl. I entreat you, therefore,\nmessieurs, a second time, to leave us. You see, it is impossible we\ncould be more calm and composed than we are.\"\n\nIt was the very thing the courtiers wished; some went out at one door,\nand the rest at the other, and the two young men were left alone.\n\n\"Well played,\" said De Wardes, to the comte.\n\n\"Was it not?\" replied the latter.\n\n\"How can it be wondered at, my dear fellow; I have got quite rusty in\nthe country, while the command you have acquired over yourself, comte,\nconfounds me; a man always gains something in women's society; so, pray\naccept my congratulations.\"\n\n\"I do accept them.\"\n\n\"And I will make Madame a present of them.\"\n\n\"And now, my dear Monsieur de Wardes, let us speak as loud as you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Do not defy me.\"\n\n\"I do defy you, for you are known to be an evil-minded man; if you do\nthat, you will be looked upon as a coward, too; and Monsieur would have\nyou hanged, this evening, at his window-casement. Speak, my dear De\nWardes, speak.\"\n\n\"I have fought already.\"\n\n\"But not quite enough, yet.\"\n\n\"I see, you would not be sorry to fight with me while my wounds are\nstill open.\"\n\n\"No; better still.\"\n\n\"The deuce! you are unfortunate in the moment you have chosen; a duel,\nafter the one I have just fought, would hardly suit me; I have lost too\nmuch blood at Boulogne; at the slightest effort my wounds would open\nagain, and you would really have too good a bargain.\"\n\n\"True,\" said De Guiche; \"and yet, on your arrival here, your looks and\nyour arms showed there was nothing the matter with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, my arms are all right, but my legs are weak; and then, I have not\nhad a foil in my hand since that devil of a duel; and you, I am sure,\nhave been fencing every day, in order to carry your little conspiracy\nagainst me to a successful issue.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, monsieur,\" replied De Guiche, \"it is six months since I\nlast practiced.\"\n\n\"No, comte, after due reflection, I will not fight, at least, with you.\nI will await Bragelonne's return, since you say it is Bragelonne who\nfinds fault with me.\"\n\n\"Oh no, indeed! You shall not wait until Bragelonne's return,\" exclaimed\nthe comte, losing all command over himself, \"for you have said that\nBragelonne might, possibly, be some time before he returns; and, in the\nmeanwhile, your wicked insinuations would have had their effect.\"\n\n\"Yet, I shall have my excuse. So take care.\"\n\n\"I will give you a week to finish your recovery.\"\n\n\"That is better. We will wait a week.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand; a week will give time to my adversary to make\nhis escape. No, no; I will not give you one day, even.\"\n\n\"You are mad, monsieur,\" said De Wardes, retreating a step.\n\n\"And you are a coward, if you do not fight willingly. Nay, what is\nmore, I will denounce you to the king, as having refused to fight, after\nhaving insulted La Valliere.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said De Wardes, \"you are dangerously treacherous, though you pass\nfor a man of honor.\"\n\n\"There is nothing more dangerous than the treachery, as you term it, of\nthe man whose conduct is always loyal and upright.\"\n\n\"Restore me the use of my legs, then, or get yourself bled, till you are\nas white as I am, so as to equalize our chances.\"\n\n\"No, no; I have something better than that to propose.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"We will fight on horseback, and will exchange three pistol-shots each.\nYou are a first rate marksman. I have seen you bring down swallows with\nsingle balls, and at full gallop. Do not deny it, for I have seen you\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right,\" said De Wardes; \"and as that is the case, it\nis not unlikely I might kill you.\"\n\n\"You would be rendering me a very great service, if you did.\"\n\n\"I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Is it agreed? Give me your hand upon it.\"\n\n\"There it is: but on one condition, however.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"That not a word shall be said about it to the king.\"\n\n\"Not a word, I swear.\"\n\n\"I will go and get my horse, then.\"\n\n\"And I, mine.\"\n\n\"Where shall we meet?\"\n\n\"In the plain; I know an admirable place.\"\n\n\"Shall we go together?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nAnd both of them, on their way to the stables, passed beneath Madame's\nwindows, which were faintly lighted; a shadow could be seen behind the\nlace curtains. \"There is a woman,\" said De Wardes, smiling, \"who\ndoes not suspect that we are going to fight--to die, perhaps, on her\naccount.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIII. The Combat.\n\nDe Wardes and De Guiche selected their horses, and saddled them with\ntheir own hands, with holster saddles. De Guiche, having two pairs of\npistols, went to his apartments to get them; and after having loaded\nthem, gave the choice to De Wardes, who selected the pair he had made\nuse of twenty times before--the same, indeed, with which De Guiche had\nseen him kill swallows flying. \"You will not be surprised,\" he said, \"if\nI take every precaution. You know the weapons well, and, consequently, I\nam only making the chances equal.\"\n\n\"Your remark was quite useless,\" replied De Guiche, \"and you have done\nno more than you are entitled to do.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said De Wardes, \"I beg you to have the goodness to help me to\nmount; for I still experience a little difficulty in doing so.\"\n\n\"In that case, we had better settle the matter on foot.\"\n\n\"No; once in the saddle, I shall be all right.\"\n\n\"Very good, then; we will not speak of it again,\" said De Guiche, as he\nassisted De Wardes to mount his horse.\n\n\"And now,\" continued the young man, \"in our eagerness to murder one\nanother, we have neglected one circumstance.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That it is quite dark, and we shall almost be obliged to grope about,\nin order to kill.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said De Guiche, \"you are as anxious as I am that everything should\nbe done in proper order.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I do not wish people to say that you have assassinated me,\nany more than, supposing I were to kill you, I should myself like to be\naccused of such a crime.\"\n\n\"Did any one make a similar remark about your duel with the Duke of\nBuckingham?\" said De Guiche; \"it took place precisely under the same\nconditions as ours.\"\n\n\"Very true; but there was still light enough to see by; and we were up\nto our middles almost, in the water; besides, there were a good number\nof spectators on shore, looking at us.\"\n\nDe Guiche reflected for a moment; and the thought which had already\npresented itself to him became more confirmed--that De Wardes wished to\nhave witnesses present, in order to bring back the conversation about\nMadame, and to give a new turn to the combat. He avoided saying a\nword in reply, therefore; and, as De Wardes once more looked at him\ninterrogatively, he replied, by a movement of the head, that it would be\nbest to let things remain as they were. The two adversaries consequently\nset off, and left the chateau by the same gate, close to which we may\nremember to have seen Montalais and Malicorne together. The night, as\nif to counteract the extreme heat of the day, had gathered the clouds\ntogether in masses which were moving slowly along from the west to the\neast. The vault above, without a clear spot anywhere visible, or without\nthe faintest indication of thunder, seemed to hang heavily over\nthe earth, and soon began, by the force of the wind, to split into\nstreamers, like a huge sheet torn to shreds. Large and warm drops of\nrain began to fall heavily, and gathered the dust into globules, which\nrolled along the ground. At the same time, the hedges, which seemed\nconscious of the approaching storm, the thirsty plants, the drooping\nbranches of the trees, exhaled a thousand aromatic odors, which revived\nin the mind tender recollections, thoughts of youth, endless life,\nhappiness, and love. \"How fresh the earth smells,\" said De Wardes; \"it\nis a piece of coquetry to draw us to her.\"\n\n\"By the by,\" replied De Guiche, \"several ideas have just occurred to me;\nand I wish to have your opinion upon them.\"\n\n\"Relative to--\"\n\n\"Relative to our engagement.\"\n\n\"It is quite some time, in fact, that we should begin to arrange\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Is it to be an ordinary combat, and conducted according to established\ncustom?\"\n\n\"Let me first know what your established custom is.\"\n\n\"That we dismount in any particular open space that may suit us, fasten\nour horses to the nearest object, meet, each without our pistols in our\nhands, and afterwards retire for a hundred and fifty paces, in order to\nadvance on each other.\"\n\n\"Very good; that is precisely the way in which I killed poor Follivent,\nthree weeks ago, at Saint-Denis.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but you forgot one circumstance.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That in your duel with Follivent you advanced towards each other on\nfoot, your swords between your teeth, and your pistols in your hands.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"While now, on the contrary, as you cannot walk, you yourself admit that\nwe shall have to mount our horses again, and charge; and the first who\nwishes to fire will do so.\"\n\n\"That is the best course, no doubt; but it is quite dark; we must make\nallowances for more missed shots than would be the case in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Very well; each will fire three times; the pair of pistols already\nloaded, and one reload.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Where shall our engagement take place?\"\n\n\"Have you any preference?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You see that small wood which lies before us?\"\n\n\"The wood which is called Rochin?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"You know it?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"You know that there is an open glade in the center?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, this glade is admirably adapted for such a purpose, with a\nvariety of roads, by-places, paths, ditches, windings, and avenues. We\ncould not find a better spot.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly satisfied, if you are so. We are at our destination, if\nI am not mistaken.\"\n\n\"Yes. Look at the beautiful open space in the center. The faint light\nwhich the stars afford seems concentrated in this spot; the woods which\nsurround it seem, with their barriers, to form its natural limits.\"\n\n\"Very good. Do as you say.\"\n\n\"Let us first settle the conditions.\"\n\n\"These are mine; if you have any objection to make you will state it.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"If the horse be killed, its rider will be obliged to fight on foot.\"\n\n\"That is a matter of course, since we have no change of horses here.\"\n\n\"But that does not oblige his adversary to dismount.\"\n\n\"His adversary will, in fact, be free to act as he likes.\"\n\n\"The adversaries, having once met in close contact, cannot quit each\nother under any circumstances, and may, consequently, fire muzzle to\nmuzzle.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"Three shots and no more will do, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Quite sufficient, I think. Here are powder and balls for your pistols;\nmeasure out three charges, take three balls, I will do the same; then we\nwill throw the rest of the powder and balls away.\"\n\n\"And we will solemnly swear,\" said De Wardes, \"that we have neither\nballs nor powder about us?\"\n\n\"Agreed; and I swear it,\" said De Guiche, holding his hand towards\nheaven, a gesture which De Wardes imitated.\n\n\"And now, my dear comte,\" said De Wardes, \"allow me to tell you that I\nam in no way your dupe. You already are, or soon will be, the accepted\nlover of Madame. I have detected your secret, and you are afraid I shall\ntell others of it. You wish to kill me, to insure my silence; that is\nvery clear; and in your place, I should do the same.\" De Guiche hung\ndown his head. \"Only,\" continued De Wardes, triumphantly, \"was it\nreally worth while, tell me, to throw this affair of Bragelonne's on my\nshoulders? But, take care, my dear fellow; in bringing the wild boar to\nbay, you enrage him to madness; in running down the fox, you endow him\nwith the ferocity of the jaguar. The consequence is, that brought to bay\nby you, I shall defend myself to the very last.\"\n\n\"You will be quite right to do so.\"\n\n\"Yes; but take care; I shall work more harm than you think. In the first\nplace, as a beginning, you will readily suppose that I have not been\nabsurd enough to lock up my secret, or your secret rather, in my own\nbreast. There is a friend of mine, who resembles me in every way, a\nman whom you know very well, who shares my secret with me; so, pray\nunderstand, that if you kill me, my death will not have been of much\nservice to you; whilst, on the contrary, if I kill you--and everything\nis possible, you know--you understand?\" De Guiche shuddered. \"If I kill\nyou,\" continued De Wardes, \"you will have secured two mortal enemies to\nMadame, who will do their very utmost to ruin her.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur,\" exclaimed De Guiche, furiously, \"do not reckon upon my\ndeath so easily. Of the two enemies you speak of, I trust most\nheartily to dispose of one immediately, and the other at the earliest\nopportunity.\"\n\nThe only reply De Wardes made was a burst of laughter, so diabolical in\nits sound, that a superstitious man would have been terrified. But De\nGuiche was not so impressionable as that. \"I think,\" he said, \"that\neverything is now settled, Monsieur de Wardes; so have the goodness to\ntake your place first, unless you would prefer me to do so.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said De Wardes. \"I shall be delighted to save you the\nslightest trouble.\" And spurring his horse to a gallop, he crossed the\nwide open space, and took his stand at that point of the circumference\nof the cross-road immediately opposite to where De Guiche was stationed.\nDe Guiche remained motionless. At this distance of a hundred paces,\nthe two adversaries were absolutely invisible to each other, being\ncompletely concealed by the thick shade of elms and chestnuts. A minute\nelapsed amidst the profoundest silence. At the end of the minute, each\nof them, in the deep shade in which he was concealed, heard the double\nclick of the trigger, as they put the pistols on full cock. De Guiche,\nadopting the usual tactics, put his horse to a gallop, persuaded that he\nshould render his safety doubly sure by the movement, as well as by the\nspeed of the animal. He directed his course in a straight line towards\nthe point where, in his opinion, De Wardes would be stationed; and he\nexpected to meet De Wardes about half-way; but in this he was mistaken.\nHe continued his course, presuming that his adversary was impatiently\nawaiting his approach. When, however, he had gone about two-thirds of\nthe distance, he beheld the trees suddenly illuminated and a ball flew\nby, cutting the plume of his hat in two. Nearly at the same moment, and\nas if the flash of the first shot had served to indicate the direction\nof the other, a second report was heard, and a second ball passed\nthrough the head of De Guiche's horse, a little below the ear. The\nanimal fell. These two reports, proceeding from the very opposite\ndirection in which he expected to find De Wardes, surprised him a\ngreat deal; but as he was a man of amazing self-possession, he prepared\nhimself for his horse falling, but not so completely, however, that the\ntoe of his boot escaped being caught under the animal as it fell. Very\nfortunately the horse in its dying agonies moved so as to enable him to\nrelease the leg which was less entangled than the other. De Guiche rose,\nfelt himself all over, and found that he was not wounded. At the very\nmoment he had felt the horse tottering under him, he placed his pistols\nin the holsters, afraid that the force of the fall might explode one at\nleast, if not both of them, by which he would have been disarmed, and\nleft utterly without defense. Once on his feet, he took the pistols out\nof the holsters, and advanced towards the spot where, by the light of\nthe flash, he had seen De Wardes appear. De Wardes had, at the first\nshot, accounted for the maneuver, than which nothing could have been\nsimpler. Instead of advancing to meet De Guiche, or remaining in his\nplace to await his approach, De Wardes had, for about fifteen paces,\nfollowed the circle of the shadow which hid him from his adversary's\nobservation, and at the very moment when the latter presented his flank\nin his career, he had fired from the place where he stood, carefully\ntaking aim, and assisted instead of being inconvenienced by the horse's\ngallop. It has been seen that, notwithstanding the darkness, the first\nball passed hardly more than an inch above De Guiche's head. De Wardes\nhad so confidently relied upon his aim, that he thought he had seen De\nGuiche fall; his astonishment was extreme when he saw he still remained\nerect in his saddle. He hastened to fire his second shot, but his hand\ntrembled, and he killed the horse instead. It would be a most fortunate\nchance for him if De Guiche were to remain held fast under the animal.\nBefore he could have freed himself, De Wardes would have loaded his\npistol and had De Guiche at his mercy. But De Guiche, on the contrary,\nwas up, and had three shots to fire. De Guiche immediately understood\nthe position of affairs. It would be necessary to exceed De Wardes in\nrapidity of execution. He advanced, therefore, so as to reach him\nbefore he should have had time to reload his pistol. De Wardes saw him\napproaching like a tempest. The ball was rather tight, and offered some\nresistance to the ramrod. To load carelessly would be simply to lose\nhis last chance; to take the proper care in loading meant fatal loss of\ntime, or rather, throwing away his life. He made his horse bound on\none side. De Guiche turned round also, and, at the moment the horse was\nquiet again, fired, and the ball carried off De Wardes's hat from\nhis head. De Wardes now knew that he had a moment's time at his own\ndisposal; he availed himself of it in order to finish loading his\npistol. De Guiche, noticing that his adversary did not fall, threw the\npistol he had just discharged aside, and walked straight towards\nDe Wardes, elevating the second pistol as he did so. He had hardly\nproceeded more than two or three paces, when De Wardes took aim at him\nas he was walking, and fired. An exclamation of anger was De Guiche's\nanswer; the comte's arm contracted and dropped motionless by his side,\nand the pistol fell from his grasp. His anxiety was excessive. \"I am\nlost,\" murmured De Wardes, \"he is not mortally wounded.\" At the very\nmoment, however, De Guiche was about to raise his pistol against De\nWardes, the head, shoulders, and limbs of the comte seemed to collapse.\nHe heaved a deep-drawn sigh, tottered, and fell at the feet of De\nWardes's horse.\n\n\"That is all right,\" said De Wardes, and gathering up the reins, he\nstruck his spurs into the horse's sides. The horse cleared the comte's\nmotionless body, and bore De Wardes rapidly back to the chateau. When\nhe arrived there, he remained a quarter of an hour deliberating within\nhimself as to the proper course to be adopted. In his impatience to\nleave the field of battle, he had omitted to ascertain whether De Guiche\nwere dead or not. A double hypothesis presented itself to De Wardes's\nagitated mind; either De Guiche was killed, or De Guiche was wounded\nonly. If he were killed, why should he leave his body in that manner to\nthe tender mercies of the wolves; it was a perfectly useless piece of\ncruelty, for if De Guiche were dead, he certainly could not breathe a\nsyllable of what had passed; if he were not killed, why should he, De\nWardes, in leaving him there uncared for, allow himself to be regarded\nas a savage, incapable of one generous feeling? This last consideration\ndetermined his line of conduct.\n\nDe Wardes immediately instituted inquires after Manicamp. He was told\nthat Manicamp had been looking after De Guiche, and, not knowing where\nto find him, had retired to bed. De Wardes went and awoke the sleeper,\nwithout any delay, and related the whole affair to him, which Manicamp\nlistened to in perfect silence, but with an expression of momentarily\nincreasing energy, of which his face could hardly have been supposed\ncapable. It was only when De Wardes had finished, that Manicamp uttered\nthe words, \"Let us go.\"\n\nAs they proceeded, Manicamp became more and more excited, and in\nproportion as De Wardes related the details of the affair to him, his\ncountenance assumed every moment a darker expression. \"And so,\" he said,\nwhen De Wardes had finished, \"you think he is dead?\"\n\n\"Alas, I do.\"\n\n\"And you fought in that manner, without witnesses?\"\n\n\"He insisted upon it.\"\n\n\"It is very singular.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying it is singular?\"\n\n\"That it is very unlike Monsieur de Guiche's disposition.\"\n\n\"You do not doubt my word, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Hum! hum!\"\n\n\"You do doubt it, then?\"\n\n\"A little. But I shall doubt it more than ever, I warn you, if I find\nthe poor fellow is really dead.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Manicamp!\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Wardes!\"\n\n\"It seems you intend to insult me.\"\n\n\"Just as you please. The fact is, I never did like people who come and\nsay, 'I have killed such and such a gentleman in a corner; it is a great\npity, but I killed him in a perfectly honorable manner.' It has an ugly\nappearance, M. de Wardes.\"\n\n\"Silence! we have arrived.\"\n\nIn fact, the glade could now be seen, and in the open space lay the\nmotionless body of the dead horse. To the right of the horse, upon the\ndark grass, with his face against the ground, the poor comte lay, bathed\nin his blood. He had remained in the same spot, and did not even seem to\nhave made the slightest movement. Manicamp threw himself on his knees,\nlifted the comte in his arms, and found him quite cold, and steeped in\nblood. He let him gently fall again. Then, stretching out his hand and\nfeeling all over the ground close to where the comte lay, he sought\nuntil he found De Guiche's pistol.\n\n\"By Heaven!\" he said, rising to his feet, pale as death and with the\npistol in his hand, \"you are not mistaken, he is quite dead.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" repeated De Wardes.\n\n\"Yes; and his pistol is still loaded,\" added Manicamp, looking into the\npan.\n\n\"But I told you that I took aim as he was walking towards me, and fired\nat him at the very moment he was going to fire at me.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure that you fought with him, Monsieur de Wardes? I\nconfess that I am very much afraid it has been a foul assassination.\nNay, nay, no exclamations! You have had your three shots, and his pistol\nis still loaded. You have killed his horse, and he, De Guiche, one of\nthe best marksmen in France, has not touched even either your horse\nor yourself. Well, Monsieur de Wardes, you have been very unlucky in\nbringing me here; all the blood in my body seems to have mounted to my\nhead; and I verily believe that since so good an opportunity presents\nitself, I shall blow your brains out on the spot. So, Monsieur de\nWardes, recommend yourself to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Manicamp, you cannot think of such a thing!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am thinking of it very strongly.\"\n\n\"Would you assassinate me?\"\n\n\"Without the slightest remorse, at least for the present.\"\n\n\"Are you a gentleman?\"\n\n\"I have given a great many proofs of that.\"\n\n\"Let me defend my life, then, at least.\"\n\n\"Very likely; in order, I suppose, that you may do to me what you have\ndone to poor De Guiche.\"\n\nAnd Manicamp slowly raised his pistol to the height of De Wardes's\nbreast, and with arm stretched out, and a fixed, determined look on his\nface, took a careful aim.\n\nDe Wardes did not attempt a flight; he was completely terrified. In the\nmidst, however, of this horrible silence, which lasted about a second,\nbut which seemed an age to De Wardes, a faint sigh was heard.\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed De Wardes, \"he still lives! Help, De Guiche, I am about\nto be assassinated!\"\n\nManicamp fell back a step or two, and the two young men saw the comte\nraise himself slowly and painfully upon one hand. Manicamp threw the\npistol away a dozen paces, and ran to his friend, uttering a cry of\ndelight. De Wardes wiped his forehead, which was covered with a cold\nperspiration.\n\n\"It was just in time,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Where are you hurt?\" inquired Manicamp of De Guiche, \"and whereabouts\nare you wounded?\"\n\nDe Guiche showed him his mutilated hand and his chest covered with\nblood.\n\n\"Comte,\" exclaimed De Wardes, \"I am accused of having assassinated you;\nspeak, I implore you, and say that I fought loyally.\"\n\n\"Perfectly so,\" said the wounded man; \"Monsieur de Wardes fought quite\nloyally, and whoever says the contrary will make an enemy of me.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said Manicamp, \"assist me, in the first place, to carry\nthis gentleman home, and I will afterwards give you every satisfaction\nyou please; or, if you are in a hurry, we can do better still; let\nus stanch the blood from the comte's wounds here, with your\npocket-handkerchief and mine, and then, as there are two shots left, we\ncan have them between us.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said De Wardes. \"Twice already, in one hour, I have seen\ndeath too close at hand to be agreeable; I don't like his look at all,\nand I prefer your apologies.\"\n\nManicamp burst out laughing, and Guiche, too, in spite of his\nsufferings. The two young men wished to carry him, but he declared\nhe felt quite strong enough to walk alone. The ball had broken his\nring-finger and his little finger, and then had glanced along his side,\nbut without penetrating deeply into his chest. It was the pain rather\nthan the seriousness of the wound, therefore, which had overcome De\nGuiche. Manicamp passed his arm under one of the count's shoulders, and\nDe Wardes did the same with the other, and in this way they brought\nhim back to Fontainebleau, to the house of the same doctor who had been\npresent at the death of the Franciscan, Aramis's predecessor.\n\n\n\nChapter XIV. The King's Supper.\n\nThe king, while these matters were being arranged, was sitting at the\nsupper-table, and the not very large number of guests for that day had\ntaken their seats too, after the usual gesture intimating the royal\npermission. At this period of Louis XIV.'s reign, although etiquette was\nnot governed by the strict regulations subsequently adopted, the French\ncourt had entirely thrown aside the traditions of good-fellowship and\npatriarchal affability existing in the time of Henry IV., which the\nsuspicious mind of Louis XIII. had gradually replaced with pompous state\nand ceremony, which he despaired of being able fully to realize.\n\nThe king, therefore, was seated alone at a small separate table, which,\nlike the desk of a president, overlooked the adjoining tables. Although\nwe say a small table, we must not omit to add that this small table was\nthe largest one there. Moreover, it was the one on which were placed the\ngreatest number and quantity of dishes, consisting of fish, game, meat,\nfruit, vegetables, and preserves. The king was young and full of vigor\nand energy, very fond of hunting, addicted to all violent exercises\nof the body, possessing, besides, like all the members of the Bourbon\nfamily, a rapid digestion and an appetite speedily renewed. Louis XIV.\nwas a formidable table-companion; he delighted in criticising his cooks;\nbut when he honored them by praise and commendation, the honor was\noverwhelming. The king began by eating several kinds of soup, either\nmixed together or taken separately. He intermixed, or rather separated,\neach of the soups by a glass of old wine. He ate quickly and somewhat\ngreedily. Porthos, who from the beginning had, out of respect, been\nwaiting for a jog of D'Artagnan's arm, seeing the king make such rapid\nprogress, turned to the musketeer and said in a low voice:\n\n\"It seems as if one might go on now; his majesty is very encouraging,\nfrom the example he sets. Look.\"\n\n\"The king eats,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but he talks at the same time; try\nand manage matters in such a manner that, if he should happen to address\na remark to you, he will not find you with your mouth full--which would\nbe very disrespectful.\"\n\n\"The best way, in that case,\" said Porthos, \"is to eat no supper at all;\nand yet I am very hungry, I admit, and everything looks and smells most\ninvitingly, as if appealing to all my senses at once.\"\n\n\"Don't think of not eating for a moment,\" said D'Artagnan; \"that would\nput his majesty out terribly. The king has a saying, 'that he who works\nwell, eats well,' and he does not like people to eat indifferently at\nhis table.\"\n\n\"How can I avoid having my mouth full if I eat?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"All you have to do,\" replied the captain of the musketeers, \"is simply\nto swallow what you have in it, whenever the king does you the honor to\naddress a remark to you.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Porthos; and from that moment he began to eat with a\ncertain well-bred enthusiasm.\n\nThe king occasionally looked at the different persons who were at\ntable with him, and, _en connoisseur_, could appreciate the different\ndispositions of his guests.\n\n\"Monsieur du Vallon!\" he said.\n\nPorthos was enjoying a _salmi de lievre_, and swallowed half of the\nback. His name, pronounced in such a manner, made him start, and by a\nvigorous effort of his gullet he absorbed the whole mouthful.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Porthos, in a stifled voice, but sufficiently\nintelligible, nevertheless.\n\n\"Let those _filets d'agneau_ be handed to Monsieur du Vallon,\" said the\nking; \"do you like brown meats, M. du Vallon?\"\n\n\"Sire, I like everything,\" replied Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan whispered: \"Everything your majesty sends me.\"\n\nPorthos repeated: \"Everything your majesty sends me,\" an observation\nwhich the king apparently received with great satisfaction.\n\n\"People eat well who work well,\" replied the king, delighted to have _en\ntete-a-tete_ a guest who could eat as Porthos did. Porthos received the\ndish of lamb, and put a portion of it on his plate.\n\n\"Well?\" said the king.\n\n\"Exquisite,\" said Porthos, calmly.\n\n\"Have you as good mutton in your part of the country, Monsieur du\nVallon?\" continued the king.\n\n\"Sire, I believe that from my own province, as everywhere else, the best\nof everything is sent to Paris for your majesty's use; but, on the other\nhand, I do not eat lamb in the same way your majesty does.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! and how do you eat it?\"\n\n\"Generally, I have a lamb dressed whole.\"\n\n\"_Whole?_\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"In what manner, Monsieur du Vallon?\"\n\n\"In this, sire: my cook, who is a German, first stuffs the lamb in\nquestion with small sausages he procures from Strasburg, force-meat\nballs from Troyes, and larks from Pithiviers; by some means or other,\nwhich I am not acquainted with, he bones the lamb as he would do a fowl,\nleaving the skin on, however, which forms a brown crust all over the\nanimal; when it is cut in beautiful slices, in the same way as an\nenormous sausage, a rose-colored gravy pours forth, which is as\nagreeable to the eye as it is exquisite to the palate.\" And Porthos\nfinished by smacking his lips.\n\nThe king opened his eyes with delight, and, while cutting some of the\n_faisan en daube_, which was being handed to him, he said:\n\n\"That is a dish I should very much like to taste, Monsieur du Vallon. Is\nit possible! a whole lamb!\"\n\n\"Absolutely an entire lamb, sire.\"\n\n\"Pass those pheasants to M. du Vallon; I perceive he is an amateur.\"\n\nThe order was immediately obeyed. Then, continuing the conversation, he\nsaid: \"And you do not find the lamb too fat?\"\n\n\"No, sire, the fat falls down at the same time as the gravy does, and\nswims on the surface; then the servant who carves removes the fat with a\nspoon, which I have had expressly made for that purpose.\"\n\n\"Where do you reside?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"At Pierrefonds, sire.\"\n\n\"At Pierrefonds; where is that, M. du Vallon--near Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sire! Pierrefonds is in the Soissonnais.\"\n\n\"I thought you alluded to the lamb on account of the salt marshes.\"\n\n\"No, sire, I have marshes which are not salt, it is true, but which are\nnot the less valuable on that account.\"\n\nThe king had now arrived at the _entrements_, but without losing sight\nof Porthos, who continued to play his part in the best manner.\n\n\"You have an excellent appetite, M. du Vallon,\" said the king, \"and you\nmake an admirable guest at table.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire, if your majesty were ever to pay a visit to Pierrefonds,\nwe would both of us eat our lamb together; for your appetite is not an\nindifferent one by any means.\"\n\nD'Artagnan gave Porthos a kick under the table, which made Porthos color\nup.\n\n\"At your majesty's present happy age,\" said Porthos, in order to repair\nthe mistake he had made, \"I was in the musketeers, and nothing could\never satisfy me then. Your majesty has an excellent appetite, as I have\nalready had the honor of mentioning, but you select what you eat with\nquite too much refinement to be called for one moment a great eater.\"\n\nThe king seemed charmed at his guest's politeness.\n\n\"Will you try some of these creams?\" he said to Porthos.\n\n\"Sire, you majesty treats me with far too much kindness to prevent me\nspeaking the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Pray do so, M. du Vallon.\"\n\n\"Will, sire, with regard to sweet dishes I only recognize pastry, and\neven that should be rather solid; all these frothy substances swell the\nstomach, and occupy a space which seems to me to be too precious to be\nso badly tenanted.\"\n\n\"Ah! gentlemen,\" said the king, indicating Porthos by a gesture, \"here\nis indeed a model of gastronomy. It was in such a manner that our\nfathers, who so well knew what good living was, used to _eat_, while\nwe,\" added his majesty, \"do nothing but tantalize with our stomachs.\"\nAnd as he spoke, he took the breast of a chicken with ham, while Porthos\nattacked a dish of partridges and quails. The cup-bearer filled his\nmajesty's glass. \"Give M. du Vallon some of my wine,\" said the king.\nThis was one of the greatest honors of the royal table. D'Artagnan\npressed his friend's knee. \"If you could only manage to swallow the half\nof that boar's head I see yonder,\" said he to Porthos, \"I shall believe\nyou will be a duke and peer within the next twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"Presently,\" said Porthos, phlegmatically; \"I shall come to that by and\nby.\"\n\nIn fact it was not long before it came to the boar's turn, for the king\nseemed to take pleasure in urging on his guest; he did not pass any\nof the dishes to Porthos until he had tasted them himself, and he\naccordingly took some of the boar's head. Porthos showed that he could\nkeep pace with his sovereign; and, instead of eating the half, as\nD'Artagnan had told him, he ate three-fourths of it. \"It is impossible,\"\nsaid the king in an undertone, \"that a gentleman who eats so good a\nsupper every day, and who has such beautiful teeth, can be otherwise\nthan the most straightforward, upright man in my kingdom.\"\n\n\"Do you hear?\" said D'Artagnan in his friend's ear.\n\n\"Yes; I think I am rather in favor,\" said Porthos, balancing himself on\nhis chair.\n\n\"Oh! you are in luck's way.\"\n\nThe king and Porthos continued to eat in the same manner, to the great\nsatisfaction of the other guests, some of whom, from emulation, had\nattempted to follow them, but were obliged to give up half-way. The\nking soon began to get flushed and the reaction of the blood to his face\nannounced that the moment of repletion had arrived. It was then that\nLouis XIV., instead of becoming gay and cheerful, as most good livers\ngenerally do, became dull, melancholy, and taciturn. Porthos, on the\ncontrary, was lively and communicative. D'Artagnan's foot had more than\nonce to remind him of this peculiarity of the king. The dessert now\nmade its appearance. The king had ceased to think anything further of\nPorthos; he turned his eyes anxiously towards the entrance-door, and\nhe was heard occasionally to inquire how it happened that Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan was so long in arriving. At last, at the moment when\nhis majesty was finishing a pot of preserved plums with a deep sigh,\nSaint-Aignan appeared. The king's eyes, which had become somewhat dull,\nimmediately began to sparkle. The comte advanced towards the king's\ntable, and Louis rose at his approach. Everybody got up at the same\ntime, including Porthos, who was just finishing an almond-cake capable\nof making the jaws of a crocodile stick together. The supper was over.\n\n\n\nChapter XV. After Supper.\n\nThe king took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and passed into the adjoining\napartment. \"What has detained you, comte?\" said the king.\n\n\"I was bringing the answer, sire,\" replied the comte.\n\n\"She has taken a long time to reply to what I wrote her.\"\n\n\"Sire, your majesty deigned to write in verse, and Mademoiselle de la\nValliere wished to repay your majesty in the same coin; that is to say,\nin gold.\"\n\n\"Verses! Saint-Aignan,\" exclaimed the king in ecstasy. \"Give them to\nme at once.\" And Louis broke the seal of a little letter, inclosing the\nverses which history has preserved entire for us, and which are more\nmeritorious in invention than in execution. Such as they were, however,\nthe king was enchanted with them, and exhibited his satisfaction by\nunequivocal transports of delight; but the universal silence which\nreigned in the rooms warned Louis, so sensitively particular with\nregard to good breeding, that his delight must give rise to various\ninterpretations. He turned aside and put the note in his pocket, and\nthen advancing a few steps, which brought him again to the threshold of\nthe door close to his guests, he said, \"M. du Vallon, I have seen you\nto-day with the greatest pleasure, and my pleasure will be equally great\nto see you again.\" Porthos bowed as the Colossus of Rhodes would have\ndone, and retired from the room with his face towards the king. \"M.\nd'Artagnan,\" continued the king, \"you will await my orders in the\ngallery; I am obliged to you for having made me acquainted with M. du\nVallon. Gentlemen,\" addressing himself to the other guests, \"I return\nto Paris to-morrow on account of the departure of the Spanish and Dutch\nambassadors. Until to-morrow then.\"\n\nThe apartment was immediately cleared of the guests. The king took\nSaint-Aignan by the arm, made him read La Valliere's verses over again,\nand said, \"What do you think of them?\"\n\n\"Charming, sire.\"\n\n\"They charm me, in fact, and if they were known--\"\n\n\"Oh! the professional poets would be jealous of them; but it is not\nlikely they will know anything about them.\"\n\n\"Did you give her mine?\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, she positively devoured them.\"\n\n\"They were very weak, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"That is not what Mademoiselle de la Valliere said of them.\"\n\n\"Do you think she was pleased with them?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, sire.\"\n\n\"I must answer, then.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, immediately after supper? Your majesty will fatigue\nyourself.\"\n\n\"You are quite right; study after eating is notoriously injurious.\"\n\n\"The labor of a poet especially so; and besides, there is great\nexcitement prevailing at Mademoiselle de la Valliere's.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"With her as with all the ladies of the court.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"On account of poor De Guiche's accident.\"\n\n\"Has anything serious happened to De Guiche, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, he has one hand nearly destroyed, a hole in his breast; in\nfact, he is dying.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! who told you that?\"\n\n\"Manicamp brought him back just now to the house of a doctor here in\nFontainebleau, and the rumor soon reached us all.\"\n\n\"Brought back! Poor De Guiche; and how did it happen?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is the very question,--how did it happen?\"\n\n\"You say that in a very singular manner, Saint-Aignan. Give me the\ndetails. What does he say himself?\"\n\n\"He says nothing, sire; but others do.\"\n\n\"What others?\"\n\n\"Those who brought him back, sire.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"I do not know, sire; but M. de Manicamp knows. M. de Manicamp is one of\nhis friends.\"\n\n\"As everybody is, indeed,\" said the king.\n\n\"Oh! no!\" returned Saint-Aignan, \"you are mistaken sire; every one is\nnot precisely a friend of M. de Guiche.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Does your majesty require me to explain myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, I believe I have heard something said about a quarrel\nbetween two gentlemen.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"This very evening, before your majesty's supper was served.\"\n\n\"That can hardly be. I have issued such stringent and severe ordinances\nwith respect to duelling, that no one, I presume, would dare to disobey\nthem.\"\n\n\"In that case, Heaven preserve me from excusing any one!\" exclaimed\nSaint-Aignan. \"Your majesty commanded me to speak, and I spoke\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, in what way the Comte de Guiche has been wounded?\"\n\n\"Sire, it is said to have been at a boar-hunt.\"\n\n\"This evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"One of his hands shattered, and a hole in his breast. Who was at the\nhunt with M. de Guiche?\"\n\n\"I do not know, sire; but M. de Manicamp knows, or ought to know.\"\n\n\"You are concealing something from me, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Nothing, sire, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Then, explain to me how the accident happened; was it a musket that\nburst?\"\n\n\"Very likely, sire. But yet, on reflection, it could hardly have been\nthat, for De Guiche's pistol was found close by him still loaded.\"\n\n\"His pistol? But a man does not go to a boar-hunt with a pistol, I\nshould think.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is also said that De Guiche's horse was killed and that the\nhorse is still to be found in the wide open glade in the forest.\"\n\n\"His horse?--Guiche go on horseback to a boar-hunt?--Saint-Aignan, I do\nnot understand a syllable of what you have been telling me. Where did\nthis affair happen?\"\n\n\"At the Rond-point, in that part of the forest called the Bois-Rochin.\"\n\n\"That will do. Call M. d'Artagnan.\" Saint-Aignan obeyed, and the\nmusketeer entered.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the king, \"you will leave this place by the\nlittle door of the private staircase.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"You will mount your horse.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And you will proceed to the Rond-point du Bois-Rochin. Do you know the\nspot?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. I have fought there twice.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the king, amazed at the reply.\n\n\"Under the edicts, sire, of Cardinal Richelieu,\" returned D'Artagnan,\nwith his usual impassability.\n\n\"That is very different, monsieur. You will, therefore, go there, and\nwill examine the locality very carefully. A man has been wounded there,\nand you will find a horse lying dead. You will tell me what your opinion\nis upon the whole affair.\"\n\n\"Very good, sire.\"\n\n\"As a matter of course, it is your own opinion I require, and not that\nof any one else.\"\n\n\"You shall have it in an hour's time, sire.\"\n\n\"I prohibit your speaking with any one, whoever it may be.\"\n\n\"Except with the person who must give me a lantern,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh! that is a matter of course,\" said the king, laughing at the\nliberty, which he tolerated in no one but his captain of the musketeers.\nD'Artagnan left by the little staircase.\n\n\"Now, let my physician be sent for,\" said Louis. Ten minutes afterwards\nthe king's physician arrived, quite out of breath.\n\n\"You will go, monsieur,\" said the king to him, \"and accompany M. de\nSaint-Aignan wherever he may take you; you will render me an account of\nthe state of the person you may see in the house you will be taken to.\"\nThe physician obeyed without a remark, as at that time people began to\nobey Louis XIV., and left the room preceding Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Do you, Saint-Aignan, send Manicamp to me, before the physician can\npossibly have spoken to him.\" And Saint-Aignan left in his turn.\n\n\n\nChapter XVI. Showing in What Way D'Artagnan Discharged the Mission with\nWhich the King Had Intrusted Him.\n\nWhile the king was engaged in making these last-mentioned arrangements\nin order to ascertain the truth, D'Artagnan, without losing a second,\nran to the stable, took down the lantern, saddled his horse himself, and\nproceeded towards the place his majesty had indicated. According to\nthe promise he had made, he had not accosted any one; and, as we have\nobserved, he had carried his scruples so far as to do without the\nassistance of the stable-helpers altogether. D'Artagnan was one of those\nwho in moments of difficulty pride themselves on increasing their own\nvalue. By dint of hard galloping, he in less than five minutes\nreached the wood, fastened his horse to the first tree he came to, and\npenetrated to the broad open space on foot. He then began to inspect\nmost carefully, on foot and with his lantern in his hand, the whole\nsurface of the Rond-point, went forward, turned back again, measured,\nexamined, and after half an hour's minute inspection, he returned\nsilently to where he had left his horse, and pursued his way in deep\nreflection and at a foot-pace to Fontainebleau. Louis was waiting in his\ncabinet; he was alone, and with a pencil was scribbling on paper certain\nlines which D'Artagnan at the first glance recognized as unequal and\nvery much touched up. The conclusion he arrived at was, that they must\nbe verses. The king raised his head and perceived D'Artagnan. \"Well,\nmonsieur,\" he said, \"do you bring me any news?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"What have you seen?\"\n\n\"As far as probability goes, sire--\" D'Artagnan began to reply.\n\n\"It was certainty I requested of you.\"\n\n\"I will approach it as near as I possibly can. The weather was very well\nadapted for investigations of the character I have just made; it has\nbeen raining this evening, and the roads were wet and muddy--\"\n\n\"Well, the result, M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Sire, your majesty told me that there was a horse lying dead in the\ncross-road of the Bois-Rochin, and I began, therefore, by studying the\nroads. I say the roads, because the center of the cross-road is reached\nby four separate roads. The one that I myself took was the only one that\npresented any fresh traces. Two horses had followed it side by side;\ntheir eight feet were marked very distinctly in the clay. One of the\nriders was more impatient than the other, for the footprints of the one\nwere invariably in advance of the other about half a horse's length.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure they were traveling together?\" said the king.\n\n\"Yes sire. The horses are two rather large animals of equal\npace,--horses well used to maneuvers of all kinds, for they wheeled\nround the barrier of the Rond-point together.\"\n\n\"Well--and after?\"\n\n\"The two cavaliers paused there for a minute, no doubt to arrange the\nconditions of the engagement; the horses grew restless and impatient.\nOne of the riders spoke, while the other listened and seemed to have\ncontented himself by simply answering. His horse pawed the ground, which\nproves that his attention was so taken up by listening that he let the\nbridle fall from his hand.\"\n\n\"A hostile meeting did take place then?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Continue; you are a very accurate observer.\"\n\n\"One of the two cavaliers remained where he was standing, the one, in\nfact, who had been listening; the other crossed the open space, and at\nfirst placed himself directly opposite to his adversary. The one who\nhad remained stationary traversed the Rond-point at a gallop, about\ntwo-thirds of its length, thinking that by this means he would gain\nupon his opponent; but the latter had followed the circumference of the\nwood.\"\n\n\"You are ignorant of their names, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Completely so, sire. Only he who followed the circumference of the wood\nwas mounted on a black horse.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I found a few hairs of his tail among the brambles which bordered the\nsides of the ditch.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"As for the other horse, there can be no trouble in describing him,\nsince he was left dead on the field of battle.\"\n\n\"What was the cause of his death?\"\n\n\"A ball which had passed through his brain.\"\n\n\"Was the ball that of a pistol or a gun?\"\n\n\"It was a pistol-bullet, sire. Besides, the manner in which the horse\nwas wounded explained to me the tactics of the man who had killed it.\nHe had followed the circumference of the wood in order to take his\nadversary in flank. Moreover, I followed his foot-tracks on the grass.\"\n\n\"The tracks of the black horse, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Go on, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"As your majesty now perceives the position of the two adversaries, I\nwill, for a moment, leave the cavalier who had remained stationary for\nthe one who started off at a gallop.\"\n\n\"Do so.\"\n\n\"The horse of the cavalier who rode at full speed was killed on the\nspot.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"The cavalier had not time even to throw himself off his horse, and so\nfell with it. I observed the impression of his leg, which, with a great\neffort, he was enabled to extricate from under the horse. The spur,\npressed down by the weight of the animal, had plowed up the ground.\"\n\n\"Very good; and what did he do as soon as he rose up again?\"\n\n\"He walked straight up to his adversary.\"\n\n\"Who still remained upon the verge of the forest?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. Then, having reached a favorable distance, he stopped\nfirmly, for the impression of both his heels are left in the ground\nquite close to each other, fired, and missed his adversary.\"\n\n\"How do you know he did not hit him?\"\n\n\"I found a hat with a ball through it.\"\n\n\"Ah, a proof, then!\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"Insufficient, sire,\" replied D'Artagnan, coldly; \"it is a hat without\nany letters indicating its ownership, without arms; a red feather, as\nall hats have; the lace, even, had nothing particular in it.\"\n\n\"Did the man with the hat through which the bullet had passed fire a\nsecond time?\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, he had already fired twice.\"\n\n\"How did you ascertain that?\"\n\n\"I found the waddings of the pistol.\"\n\n\"And what became of the bullet which did not kill the horse?\"\n\n\"It cut in two the feather of the hat belonging to him against whom\nit was directed, and broke a small birch at the other end of the open\nglade.\"\n\n\"In that case, then, the man on the black horse was disarmed, whilst his\nadversary had still one more shot to fire?\"\n\n\"Sire, while the dismounted rider was extricating himself from his\nhorse, the other was reloading his pistol. Only, he was much agitated\nwhile he was loading it, and his hand trembled greatly.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Half the charge fell to the ground, and he threw the ramrod aside, not\nhaving time to replace it in the pistol.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, this is marvellous you tell me.\"\n\n\"It is only close observation, sire, and the commonest highwayman could\ntell as much.\"\n\n\"The whole scene is before me from the manner in which you relate it.\"\n\n\"I have, in fact, reconstructed it in my own mind, with merely a few\nalterations.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said the king, \"let us return to the dismounted cavalier. You\nwere saying that he walked towards his adversary while the latter was\nloading his pistol.\"\n\n\"Yes; but at the very moment he himself was taking aim, the other\nfired.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the king; \"and the shot?\"\n\n\"The shot told terribly, sire; the dismounted cavalier fell upon his\nface, after having staggered forward three or four paces.\"\n\n\"Where was he hit?\"\n\n\"In two places; in the first place, in his right hand, and then, by the\nsame bullet, in his chest.\"\n\n\"But how could you ascertain that?\" inquired the king, full of\nadmiration.\n\n\"By a very simple means; the butt end of the pistol was covered with\nblood, and the trace of the bullet could be observed, with fragments of\na broken ring. The wounded man, in all probability, had the ring-finger\nand the little finger carried off.\"\n\n\"As far as the hand goes, I have nothing to say; but the chest?\"\n\n\"Sire, there were two small pools of blood, at a distance of about two\nfeet and a half from each other. At one of these pools of blood the\ngrass was torn up by the clenched hand; at the other, the grass was\nsimply pressed down by the weight of the body.\"\n\n\"Poor De Guiche!\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"Ah! it was M. de Guiche, then?\" said the musketeer, quietly. \"I\nsuspected it, but did not venture to mention it to your majesty.\"\n\n\"And what made you suspect it?\"\n\n\"I recognized the De Gramont arms upon the holsters of the dead horse.\"\n\n\"And you think he is seriously wounded?\"\n\n\"Very seriously, since he fell immediately, and remained a long time\nin the same place; however, he was able to walk, as he left the spot,\nsupported by two friends.\"\n\n\"You met him returning, then?\"\n\n\"No; but I observed the footprints of three men; the one on the right\nand the one on the left walked freely and easily, but the one in the\nmiddle dragged his feet as he walked; besides, he left traces of blood\nat every step he took.\"\n\n\"Now, monsieur, since you saw the combat so distinctly that not a single\ndetail seems to have escaped you, tell me something about De Guiche's\nadversary.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, I do not know him.\"\n\n\"And yet you see everything very clearly.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, I see everything; but I do not tell all I see; and, since\nthe poor devil has escaped, your majesty will permit me to say that I do\nnot intend to denounce him.\"\n\n\"And yet he is guilty, since he has fought a duel, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Not guilty in my eyes, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, coldly.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" exclaimed the king, \"are you aware of what you are saying?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sire; but, according to my notions, a man who fights a duel\nis a brave man; such, at least, is my own opinion; but your majesty may\nhave another, it is but natural, for you are master here.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, I ordered you, however--\"\n\nD'Artagnan interrupted the king by a respectful gesture. \"You ordered\nme, sire, to gather what particulars I could, respecting a hostile\nmeeting that had taken place; those particulars you have. If you order\nme to arrest M. de Guiche's adversary, I will do so; but do not order me\nto denounce him to you, for in that case I will not obey.\"\n\n\"Very well! Arrest him, then.\"\n\n\"Give me his name, sire.\"\n\nThe king stamped his foot angrily; but after a moment's reflection, he\nsaid, \"You are right--ten times, twenty times, a hundred times right.\"\n\n\"That is my opinion, sire: I am happy that, this time, it accords with\nyour majesty's.\"\n\n\"One word more. Who assisted Guiche?\"\n\n\"I do not know, sire.\"\n\n\"But you speak of two men. There was a person present, then, as second.\"\n\n\"There was no second, sire. Nay, more than that, when M. de Guiche fell,\nhis adversary fled without giving him any assistance.\"\n\n\"The miserable coward!\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"The consequence of your ordinances, sire. If a man has fought well, and\nfairly, and has already escaped one chance of death, he naturally wishes\nto escape a second. M. de Bouteville cannot be forgotten very easily.\"\n\n\"And so, men turn cowards.\"\n\n\"No, they become prudent.\"\n\n\"And he has fled, then, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes; and as fast as his horse could possibly carry him.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"In the direction of the chateau.\"\n\n\"Well, and after that?\"\n\n\"Afterwards, as I have had the honor of telling your majesty, two men on\nfoot arrived, who carried M. de Guiche back with them.\"\n\n\"What proof have you that these men arrived after the combat?\"\n\n\"A very evident proof, sire; at the moment the encounter took place,\nthe rain had just ceased, the ground had not had time to imbibe the\nmoisture, and was, consequently, soaked; the footsteps sank in the\nground; but while M. de Guiche was lying there in a fainting condition,\nthe ground became firm again, and the footsteps made a less sensible\nimpression.\"\n\nLouis clapped his hands together in sign of admiration. \"Monsieur\nd'Artagnan,\" he said, \"you are positively the cleverest man in my\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"The identical thing M. de Richelieu thought, and M. de Mazarin said,\nsire.\"\n\n\"And now, it remains for us to see if your sagacity is at fault.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, a man may be mistaken; _humanum est errare_,\" said the\nmusketeer, philosophically. [1]\n\n\"In that case, you are not human, Monsieur d'Artagnan, for I believe you\nare never mistaken.\"\n\n\"Your majesty said that we were going to see whether such was the case,\nor not.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I venture to ask?\"\n\n\"I have sent for M. de Manicamp, and M. de Manicamp is coming.\"\n\n\"And M. de Manicamp knows the secret?\"\n\n\"De Guiche has no secrets from M. de Manicamp.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shook his head. \"No one was present at the combat, I repeat;\nand unless M. de Manicamp was one of the two men who brought him back--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said the king, \"he is coming; remain, and listen attentively.\"\n\n\"Very good, sire.\"\n\nAnd, at the very same moment, Manicamp and Saint-Aignan appeared at the\nthreshold of the door.\n\n\n\nChapter XVII. The Encounter.\n\nThe king signified with an imperious gesture, first to the musketeer,\nthen to Saint-Aignan, \"On your lives, not a word.\" D'Artagnan withdrew,\nlike a sentinel, to a corner of the room; Saint-Aignan, in his character\nof a favorite, leaned over the back of the king's chair. Manicamp, with\nhis right foot properly advanced, a smile upon his lips, and his\nwhite and well-formed hands gracefully disposed, advanced to make his\nreverence to the king, who returned the salutation by a bow. \"Good\nevening, M. de Manicamp,\" he said.\n\n\"Your majesty did me the honor to send for me,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"Yes, in order to learn from you all the details of the unfortunate\naccident which has befallen the Comte de Guiche.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, it is grievous indeed.\"\n\n\"You were there?\"\n\n\"Not precisely, sire.\"\n\n\"But you arrived on the scene of the accident, a few minutes after it\ntook place?\"\n\n\"Sire, about half an hour afterwards.\"\n\n\"And where did the accident happen?\"\n\n\"I believe, sire, the place is called the Rond-point du Bois-Rochin.\"\n\n\"Oh! the rendezvous of the hunt.\"\n\n\"The very spot, sire.\"\n\n\"Good; give me all the details you are acquainted with, respecting this\nunhappy affair, Monsieur de Manicamp.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your majesty has already been informed of them, and I fear to\nfatigue you with useless repetition.\"\n\n\"No, do not be afraid of that.\"\n\nManicamp looked round him; he saw only D'Artagnan leaning with his\nback against the wainscot--D'Artagnan, calm, kind, and good-natured as\nusual--and Saint-Aignan whom he had accompanied, and who still leaned\nover the king's armchair with an expression of countenance equally full\nof good feeling. He determined, therefore, to speak out. \"Your majesty\nis perfectly aware,\" he said, \"that accidents are very frequent in\nhunting.\"\n\n\"In hunting, do you say?\"\n\n\"I mean, sire, when an animal is brought to bay.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the king, \"it was when the animal was brought to bay,\nthen, that the accident happened?\"\n\n\"Alas! sire, unhappily it was.\"\n\nThe king paused for a moment before he said: \"What animal was being\nhunted?\"\n\n\"A wild boar, sire.\"\n\n\"And what could possibly have possessed De Guiche to go to a wild\nboar-hunt by himself; that is but a clownish idea of sport, only fit for\nthat class of people who, unlike the Marechal de Gramont, have no dogs\nand huntsmen, to hunt as gentlemen should do.\"\n\nManicamp shrugged his shoulders. \"Youth is very rash,\" he said,\nsententiously.\n\n\"Well, go on,\" said the king.\n\n\"At all events,\" continued Manicamp, not venturing to be too precipitate\nand hasty, and letting his words fall very slowly one by one, \"at all\nevents, sire, poor De Guiche went hunting--all alone.\"\n\n\"Quite alone? indeed?--What a sportsman! And is not M. de Guiche aware\nthat the wild boar always stands at bay?\"\n\n\"That is the very thing that really happened, sire.\"\n\n\"He had some idea, then, of the beast being there?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, some peasants had seen it among their potatoes.\" [2]\n\n\"And what kind of animal was it?\"\n\n\"A short, thick beast.\"\n\n\"You may as well tell me, monsieur, that De Guiche had some idea of\ncommitting suicide; for I have seen him hunt, and he is an active and\nvigorous hunter. Whenever he fires at an animal brought to bay and held\nin check by the dogs, he takes every possible precaution, and yet he\nfires with a carbine, and on this occasion he seems to have faced the\nboar with pistols only.\"\n\nManicamp started.\n\n\"A costly pair of pistols, excellent weapons to fight a duel with a man\nand not a wild boar. What an absurdity!\"\n\n\"There are some things, sire, which are difficult of explanation.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, and the event which we are now discussing is\ncertainly one of them. Go on.\"\n\nDuring the recital, Saint-Aignan, who probably would have made a sign to\nManicamp to be careful what he was about, found that the king's glance\nwas constantly fixed upon himself, so that it was utterly impossible to\ncommunicate with Manicamp in any way. As for D'Artagnan, the statue of\nSilence at Athens was far more noisy and far more expressive than he.\nManicamp, therefore, was obliged to continue in the same way he\nhad begun, and so contrived to get more and more entangled in his\nexplanation. \"Sire,\" he said, \"this is probably how the affair happened.\nGuiche was waiting to receive the boar as it rushed towards him.\"\n\n\"On foot or on horseback?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"On horseback. He fired upon the brute and missed his aim, and then it\ndashed upon him.\"\n\n\"And the horse was killed.\"\n\n\"Ah! your majesty knows that, then.\"\n\n\"I have been told that a horse has been found lying dead in the\ncross-roads of the Bois-Rochin, and I presume it was De Guiche's horse.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, sire, it was his.\"\n\n\"Well, so much for the horse, and now for De Guiche?\"\n\n\"De Guiche, once down, was attacked and worried by the wild boar, and\nwounded in the hand and in the chest.\"\n\n\"It is a horrible accident, but it must be admitted it was De Guiche's\nown fault. How could he possibly have gone to hunt such an animal merely\narmed with pistols; he must have forgotten the fable of Adonis?\"\n\nManicamp rubbed his ear in seeming perplexity. \"Very true,\" he said, \"it\nwas very imprudent.\"\n\n\"Can you explain it, Monsieur Manicamp?\"\n\n\"Sire, what is written is written!\"\n\n\"Ah! you are a fatalist.\"\n\nManicamp looked very uncomfortable and ill at ease.\n\n\"I am angry with you, Monsieur Manicamp,\" continued the king.\n\n\"With me, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes. How was it that you, who are De Guiche's intimate friend, and\nwho know that he is subject to such acts of folly, did not stop him in\ntime?\"\n\nManicamp no longer knew what to do; the tone in which the king spoke\nwas anything but that of a credulous man. On the other hand, it did\nnot indicate any particular severity, nor did he seem to care very\nmuch about the cross-examination. There was more of raillery in it than\nmenace. \"And you say, then,\" continued the king, \"that it was positively\nDe Guiche's horse that was found dead?\"\n\n\"Quite positive, sire.\"\n\n\"Did that astonish you?\"\n\n\"No, sire; for your majesty will remember that, at the last hunt, M. de\nSaint-Maure had a horse killed under him, and in the same way.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that one was ripped open.\"\n\n\"Of course, sire.\"\n\n\"Had Guiche's horse been ripped open like M. de Saint-Maure's horse, I\nshould not have been astonished.\"\n\nManicamp opened his eyes very wide.\n\n\"Am I mistaken,\" resumed the king, \"was it not in the frontal bone that\nDe Guiche's horse was struck? You must admit, Monsieur de Manicamp, that\nthat is a very singular place for a wild boar to attack.\"\n\n\"You are aware, sire, that the horse is a very intelligent animal, and\nhe doubtless endeavoured to defend himself.\"\n\n\"But a horse defends himself with his heels and not with his head.\"\n\n\"In that case, the terrified horse may have slipped or fallen down,\"\nsaid Manicamp, \"and the boar, you understand sire, the boar--\"\n\n\"Oh! I understand that perfectly, as far as the horse is concerned; but\nhow about his rider?\"\n\n\"Well! that, too, is simple enough; the boar left the horse and attacked\nthe rider; and, as I have already had the honor of informing your\nmajesty, shattered De Guiche's hand at the very moment he was about to\ndischarge his second pistol at him, and then, with a gouge of his tusk,\nmade that terrible hole in his chest.\"\n\n\"Nothing is more likely; really, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are wrong in\nplacing so little confidence in your own eloquence, and you can tell a\nstory most admirably.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is exceedingly kind,\" said Manicamp, saluting him in the\nmost embarrassed manner.\n\n\"From this day henceforth, I will prohibit any gentleman attached to my\ncourt going out to a similar encounter. Really, one might just as well\npermit duelling.\"\n\nManicamp started, and moved as if he were about to withdraw. \"Is your\nmajesty satisfied?\"\n\n\"Delighted; but do not withdraw yet, Monsieur de Manicamp,\" said Louis,\n\"I have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" thought D'Artagnan, \"there is another who is not up to the\nmark;\" and he uttered a sigh which might signify, \"Oh! the men of _our_\nstamp, where are they _now?_\"\n\nAt this moment an usher lifted up the curtain before the door, and\nannounced the king's physician.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Louis, \"here comes Monsieur Valot, who has just been to\nsee M. de Guiche. We shall now hear news of the man maltreated by the\nboar.\"\n\nManicamp felt more uncomfortable than ever.\n\n\"In this way, at least,\" added the king, \"our conscience will be quite\nclear.\" And he looked at D'Artagnan, who did not seem in the slightest\ndegree discomposed.\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII. The Physician.\n\nM. Valot entered. The position of the different persons present was\nprecisely the same: the king was seated, Saint-Aignan leaning over the\nback of his armchair, D'Artagnan with his back against the wall, and\nManicamp still standing.\n\n\"Well, M. Valot,\" said the king, \"did you obey my directions?\"\n\n\"With the greatest alacrity, sire.\"\n\n\"You went to the doctor's house in Fontainebleau?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And you found M. de Guiche there?\"\n\n\"I did, sire.\"\n\n\"What state was he in?--speak unreservedly.\"\n\n\"In a very sad state indeed, sire.\"\n\n\"The wild boar did not quite devour him, however?\"\n\n\"Devour whom?\"\n\n\"De Guiche.\"\n\n\"What wild boar?\"\n\n\"The boar that wounded him.\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche wounded by a boar?\"\n\n\"So it is said, at least.\"\n\n\"By a poacher, rather, or by a jealous husband, or an ill-used lover,\nwho, in order to be revenged, fired upon him.\"\n\n\"What is it that you say, Monsieur Valot? Were not M. de Guiche's wounds\nproduced by defending himself against a wild boar?\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche's wounds are the result of a pistol-bullet that broke\nhis ring-finger and the little finger of the right hand, and afterwards\nburied itself in the intercostal muscles of the chest.\"\n\n\"A bullet! Are you sure Monsieur de Guiche was wounded by a _bullet?_\"\nexclaimed the king, pretending to look much surprised.\n\n\"Indeed, I am, sire; so sure, in fact, that here it is.\" And he\npresented to the king a half-flattened bullet, which the king looked at,\nbut did not touch.\n\n\"Did he have that in his chest, poor fellow?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not precisely. The ball did not penetrate, but was flattened, as you\nsee, either upon the trigger of the pistol or upon the right side of the\nbreast-bone.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said the king, seriously, \"you said nothing to me about\nthis, Monsieur de Manicamp.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"What does all this mean, then, this invention about hunting a wild boar\nat nightfall? Come, speak, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"It seems, then, that you are right,\" said the king, turning round\ntowards his captain of musketeers, \"and that a duel actually took\nplace.\"\n\nThe king possessed, to a greater extent than any one else, the faculty\nenjoyed by the great in power or position, of compromising and dividing\nthose beneath him. Manicamp darted a look full of reproaches at the\nmusketeer. D'Artagnan understood the look at once, and not wishing\nto remain beneath the weight of such an accusation, advanced a step\nforward, and said: \"Sire, your majesty commanded me to go and explore\nthe place where the cross-roads meet in the Bois-Rochin, and to report\nto you, according to my own ideas, what had taken place there. I\nsubmitted my observations to you, but without denouncing any one. It was\nyour majesty yourself who was the first to name the Comte de Guiche.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, well,\" said the king, haughtily; \"you have done your\nduty, and I am satisfied with you. But you, Monsieur de Manicamp, have\nfailed in yours, for you have told me a falsehood.\"\n\n\"A falsehood, sire. The expression is a hard one.\"\n\n\"Find a more accurate, then.\"\n\n\"Sire, I will not attempt to do so. I have already been unfortunate\nenough to displease your majesty, and it will, in every respect, be far\nbetter for me to accept most humbly any reproaches you may think proper\nto address to me.\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur, whoever conceals the truth from me, risks my\ndispleasure.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, sire, one is ignorant of the truth.\"\n\n\"No further falsehood, monsieur, or I double the punishment.\"\n\nManicamp bowed and turned pale. D'Artagnan again made another step\nforward, determined to interfere, if the still increasing anger of the\nking attained certain limits.\n\n\"You see, monsieur,\" continued the king, \"that it is useless to deny the\nthing any longer. M. de Guiche has fought a duel.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it, sire, and it would have been truly generous on your\nmajesty's part not to have forced me to tell a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Forced? Who forced you?\"\n\n\"Sire, M. de Guiche is my friend. Your majesty has forbidden duels under\npain of death. A falsehood might save my friend's life, and I told it.\"\n\n\"Good!\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"an excellent fellow, upon my word.\"\n\n\"Instead of telling a falsehood, monsieur, you should have prevented him\nfrom fighting,\" said the king.\n\n\"Oh! sire, your majesty, who is the most accomplished gentleman in\nFrance, knows quite as well as any of us other gentlemen that we have\nnever considered M. de Bouteville dishonored for having suffered death\non the Place de Greve. That which does in truth dishonor a man is to\navoid meeting his enemy--not to avoid meeting his executioner!\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, that may be so,\" said Louis XIV.; \"I am desirous of\nsuggesting a means of your repairing all.\"\n\n\"If it be a means of which a gentleman may avail himself, I shall most\neagerly seize the opportunity.\"\n\n\"The name of M. de Guiche's adversary?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"are we going to take Louis XIII. as a\nmodel?\"\n\n\"Sire!\" said Manicamp, with an accent of reproach.\n\n\"You will not name him, then?\" said the king.\n\n\"Sire, I do not know him.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" murmured D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur de Manicamp, hand your sword to the captain.\"\n\nManicamp bowed very gracefully, unbuckled his sword, smiling as he did\nso, and handed it for the musketeer to take. But Saint-Aignan advanced\nhurriedly between him and D'Artagnan. \"Sire,\" he said, \"will your\nmajesty permit me to say a word?\"\n\n\"Do so,\" said the king, delighted, perhaps, at the bottom of his heart,\nfor some one to step between him and the wrath he felt he had carried\nhim too far.\n\n\"Manicamp, you are a brave man, and the king will appreciate your\nconduct; but to wish to serve your friends too well, is to destroy them.\nManicamp, you know the name the king asks you for?\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true--I do know it.\"\n\n\"You will give it up then?\"\n\n\"If I felt I ought to have mentioned it, I should have already done so.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell it, for I am not so extremely sensitive on such points\nof honor as you are.\"\n\n\"You are at liberty to do so, but it seems to me, however--\"\n\n\"Oh! a truce to magnanimity; I will not permit you to go to the Bastile\nin that way. Do you speak; or I will.\"\n\nManicamp was keen-witted enough, and perfectly understood that he had\ndone quite sufficient to produce a good opinion of his conduct; it was\nnow only a question of persevering in such a manner as to regain the\ngood graces of the king. \"Speak, monsieur,\" he said to Saint-Aignan; \"I\nhave on my own behalf done all that my conscience told me to do; and it\nmust have been very importunate,\" he added, turning towards the king,\n\"since its mandates led me to disobey your majesty's commands; but your\nmajesty will forgive me, I hope, when you learn that I was anxious to\npreserve the honor of a lady.\"\n\n\"Of a lady?\" said the king, with some uneasiness.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"A lady was the cause of this duel?\"\n\nManicamp bowed.\n\n\"If the position of the lady in question warrants it,\" he said, \"I shall\nnot complain of your having acted with so much circumspection; on the\ncontrary, indeed.\"\n\n\"Sire, everything which concerns your majesty's household, or the\nhousehold of your majesty's brother, is of importance in my eyes.\"\n\n\"In my brother's household,\" repeated Louis XIV., with a slight\nhesitation. \"The cause of the duel was a lady belonging to my brother's\nhousehold, do you say?\"\n\n\"Or to Madame's.\"\n\n\"Ah! to Madame's?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Well--and this lady?\"\n\n\"Is one of the maids of honor of her royal highness Madame la Duchesse\nd'Orleans.\"\n\n\"For whom M. de Guiche fought--do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and, this time, I tell no falsehood.\"\n\nLouis seemed restless and anxious. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, turning towards\nthe spectators of this scene, \"will you have the goodness to retire for\na moment. I wish to be alone with M. de Manicamp; I know he has some\nimportant communication to make for his own justification, and which\nhe will not venture before witnesses.... Put up your sword, M. de\nManicamp.\"\n\nManicamp returned his sword to his belt.\n\n\"The fellow decidedly has his wits about him,\" murmured the musketeer,\ntaking Saint-Aignan by the arm, and withdrawing with him.\n\n\"He will get out of it,\" said the latter in D'Artagnan's ear.\n\n\"And with honor, too, comte.\"\n\nManicamp cast a glance of recognition at Saint-Aignan and the captain,\nwhich luckily passed unnoticed by the king.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said D'Artagnan, as he left the room, \"I had an\nindifferent opinion of the new generation. Well, I was mistaken after\nall. There is some good in them, I perceive.\"\n\nValot preceded the favorite and the captain, leaving the king and\nManicamp alone in the cabinet.\n\n\n\nChapter XIX. Wherein D'Artagnan Perceives that It Was He Who Was\nMistaken, and Manicamp Who Was Right.\n\nThe king, determined to be satisfied that no one was listening, went\nhimself to the door, and then returned precipitately and placed himself\nopposite Manicamp.\n\n\"And now we are alone, Monsieur de Manicamp, explain yourself.\"\n\n\"With the greatest frankness, sire,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"And in the first place, pray understand,\" added the king, \"that there\nis nothing to which I personally attach a greater importance than the\nhonor of _any_ lady.\"\n\n\"That is the very reason, sire, why I endeavored to study your delicacy\nof sentiment and feeling.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand it all now. You say that it was one of the maids of\nhonor of my sister-in-law who was the subject of dispute, and that the\nperson in question, De Guiche's adversary, the man, in point of fact,\nwhom you will not name--\"\n\n\"But whom M. de Saint-Aignan will name, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Yes, you say, however, that this man insulted some one belonging to the\nhousehold of Madame.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, as if he had expected the name, and yet as if its\nannouncement had caused him a sudden pang; \"ah! it was Mademoiselle de\nla Valliere who was insulted.\"\n\n\"I do not say precisely that she was insulted, sire.\"\n\n\"But at all events--\"\n\n\"I merely say that she was spoken of in terms far enough from\nrespectful.\"\n\n\"A man dares to speak in disrespectful terms of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, and yet you refuse to tell me the name of the insulter?\"\n\n\"Sire, I thought it was quite understood that your majesty had abandoned\nthe idea of making me denounce him.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, monsieur,\" returned the king, controlling his anger;\n\"besides, I shall know in good time the name of this man whom I shall\nfeel it my duty to punish.\"\n\nManicamp perceived that they had returned to the question again. As for\nthe king, he saw he had allowed himself to be hurried away a little too\nfar, and therefore continued:--\"And I will punish him--not because there\nis any question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, although I esteem her\nvery highly--but because a lady was the object of the quarrel. And I\nintend that ladies shall be respected at my court, and that quarrels\nshall be put a stop to altogether.\"\n\nManicamp bowed.\n\n\"And now, Monsieur de Manicamp,\" continued the king, \"what was said\nabout Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\"\n\n\"Cannot your majesty guess?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Your majesty can imagine the character of the jest in which young men\npermit themselves to indulge.\"\n\n\"They very probably said that she was in love with some one?\" the king\nventured to remark.\n\n\"Probably so.\"\n\n\"But Mademoiselle de la Valliere has a perfect right to love any one she\npleases,\" said the king.\n\n\"That is the very point De Guiche maintained.\"\n\n\"And on account of which he fought, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, the sole and only cause.\"\n\nThe king colored. \"And you do not know anything more, then?\"\n\n\"In what respect, sire?\"\n\n\"In the very interesting respect which you are now referring to.\"\n\n\"What does your majesty wish to know?\"\n\n\"Why, the name of the man with whom La Valliere is in love, and whom De\nGuiche's adversary disputed her right to love.\"\n\n\"Sire, I know nothing--I have heard nothing--and have learnt nothing,\neven accidentally; but De Guiche is a noble-hearted fellow, and\nif, momentarily, he substituted himself in the place or stead of La\nValliere's protector, it was because that protector was himself of too\nexalted a position to undertake her defense.\"\n\nThese words were more than transparent; they made the king blush, but\nthis time with pleasure. He struck Manicamp gently on the shoulder.\n\"Well, well, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are not only a ready, witty\nfellow, but a brave gentleman besides, and your friend De Guiche is a\npaladin quite after my own heart; you will express that to him from me.\"\n\n\"Your majesty forgives me, then?\"\n\n\"Completely.\"\n\n\"And I am free?\"\n\nThe king smiled and held out his hand to Manicamp, which he took and\nkissed respectfully. \"And then,\" added the king, \"you relate stories so\ncharmingly.\"\n\n\"I, sire!\"\n\n\"You told me in the most admirable manner the particulars of the\naccident which happened to Guiche. I can see the wild boar rushing out\nof the wood--I can see the horse fall down fighting with his head, and\nthe boar rush from the horse to the rider. You do not simply relate a\nstory well: you positively paint its incidents.\"\n\n\"Sire, I think your majesty condescends to laugh at my expense,\" said\nManicamp.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Louis, seriously, \"I have so little intention of\nlaughing, Monsieur de Manicamp, that I wish you to relate this adventure\nto every one.\"\n\n\"The adventure of the hunt?\"\n\n\"Yes; in the same manner you told it to me, without changing a single\nword--_you understand?_\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sire.\"\n\n\"And you will relate it, then?\"\n\n\"Without losing a minute.\"\n\n\"Very well! and now summon M. d'Artagnan; I hope you are no longer\nafraid of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, from the very moment I am sure of your majesty's kind\ndisposition, I no longer fear anything!\"\n\n\"Call him, then,\" said the king.\n\nManicamp opened the door, and said, \"Gentlemen, the king wishes you to\nreturn.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, Saint-Aignan, and Valot entered.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the king, \"I summoned you for the purposes of saying\nthat Monsieur de Manicamp's explanation has entirely satisfied me.\"\n\nD'Artagnan glanced at Valot and Saint-Aignan, as much as to say, \"Well!\ndid I not tell you so?\"\n\nThe king led Manicamp to the door, and then in a low tone of voice said:\n\"See that M. de Guiche takes good care of himself, and particularly that\nhe recovers as soon as possible; I am very desirous of thanking him in\nthe name of every lady, but let him take special care that he does not\nbegin again.\"\n\n\"Were he to die a hundred times, sire, he would begin again if your\nmajesty's honor were in any way called in question.\"\n\nThis remark was direct enough. But we have already said that the incense\nof flattery was very pleasing to the king, and, provided he received it,\nhe was not very particular as to its quality.\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" he said, as he dismissed Manicamp, \"I will see\nDe Guiche myself, and make him listen to reason.\" And as Manicamp left\nthe apartment, the king turned round towards the three spectators of\nthis scene, and said, \"Tell me, Monsieur d'Artagnan, how does it happen\nthat your sight is so imperfect?--you, whose eyes are generally so very\ngood.\"\n\n\"My sight bad, sire?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"It must be the case since your majesty says so; but in what respect,\nmay I ask?\"\n\n\"Why, with regard to what occurred in the Bois-Rochin.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\"\n\n\"Certainly. You pretended to have seen the tracks of two horses, to have\ndetected the footprints of two men; and have described the particulars\nof an engagement, which you assert took place. Nothing of the sort\noccurred; pure illusion on your part.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Exactly the same thing with the galloping to and fro of the horses, and\nthe other indications of a struggle. It was the struggle of De Guiche\nagainst the wild boar, and absolutely nothing else; only the struggle\nwas a long and a terrible one, it seems.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" continued D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And when I think that I almost believed it for a moment--but, then, you\ntold it with such confidence.\"\n\n\"I admit, sire, that I must have been very short-sighted,\" said\nD'Artagnan, with a readiness of humor which delighted the king.\n\n\"You do admit it, then?\"\n\n\"Admit it, sire, most assuredly I do.\"\n\n\"So now that you see the thing--\"\n\n\"In quite a different light from that in which I saw it half an hour\nago.\"\n\n\"And to what, then, do you attribute this difference in your opinion?\"\n\n\"Oh! a very simple thing, sire; half an hour ago I returned from\nBois-Rochin, where I had nothing to light me but a stupid stable\nlantern--\"\n\n\"While now?\"\n\n\"While now I have all the wax-lights of your cabinet, and more than\nthat, your majesty's own eyes, which illuminate everything, like the\nblazing sun at noonday.\"\n\nThe king began to laugh; and Saint-Aignan broke out into convulsions of\nmerriment.\n\n\"It is precisely like M. Valot,\" said D'Artagnan, resuming the\nconversation where the king had left off; \"he has been imagining all\nalong, that not only was M. de Guiche wounded by a bullet, but still\nmore, that he extracted it, even, from his chest.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Valot, \"I assure you--\"\n\n\"Now, did you not believe that?\" continued D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valot; \"not only did I believe it, but, at this very moment,\nI would swear it.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear doctor, you have dreamt it.\"\n\n\"I have dreamt it!\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche's wound--a mere dream; the bullet, a dream. So, take my\nadvice, and prate no more about it.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" returned the king, \"M. d'Artagnan's advice is sound. Do not\nspeak of your dream to any one, Monsieur Valot, and, upon the word of\na gentleman, you will have no occasion to repent it. Good evening,\ngentlemen; a very sad affair, indeed, is a wild boar-hunt!\"\n\n\"A very serious thing, indeed,\" repeated D'Artagnan, in a loud voice,\n\"is a wild boar-hunt!\" and he repeated it in every room through which he\npassed; and left the chateau, taking Valot with him.\n\n\"And now we are alone,\" said the king to Saint-Aignan, \"what is the name\nof De Guiche's adversary?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan looked at the king.\n\n\"Oh! do not hesitate,\" said the king; \"you know that I am bound\nbeforehand to forgive.\"\n\n\"De Wardes,\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Louis XIV.; and then, retiring to his own room, added\nto himself, \"To forgive is not to forget.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XX. Showing the Advantage of Having Two Strings to One's Bow.\n\nManicamp quitted the king's apartment, delighted at having succeeded\nso well, when, just as he reached the bottom of the staircase and was\npassing a doorway, he felt that some one suddenly pulled him by the\nsleeve. He turned round and recognized Montalais, who was waiting for\nhim in the passage, and who, in a very mysterious manner, with her\nbody bent forward, and in a low tone of voice, said to him, \"Follow me,\nmonsieur, and without any delay, if you please.\"\n\n\"Where to, mademoiselle?\" inquired Manicamp.\n\n\"In the first place, a true knight would not have asked such a question,\nbut would have followed me without requiring any explanation.\"\n\n\"Well, mademoiselle, I am quite ready to conduct myself as a true\nknight.\"\n\n\"No; it is too late, and you cannot take the credit of it. We are going\nto Madame's apartment, so come at once.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Manicamp. \"Lead on, then.\"\n\nAnd he followed Montalais, who ran before him as light as Galatea.\n\n\"This time,\" said Manicamp, as he followed his guide, \"I do not think\nthat stories about hunting expeditions would be acceptable. We will try,\nhowever, and if need be--well, if there should be any occasion for it,\nwe must try something else.\"\n\nMontalais still ran on.\n\n\"How fatiguing it is,\" thought Manicamp, \"to have need of one's head and\nlegs at the same time.\"\n\nAt last, however, they arrived. Madame had just finished undressing, and\nwas in a most elegant _deshabille_, but it must be understood that she\nhad changed her dress before she had any idea of being subjected to\nthe emotions now agitating her. She was waiting with the most restless\nimpatience; and Montalais and Manicamp found her standing near the door.\nAt the sound of their approaching footsteps, Madame came forward to meet\nthem.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, \"at last!\"\n\n\"Here is M. Manicamp,\" replied Montalais.\n\nManicamp bowed with the greatest respect; Madame signed to Montalais to\nwithdraw, and she immediately obeyed. Madame followed her with her eyes,\nin silence, until the door closed behind her, and then, turning towards\nManicamp, said, \"What is the matter?--and is it true, as I am told,\nMonsieur de Manicamp, that some one is lying wounded in the chateau?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, unfortunately so--Monsieur de Guiche.\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur de Guiche,\" repeated the princess. \"I had, in fact,\nheard it rumored, but not confirmed. And so, in truth, it is Monsieur de\nGuiche who has been thus unfortunate?\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche himself, Madame.\"\n\n\"Are you aware, M. de Manicamp,\" said the princess, hastily, \"that the\nking has the strongest antipathy to duels?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so, Madame; but a duel with a wild beast is not answerable.\"\n\n\"Oh, you will not insult me by supposing that I credit the absurd fable,\nwith what object I cannot tell, respecting M. de Guiche having been\nwounded by a wild boar. No, no, monsieur; the real truth is known, and,\nin addition to the inconvenience of his wound, M. de Guiche runs the\nrisk of losing his liberty if not his life.\"\n\n\"Alas! Madame, I am well aware of that, but what is to be done?\"\n\n\"You have seen the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"What did you say to him?\"\n\n\"I told him how M. de Guiche went to the chase, and how a wild boar\nrushed forth out of the Bois-Rochin; how M. de Guiche fired at it, and\nhow, in fact, the furious brute dashed at De Guiche, killed his horse,\nand grievously wounded himself.\"\n\n\"And the king believed that?\"\n\n\"Implicitly.\"\n\n\"Oh, you surprise me, Monsieur de Manicamp; you surprise me very much.\"\n\nAnd Madame walked up and down the room, casting a searching look from\ntime to time at Manicamp, who remained motionless and impassible in the\nsame place. At last she stopped.\n\n\"And yet,\" she said, \"every one here seems unanimous in giving another\ncause for this wound.\"\n\n\"What cause, Madame?\" said Manicamp; \"may I be permitted, without\nindiscretion, to ask your highness?\"\n\n\"You ask such a question! You, M. de Guiche's intimate friend, his\nconfidant, indeed!\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame! his intimate friend--yes; confidant--no. De Guiche is a man\nwho can keep his own secrets, who has some of his own certainly, but who\nnever breathes a syllable about them. De Guiche is discretion itself,\nMadame.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; those secrets which M. de Guiche keeps so\nscrupulously, I shall have the pleasure of informing you of,\" said the\nprincess, almost spitefully; \"for the king may possibly question you a\nsecond time, and if, on the second occasion, you were to repeat the same\nstory to him, he possibly might not be very well satisfied with it.\"\n\n\"But, Madame, I think your highness is mistaken with regard to the king.\nHis majesty was perfectly satisfied with me, I assure you.\"\n\n\"In that case, permit me to assure you, Monsieur de Manicamp, it only\nproves one thing, which is, that his majesty is very easily satisfied.\"\n\n\"I think your highness is mistaken in arriving at such an opinion; his\nmajesty is well known not to be contented except with very good reason.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose that he will thank you for your officious falsehood,\nwhen he will learn to-morrow that M. de Guiche had, on behalf of his\nfriend M. de Bragelonne, a quarrel which ended in a hostile meeting?\"\n\n\"A quarrel on M. de Bragelonne's account,\" said Manicamp, with the most\ninnocent expression in the world; \"what does your royal highness do me\nthe honor to tell me?\"\n\n\"What is there astonishing in that? M. de Guiche is susceptible,\nirritable, and easily loses his temper.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Madame, I know M. de Guiche to be very patient, and\nnever susceptible or irritable except upon very good grounds.\"\n\n\"But is not friendship a just ground?\" said the princess.\n\n\"Oh, certainly, Madame; and particularly for a heart like his.\"\n\n\"Very good; you will not deny, I suppose, that M. de Bragelonne is M. de\nGuiche's good friend?\"\n\n\"A great friend.\"\n\n\"Well, then, M. de Guiche has taken M. de Bragelonne's part; and as M.\nde Bragelonne was absent and could not fight, he fought for him.\"\n\nManicamp began to smile, and moved his head and shoulders very slightly,\nas much as to say, \"Oh, if you will positively have it so--\"\n\n\"But speak, at all events,\" said the princess, out of patience; \"speak!\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Of course; it is quite clear you are not of my opinion, and that you\nhave something to say.\"\n\n\"I have only one thing to say, Madame.\"\n\n\"Name it!\"\n\n\"That I do not understand a single word of what you have just been\ntelling me.\"\n\n\"What!--you do not understand a single word about M. de Guiche's quarrel\nwith M. de Wardes,\" exclaimed the princess, almost out of temper.\n\nManicamp remained silent.\n\n\"A quarrel,\" she continued, \"which arose out of a conversation\nscandalous in its tone and purport, and more or less well founded,\nrespecting the virtue of a certain lady.\"\n\n\"Ah! of a certain lady,--this is quite another thing,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"You begin to understand, do you not?\"\n\n\"Your highness will excuse me, but I dare not--\"\n\n\"You dare not,\" said Madame, exasperated; \"very well, then, wait one\nmoment, I will dare.\"\n\n\"Madame, Madame!\" exclaimed Manicamp, as if in great dismay, \"be careful\nof what you are going to say.\"\n\n\"It would seem, monsieur, that, if I happened to be a man, you would\nchallenge me, notwithstanding his majesty's edicts, as Monsieur de\nGuiche challenged M. de Wardes; and that, too, on account of the virtue\nof Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Of Mademoiselle de la Valliere!\" exclaimed Manicamp, starting\nbackwards, as if that was the very last name he expected to hear\npronounced.\n\n\"What makes you start in that manner, Monsieur de Manicamp?\" said\nMadame, ironically; \"do you mean to say you would be impertinent enough\nto suspect that young lady's honor?\"\n\n\"Madame, in the whole course of this affair there has not been the\nslightest question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere's honor.\"\n\n\"What! when two men have almost blown each other's brains out on a\nwoman's behalf, do you mean to say she has had nothing to do with the\naffair, and that her name has not been called in question at all? I did\nnot think you so good a courtier, Monsieur de Manicamp.\"\n\n\"Pray forgive me, Madame,\" said the young man, \"but we are very far from\nunderstanding one another. You do me the honor to speak one language\nwhile I am speaking altogether another.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but I do not understand your meaning.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, then; but I fancied I understood your highness to remark\nthat De Guiche and De Wardes had fought on Mademoiselle de la Valliere's\naccount?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"On account of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, I think you said?\" repeated\nManicamp.\n\n\"I do not say that M. de Guiche personally took an interest in\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, but I say that he did so as representing or\nacting on behalf of another.\"\n\n\"On behalf of another?\"\n\n\"Come, do not always assume such a bewildered look. Does not every\none here know that M. de Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, and that before he went on the mission with which the king\nintrusted him, he charged his friend M. de Guiche to watch over that\ninteresting young lady?\"\n\n\"There is nothing more for me to say, then. Your highness is\nwell-informed.\"\n\n\"Of everything. I beg you to understand that clearly.\"\n\nManicamp began to laugh, which almost exasperated the princess, who was\nnot, as we know, of a very patient disposition.\n\n\"Madame,\" resumed the discreet Manicamp, saluting the princess, \"let us\nbury this affair altogether in forgetfulness, for it will probably never\nbe quite cleared up.\"\n\n\"Oh, as far as that goes there is nothing more to do, and the\ninformation is complete. The king will learn that M. de Guiche has taken\nup the cause of this little adventuress, who gives herself all the\nairs of a grand lady; he will learn that Monsieur de Bragelonne, having\nnominated his friend M. de Guiche his guardian-in-ordinary, the latter\nimmediately fastened, as he was required to do, upon the Marquis de\nWardes, who ventured to trench upon his privileges. Moreover, you\ncannot pretend to deny, Monsieur Manicamp--you who know everything so\nwell--that the king on his side casts a longing eye upon this famous\ntreasure, and that he will bear no slight grudge against M. de Guiche\nfor constituting himself its defender. Are you sufficiently well\ninformed now, or do you require anything further? If so, speak,\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"No, Madame, there is nothing more I wish to know.\"\n\n\"Learn, however--for you ought to know it, Monsieur de Manicamp--learn\nthat his majesty's indignation will be followed by terrible\nconsequences. In princes of a similar temperament to that of his\nmajesty, the passion which jealousy causes sweeps down like a\nwhirlwind.\"\n\n\"Which you will temper, Madame.\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed the princess, with a gesture of indescribable irony; \"I!\nand by what title, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Because you detest injustice, Madame.\"\n\n\"And according to your account, then, it would be an injustice to\nprevent the king arranging his love affairs as he pleases.\"\n\n\"You will intercede, however, in M. de Guiche's favor?\"\n\n\"You are mad, monsieur,\" said the princess, in a haughty tone of voice.\n\n\"On the contrary, I am in the most perfect possession of my senses; and\nI repeat, you will defend M. de Guiche before the king.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\"\n\n\"Because the cause of M. de Guiche is your own, Madame,\" said Manicamp,\nwith ardor kindling in his eyes.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I mean, Madame, that, with respect to the defense which Monsieur de\nGuiche undertook in M. de Bragelonne's absence, I am surprised that your\nhighness has not detected a pretext in La Valliere's name having been\nbrought forward.\"\n\n\"A pretext? But a pretext for what?\" repeated the princess,\nhesitatingly, for Manicamp's steady look had just revealed something of\nthe truth to her.\n\n\"I trust, Madame,\" said the young man, \"I have said sufficient to induce\nyour highness not to overwhelm before his majesty my poor friend, De\nGuiche, against whom all the malevolence of a party bitterly opposed to\nyour own will now be directed.\"\n\n\"You mean, on the contrary, I suppose, that all those who have no great\naffection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and even, perhaps, a few of\nthose who have some regard for her, will be angry with the comte?\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame! why will you push your obstinacy to such an extent, and\nrefuse to open your ears and listen to the counsel of one whose\ndevotion to you is unbounded? Must I expose myself to the risk of your\ndispleasure,--am I really to be called upon to name, contrary to my own\nwish, the person who was the real cause of this quarrel?\"\n\n\"The person?\" said Madame, blushing.\n\n\"Must I,\" continued Manicamp, \"tell you how poor De Guiche became\nirritated, furious, exasperated beyond all control, at the different\nrumors now being circulated about this person? Must I, if you persist\nin this willful blindness, and if respect should continue to prevent me\nnaming her,--must I, I repeat, recall to your recollection the\nvarious scenes which Monsieur had with the Duke of Buckingham, and the\ninsinuations which were reported respecting the duke's exile? Must I\nremind you of the anxious care the comte always took in his efforts to\nplease, to watch, to protect that person for whom alone he lives,--for\nwhom alone he breathes? Well! I will do so; and when I shall have made\nyou recall all the particulars I refer to, you will perhaps understand\nhow it happened that the comte, having lost all control over himself,\nand having been for some time past almost harassed to death by De\nWardes, became, at the first disrespectful expression which the latter\npronounced respecting the person in question, inflamed with passion, and\npanted only for an opportunity of avenging the affront.\"\n\nThe princess concealed her face with her hands. \"Monsieur, monsieur!\"\nshe exclaimed; \"do you know what you are saying, and to whom you are\nspeaking?\"\n\n\"And so, Madame,\" pursued Manicamp, as if he had not heard the\nexclamations of the princess, \"nothing will astonish you any\nlonger,--neither the comte's ardor in seeking the quarrel, nor his\nwonderful address in transferring it to a quarter foreign to your own\npersonal interests. That latter circumstance was, indeed, a marvelous\ninstance of tact and perfect coolness, and if the person in whose\nbehalf the comte so fought and shed his blood does, in reality, owe\nsome gratitude to the poor wounded sufferer, it is not on account of the\nblood he has shed, or the agony he has suffered, but for the steps he\nhas taken to preserve from comment or reflection an honor which is more\nprecious to him than his own.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Madame, as if she had been alone, \"is it possible the\nquarrel was on my account!\"\n\nManicamp felt he could now breathe for a moment--and gallantly had he\nwon the right to do so. Madame, on her side, remained for some time\nplunged in a painful reverie. Her agitation could be seen by her quick\nrespiration, by her drooping eyelids, by the frequency with which she\npressed her hand upon her heart. But, in her, coquetry was not so much\na passive quality, as, on the contrary, a fire which sought for fuel to\nmaintain itself, finding anywhere and everywhere what it required.\n\n\"If it be as you assert,\" she said, \"the comte will have obliged two\npersons at the same time; for Monsieur de Bragelonne also owes a deep\ndebt of gratitude to M. de Guiche--and with far greater reason, indeed,\nbecause everywhere, and on every occasion, Mademoiselle de la Valliere\nwill be regarded as having been defended by this generous champion.\"\n\nManicamp perceived that there still remained some lingering doubt in the\nprincess's heart. \"A truly admirable service, indeed,\" he said, \"is the\none he has rendered to Mademoiselle de la Valliere! A truly admirable\nservice to M. de Bragelonne! The duel has created a sensation which, in\nsome respects, casts a dishonorable suspicion upon that young girl;\na sensation, indeed, which will embroil her with the vicomte. The\nconsequence is that De Wardes's pistol-bullet has had three results\ninstead of one; it destroys at the same time the honor of a woman, the\nhappiness of a man, and, perhaps, it has wounded to death one of\nthe best gentlemen in France. Oh, Madame! your logic is cold--even\ncalculating; it always condemns--it never absolves.\"\n\nManicamp's concluding words scattered to the winds the last doubt which\nlingered, not in Madame's heart, but in her mind. She was no longer\na princess full of scruples, nor a woman with her ever-returning\nsuspicions, but one whose heart has just felt the mortal chill of a\nwound. \"Wounded to death!\" she murmured, in a faltering voice, \"oh,\nMonsieur de Manicamp! did you not say, wounded to death?\"\n\nManicamp returned no other answer than a deep sigh.\n\n\"And so you said that the comte is dangerously wounded?\" continued the\nprincess.\n\n\"Yes, Madame; one of his hands is shattered, and he has a bullet lodged\nin his breast.\"\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" resumed the princess, with a feverish excitement,\n\"this is horrible! Monsieur de Manicamp! a hand shattered, do you say,\nand a bullet in his breast? And that coward! that wretch! that assassin,\nDe Wardes, did it!\"\n\nManicamp seemed overcome by a violent emotion. He had, in fact,\ndisplayed no little energy in the latter part of his speech. As for\nMadame, she entirely threw aside all regard for the formal observances\nof propriety society imposes; for when, with her, passion spoke\nin accents either of anger or sympathy, nothing could restrain her\nimpulses. Madame approached Manicamp, who had subsided in a chair, as if\nhis grief were a sufficiently powerful excuse for his infraction of the\nlaws of etiquette. \"Monsieur,\" she said, seizing him by the hand, \"be\nfrank with me.\"\n\nManicamp looked up.\n\n\"Is M. de Guiche in danger of death?\"\n\n\"Doubly so, Madame,\" he replied; \"in the first place on account of the\nhemorrhage which has taken place, an artery having been injured in the\nhand; and next, in consequence of the wound in his breast, which may,\nthe doctor is afraid, at least, have injured some vital part.\"\n\n\"He may die, then?\"\n\n\"Die, yes, Madame; and without even having had the consolation of\nknowing that you have been told of his devotion.\"\n\n\"You will tell him.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes; are you not his friend?\"\n\n\"I? oh, no, Madame; I will only tell M. de Guiche--if, indeed, he is\nstill in a condition to hear me--I will only tell him what I have seen;\nthat is, your cruelty to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, you will not be guilty of such barbarity!\"\n\n\"Indeed, Madame, I shall speak the truth, for nature is very energetic\nin a man of his age. The physicians are clever men, and if, by chance,\nthe poor comte should survive his wound, I should not wish him to die of\na wound of the heart, after surviving one of the body.\" Manicamp rose,\nand with an expression of profoundest respect, seemed to be desirous of\ntaking leave.\n\n\"At least, monsieur,\" said Madame, stopping him with almost a suppliant\nair, \"you will be kind enough to tell me in what state your wounded\nfriend is, and who is the physician who attends him?\"\n\n\"As regards the state he is in, Madame, he is seriously ill; his\nphysician is M. Valot, his majesty's private medical attendant. M. Valot\nis moreover assisted by a professional friend, to whose house M. de\nGuiche has been carried.\"\n\n\"What! he is not in the chateau?\" said Madame.\n\n\"Alas, Madame! the poor fellow was so ill, that he could not even be\nconveyed thither.\"\n\n\"Give me the address, monsieur,\" said the princess, hurriedly; \"I will\nsend to inquire after him.\"\n\n\"Rue du Feurre; a brick-built house, with white outside blinds. The\ndoctor's name is on the door.\"\n\n\"You are returning to your wounded friend, Monsieur de Manicamp?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"You will be able, then, to do me a service.\"\n\n\"I am at your highness's orders.\"\n\n\"Do what you intended to do; return to M. de Guiche, send away all those\nwhom you may find there, and have the kindness yourself to go away too.\"\n\n\"Madame--\"\n\n\"Let us waste no time in useless explanations. Accept the fact as I\npresent it to you; see nothing in it beyond what is really there, and\nask nothing further than what I tell you. I am going to send one of my\nladies, perhaps two, because it is now getting late; I do not wish them\nto see you, or rather I do not wish you to see them. These are scruples\nyou can understand--you particularly, Monsieur de Manicamp, who seem\ncapable of divining so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame, perfectly; I can even do better still,--I will precede, or\nrather walk, in advance of your attendants; it will, at the same time,\nbe the means of showing them the way more accurately, and of protecting\nthem, if occasion arises, though there is no probability of their\nneeding protection.\"\n\n\"And, by this means, then, they would be sure of entering without\ndifficulty, would they not?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Madame; for as I should be the first to pass, I thus remove\nany difficulties that might chance to be in the way.\"\n\n\"Very well. Go, go, Monsieur de Manicamp, and wait at the bottom of the\nstaircase.\"\n\n\"I go at once, Madame.\"\n\n\"Stay.\"\n\nManicamp paused.\n\n\"When you hear the footsteps of two women descending the stairs, go out,\nand, without once turning round, take the road which leads to where the\npoor count is lying.\"\n\n\"But if, by any mischance, two other persons were to descend, and I were\nto be mistaken?\"\n\n\"You will hear one of the two clap her hands together softly. Go.\"\n\nManicamp turned round, bowed once more, and left the room, his heart\noverflowing with joy. In fact, he knew very well that the presence of\nMadame herself would be the best balm to apply to his friend's wounds. A\nquarter of an hour had hardly elapsed when he heard the sound of a door\nopened softly, and closed with like precaution. He listened to the light\nfootfalls gliding down the staircase, and then heard the signal agreed\nupon. He immediately went out, and, faithful to his promise, bent\nhis way, without once turning his head, through the streets of\nFontainebleau, towards the doctor's dwelling.\n\n\n\nChapter XXI. M. Malicorne the Keeper of the Records of France.\n\nTwo women, their figures completely concealed by their mantles, and\nwhose masks effectually hid the upper portion of their faces, timidly\nfollowed Manicamp's steps. On the first floor, behind curtains of\nred damask, the soft light of a lamp placed upon a low table faintly\nillumined the room, at the other extremity of which, on a large bedstead\nsupported by spiral columns, around which curtains of the same color as\nthose which deadened the rays of the lamp had been closely drawn, lay De\nGuiche, his head supported by pillows, his eyes looking as if the mists\nof death were gathering; his long black hair, scattered over the pillow,\nset off the young man's hollow temples. It was easy to see that fever\nwas the chief tenant of the chamber. De Guiche was dreaming. His\nwandering mind was pursuing, through gloom and mystery, one of those\nwild creations delirium engenders. Two or three drops of blood, still\nliquid, stained the floor. Manicamp hurriedly ran up the stairs, but\npaused at the threshold of the door, looked into the room, and seeing\nthat everything was perfectly quiet, he advanced towards the foot of the\nlarge leathern armchair, a specimen of furniture of the reign of Henry\nIV., and seeing that the nurse, as a matter of course, had dropped off\nto sleep, he awoke her, and begged her to pass into the adjoining room.\n\nThen, standing by the side of the bed, he remained for a moment\ndeliberating whether it would be better to awaken Guiche, in order to\nacquaint him with the good news. But, as he began to hear behind the\ndoor the rustling of silk dresses and the hurried breathing of his two\ncompanions, and as he already saw that the curtain screening the doorway\nseemed on the point of being impatiently drawn aside, he passed round\nthe bed and followed the nurse into the next room. As soon as he had\ndisappeared the curtain was raised, and his two female companions\nentered the room he had just left. The one who entered first made a\ngesture to her companion, which riveted her to the spot where she stood,\nclose to the door, and then resolutely advanced towards the bed, drew\nback the curtains along the iron rod, and threw them in thick folds\nbehind the head of the bed. She gazed upon the comte's pallid face;\nremarked his right hand enveloped in linen whose dazzling whiteness was\nemphasized by the counterpane patterned with dark leaves thrown across\nthe couch. She shuddered as she saw a stain of blood growing larger\nand larger upon the bandages. The young man's breast was uncovered,\nas though for the cool night air to assist his respiration. A narrow\nbandage fastened the dressings of the wound, around which a purplish\ncircle of extravasated blood was gradually increasing in size. A deep\nsigh broke from her lips. She leaned against one of the columns of the\nbed, and gazed, through the apertures in her mask, upon the harrowing\nspectacle before her. A hoarse harsh groan passed like a death-rattle\nthrough the comte's clenched teeth. The masked lady seized his left\nhand, which scorched like burning coals. But at the very moment she\nplaced her icy hand upon it, the action of the cold was such that De\nGuiche opened his eyes, and by a look in which revived intelligence\nwas dawning, seemed as though struggling back again into existence. The\nfirst thing upon which he fixed his gaze was this phantom standing erect\nby his bedside. At that sight, his eyes became dilated, but without any\nappearance of consciousness in them. The lady thereupon made a sign to\nher companion, who had remained at the door; and in all probability the\nlatter had already received her lesson, for in a clear tone of\nvoice, and without any hesitation whatever, she pronounced these\nwords:--\"Monsieur le comte, her royal highness Madame is desirous of\nknowing how you are able to bear your wound, and to express to you, by\nmy lips, her great regret at seeing you suffer.\"\n\nAs she pronounced the word Madame, Guiche started; he had not as yet\nremarked the person to whom the voice belonged, and he naturally turned\ntowards the direction whence it preceded. But, as he felt the cold hand\nstill resting on his own, he again turned towards the motionless figure\nbeside him. \"Was it you who spoke, madame?\" he asked, in a weak voice,\n\"or is there another person in beside you in the room?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the figure, in an almost unintelligible voice, as she\nbent down her head.\n\n\"Well,\" said the wounded man, with a great effort, \"I thank you. Tell\nMadame that I no longer regret to die, since she has remembered me.\"\n\nAt the words \"to die,\" pronounced by one whose life seemed to hang on a\nthread, the masked lady could not restrain her tears, which flowed under\nthe mask, and appeared upon her cheeks just where the mask left her face\nbare. If De Guiche had been in fuller possession of his senses, he would\nhave seen her tears roll like glistening pearls, and fall upon his bed.\nThe lady, forgetting that she wore her mask, raised her hand as though\nto wipe her eyes, and meeting the rough velvet, she tore away her mask\nin anger, and threw it on the floor. At the unexpected apparition before\nhim, which seemed to issue from a cloud, De Guiche uttered a cry and\nstretched his arms towards her; but every word perished on his lips, and\nhis strength seemed utterly abandoning him. His right hand, which had\nfollowed his first impulse, without calculating the amount of strength\nhe had left, fell back again upon the bed, and immediately afterwards\nthe white linen was stained with a larger spot than before. In the\nmeantime, the young man's eyes became dim, and closed, as if he were\nalready struggling with the messenger of death; and then, after a few\ninvoluntary movements, his head fell back motionless on his pillow; his\nface grew livid. The lady was frightened; but on this occasion, contrary\nto what is usually the case, fear attracted. She leaned over the young\nman, gazed earnestly, fixedly at his pale, cold face, which she almost\ntouched, then imprinted a rapid kiss upon De Guiche's left hand, who,\ntrembling as if an electric shock had passed through him, awoke a second\ntime, opened his large eyes, incapable of recognition, and again\nfell into a state of complete insensibility. \"Come,\" she said to her\ncompanion, \"we must not remain here any longer; I shall be committing\nsome folly or other.\"\n\n\"Madame, Madame, your highness is forgetting your mask!\" said her\nvigilant companion.\n\n\"Pick it up,\" replied her mistress, as she tottered almost senseless\ntowards the staircase, and as the outer door had been left only\nhalf-closed, the two women, light as birds, passed through it, and\nwith hurried steps returned to the palace. One of them ascended towards\nMadame's apartments, where she disappeared; the other entered the rooms\nbelonging to the maids of honor, namely, on the _entresol_, and having\nreached her own room, she sat down before a table, and without giving\nherself time even to breathe, wrote the following letter:\n\n\"This evening Madame has been to see M. de Guiche. Everything is going\nwell on this side. See that your news is equally exemplary, and do not\nforget to burn this paper.\"\n\nShe folded the letter, and leaving her room with every possible\nprecaution, crossed a corridor which led to the apartments appropriated\nto the gentlemen attached to Monsieur's service. She stopped before a\ndoor, under which, having previously knocked twice in a short, quick\nmanner, she thrust the paper, and fled. Then, returning to her own\nroom, she removed every trace of her having gone out, and also of\nhaving written the letter. Amid the investigations she was so diligently\npursuing she perceived on the table the mask which belonged to Madame,\nand which, according to her mistress's directions, she had brought back\nbut had forgotten to restore to her. \"Oh, oh!\" she said, \"I must not\nforget to do to-morrow what I have forgotten to-day.\"\n\nAnd she took hold of the velvet mask by that part which covered the\ncheeks, and feeling that her thumb was wet, looked at it. It was not\nonly wet, but reddened. The mask had fallen upon one of the spots of\nblood which, we have already said, stained the floor, and from that\nblack velvet outside which had accidentally come into contact with\nit, the blood had passed through to the inside, and stained the white\ncambric lining. \"Oh, oh!\" said Montalais, for doubtless our readers have\nalready recognized her by these various maneuvers, \"I shall not give\nback this mask; it is far too precious now.\"\n\nAnd rising from her seat, she ran towards a box made of maple wood,\nwhich inclosed different articles of toilette and perfumery. \"No, not\nhere,\" she said, \"such a treasure must not be abandoned to the slightest\nchance of detection.\"\n\nThen, after a moment's silence, and with a smile that was peculiarly her\nown, she added:--\"Beautiful mask, stained with the blood of that brave\nknight, you shall go and join that collection of wonders, La Valliere's\nand Raoul's letters, that loving collection, indeed, which will some day\nor other form part of the history of France, of European royalty. You\nshall be placed under M. Malicorne's care,\" said the laughing girl, as\nshe began to undress herself, \"under the protection of that worthy M.\nMalicorne,\" she said, blowing out the taper, \"who thinks he was born\nonly to become the chief usher of Monsieur's apartments, and whom I will\nmake keeper of the records and historiographer of the house of Bourbon,\nand of the first houses in the kingdom. Let him grumble now, that\ndiscontented Malicorne,\" she added, as she drew the curtains and fell\nasleep.\n\n\n\nChapter XXII. The Journey.\n\nThe next day being agreed upon for the departure, the king, at eleven\no'clock precisely, descended the grand staircase with the two queens and\nMadame, in order to enter his carriage drawn by six horses, that were\npawing the ground in impatience at the foot of the staircase. The whole\ncourt awaited the royal appearance in the _Fer-a-cheval_ crescent,\nin their travelling costumes; the large number of saddled horses and\ncarriages of ladies and gentlemen of the court, surrounded by their\nattendants, servants, and pages, formed a spectacle whose brilliancy\ncould scarcely be equalled. The king entered his carriage with the two\nqueens; Madame was in the same one with Monsieur. The maids of honor\nfollowed their example, and took their seats, two by two, in the\ncarriages destined for them. The weather was exceedingly warm; a light\nbreeze, which, early in the morning, all had thought would have proved\nsufficient to cool the air, soon became fiercely heated by the rays of\nthe sun, although it was hidden behind the clouds, and filtered through\nthe heated vapor which rose from the ground like a scorching wind,\nbearing particles of fine dust against the faces of the travelers.\nMadame was the first to complain of the heat. Monsieur's only reply was\nto throw himself back in the carriage as though about to faint, and to\ninundate himself with scents and perfumes, uttering the deepest sighs\nall the while; whereupon Madame said to him, with her most amiable\nexpression:--\"Really, Monsieur, I fancied that you would have been\npolite enough, on account of the terrible heat, to have left me my\ncarriage to myself, and to have performed the journey yourself on\nhorseback.\"\n\n\"Ride on horseback!\" cried the prince, with an accent of dismay which\nshowed how little idea he had of adopting this unnatural advice; \"you\ncannot suppose such a thing, Madame! My skin would peel off if I were to\nexpose myself to such a burning breeze as this.\"\n\nMadame began to laugh.\n\n\"You can take my parasol,\" she said.\n\n\"But the trouble of holding it!\" replied Monsieur, with the greatest\ncoolness; \"besides, I have no horse.\"\n\n\"What, no horse?\" replied the princess, who, if she did not secure the\nsolitude she required, at least obtained the amusement of teasing.\n\"No horse! You are mistaken, Monsieur; for I see your favorite bay out\nyonder.\"\n\n\"My bay horse!\" exclaimed the prince, attempting to lean forward to look\nout of the door; but the movement he was obliged to make cost him so\nmuch trouble that he soon hastened to resume his immobility.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madame; \"your horse, led by M. de Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Poor beast,\" replied the prince; \"how warm it must be!\"\n\nAnd with these words he closed his eyes, like a man on the point of\ndeath. Madame, on her side, reclined indolently in the other corner of\nthe carriage, and closed her eyes also, not, however, to sleep, but to\nthink more at her ease. In the meantime the king, seated in the front\nseat of his carriage, the back of which he had yielded up to the two\nqueens, was a prey to that feverish contrariety experienced by anxious\nlovers, who, without being able to quench their ardent thirst, are\nceaselessly desirous of seeing the loved object, and then go away\npartially satisfied, without perceiving they have acquired a more\ninsatiable thirst than ever. The king, whose carriage headed the\nprocession, could not from the place he occupied perceive the carriages\nof the ladies and maids of honor, which followed in a line behind it.\nBesides, he was obliged to answer the eternal questions of the young\nqueen, who, happy to have with her \"_her dear husband_,\" as she called\nhim in utter forgetfulness of royal etiquette, invested him with all her\naffection, stifled him with her attentions, afraid that some one might\ncome to take him from her, or that he himself might suddenly take a\nfancy to quit her society. Anne of Austria, whom nothing at that moment\noccupied except the occasional cruel throbbings in her bosom, looked\npleased and delighted, and although she perfectly realized the king's\nimpatience, tantalizingly prolonged his sufferings by unexpectedly\nresuming the conversation at the very moment the king, absorbed in his\nown reflections, began to muse over his secret attachment. Everything\nseemed to combine--not alone the little teasing attentions of the queen,\nbut also the queen-mother's interruptions--to make the king's position\nalmost insupportable; for he knew not how to control the restless\nlongings of his heart. At first, he complained of the heat--a complaint\nmerely preliminary to others, but with sufficient tact to prevent\nMaria Theresa guessing his real object. Understanding the king's remark\nliterally, she began to fan him with her ostrich plumes. But the heat\npassed away, and the king then complained of cramps and stiffness in his\nlegs, and as the carriages at that moment stopped to change horses, the\nqueen said:--\"Shall I get out with you? I too feel tired of sitting. We\ncan walk on a little distance; the carriage will overtake us, and we can\nresume our places presently.\"\n\nThe king frowned; it is a hard trial a jealous woman makes her husband\nsubmit to whose fidelity she suspects, when, although herself a prey\nto jealousy, she watches herself so narrowly that she avoids giving any\npretext for an angry feeling. The king, therefore, in the present case,\ncould not refuse; he accepted the offer, alighted from the carriage,\ngave his arm to the queen, and walked up and down with her while the\nhorses were being changed. As he walked along, he cast an envious glance\nupon the courtiers, who were fortunate enough to be on horseback. The\nqueen soon found out that the promenade she had suggested afforded\nthe king as little pleasure as he had experienced from driving. She\naccordingly expressed a wish to return to her carriage, and the king\nconducted her to the door, but did not get in with her. He stepped back\na few paces, and looked along the file of carriages for the purpose of\nrecognizing the one in which he took so strong an interest. At the door\nof the sixth carriage he saw La Valliere's fair countenance. As the\nking thus stood motionless, wrapt in thought, without perceiving that\neverything was ready, and that he alone was causing the delay, he heard\na voice close beside him, addressing him in the most respectful manner.\nIt was M. Malicorne, in a complete costume of an equerry, holding over\nhis left arm the bridles of a couple of horses.\n\n\"Your majesty asked for a horse, I believe,\" he said.\n\n\"A horse? Have you one of my horses here?\" inquired the king, trying\nto remember the person who addressed him, and whose face was not as yet\nfamiliar to him.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Malicorne, \"at all events I have a horse here which is\nat your majesty's service.\"\n\nAnd Malicorne pointed at Monsieur's bay horse, which Madame had\nobserved. It was a beautiful creature royally caparisoned.\n\n\"This is not one of my horses, monsieur,\" said the king.\n\n\"Sire, it is a horse out of his royal highness's stables; but he does\nnot ride when the weather is as hot as it is now.\"\n\nLouis did not reply, but approached the horse, which stood pawing the\nground with its foot. Malicorne hastened to hold the stirrup for him,\nbut the king was already in the saddle. Restored to good-humor by this\nlucky accident, the king hastened towards the queen's carriage, where he\nwas anxiously expected; and notwithstanding Maria Theresa's thoughtful\nand preoccupied air, he said: \"I have been fortunate enough to find\nthis horse, and I intend to avail myself of it. I felt stifled in the\ncarriage. Adieu, ladies.\"\n\nThen bending gracefully over the arched neck of his beautiful steed,\nhe disappeared in a second. Anne of Austria leaned forward, in order\nto look after him as he rode away; he did not get very far, for when he\nreached the sixth carriage, he reined in his horse suddenly and took off\nhis hat. He saluted La Valliere, who uttered a cry of surprise as\nshe saw him, blushing at the same time with pleasure. Montalais, who\noccupied the other seat in the carriage, made the king a most respectful\nbow. And then, with all the tact of a woman, she pretended to be\nexceedingly interested in the landscape, and withdrew herself into the\nleft-hand corner. The conversation between the king and La Valliere\nbegan, as all lovers' conversations generally do, namely, by eloquent\nlooks and by a few words utterly devoid of common sense. The king\nexplained how warm he had felt in his carriage, so much so indeed that\nhe could almost regard the horse he then rode as a blessing thrown in\nhis way. \"And,\" he added, \"my benefactor is an exceedingly intelligent\nman, for he seemed to guess my thoughts intuitively. I have now only\none wish, that of learning the name of the gentleman who so cleverly\nassisted his king out of his dilemma, and extricated him from his cruel\nposition.\"\n\nMontalais, during this colloquy, the first words of which had awakened\nher attention, had slightly altered her position, and contrived so as\nto meet the king's look as he finished his remark. It followed very\nnaturally that the king looked inquiringly as much at her as at La\nValliere; she had every reason to suppose that it was herself who\nwas appealed to, and consequently might be permitted to answer. She\ntherefore said: \"Sire, the horse which your majesty is riding belongs to\nMonsieur, and was being led by one of his royal highness's gentlemen.\"\n\n\"And what is that gentleman's name, may I ask, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"M. de Malicorne, sire.\"\n\nThe name produced its usual effect, for the king repeated it smilingly.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Aure. \"Stay, it is the gentleman who is galloping\non my left hand;\" and she pointed out Malicorne, who, with a very\nsanctified expression, was galloping by the side of the carriage,\nknowing perfectly well that they were talking of him at that very\nmoment, but sitting in his saddle as if he were deaf and dumb.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king, \"that is the gentleman; I remember his face, and\nwill not forget his name;\" and the king looked tenderly at La Valliere.\n\nAure had now nothing further to do; she had let Malicorne's name fall;\nthe soil was good; all that was now left to be done was to let the\nname take root, and the event would bear fruit in due season. She\nconsequently threw herself back in her corner, feeling perfectly\njustified in making as many agreeable signs of recognition as she liked\nto Malicorne, since the latter had had the happiness of pleasing the\nking. As will readily be believed, Montalais was not mistaken; and\nMalicorne, with his quick ear and his sly look, seemed to interpret\nher remark as \"All goes on well,\" the whole being accompanied by a\npantomimic action, which he fancied conveyed something resembling a\nkiss.\n\n\"Alas! mademoiselle,\" said the king, after a moment's pause, \"the\nliberty and freedom of the country is soon about to cease; your\nattendance on Madame will be more strictly enforced, and we shall see\neach other no more.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is too much attached to Madame,\" replied Louise, \"not to\ncome and see her very frequently; and whenever your majesty may chance\nto pass across the apartments--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, in a tender voice, which was gradually lowered in\nits tone, \"to perceive is not to see, and yet it seems that it would be\nquite sufficient for you.\"\n\nLouise did not answer a syllable; a sigh filled her heart almost to\nbursting, but she stifled it.\n\n\"You exercise a great control over yourself,\" said the king to Louise,\nwho smiled upon him with a melancholy expression. \"Exert the strength\nyou have in loving fondly,\" he continued, \"and I will bless Heaven for\nhaving bestowed it on you.\"\n\nLa Valliere still remained silent, but raised her eyes, brimful of\naffection, toward the king. Louis, as if overcome by this burning\nglance, passed his hand across his forehead, and pressing the sides\nof his horse with his knees, made him bound several paces forward. La\nValliere, leaning back in her carriage, with her eyes half closed, gazed\nfixedly upon the king, whose plumes were floating in the air; she could\nnot but admire his graceful carriage, his delicate and nervous limbs\nwhich pressed his horse's sides, and the regular outline of his\nfeatures, which his beautiful curling hair set off to great advantage,\nrevealing occasionally his small and well-formed ear. In fact the poor\ngirl was in love, and she reveled in her innocent affection. In a few\nmoments the king was again by her side.\n\n\"Do you not perceive,\" he said, \"how terribly your silence affects me?\nOh! mademoiselle, how pitilessly inexorable you would become if you were\never to resolve to break off all acquaintance with any one; and then,\ntoo, I think you changeable; in fact--in fact, I dread this deep\naffection which fills my whole being.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, you are mistaken,\" said La Valliere; \"if ever I love, it will\nbe for all my life.\"\n\n\"If you love, you say,\" exclaimed the king; \"you do _not_ love now,\nthen?\"\n\nShe hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You see,\" said the king, \"that I am right in accusing you; you must\nadmit you are changeable, capricious, a coquette, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! sire, be perfectly satisfied as to that. No, I say again; no,\nno!\"\n\n\"Promise me, then, that to me you will always be the same.\"\n\n\"Oh! always, sire.\"\n\n\"That you will never show any of that severity which would break my\nheart, none of that fickleness of manner which would be worse than death\nto me.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no.\"\n\n\"Very well, then! but listen. I like promises, I like to place under\nthe guarantee of an oath, under the protection of Heaven, in fact,\neverything which interests my heart and my affections. Promise me, or\nrather swear to me, that if in the life we are about to commence, a life\nwhich will be full of sacrifice, mystery, anxiety, disappointment, and\nmisunderstanding; swear to me that if we should in any way deceive, or\nmisunderstand each other, or should judge each other unjustly, for that\nindeed would be criminal in love such as ours; swear to me, Louise--\"\n\nShe trembled with agitation to the very depths of her heart; it was the\nfirst time she had heard her name pronounced in that manner by her\nroyal lover. As for the king, taking off his glove, and placing his\nhand within the carriage, he continued:--\"Swear, that never in all\nour quarrels will we allow one night even to pass by, if any\nmisunderstanding should arise between us, without a visit, or at least\na message, from either, in order to convey consolation and repose to the\nother.\"\n\nLa Valliere took her lover's burning hand between her own cool palms,\nand pressed it softly, until a movement of the horse, frightened by the\nproximity of the wheels, obliged her to abandon her happiness. She had\nvowed as he desired.\n\n\"Return, sire,\" she said, \"return to the queen. I foresee a storm\nyonder, which threatens my peace of mind and yours.\"\n\nLouis obeyed, saluted Mademoiselle de Montalais, and set off at a gallop\nto rejoin the queen. As he passed Monsieur's carriage, he observed that\nhe was fast asleep, although Madame, on her part, was wide awake. As\nthe king passed her she said, \"What a beautiful horse, sire! Is it not\nMonsieur's bay horse?\"\n\nThe young queen kindly asked, \"Are you better now, sire?\" [3]\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII. Triumfeminate.\n\nOn the king's arrival in Paris, he sat at the council which had been\nsummoned, and worked for a certain portion of the day. The queen\nremained with the queen-mother, and burst into tears as soon as she had\ntaken leave of the king. \"Ah, madame!\" she said, \"the king no longer\nloves me! What will become of me?\"\n\n\"A husband always loves his wife when she is like you,\" replied Anne of\nAustria.\n\n\"A time may come when he will love another woman instead of me.\"\n\n\"What do you call loving?\"\n\n\"Always thinking of a person--always seeking her society.\"\n\n\"Do you happen to have remarked,\" said Anne of Austria, \"that the king\nhas ever done anything of the sort?\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" said the young queen, hesitatingly.\n\n\"What is there to complain of, then, Marie?\"\n\n\"You will admit that the king leaves me?\"\n\n\"The king, my daughter, belongs to his people.\"\n\n\"And that is the very reason why he no longer belongs to me; and that is\nthe reason, too, why I shall find myself, as so many queens before me,\nforsaken and forgotten, whilst glory and honors will be reserved for\nothers. Oh, my mother! the king is so handsome! how often will others\ntell him that they love him, and how much, indeed, they must do so!\"\n\n\"It is very seldom, indeed, that women love the man in loving the king.\nBut if such a thing happened, which I doubt, you would do better to\nwish, Marie, that such women should really love your husband. In the\nfirst place, the devoted love of a mistress is a rapid element of the\ndissolution of a lover's affection; and then, by dint of loving, the\nmistress loses all influence over her lover, whose power of wealth she\ndoes not covet, caring only for his affection. Wish, therefore, that the\nking should love but lightly, and that his mistress should love with all\nher heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, my mother, what power may not a deep affection exercise over him!\"\n\n\"And yet you say you are resigned?\"\n\n\"Quite true, quite true; I speak absurdly. There is a feeling of\nanguish, however, which I can never control.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"The king may make a happy choice--may find a home, with all the tender\ninfluences of home, not far from that we can offer him,--a home with\nchildren round him, the children of another woman. Oh, madame! I should\ndie if I were but to see the king's children.\"\n\n\"Marie, Marie,\" replied the queen-mother with a smile, and she took the\nyoung queen's hand in her own, \"remember what I am going to say, and\nlet it always be a consolation to you: the king cannot have a Dauphin\nwithout _you_.\"\n\nWith this remark the queen-mother quitted her daughter-in-law, in\norder to meet Madame, whose arrival in the grand cabinet had just been\nannounced by one of the pages. Madame had scarcely taken time to change\nher dress. Her face revealed her agitation, which betrayed a plan, the\nexecution of which occupied, while the result disturbed, her mind.\n\n\"I came to ascertain,\" she said, \"if your majesties are suffering any\nfatigue from our journey.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" said the queen-mother.\n\n\"A little,\" replied Maria Theresa.\n\n\"I have suffered from annoyance more than anything else,\" said Madame.\n\n\"How was that?\" inquired Anne of Austria.\n\n\"The fatigue the king undergoes in riding about on horseback.\"\n\n\"That does the king good.\"\n\n\"And it was I who advised him,\" said Maria Theresa, turning pale.\n\nMadame said not a word in reply; but one of those smiles which were\npeculiarly her own flitted for a moment across her lips, without passing\nover the rest of her face; then, immediately changing the conversation,\nshe continued, \"We shall find Paris precisely the Paris we quitted; the\nsame intrigues, plots, and flirtations going on.\"\n\n\"Intrigues! What intrigues do you allude to?\" inquired the queen-mother.\n\n\"People are talking a good deal about M. Fouquet and Madame\nPlessis-Belliere.\"\n\n\"Who makes up the number to about ten thousand,\" replied the\nqueen-mother. \"But what are the plots you speak of?\"\n\n\"We have, it seems, certain misunderstandings with Holland to settle.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"Monsieur has been telling me the story of the medals.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the young queen, \"you mean those medals struck in\nHolland, on which a cloud is seen passing across the sun, which is the\nking's device. You are wrong in calling that a plot--it is an insult.\"\n\n\"But so contemptible that the king can well despise it,\" replied the\nqueen-mother. \"Well, what are the flirtations which are alluded to? Do\nyou mean that of Madame d'Olonne?\"\n\n\"No, no; nearer ourselves than that.\"\n\n\"_Casa de usted_,\" murmured the queen-mother, and without moving her\nlips, in her daughter-in-law's ear, without being overheard by Madame,\nwho thus continued:--\"You know the terrible news?\" [4]\n\n\"Oh, yes; M. de Guiche's wound.\"\n\n\"And you attribute it, I suppose, as every one else does, to an accident\nwhich happened to him while hunting?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said both the queens together, their interest\nawakened.\n\nMadame drew closer to them, as she said, in a low tone of voice, \"It was\na duel.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Anne of Austria, in a severe tone; for, in her ears, the word\n\"duel,\" which had been forbidden in France all the time she reigned over\nit, had a strange sound.\n\n\"A most deplorable duel, which has nearly cost Monsieur two of his best\nfriends, and the king two of his best servants.\"\n\n\"What was the cause of the duel?\" inquired the young queen, animated by\na secret instinct.\n\n\"Flirtation,\" repeated Madame, triumphantly. \"The gentlemen in question\nwere conversing about the virtue of a particular lady belonging to the\ncourt. One of them thought that Pallas was a very second-rate person\ncompared to her; the other pretended that the lady in question was an\nimitation of Venus alluring Mars; and thereupon the two gentlemen fought\nas fiercely as Hector and Achilles.\"\n\n\"Venus alluring Mars?\" said the young queen in a low tone of voice\nwithout venturing to examine into the allegory very deeply.\n\n\"Who is the lady?\" inquired Anne of Austria abruptly. \"You said, I\nbelieve, she was one of the ladies of honor?\"\n\n\"Did I say so?\" replied Madame.\n\n\"Yes; at least I thought I heard you mention it.\"\n\n\"Are you not aware that such a woman is of ill-omen to a royal house?\"\n\n\"Is it not Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\" said the queen-mother.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, that plain-looking creature.\"\n\n\"I thought she was affianced to a gentleman who certainly is not, at\nleast so I have heard, either M. de Guiche or M. de Wardes?\"\n\n\"Very possibly, madame.\"\n\nThe young queen took up a piece of tapestry, and began to broider with\nan affectation of tranquillity her trembling fingers contradicted.\n\n\"What were you saying about Venus and Mars?\" pursued the queen-mother.\n\"Is there a Mars also?\"\n\n\"She boasts of that being the case.\"\n\n\"Did you say she boasts of it?\"\n\n\"That was the cause of the duel.\"\n\n\"And M. de Guiche upheld the cause of Mars?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; like the devoted servant he is.\"\n\n\"The devoted servant of whom?\" exclaimed the young queen, forgetting her\nreserve in allowing her jealous feeling to escape.\n\n\"Mars, not to be defended except at the expense of Venus,\" replied\nMadame. \"M. de Guiche maintained the perfect innocence of Mars, and no\ndoubt affirmed that it was all a mere boast.\"\n\n\"And M. de Wardes,\" said Anne of Austria, quietly, \"spread the report\nthat Venus was within her rights, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, De Wardes,\" thought Madame, \"you shall pay dearly for the wound you\nhave given that noblest--best of men!\" And she began to attack De Wardes\nwith the greatest bitterness; thus discharging her own and De Guiche's\ndebt, with the assurance that she was working the future ruin of her\nenemy. She said so much, in fact, that had Manicamp been there, he would\nhave regretted he had shown such firm regard for his friend, inasmuch as\nit resulted in the ruin of his unfortunate foe.\n\n\"I see nothing in the whole affair but _one_ cause of mischief, and that\nis La Valliere herself,\" said the queen-mother.\n\nThe young queen resumed her work with perfect indifference of manner,\nwhile Madame listened eagerly.\n\n\"I do not yet quite understand what you said just now about the danger\nof coquetry,\" resumed Anne of Austria.\n\n\"It is quite true,\" Madame hastened to say, \"that if the girl had not\nbeen a coquette, Mars would not have thought at all about her.\"\n\nThe repetition of this word Mars brought a passing color to the queen's\nface; but she still continued her work.\n\n\"I will not permit that, in my court, gentlemen should be set against\neach other in this manner,\" said Anne of Austria, calmly. \"Such manners\nwere useful enough, perhaps, in days when the divided nobility had no\nother rallying-point than mere gallantry. At that time women, whose sway\nwas absolute and undivided, were privileged to encourage men's valor by\nfrequent trials of their courage. But now, thank Heaven, there is but\none master in France, and to him every instinct of the mind, every\npulse of the body are due. I will not allow my son to be deprived of\nany single one of his servants.\" And she turned towards the young queen,\nsaying, \"What is to be done with this La Valliere?\"\n\n\"La Valliere?\" said the queen, apparently surprised, \"I do not even know\nthe name;\" and she accompanied this remark by one of those cold, fixed\nsmiles only to be observed on royal lips.\n\nMadame was herself a princess great in every respect, great in\nintelligence, great by birth, by pride; the queen's reply, however,\ncompletely astonished her, and she was obliged to pause for a moment\nin order to recover herself. \"She is one of my maids of honor,\" she\nreplied, with a bow.\n\n\"In that case,\" retorted Maria Theresa, in the same tone, \"it is your\naffair, my sister, and not ours.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" resumed Anne of Austria, \"it is my affair. And\nI perfectly well understand,\" she pursued, addressing a look full of\nintelligence at Madame, \"Madame's motive for saying what she has just\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Everything which emanates from you, madame,\" said the English princess,\n\"proceeds from the lips of Wisdom.\"\n\n\"If we send this girl back to her own family,\" said Maria Theresa,\ngently, \"we must bestow a pension upon her.\"\n\n\"Which I will provide for out of my income,\" exclaimed Madame.\n\n\"No, no,\" interrupted Anne of Austria, \"no disturbance, I beg. The king\ndislikes that the slightest disrespectful remark should be made of\nany lady. Let everything be done quietly. Will you have the kindness,\nMadame, to send for this girl here; and you, my daughter, will have the\ngoodness to retire to your own room.\"\n\nThe dowager queen's entreaties were commands, and as Maria Theresa rose\nto return to her apartments, Madame rose in order to send a page to\nsummon La Valliere.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV. The First Quarrel.\n\nLa Valliere entered the queen-mother's apartments without in the least\nsuspecting that a serious plot was being concerted against her. She\nthought it was for something connected with her duties, and never had\nthe queen-mother been unkind to her when such was the case. Besides, not\nbeing immediately under the control or direction of Anne of Austria,\nshe could only have an official connection with her, to which her own\ngentleness of disposition, and the rank of the august princess, made\nher yield on every occasion with the best possible grace. She therefore\nadvanced towards the queen-mother with that soft and gentle smile\nwhich constituted her principal charm, and as she did not approach\nsufficiently close, Anne of Austria signed to her to come nearer. Madame\nthen entered the room, and with a perfectly calm air took her seat\nbeside her mother-in-law, and continued the work which Maria Theresa had\nbegun. When La Valliere, instead of the direction which she expected to\nreceive immediately on entering the room, perceived these preparations,\nshe looked with curiosity, if not with uneasiness, at the two\nprincesses. Anne seemed full of thought, while Madame maintained an\naffectation of indifference that would have alarmed a less timid person\neven than Louise.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the queen-mother suddenly, without attempting to\nmoderate or disguise her Spanish accent, which she never failed to do\nexcept when she was angry, \"come closer; we were talking of you, as\nevery one else seems to be doing.\"\n\n\"Of me!\" exclaimed La Valliere, turning pale.\n\n\"Do you pretend to be ignorant of it; are you not aware of the duel\nbetween M. de Guiche and M. de Wardes?\"\n\n\"Oh, madame! I heard of it yesterday,\" said La Valliere, clasping her\nhands together.\n\n\"And did you not foresee this quarrel?\"\n\n\"Why should I, madame?\"\n\n\"Because two men never fight without a motive, and because you must\nbe aware of the motive which awakened the animosity of the two in\nquestion.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly ignorant of it, madame.\"\n\n\"A persevering denial is a very commonplace mode of defense, and you,\nwho have great pretensions to be witty and clever, ought to avoid\ncommonplaces. What else have you to say?\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, your majesty terrifies me with your cold severity\nof manner; but I do not understand how I can have incurred your\ndispleasure, or in what respect people concern themselves about me.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you. M. de Guiche has been obliged to undertake your\ndefense.\"\n\n\"My defense?\"\n\n\"Yes. He is a gallant knight, and beautiful adventuresses like to see\nbrave knights couch lances in their honor. But, for my part, I hate\nfields of battle, and above all I hate adventures, and--take my remark\nas you please.\"\n\nLa Valliere sank at the queen's feet, who turned her back upon her.\nShe stretched out her hands towards Madame, who laughed in her face. A\nfeeling of pride made her rise to her feet.\n\n\"I have begged your majesty to tell me what is the crime I am accused\nof--I can claim this at your hands; and I see I am condemned before I am\neven permitted to justify myself.\"\n\n\"Eh! indeed,\" cried Anne of Austria, \"listen to her beautiful phrases,\nMadame, and to her fine sentiments; she is an inexhaustible well of\ntenderness and heroic expressions. One can easily see, young lady, that\nyou have cultivated your mind in the society of crowned heads.\"\n\nLa Valliere felt struck to the heart; she became, not whiter, but as\nwhite as a lily, and all her strength forsook her.\n\n\"I wished to inform you,\" interrupted the queen, disdainfully, \"that if\nyou continue to nourish such feelings, you will humiliate us to such a\ndegree that we shall be ashamed of appearing before you. Be simple in\nyour manners. By the by, I am informed that you are affianced; is it the\ncase?\"\n\nLa Valliere pressed her hand over her heart, which was wrung with a\nfresh pang.\n\n\"Answer when you are spoken to!\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"To a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"His name?\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Are you aware that it is an exceedingly fortunate circumstance for you,\nmademoiselle, that such is the case, and without fortune or position,\nas you are, or without any very great personal advantages, you ought\nto bless Heaven for having procured you such a future as seems to be in\nstore for you?\"\n\nLa Valliere did not reply. \"Where is the Vicomte de Bragelonne?\" pursued\nthe queen.\n\n\"In England,\" said Madame, \"where the report of this young lady's\nsuccess will not fail to reach him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Heaven!\" murmured La Valliere in despair.\n\n\"Very well, mademoiselle!\" said Anne of Austria, \"we will get this young\ngentleman to return, and send you away somewhere with him. If you are\nof a different opinion--for girls have strange views and fancies at\ntimes--trust to me, I will put you in a proper path again. I have done\nas much for girls who are not as good as you are, probably.\"\n\nLa Valliere ceased to hear the queen, who pitilessly added: \"I will\nsend you somewhere, by yourself, where you will be able to indulge in a\nlittle serious reflection. Reflection calms the ardor of the blood, and\nswallows up the illusions of youth. I suppose you understand what I have\nbeen saying?\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Not a word?\"\n\n\"I am innocent of everything your majesty supposes. Oh, madame! you are\na witness of my despair. I love, I respect your majesty so much.\"\n\n\"It would be far better not to respect me at all,\" said the queen, with\na chilling irony of manner. \"It would be far better if you were not\ninnocent. Do you presume to suppose that I should be satisfied simply to\nleave you unpunished if you had committed the fault?\"\n\n\"Oh, madame! you are killing me.\"\n\n\"No acting, if you please, or I will precipitate the _denouement_ of\nthis _play_; leave the room; return to your own apartment, and I trust\nmy lesson may be of service to you.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" said La Valliere to the Duchess d'Orleans, whose hands she\nseized in her own, \"do you, who are so good, intercede for me?\"\n\n\"I!\" replied the latter, with an insulting joy, \"I--good!--Ah,\nmademoiselle, you think nothing of the kind;\" and with a rude, hasty\ngesture she repulsed the young girl's grasp.\n\nLa Valliere, instead of giving way, as from her extreme pallor and her\ntears the two princesses possibly expected, suddenly resumed her calm\nand dignified air; she bowed profoundly, and left the room.\n\n\"Well!\" said Anne of Austria to Madame, \"do you think she will begin\nagain?\"\n\n\"I always suspect those gentle, patient characters,\" replied Madame.\n\"Nothing is more full of courage than a patient heart, nothing more\nself-reliant than a gentle spirit.\"\n\n\"I feel I may almost venture to assure you she will think twice before\nshe looks at the god Mars again.\"\n\n\"So long as she does not obtain the protection of his buckler I do not\ncare,\" retorted Madame.\n\nA proud, defiant look of the queen-mother was the reply to this\nobjection, which was by no means deficient in finesse; and both of them,\nalmost sure of their victory, went to look for Maria Theresa, who had\nbeen waiting for them with impatience.\n\nIt was about half-past six in the evening, and the king had just\npartaken of refreshment. He lost no time; but the repast finished, and\nbusiness matters settled, he took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and desired\nhim to lead the way to La Valliere's apartments. The courtier uttered an\nexclamation.\n\n\"Well, what is that for? It is a habit you will have to adopt, and in\norder to adopt a habit, one must make a beginning.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" said Saint-Aignan, \"it is hardly possible: for every one can\nbe seen entering or leaving those apartments. If, however, some pretext\nor other were made use of--if your majesty, for instance, would wait\nuntil Madame were in her own apartments--\"\n\n\"No pretext; no delays. I have had enough of these impediments and\nmysteries; I cannot perceive in what respect the king of France\ndishonors himself by conversing with an amiable and clever girl. Evil be\nto him who evil thinks.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty forgive an excess of zeal on my part?\"\n\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\n\"How about the queen?\"\n\n\"True, true; I always wish the most entire respect to be shown to her\nmajesty. Well, then, this evening only will I pay Mademoiselle de la\nValliere a visit, and after to-day I will make use of any pretext you\nlike. To-morrow we will devise all sorts of means; to-night I have no\ntime.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan made no reply; he descended the steps, preceding the king,\nand crossed the different courtyards with a feeling of shame, which the\ndistinguished honor of accompanying the king did not remove. The reason\nwas that Saint-Aignan wished to stand well with Madame, as well as\nwith the queens, and also, that he did not, on the other hand, want to\ndisplease Mademoiselle de la Valliere: and in order to carry out so\nmany promising affairs, it was difficult to avoid jostling against some\nobstacle or other. Besides, the windows of the young queen's rooms,\nthose of the queen-mother's, and of Madame herself, looked out upon the\ncourtyard of the maids of honor. To be seen, therefore, accompanying the\nking, would be effectually to quarrel with three great and influential\nprincesses--whose authority was unbounded--for the purpose of supporting\nthe ephemeral credit of a mistress. The unhappy Saint-Aignan, who had\nnot displayed a very great amount of courage in taking La Valliere's\npart in the park of Fontainebleau, did not feel any braver in the broad\nday-light, and found a thousand defects in the poor girl which he was\nmost eager to communicate to the king. But his trial soon finished,--the\ncourtyards were crossed; not a curtain was drawn aside, nor a window\nopened. The king walked hastily, because of his impatience, and the\nlong legs of Saint-Aignan, who preceded him. At the door, however,\nSaint-Aignan wished to retire, but the king desired him to remain; a\ndelicate consideration, on the king's part, which the courtier could\nvery well have dispensed with. He had to follow Louis into La Valliere's\napartment. As soon as the king arrived the young girl dried her tears,\nbut so precipitately that the king perceived it. He questioned her most\nanxiously and tenderly, and pressed her to tell him the cause of her\nemotion.\n\n\"Nothing is the matter, sire,\" she said.\n\n\"And yet you were weeping?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, indeed, sire.\"\n\n\"Look, Saint-Aignan, and tell me if I am mistaken.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan ought to have answered, but he was too much embarrassed.\n\n\"At all events your eyes are red, mademoiselle,\" said the king.\n\n\"The dust of the road merely, sire.\"\n\n\"No, no; you no longer possess the air of supreme contentment which\nrenders you so beautiful and so attractive. You do not look at me. Why\navoid my gaze?\" he said, as she turned aside her head. \"In Heaven's\nname, what is the matter?\" he inquired, beginning to lose command over\nhimself.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sire; and I am perfectly ready to assure your majesty\nthat my mind is as free from anxiety as you could possibly wish.\"\n\n\"Your mind at ease, when I see you are embarrassed at the slightest\nthing. Has any one annoyed you?\"\n\n\"No, no, sire.\"\n\n\"I insist upon knowing if such really be the case,\" said the prince, his\neyes sparkling.\n\n\"No one, sire, no one has in any way offended me.\"\n\n\"In that case, pray resume your gentle air of gayety, or that sweet\nmelancholy look which I so loved in you this morning; for pity's sake,\ndo so.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, yes.\"\n\nThe king tapped the floor impatiently with his foot, saying, \"Such a\nchange is positively inexplicable.\" And he looked at Saint-Aignan, who\nhad also remarked La Valliere's peculiar lethargy, as well as the king's\nimpatience.\n\nIt was futile for the king to entreat, and as useless for him to try to\novercome her depression: the poor girl was completely overwhelmed,--the\nappearance of an angel would hardly have awakened her from her torpor.\n\nThe king saw in her repeated negative replies a mystery full of\nunkindness; he began to look round the apartment with a suspicious air.\nThere happened to be in La Valliere's room a miniature of Athos.\nThe king remarked that this portrait bore a strong resemblance to\nBragelonne, for it had been taken when the count was quite a young man.\nHe looked at it with a threatening air. La Valliere, in her misery far\nindeed from thinking of this portrait, could not conjecture the cause\nof the king's preoccupation. And yet the king's mind was occupied with\na terrible remembrance, which had more than once taken possession of\nhis mind, but which he had always driven away. He recalled the\nintimacy existing between the two young people from their birth, their\nengagement, and that Athos himself had come to solicit La Valliere's\nhand for Raoul. He therefore could not but suppose that on her return\nto Paris, La Valliere had found news from London awaiting her, and that\nthis news had counterbalanced the influence he had been enabled to exert\nover her. He immediately felt himself stung, as it were, by feelings\nof the wildest jealousy; and again questioned her, with increased\nbitterness. La Valliere could not reply, unless she were to acknowledge\neverything, which would be to accuse the queen, and Madame also; and the\nconsequence would be, that she would have to enter into an open warfare\nwith these two great and powerful princesses. She thought within herself\nthat as she made no attempt to conceal from the king what was passing in\nher own mind, the king ought to be able to read in her heart, in\nspite of her silence; and that, had he really loved her, he would have\nunderstood and guessed everything. What was sympathy, then, if not that\ndivine flame which possesses the property of enlightening the heart, and\nof saving lovers the necessity of an expression of their thoughts and\nfeelings? She maintained her silence, therefore, sighing, and concealing\nher face in her hands. These sighs and tears, which had at first\ndistressed, then terrified Louis XIV., now irritated him. He could not\nbear opposition,--the opposition which tears and sighs exhibited, any\nmore than opposition of any other kind. His remarks, therefore, became\nbitter, urgent, and openly aggressive in their nature. This was a\nfresh cause of distress for the poor girl. From that very circumstance,\ntherefore, which she regarded as an injustice on her lover's part, she\ndrew sufficient courage to bear, not only her other troubles, but this\none also.\n\nThe king next began to accuse her in direct terms. La Valliere did not\neven attempt to defend herself; she endured all his accusations without\naccording any other reply than that of shaking her head; without any\nother remark than that which escapes the heart in deep distress--a\nprayerful appeal to Heaven for help. But this ejaculation, instead of\ncalming the king's displeasure, rather increased it. He, moreover, saw\nhimself seconded by Saint-Aignan, for Saint-Aignan, as we have observed,\nhaving seen the storm increasing, and not knowing the extent of the\nregard of which Louis XIV. was capable, felt, by anticipation, all the\ncollected wrath of the three princesses, and the near approach of poor\nLa Valliere's downfall, and he was not true knight enough to resist\nthe fear that he himself might be dragged down in the impending ruin.\nSaint-Aignan did not reply to the king's questions except by short, dry\nremarks, pronounced half-aloud; and by abrupt gestures, whose object was\nto make things worse, and bring about a misunderstanding, the result\nof which would be to free him from the annoyance of having to cross the\ncourtyards in open day, in order to follow his illustrious companion to\nLa Valliere's apartments. In the meantime the king's anger momentarily\nincreased; he made two or three steps towards the door as if to leave\nthe room, but returned. The young girl did not, however, raise her head,\nalthough the sound of his footsteps might have warned her that her lover\nwas leaving her. He drew himself up, for a moment, before her, with his\narms crossed.\n\n\"For the last time, mademoiselle,\" he said, \"will you speak? Will you\nassign a reason for this change, this fickleness, for this caprice?\"\n\n\"What can I say?\" murmured La Valliere. \"Do you not see, sire, that I am\ncompletely overwhelmed at this moment; that I have no power of will, or\nthought, or speech?\"\n\n\"Is it so difficult, then, to speak the truth? You could have told me\nthe whole truth in fewer words than those in which you have expressed\nyourself.\"\n\n\"But the truth about what, sire?\"\n\n\"About everything.\"\n\nLa Valliere was just on the point of revealing the truth to the king,\nher arms made a sudden movement as if they were about to open, but her\nlips remained silent, and her hands again fell listlessly by her side.\nThe poor girl had not yet endured sufficient unhappiness to risk the\nnecessary revelation. \"I know nothing,\" she stammered out.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the king, \"this is no longer mere coquetry, or caprice,\nit is treason.\"\n\nAnd this time nothing could restrain him. The impulse of his heart was\nnot sufficient to induce him to turn back, and he darted out of the room\nwith a gesture full of despair. Saint-Aignan followed him, wishing for\nnothing better than to quit the place.\n\nLouis XIV. did not pause until he reached the staircase, and grasping\nthe balustrade, said: \"You see how shamefully I have been duped.\"\n\n\"How, sire?\" inquired the favorite.\n\n\"De Guiche fought on the Vicomte de Bragelonne's account, and this\nBragelonne... oh! Saint-Aignan, she still loves him. I vow to you,\nSaint-Aignan, that if, in three days from now, there were to remain but\nan atom of affection for her in my heart, I should die from very shame.\"\nAnd the king resumed his way to his own apartments.\n\n\"I told your majesty how it would be,\" murmured Saint-Aignan, continuing\nto follow the king, and timidly glancing up at the different windows.\n\nUnfortunately their return was not, like their arrival, unobserved. A\ncurtain was suddenly drawn aside; Madame was behind it. She had seen\nthe king leave the apartments of the maids of honor, and as soon as she\nobserved that his majesty had passed, she left her own apartments with\nhurried steps, and ran up the staircase that led to the room the king\nhad just left.\n\n\n\nChapter XXV. Despair.\n\nAs soon as the king was gone La Valliere raised herself from the ground,\nand stretched out her arms, as if to follow and detain him, but when,\nhaving violently closed the door, the sound of his retreating footsteps\ncould be heard in the distance, she had hardly sufficient strength\nleft to totter towards and fall at the foot of her crucifix. There\nshe remained, broken-hearted, absorbed, and overwhelmed by her grief,\nforgetful and indifferent to everything but her profound sorrow;--a\ngrief she only vaguely realized--as though by instinct. In the midst of\nthis wild tumult of thoughts, La Valliere heard her door open again; she\nstarted, and turned round, thinking it was the king who had returned.\nShe was deceived, however, for it was Madame who appeared at the\ndoor. What did she now care for Madame! Again she sank down, her head\nsupported by her _prie-Dieu_ chair. It was Madame, agitated, angry,\nand threatening. But what was that to her? \"Mademoiselle,\" said the\nprincess, standing before La Valliere, \"this is very fine, I admit,\nto kneel and pray, and make a pretense of being religious; but however\nsubmissive you may be in your address to Heaven, it is desirable that\nyou should pay some little attention to the wishes of those who reign\nand rule here below.\"\n\nLa Valliere raised her head painfully in token of respect.\n\n\"Not long since,\" continued Madame, \"a certain recommendation was\naddressed to you, I believe.\"\n\nLa Valliere's fixed and wild gaze showed how complete her forgetfulness\nor ignorance was.\n\n\"The queen recommended you,\" continued Madame, \"to conduct yourself in\nsuch a manner that no one could be justified in spreading any reports\nabout you.\"\n\nLa Valliere darted an inquiring look towards her.\n\n\"I will not,\" continued Madame, \"allow my household, which is that of\nthe first princess of the blood, to set an evil example to the court;\nyou would be the cause of such an example. I beg you to understand,\ntherefore, in the absence of any witness of your shame--for I do not\nwish to humiliate you--that you are from this moment at perfect liberty\nto leave, and that you can return to your mother at Blois.\"\n\nLa Valliere could not sink lower, nor could she suffer more than she had\nalready suffered. Her countenance did not even change, but she remained\nkneeling with her hands clasped, like the figure of the Magdalen.\n\n\"Did you hear me?\" said Madame.\n\nA shiver, which passed through her whole frame, was La Valliere's only\nreply. And as the victim gave no other signs of life, Madame left the\nroom. And then, her very respiration suspended, and her blood almost\ncongealed, as it were, in her veins, La Valliere by degrees felt that\nthe pulsation of her wrists, her neck, and temples, began to throb more\nand more painfully. These pulsations, as they gradually increased, soon\nchanged into a species of brain fever, and in her temporary delirium\nshe saw the figures of her friends contending with her enemies, floating\nbefore her vision. She heard, too, mingled together in her deafened\nears, words of menace and words of fond affection; she seemed raised out\nof her existence as though it were upon the wings of a mighty tempest,\nand in the dim horizon of the path along which her delirium hurried\nher, she saw the stone which covered her tomb upraised, and the grim,\nappalling texture of eternal night revealed to her distracted gaze. But\nthe horror of the dream which possessed her senses faded away, and she\nwas again restored to the habitual resignation of her character. A ray\nof hope penetrated her heart, as a ray of sunlight streams into the\ndungeon of some unhappy captive. Her mind reverted to the journey from\nFontainebleau, she saw the king riding beside her carriage, telling\nher that he loved her, asking for her love in return, requiring her to\nswear, and himself to swear too, that never should an evening pass by,\nif ever a misunderstanding were to arise between them, without a visit,\na letter, a sign of some kind, being sent, to replace the troubled\nanxiety of the evening with the calm repose of the night. It was the\nking who had suggested that, who had imposed a promise on her, and who\nhad sworn to it himself. It was impossible, therefore, she reasoned,\nthat the king should fail in keeping the promise which he had himself\nexacted from her, unless, indeed, Louis was a despot who enforced love\nas he enforced obedience; unless, too, the king were so indifferent\nthat the first obstacle in his way was sufficient to arrest his further\nprogress. The king, that kind protector, who by a word, a single\nword, could relieve her distress of mind, the king even joined her\npersecutors. Oh! his anger could not possibly last. Now that he was\nalone, he would be suffering all that she herself was a prey to. But he\nwas not tied hand and foot as she was; he could act, could move about,\ncould come to her, while she could do nothing but wait. And the poor\ngirl waited and waited, with breathless anxiety--for she could not\nbelieve it possible that the king would not come.\n\nIt was now about half-past ten. He would either come to her, or write to\nher, or send some kind word by M. de Saint-Aignan. If he were to come,\noh! how she would fly to meet him; how she would thrust aside that\nexcess of delicacy which she now discovered was misunderstood; how\neagerly she would explain: \"It is not I who do not love you--it is the\nfault of others who will not allow me to love you.\" And then it must be\nconfessed that she reflected upon it, and also the more she reflected,\nLouis appeared to her to be less guilty. In fact, he was ignorant of\neverything. What must he have thought of the obstinacy with which she\nremained silent? Impatient and irritable as the king was known to be, it\nwas extraordinary that he had been able to preserve his temper so long.\nAnd yet, had it been her own case, she undoubtedly would not have acted\nin such a manner; she would have understood--have guessed everything.\nYes, but she was nothing but a poor simple-minded girl, and not a\ngreat and powerful monarch. Oh! if he would but come, if he would but\ncome!--how eagerly she would forgive him for all he had just made her\nsuffer! how much more tenderly she would love him because she had so\ncruelly suffered! And so she sat, with her head bent forward in eager\nexpectation towards the door, her lips slightly parted, as if--and\nHeaven forgive her for the mental exclamation!--they were awaiting the\nkiss which the king's lips had in the morning so sweetly indicated, when\nhe pronounced the word _love!_ If the king did not come, at least he\nwould write; it was a second chance; a chance less delightful certainly\nthan the other, but which would show an affection just as strong, only\nmore timid in its nature. Oh! how she would devour his letter, how eager\nshe would be to answer it! and when the messenger who had brought it had\nleft her, how she would kiss it, read it over and over again, press to\nher heart the lucky paper which would have brought her ease of mind,\ntranquillity, and perfect happiness. At all events, if the king did not\ncome, if the king did not write, he could not do otherwise than send\nSaint-Aignan, or Saint-Aignan could not do otherwise than come of his\nown accord. Even if it were a third person, how openly she would speak\nto him; the royal presence would not be there to freeze her words upon\nher tongue, and then no suspicious feeling would remain a moment longer\nin the king's heart.\n\nEverything with La Valliere, heart and look, body and mind, was\nconcentrated in eager expectation. She said to herself that there was an\nhour left in which to indulge hope; that until midnight struck, the\nking might come, or write or send; that at midnight only would every\nexpectation vanish, every hope be lost. Whenever she heard any stir in\nthe palace, the poor girl fancied she was the cause of it; whenever\nshe heard any one pass in the courtyard below she imagined they were\nmessengers of the king coming to her. Eleven o'clock struck, then a\nquarter-past eleven; then half-past. The minutes dragged slowly on\nin this anxiety, and yet they seemed to pass too quickly. And now, it\nstruck a quarter to twelve. Midnight--midnight was near, the last, the\nfinal hope that remained. With the last stroke of the clock, the last\nray of light seemed to fade away; and with the last ray faded her final\nhope. And so, the king himself had deceived her; it was he who had been\nthe first to fail in keeping the oath which he had sworn that very day;\ntwelve hours only between his oath and his perjured vow; it was not long,\nalas! to have preserved the illusion. And so, not only did the king not\nlove her, but he despised her whom every one ill-treated, he despised\nher to the extent even of abandoning her to the shame of an expulsion\nwhich was equivalent to having an ignominious sentence passed on her;\nand yet, it was he, the king himself, who was the first cause of this\nignominy. A bitter smile, the only symptom of anger which during this\nlong conflict had passed across the angelic face, appeared upon her\nlips. What, in fact, now remained on earth for her, after the king was\nlost to her? Nothing. But Heaven still remained, and her thoughts flew\nthither. She prayed that the proper course for her to follow might be\nsuggested. \"It is from Heaven,\" she thought, \"that I expect everything;\nit is from Heaven I ought to expect everything.\" And she looked at her\ncrucifix with a devotion full of tender love. \"There,\" she said, \"hangs\nbefore me a Master who never forgets and never abandons those who\nneither forget nor abandon Him; it is to Him alone that we must\nsacrifice ourselves.\" And, thereupon, could any one have gazed into the\nrecesses of that chamber, they would have seen the poor despairing girl\nadopt a final resolution, and determine upon one last plan in her mind.\nThen, as her knees were no longer able to support her, she gradually\nsank down upon the _prie-Dieu_, and with her head pressed against the\nwooden cross, her eyes fixed, and her respiration short and quick, she\nwatched for the earliest rays of approaching daylight. At two o'clock\nin the morning she was still in the same bewilderment of mind, or rather\nthe same ecstasy of feeling. Her thoughts had almost ceased to hold\ncommunion with things of the world. And when she saw the pale violet\ntints of early dawn visible over the roofs of the palace, and vaguely\nrevealing the outlines of the ivory crucifix which she held embraced,\nshe rose from the ground with a new-born strength, kissed the feet of\nthe divine martyr, descended the staircase leading from the room, and\nwrapped herself from head to foot in a mantle as she went along. She\nreached the wicket at the very moment the guard of the musketeers opened\nthe gate to admit the first relief-guard belonging to one of the Swiss\nregiments. And then, gliding behind the soldiers, she reached the street\nbefore the officer in command of the patrol had even thought of asking\nwho the young girl was who was making her escape from the palace at so\nearly an hour.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI. The Flight.\n\nLa Valliere followed the patrol as it left the courtyard. The\npatrol bent its steps towards the right, by the Rue St. Honore,\nand mechanically La Valliere turned to the left. Her resolution was\ntaken--her determination fixed; she wished to betake herself to the\nconvent of the Carmelites at Chaillot, the superior of which enjoyed\na reputation for severity which made the worldly-minded people of the\ncourt tremble. La Valliere had never seen Paris, she had never gone out\non foot, and so would have been unable to find her way even had she been\nin a calmer frame of mind than was then the case; and this may explain\nwhy she ascended, instead of descending, the Rue St. Honore. Her only\nthought was to get away from the Palais Royal, and this she was doing;\nshe had heard it said that Chaillot looked out upon the Seine, and she\naccordingly directed her steps towards the Seine. She took the Rue de\nCoq, and not being able to cross the Louvre, bore towards the church of\nSaint Germain l'Auxerrois, proceeding along the site of the colonnade\nwhich was subsequently built there by Perrault. In a very short time she\nreached the quays. Her steps were rapid and agitated; she scarcely felt\nthe weakness which reminded her of having sprained her foot when very\nyoung, and which obliged her to limp slightly. At any other hour in\nthe day her countenance would have awakened the suspicions of the least\nclear-sighted, attracted the attention of the most indifferent. But at\nhalf-past two in the morning, the streets of Paris are almost, if not\nquite, deserted, and scarcely is any one to be seen but the hard-working\nartisan on his way to earn his daily bread or the roistering idlers of\nthe streets, who are returning to their homes after a night of riot and\ndebauchery; for the former the day was beginning, and for the latter\nit was just closing. La Valliere was afraid of both faces, in which her\nignorance of Parisian types did not permit her to distinguish the type\nof probity from that of dishonesty. The appearance of misery alarmed\nher, and all she met seemed either vile or miserable. Her dress, which\nwas the same she had worn during the previous evening, was elegant even\nin its careless disorder; for it was the one in which she had presented\nherself to the queen-mother; and, moreover, when she drew aside the\nmantle which covered her face, in order to enable her to see the way she\nwas going, her pallor and her beautiful eyes spoke an unknown language\nto the men she met, and, unconsciously, the poor fugitive seemed\nto invite the brutal remarks of the one class, or to appeal to the\ncompassion of the other. La Valliere still walked on in the same way,\nbreathless and hurried, until she reached the top of the Place de Greve.\nShe stopped from time to time, placed her hand upon her heart, leaned\nagainst a wall until she could breathe freely again, and then continued\non her course more rapidly than before. On reaching the Place de Greve\nLa Valliere suddenly came upon a group of three drunken men, reeling and\nstaggering along, who were just leaving a boat which they had made fast\nto the quay; the boat was freighted with wines, and it was apparent that\nthey had done ample justice to the merchandise. They were celebrating\ntheir convivial exploits in three different keys, when suddenly, as they\nreached the end of the railing leading down to the quay, they found an\nobstacle in their path, in the shape of this young girl. La Valliere\nstopped; while they, on their part, at the appearance of the young girl\ndressed in court costume, also halted, and seizing each other by the\nhand, they surrounded La Valliere, singing,--\n\n\"Oh! all ye weary wights, who mope alone, Come drink, and sing and\nlaugh, round Venus' throne.\"\n\nLa Valliere at once understood that the men were insulting her, and\nwished to prevent her passing; she tried to do so several times, but\nher efforts were useless. Her limbs failed her; she felt she was on the\npoint of falling, and uttered a cry of terror. At the same moment\nthe circle which surrounded her was suddenly broken through in a most\nviolent manner. One of her insulters was knocked to the left, another\nfell rolling over and over to the right, close to the water's edge,\nwhile the third could hardly keep his feet. An officer of the musketeers\nstood face to face with the young girl, with threatening brow and hand\nraised to carry out his threat. The drunken fellows, at sight of the\nuniform, made their escape with what speed their staggering limbs could\nlend them, all the more eagerly for the proof of strength which the\nwearer of the uniform had just afforded them.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" exclaimed the musketeer, \"that it can be Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere?\"\n\nLa Valliere, bewildered by what had just happened, and confounded by\nhearing her name pronounced, looked up and recognized D'Artagnan. \"Oh,\nM. d'Artagnan! it is indeed I;\" and at the same moment she seized\nhis arm. \"You will protect me, will you not?\" she added, in a tone of\nentreaty.\n\n\"Most certainly I will protect you; but, in Heaven's name, where are you\ngoing at this hour?\"\n\n\"I am going to Chaillot.\"\n\n\"You are going to Chaillot by way of La Rapee! why, mademoiselle, you\nare turning your back upon it.\"\n\n\"In that case, monsieur, be kind enough to put me in the right way, and\nto go with me a short distance.\"\n\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\n\"But how does it happen that I have found you here? By what merciful\nintervention were you sent to my assistance? I almost seem to be\ndreaming, or to be losing my senses.\"\n\n\"I happened to be here, mademoiselle, because I have a house in the\nPlace de Greve, at the sign of the Notre-Dame, the rent of which I went\nto receive yesterday, and where I, in fact, passed the night. And I\nalso wished to be at the palace early, for the purposes of inspecting my\nposts.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said La Valliere.\n\n\"That is what _I_ was doing,\" said D'Artagnan to himself; \"but what is\n_she_ doing, and why is she going to Chaillot at such an hour?\" And he\noffered her his arm, which she took, and began to walk with increased\nprecipitation, which ill-concealed, however, her weakness. D'Artagnan\nperceived it, and proposed to La Valliere that she should take a little\nrest, which she refused.\n\n\"You are ignorant, perhaps, where Chaillot is?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"It is a great distance.\"\n\n\"That matters very little.\"\n\n\"It is at least a league.\"\n\n\"I can walk it.\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not reply; he could tell, merely by the tone of a voice,\nwhen a resolution was real or not. He rather bore along rather than\naccompanied La Valliere, until they perceived the elevated ground of\nChaillot.\n\n\"What house are you going to, mademoiselle?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"To the Carmelites, monsieur.\"\n\n\"To the Carmelites?\" repeated D'Artagnan, in amazement.\n\n\"Yes; and since Heaven has directed you towards me to give me your\nsupport on my road, accept both my thanks and my adieux.\"\n\n\"To the Carmelites! Your adieux! Are you going to become a nun?\"\nexclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What, you!!!\" There was in this \"you,\" which we have marked by\nthree notes of exclamation in order to render it as expressive as\npossible,--there was, we repeat, in this \"you\" a complete poem; it\nrecalled to La Valliere her old recollections of Blois, and her new\nrecollections of Fontainebleau; it said to her, \"_You_, who might be\nhappy with Raoul; _you_, who might be powerful with Louis; _you_ about\nto become a nun!\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" she said, \"I am going to devote myself to the service\nof Heaven; and to renounce the world entirely.\"\n\n\"But are you not mistaken with regard to your vocation,--are you not\nmistaken in supposing it to be the will of Heaven?\"\n\n\"No, since Heaven has been pleased to throw you in my way. Had it not\nbeen for you, I should certainly have sunk from fatigue on the road, and\nsince Heaven, I repeat, has thrown you in my way, it is because it has\nwilled that I should carry out my intention.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, doubtingly, \"that is a rather subtle distinction,\nI think.\"\n\n\"Whatever it may be,\" returned the young girl, \"I have acquainted you\nwith the steps I have taken, and with my fixed resolution. And, now, I\nhave one last favor to ask of you, even while I return you my thanks.\nThe king is entirely ignorant of my flight from the Palais Royal, and is\nignorant also of what I am about to do.\"\n\n\"The king ignorant, you say!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan. \"Take care,\nmademoiselle; you are not aware of what you are doing. No one ought to\ndo anything with which the king is unacquainted, especially those who\nbelong to the court.\"\n\n\"I no longer belong to the court, monsieur.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at the young girl with increasing astonishment.\n\n\"Do not be uneasy, monsieur,\" she continued: \"I have well calculated\neverything; and were it not so, it would now be too late to reconsider\nmy resolution,--all is decided.\"\n\n\"Well, mademoiselle, what do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"In the name of that sympathy which misfortune inspires, by your\ngenerous feeling, and by your honor as a gentleman, I entreat you to\npromise me one thing.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"Swear to me, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that you will not tell the king that\nyou have seen me, and that I am at the Carmelites.\"\n\n\"I will not swear that,\" said D'Artagnan, shaking his head.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I know the king, I know you, I know myself even, nay, the whole\nhuman race, too well; no, no, I will not swear that!\"\n\n\"In that case,\" cried La Valliere, with an energy of which one would\nhardly have thought her capable, \"instead of the blessing which I should\nhave implored for you until my dying day, I will invoke a curse, for you\nare rendering me the most miserable creature that ever lived.\"\n\nWe have already observed that D'Artagnan could easily recognize the\naccents of truth and sincerity, and he could not resist this last\nappeal. He saw by her face how bitterly she suffered from a feeling of\ndegradation, he remarked her trembling limbs, how her whole slight and\ndelicate frame was violently agitated by some internal struggle, and\nclearly perceived that resistance might be fatal. \"I will do as you\nwish, then,\" he said. \"Be satisfied, mademoiselle, I will say nothing to\nthe king.\"\n\n\"Oh! thanks, thanks,\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"you are the most generous\nman breathing.\"\n\nAnd in her extreme delight she seized hold of D'Artagnan's hands\nand pressed them between her own. D'Artagnan, who felt himself quite\novercome, said: \"This is touching, upon my word; she begins where others\nleave off.\"\n\nAnd La Valliere, who, in the bitterness of her distress, had sunk upon\nthe ground, rose and walked towards the convent of the Carmelites,\nwhich could now, in the dawning light, be perceived just before them.\nD'Artagnan followed her at a distance. The entrance-door was half-open;\nshe glided in like a shadow, and thanking D'Artagnan by a parting\ngesture, disappeared from his sight. When D'Artagnan found himself quite\nalone, he reflected very profoundly upon what had just taken place.\n\"Upon my word,\" he said, \"this looks very much like what is called a\nfalse position. To keep such a secret as that, is to keep a burning coal\nin one's breeches-pocket, and trust that it may not burn the stuff.\nAnd yet, not to keep it when I have sworn to do so is dishonorable. It\ngenerally happens that some bright idea or other occurs to me as I am\ngoing along; but I am very much mistaken if I shall not, now, have to go\na long way in order to find the solution of this affair. Yes, but which\nway to go? Oh! towards Paris, of course; that is the best way, after\nall. Only one must make haste, and in order to make haste four legs are\nbetter than two, and I, unhappily, only have two. 'A horse, a horse,' as\nI heard them say at the theatre in London, 'my kingdom for a horse!'\nAnd now I think of it, it need not cost me so much as that, for at the\nBarriere de la Conference there is a guard of musketeers, and instead of\nthe one horse I need, I shall find ten there.\"\n\nSo, in pursuance of this resolution, which he adopted with his usual\nrapidity, D'Artagnan immediately turned his back upon the heights of\nChaillot, reached the guard-house, took the fastest horse he could find\nthere, and was at the palace in less than ten minutes. It was striking\nfive as he reached the Palais Royal. The king, he was told, had gone to\nbed at his usual hour, having been long engaged with M. Colbert, and, in\nall probability, was still sound asleep. \"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"she\nspoke the truth; the king is ignorant of everything; if he only knew\none-half of what has happened, the Palais Royal by this time would be\nturned upside down.\" [5]\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII. Showing How Louis, on His Part, Had Passed the Time from\nTen to Half-Past Twelve at Night.\n\nWhen the king left the apartments of the maids of honor, he found\nColbert awaiting him to take directions for the next day's ceremony, as\nthe king was then to receive the Dutch and Spanish ambassadors. Louis\nXIV. had serious causes of dissatisfaction with the Dutch; the States\nhad already been guilty of many mean shifts and evasions with France,\nand without perceiving or without caring about the chances of a rupture,\nthey again abandoned the alliance with his Most Christian Majesty, for\nthe purpose of entering into all kinds of plots with Spain. Louis XIV.\nat his accession, that is to say, at the death of Cardinal Mazarin, had\nfound this political question roughly sketched out; the solution was\ndifficult for a young man, but as, at that time, the king represented\nthe whole nation, anything that the head resolved upon, the body would\nbe found ready to carry out. Any sudden impulse of anger, the reaction\nof young hot blood upon the brain, would be quite sufficient to change\nan old form of policy and create another system altogether. The part\nthat diplomatists had to play in those days was that of arranging among\nthemselves the different _coups-d'etat_ which their sovereign masters\nmight wish to effect. Louis was not in that calm frame of mind which was\nnecessary to enable him to determine on a wise course of policy. Still\nmuch agitated from the quarrel he had just had with La Valliere,\nhe walked hastily into his cabinet, dimly desirous of finding an\nopportunity of producing an explosion after he had controlled himself\nfor so long a time. Colbert, as he saw the king enter, knew the position\nof affairs at a glance, understood the king's intentions, and resolved\ntherefore to maneuver a little. When Louis requested to be informed what\nit would be necessary to say on the morrow, Colbert began by expressing\nhis surprise that his majesty had not been properly informed by M.\nFouquet. \"M. Fouquet,\" he said, \"is perfectly acquainted with the whole\nof this Dutch affair--he received the dispatches himself direct.\"\n\nThe king, who was accustomed to hear M. Colbert speak in not\nover-scrupulous terms of M. Fouquet, allowed this remark to pass\nunanswered, and merely listened. Colbert noticed the effect it had\nproduced, and hastened to back out, saying that M. Fouquet was not on\nall occasions as blamable as at the first glance might seem to be the\ncase, inasmuch as at that moment he was greatly occupied. The king\nlooked up. \"What do you allude to?\" he said.\n\n\"Sire, men are but men, and M. Fouquet has his defects as well as his\ngreat qualities.\"\n\n\"Ah! defects, who is without them, M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"Your majesty, hardly,\" said Colbert, boldly; for he knew how to convey\na good deal of flattery in a light amount of blame, like the arrow which\ncleaves the air notwithstanding its weight, thanks to the light feathers\nwhich bear it up.\n\nThe king smiled. \"What defect has M. Fouquet, then?\" he said.\n\n\"Still the same, sire; it is said he is in love.\"\n\n\"In love! with whom?\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure, sire; I have very little to do with matters of\ngallantry.\"\n\n\"At all events you know, since you speak of it.\"\n\n\"I have heard a name mentioned.\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\n\"I cannot now remember whose, but I think it is one of Madame's maids of\nhonor.\"\n\nThe king started. \"You know more than you like to say, M. Colbert,\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\"I assure you, no, sire.\"\n\n\"At all events, Madame's maids of honor are all known, and in mentioning\ntheir names to you, you will perhaps recollect the one you allude to.\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"At least, try.\"\n\n\"It would be useless, sire. Whenever the name of any lady who runs the\nrisk of being compromised is concerned, my memory is like a coffer of\nbronze, the key of which I have lost.\"\n\nA dark cloud seemed to pass over the mind as well as across the face\nof the king; then, wishing to appear as if he were perfect master of\nhimself and his feelings, he said, \"And now for the affair concerning\nHolland.\"\n\n\"In the first place, sire, at what hour will your majesty receive the\nambassadors?\"\n\n\"Early in the morning.\"\n\n\"Eleven o'clock?\"\n\n\"That is too late--say nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"That will be too early, sire.\"\n\n\"For friends, that would be a matter of no importance; one does what one\nlikes with one's friends; but for one's enemies, in that case nothing\ncould be better than if they _were_ to feel hurt. I should not be sorry,\nI confess, to have to finish altogether with these marsh-birds, who\nannoy me with their cries.\"\n\n\"It shall be precisely as your majesty desires. At nine o'clock,\ntherefore--I will give the necessary orders. Is it to be a formal\naudience?\"\n\n\"No. I wish to have an explanation with them, and not to embitter\nmatters, as is always the case when many persons are present, but, at\nthe same time, I wish to clear up everything with them, in order not to\nhave to begin over again.\"\n\n\"Your majesty will inform me of the persons whom you wish to be present\nat the reception.\"\n\n\"I will draw out a list. Let us speak of the ambassadors; what do they\nwant?\"\n\n\"Allies with Spain, they gain nothing; allies with France, they lose\nmuch.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Allied with Spain, they see themselves bounded and protected by the\npossessions of their allies; they cannot touch them, however anxious\nthey may be to do so. From Antwerp to Rotterdam is but a step, and that\nby the way of the Scheldt and the Meuse. If they wish to make a bite at\nthe Spanish cake, you, sire, the son-in-law of the king of Spain, could\nwith your cavalry sweep the earth from your dominions to Brussels in a\ncouple of days. Their design is, therefore, only to quarrel so far with\nyou, and only to make you suspect Spain so far, as will be sufficient to\ninduce you not to interfere with their own affairs.\"\n\n\"It would be far more simple, I should imagine,\" replied the king,\n\"to form a solid alliance with me, by means of which I should gain\nsomething, while they would gain everything.\"\n\n\"Not so; for if, by chance, they were to have you, or France rather, as\na boundary, your majesty is not an agreeable neighbor. Young, ardent,\nwarlike, the king of France might inflict some serious mischief on\nHolland, especially if he were to get near her.\"\n\n\"I perfectly understand, M. Colbert, and you have explained it very\nclearly; but be good enough to tell me the conclusion you have arrived\nat.\"\n\n\"Your majesty's own decisions are never deficient in wisdom.\"\n\n\"What will these ambassadors say to me?\"\n\n\"They will tell your majesty that they are ardently desirous of forming\nan alliance with you, which will be a falsehood: they will tell Spain\nthat the three powers ought to unite so as to check the prosperity\nof England, and that will equally be a falsehood; for at present, the\nnatural ally of your majesty is England, who has ships while we have\nnone; England, who can counteract Dutch influence in India; England, in\nfact, a monarchical country, to which your majesty is attached by ties\nof relationship.\"\n\n\"Good; but how would you answer?\"\n\n\"I should answer, sire, with the greatest possible moderation of tone,\nthat the disposition of Holland does not seem friendly towards the\nCourt of France; that the symptoms of public feeling among the Dutch are\nalarming as regards your majesty; that certain medals have been struck\nwith insulting devices.\"\n\n\"Towards me?\" exclaimed the young king, excitedly.\n\n\"Oh, no! sire, no; insulting is not the word; I was mistaken, I ought to\nhave said immeasurably flattering to the Dutch.\"\n\n\"Oh! if that be so, the pride of the Dutch is a matter of indifference\nto me,\" said the king, sighing.\n\n\"Your majesty is right, a thousand times right. However, it is never\na mistake in politics, your majesty knows better than myself, to\nexaggerate a little in order to obtain a concession in your own\nfavor. If your majesty were to complain as if your susceptibility were\noffended, you would stand in a far higher position with them.\"\n\n\"What are these medals you speak of?\" inquired Louis; \"for if I allude\nto them, I ought to know what to say.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sire, I cannot very well tell you--some overweeningly\nconceited device--that is the sense of it; the words have little to do\nwith the thing itself.\"\n\n\"Very good! I will mention the word 'medal,' and they can understand it\nif they like.\"\n\n\"Oh! they will understand without any difficulty. Your majesty can also\nslip in a few words about certain pamphlets which are being circulated.\"\n\n\"Never! Pamphlets befoul those who write them much more than those\nagainst whom they are written. M. Colbert, I thank you. You can leave\nnow. Do not forget the hour I have fixed, and be there yourself.\"\n\n\"Sire, I await your majesty's list.\"\n\n\"True,\" returned the king; and he began to meditate; he had not thought\nof the list in the least. The clock struck half-past eleven. The king's\nface revealed a violent conflict between pride and love. The political\nconversation had dispelled a good deal of the irritation which Louis had\nfelt, and La Valliere's pale, worn features, in his imagination, spoke\na very different language from that of the Dutch medals, or the Batavian\npamphlets. He sat for ten minutes debating within himself whether he\nshould or should not return to La Valliere; but Colbert having with some\nurgency respectfully requested that the list might be furnished him,\nthe king was ashamed to be thinking of mere matters of affection where\nimportant state affairs required his attention. He therefore dictated:\nthe queen-mother, the queen, Madame, Madame de Motteville, Madame de\nChatillon, Madame de Navailles; and, for the men, M. le Prince, M. de\nGramont, M. de Manicamp, M. de Saint-Aignan, and the officers on duty.\n\n\"The ministers?\" asked Colbert.\n\n\"As a matter of course, and the secretaries also.\"\n\n\"Sire, I will leave at once in order to get everything prepared; the\norders will be at the different residences to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Say rather to-day,\" replied Louis mournfully, as the clock struck\ntwelve. It was the very hour when poor La Valliere was almost dying from\nanguish and bitter suffering. The king's attendants entered, it being\nthe hour of his retirement to his chamber; the queen, indeed, had\nbeen waiting for more than an hour. Louis accordingly retreated to his\nbedroom with a sigh; but, as he sighed, he congratulated himself on his\ncourage, and applauded himself for having been as firm in love as in\naffairs of state.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII. The Ambassadors.\n\nD'Artagnan had, with very few exceptions, learned almost all of the\nparticulars of what we have just been relating; for among his friends\nhe reckoned all the useful, serviceable people in the royal\nhousehold,--officious attendants who were proud of being recognized\nby the captain of the musketeers, for the captain's influence was\nvery great; and then, in addition to any ambitious views they may have\nimagined he could promote, they were proud of being regarded as\nworth being spoken to by a man as brave as D'Artagnan. In this manner\nD'Artagnan learned every morning what he had not been able either to see\nor to ascertain the night before, from the simple fact of his not being\nubiquitous; so that, with the information he had been able by his own\nmeans to pick up during the day, and with what he had gathered from\nothers, he succeeded in making up a bundle of weapons, which he was in\nthe prudent habit of using only when occasion required. In this way,\nD'Artagnan's two eyes rendered him the same service as the hundred eyes\nof Argus. Political secrets, bedside revelations, hints or scraps of\nconversation dropped by the courtiers on the threshold of the royal\nante-chamber, in this way D'Artagnan managed to ascertain, and to store\naway everything in the vast and impenetrable mausoleum of his memory,\nby the side of those royal secrets so dearly bought and faithfully\npreserved. He therefore knew of the king's interview with Colbert,\nand of the appointment made for the ambassadors in the morning, and,\nconsequently, that the question of the medals would be brought up for\ndebate; and, while he was arranging and constructing the conversation\nupon a few chance words which had reached his ears, he returned to his\npost in the royal apartments, so as to be there at the very moment the\nking awoke. It happened that the king rose very early,--proving thereby\nthat he, too, on his side, had slept but indifferently. Towards seven\no'clock, he half-opened his door very gently. D'Artagnan was at his\npost. His majesty was pale, and seemed wearied; he had not, moreover,\nquite finished dressing.\n\n\"Send for M. de Saint-Aignan,\" he said.\n\nSaint-Aignan was probably awaiting a summons, for the messenger, when he\nreached his apartment, found him already dressed. Saint-Aignan hastened\nto the king in obedience to the summons. A moment afterwards the king\nand Saint-Aignan passed by together--the king walking first. D'Artagnan\nwent to the window which looked out upon the courtyard; he had no need\nto put himself to the trouble of watching in what direction the king\nwent, for he had no difficulty in guessing beforehand where his majesty\nwas going. The king, in fact, bent his steps towards the apartments\nof the maids of honor,--a circumstance which in no way astonished\nD'Artagnan, for he more than suspected, although La Valliere had not\nbreathed a syllable on the subject, that the king had some kind of\nreparation to make. Saint-Aignan followed him as he had done the\nprevious evening, rather less uneasy in his mind, though still slightly\nagitated, for he fervently trusted that at seven o'clock in the morning\nthere might be only himself and the king awake amongst the august guests\nat the palace. D'Artagnan stood at the window, careless and perfectly\ncalm in his manner. One could almost have sworn that he noticed nothing,\nand was utterly ignorant who were these two hunters after adventures,\npassing like shadows across the courtyard, wrapped up in their cloaks.\nAnd yet, all the while that D'Artagnan appeared not to be looking at\nthem at all, he did not for one moment lose sight of them, and while\nhe whistled that old march of the musketeers, which he rarely recalled\nexcept under great emergencies, he conjectured and prophesied how\nterrible would be the storm which would be raised on the king's return.\nIn fact, when the king entered La Valliere's apartment and found the\nroom empty and the bed untouched, he began to be alarmed, and called out\nto Montalais, who immediately answered the summons; but her astonishment\nwas equal to the king's. All that she could tell his majesty was, that\nshe had fancied she had heard La Valliere's weeping during a portion of\nthe night, but, knowing that his majesty had paid her a visit, she had\nnot dared to inquire what was the matter.\n\n\"But,\" inquired the king, \"where do you suppose she is gone?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Montalais, \"Louise is of a very sentimental disposition,\nand as I have often seen her rise at daybreak in order to go out into\nthe garden, she may, perhaps, be there now.\"\n\nThis appeared probable, and the king immediately ran down the staircase\nin search of the fugitive. D'Artagnan saw him grow very pale, and\ntalking in an excited manner with his companion, as he went towards the\ngardens; Saint-Aignan following him, out of breath. D'Artagnan did\nnot stir from the window, but went on whistling, looking as if he saw\nnothing, yet seeing everything. \"Come, come,\" he murmured, when the king\ndisappeared, \"his majesty's passion is stronger than I thought; he is\nnow doing, I think, what he never did for Mademoiselle de Mancini.\" [6]\n\nIn a quarter of an hour the king again appeared: he had looked\neverywhere, was completely out of breath, and, as a matter of course,\nhad not discovered anything. Saint-Aignan, who still followed him,\nwas fanning himself with his hat, and in a gasping voice, asking for\ninformation about La Valliere from such of the servants as were about,\nin fact from every one he met. Among others he came across Manicamp,\nwho had arrived from Fontainebleau by easy stages; for whilst others had\nperformed the journey in six hours, he had taken four and twenty.\n\n\"Have you seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\" Saint-Aignan asked him.\n\nWhereupon Manicamp, dreamy and absent as usual, answered, thinking that\nsome one was asking him about De Guiche, \"Thank you, the comte is a\nlittle better.\"\n\nAnd he continued on his way until he reached the ante-chamber where\nD'Artagnan was, whom he asked to explain how it was that the king\nlooked, as he thought, so bewildered; to which D'Artagnan replied that\nhe was quite mistaken, that the king, on the contrary, was as lively and\nmerry as he could possibly be.\n\nIn the midst of all this, eight o'clock struck. It was usual for the\nking to take his breakfast at this hour, for the code of etiquette\nprescribed that the king should always be hungry at eight o'clock. His\nbreakfast was laid upon a small table in his bedroom, and he ate very\nfast. Saint-Aignan, of whom he would not lose sight, waited on the\nking. He then disposed of several military audiences, during which\nhe dispatched Saint-Aignan to see what he could find out. Then, still\noccupied, full of anxiety, still watching Saint-Aignan's return, who had\nsent out the servants in every direction, to make inquires, and who\nhad also gone himself, the hour of nine struck, and the king forthwith\npassed into his large cabinet.\n\nAs the clock was striking nine the ambassadors entered, and as it\nfinished, the two queens and Madame made their appearance. There were\nthree ambassadors from Holland, and two from Spain. The king glanced at\nthem, and then bowed; and, at the same moment, Saint-Aignan entered,--an\nentrance which the king regarded as far more important, in a different\nsense, however, than that of ambassadors, however numerous they might\nbe, and from whatever country they came; and so, setting everything\naside, the king made a sign of interrogation to Saint-Aignan, which the\nlatter answered by a most decisive negative. The king almost entirely\nlost his courage; but as the queens, the members of the nobility who\nwere present, and the ambassadors, had their eyes fixed upon him, he\novercame his emotion by a violent effort, and invited the latter to\nspeak. Whereupon one of the Spanish deputies made a long oration, in\nwhich he boasted the advantages which the Spanish alliance would offer.\n\nThe king interrupted him, saying, \"Monsieur, I trust that whatever is\nbest for France must be exceedingly advantageous for Spain.\"\n\nThis remark, and particularly the peremptory tone in which it was\npronounced, made the ambassadors pale, and brought the color into the\ncheeks of the two queens, who, being Spanish, felt wounded in their\npride of relationship and nationality by this reply.\n\nThe Dutch ambassador then began to address himself to the king, and\ncomplained of the injurious suspicions which the king exhibited against\nthe government of his country.\n\nThe king interrupted him, saying, \"It is very singular, monsieur, that\nyou should come with any complaint, when it is I rather who have reason\nto be dissatisfied; and yet, you see, I do not complain.\"\n\n\"Complain, sire, and in what respect?\"\n\nThe king smiled bitterly. \"Will you blame me, monsieur,\" he said, \"if\nI should happen to entertain suspicions against a government which\nauthorizes and protects international impertinence?\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" resumed the king, exciting himself by a recollection of\nhis own personal annoyance, rather than from political grounds, \"that\nHolland is a land of refuge for all who hate me, and especially for all\nwho malign me.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\"\n\n\"You wish for proofs, perhaps? Very good; they can be had easily enough.\nWhence proceed all those vile and insolent pamphlets which represent me\nas a monarch without glory and without authority? your printing-presses\ngroan under their number. If my secretaries were here, I would mention\nthe titles of the works as well as the names of the printers.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the ambassador, \"a pamphlet can hardly be regarded as\nthe work of a whole nation. Is it just, is it reasonable, that a great\nand powerful monarch like your majesty should render a whole nation\nresponsible for the crime of a few madmen, who are, perhaps, only\nscribbling in a garret for a few sous to buy bread for their family?\"\n\n\"That may be the case, I admit. But when the mint itself, at Amsterdam,\nstrikes off medals which reflect disgrace upon me, is that also the\ncrime of a few madmen?\"\n\n\"Medals!\" stammered out the ambassador.\n\n\"Medals,\" repeated the king, looking at Colbert.\n\n\"Your majesty,\" the ambassador ventured, \"should be quite sure--\"\n\nThe king still looked at Colbert; but Colbert appeared not to understand\nhim, and maintained an unbroken silence, notwithstanding the king's\nrepeated hints. D'Artagnan then approached the king, and taking a piece\nof money out of his pocket, he placed it in the king's hands, saying,\n\"_This_ is the medal your majesty alludes to.\"\n\nThe king looked at it, and with a look which, ever since he had become\nhis own master, was ever piercing as the eagle's, observed an insulting\ndevice representing Holland arresting the progress of the sun, with this\ninscription: \"_In conspectu meo stetit sol_.\"\n\n\"In my presence the sun stands still,\" exclaimed the king, furiously.\n\"Ah! you will hardly deny it now, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And the sun,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is this,\" as he pointed to the panels\nof the cabinet, where the sun was brilliantly represented in every\ndirection, with this motto, \"_Nec pluribus impar_.\" [7]\n\nLouis's anger, increased by the bitterness of his own personal\nsufferings, hardly required this additional circumstance to foment it.\nEvery one saw, from the kindling passion in the king's eyes, that an\nexplosion was imminent. A look from Colbert kept postponed the bursting\nof the storm. The ambassador ventured to frame excuses by saying that\nthe vanity of nations was a matter of little consequence; that Holland\nwas proud that, with such limited resources, she had maintained her rank\nas a great nation, even against powerful monarchs, and that if a little\nsmoke had intoxicated his countrymen, the king would be kindly disposed,\nand would even excuse this intoxication. The king seemed as if he\nwould be glad of some suggestion; he looked at Colbert, who remained\nimpassible; then at D'Artagnan, who simply shrugged his shoulders, a\nmovement which was like the opening of the flood-gates, whereby the\nking's anger, which he had restrained for so long a period, now burst\nforth. As no one knew what direction his anger might take, all preserved\na dead silence. The second ambassador took advantage of it to begin his\nexcuses also. While he was speaking, and while the king, who had again\ngradually returned to his own personal reflections, was automatically\nlistening to the voice, full of nervous anxiety, with the air of an\nabsent man listening to the murmuring of a cascade, D'Artagnan, on whose\nleft hand Saint-Aignan was standing, approached the latter, and, in a\nvoice which was loud enough to reach the king's ears, said: \"Have you\nheard the news?\"\n\n\"What news?\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"About La Valliere.\"\n\nThe king started, and advanced his head.\n\n\"What has happened to La Valliere?\" inquired Saint-Aignan, in a tone\nwhich can easily be imagined.\n\n\"Ah! poor girl! she is going to take the veil.\"\n\n\"The veil!\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"The veil!\" cried the king, in the midst of the ambassador's discourse;\nbut then, mindful of the rules of etiquette, he mastered himself, still\nlistening, however, with rapt attention.\n\n\"What order?\" inquired Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"The Carmelites of Chaillot.\"\n\n\"Who the deuce told you that?\"\n\n\"She did herself.\"\n\n\"You have seen her, then?\"\n\n\"Nay, I even went with her to the Carmelites.\"\n\nThe king did not lose a syllable of this conversation; and again he\ncould hardly control his feelings.\n\n\"But what was the cause of her flight?\" inquired Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Because the poor girl was driven away from the court yesterday,\"\nreplied D'Artagnan.\n\nHe had no sooner said this, than the king, with an authoritative\ngesture, said to the ambassador, \"Enough, monsieur, enough.\" Then,\nadvancing towards the captain, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Who says Mademoiselle de la Valliere is going to take the religious\nvows?\"\n\n\"M. d'Artagnan,\" answered the favorite.\n\n\"Is it true what you say?\" said the king, turning towards the musketeer.\n\n\"As true as truth itself.\"\n\nThe king clenched his hands, and turned pale.\n\n\"You have something further to add, M. d'Artagnan?\" he said.\n\n\"I know nothing more, sire.\"\n\n\"You added that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had been driven away from\nthe court.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Is that true, also?\"\n\n\"Ascertain for yourself, sire.\"\n\n\"And from whom?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed D'Artagnan, like a man who is declining to say anything\nfurther.\n\nThe king almost bounded from his seat, regardless of ambassadors,\nministers, courtiers, queens, and politics. The queen-mother rose;\nshe had heard everything, or, if she had not heard everything, she had\nguessed it. Madame, almost fainting from anger and fear, endeavored\nto rise as the queen-mother had done; but she sank down again upon her\nchair, which by an instinctive movement she made roll back a few paces.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the king, \"the audience is over; I will communicate my\nanswer, or rather my will, to Spain and to Holland;\" and with a proud,\nimperious gesture, he dismissed the ambassadors.\n\n\"Take care, my son,\" said the queen-mother, indignantly, \"you are hardly\nmaster of yourself, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah! madame,\" returned the young lion, with a terrible gesture, \"if I\nam not master of myself, I will be, I promise you, of those who do me a\ndeadly injury; come with me, M. d'Artagnan, come.\" And he quitted the\nroom in the midst of general stupefaction and dismay. The king hastily\ndescended the staircase, and was about to cross the courtyard.\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"your majesty mistakes the way.\"\n\n\"No; I am going to the stables.\"\n\n\"That is useless, sire, for I have horses ready for your majesty.\"\n\nThe king's only answer was a look, but this look promised more than the\nambition of three D'Artagnans could have dared to hope.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX. Chaillot.\n\nAlthough they had not been summoned, Manicamp and Malicorne had followed\nthe king and D'Artagnan. They were both exceedingly intelligent men;\nexcept that Malicorne was too precipitate, owing to ambition, while\nManicamp was frequently too tardy, owing to indolence. On this occasion,\nhowever, they arrived at precisely the proper moment. Five horses were\nin readiness. Two were seized upon by the king and D'Artagnan, two\nothers by Manicamp and Malicorne, while a groom belonging to the stables\nmounted the fifth. The cavalcade set off at a gallop. D'Artagnan had\nbeen very careful in his selection of the horses; they were the very\nanimals for distressed lovers--horses which did not simply run, but\nflew. Within ten minutes after their departure, the cavalcade, amidst a\ncloud of dust, arrived at Chaillot. The king literally threw himself off\nhis horse; but notwithstanding the rapidity with which he accomplished\nthis maneuver, he found D'Artagnan already holding his stirrup. With\na sign of acknowledgement to the musketeer, he threw the bridle to the\ngroom, and darted into the vestibule, violently pushed open the door,\nand entered the reception-room. Manicamp, Malicorne, and the groom\nremained outside, D'Artagnan alone following him. When he entered the\nreception-room, the first object which met his gaze was Louise herself,\nnot simply on her knees, but lying at the foot of a large stone\ncrucifix. The young girl was stretched upon the damp flag-stones,\nscarcely visible in the gloom of the apartment, which was lighted only\nby means of a narrow window, protected by bars and completely shaded by\ncreeping plants. When the king saw her in this state, he thought she was\ndead, and uttered a loud cry, which made D'Artagnan hurry into the\nroom. The king had already passed one of his arms round her body, and\nD'Artagnan assisted him in raising the poor girl, whom the torpor of\ndeath seemed already to have taken possession of. D'Artagnan seized hold\nof the alarm-bell and rang with all his might. The Carmelite sisters\nimmediately hastened at the summons, and uttered loud exclamations of\nalarm and indignation at the sight of the two men holding a woman in\ntheir arms. The superior also hurried to the scene of action, but far\nmore a creature of the world than any of the female members of the\ncourt, notwithstanding her austerity of manners, she recognized the king\nat the first glance, by the respect which those present exhibited for\nhim, as well as by the imperious and authoritative way in which he had\nthrown the whole establishment into confusion. As soon as she saw the\nking, she retired to her own apartments, in order to avoid compromising\nher dignity. But by one of the nuns she sent various cordials, Hungary\nwater, etc., etc., and ordered that all the doors should immediately be\nclosed, a command which was just in time, for the king's distress was\nfast becoming of a most clamorous and despairing character. He had\nalmost decided to send for his own physician, when La Valliere exhibited\nsigns of returning animation. The first object which met her gaze, as\nshe opened her eyes, was the king at her feet; in all probability she\ndid not recognize him, for she uttered a deep sigh full of anguish and\ndistress. Louis fixed his eyes devouringly upon her face; and when, in\nthe course of a few moments, she recognized Louis, she endeavored to\ntear herself from his embrace.\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" she murmured, \"is not the sacrifice yet made?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the king, \"and it shall _not_ be made, I swear.\"\n\nNotwithstanding her weakness and utter despair, she rose from the\nground, saying, \"It must be made, however; it must be; so do not stay me\nin my purpose.\"\n\n\"I leave you to sacrifice yourself! I! never, never!\" exclaimed the\nking.\n\n\"Well,\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"I may as well go now. As soon as they\nbegin to speak, we may as well prevent there being any listeners.\" And\nhe quitted the room, leaving the lovers alone.\n\n\"Sire,\" continued La Valliere, \"not another word, I implore you. Do not\ndestroy the only future I can hope for--my salvation; do not destroy the\nglory and brightness of your own future for a mere caprice.\"\n\n\"A caprice?\" cried the king.\n\n\"Oh, sire! it is now, only, that I can see clearly into your heart.\"\n\n\"You, Louise, what mean you?\"\n\n\"An inexplicable impulse, foolish and unreasonable in its nature, may\nephemerally appear to offer a sufficient excuse for your conduct; but\nthere are duties imposed upon you which are incompatible with your\nregard for a poor girl such as I am. So, forget me.\"\n\n\"I forget you!\"\n\n\"You have already done so, once.\"\n\n\"Rather would I die.\"\n\n\"You cannot love one whose peace of mind you hold so lightly, and whom\nyou so cruelly abandoned, last night, to the bitterness of death.\"\n\n\"What can you mean? Explain yourself, Louise.\"\n\n\"What did you ask me yesterday morning? To love you. What did you\npromise me in return? Never to let midnight pass without offering me an\nopportunity of reconciliation, if, by any chance, your anger should be\nroused against me.\"\n\n\"Oh! forgive me, Louise, forgive me! I was mad from jealousy.\"\n\n\"Jealousy is a sentiment unworthy of a king--a man. You may become\njealous again, and will end by killing me. Be merciful, then, and leave\nme now to die.\"\n\n\"Another word, mademoiselle, in that strain, and you will see me expire\nat your feet.\"\n\n\"No, no, sire, I am better acquainted with my own demerits; and believe\nme, that to sacrifice yourself for one whom all despise, would be\nneedless.\"\n\n\"Give me the names of those you have cause to complain of.\"\n\n\"I have no complaints, sire, to prefer against any one; no one but\nmyself to accuse. Farewell, sire; you are compromising yourself in\nspeaking to me in such a manner.\"\n\n\"Oh! be careful, Louise, in what you say; for you are reducing me to the\ndarkness of despair.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, sire, leave me at least the protection of Heaven, I implore\nyou.\"\n\n\"No, no; Heaven itself shall not tear you from me.\"\n\n\"Save me, then,\" cried the poor girl, \"from those determined and\npitiless enemies who are thirsting to annihilate my life and honor too.\nIf you have courage enough to love me, show at least that you have power\nenough to defend me. But no; she whom you say you love, others insult\nand mock, and drive shamelessly away.\" And the gentle-hearted girl,\nforced, by her own bitter distress to accuse others, wrung her hands in\nan uncontrollable agony of tears.\n\n\"You have been driven away!\" exclaimed the king. \"This is the second\ntime I have heard that said.\"\n\n\"I have been driven away with shame and ignominy, sire. You see, then,\nthat I have no other protector but Heaven, no consolation but prayer,\nand this cloister is my only refuge.\"\n\n\"My palace, my whole court, shall be your park of peace. Oh! fear\nnothing further now, Louise; those--be they men or women--who yesterday\ndrove you away, shall to-morrow tremble before you--to-morrow, do I say?\nnay, this very day I have already shown my displeasure--have already\nthreatened. It is in my power, even now, to hurl the thunderbolt I have\nhitherto withheld. Louise, Louise, you shall be bitterly revenged; tears\nof blood shall repay you for the tears you have shed. Give me only the\nnames of your enemies.\"\n\n\"Never, never.\"\n\n\"How can I show any anger, then?\"\n\n\"Sire, those upon whom your anger would be prepared to fall, would force\nyou to draw back your hand upraised to punish.\"\n\n\"Oh! you do not know me,\" cried the king, exasperated. \"Rather than draw\nback, I would sacrifice my kingdom, and would abjure my family. Yes,\nI would strike until this arm had utterly destroyed all those who had\nventured to make themselves the enemies of the gentlest and best of\ncreatures.\" And, as he said these words, Louis struck his fist violently\nagainst the oaken wainscoting with a force which alarmed La Valliere;\nfor his anger, owing to his unbounded power, had something imposing\nand threatening in it, like the lightning, which may at any time prove\ndeadly. She, who thought that her own sufferings could not be surpassed,\nwas overwhelmed by a suffering which revealed itself by menace and by\nviolence.\n\n\"Sire,\" she said, \"for the last time I implore you to leave me; already\ndo I feel strengthened by the calm seclusion of this asylum; and the\nprotection of Heaven has reassured me; for all the pretty human meanness\nof this world are forgotten beneath the Divine protection. Once more,\nthen, sire, and for the last time, I again implore you to leave me.\"\n\n\"Confess, rather,\" cried Louis, \"that you have never loved me; admit\nthat my humility and my repentance are flattering to your pride, but\nthat my distress affects you not; that the king of this wide realm is\nno longer regarded as a lover whose tenderness of devotion is capable\nof working out your happiness, but as a despot whose caprice has crushed\nyour very heart beneath his iron heel. Do not say you are seeking\nHeaven, say rather you are fleeing from the king.\"\n\nLouise's heart was wrung within her, as she listened to his passionate\nutterance, which made the fever of hope course once more through her\nevery vein.\n\n\"But did you not hear me say that I have been driven away, scorned,\ndespised?\"\n\n\"I will make you the most respected, and most adored, and the most\nenvied of my whole court.\"\n\n\"Prove to me that you have not ceased to love me.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"By leaving me.\"\n\n\"I will prove it to you by never leaving you again.\"\n\n\"But do you imagine, sire, that I shall allow that; do you imagine that\nI will let you come to an open rupture with every member of your family;\ndo you imagine that, for my sake, you could abandon mother, wife and\nsister?\"\n\n\"Ah! you have named them, then, at last; it is they, then, who have\nwrought this grievous injury? By the heaven above us, then, upon them\nshall my anger fall.\"\n\n\"That is the reason why the future terrifies me, why I refuse\neverything, why I do not wish you to revenge me. Tears enough have\nalready been shed, sufficient sorrow and affliction have already\nbeen occasioned. I, at least, will never be the cause of sorrow, or\naffliction, or distress to whomsoever it may be, for I have mourned and\nsuffered, and wept too much myself.\"\n\n\"And do you count _my_ sufferings, _my_ tears, as nothing?\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name, sire, do not speak to me in that manner. I need all\nmy courage to enable me to accomplish the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Louise, Louise, I implore you! whatever you desire, whatever you\ncommand, whether vengeance or forgiveness, your slightest wish shall be\nobeyed, but do not abandon me.\"\n\n\"Alas! sire, we must part.\"\n\n\"You do not love me, then!\"\n\n\"Heaven knows I do!\"\n\n\"It is false, Louise; it is false.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, if I did not love you, I should let you do what you please;\nI should let you revenge me, in return for the insult which has been\ninflicted on me; I should accept the brilliant triumph to my pride\nwhich you propose; and yet, you cannot deny that I reject even the sweet\ncompensation which your affection affords, that affection which for me\nis life itself, for I wished to die when I thought that you loved me no\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I now know, I now perceive it; you are the sweetest, best,\nand purest of women. There is no one so worthy as yourself, not alone of\nmy respect and devotion, but also of the respect and devotion of all who\nsurround me; and therefore no one shall be loved like yourself; no one\nshall ever possess the influence over me that you wield. You wish me to\nbe calm, to forgive?--be it so, you shall find me perfectly unmoved. You\nwish to reign by gentleness and clemency?--I will be clement and\ngentle. Dictate for me the conduct you wish me to adopt, and I will obey\nblindly.\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name, no, sire; what am I, a poor girl, to dictate to so\ngreat a monarch as yourself?\"\n\n\"You are my life, the very spirit and principle of my being. Is it not\nthe spirit that rules the body?\"\n\n\"You love me, then, sire?\"\n\n\"On my knees, yes; with my hands upraised to you, yes; with all the\nstrength and power of my being, yes; I love you so deeply, that I would\nlay down my life for you, gladly, at your merest wish.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, now I know you love me, I have nothing to wish for in the\nworld. Give me your hand, sire; and then, farewell! I have enjoyed in\nthis life all the happiness I was ever meant for.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no! your happiness is not a happiness of yesterday, it is of\nto-day, of to-morrow, ever enduring. The future is yours, everything\nwhich is mine is yours, too. Away with these ideas of separation, away\nwith these gloomy, despairing thoughts. You will live for me, as I will\nlive for you, Louise.\" And he threw himself at her feet, embracing her\nknees with the wildest transports of joy and gratitude.\n\n\"Oh! sire, sire! all that is but a wild dream.\"\n\n\"Why, a wild dream?\"\n\n\"Because I cannot return to the court. Exiled, how can I see you again?\nWould it not be far better to bury myself in a cloister for the rest of\nmy life, with the rich consolation that your affection gives me, with\nthe pulses of your heart beating for me, and your latest confession of\nattachment still ringing in my ears?\"\n\n\"Exiled, you!\" exclaimed Louis XIV., \"and who dares to exile, let me\nask, when I recall?\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, something which is greater than and superior to the kings\neven--the world and public opinion. Reflect for a moment; you cannot\nlove a woman who has been ignominiously driven away--love one whom your\nmother has stained with suspicions; one whom your sister has threatened\nwith disgrace; such a woman, indeed, would be unworthy of you.\"\n\n\"Unworthy! one who belongs to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, precisely on that account; from the very moment she belongs\nto you, the character of your mistress renders her unworthy.\"\n\n\"You are right, Louise; every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours.\nVery well, you shall not be exiled.\"\n\n\"Ah! from the tone in which you speak, you have not heard Madame, that\nis very clear.\"\n\n\"I will appeal from her to my mother.\"\n\n\"Again, sire, you have not seen your mother.\"\n\n\"She, too!--my poor Louise! every one's hand, then, is against you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, poor Louise, who was already bending beneath the fury of\nthe storm, when you arrived and crushed her beneath the weight of your\ndispleasure.\"\n\n\"Oh! forgive me.\"\n\n\"You will not, I know, be able to make either of them yield; believe me,\nthe evil cannot be repaired, for I will not allow you to use violence,\nor to exercise your authority.\"\n\n\"Very well, Louise, to prove to you how fondly I love you, I will do one\nthing, I will see Madame; I will make her revoke her sentence, I will\ncompel her to do so.\"\n\n\"Compel? Oh! no, no!\"\n\n\"True; you are right. I will bend her.\"\n\nLouise shook her head.\n\n\"I will entreat her, if it be necessary,\" said Louis. \"Will you believe\nin my affection after that?\"\n\nLouise drew herself up. \"Oh, never, never shall you humiliate yourself\non my account; sooner, a thousand times, would I die.\"\n\nLouis reflected; his features assumed a dark expression. \"I will love\nyou as much as you have loved; I will suffer as keenly as you have\nsuffered; this shall be my expiation in your eyes. Come, mademoiselle,\nput aside these paltry considerations; let us show ourselves as great as\nour sufferings, as strong as our affection for each other.\" And, as he\nsaid this, he took her in his arms, and encircled her waist with both\nhis hands, saying, \"My own love! my own dearest and best beloved, follow\nme.\"\n\nShe made a final effort, in which she concentrated, no longer all of\nher firmness of will, for that had long since been overcome, but all her\nphysical strength. \"No!\" she replied, weakly, \"no! no! I should die from\nshame.\"\n\n\"No! you shall return like a queen. No one knows of your having\nleft--except, indeed, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"He has betrayed me, then?\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"He promised faithfully--\"\n\n\"I promised not to say anything to the king,\" said D'Artagnan, putting\nhis head through the half-opened door, \"and I kept my word; I was\nspeaking to M. de Saint-Aignan, and it was not my fault if the king\noverheard me; was it, sire?\"\n\n\"It is quite true,\" said the king; \"forgive him.\"\n\nLa Valliere smiled, and held out her small white hand to the musketeer.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the king, \"be good enough to see if you can\nfind a carriage for Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the captain, \"the carriage is waiting at the gate.\"\n\n\"You are a magic mould of forethought,\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"You have taken a long time to find it out,\" muttered D'Artagnan,\nnotwithstanding he was flattered by the praise bestowed upon him.\n\nLa Valliere was overcome: after a little further hesitation, she allowed\nherself to be led away, half fainting, by her royal lover. But, as she\nwas on the point of leaving the room, she tore herself from the king's\ngrasp, and returned to the stone crucifix, which she kissed, saying,\n\"Oh, Heaven! it was thou who drewest me hither! thou, who has rejected\nme; but thy grace is infinite. Whenever I shall again return, forget\nthat I have ever separated myself from thee, for, when I return it will\nbe--never to leave thee again.\"\n\nThe king could not restrain his emotion, and D'Artagnan, even, was\novercome. Louis led the young girl away, lifted her into the carriage,\nand directed D'Artagnan to seat himself beside her, while he,\nmounting his horse, spurred violently towards the Palais Royal, where,\nimmediately on his arrival, he sent to request an audience of Madame.\n\n\n\nChapter XXX. Madame.\n\nFrom the manner in which the king had dismissed the ambassadors, even\nthe least clear-sighted persons belonging to the court imagined war\nwould ensue. The ambassadors themselves, but slightly acquainted with\nthe king's domestic disturbances, had interpreted as directed against\nthemselves the celebrated sentence: \"If I be not master of myself, I, at\nleast, will be so of those who insult me.\" Happily for the destinies of\nFrance and Holland, Colbert had followed them out of the king's presence\nfor the purpose of explaining matters to them; but the two queens and\nMadame, who were perfectly aware of every particular that had taken\nplace in their several households, having heard the king's remark, so\nfull of dark meaning, retired to their own apartments in no little fear\nand chagrin. Madame, especially, felt that the royal anger might fall\nupon her, and, as she was brave and exceedingly proud, instead of\nseeking support and encouragement from the queen-mother, she had\nreturned to her own apartments, if not without some uneasiness, at least\nwithout any intention of avoiding an encounter. Anne of Austria, from\ntime to time at frequent intervals, sent messages to learn if the king\nhad returned. The silence which the whole palace preserved upon the\nmatter, and upon Louise's disappearance, was indicative of a long train\nof misfortunes to all those who knew the haughty and irritable humor of\nthe king. But Madame, unmoved in spite of all the flying rumors, shut\nherself up in her apartments, sent for Montalais, and, with a voice as\ncalm as she could possibly command, desired her to relate all she knew\nabout the event itself. At the moment that the eloquent Montalais\nwas concluding, with all kinds of oratorical precautions, and was\nrecommending, if not in actual language, at least in spirit, that she\nshould show forbearance towards La Valliere, M. Malicorne made his\nappearance to beg an audience of Madame, on behalf of the king.\nMontalais's worthy friend bore upon his countenance all the signs of the\nvery liveliest emotion. It was impossible to be mistaken; the interview\nwhich the king requested would be one of the most interesting chapters\nin the history of the hearts of kings and of men. Madame was disturbed\nby her brother-in-law's arrival; she did not expect it so soon, nor\nhad she, indeed, expected any direct step on Louis's part. Besides,\nall women who wage war successfully by indirect means, are invariably\nneither very skillful nor very strong when it becomes a question of\naccepting a pitched battle. Madame, however, was not one who ever drew\nback; she had the very opposite defect or qualification, in whichever\nlight it may be considered; she took an exaggerated view of what\nconstituted real courage; and therefore the king's message, of which\nMalicorne had been the bearer, was regarded by her as the bugle-note\nproclaiming the commencement of hostilities. She, therefore, boldly\naccepted the gage of battle. Five minutes afterwards the king ascended\nthe staircase. His color was heightened from having ridden hard. His\ndusty and disordered clothes formed a singular contrast with the fresh\nand perfectly arranged toilette of Madame, who, notwithstanding the\nrouge on her cheeks, turned pale as Louis entered the room. Louis\nlost no time in approaching the object of his visit; he sat down, and\nMontalais disappeared.\n\n\"My dear sister,\" said the king, \"you are aware that Mademoiselle de la\nValliere fled from her own room this morning, and that she has retired\nto a cloister, overwhelmed by grief and despair.\" As he pronounced these\nwords, the king's voice was singularly moved.\n\n\"Your majesty is the first to inform me of it,\" replied Madame.\n\n\"I should have thought that you might have learned it this morning,\nduring the reception of the ambassadors,\" said the king.\n\n\"From your emotion, sire, I imagined that something extraordinary had\nhappened, but without knowing what.\"\n\nThe king, with his usual frankness, went straight to the point. \"Why did\nyou send Mademoiselle de la Valliere away?\"\n\n\"Because I had reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct,\" she replied,\ndryly.\n\nThe king became crimson, and his eyes kindled with a fire which it\nrequired all Madame's courage to support. He mastered his anger,\nhowever, and continued: \"A stronger reason than that is surely\nrequisite, for one so good and kind as you are, to turn away and\ndishonor, not only the young girl herself, but every member of her\nfamily as well. You know that the whole city has its eyes fixed upon the\nconduct of the female portion of the court. To dismiss a maid of honor\nis to attribute a crime to her--at the very least a fault. What crime,\nwhat fault has Mademoiselle de la Valliere been guilty of?\"\n\n\"Since you constitute yourself the protector of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere,\" replied Madame, coldly, \"I will give you those explanations\nwhich I should have a perfect right to withhold from every one.\"\n\n\"Even from the king!\" exclaimed Louis, as, with a sudden gesture, he\ncovered his head with his hat.\n\n\"You have called me your sister,\" said Madame, \"and I am in my own\napartments.\"\n\n\"It matters not,\" said the youthful monarch, ashamed at having been\nhurried away by his anger; \"neither you, nor any one else in this\nkingdom, can assert a right to withhold an explanation in my presence.\"\n\n\"Since that is the way you regard it,\" said Madame, in a hoarse, angry\ntone of voice, \"all that remains for me to do is bow submission to your\nmajesty, and to be silent.\"\n\n\"Not so. Let there be no equivocation between us.\"\n\n\"The protection with which you surround Mademoiselle de la Valliere does\nnot impose any respect.\"\n\n\"No equivocation, I repeat; you are perfectly aware that, as the head of\nthe nobility in France, I am accountable to all for the honor of every\nfamily. You dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere, or whoever else it\nmay be--\" Madame shrugged her shoulders. \"Or whoever else it may be, I\nrepeat,\" continued the king; \"and as, acting in that manner, you cast a\ndishonorable reflection upon that person, I ask you for an explanation,\nin order that I may confirm or annul the sentence.\"\n\n\"Annul my sentence!\" exclaimed Madame, haughtily. \"What! when I have\ndischarged one of my attendants, do you order me to take her back\nagain?\" The king remained silent.\n\n\"This would be a sheer abuse of power, sire; it would be indecorous and\nunseemly.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"As a woman, I should revolt against an abuse so insulting to me; I\nshould no longer be able to regard myself as a princess of your blood,\na daughter of a monarch; I should be the meanest of creatures, more\nhumbled and disgraced than the servant I had sent away.\"\n\nThe king rose from his seat with anger. \"It cannot be a heart,\" he\ncried, \"you have beating in your bosom; if you act in such a way with\nme, I may have reason to act with corresponding severity.\"\n\nIt sometimes happens that in a battle a chance ball may reach its\nmark. The observation which the king had made without any particular\nintention, struck Madame home, and staggered her for a moment; some\nday or other she might indeed have reason to dread reprisals. \"At all\nevents, sire,\" she said, \"explain what you require.\"\n\n\"I ask, madame, what has Mademoiselle de la Valliere done to warrant\nyour conduct toward her?\"\n\n\"She is the most cunning fomenter of intrigues I know; she was the\noccasion of two personal friends engaging in mortal combat; and has\nmade people talk of her in such shameless terms that the whole court is\nindignant at the mere sound of her name.\"\n\n\"She! she!\" cried the king.\n\n\"Under her soft and hypocritical manner,\" continued Madame, \"she hides a\ndisposition full of foul and dark conceit.\"\n\n\"She!\"\n\n\"You may possibly be deceived, sire, but I know her right well; she\nis capable of creating dispute and misunderstanding between the most\naffectionate relatives and the most intimate friends. You see that she\nhas already sown discord betwixt us two.\"\n\n\"I do assure you--\" said the king.\n\n\"Sire, look well into the case as it stands; we were living on the\nmost friendly understanding, and by the artfulness of her tales and\ncomplaints, she has set your majesty against me.\"\n\n\"I swear to you,\" said the king, \"that on no occasion has a bitter\nword ever passed her lips; I swear that, even in my wildest bursts of\npassion, she would not allow me to menace any one; and I swear, too,\nthat you do not possess a more devoted and respectful friend than she\nis.\"\n\n\"Friend!\" said Madame, with an expression of supreme disdain.\n\n\"Take care, Madame!\" said the king; \"you forget that you now understand\nme, and that from this moment everything is equalized. Mademoiselle de\nla Valliere will be whatever I may choose her to become; and to-morrow,\nif I were determined to do so, I could seat her on a throne.\"\n\n\"She was not born to a throne, at least, and whatever you may do can\naffect the future alone, but cannot affect the past.\"\n\n\"Madame, towards you I have shown every kind consideration, and every\neager desire to please you; do not remind me that I am master.\"\n\n\"It is the second time, sire, that you have made that remark, and I have\nalready informed you I am ready to submit.\"\n\n\"In that case, then, you will confer upon me the favor of receiving\nMademoiselle de la Valliere back again.\"\n\n\"For what purpose, sire, since you have a throne to bestow upon her? I\nam too insignificant to protect so exalted a personage.\"\n\n\"Nay, a truce to this bitter and disdainful spirit. Grant me her\nforgiveness.\"\n\n\"_Never!_\"\n\n\"You drive me, then, to open warfare in my own family.\"\n\n\"I, too, have a family with whom I can find refuge.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that as a threat, and could you forget yourself so far? Do\nyou believe that, if you push the affront to that extent, your family\nwould encourage you?\"\n\n\"I hope, sire, that you will not force me to take any step which would\nbe unworthy of my rank.\"\n\n\"I hoped that you would remember our recent friendship, and that you\nwould treat me as a brother.\"\n\nMadame paused for a moment. \"I do not disown you for a brother,\" she\nsaid, \"in refusing your majesty an injustice.\"\n\n\"An injustice!\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! if I informed others of La Valliere's conduct; if the queen\nknew--\"\n\n\"Come, come, Henrietta, let your heart speak; remember that, for however\nbrief a time, you once loved me; remember, too, that human hearts should\nbe as merciful as the heart of a sovereign Master. Do not be inflexible\nwith others; forgive La Valliere.\"\n\n\"I cannot; she has offended me.\"\n\n\"But for my sake.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is for your sake I would do anything in the world, except\nthat.\"\n\n\"You will drive me to despair--you compel me to turn to the last\nresource of weak people, and seek counsel of my angry and wrathful\ndisposition.\"\n\n\"I advise you to be reasonable.\"\n\n\"Reasonable!--I can be so no longer.\"\n\n\"Nay, sire! I pray you--\"\n\n\"For pity's sake, Henrietta; it is the first time I entreated any one,\nand I have no hope in any one but in you.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! you are weeping.\"\n\n\"From rage, from humiliation. That I, the king, should have been obliged\nto descend to entreaty. I shall hate this moment during my whole life.\nYou have made me suffer in one moment more distress and more degradation\nthan I could have anticipated in the greatest extremity in life.\" And\nthe king rose and gave free vent to his tears, which, in fact, were\ntears of anger and shame.\n\nMadame was not touched exactly--for the best women, when their pride is\nhurt, are without pity; but she was afraid that the tears the king was\nshedding might possibly carry away every soft and tender feeling in his\nheart.\n\n\"Give what commands you please, sire,\" she said; \"and since you prefer\nmy humiliation to your own--although mine is public and yours has been\nwitnessed but by myself alone--speak, I will obey your majesty.\"\n\n\"No, no, Henrietta!\" exclaimed Louis, transported with gratitude, \"you\nwill have yielded to a brother's wishes.\"\n\n\"I no longer have any brother, since I obey.\"\n\n\"All that I have would be too little in return.\"\n\n\"How passionately you love, sire, when you do love!\"\n\nLouis did not answer. He had seized upon Madame's hand and covered it\nwith kisses. \"And so you will receive this poor girl back again, and\nwill forgive her; you will find how gentle and pure-hearted she is.\"\n\n\"I will maintain her in my household.\"\n\n\"No, you will give her your friendship, my sister.\"\n\n\"I never liked her.\"\n\n\"Well, for my sake, you will treat her kindly, will you not, Henrietta?\"\n\n\"I will treat her as your--_mistress_.\"\n\nThe king rose suddenly to his feet. By this word, which had so\ninfelicitously escaped her, Madame had destroyed the whole merit of her\nsacrifice. The king felt freed from all obligations. Exasperated beyond\nmeasure, and bitterly offended, he replied:\n\n\"I thank you, Madame; I shall never forget the service you have rendered\nme.\" And, saluting her with an affectation of ceremony, he took his\nleave of her. As he passed before a glass, he saw that his eyes were\nred, and angrily stamped his foot on the ground. But it was too late,\nfor Malicorne and D'Artagnan, who were standing at the door, had seen\nhis eyes.\n\n\"The king has been crying,\" thought Malicorne. D'Artagnan approached the\nking with a respectful air, and said in a low tone of voice:\n\n\"Sire, it would be better to return to your own apartments by the small\nstaircase.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the dust of the road has left its traces on your face,\" said\nD'Artagnan. \"By heavens!\" he thought, \"when the king has given way like\na child, let those look to it who may make the lady weep for whom the\nking sheds tears.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI. Mademoiselle de la Valliere's Pocket-Handkerchief.\n\nMadame was not bad-hearted--she was only hasty and impetuous. The king\nwas not imprudent--he was simply in love. Hardly had they entered into\nthis compact, which terminated in La Valliere's recall, when they both\nsought to make as much as they could by their bargain. The king wished\nto see La Valliere every moment of the day, while Madame, who was\nsensible of the king's annoyance ever since he had so entreated her,\nwould not relinquish her revenge on La Valliere without a contest. She\nplanted every conceivable difficulty in the king's path; he was,\nin fact, obliged, in order to get a glimpse of La Valliere, to be\nexceedingly devoted in his attentions to his sister-in-law, and this,\nindeed, was Madame's plan of policy. As she had chosen some one to\nsecond her efforts, and as this person was our old friend Montalais,\nthe king found himself completely hemmed in every time he paid Madame\na visit; he was surrounded, and was never left a moment alone. Madame\ndisplayed in her conversation a charm of manner and brilliancy of wit\nwhich dazzled everybody. Montalais followed her, and soon rendered\nherself perfectly insupportable to the king, which was, in fact, the\nvery thing she expected would happen. She then set Malicorne at the\nking, who found means of informing his majesty that there was a young\nperson belonging to the court who was exceedingly miserable; and on\nthe king inquiring who this person was, Malicorne replied that it\nwas Mademoiselle de Montalais. To this the king answered that it was\nperfectly just that a person should be unhappy when she rendered others\nso. Whereupon Malicorne explained how matters stood; for he had received\nhis directions from Montalais. The king began to open his eyes; he\nremarked that, as soon as he made his appearance, Madame made hers too;\nthat she remained in the corridors until after he had left; that she\naccompanied him back to his own apartments, fearing that he might speak\nin the ante-chambers to one of her maids of honor. One evening she went\nfurther still. The king was seated, surrounded by the ladies who were\npresent, and holding in his hand, concealed by his lace ruffle, a small\nnote which he wished to slip into La Valliere's hand. Madame guessed\nboth his intention and the letter too. It was difficult to prevent the\nking going wherever he pleased, and yet it was necessary to prevent his\ngoing near La Valliere, or speaking to her, as by so doing he could\nlet the note fall into her lap behind her fan, or into her\npocket-handkerchief. The king, who was also on the watch, suspected that\na snare was being laid for him. He rose and pushed his chair, without\naffectation, near Mademoiselle de Chatillon, with whom he began to\ntalk in a light tone. They were amusing themselves making rhymes; from\nMademoiselle de Chatillon he went to Montalais, and then to Mademoiselle\nde Tonnay-Charente. And thus, by this skillful maneuver, he found\nhimself seated opposite to La Valliere, whom he completely concealed.\nMadame pretended to be greatly occupied, altering a group of flowers\nthat she was working in tapestry. The king showed the corner of his\nletter to La Valliere, and the latter held out her handkerchief with\na look that signified, \"Put the letter inside.\" Then, as the king had\nplaced his own handkerchief upon his chair, he was adroit enough to let\nit fall on the ground, so that La Valliere slipped her handkerchief on\nthe chair. The king took it up quietly, without any one observing what\nhe did, placed the letter within it, and returned the handkerchief to\nthe place he had taken it from. There was only just time for La Valliere\nto stretch out her hand to take hold of the handkerchief with its\nvaluable contents.\n\nBut Madame, who had observed everything that had passed, said to\nMademoiselle de Chatillon, \"Chatillon, be good enough to pick up the\nking's handkerchief, if you please; it has fallen on the carpet.\"\n\nThe young girl obeyed with the utmost precipitation, the king having\nmoved from his seat, and La Valliere being in no little degree nervous\nand confused.\n\n\"Ah! I beg your majesty's pardon,\" said Mademoiselle de Chatillon; \"you\nhave two handkerchiefs, I perceive.\"\n\nAnd the king was accordingly obliged to put into his pocket La\nValliere's handkerchief as well as his own. He certainly gained that\nsouvenir of Louise, who lost, however, a copy of verses which had cost\nthe king ten hours' hard labor, and which, as far as he was concerned,\nwas perhaps as good as a long poem. It would be impossible to describe\nthe king's anger and La Valliere's despair; but shortly afterwards a\ncircumstance occurred which was more than remarkable. When the king\nleft, in order to retire to his own apartments, Malicorne, informed\nof what had passed, one can hardly tell how, was waiting in the\nante-chamber. The ante-chambers of the Palais Royal are naturally very\ndark, and, in the evening, they were but indifferently lighted. Nothing\npleased the king more than this dim light. As a general rule, love,\nwhose mind and heart are constantly in a blaze, contemns all light,\nexcept the sunshine of the soul. And so the ante-chamber was dark; a\npage carried a torch before the king, who walked on slowly, greatly\nannoyed at what had recently occurred. Malicorne passed close to the\nking, almost stumbled against him in fact, and begged his forgiveness\nwith the profoundest humility; but the king, who was in an exceedingly\nill-temper, was very sharp in his reproof to Malicorne, who disappeared\nas soon and as quietly as he possibly could. Louis retired to rest,\nhaving had a misunderstanding with the queen; and the next day, as soon\nas he entered the cabinet, he wished to have La Valliere's handkerchief\nin order to press his lips to it. He called his valet.\n\n\"Fetch me,\" he said, \"the coat I wore yesterday evening, but be very\nsure you do not touch anything it may contain.\"\n\nThe order being obeyed, the king himself searched the pocket of the\ncoat; he found only one handkerchief, and that his own; La Valliere's\nhad disappeared. Whilst busied with all kinds of conjectures and\nsuspicions, a letter was brought to him from La Valliere; it ran thus:\n\n\"How good and kind of you to have sent me those beautiful verses; how\nfull of ingenuity and perseverance your affection is; how is it possible\nto help loving you so dearly!\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" thought the king; \"there must be some mistake.\nLook well about,\" said he to the valet, \"for a pocket-handkerchief\nmust be in one of my pockets; and if you do not find it, or if you have\ntouched it--\" He reflected for a moment. To make a state matter of the\nloss of the handkerchief would be to act absurdly, and he therefore\nadded, \"There was a letter of some importance inside the handkerchief,\nwhich had somehow got among the folds of it.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the valet, \"your majesty had only one handkerchief, and\nthat is it.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" replied the king, setting his teeth hard together. \"Oh,\npoverty, how I envy you! Happy is the man who can empty his own pockets\nof letters and handkerchiefs!\"\n\nHe read La Valliere's letter over again, endeavoring to imagine in what\nconceivable way his verses could have reached their destination. There\nwas a postscript to the letter:\n\n\"I send you back by your messenger this reply, so unworthy of what you\nsent me.\"\n\n\"So far so good; I shall find out something now,\" he said delightedly.\n\"Who is waiting, and who brought me this letter?\"\n\n\"M. Malicorne,\" replied the _valet de chambre_, timidly.\n\n\"Desire him to come in.\"\n\nMalicorne entered.\n\n\"You come from Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\" said the king, with a sigh.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And you took Mademoiselle de la Valliere something from me?\"\n\n\"I, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sire.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere says so, distinctly.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, Mademoiselle de la Valliere is mistaken.\"\n\nThe king frowned. \"What jest is this?\" he said; \"explain yourself. Why\ndoes Mademoiselle de la Valliere call you my messenger? What did you\ntake to that lady? Speak, monsieur, and quickly.\"\n\n\"Sire, I merely took Mademoiselle de la Valliere a pocket-handkerchief,\nthat was all.\"\n\n\"A handkerchief,--what handkerchief?\"\n\n\"Sire, at the very moment when I had the misfortune to stumble against\nyour majesty yesterday--a misfortune which I shall deplore to the\nlast day of my life, especially after the dissatisfaction which you\nexhibited--I remained, sire, motionless with despair, your majesty being\nat too great a distance to hear my excuses, when I saw something white\nlying on the ground.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king.\n\n\"I stooped down,--it was a pocket-handkerchief. For a moment I had an\nidea that when I stumbled against your majesty I must have been the\ncause of the handkerchief falling from your pocket; but as I felt it all\nover very respectfully, I perceived a cipher at one of the corners,\nand, on looking at it closely, I found that it was Mademoiselle de la\nValliere's cipher. I presumed that on her way to Madame's apartment in\nthe earlier part of the evening she had let her handkerchief fall, and\nI accordingly hastened to restore it to her as she was leaving; and that\nis all I gave to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, I entreat your majesty to\nbelieve.\" Malicorne's manner was so simple, so full of contrition, and\nmarked with such extreme humility, that the king was greatly amused in\nlistening to him. He was as pleased with him for what he had done as if\nhe had rendered him the greatest service.\n\n\"This is the second fortunate meeting I have had with you, monsieur,\" he\nsaid; \"you may count upon my good intentions.\"\n\nThe plain and sober truth was, that Malicorne had picked the king's\npocket of the handkerchief as dexterously as any of the pickpockets of\nthe good city of Paris could have done. Madame never knew of this little\nincident, but Montalais gave La Valliere some idea of the manner in\nwhich it had really happened, and La Valliere afterwards told the king,\nwho laughed exceedingly at it and pronounced Malicorne to be a first\nrate politician. Louis XIV. was right, and it is well known that he was\ntolerably well acquainted with human nature.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII. Which Treats of Gardeners, of Ladders, and Maids of\nHonor.\n\nMiracles, unfortunately, could not be always happening, whilst Madame's\nill-humor still continued. In a week's time, matters had reached such a\npoint, that the king could no longer look at La Valliere without a look\nfull of suspicion crossing his own. Whenever a promenade was proposed,\nMadame, in order to avoid the recurrence of similar scenes to that of\nthe thunder-storm, or the royal oak, had a variety of indispositions\nready prepared; and, thanks to them, she was unable to go out, and her\nmaids of honor were obliged to remain indoors also. There was not the\nslightest chance of means of paying a nocturnal visit; for in this\nrespect the king had, on the very first occasion, experienced a severe\ncheck, which happened in the following manner. As at Fontainebleau, he\nhad taken Saint-Aignan with him one evening when he wished to pay\nLa Valliere a visit; but he had found no one but Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente, who had begun to call out \"Fire!\" and \"Thieves!\" in\nsuch a manner that a perfect legion of chamber-maids, attendants, and\npages, ran to her assistance; so that Saint-Aignan, who had remained\nbehind in order to save the honor of his royal master, who had fled\nprecipitately, was obliged to submit to a severe scolding from the\nqueen-mother, as well as from Madame herself. In addition, he had, the\nnext morning, received two challenges from the De Mortemart family, and\nthe king had been obliged to interfere. This mistake had been owing\nto the circumstance of Madame having suddenly ordered a change in the\napartments of her maids of honor, and directed La Valliere and Montalais\nto sleep in her own cabinet. No gateway, therefore, was any longer\nopen--not even communication by letter; to write under the eyes of\nso ferocious an Argus as Madame, whose temper and disposition were so\nuncertain, was to run the risk of exposure to the greatest danger; and\nit can well be conceived into what a state of continuous irritation, and\never increasing anger, all these petty annoyances threw the young lion.\nThe king almost tormented himself to death endeavoring to discover a\nmeans of communication; and, as he did not think proper to call in the\naid of Malicorne or D'Artagnan, the means were not discovered at all.\nMalicorne had, indeed, occasional brilliant flashes of imagination, with\nwhich he tried to inspire the king with confidence; but, whether from\nshame or suspicion, the king, who had at first begun to nibble at the\nbait, soon abandoned the hook. In this way, for instance, one evening,\nwhile the king was crossing the garden, and looking up at Madame's\nwindows, Malicorne stumbled over a ladder lying beside a border of box,\nand said to Manicamp, then walking with him behind the king, \"Did you\nnot see that I just now stumbled against a ladder, and was nearly thrown\ndown?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Manicamp, as usual very absent-minded, \"but it appears you\ndid not fall.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter; but it is not on that account the less dangerous\nto leave ladders lying about in that manner.\"\n\n\"True, one might hurt one's self, especially when troubled with fits of\nabsence of mind.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that; what I did mean, was that it is dangerous to allow\nladders to lie about so near the windows of the maids of honor.\" Louis\nstarted imperceptibly.\n\n\"Why so?\" inquired Manicamp.\n\n\"Speak louder,\" whispered Malicorne, as he touched him with his arm.\n\n\"Why so?\" said Manicamp, louder. The king listened.\n\n\"Because, for instance,\" said Malicorne, \"a ladder nineteen feet high is\njust the height of the cornice of those windows.\" Manicamp, instead of\nanswering, was dreaming of something else.\n\n\"Ask me, can't you, what windows I mean,\" whispered Malicorne.\n\n\"But what windows are you referring to?\" said Manicamp, aloud.\n\n\"The windows of Madame's apartments.\"\n\n\"Eh!\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't say that any one would ever venture to go up a ladder into\nMadame's room; but in Madame's cabinet, merely separated by a partition,\nsleep two exceedingly pretty girls, Mesdemoiselles de la Valliere and de\nMontalais.\"\n\n\"By a partition?\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"Look; you see how brilliantly lighted Madame's apartments are--well, do\nyou see those two windows?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that window close to the others, but more dimly lighted?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the room of the maids of honor. Look, there is\nMademoiselle de la Valliere opening the window. Ah! how many soft things\ncould an enterprising lover say to her, if he only suspected that there\nwas lying here a ladder nineteen feet long, which would just reach the\ncornice.\"\n\n\"But she is not alone; you said Mademoiselle de Montalais is with her.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Montalais counts for nothing; she is her oldest friend,\nand exceedingly devoted to her--a positive well, into which can be\nthrown all sorts of secrets one might wish to get rid of.\"\n\nThe king did not lose a single syllable of this conversation. Malicorne\neven remarked that his majesty slackened his pace, in order to give him\ntime to finish. So, when they arrived at the door, Louis dismissed every\none, with the exception of Malicorne--a circumstance which excited no\nsurprise, for it was known that the king was in love; and they suspected\nhe was going to compose some verses by moonlight; and, although there\nwas no moon that evening, the king might, nevertheless, have some verses\nto compose. Every one, therefore, took his leave; and, immediately\nafterwards, the king turned towards Malicorne, who respectfully waited\nuntil his majesty should address him. \"What were you saying, just now,\nabout a ladder, Monsieur Malicorne?\" he asked.\n\n\"Did I say anything about ladders, sire?\" said Malicorne, looking up, as\nif in search of words which had flown away.\n\n\"Yes, of a ladder nineteen feet long.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sire, I remember; but I spoke to M. Manicamp, and I should not\nhave said a word had I known your majesty was near enough to hear us.\"\n\n\"And why would you not have said a word?\"\n\n\"Because I should not have liked to get the gardener into a scrape who\nleft it there--poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Don't make yourself uneasy on that account. What is this ladder like?\"\n\n\"If your majesty wishes to see it, nothing is easier, for there it is.\"\n\n\"In that box hedge?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Show it to me.\"\n\nMalicorne turned back, and led the king up to the ladder, saying, \"This\nis it, sire.\"\n\n\"Pull it this way a little.\"\n\nWhen Malicorne had brought the ladder on to the gravel walk, the king\nbegan to step its whole length. \"Hum!\" he said; \"you say it is nineteen\nfeet long?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Nineteen feet--that is rather long; I hardly believe it can be so long\nas that.\"\n\n\"You cannot judge very correctly with the ladder in that position, sire.\nIf it were upright, against a tree or a wall, for instance, you would\nbe better able to judge, because the comparison would assist you a good\ndeal.\"\n\n\"Oh! it does not matter, M. Malicorne; but I can hardly believe that the\nladder is nineteen feet high.\"\n\n\"I know how accurate your majesty's glance is, and yet I would wager.\"\n\nThe king shook his head. \"There is one unanswerable means of verifying\nit,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Every one knows, sire, that the ground-floor of the palace is eighteen\nfeet high.\"\n\n\"True, that is very well known.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, if I place the ladder against the wall, we shall be able to\nascertain.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\nMalicorne took up the ladder, like a feather, and placed it upright\nagainst the wall. And, in order to try the experiment, he chose, or\nchance, perhaps, directed him to choose, the very window of the cabinet\nwhere La Valliere was. The ladder just reached the edge of the cornice,\nthat is to say, the sill of the window; so that, by standing upon the\nlast round but one of the ladder, a man of about the middle height, as\nthe king was, for instance, could easily talk with those who might be\nin the room. Hardly had the ladder been properly placed, when the king,\ndropping the assumed part he had been playing in the comedy, began to\nascend the rounds of the ladder, which Malicorne held at the bottom. But\nhardly had he completed half the distance when a patrol of Swiss guards\nappeared in the garden, and advanced straight towards them. The king\ndescended with the utmost precipitation, and concealed himself among\nthe trees. Malicorne at once perceived that he must offer himself as\na sacrifice; for if he, too, were to conceal himself, the guard would\nsearch everywhere until they had found either himself or the king,\nperhaps both. It would be far better, therefore, that he alone should be\ndiscovered. And, consequently, Malicorne hid himself so clumsily that\nhe was the only one arrested. As soon as he was arrested, Malicorne\nwas taken to the guard-house, and there he declared who he was, and was\nimmediately recognized. In the meantime, by concealing himself first\nbehind one clump of trees and then behind another, the king reached\nthe side door of his apartment, very much humiliated, and still more\ndisappointed. More than that, the noise made in arresting Malicorne had\ndrawn La Valliere and Montalais to their window; and even Madame herself\nhad appeared at her own, with a pair of wax candles, one in each hand,\nclamorously asking what was the matter.\n\nIn the meantime, Malicorne sent for D'Artagnan, who did not lose a\nmoment in hurrying to him. But it was in vain he attempted to make him\nunderstand his reasons, and in vain also that D'Artagnan did understand\nthem; and, further, it was equally in vain that both their sharp and\nintuitive minds endeavored to give another turn to the adventure; there\nwas no other resource left for Malicorne but to let it be supposed\nthat he had wished to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment,\nas Saint-Aignan had passed for having wished to force Mademoiselle\nde Tonnay-Charente's door. Madame was inflexible; in the first place,\nbecause, if Malicorne had, in fact, wished to enter her apartment at\nnight through the window, and by means of the ladder, in order to see\nMontalais, it was a punishable offense on Malicorne's part, and he must\nbe punished accordingly; and, in the second place, if Malicorne, instead\nof acting in his own name, had acted as an intermediary between La\nValliere and a person whose name it was superfluous to mention, his\ncrime was in that case even greater, since love, which is an excuse for\neverything, did not exist in the case as an excuse. Madame therefore\nmade the greatest possible disturbance about the matter, and obtained\nhis dismissal from Monsieur's household, without reflecting, poor blind\ncreature, that both Malicorne and Montalais held her fast in their\nclutches in consequence of her visit to De Guiche, and in a variety\nof other ways equally delicate. Montalais, who was perfectly furious,\nwished to revenge herself immediately, but Malicorne pointed out to her\nthat the king's countenance would repay them for all the disgraces\nin the world, and that it was a great thing to have to suffer on his\nmajesty's account.\n\nMalicorne was perfectly right, and, therefore, although Montalais had\nthe spirit of ten women in her, he succeeded in bringing her round to\nhis own opinion. And we must not omit to state that the king helped them\nto console themselves, for, in the first place, he presented Malicorne\nwith fifty thousand francs as a compensation for the post he had lost,\nand, in the next place, he gave him an appointment in his own household,\ndelighted to have an opportunity of revenging himself in such a manner\nupon Madame for all she had made him and La Valliere suffer. But as\nMalicorne could no longer carry significant handkerchiefs for him or\nplant convenient ladders, the royal lover was in a terrible state. There\nseemed to be no hope, therefore, of ever getting near La Valliere again,\nso long as she should remain at the Palais Royal. All the dignities and\nall the money in the world could not remedy that. Fortunately, however,\nMalicorne was on the lookout, and this so successfully that he met\nMontalais, who, to do her justice, it must be admitted, was doing her\nbest to meet Malicorne. \"What do you do during the night in Madame's\napartment?\" he asked the young girl.\n\n\"Why, I go to sleep, of course,\" she replied.\n\n\"But it is very wrong to sleep; it can hardly be possible that, with the\npain you are suffering, you can manage to do so.\"\n\n\"And what am I suffering from, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Are you not in despair at my absence?\"\n\n\"Of course not, since you have received fifty thousand francs and an\nappointment in the king's household.\"\n\n\"That is a matter of no moment; you are exceedingly afflicted at not\nseeing me as you used to see me formerly, and more than all, you are\nin despair at my having lost Madame's confidence; come now, is not that\ntrue?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true.\"\n\n\"Very good; your distress of mind prevents you sleeping at night, and so\nyou sob, and sigh, and blow your nose ten times every minute as loud as\npossible.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Malicorne, Madame cannot endure the slightest noise near\nher.\"\n\n\"I know that perfectly well; of course she can't endure anything; and\nso, I tell you, when she hears your deep distress, she will turn you out\nof her rooms without a moment's delay.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"Very fortunate you _do_.\"\n\n\"Well, and what will happen next?\"\n\n\"The next thing that will happen will be, that La Valliere, finding\nherself alone without you, will groan and utter such loud lamentations,\nthat she will exhibit despair enough for two.\"\n\n\"In that case she will be put into _another_ room, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Precisely so.\"\n\n\"Yes, but which?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will puzzle you to say, Mr. Inventor-General.\"\n\n\"Not at all; whenever and whatever the room may be, it will always be\npreferable to Madame's own room.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Very good, so begin your lamentations to-night.\"\n\n\"I certainly will not fail to do so.\"\n\n\"And give La Valliere a hint also.\"\n\n\"Oh! don't fear her, she cries quite enough already to herself.\"\n\n\"Very well! all she has to do is cry out loudly.\"\n\nAnd they separated.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII. Which Treats of Carpentry Operations, and Furnishes\nDetails upon the Mode of Constructing Staircases.\n\nThe advice which had been given to Montalais was communicated by her\nto La Valliere, who could not but acknowledge that it was by no means\ndeficient in judgment, and who, after a certain amount of resistance,\nrising rather from timidity than indifference to the project, resolved\nto put it into execution. This story of the two girls weeping, and\nfilling Madame's bedroom with the noisiest lamentations, was Malicorne's\n_chef-d'oeuvre_. As nothing is so probable as improbability, so natural\nas romance, this kind of Arabian Nights story succeeded perfectly with\nMadame. The first thing she did was to send Montalais away, and then,\nthree days, or rather three nights afterwards, she had La Valliere\nremoved. She gave the latter one of the small rooms on the top story,\nsituated immediately over the apartments allotted to the gentlemen\nof Monsieur's suite. One story only, that is to say, a mere flooring\nseparated the maids of honor from the officers and gentlemen of her\nhusband's household. A private staircase, which was placed under Madame\nde Navailles's surveillance, was the only means of communication. For\ngreater safety, Madame de Navailles, who had heard of his majesty's\nprevious attempts, had the windows of the rooms and the openings of the\nchimneys carefully barred. There was, therefore, every possible security\nprovided for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whose room now bore more\nresemblance to a cage than to anything else. When Mademoiselle de la\nValliere was in her own room, and she was there very frequently, for\nMadame scarcely ever had any occasion for her services, since she once\nknew she was safe under Madame de Navailles's inspection, Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere had no better means of amusing herself than looking\nthrough the bars of her windows. It happened, therefore, that one\nmorning, as she was looking out as usual, she perceived Malicorne at one\nof the windows exactly opposite to her own. He held a carpenter's rule\nin his hand, was surveying the buildings, and seemed to be adding up\nsome figures on paper. La Valliere recognized Malicorne and nodded to\nhim; Malicorne, in his turn, replied by a formal bow, and disappeared\nfrom the window. She was surprised at this marked coolness, so different\nfrom his usual unfailing good-humor, but she remembered that he had lost\nhis appointment on her account, and that he could hardly be very amiably\ndisposed towards her, since, in all probability, she would never be in\na position to make him any recompense for what he had lost. She knew how\nto forgive offenses, and with still more readiness could she sympathize\nwith misfortune. La Valliere would have asked Montalais her opinion, if\nshe had been within hearing, but she was absent, it being the hour\nshe commonly devoted to her own correspondence. Suddenly La Valliere\nobserved something thrown from the window where Malicorne had been\nstanding, pass across the open space which separated the iron bars, and\nroll upon the floor. She advanced with no little curiosity towards this\nobject, and picked it up; it was a wooden reel for silk, only, in this\ninstance, instead of silk, a piece of paper was rolled round it. La\nValliere unrolled it and read as follows:\n\n\"MADEMOISELLE,--I am exceedingly anxious to learn two things: the first\nis, to know if the flooring of your apartment is wood or brick; the\nsecond, to ascertain at what distance your bed is placed from the\nwindow. Forgive my importunity, and will you be good enough to send me\nan answer by the same way you receive this letter--that is to say, by\nmeans of the silk winder; only, instead of throwing into my room, as\nI have thrown it into yours, which will be too difficult for you\nto attempt, have the goodness merely to let it fall. Believe me,\nmademoiselle, your most humble, most respectful servant,\n\n\"MALICORNE.\n\n\"Write the reply, if you please, upon the letter itself.\"\n\n\n\"Ah! poor fellow,\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"he must have gone out of his\nmind;\" and she directed towards her correspondent--of whom she caught\nbut a faint glimpse, in consequence of the darkness of the room--a look\nfull of compassionate consideration. Malicorne understood her, and shook\nhis head, as if he meant to say, \"No, no, I am not out of my mind; be\nquite satisfied.\"\n\nShe smiled, as if still in doubt.\n\n\"No, no,\" he signified by a gesture, \"my head is right,\" and pointed\nto his head, then, after moving his hand like a man who writes very\nrapidly, he put his hands together as if entreating her to write.\n\nLa Valliere, even if he were mad, saw no impropriety in doing what\nMalicorne requested her; she took a pencil and wrote \"Wood,\" and then\nwalked slowly from her window to her bed, and wrote, \"Six paces,\" and\nhaving done this, she looked out again at Malicorne, who bowed to her,\nsignifying that he was about to descend. La Valliere understood that\nit was to pick up the silk winder. She approached the window, and, in\naccordance with Malicorne's instructions, let it fall. The winder was\nstill rolling along the flag-stones as Malicorne started after it,\novertook and picked it up, and beginning to peel it as a monkey would\ndo with a nut, he ran straight towards M. de Saint-Aignan's apartment.\nSaint-Aignan had chosen, or rather solicited, that his rooms might be\nas near the king as possible, as certain plants seek the sun's rays in\norder to develop themselves more luxuriantly. His apartment consisted of\ntwo rooms, in that portion of the palace occupied by Louis XIV. himself.\nM. de Saint-Aignan was very proud of this proximity, which afforded\neasy access to his majesty, and, more than that, the favor of occasional\nunexpected meetings. At the moment we are now referring to, he\nwas engaged in having both his rooms magnificently carpeted, with\nexpectation of receiving the honor of frequent visits from the king; for\nhis majesty, since his passion for La Valliere, had chosen Saint-Aignan\nas his confidant, and could not, in fact, do without him, either night\nor day. Malicorne introduced himself to the comte, and met with no\ndifficulties, because he had been favorably noticed by the king; and\nalso, because the credit which one man may happen to enjoy is always a\nbait for others. Saint-Aignan asked his visitor if he brought any news\nwith him.\n\n\"Yes; great news,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Saint-Aignan, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere has changed her quarters.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Saint-Aignan, opening his eyes very wide. \"She\nwas living in the same apartments as Madame.\"\n\n\"Precisely so; but Madame got tired of her proximity, and has installed\nher in a room which is situated exactly above your future apartment.\"\n\n\"What! up there,\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan, with surprise, and pointing at\nthe floor above him with his finger.\n\n\"No,\" said Malicorne, \"yonder,\" indicating the building opposite.\n\n\"What do you mean, then, by saying that her room is above my apartment?\"\n\n\"Because I am sure that your apartment _ought_, providentially, to be\nunder Mademoiselle de la Valliere's room.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan, at this remark, gave poor Malicorne a look, similar to one\nof those La Valliere had already given a quarter of an hour before, that\nis to say, he thought he had lost his senses.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Malicorne to him, \"I wish to answer what you are\nthinking about.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'what I am thinking about'?\"\n\n\"My reason is, that you have not clearly understood what I want to\nconvey.\"\n\n\"I admit it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you are aware that underneath the apartments set for\nMadame's maids of honor, the gentlemen in attendance on the king and on\nMonsieur are lodged.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that, since Manicamp, De Wardes, and others are living\nthere.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Well, monsieur, admire the singularity of the circumstance;\nthe two rooms destined for M. de Guiche are exactly the very two\nrooms situated underneath those which Mademoiselle de Montalais and\nMademoiselle de la Valliere occupy.\"\n\n\"Well; what then?\"\n\n\"'What then,' do you say? Why, these two rooms are empty, since M. de\nGuiche is now lying wounded at Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"I assure you, my dear fellow, I cannot grasp your meaning.\"\n\n\"Well! if I had the happiness to call myself Saint-Aignan, I should\nguess immediately.\"\n\n\"And what would you do then?\"\n\n\"I should at once change the rooms I am occupying here, for those which\nM. de Guiche is not using yonder.\"\n\n\"Can you suppose such a thing?\" said Saint-Aignan, disdainfully. \"What!\nabandon the chief post of honor, the proximity to the king, a privilege\nconceded only to princes of the blood, to dukes, and peers! Permit me\nto tell you, my dear Monsieur de Malicorne, that you must be out of your\nsenses.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the young man, seriously, \"you commit two mistakes.\nMy name is Malicorne, simply; and I am in perfect possession of all my\nsenses.\" Then, drawing a paper from his pocket, he said, \"Listen to what\nI am going to say; and afterwards, I will show you this paper.\"\n\n\"I am listening,\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"You know that Madame looks after La Valliere as carefully as Argus did\nafter the nymph Io.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"You know that the king has sought for an opportunity, but uselessly,\nof speaking to the prisoner, and that neither you nor myself have yet\nsucceeded in procuring him this piece of good fortune.\"\n\n\"You certainly ought to know something about the subject, my poor\nMalicorne,\" said Saint-Aignan, smiling.\n\n\"Very good; what do you suppose would happen to the man whose\nimagination devised some means of bringing the lovers together?\"\n\n\"Oh! the king would set no bounds to his gratitude.\"\n\n\"Let me ask you, then, M. de Saint-Aignan, whether you would not be\ncurious to taste a little of this royal gratitude?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"any favor of my master, as a\nrecognition of the proper discharge of my duty, would assuredly be most\nprecious.\"\n\n\"In that case, look at this paper, monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"What is it--a plan?\"\n\n\"Yes; a plan of M. de Guiche's two rooms, which, in all probability,\nwill soon be your two rooms.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, whatever may happen.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because my rooms are the envy of too many gentlemen, to whom I\ncertainly shall not give them up; M. de Roquelaure, for instance, M. de\nla Ferte, and M. de Dangeau, would all be anxious to get them.\"\n\n\"In that case I shall leave you, monsieur le comte, and I shall go and\noffer to one of those gentlemen the plan I have just shown you, together\nwith the advantages annexed to it.\"\n\n\"But why do you not keep them for yourself?\" inquired Saint-Aignan,\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"Because the king would never do me the honor of paying me a visit\nopenly, whilst he would readily go and see any one of those gentlemen.\"\n\n\"What! the king would go and see any one of those gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Go! most certainly he would ten times instead of once. Is it possible\nyou can ask me if the king would go to an apartment which would bring\nhim nearer to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, delightfully near her, with a floor between them.\"\n\nMalicorne unfolded the piece of paper which had been wrapped round the\nbobbin. \"Monsieur le comte,\" he said, \"have the goodness to observe that\nthe flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere's room is merely a wooden\nflooring.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! all you would have to do would be to get hold of a journeyman\ncarpenter, lock him up in your apartments, without letting him know\nwhere you have taken him to, and let him make a hole in your ceiling,\nand consequently in the flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere's room.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan, as if dazzled.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Nothing, except that you have hit upon a singular, bold idea,\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"It will seem a very trifling one to the king, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Lovers never think of the risk they run.\"\n\n\"What danger do you apprehend, monsieur le comte?\"\n\n\"Why, effecting such an opening as that will make a terrible noise: it\ncould be heard all over the palace.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur le comte, I am quite sure that the carpenter I shall\nselect will not make the slightest noise in the world. He will saw an\nopening three feet square, with a saw covered with tow, and no one, not\neven those adjoining, will know that he is at work.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Malicorne, you astound, you positively bewilder me.\"\n\n\"To continue,\" replied Malicorne, quietly, \"in the room, the ceiling of\nwhich you will have cut through, you will put up a staircase, which will\neither allow Mademoiselle de la Valliere to descend into your room, or\nthe king to ascend into Mademoiselle de la Valliere's room.\"\n\n\"But the staircase will be seen.\"\n\n\"No; for in your room it will be hidden by a partition, over which\nyou will throw a tapestry similar to that which covers the rest of the\napartment; and in Mademoiselle de la Valliere's room it will not be\nseen, for the trapdoor, which will be a part of the flooring itself,\nwill be made to open under the bed.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Saint-Aignan, whose eyes began to sparkle with\ndelight.\n\n\"And now, monsieur le comte, there is no occasion to make you admit\nthat the king will frequently come to the room where such a staircase is\nconstructed. I think that M. Dangeau, particularly, will be struck by my\nidea, and I shall now go and explain to him.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, you forget that you spoke to me about\nit the first, and that I have consequently the right of priority.\"\n\n\"Do you wish for the preference?\"\n\n\"Do I wish it? Of course I do.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, I am presenting you with a\nJacob's ladder, which is better than the promise of an additional step\nin the peerage--perhaps, even with a good estate to accompany your\ndukedom.\"\n\n\"At least,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"it will give me an opportunity of\nshowing the king that he is not mistaken in occasionally calling me his\nfriend; an opportunity, dear M. Malicorne, for which I am indebted to\nyou.\"\n\n\"And which you will not forget to remember?\" inquired Malicorne,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Nothing will delight me more, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But I am not the king's friend; I am simply his attendant.\"\n\n\"Yes; and if you imagine that that staircase is as good as a dukedom for\nmyself, I think there will certainly be letters of nobility at the top\nof it for you.\"\n\nMalicorne bowed.\n\n\"All I have to do now,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"is to move as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"I do not think the king will object to it. Ask his permission,\nhowever.\"\n\n\"I will go and see him this very moment.\"\n\n\"And I will run and get the carpenter I was speaking of.\"\n\n\"When will he be here?\"\n\n\"This very evening.\"\n\n\"Do not forget your precautions.\"\n\n\"He shall be brought with his eyes bandaged.\"\n\n\"And I will send you one of my carriages.\"\n\n\"Without arms.\"\n\n\"And one of my servants without livery. But stay, what will La Valliere\nsay if she sees what is going on?\"\n\n\"Oh! I can assure you she will be very much interested in the operation,\nand I am equally sure that if the king has not courage enough to ascend\nto her room, she will have sufficient curiosity to come down to him.\"\n\n\"We will live in hope,\" said Saint-Aignan; \"and now I am off to his\nmajesty. At what time will the carpenter be here?\"\n\n\"At eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"How long do you suppose he will take to make this opening?\"\n\n\"About a couple of hours; only afterwards he must have sufficient time\nto construct what may be called the hyphen between the two rooms. One\nnight and a portion of the following day will do; we must not reckon\nupon less than two days, including putting up the staircase.\"\n\n\"Two days, that is a very long time.\"\n\n\"Nay; when one undertakes to open up communications with paradise\nitself, we must at least take care that the approaches are respectable.\"\n\n\"Quite right; so farewell for a short time, dear M. Malicorne. I shall\nbegin to remove the day after to-morrow, in the evening.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV. The Promenade by Torchlight.\n\nSaint-Aignan, delighted with what he had just heard, and rejoiced at\nwhat the future foreshadowed for him, bent his steps towards De Guiche's\ntwo rooms. He who, a quarter of an hour previously, would hardly\nyield up his own rooms for a million francs, was now ready to expend\na million, if it were necessary, upon the acquisition of the two happy\nrooms he coveted so eagerly. But he did not meet with so many obstacles.\nM. de Guiche did not yet know where he was to lodge, and, besides,\nwas still too far ill to trouble himself about his lodgings; and so\nSaint-Aignan obtained De Guiche's two rooms without difficulty. As for\nM. Dangeau, he was so immeasurably delighted, that he did not even give\nhimself the trouble to think whether Saint-Aignan had any particular\nreason for removing. Within an hour after Saint-Aignan's new resolution,\nhe was in possession of the two rooms; and ten minutes later Malicorne\nentered, followed by the upholsterers. During this time, the king asked\nfor Saint-Aignan; the valet ran to his late apartments and found M.\nDangeau there; Dangeau sent him on to De Guiche's, and Saint-Aignan was\nfound there; but a little delay had of course taken place, and the king\nhad already exhibited once or twice evident signs of impatience, when\nSaint-Aignan entered his royal master's presence, quite out of breath.\n\n\"You, too, abandon me, then,\" said Louis XIV., in a similar tone\nof lamentation to that with which Caesar, eighteen hundred years\npreviously, had pronounced the _Et tu quoque_.\n\n\"Sire, I am far from abandoning you, for, on the contrary, I am busily\noccupied in changing my lodgings.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I thought you had finished moving three days ago.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. But I don't find myself comfortable where I am, so I am\ngoing to change to the opposite side of the building.\"\n\n\"Was I not right when I said you were abandoning me?\" exclaimed the\nking. \"Oh! this exceeds all endurance. But so it is: there was only\none woman for whom my heart cared at all, and all my family is leagued\ntogether to tear her from me; and my friend, to whom I confided my\ndistress, and who helped me to bear up under it, has become wearied\nof my complaints and is going to leave me without even asking my\npermission.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan began to laugh. The king at once guessed there must be some\nmystery in this want of respect. \"What is it?\" cried the king, full of\nhope.\n\n\"This, sire, that the friend whom the king calumniates is going to try\nif he cannot restore to his sovereign the happiness he has lost.\"\n\n\"Are you going to let me see La Valliere?\" said Louis XIV.\n\n\"I cannot say so, positively, but I hope so.\"\n\n\"How--how?--tell me that, Saint-Aignan. I wish to know what your project\nis, and to help you with all my power.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"I cannot, even myself, tell very well how\nI must set about attaining success; but I have every reason to believe\nthat from to-morrow--\"\n\n\"To-morrow, do you say! What happiness! But why are you changing your\nrooms?\"\n\n\"In order to serve your majesty to better advantage.\"\n\n\"How can your moving serve me?\"\n\n\"Do you happen to know where the two rooms destined for De Guiche are\nsituated?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, your majesty now knows where I am going.\"\n\n\"Very likely; but that does not help me.\"\n\n\"What! is it possible that you do not understand, sire, that above\nDe Guiche's lodgings are two rooms, one of which is Mademoiselle\nMontalais's, and the other--\"\n\n\"La Valliere's, is it not so, Saint-Aignan? Oh! yes, yes. It is a\nbrilliant idea, Saint-Aignan, a true friend's idea, a poet's idea. By\nbringing me nearer her from whom the world seems to unite to separate\nme--you are far more than Pylades was for Orestes, or Patroclus for\nAchilles.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Aignan, with a smile, \"I question whether, if your majesty\nwere to know my projects in their full extent, you would continue to\npronounce such a pompous eulogium upon me. Ah! sire, I know how very\ndifferent are the epithets which certain Puritans of the court will\nnot fail to apply to me when they learn of what I intend to do for your\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"Saint-Aignan, I am dying with impatience; I am in a perfect fever; I\nshall never be able to wait until to-morrow--to-morrow! why, to-morrow\nis an eternity!\"\n\n\"And yet, sire, I shall require you, if you please, to go out presently\nand divert your impatience by a good walk.\"\n\n\"With you--agreed; we will talk about your projects, we will talk of\nher.\"\n\n\"Nay, sire; I remain here.\"\n\n\"Whom shall I go out with, then?\"\n\n\"With the queen and all the ladies of the court.\"\n\n\"Nothing shall induce me to do that, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"And yet, sire, you must.\"\n\n\"_Must?_--no, no--a thousand times no! I will never again expose\nmyself to the horrible torture of being close to her, of seeing her, of\ntouching her dress as I pass by her, and yet not be able to say a\nword to her. No, I renounce a torture which you suppose will bring me\nhappiness, but which consumes and eats away my very life; to see her in\nthe presence of strangers, and not to tell her that I love her, when my\nwhole being reveals my affection and betrays me to every one; no! I have\nsworn never to do it again, and I will keep my oath.\"\n\n\"Yet, sire, pray listen to me for a moment.\"\n\n\"I will listen to nothing, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"In that case, I will continue; it is most urgent, sire--pray understand\nme, it is of the greatest importance--that Madame and her maids of honor\nshould be absent for two hours from the palace.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand your meaning at all, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"It is hard for me to give my sovereign directions what to do; but under\nthe circumstances I do give you directions, sire; and either a hunting\nor a promenade party must be got up.\"\n\n\"But if I were to do what you wish, it would be a caprice, a mere whim.\nIn displaying such an impatient humor I show my whole court that I have\nno control over my own feelings. Do not people already say that I am\ndreaming of the conquest of the world, but that I ought previously to\nbegin by achieving a conquest over myself?\"\n\n\"Those who say so, sire, are as insolent as they would like to be\nthought facetious; but whomever they may be, if your majesty prefers\nto listen to them, I have nothing further to say. In such a case,\nthat which we have fixed to take place to-morrow must be postponed\nindefinitely.\"\n\n\"Nay, Saint-Aignan, I will go out this evening--I will go by torchlight\nto Saint-Germain: I will breakfast there to-morrow, and will return to\nParis by three o'clock. Will that do?\"\n\n\"Admirably.\"\n\n\"In that case I will set out this evening at eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Your majesty has fixed upon the exact minute.\"\n\n\"And you positively will tell me nothing more?\"\n\n\"It is because I have nothing more to tell you. Industry counts for\nsomething in this world, sire; but still, chance plays so important\na part in it that I have been accustomed to leave her the sidewalk,\nconfident that she will manage so as to always take the street.\"\n\n\"Well, I abandon myself entirely to you.\"\n\n\"And you are quite right.\"\n\nComforted in this manner, the king went immediately to Madame, to whom\nhe announced the intended expedition. Madame fancied at the first moment\nthat she saw in this unexpectedly arranged party a plot of the king's\nto converse with La Valliere, either on the road under cover of the\ndarkness, or in some other way, but she took especial care not to show\nany of her fancies to her brother-in-law, and accepted the invitation\nwith a smile upon her lips. She gave directions aloud that her maids of\nhonor should accompany her, secretly intending in the evening to take\nthe most effectual steps to interfere with his majesty's attachment.\nThen, when she was alone, and at the very moment the poor lover, who\nhad issued orders for the departure, was reveling in the idea that\nMademoiselle de la Valliere would form one of the party,--luxuriating in\nthe sad happiness persecuted lovers enjoy of realizing through the\nsense of sight alone all the transports of possession,--Madame, who\nwas surrounded by her maids of honor, was saying:--\"Two ladies will\nbe enough for me this evening, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente and\nMademoiselle de Montalais.\"\n\nLa Valliere had anticipated her own omission, and was prepared for it:\nbut persecution had rendered her courageous, and she did not give Madame\nthe pleasure of seeing on her face the impression of the shock her heart\nreceived. On the contrary, smiling with that ineffable gentleness which\ngave an angelic expression to her features--\"In that case, Madame, I\nshall be at liberty this evening, I suppose?\" she said.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I shall be able to employ it, then, in progressing with that piece of\ntapestry which your highness has been good enough to notice, and which I\nhave already had the honor of offering to you.\"\n\nAnd having made a respectful obeisance she withdrew to her own\napartment; Mesdemoiselles de Tonnay-Charente and de Montalais did the\nsame. The rumor of the intended promenade soon spread all over the\npalace; ten minutes afterwards Malicorne learned Madame's resolution,\nand slipped under Montalais's door a note, in the following terms:\n\n\"L. V. must positively pass the night the night with Madame.\"\n\nMontalais, in pursuance of the compact she had entered into, began by\nburning the letter, and then sat down to reflect. Montalais was a girl\nfull of expedients, and so she very soon arranged her plan. Towards five\no'clock, which was the hour for her to repair to Madame's apartment, she\nwas running across the courtyard, and had reached within a dozen paces\nof a group of officers, when she uttered a cry, fell gracefully on\none knee, rose again, with difficulty, and walked on limpingly. The\ngentlemen ran forward to her assistance; Montalais had sprained her\nfoot. Faithful to the discharge of her duty, she insisted, however,\nnotwithstanding her accident, upon going to Madame's apartments.\n\n\"What is the matter, and why do you limp so?\" she inquired; \"I mistook\nyou for La Valliere.\"\n\nMontalais related how it had happened, that in hurrying on, in order to\narrive as quickly as possible, she had sprained her foot. Madame seemed\nto pity her, and wished to have a surgeon sent for immediately, but\nshe, assuring her that there was nothing really serious in the accident,\nsaid: \"My only regret, Madame, is, that it will preclude my attendance\non you, and I should have begged Mademoiselle de la Valliere to take my\nplace with your royal highness, but--\" seeing that Madame frowned, she\nadded--\"I have not done so.\"\n\n\"Why did you not do so?\" inquired Madame.\n\n\"Because poor La Valliere seemed so happy to have her liberty for a\nwhole evening and night too, that I did not feel courageous enough to\nask her to take my place.\"\n\n\"What, is she so delighted as that?\" inquired madame, struck by these\nwords.\n\n\"She is wild with delight; she, who is always so melancholy, was singing\nlike a bird. Besides, your highness knows how much she detests going out,\nand also that her character has a spice of wildness in it.\"\n\n\"So!\" thought Madame, \"this extreme delight hardly seems natural to me.\"\n\n\"She has already made all her preparations for dining in her own room\n_tete-a-tete_ with one of her favorite books. And then, as your highness\nhas six other young ladies who would be delighted to accompany you, I\ndid not make my proposal to La Valliere.\" Madame did not say a word in\nreply.\n\n\"Have I acted properly?\" continued Montalais, with a slight fluttering\nof the heart, seeing the little success that seemed to attend the _ruse\nde guerre_ which she had relied upon with so much confidence that she\nhad not thought it even necessary to try and find another. \"Does Madame\napprove of what I have done?\" she continued.\n\nMadame was reflecting that the king could very easily leave\nSaint-Germain during the night, and that, as it was only four leagues\nand a half from Paris to Saint-Germain, he might readily be in Paris\nin an hour's time. \"Tell me,\" she said, \"whether La Valliere, when she\nheard of your accident, offered at least to bear you company?\"\n\n\"Oh! she does not yet know of my accident; but even did she know of it,\nI most certainly should not ask her to do anything that might interfere\nwith her own plans. I think she wishes this evening to realize quietly\nby herself that amusement of the late king, when he said to M. de\nCinq-Mars, 'Let us amuse ourselves by doing nothing, and making\nourselves miserable.'\"\n\nMadame felt convinced that some mysterious love adventure lurked behind\nthis strong desire for solitude. The secret _might_ be Louis's return\nduring the night; it could not be doubted any longer La Valliere had\nbeen informed of his intended return, and that was the reason for her\ndelight at having to remain behind at the Palais Royal. It was a plan\nsettled and arranged beforehand.\n\n\"I will not be their dupe though,\" said Madame, and she took a decisive\nstep. \"Mademoiselle de Montalais,\" she said, \"will you have the\ngoodness to inform your friend, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, that I\nam exceedingly sorry to disarrange her projects of solitude, but that\ninstead of becoming _ennuyee_ by remaining behind alone as she wished,\nshe will be good enough to accompany us to Saint-Germain and get\n_ennuyee_ there.\"\n\n\"Ah! poor La Valliere,\" said Montalais, compassionately, but with her\nheart throbbing with delight; \"oh, Madame, could there not be some\nmeans--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Madame; \"I desire it. I prefer Mademoiselle la Baume le\nBlanc's society to that of any one else. Go, and send her to me, and\ntake care of your foot.\"\n\nMontalais did not wait for the order to be repeated; she returned to her\nroom, almost forgetting to feign lameness, wrote an answer to Malicorne,\nand slipped it under the carpet. The answer simply said: \"She shall.\" A\nSpartan could not have written more laconically.\n\n\"By this means,\" thought Madame, \"I will look narrowly after all on the\nroad; she shall sleep near me during the night, and his majesty must\nbe very clever if he can exchange a single word with Mademoiselle de la\nValliere.\"\n\nLa Valliere received the order to set off with the same indifferent\ngentleness with which she had received the order to play Cinderella.\nBut, inwardly, her delight was extreme, and she looked upon this change\nin the princess's resolution as a consolation which Providence had sent\nher. With less penetration than Madame possessed, she attributed all\nto chance. While every one, with the exception of those in disgrace,\nof those who were ill, and those who were suffering from sprains, were\nbeing driven towards Saint-Germain, Malicorne smuggled his workman into\nthe palace in one of M. de Saint-Aignan's carriages, and led him into\nthe room corresponding to La Valliere's. The man set to work with a\nwill, tempted by the splendid reward which had been promised him. As the\nvery best tools and implements had been selected from the reserve stock\nbelonging to the engineers attached to the king's household--and among\nothers, a saw with teeth so sharp and well tempered that it was able,\nunder water even, to cut through oaken joists as hard as iron--the work\nin question advanced very rapidly, and a square portion of the ceiling,\ntaken from between two of the joists, fell into the arms of the\ndelighted Saint-Aignan, Malicorne, the workman, and a confidential\nvalet, the latter being one brought into the world to see and hear\neverything, but to repeat nothing. In accordance with a new plan\nindicated by Malicorne, the opening was effected in an angle of the\nroom--and for this reason. As there was no dressing-closet adjoining La\nValliere's room, she had solicited, and had that very morning obtained,\na large screen intended to serve as a partition. The screen that had\nbeen allotted her was perfectly sufficient to conceal the opening, which\nwould, besides, be hidden by all the artifices skilled cabinet-makers\nwould have at their command. The opening having been made, the workman\nglided between the joists, and found himself in La Valliere's room. When\nthere, he cut a square opening in the flooring, and out of the boards he\nmanufactured a trap so accurately fitting into the opening that the most\npractised eye could hardly detect the necessary interstices made by its\nlines of juncture with the floor. Malicorne had provided for everything:\na ring and a couple of hinges which had been bought for the purpose,\nwere affixed to the trap-door; and a small circular stair-case, packed\nin sections, had been bought ready made by the industrious Malicorne,\nwho had paid two thousand francs for it. It was higher than what was\nrequired, but the carpenter reduced the number of steps, and it\nwas found to suit exactly. This staircase, destined to receive so\nillustrious a burden, was merely fastened to the wall by a couple of\niron clamps, and its base was fixed into the floor of the comte's room\nby two iron pegs screwed down tightly, so that the king, and all his\ncabinet councilors too, might pass up and down the staircase without any\nfear. Every blow of the hammer fell upon a thick pad or cushion, and\nthe saw was not used until the handle had been wrapped in wool, and the\nblade steeped in oil. The noisiest part of the work, moreover, had taken\nplace during the night and early in the morning, that is to say, when\nLa Valliere and Madame were both absent. When, about two o'clock in the\nafternoon, the court returned to the Palais Royal, La Valliere went up\ninto her own room. Everything was in its proper place--not the smallest\nparticle of sawdust, not the smallest chip, was left to bear witness to\nthe violation of her domicile. Saint-Aignan, however, wishing to do his\nutmost in forwarding the work, had torn his fingers and his shirt\ntoo, and had expended no ordinary amount of perspiration in the king's\nservice. The palms of his hands were covered with blisters, occasioned\nby his having held the ladder for Malicorne. He had, moreover, brought\nup, one by one, the seven pieces of the staircase, each consisting of\ntwo steps. In fact, we can safely assert that, if the king had seen him\nso ardently at work, his majesty would have sworn an eternal gratitude\ntowards his faithful attendant. As Malicorne anticipated, the workman\nhad completely finished the job in twenty-four hours; he received\ntwenty-four louis, and left, overwhelmed with delight, for he had gained\nin one day as much as six months' hard work would have procured him.\nNo one had the slightest suspicion of what had taken place in the room\nunder Mademoiselle de la Valliere's apartment. But in the evening of the\nsecond day, at the very moment La Valliere had just left Madame's circle\nand returned to her own room, she heard a slight creaking sound in one\ncorner. Astonished, she looked to see whence it proceeded, and the noise\nbegan again. \"Who is there?\" she said, in a tone of alarm.\n\n\"It is I, Louise,\" replied the well-known voice of the king.\n\n\"You! you!\" cried the young girl, who for a moment fancied herself under\nthe influence of a dream. \"But where? You, sire?\"\n\n\"Here,\" replied the king, opening one of the folds of the screen, and\nappearing like a ghost at the end of the room.\n\nLa Valliere uttered a loud cry, and fell trembling into an armchair, as\nthe king advanced respectfully towards her.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV. The Apparition.\n\nLa Valliere very soon recovered from her surprise, for, owing to his\nrespectful bearing, the king inspired her with more confidence by his\npresence than his sudden appearance had deprived her of. But, as he\nnoticed that which made La Valliere most uneasy was the means by which\nhe had effected an entrance into her room, he explained to her the\nsystem of the staircase concealed by the screen, and strongly disavowed\nthe notion of his being a supernatural appearance.\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" said La Valliere, shaking her fair head with a most engaging\nsmile, \"present or absent, you do not appear to my mind more at one time\nthan at another.\"\n\n\"Which means, Louise--\"\n\n\"Oh, what you know so well, sire; that there is not one moment in which\nthe poor girl whose secret you surprised at Fontainebleau, and whom\nyou came to snatch from the foot of the cross itself, does not think of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Louise, you overwhelm me with joy and happiness.\"\n\nLa Valliere smiled mournfully, and continued: \"But, sire, have you\nreflected that your ingenious invention could not be of the slightest\nservice to us?\"\n\n\"Why so? Tell me,--I am waiting most anxiously.\"\n\n\"Because this room may be subject to being searched at any moment of\nthe day. Madame herself may, at any time, come here accidentally; my\ncompanions run in at any moment they please. To fasten the door on the\ninside, is to denounce myself as plainly as if I had written above, 'No\nadmittance,--the king is within!' Even now, sire, at this very moment,\nthere is nothing to prevent the door opening, and your majesty being\nseen here.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the king, laughingly, \"I should indeed be taken for\na phantom, for no one can tell in what way I came here. Besides, it is\nonly spirits that can pass through brick walls, or floors and ceilings.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, reflect for a moment how terrible the scandal would be!\nNothing equal to it could ever have been previously said about the\nmaids of honor, poor creatures! whom evil report, however, hardly ever\nspares.\"\n\n\"And your conclusion from all this, my dear Louise,--come, explain\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Alas! it is a hard thing to say--but your majesty must suppress\nstaircase plots, surprises and all; for the evil consequences which\nwould result from your being found here would be far greater than our\nhappiness in seeing each other.\"\n\n\"Well, Louise,\" replied the king, tenderly, \"instead of removing this\nstaircase by which I have ascended, there is a far more simple means, of\nwhich you have not thought.\"\n\n\"A means--another means!\"\n\n\"Yes, another. Oh, you do not love me as I love you, Louise, since my\ninvention is quicker than yours.\"\n\nShe looked at the king, who held out his hand to her, which she took and\ngently pressed between her own.\n\n\"You were saying,\" continued the king, \"that I shall be detected coming\nhere, where any one who pleases can enter.\"\n\n\"Stay, sire; at this very moment, even while you are speaking about it,\nI tremble with dread of your being discovered.\"\n\n\"But you would not be found out, Louise, if you were to descend the\nstaircase which leads to the room underneath.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! what do you say?\" cried Louise, in alarm.\n\n\"You do not quite understand me, Louise, since you get offended at\nmy very first word; first of all, do you know to whom the apartments\nunderneath belong?\"\n\n\"To M. de Guiche, sire, I believe.\"\n\n\"Not at all; they are M. de Saint-Aignan's.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" cried La Valliere; and this exclamation which escaped\nfrom the young girl's joyous heart made the king's heart throb with\ndelight.\n\n\"Yes, to Saint-Aignan, _our friend_,\" he said.\n\n\"But, sire,\" returned La Valliere, \"I cannot visit M. de\nSaint-Aignan's rooms any more than I could M. de Guiche's. It is\nimpossible--impossible.\"\n\n\"And yet, Louise, I should have thought that, under the safe-conduct of\nthe king, you would venture anything.\"\n\n\"Under the safe-conduct of the king,\" she said, with a look full of\ntenderness.\n\n\"You have faith in my word, I hope, Louise?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, when you are not present; but when you are present,--when\nyou speak to me,--when I look upon you, I have faith in nothing.\"\n\n\"What can possibly be done to reassure you?\"\n\n\"It is scarcely respectful, I know, to doubt the king, but--for me--you\nare _not_ the king.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven!--I, at least, hope so most devoutly; you see how\nanxiously I am trying to find or invent a means of removing all\ndifficulty. Stay; would the presence of a third person reassure you?\"\n\n\"The presence of M. de Saint-Aignan would, certainly.\"\n\n\"Really, Louise, you wound me by your suspicions.\"\n\nLouise did not answer, she merely looked steadfastly at him with that\nclear, piercing gaze which penetrates the very heart, and said softly to\nherself, \"Alas! alas! it is not you of whom I am afraid,--it is not you\nupon whom my doubts would fall.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the king, sighing, \"I agree; and M. de Saint-Aignan, who\nenjoys the inestimable privilege of reassuring you, shall always be\npresent at our interviews, I promise you.\"\n\n\"You promise that, sire?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor as a gentleman; and you, on your side--\"\n\n\"Oh, wait, sire, that is not all yet; for such conversations ought, at\nleast, to have a reasonable motive of some kind for M. de Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Dear Louise, every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours, and my only\nstudy is to equal you on that point. It shall be just as you wish:\ntherefore our conversations shall have a reasonable motive, and I have\nalready hit upon one; so that from to-morrow, if you like--\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"Do you meant that that is not soon enough?\" exclaimed the king,\ncaressing La Valliere's hand between his own.\n\nAt this moment the sound of steps was heard in the corridor.\n\n\"Sire! sire!\" cried La Valliere, \"some one is coming; do you hear? Oh,\nfly! fly! I implore you.\"\n\nThe king made but one bound from the chair where he was sitting to his\nhiding-place behind the screen. He had barely time; for as he drew\none of the folds before him, the handle of the door was turned, and\nMontalais appeared at the threshold. As a matter of course she entered\nquite naturally, and without any ceremony, for she knew perfectly\nwell that to knock at the door beforehand would be showing a suspicion\ntowards La Valliere which would be displeasing to her. She accordingly\nentered, and after a rapid glance round the room, in the brief course of\nwhich she observed two chairs very close to each other, she was so long\nin shutting the door, which seemed to be difficult to close, one can\nhardly tell how or why, that the king had ample time to raise the\ntrap-door, and to descend again to Saint-Aignan's room.\n\n\"Louise,\" she said to her, \"I want to talk to you, and seriously, too.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! my dear Aure, what is the matter now?\"\n\n\"The matter is, that Madame suspects _everything_.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Is there any occasion for us to enter into explanations, and do you not\nunderstand what I mean? Come, you must have noticed the fluctuations in\nMadame's humor during several days past; you must have noticed how she\nfirst kept you close beside her, then dismissed you, and then sent for\nyou again.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed it, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, it seems Madame has now succeeded in obtaining sufficient\ninformation, for she has now gone straight to the point, as there is\nnothing further left in France to withstand the torrent which sweeps\naway all obstacles before it; you know what I mean by the torrent?\"\n\nLa Valliere hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"I mean,\" continued Montalais, pitilessly, \"that torrent which burst\nthrough the gates of the Carmelites of Chaillot, and overthrew all the\nprejudices of the court, as well at Fontainebleau as at Paris.\"\n\n\"Alas! alas!\" murmured La Valliere, her face still covered by her hands,\nand her tears streaming through her fingers.\n\n\"Oh, don't distress yourself in that manner, or you have only heard half\nof your troubles.\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name,\" exclaimed the young girl, in great anxiety, \"what is\nthe matter?\"\n\n\"Well, then, this is how the matter stands: Madame, who can no longer\nrely upon any further assistance in France; for she has, one after the\nother, made use of the two queens, of Monsieur, and the whole court,\ntoo, now bethinks herself of a certain person who has certain pretended\nrights over you.\"\n\nLa Valliere became as white as a marble statue.\n\n\"This person,\" continued Madame, \"is not in Paris at this moment; but,\nif I am not mistaken, is, just now, in England.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" breathed La Valliere, almost overwhelmed with terror.\n\n\"And is to be found, I think, at the court of Charles II.; am I right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, this evening a letter has been dispatched by Madame to Saint\nJames's, with directions for the courier to go straight to Hampton\nCourt, which I believe is one of the royal residences, situated about a\ndozen miles from London.\"\n\n\"Yes, well?\"\n\n\"Well; as Madame writes regularly to London once a fortnight, and as the\nordinary courier left for London not more than three days ago, I have\nbeen thinking that some serious circumstance alone could have induced\nher to write again so soon, for you know she is a very indolent\ncorrespondent.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"This letter has been written, therefore, something tells me so, at\nleast, on your account.\"\n\n\"On my account?\" repeated the unhappy girl, mechanically.\n\n\"And I, who saw the letter lying on Madame's desk before she sealed it,\nfancied I could read--\"\n\n\"What did you fancy you could read?\"\n\n\"I might possibly have been mistaken, though--\"\n\n\"Tell me,--what was it?\"\n\n\"The name of Bragelonne.\"\n\nLa Valliere rose hurriedly from her chair, a prey to the most painful\nagitation. \"Montalais,\" she said, her voice broken by sobs, \"all my\nsmiling dreams of youth and innocence have fled already. I have nothing\nnow to conceal, either from you or any one else. My life is exposed to\nevery one's inspection, and can be opened like a book, in which all\nthe world can read, from the king himself to the first passer-by. Aure,\ndearest Aure, what can I do--what will become of me?\"\n\nMontalais approached close to her, and said, \"Consult your own heart, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Well; I do not love M. de Bragelonne; when I say I do not love him,\nunderstand that I love him as the most affectionate sister could love\nthe best of brothers, but that is not what he requires, nor what I\npromised him.\"\n\n\"In fact, you love the king,\" said Montalais, \"and that is a\nsufficiently good excuse.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do love the king,\" hoarsely murmured the young girl, \"and I have\npaid dearly enough for pronouncing those words. And now, Montalais, tell\nme--what can you do either for me, or against me, in my position?\"\n\n\"You must speak more clearly still.\"\n\n\"What am I to say, then?\"\n\n\"And so you have nothing very particular to tell me?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Louise, in astonishment.\n\n\"Very good; and so all you have to ask me is my advice respecting M.\nRaoul?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\n\"It is a very delicate subject,\" replied Montalais.\n\n\"No, it is nothing of the kind. Ought I to marry him in order to keep\nthe promise I made, or ought I continue to listen to the king?\"\n\n\"You have really placed me in a very difficult position,\" said\nMontalais, smiling; \"you ask me if you ought to marry Raoul, whose\nfriend I am, and whom I shall mortally offend in giving my opinion\nagainst him; and then, you ask me if you should cease to listen to the\nking, whose subject I am, and whom I should offend if I were to advise\nyou in a particular way. Ah, Louise, you seem to hold a difficult\nposition at a very cheap rate.\"\n\n\"You have not understood me, Aure,\" said La Valliere, wounded by the\nslightly mocking tone of her companion; \"if I were to marry M. de\nBragelonne, I should be far from bestowing on him the happiness he\ndeserves; but, for the same reason, if I listen to the king he would\nbecome the possessor of one indifferent in very many aspects, I admit,\nbut one whom his affection confers an appearance of value. What I ask\nyou, then, is to tell me some means of disengaging myself honorably\neither from the one or from the other; or rather, I ask you, from which\nside you think I can free myself most honorably.\"\n\n\"My dear Louise,\" replied Montalais, after a pause, \"I am not one of the\nseven wise men of Greece, and I have no perfectly invariable rules\nof conduct to govern me; but, on the other hand, I have a little\nexperience, and I can assure you that no woman ever asks for advice of\nthe nature which you have just asked me, without being in a terrible\nstate of embarrassment. Besides, you have made a solemn promise, which\nevery principle of honor requires you to fulfil; if, therefore, you are\nembarrassed, in consequence of having undertaken such an engagement, it\nis not a stranger's advice (every one is a stranger to a heart full of\nlove), it is not my advice, I repeat, that can extricate you from your\nembarrassment. I shall not give it you, therefore; and for a greater\nreason still--because, were I in your place, I should feel much more\nembarrassed after the advice than before it. All I can do is, to repeat\nwhat I have already told you; shall I assist you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Very well; that is all. Tell me in what way you wish me to help\nyou; tell me for and against whom,--in this way we shall not make any\nblunders.\"\n\n\"But first of all,\" said La Valliere, pressing her companion's hand,\n\"for whom or against whom do you decide?\"\n\n\"For you, if you are really and truly my friend.\"\n\n\"Are you not Madame's confidant?\"\n\n\"A greater reason for being of service to you; if I were not to know\nwhat is going on in that direction I should not be of any service\nat all, and consequently you would not obtain any advantage from my\nacquaintance. Friendships live and thrive upon a system of reciprocal\nbenefits.\"\n\n\"The result is, then, that you will remain at the same time Madame's\nfriend also?\"\n\n\"Evidently. Do you complain of that?\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" sighed La Valliere, thoughtfully, for this cynical\nfrankness appeared to her an offense both to the woman and the friend.\n\n\"All well and good, then,\" said Montalais, \"for if you did, you would be\nvery foolish.\"\n\n\"You wish to serve me, then?\"\n\n\"Devotedly--if you will serve me in return.\"\n\n\"One would almost say that you do not know my heart,\" said La Valliere,\nlooking at Montalais with her eyes wide open.\n\n\"Why, the fact is, that since we have belonged to the court, my dear\nLouise, we are very much changed.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"It is very simple. Were you the second queen of France yonder, at\nBlois?\"\n\nLa Valliere hung down her head, and began to weep. Montalais looked\nat her in an indefinable manner, and murmured \"Poor girl!\" and then,\nadding, \"Poor king!\" she kissed Louise on the forehead, and returned to\nher apartment, where Malicorne was waiting for her.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI. The Portrait.\n\nIn that malady which is termed love the paroxysms succeed each other\nat intervals, ever accelerating from the moment the disease declares\nitself. By and by, the paroxysms are less frequent, in proportion as\nthe cure approaches. This being laid down as a general axiom, and as the\nleading article of a particular chapter, we will now proceed with\nour recital. The next day, the day fixed by the king for the first\nconversation in Saint-Aignan's room, La Valliere, on opening one of\nthe folds of the screen, found upon the floor a letter in the king's\nhandwriting. The letter had been passed, through a slit in the floor,\nfrom the lower apartment to her own. No indiscreet hand or curious gaze\ncould have brought or did bring this single paper. This, too, was one of\nMalicorne's ideas. Having seen how very serviceable Saint-Aignan would\nbecome to the king on account of his apartment, he did not wish that the\ncourtier should become still more indispensable as a messenger, and so\nhe had, on his own private account, reserved this last post for himself.\nLa Valliere most eagerly read the letter, which fixed two o'clock\nthat same afternoon for the rendezvous, and which indicated the way of\nraising the trap-door which was constructed out of the flooring. \"Make\nyourself look as beautiful as you can,\" added the postscript of the\nletter, words which astonished the young girl, but at the same time\nreassured her.\n\nThe hours passed away very slowly, but the time fixed, however, arrived\nat last. As punctual as the priestess Hero, Louise lifted up the\ntrap-door at the last stroke of the hour of two, and found the king on\nthe steps, waiting for her with the greatest respect, in order to\ngive her his hand to descend. The delicacy and deference shown in this\nattention affected her very powerfully. At the foot of the staircase\nthe two lovers found the comte, who, with a smile and a low reverence\ndistinguished by the best taste, expressed his thanks to La Valliere\nfor the honor she conferred upon him. Then turning towards the king, he\nsaid:\n\n\"Sire, our man is here.\" La Valliere looked at the king with some\nuneasiness.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the king, \"if I have begged you to do me the honor\nof coming down here, it was from an interested motive. I have procured\na most admirable portrait painter, who is celebrated for the fidelity\nof his likenesses, and I wish you to be kind enough to authorize him\nto paint yours. Besides, if you positively wish it, the portrait shall\nremain in your own possession.\" La Valliere blushed. \"You see,\" said\nthe king to her, \"we shall not be three as you wished, but four instead.\nAnd, so long as we are not alone, there can be as many present as you\nplease.\" La Valliere gently pressed her royal lover's hand.\n\n\"Shall we pass into the next room, sire?\" said Saint-Aignan, opening the\ndoor to let his guests precede him. The king walked behind La Valliere,\nand fixed his eyes lingeringly and passionately upon that neck as white\nas snow, upon which her long fair ringlets fell in heavy masses. La\nValliere was dressed in a thick silk robe of pearl gray color, with a\ntinge of rose, with jet ornaments, which displayed to greater effect\nthe dazzling purity of her skin, holding in her slender and transparent\nhands a bouquet of heartsease, Bengal roses, and clematis, surrounded\nwith leaves of the tenderest green, above which uprose, like a tiny\ngoblet spilling magic influence a Haarlem tulip of gray and violet tints\nof a pure and beautiful species, which had cost the gardener five years'\ntoil of combinations, and the king five thousand francs. Louis had\nplaced this bouquet in La Valliere's hand as he saluted her. In the\nroom, the door of which Saint-Aignan had just opened, a young man was\nstanding, dressed in a purple velvet jacket, with beautiful black eyes\nand long brown hair. It was the painter; his canvas was quite ready, and\nhis palette prepared for use.\n\nHe bowed to La Valliere with the grave curiosity of an artist who\nis studying his model, saluted the king discreetly, as if he did not\nrecognize him, and as he would, consequently, have saluted any other\ngentleman. Then, leading Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the seat he had\narranged for her, he begged her to sit down.\n\nThe young girl assumed an attitude graceful and unrestrained, her hands\noccupied and her limbs reclining on cushions; and in order that her gaze\nmight not assume a vague or affected expression, the painter begged\nher to choose some kind of occupation, so as to engage her attention;\nwhereupon Louis XIV., smiling, sat down on the cushions at La Valliere's\nfeet; so that she, in the reclining posture she had assumed, leaning\nback in the armchair, holding her flowers in her hand, and he, with his\neyes raised towards her and fixed devouringly on her face--they, both\ntogether, formed so charming a group, that the artist contemplated\npainting it with professional delight, while on his side, Saint-Aignan\nregarded them with feelings of envy. The painter sketched rapidly; and\nvery soon, beneath the earliest touches of the brush, there started into\nlife, out of the gray background, the gentle, poetry-breathing face,\nwith its soft calm eyes and delicately tinted cheeks, enframed in the\nmasses of hair which fell about her neck. The lovers, however, spoke\nbut little, and looked at each other a great deal; sometimes their eyes\nbecame so languishing in their gaze, that the painter was obliged to\ninterrupt his work in order to avoid representing an Erycina instead\nof La Valliere. It was on such occasions that Saint-Aignan came to the\nrescue, and recited verses, or repeated one of those little tales such\nas Patru related, and Tallemant des Reaux wrote so cleverly. Or, it\nmight be that La Valliere was fatigued, and the sitting was, therefore,\nsuspended for awhile; and, immediately, a tray of precious porcelain\nladen with the most beautiful fruits which could be obtained, and rich\nwines distilling their bright colors in silver goblets, beautifully\nchased, served as accessories to the picture of which the painter could\nbut retrace the most ephemeral resemblance.\n\nLouis was intoxicated with love, La Valliere with happiness,\nSaint-Aignan with ambition, and the painter was storing up recollections\nfor his old age. Two hours passed away in this manner, and four o'clock\nhaving struck, La Valliere rose, and made a sign to the king. Louis also\nrose, approached the picture, and addressed a few flattering remarks\nto the painter. Saint-Aignan also praised the picture, which, as he\npretended, was already beginning to assume an accurate resemblance. La\nValliere in her turn, blushingly thanked the painter and passed into the\nnext room, where the king followed her, after having previously summoned\nSaint-Aignan.\n\n\"Will you not come to-morrow?\" he said to La Valliere.\n\n\"Oh! sire, pray think that some one will be sure to come to my room, and\nwill not find me there.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"What will become of me in that case?\"\n\n\"You are very apprehensive, Louise.\"\n\n\"But at all events, suppose Madame were to send for me?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied the king, \"will the day never come when you yourself will\ntell me to brave everything so that I may not have to leave you again?\"\n\n\"On that day, sire, I shall be quite out of my mind, and you must not\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, Louise.\"\n\nLa Valliere sighed, but, without the courage to oppose her royal lover's\nwish, she repeated, \"To-morrow, then, since you desire it, sire,\" and\nwith these words she ran lightly up the stairs, and disappeared from her\nlover's gaze.\n\n\"Well, sire?\" inquired Saint-Aignan, when she had left.\n\n\"Well, Saint-Aignan, yesterday I thought myself the happiest of men.\"\n\n\"And does your majesty, then, regard yourself to-day,\" said the comte,\nsmiling, \"as the unhappiest of men?\"\n\n\"No; but my love for her is an unquenchable thirst; in vain do I drink,\nin vain do I swallow the drops of water which your industry procures for\nme; the more I drink, the more unquenchable it becomes.\"\n\n\"Sire, that is in some degree your own fault, and your majesty alone has\nmade the position such as it is.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"In that case, therefore, the means to be happy, is to fancy yourself\nsatisfied, and to wait.\"\n\n\"Wait! you know that word, then?\"\n\n\"There, there, sire--do not despair: I have already been at work on your\nbehalf--I have still other resources in store.\" The king shook his head\nin a despairing manner.\n\n\"What, sire! have you not been satisfied hitherto?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, indeed, yes, my dear Saint-Aignan; but invent, for Heaven's\nsake, invent some further project yet.\"\n\n\"Sire, I undertake to do my best, and that is all that any one can do.\"\n\nThe king wished to see the portrait again, as he was unable to see the\noriginal. He pointed out several alterations to the painter and left the\nroom, and then Saint-Aignan dismissed the artist. The easel, paints, and\npainter himself, had scarcely gone, when Malicorne showed his head in\nthe doorway. He was received by Saint-Aignan with open arms, but still\nwith a little sadness, for the cloud which had passed across the royal\nsun, veiled, in its turn, the faithful satellite, and Malicorne at a\nglance perceived the melancholy that brooded on Saint-Aignan's face.\n\n\"Oh, monsieur le comte,\" he said, \"how sad you seem!\"\n\n\"And good reason too, my dear Monsieur Malicorne. Will you believe that\nthe king is still dissatisfied?\"\n\n\"With his staircase, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; on the contrary, he is delighted with the staircase.\"\n\n\"The decorations of the apartments, I suppose, don't please him.\"\n\n\"Oh! he has not even thought of that. No, indeed, it seems that what has\ndissatisfied the king--\"\n\n\"I will tell you, monsieur le comte,--he is dissatisfied at finding\nhimself the fourth person at a rendezvous of this kind. How is it\npossible you could not have guessed that?\"\n\n\"Why, how is it likely I could have done so, dear M. Malicorne, when I\nfollowed the king's instructions to the very letter?\"\n\n\"Did his majesty really insist on your being present?\"\n\n\"Positively.\"\n\n\"And also required that the painter, whom I met downstairs just now,\nshould be here, too?\"\n\n\"He insisted upon it.\"\n\n\"In that case, I can easily understand why his majesty is dissatisfied.\"\n\n\"What! dissatisfied that I have so punctually and so literally obeyed\nhis orders? I don't understand you.\"\n\nMalicorne began to scratch his ear, as he asked, \"What time did the king\nfix for the rendezvous in your apartments?\"\n\n\"Two o'clock.\"\n\n\"And you were waiting for the king?\"\n\n\"Ever since half-past one; it would have been a fine thing, indeed, to\nhave been unpunctual with his majesty.\"\n\nMalicorne, notwithstanding his respect for Saint-Aignan, could not help\nsmiling. \"And the painter,\" he said, \"did the king wish him to be here\nat two o'clock, also?\"\n\n\"No; but I had him waiting here from midday. Far better, you know, for\na painter to be kept waiting a couple of hours than the king a single\nminute.\"\n\nMalicorne began to laugh aloud. \"Come, dear Monsieur Malicorne,\" said\nSaint-Aignan, \"laugh less at me, and speak a little more freely, I beg.\"\n\n\"Well, then, monsieur le comte, if you wish the king to be a little more\nsatisfied the next time he comes--\"\n\n\"'_Ventre saint-gris!_' as his grandfather used to say; of course I wish\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, all you have to do is, when the king comes to-morrow, to be\nobliged to go away on a most pressing matter of business, which cannot\npossibly be postponed, and stay away for twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"What! leave the king alone for twenty minutes?\" cried Saint-Aignan, in\nalarm.\n\n\"Very well, do as you like; don't pay any attention to what I say,\" said\nMalicorne, moving towards the door.\n\n\"Nay, nay, dear Monsieur Malicorne; on the contrary, go on--I begin to\nunderstand you. But the painter--\"\n\n\"Oh! the painter must be half an hour late.\"\n\n\"Half an hour--do you really think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, decidedly.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I will do as you tell me.\"\n\n\"And my opinion is, that you will be doing perfectly right. Will you\nallow me to call upon you for the latest news to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I have the honor to be your most respectful servant, M. de\nSaint-Aignan,\" said Malicorne, bowing profoundly and retiring from the\nroom backwards.\n\n\"There is no doubt that fellow has more invention than I have,\" said\nSaint-Aignan, as if compelled by his conviction to admit it.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII. Hampton Court.\n\nThe revelation we have witnessed, that Montalais made to La Valliere,\nin a preceding chapter, very naturally makes us return to the principal\nhero of this tale, a poor wandering knight, roving about at the king's\ncaprice. If our readers will be good enough to follow us, we will, in\nhis company, cross that strait, more stormy than the Euripus, which\nseparates Calais from Dover; we will speed across that green and fertile\ncountry, with its numerous little streams; through Maidstone, and many\nother villages and towns, each prettier than the other; and, finally,\narrive at London. From thence, like bloodhounds following a track, after\nhaving ascertained that Raoul had made his first stay at Whitehall,\nhis second at St. James's, and having learned that he had been warmly\nreceived by Monk, and introduced to the best society of Charles II.'s\ncourt, we will follow him to one of Charles II.'s summer residences near\nthe lively little village of Kingston, at Hampton Court, situated on the\nThames. The river is not, at that spot, the boastful highway which bears\nupon its broad bosom its thousands of travelers; nor are its waters\nblack and troubled as those of Cocytus, as it boastfully asserts, \"I,\ntoo, am cousin of the old ocean.\" No, at Hampton Court it is a soft\nand murmuring stream, with moss-fringed banks, reflecting, in its broad\nmirror, the willows and beeches which ornament its sides, and on which\nmay occasionally be seen a light bark indolently reclining among the\ntall reeds, in a little creek formed of alders and forget-me-nots. The\nsurrounding country on all sides smiled in happiness and wealth; the\nbrick cottages from whose chimneys the blue smoke was slowly ascending\nin wreaths, peeped forth from the belts of green holly which environed\nthem; children dressed in red frocks appeared and disappeared amidst\nthe high grass, like poppies bowed by the gentler breath of the passing\nbreeze. The sheep, ruminating with half-closed eyes, lay lazily about\nunder the shadow of the stunted aspens, while, far and near, the\nkingfishers, plumed with emerald and gold, skimmed swiftly along the\nsurface of the water, like a magic ball heedlessly touching, as he\npassed, the line of his brother angler, who sat watching in his boat\nthe fish as they rose to the surface of the sparkling stream. High above\nthis paradise of dark shadows and soft light, rose the palace of Hampton\nCourt, built by Wolsey--a residence the haughty cardinal had been\nobliged, timid courtier that he was, to offer to his master, Henry\nVIII., who had glowered with envy and cupidity at the magnificent\nnew home. Hampton Court, with its brick walls, its large windows, its\nhandsome iron gates, as well as its curious bell turrets, its retired\ncovered walks, and interior fountains, like those of the Alhambra, was\na perfect bower of roses, jasmine, and clematis. Every sense, sight and\nsmell particularly, was gratified, and the reception-rooms formed a very\ncharming framework for the pictures of love which Charles II. unrolled\namong the voluptuous paintings of Titian, of Pordenone and of Van Dyck;\nthe same Charles whose father's portrait--the martyr king--was hanging\nin his gallery, and who could show upon the wainscots of the various\napartments the holes made by the balls of the puritanical followers of\nCromwell, when on the 24th of August, 1648, at the time they had brought\nCharles I. prisoner to Hampton Court. There it was that the king,\nintoxicated with pleasure and adventure, held his court--he, who, a poet\nin feeling, thought himself justified in redeeming, by a whole day of\nvoluptuousness, every minute which had been formerly passed in anguish\nand misery. It was not the soft green sward of Hampton Court--so soft\nthat it almost resembled the richest velvet in the thickness of its\ntexture--nor was it the beds of flowers, with their variegated hues\nwhich encircled the foot of every tree with rose-trees many feet in\nheight, embracing most lovingly their trunks--nor even the enormous\nlime-trees, whose branches swept the earth like willows, offering a\nready concealment for love or reflection beneath the shade of their\nfoliage--it was none of these things for which Charles II. loved his\npalace of Hampton Court. Perhaps it might have been that beautiful sheet\nof water, which the cool breeze rippled like the wavy undulations of\nCleopatra's hair, waters bedecked with cresses and white water-lilies,\nwhose chaste bulbs coyly unfolding themselves beneath the sun's warm\nrays, reveal the golden gems which lie concealed within their milky\npetals--murmuring waters, on the bosom of which black swans majestically\nfloated, and the graceful water-fowl, with their tender broods covered\nwith silken down, darted restlessly in every direction, in pursuit\nof the insects among the reeds, or the fogs in their mossy retreats.\nPerhaps it might have been the enormous hollies, with their dark and\ntender green foliage; or the bridges uniting the banks of the canals in\ntheir embrace; or the fawns browsing in the endless avenues of the park;\nor the innumerable birds that hopped about the gardens, or flew from\nbranch to branch, amidst the emerald foliage.\n\nIt might well have been any of these charms--for Hampton Court had them\nall; and possessed, too, almost forests of white roses, which climbed\nand trailed along the lofty trellises, showering down upon the ground\ntheir snowy leaves rich with soft perfumery. But no, what Charles II.\nmost loved in Hampton Court were the charming figures who, when midday\nwas past, flitted to and fro along the broad terraces of the gardens;\nlike Louis XIV., he had their wealth of beauties painted for his gallery\nby one of the great artists of the period--an artist who well knew the\nsecret of transferring to canvas the rays of light which escaped from\nbeaming eyes heavy laden with love and love's delights.\n\nThe day of our arrival at Hampton Court is almost as clear and bright\nas a summer's day in France; the atmosphere is heavy with the delicious\nperfume of geraniums, sweet-peas, seringas, and heliotrope scattered in\nprofusion around. It is past midday, and the king, having dined after\nhis return from hunting, paid a visit to Lady Castlemaine, the lady who\nwas reputed at the time to hold his heart in bondage; and this proof\nof his devotion discharged, he was readily permitted to pursue his\ninfidelities until evening arrived. Love and amusement ruled the entire\ncourt; it was the period when ladies would seriously interrogate\ntheir ruder companions as to their opinions upon a foot more or\nless captivating, according to whether it wore a pink or lilac silk\nstocking--for it was the period when Charles II. had declared that there\nwas no hope of safety for a woman who wore green silk stockings, because\nMiss Lucy Stewart wore them of that color. While the king is endeavoring\nin all directions to inculcate others with his preferences on this\npoint, we will ourselves bend our steps towards an avenue of beech-trees\nopposite the terrace, and listen to the conversation of a young girl in\na dark-colored dress, who is walking with another of about her own age\ndressed in blue. They crossed a beautiful lawn, from the center of which\nsprang a fountain, with the figure of a siren executed in bronze, and\nstrolled on, talking as they went, towards the terrace, along which,\nlooking out upon the park and interspersed at frequent intervals, were\nerected summer-houses, diverse in form and ornament; these summer-houses\nwere nearly all occupied; the two young women passed on, the one\nblushing deeply, while the other seemed dreamily silent. At last, having\nreached the end of the terrace which looks on the river, and finding\nthere a cool retreat, they sat down close to each other.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" said the younger to her companion.\n\n\"My dear, we are going where you yourself led the way.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you; to the extremity of the palace, towards that seat yonder,\nwhere the young Frenchman is seated, wasting his time in sighs and\nlamentations.\"\n\nMiss Mary Grafton hurriedly said, \"No, no; I am not going there.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Let us go back, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Nay, on the contrary, let us go on, and have an explanation.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"About how it happens that the Vicomte de Bragelonne always accompanies\nyou in all your walks, as you invariably accompany him in his.\"\n\n\"And you conclude either that he loves me, or that I love him?\"\n\n\"Why not?--he is a most agreeable and charming companion.--No one hears\nme, I hope,\" said Lucy Stewart, as she turned round with a smile, which\nindicated, moreover, that her uneasiness on the subject was not extreme.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mary, \"the king is engaged in his summer-house with the\nDuke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Oh! _a propos_ of the duke, Mary, it seems he has shown you great\nattention since his return from France; how is your own heart in that\ndirection?\"\n\nMary Grafton shrugged her shoulders with seeming indifference.\n\n\"Well, well, I will ask Bragelonne about it,\" said Stewart, laughing;\n\"let us go and find him at once.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I wish to speak to him.\"\n\n\"Not yet, one word before you do: come, come, you who know so many of\nthe king's secrets, tell me why M. de Bragelonne is in England?\"\n\n\"Because he was sent as an envoy from one sovereign to another.\"\n\n\"That may be; but, seriously, although politics do not much concern us,\nwe know enough to be satisfied that M. de Bragelonne has no mission of\nserious import here.\"\n\n\"Well, then, listen,\" said Stewart, with assumed gravity, \"for your sake\nI am going to betray a state secret. Shall I tell you the nature of the\nletter which King Louis XIV. gave M. de Bragelonne for King Charles II.?\nI will; these are the very words: 'My brother, the bearer of this is a\ngentleman attached to my court, and the son of one whom you regard most\nwarmly. Treat him kindly, I beg, and try and make him like England.'\"\n\n\"Did it say that!\"\n\n\"Word for word--or something very like it. I will not answer for the\nform, but the substance I am sure of.\"\n\n\"Well, and what conclusion do you, or rather what conclusion does the\nking, draw from that?\"\n\n\"That the king of France has his own reasons for removing M. de\nBragelonne, and for getting him married anywhere else than in France.\"\n\n\"So that, then, in consequence of this letter--\"\n\n\"King Charles received M. de Bragelonne, as you are aware, in the\nmost distinguished and friendly manner; the handsomest apartments in\nWhitehall were allotted to him; and as you are the most valuable\nand precious person in his court, inasmuch as you have rejected his\nheart,--nay, do not blush,--he wished you to take a fancy to this\nFrenchman, and he was desirous to confer upon him so costly a prize.\nAnd this is the reason why you, the heiress of three hundred thousand\npounds, a future duchess, so beautiful, so good, have been thrown in\nBragelonne's way, in all the promenades and parties of pleasure to which\nhe was invited. In fact it was a plot,--a kind of conspiracy.\"\n\nMary Grafton smiled with that charming expression which was habitual to\nher, and pressing her companion's arm, said: \"Thank the king, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but the Duke of Buckingham is jealous, so take care.\"\n\nHardly had she pronounced these words, when the duke appeared from one\nof the pavilions on the terrace, and, approaching the two girls, with\na smile, said, \"You are mistaken, Miss Lucy; I am not jealous; and the\nproof, Miss Mary, is yonder, in the person of M. de Bragelonne himself,\nwho ought to be the cause of my jealousy, but who is dreaming in pensive\nsolitude. Poor fellow! Allow me to leave you for a few minutes, while I\navail myself of those few minutes to converse with Miss Lucy Stewart, to\nwhom I have something to say.\" And then, bowing to Lucy, he added, \"Will\nyou do me the honor to accept my hand, in order that I may lead you to\nthe king, who is waiting for us?\" With these words, Buckingham, still\nsmiling, took Miss Stewart's hand, and led her away. When by herself,\nMary Grafton, her head gently inclined towards her shoulder, with that\nindolent gracefulness of action which distinguishes young English girls,\nremained for a moment with her eyes fixed on Raoul, but as if uncertain\nwhat to do. At last, after first blushing violently, and then turning\ndeadly pale, thus revealing the internal combat which assailed her\nheart, she seemed to make up her mind to adopt a decided course, and\nwith a tolerably firm step, advanced towards the seat on which Raoul\nwas reclining, buried in the profoundest meditation, as we have already\nsaid. The sound of Miss Mary's steps, though they could hardly be heard\nupon the green sward, awakened Raoul from his musing attitude; he\nturned round, perceived the young girl, and walked forward to meet the\ncompanion whom his happy destiny had thrown in his way.\n\n\"I have been sent to you, monsieur,\" said Mary Grafton; \"will you take\ncare of me?\"\n\n\"To whom is my gratitude due, for so great a happiness?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"To the Duke of Buckingham,\" replied Mary, affecting a gayety she did\nnot really feel.\n\n\"To the Duke of Buckingham, do you say?--he who so passionately\nseeks your charming society! Am I really to believe you are serious,\nmademoiselle?\"\n\n\"The fact is, monsieur, you perceive, that everything seems to conspire\nto make us pass the best, or rather the longest, part of our days\ntogether. Yesterday it was the king who desired me to beg you to seat\nyourself next to me at dinner; to-day, it is the Duke of Buckingham who\nbegs me to come and place myself near you on this seat.\"\n\n\"And he has gone away in order to leave us together?\" asked Raoul, with\nsome embarrassment.\n\n\"Look yonder, at the turning of that path; he is just out of sight, with\nMiss Stewart. Are these polite attentions usual in France, monsieur le\nvicomte?\"\n\n\"I cannot very precisely say what people do in France, mademoiselle, for\nI can hardly be called a Frenchman. I have resided in many countries,\nand almost always as a soldier; and then, I have spent a long period of\nmy life in the country. I am almost a savage.\"\n\n\"You do not like your residence in England, I fear.\"\n\n\"I scarcely know,\" said Raoul, inattentively, and sighing deeply at the\nsame time.\n\n\"What! you do not know?\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" said Raoul, shaking his head, and collecting his thoughts,\n\"I did not hear you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the young girl, sighing in her turn, \"how wrong the duke was\nto send me here!\"\n\n\"Wrong!\" said Raoul, \"perhaps so; for I am but a rude, uncouth\ncompanion, and my society annoys you. The duke did, indeed, very wrong\nto send you.\"\n\n\"It is precisely,\" replied Mary Grafton, in a clear, calm voice,\n\"because your society does not annoy me, that the duke was wrong to send\nme to you.\"\n\nIt was now Raoul's turn to blush. \"But,\" he resumed, \"how happens it\nthat the Duke of Buckingham should send you to me; and why did you come?\nthe duke loves you, and you love him.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mary, seriously, \"the duke does not love me, because he\nis in love with the Duchesse d'Orleans; and, as for myself, I have no\naffection for the duke.\"\n\nRaoul looked at the young lady with astonishment.\n\n\"Are you a friend of the Duke of Buckingham?\" she inquired.\n\n\"The duke has honored me by calling me so ever since we met in France.\"\n\n\"You are simple acquaintances, then?\"\n\n\"No; for the duke is the most intimate friend of one whom I regard as a\nbrother.\"\n\n\"The Duc de Guiche?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He who is in love with Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans?\"\n\n\"Oh! What is that you are saying?\"\n\n\"And who loves him in return,\" continued the young girl, quietly.\n\nRaoul bent down his head, and Mary Grafton, sighing deeply, continued,\n\"They are very happy. But, leave me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, for the\nDuke of Buckingham has given you a very troublesome commission in\noffering me as a companion for your promenade. Your heart is elsewhere,\nand it is with the greatest difficulty you can be charitable enough to\nlend me your attention. Confess truly; it would be unfair on your part,\nvicomte, not to admit it.\"\n\n\"Madame, I do confess it.\"\n\nShe looked at him steadily. He was so noble and so handsome in his\nbearing, his eyes revealed so much gentleness, candor, and resolution,\nthat the idea could not possibly enter her mind that he was either\nrudely discourteous, or a mere simpleton. She only perceived, clearly\nenough, that he loved another woman, and not herself, with the whole\nstrength of his heart. \"Ah! I now understand you,\" she said; \"you have\nleft your heart behind you in France.\" Raoul bowed. \"The duke is aware\nof your affection?\"\n\n\"No one knows it,\" replied Raoul.\n\n\"Why, therefore, do you tell me? Nay, answer me.\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"It is for me, then, to anticipate an explanation; you do not wish to\ntell me anything, because you are now convinced that I do not love the\nduke; because you see that I possibly might have loved you; because you\nare a gentleman of noble and delicate sentiments; and because, instead\nof accepting, even were it for the mere amusement of the passing hour,\na hand which is almost pressed upon you; and because, instead of meeting\nmy smiles with a smiling lip, you, who are young, have preferred to tell\nme, whom men have called beautiful, 'My heart is over the sea--it is in\nFrance.' For this, I thank you, Monsieur de Bragelonne; you are, indeed,\na noble-hearted, noble-minded man, and I regard you all the more for it,\nas a friend only. And now let us cease speaking of myself, and talk of\nyour own affairs. Forget that I have ever spoken to you of myself, tell\nme why you are sad, and why you have become more than usually so during\nthese past four days?\"\n\nRaoul was deeply and sensibly moved by these sweet and melancholy tones;\nand as he could not, at the moment, find a word to say, the young girl\nagain came to his assistance.\n\n\"Pity me,\" she said. \"My mother was born in France, and I can truly\naffirm that I, too, am French in blood, as well as in feeling; but the\nleaden atmosphere and characteristic gloom of England seem to weigh\nupon me. Sometimes my dreams are golden-hued and full of wonderful\nenjoyments, when suddenly a mist rises and overspreads my fancy,\nblotting them out forever. Such, indeed, is the case at the present\nmoment. Forgive me; I have now said enough on that subject; give me your\nhand, and relate your griefs to me as a friend.\"\n\n\"You say you are French in heart and soul?\"\n\n\"Yes, not only, I repeat it, that my mother was French, but, further, as\nmy father, a friend of King Charles I., was exiled in France, I, during\nthe trial of that prince, as well as during the Protector's life, was\nbrought up in Paris; at the Restoration of King Charles II., my poor\nfather returned to England, where he died almost immediately afterwards;\nand then the king created me a duchess, and has dowered me according to\nmy rank.\n\n\"Have you any relations in France?\" Raoul inquired, with the deepest\ninterest.\n\n\"I have a sister there, my senior by seven or eight years, who was\nmarried in France, and was early left a widow; her name is Madame de\nBelliere. Do you know her?\" she added, observing Raoul start suddenly.\n\n\"I have heard her name.\"\n\n\"She, too, loves with her whole heart; and her last letters inform me\nshe is happy, and her affection is, I conclude, returned. I told you,\nMonsieur de Bragelonne, that although I possess half of her nature, I do\nnot share her happiness. But let us now speak of yourself; whom do you\nlove in France?\"\n\n\"A young girl, as soft and pure as a lily.\"\n\n\"But if she loves you, why are you sad?\"\n\n\"I have been told that she ceases to love me.\"\n\n\"You do not believe it, I trust?\"\n\n\"He who wrote me so does not sign his letter.\"\n\n\"An anonymous denunciation! some treachery, be assured,\" said Miss\nGrafton.\n\n\"Stay,\" said Raoul, showing the young girl a letter which he had read\nover a thousand times; she took it from his hand and read as follows:\n\n\"VICOMTE,--You are perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the\nlovely faces of Charles II.'s court, for at Louis XIV.'s court, the\ncastle in which your affections are enshrined is being besieged. Stay in\nLondon altogether, poor vicomte, or return without delay to Paris.\"\n\n\"There is no signature,\" said Miss Mary.\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Believe it not, then.\"\n\n\"Very good; but here is a second letter, from my friend De Guiche, which\nsays, 'I am lying here wounded and ill. Return, Raoul, oh, return!'\"\n\n\"What do you intend doing?\" inquired the young girl, with a feeling of\noppression at her heart.\n\n\"My intention, as soon as I received this letter, was immediately to\ntake my leave of the king.\"\n\n\"When did you receive it?\"\n\n\"The day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"It is dated Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"A singular circumstance, do you not think, for the court is now at\nParis? At all events, I would have set off; but when I mentioned my\nintention to the king, he began to laugh, and said to me, 'How comes\nit, monsieur l'amassadeur, that you think of leaving? Has your sovereign\nrecalled you?' I colored, naturally enough, for I was confused by the\nquestion; for the fact is, the king himself sent me here, and I have\nreceived no order to return.\"\n\nMary frowned in deep thought, and said, \"Do you remain, then?\"\n\n\"I must, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Do you ever receive any letters from her to whom you are so devoted?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Never, do you say? Does she not love you, then?\"\n\n\"At least, she has not written to me since my departure, although she\nused occasionally to write to me before. I trust she may have been\nprevented.\"\n\n\"Hush! the duke is coming.\"\n\nAnd Buckingham at that moment was seen at the end of the walk,\napproaching towards them, alone and smiling; he advanced slowly, and\nheld out his hands to them both. \"Have you arrived at an understanding?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About whatever might render you happy, dear Mary, and make Raoul less\nmiserable.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, my lord,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"That is my view of the subject, Miss Mary; do you wish me to mention it\nbefore M. de Bragelonne?\" he added, with a smile.\n\n\"If you mean,\" replied the young girl, haughtily, \"that I was not\nindisposed to love M. de Bragelonne, that is useless, for I have told\nhim so myself.\"\n\nBuckingham reflected for a moment, and, without seeming in any way\ndiscountenanced, as she expected, he said: \"My reason for leaving you\nwith M. de Bragelonne was, that I thoroughly knew your refined delicacy\nof feeling, no less than the perfect loyalty of your mind and heart, and\nI hoped that M. de Bragelonne's cure might be effected by the hands of a\nphysician such as you are.\"\n\n\"But, my lord, before you spoke of M. de Bragelonne's heart, you spoke\nto me of your own. Do you mean to effect the cure of two hearts at the\nsame time?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, madame; but you will do me the justice to admit that\nI have long discontinued a useless pursuit, acknowledging that my own\nwound is incurable.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Mary, collecting herself for a moment before she spoke,\n\"M. de Bragelonne is happy, for he loves and is beloved. He has no need\nof such a physician as I can be.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne,\" said Buckingham, \"is on the very eve of experiencing\na serious misfortune, and he has greater need than ever of sympathy and\naffection.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, my lord,\" inquired Raoul, anxiously.\n\n\"No; gradually I will explain myself; but, if you desire it, I can tell\nMiss Grafton what you may not listen to yourself.\"\n\n\"My lord, you are putting me to the torture; you know something you wish\nto conceal from me?\"\n\n\"I know that Miss Mary Grafton is the most charming object that a heart\nill at ease could possibly meet with in its way through life.\"\n\n\"I have already told you that the Vicomte de Bragelonne loves\nelsewhere,\" said the young girl.\n\n\"He is wrong, then.\"\n\n\"Do you assume to know, my lord, that _I_ am wrong?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Whom is it that he loves, then?\" exclaimed the young girl.\n\n\"He loves a lady who is unworthy of him,\" said Buckingham, with that\ncalm, collected manner peculiar to Englishmen.\n\nMiss Grafton uttered a cry, which, together with the remark that\nBuckingham had that moment made, spread oover De Bragelonne's features a\ndeadly paleness, arising from the sudden surprise, and also from a vague\nfear of impending misfortune. \"My lord,\" he exclaimed, \"you have just\npronounced words which compel me, without a moment's delay, to seek\ntheir explanation in Paris.\"\n\n\"You will remain here,\" said Buckingham, \"because you have no right to\nleave; and no one has the right to quit the service of the king for that\nof any woman, even were she as worthy of being loved as Mary Grafton\nis.\"\n\n\"You will tell me all, then?\"\n\n\"I will, on condition that you will remain.\"\n\n\"I will remain, if you will promise to speak openly and without\nreserve.\"\n\nThus far had their conversation proceeded, and Buckingham, in all\nprobability, was on the point of revealing, not indeed all that had\ntaken place, but at least all he was aware of, when one of the king's\nattendants appeared at the end of the terrace, and advanced towards the\nsummer-house where the king was sitting with Lucy Stewart. A courier\nfollowed him, covered with dust from head to foot, and who seemed as if\nhe had but a few moments before dismounted from his horse.\n\n\"The courier from France! Madame's courier!\" exclaimed Raoul,\nrecognizing the princess's livery; and while the attendant and the\ncourier advanced towards the king, Buckingham and Miss Grafton exchanged\na look full of intelligence with each other.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII. The Courier from Madame.\n\nCharles II. was busily engaged in proving, or in endeavoring to prove,\nto Miss Stewart that she was the only person for whom he cared at all,\nand consequently was avowing to her an affection similar to that which\nhis ancestor Henry IV. had entertained for Gabrielle. Unfortunately for\nCharles II., he had hit upon an unlucky day, the very day Miss Stewart\nhad taken it into her head to make him jealous, and therefore, instead\nof being touched by his offer, as the king had hoped, she laughed\nheartily.\n\n\"Oh! sire, sire,\" she cried, laughing all the while; \"if I were to be\nunfortunate enough to ask you for a proof of the affection you possess,\nhow easy it would be to see that you are telling a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Nay, listen to me,\" said Charles, \"you know my cartoons by Raphael;\nyou know whether I care for them or not; the whole world envies me their\npossession, as you well know also; my father commissioned Van Dyck to\npurchase them. Would you like me to send them to your house this very\nday?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" replied the young girl; \"pray keep them yourself, sire; my\nhouse is far too small to accommodate such visitors.\"\n\n\"In that case you shall have Hampton Court to put the cartoons in.\"\n\n\"Be less generous, sire, and learn to love a little while longer, that\nis all I have to ask you.\"\n\n\"I shall never cease to love you; is not that enough?\"\n\n\"You are smiling, sire.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to weep?\"\n\n\"No; but I should like to see you a little more melancholy.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven, I have been so long enough; fourteen years of exile,\npoverty, and misery, I think I may well regard it as a debt discharged;\nbesides, melancholy makes people look so plain.\"\n\n\"Far from that--for look at the young Frenchman.\"\n\n\"What! the Vicomte de Bragelonne? are you smitten too? By Heaven, they\nwill all grow mad over him one after the other; but he, on the contrary,\nhas a reason for being melancholy.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! you wish me to betray state secrets, do you?\"\n\n\"If I wish it, you must do so, for you told me you were quite ready to\ndo everything I wished.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he is bored in his own country. Does that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Bored?\"\n\n\"Yes, a proof that he is a simpleton; I allow him to fall in love with\nMiss Mary Grafton, and he feels bored. Can you believe it?\"\n\n\"Very good; it seems, then, that if you were to find Miss Lucy Stewart\nindifferent to you, you would console yourself by falling in love with\nMiss Mary Grafton.\"\n\n\"I don't say that; in the first place, you know that Mary Grafton does\nnot care for me; besides, a man can only console himself for a lost\naffection by the discovery of a new one. Again, however, I repeat, the\nquestion is not of myself, but of that young man. One might almost be\ntempted to call the girl he has left behind him a Helen--a Helen before\nthe little ceremony she went through with Paris, of course.\"\n\n\"He has left some one, then?\"\n\n\"That is to say, some one has left _him_.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow! so much the worse!\"\n\n\"Why do you mean by 'so much the worse'?\"\n\n\"Why not? why did he leave?\"\n\n\"Do you think it was of his own wish or will that he left?\"\n\n\"Was he obliged to leave, then?\"\n\n\"He left Paris under orders, my dear Stewart; and prepare to be\nsurprised--by express orders of the king.\"\n\n\"Ah! I begin to see, now.\"\n\n\"At least say nothing at all about it.\"\n\n\"You know very well that I am just as discreet as anybody else. And so\nthe king sent him away?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And during his absence he takes his sweetheart from him?\"\n\n\"Yes; and, will you believe it? the silly fellow, instead of thanking\nthe king, is making himself miserable.\"\n\n\"What! thank the king for depriving him of the woman he loves! Really,\nsire, yours is a most ungallant speech.\"\n\n\"But, pray understand me. If she whom the king had run off with was\neither a Miss Grafton or a Miss Stewart, I should not be of his opinion;\nnay, I should even think him not half wretched enough; but she is a\nlittle, thin, lame thing. Deuce take such fidelity as that! Surely, one\ncan hardly understand how a man can refuse a girl who is rich for one\nwho is poverty itself--a girl who loves him for one who deceives and\nbetrays him.\"\n\n\"Do you think that Mary seriously wishes to please the vicomte, sire?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed.\"\n\n\"Very good! the vicomte will settle down in England, for Mary has a\nclear head, and when she fixes her mind upon anything, she does so\nthoroughly.\"\n\n\"Take care, my dear Miss Stewart; if the vicomte has any idea of\nadopting our country, he has not long to do so, for it was only the day\nbefore yesterday that he again asked me for permission to leave.\"\n\n\"Which you refused him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed; my royal brother is far too anxious for his\nabsence; and, for myself, my _amour propre_ is enlisted on his side, for\nI will never have it said that I had held out as a bait to this young\nman the noblest and gentlest creature in England--\"\n\n\"You are very gallant, sire,\" said Miss Stewart, with a pretty pout.\n\n\"I do not allude to Miss Stewart, for she is worthy of a king's\ndevotion; and since she has captivated me I trust that no one else will\nbe caught by her; I say, therefore, finally, that the attention I have\nshown this young man will not have been thrown away; he will stay with\nus here, he will marry here, or I am very much mistaken.\"\n\n\"And I hope that when he is once married and settled, instead of being\nangry with your majesty, he will be grateful to you, for every one tries\nhis utmost to please him; even the Duke of Buckingham, whose brilliancy,\nwhich is incredible, seems to pale before that of this young Frenchman.\"\n\n\"Including Miss Stewart even, who calls him the most finished gentleman\nshe ever saw.\"\n\n\"Stay, sire; you have spoken quite enough, and quite highly enough, of\nMiss Grafton, to overlook what I may have said about De Bragelonne. But,\nby the by, sire, your kindness for some time past astonishes me: you\nthink of those who are absent, you forgive those who have done you a\nwrong, in fact, you are as nearly as possible, perfect. How does it\nhappen--\"\n\n\"It is because you allow yourself to be loved,\" he said, beginning to\nlaugh.\n\n\"Oh! there must be some other reason.\"\n\n\"Well, I am doing all I can to oblige my brother, Louis XIV.\"\n\n\"Nay, I must have another reason.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the true motive is that Buckingham strongly recommended the\nyoung man to me, saying: 'Sire, I begin by yielding up all claim to Miss\nGrafton; I pray you follow my example.'\"\n\n\"The duke is, indeed, a true gentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh! of course, of course; it is Buckingham's turn now, I suppose, to\nturn your head. You seem determined to cross me in everything to-day.\"\n\nAt this moment some one rapped at the door.\n\n\"Who is it who presumes to interrupt us?\" exclaimed Charles,\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Really, sire, you are extremely vain with your 'who is it who\npresumes?' and in order to punish you for it--\"\n\nShe went to the door and opened it.\n\n\"It is a courier from France,\" said Miss Stewart.\n\n\"A courier from France!\" exclaimed Charles; \"from my sister, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" said the usher, \"a special messenger.\"\n\n\"Let him come in at once,\" said Charles.\n\n\"You have a letter for me,\" said the king to the courier as he entered,\n\"from the Duchess of Orleans?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied the courier, \"and so urgent in its nature that I\nhave only been twenty-six hours in bringing it to your majesty, and yet\nI lost three-quarters of an hour at Calais.\"\n\n\"Your zeal shall not be forgotten,\" said the king, as he opened the\nletter. When he had read it he burst out laughing, and exclaimed, \"Upon\nmy word, I am at a loss to understand anything about it.\" He then read\nthe letter a second time, Miss Stewart assuming a manner marked by the\ngreatest reserve, and doing her utmost to restrain her ardent curiosity.\n\n\"Francis,\" said the king to his valet, \"see that this excellent fellow\nis well taken care of and sleeps soundly, and that on waking to-morrow\nhe finds a purse of fifty sovereigns by his bedside.\"\n\n\"Sire!\" said the courier, amazed.\n\n\"Begone, begone; my sister was perfectly right in desiring you to use\nthe utmost diligence; the affair was most pressing.\" And he again began\nto laugh louder than ever. The courier, the valet, and Miss Stewart\nhardly knew what sort of countenance to assume. \"Ah!\" said the king,\nthrowing himself back in his armchair: \"When I think that you have\nknocked up--how many horses?\"\n\n\"Two!\"\n\n\"Two horses to bring this intelligence to me. That will do, you can\nleave us now.\"\n\nThe courier retired with the valet. Charles went to the window, which he\nopened, and leaning forward, called out--\"Duke! Buckingham! come here,\nthere's a good fellow.\"\n\nThe duke hurried to him, in obedience to the summons; but when he\nreached the door, and perceived Miss Stewart, he hesitated to enter.\n\n\"Come in, and shut the door,\" said the king. The duke obeyed; and,\nperceiving in what an excellent humor the king was, he advanced,\nsmiling, towards him. \"Well, my dear duke, how do you get on with your\nFrenchman?\"\n\n\"Sire, I am in the most perfect state of utter despair about him.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because charming Miss Grafton is willing to marry him, but he is\nunwilling.\"\n\n\"Why, he is a perfect Boeotian!\" cried Miss Stewart. \"Let him say either\n'Yes,' or No,' and let the affair end.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Buckingham, seriously, \"you know, or you ought to know,\nmadame, that M. de Bragelonne is in love in another direction.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the king, coming to Miss Stewart's help, \"nothing\nis easier; let him say 'No,' then.\"\n\n\"Very true; and I have proved to him he was wrong not to say 'Yes.'\"\n\n\"You told him candidly, I suppose, that La Valliere was deceiving him?\"\n\n\"Yes, without the slightest reserve; and, as soon as I had done so, he\ngave a start, as if he were going to clear the Channel at a bound.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Miss Stewart, \"he has done something; and a very\ngood thing too, upon my word.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Buckingham, \"I stopped him; I have left him and Miss Mary in\nconversation together, and I sincerely trust that now he will not leave,\nas he seemed to have an idea of doing.\"\n\n\"An idea of leaving England?\" cried the king.\n\n\"I, at one moment, hardly thought that any human power could have\nprevented him; but Miss Mary's eyes are now bent fully on him, and he\nwill remain.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the very thing which deceives you, Buckingham,\" said the\nking, with a peal of laughter; \"the poor fellow is predestined.\"\n\n\"Predestined to what?\"\n\n\"If it were to be simply deceived, that is nothing; but, to look at him,\nit is a great deal.\"\n\n\"At a distance, and with Miss Grafton's aid, the blow will be warded\noff.\"\n\n\"Far from it, far from it; neither distance nor Miss Grafton's help will\nbe of the slightest avail. Bragelonne will set off for Paris within an\nhour's time.\"\n\nBuckingham started, and Miss Stewart opened her eyes very wide in\nastonishment.\n\n\"But, sire,\" said the duke, \"your majesty knows that it is impossible.\"\n\n\"That is to say, my dear Buckingham, that it is impossible until it\nhappens.\"\n\n\"Do not forget, sire, that the young man is a perfect lion, and that his\nwrath is terrible.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it, my dear duke.\"\n\n\"And that if he sees that his misfortune is certain, so much the worse\nfor the author of it.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it; but what the deuce am I to do?\"\n\n\"Were it the king himself,\" cried Buckingham, \"I would not answer for\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh, the king has his musketeers to take care of him,\" said Charles,\nquietly; \"I know that perfectly well, for I was kept dancing attendance\nin his ante-chamber at Blois. He has M. d'Artagnan, and what better\nguardian could the king have than M. d'Artagnan? I should make myself\nperfectly easy with twenty storms of passion, such as Bragelonne might\ndisplay, if I had four guardians like D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"But I entreat your majesty, who is so good and kind, to reflect a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Charles II., presenting the letter to the duke, \"read, and\nanswer yourself what you would do in my place.\"\n\nBuckingham slowly took hold of Madame's letter, and trembling with\nemotion, read the following words:\n\n\"For your own sake, for mine, for the honor and safety of every one,\nsend M. de Bragelonne back to France immediately. Your devoted sister,\nHENRIETTA.\"\n\n\"Well, Villiers, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Really, sire, I have nothing to say,\" replied the duke, stupefied.\n\n\"Nay, would you, of all persons,\" said the king, artfully, \"advise me\nnot to listen to my sister when she writes so urgently?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, sire; and yet--\"\n\n\"You have not read the postscript, Villiers; it is under the fold of the\nletter, and escaped me at first; read it.\" And as the duke turned down a\nfold of the letter, he read:\n\n\"A thousand kind remembrances to those who love me.\"\n\nThe duke's head sank gradually on his breast; the paper trembled in\nhis fingers, as if it had been changed to lead. The king paused for a\nmoment, and, seeing that Buckingham did not speak, \"He must follow his\ndestiny, as we ours,\" continued the king; \"every man has his own share\nof grief in this world; I have had my own,--I have had that of\nothers who belong to me,--and have thus had a double weight of woe to\nendure!--But the deuce take all my cares now! Go, and bring our friend\nhere, Villiers.\"\n\nThe duke opened the trellised door of the summer-house, and pointing at\nRaoul and Mary, who were walking together side by side, said, \"What a\ncruel blow, sire, for poor Miss Grafton!\"\n\n\"Nonsense; call him,\" said Charles II., knitting his black brows\ntogether; \"every one seems to be sentimental here. There, look at Miss\nStewart, who is wiping her eyes,--now deuce take the French fellow!\"\n\nThe duke called to Raoul, and taking Miss Grafton by the hand, he led\nher towards the king.\n\n\"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" said Charles II., \"did you not ask me the day\nbefore yesterday for permission to return to Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Raoul, greatly puzzled by this address.\n\n\"And I refused you, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"For which you were angry with me?\"\n\n\"No, sire; your majesty had no doubt excellent reasons for withholding\nit; for you are so wise and so good that everything you do is well\ndone.\"\n\n\"I alleged, I believe, as a reason, that the king of France had not\nrecalled you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, that was the reason you assigned.\"\n\n\"Well, M. de Bragelonne, I have reflected over the matter since; if\nthe king did not, in fact, fix your return, he begged me to render your\nsojourn in England as agreeable as possible; since, however, you ask my\npermission to return, it is because your longer residence in England is\nno longer agreeable to you.\"\n\n\"I do not say that, sire.\"\n\n\"No, but your request, at least,\" said the king, \"signified that another\nplace of residence would be more agreeable to you than this.\"\n\nAt this moment Raoul turned towards the door, against which Miss Grafton\nwas leaning, pale and sorrow-stricken; her other hand was passed through\nthe duke's arm.\n\n\"You do not reply,\" pursued Charles; \"the proverb is plain enough, that\n'silence gives consent.' Very good, Monsieur de Bragelonne; I am now in\na position to satisfy you; whenever you please, therefore, you can leave\nfor Paris, for which you have my authority.\"\n\n\"Sire!\" exclaimed Raoul, while Mary stifled an exclamation of grief\nwhich rose to her lips, unconsciously pressing Buckingham's arm.\n\n\"You can be at Dover this evening,\" continued the king, \"the tide serves\nat two o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nRaoul, astounded, stammered out a few broken sentences, which equally\nanswered the purpose both of thanks and of excuse.\n\n\"I therefore bid you adieu, Monsieur de Bragelonne, and wish you every\nsort of prosperity,\" said the king, rising; \"you will confer a pleasure\non me by keeping this diamond in remembrance of me; I had intended it as\na marriage gift.\"\n\nMiss Grafton felt her limbs almost giving way; and, as Raoul received\nthe ring from the king's hand, he, too, felt his strength and courage\nfailing him. He addressed a few respectful words to the king, a passing\ncompliment to Miss Stewart, and looked for Buckingham to bid him adieu.\nThe king profited by this moment to disappear. Raoul found the duke\nengaged in endeavoring to encourage Miss Grafton.\n\n\"Tell him to remain, I implore you!\" said Buckingham to Mary.\n\n\"No, I will tell him to go,\" replied Miss Grafton, with returning\nanimation; \"I am not one of those women who have more pride than heart;\nif she whom he loves is in France, let him return thither and bless me\nfor having advised him to go and seek his happiness there. If, on the\ncontrary, she shall have ceased to love him, let him come back here\nagain; I shall still love him, and his unhappiness will not have\nlessened him in my regard. In the arms of my house you will find that\nwhich Heaven has engraven on my heart--_Habenti parum, egenti cuncta_.\n'To the rich is accorded little, to the poor everything.'\"\n\n\"I do not believe, Bragelonne, that you will find yonder the equivalent\nof what you leave behind you here.\"\n\n\"I think, or at least hope,\" said Raoul, with a gloomy air, \"that she\nwhom I love is worthy of my affection; but if it be true she is unworthy\nof me, as you have endeavored to make me believe, I will tear her image\nfrom my heart, duke, even if my heart breaks in the attempt.\"\n\nMary Grafton gazed upon him with an expression of the most indefinable\npity, and Raoul returned her look with a sweet, sorrowful smile, saying,\n\"Mademoiselle, the diamond which the king has given me was destined\nfor you,--give me leave to offer it for your acceptance: if I marry in\nFrance, you will send it me back; if I do not marry, keep it.\" And he\nbowed and left her.\n\n\"What does he mean?\" thought Buckingham, while Raoul pressed Mary's icy\nhand with marks of the most reverential respect.\n\nMary understood the look that Buckingham fixed upon her.\n\n\"If it were a wedding-ring, I would not accept it,\" she said.\n\n\"And yet you were willing to ask him to return to you.\"\n\n\"Oh! duke,\" cried the young girl in heart-broken accents, \"a woman such\nas I am is never accepted as a consolation by a man like him.\"\n\n\"You do not think he will return, then?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Miss Grafton, in a choking voice.\n\n\"And I grieve to tell you, Mary, that he will find yonder his happiness\ndestroyed, his mistress lost to him. His honor even has not escaped.\nWhat will be left him, then, Mary, equal to your affection? Answer,\nMary, you who know yourself so well.\"\n\nMiss Grafton placed her white hand on Buckingham's arm, and, while Raoul\nwas hurrying away with headlong speed, she repeated in dying accents the\nline from Romeo and Juliet:\n\n\"_I must be gone and live, or stay and die_.\"\n\nAs she finished the last word, Raoul disappeared. Miss Grafton returned\nto her own apartments, paler than death. Buckingham availed himself of\nthe arrival of the courier, who had brought the letter to the king,\nto write to Madame and to the Comte de Guiche. The king had not been\nmistaken, for at two in the morning the tide was at full flood, and\nRaoul had embarked for France.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX. Saint-Aignan Follows Malicorne's Advice.\n\nThe king most assiduously followed the progress which was made in La\nValliere's portrait; and did so with a care and attention arising as\nmuch from a desire that it should resemble her as from the wish that the\npainter should prolong the period of its completion as much as possible.\nIt was amusing to observe him follow the artist's brush, awaiting the\ncompletion of a particular plan, or the result of a combination of\ncolors, and suggesting various modifications to the painter, which the\nlatter consented to adopt with the most respectful docility. And again,\nwhen the artist, following Malicorne's advice, was a little late in\narriving, and when Saint-Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some\ntime, it was interesting to observe, though no one witnessed them, those\nmoments of silence full of deep expression, which united in one sigh\ntwo souls most disposed to understand each other, and who by no means\nobjected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together. The minutes flew\nrapidly by, as if on wings, and as the king drew closer to Louise\nand bent his burning gaze upon her, a noise was suddenly heard in the\nante-room. It was the artist, who had just arrived; Saint-Aignan, too,\nhad returned, full of apologies; and the king began to talk and\nLa Valliere to answer him very hurriedly, their eyes revealing to\nSaint-Aignan that they had enjoyed a century of happiness during his\nabsence. In a word, Malicorne, philosopher that he was, though he knew\nit not, had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the\nmidst of plenty, and with desire in the assurance of possession. La\nValliere's fears of interruption had never been realized, and no one\nimagined she was absent from her apartment two or three hours every day;\nshe pretended that her health was very uncertain; those who went to her\nroom always knocked before entering, and Malicorne, the man of so many\ningenious inventions, had constructed an acoustic piece of mechanism, by\nmeans of which La Valliere, when in Saint-Aignan's apartment, was\nalways forewarned of any visits which were paid to the room she usually\ninhabited. In this manner, therefore, without leaving her room, and\nhaving no _confidante_, she was able to return to her apartment, thus\nremoving by her appearance, a little tardy perhaps, the suspicions of\nthe most determined skeptics. Malicorne having asked Saint-Aignan the\nnext morning what news he had to report, the latter was obliged to\nconfess that the quarter of an hour's liberty had made the king in most\nexcellent humor. \"We must double the dose,\" replied Malicorne, \"but by\ninsensible degrees; wait until they seem to wish it.\"\n\nThey were so desirous for it, however, that on the evening of the fourth\nday, at the moment when the painter was packing up his implements,\nduring Saint-Aignan's continued absence, Saint-Aignan on his return\nnoticed upon La Valliere's face a shade of disappointment and vexation,\nwhich she could not conceal. The king was less reserved, and exhibited\nhis annoyance by a very significant shrug of the shoulders, at which La\nValliere could not help blushing. \"Very good!\" thought Saint-Aignan to\nhimself; \"M. Malicorne will be delighted this evening;\" as he, in fact,\nwas, when it was reported to him.\n\n\"It is very evident,\" he remarked to the comte, \"that Mademoiselle de la\nValliere hoped that you would be at least ten minutes later.\"\n\n\"And the king that I should be half an hour later, dear Monsieur\nMalicorne.\"\n\n\"You would show but very indifferent devotion to the king,\" replied\nthe latter, \"if you were to refuse his majesty that half-hour's\nsatisfaction.\"\n\n\"But the painter,\" objected Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"_I_ will take care of him,\" said Malicorne, \"only I must study faces\nand circumstances a little better before I act; those are my magical\ninventions and contrivances; and while sorcerers are enabled by means of\ntheir astrolabe to take the altitude of the sun, moon, and stars, I\nam satisfied merely by looking into people's faces, in order to see if\ntheir eyes are encircled with dark lines, and if the mouth describes a\nconvex or concave arc.\"\n\nAnd the cunning Malicorne had every opportunity of watching narrowly\nand closely, for the very same evening the king accompanied the queen\nto Madame's apartments, and made himself so remarked by his serious face\nand his deep sigh, and looked at La Valliere with such a languishing\nexpression, that Malicorne said to Montalais during the evening:\n\"To-morrow.\" And he went off to the painter's house in the street of\nthe Jardins Saint-Paul to request him to postpone the next sitting for\na couple of days. Saint-Aignan was not within, when La Valliere, who\nwas now quite familiar with the lower story, lifted up the trap-door and\ndescended. The king, as usual was waiting for her on the staircase,\nand held a bouquet in his hand; as soon as he saw her, he clasped her\ntenderly in his arms. La Valliere, much moved at the action, looked\naround the room, but as she saw the king was alone, she did not complain\nof it. They sat down, the king reclining near the cushions on which\nLouise was seated, with his head supported by her knees, placed there as\nin an asylum whence no one could banish him; he gazed ardently upon her,\nand as if the moment had arrived when nothing could interpose between\ntheir two hearts; she, too, gazed with similar passion upon him, and\nfrom her eyes, so softly pure, emanated a flame, whose rays first\nkindled and then inflamed the heart of the king, who, trembling with\nhappiness as Louise's hand rested on his head, grew giddy from excess\nof joy, and momentarily awaited either the painter's or Saint-Aignan's\nreturn to break the sweet illusion. But the door remained closed, and\nneither Saint-Aignan nor the painter appeared, nor did the hangings even\nmove. A deep mysterious silence reigned in the room--a silence which\nseemed to influence even the song-birds in their gilded prisons. The\nking, completely overcome, turned round his head and buried his burning\nlips in La Valliere's hands, who, herself faint, with excess of emotion,\npressed her trembling hands against her lover's lips. Louis threw\nhimself upon his knees, and as La Valliere did not move her head, the\nking's forehead being within reach of her lips, she furtively passed\nher lips across the perfumed locks which caressed her cheeks. The king\nseized her in his arms, and, unable to resist the temptation, they\nexchanged their first kiss, that burning kiss, which changes love into\ndelirium. Suddenly, a noise upon the upper floor was heard, which had,\nin fact, continued, though it had remained unnoticed, for some time; it\nhad at last aroused La Valliere's attention, though but slowly so. As\nthe noise, however, continued, as it forced itself upon the attention,\nand recalled the poor girl from her dreams of happiness to the sad\nrealities of life, she rose in a state of utter bewilderment, though\nbeautiful in her disorder, saying:\n\n\"Some one is waiting for me above. Louis, Louis, do you not hear?\"\n\n\"Well! and am I not waiting for you, also?\" said the king, with infinite\ntenderness of tone. \"Let others henceforth wait for you.\"\n\nBut she gently shook her head, as she replied: \"Happiness hidden...\npower concealed... my pride should be as silent as my heart.\"\n\nThe noise was again resumed.\n\n\"I hear Montalais's voice,\" she said, and she hurried up the staircase;\nthe king followed her, unable to let her leave his sight, and covering\nher hand with his kisses. \"Yes, yes,\" repeated La Valliere, who had\npassed half-way through the opening. \"Yes, it is Montalais who is\ncalling me; something important must have happened.\"\n\n\"Go then, dearest love,\" said the king, \"but return quickly.\"\n\n\"No, no, not to-day, sire! Adieu! adieu!\" she said, as she stooped down\nonce more to embrace her lover--and escaped. Montalais was, in fact,\nwaiting for her, very pale and agitated.\n\n\"Quick, quick! _he_ is coming,\" she said.\n\n\"Who--who is coming?\"\n\n\"Raoul,\" murmured Montalais.\n\n\"It is I--I,\" said a joyous voice, upon the last steps of the grand\nstaircase.\n\nLa Valliere uttered a terrible shriek and threw herself back.\n\n\"I am here, dear Louise,\" said Raoul, running towards her. \"I knew but\ntoo well that you had not ceased to love me.\"\n\nLa Valliere with a gesture, partly of extreme terror, and partly as if\ninvoking a blessing, attempted to speak, but could not articulate one\nword. \"No, no!\" she said, as she fell into Montalais's arms, murmuring,\n\"Do not touch me, do not come near me.\"\n\nMontalais made a sign to Raoul, who stood almost petrified at the door,\nand did not even attempt to advance another step into the room.\nThen, looking towards the side of the room where the screen was, she\nexclaimed: \"Imprudent girl, she has not even closed the trap-door.\"\n\nAnd she advanced towards the corner of the room to close the screen, and\nalso, behind the screen, the trap-door. But suddenly the king, who had\nheard Louise's exclamation, darted through the opening, and hurried\nforward to her assistance. He threw himself on his knees before her, as\nhe overwhelmed Montalais with questions, who hardly knew where she was.\nAt the moment, however, when the king threw himself on his knees, a cry\nof utter despair rang through the corridor, accompanied by the sound of\nretreating footsteps. The king wished to see who had uttered the cry and\nwhose were the footsteps he had heard; and it was in vain that Montalais\nsought to retain him, for Louis, quitting his hold of La Valliere,\nhurried towards the door, too late, however, for Raoul was already at a\ndistance, and the king only beheld a shadow that quickly vanished in the\nsilent corridor. [8]\n\n\n\nChapter XL: Two Old Friends.\n\nWhilst every one at court was busily engaged with his own affairs, a man\nmysteriously took up his post behind the Place de Greve, in the\nhouse which we once saw besieged by D'Artagnan on the occasion of the\n_emeute_. The principal entrance of the house was in the Place Baudoyer;\nit was tolerably large, surrounded by gardens, inclosed in the Rue\nSaint-Jean by the shops of toolmakers, which protected it from prying\nlooks, and was walled in by a triple rampart of stone, noise, and\nverdure, like an embalmed mummy in its triple coffin. The man we have\njust alluded to walked along with a firm step, although he was no longer\nin his early prime. His dark cloak and long sword plainly revealed\none who seemed in search of adventures; and, judging from his curling\nmustache, his fine smooth skin, which could be seen beneath his\n_sombrero_, it would not have been difficult to pronounce that gallantry\nhad not a little share in his adventures. In fact, hardly had the\ncavalier entered the house, when the clock struck eight; and ten minutes\nafterwards a lady, followed by a servant armed to the teeth, approached\nand knocked at the same door, which an old woman immediately opened for\nher. The lady raised her veil as she entered; though no longer beautiful\nor young, she was still active and of an imposing carriage. She\nconcealed, beneath a rich toilette and the most exquisite taste, an age\nwhich Ninon de l'Enclos alone could have smiled at with impunity. Hardly\nhad she reached the vestibule, when the cavalier, whose features we have\nonly roughly sketched, advanced towards her, holding out his hand.\n\n\"Good day, my dear duchesse,\" he said.\n\n\"How do you do, my dear Aramis?\" replied the duchesse.\n\nHe led her to a most elegantly furnished apartment, on whose high\nwindows were reflected the expiring rays of the setting sun, which\nfiltered gaudily through the dark green needles of the adjacent firs.\nThey sat down side by side. Neither of them thought of asking for\nadditional light in the room, and they buried themselves as it were in\nthe shadow, as if they wished to bury themselves in forgetfulness.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said the duchesse, \"you have never given me a single sign\nof life since our interview at Fontainebleau, and I confess that your\npresence there on the day of the Franciscan's death, and your initiation\nin certain secrets, caused me the liveliest astonishment I ever\nexperienced in my whole life.\"\n\n\"I can explain my presence there to you, as well as my initiation,\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"But let us, first of all,\" said the duchess, \"talk a little of\nourselves, for our friendship is by no means of recent date.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame: and if Heaven wills it, we shall continue to be friends, I\nwill not say for a long time, but forever.\"\n\n\"That is quite certain, chevalier, and my visit is a proof of it.\"\n\n\"Our interests, duchess, are no longer the same as they used to be,\"\nsaid Aramis, smiling without apprehension in the growing gloom by which\nthe room was overcast, for it could not reveal that his smile was less\nagreeable and not so bright as formerly.\n\n\"No, chevalier, at the present day we have other interests. Every\nperiod of life brings its own; and, as we now understand each other in\nconversing, as perfectly as we formerly did without saying a word, let\nus talk, if you like.\"\n\n\"I am at your orders, duchesse. Ah! I beg your pardon, how did you\nobtain my address, and what was your object?\"\n\n\"You ask me why? I have told you. Curiosity in the first place. I wished\nto know what you could have to do with the Franciscan, with whom I had\ncertain business transactions, and who died so singularly. You know that\non the occasion of our interview at Fontainebleau, in the cemetery, at\nthe foot of the grave so recently closed, we were both so much overcome\nby our emotions that we omitted to confide to each other what we may\nhave to say.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I had no sooner left you than I repented, and have ever\nsince been most anxious to ascertain the truth. You know that Madame de\nLongueville and myself are almost one, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I was not aware,\" said Aramis, discreetly.\n\n\"I remembered, therefore,\" continued the duchesse, \"that neither of us\nsaid anything to the other in the cemetery; that you did not speak of\nthe relationship in which you stood to the Franciscan, whose burial you\nsuperintended, and that I did not refer to the position in which I\nstood to him; all which seemed very unworthy of two such old friends as\nourselves, and I have sought an opportunity of an interview with you in\norder to give you some information that I have recently acquired, and to\nassure you that Marie Michon, now no more, has left behind her one who\nhas preserved her recollection of events.\"\n\nAramis bowed over the duchess's hand, and pressed his lips upon it. \"You\nmust have had some trouble to find me again,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, annoyed to find the subject taking a turn which\nAramis wished to give it; \"but I knew you were a friend of M. Fouquet's,\nand so I inquired in that direction.\"\n\n\"A friend! oh!\" exclaimed the chevalier, \"I can hardly pretend to be\n_that_. A poor priest who has been favored by a generous protector, and\nwhose heart is full of gratitude and devotion, is all that I pretend to\nbe to M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"He made you a bishop?\"\n\n\"Yes, duchesse.\"\n\n\"A very good retiring pension for so handsome a musketeer.\"\n\n\"Yes; in the same way that political intrigue is for yourself,\" thought\nAramis. \"And so,\" he added, \"you inquired after me at M. Fouquet's?\"\n\n\"Easily enough. You had been to Fontainebleau with him, and had\nundertaken a voyage to your diocese, which is Belle-Ile-en-Mer, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" said Aramis. \"My diocese is Vannes.\"\n\n\"I meant that. I only thought that Belle-Ile-en-Mer--\"\n\n\"Is a property belonging to M. Fouquet, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Ah! I had been told that Belle-Isle was fortified; besides, I know how\ngreat the military knowledge is you possess.\"\n\n\"I have forgotten everything of the kind since I entered the Church,\"\nsaid Aramis, annoyed.\n\n\"Suffice it to know that I learned you had returned from Vannes, and\nI sent off to one of our friends, M. le Comte de la Fere, who is\ndiscretion itself, in order to ascertain it, but he answered that he was\nnot aware of your address.\"\n\n\"So like Athos,\" thought the bishop; \"the really good man never\nchanges.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you know that I cannot venture to show myself here, and\nthat the queen-mother has always some grievance or other against me.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and I am surprised at it.\"\n\n\"Oh! there are various reasons for it. But, to continue, being obliged\nto conceal myself, I was fortunate enough to meet with M. d'Artagnan,\nwho was formerly one of your old friends, I believe?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine still, duchesse.\"\n\n\"He gave me certain information, and sent me to M. Baisemeaux, the\ngovernor of the Bastile.\"\n\nAramis was somewhat agitated at this remark, and a light flashed from\nhis eyes in the darkness of the room, which he could not conceal\nfrom his keen-sighted friend. \"M. de Baisemeaux!\" he said, \"why did\nD'Artagnan send you to M. de Baisemeaux?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"What can this possibly mean?\" said the bishop, summoning all the\nresources of his mind to his aid, in order to carry on the combat in a\nbefitting manner.\n\n\"M. de Baisemeaux is greatly indebted to you, D'Artagnan told me.\"\n\n\"True, he is so.\"\n\n\"And the address of a creditor is as easily ascertained as that of a\ndebtor.\"\n\n\"Very true; and so Baisemeaux indicated to you--\"\n\n\"Saint-Mande, where I forwarded a letter to you.\"\n\n\"Which I have in my hand, and which is most precious to me,\" said\nAramis, \"because I am indebted to it for the pleasure of seeing you\nhere.\" The duchesse, satisfied at having successfully overcome the\nvarious difficulties of so delicate an explanation, began to breathe\nfreely again, which Aramis, however, could not succeed in doing. \"We had\ngot as far as your visit to M. Baisemeaux, I believe?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, laughing, \"farther than that.\"\n\n\"In that case we must have been speaking about the grudge you have\nagainst the queen-mother.\"\n\n\"Further still,\" she returned, \"further still; we were talking of the\nconnection--\"\n\n\"Which existed between you and the Franciscan,\" said Aramis,\ninterrupting her eagerly, \"well, I am listening to you very\nattentively.\"\n\n\"It is easily explained,\" returned the duchesse. \"You know that I am\nliving at Brussels with M. de Laicques?\"\n\n\"I heard so.\"\n\n\"You know that my children have ruined and stripped me of everything.\"\n\n\"How terrible, dear duchesse.\"\n\n\"Terrible indeed; this obliged me to resort to some means of obtaining a\nlivelihood, and, particularly, to avoid vegetating for the remainder of\nmy existence. I had old hatreds to turn to account, old friendships to\nmake use of; I no longer had either credit or protectors.\"\n\n\"_You_, who had extended protection towards so many persons,\" said\nAramis, softly.\n\n\"It is always the case, chevalier. Well, at the present time I am in the\nhabit of seeing the king of Spain very frequently.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Who has just nominated a general of the Jesuits, according to the usual\ncustom.\"\n\n\"Is it usual, indeed?\"\n\n\"Were you not aware of it?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; I was inattentive.\"\n\n\"You must be aware of that--you who were on such good terms with the\nFranciscan.\"\n\n\"With the general of the Jesuits, you mean?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Well, then, I have seen the king of Spain, who wished to do\nme a service, but was unable. He gave me recommendations, however, to\nFlanders, both for myself and for Laicques too; and conferred a pension\non me out of the funds belonging to the order.\"\n\n\"Of Jesuits?\"\n\n\"Yes. The general--I mean the Franciscan--was sent to me; and, for the\npurpose of conforming with the requisitions of the statues of the order,\nand of entitling me to the pension, I was reputed to be in a position to\nrender certain services. You are aware that that is the rule?\"\n\n\"No, I did not know it,\" said Aramis.\n\nMadame de Chevreuse paused to look at Aramis, but it was perfectly dark.\n\"Well, such is the rule, however,\" she resumed. \"I had, therefore, to\nappear to possess a power of usefulness of some kind or other, and\nI proposed to travel for the order, and I was placed on the list of\naffiliated travelers. You understand it was a formality, by means of\nwhich I received my pension, which was very convenient for me.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! duchesse, what you tell me is like a dagger-thrust. _You_\nobliged to receive a pension from the Jesuits?\"\n\n\"No, chevalier! from Spain.\"\n\n\"Except for a conscientious scruple, duchesse, you will admit that it is\npretty nearly the same thing.\"\n\n\"No, not at all.\"\n\n\"But surely of your magnificent fortune there must remain--\"\n\n\"Dampierre is all that remains.\"\n\n\"And that is handsome enough.\"\n\n\"Yes; but Dampierre is burdened, mortgaged, and almost fallen to ruin,\nlike its owner.\"\n\n\"And can the queen-mother know and see all that, without shedding a\ntear?\" said Aramis, with a penetrating look, which encountered nothing\nbut darkness.\n\n\"Yes. She has forgotten everything.\"\n\n\"You, I believe, attempted to get restored to favor?\"\n\n\"Yes; but, most singularly, the young king inherits the antipathy his\ndear father had for me. You will, perhaps, tell me that I am indeed a\nwoman to be hated, and that I am no longer one who can be loved.\"\n\n\"Dear duchesse, pray come quickly to the cause that brought you here;\nfor I think we can be of service to each other.\"\n\n\"Such has been my own thought. I came to Fontainebleau with a double\nobject in view. In the first place, I was summoned there by the\nFranciscan whom you knew. By the by, how did you know him?--for I have\ntold you my story, and have not yet heard yours.\"\n\n\"I knew him in a very natural way, duchesse. I studied theology with him\nat Parma. We became fast friends; and it happened, from time to time,\nthat business, or travel, or war, separated us from each other.\"\n\n\"You were, of course, aware that he was the general of the Jesuits?\"\n\n\"I suspected it.\"\n\n\"But by what extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the\nhotel when the affiliated travelers met together?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Aramis, in a calm voice, \"it was the merest chance in the\nworld. I was going to Fontainebleau to see M. Fouquet, for the purpose\nof obtaining an audience of the king. I was passing by, unknown; I saw\nthe poor dying monk in the road, and recognized him immediately. You\nknow the rest--he died in my arms.\"\n\n\"Yes; but bequeathing to you so vast a power that you issue your\nsovereign orders and directions like a monarch.\"\n\n\"He certainly did leave me a few commissions to settle.\"\n\n\"And what for me?\"\n\n\"I have told you--a sum of twelve thousand livres was to be paid to\nyou. I thought I had given you the necessary signature to enable you to\nreceive it. Did you not get the money?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, yes. You give your orders, I am informed, with so much\nmystery, and such a majestic presence, that it is generally believed you\nare the successor of the defunct chief.\"\n\nAramis colored impatiently, and the duchesse continued: \"I have obtained\nmy information,\" she said, \"from the king of Spain himself; and he\ncleared up some of my doubts on the point. Every general of the Jesuits\nis nominated by him, and must be a Spaniard, according to the statutes\nof the order. You are not a Spaniard, nor have you been nominated by the\nking of Spain.\"\n\nAramis did not reply to this remark, except to say, \"You see, duchesse,\nhow greatly you were mistaken, since the king of Spain told you that.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear Aramis; but there was something else which I have been\nthinking of.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"You know, I believe, something about most things, and it occurred to me\nthat you know the Spanish language.\"\n\n\"Every Frenchman who has been actively engaged in the Fronde knows\nSpanish.\"\n\n\"You have lived in Flanders?\"\n\n\"Three years.\"\n\n\"And have stayed at Madrid?\"\n\n\"Fifteen months.\"\n\n\"You are in a position, then, to become a naturalized Spaniard, when you\nlike.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Aramis, with a frankness which deceived the duchesse.\n\n\"Undoubtedly. Two years' residence and an acquaintance with the language\nare indispensable. You have upwards of four years--more than double the\ntime necessary.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at, duchesse?\"\n\n\"At this--I am on good terms with the king of Spain.\"\n\n\"And I am not on bad terms,\" thought Aramis to himself.\n\n\"Shall I ask the king,\" continued the duchesse, \"to confer the\nsuccession to the Franciscan's post upon you?\"\n\n\"Oh, duchesse!\"\n\n\"You have it already, perhaps?\" she said.\n\n\"No, upon my honor.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I can render you that service.\"\n\n\"Why did you not render the same service to M. de Laicques, duchesse? He\nis a very talented man, and one you love, besides.\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt; but, at all events, putting Laicques aside, will you\nhave it?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you, duchesse.\"\n\nShe paused. \"He is nominated,\" she thought; and then resumed aloud,\n\"If you refuse me in this manner, it is not very encouraging for me,\nsupposing I should have something to ask of you.\"\n\n\"Oh! ask, pray, ask.\"\n\n\"Ask! I cannot do so, if you have not the power to grant what I want.\"\n\n\"However limited my power and ability, ask all the same.\"\n\n\"I need a sum of money, to restore Dampierre.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Aramis, coldly--\"money? Well, duchesse, how much would you\nrequire?\"\n\n\"Oh! a tolerably round sum.\"\n\n\"So much the worse--you know I am not rich.\"\n\n\"No, no; but the order is--and if you had been the general--\"\n\n\"You know I am not the general, I think.\"\n\n\"In that case, you have a friend who must be very wealthy--M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet! He is more than half ruined, madame.\"\n\n\"So it is said, but I did not believe it.\"\n\n\"Why, duchesse?\"\n\n\"Because I have, or rather Laicques has, certain letters in his\npossession from Cardinal Mazarin, which establish the existence of very\nstrange accounts.\"\n\n\"What accounts?\"\n\n\"Relative to various sums of money borrowed and disposed of. I cannot\nvery distinctly remember what they are; but they establish the fact\nthat the superintendent, according to these letters, which are signed by\nMazarin, had taken thirteen millions of francs from the coffers of the\nstate. The case is a very serious one.\"\n\nAramis clenched his hands in anxiety and apprehension. \"Is it possible,\"\nhe said, \"that you have such letters as you speak of, and have not\ncommunicated them to M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied the duchesse, \"I keep such trifling matters as these in\nreserve. The day may come when they will be of service; and they can be\nwithdrawn from the safe custody in which they now remain.\"\n\n\"And that day has arrived?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you are going to show those letters to M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"I prefer to talk about them with you, instead.\"\n\n\"You must be in sad want of money, my poor friend, to think of such\nthings as these--you, too, who held M. de Mazarin's prose effusions in\nsuch indifferent esteem.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I am in want of money.\"\n\n\"And then,\" continued Aramis, in cold accents, \"it must have been very\ndistressing to you to be obliged to have recourse to such a means. It is\ncruel.\"\n\n\"Oh! if had wished to do harm instead of good,\" said Madame de\nChevreuse, \"instead of asking the general of the order, or M. Fouquet,\nfor the five hundred thousand francs I require, I--\"\n\n\"_Five hundred thousand francs!_\"\n\n\"Yes; no more. Do you think it much? I require at least as much as that\nto restore Dampierre.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"I say, therefore, that instead of asking for this amount, I should\nhave gone to see my old friend the queen-mother; the letters from her\nhusband, Signor Mazarini, would have served me as an introduction, and\nI should have begged this mere trifle of her, saying to her, 'I wish,\nmadame, to have the honor of receiving you at Dampierre. Permit me to\nput Dampierre in a fit state for that purpose.'\"\n\nAramis did not return a single word. \"Well,\" she said, \"what are you\nthinking about?\"\n\n\"I am making certain additions,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"And M. Fouquet subtractions. I, on the other hand, am trying my hand at\nthe art of multiplication. What excellent calculators we all three are!\nHow well we might understand one another!\"\n\n\"Will you allow me to reflect?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"No, for with such an opening between people like ourselves, 'yes' or\n'no' is the only answer, and that an immediate one.\"\n\n\"It is a snare,\" thought the bishop; \"it is impossible that Anne of\nAustria would listen to such a woman as this.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said the duchesse.\n\n\"Well, madame, I should be very much astonished if M. Fouquet had five\nhundred thousand francs at his disposal at the present moment.\"\n\n\"It is no use speaking of it, then,\" said the duchesse, \"and Dampierre\nmust get restored how best it may.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are not embarrassed to such an extent as that, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No; I am never embarrassed.\"\n\n\"And the queen,\" continued the bishop, \"will certainly do for you what\nthe superintendent is unable to do?\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly. But tell me, do you think it would be better that I\nshould speak, myself, to M. Fouquet about these letters?\"\n\n\"Nay, duchesse, you will do precisely whatever you please in that\nrespect. M. Fouquet either feels or does not feel himself to be guilty;\nif he really be so, I know he is proud enough not to confess it; if he\nbe not so, he will be exceedingly offended at your menace.\"\n\n\"As usual, you reason like an angel,\" said the duchesse, as she rose\nfrom her seat.\n\n\"And so, you are now going to denounce M. Fouquet to the queen,\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"'Denounce!' Oh! what a disagreeable word. I shall not 'denounce' my\ndear friend; you know matters of policy too well to be ignorant how\neasily these affairs are arranged. I shall merely side against M.\nFouquet, and nothing more; and, in a war of party against party, a\nweapon is always a weapon.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"And once on friendly terms again with the queen-mother, I may be\ndangerous towards some persons.\"\n\n\"You are at liberty to prove so, duchesse.\"\n\n\"A liberty of which I shall avail myself.\"\n\n\"You are not ignorant, I suppose, duchesse, that M. Fouquet is on the\nbest terms with the king of Spain.\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"If, therefore, you begin a party warfare against M. Fouquet, he will\nreply in the same way; for he, too, is at perfect liberty to do so, is\nhe not?\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly.\"\n\n\"And as he is on good terms with Spain, he will make use of that\nfriendship as a weapon of attack.\"\n\n\"You mean, that he is, naturally, on good terms with the general of the\norder of the Jesuits, my dear Aramis.\"\n\n\"That may be the case, duchesse.\"\n\n\"And that, consequently, the pension I have been receiving from the\norder will be stopped.\"\n\n\"I am greatly afraid it might be.\"\n\n\"Well; I must contrive to console myself in the best way I can; for\nafter Richelieu, after the Fronde, after exile, what is there left for\nMadame de Chevreuse to be afraid of?\"\n\n\"The pension, you are aware, is forty-eight thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Alas! I am quite aware of it.\"\n\n\"Moreover, in party contests, you know, the friends of one's enemy do\nnot escape.\"\n\n\"Ah! you mean that poor Laicques will have to suffer.\"\n\n\"I am afraid it is almost inevitable, duchesse.\"\n\n\"Oh! he only receives twelve thousand francs pension.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the king of Spain has some influence left; advised by M.\nFouquet, he might get M. Laicques shut up in prison for a little while.\"\n\n\"I am not very nervous on that point, my dear friend; because, once\nreconciled with Anne of Austria, I will undertake that France would\ninsist upon M. Laicques's liberation.\"\n\n\"True. In that case, you will have something else to apprehend.\"\n\n\"What can that be?\" said the duchesse, pretending to be surprised and\nterrified.\n\n\"You will learn; indeed, you must know it already, that having once been\nan affiliated member of the order, it is not easy to leave it; for the\nsecrets that any particular member may have acquired are unwholesome,\nand carry with them the germs of misfortune for whosoever may reveal\nthem.\"\n\nThe duchesse paused and reflected for a moment, and then said, \"That is\nmore serious: I will think it over.\"\n\nAnd notwithstanding the profound obscurity, Aramis seemed to feel a\nbasilisk glance, like a white-hot iron, escape from his friend's eyes,\nand plunge into his heart.\n\n\"Let us recapitulate,\" said Aramis, determined to keep himself on\nhis guard, and gliding his hand into his breast where he had a dagger\nconcealed.\n\n\"Exactly, let us recapitulate; short accounts make long friends.\"\n\n\"The suppression of your pension--\"\n\n\"Forty-eight thousand francs, and that of Laicques's twelve, make\ntogether sixty thousand francs; that is what you mean, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Precisely; and I was trying to find out what would be your equivalent\nfor that.\"\n\n\"Five hundred thousand francs, which I shall get from the queen.\"\n\n\"Or, which you will _not_ get.\"\n\n\"I know a means of procuring them,\" said the duchesse, thoughtlessly.\n\nThis remark made the chevalier prick up his ears; and from the moment\nhis adversary had committed this error, his mind was so thoroughly on\nits guard, that he seemed every moment to gain the advantage more and\nmore; and she, consequently, to lose it. \"I will admit, for argument's\nsake, that you obtain the money,\" he resumed; \"you will lose twice as\nmuch, having a hundred thousand francs' pension to receive instead of\nsixty thousand, and that for a period of ten years.\"\n\n\"Not so, for I shall only be subjected to this reduction of my income\nduring the period of M. Fouquet's remaining in power, a period which I\nestimate at two months.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"I am frank, you see.\"\n\n\"I thank you for it, duchesse; but you would be wrong to suppose that\nafter M. Fouquet's disgrace the order would resume the payment of your\npension.\"\n\n\"I know a means of making the order pay, as I know a means of forcing\nthe queen-mother to concede what I require.\"\n\n\"In that case, duchesse, we are all obliged to strike our flags to you.\nThe victory is yours, and the triumph also. Be clement, I entreat you.\"\n\n\"But is it possible,\" resumed the duchesse, without taking notice of the\nirony, \"that you really draw back from a miserable sum of five hundred\nthousand francs, when it is a question of sparing you--I mean your\nfriend--I beg your pardon, I ought rather to say your protector--the\ndisagreeable consequences which a party contest produces?\"\n\n\"Duchesse, I tell you why; supposing the five hundred thousand francs\nwere to be given you, M. Laicques will require his share, which will be\nanother five hundred thousand francs, I presume? and then, after M. de\nLaicques's and your own portions have been arranged, the portions which\nyour children, your poor pensioners, and various other persons will\nrequire, will start up as fresh claims, and these letters, however\ncompromising they may be in their nature, are not worth from three\nto four millions. Can you have forgotten the queen of France's\ndiamonds?--they were surely worth more than these bits of waste paper\nsigned by Mazarin, and yet their recovery did not cost a fourth part of\nwhat you ask for yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true; but the merchant values his goods at his own price,\nand it is for the purchaser to buy or refuse.\"\n\n\"Stay a moment, duchesse; would you like me to tell you why I will not\nbuy your letters?\"\n\n\"Pray tell me.\"\n\n\"Because the letters you claim to be Mazarin's are false.\"\n\n\"What an absurdity.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it, for it would, to say the least, be very\nsingular, that after you had quarreled with the queen through M.\nMazarin's means, you should have kept up any intimate acquaintance with\nthe latter; it would look as if you had been acting as a spy; and upon\nmy word, I do not like to make use of the word.\"\n\n\"Oh! pray do.\"\n\n\"You great complacence would seem suspicions, at all events.\"\n\n\"That is quite true; but the contents of the letters are even more so.\"\n\n\"I pledge you my word, duchesse, that you will not be able to make use\nof it with the queen.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, indeed; I can make use of everything with the queen.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" thought Aramis. \"Croak on, old owl--hiss, beldame-viper.\"\n\nBut the duchesse had said enough, and advanced a few steps towards the\ndoor. Aramis, however, had reserved one exposure which she did _not_\nexpect.\n\nHe rang the bell, candles immediately appeared in the adjoining room,\nand the bishop found himself completely encircled by lights, which shone\nupon the worn, haggard face of the duchesse, revealing every feature\nbut too clearly. Aramis fixed a long ironical look upon her pale, thin,\nwithered cheeks--her dim, dull eyes--and upon her lips, which she kept\ncarefully closed over her discolored scanty teeth. He, however,\nhad thrown himself into a graceful attitude, with his haughty and\nintelligent head thrown back; he smiled so as to reveal teeth still\nbrilliant and dazzling. The antiquated coquette understood the trick\nthat had been played her. She was standing immediately before a large\nmirror, in which her decrepitude, so carefully concealed, was only made\nmore manifest. And, thereupon, without even saluting Aramis, who bowed\nwith the ease and grace of the musketeer of early days, she hurried\naway with trembling steps, which her very precipitation only the more\nimpeded. Aramis sprang across the room, like a zephyr, to lead her to\nthe door. Madame de Chevreuse made a sign to her servant, who resumed\nhis musket, and she left the house where such tender friends had not\nbeen able to understand each other only because they had understood each\nother too well.\n\n\n\nChapter XLI. Wherein May Be Seen that a Bargain Which Cannot Be Made\nwith One Person, Can Be Carried Out with Another.\n\nAramis had been perfectly correct in his supposition; for hardly had she\nleft the house in the Place Baudoyer than Madame de Chevreuse proceeded\nhomeward. She was doubtless afraid of being followed, and by this means\nthought she might succeed in throwing those who might be following her\noff their guard; but scarcely had she arrived within the door of the\nhotel, and hardly had assured herself that no one who could cause her\nany uneasiness was on her track, when she opened the door of the garden,\nleading into another street, and hurried towards the Rue Croix des\nPetits-Champs, where M. Colbert resided.\n\nWe have already said that evening, or rather night, had closed in; it\nwas a dark, thick night, besides; Paris had once more sunk into its\ncalm, quiescent state, enshrouding alike within its indulgent mantle the\nhigh-born duchesse carrying out her political intrigue, and the simple\ncitizen's wife, who, having been detained late by a supper in the city,\nwas making her way slowly homewards, hanging on the arm of a lover,\nby the shortest possible route. Madame de Chevreuse had been too well\naccustomed to nocturnal political intrigues to be ignorant that a\nminister never denies himself, even at his own private residence, to\nany young and beautiful woman who may chance to object to the dust and\nconfusion of a public office, or to old women, as full of experience\nas of years, who dislike the indiscreet echo of official residences. A\nvalet received the duchesse under the peristyle, and received her, it\nmust be admitted, with some indifference of manner; he intimated, after\nhaving looked at her face, that it was hardly at such an hour that one\nso advanced in years as herself could be permitted to disturb Monsieur\nColbert's important occupations. But Madame de Chevreuse, without\nlooking or appearing to be annoyed, wrote her name upon a leaf of her\ntablets--a name which had but too frequently sounded so disagreeably in\nthe ears of Louis XIII. and of the great cardinal. She wrote her name in\nthe large, ill-formed characters of the higher classes of that period,\nhanded it to the valet, without uttering a word, but with so haughty and\nimperious a gesture, that the fellow, well accustomed to judge of people\nfrom their manners and appearance, perceived at once the quality of the\nperson before him, bowed his head, and ran to M. Colbert's room. The\nminister could not control a sudden exclamation as he opened the paper;\nand the valet, gathering from it the interest with which his master\nregarded the mysterious visitor, returned as fast as he could to beg the\nduchesse to follow him. She ascended to the first floor of the beautiful\nnew house very slowly, rested herself on the landing-place, in order not\nto enter the apartment out of breath, and appeared before M. Colbert,\nwho, with his own hands, held both the folding doors open. The duchesse\npaused at the threshold, for the purpose of well studying the character\nof the man with whom she was about to converse. At the first glance,\nthe round, large, heavy head, thick brows, and ill-favored features of\nColbert, who wore, thrust low down on his head, a cap like a priest's\n_calotte_, seemed to indicate that but little difficulty was likely\nto be met with in her negotiations with him, but also that she was to\nexpect as little interest in the discussion of particulars; for there\nwas scarcely any indication that the rough and uncouth nature of the man\nwas susceptible to the impulses of a refined revenge, or of an exalted\nambition. But when, on closer inspection, the duchesse perceived the\nsmall, piercingly black eyes, the longitudinal wrinkles of his high and\nmassive forehead, the imperceptible twitching of the lips, on which were\napparent traces of rough good-humor, Madame de Chevreuse altered her\nopinion of him, and felt she could say to herself: \"I have found the man\nI want.\"\n\n\"What is the subject, madame, which procures me the honor of a visit\nfrom you?\" he inquired.\n\n\"The need I have of you, monsieur,\" returned the duchesse, \"as well\nas that which you have of me.\"\n\n\"I am delighted, madame, with the first portion of your sentence; but,\nas far as the second portion is concerned--\"\n\nMadame de Chevreuse sat down in the armchair which M. Colbert advanced\ntowards her. \"Monsieur Colbert, you are the intendant of finances, and\nare ambitious of becoming the superintendent?\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Nay, do not deny it; that would only unnecessarily prolong our\nconversation, and that is useless.\"\n\n\"And yet, madame, however well-disposed and inclined to show politeness\nI may be towards a lady of your position and merit, nothing will make\nme confess that I have ever entertained the idea of supplanting my\nsuperior.\"\n\n\"I said nothing about supplanting, Monsieur Colbert. Could I\naccidentally have made use of that word? I hardly think that likely.\nThe word 'replace' is less aggressive in its signification, and\nmore grammatically suitable, as M. de Voiture would say. I presume,\ntherefore, that you are ambitious of replacing M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet's fortune, madame, enables him to withstand all attempts.\nThe superintendent in this age plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes;\nthe vessels pass beneath him and do not overthrow him.\"\n\n\"I ought to have availed myself precisely of that very comparison. It\nis true, M. Fouquet plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes; but I\nremember to have heard it said by M. Conrart, a member of the academy, I\nbelieve, that when the Colossus of Rhodes fell from its lofty position,\nthe merchant who had cast it down--a merchant, nothing more, M.\nColbert--loaded four hundred camels with the ruins. A merchant! and that\nis considerably less than an intendant of finances.\"\n\n\"Madame, I can assure you that I shall never overthrow M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Very good, Monsieur Colbert, since you persist in showing so much\nsensitiveness with me, as if you were ignorant that I am Madame de\nChevreuse, and also that I am somewhat advanced in years; in other\nwords, that you have to do with a woman who has had political dealings\nwith the Cardinal Richelieu, and who has no time to lose; as, I repeat,\nyou do not hesitate to commit such an imprudence, I shall go and find\nothers who are more intelligent and more desirous of making their\nfortunes.\"\n\n\"How, madame, how?\"\n\n\"You give me a very poor idea of negotiations of the present day.\nI assure you that if, in my earlier days, a woman had gone to M.\nde Cinq-Mars, who was not, moreover, a man of a very high order of\nintellect, and had said to him about the cardinal what I have just said\nto you of M. Fouquet, M. de Cinq-Mars would by this time have already\nset actively to work.\"\n\n\"Nay, madame, show a little indulgence, I entreat you.\"\n\n\"Well, then, do you really consent to replace M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I do, if the king dismisses M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Again, a word too much; it is quite evident that, if you have not yet\nsucceeded in driving M. Fouquet from his post, it is because you have\nnot been able to do so. Therefore, I should be the greatest simpleton\npossible if, in coming to you, I did not bring the very thing you\nrequire.\"\n\n\"I am distressed to be obliged to persist, madame,\" said Colbert,\nafter a silence which enabled the duchesse to sound the depths of\nhis dissimulation, \"but I must warn you that, for the last six years,\ndenunciation after denunciation has been made against M. Fouquet, and he\nhas remained unshaken and unaffected by them.\"\n\n\"There is a time for everything, Monsieur Colbert; those who were the\nauthors of those denunciations were not called Madame de Chevreuse, and\nthey had no proofs equal to the six letters from M. de Mazarin which\nestablish the offense in question.\"\n\n\"The offense!\"\n\n\"The crime, if you like it better.\"\n\n\"The crime! committed by M. Fouquet!\"\n\n\"Nothing less. It is rather strange, M. Colbert, but your face, which\njust now was cold and indifferent, is now positively the very reverse.\"\n\n\"A crime!\"\n\n\"I am delighted to see that it makes an impression upon you.\"\n\n\"It is because that word, madame, embraces so many things.\"\n\n\"It embraces the post of superintendent of finance for yourself, and a\nletter of exile, or the Bastile, for M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, madame la duchesse, but it is almost impossible that M.\nFouquet can be exiled; to be imprisoned or disgraced, that is already a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am perfectly aware of what I am saying,\" returned Madame de\nChevreuse, coldly. \"I do not live at such a distance from Paris as not\nto know what takes place there. The king does not like M. Fouquet, and\nhe would willingly sacrifice M. Fouquet if an opportunity were only\ngiven him.\"\n\n\"It must be a good one, though.\"\n\n\"Good enough, and one I estimate to be worth five hundred thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\n\"In what way?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"I mean, monsieur, that holding this opportunity in my own hands, I will\nnot allow it to be transferred to yours except for a sum of five hundred\nthousand francs.\"\n\n\"I understand you perfectly, madame. But since you have fixed a price\nfor the sale, let me now see the value of the articles to be sold.\"\n\n\"Oh, a mere trifle; six letters, as I have already told you, from M. de\nMazarin; and the autographs will most assuredly not be regarded as too\nhighly priced, if they establish, in an irrefutable manner, that\nM. Fouquet has embezzled large sums of money from the treasury and\nappropriated them to his own purposes.\"\n\n\"In an irrefutable manner, do you say?\" observed Colbert, whose eyes\nsparkled with delight.\n\n\"Perfectly so; would you like to read the letters?\"\n\n\"With all my heart! Copies, of course?\"\n\n\"Of course, the copies,\" said the duchesse, as she drew from her bosom a\nsmall packet of papers flattened by her velvet bodice. \"Read,\" she said.\n\nColbert eagerly snatched the papers and devoured them. \"Excellent!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"It is clear enough, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, yes; M. Mazarin must have handed the money to M. Fouquet,\nwho must have kept it for his own purposes; but the question is, what\nmoney?\"\n\n\"Exactly,--what money; if we come to terms I will join to these six\nletters a seventh, which will supply you with the fullest particulars.\"\n\nColbert reflected. \"And the originals of these letters?\"\n\n\"A useless question to ask; exactly as if I were to ask you, Monsieur\nColbert, whether the money-bags you will give me will be full or empty.\"\n\n\"Very good, madame.\"\n\n\"Is it concluded?\"\n\n\"No; for there is one circumstance to which neither of us has given any\nattention.\"\n\n\"Name it!\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet can be utterly ruined, under the legal circumstances you\nhave detailed, only by means of legal proceedings.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"A public scandal, for instance; and yet neither the legal proceedings\nnor the scandal can be commenced against him.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he is procureur-general of the parliament; because, too,\nin France, all public administrators, the army, justice itself, and\ncommerce, are intimately connected by ties of good-fellowship, which\npeople call _esprit de corps_. In such a case, madame, the parliament\nwill never permit its chief to be dragged before a public tribunal; and\nnever, even if he be dragged there by royal authority, never, I say,\nwill he be condemned.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Colbert, I do not see what I have to do with that.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that, madame; but I have to do with it, and it\nconsequently diminishes the value of what you have brought to show me.\nWhat good can a proof of a crime be to me, without the possibility of\nobtaining a condemnation?\"\n\n\"Even if he be only suspected, M. Fouquet will lose his post of\nsuperintendent.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" exclaimed Colbert, whose dark, gloomy features were\nmomentarily lighted up by an expression of hate and vengeance.\n\n\"Ah! ah! Monsieur Colbert,\" said the duchesse, \"forgive me, but I did\nnot think you were so impressionable. Very good; in that case, since you\nneed more than I have to give you, there is no occasion to speak of the\nmatter at all.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, we will go on talking of it; only, as the value of your\ncommodities had decreased, you must lower your pretensions.\"\n\n\"You are bargaining, then?\"\n\n\"Every man who wishes to deal loyally is obliged to do so.\"\n\n\"How much will you offer me?\"\n\n\"Two hundred thousand francs,\" said Colbert.\n\nThe duchesse laughed in his face, and then said, suddenly, \"Wait a\nmoment, I have another arrangement to propose; will you give me three\nhundred thousand francs?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Oh, you can either accept or refuse my terms; besides, that is not\nall.\"\n\n\"More still! you are becoming too impracticable to deal with, madame.\"\n\n\"Less so than you think, perhaps, for it is not money I am going to ask\nyou for.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"A service; you know that I have always been most affectionately\nattached to the queen, and I am desirous of having an interview with her\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"With the queen?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Colbert, with the queen, who is, I admit, no longer my\nfriend, and who has ceased to be so for a long time past, but who may\nagain become so if the opportunity be only given her.\"\n\n\"Her majesty has ceased to receive any one, madame. She is a great\nsufferer, and you may be aware that the paroxysms of her disease occur\nwith greater frequency than ever.\"\n\n\"That is the very reason why I wish to have an interview with her\nmajesty; for in Flanders there is a great variety of these kinds of\ncomplaints.\"\n\n\"What, cancers--a fearful, incurable disorder?\"\n\n\"Do not believe that, Monsieur Colbert. The Flemish peasant is somewhat\na man of nature, and his companion for life is not alone a wife, but a\nfemale laborer also; for while he is smoking his pipe, the woman works:\nit is she who draws the water from the well; she who loads the mule\nor the ass, and even bears herself a portion of the burden. Taking but\nlittle care of herself, she gets knocked about first in one direction,\nand then in another, and very often is beaten by her husband, and\ncancers frequently rise from contusions.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" said Colbert.\n\n\"The Flemish women do not die the sooner on that account. When they are\ngreat sufferers from this disease they go in search of remedies, and the\nBeguines of Bruges are excellent doctors for every kind of disease. They\nhave precious waters of one sort or another; specifics of various kinds;\nand they give a bottle of it and a wax candle to the sufferer, whereby\nthe priests are gainers, and Heaven is served by the disposal of both\ntheir wares. I will take the queen some of this holy water, which I will\nprocure from the Beguines of Bruges; her majesty will recover, and will\nburn as many wax candles as she may see fit. You see, Monsieur Colbert,\nto prevent my seeing the queen is almost as bad as committing the crime\nof regicide.\"\n\n\"You are undoubtedly, madame la duchesse, a woman of exceedingly great\nabilities, and I am more than astounded at their display; still I cannot\nbut suppose that this charitable consideration towards the queen in some\nmeasure covers a slight personal interest for yourself.\"\n\n\"I have not given myself the trouble to conceal it, that I am aware\nof, Monsieur Colbert. You said, I believe, that I had a slight personal\ninterest? On the contrary, it is a very great interest, and I will prove\nit to you, by resuming what I was saying. If you procure me a personal\ninterview with her majesty, I will be satisfied with the three hundred\nthousand francs I have claimed; if not, I shall keep my letters, unless,\nindeed, you give me, on the spot, five hundred thousand francs.\"\n\nAnd rising from her seat with this decisive remark, the old duchesse\nplunged M. Colbert into a disagreeable perplexity. To bargain any\nfurther was out of the question; and not to bargain was to pay a great\ndeal too dearly for them. \"Madame,\" he said, \"I shall have the pleasure\nof handing over a hundred thousand crowns; but how shall I get the\nactual letters themselves?\"\n\n\"In the simplest manner in the world, my dear Monsieur Colbert--whom\nwill you trust?\"\n\nThe financier began to laugh, silently, so that his large eyebrows went\nup and down like the wings of a bat, upon the deep lines of his yellow\nforehead. \"No one,\" he said.\n\n\"You surely will make an exception in your own favor, Monsieur Colbert?\"\n\n\"In what way, madame?\"\n\n\"I mean that, if you would take the trouble to accompany me to the place\nwhere the letters are, they would be delivered into your own hands, and\nyou would be able to verify and check them.\"\n\n\"Quite true.\"\n\n\"You would bring the hundred thousand crowns with you at the same time,\nfor I, too, do not trust any one.\"\n\nColbert colored to the tips of his ears. Like all eminent men in the art\nof figures, he was of an insolent and mathematical probity. \"I will\ntake with me, madame,\" he said, \"two orders for the amount agreed upon,\npayable at my treasury. Will that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Would that the orders on your treasury were for two millions, monsieur\nl'intendant! I shall have the pleasure of showing you the way, then?\"\n\n\"Allow me to order my carriage?\"\n\n\"I have a carriage below, monsieur.\"\n\nColbert coughed like an irresolute man. He imagined, for a moment, that\nthe proposition of the duchesse was a snare; that perhaps some one was\nwaiting at the door; and that she whose secret had just been sold to\nColbert for a hundred thousand crowns, had already offered it to Fouquet\nfor the same sum. As he still hesitated, the duchesse looked at him full\nin the face.\n\n\"You prefer your own carriage?\" she said.\n\n\"I admit I _do_.\"\n\n\"You suppose I am going to lead you into a snare or trap of some sort or\nother?\"\n\n\"Madame la duchesse, you have the character of being somewhat\ninconsiderate at times, as I am reputed a sober, solemn character, a\njest or practical joke might compromise me.\"\n\n\"Yes; the fact is, you are afraid. Well, then, take your own carriage,\nas many servants as you like, only think well of what I am going to say.\nWhat we two may arrange between ourselves, we are the only persons who\nwill know--if a third person is present we might as well tell the whole\nworld about it. After all, I do not make a point of it; my carriage\nshall follow yours, and I shall be satisfied to accompany you in your\nown carriage to the queen.\"\n\n\"To the queen?\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten that already? Is it possible that one of the clauses\nof the agreement of so much importance to me, can have escaped you so\nsoon? How trifling it seems to you, indeed; if I had known it I should\nhave asked double what I have done.\"\n\n\"I have reflected, madame, and I shall not accompany you.\"\n\n\"Really--and why not?\"\n\n\"Because I have the most perfect confidence in you.\"\n\n\"You overpower me. But--provided I receive the hundred thousand crowns?\"\n\n\"Here they are, madame,\" said Colbert, scribbling a few lines on a piece\nof paper, which he handed to the duchesse, adding, \"You are paid.\"\n\n\"The trait is a fine one, Monsieur Colbert, and I will reward you for\nit,\" she said, beginning to laugh.\n\nMadame de Chevreuse's laugh was a very sinister sound; a man with youth,\nfaith, love, life itself, throbbing in his heart, would prefer a sob to\nsuch a lamentable laugh. The duchesse opened the front of her dress and\ndrew forth from her bosom, somewhat less white than it once had been,\na small packet of papers, tied with a flame-colored ribbon, and, still\nlaughing, she said, \"There, Monsieur Colbert, are the originals of\nCardinal Mazarin's letters; they are now your own property,\" she added,\nrefastening the body of her dress; \"your fortune is secured. And now\naccompany me to the queen.\"\n\n\"No, madame; if you are again about to run the chance of her majesty's\ndispleasure, and it were known at the Palais Royal that I had been the\nmeans of introducing you there, the queen would never forgive me while\nshe lived. No; there are certain persons at the palace who are devoted\nto me, who will procure you an admission without my being compromised.\"\n\n\"Just as you please, provided I enter.\"\n\n\"What do you term those religious women at Bruges who cure disorders?\"\n\n\"Beguines.\"\n\n\"Good; are you one?\"\n\n\"As you please,--but I must soon cease to be one.\"\n\n\"That is your affair.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but I do not wish to be exposed to a refusal.\"\n\n\"That is again your own affair, madame. I am going to give directions\nto the head valet of the gentleman in waiting on the queen to allow\nadmission to a Beguine, who brings an effectual remedy for her majesty's\nsufferings. You are the bearer of my letter, you will undertake to\nbe provided with the remedy, and will give every explanation on the\nsubject. I admit a knowledge of a Beguine, but I deny all knowledge\nof Madame de Chevreuse. Here, madame, then, is your letter of\nintroduction.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLII. The Skin of the Bear.\n\nColbert handed the duchesse the letter, and gently drew aside the chair\nbehind which she was standing; Madame de Chevreuse, with a very slight\nbow, immediately left the room. Colbert, who had recognized Mazarin's\nhandwriting, and had counted the letters, rang to summon his secretary,\nwhom he enjoined to go in immediate search of M. Vanel, a counselor\nof the parliament. The secretary replied that, according to his usual\npractice, M. Vanel had just that moment entered the house, in order to\ngive the intendant an account of the principal details of the business\nwhich had been transacted during the day in parliament. Colbert\napproached one of the lamps, read the letters of the deceased cardinal\nover again, smiled repeatedly as he recognized the great value of the\npapers Madame de Chevreuse had just delivered--and burying his head in\nhis hands for a few minutes, reflected profoundly. In the meantime, a\ntall, loosely-made man entered the room; his spare, thin face, steady\nlook, and hooked nose, as he entered Colbert's cabinet, with a\nmodest assurance of manner, revealed a character at once supple and\ndecided,--supple towards the master who could throw him the prey,\nfirm towards the dogs who might possibly be disposed to dispute its\npossession. M. Vanel carried a voluminous bundle of papers under his\narm, and placed it on the desk on which Colbert was leaning both his\nelbows, as he supported his head.\n\n\"Good day, M. Vanel,\" said the latter, rousing himself from his\nmeditation.\n\n\"Good day, monseigneur,\" said Vanel, naturally.\n\n\"You should say monsieur, and not monseigneur,\" replied Colbert, gently.\n\n\"We give the title of monseigneur to ministers,\" returned Vanel, with\nextreme self-possession, \"and you are a minister.\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"You are so in point of fact, and I call you monseigneur accordingly;\nbesides you are seigneur for _me_, and that is sufficient; if you\ndislike my calling you monseigneur before others, allow me, at least, to\ncall you so in private.\"\n\nColbert raised his head as if to read, or try to read, upon Vanel's\nface how much or how little sincerity entered into this protestation\nof devotion. But the counselor knew perfectly well how to sustain the\nweight of such a look, even backed with the full authority of the title\nhe had conferred. Colbert sighed; he could not read anything in Vanel's\nface, and Vanel might possibly be honest in his professions, but Colbert\nrecollected that this man, inferior to himself in every other respect,\nwas actually his master in virtue of the fact of his having a wife.\nAs he was pitying this man's lot, Vanel coldly drew from his pocket a\nperfumed letter, sealed with Spanish wax, and held it towards Colbert,\nsaying, \"A letter from my wife, monseigneur.\"\n\nColbert coughed, took, opened and read the letter, and then put it\ncarefully away in his pocket, while Vanel turned over the leaves of\nthe papers he had brought with him with an unmoved and unconcerned air.\n\"Vanel,\" he said suddenly to his _protege_, \"you are a hard-working man,\nI know; would twelve hours' daily labor frighten you?\"\n\n\"I work fifteen hours every day.\"\n\n\"Impossible. A counselor need not work more than three hours a day in\nparliament.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am working up some returns for a friend of mine in the department\nof accounts, and, as I still have spare time on my hands, I am studying\nHebrew.\"\n\n\"Your reputation stands high in the parliament, Vanel.\"\n\n\"I believe so, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"You must not grow rusty in your post of counselor.\"\n\n\"What must I do to avoid it?\"\n\n\"Purchase a high place. Mean and low ambitions are very difficult to\nsatisfy.\"\n\n\"Small purses are the most difficult ones to fill, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What post have you in view?\" said Colbert.\n\n\"I see none--not one.\"\n\n\"There is one, certainly, but one need be almost the king himself to be\nable to buy it without inconvenience; and the king will not be inclined,\nI suppose, to purchase the post of procureur-general.\"\n\nAt these words, Vanel fixed his peculiar, humble, dull look upon\nColbert, who could hardly tell whether Vanel comprehended him or not.\n\"Why do you speak to me, monseigneur,\" said Vanel, \"of the post of\nprocureur-general to the parliament; I know no other post than the one\nM. Fouquet fills.\"\n\n\"Exactly so, my dear counselor.\"\n\n\"You are not over fastidious, monseigneur; but before the post can be\nbought, it must be offered for sale.\"\n\n\"I believe, Monsieur Vanel, that it will be for sale before long.\"\n\n\"For sale! What! M. Fouquet's post of procureur-general?\"\n\n\"So it is _said_.\"\n\n\"The post which renders him so perfectly invincible, for sale! Ha, ha!\"\nsaid Vanel, beginning to laugh.\n\n\"Would you be afraid, then, of the post?\" said Colbert, gravely.\n\n\"Afraid! no; but--\"\n\n\"Are you desirous of obtaining it?\"\n\n\"You are laughing at me, monseigneur,\" replied Vanel. \"Is it likely\nthat a counselor of the parliament would not be desirous of becoming\nprocureur-general?\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Vanel, since I tell you that the post, as report goes,\nwill be shortly for sale--\"\n\n\"I cannot help repeating, monseigneur, that it is impossible; a man\nnever throws away the buckler, behind which he maintains his honor, his\nfortune, his very life.\"\n\n\"There are certain men mad enough, Vanel, to fancy themselves out of the\nreach of all mischances.\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; but such men never commit their mad acts for the\nadvantage of the poor Vanels of the world.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"For the very reason that those Vanels are poor.\"\n\n\"It is true that M. Fouquet's post might cost a good round sum. What\nwould you bid for it, Monsieur Vanel?\"\n\n\"Everything I am worth.\"\n\n\"Which means?\"\n\n\"Three or four hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"And the post is worth--\"\n\n\"A million and a half, at the very lowest. I know persons who have\noffered one million seven hundred thousand francs, without being able to\npersuade M. Fouquet to sell. Besides, supposing it were to happen that\nM. Fouquet wished to sell, which I do not believe, in spite of what I\nhave been told--\"\n\n\"Ah! you have heard something about it, then; who told you?\"\n\n\"M. de Gourville, M. Pelisson, and others.\"\n\n\"Very good; if, therefore, M. Fouquet did wish to sell--\"\n\n\"I could not buy it just yet, since the superintendent will only sell\nfor ready money, and no one has a million and a half to put down at\nonce.\"\n\nColbert suddenly interrupted the counselor by an imperious gesture; he\nhad begun to meditate. Observing his superior's serious attitude, and\nhis perseverance in continuing the conversation on this subject, Vanel\nawaited the solution without venturing to precipitate it.\n\n\"Explain to me the privileges which this post confers.\"\n\n\"The right of impeaching every French subject who is not a prince of\nthe blood; the right of quashing all proceedings taken against any\nFrenchman, who is neither king nor prince. The procureur-general is the\nking's right hand to punish the guilty; the office is the means whereby\nalso he can evade the administration of justice. M. Fouquet, therefore,\nwould be able, by stirring up parliament, to maintain himself even\nagainst the king; and the king could as easily, by humoring M. Fouquet,\nget his edicts registered in spite of every opposition and objection.\nThe procureur-general can be made a very useful or a very dangerous\ninstrument.\"\n\n\"Vanel, would you like to be procureur-general?\" said Colbert, suddenly,\nsoftening both his look and his voice.\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed the latter; \"I have already had the honor to represent\nto you that I want about eleven hundred thousand francs to make up the\namount.\"\n\n\"Borrow that sum from your friends.\"\n\n\"I have no friends richer than myself.\"\n\n\"You are an honest and honorable man, Vanel.\"\n\n\"Ah! monseigneur, if the world would only think as you do!\"\n\n\"I think so, and that is quite enough; and if it should be needed, I\nwill be your security.\"\n\n\"Do not forget the proverb, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That he who becomes responsible for another has to pay for his fancy.\"\n\n\"Let that make no difference.\"\n\nVanel rose, bewildered by this offer which had been so suddenly and\nunexpectedly made to him. \"You are not trifling with me, monseigneur?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Stay; you say that M. Gourville has spoken to you about M. Fouquet's\npost?\"\n\n\"Yes; and M. Pelisson, also.\"\n\n\"Officially so, or only through their own suggestion?\"\n\n\"These were their very words: 'The parliament members are as proud as\nthey are wealthy; they ought to club together two or three millions\namong themselves, to present to their protector and leader, M.\nFouquet.'\"\n\n\"And what did you reply?\"\n\n\"I said that, for my own part, I would give ten thousand francs if\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"Ah! you like M. Fouquet, then!\" exclaimed Colbert, with a look of\nhatred.\n\n\"No; but M. Fouquet is our chief. He is in debt--is on the high road\nto ruin; and we ought to save the honor of the body of which we are\nmembers.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and that explains why M. Fouquet will be always safe and\nsound, so long as he occupies his present post,\" replied Colbert.\n\n\"Thereupon,\" said Vanel, \"M. Gourville added, 'If we were to do anything\nout of charity to M. Fouquet, it could not be otherwise than most\nhumiliating to him; and he would be sure to refuse it. Let the\nparliament subscribe among themselves to purchase, in a proper manner,\nthe post of procureur-general; in that case, all would go well; the\nhonor of our body would be saved, and M. Fouquet's pride spared.'\"\n\n\"That is an opening.\"\n\n\"I considered it so, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Vanel, you will go at once, and find out either M.\nGourville or M. Pelisson. Do you know any other friend of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"I know M. de la Fontaine very well.\"\n\n\"La Fontaine, the rhymester?\"\n\n\"Yes; he used to write verses to my wife, when M. Fouquet was one of our\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Go to him, then, and try and procure an interview with the\nsuperintendent.\"\n\n\"Willingly--but the sum itself?\"\n\n\"On the day and hour you arrange to settle the matter, Monsieur Vanel,\nyou shall be supplied with the money, so do not make yourself uneasy on\n_that_ account.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, such munificence! You eclipse kings even--you surpass M.\nFouquet himself.\"\n\n\"Stay a moment--do not let us mistake each other: I do not make you a\npresent of fourteen hundred thousand francs, Monsieur Vanel; for I have\nchildren to provide for--but I will _lend_ you that sum.\"\n\n\"Ask whatever interest, whatever security you please, monseigneur; I am\nquite ready. And when all your requisitions are satisfied, I will still\nrepeat, that you surpass kings and M. Fouquet in munificence. What\nconditions do you impose?\"\n\n\"The repayment in eight years, and a mortgage upon the appointment\nitself.\"\n\n\"Certainly. Is that all?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment. I reserve to myself the right of purchasing the post\nfrom you at one hundred and fifty thousand francs profit for yourself,\nif, in your mode of filling the office, you do not follow out a line\nof conduct in conformity with the interests of the king and with my\nprojects.\"\n\n\"Ah-h!\" said Vanel, in an altered tone.\n\n\"Is there anything in that which can possibly be objectionable to you,\nMonsieur Vanel?\" said Colbert, coldly.\n\n\"Oh! no, no,\" replied Vanel, nervously.\n\n\"Very good. We will sign an agreement to that effect whenever you like.\nAnd now go as quickly as you can to M. Fouquet's friend, obtain an\ninterview with the superintendent; do not be too difficult in making\nwhatever concessions may be required of you; and when once the\narrangements are all made--\"\n\n\"I will press him to sign.\"\n\n\"Be most careful to do nothing of the kind; do not speak of signatures\nwith M. Fouquet, nor of deeds, nor even ask him to pass his word.\nUnderstand this: otherwise you will lose everything. All you have to do\nis to get M. Fouquet to give you his hand on the matter. Go, go.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLIII. An Interview with the Queen-Mother.\n\nThe queen-mother was in the bedroom at the Palais Royal, with Madame\nde Motteville and Senora Molina. King Louis, who had been impatiently\nexpected the whole day, had not made his appearance; and the queen, who\nwas growing impatient, had often sent to inquire about him. The moral\natmosphere of the court seemed to indicate an approaching storm;\nthe courtiers and the ladies of the court avoided meeting in the\nante-chambers and the corridors in order not to converse on compromising\nsubjects. Monsieur had joined the king early in the morning for a\nhunting-party; Madame remained in her own apartment, cool and distant\nto every one; and the queen-mother, after she had said her prayers\nin Latin, talked of domestic matters with her two friends in pure\nCastilian. Madame de Motteville, who understood the language perfectly,\nanswered her in French. When the three ladies had exhausted every form\nof dissimulation and of politeness, as a circuitous mode of expressing\nthat the king's conduct was making the queen and the queen-mother pine\naway through sheer grief and vexation, and when, in the most guarded\nand polished phrases, they had fulminated every variety of imprecation\nagainst Mademoiselle de la Valliere, the queen-mother terminated\nher attack by an exclamation indicative of her own reflections and\ncharacter. \"_Estos hijos!_\" said she to Molina--which means, \"These\nchildren!\" words full of meaning on a mother's lips--words full of\nterrible significance in the mouth of a queen who, like Anne of Austria,\nhid many curious secrets in her soul.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Molina, \"children, children! for whom every mother becomes a\nsacrifice.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the queen; \"a mother sacrifices everything, certainly.\"\nShe did not finish her phrase; for she fancied, when she raised her eyes\ntowards the full-length portrait of the pale Louis XIII., that light\nonce more flashed from her husband's dull eyes, and his nostrils\ngrew livid with wrath. The portrait seemed animated by a living\nexpression--speak it did not, but it seemed to threaten. A profound\nsilence succeeded the queen's last remark. La Molina began to turn over\nribbons and laces on a large work-table. Madame de Motteville, surprised\nat the look of mutual intelligence which had been exchanged between the\nconfidant and her mistress, cast down her eyes like a discreet woman,\nand pretending to be observant of nothing that was passing, listened\nwith the utmost attention to every word. She heard nothing, however, but\na very insignificant \"hum\" on the part of the Spanish duenna, who was\nthe incarnation of caution--and a profound sigh on that of the queen.\nShe looked up immediately.\n\n\"You are suffering?\" she said.\n\n\"No, Motteville, no; why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Your majesty almost groaned just now.\"\n\n\"You are right; I did sigh, in truth.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Valot is not far off; I believe he is in Madame's apartment.\"\n\n\"Why is he with Madame?\"\n\n\"Madame is troubled with nervous attacks.\"\n\n\"A very fine disorder, indeed! There is little good in M. Valot being\nthere, when a very different physician would quickly cure Madame.\"\n\nMadame de Motteville looked up with an air of great surprise, as she\nreplied, \"Another doctor instead of M. Valot?--whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"Occupation, Motteville, occupation. If any one is really ill, it is my\npoor daughter.\"\n\n\"And your majesty, too.\"\n\n\"Less so this evening, though.\"\n\n\"Do not believe that too confidently, madame,\" said De Motteville. And,\nas if to justify her caution, a sharp, acute pain seized the queen,\nwho turned deadly pale, and threw herself back in the chair, with\nevery symptom of a sudden fainting fit. Molina ran to a richly gilded\ntortoise-shell cabinet, from which she took a large rock-crystal bottle\nof scented salts, and held it to the queen's nostrils, who inhaled it\nwildly for a few minutes, and murmured:\n\n\"It is hastening my death--but Heaven's will be done!\"\n\n\"Your majesty's death is not so near at hand,\" added Molina, replacing\nthe smelling-bottle in the cabinet.\n\n\"Does your majesty feel better now?\" inquired Madame de Motteville.\n\n\"Much better,\" returned the queen, placing her finger on her lips, to\nimpose silence on her favorite.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" remarked Madame de Motteville, after a pause.\n\n\"What is strange?\" said the queen.\n\n\"Does your majesty remember the day when this pain attacked you for the\nfirst time?\"\n\n\"I remember only that it was a grievously sad day for me, Motteville.\"\n\n\"But your majesty did not always regard that day as a sad one.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because three and twenty years ago, on that very day, his present\nmajesty, your own glorious son, was born at the very same hour.\"\n\nThe queen uttered a loud cry, buried her face in her hands, and seemed\nutterly prostrated for some minutes; but whether from recollections\nwhich arose in her mind, or from reflection, or even with sheer pain,\nwas doubtful. La Molina darted a look at Madame de Motteville, so full\nof bitter reproach, that the poor woman, perfectly ignorant of\nits meaning, was in her own exculpation on the point of asking an\nexplanation, when, suddenly, Anne of Austria arose and said, \"Yes, the\n5th of September; my sorrow began on the 5th of September. The greatest\njoy, one day; the deepest sorrow the next;--the sorrow,\" she added, \"the\nbitter expiation of a too excessive joy.\"\n\nAnd, from that moment, Anne of Austria, whose memory and reason seemed\nto be suspended for the time, remained impenetrable, with vacant look,\nmind almost wandering, and hands hanging heavily down, as if life had\nalmost departed.\n\n\"We must put her to bed,\" said La Molina.\n\n\"Presently, Molina.\"\n\n\"Let us leave the queen alone,\" added the Spanish attendant.\n\nMadame de Motteville rose; large tears were rolling down the queen's\npallid face; and Molina, having observed this sign of weakness, fixed\nher black vigilant eyes upon her.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied the queen. \"Leave us, Motteville; go.\"\n\nThe word \"us\" produced a disagreeable effect upon the ears of the\nFrench favorite; for it signified that an interchange of secrets, or of\nrevelations of the past, was about to be made, and that one person was\n_de trop_ in the conversation which seemed likely to take place.\n\n\"Will Molina, alone, be sufficient for your majesty to-night?\" inquired\nthe French woman.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the queen. Madame de Motteville bowed in submission, and\nwas about to withdraw, when suddenly an old female attendant, dressed\nas if she had belonged to the Spanish court of the year 1620, opened\nthe door, and surprised the queen in her tears. \"The remedy!\" she cried,\ndelightedly, to the queen, as she unceremoniously approached the group.\n\n\"What remedy?\" said Anne of Austria.\n\n\"For your majesty's sufferings,\" the former replied.\n\n\"Who brings it?\" asked Madame de Motteville, eagerly; \"Monsieur Valot?\"\n\n\"No; a lady from Flanders.\"\n\n\"From Flanders? Is she Spanish?\" inquired the queen.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Who sent her?\"\n\n\"M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"Her name?\"\n\n\"She did not mention it.\"\n\n\"Her position in life?\"\n\n\"She will answer that herself.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"She is masked.\"\n\n\"Go, Molina; go and see!\" cried the queen.\n\n\"It is needless,\" suddenly replied a voice, at once firm and gentle in\nits tone, which proceeded from the other side of the tapestry hangings;\na voice which made the attendants start, and the queen tremble\nexcessively. At the same moment, a masked female appeared through the\nhangings, and, before the queen could speak a syllable she added, \"I\nam connected with the order of the Beguines of Bruges, and do, indeed,\nbring with me the remedy which is certain to effect a cure of your\nmajesty's complaint.\" No one uttered a sound, and the Beguine did not\nmove a step.\n\n\"Speak,\" said the queen.\n\n\"I will, when we are alone,\" was the answer.\n\nAnne of Austria looked at her attendants, who immediately withdrew. The\nBeguine, thereupon, advanced a few steps towards the queen, and bowed\nreverently before her. The queen gazed with increasing mistrust at\nthis woman, who, in her turn, fixed a pair of brilliant eyes upon her,\nthrough her mask.\n\n\"The queen of France must, indeed, be very ill,\" said Anne of Austria,\n\"if it is known at the Beguinage of Bruges that she stands in need of\nbeing cured.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is not irremediably ill.\"\n\n\"But tell me how you happen to know I am suffering?\"\n\n\"Your majesty has friends in Flanders.\"\n\n\"Since these friends, then, sent you, mention their names.\"\n\n\"Impossible, madame, since your majesty's memory has not been awakened\nby your heart.\"\n\nAnne of Austria looked up, endeavoring to discover through the\nmysterious mask, and this ambiguous language, the name of her companion,\nwho expressed herself with such familiarity and freedom; then, suddenly,\nwearied by a curiosity which wounded every feeling of pride in her\nnature, she said, \"You are ignorant, perhaps, that royal personages are\nnever spoken to with the face masked.\"\n\n\"Deign to excuse me, madame,\" replied the Beguine, humbly.\n\n\"I cannot excuse you. I may, possibly, forgive you, if you throw your\nmask aside.\"\n\n\"I have made a vow, madame, to attend and aid all afflicted and\nsuffering persons, without ever permitting them to behold my face. I\nmight have been able to administer some relief to your body and to your\nmind, too; but since your majesty forbids me, I will take my leave.\nAdieu, madame, adieu!\"\n\nThese words were uttered with a harmony of tone and respect of manner\nthat disarmed the queen of all anger and suspicion, but did not remove\nher feeling of curiosity. \"You are right,\" she said; \"it ill-becomes\nthose who are suffering to reject the means of relief Heaven sends them.\nSpeak, then; and may you, indeed, be able, as you assert, to administer\nrelief to my body--\"\n\n\"Let us first speak a little of the mind, if you please,\" said the\nBeguine--\"of the mind, which, I am sure, must also suffer.\"\n\n\"My mind?\"\n\n\"There are cancers so insidious in their nature that their very\npulsations cannot be felt. Such cancers, madame, leave the ivory\nwhiteness of the skin unblemished, and putrefy not the firm, fair flesh,\nwith their blue tints; the physician who bends over the patient's\nchest hears not, though he listens, the insatiable teeth of the disease\ngrinding onward through the muscles, and the blood flows freely on; the\nknife has never been able to destroy, and rarely, even temporarily, to\ndisarm the rage of these mortal scourges,--their home is in the mind,\nwhich they corrupt,--they gnaw the whole heart until it breaks. Such,\nmadame, are the cancers fatal to queens; are you, too, free from their\nscourge?\"\n\nAnne slowly raised her arm, dazzling in its perfect whiteness, and pure\nin its rounded outlines as it was in the time of her earlier days.\n\n\"The evils to which you allude,\" she said, \"are the condition of the\nlives of the high in rank upon earth, to whom Heaven has imparted mind.\nWhen those evils become too heavy to be borne, Heaven lightens their\nburdens by penitence and confession. Thus, only, we lay down our burden\nand the secrets that oppress us. But, forget not that the same gracious\nHeaven, in its mercy, apportions to their trials the strength of the\nfeeble creatures of its hand; and my strength has enabled me to bear my\nburden. For the secrets of others, the silence of Heaven is more than\nsufficient; for my own secrets, that of my confessor is enough.\"\n\n\"You are as courageous, madame, I see, as ever, against your enemies.\nYou do not acknowledge your confidence in your friends?\"\n\n\"Queens have no friends; if you have nothing further to say to me,--if\nyou feel yourself inspired by Heaven as a prophetess--leave me, I pray,\nfor I dread the future.\"\n\n\"I should have supposed,\" said the Beguine, resolutely, \"that you would\nrather have dreaded the past.\"\n\nHardly had these words escaped her lips, than the queen rose up proudly.\n\"Speak,\" she cried, in a short, imperious tone of voice; \"explain\nyourself briefly, quickly, entirely; or, if not--\"\n\n\"Nay, do not threaten me, your majesty,\" said the Beguine, gently; \"I\ncame here to you full of compassion and respect. I came here on the part\nof a friend.\"\n\n\"Prove that to me! Comfort, instead of irritating me.\"\n\n\"Easily enough, and your majesty will see who is friendly to you. What\nmisfortune has happened to your majesty during these three and twenty\nyears past--\"\n\n\"Serious misfortunes, indeed; have I not lost the king?\"\n\n\"I speak not of misfortunes of _that_ kind. I wish to ask you, if, since\nthe birth of the king, any indiscretion on a friend's part has caused\nyour majesty the slightest serious anxiety, or distress?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied the queen, clenching her teeth in\norder to conceal her emotion.\n\n\"I will make myself understood, then. Your majesty remembers that the\nking was born on the 5th of September, 1638, at a quarter past eleven\no'clock.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" stammered out the queen.\n\n\"At half-past twelve,\" continued the Beguine, \"the dauphin, who had been\nbaptized by Monseigneur de Meaux in the king's and your own presence,\nwas acknowledged as the heir of the crown of France. The king then went\nto the chapel of the old Chateau de Saint-Germain, to hear the _Te Deum_\nchanted.\"\n\n\"Quite true, quite true,\" murmured the queen.\n\n\"Your majesty's conferment took place in the presence of Monsieur, his\nmajesty's late uncle, of the princes, and of the ladies attached to\nthe court. The king's physician, Bouvard, and Honore, the surgeon, were\nstationed in the ante-chamber; your majesty slept from three o'clock\nuntil seven, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but you tell me no more than every one else knows as well as\nyou and myself.\"\n\n\"I am now, madame, approaching that which very few persons are\nacquainted with. Very few persons, did I say, alas! I might say two\nonly, for formerly there were but five in all, and, for many years\npast, the secret has been well preserved by the deaths of the principal\nparticipators in it. The late king sleeps now with his ancestors;\nPerronnette, the midwife, soon followed him; Laporte is already\nforgotten.\"\n\nThe queen opened her lips as though to reply; she felt, beneath her\nicy hand, with which she kept her face half concealed, the beads of\nperspiration on her brow.\n\n\"It was eight o'clock,\" pursued the Beguine; \"the king was seated at\nsupper, full of joy and happiness; around him on all sides arose wild\ncries of delight and drinking of healths; the people cheered beneath\nthe balconies; the Swiss guards, the musketeers, and the royal guards\nwandered through the city, borne about in triumph by the drunken\nstudents. Those boisterous sounds of general joy disturbed the dauphin,\nthe future king of France, who was quietly lying in the arms of Madame\nde Hausac, his nurse, and whose eyes, as he opened them, and stared\nabout, might have observed two crowns at the foot of his cradle.\nSuddenly your majesty uttered a piercing cry, and Dame Perronnette\nimmediately flew to your bedside. The doctors were dining in a room at\nsome distance from your chamber; the palace, deserted from the frequency\nof the irruptions made into it, was without either sentinels or guards.\nThe midwife, having questioned and examined your majesty, gave a sudden\nexclamation as if in wild astonishment, and taking you in her arms,\nbewildered almost out of her senses from sheer distress of mind,\ndispatched Laporte to inform the king that her majesty the queen-mother\nwished to see him in her room. Laporte, you are aware, madame, was a man\nof the most admirable calmness and presence of mind. He did not approach\nthe king as if he were the bearer of alarming intelligence and wished\nto inspire the terror he himself experienced; besides, it was not a\nvery terrifying intelligence which awaited the king. Therefore, Laporte\nappeared with a smile upon his lips, and approached the king's chair,\nsaying to him--'Sire, the queen is very happy, and would be still more\nso to see your majesty.' On that day, Louis XIII. would have given\nhis crown away to the veriest beggar for a 'God bless you.' Animated,\nlight-hearted, and full of gayety, the king rose from the table,\nand said to those around him, in a tone that Henry IV. might have\nadopted,--'Gentlemen, I am going to see my wife.' He came to your\nbeside, madame, at the very moment Dame Perronnette presented to him a\nsecond prince, as beautiful and healthy as the former, and said--'Sire,\nHeaven will not allow the kingdom of France to fall into the female\nline.' The king, yielding to a first impulse, clasped the child in his\narms, and cried, 'Oh, Heaven, I thank Thee!'\"\n\nAt this part of her recital, the Beguine paused, observing how intensely\nthe queen was suffering; she had thrown herself back in her chair, and\nwith her head bent forward and her eyes fixed, listened without seeming\nto hear, and her lips moving convulsively, either breathing a prayer to\nHeaven or imprecations on the woman standing before her.\n\n\"Ah! I do not believe that, if, because there could be but one dauphin\nin France,\" exclaimed the Beguine, \"the queen allowed that child to\nvegetate, banished from his royal parents' presence, she was on that\naccount an unfeeling mother. Oh, no, no; there are those alive who have\nknown and witnessed the passionate kisses she imprinted on that innocent\ncreature in exchange for a life of misery and gloom to which state\npolicy condemned the twin brother of Louis XIV.\"\n\n\"Oh! Heaven!\" murmured the queen feebly.\n\n\"It is admitted,\" continued the Beguine, quickly, \"that when the king\nperceived the effect which would result from the existence of two sons,\nequal in age and pretensions, he trembled for the welfare of France,\nfor the tranquillity of the state; and it is equally well known that\nCardinal de Richelieu, by the direction of Louis XIII., thought over\nthe subject with deep attention, and after an hour's meditation in his\nmajesty's cabinet, he pronounced the following sentence:--'One prince\nmeans peace and safety for the state; two competitors, civil war and\nanarchy.'\"\n\nThe queen rose suddenly from her seat, pale as death, and her hands\nclenched together:\n\n\"You know too much,\" she said, in a hoarse, thick voice, \"since you\nrefer to secrets of state. As for the friends from whom you have\nacquired this secret, they are false and treacherous. You are their\naccomplice in the crime which is being now committed. Now, throw aside\nyour mask, or I will have you arrested by my captain of the guards. Do\nnot think that this secret terrifies me! You have obtained it, you shall\nrestore it to me. Never shall it leave your bosom, for neither your\nsecret nor your own life belong to you from this moment.\"\n\nAnne of Austria, joining gesture to the threat, advanced a couple of\nsteps towards the Beguine.\n\n\"Learn,\" said the latter, \"to know and value the fidelity, the honor,\nand secrecy of the friends you have abandoned.\" And, then, suddenly she\nthrew aside her mask.\n\n\"Madame de Chevreuse!\" exclaimed the queen.\n\n\"With your majesty, the sole living _confidante_ of the secret.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured Anne of Austria; \"come and embrace me, duchesse. Alas!\nyou kill your friend in thus trifling with her terrible distress.\"\n\nAnd the queen, leaning her head upon the shoulder of the old duchesse,\nburst into a flood of bitter tears. \"How young you are--still!\" said the\nlatter, in a hollow voice; \"you can weep!\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLIV. Two Friends.\n\nThe queen looked steadily at Madame de Chevreuse, and said: \"I believe\nyou just now made use of the word 'happy' in speaking of me. Hitherto,\nduchesse, I had thought it impossible that a human creature could\nanywhere be found more miserable than the queen of France.\"\n\n\"Your afflictions, madame, have indeed been terrible enough. But by the\nside of those great and grand misfortunes to which we, two old friends,\nseparated by men's malice, were just now alluding, you possess sources\nof pleasure, slight enough in themselves it may be, but greatly envied\nby the world.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" said Anne of Austria, bitterly. \"What can induce you\nto pronounce the word 'pleasure,' duchesse--you who, just now, admitted\nthat my body and my mind both stood in need of remedies?\"\n\nMadame de Chevreuse collected herself for a moment, and then murmured,\n\"How far removed kings are from other people!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that they are so far removed from the vulgar herd that they\nforget that others often stand in need of the bare necessities of life.\nThey are like the inhabitant of the African mountains, who, gazing from\nthe verdant tableland, refreshed by the rills of melted snow, cannot\ncomprehend that the dwellers in the plains below are perishing from\nhunger and thirst in the midst of the desert, burnt up by the heat of\nthe sun.\"\n\nThe queen colored, for she now began to perceive the drift of her\nfriend's remark. \"It was very wrong,\" she said, \"to have neglected you.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, I know the king has inherited the hatred his father bore\nme. The king would exile me if he knew I were in the Palais Royal.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that the king is very well disposed towards you,\nduchesse,\" replied the queen; \"but I could--secretly, you know--\"\n\nThe duchesse's disdainful smile produced a feeling of uneasiness in the\nqueen's mind. \"Duchesse,\" she hastened to add, \"you did perfectly\nright to come here, even were it only to give us the happiness of\ncontradicting the report of your death.\"\n\n\"Has it been rumored, then, that I was dead?\"\n\n\"Everywhere.\"\n\n\"And yet my children did not go into mourning.\"\n\n\"Ah! you know, duchesse, the court is very frequently moving about from\nplace to place; we see M. Albert de Luynes but seldom, and many things\nescape our minds in the midst of the preoccupations that constantly\nbeset us.\"\n\n\"Your majesty ought not to have believed the report of my death.\"\n\n\"Why not? Alas! we are all mortal; and you may perceive how rapidly\nI, your younger sister, as we used formerly to say, am approaching the\ntomb.\"\n\n\"If your majesty believed me dead, you ought, in that case, to have been\nastonished not to have received the news.\"\n\n\"Death not unfrequently takes us by surprise, duchesse.\"\n\n\"Oh! your majesty, those who are burdened with secrets such as we have\njust now discussed must, as a necessity of their nature, satisfy their\ncraving desire to divulge them, and they feel they must gratify that\ndesire before they die. Among the various preparations for their final\njourney, the task of placing their papers in order is not omitted.\"\n\nThe queen started.\n\n\"Your majesty will be sure to learn, in a particular manner, the day of\nmy death.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Because your majesty will receive the next day, under several\ncoverings, everything connected with our mysterious correspondence of\nformer times.\"\n\n\"Did you not burn them?\" cried Anne, in alarm.\n\n\"Traitors only,\" replied the duchesse, \"destroy a royal correspondence.\"\n\n\"Traitors, do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, or rather they pretend to destroy, instead of which\nthey keep or sell it. Faithful friends, on the contrary, most carefully\nsecrete such treasures, for it may happen that some day or other they\nwould wish to seek out their queen in order to say to her: 'Madame, I am\ngetting old; my health is fast failing me; in the presence of the danger\nof death, for there is the risk for your majesty that this secret may\nbe revealed, take, therefore, this paper, so fraught with menace for\nyourself, and trust not to another to burn it for you.'\"\n\n\"What paper do you refer to?\"\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, I have but one, it is true, but that is\nindeed most dangerous in its nature.\"\n\n\"Oh! duchesse, tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"A letter, dated Tuesday, the 2d of August, 1644, in which you beg me to\ngo to Noisy-le-Sec, to see that unhappy child. In your own handwriting,\nmadame, there are those words, 'that unhappy child!'\"\n\nA profound silence ensued; the queen's mind was busy in the past; Madame\nde Chevreuse was watching the progress of her scheme. \"Yes, unhappy,\nmost unhappy!\" murmured Anne of Austria; \"how sad the existence he led,\npoor child, to finish it in so cruel a manner.\"\n\n\"Is he dead?\" cried the duchesse suddenly, with a curiosity whose\ngenuine accents the queen instinctively detected.\n\n\"He died of consumption, died forgotten, died withered and blighted like\nthe flowers a lover has given to his mistress, which she leaves to die\nsecreted in a drawer where she had hid them from the gaze of others.\"\n\n\"Died!\" repeated the duchesse with an air of discouragement, which would\nhave afforded the queen the most unfeigned delight, had it not\nbeen tempered in some measure with a mixture of doubt--\"Died--at\nNoisy-le-Sec?\"\n\n\"Yes, in the arms of his tutor, a poor, honest man, who did not long\nsurvive him.\"\n\n\"That can easily be understood; it is so difficult to bear up under the\nweight of such a loss and such a secret,\" said Madame de Chevreuse,--the\nirony of which reflection the queen pretended not to perceive. Madame\nde Chevreuse continued: \"Well, madame, I inquired some years ago at\nNoisy-le-Sec about this unhappy child. I was told that it was not\nbelieved he was dead, and that was my reason for not having at first\ncondoled with your majesty; for, most certainly, if I could have thought\nit were true, never should I have made the slightest allusion to so\ndeplorable an event, and thus have re-awakened your majesty's most\nnatural distress.\"\n\n\"You say that it is not believed the child died at Noisy?\"\n\n\"No, madame.\"\n\n\"What did they say about him, then?\"\n\n\"They said--but, no doubt, they were mistaken--\"\n\n\"Nay, speak, speak!\"\n\n\"They said, that one evening, about the year 1645, a lady, beautiful and\nmajestic in her bearing, which was observed notwithstanding the mask and\nthe mantle that concealed her figure--a lady of rank, of very high rank,\nno doubt--came in a carriage to the place where the road branches off;\nthe very same spot, you know, where I awaited news of the young prince\nwhen your majesty was graciously pleased to send me there.\"\n\n\"Well, well?\"\n\n\"That the boy's tutor, or guardian, took the child to this lady.\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\"\n\n\"That both the child and his tutor left that part of the country the\nvery next day.\"\n\n\"There, you see there is some truth in what you relate, since, in point\nof fact, the poor child died from a sudden attack of illness, which\nmakes the lives of all children, as doctors say, suspended as it were by\na thread.\"\n\n\"What your majesty says is quite true; no one knows it better than\nyourself--no one believes it more strongly than myself. But yet, how\nstrange it is--\"\n\n\"What can it now be?\" thought the queen.\n\n\"The person who gave me these details, who was sent to inquire after the\nchild's health--\"\n\n\"Did you confide such a charge to any one else? Oh, duchesse!\"\n\n\"Some one as dumb as your majesty, as dumb as myself; we will suppose\nit was myself, Madame; this some one, some months after, passing through\nTouraine--\"\n\n\"Touraine!\"\n\n\"Recognized both the tutor and the child, too! I am wrong, thought he\nrecognized them, both living, cheerful, happy, and flourishing, the one\nin a green old age, the other in the flower of his youth. Judge after\nthat what truth can be attributed to the rumors which are circulated, or\nwhat faith, after that, placed in anything that may happen in the world!\nBut I am fatiguing your majesty; it was not my intention, however, to do\nso, and I will take my leave of you, after renewing to you the assurance\nof my most respectful devotion.\"\n\n\"Stay, duchesse; let us first talk a little about yourself.\"\n\n\"Of myself, madame! I am not worthy that you should bend your looks upon\nme.\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed? Are you not the oldest friend I have? Are you angry\nwith me, duchesse?\"\n\n\"I, indeed! what motive could I have? If I had reason to be angry with\nyour majesty, should I have come here?\"\n\n\"Duchesse, age is fast creeping on us both; we should be united against\nthat death whose approach cannot be far off.\"\n\n\"You overpower me, madame, with the kindness of your language.\"\n\n\"No one has ever loved or served me as you have done, duchesse.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is too kind in remembering it.\"\n\n\"Not so. Give me a proof of your friendship, duchesse.\"\n\n\"My whole being is devoted to you, madame.\"\n\n\"The proof I require is, that you should ask something of me.\"\n\n\"Ask--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know you well,--no one is more disinterested, more noble, and\ntruly loyal.\"\n\n\"Do not praise me too highly, madame,\" said the duchesse, somewhat\nanxiously.\n\n\"I could never praise you as much as you deserve to be praised.\"\n\n\"And yet, age and misfortune effect a terrible change in people,\nmadame.\"\n\n\"So much the better; for the beautiful, the haughty, the adored duchesse\nof former days might have answered me ungratefully, 'I do not wish for\nanything from you.' Heaven be praised! The misfortunes you speak of have\nindeed worked a change in you, for you will now, perhaps, answer me, 'I\naccept.'\"\n\nThe duchesse's look and smile soon changed at this conclusion, and she\nno longer attempted to act a false part.\n\n\"Speak, dearest, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I must first explain to you--\"\n\n\"Do so unhesitatingly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, your majesty can confer the greatest, the most ineffable\npleasure upon me.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said the queen, a little distant in her manner, from an\nuneasiness of feeling produced by this remark. \"But do not forget, my\ngood Chevreuse, that I am quite as much under my son's influence as I\nwas formerly under my husband's.\"\n\n\"I will not be too hard, madame.\"\n\n\"Call me as you used to do; it will be a sweet echo of our happy youth.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my dear mistress, my darling Anne--\"\n\n\"Do you know Spanish, still?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ask me in Spanish, then.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty do me the honor to pass a few days with me at\nDampierre?\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" said the queen, stupefied. \"Nothing more than that?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! can you possibly imagine that, in asking you that, I am\nnot asking you the greatest conceivable favor? If that really be the\ncase, you do not know me. Will you accept?\"\n\n\"Yes, gladly. And I shall be happy,\" continued the queen, with some\nsuspicion, \"if my presence can in any way be useful to you.\"\n\n\"Useful!\" exclaimed the duchesse, laughing; \"oh, no, no,\nagreeable--delightful, if you like; and you promise me, then?\"\n\n\"I swear it,\" said the queen, whereupon the duchesse seized her\nbeautiful hand, and covered it with kisses. The queen could not help\nmurmuring to herself, \"She is a good-hearted woman, and very generous,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty consent to wait a fortnight before you come?\"\n\n\"Certainly; but why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the duchesse, \"knowing me to be in disgrace, no one\nwould lend me the hundred thousand francs, which I require to put\nDampierre into a state of repair. But when it is known that I require\nthat sum for the purpose of receiving your majesty at Dampierre\nproperly, all the money in Paris will be at my disposal.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the queen, gently nodding her head in sign of intelligence,\n\"a hundred thousand francs! you want a hundred thousand francs to put\nDampierre into repair?\"\n\n\"Quite as much as that.\"\n\n\"And no one will lend you them?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"I will lend them to you, if you like, duchesse.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hardly dare accept such a sum.\"\n\n\"You would be wrong if you did _not_. Besides, a hundred thousand francs\nis really not much. I know but too well that you never set a right value\nupon your silence and secrecy. Push that table a little towards me,\nduchesse, and I will write you an order on M. Colbert; no, on M.\nFouquet, who is a far more courteous and obliging man.\"\n\n\"Will he pay it, though?\"\n\n\"If he will not pay it, I will; but it will be the first time he will\nhave refused me.\"\n\nThe queen wrote and handed the duchesse the order, and afterwards\ndismissed her with a warm embrace.\n\n\n\nChapter XLV. How Jean de La Fontaine Came to Write His First Tale.\n\nAll these intrigues are exhausted; the human mind, so variously\ncomplicated, has been enabled to develop itself at its ease in the three\noutlines with which our recital has supplied it. It is not unlikely\nthat, in the future we are now preparing, a question of politics and\nintrigues may still arise, but the springs by which they work will be\nso carefully concealed that no one will be able to see aught but flowers\nand paintings, just as at a theater, where a colossus appears upon the\nscene, walking along moved by the small legs and slender arms of a child\nconcealed within the framework.\n\nWe now return to Saint-Mande, where the superintendent was in the habit\nof receiving his select confederacy of epicureans. For some time past\nthe host had met with nothing but trouble. Every one in the house was\naware of and felt for the minister's distress. No more magnificent or\nrecklessly improvident _reunions_. Money had been the pretext assigned\nby Fouquet, and never _was_ any pretext, as Gourville said, more\nfallacious, for there was not even a shadow of money to be seen.\n\nM. Vatel was resolutely painstaking in keeping up the reputation of the\nhouse, and yet the gardeners who supplied the kitchens complained of\nruinous delays. The agents for the supply of Spanish wines sent drafts\nwhich no one honored; fishermen, whom the superintendent engaged on the\ncoast of Normandy, calculated that if they were paid all that was due to\nthem, the amount would enable them to retire comfortably for life; fish,\nwhich, at a later period, was the cause of Vatel's death, did not arrive\nat all. However, on the ordinary reception days, Fouquet's friends\nflocked in more numerously than ever. Gourville and the Abbe Fouquet\ntalked over money matters--that is to say, the abbe borrowed a few\npistoles from Gourville; Pelisson, seated with his legs crossed, was\nengaged in finishing the peroration of a speech with which Fouquet\nwas to open the parliament; and this speech was a masterpiece, because\nPelisson wrote it for his friend--that is to say, he inserted all kinds\nof clever things the latter would most certainly never have taken the\ntrouble to say of his own accord. Presently Loret and La Fontaine would\nenter from the garden, engaged in a dispute about the art of making\nverses. The painters and musicians, in their turn, were hovering near\nthe dining-room. As soon as eight o'clock struck the supper would be\nannounced, for the superintendent never kept any one waiting. It was\nalready half-past seven, and the appetites of the guests were beginning\nto declare themselves in an emphatic manner. As soon as all the guests\nwere assembled, Gourville went straight up to Pelisson, awoke him out\nof his reverie, and led him into the middle of a room, and closed the\ndoors. \"Well,\" he said, \"anything new?\"\n\nPelisson raised his intelligent and gentle face, and said: \"I have\nborrowed five and twenty thousand francs of my aunt, and I have them\nhere in good sterling money.\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Gourville; \"we only what one hundred and ninety-five\nthousand livres for the first payment.\"\n\n\"The payment of what?\" asked La Fontaine.\n\n\"What! absent-minded as usual! Why, it was you who told us the small\nestate at Corbeli was going to be sold by one of M. Fouquet's creditors;\nand you, also, who proposed that all his friends should subscribe--more\nthan that, it was you who said that you would sell a corner of your\nhouse at Chateau-Thierry, in order to furnish your own proportion, and\nyou come and ask--'_The payment of what?_'\"\n\nThis remark was received with a general laugh, which made La Fontaine\nblush. \"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"I had not forgotten it; oh, no!\nonly--\"\n\n\"Only you remembered nothing about it,\" replied Loret.\n\n\"That is the truth, and the fact is, he is quite right, there is a great\ndifference between forgetting and not remembering.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" added Pelisson, \"you bring your mite in the shape of the\nprice of the piece of land you have sold?\"\n\n\"Sold? no!\"\n\n\"Have you not sold the field, then?\" inquired Gourville, in\nastonishment, for he knew the poet's disinterestedness.\n\n\"My wife would not let me,\" replied the latter, at which there were\nfresh bursts of laughter.\n\n\"And yet you went to Chateau-Thierry for that purpose,\" said some one.\n\n\"Certainly I did, and on horseback.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\"\n\n\"I had eight different horses, and I was almost bumped to death.\"\n\n\"You are an excellent fellow! And you rested yourself when you arrived\nthere?\"\n\n\"Rested! Oh! of course I did, for I had an immense deal of work to do.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"My wife had been flirting with the man to whom I wished to sell the\nland. The fellow drew back from his bargain, and so I challenged him.\"\n\n\"Very good, and you fought?\"\n\n\"It seems not.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, my wife and her relations interfered in the matter. I was kept a\nquarter of an hour with my sword in my hand; but I was not wounded.\"\n\n\"And your adversary?\"\n\n\"Oh! he wasn't wounded either, for he never came on the field.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" cried his friends from all sides, \"you must have been\nterribly angry.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly so; I caught cold; I returned home and then my wife began\nto quarrel with me.\"\n\n\"In real earnest?\"\n\n\"Yes, in real earnest. She threw a loaf of bread at my head, a large\nloaf.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"Oh! I upset the table over her and her guests; and then I got on my\nhorse again, and here I am.\"\n\nEvery one had great difficulty in keeping his countenance at the\nexposure of this heroi-comedy, and when the laughter had subsided, one\nof the guests present said to La Fontaine: \"Is that all you have brought\nback?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I have an excellent idea in my head.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Have you noticed that there is a good deal of sportive, jesting poetry\nwritten in France?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" replied every one.\n\n\"And,\" pursued La Fontaine, \"only a very small portion of it is\nprinted.\"\n\n\"The laws are strict, you know.\"\n\n\"That may be; but a rare article is a dear article, and that is the\nreason why I have written a small poem, excessively free in its style,\nvery broad, and extremely cynical in its tone.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the poet, with assumed indifference, \"and I have\nintroduced the greatest freedom of language I could possibly employ.\"\n\nPeals of laughter again broke forth, while the poet was thus announcing\nthe quality of his wares. \"And,\" he continued, \"I have tried to excel\neverything that Boccaccio, Aretin, and other masters of their craft have\nwritten in the same style.\"\n\n\"Its fate is clear,\" said Pelisson; \"it will be suppressed and\nforbidden.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said La Fontaine, simply. \"I assure you I did not do\nit on my own account so much as M. Fouquet's.\"\n\nThis wonderful conclusion again raised the mirth of all present.\n\n\"And I have sold the first edition of this little book for eight hundred\nlivres,\" exclaimed La Fontaine, rubbing his hands together. \"Serious and\nreligions books sell at about half that rate.\"\n\n\"It would have been better,\" said Gourville, \"to have written two\nreligious books instead.\"\n\n\"It would have been too long, and not amusing enough,\" replied La\nFontaine tranquilly; \"my eight hundred livres are in this little bag,\nand I beg to offer them as _my_ contribution.\"\n\nAs he said this, he placed his offering in the hands of their treasurer;\nit was then Loret's turn, who gave a hundred and fifty livres; the\nothers stripped themselves in the same way; and the total sum in the\npurse amounted to forty thousand livres. The money was still being\ncounted over when the superintendent noiselessly entered the room;\nhe had heard everything; and then this man, who had possessed so many\nmillions, who had exhausted all the pleasures and honors the world had\nto bestow, this generous heart, this inexhaustible brain, which had,\nlike two burning crucibles, devoured the material and moral substance of\nthe first kingdom in Europe, was seen to cross the threshold with tears\nin his eyes, and pass his fingers through the gold and silver which the\nbag contained.\n\n\"Poor offering,\" he said, in a softened and affected tone of voice, \"you\nwill disappear into the smallest corner of my empty purse, but you have\nfilled to overflowing that which no one can ever exhaust, my heart.\nThank you, my friends--thank you.\" And as he could not embrace every\none present, who were all tearful, too, philosophers as they were, he\nembraced La Fontaine, saying to him, \"Poor fellow! so you have, on my\naccount, been beaten by your wife and censured by your confessor.\"\n\n\"Oh! it is a mere nothing,\" replied the poet; \"if your creditors will\nonly wait a couple of years, I shall have written a hundred other tales,\nwhich, at two editions each, will pay off the debt.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLVI. La Fontaine in the Character of a Negotiator.\n\nFouquet pressed La Fontaine's hand most warmly, saying to him, \"My dear\npoet, write a hundred other tales, not only for the eighty pistoles\nwhich each of them will produce you, but, still more, to enrich our\nlanguage with a hundred new masterpieces of composition.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said La Fontaine, with a little air of pride, \"you must not\nsuppose that I have only brought this idea and the eighty pistoles to\nthe superintendent.\"\n\n\"Oh! indeed,\" was the general acclamation from all parts of the room,\n\"M. de la Fontaine is in funds to-day.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied La Fontaine.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" cried the assembly.\n\n\"Take care,\" said Pelisson in La Fontaine's ear; \"you have had a most\nbrilliant success up to the present moment; do not go beyond your\ndepth.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Monsieur Pelisson; and you, who are a man of decided taste,\nwill be the first to approve of what I have done.\"\n\n\"We are talking of millions, remember,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"I have fifteen hundred thousand francs here, Monsieur Gourville,\" he\nreplied, striking himself on the chest.\n\n\"The deuce take this Gascon from Chateau-Thierry!\" cried Loret.\n\n\"It is not the pocket you must tap--but the brain,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Stay a moment, monsieur le surintendant,\" added La Fontaine; \"you are\nnot procureur-general--you are a poet.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" cried Loret, Conrart, and every person present connected\nwith literature.\n\n\"You are, I repeat, a poet and a painter, a sculptor, a friend of the\narts and sciences; but, acknowledge that you are no lawyer.\"\n\n\"Oh! I do acknowledge it,\" replied M. Fouquet, smiling.\n\n\"If you were to be nominated at the Academy, you would refuse, I think.\"\n\n\"I think I should, with all due deference to the academicians.\"\n\n\"Very good; if, therefore, you do not wish to belong to the Academy, why\ndo you allow yourself to form one of the parliament?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pelisson, \"we are talking politics.\"\n\n\"I wish to know whether the barrister's gown does or does not become M.\nFouquet.\"\n\n\"There is no question of the gown at all,\" retorted Pelisson, annoyed at\nthe laughter of those who were present.\n\n\"On the contrary, it is the gown,\" said Loret.\n\n\"Take the gown away from the procureur-general,\" said Conrart, \"and we\nhave M. Fouquet left us still, of whom we have no reason to complain;\nbut, as he is no procureur-general without his gown, we agree with M. de\nla Fontaine and pronounce the gown to be nothing but a bugbear.\"\n\n\"_Fugiunt risus leporesque_,\" said Loret.\n\n\"The smiles and the graces,\" said some one present.\n\n\"That is not the way,\" said Pelisson, gravely, \"that I translate\n_lepores_.\"\n\n\"How do you translate it?\" said La Fontaine.\n\n\"Thus: The hares run away as soon as they see M. Fouquet.\" A burst of\nlaughter, in which the superintendent joined, followed this sally.\n\n\"But why hares?\" objected Conrart, vexed.\n\n\"Because the hare will be the very one who will not be over pleased to\nsee M. Fouquet surrounded by all the attributes which his parliamentary\nstrength and power confer on him.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" murmured the poets.\n\n\"_Quo non ascendam_,\" said Conrart, \"seems impossible to me, when one is\nfortunate enough to wear the gown of the procureur-general.\" [9]\n\n\"On the contrary, it seems so to me without that gown,\" said the\nobstinate Pelisson; \"what is your opinion, Gourville?\"\n\n\"I think the gown in question is a very good thing,\" replied the latter;\n\"but I equally think that a million and a half is far better than the\ngown.\"\n\n\"And I am of Gourville's opinion,\" exclaimed Fouquet, stopping the\ndiscussion by the expression of his own opinion, which would necessarily\nbear down all the others.\n\n\"A million and a half,\" Pelisson grumbled out; \"now I happen to know an\nIndian fable--\"\n\n\"Tell it to me,\" said La Fontaine; \"I ought to know it too.\"\n\n\"Tell it, tell it,\" said the others.\n\n\"There was a tortoise, which was, as usual, well protected by its\nshell,\" said Pelisson; \"whenever its enemies threatened it, it took\nrefuge within its covering. One day some one said to it, 'You must feel\nvery hot in such a house as that in the summer, and you are altogether\nprevented showing off your graces; there is a snake here, who will give\nyou a million and a half for your shell.'\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the superintendent, laughing.\n\n\"Well, what next?\" said La Fontaine, more interested in the apologue\nthan in the moral.\n\n\"The tortoise sold his shell and remained naked and defenseless. A\nvulture happened to see him, and being hungry, broke the tortoise's back\nwith a blow of his beak and devoured it. The moral is, that M. Fouquet\nshould take very good care to keep his gown.\"\n\nLa Fontaine understood the moral seriously. \"You forget Aeschylus,\" he\nsaid, to his adversary.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Aeschylus was bald-headed, and a vulture--your vulture, probably--who\nwas a great amateur in tortoises, mistook at a distance his head for a\nblock of stone, and let a tortoise, which was shrunk up in his shell,\nfall upon it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, La Fontaine is right,\" resumed Fouquet, who had become very\nthoughtful; \"whenever a vulture wishes to devour a tortoise, he well\nknows how to break his shell; but happy is that tortoise a snake pays\na million and a half for his envelope. If any one were to bring me a\ngenerous-hearted snake like the one in your fable, Pelisson, I would\ngive him my shell.\"\n\n\"_Rara avis in terres!_\" cried Conrart. [10]\n\n\"And like a black swan, is he not?\" added La Fontaine; \"well, then, the\nbird in question, black and rare, is already found.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you have found a purchaser for my post of\nprocureur-general?\" exclaimed Fouquet.\n\n\"I have, monsieur.\"\n\n\"But the superintendent never said that he wished to sell,\" resumed\nPelisson.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Conrart, \"you yourself spoke about it, even--\"\n\n\"Yes, I am a witness to that,\" said Gourville.\n\n\"He seems very tenacious about his brilliant idea,\" said Fouquet,\nlaughing. \"Well, La Fontaine, who is the purchaser?\"\n\n\"A perfect blackbird, for he is a counselor belonging to the parliament,\nan excellent fellow.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Vanel.\"\n\n\"Vanel!\" exclaimed Fouquet. \"Vanel the husband of--\"\n\n\"Precisely, her husband; yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Fouquet, with an expression of great interest.\n\n\"He wishes to be everything that you have been, monsieur,\" said\nGourville, \"and to do everything that you have done.\"\n\n\"It is very agreeable; tell us all about it, La Fontaine.\"\n\n\"It is very simple. I see him occasionally, and a short time ago I met\nhim, walking about on the Place de la Bastile, at the very moment when I\nwas about to take the small carriage to come down here to Saint-Mande.\"\n\n\"He must have been watching his wife,\" interrupted Loret.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said La Fontaine, \"he is far from being jealous. He accosted\nme, embraced me, and took me to the inn called L'Image Saint-Fiacre, and\ntold me all about his troubles.\"\n\n\"He has his troubles, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; his wife wants to make him ambitious.\"\n\n\"Well, and he told you--\"\n\n\"That some one had spoken to him about a post in parliament; that M.\nFouquet's name had been mentioned; that ever since, Madame Vanel dreams\nof nothing else than being called madame la procureur-generale, and that\nit makes her ill and kills her every night she does not dream about it.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"Poor woman!\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Wait a moment. Conrart is always telling me that I do not know how to\nconduct matters of business; you will see how I managed this one.\"\n\n\"Well, go on.\"\n\n\"'I suppose you know,' said I to Vanel, 'that the value of a post such\nas that which M. Fouquet holds is by no means trifling.'\n\n\"'How much do you imagine it to be?' he said.\n\n\"'M. Fouquet, I know, has refused seventeen hundred thousand francs.'\n\n\"'My wife,' replied Vanel, 'had estimated it at about fourteen hundred\nthousand.'\n\n\"'Ready money?' I said.\n\n\"'Yes; she has sold some property of hers in Guienne, and has received\nthe purchase money.'\"\n\n\"That's a pretty sum to touch all at once,\" said the Abbe Fouquet, who\nhad not hitherto said a word.\n\n\"Poor Madame Vanel!\" murmured Fouquet.\n\nPelisson shrugged his shoulders, as he whispered in Fouquet's ear, \"That\nwoman is a perfect fiend.\"\n\n\"That may be; and it will be delightful to make use of this fiend's\nmoney to repair the injury which an angel has done herself for me.\"\n\nPelisson looked with a surprised air at Fouquet, whose thoughts were\nfrom that moment fixed upon a fresh object in view.\n\n\"Well!\" inquired La Fontaine, \"what about my negotiation?\"\n\n\"Admirable, my dear poet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gourville; \"but there are some people who are anxious to\nhave the steed who have not even money enough to pay for the bridle.\"\n\n\"And Vanel would draw back from his offer if he were to be taken at his\nword,\" continued the Abbe Fouquet.\n\n\"I do not believe it,\" said La Fontaine.\n\n\"What do you know about it?\"\n\n\"Why, you have not yet heard the _denouement_ of my story.\"\n\n\"If there is a _denouement_, why do you beat about the bush so much?\"\n\n\"_Semper ad eventum_. Is that correct?\" said Fouquet, with the air of a\nnobleman who condescends to barbarisms. To which the Latinists present\nanswered with loud applause. [11]\n\n\"My _denouement_,\" cried La Fontaine, \"is that Vanel, that determined\nblackbird, knowing that I was coming to Saint-Mande, implored me to\nbring him with me, and, if possible, to present him to M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"So that--\"\n\n\"So that he is here; I left him in that part of the ground called\nBel-Air. Well, M. Fouquet, what is your reply?\"\n\n\"Well, it is not respectful towards Madame Vanel that her husband\nshould run the risk of catching cold outside my house; send for him, La\nFontaine, since you know where he is.\"\n\n\"I will go myself.\"\n\n\"And I will accompany you,\" said the Abbe Fouquet; \"I will carry the\nmoney bags.\"\n\n\"No jesting,\" said Fouquet, seriously; \"let the business be a serious\none, if it is to be one at all. But first of all, let us show we are\nhospitable. Make my apologies, La Fontaine, to M. Vanel, and tell him\nhow distressed I am to have kept him waiting, but that I was not\naware he was there.\"\n\nLa Fontaine set off at once, fortunately accompanied by Gourville,\nfor, absorbed in his own calculations, the poet would have mistaken\nthe route, and was hurrying as fast as he could towards the village\nof Saint-Mande. Within a quarter of an hour afterwards, M. Vanel was\nintroduced into the superintendent's cabinet, a description of which has\nalready been given at the beginning of this story. When Fouquet saw him\nenter, he called to Pelisson, and whispered a few words in his ear. \"Do\nnot lose a single word of what I am going to say: let all the silver and\ngold plate, together with my jewels of every description, be packed\nup in the carriage. You will take the black horses: the jeweler\nwill accompany you; and you will postpone the supper until Madame de\nBelliere's arrival.\"\n\n\"Will it be necessary to inform Madame de Belliere of it?\" said\nPelisson.\n\n\"No; that will be useless; I will do that. So, away with you, my dear\nfriend.\"\n\nPelisson set off, not quite clear as to his friend's meaning or\nintention, but confident, like every true friend, in the judgment of the\nman he was blindly obeying. It is that which constitutes the strength of\nsuch men; distrust only arises in the minds of inferior natures.\n\nVanel bowed lowly to the superintendent, and was about to begin a\nspeech.\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself, monsieur,\" said Fouquet, politely; \"I am told\nyou wish to purchase a post I hold. How much can you give me for it?\"\n\n\"It is for you, monseigneur, to fix the amount you require. I know that\noffers of purchase have already been made to you for it.\"\n\n\"Madame Vanel, I have been told, values it at fourteen hundred thousand\nlivres.\"\n\n\"That is all we have.\"\n\n\"Can you give me the money immediately?\"\n\n\"I have not the money with me,\" said Vanel, frightened almost by the\nunpretending simplicity, amounting to greatness, of the man, for he had\nexpected disputes, difficulties, opposition of every kind.\n\n\"When will you be able to bring it?\"\n\n\"Whenever you please, monseigneur;\" for he began to be afraid that\nFouquet was trifling with him.\n\n\"If it were not for the trouble you would have in returning to Paris,\nI would say at once; but we will arrange that the payment and the\nsignature shall take place at six o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Vanel, as cold as ice, and feeling quite bewildered.\n\n\"Adieu, Monsieur Vanel, present my humblest respects to Madame Vanel,\"\nsaid Fouquet, as he rose; upon which Vanel, who felt the blood rushing\nto his head, for he was quite confounded by his success, said seriously\nto the superintendent, \"Will you give me your word, monseigneur, upon\nthis affair?\"\n\nFouquet turned round his head, saying, \"_Pardieu_, and you, monsieur?\"\n\nVanel hesitated, trembled all over, and at last finished by hesitatingly\nholding out his hand. Fouquet opened and nobly extended his own; this\nloyal hand lay for a moment in Vanel's most hypocritical palm, and he\npressed it in his own, in order the better to convince himself of the\ncompact. The superintendent gently disengaged his hand, as he again\nsaid, \"Adieu.\" And then Vanel ran hastily to the door, hurried along the\nvestibule, and fled as quickly as he could.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVII. Madame de Belliere's Plate and Diamonds.\n\nFouquet had no sooner dismissed Vanel than he began to reflect for a few\nmoments--\"A man never can do too much for the woman he has once loved.\nMarguerite wishes to be the wife of a procureur-general--and why not\nconfer this pleasure upon her? And, now that the most scrupulous and\nsensitive conscience will be unable to reproach me with anything, let\nmy thoughts be bestowed on her who has shown so much devotion for me.\nMadame de Belliere ought to be there by this time,\" he said, as he\nturned towards the secret door.\n\nAfter he had locked himself in, he opened the subterranean passage, and\nrapidly hastened towards the means of communicating between the house at\nVincennes and his own residence. He had neglected to apprise his friend\nof his approach, by ringing the bell, perfectly assured that she would\nnever fail to be exact at the rendezvous; as, indeed, was the case, for\nshe was already waiting. The noise the superintendent made aroused her;\nshe ran to take from under the door the letter he had thrust there, and\nwhich simply said, \"Come, marquise; we are waiting supper for you.\" With\nher heart filled with happiness Madame de Belliere ran to her carriage\nin the Avenue de Vincennes, and in a few minutes she was holding out her\nhand to Gourville, who was standing at the entrance, where, in order\nthe better to please his master, he had stationed himself to watch her\narrival. She had not observed that Fouquet's black horse arrived at the\nsame time, all steaming and foam-flaked, having returned to Saint-Mande\nwith Pelisson and the very jeweler to whom Madame de Belliere had sold\nher plate and her jewels. Pelisson introduced the goldsmith into the\ncabinet, which Fouquet had not yet left. The superintendent thanked him\nfor having been good enough to regard as a simple deposit in his hands,\nthe valuable property which he had every right to sell; and he cast his\neyes on the total of the account, which amounted to thirteen hundred\nthousand francs. Then, going for a few moments to his desk, he wrote\nan order for fourteen hundred thousand francs, payable at sight, at his\ntreasury, before twelve o'clock the next day.\n\n\"A hundred thousand francs profit!\" cried the goldsmith. \"Oh,\nmonseigneur, what generosity!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, not so, monsieur,\" said Fouquet, touching him on the\nshoulder; \"there are certain kindnesses which can never be repaid. This\nprofit is only what you have earned; but the interest of your money\nstill remains to be arranged.\" And, saying this, he unfastened from his\nsleeve a diamond button, which the goldsmith himself had often valued\nat three thousand pistoles. \"Take this,\" he said to the goldsmith, \"in\nremembrance of me. Farewell; you are an honest man.\"\n\n\"And you, monseigneur,\" cried the goldsmith, completely overcome, \"are\nthe noblest man that ever lived.\"\n\nFouquet let the worthy goldsmith pass out of the room by a secret door,\nand then went to receive Madame de Belliere, who was already surrounded\nby all the guests. The marquise was always beautiful, but now her\nloveliness was more dazzling than ever. \"Do you not think, gentlemen,\"\nsaid Fouquet, \"that madame is more than usually beautiful this evening?\nAnd do you happen to know why?\"\n\n\"Because madame is really the most beautiful of all women,\" said some\none present.\n\n\"No; but because she is the best. And yet--\"\n\n\"Yet?\" said the marquise, smiling.\n\n\"And yet, all the jewels which madame is wearing this evening are\nnothing but false stones.\" At this remark the marquise blushed most\npainfully.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" exclaimed all the guests, \"that can very well be said of one\nwho has the finest diamonds in Paris.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Fouquet to Pelisson, in a low tone.\n\n\"Well, at last I have understood you,\" returned the latter; \"and you\nhave done exceedingly well.\"\n\n\"Supper is ready, monseigneur,\" said Vatel, with majestic air and tone.\n\nThe crowd of guests hurried, more quickly than is usually the case\nwith ministerial entertainments, towards the banqueting-room, where\na magnificent spectacle presented itself. Upon the buffets, upon the\nside-tables, upon the supper-table itself, in the midst of flowers and\nlight, glittered most dazzlingly the richest and most costly gold\nand silver plate that could possibly be seen--relics of those ancient\nmagnificent productions the Florentine artists, whom the Medici family\npatronized, sculptured, chased, and moulded for the purpose of holding\nflowers, at a time when gold existed still in France. These hidden\nmarvels, which had been buried during the civil wars, timidly reappeared\nduring the intervals of that war of good taste called La Fronde; at a\ntime when noblemen fighting against nobleman killed, but did not pillage\neach other. All the plate present had Madame de Belliere's arms engraved\nupon it. \"Look,\" cried La Fontaine, \"here is a P and a B.\"\n\nBut the most remarkable object present was the cover which Fouquet had\nassigned to the marquise. Near her was a pyramid of diamonds, sapphires,\nemeralds, antique cameos, sardonyx stones, carved by the old Greeks of\nAsia Minor, with mountings of Mysian gold; curious mosaics of ancient\nAlexandria, set in silver; massive Egyptian bracelets lay heaped on\na large plate of Palissy ware, supported by a tripod of gilt bronze,\nsculptured by Benvenuto Cellini. The marquise turned pale, as she\nrecognized what she had never expected to see again. A profound silence\nfell on every one of the restless and excited guests. Fouquet did\nnot even make a sign in dismissal of the richly liveried servants who\ncrowded like bees round the huge buffets and other tables in the room.\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"all this plate which you behold once belonged\nto Madame de Belliere, who, having observed one of her friends in great\ndistress, sent all this gold and silver, together with the heap of\njewels now before her, to her goldsmith. This noble conduct of a devoted\nfriend can well be understood by such friends as you. Happy indeed is\nthat man who sees himself loved in such a manner. Let us drink to the\nhealth of Madame de Belliere.\"\n\nA tremendous burst of applause followed his words, and made poor Madame\nde Belliere sink back dumb and breathless in her seat. \"And then,\"\nadded Pelisson, who was always affected by a noble action, as he was\ninvariably impressed by beauty, \"let us also drink to the health of him\nwho inspired madame's noble conduct; for such a man is worthy of being\nworthily loved.\"\n\nIt was now the marquise's turn. She rose, pale and smiling; and as she\nheld out her glass with a faltering hand, and her trembling fingers\ntouched those of Fouquet, her look, full of love, found its mirror in\nthat of her ardent and generous-hearted lover. Begun in this manner, the\nsupper soon became a _fete_; no one tried to be witty, but no one failed\nin being so. La Fontaine forgot his Gorgny wine, and allowed Vatel to\nreconcile him to the wines of the Rhone, and those from the shores of\nSpain. The Abbe Fouquet became so kind and good-natured, that Gourville\nsaid to him, \"Take care, monsieur l'abbe; if you are so tender, you will\nbe carved and eaten.\"\n\nThe hours passed away so joyously, that, contrary to his usual custom,\nthe superintendent did not leave the table before the end of the\ndessert. He smiled upon his friends, delighted as a man is whose heart\nbecomes intoxicated before his head--and, for the first time, looked at\nthe clock. Suddenly a carriage rolled into the courtyard, and, strange\nto say, it was heard high above the noise of the mirth which prevailed.\nFouquet listened attentively, and then turned his eyes towards the\nante-chamber. It seemed as if he could hear a step passing across it,\na step that, instead of pressing the ground, weighed heavily upon\nhis heart. \"M. d'Herblay, bishop of Vannes,\" the usher announced. And\nAramis's grave and thoughtful face appeared upon the threshold of the\ndoor, between the remains of two garlands, of which the flame of a lamp\nhad just burnt the thread that once united them.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVIII. M. de Mazarin's Receipt.\n\nFouquet would have uttered an exclamation of delight on seeing another\nfriend arrive, if the cold air and averted aspect of Aramis had not\nrestored all his reserve. \"Are you going to join us at dessert?\" he\nasked. \"And yet you would be frightened, perhaps, at the noise which our\nwild friends here are making?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Aramis, respectfully, \"I will begin by begging\nyou to excuse me for having interrupted this merry meeting; and then,\nI will beg you to give me, as soon as your pleasure is attended to, a\nmoment's audience on matters of business.\"\n\nAs the word \"business\" had aroused the attention of some of the\nepicureans present, Fouquet rose, saying: \"Business first of all,\nMonsieur d'Herblay; we are too happy when matters of business arrive\nonly at the end of a meal.\"\n\nAs he said this, he took the hand of Madame de Belliere, who looked at\nhim with a kind of uneasiness, and then led her to an adjoining _salon_,\nafter having recommended her to the most reasonable of his guests. And\nthen, taking Aramis by the arm, he led him towards his cabinet. As soon\nas Aramis was there, throwing aside the respectful air he had assumed,\nhe threw himself into a chair, saying: \"Guess whom I have seen this\nevening?\"\n\n\"My dear chevalier, every time you begin in that manner, I am sure to\nhear you announce something disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Well, and this time you will not be mistaken, either, my dear friend,\"\nreplied Aramis.\n\n\"Do not keep me in suspense,\" added Fouquet, phlegmatically.\n\n\"Well, then, I have seen Madame de Chevreuse.\"\n\n\"The old duchesse, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Her ghost, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, no; the old she-wolf herself.\"\n\n\"Without teeth?\"\n\n\"Possibly, but not without claws.\"\n\n\"Well! what harm can she meditate against me? I am no miser with women\nwho are not prudes. A quality always prized, even by the woman who no\nlonger presumes to look for love.\"\n\n\"Madame de Chevreuse knows very well that you are not avaricious, since\nshe wishes to draw some money of you.\"\n\n\"Indeed! under what pretext?\"\n\n\"Oh! pretexts are never wanting with _her_. Let me tell you what it is:\nit seems that the duchesse has a good many letters of M. de Mazarin's in\nher possession.\"\n\n\"I am not surprised at that, for the prelate was gallant enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, but these letters have nothing whatever to do with the prelate's\nlove affairs. They concern, it is said, financial matters rather.\"\n\n\"And accordingly they are less interesting.\"\n\n\"Do you not suspect what I mean?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Have you never heard speak of a prosecution being instituted for an\nembezzlement, or appropriation rather, of public funds?\"\n\n\"Yes, a hundred, nay, a thousand times. Ever since I have been engaged\nin public matters I have hardly heard of anything else. It is precisely\nyour own case, when, as a bishop, people reproach you for impiety; or,\nas a musketeer, for your cowardice; the very thing of which they are\nalways accusing ministers of finance is the embezzlement of public\nfunds.\"\n\n\"Very good; but take a particular instance, for the duchesse asserts\nthat M. de Mazarin alludes to certain particular instances.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Something like a sum of thirteen millions of francs, of which it\nwould be very difficult for you to define the precise nature of the\nemployment.\"\n\n\"Thirteen millions!\" said the superintendent, stretching himself in his\narmchair, in order to enable him the more comfortably to look up towards\nthe ceiling. \"Thirteen millions--I am trying to remember out of all\nthose I have been accused of having stolen.\"\n\n\"Do not laugh, my dear monsieur, for it is very serious. It is positive\nthat the duchesse has certain letters in her possession, and that these\nletters must be as she represents them, since she wished to sell them to\nme for five hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Oh! one can have a very tolerable calumny got up for such a sum as\nthat,\" replied Fouquet. \"Ah! now I know what you mean,\" and he began to\nlaugh very heartily.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Aramis, a little reassured.\n\n\"I remember the story of those thirteen millions now. Yes, yes, I\nremember them quite well.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to hear it; tell me about them.\"\n\n\"Well, then, one day Signor Mazarin, Heaven rest his soul! made a profit\nof thirteen millions upon a concession of lands in the Valtelline; he\ncanceled them in the registry of receipts, sent them to me, and then\nmade me advance them to him for war expenses.\"\n\n\"Very good; then there is no doubt of their proper destination.\"\n\n\"No; the cardinal made me invest them in my own name, and gave me a\nreceipt.\"\n\n\"You have the receipt?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Fouquet, as he quietly rose from his chair, and went\nto his large ebony bureau inlaid with mother-of-pearl and gold.\n\n\"What I most admire in you,\" said Aramis, with an air of great\nsatisfaction, \"is, your memory in the first place, then your\nself-possession, and, finally, the perfect order which prevails in your\nadministration; you, of all men, too, who are by nature a poet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fouquet, \"I am orderly out of a spirit of idleness, to save\nmyself the trouble of looking after things, and so I know that Mazarin's\nreceipt is in the third drawer under the letter M; I open the drawer,\nand place my hand upon the very paper I need. In the night, without a\nlight, I could find it.\"\n\nAnd with a confident hand he felt the bundle of papers which were piled\nup in the open drawer. \"Nay, more than that,\" he continued, \"I remember\nthe paper as if I saw it; it is thick, somewhat crumpled, with gilt\nedges; Mazarin had made a blot upon the figure of the date. Ah!\" he\nsaid, \"the paper knows we are talking about it, and that we want it very\nmuch, and so it hides itself out of the way.\"\n\nAnd as the superintendent looked into the drawer, Aramis rose from his\nseat.\n\n\"This is very singular,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Your memory is treacherous, my dear monseigneur; look in another\ndrawer.\"\n\nFouquet took out the bundle of papers, and turned them over once more;\nhe then grew very pale.\n\n\"Don't confine your search to that drawer,\" said Aramis; \"look\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"Quite useless; I have never made a mistake; no one but myself arranges\nany papers of mine of this nature; no one but myself ever opens this\ndrawer, of which, besides, no one, myself excepted, is aware of the\nsecret.\"\n\n\"What do you conclude, then?\" said Aramis, agitated.\n\n\"That Mazarin's receipt has been stolen from me; Madame de Chevreuse was\nright, chevalier; I have appropriated the public funds, I have robbed\nthe state coffers of thirteen millions of money; I am a thief, Monsieur\nd'Herblay.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, do not get irritated--do not get excited.\"\n\n\"And why not, chevalier? surely there is every reason for it. If legal\nproceedings are well arranged, and a judgment given in accordance with\nthem, your friend the superintendent will soon follow Montfaucon, his\ncolleague Enguerrand de Marigny, and his predecessor, Semblancay.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Aramis, smiling, \"not so fast as that.\"\n\n\"And why not? why not so fast? What do you suppose Madame de Chevreuse\nhas done with those letters--for you refused them, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; at once. I suppose that she went and sold them to M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I said I supposed so; I might have said I was sure of it, for I had her\nfollowed, and, when she left me, she returned to her own house, went out\nby a back door, and proceeded straight to the intendant's house in the\nRue Croix des Petits-Champs.\"\n\n\"Legal proceedings will be instituted, then, scandal and dishonor\nwill follow; and all will fall upon me like a thunderbolt, blindly,\npitilessly.\"\n\nAramis approached Fouquet, who sat trembling in his chair, close to the\nopen drawers; he placed his hand on his shoulder, and in an affectionate\ntone of voice, said: \"Do not forget that the position of M. Fouquet can\nin no way be compared to that of Semblancay or of Marigny.\"\n\n\"And why not, in Heaven's name?\"\n\n\"Because the proceedings against those ministers were determined,\ncompleted, and the sentence carried out, whilst in your case the same\nthing cannot take place.\"\n\n\"Another blow, why not? A peculator is, under any circumstances, a\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"Criminals who know how to find a safe asylum are never in danger.\"\n\n\"What! make my escape? Fly?\"\n\n\"No, I do not mean that; you forget that all such proceedings originate\nin the parliament, that they are instituted by the procureur-general,\nand that you are the procureur-general. You see that, unless you wish to\ncondemn yourself--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Fouquet, suddenly, dashing his fist upon the table.\n\n\"Well! what? what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I am procureur-general no longer.\"\n\nAramis, at this reply, became as livid as death; he pressed his hands\ntogether convulsively, and with a wild, haggard look, which almost\nannihilated Fouquet, he said, laying a stress on every distinct\nsyllable, \"You are procureur-general no longer, do you say?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"Since the last four or five hours.\"\n\n\"Take care,\" interrupted Aramis, coldly; \"I do not think you are in the\nfull possession of your senses, my friend; collect yourself.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" returned Fouquet, \"that a little while ago, some one came\nto me, brought by my friends, to offer me fourteen hundred thousand\nfrancs for the appointment, and that I sold it.\"\n\nAramis looked as though he had been struck by lightning; the intelligent\nand mocking expression of his countenance assumed an aspect of\nsuch profound gloom and terror, that it had more effect upon the\nsuperintendent than all the exclamations and speeches in the world. \"You\nhad need of money, then?\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Yes; to discharge a debt of honor.\" And in a few words, he gave Aramis\nan account of Madame de Belliere's generosity, and the manner in which\nhe had thought it but right to discharge that act of generosity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"that is, indeed, a fine trait. What has it cost?\"\n\n\"Exactly the fourteen hundred thousand francs--the price of my\nappointment.\"\n\n\"Which you received in that manner, without reflection. Oh, imprudent\nman!\"\n\n\"I have not yet received the amount, but I shall to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It is not yet completed, then?\"\n\n\"It must be carried out, though; for I have given the goldsmith, for\ntwelve o'clock to-morrow, an order upon my treasury, into which the\npurchaser's money will be paid at six or seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Heaven be praised!\" cried Aramis, clapping his hands together, \"nothing\nis yet completed, since you have not yet been paid.\"\n\n\"But the goldsmith?\"\n\n\"You shall receive the fourteen hundred thousand francs from me, at a\nquarter before twelve.\"\n\n\"Stay a moment; it is at six o'clock, this very morning, that I am to\nsign.\"\n\n\"Oh! I will answer that you do not sign.\"\n\n\"I have given my word, chevalier.\"\n\n\"If you have given it, you will take it back again, that is all.\"\n\n\"Can I believe what I hear?\" cried Fouquet, in a most expressive tone.\n\"Fouquet recall his word, after it has once been pledged!\"\n\nAramis replied to the almost stern look of the minister by a look full\nof anger. \"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I believe I have deserved to be called a\nman of honor? As a soldier, I have risked my life five hundred times; as\na priest I have rendered still greater services, both to the state and\nto my friends. The value of a word, once passed, is estimated according\nto the worth of the man who gives it. So long as it is in his own\nkeeping, it is of the purest, finest gold; when his wish to keep it\nhas passed away, it is a two-edged sword. With that word, therefore, he\ndefends himself as with an honorable weapon, considering that, when he\ndisregards his word, he endangers his life and incurs an amount of risk\nfar greater than that which his adversary is likely to derive of profit.\nIn such a case, monsieur, he appeals to Heaven and to justice.\"\n\nFouquet bent down his head, as he replied, \"I am a poor, self-determined\nman, a true Breton born; my mind admires and fears yours. I do not say\nthat I keep my word from a proper feeling only; I keep it, if you like,\nfrom custom, practice, pride, or what you will; but, at all events, the\nordinary run of men are simple enough to admire this custom of mine; it\nis my sole good quality--leave me such honor as it confers.\"\n\n\"And so you are determined to sign the sale of the very appointment\nwhich can alone defend you against all your enemies.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall sign.\"\n\n\"You will deliver yourself up, then, bound hand and foot, from a false\nnotion of honor, which the most scrupulous casuists would disdain?\"\n\n\"I shall sign,\" repeated Fouquet.\n\nAramis sighed deeply, and looked all round him with the impatient\ngesture of a man who would gladly dash something to pieces, as a relief\nto his feelings. \"We have still one means left,\" he said; \"and I trust\nyou will not refuse me to make use of that.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, if it be loyal and honorable; as everything is, in fact,\nwhich you propose.\"\n\n\"I know nothing more loyal than the renunciation of your purchaser. Is\nhe a friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Certainly: but--\"\n\n\"'But!'--if you allow me to manage the affair, I do not despair.\"\n\n\"Oh! you shall be absolutely master to do what you please.\"\n\n\"Whom are you in treaty with? What manner of man is it?\"\n\n\"I am not aware whether you know the parliament.\"\n\n\"Most of its members. One of the presidents, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No; only a counselor, of the name of Vanel.\"\n\nAramis became perfectly purple. \"Vanel!\" he cried, rising abruptly from\nhis seat; \"Vanel! the husband of Marguerite Vanel?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Of your former mistress?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear fellow; she is anxious to be the wife of the\nprocureur-general. I certainly owed poor Vanel that slight concession,\nand I am a gainer by it; since I, at the same time, can confer a\npleasure on his wife.\"\n\nAramis walked straight up to Fouquet, and took hold of his hand. \"Do you\nknow,\" he said, very calmly, \"the name of Madame Vanel's new lover?\"\n\n\"Ah! she has a new lover, then? I was not aware of it; no, I have no\nidea what his name is.\"\n\n\"His name is M. Jean-Baptiste Colbert; he is intendant of the finances:\nhe lives in the Rue Croix des Petits-Champs, where Madame de Chevreuse\nhas been this evening to take him Mazarin's letters, which she wishes to\nsell.\"\n\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" murmured Fouquet, passing his hand across his\nforehead, from which the perspiration was starting.\n\n\"You now begin to understand, do you not?\"\n\n\"That I am utterly lost!--yes.\"\n\n\"Do you now think it worth while to be so scrupulous with regard to\nkeeping your word?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"These obstinate people always contrive matters in such a way, that one\ncannot but admire them all the while,\" murmured Aramis.\n\nFouquet held out his hand to him, and, at the very moment, a richly\nornamented tortoise-shell clock, supported by golden figures, which was\nstanding on a console table opposite to the fireplace, struck six. The\nsound of a door being opened in the vestibule was heard, and Gourville\ncame to the door of the cabinet to inquire if Fouquet would received M.\nVanel. Fouquet turned his eyes from the gaze of Aramis, and then desired\nthat M. Vanel should be shown in.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIX. Monsieur Colbert's Rough Draft.\n\nVanel, who entered at this stage of the conversation, was nothing less\nfor Aramis and Fouquet than the full stop which completes a phrase.\nBut, for Vanel, Aramis's presence in Fouquet's cabinet had quite another\nsignification; and, therefore, at his first step into the room, he\npaused as he looked at the delicate yet firm features of the bishop of\nVannes, and his look of astonishment soon became one of scrutinizing\nattention. As for Fouquet, a perfect politician, that is to say,\ncomplete master of himself, he had already, by the energy of his own\nresolute will, contrived to remove from his face all traces of the\nemotion which Aramis's revelation had occasioned. He was no longer,\ntherefore, a man overwhelmed by misfortune and reduced to resort to\nexpedients; he held his head proudly erect, and indicated by a gesture\nthat Vanel could enter. He was now the first minister of the state, and\nin his own palace. Aramis knew the superintendent well; the delicacy of\nthe feelings of his heart and the exalted nature of his mind no longer\nsurprised him. He confined himself, then, for the moment--intending to\nresume later an active part in the conversation--to the performance of\nthe difficult part of a man who looks on and listens, in order to learn\nand understand. Vanel was visibly overcome, and advanced into the middle\nof the cabinet, bowing to everything and everybody. \"I am here,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"You are punctual, Monsieur Vanel,\" returned Fouquet.\n\n\"In matters of business, monseigneur,\" replied Vanel, \"I look upon\nexactitude as a virtue.\"\n\n\"No doubt, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interrupted Aramis, indicating Vanel with his\nfinger, but addressing himself to Fouquet; \"this is the gentleman, I\nbelieve, who has come about the purchase of your appointment?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" replied Vanel, astonished at the extremely haughty tone in\nwhich Aramis had put the question; \"but in what way am I to address you,\nwho do me the honor--\"\n\n\"Call me monseigneur,\" replied Aramis, dryly. Vanel bowed.\n\n\"Come, gentlemen, a truce to these ceremonies; let us proceed to the\nmatter itself.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur sees,\" said Vanel, \"that I am waiting your pleasure.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am waiting,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"What for, may I be permitted to ask, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"I thought that you had perhaps something to say.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Vanel to himself, \"he has reflected on the matter and I\nam lost.\" But resuming his courage, he continued, \"No, monseigneur,\nnothing, absolutely nothing more than what I said to you yesterday, and\nwhich I am again ready to repeat to you now.\"\n\n\"Come, now, tell me frankly, Monsieur Vanel, is not the affair rather a\nburdensome one for you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monseigneur; fourteen hundred thousand francs is an\nimportant sum.\"\n\n\"So important, indeed,\" said Fouquet, \"that I have reflected--\"\n\n\"You have been reflecting, do you say, monseigneur?\" exclaimed Vanel,\nanxiously.\n\n\"Yes; that you might not yet be in a position to purchase.\"\n\n\"Oh, monseigneur!\"\n\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy on that score, Monsieur Vanel; I shall not\nblame you for a failure in your word, which evidently may arise from\ninability on your part.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, monseigneur, you would blame me, and you would be right in\ndoing so,\" said Vanel; \"for a man must either be very imprudent, or a\nfool, to undertake engagements which he cannot keep; and I, at least,\nhave always regarded a thing agreed on as a thing actually carried out.\"\n\nFouquet colored, while Aramis uttered a \"Hum!\" of impatience.\n\n\"You would be wrong to exaggerate such notions as those, monsieur,\" said\nthe superintendent; \"for a man's mind is variable, and full of these\nvery excusable caprices, which are, however, sometimes estimable enough;\nand a man may have wished for something yesterday of which he repents\nto-day.\"\n\nVanel felt a cold sweat trickle down his face. \"Monseigneur!\" he\nmuttered.\n\nAramis, who was delighted to find the superintendent carry on the debate\nwith such clearness and precision, stood leaning his arm upon the marble\ntop of a console table and began to play with a small gold knife, with a\nmalachite handle. Fouquet did not hasten to reply; but after a moment's\npause, \"Come, my dear Monsieur Vanel,\" he said, \"I will explain to you\nhow I am situated.\" Vanel began to tremble.\n\n\"Yesterday I wished to sell--\"\n\n\"Monseigneur did more than wish to sell, he actually sold.\"\n\n\"Well, well, that may be so; but to-day I ask you the favor to restore\nme my word which I pledged you.\"\n\n\"I received your _word_ as a satisfactory assurance that it would be\nkept.\"\n\n\"I know that, and that is the reason why I now entreat you; do you\nunderstand me? I entreat you to restore it to me.\"\n\nFouquet suddenly paused. The words \"I entreat you,\" the effect of\nwhich he did not immediately perceive, seemed almost to choke him as\nhe uttered it. Aramis, still playing with his knife, fixed a look upon\nVanel which seemed as if he wished to penetrate the recesses of his\nheart. Vanel simply bowed, as he said, \"I am overcome, monseigneur, at\nthe honor you do me to consult me upon a matter of business which is\nalready completed; but--\"\n\n\"Nay, do not say _but_, dear Monsieur Vanel.\"\n\n\"Alas! monseigneur, you see,\" he said, as he opened a large pocket-book,\n\"I have brought the money with me,--the whole sum, I mean. And here,\nmonseigneur, is the contract of sale which I have just effected of\na property belonging to my wife. The order is authentic in every\nparticular, the necessary signatures have been attached to it, and it is\nmade payable at sight; it is ready money, in fact, and, in one word, the\nwhole affair is complete.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Vanel, there is not a matter of business in this\nworld, however important it may be, which cannot be postponed in order\nto oblige a man, who, by that means, might and would be made a devoted\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Vanel, awkwardly.\n\n\"And much more justly acquired would that friend become, Monsieur\nVanel, since the value of the service he had received would have been so\nconsiderable. Well, what do you say? what do you decide?\"\n\nVanel preserved a perfect silence. In the meantime, Aramis had continued\nhis close observation of the man. Vanel's narrow face, his deeply sunken\neyes, his arched eyebrows, had revealed to the bishop of Vannes the type\nof an avaricious and ambitious character. Aramis's method was to oppose\none passion by another. He saw that M. Fouquet was defeated--morally\nsubdued--and so he came to his rescue with fresh weapons in his hands.\n\"Excuse me, monseigneur,\" he said; \"you forgot to show M. Vanel that\nhis own interests are diametrically opposed to this renunciation of the\nsale.\"\n\nVanel looked at the bishop with astonishment; he had hardly expected to\nfind an auxiliary in him. Fouquet also paused to listen to the bishop.\n\n\"Do you not see,\" continued Aramis, \"that M. Vanel, in order to purchase\nyour appointment, has been obliged to sell a property belonging to his\nwife; well, that is no slight matter; for one cannot displace, as he\nhas done, fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand francs without some\nconsiderable loss, and very serious inconvenience.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" said Vanel, whose secret Aramis had, with keen-sighted\ngaze, wrung from the bottom of his heart.\n\n\"Inconveniences such as these are matters of great expense and\ncalculation, and whenever a man has money matters to deal with, the\nexpenses are generally the very first thing thought of.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Fouquet, who began to understand Aramis's meaning.\n\nVanel remained perfectly silent; he, too, had understood him. Aramis\nobserved his coldness of manner and his silence. \"Very good,\" he said to\nhimself, \"you are waiting, I see, until you know the amount; but do\nnot fear, I shall send you such a flight of crowns that you cannot but\ncapitulate on the spot.\"\n\n\"We must offer M. Vanel a hundred thousand crowns at once,\" said\nFouquet, carried away by his generous feelings.\n\nThe sum was a good one. A prince, even, would have been satisfied with\nsuch a bonus. A hundred thousand crowns at that period was the dowry of\na king's daughter. Vanel, however, did not move.\n\n\"He is a perfect rascal!\" thought the bishop, \"well, we must offer the\nfive hundred thousand francs at once,\" and he made a sign to Fouquet\naccordingly.\n\n\"You seem to have spent more than that, dear Monsieur Vanel,\" said the\nsuperintendent. \"The price of ready money is enormous. You must have\nmade a great sacrifice in selling your wife's property. Well, what can I\nhave been thinking of? I ought to have offered to sign you an order for\nfive hundred thousand francs; and even in that case I shall feel that I\nam greatly indebted to you.\"\n\nThere was not a gleam of delight or desire on Vanel's face, which\nremained perfectly impassible; not a muscle of it changed in the\nslightest degree. Aramis cast a look almost of despair at Fouquet, and\nthen, going straight up to Vanel and taking hold of him by the coat,\nin a familiar manner, he said, \"Monsieur Vanel, it is neither the\ninconvenience, nor the displacement of your money, nor the sale of your\nwife's property even, that you are thinking of at this moment; it\nis something more important still. I can well understand it; so pay\nparticular attention to what I am going to say.\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" Vanel replied, beginning to tremble in every limb,\nas the prelate's eyes seemed almost ready to devour him.\n\n\"I offer you, therefore, in the superintendent's name, not three hundred\nthousand livres, nor five hundred thousand, but a million. A million--do\nyou understand me?\" he added, as he shook him nervously.\n\n\"A million!\" repeated Vanel, as pale as death.\n\n\"A million; in other words, at the present rate of interest, an income\nof seventy thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Come, monsieur,\" said Fouquet, \"you can hardly refuse that. Answer--do\nyou accept?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" murmured Vanel.\n\nAramis bit his lips, and something like a cloud seemed to pass over his\nface. The thunder behind this cloud could easily be imagined. He still\nkept his hold on Vanel. \"You have purchased the appointment for fifteen\nhundred thousand francs, I think. Well, you will receive these fifteen\nhundred thousand francs back again; by paying M. Fouquet a visit, and\nshaking hands with him on the bargain, you will have become a gainer\nof a million and a half. You get honor and profit at the same time,\nMonsieur Vanel.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it,\" said Vanel, hoarsely.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Aramis, who had grasped Vanel so tightly by the\ncoat that, when he let go his hold, Vanel staggered back a few paces,\n\"very well; one can now see clearly enough your object in coming here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fouquet, \"one can easily see that.\"\n\n\"But--\" said Vanel, attempting to stand erect before the weakness of\nthese two men of honor.\n\n\"Does the fellow presume to speak?\" said Aramis, with the tone of an\nemperor.\n\n\"Fellow!\" repeated Vanel.\n\n\"The scoundrel, I meant to say,\" added Aramis, who had now resumed his\nusual self-possession. \"Come, monsieur, produce your deed of sale,--you\nhave it about you, I suppose, in one of your pockets, already prepared,\nas an assassin holds his pistol or his dagger concealed under his cloak.\"\n\nVanel began to mutter something.\n\n\"Enough!\" cried Fouquet. \"Where is this deed?\"\n\nVanel tremblingly searched in his pockets, and as he drew out his\npocket-book, a paper fell out of it, while Vanel offered the other to\nFouquet. Aramis pounced upon the paper which had fallen out, as soon as\nhe recognized the handwriting. \"I beg your pardon,\" said Vanel, \"that is\na rough draft of the deed.\"\n\n\"I see that very clearly,\" retorted Aramis, with a smile more cutting\nthan a lash of a whip; \"and what I admire most is, that this draft is in\nM. Colbert's handwriting. Look, monseigneur, look.\"\n\nAnd he handed the draft to Fouquet, who recognized the truth of the\nfact; for, covered with erasures, with inserted words, the margins\nfilled with additions, this deed--a living proof of Colbert's plot--had\njust revealed everything to its unhappy victim. \"Well!\" murmured\nFouquet.\n\nVanel, completely humiliated, seemed as if he were looking for some hole\nwherein to hide himself.\n\n\"Well!\" said Aramis, \"if your name were not Fouquet, and if your enemy's\nname were not Colbert--if you had not this mean thief before you, I\nshould say to you, 'Repudiate it;' such a proof as this absolves you\nfrom your word; but these fellows would think you were afraid; they\nwould fear you less than they do; therefore sign the deed at once.\" And\nhe held out a pen towards him.\n\nFouquet pressed Aramis's hand; but, instead of the deed which Vanel\nhanded to him, he took the rough draft of it.\n\n\"No, not that paper,\" said Aramis, hastily; \"this is the one. The other\nis too precious a document for you to part with.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" replied Fouquet; \"I will sign under M. Colbert's own\nhandwriting even; and I write, 'The handwriting is approved of.'\" He\nthen signed, and said, \"Here it is, Monsieur Vanel.\" And the latter\nseized the paper, dashed down the money, and was about to make his\nescape.\n\n\"One moment,\" said Aramis. \"Are you quite sure the exact amount is\nthere? It ought to be counted over, Monsieur Vanel; particularly since\nM. Colbert makes presents of money to ladies, I see. Ah, that worthy M.\nColbert is not so generous as M. Fouquet.\" And Aramis, spelling every\nword, every letter of the order to pay, distilled his wrath and his\ncontempt, drop by drop, upon the miserable wretch, who had to submit\nto this torture for a quarter of an hour. He was then dismissed, not in\nwords, but by a gesture, as one dismisses or discharges a beggar or a\nmenial.\n\nAs soon as Vanel had gone, the minister and the prelate, their eyes\nfixed on each other, remained silent for a few moments.\n\n\"Well,\" said Aramis, the first to break the silence; \"to what can that\nman be compared, who, at the very moment he is on the point of entering\ninto a conflict with an enemy armed from head to foot, panting for his\nlife, presents himself for the contest utterly defenseless, throws down\nhis arms, and smiles and kisses his hands to his adversary in the most\ngracious manner? Good faith, M. Fouquet, is a weapon which scoundrels\nfrequently make use of against men of honor, and it answers their\npurpose. Men of honor, ought, in their turn, also, to make use of\ndishonest means against such scoundrels. You would soon see how strong\nthey would become, without ceasing to be men of honor.\"\n\n\"What they did would be termed the acts of a scoundrel,\" replied\nFouquet.\n\n\"Far from that; it would be merely coquetting or playing with the truth.\nAt all events, since you have finished with this Vanel; since you have\ndeprived yourself of the happiness of confounding him by repudiating\nyour word; and since you have given up, for the purpose of being used\nagainst yourself, the only weapon which can ruin you--\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Fouquet, mournfully, \"you are like the teacher of\nphilosophy whom La Fontaine was telling us about the other day; he saw\na child drowning, and began to read him a lecture divided into three\nheads.\"\n\nAramis smiled as he said, \"Philosophy--yes; teacher--yes; a drowning\nchild--yes; but a child can be saved--you shall see. But first of all\nlet us talk about business. Did you not some time ago,\" he continued, as\nFouquet looked at him with a bewildered air, \"speak to me about an idea\nyou had of giving a _fete_ at Vaux?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Fouquet, \"that was when affairs were flourishing.\"\n\n\"A _fete_, I believe, to which the king invited himself of his own\naccord?\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear prelate; a _fete_ to which M. Colbert advised the king\nto invite himself.\"\n\n\"Ah--exactly; as it would be a _fete_ of so costly a character that you\nwould be ruined in giving it.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. In happier days, as I said just now, I had a kind of\npride in showing my enemies how inexhaustible my resources were; I felt\nit a point of honor to strike them with amazement, by creating millions\nunder circumstances where they imagined nothing but bankruptcies and\nfailures would follow. But, at present, I am arranging my accounts with\nthe state, with the king, with myself; and I must now become a mean,\nstingy man; I shall be able to prove to the world that I can act or\noperate with my deniers as I used to do with my bags of pistoles, and\nfrom to-morrow my equipages shall be sold, my mansions mortgaged, my\nexpenses curtailed.\"\n\n\"From to-morrow,\" interrupted Aramis, quietly, \"you will occupy\nyourself, without the slightest delay, with your _fete_ at Vaux, which\nmust hereafter be spoken of as one of the most magnificent productions\nof your most prosperous days.\"\n\n\"Are you mad, Chevalier d'Herblay?\"\n\n\"I! do you think so?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, then? Do you not know that a _fete_ at Vaux, one of\nthe very simplest possible character, would cost four or five millions?\"\n\n\"I do not speak of a _fete_ of the very simplest possible character, my\ndear superintendent.\"\n\n\"But, since the _fete_ is to be given to the king,\" replied Fouquet, who\nmisunderstood Aramis's idea, \"it cannot be simple.\"\n\n\"Just so: it ought to be on a scale of the most unbounded magnificence.\"\n\n\"In that case, I shall have to spend ten or twelve millions.\"\n\n\"You shall spend twenty, if you require it,\" said Aramis, in a perfectly\ncalm voice.\n\n\"Where shall I get them?\" exclaimed Fouquet.\n\n\"That is my affair, monsieur le surintendant; and do not be uneasy for a\nmoment about it. The money shall be placed at once at your disposal, the\nmoment you have arranged the plans of your _fete_.\"\n\n\"Chevalier! chevalier!\" said Fouquet, giddy with amazement, \"whither are\nyou hurrying me?\"\n\n\"Across the gulf into which you were about to fall,\" replied the bishop\nof Vannes. \"Take hold of my cloak, and throw fear aside.\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me that sooner, Aramis? There was a day when, with\none million only, you could have saved me; whilst to-day--\"\n\n\"Whilst to-day I can give you twenty,\" said the prelate. \"Such is the\ncase, however--the reason is very simple. On the day you speak of, I had\nnot the million which you had need of at my disposal, whilst now I can\neasily procure the twenty millions we require.\"\n\n\"May Heaven hear you, and save me!\"\n\nAramis resumed his usual smile, the expression of which was so singular.\n\"Heaven never fails to hear me,\" he said.\n\n\"I abandon myself to you unreservedly,\" Fouquet murmured.\n\n\"No, no; I do not understand it in that manner. I am unreservedly\ndevoted to you. Therefore, as you have the clearest, the most delicate,\nand the most ingenious mind of the two, you shall have entire control\nover the _fete_, even to the very smallest details. Only--\"\n\n\"Only?\" said Fouquet, as a man accustomed to understand and appreciate\nthe value of a parenthesis.\n\n\"Well, then, leaving the entire invention of the details to you, I shall\nreserve to myself a general superintendence over the execution.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I mean, that you will make of me, on that day, a major-domo, a sort of\ninspector-general, or factotum--something between a captain of the guard\nand manager or steward. I will look after the people, and will keep the\nkeys of the doors. You will give your orders, of course: but will give\nthem to no one but me. They will pass through my lips, to reach those\nfor whom they are intended--you understand?\"\n\n\"No, I am very far from understanding.\"\n\n\"But you agree?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course, my friend.\"\n\n\"That is all I care about, then. Thanks; and now go and prepare your\nlist of invitations.\"\n\n\"Whom shall I invite?\"\n\n\"Everybody you know.\"\n\n\n\nChapter L: In Which the Author Thinks It Is High Time to Return to the\nVicomte de Bragelonne.\n\nOur readers will have observed in this story, the adventures of the new\nand of the past generation being detailed, as it were, side by side. He\nwill have noticed in the former, the reflection of the glory of earlier\nyears, the experience of the bitter things of this world; in the former,\nalso, that peace which takes possession of the heart, and that healing\nof the scars which were formerly deep and painful wounds. In the latter,\nthe conflicts of love and vanity; bitter disappointments, ineffable\ndelights; life instead of memory. If, therefore, any variety has been\npresented to the reader in the different episodes of this tale, it is\nto be attributed to the numerous shades of color which are presented on\nthis double tablet, where two pictures are seen side by side, mingling\nand harmonizing their severe and pleasing tones. The repose of\nthe emotions of one is found in harmonious contrast with the fiery\nsentiments of the other. After having talked reason with older heads,\none loves to talk nonsense with youth. Therefore, if the threads of\nthe story do not seem very intimately to connect the chapter we are\nnow writing with the one we have just written, we do not intend to give\nourselves any more thought or trouble about it than Ruysdael took in\npainting an autumn sky, after having finished a spring-time scene. We\naccordingly resume Raoul de Bragelonne's story at the very place where\nour last sketch left him.\n\nIn a state of frenzy and dismay, or rather without power or will of\nhis own,--hardly knowing what he was doing,--he fled swiftly, after the\nscene in La Valliere's chamber, that strange exclusion, Louise's grief,\nMontalais's terror, the king's wrath--all seemed to indicate some\nmisfortune. But what? He had arrived from London because he had been\ntold of the existence of a danger; and almost on his arrival this\nappearance of danger was manifest. Was not this sufficient for a lover?\nCertainly it was, but it was insufficient for a pure and upright heart\nsuch as his. And yet Raoul did not seek for explanations in the very\nquarter where more jealous or less timid lovers would have done. He did\nnot go straightaway to his mistress, and say, \"Louise, is it true\nthat you love me no longer? Is it true that you love another?\" Full of\ncourage, full of friendship as he was full of love; a religious observer\nof his word, and believing blindly the word of others, Raoul said within\nhimself, \"Guiche wrote to put me on my guard, Guiche knows something;\nI will go and ask Guiche what he knows, and tell him what I have seen.\"\nThe journey was not a long one. Guiche, who had been brought from\nFontainebleau to Paris within the last two days, was beginning to\nrecover from his wounds, and to walk about a little in his room. He\nuttered a cry of joy as he saw Raoul, with the eagerness of friendship,\nenter the apartment. Raoul was unable to refrain from a cry of grief,\nwhen he saw De Guiche, so pale, so thin, so melancholy. A very few\nwords, and a simple gesture which De Guiche made to put aside Raoul's\narm, were sufficient to inform the latter of the truth.\n\n\"Ah! so it is,\" said Raoul, seating himself beside his friend; \"one\nloves and dies.\"\n\n\"No, no, not dies,\" replied Guiche, smiling, \"since I am now recovering,\nand since, too, I can press you in my arms.\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand.\"\n\n\"And I understand you, too. You fancy I am unhappy, Raoul?\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\n\"No; I am the happiest of men. My body suffers, but not my mind or my\nheart. If you only knew--Oh! I am, indeed, the very happiest of men.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Raoul; \"so much the better, provided it\nlasts.\"\n\n\"It is over. I have had enough happiness to last me to my dying day,\nRaoul.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you have had; but she--\"\n\n\"Listen; I love her, because--but you are not listening to me.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Your mind is preoccupied.\"\n\n\"Yes, your health, in the first place--\"\n\n\"It is not that, I know.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, you would be wrong. I think, to ask me any\nquestions--_you_ of all persons in the world;\" and he laid so much\nweight upon the \"you,\" that he completely enlightened his friend upon\nthe nature of the evil, and the difficulty of remedying it.\n\n\"You say that, Raoul, on account of what I wrote to you.\"\n\n\"Certainly. We will talk over that matter a little, when you have\nfinished telling me of all your own pleasures and your pains.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, I am entirely at your service.\"\n\n\"Thank you; I have hurried, I have flown here; I came in half the time\nthe government couriers usually take. Now, tell me, my dear friend, what\ndid you want?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever, but to make you come.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am here.\"\n\n\"All is quite right, then.\"\n\n\"There must have been something else, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"De Guiche!\"\n\n\"Upon my honor!\"\n\n\"You cannot possibly have crushed all my hopes so violently, or have\nexposed me to being disgraced by the king for my return, which is in\ndisobedience of his orders--you cannot, I say, have planted jealousy in\nmy heart, merely to say to me, 'It is all right, be perfectly easy.'\"\n\n\"I do not say to you, Raoul, 'Be perfectly easy;' but pray understand\nme; I never will, nor can I, indeed, tell you anything else.\"\n\n\"What sort of person do you take me for?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If you know anything, why conceal it from me? If you do not know\nanything, why did you write so warningly?\"\n\n\"True, true, I was very wrong, and I regret having done so, Raoul. It\nseems nothing to write to a friend and say 'Come;' but to have this\nfriend face to face, to feel him tremble, and breathlessly and anxiously\nwait to hear what one hardly dare tell him, is very difficult.\"\n\n\"Dare! I have courage enough, if you have not,\" exclaimed Raoul, in\ndespair.\n\n\"See how unjust you are, and how soon you forget you have to do with a\npoor wounded fellow such as your unhappy friend is. So, calm yourself,\nRaoul. I said to you, 'Come'--you are here, so ask me nothing further.\"\n\n\"Your object in telling me to come was your hope that I should see with\nmy own eyes, was it not? Nay, do not hesitate, for I have seen all.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed De Guiche.\n\n\"Or at least I thought--\"\n\n\"There, now, you see you are not sure. But if you have any doubt, my\npoor friend, what remains for me to do?\"\n\n\"I saw Louise much agitated--Montalais in a state of bewilderment--the\nking--\"\n\n\"The king?\"\n\n\"Yes. You turn your head aside. The danger is there, the evil is there;\ntell me, is it not so, is it not the king?\"\n\n\"I say nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh! you say a thousand times more than nothing. Give me facts,\nfor pity's sake, give me proofs. My friend, the only friend I have,\nspeak--tell me all. My heart is crushed, wounded to death; I am dying\nfrom despair.\"\n\n\"If that really be so, as I see it is, indeed, dear Raoul,\" replied De\nGuiche, \"you relieve me from my difficulty, and I will tell you all,\nperfectly sure that I can tell you nothing but what is consoling,\ncompared to the despair from which I see you suffering.\"\n\n\"Go on,--go on; I am listening.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I can only tell you what you might learn from every one you\nmeet.\"\n\n\"From every one, do you say? It is talked about, then!\"\n\n\"Before you say people talk about it, learn what it is that people have\nto talk about. I assure you solemnly, that people only talk about what\nmay, in truth, be very innocent; perhaps a walk--\"\n\n\"Ah! a walk with the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, a walk with the king; and I believe the king has\nalready very frequently before taken walks with ladies, without on that\naccount--\"\n\n\"You would not have written to me, shall I say again, if there had been\nnothing unusual in this promenade.\"\n\n\"I know that while the storm lasted, it would have been far better if\nthe king had taken shelter somewhere else, than to have remained with\nhis head uncovered before La Valliere; but the king is so very courteous\nand polite.\"\n\n\"Oh! De Guiche, De Guiche, you are killing me!\"\n\n\"Do not let us talk any more, then.\"\n\n\"Nay, let us continue. This walk was followed by others, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No--I mean yes: there was the adventure of the oak, I think. But I know\nnothing about the matter at all.\" Raoul rose; De Guiche endeavored to\nimitate him, notwithstanding his weakness. \"Well, I will not add another\nword: I have said either too much or not enough. Let others give you\nfurther information if they will, or if they can; my duty was to warn\nyou, and _that_ I have done. Watch over your own affairs now, yourself.\"\n\n\"Question others! Alas! you are no true friend to speak to me in that\nmanner,\" said the young man, in utter distress. \"The first man I meet\nmay be either evilly disposed or a fool,--if the former, he will tell\nme a lie to make me suffer more than I do now; if the latter, he will\ndo worse still. Ah! De Guiche, De Guiche, before two hours are over, I\nshall have been told ten falsehoods, and shall have as many duels on my\nhands. Save me, then; is it not best to know the worst always?\"\n\n\"But I know nothing, I tell you; I was wounded, attacked by fever: out\nof my senses; and I have only a very faint recollection of it all. But\nthere is no reason why we should search very far, when the very man we\nwant is close at hand. Is not D'Artagnan your friend?\"\n\n\"Oh! true, true!\"\n\n\"Got to him, then. He will be able to throw sufficient light upon the\nsubject.\" At this moment a lackey entered the room. \"What is it?\" said\nDe Guiche.\n\n\"Some one is waiting for monseigneur in the Cabinet des Porcelaines.\"\n\n\"Very well. Will you excuse me, my dear Raoul? I am so proud since I\nhave been able to walk again.\"\n\n\"I would offer you my arm, De Guiche, if I did not guess that the person\nin question is a lady.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said De Guiche, smiling as he quitted Raoul.\n\nRaoul remained motionless, absorbed in grief, overwhelmed, like the\nminer upon whom a vault has just fallen in, who, wounded, his life-blood\nwelling fast, his thoughts confused, endeavors to recover himself, to\nsave his life and to retain his reason. A few minutes were all Raoul\nneeded to dissipate the bewildering sensations occasioned by these two\nrevelations. He had already recovered the thread of his ideas, when,\nsuddenly, through the door, he fancied he recognized Montalais's voice\nin the Cabinet des Porcelaines. \"She!\" he cried. \"Yes, it is indeed her\nvoice! She will be able to tell me the whole truth; but shall I question\nher here? She conceals herself even from me; she is coming, no doubt,\nfrom Madame. I will see her in her own apartment. She will explain her\nalarm, her flight, the strange manner in which I was driven out; she\nwill tell me all that--after M. d'Artagnan, who knows everything, shall\nhave given me a fresh strength and courage. Madame, a coquette I fear,\nand yet a coquette who is herself in love, has her moments of kindness;\na coquette who is as capricious and uncertain as life or death, but who\ntells De Guiche that he is the happiest of men. He at least is lying on\nroses.\" And so he hastily quitted the comte's apartments, reproaching\nhimself as he went for having talked of nothing but his own affairs to\nDe Guiche, and soon reached D'Artagnan's quarters.\n\n\n\nChapter LI. Bragelonne Continues His Inquiries.\n\nThe captain, sitting buried in his leathern armchair, his spurs fixed in\nthe floor, his sword between his legs, was reading a number of letters,\nas he twisted his mustache. D'Artagnan uttered a welcome full of\npleasure when he perceived his friend's son. \"Raoul, my boy,\" he said,\n\"by what lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you?\"\n\nThese words did not sound agreeably in the young man's ears, who, as\nhe seated himself, replied, \"Upon my word I cannot tell you; all that I\nknow is--I have come back.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said D'Artagnan, folding up his letters and directing a look\nfull of meaning at him; \"what do you say, my boy? that the king has not\nrecalled you, and you have returned? I do not understand that at all.\"\n\nRaoul was already pale enough; and he now began to turn his hat round\nand round in his hand.\n\n\"What the deuce is the matter that you look as you do, and what makes\nyou so dumb?\" said the captain. \"Do people nowadays assume that sort of\nairs in England? I have been in England, and came here again as lively\nas a chaffinch. Will you not say something?\"\n\n\"I have too much to say.\"\n\n\"Ah! how is your father?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, my dear friend, I was going to ask you that.\"\n\nD'Artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze, which no\nsecret was capable of resisting. \"You are unhappy about something,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I am, indeed; and you know the reason very well, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Of course. Nay, do not pretend to be astonished.\"\n\n\"I am not pretending to be astonished, my friend.\"\n\n\"Dear captain, I know very well that in all trials of _finesse_, as well\nas in all trials of strength, I shall be beaten by you. You can see that\nat the present moment I am an idiot, an absolute noodle. I have neither\nhead nor arm; do not despise, but help me. In two words, I am the most\nwretched of living beings.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! why that?\" inquired D'Artagnan, unbuckling his belt and thawing\nthe asperity of his smile.\n\n\"Because Mademoiselle de la Valliere is deceiving me.\"\n\n\"She is deceiving you,\" said D'Artagnan, not a muscle of whose face had\nmoved; \"those are big words. Who makes use of them?\"\n\n\"Every one.\"\n\n\"Ah! if every one says so, there must be some truth in it. I begin to\nbelieve there is fire when I see smoke. It is ridiculous, perhaps, but\nit is so.\"\n\n\"Therefore you _do_ believe me?\" exclaimed Bragelonne, quickly.\n\n\"I never mix myself up in affairs of that kind; you know that very\nwell.\"\n\n\"What! not for a friend, for a son!\"\n\n\"Exactly. If you were a stranger, I should tell you--I will tell _you_\nnothing at all. How is Porthos, do you know?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" cried Raoul, pressing D'Artagnan's hand, \"I entreat you in\nthe name of the friendship you vowed my father!\"\n\n\"The deuce take it, you are really ill--from curiosity.\"\n\n\"No, it is not from curiosity, it is from love.\"\n\n\"Good. Another big word. If you were really in love, my dear Raoul, you\nwould be very different.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that if you were really so deeply in love that I could believe I\nwas addressing myself to your heart--but it is impossible.\"\n\n\"I tell you I love Louise to distraction.\"\n\nD'Artagnan could read to the very bottom of the young man's heart.\n\n\"Impossible, I tell you,\" he said. \"You are like all young men; you are\nnot in love, you are out of your senses.\"\n\n\"Well! suppose it were only that?\"\n\n\"No sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head\nwas turned. I have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred\ntimes in my life. You would listen to me, but you would not hear me! you\nwould hear, but you would not understand me; you would understand, but\nyou would not obey me.\"\n\n\"Oh! try, try.\"\n\n\"I go far. Even if I were unfortunate enough to know something, and\nfoolish enough to communicate it to you--You are my friend, you say?\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes.\"\n\n\"Very good. I should quarrel with you. You would never forgive me for\nhaving destroyed your illusion, as people say in love affairs.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, you know all; and yet you plunge me in perplexity\nand despair, in death itself.\"\n\n\"There, there now.\"\n\n\"I never complain, as you know; but as Heaven and my father would never\nforgive me for blowing out my brains, I will go and get the first person\nI meet to give me the information which you withhold; I will tell him he\nlies, and--\"\n\n\"And you would kill him. And a fine affair that would be. So much the\nbetter. What should I care? Kill any one you please, my boy, if it gives\nyou any pleasure. It is exactly like a man with a toothache, who keeps\non saying, 'Oh! what torture I am suffering. I could bite a piece of\niron in half.' My answer always is, 'Bite, my friend, bite; the tooth\nwill remain all the same.'\"\n\n\"I shall not kill any one, monsieur,\" said Raoul, gloomily.\n\n\"Yes, yes! you now assume a different tone: instead of killing, you will\nget killed yourself, I suppose you mean? Very fine, indeed! How much\nI should regret you! Of course I should go about all day, saying, 'Ah!\nwhat a fine stupid fellow that Bragelonne was! as great a stupid as I\never met with. I have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how\nto hold and use his sword properly, and the silly fellow has got himself\nspitted like a lark.' Go, then, Raoul, go and get yourself disposed of,\nif you like. I hardly know who can have taught you logic, but deuce take\nme if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money.\"\n\nRaoul buried his face in his hands, murmuring: \"No, no; I have not a\nsingle friend in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh! bah!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I meet with nothing but raillery or indifference.\"\n\n\"Idle fancies, monsieur. I do not laugh at you, although I am a Gascon.\nAnd, as for being indifferent, if I were so, I should have sent you\nabout your business a quarter of an hour ago, for you would make a man\nwho was out of his senses with delight as dull as possible, and would be\nthe death of one who was out of spirits. How now, young man! do you wish\nme to disgust you with the girl you are attached to, and to teach you to\nexecrate the whole sex who constitute the honor and happiness of human\nlife?\"\n\n\"Oh! tell me, monsieur, and I will bless you.\"\n\n\"Do you think, my dear fellow, that I can have crammed into my brain all\nabout the carpenter, and the painter, and the staircase, and a hundred\nother similar tales of the same kind?\"\n\n\"A carpenter! what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know; some one told me there was a carpenter who\nmade an opening through a certain flooring.\"\n\n\"In La Valliere's room!\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know where.\"\n\n\"In the king's apartment, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Of course, if it were in the king's apartment, I should tell you, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"In whose room, then?\"\n\n\"I have told you for the last hour that I know nothing of the whole\naffair.\"\n\n\"But the painter, then? the portrait--\"\n\n\"It seems that the king wished to have the portrait of one of the ladies\nbelonging to the court.\"\n\n\"La Valliere?\"\n\n\"Why, you seem to have only that name in your mouth. Who spoke to you of\nLa Valliere?\"\n\n\"If it be not her portrait, then, why do you suppose it would concern\nme?\"\n\n\"I do not suppose it will concern you. But you ask me all sorts of\nquestions, and I answer you. You positively will learn all the scandal\nof the affair, and I tell you--make the best you can of it.\"\n\nRaoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair. \"It will kill\nme!\" he said.\n\n\"So you have said already.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" and he made a step or two, as if he were going to\nleave.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To look for some one who will tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"A woman.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere herself, I suppose you mean?\" said\nD'Artagnan, with a smile. \"Ah! a famous idea that! You wish to be\nconsoled by some one, and you will be so at once. She will tell you\nnothing ill of herself, of course. So be off.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, monsieur,\" replied Raoul; \"the woman I mean will tell\nme all the evil she possibly can.\"\n\n\"You allude to Montalais, I suppose--her friend; a woman who, on that\naccount, will exaggerate all that is either bad or good in the matter.\nDo not talk to Montalais, my good fellow.\"\n\n\"You have some reasons for wishing me not to talk with Montalais?\"\n\n\"Well, I admit it. And, in point of fact, why should I play with you as\na cat does with a poor mouse? You distress me, you do, indeed. And if I\nwish you not to speak to Montalais just now, it is because you will be\nbetraying your secret, and people will take advantage of it. Wait, if\nyou can.\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"So much the worse. Why, you see, Raoul, if I had an idea,--but I have\nnot got one.\"\n\n\"Promise me that you will pity me, my friend, that is all I need, and\nleave me to get out of the affair by myself.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, indeed, in order that you may get deeper into the mire! A\ncapital idea, truly! go and sit down at that table and take a pen in\nyour hand.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To write and ask Montalais to give you an interview.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Raoul, snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held\nout to him.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and one of the musketeers, approaching\nD'Artagnan, said, \"Captain, Mademoiselle de Montalais is here, and\nwishes to speak to you.\"\n\n\"To me?\" murmured D'Artagnan. \"Ask her to come in; I shall soon see,\" he\nsaid to himself, \"whether she wishes to speak to me or not.\"\n\nThe cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions; for as soon as\nMontalais entered she exclaimed, \"Oh, monsieur! monsieur! I beg your\npardon, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Oh! I forgive you, mademoiselle,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I know that, at\nmy age, those who are looking for me generally need me for something or\nanother.\"\n\n\"I was looking for M. de Bragelonne,\" replied Montalais.\n\n\"How very fortunate that is; he was looking for you, too. Raoul, will\nyou accompany Mademoiselle de Montalais?\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly.\"\n\n\"Go along, then,\" he said, as he gently pushed Raoul out of the cabinet;\nand then, taking hold of Montalais's hand, he said, in a low voice, \"Be\nkind towards him; spare him, and spare her, too, if you can.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, in the same tone of voice, \"it is not I who am going to\nspeak to him.\"\n\n\"Who, then?\"\n\n\"It is Madame who has sent for him.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"it is Madame, is it? In an hour's time,\nthen, the poor fellow will be cured.\"\n\n\"Or else dead,\" said Montalais, in a voice full of compassion. \"Adieu,\nMonsieur d'Artagnan,\" she said; and she ran to join Raoul, who was\nwaiting for her at a little distance from the door, very much puzzled\nand thoroughly uneasy at the dialogue, which promised no good augury for\nhim.\n\n\n\nChapter LII. Two Jealousies.\n\nLovers are tender towards everything that forms part of the daily life\nof the object of their affection. Raoul no sooner found himself alone\nwith Montalais, than he kissed her hand with rapture. \"There, there,\"\nsaid the young girl, sadly, \"you are throwing your kisses away; I will\nguarantee that they will not bring you back any interest.\"\n\n\"How so?--Why?--Will you explain to me, my dear Aure?\"\n\n\"Madame will explain everything to you. I am going to take you to her\napartments.\n\n\"_What!_\"\n\n\"Silence! and throw away your dark and savage looks. The windows here\nhave eyes, the walls have ears. Have the kindness not to look at me any\nlonger; be good enough to speak to me aloud of the rain, of the fine\nweather, and of the charms of England.\"\n\n\"At all events--\" interrupted Raoul.\n\n\"I tell you, I warn you, that wherever people may be, I know not how,\nMadame is sure to have eyes and ears open. I am not very desirous, you\ncan easily believe, of being dismissed or thrown in to the Bastile. Let\nus talk, I tell you, or rather, do not let us talk at all.\"\n\nRaoul clenched his hands, and tried to assume the look and gait of a\nman of courage, it is true, but of a man of courage on his way to the\ntorture chamber. Montalais, glancing in every direction, walking along\nwith an easy swinging gait, and holding up her head pertly in the air,\npreceded him to Madame's apartments, where he was at once introduced.\n\"Well,\" he thought, \"this day will pass away without my learning\nanything. Guiche showed too much consideration for my feelings; he had\nno doubt come to an understanding with Madame, and both of them, by a\nfriendly plot, agreed to postpone the solution of the problem. Why\nhave I not a determined, inveterate enemy--that serpent, De Wardes, for\ninstance; that he would bite, is very likely; but I should not hesitate\nany more. To hesitate, to doubt--better, far, to die.\"\n\nThe next moment Raoul was in Madame's presence. Henrietta, more charming\nthan ever, was half lying, half reclining in her armchair, her small\nfeet upon an embroidered velvet cushion; she was playing with a kitten\nwith long silky fur, which was biting her fingers and hanging by the\nlace of her collar.\n\nMadame seemed plunged in deep thought, so deep, indeed, that it required\nboth Montalais and Raoul's voice to disturb her from her reverie.\n\n\"Your highness sent for me?\" repeated Raoul.\n\nMadame shook her head as if she were just awakening, and then said,\n\"Good morning, Monsieur de Bragelonne; yes, I sent for you; so you have\nreturned from England?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, and am at your royal highness's commands.\"\n\n\"Thank you; leave us, Montalais,\" and the latter immediately left the\nroom.\n\n\"You have a few minutes to give me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, have you\nnot?\"\n\n\"My life is at your royal highness's disposal,\" Raoul returned with\nrespect, guessing that there was something serious in these unusual\ncourtesies; nor was he displeased, indeed, to observe the seriousness\nof her manner, feeling persuaded that there was some sort of affinity\nbetween Madame's sentiments and his own. In fact, every one at court,\nof any perception at all, knew perfectly well the capricious fancy and\nabsurd despotism of the princess's singular character. Madame had\nbeen flattered beyond all bounds by the king's attention; she had\nmade herself talked about; she had inspired the queen with that mortal\njealousy which is the stinging scorpion at the heel of every woman's\nhappiness; Madame, in a word, in her attempts to cure a wounded pride,\nfound that her heart had become deeply and passionately attached. We\nknow what Madame had done to recall Raoul, who had been sent out of\nthe way by Louis XIV. Raoul did not know of her letter to Charles II.,\nalthough D'Artagnan had guessed its contents. Who will undertake to\naccount for that seemingly inexplicable mixture of love and vanity, that\npassionate tenderness of feeling, that prodigious duplicity of conduct?\nNo one can, indeed; not even the bad angel who kindles the love of\ncoquetry in the heart of a woman. \"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" said the\nprincess, after a moment's pause, \"have you returned satisfied?\"\n\nBragelonne looked at Madame Henrietta, and seeing how pale she was, not\nalone from what she was keeping back, but also from what she was burning\nto say, said: \"Satisfied! what is there for me to be satisfied or\ndissatisfied about, Madame?\"\n\n\"But what are those things with which a man of your age, and of your\nappearance, is usually either satisfied or dissatisfied?\"\n\n\"How eager she is,\" thought Raoul, almost terrified; \"what venom is it\nshe is going to distil into my heart?\" and then, frightened at what\nshe might possibly be going to tell him, and wishing to put off the\nopportunity of having everything explained, which he had hitherto so\nardently wished for, yet had dreaded so much, he replied: \"I left,\nMadame, a dear friend in good health, and on my return I find him very\nill.\"\n\n\"You refer to M. de Guiche,\" replied Madame Henrietta, with\nimperturbable self-possession; \"I _have_ heard he is a very dear friend\nof yours.\"\n\n\"He is, indeed, Madame.\"\n\n\"Well, it is quite true he has been wounded; but he is better now.\nOh! M. de Guiche is not to be pitied,\" she said hurriedly; and then,\nrecovering herself, added, \"But has he anything to complain of? Has he\ncomplained of anything? Is there any cause of grief or sorrow that we\nare not acquainted with?\"\n\n\"I allude only to his wound, Madame.\"\n\n\"So much the better, then, for, in other respects, M. de Guiche seems\nto be very happy; he is always in very high spirits. I am sure that you,\nMonsieur de Bragelonne, would far prefer to be, like him, wounded only\nin the body... for what, in deed, is such a wound, after all!\"\n\nRaoul started. \"Alas!\" he said to himself, \"she is returning to it.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I did not say anything Madame.\"\n\n\"You did not say anything; you disapprove of my observation, then? you\nare perfectly satisfied, I suppose?\"\n\nRaoul approached closer to her. \"Madame,\" he said, \"your royal highness\nwishes to say something to me, and your instinctive kindness and\ngenerosity of disposition induce you to be careful and considerate as\nto your manner of conveying it. Will your royal highness throw this kind\nforbearance aside? I am able to bear everything; and I am listening.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Henrietta, \"what do you understand, then?\"\n\n\"That which your royal highness wishes me to understand,\" said Raoul,\ntrembling, notwithstanding his command over himself, as he pronounced\nthese words.\n\n\"In point of fact,\" murmured the princess... \"it seems cruel, but since I\nhave begun--\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, once your highness has deigned to begin, will you\ncondescend to finish--\"\n\nHenrietta rose hurriedly and walked a few paces up and down her room.\n\"What did M. de Guiche tell you?\" she said, suddenly.\n\n\"Nothing, Madame.\"\n\n\"Nothing! Did he say nothing? Ah! how well I recognize him in that.\"\n\n\"No doubt he wished to spare me.\"\n\n\"And that is what friends call friendship. But surely, M. d'Artagnan,\nwhom you have just left, must have told you.\"\n\n\"No more than De Guiche, Madame.\"\n\nHenrietta made a gesture full of impatience, as she said, \"At least, you\nknow all the court knows.\"\n\n\"I know nothing at all, Madame.\"\n\n\"Not the scene in the storm?\"\n\n\"No, Madame.\"\n\n\"Not the _tete-a-tete_ in the forest?\"\n\n\"No, Madame.\"\n\n\"Nor the flight to Chaillot?\"\n\nRaoul, whose head dropped like a blossom cut down by the reaper, made\nan almost superhuman effort to smile, as he replied with the greatest\ngentleness: \"I have had the honor of telling your royal highness that\nI am absolutely ignorant of everything, that I am a poor unremembered\noutcast, who has this moment arrived from England. There have rolled so\nmany stormy waves between myself and those I left behind me here, that\nthe rumor of none of the circumstances your highness refers to, has been\nable to reach me.\"\n\nHenrietta was affected by his extreme pallor, his gentleness, and his\ngreat courage. The principal feeling in her heart at that moment was an\neager desire to hear the nature of the remembrance which the poor lover\nretained of the woman who had made him suffer so much. \"Monsieur de\nBragelonne,\" she said, \"that which your friends have refused to do, I\nwill do for you, whom I like and esteem very much. I will be your friend\non this occasion. You hold your head high, as a man of honor should; and\nI deeply regret that you may have to bow before ridicule, and in a few\ndays, it might be, contempt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Raoul, perfectly livid. \"It is as bad as that, then?\"\n\n\"If you do not know,\" said the princess, \"I see that you guess; you were\naffianced, I believe, to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"By that right, you deserve to be warned about her, as some day or\nanother I shall be obliged to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from\nmy service--\"\n\n\"Dismiss La Valliere!\" cried Bragelonne.\n\n\"Of course. Do you suppose I shall always be amenable to the tears and\nprotestations of the king? No, no! my house shall no longer be made a\nconvenience for such practices; but you tremble, you cannot stand--\"\n\n\"No, Madame, no,\" said Bragelonne, making an effort over himself; \"I\nthought I should have died just now, that was all. Your royal highness\ndid me the honor to say that the king wept and implored you--\"\n\n\"Yes, but in vain,\" returned the princess; who then related to Raoul the\nscene that took place at Chaillot, and the king's despair on his return;\nshe told him of his indulgence to herself and the terrible word with\nwhich the outraged princess, the humiliated coquette, had quashed the\nroyal anger.\n\nRaoul stood with his head bent down.\n\n\"What do you think of it all?\" she said.\n\n\"The king loves her,\" he replied.\n\n\"But you seem to think she does not love him!\"\n\n\"Alas, Madame, I was thinking of the time when she loved _me_.\"\n\nHenrietta was for a moment struck with admiration at this sublime\ndisbelief: and then, shrugging her shoulders, she said, \"You do not\nbelieve me, I see. How deeply you must love her. And you doubt if she\nloves the king?\"\n\n\"I do, until I have a proof of it. Forgive me, Madame, but she has\ngiven me her word; and her mind and heart are too upright to tell a\nfalsehood.\"\n\n\"You require a proof! Be it so. Come with me, then.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LIII. A Domiciliary Visit.\n\nThe princess, preceding Raoul, led him through the courtyard towards\nthat part of the building La Valliere inhabited, and, ascending the same\nstaircase which Raoul himself had ascended that very morning, she paused\nat the door of the room in which the young man had been so strangely\nreceived by Montalais. The opportunity was remarkably well chosen to\ncarry out the project Madame Henrietta had conceived, for the chateau\nwas empty. The king, the courtiers, and the ladies of the court, had\nset off for Saint-Germain; Madame Henrietta was the only one who knew\nof Bragelonne's return, and thinking over the advantages which might be\ndrawn from this return, she had feigned indisposition in order to remain\nbehind. Madame was therefore confident of finding La Valliere's room and\nSaint-Aignan's apartment perfectly empty. She took a pass-key from\nher pocket and opened the door of her maid of honor's apartment.\nBragelonne's gaze was immediately fixed upon the interior of the room,\nwhich he recognized at once; and the impression which the sight of\nit produced upon him was torture. The princess looked at him, and her\npracticed eye at once detected what was passing in the young man's\nheart.\n\n\"You asked for proofs,\" she said; \"do not be astonished, then, if I give\nyou them. But if you do not think you have courage enough to confront\nthem, there is still time to withdraw.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Madame,\" said Bragelonne; \"but I came here to be\nconvinced. You promised to convince me,--do so.\"\n\n\"Enter, then,\" said Madame, \"and shut the door behind you.\"\n\nBragelonne obeyed, and then turned towards the princess, whom he\ninterrogated by a look.\n\n\"You know where you are, I suppose?\" inquired Madame Henrietta.\n\n\"Everything leads me to believe I am in Mademoiselle de la Valliere's\nroom.\"\n\n\"You are.\"\n\n\"But I would observe to your highness, that this room is a room, and is\nnot a proof.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said the princess, as she walked to the foot of the bed, folded\nup the screen into its several compartments, and stooped down towards\nthe floor. \"Look here,\" she continued; \"stoop down and lift up this\ntrap-door yourself.\"\n\n\"A trap-door!\" said Raoul, astonished; for D'Artagnan's words began\nto return to his memory, and he had an indistinct recollection that\nD'Artagnan had made use of the same word. He looked, but uselessly,\nfor some cleft or crevice which might indicate an opening or a ring to\nassist in lifting up the planking.\n\n\"Ah, I forgot,\" said Madame Henrietta, \"I forgot the secret spring; the\nfourth plank of the flooring,--press on the spot where you will observe\na knot in the wood. Those are the instructions; press, vicomte! press, I\nsay, yourself.\"\n\nRaoul, pale as death, pressed his finger on the spot which had been\nindicated to him; at the same moment the spring began to work, and the\ntrap rose of its own accord.\n\n\"It is ingenious enough, certainly,\" said the princess; \"and one can see\nthat the architect foresaw that a woman's hand only would have to make\nuse of this spring, for see how easily the trap-door opened without\nassistance.\"\n\n\"A staircase!\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, and a very pretty one, too,\" said Madame Henrietta. \"See, vicomte,\nthe staircase has a balustrade, intended to prevent the falling of timid\npersons, who might be tempted to descend the staircase; and I will risk\nmyself on it accordingly. Come, vicomte, follow me!\"\n\n\"But before following you, madame, may I ask where this staircase leads\nto?\"\n\n\"Ah, true; I forgot to tell you. You know, perhaps, that formerly M. de\nSaint-Aignan lived in the very next apartment to the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, I am aware of that; that was the arrangement, at least,\nbefore I left; and more than once I had the honor of visiting his\nrooms.\"\n\n\"Well, he obtained the king's leave to change his former convenient\nand beautiful apartment for the two rooms to which this staircase will\nconduct us, and which together form a lodging for him half the size, and\nat ten times greater the distance from the king,--a close proximity to\nwhom is by no means disdained, in general, by the gentlemen belonging to\nthe court.\"\n\n\"Very good, Madame,\" returned Raoul; \"but go on, I beg, for I do not\nunderstand yet.\"\n\n\"Well, then it accidentally happened,\" continued the princess, \"that M.\nde Saint-Aignan's apartment is situated underneath the apartments of\nmy maids of honor, and by a further coincidence, exactly underneath the\nroom of La Valliere.\"\n\n\"But what was the motive of this trap-door and this staircase?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell you. Would you like to go down to Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan's rooms? Perhaps we shall be able to find the solution of\nthe enigma there.\"\n\nAnd Madame set the example by going down herself, while Raoul, sighing\ndeeply, followed her. At every step Bragelonne took, he advanced further\ninto that mysterious apartment which had witnessed La Valliere's sighs\nand still retained the perfume of her presence. Bragelonne fancied he\nperceived, as he inhaled the atmosphere, that the young girl must have\npassed through. Then succeeded to these emanations of herself, which he\nregarded as invisible though certain proofs, flowers she preferred to\nall others--books of her own selection. If Raoul retained a single doubt\non the subject, it would have vanished at the secret harmony of tastes\nand connection of the mind with the ordinary objects of life. La\nValliere, in Bragelonne's eyes, was present there in each article of\nfurniture, in the color of the hangings, in all that surrounded him.\nDumb, and now completely overwhelmed, there was nothing further for him\nnow to learn, and he followed his pitiless conductress as blindly as\nthe culprit follows the executioner; while Madame, as cruel as women of\noverstrung temperaments generally are, did not spare him the slightest\ndetail. But it must be admitted that, notwithstanding the kind of apathy\ninto which he had fallen, none of these details, even had he been left\nalone, would have escaped him. The happiness of the woman who loves,\nwhen that happiness is derived from a rival, is a living torture for\na jealous man; but for a jealous man such as Raoul was, for one whose\nheart for the first time in its existence was being steeped in gall and\nbitterness, Louise's happiness was in reality an ignominious death, a\ndeath of body and soul. He guessed all; he fancied he could see them,\nwith their hands clasped in each other's, their faces drawn close\ntogether, and reflected, side by side, in loving proximity, and they\ngazed upon the mirrors around them--so sweet an occupation for lovers,\nwho, as they thus see themselves twice over, imprint the picture still\nmore deeply on their memories. He could guess, too, the stolen kiss\nsnatched as they separated from each other's loved society. The luxury,\nthe studied elegance, eloquent of the perfection of indolence, of\nease; the extreme care shown, either to spare the loved object every\nannoyance, or to occasion her a delightful surprise; that might and\nmajesty of love multiplied by the majesty and might of royalty itself,\nseemed like a death-blow to Raoul. If there be anything which can in any\nway assuage or mitigate the tortures of jealousy, it is the inferiority\nof the man who is preferred to yourself; whilst, on the very contrary,\nif there be one anguish more bitter than another, a misery for which\nlanguage lacks a word, it is the superiority of the man preferred to\nyourself, superior, perhaps, in youth, beauty, grace. It is in such\nmoments as these that Heaven almost seems to have taken part against the\ndisdained and rejected lover.\n\nOne final pang was reserved for poor Raoul. Madame Henrietta lifted up a\nsilk curtain, and behind the canvas he perceived La Valliere's portrait.\nNot only the portrait of La Valliere, but of La Valliere radiant with\nyouth, beauty, and happiness, inhaling life and enjoyment at every pore,\nbecause at eighteen years of age love itself is life.\n\n\"Louise!\" murmured Bragelonne,--\"Louise! is it true, then? Oh, you have\nnever loved me, for never have you looked at me in that manner.\" And he\nfelt as if his heart were crushed within his bosom.\n\nMadame Henrietta looked at him, almost envious of his extreme grief,\nalthough she well knew there was nothing to envy in it, and that she\nherself was as passionately loved by De Guiche as Louise by Bragelonne.\nRaoul interpreted Madame Henrietta's look.\n\n\"Oh, forgive me, forgive me, Madame; in your presence I know I ought to\nhave greater self-control. But Heaven grant that you may never be struck\nby similar misery to that which crushes me at this moment, for you are\nbut a woman, and would not be able to endure so terrible an affliction.\nForgive me, I again entreat you, Madame; I am but a man without rank or\nposition, while you belong to a race whose happiness knows no bounds,\nwhose power acknowledges no limit.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" replied Henrietta, \"a mind such as your merits\nall the consideration and respect which a queen's heart even can bestow.\nRegard me as your friend, monsieur; and as such, indeed, I would not\nallow your whole life to be poisoned by perfidy, and covered with\nridicule. It was I, indeed, who, with more courage than any of your\npretended friends,--I except M. de Guiche,--was the cause of your return\nfrom London; it is I, also, who now give you the melancholy proofs,\nnecessary, however, for your cure if you are a lover with courage in his\nheart, and not a weeping Amadis. Do not thank me; pity me, even, and do\nnot serve the king less faithfully than you have done.\"\n\nRaoul smiled bitterly. \"Ah! true, true; I was forgetting that; the king\nis my master.\"\n\n\"Your liberty, nay, your very life, is in danger.\"\n\nA steady, penetrating look informed Madame Henrietta that she was\nmistaken, and that her last argument was not a likely one to affect the\nyoung man. \"Take care, Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" she said, \"for if you do\nnot weigh well all your actions, you might throw into an extravagance\nof wrath a prince whose passions, once aroused, exceed the bounds of\nreason, and you would thereby involve your friends and family in the\ndeepest distress; you must bend, you must submit, and you must cure\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Madame; I appreciate the advice your royal highness is\ngood enough to give me, and I will endeavor to follow it; but one final\nword, I beg.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"Should I be indiscreet in asking you the secret of this staircase, of\nthis trap-door; a secret, which, it seems, you have discovered?\"\n\n\"Nothing more simple. For the purpose of exercising a surveillance over\nthe young girls who are attached to my service, I have duplicate keys of\ntheir doors. It seemed very strange to me that M. de Saint-Aignan should\nchange his apartments. It seemed very strange that the king should\ncome to see M. de Saint-Aignan every day, and, finally, it seemed very\nstrange that so many things should be done during your absence, that the\nvery habits and customs of the court appeared changed. I do not wish\nto be trifled with by the king, nor to serve as a cloak for his love\naffairs; for after La Valliere, who weeps incessantly, he will take a\nfancy to Montalais, who is always laughing; and then to Tonnay-Charente,\nwho does nothing but sing all day; to act such a part as that would be\nunworthy of me. I thrust aside the scruples which my friendship for\nyou suggested. I discovered the secret. I have wounded your feelings, I\nknow, and I again entreat you to pardon me; but I had a duty to fulfil.\nI have discharged it. You are now forewarned; the tempest will soon\nburst; protect yourself accordingly.\"\n\n\"You naturally expect, however, that a result of some kind must follow,\"\nreplied Bragelonne, with firmness; \"for you do not suppose I shall\nsilently accept the shame thus thrust upon me, or the treachery which\nhas been practiced against me?\"\n\n\"You will take whatever steps in the matter you please, Monsieur Raoul,\nonly do not betray the source whence you derived the truth. That is all\nI have to ask,--the only price I require for the service I have rendered\nyou.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing, Madame,\" said Bragelonne, with a bitter smile.\n\n\"I bribed the locksmith, in whom the lovers confided. You can just as\nwell have done so as myself, can you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame. Your royal highness, however, has no other advice or\ncaution to give me, except that of not betraying you?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"I am about, therefore, to beg your royal highness to allow me to remain\nhere for one moment.\"\n\n\"Without me?\"\n\n\"Oh! no, Madame. It matters very little; for what I have to do can be\ndone in your presence. I only ask one moment to write a line to some\none.\"\n\n\"It is dangerous, Monsieur de Bragelonne. Take care.\"\n\n\"No one can possibly know that your royal highness has done me the\nhonor to conduct me here. Besides, I shall sign the letter I am going to\nwrite.\"\n\n\"Do as you please, then.\"\n\nRaoul drew out his tablet, and wrote rapidly on one of the leaves the\nfollowing words:\n\n\"MONSIEUR LE COMTE,--Do not be surprised to find this paper signed by\nme; the friend I shall very shortly send to call on you will have the\nhonor to explain the object of my visit.\n\n\"VICOMTE RAOUL DE BRAGELONNE.\"\n\n\nHe rolled up the paper, slipped it into the lock of the door which\ncommunicated with the room set apart for the two lovers, and satisfied\nhimself that the missive was so apparent that Saint-Aignan could not but\nsee it as he entered; he rejoined the princess, who had already reached\nthe top of the staircase. They then separated, Raoul pretending to thank\nher highness; Henrietta pitying, or seeming to pity, with all her heart,\nthe wretched young man she had just condemned to such fearful torture.\n\"Oh!\" she said, as she saw him disappear, pale as death, and his eyes\nbursting with blood, \"if I had foreseen this, I would have hid the truth\nfrom that poor gentleman.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LIV. Porthos's Plan of Action.\n\nThe great number of individuals we have introduced into this long story\nis the reason why each of them has been forced to appear only in turn,\naccording to the exigencies of the recital. The result is, that our\nreaders have had no opportunity of meeting our friend Porthos since his\nreturn from Fontainebleau. The honors which he had received from\nthe king had not changed the easy, affectionate character of that\nexcellent-hearted man; he may, perhaps, have held up his head a little\nhigher than usual, and a majesty of demeanor, as it were, may have\nbetrayed itself since the honor of dining at the king's table had been\naccorded him. His majesty's banqueting-room had produced a certain\neffect on Porthos. Le Seigneur de Bracieux et de Pierrefonds delighted\nto remember that, during that memorable dinner, the numerous array of\nservants, and the large number of officials in attendance on the guests,\ngave a certain tone and effect to the repast, and seemed, as it were, to\nfurnish the room. Porthos undertook to confer upon Mouston a position of\nsome kind or other, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy among\nhis other domestics, and to create a military household, which was not\nunusual among the great captains of the age, since, in the preceding\ncentury, this luxury had been greatly encouraged by Messieurs de\nTreville, de Schomberg, de la Vieuville, without alluding to M. de\nRichelieu, M. de Conde, and de Bouillon-Turenne. And, therefore, why\nshould not he, Porthos, the friend of the king, and of M. Fouquet, a\nbaron, and engineer, etc., why should not he, indeed, enjoy all\nthe delightful privileges which large possessions and unusual merit\ninvariably confer? Somewhat neglected by Aramis, who, we know, was\ngreatly occupied with M. Fouquet; neglected, also, on account of his\nbeing on duty, by D'Artagnan; tired of Truchen and Planchet, Porthos was\nsurprised to find himself dreaming, without precisely knowing why; but\nif any one had said to him, \"Do you want anything, Porthos?\" he would\nmost certainly have replied, \"Yes.\" After one of those dinners, during\nwhich Porthos attempted to recall to his recollection all the details of\nthe royal banquet, gently joyful, thanks to the excellence of the wines;\ngently melancholy, thanks to his ambitious ideas, Porthos was gradually\nfalling off into a placid doze, when his servant entered to announce\nthat M. de Bragelonne wished to speak to him. Porthos passed into an\nadjoining room, where he found his young friend in the disposition of\nmind we are already aware of. Raoul advanced towards Porthos, and\nshook him by the hand; Porthos, surprised at his seriousness of aspect,\noffered him a seat. \"Dear M. du Vallon,\" said Raoul, \"I have a service\nto ask of you.\"\n\n\"Nothing could happen more fortunately, my young friend,\" replied\nPorthos; \"I have eight thousand livres sent me this morning from\nPierrefonds; and if you want any money--\"\n\n\"No, I thank you; it is not money.\"\n\n\"So much the worse, then. I have always heard it said that that is the\nrarest service, but the easiest to render. The remark struck me; I like\nto cite remarks that strike me.\"\n\n\"Your heart is as good as your mind is sound and true.\"\n\n\"You are much too kind, I declare. You will dine here, of course?\"\n\n\"No; I am not hungry.\"\n\n\"Eh! not dine? What a dreadful country England is!\"\n\n\"Not too much so, indeed--but--\"\n\n\"Well, if such excellent fish and meat were not to be procured there, it\nwould hardly be endurable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I came to--\"\n\n\"I am listening. Only just allow me to take a little sip. One gets\nthirsty in Paris;\" and he ordered a bottle of champagne to be brought;\nand, having first filled Raoul's glass, he filled his own, drank it down\nat a gulp, and then resumed: \"I needed that, in order to listen to you\nwith proper attention. I am now entirely at your service. What do you\nwish to ask me, dear Raoul? What do you want?\"\n\n\"Give me your opinion on quarrels in general, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"My opinion! Well--but--Explain your idea a little more coherently,\"\nreplied Porthos, rubbing his forehead.\n\n\"I mean--you are generally good-humored, good-tempered, whenever any\nmisunderstanding arises between a friend of yours and a stranger, for\ninstance?\"\n\n\"Oh! in the best of tempers.\"\n\n\"Very good; but what do you do, in such a case?\"\n\n\"Whenever any friend of mine gets into a quarrel, I always act on one\nprinciple.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That lost time is irreparable, and one never arranges an affair so well\nas when everything has been done to embroil the disputants as much as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed, is that the principle on which you proceed?\"\n\n\"Precisely; so, as soon as a quarrel takes place, I bring the two\nparties together.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"You understand that by this means it is impossible for an affair not to\nbe arranged.\"\n\n\"I should have thought that, treated in this manner, an affair would, on\nthe contrary--\"\n\n\"Oh! not the least in the world. Just fancy, now, I have had in my life\nsomething like a hundred and eighty to a hundred and ninety regular\nduels, without reckoning hasty encounters, or chance meetings.\"\n\n\"It is a very handsome aggregate,\" said Raoul, unable to resist a smile.\n\n\"A mere nothing; but I am so gentle. D'Artagnan reckons his duels by\nhundreds. It is very true he is a little too hard and sharp--I have\noften told him so.\"\n\n\"And so,\" resumed Raoul, \"you generally arrange the affairs of honor\nyour friends confide to you.\"\n\n\"There is not a single instance in which I have not finished by\narranging every one of them,\" said Porthos, with a gentleness and\nconfidence that surprised Raoul.\n\n\"But the way in which you settle them is at least honorable, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh! rely upon that; and at this stage, I will explain my other\nprinciple to you. As soon as my friend has intrusted his quarrel to\nme, this is what I do; I go to his adversary at once, armed with\na politeness and self-possession absolutely requisite under such\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"That is the way, then,\" said Raoul, bitterly, \"that you arrange affairs\nso safely.\"\n\n\"I believe you. I go to the adversary, then, and say to him: 'It is\nimpossible, monsieur, that you are ignorant of the extent to which you\nhave insulted my friend.'\" Raoul frowned at this remark.\n\n\"It sometimes happens--very often, indeed,\" pursued Porthos--\"that my\nfriend has not been insulted at all; he has even been the first to give\noffense; you can imagine, therefore, whether my language is or is not\nwell chosen.\" And Porthos burst into a peal of laughter.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said Raoul to himself while the merry thunder of Porthos's\nlaughter was resounding in his ears, \"I am very unfortunate. De Guiche\ntreats me with coolness, D'Artagnan with ridicule, Porthos is too tame;\nno one will settle this affair in the only way I wish it to be settled.\nAnd I came to Porthos because I wanted to find a sword instead of cold\nreasoning at my service. My ill-luck dogs me.\"\n\nPorthos, who had recovered himself, continued: \"By one simple\nexpression, I leave my adversary without an excuse.\"\n\n\"That is as it may happen,\" said Raoul, absently.\n\n\"Not at all, it is quite certain. I have not left him an excuse; and\nthen it is that I display all my courtesy, in order to attain the\nhappy issue of my project. I advance, therefore, with an air of great\npoliteness, and taking my adversary by the hand, I say to him: 'Now\nthat you are convinced of having given the offense, we are sure of\nreparation; between my friend and yourself, the future can only offer an\nexchange of mutual courtesies of conduct, and consequently, my mission\nnow is to acquaint you with the length of my friend's sword.'\"\n\n\"What!\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Wait a minute. 'The length of my friend's sword. My horse is waiting\nbelow; my friend is in such and such a spot and is impatiently awaiting\nyour agreeable society; I will take you with me; we can call upon your\nsecond as we go along:' and the affair is arranged.\"\n\n\"And so,\" said Raoul, pale with vexation, \"you reconcile the two\nadversaries on the ground.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interrupted Porthos. \"Reconcile! What for?\"\n\n\"You said that the affair was arranged.\"\n\n\"Of course! since my friend is waiting for him.\"\n\n\"Well! what then? If he is waiting--\"\n\n\"Well! if he is waiting, it is merely to stretch his legs a little. The\nadversary, on the contrary, is stiff from riding; they place themselves\nin proper order, and my friend kills the opponent, and the affair is\nended.\"\n\n\"Ah! he kills him, then?\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"I should think so,\" said Porthos. \"Is it likely I should ever have as a\nfriend a man who allows himself to get killed? I have a hundred and\none friends; at the head of the list stand your father, Aramis, and\nD'Artagnan, all of whom are living and well, I believe?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear baron,\" exclaimed Raoul, as he embraced Porthos.\n\n\"You approve of my method, then?\" said the giant.\n\n\"I approve of it so thoroughly, that I shall have recourse to it this\nvery day, without a moment's delay,--at once, in fact. You are the very\nman I have been looking for.\"\n\n\"Good; here I am, then; you want to fight, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"It is very natural. With whom?\"\n\n\"With M. de Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"I know him--a most agreeable man, who was exceedingly polite to me\nthe day I had the honor of dining with the king. I shall certainly\nacknowledge his politeness in return, even if it had not happened to be\nmy usual custom. So, he has given you an offense?\"\n\n\"A mortal offense.\"\n\n\"The deuce! I can say so, I suppose?\"\n\n\"More than that, even, if you like.\"\n\n\"That is a very great convenience.\"\n\n\"I may look upon it as one of your arranged affairs, may I not?\" said\nRaoul, smiling.\n\n\"As a matter of course. Where will you be waiting for him?\"\n\n\"Ah! I forgot; it is a very delicate matter. M. de Saint-Aignan is a\nvery great friend of the king's.\"\n\n\"So I have heard it said.\"\n\n\"So that if I kill him--\"\n\n\"Oh! you will kill him, certainly; you must take every precaution to do\nso. But there is no difficulty in these matters now; if you had lived in\nour early days,--ah, those were days worth living for!\"\n\n\"My dear friend, you do not quite understand me. I mean, that M.\nde Saint-Aignan being a friend of the king, the affair will be more\ndifficult to manage, since the king might learn beforehand--\"\n\n\"Oh! no; that is not likely. You know my method: 'Monsieur, you have\njust injured my friend, and--'\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it.\"\n\n\"And then: 'Monsieur, I have horses below.' I carry him off before he\ncan have spoken to any one.\"\n\n\"Will he allow himself to be carried off like that?\"\n\n\"I should think so! I should like to see it fail. It would be the first\ntime, if it did. It is true, though, that the young men of the present\nday--Bah! I would carry him off bodily, if that were all,\" and Porthos,\nadding gesture to speech, lifted Raoul and the chair he was sitting on\noff the ground, and carried them round the room.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Raoul, laughing. \"All we have to do is to state the\ngrounds of the quarrel with M. de Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Well, but that is done, it seems.\"\n\n\"No, my dear M. du Vallon, the usage of the present day requires that\nthe cause of the quarrel should be explained.\"\n\n\"Very good. Tell me what it is, then.\"\n\n\"The fact is--\"\n\n\"Deuce take it! how troublesome all this is! In former days we had no\noccasion to say anything about the matter. People fought for the sake of\nfighting; and I, for one, know no better reason than that.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, M. du Vallon.\"\n\n\"However, tell me what the cause is.\"\n\n\"It is too long a story to tell; only, as one must particularize to\na certain extent, and as, on the other hand, the affair is full of\ndifficulties, and requires the most absolute secrecy, you will have the\nkindness merely to tell M. de Saint-Aignan that he has, in the first\nplace, insulted me by changing his lodgings.\"\n\n\"By changing his lodgings? Good,\" said Porthos, who began to count on\nhis fingers; \"next?\"\n\n\"Then in getting a trap-door made in his new apartments.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Porthos; \"a trap-door: upon my word, that is very\nserious; you ought to be furious at that. What the deuce does the\nfellow mean by getting trap-doors made without first consulting you?\nTrap-doors! _mordioux!_ I haven't got any, except in my dungeons at\nBracieux.\"\n\n\"And you will please add,\" said Raoul, \"that my last motive for\nconsidering myself insulted is, the existence of the portrait that M. de\nSaint-Aignan well knows.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? A portrait, too! A change of residence, a trap-door,\nand a portrait! Why, my dear friend, with but one of these causes of\ncomplaint there is enough, and more than enough, for all the gentlemen\nin France and Spain to cut each other's throats, and that is saying but\nvery little.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear friend, you are furnished with all you need, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I shall take a second horse with me. Select your own rendezvous, and\nwhile you are waiting there, you can practice some of the best passes,\nso as to get your limbs as elastic as possible.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I shall be waiting for you in the wood of Vincennes, close\nto Minimes.\"\n\n\"All goes well, then. Where am I to find this M. de Saint-Aignan?\"\n\n\"At the Palais Royal.\"\n\nPorthos ran a huge hand-bell. \"My court suit,\" he said to the servant\nwho answered the summons, \"my horse, and a led horse to accompany me.\"\nThen turning to Raoul, as soon as the servant had quitted the room, he\nsaid: \"Does your father know anything about this?\"\n\n\"No; I am going to write to him.\"\n\n\"And D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"No, nor D'Artagnan either. He is very cautious, you know, and might\nhave diverted me from my purpose.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan is a sound adviser, though,\" said Porthos, astonished that,\nin his own loyal faith in D'Artagnan, any one could have thought of\nhimself, so long as there was a D'Artagnan in the world.\n\n\"Dear M. du Vallon,\" said Raoul, \"do not question me any more, I implore\nyou. I have told you all that I had to say; it is prompt action I now\nexpect, sharp and decided as you know how to arrange it. That, indeed,\nis my reason for having chosen you.\"\n\n\"You will be satisfied with me,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Do not forget, either, that, except ourselves, no one must know\nanything of this meeting.\"\n\n\"People generally find these things out,\" said Porthos, dryly, \"when\na dead body is discovered in a wood. But I promise everything, my dear\nfriend, except the concealment of the dead body. There it is, and it\nmust be seen, as a matter of course. It is a principle of mine, not to\nbury bodies. That has a smack of the assassin about it. Every risk has\nits peculiarities.\"\n\n\"To work, then, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"Rely upon me,\" said the giant, finishing the bottle, while a servant\nspread out upon a sofa the gorgeously decorated dress trimmed with lace.\n\nRaoul left the room, saying to himself, with a secret delight,\n\"Perfidious king! traitorous monarch! I cannot reach thee. I do not wish\nit; for kings are sacred objects. But your friend, your accomplice, your\npanderer--the coward who represents you--shall pay for your crime. I\nwill kill him in thy name, and, afterwards, we will bethink ourselves\nof--_Louise_.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LV. The Change of Residence, the Trap-Door, and the Portrait.\n\nPorthos, intrusted, to his great delight, with this mission, which made\nhim feel young again, took half an hour less than his usual time to put\non his court suit. To show that he was a man acquainted with the usages\nof high society, he had begun by sending his lackey to inquire if\nMonsieur de Saint-Aignan were at home, and heard, in answer, that M.\nle Comte de Saint-Aignan had had the honor of accompanying the king to\nSaint-Germain, as well as the whole court; but that monsieur le comte\nhad just that moment returned. Immediately upon this reply, Porthos made\nas much haste as possible, and reached Saint-Aignan's apartments just\nas the latter was having his boots taken off. The promenade had been\ndelightful. The king, who was in love more than ever, and of course\nhappier than ever, behaved in the most charming manner to every one.\nNothing could possibly equal his kindness. M. de Saint-Aignan, it may\nbe remembered, was a poet, and fancied that he had proved that he was\nso under too many a memorable circumstance to allow the title to be\ndisputed by any one. An indefatigable rhymester, he had, during\nthe whole of the journey, overwhelmed with quatrains, sextains, and\nmadrigals, first the king, and then La Valliere. The king, on his side,\nwas in a similarly poetical mood, and had made a distich; while La\nValliere, delighting in poetry, as most women do who are in love, had\ncomposed two sonnets. The day, then, had not been a bad one for Apollo;\nand so, as soon as he had returned to Paris, Saint-Aignan, who knew\nbeforehand that his verse would be sure to be extensively circulated in\ncourt circles, occupied himself, with a little more attention than he\nhad been able to bestow during the promenade, with the composition, as\nwell as with the idea itself. Consequently, with all the tenderness of\na father about to start his children in life, he candidly interrogated\nhimself whether the public would find these offsprings of his\nimagination sufficiently elegant and graceful; and in order to make\nhis mind easy on the subject, M. de Saint-Aignan recited to himself the\nmadrigal he had composed, and which he had repeated from memory to the\nking, and had promised to write out for him on his return. All the\ntime he was committing these words to memory, the comte was engaged in\nundressing himself more completely. He had just taken off his coat, and\nwas putting on his dressing-gown, when he was informed that Monsieur le\nBaron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds was waiting to be received.\n\n\"Eh!\" he said, \"what does that bunch of names mean? I don't know\nanything about him.\"\n\n\"It is the same gentleman,\" replied the lackey, \"who had the honor of\ndining with you, monseigneur, at the king's table, when his majesty was\nstaying at Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Introduce him, then, at once,\" cried Saint-Aignan.\n\nPorthos, in a few minutes, entered the room. M. de Saint-Aignan had\nan excellent recollection of persons, and, at the first glance, he\nrecognized the gentleman from the country, who enjoyed so singular\na reputation, and whom the king had received so favorably at\nFontainebleau, in spite of the smiles of some of those who were present.\nHe therefore advanced towards Porthos with all the outward signs of\nconsideration of manner which Porthos thought but natural, considering\nthat he himself, whenever he called upon an adversary, hoisted a\nstandard of the most refined politeness. Saint-Aignan desired the\nservant to give Porthos a chair; and the latter, who saw nothing unusual\nin this act of politeness, sat down gravely and coughed. The ordinary\ncourtesies having been exchanged between the two gentlemen, the comte,\nto whom the visit was paid, said, \"May I ask, monsieur le baron, to what\nhappy circumstance I am indebted for the favor of a visit from you?\"\n\n\"The very thing I am about to have the honor of explaining to you,\nmonsieur le comte; but, I beg your pardon--\"\n\n\"What is the matter, monsieur?\" inquired Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"I regret to say that I have broken your chair.\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur,\" said Saint-Aignan; \"not at all.\"\n\n\"It is the fact, though, monsieur le comte; I have broken it--so much\nso, indeed, that if I do not move, I shall fall down, which would be an\nexceedingly disagreeable position for me in the discharge of the very\nserious mission which has been intrusted to me with regard to yourself.\"\n\nPorthos rose; and but just in time, for the chair had given way several\ninches. Saint-Aignan looked about him for something more solid for his\nguest to sit upon.\n\n\"Modern articles of furniture,\" said Porthos, while the comte was\nlooking about, \"are constructed in a ridiculously flimsy manner. In my\nearly days, when I used to sit down with far more energy than is now the\ncase, I do not remember ever to have broken a chair, except in taverns,\nwith my arms.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan smiled at this remark. \"But,\" said Porthos, as he settled\nhimself down on a couch, which creaked, but did not give way beneath his\nweight, \"that unfortunately has nothing whatever to do with my present\nvisit.\"\n\n\"Why unfortunately? Are you the bearer of a message of ill-omen,\nmonsieur le baron?\"\n\n\"Of ill-omen--for a gentleman? Certainly not, monsieur le comte,\"\nreplied Porthos, nobly. \"I have simply come to say that you have\nseriously insulted a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"I, monsieur?\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan--\"I have insulted a friend of\nyours, do you say? May I ask his name?\"\n\n\"M. Raoul de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"I have insulted M. Raoul de Bragelonne!\" cried Saint-Aignan. \"I really\nassure you, monsieur, that it is quite impossible; for M. de Bragelonne,\nwhom I know but very slightly,--nay, whom I know hardly at all--is in\nEngland, and, as I have not seen him for a long time past, I cannot\npossibly have insulted him.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne is in Paris, monsieur le comte,\" said Porthos,\nperfectly unmoved; \"and I repeat, it is quite certain you have insulted\nhim, since he himself told me you had. Yes, monsieur, you have seriously\ninsulted him, mortally insulted him, I repeat.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, monsieur le baron, I swear, quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Porthos, \"you cannot be ignorant of the circumstance,\nsince M. de Bragelonne informed me that he had already apprised you of\nit by a note.\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honor, monsieur, that I have received no note\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"This is most extraordinary,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"I will convince you,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"that have received nothing\nin any way from him.\" And he rang the bell. \"Basque,\" he said to the\nservant who entered, \"how many letters or notes were sent here\nduring my absence?\"\n\n\"Three, monsieur le comte--a note from M. de Fiesque, one from Madame de\nLaferte, and a letter from M. de las Fuentes.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"Speak the truth before this gentleman--the truth, you understand. I\nwill take care you are not blamed.\"\n\n\"There was a note, also, from--from--\"\n\n\"Well, from whom?\"\n\n\"From Mademoiselle--de--\"\n\n\"Out with it!\"\n\n\"De Laval.\"\n\n\"That is quite sufficient,\" interrupted Porthos. \"I believe you,\nmonsieur le comte.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan dismissed the valet, and followed him to the door, in order\nto close it after him; and when he had done so, looking straight before\nhim, he happened to see in the keyhole of the adjoining apartment the\npaper which Bragelonne had slipped in there as he left. \"What is this?\"\nhe said.\n\nPorthos, who was sitting with his back to the room, turned round. \"Aha!\"\nhe said.\n\n\"A note in the keyhole!\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"That is not unlikely to be the missing letter, monsieur le comte,\" said\nPorthos.\n\nSaint-Aignan took out the paper. \"A note from M. de Bragelonne!\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"You see, monsieur, I was right. Oh, when I say a thing--\"\n\n\"Brought here by M. de Bragelonne himself,\" the comte murmured, turning\npale. \"This is infamous! How could he possibly have come here?\" And the\ncomte rang again.\n\n\"Who has been here during my absence with the king?\"\n\n\"No one, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That is impossible! Some one must have been here.\"\n\n\"No one could possibly have entered, monsieur, since the keys have never\nleft my pocket.\"\n\n\"And yet I find the letter in yonder lock; some one must have put it\nthere; it could not have come here of its own accord.\"\n\nBasque opened his arms as if signifying the most absolute ignorance on\nthe subject.\n\n\"Probably it was M. de Bragelonne himself who placed it there,\" said\nPorthos.\n\n\"In that case he must have entered here.\"\n\n\"How could that have been, since I have the key in my own pocket?\"\nreturned Basque, perseveringly.\n\nSaint-Aignan crumpled the letter in his palm, after having read it.\n\"There is something mysterious about this,\" he murmured, absorbed in\nthought. Porthos left him to his reflections; but after a while returned\nto the mission he had undertaken.\n\n\"Shall we return to our little affair?\" Porthos resumed, addressing\nSaint-Aignan after a brief pause.\n\n\"I think I can now understand it, from this note, which has arrived here\nin so singular a manner. Monsieur de Bragelonne says that a friend will\ncall.\"\n\n\"I am his friend. I am the person he alludes to.\"\n\n\"For the purpose of giving me a challenge?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And he complains that I have insulted him?\"\n\n\"Mortally.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask; for his conduct is so mysterious, that, at\nleast, it needs some explanation?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Porthos, \"my friend cannot but be right; and, as far\nas his conduct is concerned, if it be mysterious, as you say, you have\nonly yourself to blame for it.\" Porthos pronounced these words with an\namount of confidence which, for a man who was unaccustomed to his ways,\nmust have revealed an infinity of sense.\n\n\"Mystery, so be it; but what is all the mystery about?\" said\nSaint-Aignan.\n\n\"You will think it the best, perhaps,\" Porthos replied, with a low bow,\n\"if I do not enter in to particulars.\"\n\n\"Oh, I perfectly understand. We will touch very lightly upon it, then,\nso speak, monsieur, I am listening.\"\n\n\"In the first place, monsieur,\" said Porthos, \"you have changed your\napartments.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is quite true,\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"You admit it,\" said Porthos, with an air of satisfaction.\n\n\"Admit it! of course I admit it. Why should I not admit it, do you\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"You have admitted it. Very good,\" said Porthos, lifting up one finger.\n\n\"But how can my having moved my lodgings have done M. de Bragelonne\nany harm? Have the goodness to tell me that, for I positively do not\ncomprehend a word of what you are saying.\"\n\nPorthos stopped him, and then said, with great gravity, \"Monsieur, this\nis the first of M. de Bragelonne's complaints against you. If he makes a\ncomplaint, it is because he feels himself insulted.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan began to beat his foot impatiently on the ground. \"This\nlooks like a spurious quarrel,\" he said.\n\n\"No one can possibly have a spurious quarrel with the Vicomte de\nBragelonne,\" returned Porthos; \"but, at all events, you have nothing to\nadd on the subject of your changing your apartments, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Nothing. And what is the next point?\"\n\n\"Ah, the next! You will observe, monsieur, that the one I have already\nmentioned is a most serious injury, to which you have given no answer,\nor rather, have answered very indifferently. Is it possible, monsieur,\nthat you have changed your lodgings? M. de Bragelonne feels insulted at\nyour having done so, and you do not attempt to excuse yourself.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Saint-Aignan, who was getting annoyed at the perfect\ncoolness of his visitor--\"what! am I to consult M. de Bragelonne whether\nI am to move or not? You can hardly be serious, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I am. And it is absolutely necessary, monsieur; but under any\ncircumstances, you will admit that it is nothing in comparison with the\nsecond ground of complaint.\"\n\n\"Well, what is that?\"\n\nPorthos assumed a very solemn expression as he said: \"How about the\ntrap-door, monsieur?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan turned exceedingly pale. He pushed back his chair so\nabruptly, that Porthos, simple as he was, perceived that the blow had\ntold. \"The trap-door,\" murmured Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, explain that if you can,\" said Porthos, shaking his\nhead.\n\nSaint-Aignan held down his head, as he murmured: \"I have been betrayed,\neverything is known!\"\n\n\"Everything,\" replied Porthos, who knew nothing.\n\n\"You see me perfectly overwhelmed,\" pursued Saint-Aignan, \"overwhelmed\nto a degree that I hardly know what I am about.\"\n\n\"A guilty conscience, monsieur. Your affair is a bad one, and when the\npublic learns all about it, it will judge--\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" exclaimed the count, hurriedly, \"such a secret ought not\nto be known even by one's confessor.\"\n\n\"That we will think about,\" said Porthos; \"the secret will not go far,\nin fact.\"\n\n\"Surely, monsieur,\" returned Saint-Aignan, \"since M. de Bragelonne has\npenetrated the secret, he must be aware of the danger he as well as\nothers run the risk of incurring.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne runs no danger, monsieur, nor does he fear any either,\nas you, if it please Heaven, will find out very soon.\"\n\n\"This fellow is a perfect madman,\" thought Saint-Aignan. \"What, in\nHeaven's name, does he want?\" He then said aloud: \"Come, monsieur, let\nus hush up this affair.\"\n\n\"You forget the portrait,\" said Porthos, in a voice of thunder, which\nmade the comte's blood freeze in his veins.\n\nAs the portrait in question was La Valliere's portrait, and no mistake\ncould any longer exist on the subject, Saint-Aignan's eyes were\ncompletely opened. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed--\"ah! monsieur, I remember now\nthat M. de Bragelonne was engaged to be married to her.\"\n\nPorthos assumed an imposing air, all the majesty of ignorance, in fact,\nas he said: \"It matters nothing whatever to me, nor to yourself, indeed,\nwhether or not my friend was, as you say, engaged to be married. I am\neven astonished that you should have made use of so indiscreet a remark.\nIt may possibly do your cause harm, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"you are the incarnation of\nintelligence, delicacy, and loyalty of feeling united. I see the whole\nmatter now clearly enough.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And,\" pursued Saint-Aignan, \"you have made me comprehend it in the most\ningenious and the most delicate manner possible. I beg you to accept my\nbest thanks.\" Porthos drew himself up, unable to resist the flattery of\nthe remark. \"Only, now that I know everything, permit me to explain--\"\n\nPorthos shook his head, as a man who does not wish to hear, but\nSaint-Aignan continued: \"I am in despair, I assure you, at all that\nhas happened; but how would you have acted in my place? Come, between\nourselves, tell me what you would have done?\"\n\nPorthos drew himself up as he answered: \"There is now no question at\nall of what I should have done, young man; you have been made acquainted\nwith the three causes of complaint against you, I believe?\"\n\n\"As for the first, my change of rooms, and I now address myself to you\nas a man of honor and of great intelligence, could I, when the desire\nof so august a personage was so urgently expressed that I should move,\nought I to have disobeyed?\"\n\nPorthos was about to speak, but Saint-Aignan did not give him time to\nanswer. \"Ah! my frankness, I see, convinces you,\" he said, interpreting\nthe movement according to his own fancy. \"You feel that I am right.\"\n\nPorthos did not reply, and so Saint-Aignan continued: \"I pass by that\nunfortunate trap-door,\" he said, placing his hand on Porthos's arm,\n\"that trap-door, the occasion and means of so much unhappiness, and\nwhich was constructed for--you know what. Well, then, in plain truth, do\nyou suppose that it was I who, of my own accord, in such a place, too,\nhad that trap-door made?--Oh, no!--you do not believe it; and here,\nagain, you feel, you guess, you understand the influence of a will\nsuperior to my own. You can conceive the infatuation, the blind,\nirresistible passion which has been at work. But, thank Heaven! I am\nfortunate in speaking to a man who has so much sensitiveness of feeling;\nand if it were not so, indeed, what an amount of misery and scandal\nwould fall upon her, poor girl! and upon him--whom I will not name.\"\n\nPorthos, confused and bewildered by the eloquence and gestures of\nSaint-Aignan, made a thousand efforts to stem this torrent of words,\nof which, by the by, he did not understand a single one; he remained\nupright and motionless on his seat, and that was all he could do.\nSaint-Aignan continued, and gave a new inflection to his voice, and an\nincreasing vehemence to his gesture: \"As for the portrait, for I readily\nbelieve the portrait is the principal cause of complaint, tell me\ncandidly if you think me to blame?--Who was it who wished to have her\nportrait? Was it I?--Who is in love with her? Is it I?--Who wishes to\ngain her affection? Again, is it I?--Who took her likeness? I, do you\nthink? No! a thousand times no! I know M. de Bragelonne must be in a\nstate of despair; I know these misfortunes are most cruel. But I, too,\nam suffering as well; and yet there is no possibility of offering any\nresistance. Suppose we were to fight? we would be laughed at. If he\nobstinately persist in his course, he is lost. You will tell me, I know,\nthat despair is ridiculous, but then you are a sensible man. You have\nunderstood me. I perceived by your serious, thoughtful, embarrassed\nair, even, that the importance of the situation we are placed in has\nnot escaped you. Return, therefore, to M. de Bragelonne; thank him--as I\nhave indeed reason to thank him--for having chosen as an intermediary a\nman of your high merit. Believe me that I shall, on my side, preserve\nan eternal gratitude for the man who has so ingeniously, so cleverly\narranged the misunderstanding between us. And since ill luck would have\nit that the secret should be known to four instead of three, why,\nthis secret, which might make the most ambitious man's fortune, I am\ndelighted to share with you, monsieur, from the bottom of my heart I\nam delighted at it. From this very moment you can make use of me as you\nplease, I place myself entirely at your mercy. What can I possibly do\nfor you? What can I solicit, nay, require even? You have only to speak,\nmonsieur, only to speak.\"\n\nAnd, according to the familiarly friendly fashion of that period,\nSaint-Aignan threw his arms round Porthos, and clasped him tenderly\nin his embrace. Porthos allowed him to do this with the most perfect\nindifference. \"Speak,\" resumed Saint-Aignan, \"what do you require?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Porthos, \"I have a horse below: be good enough to mount\nhim; he is a very good one and will play you no tricks.\"\n\n\"Mount on horseback! what for?\" inquired Saint-Aignan, with no little\ncuriosity.\n\n\"To accompany me to where M. de Bragelonne is waiting us.\"\n\n\"Ah! he wishes to speak to me, I suppose? I can well believe that; he\nwishes to have the details, very likely; alas! it is a very delicate\nmatter; but at the present moment I cannot, for the king is waiting for\nme.\"\n\n\"The king must wait, then,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"What do you say? the king must wait!\" interrupted the finished\ncourtier, with a smile of utter amazement, for he could not understand\nthat the king could under any circumstances be supposed to have to wait.\n\n\"It is merely the affair of a very short hour,\" returned Porthos.\n\n\"But where is M. de Bragelonne waiting for me?\"\n\n\"At the Minimes, at Vincennes.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! but are we going to laugh over the affair when we get\nthere?\"\n\n\"I don't think it likely,\" said Porthos, as his face assumed a look of\nutter hardness.\n\n\"But the Minimes is a rendezvous where duels take place, and what can I\nhave to do at the Minimes?\"\n\nPorthos slowly drew his sword, and said: \"That is the length of my\nfriend's sword.\"\n\n\"Why, the man is mad!\" cried Saint-Aignan.\n\nThe color mounted to Porthos's face, as he replied: \"If I had not the\nhonor of being in your own apartment, monsieur, and of representing M.\nde Bragelonne's interests, I would throw you out of the window. It will\nbe merely a pleasure postponed, and you will lose nothing by waiting.\nWill you come with me to the Minimes, monsieur, of your own free will?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Take care, I will carry you if you do not come quickly.\"\n\n\"Basque!\" cried Saint-Aignan. As soon as Basque appeared, he said, \"The\nking wishes to see monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"That is very different,\" said Porthos; \"the king's service before\nanything else. We will wait until this evening, monsieur.\"\n\nAnd saluting Saint-Aignan with his usual courtesy, Porthos left the\nroom, delighted at having arranged another affair. Saint-Aignan looked\nafter him as he left; and then hastily putting on his court dress\nagain, he ran off, arranging his costume as he went along, muttering to\nhimself, \"The Minimes! the Minimes! We shall see how the king will fancy\nthis challenge; for it is for him after all, that is certain.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LVI. Rivals in Politics.\n\nOn his return from the promenade, which had been so prolific in poetical\neffusions, and in which every one had paid his or her tribute to the\nMuses, as the poets of the period used to say, the king found M. Fouquet\nwaiting for an audience. M. Colbert had lain in wait for his majesty in\nthe corridor, and followed him like a jealous and watchful shadow;\nM. Colbert, with his square head, his vulgar and untidy, though rich\ncostume, somewhat resembled a Flemish gentleman after he had been\nover-indulging in his national drink--beer. Fouquet, at sight of his\nenemy, remained perfectly unmoved, and during the whole of the scene\nwhich followed scrupulously resolved to observe a line of conduct\nparticularly difficult to the man of superior mind, who does not even\nwish to show his contempt, for fear of doing his adversary too much\nhonor. Colbert made no attempt to conceal his insolent expression of the\nvulgar joy he felt. In his opinion, M. Fouquet's was a game very badly\nplayed and hopelessly lost, although not yet finished. Colbert belonged\nto that school of politicians who think cleverness alone worthy of\ntheir admiration, and success the only thing worth caring for. Colbert,\nmoreover, who was not simply an envious and jealous man, but who had the\nking's interest really at heart, because he was thoroughly imbued with\nthe highest sense of probity in all matters of figures and accounts,\ncould well afford to assign as a pretext for his conduct, that in hating\nand doing his utmost to ruin M. Fouquet, he had nothing in view but the\nwelfare of the state and the dignity of the crown. None of these details\nescaped Fouquet's observation; through his enemy's thick, bushy brows,\nand despite the restless movement of his eyelids, he could, by merely\nlooking at his eyes, penetrate to the very bottom of Colbert's heart,\nand he read to what an unbounded extent hate towards himself and triumph\nat his approaching fall existed there. But as, in observing everything,\nhe wished to remain himself impenetrable, he composed his features,\nsmiled with the charmingly sympathetic smile that was peculiarly his\nown, and saluted the king with the most dignified and graceful ease and\nelasticity of manner. \"Sire,\" he said, \"I perceive by your majesty's\njoyous air that you have been gratified with the promenade.\"\n\n\"Most gratified, indeed, monsieur le surintendant, most gratified. You\nwere very wrong not to come with us, as I invited you to do.\"\n\n\"I was working, sire,\" replied the superintendent, who did not even\nseem to take the trouble to turn aside his head in merest respect of\nColbert's presence.\n\n\"Ah! M. Fouquet,\" cried the king, \"there is nothing like the country. I\nshould be delighted to live in the country always, in the open air and\nunder the trees.\"\n\n\"I should hope that your majesty is not yet weary of the throne,\" said\nFouquet.\n\n\"No; but thrones of soft turf are very pleasant.\"\n\n\"Your majesty gratifies my utmost wishes in speaking in that manner, for\nI have a request to submit to you.\"\n\n\"On whose behalf, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Oh behalf of the nymphs of Vaux, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Louis XIV.\n\n\"Your majesty, too, once deigned to make me a promise,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"Yes, I remember it.\"\n\n\"The _fete_ at Vaux, the celebrated _fete_, I think, it was, sire,\"\nsaid Colbert, endeavoring to show his importance by taking part in the\nconversation.\n\nFouquet, with the profoundest contempt, did not take the slightest\nnotice of the remark, as if, as far as he was concerned, Colbert had not\neven thought or said a word.\n\n\"Your majesty is aware,\" he said, \"that I destine my estate at Vaux to\nreceive the most amiable of princes, the most powerful of monarchs.\"\n\n\"I have given you my promise, monsieur,\" said Louis XIV., smiling; \"and\na king never departs from his word.\"\n\n\"And I have come now, sire, to inform your majesty that I am ready to\nobey your orders in every respect.\"\n\n\"Do you promise me many wonders, monsieur le surintendant?\" said Louis,\nlooking at Colbert.\n\n\"Wonders? Oh! no, sire. I do not undertake that. I hope to be able\nto procure your majesty a little pleasure, perhaps even a little\nforgetfulness of the cares of state.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, M. Fouquet,\" returned the king; \"I insist upon the word\n'wonders.' You are a magician, I believe; we all know the power you\nwield; we also know that you can find gold even when there is none to be\nfound elsewhere; so much so, indeed, that people say you coin it.\"\n\nFouquet felt that the shot was discharged from a double quiver, and\nthat the king had launched an arrow from his own bow as well as one from\nColbert's. \"Oh!\" said he, laughingly, \"the people know perfectly well\nout of what mine I procure the gold; and they know it only too well,\nperhaps; besides,\" he added, \"I can assure your majesty that the gold\ndestined to pay the expenses of the _fete_ at Vaux will cost neither\nblood nor tears; hard labor it may, perhaps, but that can be paid for.\"\n\nLouis paused quite confused. He wished to look at Colbert; Colbert, too,\nwished to reply to him; a glance as swift as an eagle's, a king-like\nglance, indeed, which Fouquet darted at the latter, arrested the\nwords upon his lips. The king, who had by this time recovered his\nself-possession, turned towards Fouquet, saying, \"I presume, therefore,\nI am now to consider myself formally invited?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, if your majesty will condescend so far as to accept my\ninvitation.\"\n\n\"What day have you fixed?\"\n\n\"Any day your majesty may find most convenient.\"\n\n\"You speak like an enchanter who has but to conjure up in actuality\nthe wildest fancies, Monsieur Fouquet. I could not say so much, indeed,\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Your majesty will do, whenever you please, everything that a monarch\ncan and ought to do. The king of France has servants at his bidding\nwho are able to do anything on his behalf, to accomplish everything to\ngratify his pleasures.\"\n\nColbert tried to look at the superintendent, in order to see whether\nthis remark was an approach to less hostile sentiments on his part; but\nFouquet had not even looked at his enemy, and Colbert hardly seemed\nto exist as far as he was concerned. \"Very good, then,\" said the king.\n\"Will a week hence suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well, sire.\"\n\n\"This is Tuesday; if I give you until next Sunday week, will that be\nsufficient?\"\n\n\"The delay which your majesty deigns to accord me will greatly aid the\nvarious works which my architects have in hand for the purpose of adding\nto the amusement of your majesty and your friends.\"\n\n\"By the by, speaking of my friends,\" resumed the king; \"how do you\nintend to treat them?\"\n\n\"The king is master everywhere, sire; your majesty will draw up your own\nlist and give your own orders. All those you may deign to invite will be\nmy guests, my honored guests, indeed.\"\n\n\"I thank you!\" returned the king, touched by the noble thought expressed\nin so noble a tone.\n\nFouquet, therefore, took leave of Louis XIV., after a few words had been\nadded with regard to the details of certain matters of business. He felt\nthat Colbert would remain behind with the king, that they would both\nconverse about him, and that neither of them would spare him in the\nleast degree. The satisfaction of being able to give a last and\nterrible blow to his enemy seemed to him almost like a compensation\nfor everything they were about to subject him to. He turned back again\nimmediately, as soon, indeed, as he had reached the door, and addressing\nthe king, said, \"I was forgetting that I had to crave your majesty's\nforgiveness.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\" said the king, graciously.\n\n\"For having committed a serious fault without perceiving it.\"\n\n\"A fault! You! Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, I shall be unable to do otherwise\nthan forgive you. In what way or against whom have you been found\nwanting?\"\n\n\"Against every sense of propriety, sire. I forgot to inform your majesty\nof a circumstance that has lately occurred of some little importance.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nColbert trembled; he fancied that he was about to frame a denunciation\nagainst him. His conduct had been unmasked. A single syllable from\nFouquet, a single proof formally advanced, and before the youthful\nloyalty of feeling which guided Louis XIV., Colbert's favor would\ndisappear at once; the latter trembled, therefore, lest so daring a blow\nmight overthrow his whole scaffold; in point of fact, the opportunity\nwas so admirably suited to be taken advantage of, that a skillful,\npracticed player like Aramis would not have let it slip. \"Sire,\" said\nFouquet, with an easy, unconcerned air, \"since you have had the kindness\nto forgive me, I am perfectly indifferent about my confession; this\nmorning I sold one of the official appointments I hold.\"\n\n\"One of your appointments,\" said the king, \"which?\"\n\nColbert turned perfectly livid. \"That which conferred upon me, sire,\na grand gown, and a stern air of gravity; the appointment of\nprocureur-general.\"\n\nThe king involuntarily uttered a loud exclamation and looked at Colbert,\nwho, with his face bedewed with perspiration, felt almost on the point\nof fainting. \"To whom have you sold this department, Monsieur Fouquet?\"\ninquired the king.\n\nColbert was obliged to lean against a column of the fireplace. \"To a\ncouncilor belonging to the parliament, sire, whose name is Vanel.\"\n\n\"Vanel?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, a particular friend of the intendant Colbert,\" added\nFouquet; letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable\nnonchalance, and with an admirably assumed expression of forgetfulness\nand ignorance. And having finished, and having overwhelmed Colbert\nbeneath the weight of this superiority, the superintendent again saluted\nthe king and quitted the room, partially revenged by the stupefaction of\nthe king and the humiliation of the favorite.\n\n\"Is it really possible,\" said the king, as soon as Fouquet had\ndisappeared, \"that he has sold that office?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" said Colbert, meaningly.\n\n\"He must be mad,\" the king added.\n\nColbert this time did not reply; he had penetrated the king's thought,\na thought which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been\nmade to suffer; his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter jealousy\nof Fouquet; and a threat of disgrace was now added to the plan he had\narranged for his ruin. Colbert felt perfectly assured that for the\nfuture, between Louis XIV. and himself, their hostile feelings and ideas\nwould meet with no obstacles, and that at the first fault committed by\nFouquet, which could be laid hold of as a pretext, the chastisement\nso long impending would be precipitated. Fouquet had thrown aside his\nweapons of defense, and hate and jealousy had picked them up. Colbert\nwas invited by the king to the _fete_ at Vaux; he bowed like a man\nconfident in himself, and accepted the invitation with the air of\none who almost confers a favor. The king was about writing down\nSaint-Aignan's name on his list of royal commands, when the usher\nannounced the Comte de Saint-Aignan. As soon as the royal \"Mercury\"\nentered, Colbert discreetly withdrew.\n\n\n\nChapter LVII. Rivals in Love.\n\nSaint-Aignan had quitted Louis XIV. hardly a couple of hours before; but\nin the first effervescence of his affection, whenever Louis XIV. was out\nof sight of La Valliere, he was obliged to talk about her. Besides,\nthe only person with whom he could speak about her at his ease was\nSaint-Aignan, and thus Saint-Aignan had become an indispensable.\n\n\"Ah, is that you, comte?\" he exclaimed, as soon as he perceived him,\ndoubly delighted, not only to see him again, but also to get rid of\nColbert, whose scowling face always put him out of humor. \"So much\nthe better, I am very glad to see you. You will make one of the best\ntraveling party, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Of what traveling part are you speaking, sire?\" inquired Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"The one we are making up to go to the _fete_ the superintendent is\nabout to give at Vaux. Ah! Saint-Aignan, you will, at last, see a\n_fete_, a royal _fete_, by the side of which all our amusements at\nFontainebleau are petty, contemptible affairs.\"\n\n\"At Vaux! the superintendent going to give a _fete_ in your majesty's\nhonor? Nothing more than that!\"\n\n\"'Nothing more than that,' do you say? It is very diverting to find\nyou treating it with so much disdain. Are you who express such an\nindifference on the subject, aware, that as soon as it is known that M.\nFouquet is going to receive me at Vaux next Sunday week, people will\nbe striving their very utmost to get invited to the _fete?_ I repeat,\nSaint-Aignan, you shall be one of the invited guests.\"\n\n\"Very well, sire; unless I shall, in the meantime, have undertaken a\nlonger and a less agreeable journey.\"\n\n\"What journey do you allude to?\"\n\n\"The one across the Styx, sire.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Louis XIV., laughing.\n\n\"No, seriously, sire,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"I am invited; and in such\na way, in truth, that I hardly know what to say, or how to act, in order\nto refuse the invitation.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you. I know that you are in a poetical vein; but\ntry not to sink from Apollo to Phoebus.\"\n\n\"Very well; if your majesty will deign to listen to me, I will not keep\nyour mind on the rack a moment longer.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Your majesty knows the Baron du Vallon?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; a good servant to my father, the late king, and an\nadmirable companion at table; for, I think, you are referring to the\ngentleman who dined with us at Fontainebleau?\"\n\n\"Precisely so; but you have omitted to add to his other qualifications,\nsire, that he is a most charming polisher-off of other people.\"\n\n\"What! Does M. du Vallon wish to polish you off?\"\n\n\"Or to get me killed, which is much the same thing.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"Do not laugh, sire, for I am not saying one word beyond the exact\ntruth.\"\n\n\"And you say he wishes to get you killed.\"\n\n\"Such is that excellent person's present idea.\"\n\n\"Be easy; I will defend you, if he be in the wrong.\"\n\n\"Ah! There is an 'if'!\"\n\n\"Of course; answer me as candidly as if it were some one else's affair\ninstead of your own, my poor Saint-Aignan; is he right or wrong?\"\n\n\"Your majesty shall be the judge.\"\n\n\"What have you done to him?\"\n\n\"To him, personally, nothing at all; but, it seems, to one of his\nfriends, I have.\"\n\n\"It is all the same. Is his friend one of the celebrated 'four'?\"\n\n\"No. It is the son of one of the celebrated 'four,' though.\"\n\n\"What have you done to the son? Come, tell me.\"\n\n\"Why, it seems that I have helped some one to take his mistress from\nhim.\"\n\n\"You confess it, then?\"\n\n\"I cannot help confessing it, for it is true.\"\n\n\"In that case, you are wrong; and if he were to kill you, he would be\ndoing perfectly right.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is your majesty's way of reasoning, then!\"\n\n\"Do you think it a bad way?\"\n\n\"It is a very expeditious way, at all events.\"\n\n\"'Good justice is prompt;' so my grandfather Henry IV. used to say.\"\n\n\"In that case, your majesty will, perhaps, be good enough to sign my\nadversary's pardon, for he is now waiting for me at the Minimes, for the\npurpose of putting me out of my misery.\"\n\n\"His name, and a parchment!\"\n\n\"There is a parchment upon your majesty's table; and for his name--\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne, sire.\"\n\n\"'The Vicomte de Bragelonne!'\" exclaimed the king; changing from a fit\nof laughter to the most profound stupor, and then, after a moment's\nsilence, while he wiped his forehead, which was bedewed with\nperspiration, he again murmured, \"Bragelonne!\"\n\n\"No other, sire.\"\n\n\"Bragelonne, who was affianced to--\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"But--he has been in London.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I can assure you, sire, he is there no longer.\"\n\n\"Is he in Paris, then?\"\n\n\"He is at Minimes, sire, where he is waiting for me, as I have already\nhad the honor of telling you.\"\n\n\"Does he know all?\"\n\n\"Yes; and many things besides. Perhaps your majesty would like to look\nat the letter I have received from him;\" and Saint-Aignan drew from his\npocket the note we are already acquainted with. \"When your majesty has\nread the letter, I will tell you how it reached me.\"\n\nThe king read it in a great agitation, and immediately said, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, sire; your majesty knows a certain carved lock, closing a certain\ndoor of carved ebony, which separates a certain apartment from a certain\nblue and white sanctuary?\"\n\n\"Of course; Louise's boudoir.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. Well, it was in the keyhole of that lock that I found yonder\nnote.\"\n\n\"Who placed it there?\"\n\n\"Either M. de Bragelonne, or the devil himself; but, inasmuch as the\nnote smells of musk and not of sulphur, I conclude that it must be, not\nthe devil, but M. de Bragelonne.\"\n\nLouis bent his head, and seemed absorbed in sad and bitter thought.\nPerhaps something like remorse was at that moment passing through his\nheart. \"The secret is discovered,\" he said.\n\n\"Sire, I shall do my utmost that the secret dies in the breast of the\nman who possesses it!\" said Saint-Aignan, in a tone of bravado, as he\nmoved towards the door; but a gesture of the king made him pause.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Where they await me, sire.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To fight, in all probability.\"\n\n\"_You_ fight!\" exclaimed the king. \"One moment, if you please, monsieur\nle comte!\"\n\nSaint-Aignan shook his head, as a rebellious child does, whenever any\none interferes to prevent him throwing himself into a well, or playing\nwith a knife. \"But, sire,\" he said.\n\n\"In the first place,\" continued the king. \"I want to be enlightened a\nlittle further.\"\n\n\"Upon all points, if your majesty will be pleased to interrogate me,\"\nreplied Saint-Aignan, \"I will throw what light I can.\"\n\n\"Who told you that M. de Bragelonne had penetrated into that room?\"\n\n\"The letter which I found in the keyhole told me.\"\n\n\"Who told you that it was De Bragelonne who put it there?\"\n\n\"Who but himself would have dared to undertake such a mission?\"\n\n\"You are right. How was he able to get into your rooms?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is very serious, inasmuch as all the doors were closed, and my\nlackey, Basque, had the keys in his pocket.\"\n\n\"Your lackey must have been bribed.\"\n\n\"Impossible, sire; for if he had been bribed, those who did so would not\nhave sacrificed the poor fellow, whom, it is not unlikely, they might\nwant to turn to further use by and by, in showing so clearly that it was\nhe whom they had made use of.\"\n\n\"Quite true. And now I can only form one conjecture.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is, sire, and we shall see if it is the same that has\npresented itself to my mind.\"\n\n\"That he effected an entrance by means of the staircase.\"\n\n\"Alas, sire, that seems to me more than probable.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt that some one must have sold the secret of the\ntrap-door.\"\n\n\"Either sold it or given it.\"\n\n\"Why do you make that distinction?\"\n\n\"Because there are certain persons, sire, who, being above the price of\ntreason, give, and do not sell.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! Your majesty's mind is too clear-sighted not to guess what\nI mean, and you will save me the embarrassment of naming the person I\nallude to.\"\n\n\"You are right: you mean Madame; I suppose her suspicions were aroused\nby your changing your lodgings.\"\n\n\"Madame has keys of the apartments of her maids of honor, and she is\npowerful enough to discover what no one but yourself could do, or she\nwould not be able to discover anything.\"\n\n\"And you suppose, then, that my sister must have entered into an\nalliance with Bragelonne, and has informed him of all the details of the\naffair.\"\n\n\"Possibly even better still, for she perhaps accompanied him there.\"\n\n\"Which way? through your own apartments?\"\n\n\"You think it impossible, sire? Well, listen to me. Your majesty knows\nthat Madame is very fond of perfumes?\"\n\n\"Yes, she acquired that taste from my mother.\"\n\n\"Vervain, particularly.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is the scent she prefers to all others.\"\n\n\"Very good, sire! my apartments happen to smell very strongly of\nvervain.\"\n\nThe king remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments, and then\nresumed: \"But why should Madame take Bragelonne's part against me?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan could very easily have replied: \"A woman's jealousy!\" The\nking probed his friend to the bottom of his heart to ascertain if he\nhad learned the secret of his flirtation with his sister-in-law. But\nSaint-Aignan was not an ordinary courtier; he did not lightly run the\nrisk of finding out family secrets; and he was too a friend of the Muses\nnot to think very frequently of poor Ovidius Naso, whose eyes shed so\nmany tears in expiation of his crime for having once beheld something,\none hardly knows what, in the palace of Augustus. He therefore passed\nby Madame's secret very skillfully. But as he had shown no ordinary\nsagacity in indicating Madame's presence in his rooms in company with\nBragelonne, it was necessary, of course, for him to repay with interest\nthe king's _amour propre_, and reply plainly to the question which had\nbeen put to him of: \"Why has Madame taken Bragelonne's part against me?\"\n\n\"Why?\" replied Saint-Aignan. \"Your majesty forgets, I presume, that the\nComte de Guiche is the intimate friend of the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"I do not see the connection, however,\" said the king.\n\n\"Ah! I beg your pardon, then, sire; but I thought the Comte de Guiche\nwas a very great friend of Madame's.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" the king returned; \"there is no occasion to search any\nfurther, the blow came from that direction.\"\n\n\"And is not your majesty of opinion that, in order to ward it off, it\nwill be necessary to deal another blow?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not one of the kind given in the Bois de Vincennes,\" replied\nthe king.\n\n\"You forget, sire,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"that I am a gentleman, and that\nI have been challenged.\"\n\n\"The challenge neither concerns nor was it intended for you.\"\n\n\"But I am the man, sire, who has been expected at the Minimes, sire,\nduring the last hour and more; and I shall be dishonored if I do not\ngo.\"\n\n\"The first honor and duty of a gentleman is obedience to his sovereign.\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"I order you to remain.\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"Obey, monsieur!\"\n\n\"As your majesty pleases.\"\n\n\"Besides, I wish to have the whole of this affair explained; I wish to\nknow how it is that I have been so insolently trifled with, as to have\nthe sanctuary of my affections pried into. It is not you, Saint-Aignan,\nwhose business it is to punish those who have acted in this manner, for\nit is not your honor they have attacked, but my own.\"\n\n\"I implore your majesty not to overwhelm M. de Bragelonne with your\nwrath, for although in the whole of this affair he may have shown\nhimself deficient in prudence, he has not been so in his feelings of\nloyalty.\"\n\n\"Enough! I shall know how to decide between the just and the unjust,\neven in the height of my anger. But take care that not a word of this is\nbreathed to Madame.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do with regard to M. de Bragelonne? He will be seeking\nme in every direction, and--\"\n\n\"I shall either have spoken to him, or taken care that he has been\nspoken to, before the evening is over.\"\n\n\"Let me once more entreat your majesty to be indulgent towards him.\"\n\n\"I have been indulgent long enough, comte,\" said Louis XIV., frowning\nseverely; \"it is now quite time to show certain persons that I am master\nin my own palace.\"\n\nThe king had hardly pronounced these words, which betokened that a fresh\nfeeling of irritation was mingling with the recollections of old, when\nan usher appeared at the door of the cabinet. \"What is the matter?\"\ninquired the king, \"and why do you presume to come when I have not\nsummoned you?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the usher, \"your majesty desired me to permit M. le Comte\nde la Fere to pass freely on any and every occasion, when he might wish\nto speak to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur?\"\n\n\"M. le Comte de la Fere is now waiting to see your majesty.\"\n\nThe king and Saint-Aignan at this reply exchanged a look which betrayed\nmore uneasiness than surprise. Louis hesitated for a moment, but\nimmediately afterwards, seeming to make up his mind, he said:\n\n\"Go, Saint-Aignan, and find Louise; inform her of the plot against us;\ndo not let her be ignorant that Madame will return to her system of\npersecutions against her, and that she has set those to work who would\nhave found it far safer to remain neuter.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"If Louise gets nervous and frightened, reassure her as much as you can;\ntell her that the king's affection is an impenetrable shield over her;\nif, which I suspect is the case, she already knows everything, or if she\nhas already been herself subjected to an attack of some kind or other\nfrom any quarter, tell her, be sure to tell her, Saint-Aignan,\" added\nthe king, trembling with passion, \"tell her, I say, that this time,\ninstead of defending her, I will avenge her, and that too so terribly\nthat no one will in future even dare to raise his eyes towards her.\"\n\n\"Is that all, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, all. Go as quickly as you can, and remain faithful; for, you who\nlive in the midst of this stake of infernal torments, have not, like\nmyself, the hope of the paradise beyond it.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan exhausted himself in protestations of devotion, took the\nking's hand, kissed it, and left the room radiant with delight.\n\n\n\nChapter LVIII. King and Noble.\n\nThe king endeavored to recover his self-possession as quickly as\npossible, in order to meet M. de la Fere with an untroubled countenance.\nHe clearly saw it was not mere chance that had induced the comte's\nvisit, he had some vague impression of its importance; but he felt\nthat to a man of Athos's tone of mind, to one of such a high order of\nintellect, his first reception ought not to present anything either\ndisagreeable or otherwise than kind and courteous. As soon as the king\nhad satisfied himself that, as far as appearances went, he was perfectly\ncalm again, he gave directions to the ushers to introduce the comte. A\nfew minutes afterwards Athos, in full court dress, and with his breast\ncovered with the orders that he alone had the right to wear at the court\nof France, presented himself with so grave and solemn an air that the\nking perceived, at the first glance, that he was not deceived in his\nanticipations. Louis advanced a step towards the comte, and, with a\nsmile, held out his hand to him, over which Athos bowed with the air of\nthe deepest respect.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte de la Fere,\" said the king rapidly, \"you are so\nseldom here, that it is a real piece of good fortune to see you.\"\n\nAthos bowed and replied, \"I should wish always to enjoy the happiness of\nbeing near your majesty.\"\n\nThe tone, however, in which this reply was conveyed, evidently\nsignified, \"I should wish to be one of your majesty's advisers, to save\nyou the commission of faults.\" The king felt it so, and determined\nin this man's presence to preserve all the advantages which could be\nderived from his command over himself, as well as from his rank and\nposition.\n\n\"I see you have something to say to me,\" he said.\n\n\"Had it not been so, I should not have presumed to present myself before\nyour majesty.\"\n\n\"Speak quickly, I am anxious to satisfy you,\" returned the king, seating\nhimself.\n\n\"I am persuaded,\" replied Athos, in a somewhat agitated tone of voice,\n\"that your majesty will give me every satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, with a certain haughtiness of manner, \"you have\ncome to lodge a complaint here, then?\"\n\n\"It would be a complaint,\" returned Athos, \"only in the event of your\nmajesty--but if you will deign to permit me, sire, I will begin the\nconversation from the very commencement.\"\n\n\"Do so, I am listening.\"\n\n\"Your majesty will remember that at the period of the Duke of\nBuckingham's departure, I had the honor of an interview with you.\"\n\n\"At or about that period, I think I remember you did; only, with regard\nto the subject of the conversation, I have quite forgotten it.\"\n\nAthos started, as he replied. \"I shall have the honor to remind your\nmajesty of it. It was with regard to a formal demand I had addressed to\nyou respecting a marriage which M. de Bragelonne wished to contract with\nMademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought the king, \"we have come to it now.--I remember,\" he said,\naloud.\n\n\"At that period,\" pursued Athos, \"your majesty was so kind and generous\ntowards M. de Bragelonne and myself, that not a single word which\nthen fell from your lips has escaped my memory; and, when I asked\nyour majesty to accord me Mademoiselle de la Valliere's hand for M. de\nBragelonne, you refused.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" said Louis, dryly.\n\n\"Alleging,\" Athos hastened to say, \"that the young lady had no position\nin society.\"\n\nLouis could hardly force himself to listen with an appearance of royal\npropriety.\n\n\"That,\" added Athos, \"she had but little fortune.\"\n\nThe king threw himself back in his armchair.\n\n\"That her extraction was indifferent.\"\n\nA renewed impatience on the part of the king.\n\n\"And little beauty,\" added Athos, pitilessly.\n\nThis last bolt buried itself deep in the king's heart, and made him\nalmost bound from his seat.\n\n\"You have a good memory, monsieur,\" he said.\n\n\"I invariably have, on occasions when I have had the distinguished honor\nof an interview with your majesty,\" retorted the comte, without being in\nthe least disconcerted.\n\n\"Very good: it is admitted that I said all that.\"\n\n\"And I thanked your majesty for your remarks at the time, because they\ntestified an interest in M. de Bragelonne which did him much honor.\"\n\n\"And you may possibly remember,\" said the king, very deliberately, \"that\nyou had the greatest repugnance for this marriage.\"\n\n\"Quite true, sire.\"\n\n\"And that you solicited my permission, much against your own\ninclination?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And finally, I remember, for I have a memory nearly as good as your\nown; I remember, I say, that you observed at the time: 'I do not believe\nthat Mademoiselle de la Valliere loves M. de Bragelonne.' Is that true?\"\n\nThe blow told well, but Athos did not draw back. \"Sire,\" he said, \"I\nhave already begged your majesty's forgiveness; but there are certain\nparticulars in that conversation which are only intelligible from the\n_denouement_.\"\n\n\"Well, what is the _denouement_, monsieur?\"\n\n\"This: that your majesty then said, 'that you would defer the marriage\nout of regard for M. de Bragelonne's own interests.'\"\n\nThe king remained silent. \"M. de Bragelonne is now so exceedingly\nunhappy that he cannot any longer defer asking your majesty for a\nsolution of the matter.\"\n\nThe king turned pale; Athos looked at him with fixed attention.\n\n\"And what,\" said the king, with considerable hesitation, \"does M. de\nBragelonne request?\"\n\n\"Precisely the very thing that I came to ask your majesty for at my last\naudience, namely, your majesty's consent to his marriage.\"\n\nThe king remained perfectly silent. \"The questions which referred to\nthe different obstacles in the way are all now quite removed for us,\"\ncontinued Athos. \"Mademoiselle de la Valliere, without fortune, birth,\nor beauty, is not the less on that account the only good match in the\nworld for M. de Bragelonne, since he loves this young girl.\"\n\nThe king pressed his hands impatiently together. \"Does your majesty\nhesitate?\" inquired the comte, without losing a particle of either his\nfirmness of his politeness.\n\n\"I do not hesitate--I refuse,\" replied the king.\n\nAthos paused a moment, as if to collect himself: \"I have had the honor,\"\nhe said, in a mild tone, \"to observe to your majesty that no obstacle\nnow interferes with M. de Bragelonne's affections, and that his\ndetermination seems unalterable.\"\n\n\"There is my will--and that is an obstacle, I should imagine!\"\n\n\"That is the most serious of all,\" Athos replied quickly.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"And may we, therefore, be permitted to ask your majesty, with the\ngreatest humility, your reason for this refusal?\"\n\n\"The reason!--A question to me!\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"A demand, sire!\"\n\nThe king, leaning with both his hands upon the table, said, in a deep\ntone of concentrated passion: \"You have lost all recollection of what is\nusual at court. At court, please to remember, no one ventures to put a\nquestion to the king.\"\n\n\"Very true, sire; but if men do not question, they conjecture.\"\n\n\"Conjecture! What may that mean, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Very frequently, sire, conjecture with regard to a particular subject\nimplies a want of frankness on the part of the king--\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"And a want of confidence on the part of the subject,\" pursued Athos,\nintrepidly.\n\n\"You forget yourself,\" said the king, hurried away by anger in spite of\nall his self-control.\n\n\"Sire, I am obliged to seek elsewhere for what I thought I should find\nin your majesty. Instead of obtaining a reply from you, I am compelled\nto make one for myself.\"\n\nThe king rose. \"Monsieur le comte,\" he said, \"I have now given you all\nthe time I had at my disposal.\" This was a dismissal.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the comte, \"I have not yet had time to tell your majesty\nwhat I came with the express object of saying, and I so rarely see your\nmajesty that I ought to avail myself of the opportunity.\"\n\n\"Just now you spoke rudely of conjectures; you are now becoming\noffensive, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! offend your majesty! I?--never! All my life through I have\nmaintained that kings are above all other men, not only from their rank\nand power, but from their nobleness of heart and their true dignity\nof mind. I never can bring myself to believe that my sovereign, he who\npassed his word to me, did so with a mental reservation.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? what mental reservation do you allude to?\"\n\n\"I will explain my meaning,\" said Athos, coldly. \"If, in refusing\nMademoiselle de la Valliere to Monsieur de Bragelonne, your majesty\nhad some other object in view than the happiness and fortune of the\nvicomte--\"\n\n\"You perceive, monsieur, that you are offending me.\"\n\n\"If, in requiring the vicomte to delay his marriage, your majesty's only\nobject was to remove the gentleman to whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere\nwas engaged--\"\n\n\"Monsieur! monsieur!\"\n\n\"I have heard it said so in every direction, sire. Your majesty's\naffection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere is spoken of on all sides.\"\n\nThe king tore his gloves, which he had been biting for some time. \"Woe\nto those,\" he cried, \"who interfere in my affairs. I have made up\nmy mind to take a particular course, and I will break through every\nobstacle in my way.\"\n\n\"What obstacle?\" said Athos.\n\nThe king stopped short, like a horse which, having taken the bit between\nhis teeth and run away, finds it has slipped it back again, and that\nhis career is checked. \"I love Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" he said\nsuddenly, with mingled nobleness of feeling and passion.\n\n\"But,\" interrupted Athos, \"that does not preclude your majesty from\nallowing M. de Bragelonne to marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The\nsacrifice is worthy of so great a monarch; it is fully merited by M. de\nBragelonne, who has already rendered great service to your majesty,\nand who may well be regarded as a brave and worthy man. Your majesty,\ntherefore, in renouncing the affection you entertain, offers a proof at\nonce of generosity, gratitude, and good policy.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere does not love M. de Bragelonne,\" said the\nking, hoarsely.\n\n\"Does your majesty know that to be the case?\" remarked Athos, with a\nsearching look.\n\n\"I do know it.\"\n\n\"Since a very short time, then; for doubtless, had your majesty known it\nwhen I first preferred my request, you would have taken the trouble to\ninform me of it.\"\n\n\"Since a very short time, it is true, monsieur.\"\n\nAthos remained silent for a moment, and then resumed: \"In that case, I\ndo not understand why your majesty should have sent M. de Bragelonne\nto London. That exile, and most properly so, too, is a matter of\nastonishment to every one who regards your majesty's honor with sincere\naffection.\"\n\n\"Who presumes to impugn my honor, Monsieur de la Fere?\"\n\n\"The king's honor, sire, is made up of the honor of his whole nobility.\nWhenever the king offends one of his gentlemen, that is, whenever he\ndeprives him of the smallest particle of his honor, it is from him, from\nthe king himself, that that portion of honor is stolen.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de la Fere!\" said the king, haughtily.\n\n\"Sire, you sent M. de Bragelonne to London either before you were\nMademoiselle de la Valliere's lover, or since you have become so.\"\n\nThe king, irritated beyond measure, especially because he felt that he\nwas being mastered, endeavored to dismiss Athos by a gesture.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the comte, \"I will tell you all; I will not leave your\npresence until I have been satisfied by your majesty or by myself;\nsatisfied if you prove to me that you are right,--satisfied if I prove\nto you that you are wrong. Nay, sire, you can but listen to me. I am\nold now, and I am attached to everything that is really great and really\npowerful in your kingdom. I am of those who have shed their blood for\nyour father and for yourself, without ever having asked a single favor\neither from yourself or from your father. I have never inflicted the\nslightest wrong or injury on any one in this world, and even kings are\nstill my debtors. You can but listen to me, I repeat. I have come to ask\nyou for an account of the honor of one of your servants whom you have\ndeceived by a falsehood, or betrayed by want of heart of judgment. I\nknow that these words irritate your majesty, but the facts themselves\nare killing us. I know that you are endeavoring to find some\nmeans whereby to chastise me for my frankness; but I know also the\nchastisement I will implore God to inflict upon you when I relate to Him\nyour perjury and my son's unhappiness.\"\n\nThe king during these remarks was walking hurriedly to and fro, his hand\nthrust into the breast of his coat, his head haughtily raised, his eyes\nblazing with wrath. \"Monsieur,\" he cried, suddenly, \"if I acted towards\nyou as a king, you would be already punished; but I am only a man, and\nI have the right to love in this world every one who loves me,--a\nhappiness which is so rarely found.\"\n\n\"You cannot pretend to such a right as a man any more than as a king,\nsire; or if you intend to exercise that right in a loyal manner, you\nshould have told M. de Bragelonne so, and not have exiled him.\"\n\n\"It is too great a condescension, monsieur, to discuss these things with\nyou,\" interrupted Louis XIV., with that majesty of air and manner he\nalone seemed able to give his look and his voice.\n\n\"I was hoping that you would reply to me,\" said the comte.\n\n\"You shall know my reply, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You already know my thoughts on the subject,\" was the Comte de la\nFere's answer.\n\n\"You have forgotten you are speaking to the king, monsieur. It is a\ncrime.\"\n\n\"You have forgotten you are destroying the lives of two men, sire. It is\na mortal sin.\"\n\n\"Leave the room!\"\n\n\"Not until I have said this: 'Son of Louis XIII., you begin your reign\nbadly, for you begin it by abduction and disloyalty! My race--myself\ntoo--are now freed from all that affection and respect towards you,\nwhich I made my son swear to observe in the vaults of Saint-Denis, in\nthe presence of the relics of your noble forefathers. You are now become\nour enemy, sire, and henceforth we have nothing to do save with Heaven\nalone, our sole master. Be warned, be warned, sire.'\"\n\n\"What! do you threaten?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Athos, sadly, \"I have as little bravado as fear in my\nsoul. The God of whom I spoke to you is now listening to me; He knows\nthat for the safety and honor of your crown I would even yet shed every\ndrop of blood twenty years of civil and foreign warfare have left in\nmy veins. I can well say, then, that I threaten the king as little as I\nthreaten the man; but I tell you, sire, you lose two servants; for you\nhave destroyed faith in the heart of the father, and love in the heart\nof the son; the one ceases to believe in the royal word, the other no\nlonger believes in the loyalty of the man, or the purity of woman: the\none is dead to every feeling of respect, the other to obedience. Adieu!\"\n\nThus saying, Athos broke his sword across his knee, slowly placed the\ntwo pieces upon the floor, and saluting the king, who was almost choking\nfrom rage and shame, he quitted the cabinet. Louis, who sat near the\ntable, completely overwhelmed, was several minutes before he could\ncollect himself; but he suddenly rose and rang the bell violently. \"Tell\nM. d'Artagnan to come here,\" he said to the terrified ushers.\n\n\n\nChapter LIX. After the Storm.\n\nOur readers will doubtlessly have been asking themselves how it happened\nthat Athos, of whom not a word has been said for some time past, arrived\nso very opportunely at court. We will, without delay, endeavor to\nsatisfy their curiosity.\n\nPorthos, faithful to his duty as an arranger of affairs, had,\nimmediately after leaving the Palais Royal, set off to join Raoul at the\nMinimes in the Bois de Vincennes, and had related everything, even to\nthe smallest details, which had passed between Saint-Aignan and himself.\nHe finished by saying that the message which the king had sent to his\nfavorite would probably not occasion more than a short delay, and that\nSaint-Aignan, as soon as he could leave the king, would not lose a\nmoment in accepting the invitation Raoul had sent him.\n\nBut Raoul, less credulous than his old friend, had concluded from\nPorthos's recital that if Saint-Aignan was going to the king,\nSaint-Aignan would tell the king everything, and that the king would\nmost assuredly forbid Saint-Aignan to obey the summons he had received\nto the hostile meeting. The consequence of his reflections was, that he\nhad left Porthos to remain at the place appointed for the meeting, in\nthe very improbable case that Saint-Aignan would come there; having\nendeavored to make Porthos promise that he would not remain there\nmore than an hour or an hour and a half at the very longest. Porthos,\nhowever, formally refused to do anything of the kind, but, on the\ncontrary, installed himself in the Minimes as if he were going to\ntake root there, making Raoul promise that when he had been to see his\nfather, he would return to his own apartments, in order that Porthos's\nservant might know where to find him in case M. de Saint-Aignan should\nhappen to come to the rendezvous.\n\nBragelonne had left Vincennes, and proceeded at once straight to the\napartments of Athos, who had been in Paris during the last two days, the\ncomte having been already informed of what had taken place, by a letter\nfrom D'Artagnan. Raoul arrived at his father's; Athos, after having held\nout his hand to him, and embraced him most affectionately, made a sign\nfor him to sit down.\n\n\"I know you come to me as a man would go to a friend, vicomte, whenever\nhe is suffering; tell me, therefore, what is it that brings you now.\"\n\nThe young man bowed, and began his recital; more than once in the course\nof it his tears almost choked his utterance, and a sob, checked in his\nthroat, compelled him to suspend his narrative for a few minutes. Athos\nmost probably already knew how matters stood, as we have just now\nsaid D'Artagnan had already written to him; but, preserving until the\nconclusion that calm, unruffled composure of manner which constituted\nthe almost superhuman side of his character, he replied, \"Raoul, I do\nnot believe there is a word of truth in these rumors; I do not believe\nin the existence of what you fear, although I do not deny that persons\nbest entitled to the fullest credit have already conversed with me on\nthe subject. In my heart and soul I think it utterly impossible that the\nking could be guilty of such an outrage on a gentleman. I will answer\nfor the king, therefore, and will soon bring you back the proof of what\nI say.\"\n\nRaoul, wavering like a drunken man between what he had seen with his own\neyes and the imperturbable faith he had in a man who had never told a\nfalsehood, bowed and simply answered, \"Go, then, monsieur le comte; I\nwill await your return.\" And he sat down, burying his face in his hands.\nAthos dressed, and then left him, in order to wait upon the king; the\nresult of that interview is already known to our readers.\n\nWhen he returned to his lodgings, Raoul, pale and dejected, had not\nquitted his attitude of despair. At the sound, however, of the opening\ndoors, and of his father's footsteps as he approached him, the young man\nraised his head. Athos's face was very pale, his head uncovered, and\nhis manner full of seriousness; he gave his cloak and hat to the lackey,\ndismissed him with a gesture, and sat down near Raoul.\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" inquired the young man, \"are you convinced yet?\"\n\n\"I am, Raoul; the king loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"He confesses it, then?\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"And she?\"\n\n\"I have not seen her.\"\n\n\"No; but the king spoke to you about her. What did he say?\"\n\n\"He says that she loves him.\"\n\n\"Oh, you see--you see, monsieur!\" said the young man, with a gesture of\ndespair.\n\n\"Raoul,\" resumed the comte, \"I told the king, believe me, all that you\nyourself could possibly have urged, and I believe I did so in becoming\nlanguage, though sufficiently firm.\"\n\n\"And what did you say to him, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I told him, Raoul, that everything was now at an end between him and\nourselves; that you would never serve him again. I told him that I, too,\nshould remain aloof. Nothing further remains for me, then, but to be\nsatisfied of one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Whether you have determined to adopt any steps.\"\n\n\"Any steps? Regarding what?\"\n\n\"With reference to your disappointed affection, and--your ideas of\nvengeance.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, with regard to my affection, I shall, perhaps, some day\nor other, succeed in tearing it from my heart; I trust I shall do so,\naided by Heaven's merciful help, and your own wise exhortations. As\nfar as vengeance is concerned, it occurred to me only when under the\ninfluence of an evil thought, for I could not revenge myself upon the\none who is actually guilty; I have, therefore, already renounced every\nidea of revenge.\"\n\n\"And you no longer think of seeking a quarrel with M. de Saint-Aignan?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I sent him a challenge: if M. de Saint-Aignan accepts it,\nI will maintain it; if he does not take it up, I will leave things as\nthey are.\"\n\n\"And La Valliere?\"\n\n\"You cannot, I know, have seriously thought that I should dream of\nrevenging myself upon a woman!\" replied Raoul, with a smile so sad that\na tear started even to the eyes of his father, who had so many times\nin the course of his life bowed beneath his own sorrows and those of\nothers.\n\nHe held out his hand to Raoul, which the latter seized most eagerly.\n\n\"And so, monsieur le comte, you are quite satisfied that the misfortune\nis one beyond all remedy?\" inquired the young man.\n\n\"Poor boy!\" he murmured.\n\n\"You think that I still live in hope,\" said Raoul, \"and you pity me. Oh,\nit is indeed horrible suffering for me to despise, as I am bound to\ndo, the one I have loved so devotedly. If I had but some real cause of\ncomplaint against her, I should be happy, I should be able to forgive\nher.\"\n\nAthos looked at his son with a profoundly sorrowful air, for the words\nRaoul had just pronounced seemed to have issued out of his own heart. At\nthis moment the servant announced M. d'Artagnan. This name sounded very\ndifferently to the ears of Athos and Raoul. The musketeer entered the\nroom with a vague smile on his lips. Raoul paused. Athos walked towards\nhis friend with an expression of face that did not escape Bragelonne.\nD'Artagnan answered Athos's look by an imperceptible movement of the\neyelid; and then, advancing towards Raoul, whom he took by the hand, he\nsaid, addressing both father and son, \"Well, you are trying to console\nthis poor boy, it seems.\"\n\n\"And you, kind and good as usual, have come to help me in my difficult\ntask.\"\n\nAs he said this, Athos pressed D'Artagnan's hand between both his own.\nRaoul fancied he observed in this pressure something beyond the sense\nhis mere words conveyed.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the musketeer, smoothing his mustache with the hand that\nAthos had left free, \"yes, I have come too.\"\n\n\"You are most welcome, chevalier; not for the consolation you bring with\nyou, but on your own account. I am already consoled,\" said Raoul; and\nhe attempted to smile, but the effort was more sad than any tears\nD'Artagnan had ever seen shed.\n\n\"That is all well and good, then,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Only,\" continued Raoul, \"you have arrived just as the comte was about\nto give me the details of his interview with the king. You will allow\nthe comte to continue?\" added the young man, as, with his eyes fixed on\nthe musketeer, he seemed to read the very depths of his heart.\n\n\"His interview with the king?\" said D'Artagnan, in a tone so natural and\nunassumed that there was no means of suspecting that his astonishment\nwas feigned. \"You have seen the king, then, Athos?\"\n\nAthos smiled as he said, \"Yes, I have seen him.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed; you were unaware, then, that the comte had seen his\nmajesty?\" inquired Raoul, half reassured.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, quite so.\"\n\n\"In that case, I am less uneasy,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Uneasy--and about what?\" inquired Athos.\n\n\"Forgive me, monsieur,\" said Raoul, \"but knowing so well the regard\nand affection you have for me, I was afraid you might possibly have\nexpressed somewhat plainly to his majesty my own sufferings and your\nindignation, and that the king had consequently--\"\n\n\"And that the king had consequently?\" repeated D'Artagnan; \"well, go on,\nfinish what you were going to say.\"\n\n\"I have now to ask you to forgive me, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Raoul.\n\"For a moment, and I cannot help confessing it, I trembled lest you had\ncome here, not as M. d'Artagnan, but as captain of the musketeers.\"\n\n\"You are mad, my poor boy,\" cried D'Artagnan, with a burst of laughter,\nin which an exact observer might perhaps have wished to have heard a\nlittle more frankness.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, mad; and do you know what I would advise you to do?\"\n\n\"Tell me, monsieur, for the advice is sure to be good, as it comes from\nyou.\"\n\n\"Very good, then; I advise you, after your long journey from England,\nafter your visit to M. de Guiche, after your visit to Madame, after your\nvisit to Porthos, after your journey to Vincennes, I advise you, I say,\nto take a few hours' rest; go and lie down, sleep for a dozen hours, and\nwhen you wake up, go and ride one of my horses until you have tired him\nto death.\"\n\nAnd drawing Raoul towards him, he embraced him as he would have done his\nown child. Athos did the like; only it was very visible that the kiss\nwas still more affectionate, and the pressure of his lips even warmer\nwith the father than with the friend. The young man again looked at both\nhis companions, endeavoring to penetrate their real meaning or their\nreal feelings with the utmost strength of his intelligence; but his look\nwas powerless upon the smiling countenance of the musketeer or upon\nthe calm and composed features of the Comte de la Fere. \"Where are you\ngoing, Raoul?\" inquired the latter, seeing that Bragelonne was preparing\nto go out.\n\n\"To my own apartments,\" replied the latter, in his soft, sad voice.\n\n\"We shall be sure to find you there, then, if we should have anything to\nsay to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; but do you suppose it likely you will have something to\nsay to me?\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Yes, something fresh to console you with,\" said D'Artagnan, pushing him\ntowards the door.\n\nRaoul, observing the perfect composure which marked every gesture of his\ntwo friends, quitted the comte's room, carrying away with him nothing\nbut the individual feeling of his own particular distress.\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" he said, \"since that is the case, I need only think of\nmyself.\"\n\nAnd wrapping himself up in his cloak, in order to conceal from the\npassers-by in the streets his gloomy and sorrowful face, he quitted\nthem, for the purpose of returning to his own rooms, as he had promised\nPorthos. The two friends watched the young man as he walked away with\na feeling of genuine disinterested pity; only each expressed it in a\ndifferent way.\n\n\"Poor Raoul!\" said Athos, sighing deeply.\n\n\"Poor Raoul!\" said D'Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\n\nChapter LX. Heu! Miser!\n\n\"Poor Raoul!\" had said Athos. \"Poor Raoul!\" had said D'Artagnan: and,\nin point of fact, to be pitied by both these men, Raoul must indeed have\nbeen most unhappy. And therefore, when he found himself alone, face to\nface, as it were, with his own troubles, leaving behind him the intrepid\nfriend and the indulgent father; when he recalled the avowal of the\nking's affection, which had robbed him of Louise de la Valliere, whom\nhe loved so deeply, he felt his heart almost breaking, as indeed we all\nhave at least once in our lives, at the first illusion destroyed, the\nfirst affection betrayed. \"Oh!\" he murmured, \"all is over, then. Nothing\nis now left me in this world. Nothing to look forward to, nothing to\nhope for. Guiche has told me so, my father has told me so, M. d'Artagnan\nhas told me so. All life is but an idle dream. The future which I have\nbeen hopelessly pursuing for the last ten years is a dream! the union of\nhearts, a dream! a life of love and happiness, a dream! Poor fool that\nI am,\" he continued, after a pause, \"to dream away my existence aloud,\npublicly, and in the face of others, friends and enemies--and for what\npurpose, too? in order that my friends may be saddened by my troubles,\nand my enemies may laugh at my sorrows. And so my unhappiness will soon\nbecome a notorious disgrace, a public scandal; and who knows but that\nto-morrow I may even be a public laughing-stock?\"\n\nAnd, despite the composure which he had promised his father and\nD'Artagnan to observe, Raoul could not resist uttering a few words of\ndarkest menace. \"And yet,\" he continued, \"if my name were De Wardes, and\nif I had the pliancy of character and strength of will of M. d'Artagnan,\nI should laugh, with my lips at least; I should convince other women\nthat this perfidious girl, honored by the affection I have wasted on\nher, leaves me only one regret, that of having been abused and deceived\nby her seemingly modest and irreproachable conduct; a few might perhaps\nfawn on the king by jesting at my expense; I should put myself on\nthe track of some of those buffoons; I should chastise a few of them,\nperhaps; the men would fear me, and by the time I had laid three dying\nor dead at my feet, I should be adored by the women. Yes, yes, that,\nindeed, would be the proper course to adopt, and the Comte de la Fere\nhimself would not object to it. Has not he also been tried, in his\nearlier days, in the same manner as I have just been tried myself? Did\nhe not replace affection by intoxication? He has often told me so. Why\nshould I not replace love by pleasure? He must have suffered as much as\nI suffer, even more--if that is possible. The history of one man is the\nhistory of all, a dragging trial, more or less prolonged, more or less\nbitter--sorrowful. The note of human nature is nothing but one sustained\ncry. But what are the sufferings of others compared to those from which\nI am now suffering? Does the open wound in another's breast soften the\nanguish of the gaping ulcer in our own? Does the blood which is welling\nfrom another man's side stanch that which is pouring from our own? Does\nthe general grief of our fellow-creatures lessen our own private and\nparticular woe? No, no, each suffers on his own account, each struggles\nwith his own grief, each sheds his own tears. And besides,\" he went on,\n\"what has my life been up to the present moment? A cold, barren, sterile\narena, in which I have always fought for others, never for myself.\nSometimes for a king, sometimes for a woman. The king has betrayed, the\nwoman disdained me. Miserable, unlucky wretch that I am! Women! Can I\nnot make all expiate the crime of one of their sex? What does that\nneed? To have a heart no longer, or to forget that I ever had one; to\nbe strong, even against weakness itself; to lean always, even when\none feels that the support is giving way. What is needed to attain, or\nsucceed in all that? To be young, handsome, strong, valiant, rich. I\nam, or shall be, all that. But honor?\" he still continued, \"and what is\nhonor after all? A theory which every man understands in his own way. My\nfather tells me: 'Honor is the consideration of what is due to others,\nand particularly what is due to oneself.' But Guiche, and Manicamp,\nand Saint-Aignan particularly, would say to me: 'What's honor? Honor\nconsists in studying and yielding to the passions and pleasures of one's\nking.' Honor such as that indeed, is easy and productive enough. With\nhonor like that, I can keep my post at the court, become a gentleman of\nthe chamber, and accept the command of a regiment, which may at any time\nbe presented to me. With honor such as that, I can be duke and peer.\n\n\"The stain which that woman has stamped upon me, the grief that has\nbroken my heart, the heart of the friend and playmate of her childhood,\nin no way affects M. de Bragelonne, an excellent officer, a courageous\nleader, who will cover himself with glory at the first encounter, and\nwho will become a hundred times greater than Mademoiselle de la Valliere\nis to-day, the mistress of the king--for the king will not marry\nher--and the more publicly he will proclaim her as his mistress, the\nmore opaque will grow the shadow of shame he casts upon her face, in the\nguise of a crown; and in proportion as others despise, as I despise her,\nI shall be gleaning honors in the field. Alas! we had walked together\nside by side, she and I, during the earliest, the brightest, the most\nangelic portion of our existence, hand in hand along the charming path\nof life, covered with the blossoms of youth; and then, alas! we reach\na cross-road, where she separates herself from me, in which we have\nto follow a different route, whereby we become more and more widely\nseparated from each other. And to attain the end of this path, oh,\nHeaven! I am now alone, in utter despair, and crushed to the very\nearth.\"\n\nSuch were the sinister reflections in which Raoul indulged, when his\nfoot mechanically paused at the door of his own dwelling. He had reached\nit without remarking the streets through which he passed, without\nknowing how he had come; he pushed open the door, continued to advance,\nand ascended the staircase. The staircase, as in most of the houses at\nthat period, was very dark, and the landings most obscure. Raoul lived\non the first floor; he paused in order to ring. Olivain appeared, took\nhis sword and cloak from his hands; Raoul himself opened the door which,\nfrom the ante-chamber, led into a small _salon_, richly furnished enough\nfor the _salon_ of a young man, and completely filled with flowers by\nOlivain, who, knowing his master's tastes, had shown himself studiously\nattentive in gratifying them, without caring whether his master\nperceived his attention or not. There was a portrait of La Valliere in\nthe _salon_, which had been drawn by herself and given by her to Raoul.\nThis portrait, fastened above a large easy chair covered with dark\ncolored damask, was the first point towards which Raoul bent his\nsteps--the first object on which he fixed his eyes. It was, moreover,\nRaoul's usual habit to do so; every time he entered his room, this\nportrait, before anything else, attracted his attention. This time, as\nusual, he walked straight up to the portrait, placed his knees upon the\narm chair, and paused to look at it sadly. His arms were crossed upon\nhis breast, his head slightly thrown back, his eyes filled with tears,\nhis mouth worked into a bitter smile. He looked at the portrait of\nthe one he had so tenderly loved; and then all that he had said passed\nbefore his mind again, all that he had suffered seemed again to assail\nhis heart; and, after a long silence, he murmured for the third time,\n\"Miserable, unhappy wretch that I am!\"\n\nHe had hardly pronounced these words, when he heard the sound of a sigh\nand a groan behind him. He turned sharply round and perceived, in the\nangle of the _salon_, standing up, a bending veiled female figure, which\nhe had been the means of concealing behind the door as he opened it,\nand which he had not perceived as he entered. He advanced towards the\nfigure, whose presence in his room had not been announced to him; and\nas he bowed, and inquired at the same moment who she was, she suddenly\nraised her head, and removed the veil from her face, revealing her pale\nand sorrow-stricken features. Raoul staggered back as if he had seen a\nghost.\n\n\"Louise!\" he cried, in a tone of such absolute despair, one could hardly\nhave thought the human voice was capable of so desponding a cry, without\nthe snapping of the human heart.\n\n\n\n\nChapter LXI. Wounds within Wounds.\n\nMademoiselle de la Valliere--for it was indeed she--advanced a few steps\ntowards him. \"Yes--Louise,\" she murmured.\n\nBut this interval, short as it had been, was quite sufficient for Raoul\nto recover himself. \"You, mademoiselle?\" he said; and then added, in an\nindefinable tone, \"You here!\"\n\n\"Yes, Raoul,\" the young girl replied, \"I have been waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon. When I came into the room I was not aware--\"\n\n\"I know--but I entreated Olivain not to tell you--\" She hesitated; and\nas Raoul did not attempt to interrupt her, a moment's silence ensued,\nduring which the sound of their throbbing hearts might have been heard,\nnot in unison with each other, but the one beating as violently as the\nother. It was for Louise to speak, and she made an effort to do so.\n\n\"I wished to speak to you,\" she said. \"It was absolutely necessary that\nI should see you--myself--alone. I have not hesitated to adopt a step\nwhich must remain secret; for no one, except yourself, could understand\nmy motive, Monsieur de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"In fact, mademoiselle,\" Raoul stammered out, almost breathless from\nemotion, \"as far as I am concerned, and despite the good opinion you\nhave of me, I confess--\"\n\n\"Will you do me the great kindness to sit down and listen to me?\" said\nLouise, interrupting him with her soft, sweet voice.\n\nBragelonne looked at her for a moment; then mournfully shaking his head,\nhe sat, or rather fell down on a chair. \"Speak,\" he said.\n\nShe cast a glance all round her. This look was a timid entreaty, and\nimplored secrecy far more effectually than her expressed words had\ndone a few minutes before. Raoul rouse, and went to the door, which he\nopened. \"Olivain,\" he said, \"I am not within for any one.\" And then,\nturning towards Louise, he added, \"Is not that what you wished?\"\n\nNothing could have produced a greater effect upon Louise than these few\nwords, which seemed to signify, \"You see that I still understand\nyou.\" She passed a handkerchief across her eyes, in order to remove a\nrebellious tear which she could not restrain; and then, having collected\nherself for a moment, she said, \"Raoul, do not turn your kind, frank\nlook away from me. You are not one of those men who despise a woman\nfor having given her heart to another, even though her affection might\nrender him unhappy, or might wound his pride.\" Raoul did not reply.\n\n\"Alas!\" continued La Valliere, \"it is only too true, my cause is a bad\none, and I cannot tell in what way to begin. It will be better for me,\nI think, to relate to you, very simply, everything that has befallen me.\nAs I shall speak but the pure and simple truth, I shall always find my\npath clear before me in spite of the obscurity and obstacles I have to\nbrave in order to solace my heart, which is full to overflowing, and\nwishes to pour itself out at your feet.\"\n\nRaoul continued to preserve the same unbroken silence. La Valliere\nlooked at him with an air that seemed to say, \"Encourage me; for pity's\nsake, but a single word!\" But Raoul did not open his lips; and the young\ngirl was obliged to continue:\n\n\"Just now,\" she said, \"M. de Saint-Aignan came to me by the king's\ndirections.\" She cast down her eyes as she said this; while Raoul, on\nhis side, turned his away, in order to avoid looking at her. \"M. de\nSaint-Aignan came to me from the king,\" she repeated, \"and told me\nthat you knew all;\" and she attempted to look Raoul in the face, after\ninflicting this further wound upon him, in addition to the many others\nhe had already received; but it was impossible to meet Raoul's eyes.\n\n\"He told me you were incensed with me--and justly so, I admit.\"\n\nThis time Raoul looked at the young girl, and a smile full of disdain\npassed across his lips.\n\n\"Oh!\" she continued, \"I entreat you, do not say that you have had any\nother feeling against me than that of anger merely. Raoul, wait until\nI have told you all--wait until I have said to you all that I had to\nsay--all that I came to say.\"\n\nRaoul, by the strength of his iron will, forced his features to assume a\ncalmer expression, and the disdainful smile upon his lip passed away.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said La Valliere, \"in the first place, with my\nhands raised in entreaty towards you, with my forehead bowed to the\nground before you, I entreat you, as the most generous, as the noblest\nof men, to pardon, to forgive me. If I have left you in ignorance\nof what was passing in my own bosom, never, at least, would I have\nconsented to deceive you. Oh! I entreat you, Raoul--I implore you on my\nknees--answer me one word, even though you wrong me in doing so. Better,\nfar better, an injurious word from your lips, than suspicion resting in\nyour heart.\"\n\n\"I admire your subtlety of expression, mademoiselle,\" said Raoul, making\nan effort to remain calm. \"To leave another in ignorance that you are\ndeceiving him, is loyal; but to deceive him--it seems that would be very\nwrong, and that you would not do it.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, for a long time I thought that I loved you better than\nanything else; and so long as I believed in my affection for you, I told\nyou that loved you. I could have sworn it on the altar; but a day came\nwhen I was undeceived.\"\n\n\"Well, on that day, mademoiselle, knowing that I still continued to love\nyou, true loyalty of conduct should have forced you to inform me you had\nceased to love me.\"\n\n\"But on that day, Raoul--on that day, when I read in the depths of my\nown heart, when I confessed to myself that you no longer filled my mind\nentirely, when I saw another future before me than that of being your\nfriend, your life-long companion, your wife--on that day, Raoul, you\nwere not, alas! any more beside me.\"\n\n\"But you knew where I was, mademoiselle; you could have written to me.\"\n\n\"Raoul, I did not dare to do so. Raoul, I have been weak and cowardly.\nI knew you so thoroughly--I knew how devotedly you loved me, that I\ntrembled at the bare idea of the grief I was about to cause you; and\nthat is so true, Raoul, that this very moment I am now speaking to you,\nbending thus before you, my heart crushed in my bosom, my voice full of\nsighs, my eyes full of tears, it is so perfectly true, that I have no\nother defense than my frankness, I have no other sorrow greater than\nthat which I read in your eyes.\"\n\nRaoul attempted to smile.\n\n\"No!\" said the young girl, with a profound conviction, \"no, no; you will\nnot do me so foul a wrong as to disguise your feelings before me now!\nYou loved me; you were sure of your affection for me; you did not\ndeceive yourself; you do not lie to your own heart--whilst I--I--\" And\npale as death, her arms thrown despairingly above her head, she fell\nupon her knees.\n\n\"Whilst you,\" said Raoul, \"you told me you loved me, and yet you loved\nanother.\"\n\n\"Alas, yes!\" cried the poor girl; \"alas, yes! I do love another; and\nthat other--oh! for Heaven's sake let me say it, Raoul, for it is my\nonly excuse--that other I love better than my own life, better than my\nown soul even. Forgive my fault, or punish my treason, Raoul. I came\nhere in no way to defend myself, but merely to say to you: 'You know\nwhat it is to love!'--in such a case am I! I love to that degree, that\nI would give my life, my very soul, to the man I love. If he should ever\ncease to love me, I shall die of grief and despair, unless Heaven come\nto my assistance, unless Heaven does show pity upon me. Raoul, I came\nhere to submit myself to your will, whatever it might be--to die, if it\nwere your wish I should die. Kill me, then, Raoul! if in your heart you\nbelieve I deserve death.\"\n\n\"Take care, mademoiselle,\" said Raoul: \"the woman who invites death is\none who has nothing but her heart's blood to offer to her deceived and\nbetrayed lover.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" she said.\n\nRaoul uttered a deep sigh, as he exclaimed, \"And you love without being\nable to forget?\"\n\n\"I love without a wish to forget; without a wish ever to love any one\nelse,\" replied La Valliere.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Raoul. \"You have said to me, in fact, all you had to\nsay; all I could possibly wish to know. And now, mademoiselle, it is I\nwho ask your forgiveness, for it is I who have almost been an obstacle\nin your life; I, too, who have been wrong, for, in deceiving myself, I\nhelped to deceive you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said La Valliere, \"I do not ask you so much as that, Raoul.\"\n\n\"I only am to blame, mademoiselle,\" continued Raoul, \"better informed\nthan yourself of the difficulties of this life, I should have\nenlightened you. I ought not to have relied upon uncertainty; I ought to\nhave extracted an answer from your heart, whilst I hardly even sought an\nacknowledgement from your lips. Once more, mademoiselle, it is I who ask\nyour forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Impossible, impossible!\" she cried, \"you are mocking me.\"\n\n\"How, impossible?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is impossible to be so good, and kind, ah! perfect to such a\ndegree as that.\"\n\n\"Take care!\" said Raoul, with a bitter smile, \"for presently you may say\nperhaps I did not love you.\"\n\n\"Oh! you love me like an affectionate brother; let me hope that, Raoul.\"\n\n\"As a brother! undeceive yourself, Louise. I love you as a lover--as a\nhusband, with the deepest, the truest, the fondest affection.\"\n\n\"Raoul, Raoul!\"\n\n\"As a brother! Oh, Louise! I love you so deeply, that I would have\nshed my blood for you, drop by drop; I would, oh! how willingly, have\nsuffered myself to be torn to pieces for your sake, have sacrificed my\nvery future for you. I love you so deeply, Louise, that my heart feels\ndead and crushed within me,--my faith in human nature all is gone,--my\neyes have lost their light; I loved you so deeply, that I now no longer\nsee, think of, care for, anything, either in this world or the next.\"\n\n\"Raoul--dear Raoul! spare me, I implore you!\" cried La Valliere. \"Oh! if\nI had but known--\"\n\n\"It is too late, Louise; you love, you are happy in your affection;\nI read your happiness through your tears--behind the tears which the\nloyalty of your nature makes you shed; I feel the sighs your affection\nbreathes forth. Louise, Louise, you have made me the most abjectly\nwretched man living; leave me, I entreat you. Adieu! adieu!\"\n\n\"Forgive me! oh, forgive me, Raoul, for what I have done.\"\n\n\"Have I not done much, much more? _Have I not told you that I love you\nstill?_\" She buried her face in her hands.\n\n\"And to tell you that--do you hear me, Louise?--to tell you that, at\nsuch a moment as this, to tell you that, as I have told you, is to\npronounce my own sentence of death. Adieu!\" La Valliere held out her\nhands to him in vain.\n\n\"We ought not to see each other again in this world,\" he said, and as\nshe was on the point of crying out in bitter agony at this remark, he\nplaced his hand on her mouth to stifle the exclamation. She pressed her\nlips upon it, and fell fainting to the ground. \"Olivain,\" said Raoul,\n\"take this young lady and bear her to the carriage which is waiting for\nher at the door.\" As Olivain lifted her up, Raoul made a movement as if\nto dart towards La Valliere, in order to give her a first and last kiss,\nbut, stopping abruptly, he said, \"No! she is not mine. I am no thief--as\nis the king of France.\" And he returned to his room, whilst the lackey\ncarried La Valliere, still fainting, to the carriage.\n\n\n\nChapter LXII. What Raoul Had Guessed.\n\nAs soon as Raoul had quitted Athos and D'Artagnan, as the two\nexclamations that had followed his departure escaped their lips, they\nfound themselves face to face alone. Athos immediately resumed the\nearnest air that he had assumed at D'Artagnan's arrival.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what have you come to announce to me, my friend?\"\n\n\"I?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes; I do not see you in this way without some reason for it,\" said\nAthos, smiling.\n\n\"The deuce!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I will place you at your ease. The king is furious, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well, I must say he is not altogether pleased.\"\n\n\"And you have come to arrest me, then?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, you have hit the very mark.\"\n\n\"Oh, I expected it. I am quite ready to go with you.\"\n\n\"Deuce take it!\" said D'Artagnan, \"what a hurry you are in.\"\n\n\"I am afraid of delaying you,\" said Athos, smiling.\n\n\"I have plenty of time. Are you not curious, besides, to know how things\nwent on between the king and me?\"\n\n\"If you will be good enough to tell me, I will listen with the greatest\nof pleasure,\" said Athos, pointing out to D'Artagnan a large chair, into\nwhich the latter threw himself, assuming the easiest possible attitude.\n\n\"Well, I will do so willingly enough,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"for the\nconversation is rather curious, I must say. In the first place the king\nsent for me.\"\n\n\"As soon as I had left?\"\n\n\"You were just going down the last steps of the staircase, as the\nmusketeers told me. I arrived. My dear Athos, he was not red in the face\nmerely, he was positively purple. I was not aware, of course, of what\nhad passed; only, on the ground, lying on the floor, I saw a sword\nbroken in two.\"\n\n\"'Captain d'Artagnan,' cried the king, as soon as he saw me.\n\n\"'Sire,' I replied.\n\n\"'M. de la Fere has just left me; he is an insolent man.'\n\n\"'An insolent man!' I exclaimed, in such a tone that the king stopped\nsuddenly short.\n\n\"'Captain d'Artagnan,' resumed the king, with his teeth clenched, 'you\nwill be good enough to listen to and hear me.'\n\n\"'That is my duty, sire.'\n\n\"'I have, out of consideration for M. de la Fere, wished to spare\nhim--he is a man of whom I still retain some kind recollections--the\ndiscredit of being arrested in my palace. You will therefore take a\ncarriage.' At this I made a slight movement.\n\n\"'If you object to arrest him yourself,' continued the king, 'send me my\ncaptain of the guards.'\n\n\"'Sire,' I replied, 'there is no necessity for the captain of the\nguards, since I am on duty.'\n\n\"'I should not like to annoy you,' said the king, kindly, 'for you have\nalways served me well, Monsieur D'Artagnan.'\n\n\"'You do not \"annoy\" me, sire,' I replied; 'I am on duty, that is all.'\n\n\"'But,' said the king, in astonishment, 'I believe the comte is your\nfriend?'\n\n\"'If he were my father, sire, it would not make me less on duty than I\nam.'\n\n\"The king looked at me; he saw how unmoved my face was, and seemed\nsatisfied. 'You will arrest M. le Comte de la Fere, then?' he inquired.\n\n\"'Most certainly, sire, if you give me the order to do so.'\n\n\"'Very well; I order you to do so.'\n\n\"I bowed, and replied, 'Where is the comte, sire?'\n\n\"'You will look for him.'\n\n\"'And am I to arrest him, wherever he may be?'\n\n\"'Yes; but try that he may be at his own house. If he should have\nstarted for his own estate, leave Paris at once, and arrest him on his\nway thither.'\n\n\"I bowed; but as I did not move, he said, 'Well, what are you waiting\nfor?'\n\n\"'For the order to arrest the comte, signed by yourself.'\n\n\"The king seemed annoyed; for, in point of fact, it was the exercise of\na fresh act of authority, a repetition of the arbitrary act, if, indeed,\nit is to be considered as such. He took hold of his pen slowly, and\nevidently in no very good temper; and then he wrote, 'Order for M. le\nChevalier d'Artagnan, captain of my musketeers, to arrest M. le Comte de\nla Fere, wherever he is to be found.' He then turned towards me; but I\nwas looking on without moving a muscle of my face. In all probability he\nthought he perceived something like bravado in my tranquil manner,\nfor he signed hurriedly, and then handing me the order, he said, 'Go,\nmonsieur!' I obeyed; and here I am.\"\n\nAthos pressed his friend's hand. \"Well, let us set off,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh! surely,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you must have some trifling matters to\narrange before you leave your apartments in this manner.\"\n\n\"I?--not at all.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Why, you know, D'Artagnan, that I have always been a very simple\ntraveler on this earth, ready to go to the end of the world by the order\nof my sovereign; ready to quit it at the summons of my Maker. What does\na man who is thus prepared require in such a case?--a portmanteau, or\na shroud. I am ready at this moment, as I have always been, my dear\nfriend, and can accompany you at once.\"\n\n\"But, Bragelonne--\"\n\n\"I have brought him up in the same principles I laid down for my\nown guidance; and you observed that, as soon as he perceived you, he\nguessed, that very moment, the motive of your visit. We have thrown him\noff his guard for a moment; but do not be uneasy, he is sufficiently\nprepared for my disgrace not to be too much alarmed at it. So, let us\ngo.\"\n\n\"Very well, let us go,\" said D'Artagnan, quietly.\n\n\"As I broke my sword in the king's presence, and threw the pieces at his\nfeet, I presume that will dispense with the necessity of delivering it\nover to you.\"\n\n\"You are quite right; and besides that, what the deuce do you suppose I\ncould do with your sword?\"\n\n\"Am I to walk behind, or before you?\" inquired Athos, laughing.\n\n\"You will walk arm in arm with me,\" replied D'Artagnan, as he took the\ncomte's arm to descend the staircase; and in this manner they arrived at\nthe landing. Grimaud, whom they had met in the ante-room, looked at them\nas they went out together in this manner, with some little uneasiness;\nhis experience of affairs was quite sufficient to give him good reason\nto suspect that there was something wrong.\n\n\"Ah! is that you, Grimaud?\" said Athos, kindly. \"We are going--\"\n\n\"To take a turn in my carriage,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, with a friendly\nnod of the head.\n\nGrimaud thanked D'Artagnan by a grimace, which was evidently intended\nfor a smile, and accompanied both the friends to the door. Athos entered\nfirst into the carriage; D'Artagnan followed him without saying a word\nto the coachman. The departure had taken place so quietly, that it\nexcited no disturbance or attention even in the neighborhood. When the\ncarriage had reached the quays, \"You are taking me to the Bastile, I\nperceive,\" said Athos.\n\n\"I?\" said D'Artagnan, \"I take you wherever you may choose to go; nowhere\nelse, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said the comte, surprised.\n\n\"Why, surely, my dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you quite understand\nthat I undertook the mission with no other object in view than that of\ncarrying it out exactly as you liked. You surely did not expect that I\nwas going to get you thrown into prison like that, brutally, and without\nany reflection. If I had anticipated that, I should have let the captain\nof the guards undertake it.\"\n\n\"And so--?\" said Athos.\n\n\"And so, I repeat again, we will go wherever you may choose.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Athos, embracing D'Artagnan, \"how like you that\nis!\"\n\n\"Well, it seems simple enough to me. The coachman will take you to the\nbarrier of the Cours-la-Reine; you will find a horse there which I have\nordered to be kept ready for you; with that horse you will be able to do\nthree posts without stopping; and I, on my side, will take care not to\nreturn to the king, to tell him that you have gone away, until the very\nmoment it will be impossible to overtake you. In the meantime you will\nhave reached Le Havre, and from Le Havre across to England, where you\nwill find the charming residence of which M. Monk made me a present,\nwithout speaking of the hospitality which King Charles will not fail to\nshow you. Well, what do you think of this project?\"\n\nAthos shook his head, and then said, smiling as he did so, \"No, no, take\nme to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"You are an obstinate fellow, my dear Athos,\" returned D'Artagnan,\n\"reflect for a few moments.\"\n\n\"On what subject?\"\n\n\"That you are no longer twenty years of age. Believe me, I speak\naccording to my own knowledge and experience. A prison is certain death\nfor men who are at our time of life. No, no; I will never allow you to\nlanguish in prison in such a way. Why, the very thought of it makes my\nhead turn giddy.\"\n\n\"Dear D'Artagnan,\" Athos replied, \"Heaven most fortunately made my body\nas strong, powerful, and enduring as my mind; and, rely upon it, I shall\nretain my strength up to the very last moment.\"\n\n\"But this is not strength of mind or character; it is sheer madness.\"\n\n\"No, D'Artagnan, it is the highest order of reasoning. Do not suppose\nthat I should in the slightest degree in the world discuss the question\nwith you, whether you would not be ruined in endeavoring to save me. I\nshould have done precisely as you propose if flight had been part of\nmy plan of action; I should, therefore, have accepted from you what,\nwithout any doubt, you would have accepted from me. No! I know you too\nwell even to breathe a word upon the subject.\"\n\n\"Ah! if you would only let me do it,\" said D'Artagnan, \"what a dance we\nwould give his most gracious majesty!\"\n\n\"Still he is the king; do not forget that, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is all the same to me; and king though he be, I would plainly\ntell him, 'Sire, imprison, exile, kill every one in France and Europe;\norder me to arrest and poniard even whom you like--even were it\nMonsieur, your own brother; but do not touch one of the four musketeers,\nor if so, _mordioux!_'\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" replied Athos, with perfect calmness, \"I should like\nto persuade you of one thing; namely, that I wish to be arrested; that I\ndesire above all things that my arrest should take place.\"\n\nD'Artagnan made a slight movement of his shoulders.\n\n\"Nay, I wish it, I repeat, more than anything; if you were to let me\nescape, it would be only to return of my own accord, and constitute\nmyself a prisoner. I wish to prove to this young man, who is dazzled\nby the power and splendor of his crown, that he can be regarded as the\nfirst and chiefest among men only on the one condition of his proving\nhimself to be the most generous and the wisest. He may punish me,\nimprison, torture me, it matters not. He abuses his opportunities, and\nI wish him to learn the bitterness of remorse, while Heaven teaches him\nwhat chastisement is.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I know only too well that, when you\nhave once said, 'no,' you mean 'no.' I do not insist any longer; you\nwish to go to the Bastile?\"\n\n\"I do wish to go there.\"\n\n\"Let us go, then! To the Bastile!\" cried D'Artagnan to the coachman.\nAnd throwing himself back in the carriage, he gnawed the ends of his\nmustache with a fury which, for Athos, who knew him well, signified a\nresolution either already taken or in course of formation. A profound\nsilence ensued in the carriage, which continued to roll on, but neither\nfaster nor slower than before. Athos took the musketeer by the hand.\n\n\"You are not angry with me, D'Artagnan?\" he said.\n\n\"I!--oh, no! certainly not; of course not. What you do for heroism, I\nshould have done from obstinacy.\"\n\n\"But you are quite of opinion, are you not, that Heaven will avenge me,\nD'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"And I know one or two on earth who will not fail to lend a helping\nhand,\" said the captain.\n\n\n\nChapter LXIII. Three Guests Astonished to Find Themselves at Supper\nTogether.\n\nThe carriage arrived at the outside of the gate of the Bastile. A\nsoldier on guard stopped it, but D'Artagnan had only to utter a single\nword to procure admittance, and the carriage passed on without further\ndifficulty. Whilst they were proceeding along the covered way which led\nto the courtyard of the governor's residence, D'Artagnan, whose lynx\neyes saw everything, even through the walls, suddenly cried out, \"What\nis that out yonder?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Athos, quietly; \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Look yonder, Athos.\"\n\n\"In the courtyard?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; make haste!\"\n\n\"Well, a carriage; very likely conveying a prisoner like myself.\"\n\n\"That would be too droll.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Make haste and look again, and look at the man who is just getting out\nof that carriage.\"\n\nAt that very moment a second sentinel stopped D'Artagnan, and while the\nformalities were being gone through, Athos could see at a hundred paces\nfrom him the man whom his friend had pointed out to him. He was, in\nfact, getting out of the carriage at the door of the governor's house.\n\"Well,\" inquired D'Artagnan, \"do you see him?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is a man in a gray suit.\"\n\n\"What do you say of him?\"\n\n\"I cannot very well tell; he is, as I have just now told you, a man in a\ngray suit, who is getting out of a carriage; that is all.\"\n\n\"Athos, I will wager anything that it is he.\"\n\n\"He, who?\"\n\n\"Aramis.\"\n\n\"Aramis arrested? Impossible!\"\n\n\"I do not say he is arrested, since we see him alone in his carriage.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what is he doing here?\"\n\n\"Oh! he knows Baisemeaux, the governor,\" replied the musketeer, slyly;\n\"so we have arrived just in time.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"In order to see what we can see.\"\n\n\"I regret this meeting exceedingly. When Aramis sees me, he will be very\nmuch annoyed, in the first place, at seeing me, and in the next at being\nseen.\"\n\n\"Very well reasoned.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is no remedy for it; whenever any one meets\nanother in the Bastile, even if he wished to draw back to avoid him, it\nwould be impossible.\"\n\n\"Athos, I have an idea; the question is, to spare Aramis the annoyance\nyou were speaking of, is it not?\"\n\n\"What is to be done?\"\n\n\"I will tell you; or in order to explain myself in the best possible\nway, let me relate the affair in my own manner; I will not recommend you\nto tell a falsehood, for that would be impossible for you to do; but I\nwill tell falsehoods enough for both; it is easy to do that when one is\nborn to the nature and habits of a Gascon.\"\n\nAthos smiled. The carriage stopped where the one we have just now\npointed out had stopped; namely, at the door of the governor's house.\n\"It is understood, then?\" said D'Artagnan, in a low voice to his friend.\nAthos consented by a gesture. They ascended the staircase. There will\nbe no occasion for surprise at the facility with which they had entered\ninto the Bastile, if it be remembered that, before passing the first\ngate, in fact, the most difficult of all, D'Artagnan had announced that\nhe had brought a prisoner of state. At the third gate, on the contrary,\nthat is to say, when he had once fairly entered the prison, he merely\nsaid to the sentinel, \"To M. Baisemeaux;\" and they both passed on. In a\nfew minutes they were in the governor's dining-room, and the first face\nwhich attracted D'Artagnan's observation was that of Aramis, who was\nseated side by side with Baisemeaux, awaiting the announcement of a\nmeal whose odor impregnated the whole apartment. If D'Artagnan pretended\nsurprise, Aramis did not pretend at all; he started when he saw his\ntwo friends, and his emotion was very apparent. Athos and D'Artagnan,\nhowever, complimented him as usual, and Baisemeaux, amazed, completely\nstupefied by the presence of his three guests, began to perform a few\nevolutions around them.\n\n\"By what lucky accident--\"\n\n\"We were just going to ask you,\" retorted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Are we going to give ourselves up as prisoners?\" cried Aramis, with an\naffection of hilarity.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan; \"it is true the walls smell deucedly like a\nprison. Monsieur de Baisemeaux, you know you invited me to sup with you\nthe other day.\"\n\n\"I?\" cried Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Yes, of course you did, although you now seem so struck with amazement.\nDon't you remember it?\"\n\nBaisemeaux turned pale and then red, looked at Aramis, who looked at\nhim, and finished by stammering out, \"Certainly--I am delighted--but,\nupon my honor--I have not the slightest--Ah! I have such a wretched\nmemory.\"\n\n\"Well! I am wrong, I see,\" said D'Artagnan, as if he were offended.\n\n\"Wrong, what for?\"\n\n\"Wrong to remember anything about it, it seems.\"\n\nBaisemeaux hurried towards him. \"Do not stand on ceremony, my dear\ncaptain,\" he said; \"I have the worst memory in the world. I no sooner\nleave off thinking of my pigeons and their pigeon-house, than I am no\nbetter than the rawest recruit.\"\n\n\"At all events, you remember it now,\" said D'Artagnan, boldly.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied the governor, hesitating; \"I think I do remember.\"\n\n\"It was when you came to the palace to see me; you told me some story or\nother about your accounts with M. de Louviere and M. de Tremblay.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! perfectly.\"\n\n\"And about M. d'Herblay's kindness towards you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Aramis, looking at the unhappy governor full in\nthe face, \"and yet you just now said you had no memory, Monsieur de\nBaisemeaux.\"\n\nBaisemeaux interrupted the musketeer in the middle of his revelations.\n\"Yes, yes; you're quite right; how could I have forgotten; I remember it\nnow as well as possible; I beg you a thousand pardons. But now, once for\nall, my dear M. d'Artagnan, be sure that at this present time, as at any\nother, whether invited or not, you are perfectly at home here, you and\nM. d'Herblay, your friend,\" he said, turning towards Aramis; \"and this\ngentleman, too,\" he added, bowing to Athos.\n\n\"Well, I thought it would be sure to turn out so,\" replied D'Artagnan,\n\"and that is the reason I came. Having nothing to do this evening at the\nPalais Royal, I wished to judge for myself what your ordinary style of\nliving was like; and as I was coming along, I met the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\nAthos bowed. \"The comte, who had just left his majesty, handed me an\norder which required immediate attention. We were close by here; I\nwished to call in, even if it were for no other object than that of\nshaking hands with you and of presenting the comte to you, of whom you\nspoke so highly that evening at the palace when--\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly--M. le Comte de la Fere?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"The comte is welcome, I am sure.\"\n\n\"And he will sup with you two, I suppose, whilst I, unfortunate dog that\nI am, must run off on a matter of duty. Oh! what happy beings you are,\ncompared to myself,\" he added, sighing as loud as Porthos might have\ndone.\n\n\"And so you are going away, then?\" said Aramis and Baisemeaux together,\nwith the same expression of delighted surprise, the tone of which was\nimmediately noticed by D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I leave you in my place,\" he said, \"a noble and excellent guest.\" And\nhe touched Athos gently on the shoulder, who, astonished also, could not\nhelp exhibiting his surprise a little; which was noticed by Aramis only,\nfor M. de Baisemeaux was not quite equal to the three friends in point\nof intelligence.\n\n\"What, are you going to leave us?\" resumed the governor.\n\n\"I shall only be about an hour, or an hour and a half. I will return in\ntime for dessert.\"\n\n\"Oh! we will wait for you,\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"No, no; that would be really disobliging me.\"\n\n\"You will be sure to return, though?\" said Athos, with an expression of\ndoubt.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" he said, pressing his friend's hand confidently; and\nhe added, in a low voice, \"Wait for me, Athos; be cheerful and lively\nas possible, and above all, don't allude even to business affairs, for\nHeaven's sake.\"\n\nAnd with a renewed pressure of the hand, he seemed to warn the comte of\nthe necessity of keeping perfectly discreet and impenetrable. Baisemeaux\nled D'Artagnan to the gate. Aramis, with many friendly protestations\nof delight, sat down by Athos, determined to make him speak; but Athos\npossessed every virtue and quality to the very highest degree. If\nnecessity had required it, he would have been the finest orator in the\nworld, but on other occasions he would rather have died than have opened\nhis lips.\n\nTen minutes after D'Artagnan's departure, the three gentlemen sat\ndown to table, which was covered with the most substantial display\nof gastronomic luxury. Large joints, exquisite dishes, preserves, the\ngreatest variety of wines, appeared successively upon the table, which\nwas served at the king's expense, and of which expense M. Colbert would\nhave found no difficulty in saving two thirds, without any one in the\nBastile being the worse for it. Baisemeaux was the only one who ate and\ndrank with gastronomic resolution. Aramis allowed nothing to pass by\nhim, but merely touched everything he took; Athos, after the soup and\nthree _hors d'oeuvres_, ate nothing more. The style of conversation was\nsuch as might have been anticipated between three men so opposite\nin temper and ideas. Aramis was incessantly asking himself by what\nextraordinary chance Athos was there at Baisemeaux's when D'Artagnan was\nno longer there, and why D'Artagnan did not remain when Athos was there.\nAthos sounded all the depths of the mind of Aramis, who lived in the\nmidst of subterfuge, evasion, and intrigue; he studied his man well and\nthoroughly, and felt convinced that he was engaged upon some important\nproject. And then he too began to think of his own personal affair, and\nto lose himself in conjectures as to D'Artagnan's reason for having left\nthe Bastile so abruptly, and for leaving behind him a prisoner so badly\nintroduced and so badly looked after by the prison authorities. But\nwe shall not pause to examine into the thoughts and feelings of these\npersonages, but will leave them to themselves, surrounded by the remains\nof poultry, game, and fish, which Baisemeaux's generous knife and\nfork had so mutilated. We are going to follow D'Artagnan instead, who,\ngetting into the carriage which had brought him, said to the coachman,\n\"Return to the palace, as fast as the horses can gallop.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXIV. What Took Place at the Louvre During the Supper at the\nBastile.\n\nM. de Saint-Aignan had executed the commission with which the king had\nintrusted him for La Valliere--as we have already seen in one of the\npreceding chapters; but, whatever his eloquence, he did not succeed in\npersuading the young girl that she had in the king a protector powerful\nenough for her under any combination of circumstances, and that she had\nno need of any one else in the world when the king was on her side. In\npoint of fact, at the very first word which the favorite mentioned\nof the discovery of the famous secret, Louise, in a passion of tears,\nabandoned herself in utter despair to a sorrow which would have been far\nfrom flattering for the king, if he had been a witness of it from one of\nthe corners of the room. Saint-Aignan, in his character of ambassador,\nfelt almost as greatly offended at it as his master himself would have\nbeen, and returned to inform the king what he had seen and heard; and it\nis thus we find him, in a state of great agitation, in the presence of\nthe king, who was, if possible, in a state of even greater flurry than\nhimself.\n\n\"But,\" said the king to the courtier, when the latter had finished his\nreport, \"what did she decide to do? Shall I at least see her presently\nbefore supper? Will she come to me, or shall I be obliged to go to her\nroom?\"\n\n\"I believe, sire, that if your majesty wishes to see her, you will not\nonly have to take the first step in advance, but will have to go the\nwhole way.\"\n\n\"That I do not mind. Do you think she has yet a secret fancy for young\nBragelonne?\" muttered the king between his teeth.\n\n\"Oh! sire, that is not possible; for it is you alone, I am convinced,\nMademoiselle de la Valliere loves, and that, too, with all her heart.\nBut you know that De Bragelonne belongs to that proud race who play the\npart of Roman heroes.\"\n\nThe king smiled feebly; he knew how true the illustration was, for Athos\nhad just left him.\n\n\"As for Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" Saint-Aignan continued, \"she was\nbrought up under the care of the Dowager Madame, that is to say, in\nthe greatest austerity and formality. This young engaged couple coldly\nexchanged their little vows in the prim presence of the moon and stars;\nand now, when they find they have to break those vows asunder, it plays\nthe very deuce with them.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan thought to have made the king laugh; but on the contrary,\nfrom a mere smile Louis passed to the greatest seriousness of manner.\nHe already began to experience that remorse which the comte had promised\nD'Artagnan he would inflict upon him. He reflected that, in fact, these\nyoung persons had loved and sworn fidelity to each other; that one of\nthe two had kept his word, and that the other was too conscientious\nnot to feel her perjury most bitterly. And his remorse was not\nunaccompanied; for bitter pangs of jealousy began to beset the king's\nheart. He did not say another word, and instead of going to pay a visit\nto his mother, or the queen, or Madame, in order to amuse himself a\nlittle, and make the ladies laugh, as he himself used to say, he threw\nhimself into the huge armchair in which his august father Louis XIII.\nhad passed so many weary days and years in company with Barradat and\nCinq-Mars. Saint-Aignan perceived the king was not to be amused at that\nmoment; he tried a last resource, and pronounced Louise's name, which\nmade the king look up immediately. \"What does your majesty intend to\ndo this evening--shall Mademoiselle de la Valliere be informed of your\nintention to see her?\"\n\n\"It seems she is already aware of that,\" replied the king. \"No, no,\nSaint-Aignan,\" he continued, after a moment's pause, \"we will both of us\npass our time in thinking, and musing, and dreaming; when Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere shall have sufficiently regretted what she now regrets,\nshe will deign, perhaps, to give us some news of herself.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire, is it possible you can so misunderstand her heart, which is\nso full of devotion?\"\n\nThe king rose, flushed from vexation and annoyance; he was a prey to\njealousy as well as to remorse. Saint-Aignan was just beginning to feel\nthat his position was becoming awkward, when the curtain before the door\nwas raised. The king turned hastily round; his first idea was that a\nletter from Louise had arrived; but, instead of a letter of love, he\nonly saw his captain of musketeers, standing upright, and perfectly\nsilent in the doorway. \"M. d'Artagnan,\" he said, \"ah! Well, monsieur?\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Saint-Aignan; the king's eyes took the same\ndirection as those of his captain; these looks would have been clear to\nany one, and for a still greater reason they were so for Saint-Aignan.\nThe courtier bowed and quitted the room, leaving the king and D'Artagnan\nalone.\n\n\"Is it done?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied the captain of the musketeers, in a grave voice,\n\"it is done.\"\n\nThe king was unable to say another word. Pride, however, obliged him\nnot to pause at what he had done; whenever a sovereign has adopted a\ndecisive course, even though it be unjust, he is compelled to prove\nto all witnesses, and particularly to prove it to himself, that he was\nquite right all through. A good means for effecting that--an almost\ninfallible means, indeed--is, to try and prove his victim to be in the\nwrong. Louis, brought up by Mazarin and Anne of Austria, knew better\nthan any one else his vocation as a monarch; he therefore endeavored to\nprove it on the present occasion. After a few moment's pause, which he\nhad employed in making silently to himself the same reflections which\nwe have just expressed aloud, he said, in an indifferent tone: \"What did\nthe comte say?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, sire.\"\n\n\"Surely he did not allow himself to be arrested without saying\nsomething?\"\n\n\"He said he expected to be arrested, sire.\"\n\nThe king raised his head haughtily. \"I presume,\" he said, \"that M. le\nComte de la Fere has not continued to play his obstinate and rebellious\npart.\"\n\n\"In the first place, sire, what do you wish to signify by _rebellious?_\"\nquietly asked the musketeer. \"A rebel, in the eyes of the king, is a\nman who not only allows himself to be shut up in the Bastile, but still\nmore, who opposes those who do not wish to take him there.\"\n\n\"Who do not wish to take him there!\" exclaimed the king. \"What do you\nsay, captain! Are you mad?\"\n\n\"I believe not, sire.\"\n\n\"You speak of persons who did not wish to arrest M. de la Fere! Who are\nthose persons, may I ask?\"\n\n\"I should say those whom your majesty intrusted with that duty.\"\n\n\"But it was you whom I intrusted with it,\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire; it was I.\"\n\n\"And yet you say that, despite my orders, you had the intention of not\narresting the man who had insulted me!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire--that was really my intention. I even proposed to the comte\nto mount a horse that I had prepared for him at the Barriere de la\nConference.\"\n\n\"And what was your object in getting this horse ready?\"\n\n\"Why, sire, in order that M. le Comte de la Fere might be able to reach\nLe Havre, and from that place make his escape to England.\"\n\n\"You betrayed me, then, monsieur?\" cried the king, kindling with a wild\npride.\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\nThere was nothing to say in answer to statements made in such a tone;\nthe king was astounded at such an obstinate and open resistance on the\npart of D'Artagnan. \"At least you had a reason, Monsieur d'Artagnan, for\nacting as you did?\" said the king, proudly.\n\n\"I have always a reason for everything, sire.\"\n\n\"Your reason cannot be your friendship for the comte, at all\nevents,--the only one that can be of any avail, the only one that could\npossibly excuse you,--for I placed you perfectly at your ease in that\nrespect.\"\n\n\"Me, sire?\"\n\n\"Did I not give you the choice to arrest, or not to arrest M. le Comte\nde la Fere?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" exclaimed the king, impatiently.\n\n\"But you warned me, sire, that if I did not arrest him, your captain of\nthe guard should do so.\"\n\n\"Was I not considerate enough towards you, from the very moment I did\nnot compel you to obey me?\"\n\n\"To me, sire, you were, but not to my friend, for my friend would\nbe arrested all the same, whether by myself or by the captain of the\nguards.\"\n\n\"And this is your devotion, monsieur! a devotion which argues and\nreasons. You are no soldier, monsieur!\"\n\n\"I wait for your majesty to tell me what I am.\"\n\n\"Well, then--you are a Frondeur.\"\n\n\"And since there is no longer any Fronde, sire, in that case--\"\n\n\"But if what you say is true--\"\n\n\"What I say is always true, sire.\"\n\n\"What have you come to say to me, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I have come to say to your majesty, 'Sire, M. de la Fere is in the\nBastile.'\"\n\n\"That is not your fault, it would seem.\"\n\n\"That is true, sire; but at all events he is there; and since he is\nthere, it is important that your majesty should know it.\"\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur d'Artagnan, so you set your king at defiance.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan! I warn you that you are abusing my patience.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sire.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'on the contrary'?\"\n\n\"I have come to get myself arrested, too.\"\n\n\"To get yourself arrested,--you!\"\n\n\"Of course. My friend will get wearied to death in the Bastile by\nhimself; and I have come to propose to your majesty to permit me to bear\nhim company; if your majesty will but give me the word, I will arrest\nmyself; I shall not need the captain of the guards for that, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nThe king darted towards the table and seized hold of a pen to write the\norder for D'Artagnan's imprisonment. \"Pay attention, monsieur, that this\nis forever,\" cried the king, in tones of sternest menace.\n\n\"I can quite believe that,\" returned the musketeer; \"for when you have\nonce done such an act as that, you will never be able to look me in the\nface again.\"\n\nThe king dashed down his pen violently. \"Leave the room, monsieur!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Not so, if it please your majesty.\"\n\n\"What is that you say?\"\n\n\"Sire, I came to speak gently and temperately to your majesty; your\nmajesty got into a passion with me; that is a misfortune; but I shall\nnot the less on that account say what I had to say to you.\"\n\n\"Your resignation, monsieur,--your resignation!\" cried the king.\n\n\"Sire, you know whether I care about my resignation or not, since at\nBlois, on the very day when you refused King Charles the million which\nmy friend the Comte de la Fere gave him, I then tendered my resignation\nto your majesty.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur--do it at once!\"\n\n\"No, sire; for there is no question of my resignation at the present\nmoment. Your majesty took up your pen just now to send me to the\nBastile,--why should you change your intention?\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan! Gascon that you are! who is king, allow me to ask,--you or\nmyself?\"\n\n\"You, sire, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'unfortunately'?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; for if it were I--\"\n\n\"If it were you, you would approve of M. d'Artagnan's rebellious\nconduct, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said the king, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"And I should tell my captain of the musketeers,\" continued D'Artagnan,\n\"I should tell him, looking at him all the while with human eyes, and\nnot with eyes like coals of fire, 'M. d'Artagnan, I had forgotten that\nI was the king, for I descended from my throne in order to insult a\ngentleman.'\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, \"do you think you can excuse your friend by\nexceeding him in insolence?\"\n\n\"Oh! sire! I should go much further than he did,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and\nit would be your own fault. I should tell you what he, a man full of\nthe finest sense of delicacy, did not tell you; I should say--'Sire,\nyou have sacrificed his son, and he defended his son--you sacrificed\nhimself; he addressed you in the name of honor, of religion, of\nvirtue--you repulsed, drove him away, imprisoned him.' I should be\nharder than he was, for I should say to you--'Sire; it is for you\nto choose. Do you wish to have friends or lackeys--soldiers or\nslaves--great men or mere puppets? Do you wish men to serve you, or to\nbend and crouch before you? Do you wish men to love you, or to be afraid\nof you? If you prefer baseness, intrigue, cowardice, say so at once,\nsire, and we will leave you,--we who are the only individuals who are\nleft,--nay, I will say more, the only models of the valor of former\ntimes; we who have done our duty, and have exceeded, perhaps, in courage\nand in merit, the men already great for posterity. Choose, sire! and\nthat, too, without delay. Whatever relics remain to you of the great\nnobility, guard them with a jealous eye; you will never be deficient in\ncourtiers. Delay not--and send me to the Bastile with my friend; for, if\nyou did not know how to listen to the Comte de la Fere, whose voice is\nthe sweetest and noblest in all the world when honor is the theme; if\nyou do not know how to listen to D'Artagnan, the frankest and honestest\nvoice of sincerity, you are a bad king, and to-morrow will be a poor\nking. And learn from me, sire, that bad kings are hated by their people,\nand poor kings are driven ignominiously away.' That is what I had to say\nto you, sire; you were wrong to drive me to say it.\"\n\nThe king threw himself back in his chair, cold as death, and as livid as\na corpse. Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, he could not have been\nmore astonished; he seemed as if his respiration had utterly ceased,\nand that he was at the point of death. The honest voice of sincerity,\nas D'Artagnan had called it, had pierced through his heart like a\nsword-blade.\n\nD'Artagnan had said all he had to say. Comprehending the king's anger,\nhe drew his sword, and, approaching Louis XIV. respectfully, he placed\nit on the table. But the king, with a furious gesture, thrust aside\nthe sword, which fell on the ground and rolled to D'Artagnan's feet.\nNotwithstanding the perfect mastery which D'Artagnan exercised over\nhimself, he, too, in his turn, became pale, and, trembling with\nindignation, said: \"A king may disgrace a soldier,--he may exile him,\nand may even condemn him to death; but were he a hundred times a king,\nhe has no right to insult him by casting a dishonor upon his sword!\nSire, a king of France has never repulsed with contempt the sword of\na man such as I am! Stained with disgrace as this sword now is, it has\nhenceforth no other sheath than either your heart or my own! I choose\nmy own, sire; and you have to thank Heaven and my own patience that I\ndo so.\" Then snatching up his sword, he cried, \"My blood be upon your\nhead!\" and, with a rapid gesture, he placed the hilt upon the floor and\ndirected the point of the blade towards his breast. The king, however,\nwith a movement far more rapid than that of D'Artagnan, threw his right\narm around the musketeer's neck, and with his left hand seized hold\nof the blade by the middle, and returned it silently to the scabbard.\nD'Artagnan, upright, pale, and still trembling, let the king do all to\nthe very end. Louis, overcome and softened by gentler feelings, returned\nto the table, took a pen in his hand, wrote a few lines, signed them,\nand then held it out to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"What is this paper, sire?\" inquired the captain.\n\n\"An order for M. d'Artagnan to set the Comte de la Fere at liberty\nimmediately.\"\n\nD'Artagnan seized the king's hand, and imprinted a kiss upon it; he then\nfolded the order, placed it in his belt, and quitted the room. Neither\nthe king nor the captain had uttered a syllable.\n\n\"Oh, human heart! thou guide and director of kings,\" murmured Louis,\nwhen alone, \"when shall I learn to read in your inmost recesses, as in\nthe leaves of a book! Oh, I am not a bad king--nor am I a poor king; I am\nbut still a child, when all is said and done.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXV. Political Rivals.\n\nD'Artagnan had promised M. de Baisemeaux to return in time for dessert,\nand he kept his word. They had just reached the finer and more delicate\nclass of wines and liqueurs with which the governor's cellar had the\nreputation of being most admirably stocked, when the silver spurs of\nthe captain resounded in the corridor, and he himself appeared at the\nthreshold. Athos and Aramis had played a close game; neither of the two\nhad been able to gain the slightest advantage over the other. They had\nsupped, talked a good deal about the Bastile, of the last journey to\nFontainebleau, of the intended _fete_ that M. Fouquet was about to give\nat Vaux; they had generalized on every possible subject; and no one,\nexcepting Baisemeaux, had in the slightest degree alluded to private\nmatters. D'Artagnan arrived in the very midst of the conversation,\nstill pale and much disturbed by his interview with the king. Baisemeaux\nhastened to give him a chair; D'Artagnan accepted a glass of wine, and\nset it down empty. Athos and Aramis both remarked his emotion; as\nfor Baisemeaux, he saw nothing more than the captain of the king's\nmusketeers, to whom he endeavored to show every possible attention. But,\nalthough Aramis had remarked his emotion, he had not been able to guess\nthe cause of it. Athos alone believed he had detected it. For him,\nD'Artagnan's return, and particularly the manner in which he, usually\nso impassible, seemed overcome, signified, \"I have just asked the king\nsomething which the king has refused me.\" Thoroughly convinced that his\nconjecture was correct, Athos smiled, rose from the table, and made a\nsign to D'Artagnan, as if to remind him that they had something else\nto do than to sup together. D'Artagnan immediately understood him,\nand replied by another sign. Aramis and Baisemeaux watched this silent\ndialogue, and looked inquiringly at each other. Athos felt that he was\ncalled upon to give an explanation of what was passing.\n\n\"The truth is, my friend,\" said the Comte de la Fere, with a smile,\n\"that you, Aramis, have been supping with a state criminal, and you,\nMonsieur de Baisemeaux, with your prisoner.\"\n\nBaisemeaux uttered an exclamation of surprise, and almost of delight;\nfor he was exceedingly proud and vain of his fortress, and for his own\nindividual profit, the more prisoners he had, the happier he was, and\nthe higher in rank the prisoners happened to be, the prouder he felt.\nAramis assumed the expression of countenance he thought the position\njustified, and said, \"Well, dear Athos, forgive me, but I almost\nsuspected what has happened. Some prank of Raoul and La Valliere, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"And,\" continued Aramis, \"you, a high and powerful nobleman as you\nare, forgetful that courtiers now exist--you have been to the king, I\nsuppose, and told him what you thought of his conduct?\"\n\n\"Yes, you have guessed right.\"\n\n\"So that,\" said Baisemeaux, trembling at having supped so familiarly\nwith a man who had fallen into disgrace with the king; \"so that,\nmonsieur le comte--\"\n\n\"So that, my dear governor,\" said Athos, \"my friend D'Artagnan will\ncommunicate to you the contents of the paper which I perceived just\npeeping out of his belt, and which assuredly can be nothing else than\nthe order for my incarceration.\"\n\nBaisemeaux held out his hand with his accustomed eagerness. D'Artagnan\ndrew two papers from his belt, and presented one of them to the\ngovernor, who unfolded it, and then read, in a low tone of voice,\nlooking at Athos over the paper, as he did so, and pausing from time to\ntime: \"'Order to detain, in my chateau of the Bastile, Monsieur le Comte\nde la Fere.' Oh, monsieur! this is indeed a very melancholy day for me.\"\n\n\"You will have a patient prisoner, monsieur,\" said Athos, in his calm,\nsoft voice.\n\n\"A prisoner, too, who will not remain a month with you, my dear\ngovernor,\" said Aramis; while Baisemeaux, still holding the order in his\nhand, transcribed it upon the prison registry.\n\n\"Not a day, or rather not even a night,\" said D'Artagnan, displaying the\nsecond order of the king, \"for now, dear M. de Baisemeaux, you will\nhave the goodness to transcribe also this order for setting the comte\nimmediately at liberty.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Aramis, \"it is a labor that you have deprived me of,\nD'Artagnan;\" and he pressed the musketeer's hand in a significant\nmanner, at the same moment as that of Athos.\n\n\"What!\" said the latter in astonishment, \"the king sets me at liberty!\"\n\n\"Read, my dear friend,\" returned D'Artagnan.\n\nAthos took the order and read it. \"It is quite true,\" he said.\n\n\"Are you sorry for it?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh, no, on the contrary. I wish the king no harm; and the greatest evil\nor misfortune that any one can wish kings, is that they should commit an\nact of injustice. But you have had a difficult and painful task, I know.\nTell me, have you not, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I? not at all,\" said the musketeer, laughing: \"the king does everything\nI wish him to do.\"\n\nAramis looked fixedly at D'Artagnan, and saw that he was not speaking\nthe truth. But Baisemeaux had eyes for nothing but D'Artagnan, so great\nwas his admiration for a man who seemed to make the king do all he\nwished.\n\n\"And does the king exile Athos?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"No, not precisely; the king did not explain himself upon that subject,\"\nreplied D'Artagnan; \"but I think the comte could not well do better\nunless, indeed, he wishes particularly to thank the king--\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Athos, smiling.\n\n\"Well, then, I think,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"that the comte cannot do\nbetter than to retire to his _own_ chateau. However, my dear Athos, you\nhave only to speak, to tell me what you want. If any particular place\nof residence is more agreeable to you than another, I am influential\nenough, perhaps, to obtain it for you.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said Athos; \"nothing can be more agreeable to me, my\ndear friend, than to return to my solitude beneath my noble trees on the\nbanks of the Loire. If Heaven be the overruling physician of the evils\nof the mind, nature is a sovereign remedy. And so, monsieur,\" continued\nAthos, turning again towards Baisemeaux, \"I am now free, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur le comte, I think so--at least, I hope so,\" said the\ngovernor, turning over and over the two papers in question, \"unless,\nhowever, M. d'Artagnan has a third order to give me.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Baisemeaux, no,\" said the musketeer; \"the second is quite\nenough: we will stop there--if you please.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur le comte,\" said Baisemeaux addressing Athos, \"you do\nnot know what you are losing. I should have placed you among the\nthirty-franc prisoners, like the generals--what am I saying?--I mean\namong the fifty-francs, like the princes, and you would have supped\nevery evening as you have done to-night.\"\n\n\"Allow me, monsieur,\" said Athos, \"to prefer my own simpler fare.\" And\nthen, turning to D'Artagnan, he said, \"Let us go, my dear friend. Shall\nI have that greatest of all pleasures for me--that of having you as my\ncompanion?\"\n\n\"To the city gate only,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"after which I will tell\nyou what I told the king: 'I am on duty.'\"\n\n\"And you, my dear Aramis,\" said Athos, smiling; \"will you accompany me?\nLa Fere is on the road to Vannes.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear friend,\" said Aramis, \"but I have an appointment in\nParis this evening, and I cannot leave without very serious interests\nsuffering by my absence.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Athos, \"I must say adieu, and take my leave of you.\nMy dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, I have to thank you exceedingly for\nyour kind and friendly disposition towards me, and particularly for\nthe enjoyable specimen you have given me of the ordinary fare of the\nBastile.\" And, having embraced Aramis, and shaken hands with M. de\nBaisemeaux, and having received best wishes for a pleasant journey from\nthem both, Athos set off with D'Artagnan.\n\nWhilst the _denouement_ of the scene of the Palais Royal was taking\nplace at the Bastile, let us relate what was going on at the lodgings\nof Athos and Bragelonne. Grimaud, as we have seen, had accompanied his\nmaster to Paris; and, as we have said, he was present when Athos went\nout; he had observed D'Artagnan gnaw the corners of his mustache; he\nhad seen his master get into the carriage; he had narrowly examined both\ntheir countenances, and he had known them both for a sufficiently long\nperiod to read and understand, through the mask of their impassibility,\nthat something serious was the matter. As soon as Athos had gone, he\nbegan to reflect; he then, and then only, remembered the strange manner\nin which Athos had taken leave of him, the embarrassment--imperceptible\nas it would have been to any but himself--of the master whose ideas\nwere, to him, so clear and defined, and the expression of whose wishes\nwas so precise. He knew that Athos had taken nothing with him but the\nclothes he had on him at the time; and yet he seemed to fancy that Athos\nhad not left for an hour merely; or even for a day. A long absence was\nsignified by the manner in which he pronounced the word \"Adieu.\"\nAll these circumstances recurred to his mind, with feelings of deep\naffection for Athos, with that horror of isolation and solitude which\ninvariably besets the minds of those who love; and all these combined\nrendered poor Grimaud very melancholy, and particularly uneasy. Without\nbeing able to account to himself for what he did since his master's\ndeparture, he wandered about the room, seeking, as it were, for some\ntraces of him, like a faithful dog, who is not exactly uneasy about his\nabsent master, but at least is restless. Only as, in addition to the\ninstinct of the animal, Grimaud subjoined the reasoning faculties of the\nman, Grimaud therefore felt uneasy and restless too. Not having found\nany indication which could serve as a guide, and having neither seen\nnor discovered anything which could satisfy his doubts, Grimaud began\nto wonder what could possibly have happened. Besides, imagination is\nthe resource, or rather the plague of gentle and affectionate hearts. In\nfact, never does a feeling heart represent its absent friend to itself\nas being happy or cheerful. Never does the dove that wings its flight in\nsearch of adventures inspire anything but terror at home.\n\nGrimaud soon passed from uneasiness to terror; he carefully went over,\nin his own mind, everything that had taken place: D'Artagnan's letter\nto Athos, the letter which had seemed to distress Athos so much after\nhe had read it; then Raoul's visit to Athos, which resulted in Athos\ndesiring him (Grimaud) to get his various orders and his court dress\nready to put on; then his interview with the king, at the end of which\nAthos had returned home so unusually gloomy; then the explanation\nbetween the father and the son, at the termination of which Athos had\nembraced Raoul with such sadness of expression, while Raoul himself went\naway equally weary and melancholy; and finally, D'Artagnan's arrival,\nbiting, as if he were vexed, the end of his mustache, and leaving again\nin the carriage, accompanied by the Comte de la Fere. All this composed\na drama in five acts very clearly, particularly for so analytical an\nobserver as Grimaud.\n\nThe first step he took was to search in his master's coat for M.\nd'Artagnan's letter; he found the letter still there, and its contents\nwere found to run as follows:\n\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--Raoul has been to ask me for some particulars about\nthe conduct of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, during our young friend's\nresidence in London. I am a poor captain of musketeers, and I am\nsickened to death every day by hearing all the scandal of the barracks\nand bedside conversations. If I had told Raoul all I believe, I know the\npoor fellow would have died of it; but I am in the king's service, and\ncannot relate all I hear about the king's affairs. If your heart tells\nyou to do it, set off at once; the matter concerns you more than it does\nmyself, and almost as much as Raoul.\"\n\nGrimaud tore, not a handful, but a finger-and-thumbful of hair out of\nhis head; he would have done more if his head of hair had been in a more\nflourishing condition.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that is the key of the whole enigma. The young girl has\nbeen playing her pranks; what people say about her and the king is true,\nthen; our young master has been deceived; he ought to know it. Monsieur\nle comte has been to see the king, and has told him a piece of his mind;\nand then the king sent M. d'Artagnan to arrange the affair. Ah! gracious\ngoodness!\" continued Grimaud, \"monsieur le comte, I now remember,\nreturned without his sword.\"\n\nThis discovery made the perspiration break out all over poor Grimaud's\nface. He did not waste any more time in useless conjecture, but clapped\nhis hat on his head, and ran to Raoul's lodgings.\n\nRaoul, after Louise had left him, had mastered his grief, if not his\naffection; and, compelled to look forward on that perilous road over\nwhich madness and revulsion were hurrying him, he had seen, from the\nvery first glance, his father exposed to the royal obstinacy, since\nAthos had himself been the first to oppose any resistance to the royal\nwill. At this moment, from a very natural sequence of feeling, the\nunhappy young man remembered the mysterious signs which Athos had made,\nand the unexpected visit of D'Artagnan; the result of the conflict\nbetween a sovereign and a subject revealed itself to his terrified\nvision. As D'Artagnan was on duty, that is, a fixture at his post\nwithout the possibility of leaving it, it was certainly not likely that\nhe had come to pay Athos a visit merely for the pleasure of seeing him.\nHe must have come to say something to him. This something in the\nmidst of such painful conjectures must have been the news of either a\nmisfortune or a danger. Raoul trembled at having been so selfish as\nto have forgotten his father for his affection; at having, in a word,\npassed his time in idle dreams, or in an indulgence of despair, at a\ntime when a necessity existed for repelling such an imminent attack on\nAthos. The very idea nearly drove him frantic; he buckled on his sword\nand ran towards his father's lodgings. On his way there he encountered\nGrimaud, who, having set off from the opposite pole, was running with\nequal eagerness in search of the truth. The two men embraced each other\nmost warmly.\n\n\"Grimaud,\" exclaimed Raoul, \"is the comte well?\"\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"No; where is he?\"\n\n\"I am trying to find out.\"\n\n\"And M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Went out with him.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes after you did.\"\n\n\"In what way did they go out?\"\n\n\"In a carriage.\"\n\n\"Where did they go?\"\n\n\"I have no idea at all.\"\n\n\"Did my father take any money with him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Or his sword?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I have an idea, Grimaud, that M. d'Artagnan came in order to--\"\n\n\"Arrest monsieur le comte, do you not think, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes, Grimaud.\"\n\n\"I could have sworn it.\"\n\n\"What road did they take?\"\n\n\"The way leading towards the quay.\"\n\n\"To the Bastile, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Quick, quick; let us run.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us not lose a moment.\"\n\n\"But where are we to go?\" said Raoul, overwhelmed.\n\n\"We will go to M. d'Artagnan's first, we may perhaps learn something\nthere.\"\n\n\"No; if they keep me in ignorance at my father's, they will do the same\neverywhere. Let us go to--Oh, good heavens! why, I must be mad to-day,\nGrimaud; I have forgotten M. du Vallon, who is waiting for and expecting\nme still.\"\n\n\"Where is he, then?\"\n\n\"At the Minimes of Vincennes.\"\n\n\"Thank goodness, that is on the same side as the Bastile. I will run and\nsaddle the horses, and we will go at once,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"Do, my friend, do.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXVI. In Which Porthos Is Convinced without Having Understood\nAnything.\n\nThe good and worthy Porthos, faithful to all the laws of ancient\nchivalry, had determined to wait for M. de Saint-Aignan until sunset;\nand as Saint-Aignan did not come, as Raoul had forgotten to communicate\nwith his second, and as he found that waiting so long was very\nwearisome, Porthos had desired one of the gate-keepers to fetch him a\nfew bottles of good wine and a good joint of meat,--so that, at least,\nhe might pass away the time by means of a glass or two and a mouthful of\nsomething to eat. He had just finished when Raoul arrived, escorted by\nGrimaud, both of them riding at full speed. As soon as Porthos saw the\ntwo cavaliers riding at such a pace along the road, he did not for a\nmoment doubt but that they were the men he was expecting, and he rose\nfrom the grass upon which he had been indolently reclining and began to\nstretch his legs and arms, saying, \"See what it is to have good habits.\nThe fellow has finished by coming, after all. If I had gone away he\nwould have found no one here and would have taken advantage of that.\" He\nthen threw himself into a martial attitude, and drew himself up to the\nfull height of his gigantic stature. But instead of Saint-Aignan, he\nonly saw Raoul, who, with the most despairing gestures, accosted him by\ncrying out, \"Pray forgive me, my dear friend, I am most wretched.\"\n\n\"Raoul!\" cried Porthos, surprised.\n\n\"You have been angry with me?\" said Raoul, embracing Porthos.\n\n\"I? What for?\"\n\n\"For having forgotten you. But I assure you my head seems utterly lost.\nIf you only knew!\"\n\n\"You have killed him?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Saint-Aignan; or, if that is not the case, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"The matter is, that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere has by this time been\narrested.\"\n\nPorthos gave a start that would have thrown down a wall.\n\n\"Arrested!\" he cried out; \"by whom?\"\n\n\"By D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"My dear friend, it is perfectly true.\"\n\nPorthos turned towards Grimaud, as if he needed a second confirmation of\nthe intelligence.\n\nGrimaud nodded his head. \"And where have they taken him?\"\n\n\"Probably to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"As we came along we questioned some persons, who saw the carriage pass;\nand others who saw it enter the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" muttered Porthos.\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"I? Nothing; only I will not have Athos remain at the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Raoul, advancing nearer to Porthos, \"that the arrest\nwas made by order of the king?\"\n\nPorthos looked at the young man, as if to say, \"What does that matter to\nme?\" This dumb language seemed so eloquent of meaning to Raoul that he\ndid not ask any other question. He mounted his horse again; and Porthos,\nassisted by Grimaud, had already done the same.\n\n\"Let us arrange our plan of action,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Porthos, \"that is the best thing we can do.\"\n\nRaoul sighed deeply, and then paused suddenly.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Porthos; \"are you faint?\"\n\n\"No, only I feel how utterly helpless our position is. Can we three\npretend to go and take the Bastile?\"\n\n\"Well, if D'Artagnan were only here,\" replied Porthos, \"I am not so very\ncertain we would fail.\"\n\nRaoul could not resist a feeling of admiration at the sight of such\nperfect confidence, heroic in its simplicity. These were truly the\ncelebrated men who, by three or four, attacked armies and assaulted\ncastles! Men who had terrified death itself, who had survived the wrecks\nof a tempestuous age, and still stood, stronger than the most robust of\nthe young.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he to Porthos, \"you have just given me an idea; we\nabsolutely must see M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"He ought by this time to have returned home, after having taken my\nfather to the Bastile. Let us go to his house.\"\n\n\"First inquire at the Bastile,\" said Grimaud, who was in the habit of\nspeaking little, but that to the purpose.\n\nAccordingly, they hastened towards the fortress, when one of those\nchances which Heaven bestows on men of strong will caused Grimaud\nsuddenly to perceive the carriage, which was entering by the great gate\nof the drawbridge. This was the moment that D'Artagnan was, as we have\nseen, returning from his visit to the king. In vain was it that Raoul\nurged on his horse in order to join the carriage, and to see whom it\ncontained. The horses had already gained the other side of the great\ngate, which again closed, while one of the sentries struck the nose of\nRaoul's horse with his musket; Raoul turned about, only too happy to\nfind he had ascertained something respecting the carriage which had\ncontained his father.\n\n\"We have him,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"If we wait a little it is certain he will leave; don't you think so, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Unless, indeed, D'Artagnan also be a prisoner,\" replied Porthos, \"in\nwhich case everything is lost.\"\n\nRaoul returned no answer, for any hypothesis was admissible.\nHe instructed Grimaud to lead the horses to the little street\nJean-Beausire, so as to give rise to less suspicion, and himself with\nhis piercing gaze watched for the exit either of D'Artagnan or the\ncarriage. Nor had he decided wrongly; for twenty minutes had not elapsed\nbefore the gate reopened and the carriage reappeared. A dazzling of\nthe eyes prevented Raoul from distinguishing what figures occupied the\ninterior. Grimaud averred that he had seen two persons, and that one of\nthem was his master. Porthos kept looking at Raoul and Grimaud by turns,\nin the hope of understanding their idea.\n\n\"It is clear,\" said Grimaud, \"that if the comte is in the carriage,\neither he is set at liberty or they are taking him to another prison.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see that by the road he takes,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"If he is set at liberty,\" said Grimaud, \"they will conduct him home.\"\n\n\"True,\" rejoined Porthos.\n\n\"The carriage does not take that way,\" cried Raoul; and indeed the\nhorses were just disappearing down the Faubourg St. Antoine.\n\n\"Let us hasten,\" said Porthos; \"we will attack the carriage on the road\nand tell Athos to flee.\"\n\n\"Rebellion,\" murmured Raoul.\n\nPorthos darted a second glance at Raoul, quite worthy of the first.\nRaoul replied only by spurring the flanks of his steed. In a few moments\nthe three cavaliers had overtaken the carriage, and followed it so\nclosely that their horses' breath moistened the back of it. D'Artagnan,\nwhose senses were ever on the alert, heard the trot of the horses, at\nthe moment when Raoul was telling Porthos to pass the chariot, so as to\nsee who was the person accompanying Athos. Porthos complied, but could\nnot see anything, for the blinds were lowered. Rage and impatience were\ngaining mastery over Raoul. He had just noticed the mystery preserved by\nAthos's companion, and determined on proceeding to extremities. On his\npart D'Artagnan had perfectly recognized Porthos, and Raoul also, from\nunder the blinds, and had communicated to the comte the result of his\nobservation. They were desirous only of seeing whether Raoul and Porthos\nwould push the affair to the uttermost. And this they speedily did, for\nRaoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on the leader, commanding\nthe coachmen to stop. Porthos seized the coachman, and dragged him from\nhis seat. Grimaud already had hold of the carriage door. Raoul threw\nopen his arms, exclaiming, \"M. le comte! M. le comte!\"\n\n\"Ah! is it you, Raoul?\" said Athos, intoxicated with joy.\n\n\"Not bad, indeed!\" added D'Artagnan, with a burst of laughter, and they\nboth embraced the young man and Porthos, who had taken possession of\nthem.\n\n\"My brave Porthos! best of friends,\" cried Athos, \"it is still the same\nold way with you.\"\n\n\"He is still only twenty,\" said D'Artagnan, \"brave Porthos!\"\n\n\"Confound it,\" answered Porthos, slightly confused, \"we thought that you\nwere being arrested.\"\n\n\"While,\" rejoined Athos, \"the matter in question was nothing but my\ntaking a drive in M. d'Artagnan's carriage.\"\n\n\"But we followed you from the Bastile,\" returned Raoul, with a tone of\nsuspicion and reproach.\n\n\"Where we had been to take supper with our friend M. Baisemeaux. Do you\nrecollect Baisemeaux, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Very well, indeed.\"\n\n\"And there we saw Aramis.\"\n\n\"In the Bastile?\"\n\n\"At supper.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, again breathing freely.\n\n\"He gave us a thousand messages to you.\"\n\n\"And where is M. le comte going?\" asked Grimaud, already recompensed by\na smile from his master.\n\n\"We were going home to Blois.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"At once?\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, right forward.\"\n\n\"Without any luggage?\"\n\n\"Oh! Raoul would have been instructed to forward me mine, or to bring it\nwith him on his return, _if_ he returns.\"\n\n\"If nothing detains him longer in Paris,\" said D'Artagnan, with a glance\nfirm and cutting as steel, and as painful (for it reopened the poor\nyoung fellow's wounds), \"he will do well to follow you, Athos.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to keep me any longer in Paris,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Then we will go immediately.\"\n\n\"And M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Oh! as for me, I was only accompanying Athos as far as the barrier, and\nI return with Porthos.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the latter.\n\n\"Come, my son,\" added the comte, gently passing his arm around Raoul's\nneck to draw him into the carriage, and again embracing him. \"Grimaud,\"\ncontinued the comte, \"you will return quietly to Paris with your horse\nand M. du Vallon's, for Raoul and I will mount here and give up the\ncarriage to these two gentlemen to return to Paris in; and then, as\nsoon as you arrive, you will take my clothes and letters and forward the\nwhole to me at home.\"\n\n\"But,\" observed Raoul, who was anxious to make the comte converse,\n\"when you return to Paris, there will not be a single thing there for\nyou--which will be very inconvenient.\"\n\n\"I think it will be a very long time, Raoul, ere I return to Paris. The\nlast sojourn we have made there has not been of a nature to encourage me\nto repeat it.\"\n\nRaoul hung down his head and said not a word more. Athos descended from\nthe carriage and mounted the horse which had brought Porthos, and\nwhich seemed no little pleased at the exchange. Then they embraced,\nand clasped each other's hands, and interchanged a thousand pledges of\neternal friendship. Porthos promised to spend a month with Athos at the\nfirst opportunity. D'Artagnan engaged to take advantage of his first\nleave of absence; and then, having embraced Raoul for the last time: \"To\nyou, my boy,\" said he, \"I will write.\" Coming from D'Artagnan, who he\nknew wrote very seldom, these words expressed everything. Raoul was\nmoved even to tears. He tore himself away from the musketeer and\ndeparted.\n\nD'Artagnan rejoined Porthos in the carriage: \"Well,\" said he, \"my dear\nfriend, what a day we have had!\"\n\n\"Indeed we have,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"You must be quite worn out.\"\n\n\"Not quite; however, I shall retire early to rest, so as to be ready for\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"And wherefore?\"\n\n\"Why! to complete what I have begun.\"\n\n\"You make me shudder, my friend, you seem to me quite angry. What the\ndevil _have_ you begun which is not finished?\"\n\n\"Listen; Raoul has not fought, but _I_ must fight!\"\n\n\"With whom? with the king?\"\n\n\"How!\" exclaimed Porthos, astounded, \"with the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, I say, you great baby, with the king.\"\n\n\"I assure you it is with M. Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Look now, this is what I mean; you draw your sword against the king in\nfighting with this gentleman.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, staring; \"are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am.\"\n\n\"What in the world are we to do, then?\"\n\n\"We must try and make a good supper, Porthos. The captain of the\nmusketeers keeps a tolerable table. There you will see the handsome\nSaint-Aignan, and will drink his health.\"\n\n\"I?\" cried Porthos, horrified.\n\n\"What!\" said D'Artagnan, \"you refuse to drink the king's health?\"\n\n\"But, body alive! I am not talking to you about the king at all; I am\nspeaking of M. de Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"But when I repeat that it is the same thing?\"\n\n\"Ah, well, well!\" said Porthos, overcome.\n\n\"You understand, don't you?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Porthos, \"but 'tis all the same.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXVII. M. de Baisemeaux's \"Society.\"\n\nThe reader has not forgotten that, on quitting the Bastile, D'Artagnan\nand the Comte de la Fere had left Aramis in close confabulation with\nBaisemeaux. When once these two guests had departed, Baisemeaux did not\nin the least perceive that the conversation suffered by their absence.\nHe used to think that wine after supper, and that of the Bastile\nin particular, was excellent, and that it was a stimulation quite\nsufficient to make any honest man talkative. But he little knew\nhis Greatness, who was never more impenetrable than at dessert. His\nGreatness, however, perfectly understood M. de Baisemeaux, when he\nreckoned on making the governor discourse by the means which the latter\nregarded as efficacious. The conversation, therefore, without flagging\nin appearance, flagged in reality; for Baisemeaux not only had it nearly\nall to himself, but further, kept speaking only of that singular event,\nthe incarceration of Athos, followed by so prompt an order to set him\nagain at liberty. Nor, moreover, had Baisemeaux failed to observe that\nthe two orders of arrest and of liberation, were both in the king's\nhand. But then, the king would not take the trouble to write similar\norders except under pressing circumstances. All this was very\ninteresting, and, above all, very puzzling to Baisemeaux; but as, on the\nother hand, all this was very clear to Aramis, the latter did not\nattach to the occurrence the same importance as did the worthy governor.\nBesides, Aramis rarely put himself out of the way for anything, and he\nhad not yet told M. de Baisemeaux for what reason he had now done so.\nAnd so at the very climax of Baisemeaux's dissertation, Aramis suddenly\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"Tell me, my dear Baisemeaux,\" said he, \"have you never had any other\ndiversions at the Bastile than those at which I assisted during the two\nor three visits I have had the honor to pay you?\"\n\nThis address was so unexpected that the governor, like a vane which\nsuddenly receives an impulsion opposed to that of the wind, was quite\ndumbfounded at it. \"Diversions!\" said he; \"but I take them continually,\nmonseigneur.\"\n\n\"Oh, to be sure! And these diversions?\"\n\n\"Are of every kind.\"\n\n\"Visits, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No, not visits. Visits are not frequent at the Bastile.\"\n\n\"What, are visits rare, then?\"\n\n\"Very much so.\"\n\n\"Even on the part of your society?\"\n\n\"What do you term my society--the prisoners?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!--your prisoners, indeed! I know well it is you who visit them,\nand not they you. By your society, I mean, my dear Baisemeaux, the\nsociety of which you are a member.\"\n\nBaisemeaux looked fixedly at Aramis, and then, as if the idea which had\nflashed across his mind were impossible, \"Oh,\" he said, \"I have very\nlittle society at present. If I must own it to you, dear M. d'Herblay,\nthe fact is, to stay at the Bastile appears, for the most part,\ndistressing and distasteful to persons of the gay world. As for the\nladies, it is never without a certain dread, which costs me infinite\ntrouble to allay, that they succeed in reaching my quarters. And,\nindeed, how should they avoid trembling a little, poor things, when\nthey see those gloomy dungeons, and reflect that they are inhabited\nby prisoners who--\" And in proportion as the eyes of Baisemeaux\nconcentrated their gaze on the face of Aramis, the worthy governor's\ntongue faltered more and more until it ended by stopping altogether.\n\n\"No, you don't understand me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; you don't\nunderstand me. I do not at all mean to speak of society in general, but\nof a particular society--of _the_ society, in a word--to which you are\naffiliated.\"\n\nBaisemeaux nearly dropped the glass of muscat which he was in the act of\nraising to his lips. \"Affiliated,\" cried he, \"affiliated!\"\n\n\"Yes, affiliated, undoubtedly,\" repeated Aramis, with the greatest\nself-possession. \"Are you not a member of a secret society, my dear M.\nBaisemeaux?\"\n\n\"Secret?\"\n\n\"Secret or mysterious.\"\n\n\"Oh, M. d'Herblay!\"\n\n\"Consider, now, don't deny it.\"\n\n\"But believe me.\"\n\n\"I believe what I know.\"\n\n\"I swear to you.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; I say yes, you say no; one of us\ntwo necessarily says what is true, and the other, it inevitably follows,\nwhat is false.\"\n\n\"Well, and then?\"\n\n\"Well, we shall come to an understanding presently.\"\n\n\"Let us see,\" said Baisemeaux; \"let us see.\"\n\n\"Now drink your glass of muscat, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,\" said\nAramis. \"What the devil! you look quite scared.\"\n\n\"No, no; not the least in the world; oh, no.\"\n\n\"Drink then.\" Baisemeaux drank, but he swallowed the wrong way.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Aramis, \"if, I say, you are not a member of a secret\nor mysterious society, which you like to call it--the epithet is of no\nconsequence--if, I say, you are not a member of a society similar to\nthat I wish to designate, well, then, you will not understand a word of\nwhat I am going to say. That is all.\"\n\n\"Oh! be sure beforehand that I shall not understand anything.\"\n\n\"Well, well!\"\n\n\"Try, now; let us see!\"\n\n\"That is what I am going to do.\"\n\n\"If, on the contrary, you are one of the members of this society, you\nwill immediately answer me--yes or no.\"\n\n\"Begin your questions,\" continued Baisemeaux, trembling.\n\n\"You will agree, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,\" continued Aramis, with\nthe same impassibility, \"that it is evident a man cannot be a member of\na society, it is evident that he cannot enjoy the advantages it offers\nto the affiliated, without being himself bound to certain little\nservices.\"\n\n\"In short,\" stammered Baisemeaux, \"that would be intelligible, if--\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Aramis, \"there is in the society of which I speak, and\nof which, as it seems you are not a member--\"\n\n\"Allow me,\" said Baisemeaux. \"I should not like to say absolutely.\"\n\n\"There is an engagement entered into by all the governors and captains\nof fortresses affiliated to the order.\" Baisemeaux grew pale.\n\n\"Now the engagement,\" continued Aramis firmly, \"is of this nature.\"\n\nBaisemeaux rose, manifesting unspeakable emotion: \"Go on, dear M.\nd'Herblay: go on,\" said he.\n\nAramis then spoke, or rather recited the following paragraph, in the\nsame tone as if he had been reading it from a book: \"The aforesaid\ncaptain or governor of a fortress shall allow to enter, when need shall\narise, and on demand of the prisoner, a confessor affiliated to the\norder.\" He stopped. Baisemeaux was quite distressing to look at,\nbeing so wretchedly pale and trembling. \"Is not that the text of the\nagreement?\" quietly asked Aramis.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" began Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Ah! well, you begin to understand, I think.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" cried Baisemeaux, \"do not trifle so with my unhappy mind!\nI find myself as nothing in your hands, if you have the malignant desire\nto draw from me the little secrets of my administration.\"\n\n\"Oh! by no means; pray undeceive yourself, dear M. Baisemeaux; it is not\nthe little secrets of your administration, but those of your conscience\nthat I aim at.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my conscience be it, dear M. d'Herblay. But have some\nconsideration for the situation I am in, which is no ordinary one.\"\n\n\"It is no ordinary one, my dear monsieur,\" continued the inflexible\nAramis, \"if you are a member of this society; but it is a quite natural\none if free from all engagement. You are answerable only to the king.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, well! I obey only the king, and whom else would you\nhave a French nobleman obey?\"\n\nAramis did not yield an inch, but with that silvery voice of his\ncontinued: \"It is very pleasant,\" said he, \"for a French nobleman, for\na prelate of France, to hear a man of your mark express himself so\nloyally, dear De Baisemeaux, and having heard you to believe no more\nthan you do.\"\n\n\"Have you doubted, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I? oh, no!\"\n\n\"And so you doubt no longer?\"\n\n\"I have no longer any doubt that such a man as you, monsieur,\" said\nAramis, gravely, \"does not faithfully serve the masters whom he\nvoluntarily chose for himself.\"\n\n\"Masters!\" cried Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Yes, masters, I said.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Herblay, you are still jesting, are you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I understand that it is a more difficult position to have\nseveral masters than one; but the embarrassment is owing to you, my dear\nBaisemeaux, and I am not the cause of it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" returned the unfortunate governor, more embarrassed\nthan ever; \"but what are you doing? You are leaving the table?\"\n\n\"Assuredly.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am going.\"\n\n\"But you are behaving very strangely towards me, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I am behaving strangely--how do you make that out?\"\n\n\"Have you sworn, then, to put me to the torture?\"\n\n\"No, I should be sorry to do so.\"\n\n\"Remain, then.\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because I have no longer anything to do here; and, indeed, I have\nduties to fulfil elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Duties, so late as this?\"\n\n\"Yes; understand me now, my dear De Baisemeaux: they told me at the\nplace whence I came, 'The aforesaid governor or captain will allow\nto enter, as need shall arise, on the prisoner's demand, a confessor\naffiliated with the order.' I came; you do not know what I mean, and so\nI shall return to tell them that they are mistaken, and that they must\nsend me elsewhere.\"\n\n\"What! you are--\" cried Baisemeaux, looking at Aramis almost in terror.\n\n\"The confessor affiliated to the order,\" said Aramis, without changing\nhis voice.\n\nBut, gentle as the words were, they had the same effect on the unhappy\ngovernor as a clap of thunder. Baisemeaux became livid, and it seemed to\nhim as if Aramis's beaming eyes were two forks of flame, piercing to\nthe very bottom of his soul. \"The confessor!\" murmured he; \"you,\nmonseigneur, the confessor of the order!\"\n\n\"Yes, I; but we have nothing to unravel together, seeing that you are\nnot one of the affiliated.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur!\"\n\n\"And I understand that, not being so, you refuse to comply with its\ncommand.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I beseech you, condescend to hear me.\"\n\n\"And wherefore?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I do not say that I have nothing to do with the society.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\"\n\n\"I say not that I refuse to obey.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, M. de Baisemeaux, what has passed wears very much the air\nof resistance.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! monseigneur, no; I only wished to be certain.\"\n\n\"To be certain of what?\" said Aramis, in a tone of supreme contempt.\n\n\"Of nothing at all, monseigneur.\" Baisemeaux lowered his voice, and\nbending before the prelate, said, \"I am at all times and in all places\nat the disposal of my superiors, but--\"\n\n\"Very good. I like you better thus, monsieur,\" said Aramis, as he\nresumed his seat, and put out his glass to Baisemeaux, whose hand\ntrembled so that he could not fill it. \"You were saying 'but'--\"\ncontinued Aramis.\n\n\"But,\" replied the unhappy man, \"having received no notice, I was very\nfar from expecting it.\"\n\n\"Does not the Gospel say, 'Watch, for the moment is known only of God?'\nDo not the rules of the order say, 'Watch, for that which I will, you\nought always to will also.' And what pretext will serve you now that you\ndid not expect the confessor, M. de Baisemeaux?\"\n\n\"Because, monseigneur, there is at present in the Bastile no prisoner\nill.\"\n\nAramis shrugged his shoulders. \"What do you know about that?\" said he.\n\n\"But, nevertheless, it appears to me--\"\n\n\"M. de Baisemeaux,\" said Aramis, turning round in his chair, \"here is\nyour servant, who wishes to speak with you;\" and at this moment, De\nBaisemeaux's servant appeared at the threshold of the door.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Baisemeaux, sharply.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the man, \"they are bringing you the doctor's return.\"\n\nAramis looked at De Baisemeaux with a calm and confident eye.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"let the messenger enter.\"\n\nThe messenger entered, saluted, and handed in the report. Baisemeaux\nran his eye over it, and raising his head, said in surprise, \"No. 12 is\nill!\"\n\n\"How was it, then,\" said Aramis, carelessly, \"that you told me everybody\nwas well in your hotel, M. de Baisemeaux?\" And he emptied his glass\nwithout removing his eyes from Baisemeaux.\n\nThe governor then made a sign to the messenger, and when he had quitted\nthe room, said, still trembling, \"I think that there is in the article,\n'on the prisoner's demand.'\"\n\n\"Yes, it is so,\" answered Aramis. \"But see what it is they want with you\nnow.\"\n\nAnd that moment a sergeant put his head in at the door. \"What do you\nwant now?\" cried Baisemeaux. \"Can you not leave me in peace for ten\nminutes?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the sergeant, \"the sick man, No. 12, has commissioned\nthe turnkey to request you to send him a confessor.\"\n\nBaisemeaux very nearly sank on the floor; but Aramis disdained to\nreassure him, just as he had disdained to terrify him. \"What must I\nanswer?\" inquired Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Just what you please,\" replied Aramis, compressing his lips; \"that is\nyour business. _I_ am not the governor of the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Tell the prisoner,\" cried Baisemeaux, quickly,--\"tell the prisoner that\nhis request is granted.\" The sergeant left the room. \"Oh! monseigneur,\nmonseigneur,\" murmured Baisemeaux, \"how could I have suspected!--how\ncould I have foreseen this!\"\n\n\"Who requested you to suspect, and who besought you to foresee?\"\ncontemptuously answered Aramis. \"The order suspects; the order knows;\nthe order foresees--is that not enough?\"\n\n\"What is it you command?\" added Baisemeaux.\n\n\"I?--nothing at all. I am nothing but a poor priest, a simple confessor.\nHave I your orders to go and see the sufferer?\"\n\n\"Oh, monseigneur, I do not order; I pray you to go.\"\n\n\"'Tis well; conduct me to him.\"\n\nEnd of Louise de la Valliere.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
