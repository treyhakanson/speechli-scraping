Pleasure with violet\neyes was in Chicago.  My passport describes me as a journalist.\nMy employer said:  \"Go to Jerusalem.\"  I went, that was in 1920.\n\nI had been there a couple of times before the World War, when the\nTurks were in full control.  So I knew about the bedbugs and the\nstench of the citadel moat;  the pre-war price of camels;  enough\nArabic to misunderstand it when spoken fluently, and enough of\nthe Old Testament and the Koran to guess at Arabian motives,\nwhich are important, whereas words are usually such stuff as lies\nare made of.\n\nEl Kudz, as Arabs call Jerusalem, is, from a certain distance, as\nthey also call it, shellabi kabir.  Extremely beautiful.\nBeautiful upon a mountain.  El Kudz means The City, and in a\ncertain sense it is that, to unnumbered millions of people.\nLudicrous, uproarious, dignified, pious, sinful, naively\nconfidential, secretive, altruistic, realistic.  Hoary-ancient\nand ultra-modern.  Very, very proud of its name Jerusalem, which\nmeans City of Peace.  Full to the brim with the malice of\ncertainly fifty religions, fifty races, and five hundred thousand\ncurious political chicaneries disguised as plans to save our\nsouls from hell and fill some fellow's purse.  The jails\nare full.\n\n\"Look for a man named Grim,\" said my employer.  \"James Schuyler\nGrim, American, aged thirty-four or so.  I've heard he knows\nthe ropes.\"\n\nThe ropes, when I was in Jerusalem before the war, were\nprincipally used for hanging people at the Jaffa Gate, after they\nhad been well beaten on the soles of their feet to compel them to\ntell where their money was hidden.  The Turks entirely understood\nthe arts of suppression and extortion, which they defined as\ngovernment.  The British, on the other hand, subject their normal\nhuman impulse to be greedy, and their educated craving to be\ngentlemanly white man's burden-bearers, to a process of compromise.\nPerhaps that isn't government.  But it works.  They even carry\ncompromise to the point of not hanging even their critics if\nthey can possibly avoid doing it.  They had not yet, but they\nwere about to receive a brand-new mandate from a brand-new\nLeague of Nations, awkwardly qualified by Mr. Balfour's\npost-Armistice promise to the Zionists to give the country to\nthe Jews, and by a war-time promise, in which the French had\njoined, to create an Arab kingdom for the Arabs.\n\nSo there was lots of compromising being done, and hell to pay,\nwith no one paying, except, of course, the guests in the hotels,\nat New York prices.  The Zionist Jews were arriving in droves.\nThe Arabs, who owned most of the land, were threatening to cut\nall the Jews' throats as soon as they could first get all their\nmoney.  Feisal, a descendant of the Prophet, who had fought\ngloriously against the Turks, was romantically getting ready in\nDamascus to be crowned King of Syria.  The French, who pride\nthemselves on being realistic, were getting ready to go after\nFeisal with bayonets and poison-gas, as they eventually did.\n\nIn Jerusalem the Bolsheviks, astonishingly credulous of \"secret\"\nnews from Moscow, and skeptical of every one's opinion but their\nown, were bolsheviking Marxian Utopia beneath a screen of such\narrogant innocence that even the streetcorner police constables\nsuspected them.  And Mustapha Kemal, in Anatolia, was rumoured to\nbe preparing a holy war.  It was known as a Ghazi in those\ndays.  He had not yet scrapped religion.  He was contemplating,\nso said rumour, a genuine old-fashioned moslem jihad, with\nmodern trimmings.\n\nA few enthusiasts astonishingly still laboured for an American\nmandate.  At the Holy Sepulchre a British soldier stood on guard\nwith bayonet and bullets to prevent the priests of rival creeds\nfrom murdering one another.  The sun shone and so did the stars.\nGeneral Bols reopened Pontius Pilate's water-works.  The learned\nmonks in convents argued about facts and theories denied by\narchaeologists.  Old-fashioned Jews wailed at the Wailing Wall.\nTommy Atkins blasphemously dug corpses of donkeys and dogs from\nthe Citadel moat.\n\nI arrived in the midst of all that, and spent a couple of months\ntrying to make head or tail of it, and wondering, if that was\npeace, what war is?  They say that wherever a man was ever slain\nin Palestine a flower grows.  So one gets a fair idea of the\ncountry's mass-experience without much difficulty.  For three\nmonths of the year, from end to end, the whole landscape is\ncarpeted with flowers so close together that, except where beasts\nand men have trodden winding tracks, one can hardly walk without\ncrushing an anemone or wild chrysanthemum.  There are more\nbattle-fields in that small land than all Europe can show.  There\nare streams everywhere that historians assert repeatedly \"ran\nblood for days.\"\n\nFive thousand years of bloody terrorism, intermingling of races,\npiety, plunder, politics and pilgrims, have produced a self-\nconsciousness as concentrated as liquid poison-gas.  The laughter\nis sarcastic, the humour sardonic, and the credulity beyond\nanalysis.  For instance, when I got there, I heard the British\nbeing accused of \"imperialistic savagery\" because they had\nremoved the leprous beggars from the streets into a clean place\nwhere they could receive medical treatment.\n\nIt was difficult to find one line of observation.  Whatever\nanybody told you, was reversed entirely by the next man.  The\nthroat-distorting obligation to study Arabic called for rather\nintimate association with educated Arabs, whose main obsession\nwas fear of the Zionist Jews.  The things they said against\nthe Jews turned me pro-Zionist.  So I cautiously made the\nacquaintance of some gentlemen with gold-rimmed spectacles, and\nthe things they said about the Arabs set me to sympathizing with\nthe sons of Ishmael again.\n\nIn the midst of that predicament I met Jimgrim--Major James\nSchuyler Grim, to give him his full title, although hardly any\none ever called him by it.  After that, bewilderment began to\ncease as, under his amused, painstaking fingers, thread after\nthread of the involved gnarl of plots and politics betrayed\nits course.\n\nHowever, first I must tell how I met him.  There is an American\nColony in Jerusalem--a community concern that runs a one-price\nstore, and is even more savagely criticized than the British\nAdministration, as is only natural.  The story of what they did\nin the war is a three-year epic.  You can't be \"epic\" and not\nmake enemies.\n\nA Chicago Jew assured me they were swine and horse-thieves.  But\nI learned that the Yemen Jews prayed for them--first prayer--\nevery Sabbath of the year, calling down blessings on their heads\nfor charitable service rendered.\n\nOne hardly goes all the way to Palestine to meet Americans;  but\na journalist can't afford to be wilfully ignorant.  A British\nofficial assured me they were \"good blokes\" and an Armenian told\nme they could skin fleas for their hides and tallow;  but the\nArmenian was wearing a good suit, and eating good food, which he\nadmitted had been given to him by the American Colony.  He was\nbitter with them because they had refused to cash a draft on\nMosul, drawn on a bank that had ceased to exist.\n\nIt seemed a good idea to call on the American Colony, at their\nstore near the Jaffa Gate, and it turned out to be a very clean\nspot in a dirty city.  I taxed their generosity, and sat for\nhours on a ten-thousand-dollar pile of Asian rugs behind the\nstore;  and, whatever I have missed and lost, or squandered, at\nleast I know their story and can keep it until the proper time.\n\nOf course, you have to allow for point of view, just as the\nmariner allows for variation and deviation;  but when they\ninferred that most of the constructive good that has come to the\nNear East in the last fifty years has been American, they spoke\nwith the authority of men who have lived on the spot and watched\nit happen.\n\n\"You see, the Americans who have come here haven't set up\ngovernments.  They've opened schools and colleges.  They've\npoured in education, and taken nothing.  Then there are thousands\nof Arabs, living in hovels because there's nothing better, who\nhave been to America and brought back memories with them.  All\nthat accounts for the desire for an American mandate--which would\nbe a very bad thing, though, because the moment we set up a\ngovernment we would lose our chance to be disinterested.  The\ncountry is better off under any other mandate, provided it gives\nAmericans the right to teach without ruling.  America's mission\nis educational.  There's an American, though, who might seem to\nprove the contrary.  Do you see him?\"\n\nThere were two Arabs in the room, talking in low tones over by\nthe window. I could imagine the smaller of the two as a peddler\nof lace and filigree-silver in the States, who had taken out\npapers for the sake of privilege and returned full of notions to\nexploit his motherland.  But the tall one--never.  He was a\nBedouin, if ever a son of the desert breathed.  If he had visited\nthe States, then he had come back as unchanged as gold out of an\nacid bath;  and as for being born there--\n\n\"That little beady-eyed, rat-faced fellow may be an American,\" I\nsaid.  \"In fact, of course he is, since you say so.  But as for\nbeing up to any good--\"\n\n\"You're mistaken.  You're looking at the wrong man.  Observe the\nother one.\"\n\nI was more than ever sure I was not mistaken.  Stately gesture,\ndignity, complexion, attitude--to say nothing of his Bedouin\narray and the steadiness with which he kept his dark eyes fixed\non the smaller man he was talking to, had laid the stamp of the\ndesert on the taller man from head to heel.\n\n\"That tall man is an American officer in the British army.\nDoesn't look the part, eh?  They say he was the first American to\nbe granted a commission without any pretense of his being a\nCanadian.  They accepted him as an American.  It was a case of\nthat or nothing.  Lived here for years, and knew the country so\nwell that they felt they had to have him on his own terms.\"\n\n\nYou can believe anything in Jerusalem after you have been in the\nplace a week or two, so, seeing who my informant was, I swallowed\nthe fact.  But it was a marvel.  It seemed even greater when the\nman strolled out, pausing to salute my host with the solemn\npoliteness that warfare with the desert breeds.  You could not\nimagine that at Ellis Island, or on Broadway--even on the stage.\nIt was too untheatrical to be acting;  too individual to be\nimitation;  to unself-conscious to have been acquired.  I\nhazarded a guess.\n\n\"A red man, then.  Carlisle for education.  Swallowed again by\nthe first desert he stayed in for more than a week.\"\n\n\"Wrong.  His name is Grim.  Sounds like Scandinavian ancestry, on\none side.  James Schuyler Grim--Dutch, then, on the other;  and\nsome English.  Ten generations in the States at any rate.  He can\ntell you all about this country.  Why not call on him?\"\n\nIt did not need much intelligence to agree to that suggestion;\nbut the British military take their code with them to the\nuttermost ends of earth, behind which they wonder why so many\nfolks with different codes, or none, dislike them.\n\n\"Write me an introduction,\" I said.\n\n\"You won't need one.  Just call on him.  He lives at a place they\ncall the junior Staff Officers' Mess--up beyond the Russian\nConvent and below the Zionist Hospital.\"\n\nSo I went that evening, finding the way with difficulty because\nthey talk at least eighteen languages in Jerusalem and, with the\nexception of official residences, no names were posted anywhere.\nThat was not an official residence.  It was a sort of communal\nboarding-house improvised by a dozen or so officers in preference\nto the bug-laden inconvenience of tents--in a German-owned\n(therefore enemy property) stone house at the end of an alley, in\na garden full of blooming pomegranates.\n\nI sent my card in by a flat-footed old Russian female, who ran\ndown passages and round corners like a wet hen, trying to find a\nman-servant.  The place seemed deserted, but presently she came\non her quarry in the back yard, and a very small boy in a\ntarboosh and knickerbockers carried the card on a tray into a\nroom on the left.  Through the open door I could hear one quiet\nquestion and a high-pitched disclaimer of all knowledge;  then an\norder, sounding like a grumble, and the small boy returned to the\nhall to invite me in, in reasonably good English, of which he\nseemed prouder than I of my Arabic.\n\nSo I went into the room on the left, with that Bedouin still in\nmind.  There was only one man in there, who got out of a deep\narmchair as I entered, marking his place in a book with a\nDamascus dagger.  He did not look much more than middle height,\nnor more than medium dark complexioned, and he wore a major's\nkhaki uniform.\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" I said.  \"I've disturbed the wrong man.  I came to\ncall on an American named Major Grim.\"\n\n\"I'm Grim.\"\n\n\"Must be a mistake, though.  The man I'm looking for is taller\nthan you--very dark--looks, walks, speaks and acts like a\nBedouin.  I saw him this afternoon in Bedouin costume in the\nAmerican Colony store.\"\n\n\"Yes, I noticed you.  Sit down, won't you?  Yes, I'm he--the\nBedouin abayi* seems to add to a man's height.  Soap and water\naccount for the rest of it.  These cigars are from the States.\"\n[*Long-sleeved outer cloak.]\n\nIt was hard to believe, even on the strength of his straight\nstatement--he talking undisguised American, and smiling at me, no\ndoubt vastly pleased with my incredulity.\n\n\"Are you a case of Jekyll and Hyde?\" I asked.\n\n\"No.  I'm more like both sides of a sandwich with some army mule-\nmeat in the middle.  But I won't be interviewed.  I hate it.\nBesides, it's against the regulations.\"\n\nHis voice was not quite so harshly nasal as those of the Middle\nWest, but he had not picked up the ultra-English drawl and\nclipped-off consonants that so many Americans affect abroad\nand overdo.\n\nI don't think a wise crook would have chosen him as a subject for\nexperiments.  He had dark eyes with noticeably long lashes;\nheavy eyebrows;  what the army examination-sheets describe as a\nmedium chin;  rather large hands with long, straight fingers;\nand feet such as an athlete stands on, fully big for his size,\nbut well shaped.  He was young for a major--somewhere between\nthirty and thirty-five.\n\nOnce he was satisfied that I would not write him up for the\nnewspapers he showed no disinclination to talk, although it was\ndifficult to keep him on the subject of himself, and easy to let\nhim lose you in a maze of tribal history.  He seemed to know the\nins and outs of every blood-feud from Beersheba to Damascus, and\nwarmed to his subject as you listened.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, by way of apology when I laughed at a string\nof names that to me conjured up only confusion, \"my beat is all\nthe way from Cairo to Aleppo--both sides of the Jordan.  I'm not\non the regular strength, but attached to the Intelligence--no,\nnot permanent--don't know what the future has in store--that\nprobably depends on whether or not the Zionists get full control,\nand how soon.  Meanwhile, I'm my own boss more or less--report\ndirect to the Administrator, and he's one of those men who allows\nyou lots of scope.\"\n\nThat was the sort of occasional glimpse he gave of himself, and\nthen switched off into straight statements about the Zionist\nproblem.  All his statements were unqualified, and given with the\nair of knowing all about it right from the beginning.\n\n\"There's nothing here that really matters outside the Zionist-\nArab problem.  But that's a big one.  People don't realize it--\neven on the spot--but it's a world movement with ramifications\neverywhere.  All the other politics of the Near East hinge on it,\neven when it doesn't appear so on the surface.  You see, the Jews\nhave international affiliations through banks and commerce.  They\nhave blood-relations everywhere.  A ripple here may mean there's\na wave in Russia, or London, or New York.  I've known at least\none Arab blood-feud over here that began with a quarrel between a\nJew and a Christian in Chicago.\"\n\n\"Are the Zionists as dangerous as the Arabs seem to think?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes and no.  Depends what you call danger.  They're like an\nincoming tide.  All you can do is accept the fact and ride on top\nof it, move away in front of it, or go under.  The Arabs want to\npush it back with sword-blades.  Can't be done!\"\n\n\"Speaking as a mere onlooker, I feel sorry for the Arabs,\" I\nsaid.  \"It has been their country for several hundred years.\nThey didn't even drive the Jews out of it;  the Romans attended\nto that, after the Assyrians and Babylonians had cleaned up\nnine-tenths of the population.  And at that, the Jews were\ninvaders themselves.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Grim answered.  \"But you can't argue with tides.  The\nArabs are sore, and nobody has any right to blame them.  The\nEnglish betrayed the Arabs--I don't mean the fellows out here,\nbut the gang at the Foreign Office.\"\n\nI glanced at his uniform.  That was a strange statement coming\nfrom a man who wore it.  He understood, and laughed.\n\n\"Oh, the men out here all admit it.  They're as sore as the Arabs\nare themselves.\"\n\n\"Then you're on the wrong side, and you know it?\" I suggested.\n\n\"The meat,\" he said, \"is in the middle of the sandwich.  In a\nsmall way you might say I'm a doctor, staying on after a riot to\nstitch up cuts.  The quarrel was none of my making, although I\nwas in it and did what I could to help against the Turks.  Like\neverybody else who knows them, I admire the Turks and hate what\nthey stand for--hate their cruelty.  I was with Lawrence across\nthe Jordan--went all the way to Damascus with him--saw the war\nthrough to a finish--in case you choose to call it finished.\"\n\nVainly I tried to pin him down to personal reminiscences.  He was\nnot interested in his own story.\n\n\"The British promised old King Hussein of Mecca that if he'd\nraise an Arab army to use against the Turks, there should be a\nunited Arab kingdom afterward under a ruler of their own\nchoosing.  The kingdom was to include Syria, Arabia and\nPalestine.  The French agreed.  Well, the Arabs raised the army;\nEmir Feisul, King Hussein's third son, commanded it;  Lawrence\ndid so well that he became a legend.  The result was, Allenby\ncould concentrate his army on this side of the Jordan and\nclean up.  He made a good job of it.  The Arabs were naturally\ncock-a-hoop.\"\n\nI suggested that the Arabs with that great army could have\nenforced the contract, but he laughed again.\n\n\"They were being paid in gold by the British, and had Lawrence to\nhold them together.  The flow of gold stopped, and Lawrence was\nsent home.  Somebody at the Foreign Office had changed his mind.\nYou see, they were all taken by surprise at the speed of\nAllenby's campaign.  The Zionists saw their chance, and claimed\nPalestine.  No doubt they had money and influence.  Perhaps it\nwas Jewish gold that had paid the wages of the Arab army.\nAnyhow, the French laid claim to Syria.  By the time the war was\nover the Zionists had a hard-and-fast guarantee, the French claim\nto Syria had been admitted, and there wasn't any country left\nexcept some Arabian desert to let the Arabs have.  That's the\nsituation.  Feisul is in Damascus, going through the farce of\nbeing proclaimed king, with the French holding the sea-ports and\ngetting ready to oust him.  The Zionists are in Jerusalem,\nworking like beavers, and the British are getting ready to pull\nout as much as possible and leave the Zionists to do their own\nworrying.  Mesopotamia is in a state of more or less anarchy.\nEgypt is like a hot-box full of explosive--may go off any minute.\nThe Arabs would like to challenge the world to mortal combat,\nand then fight one another while the rest of the world pays\nthe bill--\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"The French, for instance.  Their army is weak at the moment.\nThey've neither men nor money--only a hunger to own Syria.  They\ndon't play what the English call 'on side.'  They play a mean\ngame.  The French General Staff figure that if Feisul should\nattack them now he might beat them.  So they've conceived the\nbrilliant idea of spreading sedition and every kind of political\ndiscontent into Palestine and across the Jordan, so that if the\nArabs make an effort they'll make it simultaneously in both\ncountries.  Then the British, being in the same mess with the\nFrench, would have to take the French side and make a joint\ncampaign of it.\"\n\n\"But don't the British know this?\"\n\n\"You bet they know it.  What's the Intelligence for?  The French\nare hiring all the Arab newspapers to preach against the British.\nA child could see it with his eyes shut.\"\n\n\"Then why in thunder don't the British have a showdown?\"\n\n\"That's where the joker comes in.  The French know there's a sort\nof diplomatic credo at the London Foreign Office to the general\neffect that England and France have got to stand together or\nEurope will go to pieces.  The French are realists.  They bank\non that.  They tread on British corns, out here, all they want\nto, while they toss bouquets, backed by airplanes, across the\nEnglish Channel.\"\n\n\"Then the war didn't end the old diplomacy?\"\n\n\"What a question!  But I haven't more than scratched the Near\nEast surface for you yet.  There's Mustapha Kemal in Anatolia,\nleader of the Turkish Nationalists, no more dead or incapacitated\nthan a possum.  He's playing for his own hand--Kaiser Willy\nstuff--studying Trotzky and Lenin, and flirting with Feisul's\nparty on the side.  Then there's a Bolshevist element among the\nZionists--got teeth, too.  There's an effort being made from\nIndia to intrigue among the Sikh troops employed in Palestine.\nThere's a very strong party yelling for an American mandate.  The\nArmenians, poor devils, are pulling any string they can get hold\nof, in the hope that anything at all may happen.  The orthodox\nJews are against the Zionists;  the Arabs are against them both,\nand furious with one another.  There's a pan-Islam movement on\nfoot, and a pan-Turanian--both different, and opposed.  About 75\nper cent of the British are as pro-Arab as they dare be, but the\nrest are strong for the Zionists.  And the Administrator's\nneutral!--strong for law and order but taking no sides.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm one of the men who is trying to keep the peace.\"\n\nHe invited me to stay to dinner.  The other members of the mess\nwere trooping in, all his juniors, all obviously fond of him\nand boisterously irreverent of his rank.  Dinner under his\nchairmanship was a sort of school for repartee.  It was utterly\nunlike the usual British mess dinner.  If you shut your eyes for\na minute you couldn't believe that any one present had ever worn\na uniform.  I learned afterward that there was quite a little\ncompetition to get into that mess.\n\nAfter dinner most of them trooped out again, to dance with\nZionist ladies at an institute affair.  But he and I stayed, and\ntalked until midnight.  Before I left, the key of Palestine and\nSyria was in my hands.\n\n\"You seem interested,\" he said, coming with me to the door.  \"If\nyou don't mind rough spots now and then, I'll try to show you a\nfew things at first hand.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\n\"No objection;  only a stipulation.\"\n\n\nThe showmanship began much sooner than I hoped.  The following\nday was Sunday, and I had an invitation to a sort of semi-public\ntea given by the American Colony after their afternoon religious\nservice.\n\nThey received their guests in a huge, well-furnished room on the\nupper floor of a stone house built around a courtyard filled with\nflowers.  I think they were a little proud of the number of\nfierce-looking Arabs, who had traveled long distances in order to\nbe present.  Ten Arab chieftains in full costume, with fifteen or\ntwenty of their followers, all there at great expense of trouble,\ntime and money, for friends sake, were, after all, something to\nfeel a bit chesty about.  Every member of the Colony seemed able\nto talk Arabic like a native and, as they used to say in the up-\nstate papers, a good time was being had by all.  The Near East\nadores ice-cream, and there was lots of it.\n\nTwo of the Arab chiefs were Christians;  the rest were not.  The\npeace and war record of the Colony was what had brought them all\nthere.  Hardly an Arab in the country was not the Colony's debtor\nfor disinterested help, direct or indirect, at some time in some\nway.  The American Colony was the one place in the country where\na man of any creed could go and be sure that whatever he might\nsay would not be used against him.  So they were talking their\nheads off.  Hot air and Arab politics have quite a lot in common.\nBut there was a broad desert-breath about it all.  It wasn't like\nthe little gusty yaps you hear in the city coffee-shops.  A lot\nof the talk was foolish, but it was all magnificent.\n\nThere was one sheikh named Mustapha ben Nasir dressed in a blue\nserge suit and patent-leather boots, with nothing to show his\nnationality except a striped silk head-dress with the camel-hair\nband around the forehead.  He was a handsome fellow, with a black\nbeard trimmed to a point, and perfect manners, polished no doubt\nin a dozen countries, but still Eastern in slow, deferential\ndignity.  He could talk good French.  I fell in conversation\nwith him.\n\nThe frankness with which treason is mooted, admitted and\ndiscussed in the Near East is one of the first things that amaze\nyou.  They are so open about it that nobody takes them seriously.\nApparently it is only when they don't talk treason openly that\nthe ruling authorities get curious and make arrests.  To me, a\ntotal stranger, with nothing to recommend me but that for an hour\nor two that afternoon I was a guest of the American Colony,\nMustapha ben Nasir made no bones whatever about the fact that the\nwas being paid by the French to stir up feeling over Jordan\nagainst the British.\n\n\"I receive a monthly salary,\" he boasted.  \"I am just from\nDamascus, where the French Liaison-officer paid me and gave me\nsome instructions.\"\n\n\"Where is your home?\" I asked him.\n\n\"At El-Kerak, in the mountains of Moab, across the Dead Sea.  I\nstart this evening.  Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"Je m'en bien garderai!\"\n\nHe smiled.  \"Myself, I am in favor of the British.  The French\npay my expenses, that is all.  What we all want is an independent\nArab government--some say kingdom, some say republic.  If it is\nnot time for that yet, then we would choose an American mandate.\nBut America has deserted us.  Failing America, we prefer the\nEnglish for the present.  Anything except France!  We do not want\nto become a new Algeria.\"\n\n\"What is the condition now at El-Kerak?\"\n\n\"Condition?  There is none.  There is chaos.  You see, the\nBritish say their authority ceases at the River Jordan and at a\nline drawn down the middle of the Dead Sea.  That leaves us with\na choice between two other governments--King Hussein's government\nof Mecca, and Feisul's in Syria.  But Hussein's arm is not long\nenough to reach us from the South, and Feisul's is not nearly\nstrong enough to interfere from the North.  So there is\nno government, and each man is keeping the peace with his\nown sword.\"\n\n\"You mean;  each man on his own account?\"\n\n\"Yes.  So there is peace.  Five--fifteen--thirty throats are cut\ndaily;  and if you go down to the Jordan and listen, you will\nhear the shots being fired from ambush any day.\"\n\n\"And you invite me to make the trip with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is nothing.  In the first place, you are American.\nNobody will interfere with an American.  They are welcome.  In\nthe second place, there is a good reason for bringing you;  we\nall want an American school at El-Kerak.\"\n\n\"But I am no teacher.\"\n\n\"But you will be returning to America?  It is enough, then, that\nyou look the situation over, and tell what you know on your\nreturn.  We will provide a building, a proper salary, and\nguarantee the teacher's life.  We would prefer a woman, but it\nwould be wisest to send a man.\"\n\n\"How so?  The woman might not shoot straight?  I've some of our\nWestern women do tricks with a gun that would--\"\n\n\"There would be no need.  She would have our word of honour.  But\nevery sheikh who has only three wives would want to make her his\nfourth.  A man would be best.  Will you come with me?\"\n\n\"On your single undertaking to protect me?  Are you king of all\nthat countryside?\"\n\n\"If you will come, you shall have an escort, every man of whom\nwill die before he would let you be killed.  And if they, and\nyou, should all be killed, their sons and grandsons would avenge\nyou to the third generation of your murderers.\"\n\n\"That's undoubtedly handsome, but--\"\n\n\"Believe me, effendi,\" he urged, \"many a soul has been consoled\nin hell-fire by the knowledge that his adversaries would be cut\noff in their prime by friends who are true to their given word.\"\n\nMeaning to back out politely, I assured him I would think the\noffer over.\n\n\"Well and good,\" he answered.  \"You have my promise.  Should you\ndecide to come, leave word here with the American Colony.  They\nwill get word to me.  Then I will send for you, and the escort\nshall meet you at the Dead Sea.\"\n\nI talked it over with two or three members of the Colony, and\nthey assured me the promise could be depended on.  One of\nthem added:\n\n\"Besides, you ought to see El-Kerak.  It's an old crusader city,\nrather ruined, but more or less the way the crusaders left it.\nAnd that craving of theirs for a school is worth doing something\nabout, if you ever have an opportunity.  They say they have too\nmuch religion already, and no enlightenment at all.  A teacher\nwho knew Arabic would have a first-class time, and would be well\npaid and protected, if he could keep his hands off politics.  Why\nnot talk with Major Grim?\"\n\nIt was a half-hour's walk to Grim's place, but I had the good\nfortune to catch him in again.  He was sitting in the same chair,\nstudying the same book, and this time I saw the title of it--\nWalter Pater's Marius the Epicurean--a strange book for a soldier\nto be reading, and cutting its pages with an inlaid dagger, in a\nJerusalem semi-military boarding-house.  But he was a man of\nunexpectedly assorted moods.\n\nHe laughed when I told of ben Nasir.  He looked serious when I\nmooted El-Kerak--serious, then interested, them speculative.\nFrom where I sat I could watch the changes in his eyes.\n\n\"What would the escort amount to?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Absolute security.\"\n\n\"And what's this bunk about Americans being welcome anywhere?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true.  All the way from Aleppo down to Beersheba.  Men\nlike Dr. Bliss* have made such an impression that an occasional\nrotter might easily take advantage of it.  Americans in this\ncountry--so far--stand for altruism without ulterior motive.\nIf we'd accepted the mandate they might have found us out!\nMeanwhile, an American is safe.\"  [*President of the American\nCollege at Beirut.  Died 1920, probably more respected throughout\nthe Near East than any ten men of any other nationality.]\n\n\"Then I think I'll go to El-Kerak.\"\n\nAgain his eyes grew speculative.  I could not tell whether he was\nconsidering me or some problem of his own.\n\n\"Speaking unofficially,\" he said, \"there are two possibilities.\nYou might go without permission--easy enough, provided you don't\ntalk beforehand.  In that case, you'd get there and back;  after\nwhich, the Administration would label and index you.  The\nremainder of your stay in Palestine would be about as exciting\nas pushing a perambulator in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.  You'd\nbe canned.\"\n\n\"I'd rather be killed.  What's the alternative?\"\n\n\"Get permission.  I shall be at El-Kerak myself within the next\nfew days.  I think it can be arranged.\"\n\n\"D'you mean I can go with you?\" I asked, as eager as a schoolboy\nfor the circus.\n\n\"Not on your life!  I don't go as an American.\"\n\nRecalling the first time I had seen him, I sat still and tried to\nlook like a person who was not thrilled in the least by seeing\nsecrets from the inside.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I'm in your hands.\"\n\nI think he rather liked that.  As I came to know him more\nintimately later on he revealed an iron delight in being trusted.\nBut he did not say another word for several minutes, as if there\nwere maps in his mind that he was conning before reaching a\ndecision.  Then he spoke suddenly.\n\n\"Are you busy?\" he asked.  \"Then come with me.\"\n\nHe phoned to some place or other for a staff automobile, and the\nman was there with it within three minutes.  We piled in and\ndrove at totally unholy speed down narrow streets between walls,\naround blind right-angle turns where Arab policemen stood waving\nunintelligible signals, and up the Mount of Olives, past the\nBritish military grave-yard, to the place they call OETA.*  The\nKaiser had it built to command every view of the countryside and\nbe seen from everywhere, as a monument to his own greatness--the\nbiggest, lordliest, most expensive hospice that his architects\ncould fashion, with pictures in mosaic on the walls and ceilings\nof the Kaiser and his ancestors in league with the Almighty.  But\nthe British had adopted it as Administration Headquarters.\n[*Headquarters:  Occupied Enemy Territory Administration.]\n\nAll the way up, behind and in front and on either hand, there\nwere views that millions* would give years of their lives to see;\nand they would get good value for their bargain.  Behind us, the\nsky-line was a panorama of the Holy City, domes, minarets and\ncurved stone roofs rising irregularly above gray battlemented\nwalls.  Down on the right was the ghastly valley of Jehoshaphat,\ntreeless, dry, and crowded with white tombs--\"dry bones in the\nvalley of death.\"  To the left were everlasting limestone hills,\none of them topped by the ruined reputed tomb of Samuel--all\ntrenched, cross-trenched and war-scarred, but covered now in a\nJoseph's coat of flowers, blue, blood-red, yellow and white. [*\nThis is no exaggeration.  There are actually millions, and on\nmore than one continent, whose dearest wish, could they have it,\nwould be to see Jerusalem before they die.]\n\nThere were lines of camels sauntering majestically along three\nhill-tops, making time, and the speed of the car we rode in, seem\nutterly unreal.  And as we topped the hill the Dead Sea lay below\nus, like a polished turquoise set in the yellow gold of the\nbarren Moab Mountains.  That view made you gasp.  Even Grim, who\nwas used to it, could not turn his eyes away.\n\nWe whirled past saluting Sikhs at the pompous Kaiserish entrance\ngate, and got out on to front steps that brought to mind one of\nthose glittering hotels at German cure-resorts--bad art, bad\ntaste, bad amusements and a big bill.\n\nBut inside, in the echoing stone corridors that opened through\nGothic windows on a courtyard, in which statues of German super-\npeople stared with blind eyes, there was nothing now but bald\nmilitary neatness and economy.  Hurrying up an uncarpeted stone\nstairway (Grim seemed to be a speed-demon once his mind was set)\nwe followed a corridor around two sides of the square, past\ndozens of closed doors bearing department names, to the\nAdministrator's quarters at the far end.  There, on a bare bench\nin a barren ante-room, Grim left me to cool my heels.  He\nknocked, and entered a door marked \"private.\"\n\nIt was fully half an hour before the door opened again and I was\nbeckoned in.  Grim was alone in the room with the Administrator,\na rather small, lean, rigidly set up man, with merry fire in his\neye, and an instantly obvious gift for being obeyed.  He sat at\nan enormous desk, but would have looked more at ease in a tent,\nor on horseback.  The three long rows of campaign ribbons looked\nincongruous beside the bunch of flowers that somebody had crammed\ninto a Damascus vase on the desk, with the estimable military\nnotion of making the utmost use of space.\n\nSir Louis was certainly in an excellent temper.  He offered me a\nchair, and looked at me with a sort of practical good-humour that\nseemed to say, \"Well, here he is;  now how shall we handle him?\"\nI was minded to ask outright for what I wanted, but something in\nhis attitude revealed that he knew all that already and would\nprefer to come at the problem in his own way.  It was clear,\nwithout a word being said, that he proposed to make some sort of\nuse of me without being so indiscreet as to admit it.  He\nreminded me rather of Julius Caesar, who was also a little man,\nconsidering the probable qualifications of some minor spoke in a\nprodigious wheel of plans.\n\n\"I understand you want to go to El-Kerak?\" he said, smiling as if\nall life were an amusing game.\n\nI admitted the impeachment.  Grim was standing, some little way\nbehind me and to one side;  I did not turn my head to look at\nhim, for that might have given a false impression that he and I\nwere in league together, but I was somehow aware that with folded\narms he was studying me minutely.\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Louis, \"there's no objection;  only a\nstipulation:  We wouldn't let an Englishman go, because of the\nrisk--not to him, but to us.  Any fool has a right to get killed,\nbut not to obligate his government.  All the missionaries were\ncalled in from those outlying districts long ago.  We don't want\nto be held liable for damages for failure to protect.  Such\nthings have happened.  You see, the idea is, we assume no\nresponsibility for what takes place beyond the Jordan and the\nDead Sea.  Now, if you'd like to sign a letter waiving any claim\nagainst us for protection, that would remove any obstacle to your\ngoing.  But, if you think that unreasonable, the alternative is\nsafe.  You can, stay in Jerusalem.  Quite simple.\"\n\nThat had the merit of frankness.  It sounded fair enough.\nNevertheless, he was certainly not being perfectly frank.  The\nmerriment in his eyes meant something more than mere amusement.\nIt occurred to me that his frankness took the extreme form of not\nconcealing that he had something important in reserve.  I rather\nliked him for it.  His attitude seemed to be that if I wanted to\ntake a chance, I might on my own responsibility, but that if my\ndoing so should happen to suit his plans, that was his affair.\nGrim was still watching me the way a cat watches a mouse.\n\n\"I'll sign such a letter,\" said I.\n\n\"Good.  Here are pen and paper.  Let's have it all in your\nhandwriting.  I'll call a clerk to witness the signature.\"\n\nI wrote down the simple statement that I wished to go to El-Kerak\nfor personal reasons, and that I waived all claim against the\nBritish Administration for personal protection, whether there or\nen route.  A clerk, who looked as if he could not have been hired\nto know, or understand, or remember anything without permission,\ncame in answer to the bell.  I signed.  He witnessed.\n\nSir Louis put the letter in a drawer, and the clerk went\nout again.\n\n\"How soon will you go?\"\n\nI told about the promised escort, and that a day or two would be\nneeded to get word to ben Nasir.  I forgot that ben Nasir would\nnot start before moonrise.  It appeared that Sir Louis knew more\nthan he cared to admit.\n\n\"Can't we get word to ben Nasir for him, Grim?\"\n\nGrim nodded.  So did Sir Louis:\n\n\"Good.  There'll be no need, then, for you to take any one into\nconfidence,\" he said, turning to me again.  \"As a rule it isn't\nwell to talk about these things, because people get wrong ideas.\nThere are others in Jerusalem who would like permission to go\nto El-Kerak.\"\n\n\"I'll tell nobody.\"\n\nHe nodded again.  He was still considering things in the back\nof his mind, while those intelligent, bright eyes smiled so\ndisarmingly.\n\n\"How do you propose to reach the Dead Sea?\" he asked.  \"Ben\nNasir's escort will probably meet you on the shore on this side.\"\n\n\"Oh, hire some sort of conveyance, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we lend him one of our cars, Grim?\"\n\nGrim nodded again.\n\n\"We'll do that.  Grim, can you get word to ben Nasir so that when\nthe escort is ready he may send a messenger straight to the hotel\nwith the information?  D'you get my meaning?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Grim, \"nobody else need know then.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Sir Louis.  He rose from his chair to intimate\nthat the precise moment had arrived when I might leave without\nindiscretion.  It was not until I was outside the door that I\nrealized that my permission was simply verbal, and that the only\ndocument that had changed hands had been signed by me.  Grim\nfollowed me into the ante-room after a minute.\n\n\"Hadn't I better go back and ask for something in writing from\nhim?\" I suggested.\n\n\"You wouldn't get it.  Anyhow, you're dealing with a gentleman.\nYou needn't worry.  I was afraid once or twice you might be going\nto ask him questions.  He'd have canned you if you had.  Why\ndidn't you?\"\n\nI was not going to help Grim dissect my mental processes.\n\n\"There's a delightful air of mystery,\" I said, \"I'd hate to\nspoil it!\"\n\n\"Come up on the tower,\" he said. \"There's just time before\nsunset.  If you've good eyes, I'll show you El-Kerak.\"\n\nIt is an enormous tower.  The wireless apparatus connected with\nit can talk with Paris and Calcutta.  From the top you feel as if\nyou were seeing \"all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of\ntime.\"  There are no other buildings to cut off the view or\ntamper with perspective.  The Dead Sea was growing dark.  The\nMoab Hills beyond it looked lonely and savage in silhouette.\n\n\"Down there on your left is Jericho,\" said Grim.  \"That winding\ncreek beyond it is the Jordan.  As far eastward as that there's\nsome peace.  Beyond that, there is hardly a rock that isn't used\nfor ambush regularly.  Let your eye travel along the top of the\nhills--nearly as far as the end of the Dead Sea.  Now--d'you see\nwhere a touch of sunlight glints on something?  That's the top of\nthe castle-wall of El-Kerak.  Judge what strategists those old\ncrusaders were.  That site commands the ancient high road from\nEgypt.  They could sit up there and take toll to their hearts'\ncontent.  The Turks quartered troops in the castle and did the\nsame thing.  But the Turks overdid it, like everything else.\nThey ruined the trade.  No road there nowadays that amounts\nto anything.\"\n\n\"It looks about ten miles away.\"\n\n\"More than eighty.\"\n\nThe sun went down behind us while we watched, and here and there\nthe little scattered lights came out among the silent hills in\nproof that there were humans who thought of them in terms of\nhome.\n\nVenus and Mars shone forth, yellow and red jewels;  then the\nmoon, rising like a stage effect, too big, too strongly lighted\nto seem real, peering inch by inch above the hills and ushering\nin silence.  We could hear one muezzin in Jerusalem wailing that\nGod is God.\n\n\"That over yonder is savage country,\" Grim remarked.  \"I think\nmaybe you'll like it. Time to go now.\"\n\nHe said nothing more until we were scooting downhill in the car\nin the midst of a cloud of dust.\n\n\"You won't see me again,\" he said then, \"until you get to El-\nKerak.  There are just one or two points to bear in mind.  D'you\ncare if I lecture?\"\n\n\"I wish you would.\"\n\n\"When the messenger comes from ben Nasir, go to the Governorate,\njust outside the Damascus Gate, phone OETA, say who you are, and\nask for the car.  Travel light.  The less you take with you, the\nless temptation there'll be to steal and that much less danger\nfor your escort.  I always take nothing,  and get shaved by a\nmurderer at the nearest village.  If you wash too much, or change\nyour shirt too often, they suspect you of putting on airs.  Can't\ntravel too light.  Use the car as far as Jericho, or thereabouts,\nand send it back when the messenger says he's through with it.\nAfter that, do whatever the leader of the escort tells you, and\nyou'll be all right.\"\n\n\"How do I cross the Dead Sea?\"\n\n\"That's ben Nasir's business.  There's another point I'll ask you\nto bear in mind.  When you see me at El-Kerak, be sure not to\nmake the slightest sign of recognition, unless and until you\nget word from me.  Act as if you'd never seen me in your\nlife before.\"\n\nI felt like an arch-conspirator, and there is no other sensation\nhalf so thrilling.  The flattery of being let in, as it were,\nthrough a secret door was like strong wine.\n\n\"Is your memory good?\" Grim asked me.  \"If you make notes, be\nsure you let everybody see them;  you'll find more than one of\nthem can read English.  If you should see or overhear anything\nthat you'd particularly like to remember because it might prove\nuseful to me, note it down by making faint dots under the letters\nof words you've already written;  or--better yet--take along a\npocket Bible;  they're all religious and respect the Bible.  Make\nfaint pencil lines underneath words or letters, and they'll think\nyou're more than extra devout.  There's nothing special to watch\nout for;  just keep your ears and eyes open.  Well, here's your\nhotel.  See you again soon.  So long.\"\n\nI got out of the car and went to get ready for a Christian dinner\nserved by Moslems, feeling like a person out of the Arabian\nNights, who had just met the owner of a magic carpet on which one\nonly had to sit in order to be wafted by invisible forces into\nunimaginable realms of mystery.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\n\"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you.\"\n\n\nI never learned exactly how Jim Grim got word to ben Nasir.  My\nsuspicion is that he took the simple course of getting the\nAmerican Colony to send one of their men;  but as they never\nreferred to it afterwards, and might have their own reasons for\nkeeping silence, I took care not to ask them.  We have most of us\nseen harm done by noisy gratitude for kindness, better covered up.\n\nI kept close to the hotel for three days, studying Arabic.  By\nthe fourth afternoon discouragement set in.  I began to believe\nthat the whole affair had petered out;  perhaps on reflection the\nAdministrator had decided I was not a proper person to be turned\nloose out of bounds, and nobody could have blamed him for that,\nfor he knew next to nothing about me.  Or Grim might have been\ncalled off for some other important business.  The chances seemed\nall against my going after all.\n\nBut on the fourth evening, just at sunset, when the sandwiches I\nhad ordered in advance were all thoroughly stale and I had almost\ndecided to unpack the small hand-grip and try to forget the whole\naffair, I noticed an Arab standing in the door of the hotel\nscrutinizing every one who passed him.  I watched him for five\nminutes.  He paid no attention to officers in uniform.  I left my\nchair in the lobby and walked past him twice.\n\nHe had one eye, like a gimlet on a universal joint;  he turned\nit this and that way without any corresponding movement of his\nhead.  It penetrated.  You felt he could have seen you with it\nin the dark.\n\nI started to pass him a third time.  He held his hand out and\nthrust a small, soiled piece of paper into mine.  The writing on\nit was in Arabic, so I went back to the seat in the far corner,\nto puzzle it out, he standing meanwhile in the doorway and\ncontinuing to quiz people as if I had meant nothing in his life.\nThe message was short enough:\n\n\nBearer will accompany you to a place where the escort will\nbe in readiness.  God give your honour a good journey.  Mustapha\nBen Nasir.\n\n\nI went to the Governorate and phoned for the car to come and pick\nme up outside the Jaffa Gate.  The Arab followed me, and he and I\nwere both searched at the gate for weapons, by a Sikh who knew\nnothing and cared less about Near East politics.  His orders were\nto search thoroughly.  He did it.  The man whose turn was next\nahead of mine was a Russian priest, whose long black cloak did\nnot save him from painstaking suspicion.  He was still\nindignantly refusing to take down his pants and prove that the\nhard lump on his thigh was really an amulet against sciatica,\nwhen the car came for me.\n\nIt was an ordinary Ford car, and the driver was not in uniform.\nHe, too, had only one eye in full commission, for the other was\nbruised and father swollen.  I got in beside him and let the Arab\nhave the rear seat to himself, reflecting that I would be able to\nsmell all the Arab sweat I cared to in the days to come.\n\nWe are governed much more by our noses than we are often aware\nof, and I believe that many people--in the East especially--use\nscent because intuition warns them that their true smell would\narouse unconscious antagonism.  Dogs, as well as most wild\nanimals, fight at the suggestion of a smell.  Humans only differ\nfrom the animals, much, when they are being self-consciously\nhuman.  Then they forget what they really know and tumble\nheadlong into trouble.\n\nThe driver seemed to know which road to take, and to be in no\nparticular hurry, perhaps on account of his injured eye.  He was\nan ex-soldier, of course:  one of those under-sized Cockneys with\nthe Whitechapel pallor overlying a pugnacious instinct, who make\nsuch astonishing fighting-men in the intervals between sulking\nand a sort of half-affectionate abuse of everything in sight.\nBeing impatient to begin the adventure, I suggested more speed.\n\n\"Oh!\" he answered.  \"So you're another o' these people in an\n'urry to get to Jericho!  It's strynge.  The last one was a\nHarab.  Tyke it from me, gov'nor, I've driven the very last\nHarab as gets more than twenty-five miles an hour out o' me,\nso 'elp me--\"\n\nHe tooled the car out on to the road toward Bethany, and down the\nsteep hill that passes under the Garden of Gethsemane, before\nvouchsafing another word.  Then, as we started to climb the hill\nahead, he jerked his chin in the direction of the sharp turn we\nhad just passed in the bottom of the valley.  \"Took that corner\nlas' time on one wheel!\"\n\n\"For the Arab?\"\n\n\"Aye.  Taught me a lesson.  Never agayn!  I ain't no Arabian\nNight.  Nor yet no self-immolatin' 'Indoo invitin' no juggernauts\nto make no pancykes out o' me.  'Enceforth, I drives reasonable.\nAll Harabs may go to 'ell for all o' me.\"\n\nHe was itching to tell his story.  He was likely to tell it\nquicker for not being questioned;  your Cockney dislikes anything\nhe can construe into inquisition.  I remarked that the road\ndidn't seem made for speed--too narrow and too rough--and let it\ngo at that.\n\nHe said no more until we reached the village of Bethany, and drew\nabreast of Lazarus' reputed tomb, where a pack of scavenger-dogs\nawoke and yelped around the wheels.  He did his best to run\nover one of them, but missed.  Then he could not hold his story\nany longer.\n\n\"Two nights ago,\" he said, \"they gives me orders to take a Harab\nto a point near Jericho.  After dark, I starts off, 'im on the\nback seat;  engine ain't warm yet, so we goes slow.  He leans\nforward after a couple o' minutes, an says 'Yalla kawam'!\" *  So\nI thinks to myself I'll show the blighter a thing or two, me not\nbein' used to takin' orders from no Harabs.  Soon as the engine's\n'ot I lets rip, an' you know now what the road's like.  When we\ngets to the top o' that 'ill above Gethsemane I lets extry\nspecial rip.  Thinks I, if you can stand what I can, my son,\nyou've guts. [*Hurry up.]\n\n\"Well, we 'its all the 'igh places, and lands on a bit o' level\nroad just often enough to pick up more speed--comes round that\nsharp bend on 'alf a wheel, syme as I told you--kills three pye-\ndogs for sure, an' maybe others, but I don't dare look round--\nmisses a camel in the dark that close that the 'air on my arms\nan' legs fair crawled up an' down me--'it's a lump o' rock that\ncomes near tippin' us into the ditch--an' carries on faster an'\never.  By the time we gets 'ere to Bethany, thinks I, it's time\nto take a look an' see if my passenger's still in the bloomin'\ncar.  So I slows down.\n\n\"The minute I turns my 'ead to 'ave a peer at 'im.  'Kawam!' 'e\nsays. 'Quick!  Quick!'\n\n\"So it strikes me I weren't in no such 'urry after all.  Why\n'urry for a Harab?  The car's been rattlin' worse 'n a tinker's\nbasket.  I gets down to lave a look--lights a gasper*--an' takes\nmy bloomin' time about it.  You seen them yellow curs there by\nLazarus' tomb?  Well, they come for me, yappin' an' snarlin' to\nbeat 'ell.  I'm pickin' up stones to break their 'eads with--good\nstones ain't such easy findin' in the dark, an' every time I\nstoops 'alf a dozen curs makes a rush for me--when what d'you\nsuppose?  That bloomin' Harab passenger o' mine vaults over into\nmy seat, an' afore I could say ''ell's bells' 'e's off.  I'd left\nthe engine runnin'.  By the luck o' the Lord I 'angs on, an'\nscrambles in--back seat. [*Anglice--canteen cigarette.]\n\n\"I thought at first I'd reach over an' get a half-nelson on 'im\nfrom behind.  But, strike me blind!  I didn't dare!\n\n\"Look where we are now.  Can you see the 'air-pin turn at the\nbottom of this 'ill, with a ditch, beyond it?  Well, we takes\nthat turn in pitch-dark shadow with all four wheels in the air,\nan' you'd 'a thought we was a blinkin' airplane a doin' stunts.\nBut 'e's a hexpert, 'e is, an' we 'olds the road.  From there on\nwe goes in one 'oly murderin' streak to a point about 'alf-way up\nthe 'ill where the Inn of the Good Samaritan stands on top.\nThere we 'as two blow-outs simultaneous, an' thinks I, now, my\nson, I've got you!  I gets out.\n\n\"'You can drive,' I says, 'like Jehu son o' Nimshi what made\nIsrael to sin.  Let's see you make bricks now without no bleedin'\nstraw'!  I knew there weren't no tools under the seat--there\nnever are in this 'ere country if you've left your car out o'\nyour sight for five minutes.  'You take off them two back tires,'\nI says, 'while I sit 'ere an meditate on the ways of Harabs!\nMaybe you're Moses,' I says, 'an know 'ow to work a miracle.'\n\n\"But the only miracle about that bloke's 'is nerve.  'E gets out,\n'an begins to walk straight on up'ill without as much as a by-\nyour-leave.  I shouts to 'im to come back.  But 'e walks on.  So\nI picks up a stone off the pile I was sittin' on, an' I plugs 'im\ngood--'its 'im fair between the shoulder-blades.  You'd think, if\n'e was a Harab, that'ud bring 'im to 'is senses, wouldn't you?\nBut what d'you suppose the blighter did?\n\n\"Did you notice my left eye when you got in the car?  'E turns\nback, an' thinks I, 'e's goin' to knife me.  But that sport could\nuse 'is fists, an' believe me, 'e done it!  I can use 'em a bit\nmyself, an' I starts in to knock 'is block off, but 'e puts it\nall over me--weight, reach an' science.  Mind you, science!\nFirst Arab ever I see what 'ad science;  an' I don't more than\n'alf believe it now!\n\n\"Got to 'and it to 'im.  'E was merciful.

It was full moonlight, an' you could see for miles.\nAfter about fifteen minutes, me still meditatin' murder an'\nconsiderin' my thirst I seen 'em fetch a camel out o' the khan at\nthe Inn o' the Good Samaritan;  an' next thing you know, 'e's out\no' sight.  Thinks I, that's the last of 'im, an' good riddance!\nBut not a bit of it!\n\n\"The men what fetched the camel for 'im comes down to me an' says\nthe sheikh 'as left word I'm to be fed an' looked after.  They\nfixes me up at the inn with a cot an' blankets an' a supper o'\nsorts, an' I lies awake listenin' to 'em talkin' Arabic,\nunderstandin' maybe one word out of six or seven.  From what I\ncan make o' their conjecturin', they think 'e ain't no sheikh at\nall, but a bloomin' British officer in disguise!\n\n\"Soon as morning comes I jump a passing commissariat lorry.  As\nsoon as I gets to Jerusalem I reports that sheikh for arson,\ntheft, felo de se, busting a gov'ment car, usin' 'is fists when\nby right 'e should ha' knifed me, an' every other crime I could\nthink of.  An' all I gets is laughed at!  What d'you make of it?\nThink 'e was a Harab?\"\n\nI wondered whether he was Jimgrim, but did not say so.  Grim had\nnot appeared to me like a man who would use his fists at all\nreadily;  but he was such an unusual individual that it was\nuseless trying to outline what he might or might not do.  It was\nalso quite likely that the chauffeur had omitted mention of, say,\nnine-tenths of the provocation he gave his passenger.  What\ninterested me most was the thought that, if that really was\nJimgrim, he must have been in a prodigious hurry about something;\nand that most likely meant excitement, if not danger across the\nDead Sea.\n\nWe caught sight of the Dead Sea presently, bowling past the Inn\nof the Good Samaritan and beginning to descend into the valley,\ntwelve hundred feet below sea level, that separates Palestine\nfrom Moab.  The moon shone full on the water, and it looked more\nwan and wild than an illustration out of Dante's Inferno.  There\nwas no doubt how the legends sprang up about birds falling dead\nas they flew across it.  It was difficult to believe that\nanything could be there and not die.  It was a vision of the land\nof death made beautiful.\n\nBut the one-eyed Arab on the rear seat began to sing.  To him\nthat view meant \"home, sweet home.\"  His song was all about his\nvillage and how he loved it--what a pearl it was--how sweeter\nthan all cities.\n\n\"'Ark at 'im!\" The driver stopped the car to fill his pipe.\n\"You'd think 'e lived in 'eaven!  I've fought over every hinch o'\nthis perishin' country, an' tyke it from me, guv'nor, there ain't\na village in it but what's composed of 'ovels wi' thatched roofs,\nan' 'eaps o' dung so you can't walk between 'em!  Any one as\nwants my share o' Palestine can 'ave it!\"\n\nWe bumped on again down a road so lonely that it would have felt\ngood to see a wild beast, or an armed man lurking in wait for us.\nBut the British had accomplished the impossible:  They had so\nlaid the fear of law along those roads that, though there might\nbe murders to the right and left of them, the passer-by who kept\nto the road was safe, for the first time since the Romans now and\nthen imposed a temporary peace.\n\nAt last, like two yellow streams glistening in moonlight, the\nroad forked--one way toward Jericho.  The other way appeared\nto run more or less parallel with the Dead Sea.  At that point\nthe one-eyed Arab left off singing at last and clutched the\ndriver's shoulder.\n\n\"All right!  All right!\" he answered impatiently, and stopped.\n\"Out you get, then!\"\n\nHe did not expect the tip I gave him.  He seemed to think it\nplaced him under obligation to wait there and talk for a few\nminutes.  But my one-eyed guide waved him away disgustedly with\nthe hand that did not hold my bag, and we stood in the road\nwatching until he vanished up-hill out of sight.  Then the guide\nplucked my sleeve and I followed him along the righthand road.\nWe walked half a mile as fast as he could set foot to the ground.\n\nAt last we reached a pretense of a village--a little cluster of\nhalf-a-dozen thatched stone huts enclosed within one fence of\nthorn and cactus.  Everything showed up as clearly in the\nmoonlight as if painted with phosphorus.  The heavy shadows only\nmade the high lights seem more luminous.  A man and two donkeys\nwere waiting for us outside the thorn hedge.  The man made no\nremark.  My guide and I mounted and rode on.\n\nPresently we turned down a track toward the Dead Sea, riding\namong huge shadows cast by the hills on our right hand.  The\nlittle jackals they call foxes crossed our path at intervals.\nOwls the size of a robin, only vastly fluffier, screamed from the\nrocks as we passed them.  Otherwise, it was like a soul's last\njourney, eerie, lonely and awful, down toward River Styx.\n\nLong before we caught sight of the water again, through a ragged\ngap between high limestone rocks, I could smell a village.  The\nguide approached it cautiously, stopping every minute or so to\nlisten.  When we came on it at last it was down below us in\nabysmal darkness, one light shining through a window two feet\nsquare in proof we were not hesitating on the verge of the\ninfinite pit.\n\nThe donkeys knew the way.  They trod daintily, like little\nladies, along a circling track that goats made and men had\ncertainly done nothing to improve.  We made an almost complete\nellipse around and down, and rode at last over dry dung at the\nbottom, into which the donkeys' feet sank as into a three-pile\ncarpet.  You could see the stars overhead, but nothing, where we\nwere, except that window and a shaft of yellow light with\nhundreds of moths dazzled in it.\n\nWe must have made some noise in spite of the donkeys' vetvet\nfoot-fall.  As we crossed the shaft of light a door opened within\nsix feet of the window.  A man in Arab deshabille with a red\ntarboosh awry, thrust out his head and drew it in again quickly.\n\n\"Is that the American?\" he asked.  He held the door so that he\ncould slam it in our faces if required.\n\nThe guide made no answer.  I gave my name.  The man opened the\ndoor wider.\n\n\"Lailtak sa'idi, effendi!  Hishkur Allah!  Come in, mister!\"  The\nguide led the donkeys away to some invisible place.  I crossed\nthe threshold, my host holding his tin lantern carefully to show\nthe two steps leading down to a flag-stone floor.  He bolted the\ndoor the moment I was inside.  He seemed in a great state of\nexcitement, and afraid to make any noise.  Even when he shot the\nbolt he did it silently.\n\nIt was a square room, moderately clean, furnished only with a\ntable and two chairs.  There were other rooms leading off it, but\nthe stone partitions did not reach as high as the thatch and I\ncould hear rustling, and some one snoring.  I sat on one of the\nchairs at his invitation, and rather hoped for supper, having had\nnone.  But supper was not in his mind;  it seemed he had too much\nelse to worry him.  He looked like a man who worried easily, and\nlikely enough with good reason, for his long nose and narrow eyes\ndid not suggest honesty.\n\n\"There was to be an escort to meet me here,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, yes.  Thank God, mister, you have come at last.  If you had\nonly come at sunset!  Ali has gone to bring them now.\"\n\n\"Who is Ali?\"\n\n\"He with one eye.  He who brought you.  Your escort came at\nsunset.  Because I am Christian they would not listen to me or\nwait for you in my house.  There are twenty of them, led by\nAnazeh, who is a bad rascal.  They have gone to raid the\nvillages.  There has been trouble.  I have heard two shots fired.\nNow they will come back to my house, and if the Sikh patrol is\nafter them they will be caught here, and I shall be accused of\nhelping them.  May the fires of their lying Prophet's Eblis\nburn Anazeh and his men forever and ever, Amen!  May God curse\ntheir religion!\"\n\nThat was a nice state of affairs.  I did not want to be caught\nthere by a lot of truculent Sikhs under one of those jocularly\nincredulous young British subalterns that Sikhs adore.  In the\nfirst place, I had nothing whatever in writing to prove my\ninnocence.  The least that was likely to happen would be an\nignominious return to Jerusalem, after a night in a guard-house,\nshould there be a guard-house;  failing that, a night in the open\nwithin easy reach of Sikh's bayonets.  In Jerusalem, no doubt,\nSir Louis would order me released immediately.  But it began to\nlook as if the whole mystery after all was nothing but a well-\nstaged decoy, using me for bait.  Not even tadpoles enjoy being\nused for live-bait without being consulted first.  I began to\nspear about for remedies.\n\n\"If you're an honest man,\" I said, \"you'd better simply deny all\nconnection with the raid.\"\n\n\"Hah?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  He did not look like an honest man.\nHe wasn't one.  He knew it.  He retorted gloomily:\n\n\"Anazeh's scoundrels will have raided sheep, and perhaps cattle.\nIf any one has resisted them, there will be wailing widows crying\nout for vengeance.  They will put the sheep and cattle in their\nboats in which they came over the sea this afternoon.  The boats\nwill be found by the Sikhs, hauled up on the sand-pit just below\nmy house, with my motor-boat beside them.  I am ruined!\"\n\nWell, my own predicament was better than that.  Nobody was likely\nto accuse me of having stolen sheep.  But I could not feel sorry\nfor my host, because he was so sorry for himself.  He was one of\nthose unfortunates who carry the conviction of their own guilt in\ntheir faces.  I gave up all idea of relying on him in case the\nSikhs should come.\n\nMy next idea was to ask for the loan of one of the donkeys, and\nto start back toward Jerusalem.  But I had not more than thought\nof it when men's footsteps pattered on the yard dung, and an\nindubitable rifle-butt beat on the wooden door.\n\n\"For God's sake!\" hissed the owner of the place.  He ran to the\ndoor to open it as the thumping grew louder.  As he drew the bolt\nsomebody kicked the door open, sending him reeling backwards.\nFor a second I thought the Sikhs had come.\n\nBut he was nothing like a Sikh who strode in, with a dozen\nruffians at his tail and one-eyed Ali bringing up the rear.  He\nwas one of the finest-looking Arabs I had ever seen, although\nconsiderably past fifty and wrinkled so that his face was a net-\nwork of fine lines, out of which his big, dark eyes shone with\nunaged intelligence.  He was magnificently dressed, perhaps in\norder to do me honour.  Except for the fact that he carried a\nmodern military rifle on his elbow, in place of a shepherd's\ncrook or a spear, he looked like one of those historic worthies\nwho stalk through the pages of the Pentateuch.  The dignity and\ncharm with which he bowed to me were inimitable--unconveyable.\nBut he turned on my Christian host like a prophet of old\nrebuking blasphemy.\n\nArabic when the right man uses it sounds like tooth-for-a-tooth\nlaw being laid down.  Hebrew is all music and soft vowels;\nArabic all guttural consonants.  The Sheikh Anazeh (there was no\ndoubt of his identity;  they all kept calling him by name)\nfulminated.  The other bleated at him.  I learned his name at\nlast.  Ali of the one eye pressed forward, took him by the\nsleeve, and called him Ahmed.  Ali seemed to be adding persuasion\nto Anazeh's threats.  Whatever it was they were driving at, Ahmed\nbegan to look like yielding.  So, as I could not untangle more\nthan one brief sentence at a time from all those galloping\narguments, I pulled Ahmed away into a corner.\n\n\"What do they all want?\" I asked him.  \"Tell me in ten words.\"\nBut he was not a brief man.\n\n\"They say the Sikhs are after them.  They have put the stolen\nsheep into their boats, as I told you they would, mister.  Now\nthey order me to tow them with my motor-boat.  But it cannot be\ndone, mister, it cannot be done!  I tell them there is government\nlaunch near Jericho that the Sikh patrol can use to overtake us.\nI have a swift boat, but if I take in tow two other loaded boats\nwe shall be caught;  and then who will save everything I have\nfrom confiscation?\"\n\n\"How close are the Sikhs?\" I asked.\n\n\"God knows, mister!  They can come fast.  Unless I consent to let\nthem use my boat, Anazeh will order his men to kill me, and then\nthey will take the boat in any case!  There is only one thing:\nthey must leave the sheep behind and all crowd into my boat, but\nI cannot persuade them!\"\n\nAt that moment another of Anazeh's party burst in through the\ndoor.  He evidently bore bad news.  Catching sight of me, he\nlowered his voice to a whisper, and, whatever he said, Anazeh\nnodded gravely.  Then the old sheikh gave an order, and four of\nhis men came without further ado to seize Ahmed.\n\n\"Bear me witness!\" the wretched man called back to me as they\ndragged him off.  \"I go under protest--most unwillingly!\"\n\nSomebody struck him with a butt-end.  A woman's head appeared\nover the top of the partition, and began to jabber noisily.\nSeveral of Anazeh's men hurled jests:  the highest compliment\nthey paid her was to call her Um-Kulsum, the mother of sin.\nAnazeh beckoned to me.  He did not seem to doubt for an instant\nthat I would follow him.\n\nI was in no mind to wait there and be arrested by the Sikh\npatrol.  I wondered whether they were coming in open order,\ncombing the countryside, or heading all together straight for a\nknown objective;  and whether in either case I could give them\nthe slip and head back toward Jerusalem.  In that minute I\nrecalled Grim's advice:\n\n\"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you and you'll be all\nright.  You needn't be afraid to trust him.\"\n\nThat settled it.  I did not suppose for a minute that Grim had\ncontemplated any such contingency as this;  but he had\nvolunteered the advice, so the consequences would be his affair.\nI followed Anazeh into outer darkness, and one of his men pulled\nthe door to after me.\n\nThere was something very like a panic down by the waterside,\nthree hundred yards away from the house.  It needed all Anazeh's\nauthority to straighten matters out.  There were divided\ncounsels;  and the raiders were working at a disadvantage in\ntotal darkness;  the shadow of the hills fell just beyond the\nstern of the boats as they lay with their bows ashore.\n\nThey had already forced Ahmed into his own motor-boat, where he\nwas struggling vainly to crank a cold engine.  Some of the others\nwere trying to push off a boat full of bleating sheep.  One man\nwas carrying a fat sheep in his arms toward the motor-boat,\nsplashing knee-deep in the water and shouting advice to everybody\nelse, and in the end that was the only piece of plunder they got\naway with.  Suddenly one man, who had been left behind to keep a\nlook-out, came leaping like a ghost among the shadows, shouting\nthe one word \"askeri!\" (Soldiers!)  He jumped straight into the\nmotor-boat.  Anazeh bullied all the rest in after him.  I climbed\nin over the bow.  By that time you could not have crowded in one\nmore passenger with the aid of a battering ram.\n\n\"Yalla!\" barked Anazeh.  But the engine would not start.  Blood-\ncurdling threats were hurled at the unhappy Ahmed.  Some e of the\nmen got into the water and began to shove off, as if the engine\ncould be encouraged by collaboration.\n\nI was just as keen to escape as any one.  I could not imagine a\nSikh or subaltern stupid enough to believe me innocent.  It was a\nmilitary government.  Soldiers have a drum-head method of leaving\nnothing to discuss except where the corpse is to be buried.\n\nI forced my way aft--got some gasoline out of the tank into a tin\ncup--thrust aside Ahmed and two other men--and primed the engine\nliberally.  The engine coughed next time they moved the wheel,\nand in thirty seconds more we had it going.  Ahmed came in for a\nvolley of mockery for having to be shown the way to start his\nengine;  but from the sour way he looked at me I was nearly sure\nhe had stalled deliberately.\n\nWe backed away from shore, and Anazeh steered the boat's nose\neastward.  Then somebody at the reversing lever threw it forward\ntoo suddenly, and the still chilled engine stopped.  It took\nabout another minute to restart it.  We were just beginning to\ngain speed when some one shouted.  All eyes turned toward the\nshore, the overloaded boat rocking dangerously as the crowd bent\ntheir bodies all in one direction together.\n\nDown near the shore-line an electric torch flashed on the\nuniforms of half-a-dozen Sikhs, and we could hear an unmistakably\nBritish voice shouting an order.\n\nWe were out in the moonlight now, a perfect target.  Bullets\nchanced at us could hardly fail to hit somebody.  Two or three\nwell-placed shots might sink us.  But Anazeh had presence of\nmind.  He changed helm, so as to present us end-on to the shore.\nLow in the water though the boat was, we were beginning to make\ngood headway.\n\nThe Sikhs lost no time.  Shots began to whizz overhead and to\nsplash the water around us.  But the boat was painted gray;  as\nwe increased the distance we must have looked like a moving patch\nof darker water with a puzzling wake behind us.  The sea was\nstill.  The stars were reflected in it in unsteady dots and\nstreaks.  The moon cast a silver patch of light that shimmered,\nand confused the eye.  Sikhs are not by any means all marksmen.\nAt any rate, the shots all missed.  Though some of our party,\nAnazeh included, returned the fire, none boasted of having hit\nany one.  And an Arab boasts at the least excuse.\n\nIn a few minutes we were out of range and, since there was no\npursuing launch in sight, could afford to jeer at the Sikhs in\nchorus.  There were things said about their habits and their\nancestry that it is to be hoped they did not hear, or at any rate\nunderstand, for the sake of any Arab prisoners they might take in\nfuture.  It always struck me as a fool game to mock your enemy.\nIf you fall in his power at any time he would be almost more than\nhuman if he did not remember it.  It seemed to me unlikely that\nthose Sikhs would forget to avenge the Arab compliments that must\nhave sizzled in ears across that star-lit sea.  After that the\nonly immediate danger was from the wind that sometimes blows down\nin sudden gusts from between the mountain-tops.  It would have\nneeded only half a sea to swamp us.  But the Dead Sea was living\nup to its reputation, quiet, inert, like a mercury mirror for the\nstars--a brooding place of silence.\n\nThe Arabs' spirits rose as we chugged toward their savage hills.\nThey began to sing glorious songs about women and mares and\ncamels.  Presently Anazeh improvised an epic about the night's\nraid, abortive though it had been.  He left out all the\ndisappointing part.  He sang first of the three shore-dwelling\nfools whose boats they had stolen.  Then of the baffled rage of\nthose same fools when they should learn their property was lost\nforever.  Presently, as he warmed to the spirit of the thing, he\nsang about the wails of the frightened villagers from whom they\nhad plundered sheep and goats;  and of the skill and\nresourcefulness with which the party had escaped pursuit under\nhis leadership, Allah favoring, \"and blessed be His Prophet!\"\n\nLast, he sang about me, the honoured stranger, for whom they had\ndared everything and conquered, and whom they were taking to El-\nKerak.  He described me as a prince from a far country, the son\nof a hundred kings.\n\nIt was a good song.  I got Ahmed to translate it to me\nafterwards.  But I suspect that Ahmed toned it down in deference\nto what he may have thought might be my modesty and moralistic\nscruples.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\n\"I am willing to use all means--all methods.\"\n\n\nAhmed knew the Dead Sea.  He knew its moods and a few of its\ntricks, so he was suitably scared.  He was more of raid of the\ntreacherous sea than of his captors.  They weren't treacherous in\nthe least.  They were frankly disobedient of any law except their\nown;  respectful of nothing but bullets, brains and their own\ninterpretation of the Will of Allah.  They showed sublime\nindifference to danger that always comes of ignorance.  Ahmed was\nfor running straight across to cut the voyage short, because of\nthe wind that sometimes blows from the south at dawn.  He said it\nmight kick up a sea that would roll us over, for the weight of\nthe Dead Sea waves in a blow is prodigious.\n\nThey overruled his protest with loud-lunged unanimity and lots of\nabuse.  Anazeh continued to steer a diagonal course for a notch\nin the Moab Hills that look, until you get quite close to them,\nas if they rose sheer out of the sea.  The old chief was pretty\namateurish at the helm, whatever his other attainments.  Our wake\nwas like a drunkard's.\n\nWhat with the danger in that overcrowded boat, and the manifestly\ncompromising fact that I had now become one of a gang who boasted\nof the murder they had done that night, I did some speculation\nthat seems ridiculous now, at this distance, after a lapse of\ntime.  It occurred to me that Grim might be disguised as a member\nof Anazeh's party.  As far as possible in the dark I thoroughly\nscrutinized each individual.  It is easy to laugh about it now,\nbut I actually made my way to Anazeh's side and tried to discover\nwhether the old Sheikh's wrinkles and gray-shot beard were not a\nvery skillfully done make-up.  At any rate, I got from that\nabsurd investigation the sure knowledge that Grim was not in the\nboat with us.\n\nI could not talk with Anazeh very well, because when he tried to\nunderstand my amateurish Arabic and to modify his flow of stately\nspeech to meet my needs, he always put his head down, and the\nhelm with it.  It seemed wisest to let him do one unaccustomed\nthing at a time.  I did not care to try to talk with any of his\nmen, because that might possibly have been a breach of etiquette.\nArab jealousy is about as quick as fulminate of mercury:  as\nunreasonable, from a western viewpoint, as a love-sick woman's.\n\nBut there did not seem any objection to talking with Ahmed.  He\nwas at least in theory my co-religionist, and not a person any\nMoslem in that boat was likely to be jealous of.  He jumped\nat the notion of making friends with me.  He made no secret of\nthe reason.\n\n\"You are safe, effendi.  They will neither rob you, nor kill you,\nnor let you get killed.  You are their guest.  But as for me,\nthey would cut my throat as readily as that sheep's, more\nespecially since they have discovered that you know how to start\nthe engine.  My best chance was to make them believe that the\nengine is difficult to understand.  Because of your knowledge\nthey now feel independent of me.  So I must yield to them in\neverything.  And if they force me to swear on a Bible, and on my\nfather's honour, and in the name of God, that I will not give\nevidence against them, I shall have to swear.\"\n\n\"An oath given under compulsion--\" I began.  But he laughed\ncynically.\n\n\"Ah!  You do not know this land--these folk, effendi.  If I were\nto break such an oath as that, they would burn my house, steal my\ncattle, ravish my wife, and hunt me to the death.  If I ran away\nto America, Arabs in Chicago and New York would continue the\nhunt.  This is a land where an oath is binding, unless you are\nthe stronger.  I am weak--an unimportant person.\"\n\n\"What is your business?\" I asked.\n\n\"There is no business for a man like me.  The regulations forbid\ncommerce in the only goods for which there is a real demand\namong Bedouins.\"\n\n\"So you're a smuggler, eh?\"\n\nHe laughed, between pride and caution, and changed the subject.\n\n\"I shall do what they order me, effendi.  I think they will keep\nmy boat over there to bring you back again.  But when I get back\nthe Sikhs will arrest me.  So I ask you to bear me witness that I\nwas compelled by threats and force to go with these people.  In\nthat way, with a little ingenuity--that is to say, the ingenious\nuse of piastras--perhaps I can contrive to get out of the\ndifficulty without being punished by both Arabs and British.\"\n\nI promised to tell no more than I had seen and heard.  On the\nstrength of that we became as fast friends as suspicion\npermitted.  We trusted each other, because we more or less had\nto, like a couple of thieves \"on the lam.\"  It suited me.  He was\na very good interpreter and slavishly anxious to please.  But I\nlived to regret it later.  When my evidence had cleared him of\ncollusion in the raid, he chose on the strength of that to claim\nme as his friend for life.  He turned up in the United States and\ntried to live on his wits.  I had to pay a lawyer to defend him\nin Federal Court.  He writes me piously pathetic letters from\nLeavenworth Penitentiary.  And when he gets out I suppose I\nshall have to befriend him again.  However, at the moment, he\nwas useful.\n\nIt was just dawn when old Anazeh ran the launch into a cove\nbetween high rocks.  Ahmed let out a shriek of anguish at the\nviolence done the hull.  They pitched the sheep overboard to\nwade ashore without remembering to untie its legs;  it was\nalmost drowned before it occurred to any one to rescue it.\nPerhaps it was dead.  I don't know.  Anyhow, one fellow prayed\nin a hurry while his companion cut the sheep's throat to make\nit lawful meat.\n\n\"God is good,\" old Anazeh remarked to me, \"and blessed be His\nProphet, who forbade us faithful, even though we hunger, to\ndefile ourselves with the flesh of creatures whose blood did not\nflow from the knife of the slayer.\"\n\nAfter that they all prayed, going first into the oily-feeling,\nasphaltic water for the ceremonial washing.  They were quite\nparticular about it.  Then they spread prayer-mats, facing Mecca.\nEvery single cut-throat had brought along his prayer-mat, and had\ntreasured it as carefully as his rifle.\n\nAhmed and I sat on a rock and watched them.  Ahmed pretended he\nwanted to pray, too.  To impress me, he said he was a very devout\nChristian and that nothing should prevent the practice of his\nreligion.  But he was very quick to take my advice not to start\nanything that might bring on a breach of the peace.  Old Anazeh's\nshort preliminary sermon to his followers, about the need of\nalways keeping God in mind, was not addressed to us.\n\nPrayers finished, they proceeded to cut up and cook the sheep.\nAhmed and I subdued the voice of conscience without noticeable\neffort and ate our share of the stolen goods.  Ahmed said that,\nseeing how little was left for him when the rest had all been\nserved, he sinned only in small degree, but that my share, as an\nhonoured guest, was huge, and the sin proportionate.  So I gave\nhim some of my meat, and he ate it, and we were equally sinful--\none more bond cementing an \"eternal friendship!\"\n\nWe had hardly finished eating when an Arab on a gray horse came\nriding furiously down a ravine that looked like a dry water-\ncourse.  He was brought up all-standing fifty yards away.  Every\nman in the party leveled a rifle at him.  Anazeh beckoned me to\ncome and get behind him for protection.  He was very angry when I\nrefused.  He cursed the language and religion of whatever fool\nhad taught me manners in a land where pigs are lawful food.\nHowever, after they had all had a good look at the horseman they\nlet him draw near, and there followed a noisy conference, the man\non the horse calling on Allah repeatedly with emphasis, and\nAnazeh and his followers all doing the same thing, but from an\nopposing viewpoint.  I persuaded Ahmed to go up close and listen.\n\n\"The man is from El-Kerak,\" he said presently, while they all\nstill fought with words, using tremendous oaths by way of\nartillery.  \"A council of the tribes has been summoned, to meet\nat El-Kerak, but each sheikh is only to take two men with him,\nbecause of the risk of fighting among themselves.  Anazeh says\nthere can be no proper council without his being present, and\nthat he will attend the council;  but as for taking only two men,\nhe has pledged his word to escort you with twenty men to El-\nKerak.  He swears that he will carry out that pledge, even should\nhe have to fight the whole way there and back again!\"\n\nAnazeh suddenly cut short the war of words.  His gesture\nsuggested that of Joshua who made the sun stand still.  He tossed\na curt order to one of his men, who went off at a run toward a\nvillage, whose morning smoke rose blue over a spur of the range a\nmile away.  Then Anazeh sat down to await events, and took no\nmore notice of the horseman's arguments.  That did not worry the\nhorseman much.  He kept on arguing.  Every few minutes one of\nAnazeh's men would go to him and repeat some tid-bit, as if the\nold sheikh had not heard it;  but all he got for his pains was a\ngesture of contemptuous dismissal.\n\nAhmed kept growing more and more uncomfortable all the time.  He\nhad attended to his boat, making it properly fast and covering\nthe engine, under the eyes of four men who were at pains to see\nthat he did not crank up and desert.  Now he was back beside me,\ntrying to bolster up his own courage by making me afraid.\n\n\"They have determined to take me along with them to prevent me\nfrom escaping,\" he complained.  \"That man on the horse is saying\nthat if more men go with Anazeh than you and two others, there\nwill certainly be fighting.  And Anazeh answers, he has pledged\nhis word.  Can you not say something to persuade Anazeh?\"\n\nI would rather have tried to persuade a tiger.  Short of knocking\nthe old raider on the head and standing off his twenty ruffians,\nI could not imagine a way of turning him from his set purpose.\nAnd at that, I had not a weapon of any kind.  I was the goods,\nand the game old sportsman intended to deliver me, right side up,\nperhaps, but all in one piece and to the proper consignee.\n\n\n\"I don't see anything to worry about,\" said I.\n\n\"Wait till you hear the bullets!\" Ahmed answered.  Nevertheless,\nbullets or no bullets, I did not see what I could do about it.\nAgain I remembered Grim's advice:  \"Do what the leader of the\nescort tells you.\"  I had begun to feel sorry for Ahmed in spite\nof his self-pity, but his fear wasn't contagious and his advice\nwasn't worth listening to.\n\n\"Effendi, you are Anazeh's guest.  He must do as you demand, if\nyou ask in the Name of the Most High.  Tell him, therefore, that\nyou have an urgent business in El-Kudz.  Demand that he send you\nback, with me, in my boat!\"\n\n\"You are not his guest.  He would simply shoot you and destroy\nthe boat,\" I answered.\n\nIt was not more than half-an-hour before I saw horses coming in\nour direction from the village.  At sight of them the man on the\ngray horse lost heart.  With a final burst of eloquence, in which\nhe spread his breast to heaven and shook both fists in witness\nthat he was absolved and no blood-guilt could rest on his head,\nhe rode away at top speed straight up the ravine down which he\noriginally came.\n\nThe horses proved to be a very mixed lot--some good, some very\nbad, and some indifferent.  But again they treated me as honoured\nguest and provided me a mare with four sound legs and nothing\nmuch the matter except vice.  She came at me with open teeth\nwhen I tried to mount, but four men held her and I climbed\naboard, somehow or other.  As a horseman, I am a pretty good\nsack of potatoes.\n\nThat was the worst saddle I ever sat in--and Anazeh's second-\nbest!  The stirrups swung amidships, so to speak, and whenever\nyou tried to rest your weight on them for a moment they described\nan arc toward the rear.  Moreover, you could not sit well back on\nthe saddle to balance matters, because of the high cantle.  The\nresult, whether you did with stirrups or without them, was\ntorture, for anybody but an Arab, who has notions of comfort all\nhis own.\n\nThey put Ahmed on a wall-eyed scrub that looked unfit to walk,\nbut proved well able to gallop under his light weight.  One of\nAnazeh's men took my bag, with a nod to reassure me, and without\na word we were off full-pelt, Anazeh leading with four stalwarts\nwho looked almost as hard-bitten as himself, six men crowding me\nclosely, and the remainder bringing up the rear.\n\nThat is the Arab way of doing things--rush and riot to begin\nwith.  The steepness of the stony ravine we rode up soon reduced\nthe horses to a walk, after which there was a good deal of\nattention to rifle-bolts, and a settling down to the more serious\naspects of the adventure.  The escort began to look sullenly\nferocious, as only Arabs can.\n\nThere was a time, during the Turkish regime before the War, when\nCook's Agency took tourists in parties to El-Kerak, and all the\nprotection necessary was a handful of Turkish soldiers, whose\nthief employment on the trip was to gather fuel and pitch tents.\nSome one paid the Arabs to let tourists alone, and they normally\ndid.  But the War changed all that.  A post-Armistice stranger in\n1920, with leather boots, was fair quarry for whoever had rifle\nor knife.\n\nWe passed by a village or two, tucked into folds in the hills and\npolluting the blue sky with a smell of ageing dung, but nothing\nseemed disposed to happen.  A few men stood behind stone walls\nand stared at us sullenly.  The women looked up from their\ngrindstones at the doors, covered their faces for convention's\nsake, and uncovered them again at once for curiosity.  There was\nnothing you could call a road between the villages, only a rocky\ncattle-track that seemed to take the longest possible way between\ntwo points;  and nobody seemed to own it, or to be there to\nchallenge our right of way.\n\nBut suddenly, after we had passed the third village and were\nwalking the horses up a shoulder of a steep hill-top, three shots\ncracked out from in front of us to left and right.  Nobody fell,\nbut if ever there was instantaneous response it happened then.\nAnazeh and his four galloped forward up-hill, firing as they rode\nfor the cover of a breast-high ridge.  One man on the off-side\ntipped me out of the saddle, so suddenly that I had no chance to\nprevent him;  another caught me, and two others flung me into a\nhole behind a stone.  I heard the rear-guard scatter and run.\nTwo men pitched Ahmed down on top of me, for he was valuable,\nseeing he could run an engine;  and thirty seconds later I peered\nout around the rock to get a glimpse of what was happening.\n\nThere was not a man in sight.  I could see some of the horses\nstanding under cover.  The firing was so rapid that it sounded\nalmost like machine-gun practice.  A hairy arm reached out and\npushed my head back, and after that, whenever I made the least\nmovement, a man who was sniping from behind the sheltering rock\nswore furiously, and threatened to brain me with his butt-end.\nBeyond all doubt they regarded me as perishable freight;  so I\nhardly saw any of the fighting.\n\nJudging by the sound, I should say they fought their way up-hill\nin skirmish order, and when they got to the top the enemy--\nwhoever they were--took to flight.  But that is guesswork.  There\nwere two casualties on our side.  One man shot through the arm,\nwhich did not matter much;  he was well able to lie about what\nhad happened and to boast of how many men he had slain before the\nbullet hit him.  The other was wounded pretty seriously in the\njaw.  They came to me for first aid, taking it for granted that I\nknew something about surgery.  I don't.  I had a bad time\nbandaging both of them, using two of my handkerchiefs and strips\nfrom the protesting Ahmed's shirt.  However, I enjoyed it more\nthan they did.\n\nWhen Anazeh shouted at last and we all rode to the hilltop there\nwas a dead man lying there, stripped naked, with his throat cut\nacross from ear to ear.  One of our men was wiping a long knife\nby stabbing it into the dirt.  There was also a led horse added\nto the escort.  Anazeh looked very cool and dignified;  he had an\nextra rifle now, slung by a strap across his shoulders.  He was\nexamining a bandolier that had blood on it.\n\nWe rode on at once, and for the next hour Ahmed was kept busy\ninterpreting to me the lies invented by every member of the\nescort for my especial benefit.  If they were true, each man had\nslain his dozen;  but nobody would say who the opposing faction\nwere.  When I put that question they all dried up and nobody\nwould speak again for several minutes.\n\nIt turned out afterward that there had been a sort of armistice\nproclaimed, and all the local chiefs had undertaken to observe it\nand cease from blood-feuds for three days, provided that each\nchief should prove peaceful intention by bringing with him only\ntwo men.  Three men in a party, and not more than three, had\nright of way.  The engagement may have been a simple protest\nagainst breach of the terms of the armistice, but I suspect there\nwas more than that in it.\n\nAt any rate, we were not attacked again on the road, although there\nwere men who showed themselves now and then on inaccessible-looking\ncrags, who eyed us suspiciously and made no answer to the shouted\nchallenge of Anazeh's men.  When the track passed over a spur, or\nswung round the shoulder of a cliff, we could sometimes catch\nsight of other parties--always, though of three, before and behind\nus, proceeding in the same direction.\n\nWe sighted the stone walls of El-Kerak at about midafternoon, and\nrode up to the place through a savage gorge that must have been\nimpregnable in the old days of bows and arrows.  It would take a\ndetermined army today to force itself through the wadys and\nwinding water-courses that guard that old citadel of Romans\nand crusaders.\n\nWe approached from the Northwest corner, where a tower stands\nthat they call Burj-ez-Zahir.  There were lions carved on it.  It\nlooked as if the battlements had been magnificent at one time;\nbut whatever the Turks become possessed of always falls into\ndecay, and the Arabs seem no better.\n\nBeside the Burj-ez-Zahir is a tunnel, faced by an unquestionable\nRoman arch.  Outside it there were more than a dozen armed men\nlounging, and a lot of others looked down at us through the\nruined loop-holes of the wall above.  Their leader challenged\nour numbers at once, and refused admission.  Judging by Anazeh's\nmagnificently insolent reply it looked at first as if he\nintended fighting his way in.  But that turned out to be\nonly his diplomatic manner--establishing himself, as it were,\non an eminence from which he could make concessions without\nlosing dignity.\n\nThe arrangement finally agreed to was Anazeh's suggestion, but\nshowed diplomatic genius on both sides.  The old man divided up\nhis party into sets of three, and asserted that every set of\nthree was independent.  There were twenty-two of us all told,\nincluding Ahmed, but he described Ahmed as a prisoner, and\noffered to have him shot if that would simplify matters.\n\nThere was a great deal of windy discussion about Ahmed's fate,\nduring which his face grew the color of raw liver and he joined\nin several times tearfully.  Once he was actually seized and\nhalf-a-dozen of the castle guards aimed at him;  but they\ncompromised finally by letting him go in with hands tied.  Nobody\nreally wanted the responsibility of shooting a man who had\nsmuggled stolen cartridges across the Dead Sea, and might do it\nagain if allowed to live.\n\nWe rode for eighty or a hundred paces through an echoing tunnel\ninto a city of shacks and ruined houses that swarmed with armed\nmen, and it was evident that we were not the only ones who had\nignored the rule about numbers.  Anazeh explained in an aside\nto me that only those would obey that rule who did not dare\nbreak it.\n\n\"Whoever makes laws should be strong enough to enforce them,\" he\nsaid sagely.  \"And whoever obeys such a law is at the mercy of\nthose who break it,\" he added presently, by way of afterthought.\nTo make sure that I understood him he repeated that remark\nthree times.\n\nEvery house had its quota of visitors, who lounged in the\ndoorways and eyed us with mixed insolence and curiosity.  There\nwere coffee-booths all over the place that seemed to have been\nerected for the occasion, where, under awnings made of stick and\nstraw, men sat with rifles on their knees.  Those who had\nprovender to sell for horses were doing a roaring trade--short\nmeasure and high price;  and the noise of grinding was incessant.\nThe women in the back streets were toiling to produce enough to\neat for all that host of notables.\n\nTo have had to hunt for quarters in that town just then would\nhave been no joke.  There was the mosque, of course, where any\nMoslem who finds himself stranded may theoretically go and sleep\non a mat on the floor.  But we rode past the mosque.  It was\nfull.  I would not have liked a contract to crowd one more in\nthere.  Perhaps a New York Subway guard could have managed it.\nThe babel coming through the open door was like the buzzing of\nflies on a garbage heap.\n\nI was trying to sit upright in that abominable saddle and look\ndignified, as became the honoured guest with a twenty-man escort,\nwhen a courteous-looking cut-throat wearing an amber necklace\nworth a wheat-field, forced his way through a crowd and greeted\nAnazeh like a long lost brother.  I examined him narrowly to make\nsure he was not Grim in disguise, but he had two fingers missing,\nand holes in his ears, which decided that question.\n\nAfter he had welcomed me effusively he led us through a rat-run\nmaze of streets to a good-sized house with snub-nosed lions\ncarved on the stone doorposts and a lot of other marks of both\nRoman and crusader.  No part of the walls was less than three\nfeet thick, although the upper story had been rebuilt rather\nrecently on a more economical and much less dignified scale.\nNevertheless, there was a sort of semi-European air about the\nplace, helped out by two casemented projections overhanging the\nnarrow street.\n\nThere was no need to announce ourselves.  The clatter of hoofs\nand shouts to ordinary folk on foot to get out of the way had\ndone that already.  Sheikh ben Nazir opened the door in person.\nHis welcome to me was the sort that comes to mind when you read\nthe Bible story of the prodigal son returning from a far-off\ncountry.  I might have been his blood-relation.  But perhaps I am\nwrong about that;  bloodfeuds among blood-relations are\nnotoriously savage.  He was the host, and I the guest.  Among\ngenuine Arabs that is the most binding relation there is.\n\nHe was no longer in blue serge and patent-leather boots, but\nmagnificent in Arab finery, and he was tricked out in a  puzzling\nsnowy-white head-dress that suggested politics without your\nknowing why.  He had told me, when I met him at the American\nColony, that he had made the pilgrimage to Mecca more than once;\nbut that white linen thing had nothing to do with his being a\nhaji, any more than the expensive rings on the fingers of both\nhands had anything to do with his Arab nationality.\n\nAfter he had flattered and questioned me sufficiently about the\njourney to comply with etiquette I asked him whether Ahmed might\nnot be untied.  The thong cutting the man's wrists. Sheikh hen\nNazir gave the necessary order and it was obeyed at once.  The\nliquid-eyed rascal with the priceless amber necklace then led\naway the escort, Ahmed included, to some place where they could\nstall the horses, and--side-by-side, lest any question of\nprecedence should be involved, Anazeh and I followed ben Nazir\ninto the house.\n\nWe were not the only guests there.  He ushered us into a square\nroom, in which outrageous imported furniture, with gilt and\ntassels on it, stood out like loathsome sores against rugs and\ncushions fit for the great Haroun-al-Raschid's throne room.  Any\ngood museum in the world would have competed to possess the rugs,\nbut the furniture was the sort that France sends eastward in the\nname of \"culture\"--stuff for \"savages\" to sit on and be civilized\nwhile the white man bears the burden and collects the money.\n\nThere were half-a-dozen Arabs reclining on two bastard Louis-\nsomething-or-other settees, who rose to their feet as we entered.\nThere was another man, sitting on a cushion in a corner by\nhimself, who did not get up.  He wore a white head-dress exactly\nlike our host's, and seemed to consider himself somebody very\nimportant indeed.  After one swift searching glance at us he went\ninto a brown study, as if a mere sheikh and a Christian alien\nwere beneath his notice.\n\nWe were introduced first of all to the men who had stood up to\ngreet us, and that ceremony took about five minutes.  The Arab\nbelieves he ought to know all about how you feel physically, and\nexpects you to reciprocate.  When that was over ben Nazir took us\nto the corner and presented, first me, then Anazeh to the\nsolitary man in the white head-dress, who seemed to think himself\ntoo important to trouble about manners.\n\nAnazeh did not quite like my receiving attention first, and he\nliked still less the off-handed way in which the solitary man\nreceived us.  We were told his name was Suliman ben Saoud.  He\nacknowledged my greeting.  He and old Anazeh glared at each\nother, barely moving their heads in what might have been an\nunspoken threat and retort or a nod of natural recognition.\nAnazeh turned on his heel and joined the other guests.\n\nIn some vague way I knew that Saoud was a name to conjure\nwith, although memory refused to place it.  The man's air of\nindifference and apparently unstudied insolence suggested he was\nsome one well used to authority.  Presuming on the one thing that\nI felt quite sure of by that time--my privileged position as a\nguest--I stayed, to try to draw him out.  I tried to open up\nconversation with him with English, French, and finally lame\nArabic.  He took no apparent notice of the French and English,\nbut he smiled sarcastically at my efforts with his own tongue.\nExcept that he moved his lips he made no answer but went on\nclicking the beads of a splendid amber rosary.\n\nBen Nazir, seeming to think that Anazeh's ruffled feelings called\nfor smoothing, crossed the room to engage him in conversation, so\nI was left practically alone with the strange individual.  More\nor less in a spirit of defiance of his claim to such distinction,\nI sat down on a cushion beside him.\n\nHe was a peculiar-looking man.  The lower part of his cheek--that\nside on which I sat--was sunk in, as if he had no teeth there.\nThe effect was to give his whole face a twisted appearance.  The\ngreater part of his head, of course, was concealed by the flowing\nwhite kaffiyi, but his skin was considerably darker than that of\nthe   Palestine Arab.  He had no eyebrows at all, having shaved\nthem off--for a vow I supposed.  Instead of making him look\ncomical, as you might expect, it gave him a very sinister\nappearance, which was increased by his generally surly attitude.\n\nOnce again, as when I had entered the room, he turned his head to\ngive me one swift, minutely searching glance, and then turned his\neyes away as if he had no further interest.  They were quite\nextraordinary eyes, brimful of alert intelligence;  and whereas\nfrom his general appearance I should have set him down at\nsomewhere between forty and fifty, his eyes suggested youth, or\nelse that keen, unpeaceful spirit that never ages.\n\nI tried him again in Arabic, but he answered without looking at\nme, in a dialect I had never heard before.  So I offered him a\ngold-tipped cigarette, that being a universal language.  He\nwaived the offer aside with something between astonishment and\ndisdain.  He had lean, long-fingered hands, entirely unlike\nthose of the desert fraternity, who live too hard and fight\ntoo frequently to have soft, uncalloused skin and unbroken\nfinger-nails.\n\nHe did not exactly fascinate me.  His self-containment was\nannoying.  It seemed intended to convey an intellectual and moral\nimportance that I was not disposed to concede without knowing\nmore about him.  I suppose an Arab feels the same sensation when\na Westerner lords it over him on highly moral grounds.  At any\nrate, something or other in the way of pique urged me to stir him\nout of his self-complacency, just as one feels urged to prod a\nbull-frog to watch him jump.\n\nHe seemed to understand my remarks, for he took no trouble to\nhide his amusement at my efforts with the language.  But he\nonly answered in monosyllables, and I could not understand\nthose.  So after about five minutes I gave it up, and crossed\nthe room to ben Nazir, who seized the opportunity to show me\nmy sleeping-quarters.\n\nIt proved to be a room like a monastery cell, up one flight of\nstone steps, with two other rooms of about the same size on\neither side of it.  At the end of the passage was a very heavy\nwooden door, with an iron lock and an enormous keyhole, which I\nsuppose shut off the harem from the rest of the house;  but as I\nnever trespassed beyond it I don't know.  I only do know that a\nwoman's eye was watching me through that key-hole, and ben Nazir\nfrowned impatiently at the sound of female giggling.\n\n\"The Sheikh Anazeh will have the room on this side of you,\" he\nsaid, \"and the Sheikh Suliman ben Saoud the room on the other.\nSo you will be between friends.\"\n\n\"Suliman ben Saoud seems a difficult person to make friends\nwith,\" I answered.\n\nBen Nazir smiled like a prince out of a picture-book--beautiful\nwhite teeth and exquisite benignance.\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't mind him.  These celebrities from the centre of\nArabia give themselves great airs.  To do that is considered\nevidence of piety and wisdom.\"\n\nI sat on the bed--quite a civilized affair, spotlessly clean.\nBen Nazir took the chair, I suppose, like the considerate host he\nwas, to give me the sensation of receiving in my own room.\n\n\"He wears the same sort of head-dress you do.  What does it\nmean?\" I asked.\n\n\"I wear mine out of compliment to him--not that I have not\nalways the right to wear it.  It is the Ichwan head-dress.\nIt is highly significant.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, and then seemed to make up his mind\nthat it did not much matter what he might divulge to an ignorant\nstranger soon to return to the United States.\n\n\"It is difficult to explain.  You Americans know so little of our\npolitics.  It is significant, I might say, of the New Arabia--\nArabia for the Arabs.  The great ben Saoud, who is a relative of\nthis man, is an Arabian chieftain who has welded most of Arabia\ninto one, and now challenges King Hussein of Mecca for the\ncaliphate.  Hussein is only kept on his throne by British gold,\npaid to him from India.  Ben Saoud also receives a subsidy from\nthe British, who must continue to pay it, because otherwise ben\nSaoud will attack Hussein and overwhelm him.  That, it is\nbelieved, would mean a rising of all the Moslem world against\ntheir rulers--in Africa--Asia--India--Java--everywhere.  It began\nas a religious movement.  It is now political--although it is\nheld together by religious zeal.  You might say that the Ichwans\nare the modern Protestants of Islam.  They are fanatical.  The\nworld has never seen such fanaticism, and the movement spreads\nday by day.\"\n\n\"You don't look like a fanatic,\" I said, and he laughed again.\n\n\"I?  God forbid!  But I am a politician;  and to succeed a\npolitician must have friends among all parties.  My one ambition\nis to see all Arabs united in an independent state reaching from\nthis coast to the Persian Gulf.  To that end I devote my energy.\nI use all means available--including money paid me by the French,\nwho have no intention of permitting any such development if they\ncan help it.\"\n\n\"And the British?\"\n\n\"For the present we must make use of them also.  But their yoke\nmust go, eventually.\"\n\n\"Then if America had accepted the Near East mandate, you would\nhave used us in the same way?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  That would have been the easiest way, because\nAmerica understands little or nothing of our politics.  America's\nmoney--America's schools and hospitals--America's war munitions--\nand then good-bye.  I am willing to use all means--all methods to\nthe one end--Arabia for the Arabs.  After that I am willing to\nretire into oblivion.\"\n\nNevertheless, ben Nazir did not convince me that he was an\naltruist who had no private ends to serve.  There was an\navaricious gleam in ben Nazir's eyes.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\n\"D'you mind if I use You?\"\n\nFor all his care to seem hospitable before any other\nconsideration, ben Nazir looked ill at ease.  He led me down\nagain to a dining-room hung with spears, shields, scimitars and\nancient pistols, but furnished otherwise like an instalment-plan\napartment.  He watched while a man set food before me.  It seemed\nthat Anazeh had gone away somewhere to eat with his men.\n\nBen Nazir's restlessness became so obvious that I asked at last\nwhether I was not detaining him.  He jumped at the opening.  With\nprofound apologies he asked me to excuse him for the remainder of\nthe afternoon.\n\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"I came from Damascus to Jerusalem, so I\nwas rather out of touch with what was going on here.  This\nconference of notables was rather a surprise to me.  It will not\nreally take place until tomorrow, but there are important details\nto attend to in advance.  If you could amuse yourself--\"\n\nThe man who could not do that in a crusader city, crammed with\nsons of Ishmael who looked as if they had stepped out of the\npages of the Old Testament, would be difficult to please.  I\nasked for Ahmed, to act as interpreter.  Ben Nazir volunteered to\nprovide me with two men in addition as a sort of bodyguard.\n\n\"Because Ahmed is a person who is not respected.\"\n\nIt did not take ten minutes to produce Ahmed and the two men.\nThe latter were six-foot, solemn veterans armed with rifles\nand long knives.  With them at my heels I set out to explore\nEl-Kerak.\n\n\"There is nothing to see,\" said Ahmed, who did not want to come.\nBut Ahmed was a liar.  There was everything to see.  The only\ndefinite purpose I had in mind was to find Grim.  It was possible\nI might recognize him even through his disguise.  Failing that,\nhe could not help but notice me if I walked about enough;  if so,\nhe would find his own means of establishing communication.\n\nBut you might as well have hunted for one particular pebble on a\nbeach as for a single individual in all that throng.  Remembering\nGrim's disguise when I first saw him, I naturally had that\npicture of him in mind.  But all the Bedouins looked about as\nmuch alike as peas in a pod.  They stared at me as if I were a\ncurio on exhibition, but they did not like being stared back at.\n\nThere was no hint of violence or interference, and no apparent\nresentment of an alien's presence in their midst.  The loud-\nlunged bodyguard shouted out to all and sundry to make way for\nthe \"Amerikani,\" and way was made forthwith, although several\ntimes the bodyguard was stopped and questioned after I had\npassed, to make sure I was really American and not English.\nAhmed assured me that if I had been English they would have\n\"massacred\" me.  In view of what transpired he may have been\nright, though I doubt it.  They might have held me as hostage.\n\nNot that they were in any kind of over-tolerant mood.  There was\na man's dead body hanging by one foot from a great hook on a high\nwall, and the wall was splattered with blood and chipped by\nbullets.  I asked Ahmed what kind of criminal he might be.\n\n\"He did not agree with them.  They are for war.  He was in favor\nof peace, and he made a speech two hours ago.  So they accused\nhim of being a traitor, and he was tried and condemned.\"\n\n\"Who tried him?\"\n\n\"Everybody did.\"\n\n\"War with whom?\" I asked.\n\n\"The British.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because they favor the Zionists.\"\n\n\"And that is what the conference is all about?\"\n\n\"Yes.  There is a man here from Damascus, who urges them to raid\nacross the Jordan into Palestine.  He says that the Palestinian\nArabs will rise then, and cut the throats of all the  Zionists.\nHe says that Emir Feisul is going to attack the French in Syria,\nand that the British will have to go and help the French, so now\nis the time for a raid.\"\n\n\"Is my host, ben Nazir, the man who is talking that way?  He has\nbeen to Damascus.\"\n\n\"No.  Another, named Abdul Ali--a very rich sheikh, who comes\nhere often with caravans of merchandise, and gives rich presents\nto notables.\"\n\n\"Has ben Nazir anything to do with it?\"\n\n\"Who knows?  Mashallah!  The world is full of mysteries.  That\nNazir is a knowing one.  They say of him:  whichever option is\nuppermost, that is always his opinion.  He is a safe man to\nfollow for that reason.  Yet it is easier to follow water through\na channel underground.\"\n\nWe made our way toward the castle at the south side of the town,\nbut were prevented from entering by a guard of feudal retainers,\nwho looked as if they had been well drilled.  They were as solemn\nas the vultures that sat perched along the rampart overlooking a\ngreat artificial moat dividing the town from the high hill just\nbeyond it.\n\nNobody interfered when I climbed on the broken town wall and\nlooked over.  The castle wall sloped down steeply into the moat,\nsuggesting ample space within for dungeons and underground\npassages;  but there was nothing else there of much interest to\nsee, only dead donkeys, a dying camel with the vultures already\nbeginning on him, some dead dogs, heaps of refuse, and a lot more\nvultures too gorged to fly--the usual Arab scheme of sanitation.\nI asked one of my bodyguard to shoot the camel and he obliged me,\nwith the air of a keeper making concessions to a lunatic.  Nobody\ntook any notice of the rifle going off.\n\nIt was when we turned back into the town again that the first\ninkling of Grim's presence in the place turned up.  A bulky-\nlooking Arab in a sheepskin coat that stank of sweat so vilely\nthat you could hardly bear the man near you, came up and stood in\nmy way.  Barring the smell, he was a winning-looking rascal--\ntruculent, swaggering, but possessed of a good-natured smile that\nseemed to say:  \"Sure, I'm a rogue and a liar, but what else did\nyou expect!\"\n\nHe spoke perfectly good English.  He said he wished to speak to\nme alone.  That was easy enough;  Ahmed and the bodyguard\nwithdrew about ten paces, and he and I stepped into a doorway.\n\n\"I am Mahommed ben Hamza,\" he said, with his head on one side, as\nif that explanation ought to make everything clear to me at once.\n\"From Hebron,\" he added, when I did not seem to see the light.\n\nThe wiser one looks, and the less one says, in Arab lands, the\nless trouble there's likely to be.  I tried to look extremely\nwise, and said nothing.\n\n\"Where is Jimgrim?\" he demanded.\n\n\"If you can tell me that I'll give you ten piastres,\" I answered.\n\n\"I will give you fifty if you tell me!\"\n\n\"Why do you want to know?\"\n\n\"He is my friend.  He said I should see him here.  But I have not\nseen him.  He said also I should see you.  You are the Amerikani?\nAnd you don't know where he is?  Truly?  Then, when you see him,\nwill you say to him, 'Mahommed ben Hamza is here with nine men at\nthe house of Abu Shamah?'  Jimgrim will understand.\"\n\nI nodded, and the man from Hebron walked away without another word.\n\n\"Did he steal your watch?\" asked Ahmed.  They are as jealous as\nchildren, those Arabs.\n\nThere was a second execution while I walked back through the\ncity.  A wide-eyed, panic-stricken poor devil with slobber on his\njaws came tearing down-street with a mob at his heels.  We\nstepped into an alley to let the race go by, but he doubled down\nthe alley opposite.  Before he had run twenty yards along it some\none hit the back of his head with a piece of rock.  A second\nlater they had pounced on him, and in less than a minute after\nthat he was kicking in the noose of a hide rope slung over a\nhouse-beam.  I don't know what they hanged him for.  No one\napparently knew.  But they used his carcase for a target and shot\nit almost to pieces.\n\nI kept on looking for Grim, although the task seemed hopeless.\nOf course, I could not give a hint of my real purpose.  But as\nGrim knew that the talk about a school-teacher was my passport\nto the place, it seemed possible that he might use that as an\nexcuse for getting in touch with me.  So I told Ahmed to show\nme the schools.\n\nThey weren't worth looking at--mere tumble-down sheds in which\nMoslem boys were taught to say the Koran by heart.  The places\nwhere Christian missionaries once had been were all turned into\nstores, and even into stables for the horses of the notables.\n\nSo I returned to ben Nazir's house, and found old Sheikh Anazeh\nsitting outside on the step, as motionless as a tobacco-store\nIndian but twice as picturesque.  He still had his own rifle over\nhis knees, and the plundered one slung over his shoulder by a\nstrap;  he never stirred abroad unarmed.\n\nI asked him what the conference of notables was going to be\nabout, and he told me to mind my own business.  That struck me as\nan excellent idea, so, not having slept at all the previous\nnight, I went upstairs and lay on the bed.  There was no lock on\nthe door, so I set the chair against it.\n\nBen Nazir was a man who had traveled a great deal, and picked up\nwestern notions of hospitality to add to the inborn eastern sense\nof sacredness in the relation between host and guest.  It seems\nthat an hour or two later he came to take me down to a Gargantuan\nmeal, but, feeling the chair against the door, and hearing\nsnores, he decided it was better manners to let me lie in peace.\n\nSo I did not wake up again until after midnight.  The moonlight\nwas streaming through a little high-perched window, and fell on\nthe white-robed, ghostly-looking figure of a man, who sat with\ncrossed legs on the end of the bed.  I thought I was dead and\nin hell.\n\nThat is no picturesque exaggeration about a man's hair standing\nwhen he is terrified.  It really does.  I would have yelled\naloud, if the breath would have come, but there is a trick of\nsudden fear that seems to grip your lungs and hold them impotent.\nThe thing on the end of the bed had no eye-brows.  It grinned as\nif it knew all about evil, and were hungry, and living men were\nits food.\n\nI don't know how long I stared at the thing, but it seemed\nlike a week.  At last it spoke, and I burst into a sweat with\nthe reaction.\n\n\"Good job you don't know how to fasten a door with a chair.  I'll\nhave to show you that trick, or you'll be dying before your time.\nSh-h-h!  Don't make a noise!\"\n\nI sat up and looked more closely at him.  It was the Ichwan of\nthe afternoon--Sheikh Suliman ben Saoud.  And he was speaking\nunmistakable American.  I began again to believe I was dreaming.\nHe chuckled quietly and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"Aren't you wise to me yet?\"\n\n\"Grim?\"\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\n\"But what's happened to your face?  You're all one-sided.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy.  I just take out my false teeth.  The rest is\ndone with a razor and some brown stain.  I thought you were going\nto spot me when you first came.  Did you?  I didn't think so.\nDid you act as well as all that?\"\n\n\"No.  Looked all over town for you afterward.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.  I thought that was too natural to be acting.  Pick up\nany news in town?\"\n\n\"Saw a hanging, and met a man who calls himself Mahommed ben\nHamza.  He's waiting at the house of Abu Shamah.\"\n\n\"Any men with him?\"\n\n\"Nine.\"\n\n\"Three more than he promised.  Ben Hamza is the most honest thief\nand dependable liar in Palestine--a cheerful murderer who sticks\ncloser than a brother.  I saved him once from being hung, because\nhe smiles so nicely.  Any more news?\"\n\n\"I expect none that you don't know.  There's a sheikh named Abdul\nAli from Damascus, preaching a raid into Palestine.\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"I'm here to bag that bird.\"\n\n\"Where do I come in?\" I asked.\n\n\"You are the plausible excuse, that's all.  Thanks to you old\nAnazeh got into El-Kerak with twenty men.  Two might not have\nbeen enough, even with ben Hamza and his nine.\"\n\n\"Then our host ben Nazir is in on your game?\"\n\n\"Not he!  Up at headquarters in Jerusalem we knew all about this\ncoming conference.  These folk are ready to explode.  The only\nway to stop it is to pull the plug--The plug is Abdul Ali.  We\nknew we could count on old Anazeh.  But the puzzle was how to get\nhim and his men into El-Kerak.  When you told me ben Nazir had\ninvited you, I saw the way to do it.  There wasn't anybody else\nexcept Anazeh that ben Nazir could have sent to fetch you, and\nthe old boy is a dependable friend of ours.\"\n\n\"That did not stop him from raiding two villages on the British\nside of the Dead Sea,\" I answered.\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Sure.  I had part of a raided sheep for breakfast.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  Well of all the--damn his impudence!  The shrewd old\ndevil must have figured that we can't get after him for it,\nseeing how he's playing our game.  Bloody old horse-thief!  Well,\nhe gets away with it, this time.  You'll have to be mighty\ncareful not to seem to recognize me.  One slip and we're done\nfor.  You're safe enough.  If they once get wise to me they'll\npull me in pieces between four horses.\"\n\n\"What's your plan?\"\n\n\"It's vague yet.  Got to be an opportunist.  I'm supposed to\nbe a member of the ben Saoud family, recruiting members for\nthe new sect--biggest thing in Arabia.  I'm invited to the\nconference on the strength of my supposed connection with the\nbig Ichwan movement.\"\n\n\"D'you propose to murder this Abdul Ali person, then, or have him\nmurdered?\" I asked.\n\n\"Uh-uh!  Murder's out of my line.  Besides, that'ud do no good.\nWorse than useless.  They'd all cut loose.  Abdul Ali has got\nthem together.  What with bribes and a lot of promises he has\nthem keen on this raid.  If he were killed they'd say one of our\nspies did it.  They'd add vengeance to their other motives, which\nat present are mainly a desire for loot.  No, no.  Abdul Ali has\ngot to disappear.  Then they'll believe he has betrayed them.\nThen, instead of raiding Palestine they'll confiscate his\nproperty and curse his ancestors.  D'you see the point?\"\n\n\"More or less.  But what good can I do?\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I use you?\"\n\nI laughed.  \"That's a hell of a silly question.  Any use my\nminding?  You've already used me.  You will do it again without\nconsulting me.  I like it, as it happens.  But a fat lot you\ncare whether I like it or not.  Isn't it a bit late in the day\nto ask permission?\"\n\n\"Oh, well.  You know the hangmen always used to beg the victim's\npardon.  Will you obey orders?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But it might be easier if I know what I'm doing.\"\n\n\"As soon as I know I'll explain,\" he answered.  \"Where you can\nfit into the puzzle at the moment is by rooting for the school\nidea.  The worst robber chieftain from the farthest cluster of\nhuts he calls his home town would like to see an American school\nhere in El-Kerak.  If there were one he'd send his sons to it.\"\n\n\"Okay.  I'll root like a dog for a buried bone.\"\n\n\"Go to it.  That gives you the right to ask questions.  That will\noblige ben Nazir to introduce you to any one you want to\ninterview.  That will explain without any further argument\nwhatever weakness you seem to have for talking to men in the\nstreet like Mahommed ben Hamza.  It would even explain away any\npoliteness that I might show you in my capacity of Ichwan.  For\nsafety's sake, and to create an impression, I take the line of\nbeing rude to every one;  but I might reasonably toss a few\ncrumbs of condescension to an altruist from foreign parts.  At\nany rate, I'll have to take that chance.  D'you get me?\"\n\n\"You mean, you'll use me as intermediary? Messages to and from\nben Hamza and that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"That's the idea, but there's more to it.  Did you bring that\nBible along?  Are you superstitious?  Any notions like Long John\nSilver's about its being bad luck to spoil a Bible?  All right.\nKeep it in your pocket to make notes in.  If you can't get the\nwhole book to me, tear a page out and send that, or give it to\nme, with the message spelled in dots under the words.  Make the\ndots faint, I've good eyes.\"\n\n\"What sort of notes do you want from me?\"\n\n\"You mustn't mistake me for the prophet Ezekiel,\" he answered,\ngrinning.  \"'Thus saith the Lord' is all right when you know what\nyou're talking about.  All I know for certain is that I've got\nto bag Abdul Ali.  If you get information that looks important\nto you, get it to me in the way I've told you, that's all.\nDon't be caught talking to me.  Don't look friendly.  Don't\nseem interested.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"If you can, keep old Anazeh sober.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nGrim nodded meaningly:  \"I've known easier jobs!\"\n\n\"The old sport thinks no more of me than of an express package\nhe'd been hired to deliver,\" I answered.  \"Drunk or sober, he'd\nbrush me aside like a fly.\"\n\n\"Well--wits were given us to use.  I guess you'll have to use\nyours.  Have you any?\"\n\n\"How the hell should I know?\" I retorted.\n\n\"If you find I haven't any, don't blame me.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" he answered, and I believed him.\n\n\"What else besides being dry-nurse to the king of the\nAmalekites?\" I asked.\n\n\"Don't trust Ahmed.\"\n\n\"He's a good interpreter.\"\n\n\"Yeh--and a poor peg.  You'll have to use him--some.  But don't\ntrust him.\"\n\n\"Does old Anazeh know you in that disguise?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, and he mustn't.  I'll tell you why.  All these people are\nreligious fanatics.  A horrible death is the only fate they would\nconsider for a man caught masquerading as a holy personage the\nway I'm doing.  But their fanaticism has a way of petering out\nwhen the gang's not there to see.  In his own village I think\nAnazeh would laugh if I talked this ruse over with him--\nafterwards.  But if he knew about it here, with all these other\nfanatics alert and fanning, he wouldn't dare not to expose me.\nIt's a good job you asked that.  If I send any message to Anazeh\nthrough you, be sure you don't give me away.\"\n\n\"How shall I make him believe the message is from you, then?\"\n\n\"Begin with 'Jimgrim says.'  He'll recognize the formula.  But if\nhe questions that, say 'A lion knows a lion in the dark.'\nThat'll serve a double purpose--convince him and jog his memory.\nHe ignored a request of mine--once, and I was able to get back at\nhim.  Tell you the story some day.  Nowadays he's more or less\ndependable, unless he gets a skin-full of redeye.  Well, make the\nmost of your chance to sleep;  you may have to go short later.\nI'm going to saw off a cord or two myself.\"\n\nHe left the room as silently as a ghost.  I don't doubt that he\nslept peacefully.  Subsequent acquaintance with him convinced me\nthat he can go to sleep almost anywhere in any circumstances.\nAnd that is a very great gift, for it enables its owner to wear\ndown any dozen who must sleep for stated hours at fixed\nintervals.  Grim snatches his whenever the chance comes, and goes\nwithout with apparent indifference.  He told me once that he\ndreams nearly all the time he is asleep.  But the dreams don't\nseem to trouble him.  I believe he dreams out the key to whatever\nproblem puzzles him at the moment.\n\nMy own sleep was done for that night, his advice notwithstanding.\nI lay listening to Anazeh's thunderous snores and naturally\nenough imagining every possible contingency and dozens that were\ntotally impossible.  Nothing turned out in the least like any of\nmy forecasts;  but that was not for want of trying to foresee it\nall.  I don't seem to possess any of that quiet gift of waiting\nto deal with each development on its merits, as and when it\ncomes.  I have to speculate, and speculation is the ene my\nof peace.\n\nLooking back, I don't think I felt a bit afraid of the immediate\nfuture;  but that was due to ignorance of nearly all that the\npresent held.  I think that was part of Grim's reason for helping\nme to reach El-Kerak in the first place;  he counted on my\nignorance of danger to keep me cool-headed.  It is true, it did\ndawn on me that if my host were to suspect me of intriguing under\ncover of his protection, the protection might cease with\ndisconcerting abruptness.  I realized to some extent what a\npredicament that would be.  But on the whole, I think the only\nreal worry was the definite task Grim had given me--the\nthankless, and very likely desperate, inglorious one of trying to\nkeep old Anazeh sober.\n\nOf course, the Koran forbids wine.  But whiskey is not wine.  And\nif you mix whiskey and wine together they cease to be either;\nthey become a commodity of which the Prophet knew nothing and\nwhich he therefore did not forbid.  But if you introduce such a\nmixture into the stomach, and thence into the brain of an already\nfiery Bedouin;  and then introduce the Bedouin to trouble;  and\nif, in addition to the trouble, you provide impertinent, alien,\nand what he calls infidel restraint, it is fair to presume that\nthe mixture might explode.\n\nIt seemed to me I had been given too much to do.  In order to get\nintroductions to the notables I must first get ben Nazir into a\nproper frame of mind.  Then, stammering in an alien tongue, I\nmust make friends with chieftains who had never even heard of me;\nand that, when their minds were busy with another matter.  I must\nkeep in touch with ben Hamza, and convey his messages to Grim\nwithout being seen or arousing suspicion.  In addition to all\nthat I must keep sober by some means an old savage armed with\ntwo rifles and a knife, who had twenty cut-throats at his beck\nand call!\n\nWhile I pondered the problem in all its impossible bearings, loud\nsnores to right and left of me, tenor and bass by turns,\nannounced that Jimgrim and Anazeh were as blissfully oblivious to\nmy worries as the bedbugs were that had come out of hiding and\ndiscovered me.  I began to feel homesick.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\n\"That man will repay study.\"\n\n\nI got my first shot at Anazeh at dawn, when the muezzin began\nwailing over the city;  and I missed badly with both barrels.\nThe old sheikh looked into my room, presumably to see if I was\nstill alive, since he had guaranteed to see me safely back again\nacross the Jordan, before rounding up his rascals for morning\nprayer.  They prayed together whenever possible, Anazeh keeping\ncount of their genuflections.\n\nYou could tell he had been drinking the night before the minute\nhe thrust his head into the room.  He smelt like the lees of a\nrum barrel, and the rims of his eyes were red.\n\nSeeing I was awake he gave me the courteous, full-sounding \"Allah\nysabbhak bilkhair,\" and I asked him where he had dined the night\nbefore.  He mumbled something into his beard that I could not\ncatch, but he could not have told me much more plainly to go to\nhell, even in plain English.  However, I had to get a foothold\nsomewhere, so I said that I had heard that the liquor in El-Kerak\nwas poisonous.\n\nAs far as I understood his answer, he implied that it likely\nwould be poisonous in the sort of place where I would buy it, but\nthat he, Anazeh, need not be told how to suck eggs by any such a\ngreenhorn as me.\n\nI tried him again.  I said that liquor taken in quantity would\nkill a man.\n\n\"So will one bullet!\" he answered.  \"But, whereas a bullet in the\nbelly causes pain before death, moiyit ilfadda (aqua fortis)\ncauses pleasure;  and a man dies either way.\"\n\nHe turned to go, rattling two rifle-butts against the door, but I\nhad one last try to get on terms and said I hoped to see him at\nbreakfast, or shortly afterward.\n\n\"God is the giver both of eyesight and the things to see,\" he\nanswered.  \"I go to pray.  God will guide my footsteps afterward.\"\n\nI did not feel I had really made much headway, but I fared rather\nbetter with my host downstairs, who either did not pray with such\nenthusiasm or else had forestalled the muezzin.  At any rate, he\nwas waiting for me near a table spread with sweet cakes and good\nFrench coffee.  After the usual string of pleasantries he became\nsuddenly confidential, over-acting the part a little, as a man\ndoes who has something rather disagreeable up his sleeve that\nhe means to spring on you presently.\n\n\"I have been busy since an hour before dawn.  I have been\nconsulting with my friend Suliman ben Saoud.  The situation here\nis very serious.  As long as you are my guest you are perfectly\nsafe;  but if I were to send you away, the assembled notables\nmight suspect you of being a spy, and might accuse me of\nharbouring a spy.  Do you see?  They would suppose you were\nreturning to Jerusalem with information for the British.  That\nwould have most unpleasant consequences--for both of us!\"\n\nClearly, Grim in the guise of ben Saoud had been busy, and it was\nup to me to seize my cue alertly.  I was at pains to look\nalarmed.  Ben Nazir grew solicitous.\n\n\"Rest assured, you are safe as my guest.  But Suliman ben Saoud\nwas annoyed to think a stranger should be here at such a time as\nthis.  He took me to task about you.  He is also my guest, as I\nreminded him, but he is a truculent fellow.  He insisted that the\nassembled notables have the right to satisfaction regarding your\nbona fides.  It was no use my saying, as I did repeatedly, that I\npersonally guarantee you.  He asked me how much I know about you.\nI had to confess that what I actually know amounts to very\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Well?\" I said.  \"What does the old grouch want?\"\n\n\"He thinks that you should be presented to the assembled notables\nat noon today.  In fact, he demands that they should catechize\nyou regarding your ideas about a school.\"\n\n\"I have no objection.\"\n\n\"But, I am sorry to have to add this:  it is probable the\nnotables will insist on your remaining in El-Kerak until after\nthat shall have taken place which they have been summoned to\ndecide on.  They will not risk your returning before the--\"\n\n\n\"Before what?\"\n\n\"The--ah--they contemplate a raid!\"\n\n\"So I'm a prisoner?\"\n\n\"No, no!  Mon dieu, what do you think of me!  Even the fanatical\nSuliman ben Saoud saw the force of the argument when I spoke of\nthe sanctity of any guest here on my invitation.  But he thinks--\nand I agree with him, that as a precaution you should first call\non Sheikh Abdul Ali.  You will find him a very agreeable man, who\nwill receive you with proper courtesy.  He is here from Damascus,\nand exercises a great influence.  Once his mind is at ease about\nyou, he will satisfy all the others.  Are you agreeable?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nSo we smoked a cigarette together after the coffee, and then set\nforth on foot, for the distance was not great, preceded and\nsurrounded by armed retainers.  I imagine the armed men were more\nfor the sake of appearance than protection.  Ben Nazir seemed\npopular.  But the escort drove other pedestrians out of the way\nas roughly as they did the unspeakable dogs that infested every\noffal-heap.  The street that we followed was, of course, the open\nsewer for the houses on either hand, and its condition was a\ncredit to the mangy curs that so resented our intrusion.\n\nAbdul Ali's house, if his it was, was a fairly big square\nbuilding near the middle of the town.  It did not look unlike one\nof the old-time New York precinct stations, with its big windows\nprotected by iron grilles, and a flight of stone steps leading up\nto a door exactly in the middle of the front wall.\n\nThere were thirty or forty capable-looking men hanging about the\nplace.  Abdul Ali owned more than one camel caravan, and every\nman connected with the business looked on himself as a member of\none big feudal family.  They were all armed.  Most of them had\nmodern rifles.\n\nWe were admitted into a room that faced on the street, furnished\nentirely in the eastern style, except for two gilt chairs against\nthe wall.  The walls were hung with carpets and the floor was\ncovered with Bokhara rugs three deep.\n\nNo doubt in order to emphasize his own importance, Abdul Ali kept\nus waiting in that room for ten minutes before he condescended to\nenter.  But when he did come at last he was at pains to seem\nagreeable, which was not quite his natural attitude.\n\nI had never seen a more offensive personality, although at the\nfirst glance he did not arouse actual dislike.  Distaste for him\ndawned, and grew.  He was certainly not physically attractive,\nalthough the Syrian Arab costume made him picturesque.  The first\nthing I noticed was the fatness of his hands--those of a giver of\ndishonest gifts.  When he shook hands you felt in some subtle way\nthat he was sure your conscience was for sale, that he would\npurchase it for any reasonable figure, and that he believed he\nhad plenty of money with which to buy you and all your relatives.\n\nHe was a little puffy under the eyes, had a firm mouth, rather\nthick lips, and his small black moustache was turned up like the\nKaiser's, which gave him a cockily self-assured appearance.  For\nthe rest, he was a rather military-looking person, although his\nflowing robe partly concealed that;  stockily rather than heavily\nbuilt;  and of rather more than middle height.  He wore one ring--a\nsapphire of extraordinary brilliance, of which he was immensely\nproud.  When I noticed it he said at once that it had been given\nhim by the late Sultan Abdul Hamid.\n\nHe spoke German from choice, so we conversed in German, which\nannoyed ben Nazir, who could not understand a word of it.  And\nfrom first to last throughout that interview, and subsequently to\nthe point where Jimgrim out-maneuvered and out-played him, he\nrelied on the German philosophy of self-assertion that teaches\nhow to get and keep the upper hand by making yourself believe in\nyour own super-intelligence and then speaking, acting, making\nplans in logical accord with that belief.  It works finely until\nsomebody spoils the whole thing by pricking the super-intelligence\nbladder and letting out all the wind.\n\nAlthough he spoke German, he was not by any means pro-German in\nhis motives.  He was at pains to make that clear.  Evidently he\nhad been pro-German once, until he saw the writing on the wall.\nHe was conscious of the need to offset past prejudices before\nsuggesting his enormous ability along advanced lines.\n\n\"You come at an interesting time,\" he said.  \"You find us in\ntransition.  Before the War, and almost until the end of it, most\nArabs believed in the German destiny.  English gold commanded the\nallegiance of an Arab army, but every last man in that army was\nready to follow the German standard at the proper time.  That\nonly shows how ignorant these people are.  As soon as it became\nevident that the Arab destiny lies in the hands of Arabs\nthemselves most of them immediately began to clamour for an\nAmerican mandate, because that would give them temporary masters\nwho could protect them, yet at the same time who would be too\nignorant of real conditions to prevent secret preparations for a\npan-Arabian revolt.  All very absurd, of course.\"\n\nHe had no idea how absurd he himself appeared.  He launched into\na tirade designed to make him seem a super-statesman in the eyes\nof a stranger who did not care what he was.  The more he talked\nhimself into a delirium of self-esteem the less his character\nimpressed me.  I even ran into the danger of under-estimating him\nbecause he liked himself so much.\n\n\"I'm here to look into the prospects for a school,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, yes.  Very estimable.  You shall have my support.\"  He\npaused for me to fawn on him, and my neglect to do it spurred him\nto further self-revelation.\n\n\"You must look to me for support if you hope for success.  There\nis no cohesion here without me.  I am the only man in El-Kerak to\nwhom they all listen, and even I have difficulty in uniting them\nat times.  But a school is a good idea, and under my auspices you\nwill succeed.\"\n\nFor the moment I thought he suspected me of wanting to teach\nschool myself.  I hastened to correct the impression:\n\n\"All I promise to do is to tell people in the States who might be\ninterested.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"  He had been coming at this point all along in his own\nway.  \"So there is no hurry.  It makes no difference that you\nmust stay in El-Kerak a little longer than you intended.  You\nshall be presented to the council of notables under my auspices.\nIn my judgment it is important that you remain here for some\nlittle time.\"\n\nI suppose the men who can analyze their thoughts, and separate\nthe wise impulses from the rash ones, are the people whom the\nworld calls men of destiny and whom history later assigns to its\nhalls of fame.  The rest of us simply act from pique, prejudice,\npassion or whatever other emotion is in charge.  I know I did.\nIt was resentment.  It was so immensely disagreeable to be\npatronized by this puffy-eyed sensualist that I could not resist\nthe impulse to argue with him.\n\n\"I don't see the force of that,\" said I.  \"My plans are made to\nreturn to Jerusalem tomorrow.\"\n\nI could not have done better as it happened.  I suppose there is\nsome theory that has been written down in books to explain how\nthese things work, at any rate to the satisfaction of the fellow\nwho wrote the book.  But Grim, referring to it afterward, called\nit naked luck.  I would rather agree with Grim than argue with\nany inky theorist on earth, having seen too many theories upset.\nLuck looks to me like a sweeter lady, and more worshipful than\nany of the goddesses they rename nowadays and then dissect in\nclinics.  At any rate, by naked luck I prodded Abdul Ali where he\nkept his supply of mistakes.  Instead of calling my bluff, as he\ndoubtless should have done, he set out to win me over to his\npoint of view.  Whichever way you analyze it in the light of\nsubsequent events, the only possible conclusion is that it was my\nturn to be lucky and Abdul Ali's to make a fool of himself.\nNobody could have made a fool of him better than he did.\n\n\"I must dissuade you,\" he said, trying to hide wilfulness under\nan unpleasant smile.  \"I will offer inducements.\"\n\n\"They'll have to be heavy,\" I said, \"to weigh against what I have\nin mind.\"\n\nHe had kept ben Nazir and me standing all this time.  Now he\noffered me one of the chairs, took the other himself, and\nmotioned ben Nazir to a cushion near the window.  A servant\nbrought in the inevitable coffee and cigarettes.  Then he laid a\nhand on my knee for special emphasis--a fat, pale, unprincipled\nhand, with that great sapphire gleaming on the middle finger.\n\n\"It happens that this idea of a school comes just at the right\nmoment.  I have been searching my mind for just some such idea to\nlay before the notables.  As we are talking a language that none\nelse here understands, I can safely take you into confidence.  A\nraid is being planned into British territory.\"\n\nHe paused to let that sink in, and tapped my knee with his\ndisgusting fingers until I could have struck him from irritation.\n\n\"There is, however, an element of disagreement.  There is\nuncertainty as to the outcome, in the minds of some of the chiefs\nwho live nearest to the border.  The feeling among them is that\nperhaps I am urging them on in order to serve my own ambition at\ntheir expense.  They appreciate the opportunity to loot;  but\nthey say that the British will hit back afterwards, and they,\nbeing nearest to the border, will suffer most;  whereas I stand\nto gain all and to lose nothing.  Very absurd, of course, but\nthat is their argument.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"you don't expect me to take my coat off and\npreach a jihad against the British?\"\n\n\"Im Gotteswillen!  No, no, no!  This is my meaning:  if I can go\nbefore them with the offer of a school for El-Kerak, which the\nvery worst scoundrel among them desires with all his ignorant\nheart;  and if I can produce a distinguished gentleman from\nAmerica, present among them on my invitation for the sole purpose\nof making the arrangements for such a school, that will convince\nthem that I have their interests really at heart.  Do you see?\"\n\nAgain the irritating fingers drumming on my knee.  I did not\nanswer for fear of betraying ill-temper.\n\n\"I am a statesman, sir.  I understand the arguments with which\nwhole nations may deceive themselves.  I have made it my\nprofession to detect the trends of thought and the tides of\nunrest.  Psychological moments are for me a fascinating study.  I\ncan recognize them.\"\n\nHe laid the fat hand on my shoulder for a change, and tried to\nlook into my eyes;  but I was watching the edge of a curtain at\nthe far end of the room.\n\n\"Now, to you, an American, our local dispute means nothing.  This\nraid is no affair of yours.  You wash your hands of it.  You, an\naltruist, are interested only in a school.  I offer you\nopportunity, building, subsidy, guarantees.  You reciprocate by\ngiving me a talking point.  I shall make use of the opportunity.\nThat is settled.  And, let me see, I promised you inducements,\ndidn't I?\"\n\nHe looked, at me and I looked at him.  He waited for a hint of\nsome sort, but I made no move to help him out.\n\n\"What shall we say?\"\n\nI was as interested in the result of his appraisal as he was in\nmaking it.  Whether complimentary or not, another's calculated\njudgment of your character is a fascinating thing to wait for.\n\n\"I think you will be getting full value.  I shall introduce you\nto all the notables,\" he said at last.    \"To a man of your\ntemperament it will be a privilege to attend the council, and to\nknow in advance all that is going to happen.  There will be no\nobjection to that, because it is already decided you will remain\nin El-Kerak until after the--er--raid.  The notables will\nunderstand from me that your mouth is sealed until after the\nevent.  You shall be let into our secrets.  There--is that\nnot equitable?\"\n\nIt was shrewd.  I did not believe for a minute that he would let\nme into all their secrets, but he could not have imagined a\ngreater temptation for me.  Since I would not have taken his word\nthat black was not white, I did not hesitate to pretend to agree\nto his terms.\n\n\"I must have an interpreter,\" I said.  \"Otherwise I shall\nunderstand very little.\"\n\n\"I will supply you an interpreter--a good one.\"\n\n\"No, thank you.  Any man of yours might only tell me what he\nthought correct for me to hear.  If I'm to get a price for my\nservices, I want the full price.  I want to hear everything.  I\nmust be allowed to bring my own interpreter.\"\n\n\"Who would he be?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"That man Ahmed, for instance?  I have been told he is one of\nyour party.  Ahmed would do very well.\"\n\n\"No, not Ahmed.\"\n\n\"Who then?\"\n\n\"I will find a man.\"\n\nHe hesitated.  If ever a man was reviewing all the possible\ncontingencies, murder of me included, behind a mask of superficial\ncourtesy, that man was he.\n\n\"He should be a man acceptable to the notables,\" he said at last.\n\"I ought to know his name in advance.\"\n\n\"I must have unfettered choice, or I won't attend the\nmejlis.\"  [Council]\n\n\"Oh, very well. Only the interpreter, too, will have to remain\nafterward in El-Kerak.\"\n\nI looked at that curtain again, for it was moving in a way that\nno draft from the open window could account for.  But at last the\nmovement was explained.  Before Abdul Ali could speak again a man\nstepped out from behind it, crossed the room, and went out\nthrough the door, closing it silently behind him.  He was a man I\nknew, and the last man I had expected to see in that place.  I\nsuppose Abdul Ali noticed my look of surprise.\n\n\"You know him?\" he asked.\n\n\"By sight.  He was at Sheikh ben Nazir's house yesterday.\"\n\n\"That is Suliman ben Saoud, a stranger from Arabia, but a man\nof great influence because of his connection with the Ichwan\nmovement.  If you are interested in our types that man will\nrepay study.\"\n\n\"Good.  I'll try to study him,\" said I.\n\nIt was all I could do to keep a straight face.  So Jimgrim was\nthe source of Abdul Ali's inspirations!  I wondered what subtle\nargument he could have used to make the sheikh so keen on baiting\nhis hook with the school proposal.  His nerve, in waiting behind\nthat curtain until he knew his scheme had succeeded, and then\nwalking out bold as brass to let me know that he had overheard\neverything, was what amused me.  But I managed not to smile.\n\n\"What time is the mejlis?\"  I asked.\n\n\"At noon.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go and hunt up my interpreter.\"\n\nBen Nazir came out with me, in a blazing bad temper.  He was as\njealous as a pet dog, and inclined to visit the result on me.\n\n\"Very polite, I am sure!  Most refined!  Most courteous!  In your\ncountry, sir, does a guest reward his host for hospitality by\ntalking in a language that his host can't understand?  Perhaps\nyou would rather transfer your presence to Abdul Ali's house?\nPray do not consider yourself beholden to me, in case you would\nprefer his hospitality!\"\n\nI tried in vain to pacify him.  I explained that the choice of\nlanguage had been Abdul Ali's, and offered to tell him now in\nFrench every word that had passed.  But he would not listen.\n\n\"It would not be difficult for a man of your intelligence to make\nup a story,\" he said rudely.\n\n\"Abdul Ali can talk French.  If it had been intended that I\nshould know the truth that conversation would have been in\nFrench.  Shall I send your bag to Abdul Ali's house?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said.  \"Give it to Anazeh.  He is answerable for\nmy safety until I reach Palestine again.  Thank you for a\nnight's lodging.\"\n\nHe walked away in a great huff, and I set out for the house of\nAbu Shamah, using my scant store of Arabic to ask the way.\nMahommed ben Hamza was lolling on the stone veranda, gossiping\nwith half-a-dozen men.  He came the minute I beckoned him.\n\n\"I've seen Jimgrim,\" I said.  \"You're to come with me at noon to\nthe mejlis as my interpreter.\"\n\nHe grinned delightedly.\n\n\"And see here, you smelly devil:  Here's money.  Buy yourself a\nclean shirt, a new coat, and some soap.  Wash yourself from head\nto foot, and put the new clothes on, before you meet me at the\ncastle gate ten minutes before noon.  Those are Jimgrim's orders,\ndo you understand?\"\n\n\"Taht il-amr! (Yours to command)\" he answered laughing.\n\nI went and bought myself an awful meal at the house of a man who\nrolled Kabobs between his filthy fingers.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n\n\"Who gives orders to me?\"\n\n\nThe wonderful thing about Moab is that everything happens in a\nstory-book setting, with illustrations by Maxfield Parrish and\nWyeth and Joe Coll, and all the rest of them, whichever way\nyou look.\n\n\nImagine a blue sky--so clear-blue and pure that you can see\nagainst it the very feathers in the tails of wheeling kites, and\nknow that they are brown, not black.  Imagine all the houses, and\nthe shacks between them, and the poles on which the burlap\nawnings hang, painted on flat canvas and stood up against that\ninfinite blue.  Stick some vultures in a row along a roof-top--\npurplish--bronze they'll look between the tiles and sky.  Add\nyellow camels, gray horses, striped robes, long rifles, and a\nsearching sun-dried smell.  And there you have El-Kerak, from\nthe inside.\n\nFrom any point along the broken walls or the castle roof you can\nsee for fifty miles over scenery invented by the Master-Artist,\nwith the Jordan like a blue worm in the midst of yellow-and-green\nhills twiggling into a turquoise sea.\n\nThe villains stalk on-stage and off again sublimely aware of\ntheir setting.  The horses prance, the camels saunter, the very\nstreet-dogs compose themselves for a nap in the golden sun, all\nin perfect harmony with the piece.  A woman walking with a stone\njar on her head (or, just as likely, a kerosene can) looks as if\nshe had just stepped out of eternity for the sake of the picture.\nAnd not all the kings and kaisers, cardinals and courtezans\nrolled into one great swaggering splurge of majesty could hold a\ncandle to a ragged Bedouin chief on a flea-bitten pony, on the\nway to a small-town mejlis.\n\nSo it was worth a little inconvenience, and quite a little risk\nto see those chiefs arrive at the castle gate, toss their reins\nto a brother cut-throat, and swagger in, the poorest and least\nimportant timing their arrival, when they could, just in advance\nof an important man so as to take precedence of him and delay\nhis entrance.\n\nMindful of my charge to keep Anazeh sober, and more deadly afraid\nof it than of all the other risks, I hung about waiting for him,\nhoping he would arrive before Abdul Ali or ben Nazir.  I wanted\nto go inside and be seated before either of those gentry came.\nBut not a bit of it.  I saw Anazeh ride up at the head of his\ntwenty men, halt at a corner, and ask a question.  His men were in\nmilitary order, and looked not only ready but anxious to charge\nthe crowd and establish their old chief's importance.\n\nMahommed ben Hamza, not quite so smelly in his new clothes, was\nstanding at my elbow.\n\n\"Sheikh Anazeh beckons you,\" he said.\n\nSo the two of us worked our way leisurely through the crowd\ntoward the side-street down which Anazeh had led his party.  We\nfound them looking very spruce and savage, four abreast, drawn up\nin the throat of an alley, old Anazeh sitting his horse at their\nhead like a symbol of the ancient order waiting to assault the\nnew.  My horse was close beside him, held by Ahmed, acting\nservitor on foot.\n\nThe old man let loose the vials of his wrath on me the minute I\ndrew near, and Mahommed ben Hamza took delicious pleasure in\ntranslating word for word.\n\n\"Is that the way an effendi in my care should be seen at such a\ntime--on foot?  Am I a maskin* that you do not ride?  Is the\nhorse not good enough?\" [*Poor devil]\n\nI made ben Hamza explain that I was to attend the mejlis as\nSheikh Abdul Ali's guest.  But that only increased his wrath.\n\n\"So said ben Nazir!  Shall a lousy Damascene trick me out of\nkeeping my oath?  You are in my safekeeping until you tread on\nBritish soil again, and my honour is concerned in it!  No doubt\nthat effeminate schemer of schemes would like to display you at\nthe mejlis as his booty, but you are mine!  Did you think you are\nnot under obligation to me?\"\n\nI answered pretty tactfully.  I said that Allah had undoubtedly\ncreated him to be a protector of helpless wayfarers and the very\nguardian of honour.  Mahommed ben Hamza added to the compliments\nwhile rendering mine into Arabic.  But though Anazeh's wrath was\nsomewhat mollified, he was not satisfied by any means.\n\n\"Am I a dog,\" he demanded, \"that I should be slighted for the\nsake of that Damascene?\"\n\nIt looked to me like the proper moment to try out Grim's\nmagic formula.\n\n\"You are the father of lions.  And a lion knows a lion in the\ndark!\" said I.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous.  He puffed his cheeks out in\nastonishment, and sucked them in again.  The overbearing anger\nvanished as he leaned forward in the saddle to scrutinize my\nface.  It was clear that he thought my use of that phrase might\njust possibly have been an accident.\n\n\"Jimgrim says--\"\n\n\"Ah!  What says Jimgrim?  Who are you that know where he is?\"\n\n\"A lion knows a lion in the dark!\" I said again, that there might\nbe no mistake about my having used the words deliberately.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Praised be Allah!  Blessings upon His Prophet!  What\nsays Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"Jimgrim says I am to keep by Anazeh and watch him, lest he drink\nstrong drink and lose his honour by becoming like a beast without\ndecency or understanding!\"\n\n\"Mount your horse, effendi.  Sit beside me.\"\n\nI complied.  Ben Hamza took the place of Ahmed, who went to the\nrear looking rather pleased to get out of the limelight.\n\n\"What else says Jimgrim?\" asked Anazeh.\n\n\"There will be a message presently, providing Sheikh Anazeh\nkeeps sober!\"\n\nTo say that I was enjoying the game by this time is like trying\nto paint heaven with a tar-brush.  You've got to be on the inside\nof an intrigue before you can appreciate the thrill of it.\nNobody who has not had the chance to mystify a leader of cheerful\nmurderers in a city packed with conspirators, with the shadow of\na vulture on the road in front, and fanged death waiting to be\nlet loose, need talk to me of excitement.\n\n\"Well and good,\" said Anazeh.  \"When Jimgrim speaks, I listen!\"\n\nCan you beat that?  Have you ever dreamed you were possessed of\nsome magic formula like \"Open Sesame,\" and free to work with it\nany miracle you choose?  Was the dream good?  I was awake--on a\nhorse--in a real eastern alley--with twenty thieves as picturesque\nas Ali Baba's, itching for action behind me!\n\n\"Abdul Ali of Damascus thinks he will enter the mejlis last and\ncreate a great sensation,\" said Anazeh.  \"That son of infamies\ndeceives himself.  I shall enter last.  I shall bring you.  There\nwill be no doubt who is important!\"\n\nJust as he spoke there clattered down the street at right angles\nto us a regular cavalcade of horsemen led by no less than Abdul\nAli with a sycophant on either hand.  Cardinal Wolsey, or some\nother wisehead, once remarked that a king is known by the\nsplendour of his servants.  Abdul Ali's parasites were dressed\nfor their part in rose-coloured silk and mounted on beautiful\nwhite Arab horses so severely bitted that they could not help\nbut prance.\n\nAbdul Ali, on the other hand, played more a king-maker's role,\ndark and sinister in contrast to their finery, on a dark brown\nhorse that trotted in a business-like, hurry-up-and-get-it-done-\nwith manner.  He rode in the German military style, and if you\ncan imagine the Kaiser in Arab military head-dress, with high\nblack riding boots showing under a brown cloak, you have his\ndescription fairly closely.  The upturned moustaches and the\nscowl increased the suggestion, and I think that was deliberate.\n\n\"A dog--offspring of dogs!  Curse his religion and his bed!\"\ngrowled Anazeh in my ear.\n\nThe old sheikh allowed his enemy plenty of time.  To judge by the\nway the men behind us gathered up their reins and closed in knee-\nto-knee, they would have liked to spoil Abdul Ali's afternoon by\nriding through his procession and breaking its formation.  But\nAnazeh had his mind set, and they seemed to know better than to\ntry to change it for him.  We waited until noises in the street\ndied down, and then Ahmed was sent to report on developments.\n\n\"Abdul Ali has gone into the mejlis and the doors are closed,\" he\nannounced five minutes later.  That seemed to suit Anazeh\nperfectly, for his eyes lit up with satisfaction.  Evidently\nbeing excluded from the council was his meat and drink.  He gave\nno order, but rode forward and his men followed as a snake's tail\nfollows its head, four abreast, each man holding his rifle as\nbest suited him;  that gave them a much more warlike appearance\nthan if they had imitated the western model of exact conformity.\n\nWe rode down-street toward the castle at a walk, between very\ninterested spectators who knew enough to make way without being\ntold.  And at the castle gate we were challenged by a man on\nfoot, who commanded about twice our number of armed guards.\n\n\"The hour is passed,\" he announced.  \"The order is to admit no\nlate-comers.\"\n\n\"Who gives orders to me?\" Anazeh retorted.\n\n\"It was agreed by all the notables.\"\n\n\"I did not agree.  Wallah!  Thou dog of a devil's dung-heap, say\nyou I am not a notable?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless--\"\n\n\"Open that gate!\"\n\nThey opened it.  Two of the men began to do it even before their\nchief gave the reluctant order.  Anazeh started to ride through\nwith his men crowding behind.  But that, it seemed, was\naltogether too much liberty to take with the arrangements.\nShouting all together, the gate-guards surged in to take hold of\nbridles and force Anazeh's dependents back.  Teeth and eyes\nflashed.  It looked like the makings of a red-hot fight.\n\n\"No retainers allowed within the gate!  Principals only!\" roared\nthe captain of the guard, in Arabic that sounded like explosions\nof boiling oil.\n\nAnazeh, Mahommed ben Hamza and I were already within the\ncourtyard.  Four of Anazeh's followers made their way, through\nafter us before any one could prevent them.  At that moment there\ncame a tremendous clattering of hoofs and the crowd outside the\ngate scattered this and that way in front of about a hundred of\nthe other chiefs' dependents, who had dutifully stayed outside\nand had sought shade some little distance off.\n\nWhether the sudden disturbance rattled him, or whether he\nsupposed that all the other truculent ruffians were going to try\nto follow our example, at any rate the man on duty lost his head\nand shouted to his men to shut the gate again.  Before they could\ndo it every one of Anazeh's gang had forced his way through.\nThere we all were on forbidden ground, with a great iron-studded\ngate slammed and bolted behind us.  To judge by the row outside\nthe keepers of the gate had got their hands full.\n\nIn front of us was a short flight of stone steps, and another\ngreat wooden door set in stone posts under a Roman arch.  There\nwere only two armed men leaning against it.  They eyed Anazeh and\nour numbers nervously.\n\n\"Open!\"\n\nAnazeh could use his voice like a whip-crack.  They fumbled with\nthe great bolt and obeyed, swinging the door wide.  I thought for\na minute that my arrogant old protector meant to ride up the\nsteps and through the door into the mejlis hall with all his men;\nbut he was not quite so high-handed as that.\n\nAfter a good long look through the door, I suppose to make sure\nthere was no ambush inside waiting for him, he dismounted, and\nordered his men to occupy a stable-building across the courtyard,\nfrom which it would have been impossible to dislodge them without\na siege.  Then, when he had seen the last man disappear into it,\nhe led me and Mahommed ben Hamza up the steps.\n\nBen Hamza was grinning like a schoolboy, beside himself with\ndelight at the prospect of elbowing among notables, as well as\ninordinately proud of his new clothes and the smell of imported\nsoap that hung about him like an aura.  But Anazeh looked like an\nancient king entering into his own.  Surely there was never\nanother man who could stride so majestically and seem so\nconscious of his own ability to override all law.\n\nWe passed under the shadowy arch and down a cool stone passage to\nyet another heavy door that barred our way.  Anazeh thundered on\nit with his rifle-butt, for there were no attendants there to do\nhis bidding.  There was no answer.  Only a murmur of voices\nwithin.  So he thundered again, and this time the door opened\nabout six inches.  A face peered through the opening cautiously,\nand asked what was wanted.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Anazeh.  \"Is a mejlis held without my\npresence?  Since when?\"\n\n\"You are too late!\"\n\nThe face disappeared.  Some one tried to close the door.\nAnazeh's foot prevented.\n\n\"Open!\" he demanded.  The butt of his rifle thundered again on\nthe wood.\n\nThere was a babel of voices inside, followed by sudden silence.\nAnazeh made a sign to Mahommed ben Hamza and me.  We all three\nlaid our shoulders against the door and shoved hard.  Evidently\nthat was not expected;  it swung back so suddenly that we were\nhard put to it to keep our feet.  The man who had opened the door\nlay prone on the floor in front of us with his legs in the air,\nand Anazeh laughed at him--the bitterest sign of disrespect one\nArab can pay to another.\n\n\"Since when does the word of a Damascene exclude an honourable\nsheikh from a mejlis in El-Kerak?\" asked Anazeh, standing in\nthe doorway.\n\nHe was in no hurry to enter.  The dramatic old ruffian understood\ntoo well the value of the impression he made standing there.  The\nroom was crowded with about eighty men, seated on mats and\ncushions, with a piece of carpeted floor left unoccupied all down\nthe centre--a high-walled room with beautifully vaulted ceiling,\nand a mullioned window from which most of the glass was gone.\nThe walls were partly covered with Persian and other mats, but\nthere was almost no furniture other than water-pipes and little\ninlaid tables on which to rest coffee-cups and matches.  The air\nwas thick with smoke already, and the draft from the broken\nwindows wafted it about in streaky clouds.\n\nEvery face in the room was turned toward Anazeh.  I kept as much\nas possible behind him, for you can't look dignified in that\nsetting if all you have on is a stained golf suit, that you have\nslept in.  It seemed all right to me to let the old sheikh have\nall the limelight.\n\nBut he knew better.  Perhaps my erstwhile host ben Nazir had\nunderstood a little German after all.  More likely he had divined\nAbdul Ali's purpose to make use of me.  Certainly he had poured\nthe proper poison in Anazeh's ear, and the old man understood my\nvalue to a nicety.\n\nHe took me by the arm and led me in, Mahommed ben Hamza following\nlike a dog that was too busy wagging its tail to walk straight.\nYou would have thought Anazeh and I were father and son by\nthe way he leaned toward me and found a way for me among the\ncrowded cushions.\n\nHe had no meek notions about choosing a low place.  Expecting to\nbe taken at his own valuation, he chose a high place to begin\nwith.  There were several unoccupied cushions near the door, and\nthere were half-a-dozen servants busy in a corner with coffee-\npots and cakes.  He prodded one of the servants and ordered him\nto take two cushions to a place he pointed out, up near the\nwindow close to Abdul Ali.  There was no room there.  That\nwas the seat of the mighty.  You could not have dropped a\nhandkerchief between the men who wanted to be nearest the throne\nof influence.  But Anazeh solved that riddle.  He strode, stately\nand magnificent, up the middle of the carpet amid a mutter of\nimprecations.  And when one more than ordinarily indignant sheikh\ndemanded to know what he meant by it, he paused in front of him\nand laid his right hand on my shoulder.  (There was a loaded\nrifle in his left.)\n\n\"Who offers indignity to a distinguished guest?\" he demanded.\n\nThe question was addressed to everybody in the room.  He took\ncare they were all aware of it.  His stern eyes traveled from\nface to face.\n\n\"My men, who escorted him here, are outside the door.  They can\nenter and escort him away, if there are none here who understand\nhow to treat the stranger in our midst!\"\n\nThere was goose-flesh all over me, and I did not even try to look\nunembarrassed.  A man's wits, if he has any, work swiftly when he\nlooks like being torn to pieces at a moment's notice.  It seemed\nto me that the less insolent I appeared, the less likely they\nwere to vent their wrath on me.  I tried to look as if I didn't\nunderstand I was intruding--as if I expected a welcome.\n\n\"Good!\" Anazeh whispered in my ear.  \"You do well.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of remonstrance.  The sheikh who had dared to\nrebuke Anazeh found the resentment turned against himself.\nSomebody told him sharply to mend his manners.  Anazeh, shrewd\nold opportunist, promptly directed the servant to place cushions\non the edge of the carpet, in front of the first row of those\nwho wished to appear important.  That obliged the front rank\nto force the men behind them backward, closer to the wall, so\nthat room could be made for us without our trespassing on the\nforbidden gangway.\n\nSo I sat down in the front row, five cushions from Abdul Ali.\nAnazeh squatted beside me with his rifle across his knees.  Then\nMahommed ben Hamza forced himself down between me and the man on\nmy left, using his left elbow pretty generously and making the\nbest of the edges of two cushions.  As far as I could see there\nwere not more than half-a-dozen other men in the room who had\nrifles with them, although all had daggers, and some wore curved\nscimitars with gold-inlaid hilts.\n\nAs soon as I could summon sufficient nerve to look about me and\nmeet the brown, conjecturing eyes that did not seem to know\nwhether to resent my presence or be simply curious, I caught the\neye of Suliman ben Saoud in the front row opposite, ten or twelve\ncushions nearer the door than where I sat.  He did not seem to\nnotice me.  The absence of eyebrows made his face expressionless.\nHe didn't even vaguely resemble the Major James Grim whom I knew\nhim to be.  When his eyes met mine there was no symptom of\nrecognition.  If he felt as nervous as I did he certainly did not\nshow it behind his mask of insolent indifference.\n\nThere was still a good deal of muttered abuse being directed at\nAnazeh.  The atmosphere was electric.  It felt as if violence\nmight break out any minute.  Abdul Ali seemed more nervous than\nany one else;  he rocked himself gently on his cushion, as if\nchurning the milk of desire into the butter of wise words.\nSuddenly he turned to the sheikh on his left, a handsome man of\nmiddle age, who wore a scimitar tucked into a gold-embroidered\nsash, and whispered to him.\n\nBen Hamza whispered to me:  \"That sheikh to whom Abdul Ali speaks\nis Ali Shah al Khassib, the most powerful sheikh in these parts.\nA great prince.  A man with many followers.\"\n\nAli Shah al Khassib called for prayer to bring the mejlis to\norder.  He was immensely dignified.  The few words he pronounced\nabout asking God to bless the assembled notables with wisdom, in\norder that they might reach a right decision, would have been\nperfectly in place in the Capitol at Washington, or anywhere else\nwhere men foregather to decide on peace or war.\n\nAt once a muballir* on his left opened a copy of the Koran on a\ncushion on his lap and began to read from it in a nasal singsong.\nThere were various degrees of devoutness, and even of inattention\nshown by those who listened.  Some knelt and prostrated\nthemselves.  Others, including Anazeh, sat bolt upright, closing\ntheir eyes dreamily at intervals.  Over the way, Jim Suliman ben\nSaoud Grim was especially formally devout.  His very life\nundoubtedly depended on being recognized as a fanatic of\nfanatics. [*A Moslem priest who recites prayers.]\n\nBut there were three Christian sheikhs in the room.  One of them\nopposite me pulled out a Bible and laid it on the carpet as a\nsort of challenge to the Koran.  It was probably a dangerous\nthing to do, although most Moslems respect the Bible as a very\nsacred book.  The manner in which it was done suggested\ndeliberate effort to provoke a quarrel.\n\nMahommed ben Hamza, dividing his time like a schoolboy in chapel\nbetween staring about him and attending by fits and starts,\nnudged me in the ribs and whispered:\n\n\"See that Christian!  He would not dare do that, only on this\noccasion they like to think that Moslems and Christians are\nagreeing together.\"\n\nThe man who was reading to himself from the Bible looked up and\ncaught my eye.  He tapped the book with his finger and nodded, as\nmuch as to ask why I did not join him.  At once I pulled my own\nfrom my pocket.  He smiled acknowledgment as I opened it at\nrandom.  Certainly he thought I did it to support his tactlessly\nill-timed assertion of his own religion.  Very likely my action,\nsince I was a guest and therefore not to be insulted, saved\nhim from violence.  Incipient snarls of fanatical indignation\ndied away.\n\nBut as a matter of fact my eye was on Jim Suliman ben Saoud Grim.\nAs the reading from the Koran came to an end amid a murmur of\nresponses from all the sheikhs, the crooked-faced Ichwan sat\nupright.  In his sullen, indifferent way, he stared leisurely\nalong the line until his eyes rested on me.\n\nAs his eyes met mine I marked the place where the Bible was open\nwith a pencil, and closed the book, suspecting that he might be\nglad to know where a pencil could be found in a contingency.\n\nHe did not smile.  The expression of his face barely changed.\nJust for a second I thought I saw a flicker of amused approval\npass over the corners of his eyes and mouth.\n\nSo I left the book lying where it was with the pencil folded\nin it.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\n\"He will say next that it was he who set the stars in the sky\nover El-Kerak, and makes the moon rise!\"\n\n\nAli Shah al Khassib was the first to speak.  He was heard to the\nend respectfully, none interrupting.  But it seemed obvious from\ntheir faces that not a few sheikhs were disposed to question both\nhis leadership and most of what he said.  Mahommed ben Hamza kept\nup a running whisper of interpretation, breathing into my ear\nuntil it was wet with condensed breath.  I had to use a\nhandkerchief repeatedly.\n\nAli Shah al Khassib made no definite proposal.  He said that a\nman whom they all knew well had brought news to the effect that\nEmir Feisul was ready to make war on the French in order to drive\nthem out of Syria.  That in a case like that, of Moslems against\nkafirs,* there could be no question on which side their hearts or\ntheir interests lay.  That several dependable men had brought\nword of great unrest in Palestine.  That in all likelihood the\nBritish would send their army to help the French, in which case\nthe Arabs of Palestine were likely to rise in rebellion in the\nBritish army's rear.  That was the situation.  They were invited\nto consider it, and to decide what action, if any, seemed called\nfor. [*Unbelievers.]\n\nHe sat down without having risked his leadership by any statement\nof his own attitude.  He had simply reported facts that he\nbelieved to be true--facts that many of the notables plainly did\nnot yet believe, or believed only in part.  There followed a\nperfect babel of argument, during which the servants passed the\ncoffee and cakes around.  After that, during every interval\nbetween speeches there was more coffee and more cakes--wonderful\ncakes made with honey and almonds, immensely filling;  but the\nmore full an Arab gets of stodgy food the more his tongue wags,\nuntil at last he talks himself to sleep.\n\nFor ten minutes men were shouting their opinions to one another\nto and fro across the room.  From what I could make of it there\nwas not a man who did not advocate putting the whole of Palestine\nto the sword forthwith.  But it was noticeable that when their\nturns came to stand up and address the mejlis their advocacy was\nconsiderably toned down.  Everybody seemed to want somebody else\nto father the proposal for a raid, although every man pretended\nto be anxious to take part in one.\n\nOld Anazeh on my right sat in grim silence, quizzing each talker\nin turn with puckered eyes.  The only comment he made was a sort\nof internal rumbling, suggestive of the preliminary notice of\nan earthquake.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes Sheikh Ali Shah al Khassib brought\nproceedings a step forward by calling for confirmation of the\nnews of unrest in Palestine.  Man after man got up, and, since he\nwas speaking of others, not of himself, painted the discontent of\nthe Palestinians in lurid terms.  Each man tried to outvie the\nother.  The first man said they were anxious regarding the\nZionists and keen for a solution of the problem.  The second said\nthey hated the Zionists, and could see no way out of their\npredicament but by rebellion.  The third said that no Arab in\nPalestine could eat for thinking of the Zionist outrage, and that\nthe heart of every man in El-Kerak should bleed for his\ndistressed brethren.\n\nTo judge by what the fourth and fifth and sixth said, Palestine\nwas in a state of scarcely suppressed rebellion, and every living\nArab in the country was sharpening his sword in secret for the\nbutchering of Zionists at the first opportunity.  The seventh man\nsaid that the Palestine Arabs had never under Turkish rule\nsuffered and groaned as they did under the British, and that\ntheir cry was going up to heaven for relief from the ignominious\ntyranny of Zionist pretensions.\n\nAli Shah al Khassib chose that ringing appeal as the cue for his\nnext move in the game.  He called on Sheikh Abdul Ali, \"as well\nknown in Damascus as in this place,\" to address the mejlis.\n\nThere was instant silence.  Even the coffee cups ceased rattling.\nAbdul Ali got to his feet with the manner of a man long used to\nswaying assemblies.  He had just the right air of authority;\nexactly the right suggestion of deference;  the quiet smile of\nthe man with secrets up his sleeve;  and he paused just long\nenough before speaking to whet curiosity and fix attention.\n\nHe did not speak floridly or fast, and he indulged in none of\nthose flights of oratory that most Arabs love.  There was ample\ntime between his sentences for Mahommed ben Hamza to translate\ninto my wet and itching ear.  But every sentence of his speech\nhad measured weight in it, and every word he used was chosen for\nits poison or its sting.\n\nHe began by reminding them of the war and of Emir Feisul's share\nin it.  Of how they, and their fathers, and their sons had fought\nbehind Feisul and helped to establish him in Damascus.  Then he\nspoke of the British promise that the Arabs' should have a\nkingdom of their own, with Damascus for its capital and borders\nto include all the peoples of Arab blood in the Near East.  He\npaused for a full minute after that.  Then:\n\n\"But the French are in Syria.  The French, who also promised us\nan Arab kingdom.  They have assembled at the coast an army that\nalready threatens Emir Feisul.  The British are in Palestine,\nwhere they are admitting a horde of Zionist Jews to displace us\nArabs, rightful owners of the soil.  The British are also in\nMesopotamia, which they have seized for themselves for the sake\nof the oil which Allah, in His wisdom, created beneath the\nfertile earth.  Feisul makes ready to defend Syria against the\nFrench.  But the British will march to the aid of the French.\nCan anybody tell me how much of that promise to us Arabs has been\nkept, by either nation, French or British?\"\n\nSo far he was on thoroughly safe ground.  A man who preached\nagainst the French could hardly be suspected of being hired by\nthe French to do it.  There was nobody there but he who could say\nwhat Feisul's intentions actually were.  You can say what you\nlike against the British anywhere, at any time, and find some one\nto believe what you say.  And it needed no wizardry to prove that\nthe Allies had broken every promise they ever made to the Arabs.\n\n\"Are you going to sit idle, and let Emir Feisul and the Syrians\nfight the French alone?\" he asked, and paused again.\n\nThere was a great deal of murmuring--not quite all of it, I\nthought, entirely in his favour.\n\n\"What is the alternative to sitting still like camels waiting to\nbe doubly burdened?  If you raid Palestine, the local Arabs will\nall rise to your assistance.  The throat of every Zionist from\nthe Lebanon to Beersheba will be cut.  There will be plunder\nbeyond reckoning.  And you will help Feisul by holding back the\nBritish army from marching to the assistance of the French.  The\nquestion is, are you men?--are you Arabs?--are you true Moslems?\n--or do you like to look down from these heights of El-Kerak over\nthe home of your ancestors in the hands of so-called Zionists who\nare nothing but Jews, under a new name?\"\n\nHe sat down before any one could answer him, and whispered to Ali\nShah al Khassib, who called on another man to speak at once.  It\nwas a pretty obvious piece of concerted strategy, but he got by\nwith it for the moment.  The general feeling seemed to be in\nfavour of a raid if only some one would start it.  Nobody seemed\nto mind much how the decision was arrived at, so long as the\nresponsibility was passed to some one else.\n\nThe man now called on was a smooth-tongued, tall, lean individual\nwith shifty eyes, and a flow of talk of the coffeeshop variety.\nAt the end of his first sentence any fool would have known that\nhe had been put up to quiz Abdul Ali, in order that Abdul Ali\nmight have an excuse to justify himself.  He attacked him very\nmildly, with much careful hedging and apologetic gesture, on the\nground that possibly the Damascene was ignoring their interests\nwhile urging them to take action that would suit his own.\n\nEven with that mild criticism he set loose quite a murmur of\nminority agreement.  For the first time since the speech-making\nbegan Anazeh barked approval.  I thought for a moment the old man\nwas going to get to his feet.  But Abdul Ali was up again first,\nand launched on the seas of self-esteem.\n\nIf I had not listened to equally childish political maneuvers in\nthe States, and seen them succeed for the reason that people who\nwant something want also to be fooled into getting it by special\narguments, it would have seemed incredible that a man, who had\nrecently boasted of statesmanship, should dare to make such a\npublic ass of himself.  Yet, for fifteen minutes he carried the\nwhole meeting with him, and the warmth of his self-satisfied\nemotion made him ooze resplendent sweat.\n\n\"Now he speaks of you, effendi,\" Mahommed ben Hamza whispered;\nand in confirmation of it Anazeh clutched my arm, as if to keep\nthe tide of eloquence from washing me away.\n\nHad the British done anything for the country this side of\nJordan?  Anything for the people's education, for instance?  No!\nInstead, they had taken away the missionaries.  Better than\nnothing were those missionaries.  They had their faults.  They\nundermined religion.  But they taught.  And the British had\ncalled them in, giving some ridiculous excuse about danger.  It\nhad remained then for him--Abdul Ali of Damascus and of El-Kerak\n--the same individual who was now urging them to strike for their\nown advantage--to take the first step for the establishment in\nEl-Kerak of a school that should be independent of the British.\nHe, Abdul Ali, greatly daring because he had the interest of El-\nKerak at heart, had introduced that day into the mejlis a\ndistinguished guest from the United States, whose sole desire--\nwhose only object in life--whose altruistic and divine ambition\nwas to establish an American secular school in El-Kerak!\n\nHe sat down, glowing with super-virtue.  And then the fur flew.\nAnazeh was first on his feet.\n\n\"Princes!\" he shouted.  \"That Damascene is a father of lies!  It\nwas I, Anazeh, who brought this man hither!  That corrupter of\nhonesty, who doles out other people's gold for bidden purposes,\nseeks to appear as your benefactor!\"  (It was fairly obvious that\nAnazeh had not received any of the gold.)  \"He will say next that\nit was he who set the stars in the sky over El-Kerak, and makes\nthe moon rise!  He is a foreigner, a father of snakes, and a\nborn liar!\"\n\nAnazeh refused to sit down again, but stood with rifle on his\narm, daring any one to challenge his statements.  Abdul Ali\nflushed angrily, but laughed aloud.  The next man on his feet was\nben Nazir, my erstwhile host, who had repudiated me.  And he\nrepudiated me all over again, accusing me of abusing his\nhospitality by going over to Abdul Ali, who had never even heard\nof me before I came to El-Kerak.\n\nThere was no making head or tail of the storm of abuse and\ncounter-abuse that followed, except that it did not look healthy\nfor me.  There seemed to be four or five different factions, all\nof whom regarded me as the bone of contention.  Rather than\nbetray anxiety I opened the Bible and began to make dots under\nletters, spelling out a message to Grim to the effect that I had\nno notion where to find lodgings for the night, and that if\nAnazeh elected to carry me off I should have to go with him.\n\nI did not know how to get the message to him without arousing\nsuspicion and making matters worse than they were, and it seemed\nbest not to call attention to the fact that I was writing.  So I\nmade a few dots at a time, and looked about me.  I saw Abdul Ali,\nlaughing cynically, make a gesture with his arm as if he\nconsigned me to the dogs.  Then I caught Grim's eye--Suliman ben\nSaoud's.  He, too, was making capital of my predicament.\n\nHe had got the attention of the men around him, and was pointing\nat the Bible while he reeled off a string of an angry rhetoric\nthat sounded like a cat-fight.  He shouted at me, and made angry\ngestures;  but I knew that if he wanted me to understand his\nsignals he would never make them openly, so I ignored them.\n\n\"The sheikh from Arabia demands to see the book,\" said Mahommed\nben Hamza in my ear.\n\nI passed it over the carpet with the pencil folded in it at the\npage I had begun to mark;  and the men opposite handed it along,\nwith remarks they considered appropriate.  Jim Suliman ben Saoud\nGrim seized the book angrily, glared at it, denounced it, and\nwrote something on the fly-leaf.  He showed it to the men beside\nhim, and they laughed, nodding approval.  He wrote again.  They\napproved again.  He turned and talked to them.  Then, as if he\nhad an afterthought, he wrote a third time.  When they wanted to\nlook at that he ran the pencil through it and wrote something\nelse on the other side of the fly-leaf, at which they all\nlaughed uproariously.  Presently he tossed the book back to me\nwith all the outward signs of contempt that a fanatic can show\nfor another religion.\n\nI have kept that Bible as a souvenir, with the verses from the\nKoran written on the flyleaf in Arabic in Grim's fine hand.\nUnderneath them, in Greek characters with a pencil line scrawled\nthrough them, is the only sentence that interested me at the\nmoment:\n\n\"This looks good.  Keep Anazeh quiet and sober.\"\n\nAnazeh was beginning to hold forth again, shaking his fist\nat Abdul Ali and making the roof echo to his mighty bellowing.\nI tugged at the skirt of his cloak, and after a minute he\nsat down to discover what I wanted.  He seemed to think I\nneeded reassurance.  He began to flood me with promises of\nprotection.  It was about a minute before I could get a word\nin edgeways.  Then:\n\n\"Jimgrim says,\" said I.\n\n\"Jimgrim!  Is he here?\"\n\n\"He surely is.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"We have a sign. Jimgrim says, 'Be quiet, and drink no\nstrong drink.'\"\n\nHe leaned across to Mahommed ben Hamza, doubting his ears and my\nArabic.  I repeated the message, and ben Hamza translated.\n\n\"I don't believe Jimgrim is here!\" said Anazeh.  \"I would know\nhim among a million.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said ben Hamza, grinning from ear to ear, \"for I\nmyself know where he sits!\"\n\n\"Where then?\" Anazeh demanded excitedly.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" said I, and ben Hamza grinned again.\n\n\"He is my friend.  I say nothing,\" he answered.\n\nAnazeh put in the next five minutes minutely examining every face\nwithin range, while the din of argument rose louder and more\nviolent than ever, and suspicion of me seemed to be gaining.\n\nBut suddenly Suliman ben Saoud got to his feet and there was\nsilence.  They were all willing to listen to a member of the\nIchwan sect, for the news of its power and political designs had\nspread wherever men talk Arabic.  He spoke gutturally in a\ndialect that ben Hamza did not find it any too easy to follow, so\nI only got the general gist of Grim's remarks.\n\nHe said that he had much experience of raids and of making\npreparations for them.  A raid aimed at the Zionists--at this\nmoment--might be good--perhaps.  They were better judges of that\nthan he.  But it was all-important to know who was in favour of\nthe raid, and exactly why.  The words men spoke were not nearly\nso impressive as the deeds they did.  Therefore, when the\nillustrious Sheikh Abdul Ali of Damascus urged a raid on the one\nhand, and boasted of provision for a school in El-Kerak on the\nother, it would be well to examine this foreign effendi,   whom\nAbdul Ali claimed to have introduced.  The claim was disputed,\nbut the claim was not made for nothing.  In his judgment, based\non vast experience of politics in Arabia, motives were seldom on\nthe surface.  All depended on the motives of the illustrious\nAbdul Ali.  This stranger from America--he glared balefully at\nme--should be investigated thoroughly.  As a man of vast\nexperience with the interests of El-Islam at heart, he offered\nrespectfully to examine this stranger thoroughly with the aid of\nan interpreter.  He confessed to certain suspicions;  should they\nprove unfounded, then it might be reasonable to credit the rest\nof Abdul Ali's statements;  if not, no.  He was willing, if the\nhonourable mejlis saw fit, to take the stranger aside and put\nmany questions to him.\n\nWhen he had finished you could actually physically feel the\nsuspicion directed at me.  It was like a cold wind.  Anazeh was\njust as conscious of it, and muttered something about its being\ntime to go.  Abdul Ali got up and asked indignantly why the\nIchwan from so far away should have such an important voice;  he\nhimself stood there ready to answer all questions.  Suliman ben\nSaoud retorted sourly that he proposed to question the Damascene\nin public after privately interrogating me.\n\n\"They shall not interfere with you!  You are in my charge,\"\nAnazeh growled in my ear.  \"I will summon my men at the\nfirst excuse.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim says, 'Be quiet!'\" I answered.\n\nThere was another uproar.  Ali Shah al Khassib openly took the\npart of Abdul Ali.  A dozen men demanded to know how much he had\nbeen paid to do it.  Finally, Suliman ben Saoud beckoned me.  I\ngot up, and with Mahommed ben Hamza at my heels I followed him to\na narrow door in a side wall that opened on a stone stairway\nleading to the ramparts.  Anazeh' came too, growling like a\nhungry bear, and after a couple of blood-curdling threats hurled\nat Suliman ben Saoud's back he took up position in the open door,\nfacing the crowd, and dared any one to try to follow.  He seemed\nto have confidence in Mahommed ben Hamza's ability to protect me,\nif necessary, on the roof.\n\nThe roof and ramparts appeared deserted.  They were in the\nruinous state to which the Turks reduce everything by sheer\nneglect, and in which Arabs, blaming the Turks, seemed quite\ndisposed to leave things.  The Ichwan led the way to the\nsouthwest corner, peering about him to make sure no guards were\nin hiding, or asleep behind projecting buttresses.  Overhead the\nkites were wheeling against a pure blue sky.  The Dead Sea lay\nand smiled below us, with the gorgeous, treeless Judean Hills\nbeyond.  Through the broken window of the hall came the clamour\nof arguing men.\n\n\"O, Jimgrim!\" grinned Mahommed ben Hamza when we reached\nthe corner.\n\nGrim turned and faced us with folded arms, leaning his back\nagainst the parapet.\n\nBen Hamza continued:  \"You are a very prince of dare-devils!  One\nword from me--one little word, and they would fling you down into\nthe moat for the vultures to feed on!\"\n\n\"I remember a time,\" Grim answered, \"when a word from me saved\nyou from hanging.\"\n\n\"True, father of good fortune!  But a man must laugh.  I\nwill hold my tongue in El-Kerak like a tomb that has not\nbeen plundered!\"\n\n\"You'd better!  You've work to do.  Where are your men?\"\n\n\"All where I can find them.\"\n\n\"Good.  You'll get turned out of the mejlis presently.  Look down\ninto the moat now.\"\n\nWe all peered over.  The lower ramp of the wall sloped steeply,\nbut all the way up the sharp southwest corner the stones were\nbroken out, and a goat, or a very active man could find foothold.\n\n\"Could you climb that?\"\n\n\"Surely.  Remember, Jimgrim, when I climbed the wall of El-Kudz\n(Jerusalem) to escape from the police!\"\n\n\"Bring your men into the moat between dark and moonrise.  Have a\nlong rope with you--a good one.  You and two men climb up here\nand hide.  The remainder wait below.  Oh, yes;  and bring a wheat\nsack--a new, strong one.  You may have to wait for several hours.\nWhen you see me, take your cue from me;  but whatever happens, no\nmurder!  You understand?  Nobody's to be killed.\"\n\nBen Hamza grinned and nodded.  He seemed to be one of those good-\nnatured rogues who ask nothing better than the sheer sport of\nlawless hero-worship.  He would have made a perfect chief of\nstaff for any brigand, provided the brigand took lots of chances.\n\n\"You'll be killed, if anybody finds you up here after dark!  You\nrealize that?\"\n\n\"Trust me.\"\n\nGrim nodded.  He was good at trusting people, when he had to, and\nwhen the selection was his own.\n\n\"Affairs seem to be drifting nicely,\" he said, turning to me.\n\"It's best not to let Anazeh know who I am just yet, if that can\nbe helped.  But if you must, when the time comes, you'll have to\ntell him.  Do keep him sober.  After the evening prayer there'll\nbe a banquet;  if he gets drunk we're done for.  I'm going to\nmake you out an awful leper, if you don't mind.  They may yell\nfor your hide and feathers before I've finished, but Anazeh will\nprotect you.  If he leaves the hall in a huff, don't make any\nbones about going with him.  Let him ride out of town and wait\nfor me about two miles down the track, at the point where that\ntomb stands above a narrow pass between two big rocks.  Do you\nremember it?\"\n\n\"What if he won't wait?\"\n\n\"He must!  Tell him I'll have a prisoner with me;  then he'll be\ncurious.  But you can bet on old Anazeh when he's sober.  But\nthings may turn out so that it's simpler for you to stay and see\nthis through with me.  In that case you must persuade him to go\nwithout you, after explaining to him just where he's to wait.\"\n\n\"How shall I do that?\" I said. \"I haven't enough Arabic.\"\n\n\"I'll write it,\" he answered.  \"Give me that pencil.\"\n\n\"Say something, too, then about his keeping sober.\"\n\nGrim nodded, and wrote quite a long letter in Arabic on a page of\nmy notebook.\n\n\"The next move,\" he said, as I pocketed the letter, \"is for me to\nget Abdul Ali's goat:  I think--and I hope--he'll try to bribe\nme.  If he does, he's my meat!  The whole question of raid or no\nraid hangs on their confidence in him.  If I throw suspicion on\nhim, and he disappears directly afterwards, they'll abandon the\nplan, confiscate his goods and chattels, and quarrel among\nthemselves instead of raiding Palestine.  Get me?\"\n\n\"Um-n-yes.  I've sat on a horse I was warned against--felt\nsafer--and gone to hospital at that.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"No hospitals up here!  It'll be soon over if they get wise to\nus.  But I think we're all right;  and you're almost certainly\nsafe.  But don't be tempted to talk.  Well--we've been up here\nlong enough for me to have put you through the third degree.\nBetter look a bit uncomfortable as you go down, as if I'd got\nunder your skin with some awkward questions.  You, too, ben\nHamza;  don't grin;  look afraid.\"\n\n\"I am not at all afraid, Jimgrim.  But I will try.\"\n\nGrim studied for a moment.\n\n\"Don't forget,\" he added, \"at the first suggestion that you're\nnot wanted, make yourself scarce, and go and round up your men.\nIf you're thrown out pretty roughly, keep your temper and run.\"\n\n\"Taht il-amr!\" (Yours to command.)\n\n\"Come on, then.  Let's go.\"\n\nThe sun was fairly low over the Judean Hills as we turned down\nthe narrow stairs and found Anazeh waiting at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\n\"Feet downwards, too afraid to yell!\"--\n\n\nAbdul Ali of Damascus was holding the floor again when we\nreturned.  He had abandoned the cold air of mysterious authority\nand secrets in reserve.  His claim to backstairs influence having\nbeen challenged, he had resorted to the emotional appeal that is\nthe simplest means of controlling any crowd of men anywhere.  The\ndemagog who can find a million men all responsive to the same\nemotion can swing them as easily as a hundred if he knows his\nbusiness.  Loot was the tune he harped, with the old Ishmael\nblood-lust by way of obbligato.\n\nHe had them by the heart-strings, and there were long-necked\nbottles of liquor that smelt of aniseed being passed from hand to\nhand.  We returned to our places almost unnoticed, and within the\nminute some one handed a full bottle to Anazeh;  the accompanying\ncup was big enough to hold any ordinary drunkard's breakfast, and\nthe old sheikh's eyes admired the size of it.\n\nI laid my hand on the wrist that held the bottle.  He shook it\noff angrily, and began to pour.  Grim, over the way, looked\nanxious.  It was up to me to play this hand, so I led my ace\nof trumps.\n\nSuddenly, and very clumsily, I rocked sideways to reach my hip-\npocket, contriving to jog his elbow and spill what was already in\nthe cup.  He turned his head to curse savagely, and I showed him\nthe folded sheet from my notebook.  His name was on it in Arabic:\n\n\"Sheikh Anazeh ben Mahmoud, from Jimgrim.\"\n\nHe seized it, setting the bottle down between his feet, where it\nwas instantly reached for by some one else and handed down the\nline.  Reading was evidently not Anazeh's favorite amusement, but\nhe knitted his brows over the letter and wrestled with it word by\nword, while Abdul Ali's fiery declamation made the vaulted roof\nresound.  I could only make out snatches of the appeal to\nsavagery--a word and a sentence here and there.\n\n\"Who are you, princes?  Men with swords, or slaves who must\nobey?--Raid over the Jordan twenty thousand strong!--What are\nJews?  Shall Jews take the home of your ancestors?  Who says so?\n--Let the Jews be buried in the land they come to steal!--You say\nthe Jews are cleverer than you.  Cut their heads off, then they\ncannot think!\"\n\n\"When did Jimgrim give you this?\" Anazeh demanded, folding the\nletter and stowing it in his bosom.\n\n\"That is the message that I told you would come later if\nyou waited.\"\n\n\"Do you know what is in the message?\"\n\n\"No.\"  That was perfectly true.  I had talked with Grim, but had\nnot read what he had written.\n\n\"He wishes me to go and wait for him in a certain place\"\n\n\"Why not do it?\"\n\n\"Rubbama.\" (Perhaps.)\n\n\"True-believers!  Followers of the Prophet!  Sons of warrior\nkings!\" thundered Abdul Ali.  \"Will you do nothing to help\nFeisul, a lineal descendant of the Prophet?  You have helped him\nto a throne.  Now strike to hold him there!\"\n\n\"Jimgrim says, I may go away and leave you here,\" growled Anazeh.\n\"What say you?\"\n\n\"Ala khatrak. (Please yourself.)  Jimgrim is wise.\"\n\n\"He is the father of wisdom.  Mashallah!  I will consider it.\nThere will be a banquet presently!\"\n\n\"And loot!  You can help yourselves!\" shouted Abdul Ali of\nDamascus.  Then he sat down amid a storm of applause.  Suliman\nben Saoud--Jimgrim--was on his feet before the tumult died away,\nand again they grew perfectly still to listen to him.  If an\nArab loves anything under heaven more than his own style of\nfighting, it is the action and reaction of debate.  I could\nnot understand a word of the mid-Arabian dialect, but Abdul\nAli's retorts were plain enough;  and from the way that Grim\npointed at me and Mahommed ben Hamza it was fairly easy to\nfollow what was happening.\n\nHe denounced me as possibly dangerous, and wondered why they\npermitted me to have an interpreter, who could whisper to me\neverything that was being said.\n\n\"Put out the interpreter!\" sneered Abdul Ali, and there was a\nchorus of approval.   Mahommed ben Hamza got up and hurried for\nthe door while the hurrying was good and painless to himself,\nthough it was hardly that to other people;  forcing his way\nbetween the close-packed notables he kicked more than one of them\npretty badly and grinned when they cursed him.  I saw Abdul Ali\nof Damascus whisper to one of his rose-coloured parasites, who\ngot up at once and made his way toward the door, too.\n\n\"The fellow is from Hebron,\" Abdul Ali sneered in a voice loud\nenough for all to hear.  \"It is best that he should not go back\nto Hebron to tell tales!  I have attended to it.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold.  I tried to catch Grim's eye, but he would not\nlook in my direction.  I wondered whether he had heard Abdul\nAli's threat.  It seemed to me that if Mahommed ben Hamza were\neither murdered or imprisoned Grim's whole chance of success was\ngone.  The danger would be multiplied tenfold.  Anazeh seemed the\nonly remaining hope.  The old-rose individual who followed ben\nHamza had not reached the door yet.\n\n\"How about your men?\" I asked.\n\n\"They are all right.\" Anazeh's eyes pursued the liquor bottle.\n\n\"Why not go and see?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Ilhamdul'illah, they are good men.  I know them.  If there is\ntrouble they will come and tell me.\"\n\nThe door opened softly.  The gorgeous old-rose parasite slipped\nthrough.  I had a mental vision of Mahommed ben Hamza lying face-\ndownward with his new coat stained with blood.  There was nothing\nfor it, it seemed, but the magic formula to move Anazeh.\n\n\"Jimgrim says, 'See that ben Hamza gets safely away!\"'\n\n\"Dog of a Hebron tanner's son--let him die!  What is that to me?\"\n\n\"It is Jimgrim's command.\"\n\n\"Wallahi haida fasl! (By God, this is a strange affair!)  Wait\nhere!\"\n\nOld Anazeh, with the name of the Prophet of God on his lips, cast\nan envious glare at the bottle of liquor and seized action by the\nforelock.  There was nothing to excite comment in his getting up\nto leave the room.  A dozen men had done that and come in again.\nHe strode out, straight down the middle of the carpet.  Suliman\nben Saoud--Jimgrim--went on talking, and to judge by Abdul Ali of\nDamascus' increasingly restless retorts he was getting that\ngentleman's goat as promised.  Finally Abdul Ali got to his feet\nand said that if the Ichwan would see him alone he would show him\ncertain documents that would satisfy him, but that it would not\nbe policy to produce them in public.  He offered to send for the\ndocuments, and to show them during or after the banquet.\n\nSo Jimgrim sat down, and there was a good deal of quiet nudging\nand nodding.  Every one seemed to understand that the Ichwan was\ngoing to be bribed;  they seemed to admire his ability to get for\nhimself a share of the funds that most of them had tapped.\n\nA man nearly opposite me leaned over and said in fairly good\nFrench, with the manner of a doctor assuring his patient that the\nworst is yet to come:\n\n\"It has been decided that you are to be detained here in the castle\nuntil there is no danger of your carrying away important news.\"\n\nWhile I was turning that over in my mind Anazeh came back,\ngrinning.  Something outside had tickled him immensely, but he\nwould not say anything.  He sat down beside me and chuckled into\nhis beard;  and when his neighbour on the right asked what had\namused him he turned the question into a bawdy joke.\n\n\"Did ben Hamza get away?\" I whispered.\n\nHe only nodded.  He continued chuckling until the man on duty by\nthe door announced to the \"assembled lords and princes\" that the\nmuezzin summoned them to prayer.  All except three Christian\nsheikhs trooped up the narrow stairway in Ali Shah al Khassib's\nwake, Anazeh going last with a half-serious joke about not caring\nto be stabbed in the back.\n\nI expected the three non-Moslems would take advantage of the\nopportunity to ask me a string of questions.  But they took\nexactly the opposite view of the situation.  They avoided me,\nwithdrawing into a corner by themselves.  I suppose they\nthought that to be seen talking to me was more risky than the\namusement merited.\n\nSo I went up to the ramparts, too, to watch the folk at prayer,\nminded to keep out of sight, for they don't like being regarded\nas a curious spectacle;  and on the way up I did something that\nmay have had a lot to do with our getting away alive, although I\ndid not give much thought to it and could hardly have explained\nmy motive at the time.\n\nThe door at the foot of the stairs opened inward.  It was almost\nexactly the same width as the stairway, so that when it stood\nwide open you could not have put your hand between its edge and\nthe stairway wall.  Lying on the floor of the hall within a few\nfeet of the nearest corner was a length of good sound olive-wood,\nabout three inches in thickness, roughly squared and not\nparticularly squared.  Having stepped on it accidentally, I\npicked it up, and discovered more by accident than intention that\nit was longer than the width of the stairway.  Then I noticed a\nnotch in the stairway wall.  Behind the opened door there was a\ndeeper notch in the opposite wall.  There was no lock on the\ndoor, no bolt.  That length of wood had been cut to fit\nhorizontally from notch to notch across the passage.  Once that\nbeam was fitted in its place, whoever wished to reach the roof\nwould have to burn or batter down the door.  I moved the door and\nplaced the length of olive-wood on end behind it.\n\nI found the view from the ramparts much more interesting than the\nsoul-saving formalities of eighty or so potential cut-throats.\nWhile they prayed I stood watching the shadows deepen in the\nJordan Valley, as no doubt Joshua once watched them from\nsomewhere near that same spot before he marshalled his invading\nhost.  You could understand why people who had wandered forty\nyears in a stark and howling wilderness should yearn for those\ncoloured, fertile acres between the Jordan and the sea:  why they\nshould be willing to fight for them, die for them, do anything\nrather than turn back.\n\nBy the time we had filed down--Anazeh last again--the servants\nhad nearly finished spreading a banquet.  What looked like bed-\nsheets had been laid along the strip of carpet, and, the whole\nlength of them was piled with all imaginable things to eat, from\ncakes and fruit to whole sheep roasted and seethed in camel's\nmilk and honey.  There were no less than six sheep placed at\nintervals along the \"table,\" with mountains of rice, scow-loads\nof apricots cooked in various ways, and a good sized flock of\nchickens spitted and smeared with peppery sauce.  At a guess, I\nshould say there were several pounds of meat, about two chickens,\nand a peck of rice per man, with apricots and raisins added;  but\nthey faced the prospect like heroes.\n\nPerhaps what helped them face it was the sight of sundry bottles\nbearing labels more familiar in the West.  Abdul Ali of Damascus,\nlicking his lips like a cat that smells canary, took his place on\na cushion up near the window again on the right of Ali Shah al\nKhassib, who was only the nominal host.  Abdul Ali left no doubt\nin anybody's mind as to who was paying for the feast.  It was he\nwho gave orders to the servants in a bullying tone of voice;  he\nwho begged every one be seated.\n\nAnazeh looked at the bottles of brandy--looked at me--and prayed\nunder his breath;  or, at any rate, it looked and sounded like a\nprayer.  He may have been swearing.  He and I were not very far\nfrom the door;  the seats near the head of the table had all been\ntaken.  I sat down at once, so as not to be conspicuous, but\nAnazeh remained standing so long that at last Abdul Ali called to\nhim to sit down and eat his fill, using the offensively\nmagnanimous tone of voice that some men can achieve without an\neffort.  I think Anazeh had been waiting for just that opening.\n\n\"I have twenty men outside,\" he announced.  \"Shall I eat, and\nnot they?\"\n\n\"This is a feast for notables,\" said Abdul Ali.\n\n\"A little bread with my own men is better than meat and drink at\na traitor's table,\" Anazeh answered. \"Wallahi! (By God!)  I go to\neat with honest men!\"  He laid a hand on my head.  \"Ye have said\nthis effendi must stay in the castle.  Well and good.  Whoever\nharms him or offers him indignity shall answer to me and my men\nfor it!\"  He bowed to me like a king taking leave of his court.\n\"Lailtak sa'idi.  Allah yifazak, effendi!\" (Good night. God keep\nyou, effendi!)  With that he stalked out, and the door slammed\nshut behind him.  Everybody, including Abdul Ali, laughed.\n\nThe banquet was a boresome business--an interminable competition\nto see who could eat and drink the most.  With my interpreter\ngone, and everybody else too busy guzzling to trouble to speak\ndistinctly for my benefit, I had to depend on my ayes for\ninformation and naturally used them to the utmost.  I noticed\nthat Abdul All of Damascus, Jimgrim Suliman ben Saoud and myself\nwere the only men in the room, servants included, who ate and\ndrank within the bounds of decency and reason.  One of the\nservants, walking up and down the table-cloth with brandy and\nrelays of vegetables, was drunk very early in the game and had to\nbe thrown out.\n\nAbdul Ali kept conversation going on the subject of the raid.\nThe more the brandy bottles circulated the easier he found it to\nkeep enthusiasm burning.  He talked about me, too, several times,\nand every time that subject cropped up all eyes turned in my\ndirection.  I think he was making the most of the school idea,\nmixing up the raid with education and serving the mixture hot, as\nit were, with brandy sauce.\n\nBut over the way, about half-way down the table, the Ichwan\nSuliman ben Saoud, dead-cold-sober and abstemious, as befitted a\nfanatic, was talking, too.  He was quite evidently talking\nagainst Abdul Ali, so that the Damascene kept looking at him with\na troubled expression.  He glanced frequently at the door, too,\nas if he expected some one who could put an end to Suliman ben\nSaoud's intrigue.\n\nBut it was a long time before the door opened and the second of\nhis old-rose parasites came in.  I had not noticed until then\nthat the man was missing.  He thrust a packet of some sort into\nAbdul Ali's hands.  He whispered.  The Damascene's face darkened\ninstantly, and he swore like a pirate.  Then, I suppose because\nhe had to vent his wrath on somebody, he shouted to me in German\nall down the length of the table:\n\n\"Your cursed interpreter has nearly killed my secretary!  He\nstruck him in the mouth and knocked all his teeth out.  What\ncourteous servants you employ!\"\n\n\"What was your secretary trying to do to him?\" I retorted, but he\nsaw fit not to answer that.  He poured some more brandy instead\nfor Ali Shah al Khassib.\n\nSo that was what Anazeh had been laughing at!  The old humourist\nhad either seen the fracas, or had come on the injured old-rose\nmessenger of death nursing a damaged face.  I began to share\nGrim's good opinion of ben Hamza.  But though I watched Grim's\nface, and knew that he knew German, I could not detect a trace of\ninterest.  He kept on talking against Abdul Ali until after ten\no'clock.  By that time most of the notables were about as full as\nthey could hold.  Those who were not too drunk appeared ready for\nanything in or out of reason.\n\nAt that stage of the proceedings they ushered in the dancing\ngirls.  The servants cleared away most of the food, removed the\ntable-cloths, and a ring was formed practically all around the\nroom, the notables leaning their backs against the wall to ease\noverworked bellies.  I set my cushion down next to a very drunken\nman just by the narrow door that opened on the stairway leading\nto the ramparts.  He fell asleep with his head on my shoulder\nwithin five minutes, and as that, for some subtle reason, seemed\nto make me even more unnoticeable I let him snore away in peace.\n\nOver in Abdul Ali's corner of the room there was a real council\nof war going on in whispers.  Opposite to him, ten paces or so\ndistant from me, Jimgrim Suliman ben Saoud was holding a rival\nshow.  It seemed about an even bet which was making greater\nheadway.  Those who were more or less drunk, and all the younger\nsheikhs had eyes and ears for nothing but the dancing girls.\n\nThey were outrageous hussies.  They wore more clothes than a\nBroadway chorus lady, and rather less paint, but if they were\nsymbols of the Moslem paradise (as a learned Arab once assured me\nthat they are meant to be) then, as I answered the Arab on that\noccasion, \"me for hell.\"  But none of those sheikhs had ever seen\nBroadway, so you could hardly blame them.\n\nAbdul Ali of Damascus seemed to have his arrangements with the\nmen in his corner cinched at last to his satisfaction.  He walked\na little unsteadily across the room, apparently to make his peace\nwith Suliman ben Saoud.  He held brazenly in one hand a leather\nwallet that bulged with paper money--doubtless the \"documents\"\nthat he had sent for.  He nodded to me as he passed with\nmore familiarity than he had any right to, since he had so\nostentatiously dismissed me to the dogs.  I suppose he felt so\nsure of \"convincing\" Suliman ben Saoud, and was so bent on\noffsetting the reaction caused by Anazeh's behavior that he had\nbeen reviving that project about the school and therefore chose\nto appear on intimate terms with me.  I met him more than\nhalf-way;  any one who cared to might believe I loved him like\na brother.\n\nHe stood in front of Suliman ben Saoud, rocking just a trifle\nfrom the effects of alcohol and smoke,  and there was about five\nminutes' conversation of which, although I missed a lot of it, I\ncaught the general drift.  The men who had come under the\nIchwan's influence kept joining in and raising objections.  I\ngathered that they expected a proportionate percentage of the\nbribe for which Suliman ben Saoud was supposed to be maneuvering.\n\nBut even Abdul Ali, with a pouch of paper money in his hand, was\nnot quite so barefaced as to bribe the Ichwan publicly.  At the\nend of five minutes he suggested a private talk on the parapet.\nSuliman ben Saoud rose with apparent reluctance.  Abdul Ali of\nDamascus took his arm.  It was Suliman ben Saoud who opened the\nnarrow door, and Abdul Ali who went through first.  I did not\nwait for any invitation, but let my snoring neighbor fall on his\nside, hurried through after them, and closed the door behind me.\nGroping for the stick in the dark, I jammed it into the notches.\nIt fitted perfectly.  It held the door immovable and barred\nthat stairway against all-comers.  Then I followed them to\nthe parapet.\n\nThe moon was about full and bathing the whole roof, and all the\ncountryside in liquid light.  There was a certain amount of mist\nlower down, and you could only make out the Dead Sea through it\nhere and there;  but up where we were, and even in the moat\neighty feet below us, it was almost like daylight without the\nglare and heat.  I leaned over, but could see nobody in the moat,\nand there was no sign of Mahommed ben Hamza.\n\nAbdul Ali led the way toward the corner where Grim had given his\norders to ben Hamza that afternoon.  Abdul Ali did not seem to\nrealize that I was following.  When he turned at last, with his\nback to the parapet and the moonlight full in his face, he\ndemanded in German:\n\n\"Wass machen Sie hier?\"\n\nI was about to answer him when there came a noise like\nsubterranean thunder from the mouth of the stairway.  They were\ntrying to force that door below and follow us.  The first words I\nused were in English, for Grim's benefit:\n\n\"I stuck a stick in the door.  I should say it's good for ten or\nfifteen minutes unless they use explosives.\"\n\nThat gave the whole game away at once.\n\n\"So!\" said Abdul Ali.  He thrust the wallet into his bosom.  With\nthe other hand he pulled out a repeating pistol.  \"So!\"\n\nGrim said never a word.  He closed with him.  In a second we were\nall three struggling like madmen.  The pistol was not cocked;  I\nmanaged to get hold of Abdul Ali's wrist and wrench the weapon\naway before he could pull back the slide.  Then we all three went\ndown together on the stone roof, Abdul Ali yelling like a maniac,\nand Grim trying to squeeze the wind out of him.  Even then, as we\nrolled and fought, I could still hear the thundering on the door.\nNo doubt the noise they made prevented them from hearing Abdul\nAli's yells for help.\n\nThe man's strength was prodigious, although he was puffy and\nshort-winded.  It began to look as if we would have to knock him\non the head to get control of him.  But even so, there was no\nrope--no sign of Mahommed ben Hamza and his men.  You can think\nof a lot of things while you fight for your life eighty miles\naway from help.  I wondered whether Grim would throw him over the\nparapet, and whether we two would have to take our chance of\nmountaineering down that ragged corner of the wall.\n\nBut suddenly about a hundred and eighty pounds of human brawn\nlanded feet-first on my back.  A voice said \"Taib,* Jimgrim!\" and\ntwo other men jumped after him from somewhere on the ruined wall\nabove us.  In another second Abdul Ali was held hand and foot,\ntied until he could not move, and then a wheat-sack was pulled\ndown over his head and made fast between his legs. [*All right.]\n\n\"You're late!\" said Grim.  \"Quick!  Where's the rope?  Are your\nmen below?\"\n\nThe thundering on the door had ceased.  Either they were coming\nup the steps already, or had gone to reach the parapet some other\nway.  It did not occur to me, or for that matter to any of us in\nthe excitement of the minute, that they might be holding a\nconsultation below, or might even have abandoned the idea of\nfollowing, although I think now that must be the explanation, for\nwhat we did took more time than it takes to set it down.\n\nBen Hamza made one end of the rope fast around Abdul Ali's feet.\nHe would not listen to argument.  He said he knew his business,\nand certainly the knot was workmanlike.  Then he called over the\nparapet (an Arab never whistles) and a voice answered from the\nsouthern side of the moat, where some fallen stones cast a\nshadow.  Then the three of them lifted Abdul Ali over, and\nlowered him head-first.\n\nIt was a slow business, for otherwise he would have been stunned\nagainst the first projection.  I thought that Grim looked almost\nas nervous as I felt, but Mahommed ben Hamza was having the time\nof his life, and could not keep his tongue still.\n\n\"Head upwards a man can yell,\" he explained to me, grinning from\near to ear.  \"Feet upwards, too afraid to yell!\"  Then the\nthundering on the door began again, louder than before it seemed\nto me.  They were using a battering-ram.  But they were too late.\nAfter what seemed like a long-drawn hour we saw shadowy arms\nbelow reach up and seize our prisoner.  Then the loose rope came\nup again hand over hand.\n\n\"You next!\" said Grim quietly.  He pushed me forward, after\ncarefully examining the loop Mahommed ben Hamza tied in the end\nof the rope.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\n\n\"Money doesn't weigh much!\"\n\n\nWell--you don't stand on precedence or ceremony at times like\nthat.  Over I went in the bight of the rope.  They let me fall\nabout fifteen feet before they seemed to realize that I had let\ngo of the parapet.  Added to all that had gone before, that made\nabout the climax of sensation.  The pain of barking the skin of\nknees and elbows against projecting angles of stone was a relief.\n\nI am no man of iron.  I haven't iron nerves.  Not one second of\nthat descent was less than hell.  I could hear the thunder of\nsome kind of battering-ram on the door at the foot of the stair.\nI could imagine the rope chafing against the sharp edge of the\nparapet as they paid it out hand over hand.  The only thing that\nmade me keep my head at all was knowledge that Abdul Ali had had\nto do the trip feet-upward, with his head in a bag.  When they\nlet go too fast it was rather like the half-way stage of taking\nchloroform.  When they slowed up, there was the agonizing dread\nof pursuit.  And through it all there burned the torturing\nsuggestion that the rope might break.\n\nMother Earth felt good that night, when strong hands reached up\nand lifted me out of the noose that failed of reaching the bottom\nby about a man's height.  Come to think of it, it wasn't mother\nearth at that.  It was the stinking carcass of a camel only half\nautopsied by the vultures, that my feet first rested on--brother,\nperhaps, to the beast I had put out of his agony that afternoon.\n\nThe others came down the rope hand-over-hand, Grim last.  I\nsuppose he stayed up there with his pistol, ready for contingencies.\nHe had his nerve with him, for he had fastened the upper end of\nthe rope to a piece of broken stone laid across a gap that the\ncrusaders had made in the ramparts, centuries ago, for the Christian\npurpose of pouring boiling oil and water on their foes.  It did not\ntake more than a minute's violent shaking after he got down to bring\nthe rope tumbling on our heads.\n\nThen the next thing he did was to take a look at the prisoner.\nFinding him not much the worse for wear, barring some bruises and\na missing inch or two of skin, he ordered the bag pulled over his\nhead again and gave the order for retreat.  Mahommed ben Hamza\nwent scouting ahead.  The others picked up Abdul Ali as the\nconstruction gangs handle baulks of timber--horizontal--face-\ndownward.  When he wriggled they cuffed him into good behaviour.\n\nYou have to get down into an Arab moat before you can realize\nwhat the Hebrews meant by their word Gehenna.  The smell of\nrotting carrion was only part of it.  One stumbled into, and\nthrough, and over things that should not be.  Heaps, that looked\nsolid in the moonlight, yielded to the tread.  Whatever liquid\nlay there was the product of corruption.\n\nYet we did not dare to climb out of the moat until we reached the\nshadows at the northern angle.  Though the moonlight shone almost\nstraight down on us it was a great deal brighter up above, and\nthe walls cast some shadow.  There was nothing for it but to pick\nour way in the comparative gloom of that vulture's paradise,\npraying we might find a stream to wade in presently.\n\nOnce, looking up behind me, I thought I saw men's heads peering\nover the parapet, but that may have been imagination.  Grim vowed\nhe did not see them, although I suspected him of saying that to\navoid a panic.  He shepherded us along, speaking in a perfectly\nnormal voice whenever he had to, as if there were no such thing\nas hurry in the world.  When we reached the farther corner of the\nmoat it was he who climbed out first to con the situation.  A\nlook-out in a bastion on the ruined town wall promptly fired\nat him.\n\nI expected him to fire back.  I climbed up beside him to lend a\nhand with the pistol I had filched from Abdul Ali.  But Grim\nshouted something about taking away for burial the corpse of a\nman who had died of small-pox.  The man on the wall commanded us\nto Allah's mercy and warned us to beware lest we, too, catch that\ndreaded plague.\n\n\"Inshallah!\" Grim answered.  Then he summoned our men from\nthe moat.\n\nThey passed up Abdul Ali, dragging him feet-first again with one\nman keeping a clenched fist ready to strike him in the mouth in\ncase he should forget that corpses don't cry out.  He looked like\na corpse half-cold, as they carried him jerkily along a track\nthat roughly followed the line of the wall.  I don't suppose that\nanything ever looked more like an Arab funeral procession than we\ndid.  The absence of noisy mourners, and the unusual hour of\nnight, were plausibly accounted for by the dreaded disease that\nGrim had invented for the occasion.  My golf-suit was the only\nfalse note, but I kept in shadow as much as I could, with the\nunseemly burden between me and the ramparts.\n\nIt was a long time before we had the town wall at our backs.  A\nfuneral, in the circumstances, might justifiably be rapid;  but\nwe could hardly run and keep up the pretense.  But at last we\npassed over the shoulder of a hill into shadow on the farther\nside, and there was no more need of play-acting.\n\n\"Yalla bilagel!\" [Run like the devil.] Grim ordered then, and we\nobeyed him like sprinters attempting to lower a record.\n\nTwelve men running through the night can make a lot of noise,\nespecially when they carry a heavy man between them.  Our men\nwere all from Hebron.  Hebron prides itself on training the\nartfullest thieves in Asia.  They boast of being able to steal\nthe bed from under a sleeper without waking him.  But even the\nstealthiest animals go crashing away from danger, and, now that\nthe worst of the danger lay behind, more or less panic seized all\nof us.\n\nMahommed ben Hamza refused to follow the regular track, for fear\nof ambush or a chance encounter in the dark.  Grim let him have\nhis way.  They dragged the wretched Abdul Ali like a sack of corn\nby a winding detour, and wherever the narrow path turned sharply\nto avoid great rocks they skidded him at the turn until he yelled\nfor mercy.  Grim pulled off the sack at last, untied his arms and\nlegs, and let him walk;  but whenever he lagged they frog-marched\nhim again.\n\nAt last we reached a brook where we all waded to get rid of the\nfilth and smell from that infernal moat, and Abdul Ali seized\nthat opportunity to play his last cards.  Considering Ben Hamza's\nreputation, the obvious type of his nine ruffians, the darkness\nand rough handling, it said a lot for Grim's authority that Abdul\nAli still had that wallet-full of money in his possession.\nSitting on a stone in the moonlight, he pulled it out.  His nerve\nwas a politician's, cynical, simple.  Its simplicity almost took\nyour breath away.\n\n\"How many men from Hebron?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Ten.  Well and good.  I have here ten thousand piastres--one\nthousand for each of you, or divide it how you like.  That is\nthe price I will pay you to let me go.  What can these other\ntwo do to you?  Take the money and run.  Leave me to settle with\nthese others.\"\n\nBen Hamza, knee-deep in the brook, laughed aloud as he eyed the\nmoney.  He made a gesture so good-humoured, so full of\nresignation and regret and broad philosophy that you would have\nliked the fellow even if he hadn't saved your life.\n\n\"Deal with those two first!\" he grinned.  \"I would have taken\nyour money long ago, but that I know Jimgrim!  He would have made\nme give it up again.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim!\" said Abdul Ali.  \"Jimgrim?  Are you Major James Grim?\nA good thing for you I did not know that, when I had you in my\npower in the castle!\"\n\nGrim laughed.  \"Are we all set? Let's go.\"\n\nWe hurried all the faster now because our legs were wet.  The\nnight air on those Moab heights is chilly at any season.\nPerhaps, too, we were trying to leave behind us the moat-stench\nthat the water had merely reduced, not washed away.  A quarter of\na mile before we reached the place appointed we knew that Anazeh\nhad not failed to keep his tryst.  Away up above us, beside the\ntomb, like an ancient bearded ghost, Anazeh stood motionless,\nsilent, conning the track we should come by--a grand old savage\nkeeping faith against his neighbours for the sake of friendship.\n\nHe did not challenge when he heard us.  He took aim.  He held his\naim until Grim called to him.  When our goat track joined the\nmain road he was there awaiting us, standing like a sentinel in\nthe shadow of a fanged rock.  And there, if, Abdul Ali of\nDamascus could have had his way, there would have been a fresh\ndebate.  He did not let ten seconds pass before he had offered\nAnazeh all the money he had with him to lend him a horse and let\nhim go.  Anazeh waived aside the offer.\n\n\"You shall have as much more money as you wish!\" the Damascene\ninsisted.  \"Let me get to my house, and a messenger shall take\nthe money to you.  Or come and get it.\"\n\nAll the answer Anazeh gave him was a curt laugh--one bark like\na Fox's.\n\n\"Where are all the horses?\" Grim demanded.  I could only see five\nof six.\n\n\"I wait for them.\"\n\n\"Man, we can't wait!\"\n\n\"Jimgrim!\" said the old sheikh, with a glint of something between\nmalice and amusement in his eyes, \"I knew you in the mejlis when\nyou watched me read that letter!  One word from me and--\"  He\nmade a click between his teeth suggestive of swift death.  \"I let\nyou play your game.  But now I play my game, Allah willing.  I\nhave waited for you.  Wait thou for me!\"\n\n\"Why?  What is it?\"\n\nAnazeh beckoned us and turned away.  We followed him, Grim and I,\nacross the road and up a steep track to the tomb on the\noverhanging rock, where he had stood when we first saw him.\n\nHe pointed.  A cherry-red fire with golden sparks and crimson-\nbellied sulphur smoke was blazing in the midst of El-Kerak.\n\n\"The home of Abdul Ali of Damascus,\" said Anazeh with pride in\nhis voice.  It was the pride of a man who shows off the behaviour\nof his children.  \"My men did it!\"\n\n\"How can they escape?\" Grim asked him.\n\n\"Wallah!  Will the gate guards stand idle?  Will they not run to\nthe fire--and to the looting?  But they will find not much loot.\nMy men already have it!\"\n\n\"Loot,\" said Grim, \"will delay them.\"\n\n\"Money doesn't weigh much,\" Anazeh answered.  \"Here my men come.\"\n\nSomebody was coming.  There came a burst of shooting and yelling\nfrom somewhere between us and El-Kerak, and a moment later the\nthunder of horses galloping full-pelt.  Anazeh got down to the\nroad with the agility of a youngster, ordered Abdul Ali of\nDamascus, the shivering Ahmed and me under cover.  He placed his\nremaining handful of men at points of vantage where they could\ncover the retreat of the fifteen.  And it was well he did.\n\nThere were at least two score in hot pursuit, and though you\ncould hardly tell which was which in that dim light, Anazeh's\nparty opened fire on the pursuers and let the fifteen through.  I\ndid not get sight of Grim while that excitement lasted, but he\nhad two automatics.  He took from me the one that I had taken\nfrom Abdul Ali, and with that one and his own he made a din\nlike a machine-gun.  He told me afterward that he had fired in\nthe air.\n\n\"Noise is as good as knock-outs in the dark,\" he explained, while\nAnazeh's men boasted to one another of the straight shooting that\nit may be they really believed they had done.  An Arab can\nbelieve anything--afterward.  I don't believe one man was killed,\nthough several were hit.\n\nAt any rate, whether the noise accomplished it or not, the\npursuers drew off, and we went forward, carrying a cashbox now,\nof which Abdul Ali was politely requested to produce the key.\nThat was the first intimation he had that his house had been\nlooted.  He threw his bunch of keys away into the shadows, in the\nfirst exhibition of real weakness he had shown that night.  It\nwas a silly gesture.  It only angered his captors.  It saved him\nnothing.\n\nFour more of Anazeh's men had been wounded, all from behind, two\nof them rather badly, making six in all who were now unfit for\nfurther action.  But we did not wait to bandage them.  They\naffected to make light of their injuries, saying they would go\nover to the British and get attended to in hospital.  Abdul Ali\nwas put on Ahmed's miserable mount, with his legs lashed under\nthe horse's belly.  Ahmed, with Mahommed ben Hamza and his men\nwere sent along ahead;  being unarmed, unmounted, they were a\nliability now.  But those Hebron thieves could talk like an\narmy;  they put up a prodigious bleat, all night long, about\nthat cash-box.  They maintained they had a clear right to share\nits contents, since unless they had first captured Abdul Ali,\nAnazeh's men could not have burned his house and seized\nhis money.  Anazeh's men, when they had time to be, were\nsuitably amused.\n\nIt was not a peaceful retreat by any means.  Time and again\nbefore morning we were fired on from the rear.  Our party\ndeployed to right and left to answer--always boasting afterward\nof having killed at least a dozen men.  I added up their figures\non the fly-leaf of the pocket Bible, and the total came to two\nhundred and eighteen of the enemy shot dead and forever damned!\nI believe Anazeh actually did kill one of our pursuers.\n\nBy the time the moon disappeared we had come too close to\nAnazeh's country to make pursuit particularly safe.  Who they\nwere who pursued us, hauled off.  We reached the launch, secure\nin its cove between the rocks, a few minutes after dawn.  Anazeh\nordered his six wounded men into it, with perfect assurance\nthat the British doctors would take care of them and let them\ngo unquestioned.\n\nWhen Grim had finished talking with Anazeh I went up to thank the\nold fellow for my escort, and he acknowledged the courtesy with a\nbow that would have graced the court of Solomon.\n\n\"Give the old bird a present, if you've got one,\" Grim whispered.\n\nSo I gave him my watch and chain, and he accepted them with the\nsame calm dignity.\n\n\"Now he's your friend for life!\" said Grim.  \"Anazeh is a friend\nworth having.  Let's go!\"\n\nThe watch and chain was a cheap enough price to pay for that two\ndays' entertainment and the acquaintance of such a splendid old\nking of thieves.  Anazeh watched us away until we were out of\nearshot, he and Grim exchanging the interminable Arab farewell\nformula of blessing and reply that have been in use unchanged for\na thousand years.\n\nThen Abdul Ali produced his wallet again.\n\n\"Major Grim,\" he said, \"please take this money.  Keep it for\nyourself, and let me go.  Surely I have been punished enough!\nBesides, you cannot--you dare not imprison me!  I am a French\nsubject.  I have been seized outside the British sphere.  I know\nyou are a poor man--the pay of a British officer is a matter of\ncommon knowledge.  Come now, you have done what you came to do.\nYou have destroyed my influence at El-Kerak.  Now benefit\nyourself.  Avoid an international complication.  Show mercy on\nme!  Take this money.  Say that I gave you the slip in the dark!\"\n\nGrim smiled.  He looked extremely comical without any eyebrows.\nThe wrinkles went all the way up to the roots of his hair.\n\n\"I'm incorruptible,\" he said.  \"The boss, I believe, isn't.\"\n\n\"You mean your High Commissioner?  I have not enough money\nfor him.\"\n\nGrim laughed.  \"No,\" he said, \"he comes expensive.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass,\" said Grim. \"You know what.\"\n\n\"Information?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What information?\"\n\n\"You were sent by the French,\" said Grim, \"to raise the devil\nhere in Palestine--no matter why.  You were trying to bring\noff a raid on Judaea.  Who are your friends in Jerusalem who\nwere ready to spring surprises?  What surprises?  Who's your\nJerusalem agent?\"\n\n\"If I tell you?\"\n\n\"I'm not the boss.  But I'll see him about it.  Come on--who's\nyour agent?\"\n\n\"Scharnhoff.\"\n\nGrim whistled.  That he did not believe, I was almost certain,\nbut he whistled as if totally new trains of thought had suddenly\nrevealed themselves amid a maze of memories.\n\n\"You shall speak to the boss,\" he said after a while.\n\nI fell asleep then, wedged uncomfortably between two men's legs,\nwakened at intervals by the noisy pleading of Mahommed ben Hamza\nand his men for what they called their rights in the matter of\nAbdul Ali's wallet.  They were still arguing the point when we\nran on the beach near Jericho, where a patrol of incredulous\nSikhs pounced on us and wanted to arrest Ahmed and Anazeh's\nwounded men.  Grim had an awful time convincing them that he was\na British officer.  In the end we only settled it by tramping\nabout four miles to a guard-house, where a captain in uniform\ngave us breakfast and telephoned for a commisariat lorry.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when we reached Jerusalem and got\nthe wounded into hospital.  By the time Grim had changed into\nuniform and put courtplaster where his eyebrows should have been,\nand he, Abdul Ali and I had driven in an official Ford up the\nMount of Olives to OETA, the sun was not far over the skyline.\n\nGrim had telephoned, so the Administrator was waiting for us.\nGrim went straight in.  It was twenty minutes before we two were\nsummoned into his private room, where he sat behind the desk\nexactly as we had left him the other morning.  He looked as if he\nhad not moved meanwhile.  Everything was exactly in its place--\neven the vase, covering the white spot on the varnish.  There was\nthe same arrangement of too many flowers, in a vase too small to\nhold them.\n\n\"Allow me to present Sheikh Abdul Ali of Damascus,\" said Grim.\n\nThe Administrator bowed rather elaborately, perhaps to hide\nthe twinkle in his eyes.  He didn't scowl.  He didn't look\ntyrannical.  So Abdul Ali opened on him, with all bow guns.\n\n\"I protest!  I am a French subject.  I have been submitted to\nviolence, outrage, indignity!  I have been seized on foreign\nsoil, and brought here by force against all international\nlaw!  I shall claim exemplary damages!  I demand apology\nand satisfaction!\"\n\nSir Louis raised his eyebrows and looked straight at Grim without\neven cracking a smile.\n\n\"Is this true, Major Grim?\"\n\n\"Afraid it is, sir.\"\n\n\"Scandalous!  Perfectly scandalous!  And were you a witness to\nall this?\" he asked, looking at me as if I might well be the\ncause of it all.\n\nI admitted having seen the greater part of it.\n\n\"And you didn't protest?  What's the world coming to?  I see\nyou've lost a little skin yourself.  I hope you've not been\nbreaking bounds and fighting?\"\n\n\"He is a most impertinent man!\" said Abdul Ali, trying to take\nhis cue, and glowering at me.  \"He posed as a person interested\nin a school for El-Kerak, and afterward helped capture me by\na trick!\"\n\nThe Administrator frowned.  It seemed I was going to be made the\nscape-goat.  I did not care.  I would not have taken a year of\nSir Louis' pay for those two days and nights.  When he spoke\nagain I expected something drastic addressed to me, but I\nwas wrong.\n\n\"An official apology is due to you, Sheikh Abdul Ali.  Permit me\nto offer it, together with my profound regret for any slight\npersonal inconvenience to which you may have been subjected in\ncourse of this--ah--entirely unauthorized piece of--ah--\nbrigandage.  I notice you have been bruised, too.  You shall have\nthe best medical attention at our disposal.\"\n\n\"That is not enough!\" sneered Abdul Ali, throwing quite\nan attitude.\n\n\"I know it isn't.  I was coming to that.  An apology is also due\nto the French--our friends the French.  I shall put it in\nwriting, and ask you to convey it to Beirut to the French High\nCommissioner, with my compliments.  I would send you by train,\nbut you might be--ah--delayed at Damascus in that case.  Perhaps\nEmir Feisal might detain you.  There will be a boat going from\nJaffa in two days' time.  Two days will give you a chance to\nrecover from the outrageous experience before we escort you to\nthe coast.  A first-class passage will be reserved for you by\nwire, and you will be put on board with every possible courtesy.\nYou might ask the French High Commissioner to let me know if\nthere is anything further he would like us to do about it.  Now,\nI'll ring for a clerk to take you to the medical officer--under\nescort, so that you mayn't be subjected to further outrage or\nindignity.  Good evening!\"\n\n\"Anything more for me?\" asked Grim, as soon as Abdul Ali had been\nled away.\n\n\"Not tonight, Grim.  Come and see me in the morning.\" Grim\nsaluted.  The Administrator looked at me--smiled mischievously.\n\n\"Have a good time?\" he asked.  \"Don't neglect those scratches.\nGood evening!\"\n\nNo more.  Not another word.  He never did say another word to me\nabout it, although I met him afterwards a score of times.  You\ncouldn't help but admire and like him.\n\nGrim led the way up the tower stairs again, and we took a last\nlook at El-Kerak.  The moon was beginning to rise above the rim\nof the Moab Hills.  The land beyond the Dead Sea was wrapped in\nutter silence.  Over to the south-east you could make out one dot\nof yellow light, to prove that men lived and moved and had their\nbeing in that stillness.  Otherwise, you couldn't believe it was\nreal country.  It looked like a vision of the home of dreams.\n\n\"Got anything to do tonight?\" asked Grim.  \"Can you stay awake?\nI know where some Jews are going to play Beethoven in an upper\nroom in the ancient city.  Care to come?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven\n\n\"And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah--\"\n\n\nI have no idea what Grim did during the next few days.  I spent\nthe time studying Arabic, and saw nothing of him until he walked\ninto my room at the hotel one afternoon, sat down and came\nstraight to the point.\n\n\"Had enough?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Got the hang of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" I answered.  \"Allah's peace, as they call it,\ndepends on the French.  They intend to get Damascus and all\nSyria.  So they sent down Abdul Ali of Damascus to make trouble\nfor the British in Palestine;  the idea being to force the\nBritish to make common cause with them.  That would mean total\ndefeat for the Arabs;  and Great Britain would save France scads\nof men and money.  But you pulled that plug.  I saw you do it.  I\nheard Abdul Ali of Damascus tell you Scharnhoff's name.  Did you\ngo after Scharnhoff?\"\n\n\"No, not yet,\" he answered.  \"You're no diplomat.\"\n\nI knew that.  I have never wished to be one, never having met a\nprofessional one who did not, so to speak, play poker with a cold\ndeck and at least five aces.  The more frankly they seem to be\ntelling the truth, the more sure you may be they are lying.\n\n\"Neither are you,\" I answered.  \"You're a sportsman.  Are you\nallowing Scharnhoff weight for age, and a fair start--or what?\"\n\nHe chuckled.  \"You believed old Abdul-Ali of Damascus?  He's a\nFrench secret political agent.  So whatever he told us is\ncertainly not true.  Or, if it is true, or partially true, then\nit's the kind of truth that is deadlier deceptive than a good\nclean God-damned lie.  Get this:  such men as Abdul Ali would\nface torture rather than betray an associate--unless they're sure\nthe associate is a traitor or about to become one.  A government\ncan't easily punish its own spies on foreign territory.  But by\nbetraying them, it can sometimes get the other government to do\nit.  That Abdul Ali betrayed Scharnhoff to me, proves one of two\nthings.  Abdul Ali was lying, and Scharnhoff harmless--or in\nsome way Scharnhoff has fallen foul of his French paymasters\nand they want him punished.  Very likely he has drawn French\nmoney, for their purposes, and has misused it for his own ends.\nOr perhaps they have promised him money, and wish to back down.\nPossibly he knows too much about their agents, and they want\nhim silenced.  They propose to have us silence him.  I'm going\nto call on Scharnhoff.\"\n\n\"You suspect him of double treachery?\"\n\n\"I suspect him of being a one-track-minded, damned old\nvisionary.\"\n\nI had met Hugo Scharnhoff.  Long before the War he had been a\nprofessor of orientology at Vienna University.  At the moment he\nwas technically an \"enemy alien.\"  But he had lived so many years\nin Jerusalem, and was reputed so studious and harmless, that the\nBritish let him stay there after Allenby captured the city.  A\nman of moderate private means, he owned a stone house in the\nGerman Colony with its back to the Valley of Hinnom.\n\n\"Care to come?\" Grim asked me.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Know your Bible?\"  He proceeded to quote from it:  \"And the rest\nof the acts of Ahaziah which he did are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?\"'\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"That was set down in Aramaic, nowadays called Hebrew, something\nlike three thousand years ago,\" said Grim.  \"It's Aramaic magic.\nLet's take a look at it.\"\n\nWe trudged together down the dusty Bethlehem Road, turned to the\neast just short of the Pool of the Sultan (where they now had a\ndelousing station for British soldiers) and went nearly to the\nend of the colony of neat stone villas that the Germans built\nbefore the War, and called Rephaim.  It was a prosperous colony\nuntil the Kaiser, putting two and two, made five of them and had\nto guess again.\n\nThe house we sought stood back from the narrow road, at a corner,\nsurrounded by a low stone wall and a mass of rather dense shrubs\nthat obscured the view from the windows.  The front door was a\nthing of solid olive-wood.  We had to hammer on it for several\nminutes.  There was no bell.\n\nA woman opened it at last--an Arab in native costume, gazelle-\neyed, as they all are, and quite good looking, although hardly in\nher first youth.  Her face struck me as haunted.  She was either\nashamed when her eyes met Grim's or else afraid of him.  But she\nsmiled pleasantly enough and without asking our business led the\nway at once to a room at the other end of a long hall that was\ncrowded with all sorts of curios.  They were mostly stone bric-a-\nbrac-fragments of Moabite pottery and that kind of thing, with a\npretty liberal covering of ordinary house dust.  In fact, the\nhouse had the depressing \"feel\" of a rarely visited museum.\n\nThe room she showed us into was the library--three walls lined\nwith books, mostly with German titles--a big cupboard in one\ncorner, reaching from floor to ceiling--a big desk by the\nwindow--three armchairs and a stool.  There were no pictures,\nand the only thing that smacked of ornament was the Persian rug\non the floor.\n\nWe waited five minutes before Scharnhoff came in, looking as if\nwe had disturbed his nap.  He was an untidy stout man with green\ngoggles and a grayish beard, probably not yet sixty years of age,\nand well preserved.  He kept his pants up with a belt, and his\nshirt bulged untidily over the top.  When he sat down you could\nsee the ends of thick combinations stuffed into his socks.  He\ngave you the impression of not fitting into western clothes at\nall and of being out of sympathy with most of what they represent.\n\nHe was cordial enough--after one swift glance around the room.\n\n\"Brought a new acquaintance for you,\" said Grim, introducing\nme.  \"I've told him how all the subalterns come to you for\nPalestinian lore--\"\n\n\"Ach!  The young Lotharios!  Each man a Don Juan!  All they come\nto me for is tales of Turkish harems, of which I know no more\nthan any one.  They are not interested in subjects of real\nimportance.  'How many wives had Djemal Pasha?  How many of them\nwere European?'  That is what they ask me.  When I discuss\nancient history it is only about King Solomon's harem that they\ncare to know;  or possibly about the modern dancing girls of El-\nKerak, who are all spies.  But there is no need to inform you as\nto that.  Eh?  I haven't seen you for a long time, Major Grim.\nWhat have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Nothing much.  I was at the Tomb of the Kings yesterday.\"\n\nScharnhoff smiled scornfully.\n\n\"Now you must have some whiskey to take the taste of that untruth\nout of your mouth!  How can a man of your attainments call that\nobviously modern fraud by such a name?  The place is not nearly\ntwo thousand years old!  It is probably the tomb of a Syrian\nqueen named Adiabene and her family.  Josephus mentions it.  This\nland is full--every square metre of it--of false antiquities with\nreal names, and real antiquities that never have been discovered!\nBut why should a man like you, Major Grim, lend yourself to\nperpetuating falsity?\"\n\nHe walked over to the cupboard to get whiskey, and from where we\nsat we could both of us see what he was doing.  The cupboard was\nin two parts, top and bottom, without any intervening strip of\nwood between the doors, which fitted tightly.  When he opened the\ntop part the lower door opened with it.  He kicked it shut again\nat once, but I had seen inside--not that it was interesting at\nthe moment.\n\nHe set whiskey and tumblers on the desk, poured liberally, and\nwent on talking.\n\n\"Tomb of the Kings?  Hah!  Tomb of the Kings of Judah?  Hah!  If\nany one can find that, he will have something more important than\nLudendorff's memoirs!  Something merkwurdig, believe me!\"\n\nHe stiffened suddenly, and looked at Grim through the green\ngoggles as if he were judging an antiquity.\n\n\"Perhaps this is not the time to make you a little suggestion, eh?\"\n\nGrim's face wrinkled into smiles.\n\n\"This man knows enough to hang me anyhow!  Fire away!\"\n\n\"Ah!  But I would not like him to hang me!\"\n\n\"He's as close as a clam.  What's your notion?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious, but--between us three, then--you and I are both\nforeigners in this place, Major Grim, although I have made it my\nhome for fifteen years.  You have no more interest in this\ngovernment and its ridiculous rules than I have.  What do you\nsay--shall we find the Tomb of the Kings together?\"\n\nGrim wrinkled into smiles again and glanced down at his uniform.\n\n\"Yes, exactly!\" agreed Scharnhoff.  \"That is the whole point.\nThey call me an enemy alien.  I am to all intents and purposes a\nprisoner.  You are a British officer--can do what you like--go\nwhere you like.  You wear red tabs;  you are on the staff;\nnobody will dare to question you.  These English have stopped all\nexploration until they get their mandate.  After that they will\ntake good care that only English societies have the exploration\nprivilege.  But what if we--you and I, that is to say--between\nus extract the best plum from the pudding before those miscalled\nstatesmen sign the mandate--eh?  It can be done!  It can be done!\"\n\nGrim chuckled:\n\n\"I suppose you already see a picture of you and me with an\nancient tomb in our trunks--say a few tons of the more artistic\nparts--beating it for the frontier and hawking the stuff\nafterward to second-hand furniture dealers?  Pour me another\nwhiskey, prof, and then we'll go steal the Mosque of Omar!\"\n\n\"Ach!  You laugh at me--you jest--you mock--you sneer.  But I\nknow what I propose.  Do you know what will be found in that Tomb\nof the Kings of Judah when we discover it?\"\n\n\"Bones.  Dry bones.  A few gold ornaments perhaps.  A stale\nsmell certainly.\"\n\n\"The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel!  Think of it!\nA parchment roll--perhaps two or three rolls--not too big to go\ninto a valise--worth more than all the other ancient manuscripts\nin the world all put together!  Himmel!  What a find that would\nbe!  What a record!  What a refutation of all the historians and\nthe fools who set themselves up for authorities nowadays!  What a\nprice it would bring!  What would your Metropolitan Museum in New\nYork not pay for it!  What would the Jews not pay for it!  They\nwould raise millions among them and pay any price we cared\nto ask!  The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel--\nonly think!\"\n\n\"But why the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel in the tomb of the\nKings of Judah?\" Grim asked, more by way of keeping up the\nconversation, I think, than because he could not guess the\nanswer.  He is an omnivorous reader, and there is not much\nrecorded of the Near East that he does not know.\n\n\"Don't you know your history?  You know, of course, that after\nKing Solomon died the Jews divided into two kingdoms.  The\nlatter-day Jews speak of themselves as Israelites, but they are\nnothing of the kind;  they are Judah-ites.  The tribe of Judah\nremained in Jerusalem, forming one small kingdom;  their\ndescendants are the Jews of today.  Part of the tribe of Benjamin\nstayed with them.  The other seceding ten tribes called\nthemselves the kingdom of Israel.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows that,\" said Grim.  \"What of it?\"\n\n\"Well, the Assyrians came down and conquered the kingdom of\nIsrael--marched all the Israelites away into captivity--and they\nvanished out of history.  From that day to this their Book of\nChronicles, so often referred to in the Old Testament, has never\nbeen seen nor heard of.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Grim.  \"The King of Assyria used it to wipe\nhis razor on when he was through shaving every morning.\"\n\n\"Ach!  You joke again;  but I tell you I am not joking.  Such\npeople as those Hebrews are naturally secretive and so proud that\nthey wrote down for posterity all the doings of their puny kings,\nwould never have let their records fall into the hands of the\nAssyrians.  They themselves were marched away in slave-gangs, but\nthey left their Book behind them, safely hidden.  Be sure of it!\nTen years ago I found a manuscript in the place they now call\nNablus, which in those days was Schechem.  Schechem was the\ncapital of the Kingdom of Israel, just as Jerusalem was the\ncapital of the Kingdom of Judah, or the Jews.  I sold that\nmanuscript for a good price after I had photographed it.  The\nidiots to whom I sold it--historians they call themselves!--value\nit only as a relic of antiquity.  I made a digest of it--analyzed\nit--studied it--compared it with other authentic facts in my\npossession--and came to the definite conclusion that I hold the\nclue to the whereabouts of that lost Book of Chronicles.\"\n\n\"Let's see the photograph,\" Grim suggested.\n\n\"It has been impounded with other so-called 'enemy property' by\nyour friends the British.  I suppose they thought the German\nGeneral Staff might get hold of it and conquer the Suez Canal!\nBut what good would the sight of it do?  You couldn't understand\na word of it.  It convinced me, after months of study, that when\nthe Ten Tribes were carried away into captivity by the Assyrians\nthey sent their records secretly to Jerusalem.  Ever since the\nsecession the Israelites and Jews had been jealous enemies.  But\nthey were relatives after all, boasting a common ancestor, proud\nof the same history, more or less observing the same religion.\nAnd Schechem was only about thirty miles from Jerusalem, which\nwas considered an impregnable fortress until the Babylonians took\nit later on.  So they sent their records to Jerusalem, and the\nJews hid them.  Where?  Where do you suppose?\"\n\n\"The likeliest place would be Solomon's Temple.\"\n\n\"You think so?  Then you think superficially, my young friend.\nLet us return to that Tomb of the Kings again for a moment.  That\nplace that you visited is such an obvious fake that even the\nguide-books make light of it.  The one all-important thing in\nPalestine that never yet has been discovered is the real Tomb of\nthe Kings.  Yet Jerusalem, where it certainly must be, has been\nsearched and looted a hundred times from end to end.  Therefore--\nyou follow me?--the Jews must have concealed it very cunningly.\nAnswer me, then:  would the Jews, who were always a practical\npeople and not corpse-worshippers like the Egyptians, have taken\nall that trouble to hide the tomb of their kings unless there\nwere important treasure in it?  Answer me!\"\n\n\"So you expect to find treasure in addition to the lost Book of\nChronicles?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do!  The treasure will make the whole proceeding\nsafe.  Let the British have it!  The fools will be so blinded by\nthe glamour of gold, that I shall easily extract the things of\nreal value--the invaluable manuscripts!  Then let the men who\ncall themselves historians take a back seat!\"\n\nHe rubbed his hands together in anticipation.\n\n\"Were you looking for the Tomb of the Kings, then, before the\nWar?\" Grim asked him.\n\n\"Not exactly.  Under the Turks it was difficult.  The Turks were\nbeautifully corrupt.  By paying for it I could get permission to\nexcavate on any property owned by Christians.  But the minute I\ntouched Moslem places the Turks became fanatical.  The Arabs,\nnow, are different--fanatics, too, but with a new sort of\nfanaticism--new to them, I mean--the kind that made the French\nrevolutionists destroy everything their ancestors had set value\non.  There are plenty of Arabs so full of this disease of\nBolshevism that they would make it easy for me to desecrate what\nothers believe is holy ground.  But these idiots of English are\nworse than the Turks!  They have stopped all excavation.  They\nare so afraid of Bolshevism that, if they could, they would\nimitate Joshua and make the sun stand still!\"\n\n\"Well, what's the idea?\" asked Grim, finishing his whiskey.\n\nScharnhoff shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You know my position.  I am helpless--here on suffrance--obliged\nby idiotic regulations to sit in idleness.  But if I could find a\nBritish officer with brains--surely there must be one somewhere!\n--one with some authority, who is considered above suspicion, I\ncould show him, perhaps, how to get rich without committing any\ncrime he need feel ashamed of.\"\n\nI could not see Grim's eyes from where I sat, and he did not make\nany nervous movement that could have given him away.  Yet I was\nconscious of a new alertness, and I think Scharnhoff detected it,\ntoo, for he changed his tactics on the instant.\n\n\"Hah! Hah!  I was joking!  Nobody who is fool enough to be a\nprofessional soldier would be clever enough to find the Tomb of\nthe Kings and keep the secret for ten minutes!  Hah! Hah!  But I\nhave a favour I would like to beg of you, Major Grim.\"\n\n\"I've no particular authority, you know.\"\n\n\"Ach!  The Administrator listens to you;  I am assured of that.\"\n\n\"He listens sometimes, yes, then usually does the other thing.\nWell, what's the request?\"\n\n\"A simple one.  There is a risk--not much, but just a little risk\nthat some fool might stumble on that secret of the Tomb of the\nKings and get away with the treasure.  Now, did you ever set a\nthief to catch a thief?  Hah! Hah!  I would be a better watch-dog\nthan any you could find.  I know Jerusalem from end to end.  I\nknow all the likely places.  Why don't you get permission for me\nto wander about Jerusalem undisturbed and keep my eye open for\ntomb-robbers?  If I am not to have the privilege of discovering\nthat Book of Chronicles, at least I would like to see that no\ncommon plunderer gets it.  Surely I am known by now to be\nharmless!  Surely they don't suspect me any longer of being an\nagent of the Kaiser, or any such nonsense as that!  Why not make\nuse of me?  Get me a permit, please, Major Grim, to go where I\nplease by day or night without interference.  Tomb-robbers\nusually work at night, you know.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Grim.  \"I'll try to do that.\"\n\n\"Ah!  I always knew you were a man of good sense!  Have more\nwhiskey?  A cigar then?\"\n\n\"Can't promise anything, of course,\" said Grim, \"but you shall\nhave an answer within twenty-four hours.\"\n\nOutside, as we turned our faces toward Jerusalem's gray wall,\nGrim opened up a little and gave me a suggestion of something in\nthe wind.\n\n\"Did you see what he has in that cupboard?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Two Arab costumes.  Two short crow-bars.\"\n\n\"Did you notice the grayish dust on the rug--three or four\nfootprints at the corner near the cupboard?\"\n\n\"Can't say I did.\"\n\n\"No.  You wouldn't be looking for it.  These men who pose as\nintellectuals never believe that any one else has brains.  They\nfool themselves.  There's one thing no man can afford to do, East\nof the sun or West of the moon.  You can steal, slay, intrigue,\nburn--break all the Ten Commandments except one, and have a\nchance to get away with it.  There's just one thing you can't do,\nand succeed.  He's done it!\"\n\n\"And the thing is?\"\n\n\"Cheat a woman!\"\n\n\"You mean his house keeper?  She who answered the door?\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve\n\n\"You know you'll get scuppered if you're found out!\"\n\n\nTwo days passed again without my seeing Grim, although I called\non him repeatedly at the \"Junior Staff Officers' Mess\" below the\nZionist Hospital.  Suliman, the eight-year-old imp of Arab\nmischief, who did duty as page-boy met me on each occasion at the\ndoor and took grinning delight in disappointing me.\n\nHe was about three and a half feet high--coal-black, with a\ntarboosh worn at an angle on his kinky hair and a flashing white\ngrin across his snub-nosed face that would have made an archangel\ncount the change out of two piastres twice.  Suliman and cool\ncheek were as obvious team-mates as the Gemini, and I was one of\na good number, that included every single member of that\nunofficial mess, who could never quite see what Grim found so\nadmirable in him.  Grim never explained.\n\nTaking the cue from his master, neither did Suliman ever\nexplain anything to any one but Grim, who seemed to understand\nhim perfectly.\n\n\"Jimgrim not here.  No, not coming back.  Much business.\nGood-bye!\"\n\nSomehow you couldn't suspect that kid of telling the truth.\nHowever, there was nothing for it but to go away, with a\nconviction in the small of your back that he was grinning\nmischievously after you.\n\nGrim had found him one day starving and lousy in the archway of\nthe Jaffa Gate, warming his fingers at a guttering candle-end\npreparatory to making a meal off the wax.  He took him home and\nmade Martha, the old Russian maid-of-all-work, clean him with\nkerosene and soft soap--gave him a big packing-case to sleep\nin along with Julius Caesar the near-bull-dog mascot--and\nthereafter broke him in and taught him things seldom included\nin a school curriculum.\n\nIn the result, Suliman adored Grim with all the concentrated zeal\nof hero-worship of which almost any small boy is capable;  but\nunder the shadow of Grim's protection he feared not even \"brass-\nhats\" nor regarded civilians, although he was dreadfully afraid\nof devils.  The devil-fear was a relic of his negroid ancestry.\nSome Arab Sheikh probably captured his great-grandmother on a\nslave-raid.  Superstition lingers in dark veins longer than any\nother human failing.\n\nI think I called five times before he confessed at last\nreluctantly that Grim was in.  That was in the morning after\nbreakfast, and I was shown into the room with the fireplace and\nthe deep armchairs.  Grim was reading but seemed to me more than\nusually reserved, as if the book had been no more than a screen\nto think behind, that left him in a manner unprotected when he\nlaid it down.  I talked at random, and he hardly seemed to\nbe listening.\n\n\"Say,\" he said, suddenly interrupting me, \"you came out of that\nEl-Kerak affair pretty creditably.  Suppose I let you see\nsomething else from the inside.  Will you promise not to shout it\nall over Jerusalem?\"\n\n\"Use your own judgment,\" I answered.\n\n\"You mustn't ask questions.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"If any one in the Administration pounces on you in the course of\nit, you'll have to drop out and know nothing.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"It may prove a bit more risky than the El-Kerak business.\"\n\n\"Couldn't be,\" I answered.\n\n\"You can't talk enough Arabic to get away with.  But could you\nact deaf and dumb?\"\n\n\"Sure--in three languages.\"\n\n\"You understand--I've no authority to let you in on this.  I\nmight catch hell if I were found out doing it.  But I need help,\nof a certain sort.  I want a man who isn't likely to be spotted\nby the gang I'm after.  Get behind that screen--quick!\"\n\nIt was a screen that hid a door leading to the pantry and the\nservants' quarters.  There was a Windsor chair behind it, and it\nis much easier to keep absolutely still when you are fairly\ncomfortable.  I had hardly sat down when a man wearing spurs,\nwho trod heavily, entered the room and I heard Grim get up to\ngreet him.\n\n\"Are we alone?\" a voice asked gruffly.\n\nInstead of answering Grim came and looked behind the screen,\nopened the door leading to the pantry, closed it again, locked\nit, and without as much as a glance at me returned to face\nhis visitor.\n\n\"Well, general, what is it?\"\n\n\"This is strictly secret.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it isn't,\" said Grim.  \"If it's about missing\nexplosives I know more than you do.\"\n\n\"My God!  It's out?  Two tons of TNT intended for the air force\ngone without a trace?  The story's out?\"\n\n\"I know it.  Catesby sent me word by messenger last night from\nLudd, after you put him under arrest.\"\n\n\"Damn the man!  Well, that's what's happened.  Catesby's fault.\nThey'll blame me.  The truck containing the stuff was run into a\nsiding three days ago.  Through young Catesby's negligence it was\nleft there without a guard.  Catesby will be broke for that as\nsure as my name is Jenkins.  But, by the knell of hell's bells,\nGrim, more than Catesby will lose their jobs unless we find the\nstuff!  Two tons.  Half enough to blow up Palestine!\"\n\n\"Too bad about Catesby,\" said Grim.\n\n\"Never mind, Catesby.  Damn him!  Consider my predicament!  How\ncan I go to the Administrator with a lame-duck story about\nmissing TNT and nothing done about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing done?  You've passed the buck, haven't you?  Catesby is\nunder arrest, you say.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I know Catesby,\" Grim retorted quietly.  \"He made that fine\nstand at Beersheba--when the Arabs rushed the camp, and you\nweren't looking.  He took the blame for your carelessness, and\nnever squealed.  You took the credit for his presence of mind,\nand have treated him like a dog ever since.  You expect me to try\nto save your bacon and forget Catesby's?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Grim!  You're talking without your book.  Here's what\nhappened:  the stuff arrived at Ludd in a truck attached to the\nend of a mixed train.  The R.T.O.* sent me a memorandum and\nstalled the truck on a siding.  I gave the memorandum to\nCatesby.\" [*Railway Traffic Officer.]\n\n\"He tells me in the note I received last night that you did\nnothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Then he's a liar.  He forgot all about it and did nothing.  When\nthe Air Force sent to get the stuff the truck was empty.\"\n\n\"And you want me to find it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.  The quicker the better!\"\n\n\"And be a party to breaking Catesby?  I like my job, but not\nthat much!\"\n\n\"You refuse then to hunt for the TNT?\"\n\n\"I take my orders straight from the Administrator.  He expects me\nin half an hour.  You want me to smooth the way for you with Sir\nLouis.  I'm much more interested in Catesby, who would face a\nfiring party sooner than soak another fellow for his own fault.\nCatesby assures me in writing that the first he ever heard of\nthat TNT was when you ordered him arrested after discovery of the\nloss.  His word goes, as far as I'm concerned.  If you want me to\nhelp you, find another goat than Catesby.  That's my answer.\"\n\nThere followed quite a long pause.  Perhaps Brigadier-General\nJenkins was wondering what chance he would stand in a show-down.\nWhoever had heard the mess and canteen gossip knew that Jenkins'\ncareer had been one long string of miracles by which he had\nattained promotion without in any way deserving it, and a\nparallel series of even greater ones by which he had saved\nhimself from ruin by contriving to blame some one else.\n\n\"You want me to white-wash Catesby?\" he said at last.  \"If you\npounce quickly on the TNT, no one need know it was lost.\"\n\n\"If you court-martial Catesby, the public shall know who lost it,\nand who didn't, even if it costs me my commission!\"\n\n\"Blast you!  Insubordination!\"\n\n\"Is your car outside?\" Grim answered.  \"Why don't you drive me up\nto the Administrator and charge me with it?\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot!  I came to you to avoid a scandal.  If this\nnews gets out there'll be a panic.  Things are touchy enough as\nit is.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well--if I drop the charge against Catesby--?\"\n\n\"Then I shall not have to fight for him.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Be definite!\"\n\n\"Damn and blast you!  All right, I'll clear Catesby.\"\n\nIn that ominous minute, like the devil in an old-time drama,\nSuliman knocked at the door leading from the outer hall.  Grim\nopened it, and I heard the boy's voice piping up in Arabic.  The\nAdministrator was in his car outside, waiting to know whether\nMajor Grim was indoors.\n\n\"Where's your car?\" I heard Grim ask.\n\n\"I sent the man to get a tire changed,\" Jenkins answered.\n\n\"Then Sir Louis needn't know you're here.  Do you want to\nsee him?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"You can get behind that screen if you like.\"\n\nI thought Jenkins would explode when he found me sitting there.\nHe was a big, florid-faced man with a black moustache waxed into\npoints, and a neck the color of rare roast beef--a man not given\nto self-restraint in any shape or form.  But he had to make a\nquick decision.  Sir Louis' footsteps were approaching.  He\nglared at me, made a sign to me to sit still, twisted his\nmoustache savagely, and listened, breathing through his mouth to\navoid the tell-tale whistle of his hairy nostrils.  I heard Grim\nstart toward the hall, but Sir Louis turned him back and came\nstraight in.\n\n\"It occurred to me I'd save you the time of coming up to see me\nthis morning, Grim, and look in on you instead before I start my\nrounds.  Any new developments?\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir.  I'll need forty-eight hours.  If we move too\nfast they may touch the stuff off before we get the whole gang\nin the net.\"\n\n\"You're sure you'd rather not have the police?\"\n\n\"Quite.  They mean well, but they're clumsy.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m!  All the same, the thing's ticklish.  There are rumours\nabout all ready.  The Grand Mufti* came to me before breakfast\nwith a wild tale.  I've promised him some Sikhs for special\nsentry duty.  He'd hardly gone before some Zionists came with a\nstory that the Arabs are planning to blow up their hospital;  I\ngave them ten men and an officer.\"  [*The religious head of the\nMoslem community.]\n\n\"Is the city quiet?\" Grim asked him.\n\n\"Fair to middling.  The Jews refused to take their shutters down\nthis morning.  I had to issue an order about it.  I hear now that\nthey're doing business about as usual, but I've ordered the\nnumber of men on duty within the city walls to be doubled.  At\nthe first sign of disturbance I shall have the gates closed.  Are\nyou quite sure you're in touch?\"\n\n\"Quite. sure, sir.  I'm positive of what I told you last night.\nWill you be seeing Colonel Goodenough?\"\n\n\"Yes, in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Please ask him to hold his Sikhs at my disposal for the next two\ndays.  You might add, sir, that if he cares to see sport he could\ndo worse than lend his own services.\"\n\n\"I'll do that.  You can count on Goodenough.  That's a soldier\ndevoid of nonsense.  Anything else?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"Keep me informed.  Remember, Grim, I'm responsible for all you\ndo.  I've endorsed you in blank, as it were.  Don't overlook\nthat point.\"\n\n\"I won't, sir.\"\n\nSir Louis walked out.  Almost before his spurs ceased jingling in\nthe tiled hall, Brigadier-General Jenkins strode out in a\ntowering rage from behind the screen.\n\n\"'Pon my soul, a spy's trick!\" he exploded.  \"Had an\neavesdropper, did you?  Listening from behind a screen while you\ntricked me into a promise on Catesby's account!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Grim answered, folding the screen back, and letting\nhis face wrinkle in smiles all the way up to the roots of\nhis hair.  Very comical he looked, for his eyebrows were\nonly partly sprouted again.  \"Had two of you to listen in\non the Administrator!\"\n\n\"Endorses you in blank, eh?  How long would he let the\nendorsement stand if he knew I was behind that screen while he\nwas talking to you?\"\n\n\"Try him!\" Grim suggested.  \"Shall I call him back?  He doesn't\nwant to break you--told me so, in fact, last night--but he could\nchange his mind, I daresay.  My tip to you is to get back to Ludd\nas fast as your car can take you, release Catesby, and say as\nlittle as possible to any one!\"\n\n\"Damn you for a Yankee!\" Jenkins answered.  \"You've got me\ncornered for the moment, and you make the most of it.  But wait\ntill my turn comes!  As for you, sir,\" Jenkins turned and looked\nme up and down with all the arrogance that nice new crossed\nswords on his shoulder can give a certain sort of man, \"don't let\nme catch you trying to interfere in any Administration business,\nthat's all!\"\n\nI offered him a cigarette, grinning.  There was no sense in\npicking a quarrel.  No man likes to discover that a perfect\nstranger has overheard his intimate confessions.  His annoyance\nwas understandable.  But he hadn't nice manners.  He knocked the\ncigarette case out of my hand and kicked it across the room.  So\nI got into one of the deep armchairs and laughed at him in self-\ndefense, to preserve my own temper from boiling up over the top.\n\n\"To hell with both of you!\" Jenkins thundered, and strode out\nlike Mars on the war-path.\n\n\"Poor old Jinks!\" said Grim, as soon as he had gone.  \"As Sir\nLouis said last night, he has a wife and family besides the\nunofficial ladies on his string.  All they'll have to divide\nbetween them soon, at the rate he's going, will be his half-pay.\nHe has fought for promotion all his days, to keep abreast of\nexpenses.  What that string of cormorants will do with his four\nhundred pounds a year, when he oversteps at last and gets\nretired, beggars imagination!  However, let's get busy.\"\n\nBusiness consisted in dressing me up as an Arab with the aid of\nSuliman, and drilling me painstakingly for half-an-hour, both of\nthem using every trick they knew to make me laugh or show\nsurprise, and Grim nodding approval each time I contrived not to.\nMore difficult than acting deaf and dumb was the trick of\nsquatting with my legs crossed, but I had learned it after a\nfashion in India years ago, and only needed schooling.\n\n\"You'll get scuppered if you're caught,\" he warned me.  \"If\nSuliman wasn't so scared of devils I wouldn't risk it, but I must\nhave somebody to keep an eye on him when the time comes;  that'll\nbe tomorrow, I think.\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me the object of the game,\" I suggested.  \"I'm\nsick of only studying the rules.\"\n\n\"Well--your part will be to sit over those two tons of TNT and\nsee that nobody explodes them ahead of time.  There's a\nconspiracy on foot to blow up the Dome of the Rock.\"\n\n\"You mean the Mosque of Omar?\"\n\n\"The place tourists call the Mosque of Omar.  The site of\nSolomon's Temple--the Rock of Abraham--the threshing-floor of\nAraunah the Jebusite.  Next after the shrine at Mecca it's the\nmost sacred spot in the whole Mahommedan world.\"\n\n\"Good lord!\" I said. \"Are the Zionists so reckless?\".\n\n\"No, the Arabs are.  Remember what old Scharnhoff said the other\nday about the new fanaticism?\"\n\n\"Is Scharnhoff mixed up in it?\"\n\n\"He's being watched.  If the Arabs pull it off, they'll accuse\nthe Jews of doing it, and set to work to butcher every Jew in the\nNear East.  That will oblige the British to protect the Jews.\nThat in turn will set every Mohammedan in the world--'specially\nIndians, but Egyptians, too--against the British.  Jihad--green\nbanner--holy war--all the East and Northern Africa alight while\nthe French snaffle Syria.  Sound good to you?\"\n\n\"Sir Louis knows this?\"\n\n\"He, is paid to know things.\"\n\n\"And he lets you play cat and mouse with it?\"\n\n\"Got to be careful.  Suppose we draw the net too soon, what then?\nMost of the conspirators escape.  The story leaks out.  The Jews\nget the blame for the attempt, and sooner or later the massacre\nbegins anyhow.  What we've got to do is bag every last mother's\nson of them, and suppress the whole story--return the TNT to\nstore, and swear it was never missing.\"\n\n\"The Administrator has his nerve,\" I said.\n\n\"You'll need yours, too, before this game's played,\" Grim\nanswered.  \"D'you see now why I picked on you for an accomplice?\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"You're the one man in Jerusalem whom nobody will suspect, or be\non the look-out for.  The men we're up against are the shrewdest\nrats in Palestine.  They've got a list of British officers, my\nname included, of course.  They'll know which men are assigned to\nspecial duty, and they'll keep every one of us shadowed.\"\n\n\"Won't that--I mean, how can you work if you're shadowed?\"\n\n\"Me?  I shall catch my spur in the carpet, fall downstairs and\nbreak a leg at ten-fifteen.  At ten-thirty the doctor comes, and\nfinds me too badly hurt to be moved.  He sends word of it to Sir\nLouis by an orderly who can be trusted to talk to any one he\nmeets on the way.  I leave by the back way at ten forty-five.\nHowever, here's a chance for you to practise deaf-and-dumb drill.\nThere's some one coming.  Squat down in that corner.  Look meek\nand miserable.  That's the stuff.  Answer the door, Suliman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\n\"You may now be unsafe and an outlaw and enjoy yourself!\"\n\n\nThe man who entered was a short, middle-aged Jew of the type that\nwrites political reviews for magazines--black morning coat, straw\nhat, gold pince-nez--a neatly trimmed dark beard beginning to\nturn gray from intense mental emotion--nearly bald--a manner of\nconceding the conventions rather than argue the point, without\nadmitting any necessity for them--a thin-lipped smile that\napologized for smiling in a world so serious and bitter.  He wore\na U.S.A. ten-dollar gold piece on his watch chain, by way of\nestablishing his nationality.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Eisernstein?  Trouble again?  Sit down and let's hear\nthe worst,\" said Grim.\n\nEisernstein remained standing and glanced at me over in the\ncorner.\n\n\"I will wait until you are alone.\"\n\n\"Ignore him--deaf and dumb,\" Grim answered.  \"Half a minute,\nthough--have you had breakfast?\"\n\n\"Breakfast!  This is no time for eating, Mister--I beg your\npardon, Major Grim.  I have not slept.  I shall not break\nmy fast until my duty is done.  If it is true that the Emperor\nNero fiddled while Rome burned, then I find him no worse than\nthis Administrator!\"\n\n\"Has he threatened to crucify you?\" Grim asked.  \"Take a\nseat, do.\"\n\n\"He may crucify me, and I will thank him, if he will only in\nreturn for it pay some attention to the business for which he\ndraws a salary!  I drove to Headquarters to see him.  He was not\nthere.  Nobody would tell me where he is.  I drove down again\nfrom the Mount of Olives and luckily caught sight of his car in\nthe distance.  I contrived to intercept him.  I told him there is\na plot on foot to massacre every individual of my race in the\nNear East--a veritable pogrom.  He was polite.  He seems to think\npoliteness is the Christian quality that covers the multitude of\nsins.  He offered me a cigar!\n\n\"I offered him a telegram blank, with which to cable for\nreenforcements!  He said that all rumours in Jerusalem become\nexaggerated very quickly, and offered me a guard of one soldier\nto follow me about!  I insisted on immediate military precautions\non a large scale failing which I will cable the Foreign Office in\nLondon at my own expense.  I offered to convince him with\nparticulars about this contemplated pogrom but he said he had an\nurgent appointment and referred me to you, just as Nero might\nhave referred a question regarding the amphitheatre to one of\nhis subordinates!\"\n\n\"Pogroms mean nothing in his young life,\" Grim answered smiling.\n\"I'm here to do the dirty work.  Suppose you spill the news.\"\n\n\"You must have heard the news!  Yet you ignore it!  The Moslems\nare saying that we Zionists have offered two million pounds, or\nsome such ridiculous sum, for the site of Solomon's Temple.  They\nare spreading the tale broadcast.  Their purpose is to stir up\nfanaticism against us.  The ignorant among them set such value on\nthat rock and the mosque their cut-throat ancestors erected on it\nthat Jews are now openly threatened as they pass through the\nstreets.  Yet there is not one word of truth in the story of our\nhaving made any such offer.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of troops,\" said Grim.  \"Any attempt at\nviolence could be handled instantly.\"\n\n\"Then you will do nothing?\"\n\n\"What do you suggest ought to be done?\"\n\n\"Here is a list.  Read it.  Those are the names of fifty Arabs\nwho are active in spreading anti-Zionist propaganda.\"\n\nGrim read the list carefully.\n\n\"All talkers,\" he said.  \"Not a really dangerous man among them.\"\n\n\"Ah!  There you are!  I might have expected it!\"  Eisernstein\nthrew up his hands in a gesture of contempt rather than despair.\n\"Nobody cares what happens to Jews.  Nobody cares for our\nsleepless agony of mind.  Nobody cares how or what we suffer\nuntil afterward, when there will be polite expressions of regret,\nwhich the survivors will assess at a true valuation!  It is the\nsame wherever we turn.  Last night--at half-past one in the\nmorning--a committee of us, every one American, Called at the\nAmerican consulate to tell our consul of our danger.  The consul\nwas unsympathetic in the last degree.  Yet our coreligionists in\nthe States are taxed to pay his salary.  He said it was not\nhis business.  He referred us to the Administrator.  The\nAdministrator refers me to you.  To whom do you refer me?  To the\ndevil, I suppose!\"\n\n\"The best thing you can do,\" said. Grim, \"is to go ahead and deny\nthat story about the offer to buy the Dome of the Rock.  You\nZionists have got the most efficient publicity bureau on earth.\nYou can reach the public ear any time you want to.  Deny the\nstory, and keep on denying it.\"\n\n\"Ah!  Who will believe us?  To be a Zionist is to be a person\nabout whom anybody will believe anything;  and the more absurd\nthe lie, the more readily it will be believed!  Meanwhile, the\nMoslems are sharpening their swords against us from one end of\nthis land to the other!\"\n\nI suppose that what Eisernstein really needed more than anything\nwas sympathy, not good advice.  Grim's deliberate coolness only\nirritated the passion of a man, whose whole genius and energy\nwere bent on realizing the vision of a nation of Jews firmly\nestablished in their ancient home.  A people that has been\ntortured in turn by all the governments can hardly be expected to\nproduce un-nervous politicians.  He was at the mercy of emotions,\nobsessed by one paramount idea.  A little praise just then of his\nloyalty to an ideal, to which he had sacrificed time, means,\nhealth, energy, everything, would have soothed him and hurt\nnobody.  But the acidity of his scorn had bitten beneath the\nsurface of Grim's good humor.\n\n\"There'll be no pogrom,\" Grim said, getting up and lighting a\ncigarette.  \"There'll be nothing resembling one.  But that won't\nbe the fault of you Zionists.  You accuse without rime or reason,\nbut you yell for help the minute you're accused yourselves.  I\ndon't blame the Arabs for not liking you.  Nobody expects Arabs\nto enjoy having their home invaded by an organization of\nforeigners.  Yet if this Administration lifts a finger to make\nthings easier for the Arabs you howl that it's unfair.\n\n\"If the Administrator refuses to arrest Arabs for talking a\nlittle wildly, you call him a Nero.  I'm neither pro- nor anti-\nZionist myself.  You and the Arabs may play the game out between\nyou for all of me.  But I can promise you there'll be no pogrom.\nIt is my business to know just what precautions have been taken.\"\n\n\"Words! Major Grim.  Words!\" sneered Eisernstein, getting up to\ngo.  \"What do words amount to, when presently throats are to be\ncut?  If your throat were in danger, I venture to say there would\nbe something doing, instead of mere talk about precautions!  I\nhope you will enjoy your little cigarette,\" he added bitterly.\n\"Good morning!\"\n\n\"Talk of fiddling while Rome burns!\" Grim laughed as soon as the\nZionist had left the room.  \"Has it ever occurred to you that\nNero was possibly smothering his feelings?  I wonder how long\nthere'd be one Zionist left out here, if we simply stood aside\nand looked on.  Go and change your clothes, Suliman.  It's time I\nbroke a leg.\"\n\nGrim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes\nlater in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of\nEmir Feisul's Syrian army.  Nothing could be smarter, not\nanything better calculated to disguise a man.  Disguise, as any\nactor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make-\nup as suggestion.  It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that\nidentify.  The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing\nto strive for, not the concealment of who you really are.\n\nGrim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under\nLawrence against the Turks.  The Shereefian helmet is a\ncompromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth\nhanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the\nears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress.\nThe khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it\nto distinguish it from that of a British officer.  No man\ninexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it;  for the\nsimple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough.  Yet\nGrim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to\nbelieve he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes\nbefore.  His mimicry of the Syrian military walk--blended of\npride and desire not to seem proud--was perfect.\n\n\"I'm now staff-captain Ali Mirza of Feisul's army,\" he announced.\n\"Ali Mirza a man notorious for his anti-British rancor, but\nsupposed to be down here just now on a diplomatic mission.  I've\nbeen seen about the streets like this for the last two days.  But\nsay:  that doctor is a long time on the way.\"\n\nHe went to the telephone, but did not call the hospital;  that\nwould have been too direct and possibly too secret.\n\n\"Give me Headquarters--yes--who's that?--never mind who's\nspeaking--say: I can't get the military hospital--something wrong\nwith the wire--will you call Major Templeton and say that Major\nGrim has had an accident--yes, Grim--compound fracture of the\nthigh--very serious--ask him to go at once to Major Grim's\nquarters--thanks--that's all.\"  He returned to the fireplace and\nstood watching me meditatively for several minutes.\n\n\"If you deceive Templeton, you'll do,\" he said at last.  \"Wait\na minute.\"\n\nHe went to the desk and scribbled something in Arabic on a sheet\nof paper, sealed that in a blank envelope, and handed it to me.\n\n\"Hide it.  You've two separate and quite distinct tasks, each\nmore important and, in a way, dangerous than the other.  The\nprincipal danger is to me, not you.  If they spot you, my\nnumber's as good as hoisted from that minute.  You mustn't kid\nyourself you're safe for one second until the last card has\nbeen played.\"\n\n\"Who are 'they'?\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that.  Your first job is to make it possible for\nme to get the confidence of one or two of these conspirators.\nYou're a deaf-and-dumb man--stone deaf--with a message for staff-\ncaptain Ali Mirza, which you will only deliver to him in person.\nSuliman does the talking.  You say nothing.  You simply refuse to\nhand your message over to any one but me.  They'll appreciate why\na deaf and dumb man should be chosen for treasonable business.\nBut perhaps you're scared--maybe you'd rather reconsider it?\nIt's not too late.\"\n\nI snorted.\n\n\"All right.  These conspirators meet at Djemal's coffee shop on\nDavid Street.  They talk to one another in French, because the\nproprietor and the other frequenters of the place only know\nArabic.  You know French and Arabic enough to understand a\nsentence here and there, so keep your ears wide open.  I shan't\nshow up until a Sikh named Narayan Singh tells me that a certain\nNoureddin Ali is in there.  He's the bird I'm after.  He's a\ndirty little murderer, and I'm going to be right pleasant to him.\n\n\"You may have to sit in the place all day waiting for me;  but\nwait until after midnight if you must.  Sooner or later Noureddin\nAli is bound to show up.  I shall be hard after him.  If they\noffer you food, take it.  Eat with your fingers.  Eat like a pig.\nLick the plate, if you like.  The nearer mad you seem to be, the\nsafer you are.  After I get there, hang around until I give you\nmoney.  Then beat it.\"\n\n\"Where to?  I can't go to my room at the hotel in this disguise.\"\n\n\"I've thought of that.  You know Cosmopolitan Oil Davey, of\ncourse?  He lives at the hotel.  I'll get word to him that he may\nexpect a messenger from me after dark tonight.  He'll leave word\nwith the porter downstairs, who'll take you to Davey's room.  You\ncan tell Davey absolutely anything.  He's white.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I can execute that maneuver.  What's task\nnumber two?\"\n\n\"To sit on the TNT!  But one thing at a time is enough.  Let's\nattend to this one first.  Ah!  Here comes Templeton!\"\n\n\"Damn you, Grim!\" said a calm voice in the doorway.  A tall, lean\nman in major's uniform with the blue tabs of the medical staff\nstrode in.  He had the dried-out look of the Sudan, added to the\nself-reliance that comes of deciding life and death issues at a\nmoment's notice.\n\n\"The hospital is crowded with patients, and here you immobilize\nme for half a morning.  I can't pretend to set a compound\nfracture in ten minutes, you know!  Why couldn't you break your\nneck and have me sign a death certificate?\"\n\n\"Didn't occur to me,\" said Grim.  \"But never mind, doc.  You need\na rest.  Here's tobacco, lots to read, and an armchair.  Lock\nyourself in and be happy.\"\n\n\"Who's this?\" asked Templeton, looking down at me.\n\n\"Deaf and dumb poor devil, earning a few piastres by working for\nthe Intelligence.\"\n\n\"Spy, eh?  He looks fit for honest work if he had all his\nfaculties.  Is he dumb as well as deaf, or because he's deaf?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" said Grim.  \"He never speaks.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I can do something for him.  Suppose you leave him here\nwith me.  I can give him a thorough examination instead of\nwasting my time here.\"\n\n\"He's got a job of work to do right now,\" said Grim.\n\n\"Does he know the sign language?  Have you any way of telling him\nto come and see me at the hospital?\"\n\n\"I give him written instructions in Arabic.\"\n\n\"That so?  I'll look at his ears--tell you in a minute whether\nit's worth while to come to me.\"\n\nHe took my head between strong, authoritative hands and tilted\nit sidewise.\n\n\"Hello!  What's this?\"\n\nThe Arab head-dress I was wearing shifted and showed\nnon-Arab symptoms.\n\n\"Open that bag of mine, will you, Grim, and pass me that big pair\nof forceps you'll find wrapped in oiled paper on top of\neverything.  There's something I can attend to here at once.\"\n\nIt was an uncomfortable moment.  Grim never cracked a smile.  He\ndug out the instrument of torture and gave it to Templeton.  But\nthere were two points that occurred to me, in addition to the\nknowledge that nothing whatever was the matter with my ear.\nDoctors in good standing, who are usually gentlemen, don't\noperate without permission;  and the forceps were much too big\nfor any such purpose.  So I sat still.\n\n\"Um-m-m!  What he really needs is a red-hot needle run down close\nto the ear-drum.  It wouldn't take five minutes, or hurt him--\nmuch.  After that I think he'd be able to hear perfectly.\nSuppose we try.\"\n\n\"I can wait ten minutes yet,\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Very well.  I've a platinum needle in the bag.  I'll get out the\nspirit-lamp and we'll soon see.  To be candid with you, I don't\nbelieve the man's any more deaf than you or I.\"\n\n\"If you run a hot needle through the lobe of his ear well\nfind out whether he can really talk or not,\" said Grim in\nhis pleasantest voice.  \"If he's shamming I don't mind.\nWhat we need in this service is a man who can endure without\nbetraying himself.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll soon see.\"\n\nI began to hate Grim pretty cordially.  I hated him more when\nSuliman came in, dressed for the street in a rather dirty cotton\nsmock, with a turban in place of his fez.  He told the boy to\nhold the wooden handle of a paper-knife behind my ear to prevent\nthe hot needle from going too far on its sizzling journey.\nIt didn't seem to me the way to reciprocate volunteer secret\nservice.  Suliman's grin at the prospect of seeing a man\ntortured was enough to provoke murder.  I brushed the boy aside,\nfly-fashion, got up, crossed the room, and sat down again in\nthe corner.\n\n\"Good enough!\" laughed Grim.  \"You'll do.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think he'll do,\" agreed Templeton.\n\nBut I took no notice.  I had seen too many games lost and won\nwith the last card.  Templeton looked down at Suliman:\n\n\"Tell him the game's over.  He may talk now.\"\n\n\"Mafish mukhkh!\" [No brains!] the boy answered, grinning and\ntapping his own forehead.  \"Magnoon!\" [Mad!]\n\n\"I think I can trust them both,\" said Grim, smiling in my\ndirection.  \"All right, old man;  time out!  If you'd spoken once\nthere'd have been nothing more between you and a life of safety\nand respectability!\"\n\n\"Whereas,\" said Templeton, \"you may now be unsafe and an outlaw\nand enjoy yourself!  Are you sure they haven't marked him?\" he\nasked Grim.\n\n\"Sure!  Why should they suspect a tourist?  But I've taken\nprecautions.  Word is on the way to the hotel to forward all his\nmail to Jaffa until further notice.\"  He laughed at me again.  \"I\nhope you're not expecting important letters!\"\n\nSuliman had evidently been well schooled in advance, for at a nod\nfrom Grim he came over and took my hand, as if I were blind in\naddition to the other supposed infirmities.  He led me out by a\nback-door, across a yard into an alley, which we followed as far\nas a main road and then turned toward the Jaffa Gate.  Looking\nback once I saw Grim in his Shereefian uniform striding along\nbehind us;  but where the road forked he took the other turning.\n\nThere is contentment in walking disguised through crowded\nstreets, even when you are in tow of eight-year-old iniquity that\nregards you as a lump of baggage to be pushed this and that way.\nSuliman plainly considered me a rank outsider, only admitted into\nthe game on sufferance.  Having said I was \"magnoon\" he lived up\nto the assertion, and warned people to make way for me if they\ndid not want to be bitten and go mad, too;  so as a general rule\nI received a pretty wide berth.  But it was fun, in spite of\nSuliman.  It was like seeing the world through a peep-hole.  Men\nand women you knew went by without suspecting they were\nrecognized, and in a puzzling sort of way the world, that had\nbeen your world yesterday, seemed now to belong wholly to other\npeople, while you lived in a new sphere of your own.\n\nWe had to go slowly as we approached the Jaffa Gate, for the\ncrowd was dense there, and a line of Sikhs was drawn across the\ngap where the street passes through the city wall.  It was the\ngap the Turks once made by tearing down the wall to let the\nKaiser through, when he made that famous meek and humble\npilgrimage of his.  The Sikhs were searching all comers for\nweapons, and we had to wait our turn.\n\nOutside the gate, on the left-hand as you faced it, was the usual\nline of boot-blacks--the only cheap thing left in Jerusalem--a\nmotley two dozen of ex-Turkish soldiers, recently fighting the\nBritish gamely in the last ditch, and now blacking their boots\nwith equal gusto, for rather higher pay.  Some of them still wore\nTurkish uniforms.  Two or three were redheaded and blue-eyed, and\nalmost certainly descended from Scotch crusaders.  (The whole\nwide world bears witness that when the Scots went soldiering they\nwere efficient in more ways than one.)\n\nThe rest of the crowd were mainly peasantry with basket-loads of\nstuff for market;  but there was a liberal sprinkling among them\nof all the odds and ends of the Levant, with a Jew here and\nthere, the inevitable Russian priest, and a dozen odd lots,\nof as many nationalities, whom it would have been difficult\nto classify.\n\nAnd there was Police Constable Bedreddin Shah.  You could not\nhave missed noticing him, although I did not learn his name until\nafterwards.  He came swaggering down the Jaffa Road with all the\nbullying arrogance of the newly enlisted Arab policeman.  He\nshoved me aside, calling me a name that a drunken donkey-driver\nwould hesitate to apply to a dog in the gutter.  He was on his\nway to the lock-up that stands just inside the gate, and I wished\nhim a year in it.\n\nAs he plunged into the crowd that checked and surged immediately\nin front of the line of Sikhs, a small man in Arab costume with\nthe lower part of his face well covered by the kaffiyi,* rushed\nout from the corner behind the bootblacks and drove a long knife\nhome to the hilt between the policeman's shoulder-blades.  I\nwasn't shocked.  I wasn't even sorry. [*Head-dress that hangs\ndown over the shoulders.]\n\nBedreddin Shah shrieked and fell forward.  Blood gushed from the\nwound.  The crowd surged in curiously, and then fell back before\nthe advancing Sikhs.  A British officer who had heard the\nvictim's cry came spurring his horse into the crowd from inside\nthe gate.  In his effort to get near the victim he only added to\nthe confusion.\n\nThe murderer, who seemed in no particular hurry, dodged quietly\nin and out among the swarm of bewildered peasants, and in thirty\nseconds had utterly disappeared.  A minute later I saw Grim\noffering his services as interpreter and stooping over the dying\nman to try to catch the one word he was struggling to repeat.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\n\"Windy bellies without hearts in them.\"\n\n\nDjemal's coffee shop is run by a Turkish gentleman whose real\nname is Yussuf.  One name, and the shorter the better, had been\nplenty in the days when Djemal Pasha ran Jerusalem with iron\nruthlessness, and consequent success of a certain sort.  When\nDjemal was the Turkish Governor, every proprietor of every kind\nof shop had to stand in the doorway at attention whenever Djemal\npassed, and woe betide the laggard!\n\nIt would not have paid any one, in those days, to name any sort\nof shop after Djemal Pasha.  Even the provider of the rope that\nthrottled the offender would have made no profit, because the\nrope would simply have been looted from the nearest store.\nThe hangman would have been the nearest soldier, whose pay\nwas already two years in arrears.  So Yussuf's own name done\nin Turkish characters used to stand over the door before the\nBritish came.\n\nIt was Djemal Pasha's considered judgment that Yussuf cooked the\nbest coffee in Jerusalem.  So whenever the despot was in the city\nhe conferred on Yussuf the inestimable privilege of supplying him\nwith coffee at odd moments, under threat of the bastinado if the\nstuff were not suitably sweet and hot.  The only money that ever\nchanged hands in that connection was when the tax-gatherer came\ndown on Yussuf for an extra levy, because of the added trade that\nconceivably might be expected to accrue through the advertisement\nobtained by serving such an exalted customer.  The tax-gatherer\nalso threatened the bastinado;  and as the man who likes that\npunishment, or who could soften the heart of a Turkish tax\nassessor, has yet to be discovered, Yussuf invariably paid.\n\nBut when Allenby conquered Palestine between bouts of trying to\ntame his Australians, and Djemal Pasha scooted hot-foot into\nexile with a two-hundred-woman harem packed in lorries at his\nrear, Yussuf remembered that old adage about better late than\nnever.  He put Djemal's name on the stone arch of the narrow door\nnear the foot of David Street.  He did it partly out of the\ndisrespect that a small dog feels for a big one that is now on\nchain;  but he was not overlooking the business value of it.\n\nThe first result was that he did quite a lot of trade with\nBritish officers, who came primarily because they were sick of\neating sand and bully-beef, and drinking sand and tepid water in\nthe desert.  Later they flocked there by way of paying indirect\nhomage to a governor who, whatever his obvious demerits, had at\nany rate never been answered back or thwarted with impunity.\n(There was a time, after the capture of Jerusalem, when if the\nBritish army could have voted on it, Djemal Pasha would have been\nbrought back and given a free hand.)\n\nBut the officers began to discover that Yussuf was charging them\nfour or five times the proper price.  The seniors objected\npromptly, and deserted, to the inexpressible delight of the\nsubalterns;  but even the under-paid extravagant youths grew\ntired of extortion after a month or two, and Yussuf had to look\nelsewhere for customers.\n\nYussuf did some thinking behind that genial Turkish mask of his.\nCompetition was keen.  There are more coffee shops in Jerusalem\nthan hairs on a hog's back, and the situation, down near the\nbottom of that narrow thoroughfare in the shadow of an ancient\narch, did not lend itself to drawing crowds.\n\nBut there were others in Jerusalem besides the British officers\nwho yearned for Djemal's rule again;  and, unlike the irreverent\nmen in khaki, they did not dare to voice their feelings in\npublic.  All the old political grafters, and all the would-be new\nones savagely resented a regime under which bribery was not\npermitted;  and, as always happens sooner or later, they began to\nshow a tendency to meet in certain places, where they might talk\nviolence without risk of incurring it.\n\nSo Yussuf permitted a rumour to gain ground that he, too, was a\nmalcontent and that the British had deserted his coffee shop for\nthat reason.  He gave out that Djemal Pasha's name over the door\nstood for reaction and political intrigue.  So his place began to\nbe frequented by effendis in tarboosh and semi-European clothes,\nwho could chew the cud of bitterness aloud between walls that the\ncrusaders had built four feet thick.  The only entrance was\nthrough the narrow front door, where Yussuf inspected every\nvisitor before admitting him.\n\nSo Yussuf's \"Cafe Djemal Pasha\" was the place to go to for\npolitics, of the red-hot, death-and-dynamite order that would\nmake Lenin and Trotsky sound like small-town sports.  But first\nyou had to get by Yussuf at the door.\n\nSuliman led me by the hand down David Street, through the smelly-\nyelly moil of flies and barter, past the meat and vegetable\nstalls, beneath the crusader arches from which Jewish women\npeered through trellised windows, across three transversing lanes\nof the ancient suku,* and halted at Yussuf's door.  [*Bazaar]\n\nHe rapped on it three times.  When Yussuf's wrinkled face\nappeared at last Suliman demanded to see Staff-Captain Ali Mirza.\nYussuf's blood-shot eyes peered at me for a long time before he\nasked a question.\n\n\"Atrash!--akras!--majnoon!!\" [Deaf!--Dumb!--Mad!!] said Suliman.\nDescribing me as mad seemed to give him particular delight.  He never\noverlooked a chance of doing it.\n\n\"Staff-Captain Ali Mirza is not here.  What should a Madman want\nwith him?\"\n\n\"He is not very mad--only stupid.  He carries a message for\nthe captain.\"\n\n\"But the captain is not here.  He has not been here.\"\n\n\"He will come.\"\n\n\"How should a deaf-and-dumb man deliver a message?\"\n\n\"It is in writing.\"\n\n\"Very well.  He may leave the writing with me.  If the captain\ncomes I will deliver it.\"\n\n\"No. The message is from Esh-Sham (Damascus).  He will give it\nonly into the captain's own hand.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Suliman.\"\n\n\"What is his?\"\n\n\"God knows!  He came with another man by train;  and the other\nman, who is much more mad than this one, gave me five piastres to\nbring this one to your kahwi!\"  [Coffe-pot]\n\nYussuf shut the door, and discussed the proposition with his\ncustomers.  At the end of two or three minutes his head\nappeared again.\n\n\"You say Staff-Captain Ali Mirza is expected here?\"\n\n\"So said the man at the station.\"\n\n\"What do you know of Staff-Captain Ali Mirza?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nOnce more the door closed and I could hear the murmur of\nvoices inside--but only a confused murmur, for the door was\nthick.  When it opened again two other heads were peering\nfrom behind Yussuf's.\n\n\"Has he money?\" he asked.\n\n\"Kif?  Ma indi khabar!\" [How should I know?]\n\nYussuf opened the door wide and made a sign for me to enter.  He\nseemed in two minds whether to let Suliman come in with me or\nnot, but finally admitted him with a gruff admonition to keep\nstill in one place and not talk.\n\nThe place was fairly full.  It was a square room, with one window\nhigh in the wall on David Street.  Around three sides, including\nthat on which was the front door, ran a wooden seat furnished\nwith thin cushions.  Facing the front door was another one\nleading to a dark hole in the rear, where pots were washed and\nrice was boiled;  beside that door, occupying most of the length\nof the fourth wall, was a thing like an altar of dressed stone,\non which the coffee was prepared in dozens of little copper pots.\n\nThe benches being pretty well occupied, I was about to squat down\non the floor, but they made room for me close to the front door,\nso I squatted on the corner of the bench and tucked my legs under\nme.  Suliman dropped down on the floor in front of me with his\nhead about level with my knees.\n\nThe other occupants of the room were all Syrian Arabs--not a\nBedouin among them.  All of them wore more or less European\nclothing, with the inevitable tarboosh, each set at a different\nangle.  You can guess the mentality of the Syrian by the angle of\nthat red Islamic symbol he wears on his head.  The black tassel\nnormally hangs behind, and the steady-going conservatives and all\nwho take their religion seriously, wear the inverted flower-pot-\nshaped affair as nearly straight up as the cranium permits.\n\nBut once let a Syrian take up new politics, join the Young Turk\nParty, forswear religion, or grow cynical about accepted\ndoctrine, and the angle of his tarboosh shows it, just as surely\nas the angle of the London Cockney's \"bowler\" betrays irreverence\nand the New York gangster's \"lid\" expresses self-contempt\ndisguised as self-esteem.\n\nThe head-gears were set at every possible angle in that coffee-\nshop of Yussuf's, from the backward tilt of the breezy optimist\nto the far-forward thrust down over the eye of malignant\ncynicism, which usually went with folded arms, legs thrust out\nstraight, and heels together on the floor.\n\nYussuf brought me coffee without waiting to be asked.  I paid him\na half-piastre for it, which is half the proper price, and\nutterly ignored his expostulation.  He touched me on the\nshoulder, displayed the coin in the palm of his hand and went\nthrough a prodigious pantomime.  I did not even try to appear\ninterested.  He ordered Suliman to explain to me.\n\n\"Mafish mukhkh!\" said the boy, touching his own forehead.\n\nMy real motive was to act as differently as possible from the\nwhite man, who always pays twice what he should.  By establishing\nthe suggestion of accustomed meanness, I hoped to offset any\nbreaks I might make presently.  Spies, and people of that kind,\nusually have plenty of money for their needs, so that by acting\nthe part of a man unused to spending except in minute driblets I\nstood a better chance of not being detected.\n\nBut I was in luck.  I have often noticed, so that it has become\nalmost an article of creed with me, that luck invariably breaks\nthat way.  It almost never turns up blind.  You sit down and wait\nfor luck, and it all goes to the other fellow.  But start to use\nyour wits, even clumsily, and the luck comes along and squanders\nitself on you.\n\n\"He is certainly from Damascus,\" laughed one of the customers.\n\"The price is a half-piastre in Damascus at the meaner shops.\"\n\nI did not know anything about Damascus then--had never been\nthere;  but from that minute it never entered the mind of one of\nthose men to doubt that Damascus was my home-city, so easily\nsatisfied by trifling suggestions is the unscientific human.\nYussuf went back to his charcoal stove grumbling to himself\nin Turkish.\n\nBut there was still one question in doubt.  They seemed satisfied\nthat I was really deaf and dumb, but in that land of countless\nmission schools and alien speech there is always a chance that\neven children know a word or two of French.  They tested Suliman\nwith simple questions, such as who was his mother and where was\nhe born;  but he did not need to act that part, he was utterly\nignorant of French.\n\nSo they proceeded to ignore the two of us and turn their\npolitical acrimony loose in French, discussing the maddest, most\nunmoral schemes with the gusto of small boys playing pirates.\nThere seemed to be almost as many rival political parties as men\nin the room.  The only approach to unity was when they agreed to\naccuse and destroy.  As for constructive agreement, they had\nnone, and every one's suggestion for improvement was sneered at\nby all the rest.  They were not even agreed about the Zionists,\nexcept hating them;  they quarreled about what would be the\nbest way to take advantage of them before wiping them out\nof existence.\n\nBut they all saw exquisite humour in the item of news that\nEisernstein had taken so to heart.\n\n\"That was Noureddin Ali's idea!  He is a genius!  To accuse the\nZionists of offering two million pounds for the Dome of the\nRock--ah! who else could have thought of it!  The story has spread\nall through Jerusalem, and is on its way to the villages.  In two\ndays it will be common gossip from Damascus to Beersheba.  In a\nweek it will be known from end to end of Egypt;  then Arabia;\nthen India!  Ho!  When the Indian Moslems get the news--the\nIndian troops in Palestine will send it by mail--then what a\nfuror!  Then what anger!  That was finesse!  That was true\nstatesmanship!  Never was a shrewder genius than Noureddin Ali!\"\n\n\"Don't shout his name too loud,\" said somebody.  \"The\nAdministration suspects him already.\"\n\n\"Bah!  Who in this room is a friend of the Administration?  The\nAdministrator is a broken shard;  the British will summon him\nhome for inefficiency.  Besides, there is only one man in\nJerusalem of whom Noureddin is in the least afraid--that Major\nGrim, the American.  And whoever would give the price of a cup of\ncoffee for a lease of the life of Major Grim in the circumstances\nwould do better to toss the money to the first beggar he meets!\"\n\n\"Hssh!\"\n\n\"Hah!  All the same, I would not choose to be Noureddin's enemy.\"\n\n\"There is another one who will share that opinion--or so I have\nheard.  I was told that Bedreddin Shah, a recent recruit in the\npolice, stumbled by accident on certain evidence and demanded a\nhuge sum for silence.  Hee-hee!  How much will anybody give\nBedreddin Shah for his prospect?\"\n\n\"Hssh!\"\n\n\"What did Bedreddin Shah discover?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows.\"\n\n\"You mean nobody will tell.\"\n\n\"The same thing.\"\n\n\"How long could a secret be kept in Jerusalem, if you people were\ninformed of what is going on?  You are good for propaganda, that\nis all!  You can talk--Allah! how you all talk!  But as for doing\nanything, or keeping a secret until a thing is done, you are no\nbetter than magpies.\"\n\nThe last speaker was a rather fat man, over in the corner by the\nscullery door.  He had a nose like Sultan Abdul Hamid's and\nlarge, elongated eyes that looked capable of seeing things on\neither side of him while he stared straight forward.  Even in\nthat dark corner you could see they had the alligator-hue that\none associates with cruelty.  He had the massive shoulders and\nforward-stooping position as he sat cross-legged on the seat that\nsuggest deliberate purpose devoid of hurry.\n\nThey all resented what he said, but none seemed disposed to\nquarrel with him.  One or two remonstrated mildly, but he ignored\ntheir remarks, busying himself with digging out a cigarette from\na gold case set with jewels;  after he had lighted it very\nthoughtfully and examined the end once or twice to make sure that\nit burned just right, he let it hang between his lips in a way\nthat accentuated the angle of his bulbous nose.  You wondered\nwhether he owned a harem, and what the ladies thought of him.\n\n\"Will you sit and brag in here all day?\" he asked after a few\nminutes.  \"Yussuf must be getting rich, you sip so much coffee.\nIt is not particularly good for Yussuf to get rich;  it will make\nhim lazy, as most of you are.\"\n\nThe chattering had ceased, although there were several attempts\nto break that uncomfortable silence with inane remarks.  His\nravenish, unpleasant voice seemed to act on the company like a\nchill wind, depriving treason of its warm sociableness but\nleaving in the sting.\n\n\"I said you are good for propaganda,\" he resumed, tossing away\nash with a reflective air.  \"But even that has no value within\nfour walls.  If Noureddin Ali should come and learn from me how\nmuch talking has been done in here, and how little done outside,\nI can imagine he will not be pleased.  Are there no other\nkahawi?*  Why is that story about the Zionists and their offer to\nbuy the Dome of Rock not being spread diligently?  You like the\nsafety of this place with its four thick walls.  But I tell you\nthe jackal has to leave his hole to hunt.\" [*Coffee-shops]\n\nThey did not like taking orders, even when they were expressed\nmore or less indirectly;  no follower of the new political\nfreedom does like it, for it rather upsets the new conceit.  But\nhe evidently knew his politicians, and they him.  They got up one\nby one and made for the door, each offering a different excuse\ndesigned to cover up obedience under a cloak of snappy independence.\nNot one of them drew a retort from him, or as much as a farewell nod.\n\nWhen the last one was gone, and the process took up all of half-\nan-hour, he sat and looked down his nose at me for several\nminutes without speaking.  You could have guessed just as easily\nwhat an alligator was thinking about, and I tried to emulate him,\npretending to go off into the brown study that the Turks call\nkaif, out of which it is considered bad manners to disturb your\nbest friend, let alone a stranger.  But manners proved to be no\nbarrier in his case.\n\nHe began talking to me in Arabic--directly at me, slowly and\ndeliberately, but I did not understand very much of it and it was\nnot difficult to pretend I did not hear.  However, Suliman was in\ndifferent case;  the boy began to get very restless under the\nmonolog, and I tugged at his back hair more than once to remind\nhim of the part he had to play.\n\nDiscovering that the Arabic took no effect on me, the alligator\nperson changed to French.\n\n\"They speak French in Damascus.  I know you are not deaf.  You\nare a spy.  I know your name.  I know what your business was\nbefore you came here.  I know why you want to see the staff-\ncaptain.  You have a letter for him;  I know what is in it.   No\nuse trying to deceive me;  I have ways of my own of discovering\nthings.  Do you know what happens to spies who refuse to answer\nmy questions?  They are attended to.  Quite simple.  They receive\nattention.  Nobody hears of them again.\n\n\"There are drains in Jerusalem--big, dark, smelly, ancient, full\nof rats--very useful drains.  You think the Staff-Captain Ali\nMirza will protect you.  At a word from me he will make the\nrequest that you receive immediate attention.  You will disappear\ndown a drain, where even Allah will forget that you ever existed.\nStaff-Captain Ali Mirza is my old friend.  Better let me see\nthat letter.\"\n\nI felt like laughing at the drain threats although Suliman was\nstill shivering from the effect of the earlier Arabic version.\nBut the statement that he knew the real Ali Mirza might be true,\nin which case Grim's disguise was not going to last long.\nHowever, the fact that he had not yet seen through my disguise\nwas some comfort.  The wish being father of the thought, I\ndecided he was bluffing first and last.  But he had not finished\nyet.  He tried me in English.\n\n\"The captain will give that letter to me in any case.  It is\nintended for me.  I have other business now, and wish to save\ntime, so give it to me at once.  Here, I will give you ten\npiastres for it.\"\n\nHe pulled out a purse and unfolded a ten-piastre note.  I took no\nnotice.  He shook it for me to see, and I awoke like a pelican at\nthe sight of fish.\n\n\"Yours for that letter,\" he said, shaking it again.\n\nI nudged Suliman and nodded to him.  He crossed the room, seized\nthe ten-piastre note, and brought it back to me.  I stowed it\naway under my shirt.\n\n\"Come, now give me the letter.\"\n\nI took utterly no notice, so he turned his attention to Suliman\nagain, and resumed in Arabic.\n\n\"Feel in his pocket and find the letter.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" the boy answered.\n\n\"Of what?  Of him?  I will protect you.  Take the letter from\nhim.\"\n\nSuliman chose to play the small boy, as he could very well indeed\nwhen nothing could be gained by being devilish and ultra-grown-\nup.  He shook his head and grinned sheepishly.\n\n\"Has he any weapons?\" was the next question.\n\n\"Ma indi khabar.\" [I don't know.]\n\nEvidently assault and battery was to be the next item on the\nprogram.  He had not the eyes or the general air of a man who\nwill part with ten piastres for nothing.  He called to Yussuf,\nwho came hurrying out of the scullery place.  They held a\nwhispered conference, and Yussuf nodded;  then he came over to\nthe front door and locked it, removing the key.\n\n\"Tell him to hand over that letter!\" he ordered Suliman.\n\n\"Mafish mukhkh!\" said the boy, tapping his forehead once more.\n\nSuliman's notion was the right one after all--at any rate the\nonly one available.  Old alligator rolled off his perch and\nstarted for me.  Yussuf timed his own assault to correspond.\nThey would have landed on me simultaneously, if Suliman had not\nreminded me that madness is a safe passport nearly anywhere in\nthe East.\n\nSo I went stark, raving mad that minute.  I once spent a night in\nthe room of an epileptic who had delirium tremens, and learned a\nlot from him;  some of it came to mind just when I needed it.  If\never a man got ten piastres' worth of unexpected side-show it was\nthat old Syrian with the alligator eyes.  By the time I was quite\nout of breath there wasn't a cushion or a coffee-pot fit for\nbusiness.  Suliman was standing out of reach on the bench in a\ncorner yelling with laughter, while the two men struggled to get\nthrough the scullery door, which was too narrow to admit them\nboth at once.  I earned that ten piastres.  By the same token\nI did not let the kaffiyi fall off my head and betray my\nwestern origin.\n\nUnable to think up any more original motions, and having breath\nfor none, I sat on the floor and spat repeatedly, having seen a\nmadman do that on the Hebron Road and get feared, if not\nrespected for it.  There seems to be a theory prevalent in that\npart of the world that the sputum of a madman is contagious.\n\nBut I overdid it.  Most amateurs do overdo things.\n\nThey got so afraid that they decided to put me out into the\nstreet at all costs, where those enemies of society, the police,\nmight demonstrate their ingenuity.  Yussuf made a dash for the\nfront door, and I suppose he would have called in help and ended\nmy share in the adventure, if something had not happened.\n\nThe \"something\" was Noureddin Ali very much something in his\nown opinion.\n\n\"Why didn't you open the door sooner?\" he demanded.  \"I have been\nknocking for two minutes.\"\n\nHe watched Yussuf lock the door again behind him, and then eyed\nthe disheveled room with amused curiosity.  He was a rat-faced\nlittle man dressed in a black silk jacket, worsted pants and\nbrown boots, with the inevitable tarboosh set at an angle of\nsheer impudence--a man at least fifty years old by the look of\nhim, but full of that peppery vigor that so often clings to\nlittle men in middle life.  On the whole he looked more like a\nschool-teacher, or a lawyer then a conspirator;  but Yussuf\naddressed him with great deference as \"Noureddin Ali Bey,\" and\neven old alligator-eyes became obsequious.\n\nBoth Yussuf and the other man began explaining the situation to\nhim in rapid-fire Arabic.  I, meanwhile, recovering from the fit\nas fast as I dared and trying to remember how to do it.\nNoureddin Ali was plainly for having me thrown out, until they\nmentioned the name of Staff-Captain Ali Mirza;  at that he tried\nto cross-examine Suliman at great length, but could get nothing\nout of him.  Suliman had evidently overheard Grim talking about\nNoureddin Ali, and was very much afraid of him.\n\n\"All right,\" Noureddin Ali said at last.  \"No more business\ntoday, Yussuf.  Keep the door locked, but admit the captain.  We\nmust find out what this message is about.\"\n\nYussuf went to tidying up the place, while Noureddin Ali and the\nalligator person talked excitedly in low tones in the corner near\nthe scullery door.  I lay on the floor with one eye open,\nexpecting Grim every minute;  but it must have been four in the\nafternoon before he came, and all that while, with only short\nintervals for food and coffee, Noureddin Ali and the other man\ntalked steadily, discussing over and over again the details of\nsome plan.\n\nShortly after midday Suliman began to whimper for food.  Yussuf\nproduced a mess of rice and mutton, of which the two Syrians ate\nenormously before giving any to the boy;  then they put what was\nleft in the dish on the floor in front of me, pretty much in the\nway you feed a dog, and I hate to remember what I did to it.\nIt is enough that I did not overlook Grim's advice to eat\nlike a lunatic, and however suspicious of me Noureddin Ali\nmight otherwise have been he was satisfied at the end of\nthat performance.\n\nSeveral people tried the door, and some of them made signals on\nit but Yussuf had a peep-hole where one of the heavy iron nails\nhad been removed, and after a cautious squint through it at each\narrival he proceeded to ignore them.  One man thundered on the\ndoor for several minutes, but was allowed to go away without as\nmuch as a word of explanation.\n\nThat was the first incident that made me feel quite sure\nNourreddin Ali was in fear of the police.  All the time the\nthundering was going on he glanced furtively about him like a rat\nin a trap.  I saw him feel for a weapon under his arm-pit.  When\nthe noise ceased and the impatient visitor went away he sighed\nwith relief.  The place was certainly a trap;  there was no back\nway out of it.\n\nWhen Grim came at last he knocked quietly, and waited in silence\nwhile Yussuf applied his eye to the nail-hole.  When he entered,\nthe only surprising thing about him seemed to me the thinness of\nhis disguise.  In the morning, when I had seen him change in ten\nminutes from West to East, it had seemed perfect;  but, having\nlooked for him so long with the Syrian disguise in mind, it\nseemed impossible now that any one could be deceived by it.  He\nwas at no pains to keep the kaffiyi thing close to his face,\nand I held my breath, expecting to see Noureddin Ali denounce\nhim instantly.\n\nBut nothing of that sort happened.  Grim sat down, thrust his\nlegs out in front of him, leaned back and called for coffee.  It\nwas obvious at once that the alligator person had been lying when\nhe boasted of knowing Staff-Captain Ali Mirza, for he made no\neffort to claim acquaintance or to denounce him as an impostor.\nBut he nodded to Suliman, and Suliman came over and nudged me.\n\nI let the boy go through a lot of pantomimic argument before\nadmitting that I understood, but finally I crossed the room to\nGrim and offered him the envelope.  He looked surprised, examined\nthe outside curiously, spoke to me, shrugged his shoulders when I\ndid not answer, tossed a question or two to Suliman, shrugged\nagain and tore the letter open.  Then his face changed, and he\nglanced to right and left of him as if afraid of being seen.  He\nstuffed the letter into his tunic pocket and I went back to the\ncorner by the front door.\n\nYussuf was pottering about, still rearranging all the pots and\nfurniture that I had scattered, but his big ears projected\nsidewise and suggested that he might have another motive.\nHowever, it was a simple matter to evade his curiosity by talking\nFrench, and Noureddin All could contain himself no longer.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir?  Staff-Captain Ali Mirza?\"\n\nGrim nodded suspiciously.\n\n\"I have heard of you.  We have all heard of you.  We are proud to\nsee you in Jerusalem.  We wish all success to your efforts on\nbehalf of Mustapha Kemal, the great Turkish Nationalist leader.\nOur prayer is that he may light such a fire in Anatolia as shall\nspread in one vast conflagration throughout the East!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Grim suspiciously.  (Evidently the real Ali\nMirza had a reputation for gruff manners.)\n\n\"Noureddin Ali Bey.  It may be you have heard of me.  I am not\nwithout friends in Damascus.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you Noureddin Ali?\" Grim's attitude thawed appreciably.\n\"We have been looking for more action and less talk from you.  I\nmade an excuse to visit Jerusalem and discover how much fire\nthere is under this smoke of boasting.\"\n\n\"Fire!  Ha-ha!  That is the right word!  There is a camouflage of\ntalk, but under it--Aha!  You shall see!\"\n\n\"Or is that more talk?\"\n\n\"We are not all talkers.  Wait and see!\"\n\n\"Oh, more waiting?  Has Mustapha Kemal Pasha waited in Anatolia?\nHas he not set you all an example of deeds without words?  Am I\nto wait here indefinitely in Jerusalem to take him news of deeds\nthat will never happen?\"\n\n\"Not indefinitely, my dear captain!  And this time there will\nreally be a deed that will please even such a rigorous lover of\naction as Mustapha Kemal!\"\n\nGrim shrugged his shoulders again.\n\n\"I leave for Damascus at dawn,\" he said cynically.  \"I don't care\nto be mocked there for bringing news of promises.  We have had\ntoo many of those barren mares.  I shall say that I have found\neverything here is sterile--the talk abortive--the men mere windy\nbellies without hearts in them!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\n\"I'll have nothing to do with it!\"\n\n\nNoureddin Ali was pained and upset.  Grim had pricked his\nconceit--had sent thrust home where he kept his susceptibilities.\nHe blinked, peered this and that way, exchanged glances with the\nalligator person, and then tucked his legs up under him.\n\n\"In me you see a doer!\" he announced.  He looked the part.  His\nlean, pointed nose and beady little eyes were of the interfering,\nmeddling type.  You could not imagine him, like the yellow-eyed\nruminant next to him, sitting and waiting ruthlessly for things\nto happen.  Noureddin Ali looked more likely to go out and\nbe ruthless.\n\n\"So they all say!\" Grim retorted.\n\n\"Some one should forewarn them in Damascus what a deed will occur\nhere presently.  Above all, word should reach Mustapha Kemal, in\nAnatolia, as soon as possible, so that he may be ready to act.\"\n\n\"All day long,\" said Grim, \"I have wandered about Jerusalem,\nlistening to this and that rumour of something that may happen.\nBut I have not found one man who can tell me a fact.\"\n\n\"That is because you did not meet me.  I am--hee-hee!  I am the\nfather of facts.  You say you leave for Damascus at dawn?  You\nare positive?  I could tell you facts that would put a sudden end\nto my career if they were spread about Jerusalem!\"\n\n\"That is the usual boast of men who desire credit in the eyes of\nthe Nationalist Party,\" Grim retorted.\n\n\"I see you are skeptical.  That is a wise man's attitude, but I\nmust be cautious, for my life is at stake.  Now--how do you\npropose to leave Jerusalem?  There is no train for Damascus at\ndawn tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I am on a diplomatic mission,\" answered Grim.  \"The\nAdministration have placed a car at my disposal to take me as far\nas the border.\"\n\n\"Ah!  And tonight?  Where will you be tonight?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I propose to make a disclosure.  And--ah--hee-hee!--you\nwould like to live, I take it, and not be sent back to Damascus\nin a coffin?  I have--ah--some assistants who--hee-hee!--would\nwatch your movements.  If you were to betray me afterwards to the\nAdministration, there would remain at least--the satisfaction--\nof--you understand me?--the certainty that you would suffer\nfor it!\"\n\nGrim laughed dryly.\n\n\"I shall be at the hotel,\" he answered.  \"In bed.  Asleep.  The\ncar comes before dawn.\"\n\n\"That is sufficient.  I shall know how to take essential\nprecautions.  Now--you think I am a man of words, not deeds?  You\nwere near the Jaffa Gate this morning, for I saw you there.  You\nsaw a man killed--a policeman, name Bedreddin.  That was an\nunwise underling, who stumbled by accident on a clue to what I\nshall tell you presently.  He had the impudence to try to\nblackmail me--me, of all people!  You saw him killed.  But did\nyou see who killed him?  I--I killed him, with this right hand!\nYou do not believe?  You think, perhaps, I lack the strength for\nsuch a blow?  Look here, where the force of it broke my skin on\nthe handle of the knife!  Now, am I a man of words, not deeds?\"\n\n\"You want me to report to Mustapha Kemal that all the\naccomplishment in Jerusalem amounts to one policeman killed?\"\n\n\"No, no!  You mistake my meaning.  My point is that having proved\nto you I am a ruthless man of action, I am entitled to be\nbelieved when I tell you what next I intend to do.\"\n\n\"Well--I  listen.\"\n\n\"There is going to be--hee-hee!--an explosion!\"\n\n\"Where?  When?  Of what?\"\n\n\"In Jerusalem, within a day or two, and of what?  Why, of high\nexplosive, what else?\"\n\n\"Much good an explosion in this city will do Mustapha Kemal!\"\nGrim grumbled.  \"You may kill a few beggars and break some\nwindows.  The British will double the guards afterward at all the\ncity gates, and that will be the end of it;  except that some of\nyou, who perhaps may escape being thrown into jail, will apply to\nMustapha Kemal for high commissions in his army on the strength\nof it!  Great doings!  Mustapha Kemal will have no bastinadoed.\"\n\n\"Hee-hee!  You are going to be surprised.  What would you say to\nan explosion, for instance, that destroyed the Dome of the Rock?\"\n\n\"That might accomplish results.\"\n\n\"Hee-hee!  You admit it!  An explosion to be blamed on the\nZionists, who must afterward be protected by the British from the\nmob!  Would that not set India on fire?\"\n\n\"It might help.  But who is to do it?\"\n\n\"You see the doer before you!  I will do it.\"\n\n\"If I thought such a thing was really going to take place--\"\n\n\"You would think that news worth carrying, eh?  You would hurry\nto Damascus, wouldn't you?  And let me assure you, my dear\ncaptain, speed is essential.  There are reasons why the explosion\nhas not yet occurred--reasons of detail and difficulties to be\novercome.  But now there is little further prospect of delay.\nEverything is nearly ready.  The explosive is not yet in place,\nbut is at hand.  The authorities suspect nothing.  There remains\nonly a little excavation work, and then--hee-hee!--nothing to do\nbut choose the hour when hundreds are in the mosque.  Houp-la!\nUp she goes.  Does not the idea appeal to you?\"\n\n\"Sensational--very,\" Grim admitted.\n\n\"Ah!  But the utmost must be made of the sensation.  Men must be\nready in Damascus to stir public feeling on the strength of it.\nWord must go to Mustapha Kemal to strike hard while the iron is\nhot.  There must be reprisals everywhere.  Blood must flow.\n\n\"The Europeans, French as well as British, must be goaded into\nmaking rash mistakes that will further inflame the populace.  It\nmust be shouted from the house-tops that the Jews have blown up a\nMoslem sacred place, and that the British are protecting them.\nThere must be a true jihad* proclaimed against all non-Moslems\nalmost simultaneously everywhere.  Do you understand now how\nswiftly you must travel to Damascus?\" [*Holy war.]\n\nGrim nodded.  \"Yet these foreigners are cunning,\" he said\ndoubtfully.  \"Are you sure your plan is not suspected?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.  There was one man--a cursed interfering jackanapes\nof an American, whom they all call Jimgrim, of whom I was afraid.\nHe is clever.  He goes snooping here and there, and knows how to\ndisguise himself.  But he fell downstairs this morning and broke\nhis thigh in two places.  If anything could make me religious,\nthat would!  If I were not a nationalist, I would say 'Glory\nto God, and blessed be His Prophet, who has smitten him whom\nwe feared!\"'\n\n\"That broken leg might be a trick to put you off your guard,\"\nGrim suggested pleasantly.\n\n\"No.  I made secret enquiries.  He is in great pain.  He may lose\nthe leg.  The doctor who has charge of the case is a Major\nTempleton, an irritable person and, like most of the English, too\nbig a fool to deceive anybody.  No, luckily for Mister Jimgrim it\nis not a trick.  Otherwise he would have shared the fate today of\nBedreddin Shah the constable.  The trap was all ready for him.\nWith the inquisitive and really clever out of the way there is\nnothing to be feared.  Now--pardon me, Captain Ali Mirza, but\nthat letter you received just now;  would you like to show it\nto me?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Grim demanded, frowning, and bridling all over.\n\n\"Hee-hee!  For the sake of reciprocity.  I have told you my\nsecret.  If it were not that I am more than usually circumspect,\nand accustomed to protect myself, one might say that my life is\nnow in your hands, captain.  Besides--hee-hee!--I might add that\nJerusalem is my particular domain.  I would have no difficulty in\nseeing that letter in any case.  But there should be no need for\n--hee-hee!--shall we call them measures?--between friends.\"\n\n\"I see you are a man of resource,\" said Grim.\n\n\"Of great resource, with picked lieutenants.  May I see the\nletter now?\"\n\nGrim produced it.  Noureddin Ali took it between spidery fingers\nand examined it like a schoolmaster conning a boy's composition.\nBut the expression of his face changed as he took in the\ncontents, holding the paper so that alligator-eyes could read\nit, too.\n\n\"Who wrote this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can't you read the signature?  Enver Eyub.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"One of Mustapha Kemal's staff.\"\n\n\"So.  'In pursuing your mission you will also take steps to\nascertain whether or not Noureddin Ali Bey is a person worthy of\nconfidence.'  Aha!  That is excellent!  So Mustapha Kemal Pasha\nhas heard of me?\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"And the rest of your mission?\"\n\n\"Is confidential.\"\n\n\"And are you satisfied that I am to be trusted?\"\n\n\"I think you mean business.\"\n\n\"Then you should tell me what is the nature of your secret\nmission to Jerusalem.  Possibly I can give you needed information.\nIf you have obtained information of value, you should confide in\nme.  I can be most useful when I know most.\"\n\nGrim frowned.  He began to look uneasy.  And the more he did that,\nthe more delight Noureddin Ali seemed to take in questioning him,\nbut be pleaded his own case, too.\n\n\"The trouble with the Nationalist movement,\" he insisted, \"is\nlack of unity.  There is no mutual confidence--consequently no\ncombination.  There are too many intellects working at cross\npurposes.  You should tell me what is being done, so that I may\nfit in my plans accordingly.  When the Dome of the Rock has been\nblown up there will be ample opportunity for putting into\nexecution a combined plan.  You must confide in me.\"\n\n\"Suppose I get rid of that messenger and the boy first,\"\nGrim suggested.\n\nGrim felt in his pocket and produced a purse full of bank notes.\nBut they were all big ones.\n\n\"Never mind, I have change,\" said Noureddin Ali.  \"How much will\nyou give him?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grim.  \"The boy can take him to the hotel.  Let him\nwait for me there.  He has no further business here.  He should\nreturn to Damascus.  He had better travel with me in the car\ntomorrow morning.  Take him to the hotel, and wait for me there,\nyou,\" he added in Arabic to Suliman.\n\nYussuf came and opened the door.  Suliman took my hand and led me\nout.  The door slammed shut behind me, and a great Sikh, leaning\non his rifle at a corner thirty feet away, came to life just\nsufficiently to follow me up-street with curious brown eyes.\n\n\"That is Narayan Singh,\" announced Suliman when we had passed\nhim.  \"He is Jimgrim's friend.\"\n\nThere was another Sikh just in sight of him at the next corner,\nand another beyond him again, all looking rather bored but\nawfully capable.  None except the first one took the slightest\nnotice of us.\n\nIt was some consolation to know that \"Jimgrim's friend\" was on\nguard outside Yussuf's.  I had no means of knowing what weapons\nGrim carried, if any, but was positive of one thing:  if either\nNoureddin Ali or the man with alligator eyes should get an\ninkling of his real identity his life would not be worth ten\nminutes' purchase.  Including Yussuf, who would likely do as he\nwas told, there would be three to one between those silent walls,\nand it seemed to me that Narayan Singh might as well be three\nmiles away as thirty feet.  However, there was nothing I could do\nabout it.\n\nIt was late afternoon already, and the crowd was swarming all one\nway, the women carrying the baskets and the men lording it near\nenough to keep an eye on them.  If Suliman and I were followed,\nwhoever had that job had his work cut out, for we were swallowed\nup in a noisy stream of home-going villagers, whose baskets and\nother burdens made an effectual screen behind us as well as\nin front.\n\nThe hotel stands close by the Jaffa Gate, and there the crowd was\ndensest, for the outgoing swarm was met by another tide, of city-\nfolk returning.  In the mouth of the hotel arcade stood an\nofficer whom I knew well enough by sight--Colonel Goodenough,\ncommander of the Sikhs, a quiet, gray little man with a monocle,\nand that air of knowing his own mind that is the real key to\ncontrol of Indian troops.  Up a side-street there were a dozen\ntroop-horses standing, and a British subaltern was making himself\nas inconspicuous as he could in the doorway of a store.  It did\nnot need much discernment to judge that those in authority were\nready to deal swiftly with any kind of trouble.\n\nBut the only glimpse I had of any mob-spirit stirring was when\nthree obvious Zionist Jews were rather roughly hustled by some\nHebron men, who pride themselves on their willingness to brawl\nwith any one.  Two Sikhs interfered at once, and Goodenough, who\nwas watching, never batted an eyelash.\n\nI was tired, wanted a whiskey and soda and a bath more than\nanything else I could imagine at the moment.  I was eager to get\nto my room in the hotel.  Suliman, being not much more than a\nbaby after all, wanted to go to sleep.  We went past Goodenough,\nwho eyed me sharply but took no further notice, and we entered\nthe hotel door.  But there we were met by Cerberus in the shape\nof an Arab porter, who cursed our religion and ordered us out\nagain, threatening violence if we did not make haste.\n\nSuliman argued with him in vain, and even whimpered.  There was\nnothing for it but to return to the arcade, where I sat down on a\nstep, from which a native policeman drove me away officiously.  I\nhad about made up my mind to go and speak to Goodenough in\nEnglish, when Grim appeared.  Not even Goodenough recognized him,\nhis Syrian stride was so well acted.  He saluted, and the salute\nwas returned punctiliously but with that reserve toward a\nforeigner that the Englishman puts on unconsciously.  When Grim\nspoke to him in Arabic Goodenough answered in the same language.\nI did not hear what was said at first, but as I drew closer I\nheard the sequel, for Grim changed suddenly to English.\n\n\"If you can't recognize me through that magnifying-glass of\nyours, colonel, I must be one leopard who can really change his\nspots.  I'm Grim.  Don't change your expression.  Quick:  look\naround and tell me if I'm followed.\"\n\n\"Hard to say.  Such a crowd here.  There's a Syrian over the way\nwith a bulbous nose, who came along after you;  he's leaning with\nhis back to the wall now, watching us.\"\n\n\"He's the boy.\"\n\n\"I see Narayan Singh has left his post.  Did you give\nhim orders?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Told him to follow any one who followed me.  I don't want\nthat fellow interfered with.  He may stay there, or more likely\nhe'll call others to take his place;  they'll watch all night, if\nthey're allowed to;  let them.  Wish you'd give orders they're to\nbe left alone.  Then, please let Narayan Singh go off duty and\nget some sleep;  I'm going to want him all day tomorrow.\"\n\n\"All right, Grim;  anything else?\"\n\n\"First opportunity, I wish you'd come to Davey's room upstairs.\nNow--long distance stuff again, sir--if any Syrian asks you about\nme, you might say I was making sure the car would come for me\nat dawn.\"\n\nThey exchanged salutes again as one suspicious alien to another.\nGrim looked suitably surprised at sight of me, and led me and\nSuliman back to the hotel, where Suliman wanted him to wreak dire\nvengeance on the porter;  he grew sulky when he discovered that\nhis influence with Grim was not sufficient for the purpose, but\nforgot it, small boy fashion, ten minutes later, when he fell\nasleep on the floor in a corner of Davey's room.\n\nDavey did not look exactly pleased to see us, although he seemed\nto like Grim personally, and was the first that day to see\nthrough Grim's disguise at the first glance.  Mrs. Davey, on the\nother hand, was radiant with smiles--thrilled at the prospect of\nlearning secrets.  She produced drinks and pushed the armchairs\nup.  When she learned who I was, her husband could hardly keep\nher from putting on a costume too, to make a party of it.\n\nDavey was reserved.  He asked no questions.  A gray-headed, gray-\neyed, stocky, sturdy-looking man, who had made impossibilities\ncome true on three continents, he waited for trouble to come to\nhim instead of seeking it.  There was silence for several minutes\nover the cigars and whiskey before Grim opened fire at last.  He\ntalked straight out in front of Mrs. Davey, for she had mothered\nCosmopolitan Oil men in a hundred out-of-the-way places.  She\nknew more sacred secrets than the Sphinx.\n\n\"Any news about your oil concessions, Davey?\"\n\n\"No.  Not a word.  We've got every prospect in the country marked\nout.  Nothing to do now but wait for the mandate, while the\nZionists go behind our backs to the Foreign Office and scheme for\nthe concessions.  It's my belief the British mean to favor the\nZionists and put us in the ditch.  The fact that we were first on\nthe ground, and lodged our applications with the Turks before the\nwar seems to make no difference in their lives.\"\n\n\"Well, old man, I've arranged for you to change your policy,\"\nsaid Grim.\n\n\"What in thunder do you mean?\"\n\nMrs. Davey giggled with delight, but her husband\nfrowned ominously.\n\n\"I'm supposed to be Staff-Captain Ali Mirza of the\nShereefian army.\"\n\n\"I've heard of him.  He's a bad one, Jim.  He is one of those\nSyrian Arabs who will accept any one's money, but who never stays\nbought.  Why masquerade as a scoundrel?\"\n\n\"I was in a place just now with a bunch of murderers, who'd have\nmade short work of me if I couldn't give them a sound reason for\nbeing in Jerusalem just now.\"\n\n\"Why not have 'em all arrested?\"\n\n\"For the same reason, Davey, that your Oil Company isn't piping\nten thousand barrels a day from Jericho.  The time is not yet.\nThings haven't reached that stage.  I told them your Oil Company\ngave up hope long ago of getting a concession from the British,\nand has decided to finance Mustapha Kemal.\"\n\nDavey flung his cigar out of the window, and laid both hands on\nhis knees.  His face was a picture of baffled indignation.  But\nhis wife laughed.\n\n\"They were tickled to death,\" Grim continued.  \"I'm supposed to\nbe going to Damascus tomorrow morning with a hundred thousand\ndollars in U.S. gold, obtained from you in ten small bags.  We've\ngot to find some bags and pack them full of something heavy.\"\n\n\"I'll have nothing to do with it!\" Davey exploded at last.  \"It's\na damned outrage!  Why--this tale will be all over the place.\nThe Jews will get hold of it, and make complaints in London.\nNext you know, the U.S. State Department will be raising blue\nhell.  Questions asked in Congress.  Headlines in all the papers!\nWhat do you suppose our people will think of me?\"\n\n\"Refer them to your wife, Davey.  She's got you out of much\nworse messes.\"\n\n\"I'll drive the car straight up to OETA and lodge my protest\nagainst this in less than fifteen minutes!\"\n\n\"No need;  Davey, old man.  Goodenough will be in here presently.\nKick to him.\"\n\nMrs. Davey went into the next room and returned with a roll of\ncoarse cotton cloth.\n\n\"I've no bags, Jim, but if this stuff will do I can sew some\nright now.\"\n\n\"Good enough, Emily, go to it.\"\n\n\"D'you want to lose me my job?\" demanded Davey.  But his wife\ntook up the scissors and smiled back at him.\n\n\"You know better than that.  We've trusted Jim before.\"\n\n\"Listen, Davey;  this thing's serious,\" said Grim.\n\n\"I know it is!  So'm I!  Nothing doing!\"\n\n\"You're on the inside of an official secret.\"\n\n\"Curse all official secrets!  My business is oil!\"\n\n\"There'll be no oil in this man's land for any one for fifty\nyears if you won't play.  There'll be a jihad instead.  They're\nplanning to blow up the Dome of the Rock.\"\n\n\"Jee-rusalem!\"\n\n\"Straight goods, Davey.  Two tons of TNT stolen, and our friend\nScharnhoff, the Austrian, hunting for the Tomb of the Kings--\ndigging for it day and night--conspirators waiting to run in the\nexplosive as soon as the tunnel is complete.\"\n\n\"Why not arrest 'em at once?\"\n\n\"We want to catch the principals red-handed, explosive and all.\nWe don't know where the explosive is yet.  Bag the lot, and kill\nthe story.  Otherwise, d'you see what it means, if the news leaks\nout?  They'll blame the attempt on the Jews.  And the minute the\nBritish protect the Jews there'll be all Moslem Asia on fire.\nGet me?\"\n\n\"Get you?  Yes, I get you.  I'll get hell from the home office,\nthough, for meddling in politics.\"\n\nGoodenough came in then, rather a different man from the stern\nlittle martinet who had stood in the throat of the arcade.  He\nwas all smiles.\n\n\"Evening, Mrs. Davey,\" he said genially.  \"That one man went\naway, Grim, and three took his place.  They shan't be disturbed.\nNarayan Singh has gone off duty.  Now, Mrs. Davey, I've been told\nthat Americans all went dry, on account of a new religion called\nthe Volstead Act.  D'you mean to say you'd tempt a thirsty\nsoldier with a dry martini?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\n\"The Enemy is nearly always useful if you leave him free to\nmake mistakes.\"\n\n\nThe next item on the program was to awaken Suliman.  He did not\nwant to wake up.  He had lost all interest in secret service for\nthe time being.  Even the sight of Mrs. Davey's New York candy\ndid not stir enthusiasm;  he declared it was stuff fit for\nbints,* not men.   [*Women]\n\n\"All right then,\" Grim announced at last.\n\n\"School for you, and I'll get another side-partner.\"\n\nThat settled it.  The boy, on whose lips the word dog was a foul\nepithet, was actually proud to share a packing-case bedroom with\nJulius Caesar the mess bull-dog.  School, where there would be\nother iniquitous small boys to be led into trouble, had no\nparticular terrors.  But to lose his job and to see another boy,\nperhaps a Jew or a Christian, become Jimgrim's Jack-of-all-jobs\nwas outside the pale of inflictions that pride could tolerate.\n\n\"I am awake!\" he retorted, rubbing his eyes to prove it.\n\n\"Come here, then.  D'you know where to find your mother?\"\n\n\"At the place where I went yesterday.\"\n\n\"Take her some of Mrs. Davey's candy.  Don't eat it on the way,\nmind.  Get inside the place if you can.  If she won't let you in\ntry how much you can see through the door.  Ask no questions.  If\nshe asks what you've been doing, tell her the truth:  say that\nyou cleaned my boots and washed Julius Caesar.  Then come back\nhere and tell me all you've seen.\"\n\n\"Sending him to spy on his own mother, Jim?\" asked Mrs. Davey as\nSuliman left the room with candy in both fists.  She paused from\nstitching at the cotton bags to look straight at Grim.\n\n\"His mother is old Scharnhoff's housekeeper,\" Grim answered.\n\"Scharnhoff wouldn't stand for the boy, and drove him out.  The\nmother liked Scharnhoff's flesh-pots better than the prospects of\nthe streets, so she stayed on, swiping stuff from Scharnhoff's\nlarder now and then to slip to the kid through the back door.\nBut he was starving when I found him.\"\n\nMrs. Davey laid her sewing down.\n\n\"D'you  mean to tell me that that old butter-wouldn't-melt-in-\nhis-mouth professor is that child's father?\"\n\n\"No.  The father was a Turkish soldier--went away with the\nTurkish retreat.  If he's alive he's probably with Mustapha Kemal\nin Anatolia.  Old Scharnhoff used to keep a regular harem under\nthe Turks.  He got rid of them to save his face when our crowd\ntook Jerusalem.  He puts up with one now.  But he has the\nthorough-going Turk's idea of married life.\"\n\n\"And to think I had him here to tea--twice--no, three times!  I\nliked him, too!  Found him interesting.\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Grim.\n\n\"Very!\" agreed Goodenough.\n\n\"If it weren't for that harem habit of his,\" said Grim, \"some\nacquaintances of his would have blown up the Dome of the Rock\nabout this time tomorrow.  As it is, they won't get away with\nit.  Suliman came and told me one day that his mother was\ncarrying food to Scharnhoff, taking it to a little house in\na street that runs below the Haram-es-Sheriff.  I looked into\nthat.  Then came news that two tons of TNT was missing, on top\nof a request from Scharnhoff for permission to go about at night\nunquestioned.  After that it was only a question of putting\ntwo and two together--\"\n\n\"Plus Narayan Singh,\" said Goodenough.  \"I still don't see, Grim,\nhow you arrived at the conclusion that Scharnhoff is not guilty\nof the main intention.  What's to prove that he isn't in the pay\nof Mustapha Kemal?\"\n\n\"I'll explain.  All Scharnhoff cares about is some manuscripts he\nthinks he'll find.  He thinks he knows where they are.  The\nChronicles of the Kings of Israel.  I expect he tried pretty hard\nto get the Turks to let him excavate for them.  But the Turks\nknew better than to offend religious prejudices.  And perhaps\nScharnhoff couldn't afford to bribe heavily enough;  his harem\nvery likely kept him rather short of money.  Then we come along,\nand stop all excavation--cancel all permits--refuse to grant\nnew ones.\n\n\"Scharnhoff's problem is to dig without calling attention to what\nhe's doing.  As a technical enemy alien he can't acquire\nproperty, or even rent property without permission.  But with the\naid of Suliman's mother he made the acquaintance of our friend\nNoureddin Ali, who has a friend, who in turn has a brother, who\nowns a little house in that street below the Haram-es-Sheriff.\"\n\n\"Strange coincidence!\" said Goodenough.  \"It'll need a better\nargument than that to save Scharnhoff's neck.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir.  No coincidence at all.  Remember, Scharnhoff\nhas lived in Jerusalem for fifteen years.  He seems to have\nsatisfied himself that the Tomb of the Kings is directly under\nthe Dome of the Rock.  How is he to get to it?  The Dome of the\nRock stands in the middle of that great courtyard, with the\nbuildings of the Haram-es-Sheriff surrounding it on every\nside, and hardly a stone in the foundations weighing less than\nten tons.\n\n\"He reasons it out that there must be a tunnel somewhere, leading\nto the tomb, if it really is under the Dome of the Rock.  I have\nfound out that he went to work, while the Turks were still here,\nto find the mouth of the tunnel.  Remember, he's an archaeologist.\nThere's very little he doesn't know about Jerusalem.  He knows\nwho the owner is of every bit of property surrounding the\nHaram-es-Sheriff;  he's made it his business to find out.  So\nwhen he finally decided that this little stone house stands over\nthe mouth of the tunnel, all that remained to do was to get\naccess to it.  He couldn't do that himself, because of the\nregulations.  He had to approach the Arab owner secretly and\nindirectly.  That's where Suliman's mother came in handy.\n\n\"She contrived the introduction to Noureddin Ali.  Innocent old\nScharnhoff, who is an honest thief--he wouldn't steal money--\nsacrilege is Scharnhoff's passion--was an easy mark for Noureddin\nAli.  Noureddin Ali is a red-minded devil, so smart at seeing\npossibilities that he is blind to probabilities.  He is paid by\nthe French to make trouble, and he's the world's long-distance\ndouble-crosser.  I don't believe the French have any hand in this\njob.  Scharnhoff needed explosives.  Noureddin Ali saw at once\nthat if that tunnel can be found and opened up there could be\nan atrocity perpetrated that would produce anarchy all through\nthe East.\"\n\n\"As bad as all that?\" asked Mrs.  Davey.\n\n\"That's no exaggeration,\" Goodenough answered.  \"I've lived\ntwenty-five years in India, commanding Sikh and Moslem troops.\nThe Sikhs are not interested in the Moslem religion in any way,\nbut they'd make common cause with Moslems if that place were\nblown up and the blame could be attached to Jews.  It's the\nsecond most sacred place in Asia.  Even the Hindus would be\nstirred to their depths by it;  they'd feel that their own sacred\nplaces were insecure, and that whoever destroyed them would be\nprotected afterwards by us.\"\n\n\"Gosh!  Who'd be an Englishman!\" laughed Davey.\n\n\"I don't see that it's proved yet that the idea of an explosion\nwasn't Sharnhoff's in the first place,\" Goodenough objected.\n\n\"For one thing, he wouldn't want to destroy antiquities,\" said\nGrim.  \"They're his obsession.  He worships ancient history and\nall its monuments.  No, Noureddin Ali thought of the explosion.\nHe knew that Scharnhoff needed money, so he gave him French\nmoney, knowing that would put old Scharnhoff completely in his\npower.  Then he tipped off some one down at Ludd to watch for a\nchance to steal some TNT.  He had better luck than he expected.\nHe got two tons of it.  He didn't have all the luck, though.\nHis plan, I believe, was to time the fireworks simultaneously\nwith a French-instigated raid from El-Kerak.  But the raid\ndidn't come off.\"\n\n\"Scharnhoff will hang!\" said Goodenough.\n\n\"I think not, sir.  He'll prove as meek as an old sheep when we\nland on him.\"\n\n\"There, will the bags do?\" asked Mrs. Davey.\n\n\"What are they for?\" Goodenough asked.\n\n\"We're supposed to have a slush fund in this room of a hundred\nthousand dollars,\" Davey answered dourly.  \"My Oil Company is\nsupposed to be buying up Mustapha Kemal!  I see my finish, if\nnews of this ever reaches the States--or unless my version of it\ngets there first!\"\n\nGrim turned to me.\n\n\"We've got to find two people to take your place and mine in the\ncar tomorrow morning.  Perhaps you'd better go in any case;\nyou'll enjoy the ride as far as Haifa--stay there a day or two,\nand come back when you feel like it.  We'll find some officer to\nmasquerade as me.\"\n\nBut there I rebelled--flat, downright mutiny.\n\n\"If I haven't made good so far,\" I said, \"I'll consider myself\nfired, and hold my tongue.  Otherwise, I see this thing through!\nSend some one else on the joy-ride.\"\n\n\"Good for you!\" said Davey.\n\n\"Dammit, man!\" said Goodenough, staring at me through his\nmonocle.  \"The rest of us get paid for taking chances.  The only\ntangible reward you can possibly get will be a knife in your\nback.  Better be sensible and take the ride to Haifa.\"\n\n\"My bet is down,\" said I.\n\n\"Good,\" Grim nodded.  \"It goes.  All the same, you get a joy-\nride.  Can't take too many chances.  Tell you about that later.\nMeanwhile, will you detail an officer to come and spend the night\nin this hotel and masquerade as me at dawn, sir?  He can wear\nthis uniform that I've got on--somebody about my height.\"\n\n\"Turner will do that.  What are you going to put in the bags?\"\nasked Goodenough.\n\n\"Cartridges.  They're heavy.  You might tell Turner over the\nphone to bring them with him.\"\n\nAt that point Suliman returned, sooner than expected, with news\nthat made Grim whistle.  Suliman had not been inside the place\nwhere his mother was.  She would not let him.  But he had seen\naround her skirts as she stood in the partly opened door.\n\n\"There was a hole in the floor,\" said Suliman, \"and a great stone\nlaid beside it.  Also much gray dust.  And I think there was a\nlight a long way down in the hole.\"\n\nBut that was not what made Grim whistle.\n\n\"What else?  Did your mother say anything?\"\n\n\"She was ill-tempered.\"\n\n\"That Scharnhoff had beaten her.\"\n\n\"I knew he'd make a bad break sooner or later.  What did he beat\nher for?\"\n\n\"Because she was afraid.\"\n\n\"That's a fine reason.  Afraid of what?\"\n\n\"He says she is to sell oranges.  Four wooden benches have been\nbrought, and tomorrow they are to be set outside the door in the\nstreet.  Oranges and raisins have been bought, and she is to sit\noutside the door and sell them.  She is afraid.\"\n\n\"Fruit bought already?  Can't be.  Was it inside there?\"\n\n\"No.  It is to come tomorrow.  She says she does not know how to\nsell fruit, and is afraid of the police.\"\n\nGrim and Goodenough exchanged glances.\n\n\"She says that if the police come everybody will be killed, and\nthat I am to keep watch in the street in the morning and give\nwarning of the police.\"\n\n\"That should teach you, young man, never to take a woman into\nyour confidence--eh, Mrs. Davey?\" said Goodenough.\n\n\"We're certainly the slow-witted sex,\" she answered, piling the\nfinished bags one on top of the other on the table.\n\nGrim took me after that to the hotel roof, whence you can see the\nwhole of Jerusalem.  It was just before moonrise.  The ancient\ncity lay in shadow, with the Dome of the Rock looming above it,\nmysterious and silent.  Down below us in the street, where a\ngasoline light threw a greenish-white glare, three Arabs in\nnative costume were squatting with their backs against the low\nwall facing the hotel.\n\n\"Noureddin Ali's men,\" said Grim, chuckling.  \"They'll help us to\nprove our alibi.  The enemy is nearly always useful if you leave\nhim free to make mistakes.  You may have to spend the whole night\nin the mosque--you and Suliman.  I'll take you there presently.\nTwo of those men are pretty sure to follow us.  One will probably\nfollow me back here again.  The other will stay to keep an eye on\nyou.  About an hour before dawn, in case nothing happens before\nthat, you and Suliman come back here to the hotel.  The car shall\nbe here half-an-hour before daylight.  You and Turner pile into\nit, and those three men watch you drive away.  They'll hurry off\nto tell Noureddin Ali that Staff-Captain Ali Mirza and the\ndeaf-and-dumb man have really started for Damascus, bags of gold\nand all.\n\n\"Turner must remember to drop a couple of bags and pick them up\nagain, to call attention to them.  There'll be a change of\nclothes in the car for you.  When you've gone a mile or so, get\ninto the other clothes and walk back.  If I don't meet you by the\nJaffa Gate, Suliman will, or else Narayan Singh.  Things are\nliable to happen pretty fast tomorrow morning.  Let's go.\n\n\"I'm supposed to have found out somehow that you're awful\nreligious and want to pray, so it's the Dome of the Rock for\nyours.  Any Moslem who wants to may sleep there, you know.  But\nany Christian caught kidding them he's a Moslem would be for it--\nshort shrift.  He'd be dead before the sheikh of the place could\nhand him over to the authorities.  If the TNT were really in\nplace underneath you, which I'm pretty sure it won't be for a few\nhours yet, that would be lots safer than the other chance you're\ntaking.  So peel your wits.  Let Suliman sleep if he wants to,\nbut you'll have to keep awake all night.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do in there?  What's likely to happen?\"\n\n\"Just listen.  The tunnel isn't through to the end yet, I'm sure\nof it.  If it were, they'd have taken in the TNT, for it must be\nticklish work keeping it hidden elsewhere, with scores of Sikhs\nwatching day and night.  But they're very near the end of the\ntunnel, or they wouldn't be opening up that fruit stand.  You'll\nhear them break through.  When you're absolutely sure of that,\ncome out of the mosque and say Atcha--just that one word--to the\nSikh sentry you'll see standing under the archway through which\nwe'll enter the courtyard presently.  That sentry will be Narayan\nSingh, and he'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"What shall I do after that?\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.  Either return to the mosque and go to sleep, if\nyou can trust yourself to wake in time, or come and sit on the\nhotel step until morning.  Have you got it all clear?  It's a\npiece of good luck having you to do all this.  No real Moslem\nwould ever be able to hold his tongue about it.  They're\nsuperstitious about the Dome of the Rock.  But ask questions now,\nif you're not clear;  you mustn't be seen speaking in the street\nor in the mosque, remember.  All plain sailing?  Come along,\nthen.  If you're alive tomorrow you'll have had an adventure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seventeen\n\n\"Poor old Scharnhoff's in the soup.\"\n\n\nWe ate a scratch dinner with the Daveys in their room and started\nforth.  Grim as usual had his nerve with him.  He led me and\nSuliman straight up to the three spies who were squatting against\nthe wall, and asked whether there were any special regulations\nthat would prevent my being left for the night in the famous\nmosque.  On top of that he asked one of the men to show him the\nshortest way.  So two of them elected to come with us, walking\njust ahead, and the third man stayed where he was, presumably in\ncase Noureddin Ali should send to make enquiries.\n\nYou must walk through Jerusalem by night, with the moon just\nrising, if you want really to get the glamour of eastern tales\nand understand how true to life those stories are of old Haroun-\nal-Raschid.  It is almost the only city left with its ancient\nwalls all standing, with its ancient streets intact.  At that\ntime, in 1920, there was nothing whatever new to mar the setting.\nNo new buildings.  The city was only cleaner than it was under\nthe Turks.\n\nParts of the narrow thoroughfares are roofed over with vaulted\narches.  The domed roofs rise in unplanned, beautiful disorder\nagainst a sky luminous with jewels.  To right and left you can\nlook through key-hole arches down shadowy, narrow ways to carved\ndoors through which Knights Templar used to swagger with gold\nspurs, and that Saladin's men appropriated after them.\n\nYellow lamplight, shining from small windows set deep in the\nmassive walls, casts an occasional band of pure gold across the\nstoried gloom.  Now and then a man steps out from a doorway, his\nidentity concealed by flowing eastern finery, pauses for a\nmoment in the light to look about him, and disappears into\nsilent mystery.\n\nHalf-open doors at intervals give glimpses of white interiors,\nand of men from a hundred deserts sitting on mats to smoke great\nwater-pipes and talk intrigue.  There are smells that are\nstagnant with the rot of time;  other smells pungent with\nspice, and mystery, and the alluring scent of bales of\nmerchandise that, like the mew of gulls, can set the mind\ntraveling to lands unseen.\n\nThrough other arched doors, even at night, there is a glimpse of\nblindfold camels going round and round in ancient gloom at the\noil-press.  There are no sounds of revelry.  The Arab takes his\npleasures stately fashion, and the Jew has learned from history\nthat the safest way to enjoy life is to keep quiet about it.  Now\nand then you can hear an Arab singing a desert song, not very\nmusical but utterly descriptive of the life he leads.  We\ncaught the sound of a flute played wistfully in an upper room\nby some Jew returned from the West to take up anew the thread\nof ancient history.\n\nGrim nudged me sharply in one shadowy place, where the street\nwent down in twenty-foot-long steps between the high walls of\nwindowless harems.  Another narrow street crossed ours thirty\nfeet ahead of us, and our two guides were hurrying, only glancing\nback at intervals to make sure we had not given them the slip.\nThe cross-street was between us and them, and as Grim nudged me\ntwo men--a bulky, bearded big one and one of rather less than\nmiddle height, both in Arab dress--passed in front of us.  There\nwas no chance of being overheard, and Grim spoke in a low voice:\n\n\"Do you recognize them?\" \"I shook my head.\n\n\"Scharnhoff and Noureddin Ali!\"\n\nI don't see now how he recognized them.  But I suppose a man who\nworks long enough at Grim's business acquires a sixth sense.\nThey were walking swiftly, arguing in low tones, much too busy\nwith their own affairs to pay attention to us.  Our two guides\nglanced back a moment later, but they had vanished by then into\nthe gloom of the cross-street.\n\nThere was a dim lamp at one corner of that crossing.  As we\npassed through its pale circle of light I noticed a man who\nlooked like an Arab lurking in the shadow just beyond it.  I\nthought he made a sign to Grim, but I did not see Grim return it.\n\nGrim watched his chance, then spoke again:\n\n\"That man in the shadow is a Sikh--Narayan Singh's sidekick--\nkeeping tabs on Scharnhoff.  I'll bet old Scharnhoff has cold\nfeet and went to find Noureddin Ali to try and talk him out of\nit.  Might as well try to pretty-pussy a bob-cat away from a hen-\nyard!  Poor old Scharnhoff's in the soup!\"\n\nQuite suddenly after that we reached a fairly wide street and the\narched Byzantine gateway of the Haram-es-Sheriff, through which\nwe could see tall cypress trees against the moonlit sky and the\ndome of the mosque beyond them.  They do say the Taj Mahal at\nAgra is a lovelier sight, and more inspiring;  but perhaps that\nis because the Taj is farther away from the folk who like to have\nopinions at second-hand.  Age, history, situation, setting,\nsanctity--the Dome of the Rock has the advantage of all those,\nand the purple sky, crowded with coloured stars beyond it is more\nwonderful over Jerusalem, because of the clearness of the\nmountain air.\n\nIn that minute, and for the first time, I hated the men\nwho could plot to blow up that place.  Hitherto I had been\nmerely interested.\n\nBecause it was long after the hour when non-Moslem visitors are\nallowed to go about the place with guides, we were submitted to\nrather careful scrutiny by men who came out of the shadows and\nsaid nothing, but peered into our faces.  They did not speak to\nlet us by, but signified admittance by turning uninterested backs\nand retiring to some dark corners to resume the vigil.  I thought\nthat the Sikh sentry, who stood with bayonet fixed outside the\narch, looked at Grim with something more than curiosity, but no\nsign that I could detect passed between them.\n\nThe great white moonlit courtyard was empty.  Not a soul stirred\nin it.  Not a shadow moved.  Because of the hour there were not\neven any guides lurking around the mosque.  The only shape that\ncame to life as we approached the main entrance of the mosque was\nthe man who takes care of the slippers for a small fee.\n\nGrim, since he was in military dress, allowed the attendant to\ntie on over his shoes the great straw slippers they keep there\nfor that purpose.  Suliman had nothing on his feet.  I kicked off\nthe red Damascus slippers I was wearing, and we entered the\noctagonal building by passing under a curtain at the rear of the\ndeep, vaulted entrance.\n\nNobody took any notice of us at first.  It was difficult to see,\nfor one thing;  the light of the lamps that hung on chains from\nthe arches overhead was dimmed by coloured lenses and did little\nmore than beautify the gloom.  But in the dimness in the midst\nyou could see the rock of Abraham, surrounded by a railing to\npreserve it from profane feet.  Little by little the shadows took\nshape of men praying, or sleeping, or conversing in low tones.\n\nThe place was not crowded.  There were perhaps a hundred men in\nthere, some of whom doubtless intended to spend the night.  All\nof them, though they gave us a cursory glance, seemed disposed to\nmind their own business.  It looked for a minute as if we were\ngoing to remain in there unquestioned.  But the two spies who had\ncome with us saw a chance to confirm or else disprove our bona\nfides, and while one of them stayed and watched us the other went\nto fetch the Sheikh of the Mosque.\n\nHe came presently, waddling very actively for such a stout man--a\nbig, burly, gray-bearded intellectual, with eyes that beamed\nintelligent good-humour through gold-rimmed glasses.  He did not\nseem at all pleased to have been disturbed, until he drew near\nenough to scan our faces.  Then his change of expression, as soon\nas he had looked once into Grim's eyes, gave me cold chills all\ndown the back.  I could have sworn he was going to denounce us.\n\nInstead, he turned on the two spies.  He tongue-lashed them in\nArabic.  I could not follow it word for word.  I gathered that\nthey had hinted some suspicion as to the genuineness of Grim's\npretension to be Staff-Captain Ali Mirza.  He was rebuking them\nfor it.  They slunk away.  One went and sat near the door we had\nentered by.  The other vanished completely.\n\n\"Jimgrim!  What do you do here at this hour?\" asked the sheikh as\nsoon as we stood alone.\n\n\"Talk French,\" Grim answered.  \"We can't afford to be overheard.\"\n\n\"True, O Jimgrim!  It is all your life and my position is worth\nfor you to be detected in here in that disguise at such an hour!\nAnd who are these with you?\"\n\n\"It is all your life and mosque are worth to turn us out!\" Grim\nanswered.  \"When was I ever your enemy?\"\n\n\"Never yet, but--what does this mean?\"\n\n\"You shall know in the morning--you alone.  This man, who can\nneither hear nor speak, and the child with him, must stay in here\ntonight, and go when they choose, unquestioned.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim, this is not a place for setting traps for criminals.\nSet your watch outside, and none shall interfere with you.\"\n\n\"'Shall the heart within be cleansed by washing hands?'\" Grim\nquoted, and the shiekh smiled.\n\n\"Do you mean there are criminals within the mosque?  If so, this\nis sanctuary, Jimgrim.  They shall not be disturbed.  Set\nwatchmen at the doors and catch them as they leave, if you will.\nThis is holy ground.\"\n\n\"There'll be none of it left to boast about this time tomorrow,\nif you choose to insist!\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Should there be riddles between you and me?\" asked the sheikh.\n\n\"You shall know all in the morning.\"\n\nThe sheikh's face changed again, taking on a look of mingled rage\nand cunning.\n\n\"I know, then, what it is!  The rumour is true that those cursed\nZionists intend to desecrate the place.  This fellow, who you say\nis deaf and dumb, is one of your spies--is he not?  Perhaps he\ncan smell a Zionist--eh?  Well, there are others!  Better tell me\nthe truth, Jimgrim, and in fifteen minutes I will pack this place\nso full of true Moslems that no conspirator could worm his way\nin!  Then if the Jews start anything let them beware!\"\n\n\"By the beard of your Prophet,\" Grim answered impiously, \"this\nhas nothing to do with Zionists.\"\n\n\"Neither have I, then, anything to do with this trespass.  You\nhave my leave to depart at once, Jimgrim!\"\n\n\"After the ruin--\"\n\n\"There will be no ruin, Jimgrim!  I will fill the place\nwith men.\"\n\n\"Better empty it of men!  The more there are in it, the bigger\nthe death-roll!  Shall I say afterwards that I begged leave to\nset a watch, and you refused?\"\n\n\"You--you, Jimgrim--you talk to me of ruin and a death-roll?  You\nare no every-day alarmist.\"\n\n\"Did you ever catch me in a lie?\"\n\n\"No, Jimgrim.  You are too clever by far for that!  If you were\nto concoct a lie it would take ten angels to unravel it!  But--\nyou speak of ruin and a death-roll, eh?\"  He stroked his beard\nfor about a minute.\n\n\"You have heard, perhaps, that Moslems are sharpening their\nswords for a reckoning with the Jews?  There may be some truth in\nit.  But there shall be no gathering in this place for any such\npurpose, for I will see to that.  You need set no watch in here\non that account.\"\n\n\"The time always comes,\" Grim answered, \"when you must trust a\nman or mistrust him.  You've known me eleven years.  What are you\ngoing to do?\"\n\n\"In the name of God, what shall I answer! Taib,* Jimgrim, I will\ntrust you.  What is it you wish?\"  [*All right.]\n\n\"To leave this deaf-and-dumb man and the boy, below the\nRock, undisturbed.\"\n\n\"That cannot well be.  Occasionally others  go to pray in that\nplace.  Also, there is a Moslem who has made the pilgrimage from\nTrichinopoli.  I myself have promised to show him the mosque\ntonight, because he leaves Jerusalem at dawn, and only I speak a\nlanguage he can understand.  There will be others with him, and I\ncannot refuse to take them down below the Rock.\"\n\n\"That is nothing,\" Grim answered.  \"They will think nothing of a\ndeaf-and-dumb man praying or sleeping in a  a corner.\"\n\n\"Is that all he wishes to do?  He will remain still in one place?\nThen come.\"\n\n\"One other thing.  That fellow who went and fetched you--he sits\nover there by the north door now--he will ask you questions about\nme presently.  Tell him I'm leaving for Damascus in the morning.\nIf he asks what we have been speaking about so long, tell him I\nbrought you the compliments of Mustapha Kemal.\"\n\n\"I will tell him to go to jahannam!\"\n\n\"Better be civil to him. His hour comes tomorrow.\"\n\nThe sheikh led the way along one side of the inner of three\nconcentric parts into which the mosque is divided by rows of\nmarble columns, until we came to a cavernous opening in the\nfloor, where steps hewn in the naked rock led downward into a\ncave that underlies the spot on which tradition says Abraham made\nready to sacrifice his son.\n\nIt was very dark below.  Only one little oil lamp was burning, on\na rock shaped like an altar in one corner.  It cast leaping\nshadows that looked like ghosts on the smooth, uneven walls.  The\nwhole place was hardly more than twenty feet wide each way.\nThere was no furniture, not even the usual mats--nothing but\nnaked rock to lie or sit on, polished smooth as glass by\ncenturies of naked feet.\n\nI was going to sit in a corner, but Grim seized my arm and\npointed to the centre of the floor, stamping with his foot to\nshow the exact place I should take.  It rang vaguely hollow under\nthe impact, and Suliman, already frightened by the shadows,\nseized my hand in a paroxysm of terror.\n\n\"You've got to prove you're a man tonight and stick it out!\" Grim\nsaid to him in English;  and with that, rather than argue the\npoint and risk a scene, he followed the sheikh up the steps and\ndisappeared.  Grim's methods with Suliman were a strange mixture\nof understanding sympathy and downright indifference to sentiment\nthat got him severely criticized by the know-it-all party, who\nalways, everywhere condemn.  But he certainly got results.\n\nA legion of biblical and Koranic devils owned Suliman.  They were\nthe child's religion.  When he dared, he spat at the name of\nChristianity.  Whenever Grim whipped him, which he had to do now\nand again, for theft or for filthy language, he used to curse\nGrim's religion, although Grim's religion was a well-kept secret,\nknown to none but himself.  But the kid was loyal to Grim with a\ncourage and persistence past belief, and Grim knew how to worm\nthe truth out of him and make him keep his word, which is more\nthan some of the professional reformers know how to do with\ntheir proteges.  I believe that Suliman would rather have earned\nGrim's curt praise than all the fabulous delights of even a\nMoslem paradise.\n\nBut the kid was in torment.  His idea of manliness precluded any\nexhibition of fear in front of me, if he could possibly restrain\nhimself.  He would not have minded breaking down in front of\nGrim, for he knew that Grim knew him inside out.  On the\ncontrary, he looked down on me, as a mere amateur at the game,\nwho had never starved at the Jaffa Gate, nor eaten candle-ends,\nor gambled for milliemes* with cab-drivers' sons while picking up\nodds and ends of gossip for a government that hardly knew of his\nexistence.  In front of me he proposed to act the man--guide--\nshowman--mentor.  He considered himself my boss.  [*The smallest\ncoin of the country.]\n\nBut it was stem work.  If there had been a little noise to make\nthe shadows less ghostly;  if Suliman had not been full of half-\ndigested superstition;  or if he had not overheard enough to be\naware that a prodigious, secret plot was in some way connected\nwith that cavern, he could have kept his courage up by swaggering\nin front of me.\n\nHe nearly fell asleep, with his head in my lap, at the end of\nhalf-an-hour.  But when there was a sound at last he almost\nscreamed.  I had to clap my hand over his mouth;  whereat he\npromptly bit my finger, resentful because he knew then that I\nknew he was afraid.\n\nIt proved to be approaching footsteps--the sheikh of the mosque\nagain, leading the man from Trichinopoli and a party of three\nfriends.  Their rear was brought up by Noureddin;  Ali's spy,\nanxious about me, but pretending to want to overhear the sheikh's\naccount of things.\n\nThe sheikh reeled it all off in a cultured voice accustomed to\nusing the exact amount of energy required, but even so his words\nboomed in the cavern like the forethought of thunder.  You\ncouldn't help wondering whether a man of his intelligence\nbelieved quite all he said, however much impressed the man from\nTrichinopoli might be.\n\n\"We are now beneath the very rock on which Abraham was willing to\nsacrifice his only son, Isaac.  This rock is the centre of the\nworld.  Jacob anointed it.  King Solomon built his temple over\nit.  The Prophet of God, the Prince Mahommed, on whose head be\nblessings! said of this place that it is next in order of\nholiness after Mecca, and that one prayer said here is worth ten\nelsewhere.  Here, in this place, is where King Solomon used to\nkneel in prayer, and where God appeared to him.  This corner is\nwhere David prayed.  Here prayed Mahommed.\n\n\"Look up.  This hollow in the roof is over the spot where the\nProphet Mahommed slept.  When he arose there was not room for him\nto stand upright, so the Rock receded, and the hollow place\nremains to this day in proof of it.  Beneath us is the Bir-el-\nArwah, the well of souls, where those who have died come to pray\ntwice weekly.  Listen!\"\n\nHe stamped three times with his foot on the spot about two\nfeet in front of where I sat, and a faint, hollow boom answered\nthe impact.\n\n\"You hear?  The Rock speaks!  It spoke in plain words when the\nProphet prayed here, and was translated instantly to heaven on\nhis horse El-Burak.  Here, deep in the Rock, is the print of the\nhand of the angel, who restrained the Rock from following the\nProphet on his way to Paradise.  Here, in this niche, is where\nAbraham used to pray;  here, Elijah.  On the last day the Kaaba\nof Mecca must come to this place.  For it is here, in this cave,\nthat the blast of the trumpet will sound, announcing the day of\njudgment.  Then God's throne will be planted on the Rock above\nus.  Be humble in the presence of these marvels.\"\n\nHe turned on his pompous heel and led the way out again without\nas much as a sidewise glance at me.  The spy was satisfied;  he\nfollowed the party up the rock-hewn steps, and as a matter of\nfact went to sleep on a mat near the north door, for so I found\nhim later on.\n\nThe silence shut down again.  Suliman went fast asleep, snoring\nwith the even cadence of a clock's tick, using my knees for a\npillow with a perfect sense of ownership.  He was there to keep\ncare of me, not I of him.  The sleep suggestion very soon took\nhold of me, too, for there was nothing whatever to do but sit and\nwatch the shadows move, trying to liken them to something real as\nthey changed shape in answer to the flickering of the tiny, naked\nflame.  Thereafter, the vigil resolved itself into a battle\nwith sleep, and an effort to keep my wits sufficiently alert for\nsudden use.\n\nI had no watch.  There was nothing to give the least notion of\nhow much time had passed.  I even counted the boy's snores for a\nwhile, and watched one lonely louse moving along the wall--so\nmany snores to the minute--so many snores to an inch of crawling;\nbut the louse changed what little mind he had and did not walk\nstraight, and I gave up trying to calculate the distance he\ntraveled in zigzags and curves, although it would have been an\ninteresting problem for a navigator.  Finally, Suliman's\nsnoring grew so loud that that in itself kept me awake;  it\nwas like listening to a hair-trombone;  each blast of it rasped\nyour nerves.\n\nYou could not hear anything in the mosque above, although there\nwere only eleven steps and the opening was close at hand;  for\nthe floor above was thickly carpeted, and if there were any\nsounds they were swallowed by that and the great, domed roof.\nWhen I guessed it might be midnight I listened for the voice of\nthe muezzin;  but if he did call the more-than-usually faithful\nto wake up and pray, he did it from a minaret outside, and no\nfaint echo of his voice reached me.  I was closed in a tomb in\nthe womb of living rock, to all intents and purposes.\n\nBut it must have been somewhere about midnight when I heard a\nsound that set every vein in my body tingling.  At first it was\nlike the sort of sound that a rat makes gnawing;  but there\ncouldn't be rats eating their way through that solid stone.  I\nthought I heard it a second time, but Suliman's snoring made it\nimpossible to listen properly.  I shook him violently, and he\nsat up.\n\n\"Keep still!  Listen!\"\n\nBetween sleeping and waking the boy forgot all about the iron\nself-control he practised for Grim's exacting sake.\n\n\"What is it?  I am afraid!\"\n\n\"Be still, confound you!  Listen!\"\n\n\"How close beneath us are the souls of the dead?  Oh, I\nam afraid!\"\n\n\"Silence!  Breathe through your mouth.  Make no noise at all!\"\n\nHe took my hand and tried to sit absolutely still;  but the\ngnawing noise began again, more distinctly, followed by two or\nthree dull thuds from somewhere beneath us.\n\n\"Oh, it is the souls of dead men!  Oh--\"\n\n\"Shut up, you little idiot!  All right, I'll tell Jimgrim!\"\n\nFear and that threat combined were altogether too much for him.\nOne sprig of seedling manhood remained to him, and only one--the\nwill to smother emotion that he could not control a second\nlonger.  He buried his head in my lap, stuffing his mouth with\nthe end of the abiyi to choke the sobs back. I covered his head\ncompletely and, like the fabled ostrich, in that darkness he\nfelt better.\n\nSuddenly, as clear as the ring of glass against thick glass in\nthe distance, something gave way and fell beneath us.  Then\nagain.  Then there were several thuds, followed by a rumble that\nwas unmistakable--falling masonry;  it was the noise that bricks\nmake when they dump them from a tip-cart, only smothered by the\nthickness of the cavern floor.  I shook Suliman again.\n\n\"Come on.  We're going.  Now, let me have a good account of you\nto give to Jimgrim.  Shut your teeth tight, and remember the part\nyou've got to play.\"\n\nHe scrambled up the steps ahead of me, and I had to keep hold of\nthe skirts of his smock to prevent him from running.  But he took\nmy hand at the top, and we managed to get out through the north\ndoor without exciting comment, and without waking the spy,\nalthough I would just as soon have wakened him, for Grim seemed\nto think it important that his alibi and mine should be well\nestablished;  however, there were two others watching by the\nhotel.  Ten minutes later I was glad I had not disturbed him.\n\nI gave Suliman a two-piastre piece to pay the man who had charge\nof my slippers at the door, and the young rascal was so far\nrecovered from his fright that he demanded change out of it, and\nstood there arguing until he got it.  Then, hand-in-hand, we\ncrossed the great moonlit open court to the gate by which Grim\nhad brought us in.\n\nLooking back, so bright was the moon that you could even see the\nblue of the tiles that cover the mosque wall, and the interwoven\nscroll of writing from the Koran that runs around like a frieze\nbelow the dome.  But it did not look real.  It was like a\ndream-picture--perhaps the dream of the men who slept huddled\nunder blankets in the porches by the gate.  If so, they\ndreamed beautifully.\n\nThere was a Sikh, as Grim had said there would be, standing with\nfixed bayonet on the bottom step leading to the street.  He\nstared hard at me, and brought his rifle to the challenge as I\napproached him--a six-foot, black-bearded stalwart he was, with a\nlong row of campaign ribbons, and the true, truculent Sikh way of\ncarrying his head.  He looked strong enough to carry an ox away.\n\n\"Atcha!\" said I, going close to him.\n\nHe did not answer a word, but shouldered his rifle and marched\noff.  Before he had gone six paces he brought the rifle to the\ntrail, and started running.  Another Sikh--a younger man--stepped\nout of the shadow and took his place on the lower step.  He was\nnot quite so silent, and he knew at least one word of Arabic.\n\n\"Imshi!\" he grunted;  and that, in plain U.S. American, means\n\"Beat it!\"\n\nI had no objection.  It sounded rather like good advice.\nRemembering what Grim had said about the danger I was running,\nand looking at the deep black shadows of the streets, it occurred\nto me that that spy, who slept so soundly by the mosque door,\nmight wake up and be annoyed with himself.  When men of that type\nget annoyed they generally like to work it off on somebody.\n\nRather, than admit that he had let me get away from him he might\nprefer to track me through the streets and use his knife on me in\nsome dark corner.  After that he could claim credit with\nNoureddin Ali by swearing he had reason to suspect me of\nsomething or other.  The suggestion did not seem any more unreal\nto me than the moonlit panorama of the Haram-es-Sheriff, or the\nSikh who had stepped out of nowhere-at-all to \"Imshi\" me away.\n\nOn the other hand, I had no fancy for the hotel steps.  To sit\nand fall asleep there would be to place myself at the mercy of\nthe other two spies, who might come and search me;  and I was\nconscious of certain papers in an inner pocket, and of underclothes\nmade in America, that might have given the game away.\n\nBesides, I was no longer any too sure of Suliman.  The boy was so\nsleepy that his wits were hardly in working order;  if those two\nspies by the hotel were to question him he might betray the two\nof us by some clumsy answer.  If there was to be trouble that\nnight I preferred to have it at the hands of Sikhs, who are\nseldom very drastic unless you show violence.  I might be\narrested if I walked the streets, but that would be sheer profit\nas compared to half-a-yard of cold knife in the broad of my back.\n\n\"Take me to the house where you talked with your mother,\" I said\nto Suliman.\n\nSo we turned to the left and set off together in that direction,\nwatched with something more than mild suspicion by the Sikh, and,\nif Suliman's sensations were anything like mine, feeling about as\ncheerless, homeless and aware of impending evil as the dogs that\nslunk away into the night.  I took advantage of the first deep\nshadow I could find to walk in, less minded to explore than to\navoid pursuit.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eighteen\n\n\"But we're ready for them.\"\n\n\nWithout in the least suspecting it I had gone straight into a\nblind trap, into which, it was true, I could not be followed by\nNoureddin Ali's spy, but out of which there was no escape without\nbeing recognized.  The moment I stepped into the deep shadow I\nheard an unmistakable massed movement behind me.  Sure that I\ncould not be seen, I faced about.  A platoon of Sikhs had\nappeared from somewhere, and were standing at ease already,\nacross the end of the street I had entered, with the moonlight\nsilvering their bayonets.\n\nWell, most streets have two ends.  So I walked forward, not\ntaking much trouble about concealment, since it was not easy to\nwalk silently.  If the Sikh can't see his enemy he likes to fire\nfirst and challenge afterwards.  I preferred to be seen.  The\nsight of those uncompromising bayonets had changed my mind about\nthe choice of evils.  The knife of a hardly probable assassin\nseemed a wiser risk than the ready triggers of the Punjaub.\nHalf-way down the street Suliman tugged at my cloak.\n\n\"That is the place where my mother is,\" he said, pointing to a\nnarrow door on the left.\n\nBut I was taking no chances in that direction--not at that\nmoment.  The little stone house was all in darkness.  There were\nno windows that I could see.  No sound came from it.  And farther\ndown the street there was a lamp burning, whose light spelled\nsafety from shots fired at the sound of foot-fall on suspicion.\nI wanted that light between me and the Sikh platoon, yet did not\ndare run for it, since that would surely have started trouble.\nIt is my experience of Sikhs that when they start a thing they\nlike to finish it.  They are very good indeed at explanations\nafter the event.\n\nThe Sikhs must have seen us pass through the belt of gasoline\nlight, but they did not challenge, so I went forward more slowly,\nwith rather less of that creepy feeling that makes a man's spine\nseem to belong to some one else.  Toward its lower end the street\ncurved considerably, and we went about a quarter of a mile before\nthe glare of another light began to appear around the bend.\n\nThat was at a cross-street, up which I proposed to turn more or\nless in the direction of the hotel.  But I did nothing of the\nsort.  There was a cordon of Sikhs drawn across there, too, with\nno British officer in sight to enforce discretion.\n\nCome to think of it, I have always regarded a bayonet wound in\nthe stomach as the least desirable of life's unpleasantries.\n\nSo Suliman and I turned back.  I decided to investigate that dark\nlittle stone house, after all;  for it occurred to me that, if\nthat was the centre of conspiracy, then Grim would certainly show\nup there sooner or later and straighten out the predicament.\nHave you ever noticed how hungry you get walking about aimlessly\nin the dark, especially when you are sleepy in the bargain?\nSuliman began to whimper for food, and although I called him a\nbelly on legs by way of encouragement he had my secret sympathy.\nI was as hungry as he was;  and I needed a drink, too, which he\ndidn't.  The little devil hadn't yet included whiskey in his list\nof vices.\n\nThe side of the street an which the little stone house stood was\nthe darker, so we sat down with our backs against its wall, and\nthe boy proceeded to fall asleep at once.  The one thing I was\nsure I must not do was imitate him.  So I began to look about me\nin the hope of finding something sufficiently interesting to keep\nme awake.\n\nThere was nothing in the street except the makings of a bad\nsmell.  There was plenty of that.  I searched the opposite wall,\non which the moon shone, but there was nothing there of even\narchitectural interest.  My eyes traveled higher, and rested at\nlast on something extremely curious.\n\nThe wall was not very high at that point.  It formed the blind\nrear of a house that faced into a court of some sort approached\nby an alley from another street.  There were no windows.  A small\ndoor some distance to my left belonged obviously to the next\nhouse.  On top of the wall, almost exactly, but not quite, in the\nmiddle of it, was a figure that looked like a wooden carving--\nsomething like one of those fat, seated Chinamen they used to set\nover the tea counter of big grocer's shops.\n\nBut the one thing that you never see, and can be sure of not\nseeing in Jerusalem outside of a Christian church, is a carved\nhuman figure of any kind.  The Moslems are fanatical on that\npoint.  Whatever exterior statues the crusaders for instance\nleft, the Saracens and Turks destroyed.  Besides, why was it not\nexactly in the middle?\n\nIt was much too big and thick-set to be a sleeping vulture.  It\nwas the wrong shape to be any sort of chimney.  It was certainly\nnot a bale of merchandise put up on the roof to dry.  And the\nlonger you looked at it the less it seemed to resemble anything\nrecognizable.  I had about reached the conclusion that it must be\na bundle of sheepskins up-ended, ready to be spread out in the\nmorning sun, and was going to cast about for something else to\npuzzle over, when it moved.  The man who thinks he would not feel\nafraid when a thing like that moves in the dark unexpectedly has\ngot to prove it before I believe him.  The goose-flesh broke out\nall over me.\n\nA moment later the thing tilted forward, and a man's head emerged\nfrom under a blanket.  It chuckled damnably.  If there had been a\nrock of the right size within reach I would have thrown it, for\nit is not agreeable to be chuckled at when you are hungry,\nsleepy, and in a trap.  I know just how trapped animals feel.\n\nBut then it spoke in good plain English;  and you could not\nmistake the voice.\n\n\"That's what comes of suiting yourself, doesn't it!  Place\nplugged at both ends, and nowhere to go but there and back!\nThanks for tipping off Narayan Singh--you see, we were all ready.\nHere's a pass that'll let you out--catch!\"\n\nHe threw down a piece of white paper, folded.\n\n\"Show that to the Sikhs at either end.  Now beat it, while the\ngoing's good.  Leave Suliman there.  I shall want him when he has\nhad his sleep out.  Say:  hadn't you better change your   mind\nabout coming back too soon from that joy ride?  Haven't you had\nenough of this?  The next move's dangerous.\"\n\n\"Is it my choice?\" I asked.\n\n\"We owe you some consideration.\"\n\n\"Then I'm in on the last act.\"\n\n\"All right.  But don't blame me.  Turner will give you orders.\nGet a move on.\"\n\nI lowered Suliman's head gently from my knee on to a nice\ncomfortable corner of the stone gutter, and went up-street to\ninterview the Sikhs.  It was rather like a New York Customs\ninspection, after your cabin steward has not been heavily enough\ntipped, and has tipped off the men in blue by way of distributing\nthe discontent.  I showed them the safe-pass Grim had scribbled.\nThey accepted that as dubious preliminary evidence of my right to\nbe alive, but no more.  I was searched painstakingly and\nignominiously for weapons.  No questions asked.  Nothing taken\nfor granted.  Even my small change was examined in the moonlight,\ncoin by coin, to make sure, I suppose, that it wouldn't explode\nif struck on stone.  They gave everything back to me, including\nmy underwear.\n\nA bearded non-commissioned officer entered a description of me in\na pocket memorandum book.  If his face, as he wrote it, was\nanything to judge by he described me as a leper without a\nlicense.  Then I was cautioned gruffly in an unknown tongue and\ntold to \"imshi!\"  It isn't a bad plan to \"imshi\" rather quickly\nwhen a Sikh platoon suggests your doing it.  I left them standing\nall alone, with nothing but the empty night to bristle at.\n\nThe rest of that night, until half-an-hour before dawn was a\nhalf-waking dream of discomfort and chilly draughts in the mouth\nof the hotel arcade, where I sat and watched the spies, and they\nwatched me.  The third man was presumably still sleeping in the\nmosque, but it was satisfactory to know that the other two were\njust as cold and unhappy as I felt.\n\nAbout ten minutes before the car came the third man showed up\nsheepishly, looking surprised as well as relieved to find me\nsitting there.  He put in several minutes explaining matters to\nhis friends.  I don't doubt he lied like a horse-trader and gave\na detailed account of having followed me from place to place, for\nhe used a great deal of pantomimic gesture.  The other two were\ncynical with the air of men who must sit and listen to another\nblowing his own trumpet.\n\nThe car arrived with a fanfare of horn-blowing, the chauffeur\nevidently having had instructions to call lots of attention to\nhimself.  Turner came out at once, with the lower part of his\nface protected against the morning chill by a muffler.  Being\nabout the same height, and in that Syrian uniform, he looked\nremarkably like Grim, except that he did not imitate the stride\nnearly as well.\n\nHe stumbled over me, clutched my shoulder and made signs for the\nbenefit of the spies.  Then he whispered to me to help him carry\nout the \"money\" bags.  So we each took three for the first trip,\nand each contrived to drop one.  By the time all ten bags were in\nthe car there can hardly have remained any doubt in the\nconspirators' minds that we were really taking funds to Mustapha\nKemal, or at any rate to somebody up north.\n\nBut Davey was no half-way concession maker.  Having lent himself\nunwillingly to the trick, he did his utmost to make it succeed,\nlike a good sport.  He stuck his head out of a bedroom window.\n\n\"Don't forget, now, to send me those rugs from Damascus!\"\nhe shouted.\n\nIt all went like clockwork.  Glancing back as we drove by the\nJaffa Gate I saw the three spies walk away, and there is very\noften more information in men's backs than in their faces.  They\nwalked like laborers returning home with a day's work behind\nthem, finished;  not at all like men in doubt, nor as if they\nsuspected they were followed, although in fact they were.  Three\nSikhs emerged from the corner by the Gate and strolled along\nbehind them.  Detailed preparations for the round-up had begun.\nThe unostentatious mechanism of it seemed more weird and terrible\nthan the conspiracy itself.\n\nThere was a full company of Sikhs standing to arms in a side\nstreet leading off the Jaffa Road, but they took no notice of us.\nTheir officer looked keenly at us once, and then very\ndeliberately stared the other way, illustrating how some fighting\nmen make pretty poor dissemblers;  every one of his dark-skinned\nrank and file had observed all the details of our outfit without\nseeming to see us at all.\n\n\"We're using nothing but Sikhs on this job,\" said Turner.\n\"British troops wouldn't appreciate the delicacy of the\nsituation.  Moslems couldn't be trusted not to talk.  The Sikhs\nenjoy the surreptitious part of it, and don't care enough about\nthe politics to get excited.  Wish I might be in at the finish,\nthough!  Have you any notion what the real objective is?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, and tried not to feel, or look pleased with myself.\nBut no mere amateur can conceal that, in the moment of discovery,\nhe knows more about the inside of an official business than one\nof the Administration's lawful agents.  That is nine-tenths of\nthe secret of \"bossed\" politics--the sheer vanity of being on the\ninside, \"in the know.\"  I suppose I smirked.   \"Damn this ride\nto Haifa!  What the hell have you done, I wonder, that you should\nhave a front pew?  Is the Intelligence short of officers?\"\n\nI had done nothing beyond making Grim's acquaintance and by good\nluck tickling his flair for odd friendship.  I thought it better\nnot to say that, so I went on lying.\n\n\"I don't suppose I know any more than you do.\"\n\n\"Rot!  I posted the men who watched you into Djemal's place\nyesterday, and watched you out again.  You acted pretty poorly,\nif you ask me.  It's a marvel we didn't have to go in there and\nrescue you.  I suppose you're another of Grim's favorites.  He\npicks some funny ones.  Half the men in jail seem to be friends\nof his.\"\n\nI decided to change the subject.\n\n\"I was told to change clothes and walk back after a mile or so,\"\nI said.  \"Suppose we don't make it a Marathon.  Why walk farther\nthan we need to?\"\n\n\"Uh!\"\n\nI think he was feeling sore enough to take me ten miles for the\nsatisfaction of making me tramp them back to Jerusalem.  But it\nturned out not to be his day for working off grievances.  We were\nbowling along pretty fast, and had just reached open country\nwhere it would be a simple matter to change into other clothes\nwithout risk of being seen doing it, when we began to be\noverhauled by another, larger car that came along at a terrific\npace.  It was still too dark to make out who was in it until it\ndrew almost abreast.\n\n\"The Administrator by the Horn Spoon!  What next, I wonder!  Pull\nup!\" said Turner.  \"Morning, sir.\"\n\nThe two cars came to a standstill.  The Administrator leaned out.\n\n\"I think I can save you a walk,\" he said, smiling.  \"How about\nchanging your clothes between the cars and driving back with me?\"\n\nI did not even know yet what new disguise I was to assume, but\nTurner opened a hand-bag and produced a suit of my own clothes\nand a soft hat.\n\n\"Burgled your bedroom,\" he explained.\n\nAll he had forgotten was suspenders.  No doubt it would have\ngiven him immense joy to think of me walking back ten miles\nwithout them.\n\nSir Louis gave his orders while I changed clothes.\n\n\"You'd better keep going for some time, Turner.  No need to go\nall the way to Haifa, but don't get back to Jerusalem before\nnoon at the earliest, and be sure you don't talk to anybody on\nyour way.\"\n\nTurner drove on.  I got in beside the Administrator.\n\n\"Grim tells me that you don't object to a certain amount of risk.\nYou've been very useful, and he thinks you would like to see the\nend of the business.  I wouldn't think of agreeing to it, only we\nshall have to call on you as a witness against Scharnhoff and\nNoureddin Ali.  As you seem able to keep still about what you\nknow, it seems wiser not to change witnesses at this stage.  It\nis highly important that we should have one unofficial observer,\nwho is neither Jew nor Moslem, and who has no private interest to\nserve.  But I warn you, what is likely to happen this morning\nwill be risky.\"\n\nI looked at the scar on his cheek, and the campaign ribbons, and\nthe attitude of absolute poise that can only be attained by years\nof familiarity with danger.\n\n\"Why do you soldiers always act like nursemaids toward\ncivilians?\" I asked him.  \"We're bone of your bone.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Entrenched privilege!  If we let you know too much you'd think\ntoo little of us!\"\n\nWe stopped at a Jew's store outside the city for suspenders, and\nthen made the circuit outside the walls in a whirlwind of dust,\nstopping only at each gate to get reports from the officers\ncommanding companies drawn up in readiness to march in and police\nthe city.\n\n\"It's all over the place that disaster of some sort is going to\nhappen today,\" said Sir Louis.  \"It only needs a hatful of\nrumours to set Jerusalemites at one another's throats.  But we're\nready for them.  The first to start trouble this morning will be\nthe first to get it.  Now--sorry you've no time for breakfast--\nhere's the Jaffa Gate.  Will you walk through the city to that\nstreet where Grim talked with you from a roof last night?  You'll\nfind him thereabouts.  Sure you know the way?  Good-bye.  Good\nluck!  No, you won't need a pass;  there'll be nobody to\ninterfere with you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nineteen\n\n\"Dead or alive, sahib.\"\n\n\nI did get breakfast nevertheless, but in a strange place.  The\ncity shutters were coming down only under protest, because, just\nas in Boston and other hubs of sanctity, shop-looting starts less\nthan five minutes after the police let go control.  There was an\naverage, that morning, of about ten rumours to the ear.  So the\nshop-keepers had to be ordered to open up.  About the mildest\nrumour was that the British had decide to vacate and to leave the\nZionists in charge of things.  You couldn't fool an experienced\nJew as to what would happen in that event.  There was another\nrumour that Mustapha Kemal was on the march.  Another that an\nArab army was invading from the direction of El-Kerak.  But there\nwere British officers walking about with memorandum books, and a\nfifty-pound fine looked more serious than an outbreak that had\nnot occurred yet.  So they were putting down their shutters.\n\nI had nearly reached the Haram-es-Sheriff, and was passing a\nplatoon of Sikhs who dozed beside their rifles near a street\ncorner, when Grim's voice hailed me through the half-open door\nbehind them.  He was back in his favourite disguise as a Bedouin,\nsquatting on a mat near the entrance of a vaulted room, where he\ncould see through the door without being seen.\n\n\"This is headquarters for the present,\" he explained.  \"Soon as\nwe bag the game we'll run 'em in here quick as lightning.  Most\nlikely keep 'em here all day, so's not to have to parade 'em\nthrough the streets until after dark.  A man's coming soon with\ncoffee and stuff to eat.\"\n\n\"What's become of Suliman?\"\n\n\"He's shooting craps with two other young villains close to\nwhere you left him last night.  I'm hoping he'll get word with\nhis mother.\"\n\nGrim looked more nervous than I had ever seen him.  There was a\ndeep frown between his eyes.  He talked as if he were doing it to\nkeep himself from worrying.\n\n\"What's eating you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Noureddin Ali.  After all this trouble to bag the whole gang\nwithout any fuss there's a chance he's given us the slip.  I\nwatched all night to make sure he didn't come out of that door.\nHe didn't.  But I've no proof he's in there.  Scharnhoff's in\nthere, and five of the chief conspirators.  Noureddin Ali may be.\nBut a man brought me a story an hour ago about seeing him on the\ncity wall.  However, here's the food.  So let's eat.\"\n\nHe sat and munched gloomily, until presently Goodenough joined\nus, looking, what with that monocle and one thing and another, as\nif he had just stepped out of a band-box.\n\n\"Well, Grim, the net's all ready.  If that TNT is where you say\nit is, in that big barn behind the fruit-stalls near the Jaffa\nGate, it's ours the minute they make a move.\"\n\n\"There isn't a doubt on that point,\" Grim answered.  \"Why else\nshould Scharnhoff open a fruit-shop?  The license for it was\ntaken out by one of Noureddin Ali's agents, whose brother deals\nin fruit wholesale and owns that barn.  Narayan Singh tracked\nsome suspicious packages to that place four days ago.  They'll\nstart to carry it into the city hidden under loads of fruit just\nas soon as the morning crowd begins to pour in.  We only need let\nthem get the first consignment in, so as to have the chain of\nevidence complete.  Are you sure your men will let the first lot\ngo through?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.  Just came from giving them very careful\ninstructions. The minute that first load disappears into the city\nthey'll close in on the barn and arrest every one they find in\nthere.  But what are you gloomy about?\"\n\n\"I'd hate to miss the big fish.\"\n\n\"You mean Noureddin Ali ?\"\n\n\"It looks to me as if he's been a shade too wise for us.  One man\nswore he saw him on the wall this morning, but he was gone when I\nsent to make sure.  We've got all the rest.  There are five in\nDjemal's Cafe, waiting for the big news;  they'll be handcuffed\none at a time by the police when they get tired of waiting and\ncome out.\n\n\"But I'd rather bag Noureddin Ali than all the others put\ntogether.  He's got brains, that little beast has.  He'd know how\nto use this story against us with almost as much effect as if\nhe'd pulled the outrage off.\"\n\nHe had hardly finished speaking when Narayan Singh's great bulk\ndarkened the doorway.  He closed the door behind him, as if\nafraid the other Sikhs might learn bad news.\n\n\"It is true, sahib.  He was on the wall.  He is there again.\"\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Surely.  He makes signals to the men who are loading the donkeys\nnow in the door of the barn.  It would be a difficult shot.  His\nhead hardly shows between the battlements.  But I think I could\nhit him from the road below.  Shall I try?\"\n\n\"No, you'd only scare him into hiding if you miss.  Oh hell!\nThere are three ways up on to the wall at that point.  There's no\ntime to block them all--not if he's signalling now.  He'll see\nyour men close in on the barn, sir, and beat it for the skyline.\nOh, damn and blast the luck!\"\n\n\"At least we can try to cut him off,\" said Goodenough.  \"I'll\ntake some men myself and have a crack at it.\"\n\n\"No use, sir.  You'd never catch sight of him.  I wish you'd let\nNarayan Singh take three men, make for the wall by the shortest\nway, and hunt him if it takes a week.\"\n\n\"Why not?  All right.  D'you hear that, Narayan Singh?\"\n\n\"Atcha, sahib.\"\n\n\"You understand?\" said Grim.  \"Keep him moving.  Keep after him.\"\n\n\"Do the sahibs wish him alive or dead?\"\n\n\"Either way,\" said Goodenough.\n\n\"If he's gone from the wall when you get there,\" Grim added,\n\"bring us the news.  You'll know where to find us\"\n\n\"Atcha\"\n\nThe Sikh brought his rifle to the shoulder, faced about,\nmarched out, chose three men from the platoon in the street,\nand vanished.\n\n\"Too bad, too bad!\" said Goodenough, but Grim did not answer.  He\nwas swearing a blue streak under his breath.  The next to arrive\non the scene was Suliman, grinning with delight because he had\nwon all the money of the other urchins, but brimming with news in\nthe bargain.  He considered a mere colonel of cavalry beneath\nnotice, and addressed himself to Grim without ceremony.\n\n\"My mother brought out oranges in baskets and set them on benches\non both sides of the door.  Then she went in, and I heard her\nscream.  There was a fight inside.\"\n\n\"D'you care to bet, sir?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a hundred piastres Scharnhoff has tried to make his\nget-away, and they've either killed him or tied him hand and\nfoot.  Another hundred on top of that, that Scharnhoff offers to\nturn state witness, provided he's alive when we show up.\"\n\n\"All right.  I'll bet you he hangs.\"\n\n\"Are you coming with us, sir?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it for a king's ransom.\"\n\n\"The back way out, then.\"\n\nGrim beckoned the Sikhs into the room, left one man in there in\ncharge of Suliman, who swore blasphemously at being left behind,\nand led the way down a passage that opened into an alley\nconnecting with a maze of others like rat runs, mostly arched\nover and all smelly with the unwashed gloom of ages.  At the end\nof the last alley we entered was a flight of stone steps, up\nwhich we climbed to the roof of the house on which I had seen\nGrim the night before.\n\nThere was a low coping on the side next the street, and some one\nhad laid a lot of bundles of odds and ends against it;  lying\ndown, we could look out between those without any risk of being\nseen from below, but Goodenough made the Sikhs keep well in the\nbackground and only we three peered over the edge.  About two\nhundred yards in front of us the Dome of the Rock glistened in\nthe morning sun above the intervening roofs.  The street was\nalmost deserted, although the guards at either end had been\nremoved for fear of scaring away the conspirators.  We watched\nfor about twenty minutes before any one passed but occasional\nbeggars, some of whom stopped to wonder why oranges should stand\non sale outside a door with nobody in charge of them.  Three\nseparate individuals glanced right and left and then helped\nthemselves pretty liberally from the baskets.\n\nBut at last there came five donkeys very heavily loaded with\noranges and raisins, in charge of six men, which was a more than\nliberal allowance.  When they stopped at the little stone house\nin front of us there was another thing noticeable;  instead of\nhitting the donkeys hard on the nose with a thick club, which is\nthe usual way of calling a halt in Palestine, they went to the\nheads and stopped them reasonably gently.  So, although all six\nmen were dressed to resemble peasants, they were certainly\nnothing of the kind.\n\nNor were they such wide-awake conspirators as they believed\nthemselves, for they were not in the least suspicious of six\nother men, also dressed as peasants, who followed them up-street,\nand sat down in full view with their backs against a wall.  Yet I\ncould see quite plainly the scabbard of a bayonet projecting\nthrough a hole in the ragged cloak of the nearest of those\ncasual wayfarers.\n\nThey had to knock several minutes before the door opened\ngingerly;  then they off-loaded the donkeys, and it took two men\nto carry each basketful, with a third lending a hand in case of\naccident.  Only one man went back with the donkeys, and two of\nthe casual loafers against the wall got up to saunter after him;\nthe other five honest merchants went inside, and we heard the\nbolt shoot into its iron slot behind them.\n\n\"How about it, Grim?\" asked Goodenough then.\n\n\"Ready, sir.  Will you give the order?\"\n\nWe filed in a hurry down the steps into the alley, ran in a zig-\nzag down three passages, and reached another alley with narrow\ndoor at its end that faced the street.  Grim had made every\npreparation.  There was a heavy baulk of timber lying near the\ndoor, with rope-handles knotted into holes bored through it at\nintervals.  The Sikhs picked that up and followed us into\nthe street.\n\nThe mechanism of the Administration's net was a thing to wonder\nat.  As we emerged through the door the \"peasants\" who were\nloafing with their backs against the wall got up and formed a\ncordon across the street.  Simultaneously, although I neither saw\nnor heard any signal, a dozen Sikhs under a British officer came\ndown the street from the other direction at the double and formed\nup in line on our lefthand.  A moment later, our men were\nbattering the door down with their baulk of timber, working all\ntogether as if they had practised the stunt thoroughly.\n\nIt was a stout door, three inches thick, of ancient olivewood and\nreinforced with forged iron bands.  The hinges, too, had been\nmade by hand in the days when, if a man's house was not his\nfortress, he might just as well own nothing;  they were cemented\ndeep into the wall, and fastened to the door itself with half-\ninch iron rivets.  The door had to be smashed to pieces, and the\nnoise we made would have warned the devils in the middle of\nthe world.\n\n\"We shouldn't have let them get in with any TNT at all,\" said\nGoodenough.  \"They'll touch it off before we can prevent them.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!  They're not that kind,\" Grim answered.  \"They'll fight\nfor their skins.  Have your gun ready, sir.  They've laid their\nplans for a time-fuse and a quick getaway.  They'll figure the\ngoing may be good still if they can once get past us.  Look out\nfor a rush!\"\n\nBut when the door went down at last in a mess of splinters\nthere was no rush--nothing but silence--a dark, square, stone\nroom containing two cots and a table, and fruit scattered all\nover the floor amid gray dust and fragments of cement.  Grim\nlaughed curtly.\n\n\"Look, sir!\"\n\nThe fruit-baskets were on the floor by one of the cots, and the\nTNT containers were still in them.  They had tipped out the\nfruit, and then run at the sound of the battering ram.\n\nGoodenough stepped into the room, and we followed him.  Beyond\nthe table, half-hidden by a great stone slab, was a dark hole in\nthe floor.  Evidently the last man through had tried to cover up\nthe hole, but had found the stone too heavy.  The Sikhs dragged\nit clear and disclosed the mouth of a tunnel, rather less than a\nman's height, sloping sharply downward.\n\n\"What we need now is mustard gas.  Smoke 'em out,\"\nsaid Goodenough.\n\n\"Might kill 'em,\" Grim objected.\n\n\"That'd be too bad, wouldn't it!\"\n\n\"We could starve 'em out, for that matter,\" said Grim.  \"But\nthey've probably got water down there, and perhaps food.  Every\nhour of delay adds to the risk of rioting.  We've got to get this\nhole sealed up permanently, and deny that it was ever opened.\"\n\n\"We could do that at once!  But I won't be a party to sealing 'em\nup alive.\"\n\n\"Besides, sir, they've certainly got firearms, and they might\njust possible have one can of TNT down there.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Goodenough.  \"I'll lead the way down.\"\n\n\"I've a plan,\" said Grim.\n\nHe took one of the fruit-baskets and began breaking it up.\n\n\"Who has a white shirt?\" he asked.\n\nI was the haberdasher.  The others, Sikhs included, were all\nclothed in khaki from coat to skin.  Grim's Bedouin array was\ndark-brown.  I peeled the shirt off, and Grim rigged it on a\nframe of basket-work, with a clumsy pitch-forked arrangement of\nwithes at the bottom.  The idea was not obvious until he twisted\nthe withes about his waist;  then, when he bent down, the shirt\nstood up erect above him.\n\n\"If you don't mind, sir, we'll have two or three Sikhs go first.\nHave them take their boots off and crawl quietly as flat down as\nthey can keep.  I'll follow 'em with this contraption.  They'll\nbe able to see the white shirt dimly against the tunnel, and if\nthey do any shooting they'll aim at that.  Then if the rest of\nyou keep low behind me we've a good chance to rush them before\nthey can do any damage.\"\n\nI never met a commanding officer more free from personal conceit\nthan Goodenough, and as I came to know more of him later on that\ncharacteristic stood out increasingly.  He was not so much a man\nof ideas as one who could recognize them.  That done, he made use\nof his authority to back up his subordinates, claiming no credit\nfor himself but always seeing to it that they got theirs.\n\nThe result was that he was simultaneously despised and loved--\ndespised by the self-advertising school, of which there are\nplenty in every army, and loved--with something like fanaticism\nby his junior officers and men.\n\n\"I agree to that,\" he said simply, screwing in his monocle.  Then\nhe turned and instructed the Sikhs in their own language.\n\n\"You follow last,\" he said to me.  \"Now--all ready?\"\n\nHe had a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other, but\nhad to stow them both away again in order to crawl in the tunnel.\nGrim had no weapon in sight.  The two Sikhs who were to lead had\nstripped themselves of everything that might make a noise, but\nthe others kept both boots and rifles, with bayonets fixed, for\nit did not much matter what racket they made.  In fact, the more\nnoise we, who followed, made, the better, since that would draw\nattention from the Sikhs in front.  All we had to do was to keep\nour bodies below Grim's kite affair, out of the probable line\nof fire.\n\nNevertheless, that dark hole was untempting.  A dank smell came\nout of it, like the breath of those old Egyptian tombs in which\nthe bones of horses, buried with their masters, lie all about on\nshelves.  You couldn't see into it more than a yard or two, for\nthe only light came through the doorway of the windowless room,\nand the tunnel led into the womb of rock where, perhaps, no light\nhad been since Solomon's day.\n\nBut the leading Sikhs went in without hesitation and got down on\ntheir bellies.  They might have been swallowed whole for all that\nI heard or saw of them from that minute.  You could guess why the\nTurks and Germans had not really craved to meet those fellows out\nin No-man's-land.\n\nGrim went in on all-fours like a weird animal, with my shirt\ndancing on its frame above his back.  Goodenough went next,\npeering through that window-pane monocle like a deep-sea fish.\nAll the rest of the Sikhs went after him in Indian file, dragging\ntheir rifle-butts along the tunnel floor and making noise enough\nto remind you of the New York subway.\n\nI went in at the tail end, trying at intervals to peer around a\nkhaki-covered Punjaub rump, alternately getting my head and\nfingers bruised by heels I could not see and a rifle-butt that\nonly moved in jerks when you didn't expect it to.  My nose was\nbleeding at the end of ten yards.\n\nBut you couldn't keep your distance.  Whenever the men in front\nchecked at some obstruction or paused to listen, all those behind\nclosed up;  and by the time those behind had run their noses\nagainst iron-shod heels the men in front were on their way again.\nYou couldn't see a thing until you rammed your head into it, and\nthen the sense of touch gave you a sort of sight suggestion, as\nwhen you see things in a dream.  As for sound, the tunnel acted\nlike a whispering gallery, mixing all the noises up together, so\nthat you could not guess whether a man had spoken, or a stone had\nfallen, or a pistol had gone off, or all three.\n\nOnce or twice, when the line closed up on itself caterpillar-\nfashion, I was able to make out my white shirt dancing dimly;\nand once, where some trick of the tunnel sorted out the sounds, I\ncaught a scrap of conversation.\n\n\"D'you suppose they'll be able to see the shirt?\"\n\n\"God knows.  I can hardly make it out from here.\"\n\n\"When it looks like the right time to you, sir, turn the\nflashlight on it.\"\n\n\"All right.  God damn! Keep on going--you nearly knocked out\nmy eye-glass!\"\n\nEven over my shoulder, looking backward, I could see practically\nnothing, for what little light came in through the opening was\nswallowed by the first few yards.  There was a suspicion of\npaleness in the gloom behind, and the occasional suggestion of an\noutline of rough wall;  no more.\n\nNor was the tunnel straight by any means.  It turned and twisted\nconstantly;  and at every bend the men who originally closed it\nhad built up a wall of heavy masonry that Scharnhoff had had to\nforce his way through.  In those places the broken stones were\nnow lying in the fairway, as you knew by the suffering when you\ncame in contact with them;  some of the split-off edges were as\nsharp as glass.\n\nIt was good fun, all the same, while it lasted.  If we had been\ncrawling down a sewer, or a modern passage of any kind, the sense\nof danger and discomfort would, no doubt, have overwhelmed all\nother considerations.  But, even supposing Scharnhoff had been on\na vain hunt, and the veritable Tomb of the Kings of Judah did not\nlie somewhere in the dark ahead of us, we were nevertheless under\nthe foundations of Solomon's temple, groping our way into\nmysteries that had not been disclosed, perhaps, since the days\nwhen the Queen of Sheba came and paid her homage to the most\nwise king.  You could feel afraid, but you couldn't wish you\nweren't there.\n\nI have no idea how long it took to crawl the length of that black\npassage.  It seemed like hours.  I heard heavy footsteps behind\nme after a while.  Some one following in a hurry, who could see\nno better than we could, kept stumbling over the falling masonry;\nand once, when he fell headlong, I heard him swear titanically in\na foreign tongue.  I called back to whoever it was to crawl\nunless he wanted to be shot, but probably the words were all\nmixed up in the tunnel echoes, for he came on as before.\n\nThen all at once Goodenough flashed on the light for a fraction\nof a second and the shirt showed like a phantom out of blackness.\nThe instant answer to that was a regular volley of shots from in\nfront.  The flash of several pistols lit up the tunnel, and\nbullets rattled off the walls and roof.  The shirt fell, shot\nloose from its moorings, and the leading Sikhs gave a shout as\nthey started to rush forward.\n\nWe all surged after them, but there was a sudden check, followed\nby a babel worse than when a dozen pi-dogs fight over a rubbish-\nheap.  You couldn't make head or tail of it, except that\nsomething desperate was happening in front, until suddenly a man\nwith a knife in his hand, too wild with fear to use it, came\nleaping and scrambling over the backs of Sikhs, like a forward\nbucking the line.  The Sikh in front of me knelt upright and\ncollared him round the knees.  The two went down together, I on\ntop of both of them with blood running down my arm, for the man\nhad started to use his knife at last, slashing out at random, and\nI rather think that slight cut he gave me saved the Sikh's life.\nBut you can make any kind of calculation afterwards, about what\ntook place in absolute darkness, without the least fear of being\nproven wrong.  And since the Sikh and I agreed on that point no\nother opinion matters.\n\nI think that between the two of us we had that man about\nnonplused, although we couldn't see.  I had his knife, and the\nSikh was kneeling on his stomach, when a hundred and eighty\npounds of bone and muscle catapulted at us from the rear and\nsprawled on us headlong, saved by only a miracle from skewering\nsome one with a bayonet as he fell.\n\nHe laughed while he fought, this newcomer, and even asked\nquestions in the Sikh tongue.  He had my arm in a grip like a\nvise and wrenched at it until I cursed him.  Then he found a leg\nin the dark and nearly broke that, only to discover it was the\nother Sikh's.  Still laughing, as if blindfolded fighting was his\nmeat and drink, he reached again, and this time his fingers\nclosed on enemy flesh.  Judging by the yells, they hurt, too.\n\nThere must have been at least another minute of cat-and-dog-fight\nstruggling--hands being stepped on and throats clutched--before\nGoodenough rolled himself free from an antagonist in front and,\ngroping for the flashlight, found it and flashed it on.  The\nfirst thing I recognized by its light was the face of Narayan\nSingh, with wonderful white teeth grinning through his black\nbeard within six inches of my nose.\n\n\"Damn you!\" I laughed.  \"You weigh a ton.  Get off--you nearly\nkilled me!\"\n\n\"Nearly, in war-time, means a whole new life to lose, sahib.  Be\npleased to make the most of it!\" he answered.\n\nWithin two minutes after that we had eight prisoners disarmed and\nsubdued, some of them rather the worse for battery.  The amazing\nthing was that we hadn't a serious casualty among the lot of us.\nWe could have totaled a square yard of skin, no doubt, and a\nbushel of bruises (if that is the way you measure them) but mine\nwas the only knife-wound.  I felt beastly proud.\n\nBy the light of the electric torch we dragged and prodded the\nprisoners back whence they had come, and presently Grim or\nsomebody found a lantern and lit it.  We found ourselves in a\nsquare cavern--a perfect cube it looked like--about thirty feet\nwide each way.\n\nIn the midst was a plain stone coffer with its lid removed and\nset on end against it.  In the coffer lay a tall man's skeleton,\nwith the chin still bound in linen browned with age.  There were\nother fragments of linen here and there, but the skeleton's bones\nhad been disturbed and had fallen more or less apart.\n\nOver in one corner were two large bundles done up in modern gunny-\nbags, and Grim went over to examine them.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said.  \"Here's Scharnhoff and his lady friend!\"\n\nHe ripped the lashings of both bundles and disclosed the Austrian\nand the woman, gagged and tied, both almost unconscious from\ninability to breathe, but not much hurt otherwise.\n\nThe Sikhs herded the prisoners, old alligator-eyes among them,\ninto another corner.  Grim tore my shirt into strips to bandage\nmy arm with.  Goodenough talked with Narayan Singh, while we\nwaited for Scharnhoff to recover full consciousness.\n\n\"Those murderers!\" he gasped at last.  \"Schweinehunde!\"\n\n\"Better spill the beans, old boy,\" Grim said, smiling down at\nhim.  \"You'll hang at the same time they do, if you can't tell a\nstraight story.\"\n\n\"Ach!  I do not care!  There were no manuscripts--nothing!  I\ndon't know whose skeleton that is--some old king David, perhaps;\nfor that is not David's real tomb that the guides show.  Hang\nthose murderers and I am satisfied!\"\n\n\"Your story may help hang them.  Come on, out with it!\"\n\n\"Have you caught Noureddin Ali?\"\n\n\"Never mind!\"\n\n\"But I do mind!  And you should mind!\"\n\nScharnhoff sat up excitedly.  He was dressed in the Arab garments\nI had seen in his cupboard that day when Grim and I called on\nhim, with a scholar's turban that made him look very distinguished\nin spite of his disarray.\n\n\"That Noureddin Ali is a devil!  Together we would look for the\nTomb of the Kings.  Together we would smuggle out the manuscripts\n--translate them together--publish the result together.  He lent\nme money.  He promised to bring explosives.  Oh, he was full of\nenthusiasm!  It was not until last night, when I had broken that\nlast obstruction down and discovered nothing but this coffin,\nthat I learned his real plan.  The devil intended all along to\nfill this tomb with high explosive and to destroy the mosque above,\nwith everybody in it!  Curse him!\"\n\n\"Never mind cursing him,\" said Grim, \"tell us the story.\"\n\n\"He sent oranges here, all marked with the labels of a Zionist\ncolony.  When I told him that the explosive would arrive too\nlate, he said I should use it to smash these walls and find\nanother tomb.  He himself disappeared, and when I questioned\nhis men they told me the explosive would be brought in hidden\nunder fruit in baskets.  I waited then in the hope of killing\nhim myself--\"\n\n\"Hah-hah!\" laughed Grim.\n\n\"That is true!  But they bound me, and later on bound the woman,\nand laid us here to be blown up together with the mosque.\"\n\nGrim turned to Goodenough, who had been listening.\n\n\"Do I win the bet, sir?\"\n\n\"Ten piastoes!\" said Goodenough.  \"Yes. Narayan Singh says\nNoureddin Ali was gone by the time they reached the wall.\"\n\n\"Sure, or he'd have brought Noureddin Ali.  I've been thinking,\nsir.  We've one chance left to bag that buzzard.  Will you give\nme carte blanche?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Go ahead.\"\n\nGrim crossed the place to the corner where old alligator-eyes\nstood herded with the other prisoners.\n\n\"Are you guilty?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No.  Guilty of nothing.  I came out of curiosity to see what was\nhappening here.\"\n\n\"Thought so.  Can you hold your tongue?  Then go!  Get out\nof here!\"\n\nAlligator-eyes didn't wait for a second urging, nor stay to\nquestion his good luck, but went off in a shambling hurry.\n\n\"You are mad!\" exclaimed Scharnhoff.  \"That man is the next-worst!\"\n\n\"Grim, are you sure that's wise?\" asked Goodenough.\n\n\"We can get him any time we want him, sir,\" Grim answered.  \"He\nlacks Noureddin Ali's gift of slipperiness.\"\n\nHe turned to Narayan Singh.\n\n\"Follow that man, but don't let him know he's followed.  He'll\nshow you where Noureddin Ali is.  Get him this time!\"\n\n\"Dead or alive, sahib?\"\n\n\"Either.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty\n\n\"All men are equal in the dark.\"\n\n\nThe first thing Goodenough did after Grim had sent Narayan Singh\noff on his deadly mission was to summon the sheikh of the Dome of\nthe Rock.  He himself went to fetch him rather than risk having\nthe sheikh bring a crowd of witnesses, who would be sure to talk\nafterwards.  The all-important thing was to conceal the fact that\nsacrilege had been committed.  But it was also necessary to\nestablish the fact that Zionists had had no hand in it.\n\n\"You see,\" Grim explained, sitting on the edge of the stone\ncoffin, \"we could hold Jerusalem.  But if word of this business\nwere to spread far and wide, you couldn't hold two or three\nhundred million fanatics;  and believe me, they'd cut loose!\"\n\n\"The sheikh must realize that,\" said I.  \"What do you bet me\nhe won't try to black-mail the Administration on the strength\nof it?\"\n\n\"I'll bet you my job!  Watch the old bird.  Listen in.  He's\ndowny.  He knows a chance when he sees it, and he might try\nto cheat you at dominoes.  But in a big crisis he's a number\none man.\"\n\nWhile we waited we tried to get an opinion out of Scharnhoff\nabout the coffin and the skeleton inside it.  But the old fellow\nwas heart-broken.  I think he told the truth when he said he\ncouldn't explain it.\n\n\"What is there to say of it, except that it is very ancient?\nThere is no decoration.  The coffin is beautifully shaped out of\none solid piece of stone, but that is all.  The skeleton is that\nof an old man, who seems to have been wounded once or twice in\nbattle.  The linen is good, but there is no jewelry;  no\nornaments.  And it is buried here in a very sacred place, so\nprobably, it is one of the Jewish kings, or else one of the\nprophets.  It might be King David--who knows?  And what do I\ncare?  It is what a man sets down on parchment, and not his bones\nthat interest me!\"\n\nThe sheikh arrived at last, following Goodenough down the dark\npassage with the supreme nonchalance of the priest too long\nfamiliar with sacred places to be thrilled or frightened by them.\nHe stood in the entrance gazing about him, blinking speculatively\nthrough the folds of fat surrounding his bright eyes.  Goodenough\ntook the lantern and held it close to the prisoners' faces one\nby one.\n\n\"You see?\" he said.  \"All Syrians.  All Moslems.  Not a Jew among\nthem.  I'll take you and show you the others presently.\"\n\n\"What will you do with them?\"\n\n\"That's for a court to decide.  Hang them, most likely.  They\nwere plotting murder.\"\n\n\"They will talk at the trial.\"\n\n\"Behind closed doors!\" said Goodenough.\n\n\"Ahum!\" said the sheikh, stroking his beard.  It would not\nhave been compatible with either his religion or his racial\nconsciousness not to try to make the utmost of the situation.\n\"This would be a bad thing for all the Christian governments if\nthe tale leaked out.  Religious places have been desecrated.\nThere would be inflammation of Moslem prejudices everywhere.\"\n\n\"It would be worse for you!\" Grim retorted.  The sheikh stared\nhard at him, stroking his beard again,\n\n\"How so, Jimgrim?  Have I had a hand in this?\"\n\n\"This is your famous Bir-el-Arwah, where, as you tell your\nfaithful, the souls of the dead come to pray twice a week.  This\nis the gulf beneath the Rock of Abraham that you tell them\nreaches to the middle of the world.  Look at it!  Shall we\npublish flashlight photographs?\"\n\nThe sheikh's eyes twinkled as he recognized the force of that\nargument.  He turned it over in his mind for a full minute before\nhe answered.\n\n\"You cannot be expected to understand spiritual things,\" he said\nat last.  \"However,\" looking up, \"this is not under the Rock.\nThis is another place.\"\n\nGoodenough pulled a compass from his pocket, but Grim shook\nhis head.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Grim. \"What of it?\"\n\n\"It is better to close up this place and say nothing.\"\n\n\"Except this.\" Goodenough retorted:  \"you will say at the first\nand every succeeding opportunity that you know it is not true\nthat Zionists tried to blow up the Dome of the Rock.\"\n\n\"How do I know they did not try?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we'd better ask the Administrator to come and inspect\nthis place officially and put the exact facts on the record,\"\nGoodenough retorted.\n\n\"You understand, don't you?\" said Grim.\n\n\"Everything we've done until now has been strictly unofficial.\nThere's a difference.\"\n\n\"And this effendi?\" he asked, staring at me.  \"What of him?\"\n\n\"He is commended to your special benevolence,\" Grim answered.\n\"The way to keep a man like him discreet is to make a friend of\nhim.  Treat him as you do me, then we three shall be friends.\"\n\nThe sheikh nodded, and that proved to be the beginning of a\nrather intimate acquaintance with him that stood me in good stead\nmore than once afterwards.  The influence that a man in his\nposition can exert, if he cares to, is almost beyond the belief\nof those who pin their faith to money and mere officialdom.\n\nThe prisoners were marched out.  All except Scharnhoff and the\nwoman were confirmed temporarily in the room in which Grim and I\nhad breakfasted.  The woman was taken to the jail until an\nAmerican missionary could be found to take charge of her.  They\nalways hand the awkward cases over to Americans, partly because\nthey have a gift for that sort of thing, but also because, in\ncase of need, you can blame Americans without much risk of\na reaction.\n\nGoodenough left a guard of Sikhs outside the street entrance, to\nkeep out all intruders until the sheikh could collect a few\ntrustworthy masons to seal up the passage again.  Grim,\nScharnhoff and I walked quite leisurely to Grim's quarters, where\nGrim left the two of us together in the room downstairs while he\nchanged into uniform.\n\n\"What will they do with me?\" asked Scharnhoff.  He was not far\nfrom collapse.  He lay back in the armchair with his mouth open.\nI got him some of Grim's whiskey.\n\n\"Nothing ungenerous,\" I said.  \"If you were going to be hanged\nGrim would have told you.\"\n\n\"Do you--do you think he will let me go?\"\n\n\"Not until he's through with you,\" said I, \"if I'm any judge\nof him.\"\n\n\"What use can I be to him?  My life is not worth a minute's\npurchase if Noureddin Ali finds me--he or that other whom they\nlet go.  Oh, what idiots to let Noureddin Ali give them the slip,\nand then to turn the second-worst one loose as well!  Those\nEnglish are all mad.  That man Grim has been corrupted by them!\"\n\nGrim hardly looked corrupted, rather iron-hard and energetic when\nhe returned presently in his major's uniform.  You could tell the\ncolor of his eyes now;  they were blue-gray, and there was a\nlight in them that should warn the wary not to oppose him unless\na real fight was wanted.  His manner was brisk, brusk, striding\nover trifles.  He nodded to me.\n\n\"You sick of this?\" he asked me.\n\n\"How many times?  I want to see it through.\"\n\n\"All right.  Your own risk.\"\n\nHe turned on Scharnhoff, standing straight in front of him, with\nboth arms behind his back.\n\n\"Look here.  Have you any decency in that body of yours?  Do you\nwant to prove it?  Or would you rather hang like a common\nscoundrel?  Which is it to be?\"\n\n\"I--I--I--I--do not understand you.  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Are you game to risk your neck decently or would you rather have\nthe hangman put you out of pain?\"\n\n\"I--I was not a conspirator, Major Grim.  If I had known what\nthey intended I would never have lent myself to such a purpose.\nI needed money for my excavations--it has been very difficult to\ndraw on my bank in Vienna.  Noureddin Ali represented himself to\nme as an enthusiastic antiquarian;  and when I spoke of my need\nhe offered money, as I told you already.  I never suspected until\nlast night that he and Abdul Ali of Damascus are French secret\nagents.  But last night he boasted to me about Abdul Ali.  He\nlaughed at me.  Then he--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Grim interrupted.  \"Will you play the man now, if I\ngive you the chance?\"\n\n\"If you will accord me opportunity, at least I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Understand;  you'll not be allowed to live here afterward.\nYou'll be repatriated to Austria, or wherever you come from.\nAll you're offered is a chance to clean your slate morally before\nyou go.\"\n\n\"I shall be grateful.\"\n\n\"Will you obey?\"\n\n\"Absolutely--to the limit of my power, that is to say.  I am not\nan athlete--not a man of active habits.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Listen.\" Grim turned to me again\n\n\"Take Scharnhoff to his house.  You know the way.  When afternoon\ncomes, set a table in the garden and let him sit at it.  He may\nas well read.  If nothing happens before dark, take him out a\nlamp and some food.  He mustn't move away.  He'd better change\ninto his proper clothes first.  Your job will be to keep an eye\non him until I come.  You'd better keep out of sight as much as\npossible, especially after dark.  Better watch him through the\nwindow.  And, by the way, take this pistol.  If Scharnhoff\ndisobeys you, shoot him.\"\n\nHe turned again on Scharnhoff.\n\n\"I hope you're not fooling yourself.  I should say the chance is\ntwo or three to one that you'll come out of this alive.  If\nyou're killed, you may flatter yourself that's a mighty sight\ncleaner than hanging.  If you come out with a whole skin, you\nshall leave the country without even going to jail.  Time to\ngo now.\"\n\nI slipped the heavy pistol into my pocket and led the way without\nsaying a word.  Scharnhoff followed me, rather drearily, and we\nwalked side by side toward the German Colony, he looking exactly\nlike one of those respectable and devout educated Arabs of the\nold style, who teach from commentaries on the Koran.  We excited\nno comment whatever.\n\n\"What will he do?  What is his purpose?\" Scharnhoff asked me\nafter a while.  \"If a man is in danger of death, he likes to know\nthe reason--the purpose of it.\"\n\nI had a better than faint glimmering of Grim's purpose, but saw\nno necessity to air my views on the subject.\n\n\"I'm amused,\" said I, \"at the strictly unofficial status of all\nthis.  You see, I'm no more connected with this administration\nthan you are.  I'm as alien as you.  You might say, I'm a\nstranger in Jerusalem.  Yet, here I am, with a perfectly official\npistol, loaded with official cartridges, under unofficial orders\nto shoot you at the first sign of disobedience.  And--strictly\nunofficially, between you and me--I shan't hesitate to do it!\"\n\nHe contrived a smile out of the depths of his despondency.\n\n\"I wonder--should you shoot me--what they would do to\nyou afterwards.\"\n\n\"Something unofficial,\" I suggested. \"But we'll leave that up to\nthem.  The point is--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry!  You shall have no trouble from me.\"  It took a\nlong time to reach his house, for the poor old chap was suffering\nfrom lack of sleep, and physical weariness, as well as disappointment,\nand I had to let him sit down by the wayside once or twice.  Being\nin hard condition, and not much more than half his age, I had almost\nforgotten that I had not slept the night before.  Keen curiosity as\nto what might happen between now and midnight was keeping me going.\n\nHe could hardly drag himself into the house.  But a bath, and\nsome food that I found in the larder restored him considerably.\nHe helped me carry out the table.  He chose a book of Schiller's\npoems to take with him, but did not read it;  he sat with his\nelbows on the table and his back toward the front door, resting\nhis chin gloomily on both fists.  He remained in that attitude\nall afternoon, and for all I know slept part of the time.\n\nBetween him and the window of the room I sat in were some shrubs\nthat obscured the view considerably.  I could see Scharnhoff\nthrough them easily enough, but I don't think he could see me,\nand certainly no one could have seen me from the road.  I felt\nfairly sure that no one saw me until it began to grow dark and I\ncarried out the lamp.  Even then, it was Scharnhoff who struck\nthe match and lit it, so that I was in shadow all the time--\nprobably unrecognizable.\n\nIt had been fairly easy to keep awake until then, but as the room\ngrew darker and darker, and nothing happened, the yearning to\nfall asleep became actual agony.  It was a rather large, square\nroom, crowded up with a jumble of antiquities.  The only real\nfurniture was the window-seat on which I knelt, and an oblong\ntable;  but even the table was laid on its side to make room for\na battered Roman bust standing on the floor between its legs.\n\nI had left the door of the room wide open, in order to be able to\nhear anything that might happen in the house;  but the only sound\ncame from a couple of rats that gnawed and rustled interminably\namong the rubbish in the corner.\n\nIt must have been nearly eight o'clock, and I believe I had\nactually dozed off at last, kneeling in the window, when all at\nonce it seemed to me that the rats were making a different, and\ngreater noise than I ever heard rats make.  It was pitch-black\ndark.  I couldn't see my hand in front of me.  My first thought\nwas to glance through the window at Scharnhoff, but something--\nintuition, I suppose--made me draw aside from the window instead.\n\nThen, beyond any shadow of a doubt, I heard a man move, and\nthe hair rose all up the back of my head.  I remembered\nthe pistol, clutched it, and found voice enough for two words:\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Hee-hee!\" came the answer from behind the table.  \"So Major\nJimgrim lied about a broken leg, and thought to trap Noureddin\nAli, did he!  Don't move, Major Jimgrim!  Don't move!  We will\nhave a little talk before we bid each other good-bye!  I cannot\nlast long in any case, for the cursed Sikhs are after me.  I\nwould rather that you should kill me than those Sikhs should, but\nI would like to kill you also.  If you move before I give you\nleave you are a dead man, Major Jimgrim!  Hee-hee!  You cannot\nsee me!  Better keep still!\"\n\nIf it was flattering to be mistaken for Grim in the dark, it was\nhardly pleasant in the circumstances.  For a moment I was angry.\nIt flashed across my mind that Grim had planned this.  But on\nsecond thought I refused to believe he would deceive me about\nScharnhoff and use me as a decoy without my permission.  I\ndecided to keep still and see what happened.\n\n\"Do you think you deserve to live, Major Jimgrim?\" Noureddin\nAli's voice went on.  I heard him shift his position.  He was\nprobably trying to see my outline against the dark wall in order\nto take aim.  \"You, a foreigner, interfering in the politics of\nthis land?  But for you there would have been an explosion today\nthat would have liberated all the Moslem world.  But for that lie\nabout a broken leg you would have died a little after ten o'clock\nthis morning--hee-hee--instead of now!  Don't move, Major\nJimgrim!  You and I will have a duel presently.  There is lots of\ntime.  The Sikhs lost track of me.\"\n\nI did move.  I stooped down close to the floor, so that he might\nfire over my head if, as I suspected, he was merely gaining time\nin order to take sure aim.  I tried to see which end of the table\nhe was talking from, but he was hidden completely.\n\n\"Do you think you should go free, to perpetrate more cowardly\ninterference, after spoiling that well-laid plan?  Hee-hee!  You\npoor fool!  Busy-bodies such as you invariably overreach\nthemselves.  Having tricked me two or three times, you thought,\ndidn't you? that you could draw me here to kill Scharnhoff, that\npoor old sheep.  You were careful, weren't you? to let Omar\nMahmoud go, in order that he might tell me how Scharnhoff had\nturned witness against us.  And the Sikhs followed Omar Mahmoud,\nuntil Omar Mahmoud found me.  And then they hunted me.  Hee-hee!\nDon't move!  Was that the plan?  Simultaneously then, being\nyourself only a fool after all, you flatter me and underestimate\nmy intelligence.  Hee-hee!\n\n\"You were right in thinking I would not submit to capture and\ndeath without first wreaking vengeance.  But vengeance on such a\nsheep as Scharnhoff?  With Major Jimgrim still alive?  What\npossessed you?  Were you mad?  I satisfied myself an hour ago\nthat Scharnhoff was the bait, which the redoubtable Major Jimgrim\nwould be watching.  Perhaps I shall deal with Scharnhoff\nafterwards--hee-hee!--who knows?  Now--now shall we fight that\nduel?  Are you ready?\"\n\nI supposed that meant that he could not see me and had given up\nhope of it.  He would like to have me move first, so as to judge\nmy exact whereabouts by sound.  I reached out very cautiously,\nand rapped the muzzle of my pistol on the floor twice.\n\nHe fired instantly, three shots in succession.  The bullets went\nwild to my left and brought down showers of plaster from the\nwall.  I feared he might have seen me by the pistol-flash.  I did\nnot fire back.  There was no need.  Something moved swiftly like\na black ghost through the open door.  There was a thud--and the\nring of a steel swivel--and a scream.\n\n\"Has the sahib a match?\" said a gruff voice that I thought\nI recognized.\n\nI was trembling--excitement, of course--only children and women\nand foreigners ever feel afraid!  It took me half a minute to\nfind the match box, and the other half to strike a light.\n\nNarayan Singh was standing by the end of the table.  He was\nwiping blood off his bayonet with a piece of newspaper.  He\nlooked cool enough to have carried the paper in his pocket for\nthat purpose.  I got up, feeling ashamed to be seen crouching on\nthe floor.  But Narayan Singh smiled approval.\n\n\"You did well, sahib.  All men are equal in the dark.  Until he\nfired first there was nothing wise to do but hide.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Five minutes.  I only waited for a sure thrust.  But hah? the\nsahib feels like a dead man come to life again, eh?  Well I know\nthat feeling!\"\n\nThe match burned my fingers.  I struck another.  As I did that\nGrim stood in the doorway, smiling.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" he asked.\n\n\"Surely, sahib.  Shall I go now and get that other one--that\nOmar Mahmoud?\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Grim.  \"They rounded him up five minutes after he\nhad found Noureddin.\"\n\n\"Then have I done all that was required of me?\"\n\n\"No, Narayan Singh.  You haven't shaken hands with me yet.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jimgrim.\"\n\nThe match went out.  I struck a third one.  Grim turned to me.\n\n\"Hungry?\"\n\n\"Sleepy.\"\n\n\"Oh, to hell with sleep!  Let's bring old Scharnhoff into the\nother room, dig out some eats and drinks, and get a story from\nhim.  All right, Narayan Singh;  there'll be a guard here in\nten minutes to take charge of that body.  After that, dismiss.\nI'll report you to Colonel Goodenough for being a damned\ngood soldier.\"\n\n\"My colonel sahib knew that years ago,\" the great Sikh answered\nquietly.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Jimgrim and Allah's Peace, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JIMGRIM AND ALLAH'S PEACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11357.txt or 11357.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/3/5/11357/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
