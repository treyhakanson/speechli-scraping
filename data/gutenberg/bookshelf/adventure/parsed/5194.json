While his\nolder brother lived, Monty had continued in his element, a cavalry\nofficer, his combined income and pay ample for all that the Bombay side\nof India might require of an English gentleman.  They say that a finer\npolo player, a steadier shot on foot at a tiger, or a bolder squadron\nleader never lived.\n\nBut to Monty's infinite disgust his brother died childless.  It is\ndivulging no secret that the income that passed with the title varied\nbetween five and seven thousand pounds a year, according as coal was\nhigh, and tenants prosperous or not--a mere miserable pittance, of\ncourse, for the Earl of Montdidier and Kirkudbrightshire; so that all\nhis ventures, and therefore ours, had one avowed end--shekels enough to\nlift the mortgages from his estates.\n\nFive generations of soldiers had blazed the Montdidier fame on\nbattle-grounds, to a nation's (and why not the whole earth's) benefit,\nwithout replenishing the family funds, and Monty (himself a confirmed\nand convinced bachelor) was minded when his own time should come to\npass the title along to the next in line together with sufficient funds\nto support its dignity.\n\nTo us--even to Yerkes, familiar with United States merchant kings--he\nseemed with his thirty thousand dollars a year already a gilded\nCroesus.  He had ample to travel on, and finance prospecting trips.  We\nnever lacked for working capital, but the quest (and, including Yerkes,\nwe were as keen as he) led us into strange places.\n\nSo behold him--a privy councilor of England if you please--lounging in\nthe lazaretto of Zanzibar, clothed only in slippers, underwear and a\nlong blue dressing-gown.  We three others were dressed the same, and\nbecause it smacked of official restraint we objected noisily; but\nMonty did not seem to mind much. He was rather bored, but unresentful.\n\nA French steamer had put us ashore in quarantine, with the grim word\ncholera against us, and although our tale of suffering and Monty's\nrank, insured us a friendly reception, the port health authorities\nelected to be strict and we were given a nice long lazy time in which\nto cool our heels and order new clothes.  (Guns, kit, tents, and all\nbut what we stood in had gone to the bottom with the German cholera\nship from whose life-boat the French had rescued us.)\n\n\"Keeping us all this time in this place, is sheer tyranny!\" grumbled\nYerkes. \"If any one wants my opinion, they're afraid we'd talk if they\nlet us out--more afraid of offending Germans than they are of cholera!\nBesides--any fool could know by now we're not sick!\"\n\n\"There might be something in that,\" admitted Monty.\n\n\"I'd send for the U. S. Consul and sing the song out loud, but for\nyou!\" Yerkes added.\n\nMonty nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"Dashed good of you, Will, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"You English are so everlastingly afraid of seeming to start trouble,\nyou'll swallow anything rather than talk!\"\n\n\"As a government, perhaps yes,\" admitted Monty.  \"As a people, I fancy\nnot.  As a people we vary.\"\n\n\"You vary in that respect as much as sardines in a can!  I traveled\nonce all the way from London to Glasgow alone in one compartment with\nan Englishman.  Talk?  My, we were garrulous!  I offered him a\nnewspaper, cigarettes, matches, remarks on the weather suited to his\nbrand of intelligence--(that's your sole national topic of talk between\nstrangers!)--and all he ever said to me was 'Haw-ah!'  I'll bet he was\nafraid of seeming to start trouble!\"\n\n\"He didn't start any, did he?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Pretty nearly he did!  I all but bashed him over the bean with the\nnewspaper the third time he said 'haw-ah!'\"\n\nMonty laughed.  Fred Oakes was busy across the room with his most\namazing gift of tongues, splicing together half-a-dozen of them in\norder to talk with the old lazaretto attendant, so he heard nothing;\notherwise there would have been argument.\n\n\"Then it would have been you, not he who started trouble,\"' said I, and\nYerkes threw both hands up in a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Even you're afraid of starting something!\"  He stared at both of us\nwith an almost startled expression, as if he could not believe his own\nverdict, yet could not get away from it.  \"Else you'd give the\nBundesrath story to the papers!  That German skipper's conduct ought to\nbe bruited round the world!  You said you'd do it.  You promised us!\nYou told the man to his face you would!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Monty, \"you've touched on another national habit.\"\n\n\"Which one?\" Yerkes demanded.\n\n\"Dislike of telling tales out of school.  The man's dead.  His ship's\nat the bottom.  The tale's ended.  What's the use?  Besides--?\"\n\n\"Ah!  You've another reason!  Spill it!\"\n\n\"As a privy councilor, y'know, and all that sort of thing--?\"\n\n\"Same story!  Afraid of starting something!\"\n\n\"The Germans--'specially their navy men--drink to what they call Der\nTag y'know--the day when they shall dare try to tackle England.  We all\nknow that.  They're planning war, twenty years from now perhaps, that\nshall give them all our colonies as well as India and Egypt.  They're\nso keen on it they can't keep from bragging.  Great Britain, on the\nother hand, hasn't the slightest intention of fighting if war can be\navoided; so why do anything meanwhile to increase the tension?  Why\nsend broadcast a story that would only arouse international hatred?\nThat's their method.  Ours--I mean our government's--is to give hatred\na chance to die down.  If our papers got hold of the Bundesrath story\nthey'd make a deuce of a noise, of course.\"\n\n\"If your government's so sure Germany is planning war,\" objected\nYerkes, \"why on earth not force war, and feed them full of it before\nthey're ready?\"\n\n\"Counsel of perfection,\" laughed Monty.  \"Government's responsible to\nthe Common--Commons to the people--people want peace and plenty.  No.\nYour guess was good.  We are in here while the government at home\nsquares the newspaper men.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me your British government controls the press?\"\n\n\"Hardly.  Seeing 'em--putting it up to 'em straight--asking 'em\npolitely.  They're public-spirited, y'know.  Hitting 'em with a club\nwould be another thing.  It's an easy-going nation, but kings have been\nsorry they tried force.  Did you never hear of a king who used force\nagainst American colonies?\"\n\n\"Good God!  So they keep you--an earl--a privy councilor--a retired\ncolonel of regulars in good standing--under lock and key in this\npest-house while they bribe the press not to tell the truth about some\nGermans and start trouble?\"\n\n\"Not exactly\" said Monty.\n\n\"But here you are!\"\n\n\"I preferred to remain with my party.\"\n\n\"You moan they'd have let you out and kept us in?\"\n\n\"They'd have phrased it differently, but that's about what it would\nhave amounted to.  I have privileges.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm jiggered!\"\n\n\"I rather suspect it's not so bad as that,\" said Monty.  \"You're with\nfriends in quarantine, Will!\"\n\nFor a quarantine station in the tropics it was after all not such a bad\nplace.  We could hear the crooning of lazy rollers on the beach, and\nwhat little sea-breeze moved at all came in to us through iron-barred\nwindows.  The walls were of coral, three feet thick.  So was the roof.\nThe wet red-tiled floor made at least an impression of coolness, and\nthe fresh green foliage of an enormous mango tree, while it obstructed\nmost of the view, suggested anything but durance vile.  From not very\nfar away the aromatic smell of a clove warehouse located us, not\ndisagreeably, at the farther end of one of Sindbad's journeys, and the\nbirds in the mango branches cried and were colorful with hues and notes\nof merry extravagance.  Zanzibar is no parson's paradise--nor the\ncenter of much high society.  It reeks of unsavory history as well as\nof spices.  But it has its charms, and the Arabs love it.\n\nIt had Fred Oakes so interested that he had forgotten his\nconcertina--his one possession saved from shipwreck, for which he had\noffered to fight the whole of Zanzibar one-handed rather than have it\nburned.\n\n(\"Damnation! it has silver reeds--it's an English top-hole one--a\nwonder!\")\n\nSo the doctors who are kind men in the main disinfected it twice, once\non the French liner that picked us out of the Bundesrath's boat, and\nagain in Zanzibar; and with the stench of lord-knew-what zealous\nchemical upon it he had let it lie unused while he picked up Kiswahili\nand talked by the hour to a toothless, wrinkled very black man with a\ntouch of Arab in his breeding, and a deal of it in his brimstone\nvocabulary.\n\nPresently Fred came over and joined us, dancing across the wide red\nfloor with the skirts of his gown outspread like a ballet\ndancer's--ridiculous and perfectly aware of it.\n\n\"Monty, you're rich!  We're all made men!  We're all rich!  Let's spend\nmoney!  Let's send for catalogues and order things!\"\n\nMonty declined to take fire.  It was I, latest to join the partnership\nand much the least affluent, who bit.\n\n\"If you love the Lord, explain!\" said I.\n\n\"This old one-eyed lazaretto attendant is an ex-slave, ex-accomplice of\nTippoo Tib!\"\n\n\"And Tippoo Tib?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ignorant fo'castle outcast!\"  (All that because I had made one voyage\nas foremast hand, and deserted rather than submit to more of it.)\n\"Tippoo Tib is the Arab--is, mind you, my son, not was--the Arab who\nwas made governor of half the Congo by H. M. Stanley and the rest of\n'em.  Tippoo Tib is the expert who used to bring the slave caravans to\nZanzibar--bring 'em, send 'em, send for 'em--he owned 'em anyway.\nTippoo Tib was the biggest ivory hunter and trader lived since old King\nSolomon!  Tippoo Tib is here--in Zanzibar--to all intents and purposes\na prisoner on parole--old as the hills--getting ready to die--and proud\nas the very ace of hell.  So says One-eye!\"\n\n\"So we're all rich?\" suggested Monty.\n\n\"Of course we are!  Listen!  The British government took Tippoo's\nslaves away and busted his business.  Made him come and live in this\nplace, go to church on Sundays, and be good.  Then they asked him what\nhe'd done with his ivory.  Asked him politely after putting him through\nthat mill!  One-eye here says Tippoo had a million tusks--a\nmillion!--safely buried!  Government offered him ten per cent. of their\ncash value if he'd tell 'em where, and the old sport spat in their\nfaces!  Swears he'll die with the secret!  One-eye vows Tippoo is the\nonly one who knows.  There were others, but Tippoo shot or poisoned\n'em.\"\n\n\"So we're rich,\" smiled Yerkes.\n\n\"Of course we are!  Consider this, America, and tell me if Standard Oil\ncan beat it!  One million tusks!  I'm told--\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"One-eye says--\"\n\n\"You'll say 'Oh!' at me to a different tune, before I've done!  One-eye\nsays it never paid to carry a tusk weighing less than sixty pounds.\nSome tusks weigh two hundred--some even more--took four men to carry\nsome of 'em!  Call it an average weight of one hundred pounds and be on\nthe safe side.\"\n\n\"Yes, let's play safe,\" agreed Monty seriously.\n\n\"One hundred million pounds of ivory!\" said Fred, with a smack of his\nlips and the air of a man who could see the whole of it.  \"The present\nmarket price of new ivory is over ten shillings a pound on the spot.\nThat'll all be very old stuff, worth at least double.  But let's say\nten shillings a pound and be on the safe side.\"\n\n\"Yes, let's!\" laughed Yerkes.\n\n\"One thousand million--a billion shillings!\" Fred announced.  \"Fifty\nmillion pounds!\"\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty million dollars!\" Yerkes calculated, beginning\nto take serious notice.\n\n\"But how are we to find it?\" I objected.\n\n\"That's the point.  Government 'ud hog the lot, but has hunted high and\nlow and can't find it.  So the offer stands ten per cent. to any one\nwho does--ten per cent. of fifty million--lowest reckoning, mind\nyou!--five million pounds!  Half for Monty--two and a half million.  A\nmillion for Yerkes, a million for me, and a half a million for you all\naccording to contract!  How d'you like it?\"\n\n\"Well enough,\" I answered. \"If its only the hundredth part true, I'm\nenthusiastic!\"\n\n\"So now suit yourselves!\" said Fred, collapsing with a sweep of his\nskirts into the nearest chair.  \"I've told you what One-eye says.\nThese dusky gents sometimes exaggerate of course--\"\n\n\"Now and then,\" admitted Monty.\n\n\"But where there's smoke you mean there's prob'ly some one smoking\nhams?\" suggested Yerkes.\n\n\"I mean, let's find that ivory!\" said Fred.\n\n\"We might do worse than make an inquiry or two,\" Monty assented\ncautiously.\n\n\"Didums, you damned fool, you're growing old!  You're wasting time!\nYou're trying to damp enthusiasm!  You're--you're--\"\n\n\"Interested, Fred.  I'm interested.  Let's--\"\n\n\"Let's find that ivory and to hell with caution!  Why, man alive, it's\nthe chance of a million lifetimes!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Monty, \"admitting the story's true for the sake of\nargument, how do you propose to get on the track of the secret?\"\n\n\"Get on it?  I am on it!  Didn't One-eye say Tippoo Tib is alive and in\nZanzibar?  The old rascal!  Many a slave he's done to death!  Many a\nman he's tortured!  I propose we catch Tippoo Tib, hide him, and pull\nout his toe-nails one by one until be blows the gaff!\"\n\n(To hear Fred talk when there is nothing to do but talk a stranger\nmight arrive at many false conclusions.)\n\n\"If there's any truth in the story at all,\" said Monty, \"government\nwill have done everything within the bounds of decency to coax the\nfacts from Tippoo Tib.  I suspect we'd have to take our chance and\nsimply hunt.  But let's hear Juma's story.\"\n\nSo the old attendant left off sprinkling water from a yellow jar, and\ncame and stood before us.  Fred's proposal of tweaking toe-nails would\nnot have been practical in his case, for he had none left.  His black\nlegs, visible because he had tucked his one long garment up about his\nwaist, were a mass of scars.  He was lean, angular, yet peculiarly\nstraight considering his years.  As he stood before us he let his\nshirt-like garment drop, and the change from scarecrow to deferential\nservant was instantaneous.  He was so wrinkled, and the wrinkles were\nso deep, that one scarcely noticed his sightless eye, almost hidden\namong a nest of creases; and in spite of the wrinkles, his polished,\nshaven head made him look ridiculously youthful because one expected\ngray hair and there was none.\n\n\"Ask him how he lost his toe-nails, Fred,\" said I.\n\nBut the old man knew enough English to answer for himself.  He made a\nwry grimace and showed his hands.  The finger-nails were gone too.\n\n\"Tell us your story, Juma,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Tell 'em about the pembe--the ivory--the much ivory--the meengi\npembe,\" echoed Fred.\n\n\"Let's hear about those nails of his first,\" said I.\n\n\"One thing'll prob'ly lead to another,\" Yerkes agreed. \"Start him on\nthe toe-nail story.\"\n\nBut it did not lead very far.  Fred, who had picked up Kiswahili enough\nto piece out the old man's broken English, drew him out and clarified\nthe tale.  But it only went to prove that others besides ourselves had\nheard of Tippoo Tib's hoard.  Some white man--we could not make head or\ntail of the name, but it sounded rather like Somebody belonging to a\nman named Carpets--had trapped him a few years before and put him to\ntorture in the belief that he knew the secret.\n\n\"But me not knowing nothing!\" he assured us solemnly, shaking his head\nagain and again.\n\nBut he was not in the least squeamish about telling us that Tippoo Tib\nhad surely buried huge quantities of ivory, and had caused to be slain\nafterward every one who shared the secret.\n\n\"How long ago?\" asked Monty.  But natives of that part of the earth are\npoor hands at reckoning time.\n\n\"Long time,\" he assured us.  He might have meant six years, or sixty.\nIt would have been all the same to him.\n\n\"No.  Me not liking Tippoo Tib.  One time his slave.  That bad.  Byumby\nset free.  That good.  Now working here.  This very good.\"\n\n\"Where do you think the ivory is?\" (This from Yerkes.)\n\nBut the old man shook his head.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" said Monty, \"slaves came mostly from the Congo\nside of Lake Victoria Nyanza.  Slave and elephant country were\napproximately the same as regards general direction, and there were two\nroutes from the Congo--the southern by way of Ujiji on Tanganyika to\nBagamoyo on what is now the German coast, and the other to the north of\nVictoria Nyanza ending at Mombasa. Ask him, Fred, which way the ivory\nused to come.\"\n\n\"Both ways,\" announced Juma without waiting for Fred to interpret.  He\nhad an uncanny trick of following conversation, his intelligence\nseeming to work by fits and starts.\n\n\"That gives us about half Africa for hunting-ground, and a job for\nlife!\" laughed Yerkes.\n\n\"Might have a worse!\" Fred answered, resentful of cold water thrown on\nhis discovery.\n\n\"Were you Tippoo Tib's slave when he buried the ivory?\" demanded Monty,\nand the old man nodded.\n\n\"Where were you at the time?\"\n\nJuma made a gesture intended to suggest immeasurable distances toward\nthe West, and the name of the place he mentioned was one we had never\nheard of.\n\n\"Can you take us to Tippoo Tib when we leave this place?\" I asked, and\nhe nodded again.\n\n\"How much ivory do you suppose there was?\" asked Yerkes.\n\n\"Teli, teli!\" he answered, shaking his head.\n\n\"Too much!\" Fred translated.\n\n\"Pretty fair to middling vague,\" said Yerkes,\n\"but\"--judicially--\"almost worth investigating!\"\n\n\"Investigating?\" Fred sprang from his chair.  \"It's better than all\nKing Solomon's mines, El Dorado, Golconda, and Sindbad the Sailor's\ntreasure lands--rolled in one!  It's an obviously good thing!  All we\nneed is a bit of luck and the ivory's ours!\"\n\n\"I'll sell you my share now for a thousand dollars--come--come across!\"\ngrinned Yerkes.\n\nThere was a rough-house after that.  He and Fred nearly pulled the old\nattendant in two, each claiming the right to torture him first and\nlearn the secret.  They ended up without a whole rag between them, and\nhad to send Juma to head-quarters for new blue dressing-gowns.  The\ndoctor came himself--a fat good-natured party with an eye-glass and a\ncocktail appetite, acting locum-tenens for the real official who was\nhome on leave.  He brought the ingredients for cocktails with him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, shaking the mixer with a sort of deft solicitude.\n\"There's more than something in the tale.  I've had a try myself to get\ndetails.  Tippoo Tib believes in up-to-date physic, and when the old\nrascal's sick he sends for me.  I offered to mix him an elixir of life\nthat would make him out-live Methuselah if he'd give me as much as a\nhint of the general direction of his cache.\"\n\n\"He ought to have fallen for that,\" said Yerkes, but the doctor shook\nhis head.\n\n\"He's an Arab.  They're Shiah Muhammedans.  Their Paradise is a\npleasant place from all accounts.  He advised me to drink my own\nelixir, and have lots and lots of years in which to find the ivory,\nwithout being beholden to him for help.  Wily old scaramouch!  But I\nhad a better card up my sleeve.  He has taken to discarding ancient\nprejudices--doesn't drink or anything like that, but treats his harem\nalmost humanly.  Lets 'em have anything that costs him nothing.  Even\nsends for a medico when they're sick!  Getting lax in his old age!\nSent for me a while ago to attend his favorite wife--sixty years old if\nshe's a day, and as proud of him as if he were the king of Jerusalem.\nWell--I looked her over, judged she was likely to keep her bed, and did\nsome thinking.\"\n\n\"You know their religious law?  A woman can't go to Paradise without\nspecial intercession, mainly vicarious.  I found a mullah--that's a\nMuhammedan priest--who'd do anything for half of nothing.  They most of\nthem will.  I gave him fifty dibs, and promised him more if the trick\nworked.  Then I told the old woman she was going to die, but that if\nshe'd tell me the secret of Tippoo Tib's ivory I had a mullah handy who\nwould pass her into Paradise ahead of her old man.  What did she do?\nShe called Tippoo Tib, and he turned me out of the house.  So I'm fifty\nout of pocket, and what's worse, the old girl didn't die--got right up\nout of bed and stayed up!  My rep's all smashed to pieces among the\nArabs!\"\n\n\"D'you suppose the old woman knew the secret?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not she!  If she'd known it she'd have split!  The one ambition she\nhas left is to be with Tippoo Tib in Paradise.  But he can intercede\nfor her and get her in--provided he feels that way; so she rounded on\nme in the hope of winning his special favor!  But the old ruffian knows\nbetter!  He'll no more pray for her than tell me where the ivory is!\nThe Koran tells him there are much better houris in Paradise, so why\ntrouble to take along a toothless favorite from this world?\"\n\n\"Has the government any official information?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Quite a bit, I'm told.  Official records of vain searches.  Between\nyou and me and these four walls, about the only reason why they didn't\nhang the old slave-driving murderer was that they've always hoped he'd\ndivulge the secret some day.  But he hates the men who broke him far\ntoo bitterly to enrich them on any terms!  If any man wins the secret\nfrom him it'll be a foreigner.  They tell me a German had a hard try\nonce.  One of Karl Peters' men.\"\n\n\"That'll be Carpets!\" said Monty.  \"Somebody belonging to Carpets--Karl\nPeters.\"\n\n\"The man's serving a life sentence in the jail for torturing our friend\nJuma here.\"\n\n\"Then Juma knows the secret?\"\n\n\"So they say.  But Juma, too, hopes to go to Paradise and wait on\nTippoo Tib.\"\n\n\"He told us just now that he dislikes Tippoo Tib,\" I objected.\n\n\"So he does, but that makes no difference.  Tippoo Tib is a big\nchief--sultani kubwa--take any one he fancies to Heaven with him!\"\n\nWe all looked at Juma with a new respect.\n\n\"I got Juma his job in here,\" said the doctor.  \"I've rather the notion\nof getting my ten per cent. on the value of that ivory some day!\"\n\n\"Are there any people after it just now?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"I don't know, I'm sure.  There was a German named Schillingschen, who\nspent a month in Zanzibar and talked a lot with Tippoo Tib.  The old\nrascal might tell his secret to any one he thought was England's really\ndangerous enemy.  Schillingschen crossed over to British East if I\nremember rightly.  He might be on the track of it.\"\n\n\"Tell us more about Schillingschen,\" said Monty.\n\n\"He's one of those orientalists, who profess to know more about Islam\nthan Christianity--more about Africa and Arabia than Europe--more about\nthe occult than what's in the open.  A man with a shovel\nbeard--stout--thick-set--talks Kiswahili and Arabic and half a dozen\nother languages better than the natives do themselves.  Has\nmoney--outfit like a prince's--everything\nimaginable--Rifles--microscopes--cigars--wine.  He didn't make himself\nagreeable here--except to the Arabs.  Didn't call at the Residency.\nSome of us asked him to dinner one evening, but he pleaded a headache.\nWe were glad, because afterward we saw him eat at the hotel--has ways\nof using his fingers at table, picked up I suppose from the people he\nhas lived among.\"\n\n\"Are you nearly ready to let us out of here?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Your quarantine's up,\" said the doctor.  \"I'm only waiting for word\nfrom the office.\"\n\nWe drank three rounds of cocktails with him, after which he grew darkly\nfriendly and proposed we should all set out together in search of the\nhoard.\n\n\"I've no money,\" he assured us.  \"Nothing but a knowledge of the\nnatives and a priceless thirst.  I'd have to throw up my practise here.\nOf course I'd need some sort of guarantee from you chaps.\"\n\nThe proposal falling flat, he gathered the nearly empty bottles into\none place and shouted for his boy to come and carry them away.\n\n\"Think it over!\" he urged as he got up to leave us.  \"You might take a\nbigger fool than me with you.  You'd need a doctor on a trip like that.\nI'm an expert on some of these tropical diseases.  Think it over!\"\n\n\"Fred!\" said Monty, as soon as the doctor had left the room, \"I'm\ntempted by this ivory of yours.\"\n\nBut Fred, in the new blue dressing-gown the doctor had brought, was in\nanother world--a land of trope and key and metaphor.  For the last ten\nminutes he had kept a stub of pencil and a scrap of paper working, and\nnow the strident tones of his too long neglected concertina stirred the\nheavy air and shocked the birds outside to silence.  The instrument was\nwheezy, for in addition to the sacrilege the port authorities had done\nby way of disinfection, the bellows had been wetted when Fred plunged\nfrom the sinking Bundesrath and swam.  But he is not what you could\ncall particular, as long as a good loud noise comes forth that can be\njerked and broken into anything resembling tune.\n\n\"Tempted, are you?\" he laughed.  He looked like a drunken troubadour en\ndeshabille, with those up-brushed mustaches and his usually neat brown\nbeard all spread awry.  \"Temptation's more fun than plunder!\"\n\nYerkes threw an orange at him, more by way of recognition than\nremonstrance.  We had not heard Fred sing since he tried to charm\ncholera victims in the Bundesrath's fo'castle, and, like the rest of\nus, he had his rights.  He sang with legs spread wide in front of him,\nand head thrown back, and, each time he came to the chorus, kept on\nrepeating it until we joined in.\n\n        There's a prize that's full familiar from Zanzibar to France;\n        From Tokio to Boston; we are paid it in advance.\n        It's the wages of adventure, and the wide world knows the feel\n        Of the stuff that stirs good huntsmen all and brings the\n          hounds to heel!\n        It's the one reward that's gratis and precedes the toilsome task--\n        It's the one thing always better than an optimist can ask!\n        It's amusing, it's amazing, and it's never twice the same;\n        It's the salt of true adventure and the glamour of the game!\n\n        CHORUS\n        It is tem-tem-pitation!\n        The one sublime sensation!\n        You may doubt it, but without it\n        There would be no derring-do!\n        The reward the temptee cashes\n        Is too often dust and ashes,\n        But you'll need no spurs or lashes\n        When temptation beckons you!\n\n        Oh, it drew the Roman legions to old Britain's distant isle,\n        And it beckoned H. M. Stanley to the sources of the Nile;\n        It's the one and only reason for the bristling guns at Gib,\n        For the skeletons at Khartoum, and the crimes of Tippoo Tib.\n        The gentlemen adventurers braved torture for its sake,\n        It beckoned out the galleons, and filled the hulls of Drake!\n        Oh, it sets the sails of commerce, and it whets the edge of war,\n        It's the sole excuse for churches, and the only cause of law!\n\n        CHORUS\n        It is tem-tem-pitation! etc., etc.\n        No note is there of failure (that's a tune the croakers sing!)\n        This song's of youth, and strength, and health, and time\n            that's on the wing!\n        Of wealth beyond the hazy blue of far horizons flung--\n        But never of the folk returning, disillusioned, stung!\n        It's a tale of gold and ivory, of plunder out of reach,\n        Of luck that fell to other men, of treasure on the beach--\n        A compound, cross-reciprocating two-way double spell,\n        The low, sweet lure to Heaven, and the tallyho to hell!\n\n        CHORUS\n        It is tem-tem-pitation!\n        The one sublime sensation!\n        You may doubt it, but without it\n        There would be no derring-do!\n        It's the siren of to-morrow\n        That knows naught of lack or sorrow,\n        So you'll sell your bonds and borrow,\n        When temptation beckons you!\n\nOnce Fred starts there is no stopping him, short of personal violence,\nand he ran through his ever lengthening list of songs, not all quite\nprintable, until the very coral walls ached with the concertina's\nwailing, and our throats were hoarse from ridiculous choruses.  As\nYerkes put it:\n\n\"When pa says sing, the rest of us sing too or go crazy!\"\n\nI went to the window and tried to get a view of shipping through the\nmango branches.  Masts and sails--lateen spars particularly--always get\nme by the throat and make me happy for a while.  But all I could see\nwas a low wall beyond the little compound, and over the top of it\nheadgear of nearly all the kinds there are.  (Zanzibar is a wonderful\nmarket for second-hand clothes.  There was even a tall silk hat of not\nvery ancient pattern.)\n\n\"Come and look, Monty!\" said I, and he and Yerkes came and stood beside\nme.  Seeing his troubadour charm was broken, Fred snapped the catch on\nthe concertina and came too.\n\n\"Arabian Nights!\" he exclaimed, thumping Monty on the back.\n\n\"Didums, you drunkard, we're dead and in another world!  Juma is the\none-eyed Calender!  Look--fishermen--houris--how many houris?--seen 'em\ngrin!--soldiers of fortune--merchants--sailors--by gad, there's Sindbad\nhimself!--and say!  If that isn't the Sultan Haroun-al-Raschid in\ndisguise I'm willing to eat beans and pie for breakfast to oblige\nYerkes!  Look--look at the fat ruffian's stomach and swagger, will you?\"\n\nYerkes sized up the situation quickest.\n\n\"Sing him another song, Fred.  If we want to strike up acquaintance\nwith half Zanzibar, here's our chance!\"\n\n\"Oh, Richard, oh, my king!\" hummed Monty.  \"It's Coeur de Lion and\nBlondell over again with the harp reversed.\"\n\nIf Zanzibar may be said to possess main thoroughfares, that window of\nours commanded as much of one as the tree and wall permitted; and\nmusic--even of a concertina--is the key to the heart of all people\nwhose hair is crisp and kinky.  Perhaps rather owing to the generosity\nof their slave law, and Koran teachings, more than to racial depravity,\nthere are not very many Arabs left in that part of the world with true\nsemitic features and straight hair, nor many woolly-headed folk who are\nquite all-Bantu.  There is enough Arab blood in all of them to make\nthem bold; Bantu enough for syncopated, rag-time music to take them by\nthe toes and stir them.  The crowd in the street grew, and gathered\nuntil a policeman in red fez and khaki knickerbockers came and started\ntrouble.  He had a three-cornered fight on his hands, and no sympathy\nfrom any one, within two minutes.  Then the man with the stomach and\nswagger--he whom Fred called Haroun-al-Raschid--took a hand in masterly\nstyle.  He seized the police-man from behind, flung him out of the\ncrowd, and nobody was troubled any more by that official.\n\n\"That him Tippoo Tib's nephew!\" said a voice, and we all jumped.  We\nhad not noticed Juma come and stand beside us.\n\n\"I suspect nephew is a vague relationship in these parts,\" said Monty.\n\"Do you mean Tippoo's brother was that man's father, Juma?\"\n\n\"No, bwana.*  Tippoo Tib bringing slave long ago f'm Bagamoyo.  Him\nshe-slave having chile.  She becoming concubine Tippoo Tib his wife's\nbrother.  That chile Tippoo Tib's nephew.  Tea ready, bwana.\"\n\n-----------------\n* Bwana, Swahili word meaning master.\n-----------------\n\n\"What does that man do for a living?\"\n\n\"Do for a living?\" Juma was bewildered.\n\n\"What does he work at?\"\n\n\"Not working.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"No.\n\n\"Has he private means, then?\"\n\n\"I not understand.  Tea ready, bwana!\"\n\n\"Has he got mali*?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Mali?  No.  Him poor man.\"\n\n--------------\n*Mali, Swahili word meaning possession, property.\n--------------\n\n\"Then how does he exist, if he has no mali and doesn't work?\"\n\n\"Oh, one wife here, one there, one other place, an'\nTippoo Tib byumby him giving food.\"\n\n\"How many wives has he?\"\n\n\"Tea ready, bwana!\"\n\n\"How do they come to be spread all over the place?\" (We were shooting\nquestions at him one after the other, and Juma began to look as if he\nwould have preferred a repetition of the toe-nail incident.)\n\n\"Oh, he travel much, an' byumby lose all money, then stay here.  Tea,\nhim growing cold.\"\n\nThere is no persuading the native servant who has lived under the Union\nJack that an Englishman does not need hot tea at frequent intervals,\neven after three cocktails in an afternoon.  So we trooped to the table\nto oblige him, and went through the form of being much refreshed.\n\n\"What is that man's name?\" demanded Monty.\n\n\"Hassan.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Everybody know him!\"\n\n\"Can you get a message to him?\"\n\n\"Yes, bwana.\"\n\n\"Tell him to come and talk with us at the hotel as soon as he hears we\nare out of this.\"\n\nWe did not know it at the time (for I don't think that Monty guessed it\neither) that we had taken the surest way of setting all Zanzibar by the\nears.  In that last lingering stronghold of legal slavery,* where the\nonly stories judged worth listening to are the very sources of the\nThousand Nights and a Night, intrigue is not perhaps the breath of\nlife, but it is the salt and savory.  There is a woolly-headed sultan\nwho draws a guaranteed, fixed income and has nothing better to do than\nregale himself and a harem with western alleged amusement.  There are\npolice, and lights, and municipal regulations.  In fact, Zanzibar has\ncome on miserable times from certain points of view.  But there remains\nthe fun of listening to all the rumors borne by sea.  \"Play on the\nflute in Zanzibar and Africa as far as the lakes will dance!\" the Arabs\nsay, and the gentry who once drove slaves or traded ivory refuse to\nbelieve that the day of lawlessness is gone forever.  One rumor then is\nworth ten facts.  Four white men singing behind the bars of the\nlazaretto, desiring to speak with Hassan, \"'nephew\" of Tippoo Tib, and\noffering money for the introduction, were enough to send whispers\nsizzling up and down all the mazy streets.\n\n----------------\n* Slavery was not absolutely and finally abolished in Zanzibar until\n1906, during which year even the old slaves, hitherto unwilling to be\nset free, had to be pensioned off.\n----------------\n\nOur release from quarantine took place next day, and we went to the\nhotel, where we were besieged at once by tradesmen, each proclaiming\nhimself the only honest outfitter and \"agent for all good export\nfirms.\"  Monty departed to call on British officialdom (one advantage\nof traveling with a nobleman being that he has to do the stilted social\nstuff). Yerkes went to call on the United States Consul, the same being\npresumably a part of his religion, for he always does it, and almost\nalways abuses his government afterward.  So Fred and I were left to\nrepel boarders, and it came about that we two received Hassan.\n\nHe entered our room with a great shout of \"Hodi!\" (and Fred knew enough\nto say \"Karibu!\")--a smart red fez set at an angle on his shaven head,\nhis henna-stained beard all newly-combed--a garment like a night-shirt\nreaching nearly to his heels, a sort of vest of silk embroidery\nrestraining his stomach's tendency to wobble at will, and a fat smile\ndecorating the least ashamed, most obviously opportunist face I ever\nsaw, even on a black man.\n\n\"Jambo, jambo;\"* he announced, striding in and observing our lack of\nworldly goods with one sweep of the eye.  (We had not stocked up yet\nwith new things, and probably he did not know our old ones were at the\nbottom of the sea.)  He was a lion-hearted rascal though, at all events\nat the first rush, for poverty on the surface did not trouble him.\n\n---------------\n* Jambo, good day.\n---------------\n\n\"You send for me?  You want a good guide?\"\n\nThe Haroun-al-Raschid look had disappeared.  Now he was the\njack-of-all-trades, wondering which end of the jack to push in first.\n\n\"When I need a guide I'll get a licensed one,\" said Fred, sitting down\nand turning partly away from him.  (It never pays to let those gentry\nthink they have impressed you.) \"What is your business, Johnson?\"\n\n\"My name Hassan, sah.  You send for me?  You want a headman.  I'm\nformerly headman for Tippoo Tib, knowing all roads, and how to manage\nwapagazi,* safari,** all things!\"\n\n---------------\n* Wapagazi, plural of pagazi, porter.\n** Safari, journey, and, by inference, outfit for a journey.\n---------------\n\n\"Any papers to prove it?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"No, sir.  Reference to Tippoo Tib himself sufficient!  He my\npart-uncle.\"\n\n\"Ready to tell any kind of a lie for you, eh?\"\n\n\"No, sir, always telling truth!  You got a cook yet?\"\n\n\"Can you cook?\" Fred answered guardedly.\n\n\"Yes, sah.  Was cook formerly for Master Stanley, go with him on\nexpedition.  Later his boy.  Later his headman.  You want to go on\nexpedition, I getting you good cook.  Where you want to go?\"\n\n\"Are you looking for a job?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"What you after? Ivory?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"I know all about ivory--I shoot, trade ivory along o' Tippoo Tib an'\nStanley.  You engage my services, all very well.\"\n\n\"Go and tell Tippoo Tib we want to see him.  If he confirms what you\nsay, perhaps we'll take you on,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Tell Tippoo Tib?  Ha-ha!  You want to find his buried ivory--that it?\nAll white men wanting that!  All right, I go tell him!  I come again!\"\n\n\"Come back here, you fat rascal!\" ordered Fred.  \"What do you mean\nabout buried ivory?  What buried ivory?\"\n\nHassan's face lost some of its transcendent cheek.  Even the dyed beard\nseemed to wilt.\n\n\"What you wanting?\" he asked.  \"Hunt, trade, travel--what your\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Fish!\" Fred answered genially.\n\n\"Samaki?\"\n\n\"Yes--samaki--fish!\"\n\nHaving no experience of Arabs, and part-Arabs, I wondered what on earth\nFred could be driving at.  But Hassan wondered still more, and that was\nthe whole point.  He stood agape, looking from one to the other of us,\nhis fat good-natured face an interrogation mark.\n\n\"I go an' tell bwana Tippoo Tib!\" he announced, and departed swiftly.\n\n\"What's the idea of fish, Fred?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, just curiosity.  The way of getting information out of colored\nfolk is to get them so frantically curious they've no time to think up\nlies.  Tobacco would have done as well--anything unexpected.  A bird\nflying, and a black man lying,--are both of 'em easy to catch or\nconfuse unless they know which way they're heading.  Let's go and look\nat the bazaar.\"\n\nBut in order to look one had to reach.  We left the great heavy-beamed\nhotel that had once been Tippoo Tib's residence, but were stopped in\nthe outer doorway by a crowd of native boys, each with a brass plate on\nhis arm.\n\n\"Guide, sah!--Guide, sah!--My name 'McPhairson, sah!--My name Jones,\nsah!--My name Johnson, sah!  Guide to all the sights, sah!\"\n\nThey were as persistent and evilly intentioned as a swarm of flies, and\nbold enough to strike back when anybody kicked them.  While we wrestled\nand swore, but made no headway, we were accosted by a Greek, who seemed\nfrom long experience able to pass through them without striking or\nbeing struck.  We were not left in doubt another second as to whether\nour friend Hassan had dallied on the way, and held his tongue or not.\n\n\"Good day, gentlemen!  I hear you are after fish!  Hah!  That is a good\nstory to tell to Arabs!  You mean fishing for information, eh?  Ha-hah!\"\n\nHe turned on the swarm of boys, who still yelled and struggled about\nour legs.\n\n\"Imshi!* Voetsak!** Enenda zako!***  Kuma nina, wewe!****\"  In a minute\nhe had them all scattering, for only innocence and inexperience attract\nthe preying youth of Zanzibar.  \"Now, gentlemen, my name is\nCoutlass--Georges Coutlass.  Have a drink with me, and let me tell you\nsomething.\"\n\n-----------------\n* Imshi (Arabic), get to hell out of here!\n** Voetsak (Cape Dutch), ditto.\n*** Enenda zako (Kiswahill), ditto.\n**** Kuma nina (Kiswahill). An opprobrious, and perhaps the commonest\nexpletive In the language, amounting to a request for details of the\nobjurgee's female ancestry.  By no means for use in drawing-rooms.\n------------------\n\nHe was tall, dark skinned, athletic, and roguish-looking even for the\nbrand of Greek one meets with south of the Levant--dressed in khaki,\nwith an American cowboy hat--his fingers nearly black with cigarette\njuice--his hands unusually horny for that climate--and his hair\nclipped so short that it showed the bumps of avarice and other things,\nsaid to reside below the hat-band to the rear.  Yet a plausible,\ncompanionable-seeming man.  And Zanzibar confers democratic privilege,\nas well as fevers; impartiality hovers in the atmosphere as well as\nsmells, and we neither of us dreamed of hesitating, but followed him\nback into the bar--a wide, low-ceilinged room whose beams were two feet\nthick of blackened, polished hard wood.  There we sat one each side of\nhim in cane armchairs.  He ordered the drinks, and paid for them.\n\n\"First I will tell you who I am,\" he said, when he had swallowed a\nfoot-long whisky peg and wiped his lips with his coat sleeve.  \"I never\nboast.  I don't need to!  I am Georges Coutlass!  I learned that you\nhave an English lord among your party, and said I to myself  'Aha!\nThere is a man who will appreciate me, who am a citizen of three\nlands!'  Which of you gentlemen is the lord?\"\n\n\"How can you be a citizen of three countries?\" Fred countered.\n\n\"Of Greece, for I was born in Greece.  I have fought Turks.  Ah!  I\nhave bled for Greece.  I have spilt my blood in many lands, but the\nbest was for my motherland!--Of England, for I became naturalized.  By\nbloody-hell-and-Waterloo, but I admire the English!  They have guts,\nthose English, and I am one of them!  By the great horn spoon, yes, I\nbecame an Englishman at Bow Street one Monday morning, price Five\nPounds.  I was lined up with the drunks and pick-pockets, and by Jumbo\nthe magistrate mistook me for a thief! He would have given me six\nmonths without the option in another minute, but I had the good luck to\nremember how much money I had paid my witnesses.  The thought of paying\nthat for nothing--worse than nothing, for six months in jail!--in an\nEnglish jail!--pick oakum!--eat skilly!--that thought brought me to my\nsenses.  'By Gassharamminy,' I said, 'I may be mad, but I'm sober!  If\nit's a crime to desire to be English, then punish me, but let me first\ncommit the offense!'  So he laughed, and didn't question my witnesses\nvery carefully--one was a Jew, the other an ex-German, and either of\nthem would swear to anything at half price for a quantity--and they\nkissed the Book and committed perjury--and lo and behold, I was English\nas you are--English without troubling a midwife or the parson!  Five\npounds for the 'beak' at Bow Street--fifty for the\nwitnesses--fifty-five all told--and cheap at the price!  I had money in\nthose days.  It was after our short war with Turkey.  We Greeks got\nbeaten, but the Turks did not get all the loot!  By prison and gallows,\nno!  When our men ran before a battle, I did not run--not I!  I\nremained, and by Croesus I grew richer in an hour than I have ever been\nsince!\"\n\n\"That's two countries,\" said I.  \"Which is the third that has the honor\nto claim your allegiance?\"\n\n\"Honor is right!\" he answered with a proud smile.  \"I, Georges Coutlass,\nhave honored three flags!  I am a credit to all three countries!  The\nthird is America--the U. S. A.  You might say that is the corollary of\nbeing English--the natural, logical, correct sequence!  The U. S. laws\nare strict, but their politics were devised for--what is it the\npreachers call it--ah, yes, for straining out gnats and swallowing\ncamels.  By George Washington they would swallow a house on fire!\nThere was a federal election shortly due.  One of the\nparties--Democratic--Republican--I forget which--maybe both!--needed\nnew voters.  The law says it takes five years to become a citizen.\nPolitics said fifteen minutes!  The politicians paid the fees too!  I\nwas a citizen--a voter--an elector of presidents before I had been\nashore three months, and I had sold my vote three times over within a\nmonth of that!  They had me registered under three names in three\nseparate wards!  I didn't need the money--I had plenty in those days--I\ngave the six dollars I received for my votes to the Holy Church, and\nvoted the other way to save my conscience; but the fun of the thing\nappealed!  By Gassharamminy!  I can't take life the way the copy-books\nlay down!  I have to break laws or else break heads!  But I love\nAmerica!  I fought and bled for America!  By Abraham Lincoln, I fought\nthose Spaniards until I don't doubt they wished I had stayed in Greece!\nYes, I left that middle finger in Cuba--shot through the left hand by\na Don, think of it, a Don!  When I came out of hospital--and I never\nsaw anything worse than that hot hell!--I got myself attached to the\ncommissariat, and the pickings were none so bad.  Had to hand over too\nmuch, though.  That is the worst of America, there is no genuine\nliberty.  You have to steal for the man higher up.  If you keep more\nthan ten per cent., he squeals.  He has to pass most of it on again to\nsome one else, and so on, and they all land in jail in course of time!\nGive me a country where a man can keep what he finds!  There was talk\nabout congressional inquiries.  Then a friend of mine--a Greek--who had\nbeen out here told me of Tippoo Tib's ivory, and it looked all right to\nme to change scenes for a while.  I had citizenship papers--U. S., and\nEnglish, and a Greek passport in case of accident.  Traveling looked\ngood to me.\"\n\n\"If you traveled on a Greek passport you couldn't use citizenship\npapers of any other country,\" Fred objected.\n\n\"Who said I traveled on a Greek passport?  Do you take me for such a\nfool?  Who listens to a Greek consul?  He may protest, and accept fees,\nbut Greece is a little country and no one listens to her consuls.  I\ncarry a Greek passport in case I should find somewhere someday a Greek\nconsul with influence or a Greek whom I wish to convince.  I traveled\nto South Africa as an American.  I went to Cape Town with the idea of\ngoing to Salisbury, and working my way up from there as a trader into\nthe Congo.  I reached Johannesburg, and there I did a little I. D. B.\nand one thing and another until the Boer War came.  Then I fought for\nthe Boers.  Yes, I have bled for the Boer cause.  It was a damned bad\ncause!  They robbed me of nearly all my money!  They left me to die\nwhen I was wounded!  It was only by the grace of God, and the intrigues\nof a woman that I made my way to Lourenco Marquez.  No, the war was not\nover, but what did I care?  I, Georges Coutlass, had had enough of it!\nI recompensed myself en route.  I do not fight for a bunch of thieves\nfor nothing!  I sailed from Lourenco Marquez to Mombasa.  I hunted\nelephant in British East Africa until they posted a reward for me on\nthe telegraph poles.  The law says not more than two elephants in one\nyear.  I shot two hundred!  I sold the ivory to an Indian, bought\ncattle, and went down into German East Africa.  The Masai attacked me,\nstole some of the cattle, and killed others.  The Germans, damn and\nblast them, took the rest!  They accused me of crimes--me, Georges\nCoutlass!--and imposed fines calculated carefully to skin me of all I\nhad!  Roup and rotten livers! but I will knock them head-over-halleluja\none fine day!  Not for nothing shall they flim-flam Georges Coutlass!\nWhich of you gentlemen is the lord?\"\n\nWe bought him another drink, and watched it disappear with one\nuninterrupted gurgle down its appointed course.\n\n\"What did you do next?\" Fred asked him before he had recovered breath\nenough to question us.  \"I suppose the Germans had you at a loose end?\"\n\n\"Do you think that?  Sacred history of hell!  It takes more than a\nlousy military German to get Georges Coutlass at a loose end!  They\nmust get me dead before that can happen!  And then, by Blitzen, as\nthose devils say, a dead Georges Coutlass will be better than a\nthousand dead Germans!  In hell I will use them to clean my boots on!\nAt a loose end, was I?  I met this bloody rogue Hassan--the fat\nblackguard who told me you have come to Zanzibar for fish--and made an\nagreement with him to look for Tippoo Tib's buried ivory.  Yes, sir!  I\nshowed him papers.  He thought they were money drafts.  He thought me a\nman of means whom he could bleed.  I had guns and ammunition, he none.\nHe pretended to know where some of Tippoo Tib's ivory is buried.\"\n\n\"Some of it, eh?\" said Fred.\n\n\"Some of it, d'you say?\" said I.\n\n\"Some of it, yes.  A million tusks.  Some say two million!  Some say\nthree!  Thunder!--you take a hundred good tusks and bury them; you'll\nsee the hill you've made from five miles off!  A hundred thousand tusks\nwould make a mountain!  If any one buried a million tusks in one spot\nthey'd mark the place on maps as a watershed!  They must be buried\nhere, there, everywhere along the trail of Tippoo Tib--perhaps a\nthousand in one place at the most.  Which of you two gentlemen is the\nlord?\"\n\n\"Did Hassan lead you to any of it?\" Fred inquired.\n\n\"Not he!  The jelly-belly!  The Arab pig!  He led me to Ujiji--that's\non Lake Tanganika--the old slave market where he himself was once sold\nfor ten cents.  I don't doubt a piece of betel nut and a pair of\nworn-out shoes had to be thrown in with him at the price!  There he\ntried to make me pay the expenses in advance of a trip to Usumbora at\nthe head of the lake.  God knows what it would have cost, the way he\nwanted me to do it!  Are you the lord, sir?\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Do?  I parted company!  I had made him drunk once.  (The Arabs aren't\nsupposed to drink, so when they do they get talkative and lively!)  And\nI knew Arabic before ever I crossed the Atlantic--learned it in\nEgypt--ran away from a sponge-fishing boat when I was a boy.  No, they\ndon't fish sponges off the Nile Delta, but you can smuggle in a sponge\nboat better than in most ships.  Anyhow, I learned Arabic.  So I\nunderstood what that pig Hassan said when he talked in the dark with\nhis brother swine.  He knew no more than I where the ivory was!  He\nsuspected most of it was in a country called Ruanda that runs pretty\nmuch parallel with the Congo border to the west of Victoria Nyanza in\nGerman East Africa, and he was counting on finding natives who could\ntell him this and that that might put him on the trail of it!  I could\nbeat that game!  I could cross-examine fool natives twice as well as\nany fat rascal of an ex-slave!  Seeing he had paid all expenses so far,\nhowever, I was not much to the bad, so I picked a quarrel with him and\nwe parted company.  Wouldn't you have done the same, my lord?\"\n\nBut Fred did not walk into the trap.  \"What did you do next?\" he asked.\n\n\"Next?  I got a job with the agent of an Italian firm to go north and\nbuy skins.  He made me a good advance of trade goods--melikani,* beads,\niron and brass wire, kangas,** and all that sort of thing, and I did\nwell.  Made money on that trip.  Traveled north until I reached\nRuanda--went on until I could see the Fire Mountains in the distance,\nand the country all smothered in lava.  Reached a cannibal country,\nwhere the devils had eaten all the surrounding tribes until they had to\ntake to vegetarianism at last.\"\n\n-----------------\n* Melikani, the unbleached calico made in America that is the most\nuseful trade goods from sea to sea of Central Africa.\n** Kanga, cotton piece goods.\n-----------------\n\n\"But did you find the ivory?\" Fred insisted.\n\n\"No, or by Jiminy, I wouldn't be here!  If I'd found it I'd have\nsettled down with a wife in Greece long ago.  I'd be keeping an inn,\nand growing wine, and living like a gentleman!  But I found out enough\nto know there's a system that goes with the ivory Tippoo Tib buried.\nIf you found one lot, that would lead you to the next, and so on.  I\ngot a suspicion where one lot is, although I couldn't prove it.  And I\nmade up my mind that the German government knows darned well where a\nlot of it is!\"\n\n\"Then why don't the Germans dig it up?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"Aha!\" laughed Coutlass.  \"If I know, why should I tell! If they know,\nwhy should they tell?  Suppose that some of it were in Congo territory,\nand some in British East Africa?  Suppose they should want to get the\nlot?  What then?  If they uncovered their bit in German East Africa\nmightn't that put the Congo and the British on the trail?\"\n\n\"If they know where it is,\" said I, \"they'll certainly guard it.\"\n\n\"Which of you is the lord?\" demanded Coutlass earnestly.\n\n\"What do you suppose Hassan is doing, then, here in Zanzibar?\" asked\nFred.\n\n\"Rum and eggs!  I know what he is doing!  When I snapped my thumb under\nhis fat nose and told him about the habits of his female ancestors be\nwent to the Germans and informed against me!  The sneak-thief!  The\nturn-coat!  The maggot!  I shall not forget!  I, Georges Coutlass,\nforget nothing!  He informed against me, and they set askaris* on my\ntrail who prevented me from making further search.  I had to sit idle\nin Usumbura or Ujiji, or else come away; and idleness ill suits my\nblood!  I came here, and Hassan followed me.  The Germans made a\nregular, salaried spy of him--the semi-Arab rat!  The one-tenth Arab,\nnine-tenths mud-rat!  Here he stays in Zanzibar and spies on Tippoo\nTib, on me, on the British government, and on every stranger who comes\nhere.  His information goes to the Germans.  I know, for I intercepted\nsome of it!  He writes it out in Arabic, and provided no woman goes\nthrough the folds of his clothes or feels under that silken belly-piece\nbe wears, the Germans get it.  But if a woman does, and she's a friend\nof mine, that's different!  Are you the lord, sir?\"\n\n------------------\n* Askari, native soldier.\n------------------\n\n\"What do you propose?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Help me find that ivory!\" said Coutlass. \"I have very little money\nleft, but I have guns, and courage!  I know where to look, and I am not\nafraid!  No German can scare me!  I am English-American-Greek!--better\nthan any hundred Germans!  Let us find the ivory, and share it!  Let us\nget it out through British territory, or the Congo, so that no German\nsausage can interfere with us or take away one tusk!  Gee-rusalem, how\nI hate the swine.  Let us put one over on them!  Let us get the ivory\nto Europe, and then flaunt the deed under their noses!  Let us send one\nlittle tip of a female tusk to the Kaiser for a souvenir--female in\nproof it is all illegitimate, illegal, outlawed!  Let us send him a\npiece of ivory and a letter telling him all about it, and what we think\nof him and his swine-officials!  His lieutenants and his captains!  Let\nus smuggle the ivory out through the Congo--it can be done!  It can be\ndone!  I, Georges Coutlass, will find the ivory, and find the way!\"\n\n\"No need to smuggle it out,\" said Fred.  \"The British government will\ngive us ten per cent., or so I understand, of the value of all of it we\nfind in British East.\"\n\nGeorges Coutlass threw back his head and roared with laughter, slapped\nhis thighs, held his sides--then coughed for two or three minutes, and\nspat blood.\n\n\"You are the lord, all right!\" he gasped as soon as he could get\nbreath.  \"No need to smuggle it!  Ha-ha!  May I be damned!  Ten per\ncent. they'll give us!   Ha-ha!  Generous!  By whip and wheel! they're\nlucky if we give them five per cent.!  I'd like to see any government\ntake away from Georges Coutlass ninety per cent. of anything without a\nfight!  No, gentlemen!  No, my Lord!  The Belgian Congo government is\ncorrupt.  Let us spend twenty-five per cent.--even thirty-forty-fifty\nper cent. of the value of it to bribe the Congo officials.  Hand over\nninety per cent. to the Germans or the British without a fight?--Never!\nNever while my name is Georges Coutlass!  I have fought too often!  I\nhave been robbed by governments too often!  This last time I will put\nit over all the governments, and be rich at last, and go home to Greece\nto live like a gentleman!  Believe me!\"\n\nHe patted himself on the breast, and if flashing eye and frothing lip\nwent for anything, then all the governments were as good as defeated\nalready.\n\n\"You are the lord, are you not?\" he demanded, looking straight at Fred.\n\n\"My name is Oakes,\" Fred answered.\n\n\"Oh, then you?  I beg pardon!\"  He looked at me with surprise that he\nmade no attempt to conceal.  Fred could pass for a king with that\npointed beard of his (provided he were behaving himself seemly at the\ntime) but for all my staid demeanor I have never been mistaken for any\nkind of personage.  I disillusioned Coutlass promptly.\n\n\"Then you are neither of you lords?\"\n\n\"Pish!  We're obviously ladies!\" answered Fred.\n\n\"Then you have fooled me?\"  The Greek rose to his feet.  \"You have\ndeceived me?  You have accepted my hospitality and confidence under\nfalse pretense?\"\n\nI think there would have been a fight, for Fred was never the man to\naccept brow-beating from chance-met strangers, and the Greek's fiery\neye was rolling in fine frenzy; but just at that moment Yerkes\nstrolled in, cheerful and brisk.\n\n\"Hullo, fellers!  This is some thirsty burg.  Do they sell soft drinks\nin this joint?\" he inquired.\n\n\"By Brooklyn Bridge!\" exclaimed Coutlass. \"An American!  I, too, am an\nAmerican!  Fellow-citizen, these men have treated me badly!  They have\ntricked me!\"\n\n\"You must be dead easy!\" said Yerkes genially.  \"If those two wanted to\nlive at the con game, they'd have to practise on the junior\nkindergarten grades.  They're the mildest men I know.  I let that one\nwith the beard hold my shirt and pants when I go swimming!  Tricked\nyou, have they?  Say--have you got any money left?\"\n\n\"Oh, have a drink!\" laughed the Greek.  \"Have one on me!  It's good to\nhear you talk!\"\n\n\"What have my friends done to you?\" asked Yerkes.\n\n\"I was looking for a lord.  They pretended to be lords.\"\n\n\"What?  Both of 'em?\"\n\n\"No, it is one lord I am looking for.\"\n\n\"One lord, one faith, one baptism!\" said Yerkes profanely.\n\"And you found two?  What's your worry?  I'll pretend to be a third if\nthat'll help you any!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Greek, rising to his full height and letting his\nrage begin to gather again, \"you play with me.  That is not well!  You\nwaste my time.  That is not wise!  I come in all innocence, looking for\na certain lord--a real genuine lord--the Earl of Montdidier and\nKirscrubbrightshaw--my God, what a name!\"\n\n\"I'm Mundidier,\" said a level voice, and the Greek faced about like a\nman attacked.  Monty had entered the barroom and stood listening with\ncalm amusement, that for some strange reason exasperated the Greek less\nthan our attitude had done, at least for the moment.  When the first\nflush of surprise had died he grinned and grew gallant.\n\n\"My own name is Georges Coutlass, my Lord!\"  He made a sweeping bow,\nalmost touching the floor with the brim of his cowboy hat, and then\ncrossing his breast with it.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Listen to me!\"\n\n\"Very well.  I can spare fifteen minutes.\"\n\nWe all took seats together in a far corner of the dingy room, where the\nSyrian barkeeper could not overhear us.\n\n\"My Lord, I am an Englishman!\" Coutlass began.  \"I am a God-fearing,\nlaw-abiding gentleman!  I know where to look for the ivory that the\nArab villain Tippoo Tib has buried!  I know how to smuggle it out of\nAfrica without paying a penny of duty--\"\n\n\"Did you say law-abiding?\" Monty asked.\n\n\"Surely!  Always!  I never break the law!  As for instance--in Greece,\nwhere I had the honor to be born, the law says no man shall carry a\nknife or wear one in his belt.  So, since I was a little boy I carry\nnone!  I have none in my hand--none at my belt.  I keep it here!\"\n\nHe stooped, raised his right trousers leg, and drew from his Wellington\nboot a two-edged, pointed thing almost long enough to merit the name of\nrapier.  He tossed it in the air, let it spin six or seven times end\nover end, caught it deftly by the point, and returned it to its\nhiding-place.\n\n\"I am a law-abiding man,\" he said, \"but where the law leaves off, I\nknow where to begin!  I am no fool!\"\n\nMonty made up his mind there and then that this man's game would not be\nworth the candle.\n\n\"No, Mr. Coutlass, I can't oblige you,\" he said.\n\nThe Greek half-arose and then sat down again.\n\n\"You can not find it without my assistance!\" he said, wrinkling his\nface for emphasis.\n\n\"I'm not looking for assistance,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Aha!  You play with words!  You are not--but you will!  I am no fool,\nmy Lord!  I understand!  Not for nothing did I make a friend again of\nthat pig Hassan!  Not for nothing have I waited all these months in\nthis stinking Zanzibar until a man should come in search of that ivory\nwhom I could trust!  Not for nothing did Juma, the lazaretto attendant\ntell Hassan you desired to see him!  You seek the ivory, but you wish\nto keep it all!  To share none of it with me!\"  He stood up, and made\nanother bow, much curter than his former one.  \"I am Georges Coutlass!\nMy courage is known!  No man can rob me and get away with it!\"\n\n\"My good man,\" drawled Monty, raising his eyebrows in the comfortless\nway he has when there seems need of facing an inferior antagonist.  (He\nhates to \"lord it\" as thoroughly as he loves to risk his neck.)  \"I\nwould not rob you if you owned the earth!  If you have valuable\ninformation I'll pay for it cheerfully after it's tested.\"\n\n\"Ah!  Now you talk!\"\n\n\"Observe--I said after it's tested!\"\n\n\"I don't think he knows anything,\" said Fred.  \"I think he guessed a\nlot, and wants to look, and can't afford to pay his own expenses.\nIsn't that it?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Coutlass.\n\n\"I can't talk Greek,\" said Fred. \"Shall I say it again in English?\"\n\n\"You may name any reasonable price,\" said Monty, \"for real information.\nPut it in writing.  When we're agreed on the price, put that in\nwriting too.  Then, if we find the information is even approximately\nright, why, we'll pay for it.\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h!  You intend to play a trick on me!  You use my information!\nYou find the ivory!  You go out by the Congo River and the other coast,\nand I kiss myself good-by to you and ivory and money!  I am to be what\nd'you call it?--a milk-pigeon!\"\n\n\"Being that must be some sensation!\" nodded Yerkes.\n\n\"I warn you I can not be tampered with!\" snarled the Greek, putting on\nhis hat with a flourish.  \"I leave you, for you to think it over!  But\nI tell you this--I promise you--I swear!  Any expedition in search of\nthat ivory that does not include Georges Coutlass on his own terms is a\ndelusion--a busted flush--smashed--exploded--pfff!--so--evanesced\nbefore the start!  My address is Zanzibar!  Every street child knows\nme!  When you wish to know my terms, tell the first man or child you\nmeet to lead you to the house where Georges Coutlass lives!  Good\nmorning, Lord Skirtsshubrish!  We will no doubt meet again!\"\n\nHe turned his back on us and strode from the room--a man out of the\nmiddle ages, soldierly of bearing, unquestionably bold, and not one bit\nmore venial or lawless than ninety per cent. of history's gallants, if\nthe truth were told.\n\n\"Let's hope that's the last of him!\" said Monty.  \"Can't say I like\nhim, but I'd hate to have to spoil his chances.\"\n\n\"Last of him be sugared!\" said Yerkes.  \"That's only the first of him!\nHe'll find seven devils worse than himself and camp on our trail, if I\nknow anything of Greeks--that's to say, if our trail leads after that\nivory.  Does it?\"\n\n\"Depends,\" said Monty.  \"Let's talk upstairs.  That Syrian has long\nears.\"\n\nSo we trooped to Monty's room, where the very cobwebs reeked of Arab\nhistory and lawless plans.  He sat on the black iron bed, and we\ngrouped ourselves about on chairs that had very likely covered the\nknown world between them.  One was obviously jetsam from a steamship;\none was a Chinese thing, carved with staggering dragons; the other was\nmade of iron-hard wood that Yerkes swore came from South America.\n\n\"Shoot when you're ready!\" grinned Yerkes.\n\nI was too excited to sit still.  So was Fred.\n\n\"Get a move on, Didums, for God's sake!\" he growled.\n\n\"Well,\" said Monty, \"there seems something in this ivory business.  Our\nchance ought to be as good as anybody's.  But there are one or two\nstiff hurdles.  In the first place, the story is common property.\nEvery one knows it--Arabs--Swahili--Greeks--Germans--English.  To be\nsuspected of looking for it would spell failure, for the simple reason\nthat every adventurer on the coast would trail us, and if we did find\nit we shouldn't be able to keep the secret for five minutes.  If we\nfound it anywhere except on British territory it 'ud be taken away from\nus before we'd time to turn round.  And it isn't buried on British\nterritory!  I've found out that much.\"\n\n\"Good God, Didums!  D'you mean you know where the stuff is?\"\n\nFred sat forward like a man at a play.\n\n\"I know where it isn't,\" said Monty.  \"They told me at the Residency\nthat in all human probability it's buried part in German East, and by\nfar the greater part in the Congo.\"\n\n\"Then that ten per cent. offer by the British is a bluff?\" asked Yerkes.\n\n\"Out of date,\" said Monty.  \"The other governments offer nothing.  The\nGerman government might make terms with a German or a Greek--not with\nan Englishman.  The Congo government is an unknown quantity, but would\nprobably see reason if approached the proper way.\"\n\n\"The U. S. Consul tells me,\" said Yerkes, \"that the Congo government is\nthe rottenest aggregate of cutthroats, horse-thieves, thugs, yeggs,\ncommon-or-ordinary hold-ups, and sleight-of-hand professors that the\nworld ever saw in one God-forsaken country.  He says they're of every\nnationality, but without squeam of any kind--hang or shoot you as soon\nas look at you!  He says if there's any ivory buried in those parts\nthey've either got it and sold it, or else they buried it themselves\nand spread the story for a trap to fetch greenhorns over the border!\"\n\n\"That man's after the stuff himself!\" said Fred.  \"All he wanted to do\nwas stall you off!\"\n\n\"That man Schillingschen the doctor told us about,\" said Monty, \"is\nsuspected of knowing where to look for some of the Congo hoard.  He'll\nbear watching.  He's in British East Africa at present--said to be\ncombing Nairobi and other places for a certain native.  He is known to\nstand high in the favor of the German government, but poses as a\nprofessor of ethnology.\"\n\n\"He shall study deathnology,\" said Fred, \"if he gets in my way!\"\n\n\"The Congo people,\" said Monty, \"would have dug up the stuff, of\ncourse, if they'd known where to look for it.  Our people believe that\nthe Germans do know whereabouts to look for it, but dread putting the\nCongo crowd on the scent.  If we're after it we've got to do two things\nbesides agreeing between ourselves.\"\n\n\"Deal me in, Monty!\" said Yerkes.\n\n\"Nil desperandum, Didums duce, then!\" said Fred.  \"I propose Monty for\nleader.  Those against the motion take their shirts off, and see if\nthey can lick me!  Nobody pugnacious?  The ayes have it!  Talk along,\nDidums!\"\n\nFor all Fred's playfulness, Yerkes and I came in of our free and\nconsidered will, and Monty understood that.\n\n\"We've got to separate,\" he said, \"and I've got to interview the King\nof Belgium.\"\n\n\"If that were my job,\" grinned Yerkes, \"I'd prob'ly tell him things!\"\n\n\"I don't pretend to like him,\" said Monty. \"But it seems to me I can\nserve our best interests by going to Brussels.  He can't very well\nrefuse me a private audience.  I should get a contract with the Congo\ngovernment satisfactory to all concerned.  He's rapacious--but I think\nnot ninety per cent. rapacious.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said I, \"but why separate?\"\n\n\"If we traveled toward the Congo from this place in a bunch,\" said\nMonty, \"we should give the game away completely and have all the\nrag-tag and bob-tail on our heels.  As it is, our only chance of\nshaking all of them would be to go round by sea and enter the Congo\nfrom the other side; but that would destroy our chance of picking up\nthe trail in German East Africa.  So I'll go to Brussels, and get back\nto British East as fast as possible.  Fred must go to British East and\nwatch Schillingschen.  You two fellows may as well go by way of British\nEast Africa to Muanza on Victoria Nyanza, and on from there to the\nCongo border by way of Ujiji.  Yerkes is an American, and they'll\nsuspect him less than any of us (they'd nail me, of course, in a\nminute!)  So let Yerkes make a great show of looking for land to settle\non.  We'll all four meet on the Congo border, at some other place to be\ndecided later.  We'll have to agree on a code, and keep in touch by\ntelegraph as often as possible.  Now, is all that clear?\"\n\n\"We two'll have all the Greeks of Zanzibar trailing us all the way!\"\nobjected Yerkes.\n\n\"That'll be better than having them trail the lot of us,\" said Monty.\n\"You'll be able to shake them somewhere on the way.  We'll count on\nyour ingenuity, Will.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do to Schillingschen?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Keep an eye on him.\"\n\n\"Do you see me Sherlock-Holmesing him across the high veld? Piffle!\nGive America that job!  I'll go through German East and keep ahead of\nthe Greeks!\"\n\nBut Monty was firm.  \"Yerkes has a plausible excuse, Fred.  They may\nwonder why an American should look for land in German East Africa, but\nthey'll let him do it, and perhaps not spy on him to any extent.  It's\nme they've their eye on.  I'll try to keep 'em dazzled.  You go to\nBritish East and dazzle Schillingschen! Now, are we agreed?\"\n\nWe were.  But we talked, nevertheless, long into the afternoon, and in\nthe end there was not one of us really satisfied.  Over and over we\ntried to persuade Monty to omit the Brussels part of the plan.  We\nwanted him with us.  But he stuck to his point, and had his way, as he\nalways did when we were quite sure he really wanted it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\nTHE NJO HAPA SONG\n\n  Gleam, oh brighter than jewels! gleam my swinging stars in\n        the opal dark,\n  Mirrored along wi' the fire-fly dance of 'longshore light and\n        off-shore mark,\n  The roof-lamps and the riding lights, and phosphor wake of\n        ship and shark.\n\n        I was old when the fires of Arab ships\n        (All seas were lawless then!)\n        Abode the tide where liners ride\n        To-day, and Malays then,--\n        Old when the bold da Gama came\n        With culverin and creed\n        To trade where Solomon's men fought,\n        And plunder where the banyans bought,\n        I sighed when the first o' the slaves were brought,\n        And laughed when the last were freed.\n\n  Deep, oh deeper than anchors drop, the bones o' the outbound\n        sailors lie,\n  Far, oh farther than breath o' wind the rumors o' fabled\n        fortune fly,\n  And the 'venturers yearn from the ends of earth, for none o'\n        the isles is as fair as I!\n\n\nThe enormous map of Africa loses no lure or mystery from the fact of\nnearness to the continent itself.  Rather it increases.  In the hot\nupper room that night, between the wreathing smoke of oil lamps, we\npored over the large scale map Monty had saved from the wreck along\nwith our money drafts and papers.\n\nThe atmosphere was one of bygone piracy.  The great black ceiling\nbeams, heavy-legged table of two-inch planks, floor laid like a dhow's\ndeck--making utmost use of odd lengths of timber, but strong enough to\nstand up under hurricanes and overloads of plunder, or to batten down\nrebellious slaves--murmurings from rooms below, where men of every race\nthat haunts those shark-infested seas were drinking and telling tales\nthat would make Munchhausen's reputation--steaminess, outer darkness,\nspicy equatorial smells and, above all, knowledge of the nature of the\ncoming quest united to veil the map in fascination.\n\nNo man gifted with imagination better than a hot-cross bun's could be\nin Zanzibar and not be conscious of the lure that made adventurers of\nmen before the first tales were written.  Old King Solomon's traders\nmust have made it their headquarters, just as it was Sindbad the\nSailor's rendezvous and that of pirates before he or Solomon were born\nor thought of.  Vasco da Gama, stout Portuguese gentleman adventurer,\nconquered it, and no doubt looted the godowns to a lively tune.  Wave\nafter wave of Arabs sailed to it (as they do today) from that other\nland of mystery, Arabia; and there isn't a yard of coral beach,\ncocoanut-fringed shore, clove orchard, or vanilla patch--not a lemon\ntree nor a thousand-year-old baobab but could tell of battle and\nintrigue; not a creek where the dhows lie peacefully today but could\nwhisper of cargoes run by night--black cargoes, groaning fretfully and\nsmelling of the 'tween-deck lawlessness.\n\n\"There are two things that have stuck in my memory that Lord Salisbury\nused to say when I was an Eton boy, spending a holiday at Hatfield\nHouse,\" said Monty.  \"One was, Never talk fight unless you mean fight;\nthen fight, don't talk.  The other was, Always study the largest maps.\"\n\n\"Who's talking fight?\" demanded Fred.\n\nMonty ignored him.  \"Even this map isn't big enough to give a real idea\nof distances, but it helps.  You see, there's no railway beyond\nVictoria Nyanza.  Anything at all might happen in those great spaces\nbeyond Uganda.  Borderlands are quarrel-grounds.  I should say the\njunction of British, Belgian, and German territory where Arab loot lies\nburied is the last place to dally in unarmed.  You fellows 'ud better\nscour Zanzibar in the morning for the best guns to be had here.\"\n\nSo I went to bed at midnight with that added stuff for building dreams.\nHe who has bought guns remembers with a thrill; he who has not, has\nin store for him the most delightful hours of life.  May he fall, as\nour lot was, on a gunsmith who has mended hammerlocks for Arabs, and\nwho loves rifles as some greater rascals love a woman or a horse.\n\nWe all four strolled next morning, clad in the khaki reachmedowns that\na Goanese \"universal provider\" told us were the \"latest thing,\" into a\nden between a camel stable and an even mustier-smelling home of gloom,\nwhere oxen tied nose-to-tail went round and round, grinding out semsem\neverlastingly while a lean Swahili sang to them.  When he ceased, they\nstopped.  When he sang, they all began again.\n\nIn a bottle-shaped room at the end of a passage squeezed between those\ntwo centers of commerce sat the owner of the gun-store, part Arab, part\nItalian, part Englishman, apparently older than sin itself, toothless,\nexcept for one yellow fang that lay like an ornament over his lower\nlip, and able to smile more winningly than any siren of the sidewalk.\nEvidently he shaved at intervals, for white stubble stood out a third\nof an inch all over his wrinkled face.  The upper part of his head was\nutterly bald, slippery, shiny, smooth, and adorned by an absurd, round\nIndian cap, too small, that would not stay in place and had to be\nhitched at intervals.\n\nHe said his name was Captain Thomas Cook, and the license to sell\nfirearms framed on the mud-brick wall bore him witness.  (May he live\nforever under any name he chooses!)\n\n\"Goons?\" he said. \"Goons?  You gentlemen want goons?  I have the goon\nwhat settled the hash of Sayed bin Mohammed--here it be.  This other\none's the rifle--see the nicks on her butt!--that Kamarajes the Greek\nused.  See 'em--Arab goons--slaver goons--smooth-bore elephant\ngoons--fours, eights, twelves--Martinis--them's the lot that was\nreekin' red-hot, days on end, in the last Arab war on the Congo,\nconsiderable used up but goin' cheap;--then here's Mausers (he\npronounced it \"Morsers\")--old-style, same as used in 1870--good goons\nthey be, long o' barrel and strong, but too high trajectory for some\nfolks;--some's new style, magazines an' all--fine till a grain o' sand\njams 'em oop;--an' Lee-Enfields, souvenirs o' the Boer War, some o'\nthem bought from folks what plundered a battle-field or two--mostly all\nin good condition.  Look at this one--see it--hold it--take a squint\nalong it!  Nineteen elephants shot wi' that Lee-Enfield, an' the man's\nin jail for shootin' of 'em!  Sold at auction by the gov'ment, that one\nwas.  See, here's an Express--a beauty--owned by an officer fr'm\nIndy--took by a shark 'e was, in swimmin' against all advice, him what\nhad hunted tigers!  There's no goon store a quarter as good as mine\n'tween Cairo an' the Cape or Bombay an-' Boma!  Captain Cook's the boy\nto sell ye goons all right!  Sit down.  Look 'em over.  Ask anything ye\nwant to know.  I'll tell ye.  No obligation to buy.\"\n\nThere is no need to fit out with guns and tents in London.  Until both\ngood and bad, both cowardly and brave give up the habit of dying in\nbed, or getting killed, or going broke, or ending up in jail for one\ncause and the other, there will surely always be fine pickings for men\non the spot with a little money and a lot of patience--guns, tents,\ncooking pots, and all the other things.\n\nWe spent a morning with Captain Thomas Cook, and left the store--Fred,\nYerkes and I--with a battery of weapons, including a pistol\napiece--that any expedition might be proud of.  (Monty, since he had to\ngo home in any case, preferred to look over the family gun-room before\ncommitting himself.)\n\nThen, since the first leg of the journey would be the same for all of\nus we bought other kit, packed it, and booked passages for British East\nAfrica.  Between then and the next afternoon when the British India\nsteamboat sailed we were fairly bombarded by inquisitiveness, but\ncontrived not to tell much.  And with patience beyond belief Monty\nrestrained us from paying court to Tippoo Tib.\n\n\"The U. S. Consul says he's better worth a visit than most of the\nworld's museums,\" Yerkes assured us two or three times.  \"He says\nTippoo Tib's a fine old sport--damned rogue--slave-hunter, but white\nsomewhere near the middle.  What's the harm in our having a chin with\nhim?\"\n\nBut Monty was adamant.\n\n\"A call on him would prove nothing, but he and his friends would\nsuspect.  Spies would inform the German government.  No.  Let's act as\nif Tippoo Tib were out of mind.\"\n\nWe grumbled, but we yielded.  Hassan came again, shiny with sweat and\nvoluble with offers of information and assistance.\n\n\"Where you gentlemen going?\" he kept asking.\n\n\"England,\" said Monty, and showed his own steamer ticket in proof of\nit.\n\nThat settled Hassan for the time but Georges Coutlass was not so easy.\nHe came swaggering upstairs and thumped on Monty's door with the air of\na bearer of king's messages.\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\" he asked.  (We were all sitting on Monty's\nbed, and it was Yerkes who opened the door.)\n\n\"Do you an injury,\" said Yerkes, \"unless you take your foot away!\"  The\nGreek had placed it deftly to keep the door open pending his\nconvenience.\n\n\"Let him have his say\" advised Monty from the bed.\n\n\"Where are you going?  Hassan told me England.  Are you all going to\nEngland?  If so, why have you bought guns?  What will you do with six\nrifles, three shot-guns, and three pistols on the London streets?  What\nwill you do with tents in London?  Will you make campfires in Regent\nCircus, that you take with you all those cooking pots?  And all that\nrice, is that for the English to eat?  Bah!  No tenderfoot can fool me!\nYou go to find my ivory, d'you hear!  You think to get away with it\nunknown to me!  I tell you I have sharp ears!  By Jingo; there is\nnothing I can not find out that goes on in Africa!  You think to cheat\nme?  Then you are as good as dead men!  You shall die like dogs!  I\nwill smithereen the whole damned lot of you before you touch a tusk!\"\n\n\"Get out of here!\" growled Yerkes.\n\n\"Give him a chance to go quietly, Will,\" urged Monty, and Coutlass\nheard him.  Peaceful advice seemed the last spark needed to explode his\ncrowded magazines of fury.  He clenched his fists--spat because the\nwords would not flow fast enough--and screamed.\n\n\"Give me a chance, eh?  A chance, eh?\"  Other doors began opening, and\nthe appearance of an audience stimulated him to further peaks of rage.\n\"The only chance I need is a sight of your carcasses within range, and\na long range will do for Georges Coutlass!\"  He glared past Yerkes at\nMonty who had risen leisurely.  \"You call yourself a lord?  I call you\na thief!  A jackal!\"\n\n\"Here, get out!\" growled Yerkes, self-constituted Cerberus.\n\n\"I will go when I damned please, you Yankee jackanapes!\" the Greek\nretorted through set teeth.  Yerkes is a free man, able and willing to\nshoulder his own end of any argument.  He closed, and the Greek's ribs\ncracked under a vastly stronger hug than he had dreamed of expecting.\nBut Coutlass was no weakling either, and though he gasped he gathered\nhimself for a terrific effort.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Monty, and went past me through the door like a bolt\nfrom a catapult.  Fred followed me, and when he saw us both out on the\nlanding Monty started down the stairs.\n\n\"Come on!\" he called again.\n\nWe followed, for there is no use in choosing a leader if you don't\nintend to obey him, even on occasions when you fail at once to\nunderstand.  There was one turn on the wide stairs, and Monty stood\nthere, back to the wall.\n\n\"Go below, you fellows, and catch!\" he laughed.  \"We don't want Will\njailed for homicide!\"\n\nThe struggle was fierce and swift.  Coutlass searched with a thumb for\nWill's eye, and stamped on his instep with an iron-shod heel.  But he\nwas a dissolute brute, and for all his strength Yerkes' cleaner living\nvery soon told.  Presently Will spared a hand to wrench at the\nambitious thumb, and Coutlass screamed with agony.  Then he began to\nsway this way and that without volition of his own, yielding his\nbalance, and losing it again and again.  In another minute Yerkes had\nhim off his feet, cursing and kicking.\n\n\"Steady, Will!\" called Monty from below; but it was altogether too\nlate for advice.  Will gathered himself like a spring, and hurled the\nGreek downstairs backward.\n\nThen the point of Monty's strategy appeared. He caught him, saved him\nfrom being stunned against the wall, and, before the Greek could\nrecover sufficiently to use heels and teeth or whisk out the knife he\nkept groping for, hurled him a stage farther on his journey--face\nforward this time down to where Fred and I were waiting.  We kicked him\nout into the street too dazed to do anything but wander home.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Will?\" laughed Monty.  \"This isn't the States, you know;\nby gad, they'll jail you here if you do your own police work!  Instead\nof Brussels I'd have had to stay and hire lawyers to defend you!\"\n\n\"Aw--quit preaching!\" Yerkes answered.  \"If I hadn't seen you there on\nthe stairs with your mouth open I'd have been satisfied to put him down\nand spank him!\"\n\nIt was then that the much more unexpected struck us speechless--even\nMonty for the moment, who is not much given to social indecision.  We\nhad not known there was a woman guest in that hotel.  One does not look\nin Zanzibar for ladies with a Mayfair accent unaccompanied by menfolk\nable to protect them.  Yet an indubitable Englishwoman, expensively if\ncarelessly dressed, came to the head of the stairs and stood beside\nYerkes looking down at the rest of us with a sort of well bred, rather\ntolerant scorn.\n\n\"Am I right in believing this is Lord Montdidier?\" she asked,\npronouncing the word as it should be--Mundidger.\n\nShe had been very beautiful.  She still was handsome in a hard-lipped,\nbold way, with abundant raven hair and a complexion that would have\nbeen no worse for a touch of rouge.  She seemed to scorn all the\nconventional refinements, though.  Her lacy white dress, open at the\nneck, was creased and not too clean, but she wore in her bosom one\ngreat jewel like a ruby, set in brilliants, that gave the lie to\npoverty provided the gems were real.  And the amber tube through which\nshe smoked a cigarette was seven or eight inches long and had diamonds\nset in a gold band round its middle.  She wore no wedding ring that I\ncould see; and she took no more notice of Will Yerkes beside her than\nif he had been a part of the furniture.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" asked Monty, starting upstairs.  She had to make way\nfor him, for Will Yerkes stood his ground.\n\n\"A fair question!\" she laughed.  Her voice had a hard ring, but was\nvery well trained and under absolute control.  I received the\nimpression that she had been a singer at some time.  \"I am Lady Saffren\nWaldon--Isobel Saffren Waldon.\"\n\nFred and I had followed Monty up and were close behind him.  I heard\nhim mutter, \"Oh, lord!\" under his breath.\n\n\"I knew your brother,\" she added.\n\n\"I know you did.\"\n\n\"You think that gives me no claim on your acquaintance?  Perhaps it\ndoesn't.  But as an unprotected woman--\"\n\n\"There is the Residency,\" objected Monty, \"and the law.\"\n\nShe laughed bitterly.  \"Thank you, I am in need of no passage home!  I\noverheard that ruffian say, and I think I heard you say too that you\nare going to England.  I want you to take a message for me.\"\n\n\"There is a post-office here,\" said Monty without turning a hair.  He\nlooked straight into her iron eyes.  \"There is a cable station.  I will\nlend you money to cable with.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Lord!\" she sneered.  \"I have money.  I am so used to\nbeing snubbed that my skin would not feel a whip!  I want you to take a\nverbal message!\"\n\nIt was perfectly evident that Monty would rather have met the devil in\nperson than this untidy dame; yet he was only afraid apparently of\nconceding her too much claim on his attention.  (If she had asked\nfavors of me I don't doubt I would have scrambled to be useful.  I\nbegan mentally taking her part, wondering why Monty should treat her so\ncavalierly; and I fancy Yerkes did the same.)\n\n\"Tell me the message, and I'll tell you whether I'll take it,\" said\nMonty.\n\nShe laughed again, even more bitterly.\n\n\"If I could tell it on these stairs,\" she answered, \"I could cable it.\nThey censor cablegrams, and open letters in this place.\"\n\n\"I suspect that isn't true,\" said Monty.  \"But if you object to\nwitnesses, how do you propose to deliver your message to me?\" he asked\npointedly.\n\n\"You mean you refuse to speak with me alone?\"\n\n\"My friends would draw out of earshot,\" he answered.\n\n\"Your friends?  Your gang, you mean!\"  She drew herself up very\nfinely--very stately.  Very lovely she was to look at in that\nhalf-light, with the shadows of Tippoo Tib's* old stairway hiding her\ntale of years.  But I felt my regard for her slipping downhill (and so,\nI rather think did Yerkes).  \"You look well, Lord Montdidier, trapesing\nabout the earth with a leash of mongrels at your heel!  Falstaff never\npicked up a more sordid-looking pack!  What do you feed them--bones?\nAre there no young bloods left of your own class, that you need travel\nwith tradesmen?\"\n\n-------------\n* The principal hotel In Zanzibar was formerly Tippoo Tib's residence,\nquite a magnificent mansion for that period and place.\n-------------\n\nMonty stood with both hands behind him and never turned a hair.  Fred\nOakes brushed up the ends of that troubadour mustache of his and struck\nmore or less of an attitude.  Will reddened to the ears, and I never\nfelt more uncomfortable in all my life.\n\n\"So this is your gang, is it?\" she went on.  \"It looks sober at\npresent!  I suppose I must trust you to control them!  I dare say even\ntavern brawlers respect you sufficiently to keep a lady's secret if you\norder them.  I will hope they have manhood enough to hold their\ntongues!\"\n\nOf course, dressed in the best that Zanzibar stores had to offer we\nscarcely looked like fashion plates.  My shirt was torn where Coutlass\nhad seized it to resist being thrown out, but I failed to see what she\nhoped to gain by that tongue lashing, even supposing we had been the\nlackeys she pretended to believe we were.\n\n\"The message is to my brother,\" she went on.\n\n\"I don't know him!\" put in Monty promptly.\n\n\"You mean you don't like him!  Your brother had him expelled from two\nor three clubs, and you prefer not to meet him!  Nevertheless, I give\nyou this message to take to him!  Please tell him--you will find him at\nhis old address--that I, his sister, Lady Saffren Waldon, know now the\nsecret of Tippoo Tib's ivory.  He is to join me here at once, and we\nwill get it, and sell it, and have money, and revenge!  Will you tell\nhim that!\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Monty.\n\nI looked at Yerkes, Yerkes looked at Fred, and Fred at me.\n\nThere was nothing to do but feel astonished.\n\n\"Why not, if you please?\"\n\n\"I prefer not to meet Captain McCauley,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Then you will give the message to somebody else?\" she insisted.\n\n\"No\" said Monty. \"I will carry no message for you.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?  How dare you say that?  In front of your\nfollowing--your gang!\"\n\nI should have been inclined to continue the argument myself--to try to\nfind out what she did know, and to uncover her game.  It was obvious\nshe must have some reason for her extraordinary request, and her more\nextraordinary way of making it.  But Monty saw fit to stride past her\nthrough his open bedroom door, and shut it behind him firmly.  We stood\nlooking at her and at one another stupidly until she turned her back\nand went to her own room on the floor above.  Then we followed Monty.\n\n\"Did she say anything else?\" he asked as soon as we were inside.  I\nnoticed he was sweating pretty freely now.\n\n\"Didums, you're too polite!\" Fred answered.  \"You ought to have told\nher to keep her tongue housed or be civil!\"\n\n\"I don't hold with hitting back at a lone woman,\" said Yerkes, \"but\nwhat was she driving at?  What did she mean by calling us a pack of\nmongrels?\"\n\n\"Merely her way,\" said Monty offhandedly.  \"Those particular McCauleys\nnever amounted to much.  She married a baronet, and he divorced her.\nBad scandal.  Saffren Waldon was at the War Office.  She stole papers,\nor something of that sort--delivered them to a German paramour--von\nDuvitz was his name, I think.  She and her brother were lucky to keep\nout of jail.  Ever since then she has been--some say a spy, some say\none thing, some another.  My brother fell foul of her, and lived to\nregret it.  She's on her last legs I don't doubt, or she wouldn't be in\nZanzibar.\"\n\n\"Then why the obvious nervous sweat you're in?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"And that doesn't account for the abuse she handed out to us,\" said\nYerkes.\n\n\"Why not tip off the authorities that she's a notorious spy?\" I asked.\n\n\"I suspect they know all about her,\" he answered.\n\n\"But why your alarm?\" insisted Fred.\n\n\"I'm scarcely alarmed, old thing.  But it's pretty obvious, isn't it,\nthat she wants us to believe she knows what we're after.  She's\nvindictive.  She imagines she owes me a grudge on my brother's account.\nIt might soothe her to think she had made me nervous.  And by gad--it\nsounds like lunacy, and mind you I'm not propounding it for\nfact!--there's just one chance that she really does know where the\nivory is!\"\n\n\"But where's the sense of abusing us?\" repeated Yerkes.\n\n\"That's the poor thing's way of claiming class superiority,\" said\nMonty. \"She was born into one class, married into another, and divorced\ninto a third.  She'd likely to forget she said an unkind word the next\ntime she meets you.  Give her one chance and she'll pretend she\nbelieves you were born to the purple--flatter you until you half\nbelieve it yourself.  Later on, when it suits her at the moment, she'll\ndenounce you as a social impostor!  It's just habit--bad habit, I\nadmit--comes of the life she leads.  Lots of 'em like her.  Few of 'em\nquite so well informed, though, and dangerous if you give 'em a chance.\"\n\n\"I still don't see why you're sweating,\" said Fred.\n\n\"It's hot.  There's a chance she knows where the ivory is!  She has\nmoney, but how?  She'd have begged if she were short of cash!  It's my\nimpression she has been in German government employ for a number of\nyears.  Possibly they have paid her to do some spy-work--in the\nZanzibar court, perhaps--the Sultan's a mere boy--\"\n\n\"Isn't he woolly-headed?\" objected Yerkes.\n\n\"Mainly Arab.  It's a French game to send a white woman to intrigue at\ncolored courts, but the Germans are good imitators.\"\n\n\"Isn't she English?\" asked Yerkes.\n\n\"Her trade's international,\" said Monty dryly. \"My guess is that\nCoutlass or Hassan told her what we're supposed to be doing here, and\nshe pretends to know where the ivory is in order to trap us all in some\nway.  The net's spread for me, but there's no objection to catching you\nfellows as well.\"\n\n\"She'll need to use sweeter bait than I've seen yet!\" laughed Yerkes.\n\n\"She'll probably be sweetness itself next time she sees you.  She'll\nargue she's created an impression and can afford to be gracious.\"\n\n\"Impression is good!\" said Yerkes. \"I mean it's bad!  She has created\none, all right!  What's the likelihood of her having double-crossed the\nGermans?  Mightn't she have got a clue to where the stuff is, and be\nholding for a better market than they offer?\"\n\n\"I was coming to that,\" said Monty.  \"Yes, it's possible.  But whatever\nher game is, don't let us play it for her.  Let her do the leading.  If\nshe gets hold of you fellows, one at a time or all together, for the\nlove of heaven tell her nothing!  Let her tell all she likes, but admit\nnothing--tell nothing--ask no questions!  That's an old rule in\ndiplomacy (and remember, she's a diplomat, whatever else she may be!)\nOld-stagers can divine the Young ones' secrets from the nature of the\nquestions they ask!  So if you got the chance, ask her nothing!  Don't\nlie, either!  It would take a very old hand to lie to her in such way\nthat she couldn't see through it!\"\n\n\"Why not be simply rude and turn our backs?\" said I.\n\n\"Best of all--provided you can do it!  Remember, she's an old hand!\"\n\n\"D'you mean,\" said Yerkes, \"that if she were to offer proof that she\nknows where that ivory is, and proposed terms, you wouldn't talk it\nover?\"\n\n\"I mean let her alone!\" said Monty.\n\nBut it turned out she would not be let alone.  We dine in the public\nroom, but she had her meals sent up to her and we flattered ourselves\n(or I did) that her net had been laid in vain. Folk dine late in the\ntropics, and we dallied over coffee and cigars, so that it was going on\nfor ten o'clock when Yerkes and I started upstairs again.  Monty and\nFred went out to see the waterfront by moonlight.\n\nWe had reached our door (he and I shared one great room) when we heard\nterrific screams from the floor above--a woman's--one after another,\npiercing, fearful, hair-raising, and so suggestive in that gloomy, grim\nbuilding that a man's very blood stood still.\n\nYerkes was the first upstairs.  He went like an arrow from a bow, and I\nafter him.  The screams had stopped before we reached the stairhead,\nbut there was no doubting which her room was; the door was partly\nopen, permitting a view of armchairs and feminine garments in some\ndisorder.  We heard a man talking loud quick Arabic, and a\nwoman--pleading, I thought.  Yerkes rapped on the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" said a voice, and I followed Yerkes in.\n\nWe were met by her Syrian maid, a creature with gazelle eyes and timid\nmanner, who came through the doorway leading to an inner room.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" demanded Yerkes, and the woman signed to us to go\non in.  Yerkes led the way again impulsively as any knight-errant\nrescuing beleaguered dames, but I looked back and saw that the Syrian\nwoman had locked the outer door.  Before I could tell Will that, he was\nin the next room, so I followed, and, like him, stood rather bewildered.\n\nLady Saffren Waldon sat facing us, rather triumphant, in no apparent\ntrouble, not alone.  There were four very well-dressed Arabs standing\nto one side.  She sat in a basket chair by a door that pretty obviously\nled into her bedroom; and kept one foot on a pillow, although I\nsuspected there was not much the matter with it.\n\n\"We heard screams.  Thought you were being murdered!\" said Yerkes, out\nof breath.\n\n\"Oh, indeed, no!  Nothing of the kind!  I fell and twisted my\nankle--very painful, but not serious.  Since you are here, sit down,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said he, turning to go.\n\n\"The maid locked the door on us!\" said I, and before the words were out\nof my mouth three of the Arabs slipped into the outer room.  There was\nno hint or display of weapons of any kind, but they were big men, and\nthe folds of their garments were sufficiently voluminous to have hidden\na dozen guns apiece.\n\n\"She'll open it!\" said Will, with inflection that a fool could\nunderstand.\n\n\"One minute, please!\" said Lady Saffren Waldon.  (It was no poor\nimitation of Queen Elizabeth ordering courtiers about.)\n\n\"We didn't come to talk,\" said Will. \"Heard screams.  Made a mistake.\nSorry. We're off!\"\n\n\"No mistake!\" she said; and the sweetness Monty prophesied began to\nshow itself.  The change in her voice was too swift and pronounced to\nbe convincing.  \"I did scream.  I was, in pain.  It was kind of you to\ncome.  Since you are here I would like you to talk to this gentleman.\"\n\nShe glanced at the Arab, an able-looking man, with nose and eyes\nexpressive of keen thought, and the groomed gray beard that makes an\nArab always dignified.\n\n\"Some other time,\" said Will. \"I've an engagement!\"  And he turned to\ngo again.\n\n\"No--now!\" she said.  \"It's no use--you can't get out! You may as well\nbe sensible and listen!\"\n\nWe glanced at each other and both remembered Monty's warning.  Will\nlaughed.\n\n\"Take seats,\" she said, with a very regal gesture.  She was not\ncarelessly dressed, as she had been earlier in the day.  From hair to\nsilken hose and white kid shoes she was immaculate, and she wore rouge\nand powder now.  In that yellow lamplight (carefully placed, no doubt)\nshe was certainly good-looking.  In fact, she was good-looking at any\ntime, and only no longer able to face daylight with the tale of youth.\nHer eyes were weapons, nothing less.  We remained standing.\n\n\"This gentleman will speak to you,\" she said, motioning to the Arab to\ncommence, and he bowed--from the shoulders upward.\n\n\"I am from His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar\" he announced, a little\npompously.  \"A minister from His Highness.\"  (In announcing their own\nimportance Arabs very seldom err in the direction of under-estimate.)\n\"I speak about the ivory, which I am informed you propose to set out on\na journey to discover.\"\n\n\"Where did you get your information?\" Yerkes countered.\n\n\"Don't be absurd!\" ordered Lady Safrren Waldon.  \"I gave it to him!\nWhere else need he go to get it?\"\n\n\"Where did you get it, then?\" he retorted.\n\n\"Never mind!  Listen to what Hamed Ibrahim has to say!\"\n\nThe Arab bowed his head slightly a second time.\n\n\"The ivory you seek,\" he said, \"is said to be Tippoo Tib's own, and he\nwill not tell the hiding-places.  It does not belong to him.  Such\nlittle part of it as ever was his was long ago swallowed by the\ninterest on claims against him.  The whole is now in truth the property\nof His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, and whoever discovers it shall\nreceive reward from the owner.  His Highness is willing, through me his\nminister, to make treaty in advance in writing with suitable parties\nintending to make search.\"\n\n\"You mean the Sultan wants to hire me to hunt for ivory for him?\"  Will\nasked, and the Arab made a gesture of impatience.  At that Lady Saffren\nWaldon cut in, very vinegary once more.\n\n\"You two men are prisoners!  Show much more sense!  Come to terms or\ntake the consequences!  Listen!  Tippoo Tib buried the ivory.  The\nSultan of Zanzibar claims it.  The German government, for reasons of\nits own, backs the Sultan's claim; ivory found in German East Africa\nwill be handed over to him in support of his claim to all the rest of\nit.  If you--Lord Montdidier and the rest of you--care to sign an\nagreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar you can have facilities.  You\nshall be supplied with guides who can lead you to the right place to\nstart your search from--\"\n\n\"Thought you wanted Lord Montdidier to say in London that you know\nwhere it all is,\" Will objected.\n\nShe colored slightly, and glared.\n\n\"Perhaps I am one of the guides,\" she said darkly.  \"I know more than I\nneed tell for the sake of this argument!  The point is, you can have\nfacilities if you sign an agreement with the Sultan.  Otherwise, you\nwill be dogged wherever you go!  Whatever you should find would be\nclaimed!  Every difficulty will be made for you--every treachery\nconceivable practised on you.  Lord Montdidier can get influential\nbacking, but not influence among the natives!  He can not get good men\nand true information by pulling wires in London.  The British\ngovernment once offered ten per cent. of the value of the ivory found.\nThe Sultan of Zanzibar offers twenty per cent.--\"\n\n\"Twenty-five per cent.,\" corrected Hamed Ibrahim.\n\n\"Yes, but I should want five per cent. for my commission!\"\n\n\"This sounds like a different yarn to the one you told on the stairs\nthis afternoon,\" said Will. \"See Monty and tell it to him.\"\n\n\"It is for you to tell Lord Montdidier.  He runs away from me!\"\n\n\"I refuse to tell him a word!\" said Will, with a laugh like that of a\nboy about to plunge into a swimming pool--sort of \"Here goes!\"\n\n\"You are extremely ill advised!\"\n\n\"Do your worst!  Monty'll be hunting for us two in about a minute.\nWe're prisoners, are we?  Suit yourself!\"\n\n\"You are prisoners while I choose!  You could be killed in this room,\nremoved in sacks, thrown to the sharks in the roadstead, and nobody the\nwiser!  But I have no intention of killing you.  As it happens, that\nwould not suit my purpose!\"\n\nWe both glanced behind us involuntarily.  It may be that we both heard\na footstep, but it is always difficult to say certainly after the\nevent.  At any rate, while in the act of turning our heads, two of the\nthree Arabs, who had previously left the room, threw nooses over them\nand bound our arms to our sides with the jiffy-swiftness only sailors\nknow.  The third man put the finishing touches, and presently adjusted\ngags with a neatness and solicitude worthy of the Inquisition.\n\n\"Throw them!\" she ordered, and in a second our heels were struck from\nunder us and I was half stunned by the impact of my head against the\nsolid floor (for all the floors of that great place were built to\nresist eternity).\n\n\"Now!\" she said. \"Show them knives!\"\n\nWe were shown forthwith the ugliest, most suggestive weapons I have\never seen--long sliver-thin blades sharper than razors.  The Arabs\nknelt on our chests (their knees were harder and more merciless than\nwooden clubs) and laid the blades, edge-upward, on the skin of our\nthroats.\n\n\"Let them feel!\" she ordered.\n\nI felt a sharp cut, and the warm blood trickled down over my jugular to\nthe floor.  I knew it was only a skin-cut, but did not pretend to\nmyself I was enjoying the ordeal.\n\n\"Now!\" she said.\n\nThe Arabs stepped away and she came and stood between us, looking down\nat one and then the other.\n\n\"There isn't a place in Africa,\" she said, \"that you can hide in where\nthe Sultan's men can't find you!  There isn't a British officer in\nAfrica who would believe you if you told what has happened in this room\ntonight!  Yet Lord Montdidier will believe you--he knows you\npresumably, and certainly he knows me!  So tell Lord Montdidier exactly\nwhat has happened!  Assure him with my compliments that his throat and\nyours shall be cut as surely as you dare set out after that ivory\nwithout signing my agreement first.  Tell Lord Montdidier he may be\nfriends with me if he cares to.  As his friend I will help make him\nrich for life!  As his enemy, I will make Africa too hot and dangerous\nto hold him!  Let him choose!\"\n\nShe stepped back and, without troubling to turn away, put powder on her\nnose and chin.\n\n\"Now let them up!\" she said.\n\nThe Arabs lifted us to our feet.\n\n\"Loose them!\"\n\nThe expert of the three slipped the knots like a wizard doing parlor\ntricks; but I noticed that the other two held their knives extremely\ncautiously.  We should have been dead men if we had made a pugnacious\nmotion.\n\n\"Now you may go!  Unless Lord Montdidier agrees with me, the only\nsafety for any of you is away from Africa!  Go and tell him!  Go!\"\n\n\"I'll give you your answer now!\" said Will.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" said I, remembering Monty's urgent admonition to tell\nher nothing and ask no questions.  \"Come away, Will!  There's nothing\nto be gained by talking back!\"\n\n\"Right you are!\" he said, laughing like a boy again--this time like a\nboy whose fight has been broken off without his seeking or consent.\nLike me, he pulled out a handkerchief and wiped blood from his neck.\nThe sight of his own blood--even such a little trickle as that--has\npeculiar effect an a man.\n\n\"By Jiminy, she has scratched the wrong dog's ear!\" he growled to me as\nwe went to the door together.\n\n\"They're all in there!\" I said excitedly, when the door slammed shut\nbehind us.  \"Hurry down and get me a gun!  I'll hold the door while you\nrun for police and have 'em arrested!\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" he said.  \"Come on!  Three Sultan's witnesses and two lone\nwhite women against us two--come away!  Come away!\"\n\nMonty and Fred were still out, so we went to our own room.\n\n\"I'm wondering,\" I said, \"what Monty will say.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" said Will.  \"I'm not troubling, either!  I'm not going to\ntell Monty a blessed word!  See here--she thinks she knows where some\no' that ivory is.  Maybe the government of German East Africa is in on\nthe deal, and maybe not; that makes no present difference.  She thinks\nshe's wise.  And she has fixed up with the Sultan to have him claim it\nwhen found, so's she'll get a fat slice of the melon.  There's a scheme\non to get the stuff, when who should come on the scene but our little\nparty, and that makes 'em all nervous, 'cause Monty's a bad man to be\nup against.  Remember:  she claimed that she knows Monty and he knows\nher.  She means by that that he knows she's a desperado, and she thinks\nhe'll draw the line at a trip that promises murder and blackmail and\nsuch like dirty work.  So she puts a scare into us with a view to our\nthrowing a scare into him.  If I scare any one, it's going to be that\ndame herself.  I'll not tell Monty a thing!\"\n\n\"How about Coutlass the Greek?\" said I. \"D'you suppose he's her\naccomplice?\"\n\n\"Maybe!  One of her dupes perhaps!  I suspect she'll suck him dry of\ninformation and cast him off like a lemon rind.  I dare bet she's using\nhim.  She can't use me!  Shall you tell Monty?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said.  \"Not unless we both agreed.\"\n\nHe nodded.  \"You and I weren't born to what they call the purple.\nWe're no diplomatists; but we get each other's meaning.\"\n\n\"Here come Monty and Fred,\" said I.  \"Is my neck still bloody?  No,\nyours doesn't show.\"\n\nWe met them at the stairhead, and Monty did not seem to notice anything.\n\n\"Fred has composed a song to the moonlight on Zanzibar roadstead while\nyou fellows were merely after-dinner mundane.  D'you suppose the\nlandlord 'ud make trouble if we let him sing it?\"\n\n\"Let's hope so!\" said Will.  \"I'm itching for a row like they say\ndrovers in Monty's country itch for mile-stones!  Let Fred warble.\nI'll fight whoever comes!\"\n\nMonty eyed him and me swiftly, but made no comment.\n\n\"Bill's homesick!\" said Fred.  \"The U. S. eagle wants its Bowery!\nWe'll soothe the fowl with thoughts of other things--where's the\nconcertina?\"\n\n\"No, no, Fred, that'll be too much din!\"\n\nMonty made a grab for the instrument, but Fred raised it above his head\nand brought it down between his knees with chords that crashed like\nwedding bells.  Then he changed to softer, languorous music, and when\nhe had picked out an air to suit his mood, sat down and turned art\nloose to do her worst.\n\nHe has a good voice.  If he would only not pull such faces, or make so\nsure that folk within a dozen blocks can hear him, he might pass for a\nprofessional.\n\n\"Music suggestive of moonlight!\" he said, and began:\n\n        \"The sentry palms stand motionless. Masts move against the sky.\n        With measured creak of curving spars dhows gently to the\n                jeweled stars\n        Rock out a lullaby.\n\n        \"Silver and black sleeps Zanzibar. The moonlit ripples croon\n        Soft songs of loves that perfect are, long tales of\n                red-lipped spoils of war,\n        And you--you smile, you moon!\n        For I think that beam on the placid sea\n        That splashes, and spreads, and dips, and gleams,\n        That dances and glides till it comes to me\n        Out of infinite sky, is the path of dreams,\n        And down that lane the memories run\n        Of all that's wild beneath the sun!\"\n\n\"You fellows like that one?  Anybody coming?  Nobody for Will to fight\nyet?  Too bad!  Well--we'll try a-gain!  There's no chorus.  It's all\npoetic stuff, too gentle to be yowled by three such cannibals as you!\nListen!\n\n        \"Old as the moonlit silences, to-night's loves are the same\n        As when for ivory from far, and cloves and gems of Zanzibar\n        King Solomon's men came.\n\n        \"Sinful and still the same roofs lie that knew da Gama's heel,\n        Those beams that light these sleepy waves looked on when\n              men threw murdered slaves\n        To make the sharks a meal.\n        And I think that beam on the silvered swell\n        That spreads, and splashes, and gleams, and dips,\n        That has shone on the cruel and brave as well,\n        On the trail o' the slaves and the ivory ships,\n        Is the lane down which the memories run\n        Of all that's wild beneath the sun.\"\n\nThe concertina wailed into a sort of minor dirge and ceased.  Fred\nfastened the catch, and put the instrument away.\n\n\"Why don't you applaud?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, bravo, bravo!\" said Will and I together.\n\nMonty looked hard at both of us.\n\n\"Strange!\" he remarked.  \"You're both distracted, and you've each got a\nslight cut over the jugular!\"\n\n\"Been trying out razors,\" said Yerkes.\n\n\"Um-m-m!\" remarked Monty. \"Well--I'm glad it's no worse.  How about\nbed, eh?  Better lock your door--that lady up-stairs is what the\nGermans call gefaehrlich!*  Goo'night!\"\n\n-----------\n* Gefaehrlich, dangerous.\n-----------\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n\nTHE NJO HAPA SONG\n\n  Tongues!  Oh, music of eastern tongues, harmonied murmur\n        of streets ahum!\n  Trade!  Oh, frasila weights of clove--ivory--copra--copal\n        gum--\n  Rubber--vanilla and tortoise-shell!  The methods change.\n        The captains come.\n\n        I was old when the clamor o' Babel's end\n        (All seas were chartless then!)\n        Drove forth the brood, and Solitude\n        Was the newest quest of men.\n        I lay like a gem in a silken sea\n        Unseen, uncoveted, unguessed\n        Till scented winds that waft afar\n        Bore word o' the warm delights there are\n        Where ground-swells sing by Zanzibar\n        Long rhapsodies of rest.\n\n  Wild, oh wilder than winter blasts my wet skies shriek when\n        the winds are freed.\n  Mild, oh milder than virgin mirth is the laugh o' the reefs\n        where sea-birds feed,\n  Screaming and skirling and down again. (Though the sea-birds\n        warn do captains heed?)\n\n\nThere is no public landing wharf at Zanzibar.  Passengers have to\nsubmit their persons into the arms of loud-lunged Swahili longshoremen,\nwho recognize one sole and only point of honor:  neither passenger nor\nluggage shall be dropped into the surf.\n\nTheir invariable habit, the instant the view-halloa is raised, is to\nscamper headlong, pounce on the victim and pull him apart (or so it\nfeels) until fortune, superior strength, or some such element decides\nthe point; and then more often than not it is the victim's fate to be\ncarried between two men, each hold of a thigh, each determined to get\nashore or to the boat first, and each grimly resolved not to let go\nuntil three times the proper fee shall have been paid.  Of only these\ntwo things let the passenger assure himself--fight how he may, he will\nneither escape their clutches nor get wet.  Rather they will hold him\nupside-down until the contents of his pockets fall into the surf.  Dry\non the beach or into the boat they will dump him.  And whatever he\nshall pay them will surely be insufficient.\n\nBut we had a privy councilor of England of our party, and favors were\nshown us that never fall to the lot of ordinary travelers.  Opposite\nthe Sultan's palace is the Sultan's private wharf, so royal and private\nthat it is a prison offense to trespass on it without written\npermission.  Because of his official call at the Residency, and of his\ncard left on the Sultan, wires had been pulled, and a pompous\nindividual whose black face sweated greasily, and whose palm itched for\nunearned increment, called on Monty very shortly after breakfast with\nintimation that the wharf had been placed at our disposal, since His\nHighness the Sultan desired to do us honor.\n\nSo when the B. I. steamer dropped anchor in the great roadstead shortly\nafter noon we were taken to the wharf by one of the Sultan's\nhousehold--a very civil-spoken Arab gentleman--and three English\nofficers met us there who made a fuss over Monty and were at pains to\nbe agreeable to the rest of us.  While we stood chatting and waiting\nfor the boat that should row us and belongings the mile-and-a-half or\nso to the steamer, I saw something that made me start.  Fred gazed\npresently in the same direction.\n\n\"Johnson is number one!\" he said, as if checking off my mental\nprocesses.  He meant Hassan.  \"Number two is Georges Coutlass, our\nfriend the Greek.  Number three is--am I drunk this early in the\nday?--what do you see?--doesn't she look to you like?--by the big blind\ngod of men's mistakes it's--Monty!  Didums, you deaf idiot, look!  See!\"\n\nAt that everybody naturally looked the same way.  Everybody nodded.\nCoutlass the Greek, and Hassan, reputed nephew of Tippoo Tib, were\nheaded in one boat toward the steamer, the worse for the handling, but\nright side up and no angrier than the usual passenger.  Following them\nwas another boat containing a motley assortment of Arabs and\npart-Arabs, who might, or might not be associated with them.\n\nOn the beach still, surrounded yet by a swarm of longshoremen who\nyelled and fought, Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon and her Syrian maid stood\nat bay.  Her two Swahili men-servants were overwhelmed and already\nbeing carried to a boat.  Her luggage was being borne helter-skelter\nafter them, and another boat waited for her just beyond the belt of\nsurf, the rowers standing up to yell encouragement at the sweating pack\nthat dared not close in on its victims.  Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon\nappeared to have no other weapon than a parasol, but she had plainly\nthe upper hand.\n\n\"She has a way with her with natives,\" said the senior officer present.\n\n\"It's a pity,\" said Monty.  \"I mean, one scarcely likes to use this\nwharf and watch that.\"\n\n\"Quite so.  Yet we daren't accord her official recognition.  She'd be\ncertain to make capital out of it.  We're awfully glad she's going.\nThe Residency atmosphere is one huge sigh of relief.  We would like to\nspeed the parting guest, but it mayn't be done.  However, you'll know\nthere are others not so particular.  I imagine her friends are late for\nthe appointment.\"\n\n\"Where's she going?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"British East Africa.\"\n\n\"Mombasa?\"\n\n\"And then on.  She has drafts on a German merchant in Nairobi.\"\n\nFrom that moment until we were safely in our quarters on the steamer\nMonty's attitude became one of rigid indifference toward her or\nanything to do with her.  The British officers went out to the steamer\nwith us, but all the way Monty only talked of the climate, trade\nconditions, and the other subjects to which polite conversation of\nAfrica's east coast is limited.  Fred kept nudging him, but Monty took\nno notice.  Yerkes whispered to Fred.  Then I heard Fred whisper to\nMonty in one of those raucous asides that he perfectly well knows can\nbe heard by everybody.\n\n\"Why don't you ask 'em about her, you ass?\"\n\nBut Monty refused to rise.  He talked of the bowed and ancient slaves\nof Zanzibar, who refused in those days to be set free and afforded\nprolific ground for attack on British public morals by people whose\nbusiness it is to abuse England for her peccadillos and forget her\nvirtues.*\n\n---------------\n* In 1914 there were still thousands of slaves in German East, although\nthe German press and public were ever loudest in their condemnation of\nBritish conditions.\n---------------\n\nWe reached the ship, and were watching our piles of luggage arrive up\nthe accommodation ladder when the solution of Lady Isobel Saffren\nWaldon's problem appeared.  She arrived alongside in the official boat\nof the German consulate, a German officer in white uniform on either\nhand, and the German ensign at the stern.\n\n\"Pretty fair impudence, paying official honors to our undesirables, yet\nI don't see what we can do,\" said the senior from the Residency.\n\nYerkes drew me aside.\n\n\"Did you ever see anything more stupidly British?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It's as obvious as the nose on your face that she's up to some game.\nIt's as plain as twice two that the Germans are backing her whether the\nBritish like it or not.  Look at those two Heinies now!\"\n\nWe faced about and watched them.  After bowing Lady Waldon to her\ncabin, they approached our party with brazen claim to recognition--and\nreceived it.  They were met, and spoken to apparently as cordially as\nif their friendship had been indisputable.\n\n\"Did you ever see anything to beat it?  Why not kick 'em into the sea?\nEither that woman's a crook or she isn't.  If she isn't, then the\nBritish have treated her shamefully, turning their backs on her.  But\nwe know she is a crook!  And so do they.  The Germans know it, too, and\nthey're flaunting her under official British noses!  They're using her\nto start something the British won't like, and the British know it!\nYet she's going to be allowed to travel to British territory on a\nBritish ship, and the Heinies are shaken hands with!  If you complained\nto Monty I bet he'd say, 'Don't talk fight unless you mean fight!'\"\n\n\"Monty might also add, 'Don't talk-fight!'\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, rot!\" Will answered.  \"British individuals may bridle a bit, but\ntheir government'll shut its eyes until too late, whatever happens!\nYou mark my words!\"\n\nWe strolled back toward our party in great discontent, I as much as he,\nnever supposing there was another country in the world that could so\ndeliberately shut its eyes to dog's work until absolutely forced to\ninterfere, by a hair not quite too late.\n\nCoutlass and Hassan traveled second-class--the Arab and half-Arab\ncontingent third--and none of them troubled us, at present, except that\nWill swore at sight of Coutlass swaggering as if the ship and her\ncontents were all his.\n\n\"To hear him brag you'd believe the British government afraid of him!\"\nhe grumbled.\n\nBut an immediate problem drove Coutlass out of mind.  Lady Isobel\nSaffren Waldon had been given a cabin in line with ours, at the end of\nour corridor.  Her maid, and her two Swahili servants were obliged to\npass our doors to get to her cabin at all.  As nearly all ships' cabins\non those hot routes do, ours intercommunicated by a metal grill for\nventilating purposes, and a word spoken in one cabin above a whisper\ncould be heard in the next.\n\nFred was the first to realize conditions.  He opened his door in his\nusual abrupt way to visit Monty's cabin and almost fell over the Syrian\nmaid, her eye at Monty's key-hole--a little too early in the game to\npass for sound judgment, as Fred was at pains to assure her.\n\nThe alarm being given, we locked our cabin doors, repaired to the\nsmoking-room, and ordered drinks at a center table where no\neavesdropper could overhear.\n\n\"It's one of two things,\" said Monty.  He had his folding board out,\nand we did not doubt he would play chess from there to London.  \"Either\nthey know exactly where that ivory is, or they haven't the slightest\nidea.\"\n\n\"My, but you're wise!\" said Will.\n\nMonty ignored him.  \"They suspect us of knowing.  They mean to prevent\nour getting any of it.  If they do know, they've some reason of their\nown for not getting it themselves at present.  If they don't know, they\nsuspect we know and intend to claim what we find.\"\n\n\"How should they think we know?\" objected Will.  \"The first we ever\nheard of the stuff was in the lazaretto in Zanzibar.\"\n\n\"True.  Juma told us.  Juma probably told them that we told him.\nNatives often put the cart before the horse without the slightest\nintention of lying.\"\n\n\"All the same, why should they believe him?\"\n\n\"Why not?  Zanzibar's agog with the story--after all these years. The\nivory must have been buried more than a quarter of a century ago. Some\none's been stirring the mud. We arrive, unexpectedly from nowhere, ask\nquestions about the ivory, make plans for British East Africa--and\nthere you are!  The people who were merely determined to get the stuff\njump to the false conclusion that we really know where it is.''\n\n\"Q. E. D.!\" said Fred, finishing his drink.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Monty.  \"There are two things yet to be\ndemonstrated.  They're true, but not proven.  The German government is\nafter the stuff.  And the German government has very special reasons\nfor secrecy and tricks.\"\n\n\"We four against the German government looks like longish odds,\" said\nI.\n\n\"Remains to be seen,\" said Monty.  \"If the German government's very\nspecial reasons were legal or righteous they'd be announced with a\nfanfare of trumpets.\"\n\n\"Where's all this leading us?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"To a slight change of plan,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Thank the lord!  That means you don't go to Brussels--stay with us!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort, Fred.  But you three keep together.  They're\ngoing to watch you.  You watch them.  Watch Schillingschen particularly\nclosely, if you find him.  The closer they watch you, the more likely\nthey are to lose sight of me.  I'll take care to have several red\nherrings drawn across my trail after I reach London.  Perhaps I'll\nreturn down the west coast and travel up the Congo River.  At any rate,\nwhen I do come, and whichever way I come, I'll have everything legal,\nin writing.  Let your game be to seem mysterious.  Seem to know more\nthan you do, but don't tell anybody anything.  Above all, listen!\"\n\nFred leaned back in his chair and laughed.\n\n\"Didums!\" he said.  \"This is the idioticest wild goose chase we ever\nstarted on!  I admit I nosed it.  I gave tongue first.  But think of\nit--here we are--four sensible men--hitherto sensible--off after ivory\nthat nobody can really prove exists, said to be buried somewhere in a\ntract of half-explored country more than a thousand miles each way--and\nthe German government, and half the criminals in Africa already on our\nidiotic heels!\"\n\n\"Yet the German government and the crooks seem convinced, too, that\nthere's something worth looking for!\" laughed Monty.  And none of us\ncould answer that.\n\nFor that matter, none of us would have been willing to withdraw from\nthe search, however dim the prospect of success might seem in the\nintervals when cold reason shed its comfortless rays on us.  Intuition,\nor whatever it is that has proved superior so often to worldly wisdom\n(temptation, Fred calls it!) outweighed reason, and Fred himself would\nhave been last to agree to forego the search.\n\nThe voyage is short between Zanzibar and Mombasa, but there was\nincident.  We were spied on after very thorough fashion, Lady Saffren\nWaldon's title and gracious bearing (when that suited her) being\npractical weapons.  The purser was Goanese--beside himself with the\nfumes of flattery.  He had a pass-key, so the Syrian maid went through\nour cabins and searched thoroughly everything except the wallet of\nimportant papers that Monty kept under his shirt.  The first and second\nofficers were rather young, unmarried men possessed of limitless\nignorance of the wiles of such as Lady Waldon.  It was they who signed\na paper recommending Coutlass to the B. I. agents and a lot of other\nreputable people in Mombasa and elsewhere, thus offsetting the\npossibility that the authorities might not let him land.  (Had we known\nall that at the time, Monty's word against him might have caused him to\nbe shipped back whence he came, but we did not find it out until\nafterward; nor did we know the law.)\n\nAnd at Mombasa we made our first united, serious mistake.  It was put\nto the vote. We all agreed.\n\n\"I can come ashore,\" said Monty, \"introduce you to officialdom, get you\nput up for the club, and be useful generally.  That, though, 'll lend\ncolor to the theory that you're in league with me--whereas, if I leave\nyou to your own resources, that may help lose my scent.  When they pick\nit up again we'll be knowing better where we stand.\"\n\n\"If you came ashore for a few hours we'd have the benefit of your\nprestige,\" said I.\n\n\"I admit it.\"\n\n\"I suspect a title's mighty near as useful on British territory as in\nN'York or Boston,\" said Will.  \"We'd bask in smiles.\"\n\n\"Not wholly,\" said Monty. \"There's another side to that.  There's an\nEnglish official element that would rather be rude to some poor devil\nwith a title than draw pay (and it loves its pay, you may believe me!).\nYou'd have friends in high places, but make enemies, too, if I go\nashore with you.\"\n\n\"What's your own proposal?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"I've stated it.  I want you fellows to choose.  There's no need of me\nashore--that's to say, I've a draft to bearer for the amount you three\nhave in the common fund--here, take it.  If you think you'll need more\nthan that, then I'll have to go to the bank with you and cash some of\nmy own draft.  I think you'll have enough.\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Will.\n\n\"Let's send him home!\" proposed Fred.\n\n\"How about communications?\"  We had contrived a code already with the\naid of a pocket Portuguese-English dictionary, of which Fred and Monty\neach possessed a similar edition.\n\n\"The Mombasa Bank, Will.  You keep them posted as to your whereabouts.\nWhen I write the bank manager I'll ask him to keep my address a secret.\"\n\nSo we said good-by to Monty and left him on board, and wished we hadn't\na dozen times before noon next day, and a hundred times within the\nweek.  The last sight we had of him was as the shore boat came\nalongside the wharf and the half-breed customs officials pounced\nsmiling on us.  My eyes were keenest.  I could see Monty pacing the\nupper deck, too rapidly for evidence of peace of mind--a\nstraight-standing, handsome figure of a man.  I pointed him out to the\nothers, and we joked about him.  Then the gloom of the customs shed\nswallowed us, and there was a new earth and, for the present, no more\nsea.\n\nThe island of Mombasa is so close to the cocoanut-fringed mainland that\na railway bridge connects them.  Like Zanzibar, it is a place of\nstrange delights, and bridled lawlessness controlled by the veriest\nhandful of Englishmen.  There are strange hotels--strange\ndwellings--streets--stores--tongues and faces.  The great grim fort\nthat brave da Gama built, and held against all comers, dominates the\nsea front and the lower town.  The brass-lunged boys who pounce on\nbaggage, fight for it, and tout for the grandly named hotels are of as\nmany tribes as sizes, as many tongues as tribes.\n\nEverything is different--everything strange--everything, except the\nheat, delightful.  And as Fred said, \"some folk would grumble in hell!\"\nTrees, flowers, birds, costumes of the women, sheen of the sea, glint\nof sun on bare skins of every shade from ivory to ebony, dazzling coral\nroadway and colored coral walls, babel of tongues, sack-saddled donkeys\nsleepily bearing loads of coral for new buildings, and--winding in and\nout among it all--the narrow-gauge tramway on which trolleys pushed by\nstocky little black men carry officialdom gratis, and the rest of the\nworld and his wife according to tariff; all those things are the\nalphabet of Mombasa's charm.  Arranged, and rearranged--by chance, by\nindividual perspective, and by point of view--they spell fascination,\nattractiveness, glamour, mystery.  And no acquaintance with Mombasa,\nhowever intimate or old, dispels the charm to the man not guilty of\ncynicism.  To the cynic (and for him) there are sin--as Africa alone\nknows how to sin--disease, of the dread zymotic types--and death; death\npeering through the doors of godowns, where the ivory tusks are piled;\ndeath in the dark back-streets of the bazaar, where tired policemen\nwage lop-sided warfare against insanitary habits and a quite\nimpracticable legal code; death on the beach, where cannibal crabs\nparade in thousands and devour all helpless things; death in the scrub\n(all green and beautiful) where the tiny streets leave off and snakes\nclaim heritage; death in the grim red desert beyond the coast-line,\nwhere lean, hopeless jackals crack today men's dry bones left fifty\nyears ago by the slave caravans--marrowless bones long since stripped\nclean by the ants.  But we are not all cynics.\n\nLast to be cynic or pessimist was Louis McGregor Abraham, proprietor of\nthe Imperial Hotel--Syrian by birth, Jew by creed, Englishman by\nnationality, and admirer first, last and all the time of all things\nprosperous and promising, except his rival, the Hotel Royal.\n\n\"You came to the right place,\" he assured us when the last hot porter\nhad dumped the last of our belongings on the porch, had ceased from\nchattering to watch Fred's financial methods, had been paid double the\ncustomary price, and had gone away grumbling (to laugh at us behind our\nbacks).  \"They'd have rooked you at the other hole--underfed you,\novercharged you, and filled you full of lies.  I tell the truth to folk\nwho come to my hotel.\"\n\nAnd he did, some of it.  He was inexhaustible, unconquerable, tireless,\nan optimist always.  He had a store that was part of the hotel, in\nwhich he claimed to sell \"everything the mind of man could wish for in\nEast Africa\"; and the boast was true.  He even sold American dime\nnovels.\n\n\"East Africa's a great country!\" he kept assuring us.  \"Some day we'll\nall be rich!  Have to get ready for it!  Have to be prepared!  Have to\nstock everything the mind of man can want, to encourage new arrivals\nand make the old ones feel at home.  Lose a little money, but why\ngrumble?  Get it back when the boom comes.  As it will, mind you.  As\nit will.  Can't help it.  Richest country in the world--grow\nanything--find anything--game--climate--elevation--scenery--natives by\nthe million to do the work--all good!  Only waiting for white men with\nenergy, and capital to start things really moving!\"\n\nBut there were other points of view.  We went to the bank, and found\nits manager conservative.  The amount of the draft we placed to our\ncredit insured politeness.\n\n\"Be cautious,\" he advised us.  \"Take a good look round before you\ncommit yourselves!\"\n\nHe agreed to manage the interchange of messages between us and Monty,\nand invited us all to dinner that evening at the club; so we left the\nbank feeling friendly and more confident.  Later, a chance-met English\nofficial showed us over the old fort (now jail) where men of more\nbreeds and sorts than Noah knew, better clothed and fed than ever in\ntheir lives, drew endless supplies of water in buckets from da Gama's\nwell.\n\n\"Some of them have to be kicked out when their sentences expire!\" he\ntold us.  \"See you at the club tonight.  Glad to help welcome you.\"\n\nBut there was a shock in store, and as time passed the shocks increased\nin number and intensity.  Our guns had not been surrendered to us by\nthe customs people.  We had paid duty on them second-hand at the rate\nfor new ones, and had then been told to apply for them at the\ncollector's office, where our names and the guns' numbers would be\nentered on the register--for a fee.\n\nWe now went to claim them, and on the way down inquired at a store\nabout ammunition.  We were told that before we could buy cartridges we\nwould need a permit from the collector specifying how many, and of what\nbore we might buy.  There was an Arab in the store ahead of us.  He was\nbuying Martini Henry cartridges.  I asked whether he had a permit, and\nwas told he did not need one.\n\n\"Being an Arab?\" I asked.\n\n\"Being well known to the government,\" was the answer.\n\nWe left the store feeling neither quite so confident nor friendly.  And\nthe collector's Goanese assistant did the rest of the disillusioning.\n\nNo, we could not have our guns.  No, we could have no permit for\nammunition.  No, the collector was not in the office.  No, he would not\nbe there that afternoon.  It was provided in regulations that we could\nhave neither guns, sporting licenses, nor permits for ammunition.  The\nguns were perfectly safe in the government godown--would not be\ntampered with--would be returned to us when we chose to leave the\ncountry.\n\n\"But, good God, we've paid duty on them!\" Oakes protested.\n\n\"You should not have brought the guns with you unless you desired to\npay duty,\" said the Goanese.\n\n\"But where's the collector?\" Yerkes demanded.\n\n\"I am only assistant,\" was the answer.  \"How should I know?\"\n\nThe man's insolence, of demeanor and words, was unveiled, and the more\nwe argued with him the more sullen and evasive he grew, until at last\nhe ordered us out of the office.  At that we took chairs and announced\nour intention of staying until the collector should come or be fetched.\nWe were informed that the collector was the most important government\nofficial in Mombasa--information that so delighted Fred that he grew\nalmost good tempered again.\n\n\"I'd rather twist a big tail than a little one!\" he announced.  \"Shall\nwe sing to pass the time?\"\n\nThe Goanese called for the askari,* half-soldier, half-police-man, who\ndrowsed in meek solitude outside the office door.\n\n----------------\n* Askari, soldier.\n----------------\n\n\"Remove these people, please!\" he said in English, and then repeated it\nin Kiswahili.\n\nThe askari eyed us, shifted his bare feet uncomfortably, screwed up his\ncourage, tried to look stern, and said something in his own tongue.\n\n\"Put them out, I said!\" said the Goanese.\n\n\"He orders you to put us out!\" grinned Fred.\n\n\"The office closes at three,\" said the Goanese, glancing at the clock\nin a half-hearted effort to moderate his own daring.\n\n\"Not unless the collector comes and closes it himself, it doesn't!\"\nFred announced with folded arms.\n\nWill pulled out two rupees and offered them to the sentry.\n\n\"Go and bring us some food,\" he said. \"We intend to stay in here until\nyour bwana makubwa* comes.\"\n\n--------------\n* Bwana makubwa, lit. big master, senior government officer.\n--------------\n\nThe sentry refused the money, waving it aside with the air of a Caesar\ndeclining a crown.\n\n\"Gee!\" exclaimed Will.  \"You've got to hand it to the British if they\ntrain colored police to refuse money.\"\n\nThe askari, it seemed, was a man of more than one kind of discretion.\nWithout another word to the Goanese he saluted the lot of us with a\nsweep of his arm, turned on his heel and vanished--not stopping in his\nhurry to put on the sandals that lay on the door-step.  We amused\nourselves while he was gone by flying questions at the Goanese,\ncalculated to disturb what might be left of his equanimity without\ngiving him ground for lawsuits.\n\n\"How old are you?\"--\"How much pay do you get?\"--\"How long have you held\nyour job?\"--\"Do you ever get drunk?\"--\"Are you married?\"--\"Does your\nwife love you?\"--\"Do you keep white mice?\"--\"Is your life\ninsured?\"--\"How often have you been in jail?\"--\"Are you honest?\"--\"Are\nyou vaccinated against the jim-jams?\"--\"Why is your name Fernandez and\nnot Braganza?\"\n\nThe man was about distracted, for he had been unwise enough to try to\nanswer, when suddenly the collector came in great haste and stalked\nthrough the office into the inner room.\n\n\"Fernandez!\" he called as he passed, and the Goanese hurried after him,\nhugely relieved.  There was five minute's consultation behind the\npartition in tones too low for us to catch more than a word or two, and\nthen Fernandez came out again with a \"Now wait and see, my hearties!\"\nsmile on his face.  He was actually rubbing his palms together, sure of\na swift revenge.\n\n\"He says you are to go in there,\" he announced.\n\nSo we filed in, Fred Oakes first, and it seemed to me the moment I saw\nthe collector's face that the outlook was not so depressing.  He looked\nneither young nor incompetent.  His jaw was neither receding nor too\nprominent.  His neck sat on his shoulders with the air of full\nresponsibility, unsought but not refused.  And his eyes looked straight\ninto those of each of us in turn with a frank challenge no honest\nfellow could resent.\n\n\"Take seats, won't you,\" he said. \"Your names, please?\"\n\nWe told him, and he wrote them down.\n\n\"My clerk tells me you tried to bribe the askari.  You shouldn't do\nthat.  We are at great pains to keep the police dependable.  It's too\nbad to put temptation in their way.\"\n\nWill, with cold precision, told him the exact facts.  He listened to\nthe end, and then laughed.\n\n\"One more Goanese mistake!\" he said.  \"We have to employ them.  They\nmean well.  The country has no money to spend on European office\nassistants.  Well--what can I do for you?\"\n\nAt that Fred cut loose.\n\n\"We want our guns before dark!\" he said.  \"It's the first time my\ncharacter has been questioned by any government, and I say the same for\nmy friends!\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said the collector, eying us strangely.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Fred.\n\n\"That is so,\" said I.\n\n\"Entirely so,\" said Will.\n\n\"I have information,\" said the collector, tapping with a pencil on his\nblotter, \"that you men are ivory hunters.  That you left Portuguese\nterritory because the German consul there had to request the Portuguese\ngovernment to expel you.\"\n\n\"All easily disproved,\" said Fred. \"Confront us, please, with our\naccusers.\"\n\n\"And that Lord Montdidier, with whom you have been traveling, became so\ndisgusted with your conduct that he refused to land with you at this\nport as he at first intended!\"\n\nWe all three gasped.  The first thing that occurred to me, and I\nsuppose to all of us, was to send for Monty.  His steamer was not\nsupposed to sail for an hour yet.  But the thought had hardly flashed\nin mind when we heard the roar of steam and clanking as the anchor\nchain came home.  The sound traveled over water and across roofs like\nthe knell of good luck--the clanking of the fetters of ill fate.\n\n\"Where's her next stop?\" said I.\n\n\"Suez,\" Fred answered.\n\nSimultaneously then to all three the thought came too that this\ninterpretation of Monty's remaining on board was exactly what we\nwanted.  The more people suspected us of acting independently of him\nthe better.\n\n\"Confront us with our accusers!\" Fred insisted.\n\n\"You are not accused--at least not legally,\" said the collector.  \"You\nare refused rifle and ammunition permits, that is all.\"\n\n\"On the ground of being ivory hunters?\"\n\n\"Suspected persons--not known to the government--something rather\nstronger than rumor to your discredit, and nothing known in your favor.\"\n\n\"What recourse have we?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Well--what proof can you offer that you are bona fide travelers or\nintending settlers?  Are you ivory hunters or not?\"\n\n\"I'll answer that,\" said Fred--dexterously I thought, \"when I've seen a\ncopy of the game laws. We're law-abiding men.\"\n\nThe collector handed us a well thumbed copy of the Red Book.\n\n\"They're all in that,\" he said.  \"I'll lend it to you, or you can buy\none almost anywhere in town.  If you decide after reading that to go\nfarther up country I'm willing to issue provisional game licenses,\nsubject to confirmation after I've looked into any evidence you care to\nsubmit on your own behalf.  You can have your guns against a cash\ndeposit--\"\n\n\"How big?\"\n\n\"Two hundred rupees for each gun!\"\n\nFred laughed.  The demand was intended to be away over our heads.  The\ncollector bridled.\n\n\"But no ammunition,\" he went on, \"until your claim to respectability\nhas been confirmed.  By the way, the only claim you've made to me is\nfor the guns.  You've told me nothing about yourselves.\"\n\n\"Two hundred a gun?\" said Fred.  \"Counting a pistol or revolver as\none?  Three guns apiece--nine guns--eighteen hundred rupees' deposit?\"\n\nThe collector nodded with a sort of grim pleasure in his own\nunreasonableness.  Fred drew out our new check book.\n\n\"You fellows agreeable?\" he asked, and we nodded.\n\n\"Here's a check on the Mombasa Bank for ten thousand, and your\ngovernment can have as much more again if it wants it,\" he said.  \"Make\nme out a receipt please, and write on it what it's for.\"\n\nThe collector wrote.  He was confused, for he had to tear up more than\none blank.\n\n\"I suppose we get interest on the money at the legal local rate?\" asked\nFred maliciously.\n\n\"I'll inquire about that,\" said the collector.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Fred, \"but I'm going to give you some advice.  While\nyou're inquiring, look into the antecedents of Lady Isobel Saffren\nWaldon!  It's she who gave out the tip against us.  Her tip's a bad\none.  So is she.\"\n\n\"She hasn't applied for guns or a license,\" the collector answered\ntartly.         \"It's people who want to carry firearms--people able\nand likely to make trouble whom we keep an eye on.\"\n\n\"She's more likely to make trouble for you than a burning house!\" put\nin Will Yerkes.  \"If my partner hadn't paid you that check I'd be all\nfor having this business out!  I'm going to let them know in the States\nwhat sort of welcome people receive at this port!\"\n\n\"You came of your own accord.  You weren't invited,\" the collector\nanswered.\n\n\"That's a straight-out lie!\" snapped Will.  \"You know it's a lie!  Why,\nthere isn't a newspaper in South Africa that hasn't been carrying ads\nof this country for months past.  Even papers I've had sent me from the\nStates have carried press-agent dope about it.  Why, you've been\nyelling for settlers like a kid squalling for milk--and you say we're\nnot invited now we've come here!  I'm going to write and tell the U. S.\npapers what that dope is worth!\"\n\n\"Ivory hunters are not settlers,\" the collector interjected.\n\n\"Who said we're ivory hunters?\"  Will was in a fine rage, and Fred and\nI leaned back to enjoy the official's discomfort.  \"Besides, your ads\nbragged about the big game as one of the chief attractions!  All the\ninformation you can possibly have against us must have come from a\nfemale crook in the pay of the German government!  You're not behaving\nthe way gentlemen do where I was raised!\"\n\n\"There is no intention to offend,\" said the collector.\n\n\"Intention is good!\" said Will, laughing in spite of himself. \"There's\nanother thing I want to know.  What about ammunition?  We're to have\nour guns.  They're useless without cartridges.  What about it?\"\n\n\"The guns shall be sent to your hotel tonight.  The provisional\nsporting licenses--if you want them--will be ready tomorrow\nmorning--seven hundred and fifty rupees apiece--I'll charge them\nagainst your deposit.  If the licenses should be confirmed after\ninquiry, I will send you permits through the post for fifty rounds of\nammunition each.\"\n\nWill snorted.  Fred Oakes yelled with laughter, and I gaped with\nindignation.\n\n\"I'm going into this to the hilt!\" spluttered Fred.  \"I wouldn't have\nmissed it for a fortune!  We three are going to constitute ourselves a\ncommittee of inspection.  We're going to wander the country over and\nreport home to the newspapers--South African--British--U. S. A.--and\nany other part of the world that's interested!  We won't worry about\nammunition.  Send us permits for whatever quantity seems to you proper,\nand we'll note it all down in our diaries!\"\n\nWe all stood up, the collector obviously uncomfortable and we, if not\nat ease, at least happier than we had been.\n\nFred nodded to the collector genially, and we all walked out.\n\nMombasa is a fairly large island, but the built-over part of it is\nsmall, so it was not surprising that we should emerge from the office\nface to face with Lady Saffren Waldon.  She was the one surprised, not\nwe.  She probably thought she had spiked our guns in that part of the\nworld forever, and the sight of us coming laughing from the very office\nwhere we should have been made glum must have been disconcerting.\n\nShe was riding on one of the little trolley-cars, pushed by two boys in\nwhite official uniform, dressed in her flimsiest best, a lace parasol\nacross her knee, and beside her an obvious member of the\ngovernment--young, and so recently from home as not to have lost his\npink cheeks yet.\n\nHad there not been an awning over the trolley-car she might have used\nthe parasol to make believe she had not seen us.  But the awning\nprecluded that, and we were not more than two or three yards away.\n\n\"Laugh!\" whispered Fred.\n\nSo we crossed the track laughing and the trolley had to pause to let us\nby.  We laughed as we raised our helmets to her--laughed both at her\nand at the pink and white puppy she had taken in leash.  And then the\nsort of thing happened that nearly always does when men with a\nreasonable faith in their own integrity make up their minds to see\nopprobrium through.  Fate stepped hard on our arm of the balance.\n\nIf built-over Mombasa is a small place, so is Africa.  So is the world.\nStriding down the hill from the other hotel, the rival one, the Royal,\ncame a man so well known in so many lands that they talk of naming a\ntenth of a continent after him--the mightiest hunter since Nimrod, and\nvery likely mightier than he; surely more looked-up to and\nrespected--a little, wiry-looking, freckled, wizened man whose beard\nhad once been red, who walked with a decided limp and blinked genially\nfrom under the brim of a very neat khaki helmet.\n\n\"Why, bless my soul if it isn't Fred Oakes!\" he exclaimed, in a\nsqueaky, worn-out voice that is as well known as his face, and\nquickened his pace down-hill.\n\n\"Courtney!\" said Fred.  \"There's only one man I'd rather meet!\"\n\nThe little man laughed.  \"Oh, you and your Montdidier are still\ninseparable, I suppose!  How are you, Fred?  I'm glad to see you.  Who\nare your friends?\"\n\nAt that minute out came the collector from his office--stood on the\nstep, and stared.  Fred introduced us to Courtney, and I experienced\nthe thrill of shaking hands with the man accounts of whose exploits had\nfired my schoolboy imagination and made stay-at-home life forever after\nan impossibility.\n\n\"I missed the steamer, Fred.  Not another for a week.  Going down now\nto see about a passage to Somaliland.  I suppose you'll be at the club\nafter dinner?\"\n\n\"No\" said Fred.  \"We've an invitation, but I think we'll send a note\nand say we can't come.  We'll dine at our hotel and sit on the veranda\nafterward.\"\n\nI wondered what Fred was driving at, and so did the collector who was\nheaded across the street and listening with all ears.\n\n\"That so?  Not a bad idea.  They've very kindly made me an honorary\nmember of the club, but I rather expect there's a string to that--eh,\nFred, don't you?  They'll expect stories,--stories.  I get tired of\ntelling the same tales so many times over.  Suppose I join you fellows,\neh?  I'm at the Royal.  You at the other place?  Suppose I join you\nafter dinner, and we have a pipe together on the veranda?\"\n\n\"Nothing I'd like better,\" said Fred, and I felt too pleased with the\nprospect to say anything at all.  Growing old is a foolish and\nunnecessary business, but there is no need to forego while young the\nthrills of unashamed hero-worship; in fact, that is one of the ways of\ncontinuing young.  It is only the disillusioned (poor deceived ones)\nand the cynics, who grow old ungracefully.\n\nWe went upstreet, through the shadow of the great grim fort.  The\ntrolley-car trundled down among the din, smells and colors of the\nbusiness-end of town.  Looking over my shoulder I saw Courtney talking\nto the collector.\n\n\"We're getting absolution, Fred!\" said I.\n\n\"I'm not sure we need it,\" Fred answered.  \"I hope Courtney won't tell\ntoo much!\"  So quickly does a man jump from praying for friends at\ncourt to fearing them!\n\n\"Courtney looked to me,\" said Will, \"like a man who would give no games\naway.\"\n\n\"Glad you think that of him,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Tell you later, maybe.\"\n\nBut he did not tell until after dinner.  (It was a good dinner for East\nAfrica.  Shark steak figured in it, under a more respectable name; and\nthere was zebu hump, guinea-fowl, and more different kinds of fruit\nthan a man could well remember.)  When it was over we sat in deep\narmchairs on the long wide veranda that fronts the whole hotel.  The\nevening sea-breeze came and wafted in on us the very scents of Araby;\nthe night sounds that whisper of wilderness gave the lie to a tinkling\nguitar that somewhere in the distance spoke of civilized delights.  The\nsurf crooned on coral half a mile away, and very good cigar smoke (from\na box that Monty had sent ashore with our belongings) supplemented\ncoffee and the other aids to physical contentment.  Then, limping\nbetween the armchairs, and ashamed that we should rise to greet\nhim--motioning us down again with a little nervous laugh--Courtney came\nto us.  Within five minutes of his coming the world, and the clock, and\nthe laws of men might have all reversed themselves for aught we cared.\nWithout really being conscious he was doing it Courtney plunged into\nour problem, grasped it, sized it up, advised us, flooded us with\npriceless, wonderful advice, and did it with such almost feminine\nsympathy that I believe we would have been telling him our love-affairs\nat last, if a glance at the watch he wore in a case at his belt had not\ntold him it was three A. M.\n\n\"There's trouble\" he began when he had filled his pipe.  \"You boys are\nin trouble.  What is it?\" he asked, shifting and twitching in his\nseat--refusing an armchair--refusing a drink.\n\n\"Tell us first what's the matter with you,\" said Fred.\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  An old wound.  A lion once dragged me by this shoulder\nhalf a mile or so.  At this time of year I get pains.  They last a day\nor two, then pass--Go on, tell me!\"\n\nHe never sat really still once that whole evening, yet never once\ncomplained or made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"I propose,\" said Fred, with a glance at Yerkes and me, \"to tell\nCourtney everything without reserve.\"\n\nThe little old hunter nodded, watching us with bright blue eyes.  I\nreceived the impression that he knew more secrets than he could tell\nshould he talk down all the years that might be left him.  He was the\nsort of man in whom nearly every one confides.\n\n\"We're after Tippoo Tib's ivory!\" said Fred, plunging into the middle\nof things.  \"Monty has gone to drive a bargain with the King of\nBelgium.  Do you think it's a wild goose chase?\"\n\nCourtney chuckled. \"No,\" he said.  \"I wouldn't call it that.  They've\nbeen killing elephants in Africa ever since the flood.  Ivory must have\naccumulated.  It's somewhere.  Some of it must be so old and well\nseasoned as to be practically priceless, unless rats have spoiled it.\nRats play old Harry with ivory, you know.\"\n\n\"Have you a notion where it is?\" demanded Fred.\n\nCourtney laughed.  \"Behold me leaving the country!\" he said.\n\"If I knew I'd look.  If I saw I'd take!\"\n\n\"Can you give us a hint?\"\n\n\"There are caves near the summit of Mount Elgon that would hold the\nworld's revenues.  None of them have ever been thoroughly explored.\nCannibals live in some of them.  Cannibals and caverns is a combination\nthat might appeal to Tippoo Tib, but there's no likelihood that he\nburied all that ivory in one place, you know.  I suspect the greater\npart is in the Congo, and that the Germans know its whereabouts within\na mile or two.\"\n\n\"How did they discover it?\"\n\n\"Why don't they dig it out?\"\n\n\"What keeps 'em from turning their knowledge into money?\"\n\nWe had forgotten our own troubles.  Courtney, too, seemed to forget for\nthe moment that he had began by asking us a question.\n\n\"Remember Emin Pasha?  When was it--'87--'88--'89 that Stanley went and\nrescued him?  Perhaps you recall what was then described as Emin's\ningratitude after the event?  British government offered him a billet.\nKhedive of Egypt cabled him the promise of a job, all on Stanley's\nrecommendation.  Emin turned 'em all down and accepted a job from the\nGermans.  Nobody understood it at the time.  My own idea is that Emin\nthought he knew more or less where that hoard is.  He didn't really\nwant to come away with Stanley, you know.  Being a German, I suppose he\npreferred to share his secret with his own crowd.  I dare say he\nthought of telling Stanley but judged that the 'Rock breaker' might\ndemand a too large share.  The value of the stuff must be so enormous\nthat it's almost worth going to war about, from the point of view of a\nnation hungry for new colonies.  Emin is dead, and it's likely he left\nno exact particulars behind him.  To my personal knowledge the Germans\nhave had a swarm of spies for a long time operating beyond the Congo\nborder.\"\n\n\"Were you looking for the stuff yourself?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he laughed.  \"But when I'm hunting I look about me.  I'll\ntell you where the stuff may possibly be.  There's a section of country\ncalled the Bahr el Gazal that the Congo people claim, but that I\nbelieve will eventually prove to lie on the British side of the\nboundary.  It was good elephant country--which is to say bad living and\ntraveling for man--since the earth took shape out of ooze.  Awful\nswampy, malarious, densely wooded, dangerous country, sparsely\ninhabited by savages not averse to cannibalism when they've\nopportunity.  The ivory may be there.  If the Germans know it's there\nthey're naturally afraid the British government would claim the whole\ndistrict the minute the secret was out.  Their plan may possibly be to\nwait until a boundary dispute arises in the ordinary course of time\n(keeping a cautious eye on the cache meanwhile, of course) and then\ntake the Congo government side.  If they can contrive to have it\nacknowledged as Congo territory, they might then pick a quarrel with\nthe Congo government--or come to some sort of terms with them.\"\n\n\"They've patience,\" I said, \"if they're playing that game!\"\n\nCourtney raised his eyebrows until his forehead was a mass of deep\nwrinkles.  Then he blew a dozen smoke rings.\n\n\"Patient--perhaps.  It's my impression they're as remorseless and\npersistent as white ants--undermining, digging, devouring everywhere\nwhile the rest of the world sleeps.  Do you remember there was a mutiny\nof native troops in Uganda not many years ago?  Some said that was\nbecause the troops were being paid in truck instead of money, and like\nmost current excuses that one had some truth in it.  But the men\nthemselves vowed they were going to set up an African Muhammedan\nempire.\"\n\n\"What had that to do with Germans?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Nothing that I can personally prove\" said Courtney.  \"But I've a broad\nacquaintance among natives, and considerable knowledge of their\ntongues.  Muhammedanism is spreading among them very rapidly.  Over and\nover again, beside camp-fires, and in the dark when they thought I was\nnot listening, I have heard them talk of missionaries from German\nterritory who spread a doctrine of what you might call pan-Islam for\nlack of a better name.  I said at the time of the Uganda mutiny that I\nbelieved Germans were behind it.  I've seen no reason to change my\nopinion since.  It's obvious that if the mutiny had by some ill chance\nsucceeded Uganda would have been an easy prey for Karl Peters and his\nGermans.  If that ivory of Tippoo Tib's is really in the Bahr el Gazal\nat the back of Uganda, then the German motive for stirring up the\nUganda mutiny would be obvious.\"\n\n\"But doesn't our government know all this?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"That depends on what you mean by the word know,\" answered Courtney.\n\"I've made no secret of my own opinion!\"\n\n\"But they wouldn't listen?\"\n\n\"Some did, some didn't.  The Home government--which was the India\nOffice in those days--took no notice whatever.  One or two men out here\nbelieved, but I think they're dead.  When the Foreign Office took the\ncountry over I don't suppose they overhauled old reports very\ncarefully.  I dare say my letters on the subject lie inches deep in\ndust.\"\n\n\"England doesn't deserve to keep her colonies!\" vowed Fred, caught in a\nsudden flood of indignation.\n\nCourtney laughed.\n\n\"When you've seen as many of the other nations' colonies as I have\nyou'll qualify that verdict!  We do our best.  God gave us our work to\ndo, and the devil came and made us stupid!  Take this country, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" agreed Fred.  \"Take this country!  We came ashore today--left\nMonty on board ship on his way to Europe.  Nobody knew a thing about\nus.  A female woman, known to the police in Zanzibar and so notorious\nin Europe that she's in no hurry to go home--said, too, on every hand\nto be in the pay of the German government--chose to tell lies about us\nto the chuckle-headed puppies in charge of Mombasa.  Net result--what\ndo you suppose?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Courtney.  \"I've been told this evening.\"  His eyes\nchanged, and his voice took on the almost feminine note of appeal that\ncame strangely from a big game hunter.  \"You boys must overlook things.\nThese boys you're angry with are younger than you, Fred.  That\ncollector you've contrived to pick a quarrel with has fought Arabs and\ncannibal troops--odds against him of fifty or a hundred to one, mind\nyou--all across the Congo and back again.  He fought in the Uganda\nmutiny.  He's a man.  He's a merchant, though, with a merchant's\neducation.  He was taken over with the rest of the clerks when the\nBritish government superseded the British East Africa Trading Company.\nHe has never had the advantage of legal training.  Went to a common\nschool.  No advantages of any kind.  Poorly paid and overworked.\nThere's no money in the country yet.  Nobody to tax.\nSalaries--expenses and so on come from home, voted by Parliament.  As\nlong as that condition lasts they're all going to feel nervous.  They\nknow they'll get the blame for everything that goes wrong, and precious\nlittle credit in any case.  Parliament advertised the country in answer\nto their complaints of no revenue.  Parliament called for settlers.\nBut they're not ready for settlers.  They don't know how to handle\nthem.  They've no troops--nothing but a handful of black police.  How\nshall they keep in order colonials armed with repeating rifles?\nThey're not ready.  The Uganda Railway isn't finished yet; trains get\nthrough to Victoria Nyanza once a week, but there's endless work to be\ndone yet on the line, and Parliament grudges them every penny they\nspend on it.  Yet the railway was rushed through by order of Parliament\nto prevent Doctor Karl Peters and the Germans from claiming occupation\nof the head-waters of the Nile and so dominating Upper Egypt.  You boys\nmust be considerate.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Fred. \"I'll grant all that.\"\n\n\"But what gets me\"  Will interrupted, \"is that they should condemn us\nout-of-hand--on sight--untried--on the say-so of this Lady Saffren\nWaldon.  She carries German letters of credit.  She's so notoriously in\nleague with Germans that you'd think even these little Napoleons 'ud\nknow it.  I'm American myself, thank God, but these two men are their\nown kith and kin.  Why should they judge their own countrymen unheard\non the say-so of a woman like that?  That's what rattles me!\"\n\nCourtney blew six smoke rings.\n\n\"You'll have to forgive them, lad.  Too many of the Englishmen who have\ncome here were bad bats from the South, so hot-footed that they burned\nthe grass.  Then--don't forget that the Germans have a military\ngovernment to the south of us--all experienced men--a great many of\nthem unmitigated rascals, but nearly all of them clever--students of\nstrategy and psychology and tactics--some of them brilliant men who\nhave had to apply for colonial service because of debt or scandal.\nThey're overmanned where we are under-manned--backed up from home where\nour boys are only blamed and neglected--well supplied with troops and\nammunition, where our police are kept down to the danger point and now\nand then even without cartridges.  The Germans have no railway yet, but\nthey've a policy and they keep it secret.  We have a railway, and no\npolicy except retrenchment and economy.  I'm convinced the German\ngovernment has no scruples.  We have.  So you must sympathize with our\nyoung men, not quarrel with them.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" I said, \"we didn't start out to quarrel with anybody.\nThat woman lied about us.  There's no excuse for believing her without\ngiving us a hearing.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes there is.  I spoke with her myself this evening,\" said\nCourtney.  \"She's staying at my hotel, you know.  She's a match for\nmuch more experienced men than our young officials.  They've been\nfighting Arabs, not flirting.  She had the impudence to try to flatter\nme.  I don't doubt she's telling a crowd of men tonight that I'm in\nlove with her--perhaps not exactly telling them that, but giving them\nto understand it.  Why don't I stroll down to the club and deny it?\nFor the same reason that you don't openly denounce her!  It's semi- or\nwholly-sentimental chivalry--rank stupidity, if you like to call it\nthat, but it's national, I'm glad to say, and I'm as proud of it as any\none.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it look to you,\" said Fred, \"that if she and the German\ngovernment are so infernally anxious to spoil our chances--and they\nsuspect what we're after, you know--doesn't it look to you as if there\nmay really be something in this quest of ours?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Courtney.  \"There's ivory in it, tons and tons and\ntons of ivory.  Somebody will find it some day.\"\n\n\"Join us then!\" said Fred.  \"Cancel your trip to Somaliland and come\nwith us!  I can speak for Monty.  I know he'll welcome you into the\npartnership!\"\n\n\"I believe I could almost speak for Monty, too,\" laughed Courtney.  \"He\nand I were at Eton together, and we've never ceased being friends.  But\nI can't come with you.  No.  I'm making a sort of semi-official trip.\nI shall hunt, of course, but there are observations to be made.  The\npan-Islamic theory is said to be making headway also in Somaliland.\"\n\n\"Do you feel you have any lien on the Elgon Caves and Bahr el Gazal\nclues?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"No.  I make you a present of those ideas.  I'm sure I hope you find\nthe stuff.  I'm wondering, though--I'm wondering.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a dollar I'm thinking of the same thing,\" said Will.\n\n\"Out with it, then.\"\n\n\"What's to prevent the Germans from making their own dicker with the\nKing of the Belgians or with the Congo government, and rifling the\nhoard on a fifty-fifty or some such basis?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" said Courtney.  \"I confess myself puzzled about that.  But I\nknow no European politics.  There may be a thousand reasons.  And then,\nyou know, the King of the Belgians has the name of being a grasping\ndealer.  The management of his private zone on the Congo is\nunspeakable.  It's possible the Germans may prefer not to risk putting\nHis Majesty on the scent.\"\n\n\"Well, we've our work cut out,\" said Fred, laughing and yawning.  \"That\nwoman has started us off with a bad name.\"\n\n\"That is one thing I can really do for you,\" Courtney answered.  \"I've\nno official standing, but the boys all listen to me.  I'll tell them--\"\n\n\"For the love of God don't tell them too much!\" Fred exclaimed.\n\n\"I'll tell them you're friends of mine,\" he went on.  \"I believe that\nwill solve the sporting license and ammunition problem.  As for the\nwoman--if I were in your shoes I would steal a march on her.  I\nwouldn't be surprised if your licenses and ammunition permits were here\nat the hotel by ten tomorrow morning.  I see they've sent your guns\nalready.  Well, there's a train for Nairobi tomorrow noon, and not\nanother for three days.  I'd take tomorrow's train if I were you.  I\nalways find in going anywhere the start's the principal thing.  You'll\ngo?\"\n\n\"We will,\" we answered, one after the other.\n\n\"Good night, then, boys; I'll be going.\"\n\nBut we walked with him down to his hotel--I, and I think the others,\nfull to the teeth with the pleasure of knowing him, as well as of envy\nof his scars, his five or six South African campaigns, his adventures,\nand (by no means least) his unblemished record as a gentleman.  Merely\na little bit of a man with a limp, but better than a thousand men who\nlacked his gentleness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nTHE NJO HAPA SONG\n\n  Delights--ah, Ten are the dear delights (and the Book\n        forbids them, one by one)--\n  The broad old roads of a thousand loves--back turned to the\n        Law--the lawless fun--\n  Old Arts for new--old hours reborn--and who shall mourn\n        when the sands have run?\n\n        I was old when they told the Syren Tales\n        (All ears were open then!)\n        And the harps were afire with plucked desire\n        For the white ash oars again--\n        For oars and sail, and the open sea,\n        High prow against pure blue,\n        The good sea spray on eye and lip,\n        The thrumming hemp, the rise and dip,\n        The plunge and the roll of a driven ship\n        As the old course boils anew!\n\n  Sweetly I call, the captains come. The home ties draw at\n        hearts in vain.\n  Potent the spell of Africa! Who East and South the course\n        has ta'en\n  By Guardafui to Zanzibar may go, but he, shall come again.\n\n\nCourtney proved better than his word.  Our Big Game Licenses arrived\nafter breakfast, and permits for five hundred rounds of rifle\nammunition each.  In an envelope in addition was Fred's check with the\ncollector's compliments and the request that we kindly call and pay for\nthe licenses.  In other words we now had absolution.\n\nWe called, and were received as fellow men, such was the genius of\nCourtney's friendship.  A railway man looked in.  The collector's dim\noffice became awake with jokes and laughter.\n\n\"Going up today?\" he asked.  \"I'll see you get berths on the train.\"\n\nWe little realized at the moment the extent of that consideration; but\nunderstanding dawned fifteen minutes before high noon when we strolled\nto the station behind a string of porters carrying our luggage.\nCourtney was there to see us off, and he looked worried.\n\n\"I'm wondering whether you'll ever get your luggage through,\" he said\nwith a sort of feminine solicitude.  It was strange to hear the hero of\none's school-days, mighty hunter and fearless leader of forlorn\ncampaigns, actually troubled about whether we could catch our train.\nBut so the man was, gentle always and considerate of everybody but\nhimself.\n\nThere was law in this new land, at all events along the railway line.\nNot even handbags or rifles could pass by the barrier until weighed and\npaid for.  Crammed in the vestibule in front of us were fifty people\nfretfully marshalling in line their strings of porters lest any later\ncomer get by ahead of them; foremost, with his breast against the\nticket window, was Georges Coutlass.  Things seemed not to be\nproceeding as he wished.\n\nThere was one babu behind the window--a mild, unhappy-looking Punjabi,\nor Dekkani Mussulman.  There was another at the scales, who knew almost\nno English:  his duty was to weigh--do sums--write the result on a\nslip, and then justify his arithmetic to office babu and passenger,\nbefore any sort of progress could be made.  The fact that all\npassengers shouted at him to hurry or be reported to big superiors\ncomplicated the process enormously; and the equally discordant fact\nthat no passenger--and especially not Georges Coutlass--desired or\nintended to pay one anna more than he could avoid by hook, crook, or\nargument, made the game amusing to the casual looker-on, but hastened\nnothing (except tempers).  The temperature within the vestibule was\n112' by the official thermometer.\n\n\"You pair of black murderers!\" yelled Coutlass as we took our place in\nline.  \"You bloody robbers! You pickpockets!  You train-thieves!  Go\nout and dig your graves!  I will make an end of you!\"\n\n\"You should not use abusive language\" the babu retorted mildly,\nstopping to speak, and then again to wipe his spectacles, and his\nforehead, and his hands, and to glance at the clock, and to mutter what\nmay or may not have been a prayer.\n\nCoutlass exploded.\n\n\"Shouldn't, eh?  Who the hell are you to tell me what I shouldn't do?\nSell me a ticket, you black plunderer, d'you hear!  Look!  Listen!\"\n\nHe snatched a piece of paper from the babu's hand and turned to face\nthe impatient crowd.\n\n\"This hell-cat--\" (the unhappy babu looked less like a hell-cat than\nany vision of the animal I ever imagined) \"wants to make out that\nseventy-one times seven annas and three pice is forty-nine rupees,\neleven annae!  Oh, you charlatan!  You mountebank!  You black-blooded\nrobber!  You miscreant!  Cut your throat, I order you!\"\n\nThe babu expostulated, stammered, quailed.  Coutlass drew in his breath\nfor the gods of Greece alone knew what heights of fury next.  But\ninterruption entered.\n\n\"There, that's enough of you!  Get to the back of the line!\"\n\nThe man who had promised us berths came abruptly through the barrier,\nand unlike the babu did not appear afraid of any one.  The Greek let\nout his gathered breath with a bark of fury, like a seal coming up to\nbreathe.  Taking that for a symptom of opposition the newcomer, very\ncool in snow-white uniform and helmet, seized Coutlass by the neck and\nhustled him, arguing like a boiler under pressure, through the crowd.\nThe Greek was three inches taller, and six or eight inches bigger round\nthe chest, but too astonished to fight back, and perhaps, too, aware of\nthe neighborhood of old da Gama's fort, where more than one Greek was\npining for the grape and olive fields of Hellas.  With a final shove\nthe railway official thrust him well out into the road.\n\n\"If you miss the train, serve you right!\" he said.  \"Babus are willing\nservants, to be treated gently!\"\n\nThen he saw us.\n\n\"You're late!  Where's your luggage?  These your porters?  All\nright--put you on your honor.  Go on through.  Save time.  Have your\nstuff weighed, and settle the bill at Nairobi.  All of it, mind!  Babu,\nlet these people through!\"\n\nFollowed by Courtney, who seemed to have right of way wherever it\nsuited him to wander, we filed through the gate, crossed the blazing\nhot platform, and boarded a compartment labeled \"Reserved.\"  The\nrailway man nodded and left us, to hurry and help sell tickets.\n\nIt was an Indian type railway carriage be left us in, a contraption not\nill-suited to Africa--nor yet so comfortable as to diminish the\nsensation of travel toward new frontiers.\n\nEach car was divided into two compartments, entirely separate and\nentered from opposite ends; facing ours was the rear end of a\nsecond-class car, into which we could look if the doors were open and\nwe lay feet-foremost on the berths.  The berths were arranged\nlengthwise, two each side, and one above the other.\n\nIt was what they called a mixed train, mixed that is of freight and\npassengers--third-class in front, second next, then first, and a dozen\nlittle iron freight cars of two kinds in front.  In those days there\nwere neither tunnels nor bridges on that railway, and there was a\nsingle seat on the roof at each end of first- and second-class\ncompartments reached by a ladder, for any passenger enamored of the\nview.  Even the third-class compartments (and they were otherwise as\ndeliberately bare and comfortless as wood and iron could make them) had\nlattice-work shades over the upper half of the windows.\n\nFor the babu's encouragement, and to increase the panic of the\nticketless, the engineer was blowing the whistle at short intervals.\nPassengers, released in quicker order now that a white official was\nlending the two babus a hand, began coming through the barrier in\nsudden spurts, baggage in either hand and followed hot-foot by natives\nwith their heavier stuff.  They took headers into the train, and the\nporters generally came back grinning.\n\n\"I see through the whistling stunt,\" Will announced.  \"My, but that\nfellow on the engine has faith; or else the system's down real fine in\nthese parts!  He won't be back for a week.  Those woolly-headed porters\nare going to save up his commission and hand it to him when he brings\nthe down-train in!  The game's good:  he whistles--passenger\nruns--can't make change--pays two, three, four, ten times what the\njob's worth--and the porters divvy up with the engineer.  But good\nlord, the porters must be honest!\"\n\nPresently a pale white man in khaki with a red beard entered our\ncompartment, and Courtney had to make room for him on the seat.  He\napologized with less conviction of real regret than I ever remember\nnoticing, although the pouches under his eyes gave him a rather\nworld-weary look.\n\n\"Not another first-class berth on the train--every last one engaged.\nMight be worse.  Might have had to ride with Indians.  Curse of this\ncountry, Indians are.  I'd rid the land of 'em double-quick if\ngovernment 'ud pay me a rupee a head--an' I'd provide cartridges!  But\ngovernment likes 'em!  Ugh!  Ever travel in one compartment with a\ndozen of 'em?  Sleep in a tent with a score of 'em?  Share blankets\nwith a couple of 'em on a cold night?  No?  You be glad I'm not an\nIndian. One's enough!\"\n\nWe made room for his belongings, and leaned from the window all on one\nseat together.  The time to start arrived and passed; hot passengers\ncontinued spurting for the train at intervals--all sorts of\npassengers--English, Mauritius--French, Arab, Goanese, German, Swahili,\nIndian, Biluchi, one Japanese, two Chinamen, half-breeds,\nquarter-breeds of all the hues from ivory to dull red, guinea-yellow,\nand bleached out black; but the second-class compartment facing our\ndoor remained empty.  There was a name on the card in the little metal\nreservation frame, and every passenger who could read English glanced\nat it, but nobody came to claim it even when the engine's extra shrill\nscreaming and at last the ringing of a bell warned Courtney that time\nwas really up, and he got out on the platform.\n\n\"Good-by,\" he said through the window. \"I've done what I could to bring\nyou luck.  Don't be tempted to engage the first servants who apply to\nyou at Nairobi.  If you wait there a week I'll send my Kazimoto to you;\nhe's a very good gun-bearer.  He'll be out of a job when I'm gone.  I\nshall give him his fare to Nairobi.  Engage him if you want a\ndependable boy, but remember the rule about dogs:  a good one has one\nmaster!  I don't mean Kazimoto is a dog--far from it.  I mean, treat\nhim as reasonably as you would a dog, and he'll serve you well.  He's a\nfirst-class Nyamwezi, from German East.  Oh, and one more scrap of\nadvice--\":\n\nHe came close to the window, but at that moment the engine gave a final\nscream and really started.  Passengers yelled farewells. The engine's\napoplectic coughs divided the din into spasms, and there came a great\nbellowing from the ticket office.  He could not speak softly and be\nheard at all.  Louder he had to speak, and then louder, ending almost\nwith a shout.\n\n\"The best way to Elgon is by way of Kisumu and Mumias, whatever anybody\nelse may tell you.  And if you find the stuff, or any of it,\" (he was\nrunning beside the train now)--\"be in no hurry to advertise the fact!\nGo and make terms first with government--then--after you've made\nterms--tell 'em you've found it!  Find the stuff--make terms--then\nproduce what you've found!  Get my meaning?  Good-by, all.  Good luck!\"\n\nWe left him behind then, wiping the sweat from his wrinkled, freckled\nforehead, gazing after us as if we had all been lifelong friends of\nhis.  He made no distinction between us and Fred, but was equally\nanxious to serve us all.\n\n\"If that man isn't white, who is?\" demanded Will, and then there was\nnew interest.\n\nWe had left the ticket office far behind, but the train was moving\nslowly and there was still a good length of platform before our car\nwould be clear of the station altogether.  We heard a roar like a\nbull's from behind, and a dozen men--white, black and yellow--came\ncareering down the platform carrying guns, baggage, bedding, and all\nthe paraphernalia that travelers in Africa affect.\n\nFirst in the van was Georges Coutlass, showing a fine turn of speed but\ntripping on a bed-sheet at every other step, with his uncased rifle in\none hand, his hat in the other, an empty bandolier over one shoulder\nand a bag slung by a strap swinging out behind him.  He made a leap for\nthe second-class compartment in front of us, and landed on all fours on\nthe platform.  We opened the door of our compartment to watch him\nbetter.\n\nOnce on the platform he threw his rifle into the compartment and braced\nhimself to catch the things his stampeding followers hurled after\nhim--caught them deftly and tossed them in, yelling instructions in\nGreek, Kiswahili, Arabic, English, and two or three other languages.\nIt may be that the engineer looked back and saw what was happening (or\nperhaps the guard signaled with the cord that passed through eyeholes\nthe whole length of the train) for though we did not slow down we\ngained no speed until all his belongings had been hurled, and caught,\nand flung inside.  Then came his traveling companions--caught by one\nhand and dragged on their knees up the steps.  They were heavy men, but\nhe snatched all three in like a boy pulling chestnuts from the fire.\n\nThe first was a Greek--evil-looking, and without the spirit that in the\ncase of Coutlass made a stranger prone to over-look\nshortcomings--dressed in khaki, with rifle and empty bandolier.  Next,\nchin, elbow, hand and knee up the steps came a fat, tough-looking\nGoanese, dressed anyhow at all in pink-colored dirty shirt, dark pants,\nand a helmet, also with rifle and empty bandolier.  I judged he weighed\nabout two hundred and eighty pounds, but Coutlass yanked him in like a\nfish coming overside.  Last came a man who might be Arab, or part-Arab,\npart-Swahili, whom I did not recognize at first, fat, black, dressed in\nthe white cotton garments and red fez of the more or less well-to-do\nnative, and voluble with rare profanity.\n\n\"Johnson!\" shouted Fred with almost the joy of greeting an old\nacquaintance.\n\nIt was Hassan, sure enough, short-winded and afraid, but more afraid of\nbeing left behind than of the manhandling.  Coutlass took hold of his\noutstretched arm, hoisted him, cracked his shins for him against the\ntop step, and hurled him rump-over-shoulders into the compartment,\nwhere the other Greek and the Goanese grabbed him by the arms and legs\nand hove him to an upper berth, on which he lay gasping like a fish out\nof water and moaning miserably.  Their compartment was a mess of\nluggage, blankets, odds-and-ends, and angry men.  Coutlass found a\nwhisky bottle out of the confusion, and swallowed the stuff neat while\nthe other Greek and the Goanese waited their turn greedily.  There was\nnothing much in that compartment to make a man like Hassan feel at home.\n\n\"Those Greeks,\" said our red-bearded traveling companion as we shut the\ndoor again, \"are only one degree better than Indians--a shade less\ndepraved perhaps--a sight more dangerous.  I sure do hate a Punjabi,\nbut I don't love Greeks!  The natives call 'em bwana masikini to their\nfaces--that means Mister Mean White y'know.  They're a lawless lot, the\nGreeks you'll run across in these parts.  My advice is, shoot first!\nWalk behind 'em!  If they ain't armed, hoof 'em till they cut an' run!\nGreeks are no good!\"\n\nWe introduced ourselves.  He told us his name was Brown.\n\n\"There's three Browns in this country:  Hell-fire Brown of Elementaita,\nJoseph Henry Brown of Gilgil, and Brown of Lumbwa.  Brown of Lumbwa's\nme.  Don't believe a word either of the other two Browns tell you!\nYes, we're all settlers.  Country good to settle in?  Depends what you\ncall good.  If you like lots of room, an' hunting, natives to wait an'\nyour own house on your own square mile--comfortable climate--no\nconventions--nor no ten commandments, why, it's pretty hard to beat.\nBut if you want to wear a white shirt, and be moral, and get rich, it's\nrotten!  You've a chance to make money if you're not over law-abiding,\nfor there's elephants.  But if you're moral, and obey the laws, you\nhaven't but one chance, an' she's a slim one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Fred, genially, \"tell us about the only one.  We're men to\nwhom the ten commandments are--\"\n\n\"You look it!\" Brown interrupted.  \"Well, what's the odds?  You'll\nnever find it, and anyhow, everybody knows it's Tippoo Tib's ivory.  I\nmean to have a crack at spotting it myself, soon as I get my farm\nfenced an' one or two other matters attended to.  Gov'ment offers ten\nper cent. to whoever leads 'em to it, but they can't believe any one's\nas soft as that surely!  They'll be lucky if they get ten per cent. of\nit themselves!  Man alive, but they say there's a whale of a hoard of\nit!  Hundreds o' tons of ivory, all waiting to be found, and fossicked\nout, an' took!  Say--if I was some o' those Greeks for instance, tell\nyou what I'd do:  I'd off to Zanzibar, an' kidnap Tippoo Tib.  The old\ncard's still living.  I'd apply a red-hot poker to his silver-side an'\nthe under-parts o' his tripe-casings.  He'd tell me where the stuff is\nquicker'n winking!  Supposin' I was a Greek without morals or no\ncompunctions or nothin', that's what I'd do!  I don't hold with\nallowin' any man to play dog in the manger with all that plunder!\"\n\n\"Have you a notion where the stuff might be?\" Fred wondered guilelessly.\n\n\"Ah!  That 'ud be tellin'!\"\n\nWe had crossed the water that divides Mombasa from the mainland.\nBehind us lay the prettiest and safest harbor on all that\nthousand-league-long coast; before us was the narrow territory that\nstill paid revenue and owed nominal allegiance to the Sultan of\nZanzibar, although really like the rest of those parts under British\nrule.  We were bowling along beside plantations of cocoanut, peanut,\nplantain and pineapple, with here and there a thicket of strange trees\nto show what the aboriginal jungle had once looked like.  When we\nstopped at wayside stations the heat increased insufferably, until we\nentered the great red desert that divides the coast-land from the\nhills, and after that all seemed death and dust, and haziness, and hell.\n\nAt first we passed occasional baobabs, with trunks fifteen or twenty\nfeet thick and offshoots covering a quarter of an acre.  Then the trees\nthinned out to the sparse and shriveled all-but-dead things that\nstruggle for existence on the border-lines between man's land and\ndesolation.  At last we drew down the smoked panes over the window to\nescape the glare and sight of the depressing desolation.\n\nThe sun beat down on the iron roof.  The heat beat up from the tracks.\nRed dust polluted the drinking water in the little upright tank.  Dust\nfilled eyes, nostrils, hair.  Dust caked and grew stiff in the sweat\nthat streamed down us.  Yet we stopped once at a station, and humans\nlived there and a man got off the train.  A lone lean babu and his\nleaner, more miserable native crew came out and eyed the train like\nvultures waiting for a beast to die.  But we did not die, and the train\npassed on into illimitable dusty redness, leaving them to watch the hot\nrails ribbon out behind our grumbling caboose.\n\nThere began to be carousing in the second-class compartment next ahead\nof us.  Our own Brown of Lumbwa produced a stone crock of Irish whisky\nfrom a basket, imbibed copiously, offered us in turn the glistening\nneck, looked relieved at our refusal, and grew voluble.\n\n\"Hear them Greeks an' that Goa.  You'd think they were gentlemen o'\nbreeding to hear 'em carryin' on!  Truth is we've no government worth a\nmoment's consid'ration, an' everybody knows it, Greeks included!  You\nmen lookin' for farms?  Take your time!  Once you get a farm, an' get\nyour house built, an' stock bought, an' stuff planted--once you've got\nyour capital invested so to speak, they've got you!  Till then you're\nfree!  Till then they'll maybe treat you with consideration!  Till then\nyou leave the country when you like an' kiss yourselves good-by to them\nan' Africa.  Till then they've got no hold!  The courts can fine you,\nmaybe, but can they make you pay?  It's none so easy if you're half\nawake!  But take me:  Suppose I break a reggylation.  What happens?\nThey know where to find me--how much I've got--where it is--an' if I\ndon't pay the fine, they come an' collar my cattle an' sticks!  D'you\nnotice any Greeks applyin' for farms?  Not no crowds of 'em you don't!\nI don't know one single Greek who has a farm in all East Africa!  Any\nGoas?  Not a bit of it!  Any Indians?  Not one!  So when a few extry\nelephants get shot, I get the blame--down at Lumbwa, where there ain't\nno elephants; an' the Greeks, Goas, Arabs an' Indians get fat on the\nswag!  It's easy to keep track of a white man; the natives all know\nhim, an' his name, an' where he lives, an' report everything he does to\nthe nearest gov'ment officer.  But Greeks an' Goas an' Indians an'\nArabs ain't white, so the natives make no mention of 'em.  They do the\nlootin'; we settlers get the blame; an' the whole perishing country's\ngoing to blazes as fast as a lump of ice melting in hell--but not so\nfast as I'd like to see it go.  Have some o' this whisky, won't you?\"\n\nI was scarcely listening to him, but he seemed to get drunk just \"so\nfar and no further,\" and Fred found him worth attention.  It happened\nthat Fred, Will and I were all thinking of the same thing.  Will put a\nhand to his neck and stroked the little scar the Arab knife had made in\nZanzibar.\n\n\"What sort of a country's this for women?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Which women?\" Brown asked in sort of mild amazement.\n\n\"White women?\"\n\n\"Rotten!  Leastwise, there aren't any.  Yes, there's three.  Two\nofficials' wives, an' Pioneer Jane French.  Heard o' her?  Walked from\nSouth Africa, Jane did--hoofed it along o' French, bossed his boys,\ndrove the cattle, shot the meat, ran the whole shootin' match, an' runs\nhim, too, when he's sober an' she's drunk.  When they're both drunk\neverybody ducks.  She's scarcely a woman, she's sort of\nthree-men-rolled-into-one.  Give her a horsewhip ae she'll manage the\nunruliest crowd o' savages ever you or she set eyes on!  Countin' her\nas one, an' the two officials wives, an' her on this train, there's\nfour!\"\n\nOur eyes met.  I awoke to sudden interest that startled our informant\nand made him curious in turn.\n\n\"On this train?\"\n\n\"On this train. Didn't you see her?  She was watching you chaps through\nthe window slits like the Queen o' Sheba keepin' tabs on Solomon.  Say,\nwhat's she doing in this country anyhow?  I made a try to get a seat in\nher carriage, but she ordered me out like Aunt Jemima puttin' out the\ncat the last thing.  She's got a maid in with her, but the maid ain't\nwhite--Jew--Syrian--Levantine--Dago--some such breed.  She's in this\ncompartment next behind.\"\n\nOur eyes met again.  Fred laughed, and Will leaned forward to whisper\nto me:  \"She heard what Courtney said to us about the way to Mount\nElgon!\"\n\n\"D'you know her name?\" asked Brown.\n\n\"No!\" we all three lied together with one voice.\n\n\"I do!  I seen it on the reservation card.  Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon!\nPretty high-soundin' patronymic, what?  Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon!\"\nHe repeated the name over and over, crescendo, with growing fervor.\n\"What's a woman with a title doin' d'you suppose?  The title's no fake.\nShe's got the blood all right, all right!  You ought to ha' heard her\nshoo me out!  Lummy!  A nestin' hen giving the office to a snake\nweren't in it to her an' me!  Good looker, too!  What's she doin' in\nEast Africa?\"\n\nWe made no shift to answer.\n\n\"The officials' wives,\" he went on, \"are keen after Tippoo's ivory,\nbut, bein' obliged to stay in the station except when their husbands go\non safari, an' then only go where their husbands go, they've no show to\nspeak of.  Pioneer Jane's nuts on it, an' she's dangerous.  Jane's as\nlikely to find the stuff as any one.  She's independent--go where she\nblooming well pleases--game as a lioness--looks like one, too, only a\nlioness is kind o' softer an' not so quick in the uptake.  My money's\non Jane for a place.  But d'you suppose this Lady Saffren\nWhatshername's another one?  Them Greeks ahead of us I'm sure of; all\nthe Greeks in Africa are huntin' for nothin' else.  But what about the\ndame?\"\n\n\"Going to join her husband, perhaps,\" suggested Fred to put him off.\n\n\"There's no man o' that name in British East or Uganda.  I know 'em\nall--every one.\"\n\n\"Father--brother--uncle--nephew--oh, perhaps she's just traveling,\"\nsaid Fred.\n\n\"Just traveling my eye! Titled ladies don't come 'just traveling' in\nthese parts--not by a sight, they don't--not alone!\"\n\nHe helped himself to more whisky, but had reached the stage where it\nhad no further visible effect on him.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he said, wiping the neck of the jar with his hand, \"if she\nkids herself she'll be let go where she pleases--why, she kids herself!\nIt takes Pioneer Jane to trespass where writs don't run!  Jane goes\nwhere her husband don't dare follow.  The officials don't say a word.\nY'see there's no jail where they could stow a white woman and observe\nthe decencies.  So she goes over the borderline whenever she sees fit.\nThe king's writ runs maybe for thirty miles north o' this railway.\nOnce over that they can't catch you.  But unless you're a black man, or\nPioneer Jane, the natives tip the gov'ment off an' gov'ment rounds you\nup afore you get two-thirds the way.  They'll take less than half a\nchance with her ladyship or I'm a Dutchman.  Why!  How would it look to\nhave to bring her back between two native policemen?  She'll not be\nallowed five miles outside Nairobi township!\"\n\nHe up-ended his whisky again, consumed about a pint of it, and settled\ndown to sleep.  We took him by the legs and arms and threw him on the\nupper berth to stew in the cabined heat under the roof.\n\n\"It's good Monty's not with us,\" said Fred.  He sat down and laughed at\nour surprise that he should state such heresy.  \"Monty mustn't break\nlaws, but who cares if we do?\"\n\n\"Laws?\" said Will disgustedly.  \"I don't care who makes, or breaks the\nlaws of this land!  Let's beat it!  Let's join Monty in London and make\nplans for some other trip.  Everybody's after this ivory.  We haven't a\nlook-in.  Even if we knew where to look for it we'd be followed.  Let's\ntake the next train back from Nairobi, and the next boat for Europe!\"\n\nFred rubbed his hands delightedly, and stroked his beard into the neat\npoint it refuses to keep for long at a time in very hot weather.\n\n\"Let's stay in Nairobi\" he said, \"at least until Courtney sends that\nboy he promised us.  We can put in the time asking questions, and\nthen--\"\n\n\"What then?\" grumbled Will.\n\n\"There may be truth in what Brown of Lumbwa says about a dead-line.\"\n\n\"Dead-line?\"\n\n\"Beyond which the king's writ doesn't run.\"\n\n\"Betcherlife there's truth in it!\" Brown mumbled from the upper berth.\n\nWill exploded silently, going through the motions of reeling off all\nthe bad language he knew--not an insignificant performance.\n\n\"He's really asleep now,\" I said, standing on the lower berth and\nlifting the man's eyelid to make sure.\n\n\"Who cares?\" said Will. \"He's heard.  We've given the game away.  The\nwoman heard Courtney shout about how to reach Mount Elgon.  So did this\nsharp.  Now he hears Fred talk about dead-lines and the king's writ and\nbreaking laws!  The game's up!  Me for the down-train and a steamer!\"\n\nWe smoked in silence, rendered more depressing by the deepening gloom\noutside.  With the evening it grew no cooler.  What little wind there\nwas followed the train, so that we traveled in stagnation.  Utter\ndarkness brought no respite, but the fascination of flitting shadows\nand the ever-new mystery of African night.  The train drew up at last\nin a station in the shadow of great overleaning mountains, and the heat\nshut down on us like hairy coverings.  We seemed to breathe through\nthicknesses of cloth, and the very trees that cast black shadow on the\nplatform ends were stifling for lack of air.\n\n\"One hour for dinner!\" called the guard, walking limply along the train.\n\"Just an hour for dinner!  Dinner waiting!\"\n\nHe was not at all a usual-looking guard.  He was dressed in riding\nbreeches and puttee leggings, and wore a worn-out horsey air as if in\nprotest against the obligation to work in a black man's land.  In\ncountries where the half-breed and the black man live for and almost\nmonopolize government employment few white men take kindly to braid and\nbrass buttons.  That fellow's contempt for his job was equaled only by\nthe babu station master's scorn of him and his own for the station\nmaster.  Yet both men did their jobs efficiently.\n\n\"Only an hour for dinner, gents--train starts on time!\"\n\n\"Guard!\" called a female voice we all three recognized--\"Guard!  Come\nhere at once, I want you!\"\n\nWe left Brown of Lumbwa snoring a good imitation of the Battle of\nWaterloo on the upper berth, and filed out to the dimly-lighted\nplatform.  A space in the center was roofed with corrugated iron and\nunder that the yellow lamplight cast a maze of moving shadows as the\npassengers swarmed toward the dining-room.  The smell of greasy cooking\nblended with the reek of axle and lamp oil.  At the platform's forward\nend shadowy figures were throwing cord-wood into the tender, and the\nthump-thump-thump of that sounded like impatience; everything else\nsuggested lethargy.\n\n\"Guard!\" called the voice again.  \"Come here, guard!\"\n\nHe stopped in passing to close our windows and lock our compartment\ndoor against railway thieves.\n\n\"There's a man asleep in there,\" I said.\n\n\"The 'eat 'll sober 'im!\" he grinned, slamming the last window down.\n\"What'll you bet 'er 'ighness don't want me to fetch dinner to 'er?\nShe was in the train in Mombasa two hours afore startin' time, an' the\nthings she ordered me to do 'ud have made a 'alf-breed think 'e was\ndemeaning of 'imself!  I 'aven't seen the color of 'er money yet.  If\nshe wants dinner she gets out and walks or 'er maid fetches it--you\nwatch!\"\n\nCoutlass, the other Greek and the Goanese staggered out beside us on to\nthe platform, drunk enough not to know whether Hassan was with them or\nnot.  He came out and stood beside them in a sort of alert defensive\nattitude.\n\n\"Guard!\" called the voice again.  \"Where is the man?\"\n\nWe followed the last of the crowd through the screened doors, and took\nseats at a table marked \"First Class Only!\"  There were four men there\nahead of us, two government officials disinclined to talk; a\nmissionary in a gray flannel shirt, suffering from fever and too\nsuspicious to say good evening; and a man in charge of that section of\nthe line, who checked the station master's accounts and counted money\nin a tray between mouthfuls.  Between us and the second-class tables\nwas a wooden screen on short legs, and beyond that arose babel.\nSecond-class is democratic always, and talks with its mouth full.  In\naddition to our privilege of paying more for exactly the same food, we\nenjoyed exclusiveness, a dirty table-cloth, and the extra smell from\nthe kitchen door.  (The table-cloth was dirty because the barefoot\nGoanese waiters invariably stubbed their feet against a break in the\nfloor and spilt soup exactly in the same place.)\n\nWe had scarcely taken our seats when Coutlass swaggered in, closely\nfollowed by his gang.  Inside the door he turned on Hassan.\n\n\"Black men eat outside!\" he snarled, and shoved him out again backward.\nThen he came over to us and stood leering at the framed sign, \"First\nClass Only,\" avoiding our eyes, but plainly at war with us.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he growled.  \"You think you're popes or something!\nYou three would want a special private piece of earth to spit on!\"  He\nraised his voice to a sort of scream.  \"I proclaim one class only!\"\n\nAt that he lifted his foot about level with his chest and kicked the\nscreen over.  The crash brought everybody to his feet except the two\nofficials and the railway man.  They continued eating, and the railway\nman continued counting copper coins as if life depended on that alone.\n\n\"Sit down all!\" yelled Coutlass.  \"You will eat with better appetite\nnow that you can behold the blushes of these virgins!\"  Then he\nswaggered over to the long table, thrust the other Greek and the\nGoanese into chairs on either side of him, and yelled for food.  It was\nthe first time we had been referred to publicly as virgins, and I think\nwe all three felt the strain.\n\nThe Goanese manager--a wizened old black man with perfectly white\nhair--came running from the kitchen in a state of near-collapse, the\nsweat streaming off him and his hands trembling.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" he asked, almost upsetting the railway man's tray of\nmoney.  \"That man is crazy!  He came in once before and broke the\ndishes!  Twice he has come in here and eaten and refused to pay!  What\nshall I do?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the railway man.  \"Go on serving dinner.  Serve him\ntoo.\"\n\nThe manager hurried out again and the running to and fro resumed.  Then\nin came the guard.\n\n\"First-class for two on trays!\" he shouted.\n\nThe railway man beckoned to him and he winked as he passed by us.\n\n\"When you've seen to that, and had your own meal, I want you,\" said the\nrailway man.\n\n\"Thought you said the lady's maid would have to come and fetch the\nfood?\"  I said maliciously as the guard passed my chair a second time.\n\n\"So I did.  But if you know how to refuse her, just teach me!  I told\nher flat to have the maid fetch it.  She let on they're both too\nfrightened to cross the platform in the dark!  Never saw anything like\n'em!  Tears!  An' dignified!  When I climbed down they was too afraid\nnext to be left alone.  Swore train-thieves 'ud murder 'em!  I had to\nleave 'em my key to lock 'emselves in with until I come back with the\ngrub!  What d'you think of that?\"\n\nBut our soup came, and one could not think and eat that stuff\nsimultaneously.  The railway man looked up for a moment, saw my face,\nand explained in a moment of expansiveness that meat would not keep in\nthat climate but was \"perfectly good\" when cooked.\n\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"you'll get nothing more until you reach Nairobi\ntomorrow noon!\"\n\nThat turned out to be not quite true, but as an argument it worked.  We\nswallowed, like the lined-up merchant seamen taking lime-juice under\nthe skipper's eye.\n\nThe guard grew impatient and went into the kitchen, but had scarcely\ngot through the door when a scream came from the direction of the train\nthat brought him back on the run.  No black woman ever screams in just\nthat way, and in a land of black and worse-than-black men imagination\nleaps at a white woman's call for help.\n\nThere was a stampede for the door by every one except the Greeks and\nGoanese and the railway man.  (He had to guard the money.)  We poured\nthrough the screen doors, the guard fighting to burst between us, and,\nbecause with a self-preserving instinct that I have never thought quite\ncreditable to the human race, everybody ran toward his own compartment,\nit happened that we three and the two officials and the guard came\nfirst on the scene of trouble.\n\nBrown of Lumbwa was still drunk-affectionate, it seemed, by that time.\n\n\"You've no call to be 'fraid of me, li'l sweetheart!\"  The door was\nopen.  Within the compartment all was dark, but every sound emerged.\nThere came a stifled scream.\n\n\"Li'l stoopid!  What d'you come in for, if you're 'fraid o' poor ole\nBrown?  I won't hurt you.\"\n\nThe guard passed between us and went up the step.  He listened, looked,\ndisappeared through the open door, and there came a sound of struggling.\n\n\"Whassis?\" shouted Brown. \"An interloper?  No you don't!  This is my\nli'l sweetheart!  She came in to see me--didn't you, Matilda Ann?\"\n\nThe woman apparently broke free.  The guard yelled for help.  Fred and\none of the government officials were nearest and as they entered they\npassed the woman coming out.  I recognized Lady Saffren Waldon's Syrian\nmaid, with the big railway key in her fist that the guard had left with\nher.  By that time there was a considerable crowd about our car, unable\nto see much because it stood in the way of the station lamp-light.  She\nslipped through--to the right--not toward Lady Isobel's compartment,\nand I lost sight of her behind some men.  I ran after her, but she was\ngone among the shadows, and although I hunted up and down and in and\nout I could find her nowhere.\n\nWhen I returned to our car Brown of Lumbwa was out on the platform with\nhis hair all tousled and a wild eye.  The guard was wiping a bloody\nnose and everybody was inventing an account of what nobody had seen.\n\n\"Scrag him!\" advised some expert on etiquette.\n\n\"What the hell right has anybody got,\" demanded Brown with querulous\nferocity, \"to interfere between me and a lady?  Eh?  Whose compartment\nwas she in?  Me in hers or her in mine?  Eh?  Me.  I'm sleeping.\nHasn't a gent a right to sleep?  Next thing I know she's fingerin' my\nwhiskers.  How should I know she's not balmy on red beards an' makin'\nlove to me?  What right's she got in my compartment anyhow?  Who let\nher in?  Who asked her?  What if I did frighten her?  What then?\"\n\n\"Who was she?\" demanded the official.  \"Had anybody seen her before?\"\n\n\"The maid attending the lady in the next compartment,\" said I.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Positive.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Guard!  See who is in there!\"\n\nThe guard wiped blood from his nose and obeyed orders.  We clustered\nround the steps to hear.\n\n\"'Ow many's in here?\" he demanded.\n\nThere was no answer.  He tried the door and it opened 'readily.\n\n\"'Scuse me, but is there two of you?  I can't see in the dark.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that our dinner?\" said Lady Saffren Waldon's Voice.\n\n\"No ma'am, not the dinner yet.\"\n\n\"Why not, pray?\"\n\n\"There's folks accusin' your maid o' enterin' the next compartment\nan'--an'--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  My maid is here! You kept us so long waiting for dinner we\nwere both asleep!  Ah!  There's light at last, thank heaven!\"\n\nTwo native porters running along the roofs were dropping lamps into the\nholes appointed for them, and the train that had been a block of\ndarkness hewn out of the night was now a monster, many-eyed.\n\n\"They're both in there, so 'elp me!\" the guard reported, retreating\nbackward through the door and leering at us.\n\nThere remained nobody, except the still indignant Brown of Lumbwa to\nlevy charges, and the crowd remembered its dinner (not that anything\ncould be expected to grow cold in that temperature).\n\n\"The train will start on time!\" announced the babu station master, and\neverybody hurried to the dining-room.  Brown came with us, bewildered.\n\n\"How did it happen?\" he demanded.  \"When did we get here?  Why wasn't I\ncalled for dinner?  How did she get in?  Where did she go to?\"\n\n\"Oh, come and eat curried cow, it's lovely!\" answered Will.\n\nFred overtook us at the door, and whispered:\n\n\"Our things have been gone through, but I can't find that anything's\nmissing.\"\n\nWithin the dining-room was new ground for discontent.  The British race\nand its offshoots wash, but disbelieve with almost unanimity in water\nas a drink.  Every guest at either table had left at his place a partly\nemptied glass of beer, or brandy and soda, or whisky.  Each looked for\nthe glass on his return, and found it empty.\n\n\"Those Greeks!\" exclaimed the Goanese manager, with a fearful air, and\nshoulders shrugged to disclaim his own responsibility.\n\nCoutlass and the other Greek were sitting at a table with a gorged\nlook, glancing neither to the right nor left, yet not eating.  I looked\nat the railway official, who had not left his seat.  It struck me he\nwas laughing silently, but he did not look up.  The crowd, after the\nmanner of all crowds, stormed at the Goanese manager.\n\n\"What can I do?  What shall I do?\" wailed the unhappy little man.\n\"They are bigger than I!  They were greedy!  They took!\"\n\nAll those charges were evidently true, and stated mildly.  Coutlass\nrose to his feet.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he thundered, and his stomach stuck out over the table\nit was so full of various drinks.  \"Why should we not take?  Who isn't\nthirsty in this hell of a place?  Who leaves good drink deserves to\nlose it!\"\n\n\"What shall I do?\" wailed the Goanese manager.\n\n\"Take the orders for drinks again,\" said the railway man, glancing up\nfrom his figures. \"Bring the account to me.\"\n\nThe waiters ran to fill orders, and a babel of abuse at the second\ntable was hurled at Coutlass and his friends; but they did not leave\nthe table because there was another course to come, and, as the manager\nhad said, they were greedy.  Then in came the guard, his face a\nblood-and-smudgy picture of discontent.\n\n\"Say!\" he yelled.  \"Ain't I goin' to get those two first-classes on\ntrays?\"  He came and stood by us.  \"Did you ever 'ear the likes of it?\nThey swear neither of 'em was out of the compartment.  They call me a\nliar for askin' for my key back!  They swear I never gave it to 'em,\n'an they never asked for it, an' their door was never locked, nor\nnothin'!\"\n\nHe passed on to the railway man.\n\n\"I'll have to borry your key, sir.  Mine's lost.  Can't open doors\nuntil I get one from somewhere.\"\n\nThe railway man passed him his key with a bored expression and no\nremark.\n\n\"Don't forget that I want you presently,\" he ordered.  \"Be quick and\nget your own dinner.\"\n\n\"I'm in love with this ivory hunt!\" Fred whispered to us across the\ntable.  \"If she's sure our pockets are worth going through, I'm sure\nthere's something to look for!\"\n\n\"Are you sure the maid went through our things?\" asked Will.\n\n\"Quite.  I left my shooting jacket hanging on a hook.  Everything was\nemptied out of the pockets on to the berth.\"\n\n\"I think I'll make you a confession presently,\" said I, with a look at\nWill that just then he did not understand.\n\n\"Never confess before dessert and coffee!\" advised Fred.  \"It spoils\nthe appetite.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n\nTHE SLAVE GANGS\n\n  Our fathers praised the old accustomed things,\n        The privilege of chiefs, the village wall\n  Within whose circling dark Monumme* sings\n        O' nights of belly-full and ease and all\n  They taught us we should prize and praise\n        (Only of dearth and pestilence should be our fears;)\n  And now behind us are the green, regretted days.\n        The water in the desert is our tears.\n                Then ye, who at the waters drink\n                Of Freedom, oh with Pity think\n                On us, who face the desert brink\n                Your fathers entered willingly.\n\n  Our fathers mocked the might of the Unseen,\n        Teaching that only what we saw and felt\n  Was good to fight about--what aye had been,\n        Old-fashioned foods that their forefathers smelt,\n  Old stars each night illuming the old sky,\n        The warm rain softening ere women till the ground,\n  The soft winds singing, only ask not why!\n        And now our weeping is the desert sound.\n                Oh ye, who gorge the daily good,\n                Unquestioned heirs of all ye would,\n                Spare not too timidly the blood\n                Your fathers shed so willingly.\n\n  Our fathers taught us that the village good was best.\n        Later we learned the red, new tribal creed\n  That our place was the sun--night owned the rest\n        Unless their treasure profited our greed!\n  But now we gather nothing where our fathers sowed,\n        For harvest grim the vultures wait in rows\n  As, urged by greedier than us with gun and goad,\n        Yoked two by two the slave safari goes.\n                Oh ye, who from true judgment shrink,\n                Nor gentleness with courage link,\n                Be thoughtful when the cup ye drink\n                Your fathers spilled so willingly.\n\n----------\n* Monumme (Kiswahili)--Lit. male-man in his prime.\n----------\n\nThe guard procured his trays at last, delivered them at a run, returned\nin a hurry and swallowed his own meal at a side-table.  Then, with his\nmouth full, he reported for orders to the railway official, who was\nstill checking figures.  The room was beginning to grow empty.\nCoutlass and his Greek friend and the Goanese sat almost alone at the\nfar end of the other table, finishing their pudding.  I had not noticed\nuntil then that the guard was a singularly little man.  He stood very\nfew inches taller than the seated official.  I suppose that hitherto in\nsome way his energy had seemed to increase his inches.\n\n\"Are there handcuffs in the caboose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Fetch them.\"\n\nIn spite of Brown of Lumbwa's protests, who wept at the notion of\nhaving to eat alone, we were in the act of settling our bills and\ngoing.  But mention of handcuffs suggesting entertainment, we lit\ncigars and, imagining we stayed for love of him, Brown cooed at us.\n\n\"I've the darbies in my pocket, sir!\"\n\nI thought the guard looked more undersized than ever.  He would have\nmade a fair-sized middle-weight jockey.\n\n\"Tell that Greek--Coutlass his name is--to come here.\"\n\nWith his tongue stuck into his cheek and a wink at us the guard obeyed.\n\n\"He says for you to go to 'ell, sir!\" he reported after a moment's\ninterview.\n\n\"Very well. Arrest him!\"\n\n\"He'll need help,\" I interrupted.  \"My two friends and I--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no,\" said the official. \"He is fully up to his work.\"\n\nSo we moved our chairs into position for a better view.\n\nThe guard advanced fox-terrierwise to within about six paces of\nCoutlass.\n\n\"Up with both your 'ands, Thermopylea!\" he snapped.  \"Your bloomin'\nreckonin's come!\"\n\nCoutlass showed tobacco-stained teeth for answer, and his friends\nrutched their chairs clear of the table, ready for action.  Yet they\nwere taken unawares.  With a terrier's speed the guard pounced on\nCoutlass, seized him by the hair and collar, hurled him, chair and all,\nunder a side-table, and was on the far side of the table kicking his\nprostrate victim in the ribs before either Greek or Goanese--likewise\nupset in the sudden onslaught--could gather themselves and interfere.\n\nThe Goanese was first on his feet.  He hurled a soda-water bottle.  The\nguard ducked and the bottle smashed into splinters on the wall.  Before\nthe sound of smashing glass had died the Goanese was down again, laid\nout by blows on the nose and jugular.  Then again the guard kicked\nCoutlass, driving him back under the table from which he was trying to\nemerge on all fours.\n\nThe second Greek looked more dangerous.  His face grew dark with rage\nas the lips receded from his yellow teeth.  He reached toward his boot,\nbut judged there were too many witnesses for knife work and rushed in\nsuddenly, yelling something in Greek to Coutlass as he picked up a\nchair to brain the guard with.  He swung the chair, but the guard met\nit with another one, dodged him, and tripped him as he passed.  In\nanother second it was his turn to be kicked in the ribs until he yelled\nfor mercy.  (An extra large dinner and all those assorted drinks in\naddition to what they had had in the train made neither man's wind\ngood.)\n\nNo mercy was forthcoming.  He was kicked, more and more violently,\nuntil the need of crawling through the door to safety dawned on his\nmuddled wits and he made his exit from the room snake fashion.  By that\ntime Coutlass was on his feet, and he too elected to force the issue\nwith a chair.  The guard sprang at the chair as Coutlass raised it,\nbore it down, and drove his fist hard home into the Greek's right eye\nthree times running.\n\n\"'Ave you 'ad enough?\" he demanded, making ready for another assault.\nThe Goanese had recovered and staggered to his feet to interfere, but\nCoutlass yielded.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"why should I fight a little man?  I surrender to\nsave bloodshed!\"\n\n\"Put your 'ands out, then!\"\n\nCoutlass obeyed, and was handcuffed ignominiously.\n\n\"Outside, you!\"\n\nA savage kick landed in exactly the place where the Goanese least\nexpected and most resented it.  He flew through the door as if the\ntrain had started, and then another kick jolted Coutlass.\n\n\"Forward, march!  Left-right-left-right!\"\n\nWith hands manacled in front and the inexorable bantam guard behind,\nCoutlass came and stood before the railway official, who at last\ncondescended not to seem engrossed in his accounts.\n\n\"'Ere he is, sir!\"\n\n\"I suppose you know, my man, that I have magisterial powers on this\nrailway?\" said the official.\n\nCoutlass glowered but said nothing.\n\n\"This is not the first time you have made yourself a nuisance.  You\nbroke dishes the last time you were here.\"\n\n\"That is long ago,\" Coutlass objected.  \"That was on the day the place\nwas first opened to the public.  There was a celebration.  Every one\nwas drunk.\"\n\n\"You broke plates and refused to pay the damage!'\n\n\"Officials were drunk.  I saw them!\"\n\n\"The damage amounted to seventeen rupees, eight annas.\"\n\n\"Gassharamminy!  All the crockery from Mombasa to Nairobi isn't worth\nthat amount!  I shall not pay!\"\n\n\"Now there's another bill for those drinks you and your friends stole\nwhen passengers' backs were turned.  I saw you do it!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you object at the time?\" sneered Coutlass.\n\n\"Here is the bill:  twenty-seven rupees, twelve annas.  Total,\nforty-five rupees, four annas.  You may make the manager a present of\nthe odd sum for his injured feelings, and call it an even fifty.\nSettle now, or wait here for the down-train and go to jail in Mombasa!\"\n\n\"Wait in this place?\" asked Coutlass, aghast.\n\n\"Where else?  There'll be a down passenger train in a week.\"\n\n\"I pay!\" said the Greek, with a hideous grimace.\n\n\"Take the irons off him, then.\"\n\nThe guard unlocked the handcuffs and Coutlass began to fumble for a\nmoney-bag.\n\n\"Give me a receipt!\" he demanded, thumbing out the money.\n\n\"You are the receipt!\" said the official.  \"An Englishman would have\nbeen sent to jail with a fine, and have paid the bill into the bargain.\nYou're treated leniently because you can't be expected to understand\ndecent behavior.  You're expected to learn, however.  Next time you\nwill catch it hot!\"\n\n\"All aboard!\" called the guard cheerfully. \"All aboard!\"\n\n\"Tears, idle tears!\" said Brown of Lumbwa, taking my arm and Fred's.\n\n\"Thass too true--too true!  They'd have jailed an Englishman--me,\nf'rinstance.  One little spree, an' they'd put me in the Fort!  One\nli'l indishcresshion an' they'd jug me for shix months!  Him they let\ngo wi' a admonisshion!  It's 'nother case o' Barabbas, an' a great\nshame, but you can't change the English.  They're ingcorridgible!\nBrown o' Lumbwa's my name,\" he added by way of afterthought.\n\n\"Take advice and get under blankets afore you go to sleep, gents!\"\nwarned the guard.  All windows were once more opened wide, and every\none was panting.\n\n\"A job on this 'ere line's a circus!\" he grinned.  \"I'm lucky if\nthere's only one fight before Nairobi!  'Ave your blankets ready,\ngents!  Cover yourselves afore you sleep!\"\n\nThat sounded like a joke.  The sweat poured from every one in streams.\nThe hot hair cushions were intolerable.  The dust gathered from the\ndesert stirred and hung, and there was neither air to breathe nor\ncoolness under all those overhanging mountains.\n\n\"Get under your blankets, gents!\" advised the guard, passing down the\ntrain; and then the train started.\n\nI had the upper berth opposite Brown's, where it was hottest of all\nbecause of the iron roof.  Drunk though he was, I noticed that the\nfirst thing Brown did after we had hoisted him aloft was to dig among\nthe blankets like a dog and make the best shift he could of crawling\nunder them.  With one blanket twisted about his neck and shoulders and\nthe other tangled about his knees he remarked to the roof that his name\nwas Brown of Lumbwa, and proceeded to sob himself to sleep.  He had\nmade the journey a dozen times, so knew what he was doing.  I drew on\nmy own blankets, and stifling, blowing out red dust, remembered a\npromise.\n\n\"Will!\" I said.  \"Tell Fred what happened to us in Zanzibar while he\nand Monty viewed the moon!\"\n\n\"We agreed not to,\" he answered, but it seemed to me he might arouse\nhis own enthusiasm if he did tell.\n\n\"Who's afraid of Fred?\" said I.\n\nThat settled it.\n\n\"One of you shall tell before you sleep!\" Fred announced, sitting up.\n\"Who feareth not God nor regardeth me will blench before the prospect\nof a sleepless night!  Speak, America!\"\n\nHe took out a cleaning rod from his gun-case, and proceeded to stir\nWill's ribs and whack his feet.  In a minute there was a\nrough-house--panting, and bursts of laughter--cracks of the cleaning\nrod on Will's bare legs--the sound of hands slipping on sweaty arms--and\n\n\"Murder!\" yelled Brown of Lumbwa, waking up.  \"Murder!  Oh, mur-durrr!\"\n\n\"Shut up, you fool!\"  I shouted at him.  But he only yelled the louder.\n\n\"I knew these tears were not for nothing!\" he wailed.  \"It was\npremonition!  Pass me the whisky!  Pass it up here!  Oh, look!  They're\nat each other's throats!  Murder!  Oh, mur-durrr! Pass the whisky or\nI'll come down and kill everybody in self-defense! Murrrrr-durrr!\"\n\nThey stopped fooling because his idiotic screams could be heard all\ndown the train.\n\n\"There,\" said Brown, \"you see, I've saved two worthless lives!  Very\nfoolish of me!  Pass the whisky!  See that I save a little for the\nmorning!\"\n\nAt that he fell asleep again; and because Fred threatened to start new\ncommotion and wake him unless Will or I confessed at once, Will took up\nthe tale, I leaning over the edge of my berth to prompt him.  Fred\nlaughed all through the story, and finally crawled under his blanket\nagain to lie chuckling at the underside of Brown of Lumbwa's berth.\n\n\"I don't see what we've scored by telling him,\" said Will to me.\n\"We've merely given him a peg to hang jokes on!\"\n\nBut I knew that now Will had told the story he would not, for very\nshame, withdraw from the venture until we should have demonstrated that\nno Lady Saffren Waldon, nor Sultan of Zanzibar, nor Germans, nor Arabs\ncould make us afraid.  And it seemed to me that was sufficient\naccomplishment for one night.\n\nThe train's progress slowed and grew slower.  The panting of the engine\ncame back to us in savage blasts.  We were climbing by curves and\nzigzags up the grim dark wall of mountains.  And as we mounted inch by\ninch, foot by foot, the air freshened and grew cooler--not really cool\nyet by a very Jacob's ladder of degrees, but delectable by comparison.\n\nThere was something peacefully exhilarating in the thought of rising\nfrom the red dead level of that awful plain, littered with the bones of\ncamels and the slaves whom men pinned into the yokes to perish or\nsurvive in twos.*  As we mounted foot by foot we fell asleep.  Later,\nas we mounted higher, we shivered under blankets.  There is a spirit\nand a spell of Africa that grip men even in sleep.  The curt engine\nblasts became in my dreams the panting of enormous beasts that fought.\nA dream-continent waged war on itself, and bled.  I saw the caravans\ngo, thousands long, the horsed and white-robed Arab in the lead--the\npaid, fat, insolent askaris, flattering and flogging--slaves burdened\nwith ivory and other, naked, new ones, two in a yoke, shivering under\nthe askari's lash, the very last dogged by vultures and hyenas, lean as\nthey, ill-nourished on such poor picking.\n\n-----------\n* It was the cheerful Arab rule never to release one slave from the\nyoke if the other failed on the journey, on the principle that then the\nstronger would be more likely to care for, encourage, and drive the\nweaker.\n-----------\n\nThen I saw elephants in herds five thousand strong that screamed and\nstormed and crashed, flattening out villages in rage that man should\ninterfere with them--in fear of the ruthless few armed men with rifles\nin their rear.  Whole herds crashed pell-mell through artfully staged\nundergrowth into thirty-foot-deep pits, where they lingered and died of\nthirst, that Arabs (who sat smoking within hail until they died) might\nhave the ivory.\n\nAnd all I saw in my dream was nothing to the things I really was to\nsee.  None of the cruelty of man, none of the rage and fear of animal\nhave vanished yet from Africa.  Some of the cruelty is more refined;\nsome of the herds are smaller; some good is making headway but Africa\nis unchanged on the whole.  It is a land of nightmares, with lovely\noases and rare knights errant; a land whose past is gloom, whose\npresent is twilight and uncertainty, but whose future under the rule of\nhumane men is immeasurable, unimaginable.\n\nIn my dream din followed crash and confusion until the engine's\nscreaming at last awoke me.  My blanket had fallen to the floor and I\nwas shivering from cold.  I jumped down to recover it and realized it\nwas dawn already.  We were bowling along at a fine pace past green\ntrees and undulating veld, and I wondered why the engine should keep on\nscreaming like a thing demented.  I knelt on Fred's berth to lean from\nthe window and look ahead.  We were going round a slight curve and I\ncould see the track ahead for miles.\n\nThree hundred yards away a full-grown rhinoceros stood planted on the\ntrack, his flank toward us and his interest fixed on anything but\ntrains.  He was sniffing the cool morning, looking the other way.\n\n\"Wake up, you fellows!\" I yelled, and Fred and Will put their heads\nthrough the window beside me just in time to see the rhino take notice\nof the train at last.  When the engine was fifty yards from him he\nwheeled, took a short-sighted squint at it, sniffed, decided on war,\nand charged.  The engineer crowded on steam.\n\n\"He's a game enough sport!\" chuckled Fred.\n\n\"He's a fool!\" grinned Will.\n\nHe was both, but he never flinched.  He struck the cow-catcher head-on\nand tried to lift it sky-high.  The speed and weight of the engine sent\nhim rolling over and over off the track, and the shock of the blow came\nbackward along the train in thunderclaps as each car felt the check.\nThe engineer whistled him a requiem and a cheer went up from fifty\nheads thrust out of windows.  But he was not nearly done for.\n\nHe got up, spun around like a polo pony to face the train, deliberately\npicked out level going, and charged again.  This time he hit the car we\nwere in, and screams from the compartment behind us gave notice that\nLady Saffren Waldon's maid was awake and looking through a window too.\nHe hit the running-board beside the car, crumpled it to matchwood,\nlifted the car an inch off the track, but failed to disrail us.  The\ncar fell back on the metal with a clang, and the rhino recoiled\nsidewise, to roll over and over again.  This time the impetus sent him\nover the edge of a gully and we did not doubt he was dead at the bottom\nof it.\n\nThe guard stopped the train and came running to see what the damage\namounted to.\n\n\"Any gent got his rifle handy?\" he shouted.  \"The train's ahead o'\ntime.  There's twenty minutes for sport!\"\n\nWe dived for our rifles, but Coutlass had his and was on the track\nahead of us, his eye a ghastly sight from the guard's overnight\nattentions, his face the gruesome color of the man who has eaten and\ndrunk too much, but his undamaged eye ablaze, and nothing whatever the\nmatter with his enthusiasm.\n\n\"Give me a cartridge--a cartridge, somebody!\" he yelled. \"Gassharamminy!\nHe's not dead!  I saw him kick as he went over the edge legs upwards!\nGive me one cartridge and I'll finish him!\"\n\nBy that time every male passenger was out on the track, some in\nnight-shirts, some in shirts and pants, some with next-to-nothing at\nall on, but nearly all with guns.  Somebody gave Coutlass a handful of\ncartridges that fitted his Mauser rifle and he was off in the lead like\na hero leading a forlorn hope, we after him.  We searched high and low\nbut lost all trace of the rhino, and at the end of half an hour the\nengine's whistle called us back.  There were blood and hair all over\nthe engine--blood and hair on our car, but the rhino had been as\ndetermined in defeat as in attack, and if he died of his wounds he\ncontrived to do it alone and in dignity.\n\n\"That leaves Coutlass with six cartridges,\" said I, overtaking Fred.\n\"Let's hope their owner asks for them back.\"\n\nThe owner did ask for them.  He stood with his hand out by the door of\nthe Greek's compartment.\n\n\"You didn't use those cartridges,\" he said.\n\n\"But I will!\" sneered Coutlass.  \"Out of my way!\"\n\nHe sprang for his door and slammed it in the man's face, and the other\nGreek and the Goanese jeered through the window.  I caught sight of\nHassan beside them looking gray, as unhappy black men usually do.  Will\nsaw him too.\n\n\"The cannibal's ours,\" he said, \"supposing we want him and play our\ncards kind o' careful.\"\n\nThe next thing to delay the train was an elephant, who walked the track\nahead of us and when the engine whistled only put on speed.  Hypnotized\nby the tracks that reached in parallel lines to the horizon, with trunk\noutstretched, ears up, and silly tail held horizontally he set himself\nthe impossible task of leaving us behind.  The more we cheered, the\nmore the engine screamed, the fiercer and less dignified became his\nefforts; he reached a speed at times of fourteen or fifteen miles an\nhour, and it was not until, after many miles, he reached a culvert he\ndared not cross that he switched off at right angles.  Realizing then\nat last that the train could not follow him to one side he stood and\nwatched us pass, red-eyed, blown and angry.  He had only one tusk, but\nthat a big one, and the weight of it caused him to hold his head at a\ndrunken-looking angle.\n\n\"Stop the train!\" yelled Coutlass, brandishing his rifle as he climbed\nto the seat on the roof. But the guard, likewise on the roof at his end\nof the train, gave no signal and we speeded on.  We were already in the\nworld's greatest game reserve, where no man might shoot elephant or any\nother living thing.\n\nWe began to pass herds of zebra, gnu, and lesser antelope--more than a\nthousand zebra in one herd--ostriches in ones and twos--giraffes in\nscared half-dozens--rhinoceros--and here and there lone lions.\nScarcely an animal troubled to look up at us, and only the giraffes ran.\n\nWatching them, counting them, distinguishing the various breeds we\nthree grew enormously contented, even Will Yerkes banishing depression.\nObviously we were in a land of good hunting, for the strictly policed\nreserve had its limits beyond which undoubtedly the game would roam.\nThe climate seemed perfect.  There was a steady wind, not too cold or\nhot, and the rains were recent enough to make all the world look green\nand bounteous.\n\nTo right and left of us--to north and south that is--was wild mountain\ncountry, lonely and savage enough to arouse that unaccountable desire\nto go and see that lurks in the breast of younger sons and all\ntrue-blue adventurers.  We got out a map and were presently tracing on\nit with fingers that trembled from excitement routes marked with tiny\nvague dots leading toward lands marked \"unexplored.\"  There were vast\nplateaus on which not more than two or three white men had trodden, and\nmountain ranges almost utterly unknown--some of them within sight of\nthe line we traveled on.  If the map was anything to go by we could\nreach Mount Elgon from Nairobi by any of three wild roads.  Fred and I\nunderscored the names of several places with a fountain pen.\n\n\"And say!\" said Will.  \"Look out of the window!  If we once got away\ninto country like that, who could follow us!\"\n\n\"But you can't get away!\" said a. weary voice from the upper berth.\n\"I'm Brown of Lumbwa.  That's my name, gents, and I know, because I\ntried!  Thought I was sound asleep, didn't you!  Well, I weren't!\nListen to me, what happens.  You start off.  They get wind of it.  They\nsend the police helter-skelter hot-foot after you--native police--no\nofficer--Masai they are, an' I tell you those Masai can make their\nsixty miles a day when they're minded an' no bones about it either!\nMaybe the Masai catches you and maybe not.  S'posing they do they can't\ndo much.  They've merely a letter with 'em commanding you to return at\nonce and report at the gov'ment office.  And o' course--bein' ignorant,\nsame as me, an' hot-headed, an' eager--you treat that contumelious an'\ntip the Masai the office to go to hell.  Which they do forthwith.\nThey're so used to bein' told to go to hell by wishful wanderers that\nthey scarcely trouble to wait for the words.  Presently they draw a\nlong breath an' go away again like smoke being blowed downwind.  An'\nyou proceed onward, dreamin' dreams o' gold an' frankincense an'\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\" said I, for he made a long pause, either for\nreminiscence or because of headache.\n\n\"Whisky next!\" he answered.  \"I left a little for the morning, didn't\nI?  I almost always do.  Hold the bottle up to the light--no, no,\nyou'll spill it!--pass it here!  Ah-h-h--gug-gug!\"\n\nHe finished what was left and tried to hurl the empty bottle through\nthe window, but missed and smashed it against the woodwork.\n\n\"'Sapity!\" he murmured.  \"Means bad luck, that does!  Poor ole Brown o'\nLumbwa--poor ole fella'.  Pick up the pieces, boys!  Pick 'em up\nquick--might get some o' poor ole Brown's bad luck--cut yourselves or\nwhat not.  Pick 'em up careful now!\"\n\nWe did, and it took ten minutes, for the splinters were scattered\neverywhere.\n\n\"Next time you do a thing like that you shall get out an' walk!\"\nannounced Fred.\n\n\"That 'ud be only my usual luck!\" he answered mournfully.  \"But I was\ntellin' how you notify the Masai police to go to hell, an' they oblige.\nIt's the last obligin' anybody does for you.  Every native's a bush\ntelegraph--every sleepy-seemin' one of 'em!  They know tracks in an'\nout through the scrub that ain't on maps, an' they get past you day or\nnight wi'out you knowin' it, an' word goes on ahead o' you--precedes\nyou as the sayin' is.  You come to a village.  You need milk, food,\nPorters maybe, an' certainly inf'mation about the trail ahead.  You\nask.  Nobody answers.  They let on not to sling your kind o' lingo.\nMilk--never heard o' such stuff--cows in them parts don't give milk!\nFood?  They're starving.  It isn't overeating makes their bellies big,\nit's wind.  Porters?  All the young men are lame, an' old 'uns too old,\nan' the middle 'uns too middle-aged--an' who ever heard of a native\nwoman workin' anyhow.  Who tills the mtama patch, then?  It don't get\ntilled, or else the women only 'tend to it at tillin' time.  Nobody\nworks at anythin' about the time you come on the scene, for work ain't\nmoral, pleasin' nor profitable, an' there you are!  As for the trail\nahead, lions an' cannibals are the two mildest kind of calamities they\nguarantee you'll meet.\"\n\n\"You don't have to believe them,\" I argued.  \"No man in his senses\nwould start without porters of his own--\"\n\n\"Who never run away, an' never, oh never go lame o' course!\" said Brown.\n\n\"Porters enough and to spare,\" I continued.  \"And food for a month or\ntwo--\"\n\n\"How are you going to get away right under their noses with food for a\nmonth or two?\" demanded Brown.  \"You've got to live off the country\nafter a certain distance.  The further you go, the worse for you, for\nthey'll sell you nothing and give you less.  By and by your porters get\ntipped off by the natives of some village you spend a night at.  You\nlook for 'em next mornin' and where are they?  Gone!  There are their\nloads, an' no one to carry 'em!  You've got to leave your loads an'\nreturn, an' the police you told so stric'ly to go to hell meet you with\nbroad grins and lead you to the gov'ment office.  There the collector,\nor, what's worse, the 'sistant collector, gives you a lecture on infamy\nan' the law of doin' as you'd be done by.  You ask for your loads back,\nan' he laughs at you.  An' that's all about it, excep' that next time\nyou happen to want a favor done you by gov'ment you get a lecture\ninstead!  No, you can't get away, an' it's no use tryin'!  If you was\nGreeks maybe, or Arabs, yes.  Bein' English, the Indian Penal Code,\nwhich is white man's law in these parts, 'll get you sure!\"\n\nBrown of Lumbwa sighed at recollection of his wrongs, turned over, and\nwent to sleep again. The train bowled along over high veld, cutting in\nhalf magnificent distances and stopping now and then at stations whose\nexcuse for existence was unimaginable.  We stopped at a station at last\nwhere the Hindu clerk sold tea and biscuits.  The train disgorged its\npassengers and there was a scramble in the tiny ticket office like the\nrush to get through turnstiles at a football game at home, only that\nthe crowd was more polyglot and less good-natured.\n\nCoutlass, his Greek friend and the Goanese being old travelers on that\nroute were out of the train first, first into the room, and first\nsupplied with breakfast.  Fred and I were nearly last.  Brown of Lumbwa\nrefused to leave his berth but lay moaning of his wrongs, and the\niniquity of drink not based on whisky.  I missed Will in the scramble,\nand although it was nearly half an hour before I got served I did not\ncatch sight of him in all that time.\n\nI counted eleven nations taking tea in that tiny room and there were\nmembers of yet other tribes strolling the platform, holding themselves\naloof with the strange pride of the pariah the wide world over.\n\nWhen Will came in he was grinning, and his ears seemed to stick out\nmore than usual, as they do when he is pleased with himself.\n\n\"Didn't I say fat Johnson was ours if we'd play our cards right?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"You mean Hassan?\"\n\n\"He'd had no breakfast.  He'd had no supper.  He had no money.  The\nGreeks took away what little money he did have on the pretext that he\nmight buy a return ticket and desert them.  They seem to think that a\nday or two's starvation might make him good and amenable.  I found him\ntrying to beg a bite from a full-blooded Arab, and say! they're a\nloving lot.  The Arab spat in his eye!  I offered to buy him eats but\nhe didn't dare come in here for fear the Greeks 'ud thrash him, so I\nslipped him ten rupees for himself and he's the gratefulest fat black\nman you ever set eyes on.  You bet it takes food and lots of it to keep\nthat belly of his in shape.  There's a back door to this joint.  He\nslipped round behind and bribed the babu to feed him on the rear step,\nme standing guard at the corner to keep Greeks at bay.  He's back in\nthe car now, playing possum.\"\n\n\"Let's trade him for Brown of Lumbwa,\" suggested Fred genially.  \"Call\nhim into our car and kick Brown out!\"\n\n\"Trade nothing!  I tell you the man is ours!  Call him, and he'll\nbargain.  Let him be, and the next time the Greeks ill-treat him he'll\ncome straight to us in hope we'll show him kindness.\"\n\n\"Swallow your tea quickly, Solomon!\" Fred advised him.  \"There goes the\nwhistle!\"\n\nIt was fresh tea, just that minute made for him.  Will gulped down the\nscalding stuff and had to be thumped on the back according to Fred.\nWith eyes filled with water he did not see what I did, and Fred was too\nbusy guarding against counter-blows.  The most public place and the\nvery last minute always suited those two best for playing horse.\n\n\"Thought you said Johnson was asleep,\" said I.\n\n\"Possuming,\" coughed Will.  \"Shamming sleep to fool the Greeks.\"\n\n\"Possuming, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but the Greeks are on.  He has just\ncome scurrying out of Lady Saffren Waldon's compartment.  The Greeks\nwatched him and made no comment!\"\n\nWe piled into our own appointed place and sat for a while in silence.\n\n\"All right,\" said Will at last, lighting his pipe.  \"I own I felt like\nquitting once.  I'll see it through now if there's no ivory and nothing\nbut trouble!  That dame can't thimblerig me!\"\n\n\"We're supposed to know where the ivory is,\" grinned Fred.  \"Keep it\nup!  They'll hunt us so carefully that they'll save us the trouble of\nwatching them!\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to think we do know where the ivory is,\" said I.  \"I\nbelieve it's on Mount Elgon and they mean to prevent our getting it.\"\n\n\"If that turns out true, we'll have to give them the slip, that's all,\"\nsaid Fred, and got out his concertina.  Just as Monty always played chess\nwhen his brain was busy, Fred likes to think to the strains of his\ninfernal instrument.  One could not guess what he was thinking about,\nbut the wide world knew he was perplexed, and Lady Saffren Waldon in\nthe next compartment must have suffered.\n\nAfter a while he commenced picking out the tunes of comic songs, and\nbefore long chanced on one that somebody in the front part of the train\nrecognized and began to sing.  In ten minutes after that he was playing\naccompaniments for a full train chorus and the scared zebra and impala\nbolted to right and left, pursued by Tarara-boom-de-ay,\nTing-a-ling-a-ling, and other non-Homeric dirges that in those days\nwere dying an all-too-lingering death.\n\nIt was to the tune of After the Ball that the engine dipped\nhead-foremost into a dry watercourse, and brought the train to a\njaw-jarring halt.  The tune went on, and the song grew louder, for\nnobody was killed and the English-speaking races have a code,\ncontaining rules of conduct much more stringent than the Law of the\nMedes and Persians.  Somebody--probably natives from a long way off,\nwho needed fuel to cook a meal--had chopped out the hard-wood plate on\nwhich the beams of a temporary culvert rested.  Time, white ants,\ngravity and luck had done the rest.  It was a case thereafter of walk\nor wait.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you?\" moaned Brown of Lumbwa.  \"Didn't I say walkin' 'ud\nbe only just my luck?\"\n\nSo we walked, and reached Nairobi a long way ahead of Coutlass and his\ngang, whose shoes, among other matters, pinched them; and we were\ncomfortably quartered in the one hotel several hours before the arrival\nof Lady Saffren Waldon and those folk who elected to wait for the\nbreakdown gang and the relief train.\n\nIt was a tired hotel, conducted by a tired once-missionary person, just\nas Nairobi itself was a tired-looking township of small parallel roofs\nof unpainted corrugated iron, with one main street more than a mile\nlong and perhaps a dozen side-streets varying in length from fifty feet\nto half a mile.\n\nHe must have been a very tired surveyor who pitched on that site and\nmarked it as railway headquarters on his map.  He could have gone on\nand found within five miles two or three sightlier, healthier spots.\nBut doubtless the day's march had been a long one, and perhaps he had\nfever, and was cross.  At any rate, there stood Nairobi, with its\n\"tin-town\" for the railway underlings, its \"tin\" sheds for the repair\nshops, its big \"tin\" station buildings, and its string of\npleasant-looking bungalows on the only high ground, where the\ngovernment nabobs lived.\n\nThe hotel was in the middle of the main street, a square frame building\nwith a veranda in front and its laundry hanging out behind.  Nairobi\nbeing a young place, with all Africa in which to spread, town plots\nwere large, and as a matter of fact the sensation in our corner room\nwas of being in a wilderness--until we considered the board partition.\nHaving marched fastest we obtained the best room and the only bath, but\nnext-door neighbors could hear our conversation as easily as if there\nhad been no division at all.  However, as it happened, neither Coutlass\nand his gang nor Lady Saffren Waldon and her maid were put next to us\non either side.  To our right were three Poles, to our left a Jew and a\nGerman, and we carried on a whispered conversation without much risk.\n\nShe and her maid arrived last, as it was growing dusk.  We had already\nseen what there was to see of the town.  We had been to the post-office\non the white man's habitual hunt, for mail that we knew was\nnon-existent.  And I had had the first adventure.\n\nI walked away from the post-office alone, trying to puzzle out by\nmyself the meaning of Lady Saffren Waldon's pursuit of us, and of her\nfriendship with the Germans, and her probable connection with Georges\nCoutlass and his riff-raff.  I had not gone far either on my stroll or\nwith the problem--perhaps two hundred yards down a grassy track that\nthey had told me led toward a settlement--when something, not a sound,\nnot a smell, and certainly not sight, for I was staring at the ground,\ncaused me to look up.  My foot was raised for a forward step, but what\nI saw then made me set it down again.\n\nTo my right front, less than ten yards away, was a hillock about twice\nmy own height.  To my left front, about twelve yards away was another,\nslightly higher; and the track passed between them.  On the right-hand\nhillock stood a male lion, full maned, his forelegs well apart and the\ndark tuft on the end of his tail appearing every instant to one side or\nthe other as he switched it cat-fashion.  He was staring down at me\nwith a sort of scandalized interest; and there was nothing whatever\nfor me to do but stare at him.  I had no weapon.  One spring and a jump\nand I was his meat.  To run was cowardice as well as foolishness, the\none because the other.  And without pretending to be able to read a\nlion's thoughts I dare risk the assertion that he was puzzled what to\ndo with me.  I could very plainly see his claws coming in and out of\ntheir sheaths, and what with that, and the switching tail, and the\nsense of impotence I could not take my eyes off him.  So I did not look\nat the other hillock at first.\n\nBut a sound like that a cat makes calling to her kittens, only greatly\nmagnified, made me glance to the left in a hurry.  I think that up to\nthat moment I had not had time to be afraid, but now the goose-flesh\nbroke out all over me, and the sensation up and down my spine was of\nmelting helplessness.\n\nOn the left-hand hillock a lioness stood looking down with much\nintenser and more curious interest.  She looked from me to her mate,\nand from her mate to me again with indecision that was no more\nreassuring than her low questioning growl.\n\nI do not know why they did not spring on me.  Surely no two lions ever\ncontemplated easier quarry.  No victim in the arena ever watched the\nweapons of death more helplessly.  I suppose my hour had not come.\nPerhaps the lions, well used to white men who attacked on sight with\nlong-range weapons, doubted the wisdom of experiments on something new.\n\nThe lioness growled again.  Her mate purred to her with an uprising\nreassuring note that satisfied her and sent my heart into my boots.\nThen he turned, sprang down behind the hillock, and she followed.  The\nnext I saw of them they were running away like dogs,  jumping low\nbushes and heading for jungle on the near horizon faster than I had\nimagined lions could travel.\n\nThat ended my desire for further exercise and solitude.  I made for the\nhotel as fast as fear of seeming afraid would let me, and spent fifteen\naggravating minutes on the veranda trying to persuade Fred Oakes that I\nhad truly seen lions.\n\n\"Hyenas!\" he said with the air of an old hunter, to which he was quite\nentitled, but that soothed me all the less for that.\n\n\"More likely jackals,\" said Will; and he was just as much as Fred\nentitled to an opinion.\n\nWhile I was asserting the facts with increasing anger, and they were\namusing themselves with a hundred-and-one ridiculous reasons for\ndisbelieving me, Lady Saffren Waldon came.  She had, as usual,\nattracted to herself able assistance; a settler's ox-cart brought her\nbelongings, and she and her maid rode in hammocks borne by porters\nimpressed from heaven knew where.  It was not far from the station, but\nshe was the type of human that can not be satisfied with meek\nbeginnings.  That type is not by any means always female, but the\nwomen are the most determined on their course, and come the biggest\ncroppers on occasion.\n\nShe was determined now, mistress of the situation and of her plans.\nShe left to her maid the business of quarreling about accommodations;\n(there was little left to choose from, and all was bare and bad);\ndismissed the obsequious settler and his porters with perfunctory\nthanks that left him no excuse for lingering, and came along the\nveranda straight toward us with the smile of old acquaintance, and such\nan air of being perfectly at ease that surprise was disarmed, and the\nrudeness we all three intended died stillborn.\n\n\"What do you think of the country?\" she asked.  \"Men like it as a rule.\nWomen detest it, and who can blame them?  No comfort--no manners--no\ncompanionship--no meals fit to eat--no amusement!  Have you killed\nanything or anybody yet?  That always amuses a man!\"\n\nWe rose to make room for her and I brought her a chair.  There was\nnothing else one could do.  There is almost no twilight in that part of\nEast Africa; until dark there is scarcely a hint that the day is\nwaning.  She sat with us for twenty or thirty minutes making small\ntalk, her maid watching us from a window above, until the sun went down\nwith almost the suddenness of gas turned off, and in a moment we could\nscarcely see one another's faces.\n\nThen came the proprietor to the door, with his best ex-missionary air\nof knowledge of all earth's ways, their reason and their trend.\n\n\"All in!\" he called.  \"All inside at once!  No guest is allowed after\ndark on the veranda!  All inside!  Supper presently!\"\n\n\"Pah!\" remarked Lady Saffren Waldon, rising.  \"What is it about some\nmen that makes one's blood boil?  I suppose we must go in.\"\n\nShe came nearer until she stood between the three of us, so close that\nI could see her diamond-hard eyes and hear the suppressed breathing\nthat I suspected betrayed excitement.\n\n\"I must speak with you three men!  Listen!  I know this place.  The\nrooms are unspeakable--not a bedroom that isn't a megaphone, magnifying\nevery whisper!  There is only one suitable place--the main dining-room.\nThe proprietor leaves the oil-lamp burning in there all night.  People\ngo to bed early; they prefer to drink in their bedrooms because it\ncosts less than treating a crowd!  I shall provide a light supper, and\nmy maid shall lay the table after everybody else is gone up-stairs.\nThen come down and talk with me.  Its important!  Be sure and come!\"\n\nShe did not wait for an answer but led the way into the hotel.  There\nwas no hall.  The door led straight into the dining-room, and the noisy\ncrowd within, dragging chairs and choosing places at the two long\ntables, made further word with her impossible, even if she had not\nhurried up-stairs to her room.  \"What do you make of it--of her?  Isn't\nshe the limit?\"\n\nThe words were scarcely out of Will's mouth when a roar that made the\ndishes rattle broke and echoed and rumbled in the street outside.  The\ninstant it died down another followed it--then three or four--then a\ndozen all at once.  There came the pattering of heavy feet, like the\nsound of cattle coming homeward.  Yet no cattle--no buffaloes ever\nroared that way.\n\n\"Now you know why I ordered you all inside,\" grinned the ex-missionary\nowner of the place.  I divined on the instant that this was his habit,\nto stand by the door before supper and say just those words to the last\narrivals.  I had a vision of him standing by his mission door\naforetime, repeating one jest, or more likely one stale euphuism night\nafter night.\n\n\"Lions?\" I asked, hating to take the bait, yet curious beyond power to\nresist.\n\n\"Certainly they're lions!  Did you think you were dreaming?  Are you\nglad you came in when I called you?  Would you rather go out again now?\nMake a noise like a herd of cattle, don't they!  That's because\nthey're bold.  They don't care who hears them!  The day is ours.  It\nused to be theirs, but the white man has come and broken up their\nempire.  The night is still theirs.  They're reveling in it!  They're\nboasting of it!  Every single night they come swaggering through like\nthis just after sunset.  They'll come again just before dawn, roaring\nthe same way.  You'll hear them.  They'll wake you all right.  No\ntrouble in this hotel about getting guests down-stairs for early\nbreakfast!\"\n\n\"I'll get my rifle and settle the hash of one or two of them before I\neat supper!\" announced Will, turning away to make good his words.  But\nthe proprietor seized him by the arm.\n\n\"Don't be foolish!  It has been tried too often!  I never allowed such\nfoolishness at my place.  A party up-street fired from the windows.\nCouldn't see very well in the dark, but wounded two or three lions.\nWhat happened, eh?  Why the whole pack of lions laid siege to the\nhouse!  They broke into the stable and killed three horses, a donkey,\nand all the cows and sheep.  There weren't any shutters on the house\nwindows--nothing but glass.  It wasn't long before a young lion broke a\nwindow, and in no time there were three full-grown ones into the house\nafter him.  They injured one man so severely that he died next day.\nThey only shot two of the lions that got inside.  The other two got\nsafely away, and since that time people here have known enough not to\ninterfere with them except by daylight!  They'll do no harm to speak of\nunless you fire and enrage them.  They'll kill the stray dogs, or any\nother animal they find loose; and heaven help the man they meet!  But\nthe place to be after six P.M. in Nairobi is indoors.  And it's the\nplace to stay until after sunrise!  Hear them roar!  Aren't they\nmagnificent?  Listen!\"\n\nThe noise that twenty or thirty lions can make, deliberately bent on\nmaking it and roaring all at once, is unbelievable.  They throw their\nheads up and glory in strength of lungs until thunders take second\nplace and the listener knows why not the bravest, not the most\ndangerous of beasts has managed to impose the fable of his grandeur on\nmen's imagination.\n\nWe were summoned to the table by the din of Georges Coutlass rising to\nnew heights of gallantry.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he shouted, thumping with a scarred fist.  With a\npoultice on his eye he looked like a swashbuckler home from the wars;\nand as he had not troubled to shave himself, the effect was heightened.\n\"What sort of company sits when a titled lady enters!\"  He seized a\nbig spoon and rapped on the board with it.  \"Blood of an onion!  Rise,\nevery one!\"\n\nEverybody rose, although there were men in the room in no mind to be\ntold their duty by a Greek.  Lady Saffren Waldon walked to a place near\nthe head of the table with a chilling bow.  As usual when night and the\nyellow lamplight modified merciless outlines, she looked lovely enough.\nBut she lacked the royal gift of seeming at home with the vulgar herd.\nShe could make men notice her--serve her, up to a certain point--and\nfeel that she was the center of interest wherever she might choose to\nbe; but because she was everlastingly on guard, she lacked the power\nto put mixed company at ease.\n\nOnly the ex-missionary at the head of the table seemed to consider\nhimself socially qualified to entertain her.  She was at no pains to\nconceal contempt for him.\n\n\"You honor my poor hotel!\" he assured her.\n\n\"It is certainly a very poor hotel,\" she answered.\n\n\"Do you expect to remain long, may I ask?\"\n\n\"What right have you to ask me questions?  Tell that native to go away\nfrom behind my chair.  My own maid will wait on me!\"\n\nWhether purposely or not, she cast such a chill upon the company that\neven Georges Coutlass subsided within himself, and, though he ate like\na ravening animal, did not talk.  Almost the only conversation was\nbetween the owner and the native servants, who waited at table\nabominably and were noisily reprimanded, and argued back. Each\nreprimand increased their inefficiency and insolence.  Natives detest a\nfussy, noisy white man.\n\nBad food, indifferent cooking, and no conversation worthy of the name\nproduced gloom that drove every one from table as soon as possible.\nEven the proprietor, with unsatiable curiosity exuding from him, but no\nspirit for forcing issues, departed to a sanctum of his own up\nsomewhere under the roof.  The boys cleared the tables.  The smell of\nfood spread itself and settled slowly.  A half-breed butler served\ncountless orders of drinks on trays, and sent them upstairs to\nbedrooms.  Presently we three sat alone in the long bare room.\n\n\"Shall we wait for her?\" I asked.  \"Haven't we had enough of her?\"\n\nFred laughed.  \"She can scarcely cut the throats of all three of us!\"\n\n\"I said we'd never hear the last of it!\" said Will, with a scowl at me.\n\n\"Shall we wait for her?\" I repeated.\n\nMy own vote would have been in favor of going upstairs and leaving her\nto her own devices.  I could see that Fred was afire with curiosity,\nbut guessed that Will would agree with me.  However, the point was\nsettled for us by the arrival of her maid, who smiled with unusual\ncondescension and produced from a basket an assortment of drinks, nuts,\ncigarettes and sandwiches.  She spread them on the table and went away\nagain.\n\nWe sat and smoked for an hour after that, imagining every moment that\nLady Saffren Waldon would be coming.  Whenever we yawned in chorus and\nrose to go upstairs, a footstep seemed to herald her arrival.  To have\npassed her on the stairs would have been too awkward to be amusing.\n\nAt last we really made up our minds to go to bed; and then she really\ncame, appearing at the bend in the stairs just as I set my foot on the\nlower step, so we trooped back to our chairs by the window.  She was\ndressed in a lacy silk negligee, and took pains this time to appear\ngracious.\n\n\"I waited until I felt sure we should not be disturbed,\" she said,\nsmiling. \"Won't you come and sit down?\"\n\nWe brought our chairs to the table, she sitting at one end and we\ntogether at one side, Fred nearest her and I farthest away.  She made a\nsign toward the wine and sandwiches, and offered us cigarettes of a\nsort I had never seen.  Without feeling exactly like flies in a\nspider's web, we were nervous as schoolboys.\n\n\"What do you want with us?\" asked Will at last.\n\nShe laughed and took a cigarette.\n\n\"Don't let us talk too loud.  You three men are after the Tippoo Tib\nivory.  So is the Sultan of Zanzibar.  So is the German government.  So\nam I.\"\n\nShe gave the statement time to do its own work, and smoked a while in\nsilence.  The strength of her position, and our weakness, lay in there\nbeing three of us.  Any one of us might let drop an ill-considered word\nthat would commit the others.  I think we all felt that, for we sat and\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"You answer her, Fred,\" I said at last, and Will nodded agreement.\n\nSo Fred got up and sat on the other side of the table, where we could\nsee his face and he ours.\n\n\"You haven't answered Mr. Yerkes' question,\" he said. \"What do you want\nwith us, Lady Saffren Waldon?\"\n\n\"I want an understanding with you.  I will be plain to begin with.  We\nall know you know where the ivory is.  Lord Montdidier is not the man\nto connect himself with any wild goose chase.  We don't pretend to know\nhow you came by the secret or why he has gone to London, but we are\nsure you know it, perfectly sure, and for five or six reasons.  We are\nwilling to buy the secret from you at your own price.\"\n\n\"Who are 'we'?\" asked Fred pointedly, helping himself to nuts.\n\n\"The German government, the Sultan of Zanzibar, and myself.\"\n\nFred smiled.  \"Between you you probably could pay,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I will tell you a few hard facts,\" she said, \"now that the ice is\nbroken.  You will never be allowed to make full use of your own secret.\nYou have arrived at an inopportune moment, for you and for us. Our\nplans have been on foot a long time.  Our search has been systematic,\nand it is a mathematical certainty we shall find what we look for in\ntime.  We do not propose to let new arrivals on the scene spoil all our\nplans and disappoint us just because they happen to have information.\nIf you go ahead you will be watched like mice whom cats are after.  If\nyou find the ivory, you will be killed before you can make the\ndiscovery known!\"\n\n\"We seem up against it, don't we!\" smiled Fred.\n\n\"You are!  But you can save us trouble, if you will.  Name your price.\nTell me your secret.  Go your way.  If your story proves true you shall\nbe paid by draft on London.\"\n\n\"Are you overlooking the idea,\" asked Fred, \"that we might tell the\nsecret to the British government, and be contented with our ten per\ncent. commission?\"\n\n\"I am not.  You are expressly warned against any such foolishness.  In\nthe first place, you will be killed at once if you dare.  In the\nsecond place, how do you know the British government would pay you ten\nper cent.?\"\n\n\"I've had dealings with the English!\" laughed Fred.\n\n\"Bah!  Do you think this is Whitehall?  Do you think the officials here\nare proof against temptation?  When I tell you that in Whitehall itself\nI can bribe two officials out of three, perhaps you'll understand me\nwhen I say that all these people have their price!  And the price is\nlow!  Tell them where the ivory is--lead them to it--and they'll swear\nthey found it themselves, so as to keep the commission themselves!  And\nas for you--you three\"--she sneered with the most sardonic, thin-lipped\nsmile I ever saw--\"there are lions out here, and buffalo, snakes,\nfevers, native uprisings--more ways of being rid of you than by choking\nyou to death with butter!\"\n\n\"Do you suppose\" asked Fred, \"that Lord Montdidier has no influence in\nLondon, that he--\"\n\n\"I know he had influence.  I should have told you first, perhaps.  Lord\nMontdidier was murdered on board ship.  A telegram reached Mombasa\nyesterday at ten A.M. from up-coast saying that the body of an unknown,\nEnglishman had been picked up at sea by an Arab dhow, with the face too\nbadly eaten by fish to be recognizable.  You may take it from me, that\nis Lord Montdidier's corpse.\"\n\nThe calm announcement was intended to surprise us, and it did, but the\nresult surprised her.\n\n\"You she-devil!\" said Will.  \"If you and your gang have murdered that\nfine fellow I'll turn the tables on you!  You go up-stairs, and pray he\nisn't dead!  Pray that corpse may prove to be some one's else!  If he's\ndead I'll guarantee you it's the worst day's work you ever had a hand\nin!  Go up-stairs!\"\n\nHe flung away the cigarette she had given him and knocked his chair\naway.\n\n\"Sit down, you young fool!\" she said.  \"Don't make all that noise!\"\n\nBut Will had none of the respect for titles acquired by marriage that\nmade most men an easy mark for her.\n\n\"Leave the room!\" he ordered.  \"Go away from us!  Just you hope that's\na lie about Monty, that's all!\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" she repeated.  \"I admit I am a little previous.  The story\nis unconfirmed yet.  Sit down and be sensible!  Something of the sort\nwill happen to all of you unless you three men get religion!\"\n\nBut Will began to pace the floor noisily, stopping to glare at her each\ntime he turned.\n\n\"Is there any sense in protracting the scene?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"No,\" she admitted.  \"I see you are too hot-headed to be reasoned with.\nBut it makes little difference!\nFever--animals--climate--sun--flood--accident--natives--there are\nexcuses in plenty--explanations by the dozen!  I will say good night,\nthen--and good-by!\"\n\n\"Yes, good-by!\" growled Will, facing her with his back to the stairs.\n\"You take us for men with a price, do you?\"\n\n\"All men have a price,\" she smiled bitterly.  \"Only it is no use\noffering flowers to pigs!  We must treat pigs another way--pigs, and\nyoung fools!  And fools old enough to know better!\" she added with a\nnod toward Fred, who bowed to her in mock abasement--too politely, I\nthought.\n\nWill got out of her way and she went up-stairs with the manner of an\nempress taking leave of subjects.  Fred swept her food and wine from\nthe table and stowed it in a corner, and we sat down at the table again.\n\n\"The whole thing's getting ridiculous.\" he said.\n\n\"Why don't we hunt up some official in the morning,\" I proposed, \"and\nsimply expose her?\"\n\n\"No use,\" said Will.  \"She never followed us up here and tried that\ngame without being sure of her pull.  Besides--what kind of a tale\ncould we tell without letting on we're after the ivory?  I vote we see\nthe game through to a finish.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Fred. \"I agree!\"\n\n\"The only clue we've got,\" said I, \"is Courtney's advice about Mount\nElgon.\"\n\n\"And what Coutlass said in Zanzibar about German East,\" added Will.\n\n\"Tell you what,\" said Fred, rapping the table excitedly.  \"Instead of\nfalling foul of this government by slipping over the dead-line, why not\nrun down to German East--pretend to search for the stuff down\nthere--and go from German East direct to Mount Elgon, giving 'em all\nthe slip.  Who's got the map?\"\n\n\"It's up-stairs,\" I said.  \"I'll fetch it.\"\n\nThere was nothing like silence in the rooms above.  Men were smoking\nand drinking in one another's rooms.  Some doors were open to make\nconversation easier across the landing, and nobody was asleep.  But I\nwas surprised to see Georges Coutlass leaning against the door-post of\nthe room he shared with the other Greek and the Goanese, obviously on\nguard, but against whom and on whose behalf it was difficult to guess.\n\n\"Are you off to bed?\" he asked, piercing me with his unbandaged eye.\n\"Why don't the others go, too?\"\n\nIt dawned on me what he was after.\n\n\"Take the wine if you want it,\" I said.  \"None of us will prevent you.\"\n\nHe went down-stairs in his stocking feet, leaving his own door wide.  I\nglanced in.  The other Greek and the Goanese were asleep.  Hassan lay\non the floor on a mat between their cots.  He looked up at me.  I did\nnot dare speak, but I smiled at him as friendly as I knew how and made\na gesture I hoped he would interpret as an invitation to come and\nattach himself to our party.  Then I hurried on, for Coutlass was\ncoming back with a bottle of wine in each hand.\n\nI was five minutes in our bedroom.  In a minute I knew what had\nhappened.  We had left the door locked, but the lock was a common one;\nprobably the keys of other doors fitted it, and there was not one thing\nin the room placed exactly where we had left it.  Everything was more\nor less in place, but nothing quite.\n\nI returned empty-handed down-stairs, locking the bedroom door behind me.\n\n\"Listen, you chaps!\" I said.  \"While we waited for that woman she and\nher maid went through our things again!\"\n\n\"How d'you know it was she?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"No mistaking the scent she uses.  Where's our money?\"\n\n\"Here in my pocket.\"\n\n\"Good.  The map's gone, though!\"\n\nWill showed big teeth in the first really happy smile for several days.\n\n\"Good enough!\" he said.  \"Let's go to bed now.  I'll bet you my share\nof the ivory they're poring over the map with a magnifying-glass!\nD'you remember the various places we underscored?  They'll think it's a\ncryptogram and fret over it all night!  Come on--come to bed!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n\nTHE SONG OF THE GREAT GAME RESERVE\n\n  Noah was our godfather, and he pitched and caulked a ship\n  'With stable-room for two of each and fodder for the trip,\n  Lest when the Flood made sea of earth the animals should die;\n  And two by two he stalled us till the wrath of God was by.\n  But who in the name of the Pentateuch can the paleface people be\n  Who ha' done on the plains of Africa more than he did at sea?\n\n  A million hoofs once drummed the dust (Kongoni led the way!)\n  From river-pool to desert-lick we thundered in array\n  Until the dark-skin people came with tube and smoke and shot,\n  Hunting and driving and killing, and leaving the meat to rot.\n  And we didn't know who the hunters were, but we saw the herds grow thin\n  That used to drum the dust-clouds up with thousand-footed din.\n\n  We were few when the paleface people came--scattered and few and afraid.\n  Fewer were they, but they brought the law, and the dark-skin men obeyed.\n  The paleface people drew a line that none by dark or day\n  Might cross with fell intent to hunt--capture or drive or slay.\n  But who can the paleface people be with red-meat appetites\n  Who ruled anew what Noah knew--that animals have rights?\n\n  And now in the Athi Game Reserve--in a million-acre park\n  A million creatures graze who went by twos into the Ark.\n  We sleep o' nights without alarm (Kongoni, prick your ear!)\n  And barring the leopard and lion to watch, and ticks, we've nought\n      to fear,\n  Zebra, giraffe and waterbuck, rhino and ostrich too--\n  But who can the paleface people be who know what Noah knew?\n\n\nThe lions awoke us a little before dawn as the proprietor had promised.\nThey seemed to have had bad hunting, for their boastfulness was gone.\nThey came in twos and threes, snarling, only roaring intermittently--in\na hurry because the hated daylight would presently reverse conditions\nand put them at disadvantage.\n\nI grew restless and got up.  The air being chilly, I put my clothes on\nand sat for a while by the window.  So it happened I caught sight of\nHassan, very much afraid of lions, but obviously more afraid of being\nseen from the hotel windows.  He was sneaking along as close to the\nhouse as he could squeeze, his head just visible above the veranda rail.\n\nFor no better reason than that I was curious and unoccupied, I slipped\nout of the house and followed him.\n\nOnce clear of the hotel he seemed to imagine himself safe, for without\nanother glance backward he ran up-street in the direction of the\nbazaar.  I followed him down the bazaar--a short street of corrugated\niron buildings--and out the other end.  Being fat, he could not run\nfast, although his wind held out surprisingly.  If he saw me at all he\nmust have mistaken me for a settler or one of the Nairobi officials,\nfor he seemed perfectly sure of himself and took no pains whatever now\nto throw pursuers off the track.\n\nIt soon became evident that he was making for an imposing group of\ntents on the outskirts of the town.  As he drew nearer he approached\nmore slowly.\n\nIt now became my turn to take precautions.  There was no chance of\nconcealment where I was--nothing but open level ground between me and\nthe tents.  But now that I knew Hassan's destination, I could afford to\nlet him out of sight for a minute; so I turned my back on him, walked\nto where a sort of fold in the ground enabled me to get down unseen\ninto a shallow nullah, and went along that at right angles to Hassan's\ncourse until I reached the edge of some open jungle, about half a mile\nfrom the tents.  I noticed that it came to an end at a spot about three\nhundred yards to the rear of the tents, so I worked my way along its\nouter edge, and so approached the encampment from behind.\n\nI had brought a rifle with me, not that I expected to shoot anything,\nbut because the lion incident of the previous afternoon had taught me\ncaution.  It had not entered my head that in that country a strange\nwhite man without a rifle might have been regarded as a member of the\nmean white class; nor that anybody would question my right to carry a\nrifle, for that matter.\n\nThe camp was awake now.  There were ten tents, all facing one way.  Two\nof them contained stores.  The central round tent with an awning in\nfront was obviously a white man's.  One tent housed a mule, and the\nrest were for native servants and porters.  The camp was tidy and\nclean--obviously belonging to some one of importance.  Fires were\nalight.  Breakfast was being cooked, and smelled most uncommonly\nappetizing in that chill morning air.  Boys were already cleaning\nboots, and a saddle, and other things.  There was an air of discipline\nand trained activity, and from the central tent came the sound of\nvoices.\n\nI don't know why, but I certainly did not expect to hear English.  So\nthe sound of English spoken with a foreign accent brought me to a\nstandstill.  I listened to a few words, and made no further bones about\neavesdropping.  Circumstances favored me.  The boys had seen I was\ncarrying a rifle and was therefore a white man of importance, so they\ndid not question my right to approach.  The tent with the mule in it\nand the two store tents were on the right, pitched in a triangle.  I\npassed between them up to the very pegs of the central tent from which\nthe voices came, and discovered I was invisible, unless some one should\nhappen to come around a corner.  I decided to take my chance of that.\n\nThe first thing that puzzled me was why a German (for it was a\nperfectly unmistakable German accent) should need to talk English to a\nnative who was certainly familiar with both Arabic and Kiswahili.  When\nI heard the German addressed as Bwana Schillingschen I wondered still\nmore, for from all accounts that individual could speak more native\ntongues than most people knew existed.  It did not occur to me at the\ntime that if he wished not to be understood by his own crowd of boys he\nmust either speak German or English, and that Hassan would almost\ncertainly know no German.\n\n\"A good thing you came to me!\" I heard.  The accent was clumsy for a\nman so well versed in tongues.  \"Yes, I will give you money at the\nright time.  Tell me no lies now!  There will be letters coming from\npeople you never saw, and I shall know whether or not you lie to me!\nYou say there are three of the fools?\"\n\n\"Yes, bwana.  There were four, but one going home--big lord gentleman,\nhim having black m'stache, gone home.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking Hassan's voice.  No doubt he could speak his\nmother tongue softly enough, but in common with a host of other people\nhe seemed to imagine that to make himself understood in English he must\nshout.\n\n\"Why did he go home?\"\n\n\"I don't know, bwana.\"\n\n\"Did they quarrel?\"\n\n\"Sijui.\"*  [* Sijui, I don't know:  the most aggravating word In\nAfrica, except perhaps bado kidogo, which means \"presently,\" \"bye and\nbye,\" \"in a little while.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare say 'sijui' to me!\"\n\n\"Maybe they quarrel, maybe not.  They all quarreling with Lady\nSaffunwardo--staying in same hotel, Tippoo Tib one time his house--she\nwanting maybe go with him to London.  He saying no.  Others saying no.\nAll very angry each with other an' throwing bwana masikini, Greek man,\ndown hotel stairs.\"\n\n\"What had he to do with it?\"\n\n\"Two Greek man an' one Goa all after ivory, too.  She--Lady Saffunwardo\nafterwards promising pay them three if they come along an' do what she\ntell 'em. They agreeing quick!  Byumby Tippoo Tib hearing bazaar talk\nan' sending me along too.  She refuse to take me, all because German\nconsul man knowing me formerly and not making good report, but Greek\nbwana he not caring and say to me to come along.  Greek people very\nbad!  No food--no money--nothing but swear an' kick an' call bad\nnames--an' drunk nearly all the time!\"\n\n\"What makes you think these three men know where the ivory is?\" said\nthe German voice.  It was the voice of a man very used to questioning\nnatives--self-assertive but calm--going straight each time to the point.\n\n\"They having map. Map having marks on it.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"She--Lady Saffunwardo go in their bedroom, stealing it last night.\"\n\n\"Did you see her take it?\"\n\n\"Yes, bwana.\"\n\n\"Did you see the marks on it?\"\n\n\"No, bwana.\"\n\n\"Then how do you know the marks were on it?  Now, remember, don't lie\nto me!\"\n\n\"Coutlass, him Greek man, standing on stairs keeping watch.  Them three\nmen you call fools all sitting in dining-room waiting because they\nthinking she come presently.  She send maid to their room.  Maid, fool\nwoman, upset everything, finding nothing.  'No,' she say, 'no map--no\nmoney--no anything in here.'  An' Lady Saffunwardo she very angry an'\nsay, 'Come out o' there!  Let me look!'  And Lady Saffunwardo going in,\nbut maid not coming out, an' they both search.  Then Lady Saffanwardo\nsaying all at once,  'Here it is.  Didn't you see this?'  An' the maid\nanswering, 'Oh, that!  That nothing but just ordinary pocket map!  That\nnot it!'  But Lady Saffunwardo she opening the map, an' make little\nscream, an' say, 'Idiot!  This is it!  Look!  See!  See the marks!'\nSo, bwana, I then knowing must be marks on map!\"\n\n\"Good.  What did she do with it?\"\n\n\"Sujui.\"\n\n\"I told you not to dare say 'sijui' to me!\"\n\n\"How should I know, bwana, what she doing with it?\"\n\n\"Could you steal it?\"\n\n\"No, bwana!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You not knowing that woman!  No man daring steal from her!  She very\nterrible!\"\n\n\"If I offered you a hundred rupees could you steal it?\"\n\n\"Sujui, bwana.\"\n\n\"I told you not to use that word!\"\n\n\"Bwana, I--\"\n\n\"Could you steal it?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"That is no answer!\"\n\n\"Say that again about hundred rupees!\"\n\n\"I will give you a hundred rupees if you bring me that map and it\nproves to be what you say.\"\n\n\"I go.  I see.  I try.  Hundred rupees very little money!\"\n\n\"It's all you'll get, you black rascal!  And you know what you'll get\nif you fail!  You know me, don't you?  You understand my way?  Steal\nthat map and bring it here, and I shall give you a hundred rupees.\nFail, and you shall have a hundred lashes, and what Ahmed and Abdullah\nand Seydi got in addition!  The hundred lashes first, and the ant-hill\nafterward!  You're not fool enough to think you can escape me, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"No, bwana.\"\n\n\"Then go and get the map!\"\n\n\"But afterward, what then?  She very gali* woman.\"  [*Gali, same as\nHindustani kali--cruel, hard, fierce, terrible.]\n\n\"Nonsense!  Steal the map and bring it here to me.  Then I've other\nwork for you.  Are you a renegade Muhammedan?\"\n\n\"No, bwana!  No, no!  Never! I'm good Moslem.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Back to your old business with you!  Preach Islam up and\ndown the country.  Go and tell all the tribes in British territory that\nthe Germans are coming soon to establish an empire of Islam in Africa!\nGood pay and easy living!  Does that suit you?\"\n\n\"Yes, bwana.  How much pay?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when you bring the map.  Now be going!\"\n\nHassan went, after a deal of polite salaaming.  Then boys began\nbringing the German's breakfast, and unless I chose to confess myself\nan eavesdropper it became my business to be in the tent ahead of them.\nSo I strode forward as if just arrived and purposely tripped over a\ntent-rope, stumbling under the awning with a laugh and an apology.\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the German without rising.  He had the splay\nshovel beard described to us in Zanzibar--big dark man, sitting in the\ndoorway of a tent all hung with guns, skins and antlers.  He was in\nnight-shirt and trousers--bare feet--but with a helmet on the back of\nhis head.\n\n\"A visitor,\" I answered, \"staying at the hotel--out for a morning shot\nat something--had no luck--got nothing--saw your tents in the distance,\nand came out of curiosity to find out who you are.\"\n\n\"My name is Professor Schillingschen,\" he answered, still without\ngetting up.  There was no other chair near the awning, so I had to\nremain standing.  I told him my name, hoping that Hassan had either not\ndone so already, or else that he might have so bungled the\npronunciation as to make it unrecognizable.  I detected no sign of\nrecognition on Schillingschen's face.\n\nThe boys reached the tent with his breakfast, and one of them dragged a\nchair from inside the tent for me.  I sat down on it without waiting\nfor the professor to invite me.\n\n\"I'm tired,\" I said, untruthfully, minded to refuse an invitation to\neat, but interested to see whether he would invite me or not.\n\n\"Have you any friends at the hotel?\" he asked, looking up at me darkly\nunder the bushiest eyebrows I ever saw.\n\n\"I've got friends wherever I go,\" I answered.  \"I make friends.\"\n\n\"Are you going far?\" he demanded, holding out a foot for his boy to\npull a stocking on.\n\n\"That depends,\" I said.\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"On whether I get employment.\"\n\nI said that at random, without pausing to think what impression I might\ncreate.  He pulled the night-shirt off over his head, throwing the\nhelmet to the ground, and sat like a great hairy gorilla for the boy to\nhang day-clothes on him.  He had the hairiest breast and arms I ever\nsaw, hung with lumpy muscles that heightened his resemblance to an ape.\n\n\"I might give you work,\" he said presently, beginning to eat before the\nboy had finished dressing him.\n\n\"I want to travel\" I said.  \"If I could find a job that would take me\nup and down the length and breadth of this land, that would suit me\nfinely.\"\n\n\"That is the kind of a man I want,\" he said, eying me keenly.  \"I have\na German, but I need an Englishman.  Do you speak native languages?\"\n\n\"Scarcely a word.\"\n\nTo my surprise he nodded approval at that answer.\n\n\"I have parties of natives traveling all over the country gathering\nfolk lore, and ethnographical particulars, but they get into a village\nand sit down for whole weeks at a time, drawing pay for doing nothing.\nI need an Englishman to go with them and keep them moving.\"\n\n\"All well and good,\" I said, \"but I understand the government is not in\nfavor of white men traveling about at random.\"\n\n\"But I am known to the government,\" he answered.  \"I have been accorded\nfacilities because of my professional standing.  Have you references\nyou can give me?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"No references.\"\n\nI thought that would stump him, but on the contrary he looked rather\npleased.\n\n\"That is good.  References are too frequently evidence of back-stairs\ninfluence.\"\n\nAll this while he kept eying me between mouthfuls.  Whenever I seemed\nto look away his eyes fairly burned holes in me.  Whenever food got in\nhis beard (which was frequently) be used the napkin more as a shield\nbehind which to take stock of me than as a means of getting clean\nagain.  By the time his breakfast was finished his beard was a beastly\nmess, but he probably had my features from every angle fixed indelibly\nin his memory.  The sensation was that I had been analyzed and card\nindexed.\n\n\"I pay good wages,\" he remarked, and then stuck his face, beard and\nall, into the basin of warm water his boy had brought.  \"Where did you\nget that rifle?\" he demanded, spluttering, and combing the beard out\nwith his fingers.\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to say \"At Zanzibar,\" but, as that might\nhave started him on a string of questions as to how I came to that\nplace and whom I knew there, I temporized.\n\n\"Oh, I bought it from a man.\"\n\n\"That is no answer!\" he retorted.\n\nIf I had been possessed of much inclination to play deep games and\nmatch wits with big rascals I suppose I would have answered him civilly\nand there and then learned more of his purpose.  But I was not\nprepossessed by his charms or respectful of his claim to superiority.\nThe German type super-education never did impress me as compatible with\ngood breeding or good sense, and it annoyed me to have to lie to him.\n\n\"It's all the answer you'll get!\" I said.\n\n\"Where is your license for it?\" he growled.\n\nThe game began to amuse me.\n\n\"None of your business!\" I answered.\n\n\"How long have you been in the country!\"\n\n\"Since I came,\" I said.\n\n\"And you have no license!  You have been out shooting.  A lucky thing\nyou came to my camp and not to some other man's!  The game laws are\nvery strict!\"\n\nHe spoke then to a boy who was standing behind me, giving him very\ncareful directions in a language of which I did not know one word.  The\nboy went away.\n\n\"The last man who went shooting near Nairobi without a license,\" he\nsaid, \"tried to excuse himself before the magistrate by claiming\nignorance of the law.  He was fined a thousand rupees and sentenced to\nsix months in jail!\"\n\n\"Very severe!\" I said.\n\n\"They are altogether too severe,\" he answered.  \"I hope you have killed\nnothing.  It is good you came first to me.  You would better stand that\nrifle over here in the corner of my tent.  To walk back to the hotel\nwith it over your shoulder would be dangerous.\"\n\n\"I've taken bigger chances than that,\" said I.\n\n\"If you have shot nothing, then it is not so serious,\" he said,\ndisappearing behind a curtain into the recesses of his tent.\n\nHe stayed in there for about ten minutes.  I had about made up my mind\nto walk away when four of his boys approached the tent from behind, and\none of them cried \"Hodi!\"  The boy to whom he had given directions\nacross my shoulder was not among them.\n\nThey threw the buck down near my feet, and he came out from the gloomy\ninterior and stared at it.  He asked them questions rapidly in the\nnative tongue, and they answered, pointing at me.\n\n\"They say you shot it,\" he told me, stroking his great beard\nalternately with either hand.\n\n\"Then they lie!\" I answered.\n\n\"Let me see that rifle!\" he said, reaching out an enormous freckled\nfist to take it.\n\nI saw through his game at last.  It would have been the easiest thing\nin the world to extract a cartridge from the clip in the magazine and\nclaim afterward that I had fired it away.  Evidently he proposed to get\nme in his power, though for just what reason he was so determined to\nmake use of me rather than any one else was not so clear.\n\n\"So I shot the buck, did I?\" I asked.\n\n\"Those four natives say they saw you shoot it.\"\n\n\"Then it's mine?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"It's heavy,\" I said, \"but I expect I can carry it.\"\n\nI took the buck by the hind legs and swung myself under it.  It weighed\nmore than a hundred pounds, but the African climate had not had time\nenough to sap my strength or destroy sheer pleasure in muscular effort.\n\n\"What's mine's my own!\" I laughed. \"You gave me something to eat after\nall!  Good day, and good riddance!\"\n\nThe boys tried to prevent my carrying the buck away.\n\n\"Come back!\" growled the professor.  \"I will take responsibility for\nthat buck and save you from punishment.  Bring it back!  Lay it down!\"\n\nBut I continued to walk away, so he ordered his boys to take the\ncarcass from me.  I laid it down and threatened them with my butt end.\nHe brought his own rifle out and threatened me with that.  I laughed at\nhim, bade him shoot if he dared, offered him three shots for a penny,\nand ended by shouldering the buck again and walking off.\n\nMeat was cheap in Nairobi in those days, so the owner of the hotel was\nnot so delighted as I expected.  He reprimanded me for being late for\nbreakfast, and told me I was lucky to get any.  Fred and Will had\nwaited for me, and while we ate alone and I told them the story of my\nmorning's adventure a police officer in khaki uniform tied up his mule\noutside and clattered in.\n\n\"Whose buck is that hanging outside the kitchen?\" he demanded.\n\n\"There's some doubt about it,\" I said.  \"I've been accused of being the\nowner.\"\n\n\"Then you're the man I want.  The court sits at nine.  You'd better be\nthere, or you'll be fetched!\"\n\nHe placed in my hand what proved to be a summons to appear before the\ndistrict court that morning on the charge of carrying an unregistered\nrifle and shooting game without a license.  Two native policemen he had\nwith him took down the buck from the hook outside the kitchen door and\ncarried it off as evidence.\n\nWe finished our breakfast in great contentment, and strode off\narm-in-arm to find the court-house, feeling as if we were going to a\nplay--perhaps a mite indignant, as if the subject of the play were one\nwe did not quite approve, but perfectly certain of a good time.\n\nThe court was crowded.  The bearded professor, his four boys, and two\nother natives were there, as well as several English officials, all\napparently on very good terms indeed with Schillingschen.\n\nAs we entered the court under the eyes of a hostile crowd I heard one\nofficial say to the man standing next him:\n\n\"I hope he'll make an example of this case.  If he doesn't every new\narrival in this country will try to take the law in his own hands.  I\nhope he fines him the limit!\"\n\n\"Give me your hunting-knife, Fred!\" said I, and Fred laughed as he\npassed it to me.  For the moment I think he thought I meant to plunge\nit into the too talkative official's breast.\n\nFirst they called a few township cases.  A drunken Muhammedan was fined\nfive rupees, and a Hindu was ordered to remove his garbage heap before\nnoon.  Three natives were ordered to the chain-gang for a week for\nfighting, and a Masai charged with stealing cattle was remanded.  Then\nmy case was called, very solemnly, by a magistrate scarcely any older\nthan myself.\n\nThe police officer acted as prosecutor.  He stated that \"acting on\ninformation received\" he had proceeded to the hotel.  Outside of which\nhe saw a buck hanging (buck produced in evidence); that he had entered\nthe hotel, found me at breakfast, and that I had not denied having shot\nthe buck.  He called his two colored askaris to prove that, and they\nreeled off what they had to say with the speed of men who had been\nthoroughly rehearsed.  Then he put the German on the stand, and\nSchillingschen, with a savage glare at me, turned on his verbal\nartillery.  He certainly did his worst.\n\n\"This morning,\" he announced, after having been duly sworn on the Book,\n\"that young man whose name I do not know approached my tent while I was\ndressing.  The sound of a rifle being fired had awakened me earlier\nthan usual.  He carried a rifle, and I put two and two together and\nconcluded he had shot something.  Not having seen him ever before, and\nhe standing before my tent, I asked him his name.  He refused to tell\nme, and that made me suspicious.  Then came my four boys carrying a\nbuck, which they assured me they had seen him shoot.  I asked him\nwhether he had a license to shoot game, and he at once threatened to\nshoot me if I did not mind my own business.  Therefore, I sent a note\nto the police at once.\"\n\nHis four boys were then put on the stand in turn, and told their story\nthrough an interpreter.  Their words identical.  If the interpreter\nspoke truth one account did not vary from the next in the slightest\ndegree, and that fact alone  should have aroused the suspicion of any\nunprejudiced judge.\n\nHaving the right to cross-examine, I asked each in turn whether the\nrifle I had brought with me to court was the same they had seen me\nusing.  They asserted it was.  Then I recalled the German and asked him\nthe same question.  He also replied in the affirmative.  I asked him\nhow he knew.  He said he recognized the mark on the butt where the\nvarnish had been chafed away.\nThen I handed the hunting knife I had borrowed from to the police\nofficer and demanded that he have the bullet cut out of the buck's\ncarcass.  The court could not object to that, so under the eyes of at\nleast fifty witnesses a flattened Mauser bullet was produced.  I called\nattention to the fact that my rifle was a Lee-Enfield that could not\npossibly have fired a Mauser bullet.  The court was young and very\ndignified--examined the bullet and my rifle--and had to be convinced.\n\n\"Very well,\" was the verdict on that count, \"it is proved that you did\nnot shoot this particular buck, unless the police have evidence that\nyou used a different rifle.\"\n\nThe policeman confessed that he had no evidence along that line, so the\nfirst charge was dismissed.\n\n\"But you are charged,\" said the magistrate, \"with carrying an\nunregistered rifle, and shooting without a license.\"\n\nFor answer I produced my certificate of registration and the big game\nlicense we had paid for in Mombasa.\n\n\"Why didn't you say so before?\" demanded the magistrate.\n\n\"I wasn't asked,\" said I.\n\n\"Case dismissed!\" snapped his honor, and the court began to empty.\n\n\"Don't let it stop there!\" urged Will excitedly.  \"That Heinie and his\nboys have all committed perjury; charge them with it!\"\n\nI turned to the police officer.\n\n\"I charge all those witnesses with perjury!\" I said.\n\n\"Oh,\" he laughed, \"you can't charge natives with that.  If the law\nagainst perjury was strictly enforced the jails wouldn't hold a\nfiftieth of them!  They don't understand.\"\n\n\"But that blackguard with a beard--that rascal Schillingschen\nunderstands!\" said I.  \"Arrest him!  Charge him with it!\"\n\n\"That's for the court to do,\" he answered.  \"I've no authority.\"\n\nThe magistrate had gone.\n\n\"Who is the senior official in this town?\" I demanded.\n\n\"There he goes,\" he answered.  \"That man in the white suit with the\nround white topee is the collector.\"\n\nSo we three followed the collector to his office, arriving about two\nminutes after the man himself.  The Goanese clerk had been in the\ncourt, and recognized me.  He had not stayed to hear the end.\n\n\"Fines should be paid in the court, not here!\" he intimated rudely.\n\nWe wasted no time with him but walked on through, and the collector\ngreeted us without obvious cordiality.  He did not ask us to sit down.\n\n\"My friend here has come to tell you about that man Schillingschen,\"\nsaid Fred.\n\n\"I suppose you mean Professor Schillingschen!\"\n\nThe collector was a clean-shaven man with a blue jowl that suffered\nfrom blunt razors, and a temper rendered raw by native cooking.  But he\nhad photos of feminine relations and a little house in a dreary Midland\nstreet on his desk, and was no doubt loyal to the light he saw.  I\nwished we had Monty with us.  One glimpse of the owner of a title that\nstands written in the Doomsday Book would have outshone the halo of\nSchillingschen's culture.\n\nI rattled off what I had to say, telling the story from the moment I\nstarted to follow Hassan from the hotel down to the end, omitting\nnothing.\n\n\"Schillingschen is worse than a spy.  He's a black-hearted, schemer.\nHe's planning to upset British rule in this Protectorate and make it\neasy for the Germans to usurp!\"\n\n\"This is nonsense!\" the collector interrupted.  \"Professor\nSchillingschen is the honored friend of the British government.  He\ncame to us here with the most influential backing--letter of\nintroduction from very exalted personages, I assure you!  Professor\nSchillingschen is one of the most, if not the most, learned\nethnologists in the world to-day.  How dare you traduce him!\"\n\n\"But you heard him tell lies in court!\" I gasped.  \"You were there.\nYou heard his evidence absolutely disproved.  How do you explain that\naway?\"\n\n\"I don't attempt to!  The explanation is for you to make!\" he answered.\n\"The fact that he did not succeed in proving his case against\nyou is nothing in itself!  Many a case in court is lost from lack of\nproper evidence!  And one more matter!  Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon is\nstaying--or rather, I should say, was staying at the hotel.  She is now\nstaying at my house.  She complains to me of very rude treatment at the\nhands of you three men--insolent treatment I should call it!  I can\nassure you that the way to get on in this Protectorate is not to behave\nlike cads toward ladies of title!  I understand that her maid is afraid\nto be caught alone by any one of you, and that Lady Saffren Waldon\nherself feels scarcely any safer!\"\n\nFred and I saw the humor of the thing, and that enabled us to save Will\nfrom disaster.  There never was a man more respectful of women than\nWill.  He would even get off the sidewalk for a black woman, and would\nneither tell nor laugh at the sort of stories that pass current about\nwomen in some smoking-rooms.  His hair bristled.  His ears stuck out on\neither side of his head.  He leaned forward--laid one strong brown hand\non the desk--and shook his left fist under the collector's nose.\n\n\"You poor boob!\" he exploded.  Then he calmed himself.  \"I'm sorry for\nyour government if you're the brightest jewel it has for this job!\nThat Jane will use everything you've got except the squeal!  Great\nsuffering Jemima!  Your title is collector, is it?  Do you collect bugs\nby any chance?  You act like it!  So help you two men and a boy, a\nbughouse is where I believe you belong!  Come along, fellows, he'll\nbite us if we stay!\"\n\n\"Be advised\" said the collector, leaning back in his chair and\nsneering.  \"Behave yourselves!  This is no country for taking chances\nwith the law!\"\n\n\"Remember Courtney's advice,\" said Fred when we got outside.  \"Suppose\nwe give him a few days to learn the facts about Lady Isobel, and then\ngo back and try him again?\"\n\n\"Say!\" answered Will, stopping and turning to face us.  \"What d'you\ntake me for?  I like my meals.  I like three squares a day, and\ntobacco, and now and then a drink.  But if this was the Sahara, and\nthat man had the only eats and drinks, I'd starve.\"\n\n\"Telling him the truth wouldn't be accepting favors from him,\"\ncounseled Fred.\n\n\"I wouldn't tell him the time!\"\n\nThat attitude--and Will insisted that all the officials in the land\nwould prove alike--limited our choice, for unless we were to allay\nofficial suspicion it would be hopeless to get away northward.\nSouthward into German East seemed the only way to go; there was\napparently no law against travel in that direction.  On our way to the\nhotel we passed Coutlass, striding along smirking to himself, headed\ntoward the office from which we had just come.\n\n\"I'll bet you,\" said Will, \"he's off to get an ammunition permit, and\npermission to go where he damned well pleases!  I'll bet he gets both!\nThis government's the limit!\"\n\nWe laughed, but Will proved more than half right.  Coutlass did get\nammunition.  Lady Saffren Waldon's influence was already strong enough\nfor that.  He did not ask for leave to go anywhere for the simple\nreason that his movements depended wholly on ours--a fact that\ndeveloped later.\n\nAt the hotel there was a pleasant surprise for us.  A squarely built,\nsnub-nosed native, not very dark skinned but very ugly--his right ear\nslit, and almost all of his left ear missing--without any of the brass\nor iron wire ornaments that most of the natives of the land affect, but\npossessed of a Harris tweed shooting jacket and, of all unexpected\nthings, boots that he carried slung by the laces from his neck-waited\nfor us, squatting with a note addressed to Fred tied in a cleft stick.\n\nIt does not pay to wax enthusiastic over natives, even when one\nsuspects they bring good news.  We took the letter from him, told him\nto wait, and went on in.  Once out of the man's hearing Fred tore the\nletter open and read it aloud to us.\n\n\"Herewith my Kazimoto,\" it ran.  \"Be good to him.  It\noccurred to me that you might not care after all to linger in\nNairobi, and it seemed hardly fair to keep the  boy from getting a good\njob simply because he could make me comfortable for the\nremainder of a week.  So, as there happened to be ae special train\ngoing up I begged leave for him to ride in the caboose.  He is\na splendid gun-bearer.  He never funks, but reloads coolly under the\nmost nerve-trying conditions.  He has his limitations, of course,\nbut I have found him brave and faithful, and I  pass him along to you\nwith confidence.\n\n\"And by the way:  he has been to Mount Elgon with me.  I\nwas not looking for buried ivory, but he knows where the caves\nare in which anything might be!\n\n\"Wishing you all good luck,  Yours truly,\n                                                        \"F. Courtney\"\n\nFor the moment we felt like men possessed of a new horse apiece.  We\nwere for dashing out to look the acquisition over.  But Will checked us.\n\n\"Recall what Courtney said about a dog?\" he asked.  \"We can't all own\nhim!\"\n\nFred sat down.  \"Ex-missionaries own dice,\" he announced.  \"That's how\nthey come to be ex!  You'll find them in the little box on the shelf,\nWill.  We'll throw a main for Kazimoto!\"\n\n\"I know a better gamble than that!'\n\n\"Name it, America.\"\n\n\"Bring the coon in and have him choose.\"\n\nSo I went out and felt tempted to speak cordially to the homeless ugly\nblack man--to give him a hint that he was welcome.  But it is a fatal\nmistake to make a \"soft\" impression on even the best natives at the\nstart.\n\n\"Karibu!\"* I said gruffly when I had looked him over, using one of the\nsix dozen Swahili words I knew as yet.  [*Karibu, enter, come in.]\n\nHe arose with the unlabored ease that I have since learned to look for\nin all natives worth employing; and followed me indoors.  Will and\nFred were seated in judicial attitudes, and I took a chair beside them.\n\n\"What is your name?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"Kazimoto.\"\n\n\"Um-m!  That means 'Work-like-the-devil.'  Let us hope you live up to\nit.  Your former master gives you a good character.\"\n\n\"Why not, bwana?  My spirit is good.\"\n\n\"Do you want work?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How much money do you expect to get?\"\n\n\"Sijui!\"\n\n\"Don't say sijui!\" I cut in, remembering Schillingschen's method.\n\n\"Six rupees a month and posho,\" he said promptly.  Posho means rations,\nor money in lieu of rations.\n\n\"Don't you rather fancy yourself?\" suggested Fred with a perfectly\nstraight face.\n\n\"Say two dollars a month all told!\" Will whispered to me behind his\nhand.\n\n\"I am a good gun-bearer!\" the native answered.  \"My spirit is good.  I\nam strong.  There is nobody better than me as a gun-bearer!\"\n\n\"We happen to want a headman,\" answered Fred.  \"Have you ever been\nheadman?\"\n\n\"Would you like to be?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you able?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Choose, then.  Which of us would you like to work for?\"\n\n\"You!\" he answered promptly, pointing at Fred.\n\nIt was on the tip of the tongue of every one of us to ask him instantly\nwhy, but that would have been too rank indiscretion.  It never pays to\nseem curious about a native's personal reasons, and it was many weeks\nbefore we knew why he had made up his mind in advance to choose Fred\nand not either of us for his master.\n\nHis choice made, and the offer of his services accepted, he took over\nFred forthwith--demanded his keys--found out which our room was--went\nover our belongings and transferred the best of our things into Fred's\nbag and the worst of his into ours--remade Fred's bed after a\nmysterious fashion of his own, taking one of my new blankets and one of\nWill's in exchange for Fred's old ones--cleaned Fred's guns thoroughly\nafter carefully abstracting the oil and waste from our gun-cases and\ntransferring them to Fred's--removed the laces from my shooting boots\nand replaced them with Fred's knotted ones--sharpened Fred's razors and\nshaved himself with mine (to the enduring destruction of its once\nartistic edge)--and departed in the direction of the bazaar.\n\nHe returned at the end of an hour and a half with a motley following of\nabout twenty, arrayed in blankets of every imaginable faded hue and in\nevery stage of dirtiness.\n\n\"You wanting cook,\" he announced.  \"These three making cook.\"\n\nHe waved three nondescripts to the front, and we chose a tall Swahili\nbecause he grinned better than the others.  \"Although,\" as Fred\nremarked, \"what the devil grinning has to do with cooking is more than\nanybody knows.\"  The man, whose name was Juma, turned out to be an\nexecrable cook, but as he never left off grinning under any\ncircumstances (and it would have been impossible to imagine\ncircumstances worse than those we warred with later on) we never had\nthe heart to dismiss him.\n\nAfter that, Will and I selected a servant apiece who were destined\nforever to wage war on Kazimoto in hopeless efforts to prevent his\ngiving Fred the best end of everything.  Mine was a Baganda who called\nhimself Matches, presumably because his real name was unpronounceable.\nWill chose a Malindi boy named Tengeneza (and that means arrange in\norder, fix, make over, manage, mend--no end of an ominous name!).  They\nwere both outclassed from the start by Kazimoto, but to add to the\nhandicap he insisted that since he was a headman he would need some one\nto help look after Fred at times when other duties would monopolize his\nattention.  He himself picked out an imp of mischief whose tribe I\nnever ascertained, but who called himself Simba (lion), and there and\nthen Simba departed up-stairs to steal for Fred whatever was left of\nvalue among Will's effects and mine.\n\nWe had scarcely got used to the idea of once more having a savage\napiece to wait on us when Kazimoto turned up at the door with a string\nof porters and a Goanese railway clerk.  We had left our tents and\nheavy baggage checked at the station, but had said nothing about them\nto our new headman; however, he had made inquiries and worked out a\nplan on his own account.  The railway clerk asked to know whether he\nshould let Kazimoto have our things.\n\n\"Why?\"' demanded Fred.\n\n\"This hotel no good!\" announced Kazimoto.  \"No place for boys.  Heap\ntoo many plenty people.  Pitching camp, that good!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Fred, and then and there paid our baggage charges.\n\nPresently Brown of Lumbwa, who had spent most of the daylight hours in\nthe little corrugated iron bar run by a Goanese in the bazaar, came\nlurching past the township camping ground, and viewed Kazimoto with his\ngang pitching our tents.  He asked questions, but could get no\ninformation, so came along to us.\n\n\"Where you schaps going?\" he demanded, leaning against the wall.  Fred\ntook advantage of the opportunity and examined him narrowly as to his\nknowledge of German East and ways of getting there.  He was in an\naggravating mood that made at one moment a very well of information of\nhim, and at the next a mere garrulous ass.\n\n\"Come along o' me t' Lumbwa,\" was his final word on the matter.  \"I'll\nput you on a road nobody knows an' nobody, uses!\"\n\nWe spent that night under canvas and talked the matter out.  The usual\nway to reach Lumbwa was to wait for a freight, or construction train\nand beg leave to ride on that, for as yet, no passenger trains were\nrunning regularly on the western section of the line.  But there was no\nrule against traveling anywhere south of the equator, and it was our\npurpose to march down into German East without any one being the wiser.\n\nThe next morning we imagined Brown was sober and sorry enough to hold\nhis tongue, so, without going into details with him, we agreed to go\nwith him \"some of the way,\" and Fred spent the whole of that morning in\nthe bazaar buying loads of food and general supplies.  Will and I\nengaged porters, and with Kazimoto's aid as interpreter, had fifty\nready to march that afternoon.\n\nThe whole trick of starting on a journey is to start.  If you only make\na mile or two the first day you have at least done better than stand\nstill; loads have been apportioned and porters broken in to some\nextent; you have broken the spell of inertia, and hereafter there is\nless likely to be trouble.  We made up our minds to get away that\nafternoon, and I was sent back to the hotel to find Brown, who had gone\nfor his belongings.\n\nIf Brown had stayed sober all might have been well, but his headache\nand feeling of unworthiness had been too much for him and I found him\nwith a straw in the neck of a bottle of whisky alternately laying down\nlaw to Georges Coutlass and drinking himself into a state of temporary\nbliss.\n\n\"You Greeks dunno nothin'!\" he asserted as I came in.  \"You never did\nknow nothin', an' you're never goin' to know nothin'!  'Cause why?\n'I'll tell you.  Simply because I am goin' to tell!  I'm mum, I am!\nWhen s'mother gents an' me 'ave business, that's our business--see!\nNone o' your business--'ss our business, an' I'm not goin' to tell you\nGreeks nothin' about where we're off to, nor why, nor when.  An' you\nput that in your pipe an' smoke it!\"\n\nI sat in the dining-room for a while, hoping that the Greek would go\naway; but as Brown was fast drinking himself into a condition when he\ncould not have been moved except on stretcher, and was momentarily\nedging closer to an admission of all he knew or guessed about our\nintention, I took the bull by the horns at last--snatched away his\nwhisky bottle, and walked off with it.\n\nHe came after me swearing like a trooper, and his own porters, who had\nbeen waiting for more than an hour beside his loads, trailed along\nafter him.  Once in our camp we made a hammock for him out of a blanket\ntied to a pole, and made him over to two porters with the promise that\nthey would get no supper if they lost him.  Then we started--uphill,\ntoward the red Kikuyu heights, where settlers were already trying to\ngrow potatoes for which there was no market, and onions that would only\nrun to seed.\n\nTo our left rear and right front were the highest mountain ranges in\nAfrica.  Before us was the pass through which the railway threaded over\nthe wide high table-land before dipping downward to Victoria Nyanza.\nOn our left front was all Kikuyu country, and after that Lumbwa, and\nnative reserves, and forest, and swamp, and desert, and the German\nboundary.\n\nWe made a long march of it that first day, and camped after dark within\ntwo miles of Kikuyu station.  Most of the scrub thereabouts was castor\noil plant, that makes very poor fuel; yet there were lions in plenty\nthat roared and scouted around us even before the tents were pitched.\n\nNobody got much sleep that night, although the porters were perfectly\nindifferent to the risk of snoozing on the watch.  Kazimoto produced a\nthing called a kiboko--a whip of hippopotamus-hide a yard and a half\nlong, and with the aid of that and Will's good humor we constituted a\nyelling brigade, whose business was to make the welkin ring with\ngodless noises whenever a lion came close enough to be dangerous.\n\nI made up a signal party of all our personal boys with our lanterns,\nswinging them in frantic patterns in the darkness in a way to terrify\nthe very night itself.  Fred played concertina nearly all night long,\nand when dawn came, though there were tracks of lions all about the\ncamp we were only tired and sleepy.  Nobody was missing; nobody killed.\n\nWe never again took lions so seriously, although we always built fires\nabout the camp in lion country when that was possible.  Partly by dint\nof carelessness that brought no ill results, and partly from\nobservation we learned that where game is plentiful lions are more\ncurious than dangerous, and that unless something should happen to\nenrage them, or the game has gone away and they are hungry, they are\nlikely to let well alone.\n\nIf there are dogs in camp--and we bought three terrier pups that\nmorning from a settler at Kikuyu--leopards are likely to be more\ntroublesome than lions.  The leopards seemed to yearn for dog-meat much\nas Brown of Lumbwa yearned for whisky.\n\nThe journey to Lumbwa is one of the pleasantest I remember.  We took\nBrown's supply of whisky from him, locked up with our own, sent him\nahead in the hammock, and let him work as guide by promises of\nwhisky for supper if he did his duty, and threats of mere cold water if\nhe failed.\n\n\"But water rots my stomach!\" he objected.\n\n\"Lead on, then!\" was the invariable, remorseless answer.  So Brown led\nuntil we reached Naivasha with its strange lake full of hippo at an\nelevation so great that the mornings are frosty (and that within sight\nof the line).  There was never a day that we were once out of sight of\ngame from dawn to dark.  When we awoke the morning mist would scatter\nslowly and betray sleepy herds of antelope, that would rise leisurely,\nstand staring at us, suddenly become suspicious, and then gallop off\nuntil the whole plain was a panorama of wheeling herds, reminding one\nof the cavalry maneuvers at Aldershot when the Guards regiments were\npitted against the regular cavalry--all riding and no wits.\n\nAlthough we had to shoot enough meat for ourselves and men, we never\nonce took advantage of those surprise parties in the early morning,\npreferring to stalk warier game at the end of a long march.  The rains\nwere a thing of the past, and we seldom troubled to pitch tents but\nslept under the stars with a sensation that the universe was one vast\nplace of peace.\n\nOccasionally we reached an elevation from which we could look down and\nsee men toiling to build the railway, that already reached Nyanza after\nthe unfinished fashion of work whose chief aim is making a showing.\nProfits, performances were secondary matters; that railway's one\npurpose was to establish occupation of the head waters of the Nile and\nrefute the German claim to prior rights there.  At irregular intervals\ntrains already went down to the lake, and passengers might ride on\nsuffrance; but we deluded ourselves with the belief that by marching\nwe threw enemies off the scent.  It was pure delusion, but extremely\npleasant while it lasted.  Where Africa is green and high she is a\nlovely land to march across.\n\nBrown grew sober on the trip, as if approaching his chosen home gave\nhim a sense of responsibility.  His own reason for preferring the march\nto a ride in a construction train was simple:\n\n\"Every favor you ask o' gov'ment, boys, leaves one less to fall back on\nin a pinch!  Ask not, and they'll forget some o' your peccadillos.  Ask\ntoo often, and one day when you really need a kindness you'll find the\nBank o' Good Hope bu'sted!  And, believe me, boys, that 'ud be a hell\nof a predicament for a poor sufferin' settler to find himself in!\"\n\nThe approach to Lumbwa was over steep hilly grass land, between forests\nof cedar--perfect country, kept clean by a wind that smelt of fern and\nclover.\n\n\"You can tell we're gettin' near my place,\" said Brown, \"by the number\no' leopards that's about.\"\n\nWe had to keep our three pups close at heel all the time, and even at\nthat we lost two of them.  One was taken from between Will's feet as he\nsat in camp cleaning his rifle.  All he heard was the dog's yelp, and\nall he saw was a flash of yellow as the leopard made for the boulders\nclose at hand.  The other was taken out of my tent.  I had tied it to\nthe tent pole, but the stout cord snapped like a hair and the darkness\nswallowed both leopard and its prey before I could as much as reach my\nrifle to get a shot.\n\n\"Splendid country for farmin',\" Brown remarked, \"Splendid.  Only you\ncan't keep sheep because the leopards take 'em.  You can't keep hens\nfor the same reason.  Nor yet cows, because the leopards get the\ncalves--leastways, that's to say unless you watch out awful cautious.\nNor yet you can't keep pigeons, 'cause the leopards take them too.  I\nsent to England for fancy pigeons--a dozen of em.  Leopards got all but\none, so I put him in the loft above my own house, where it seemed to me\n'tweren't possible for a leopard to get, supposin' he'd dared.  Went\naway the next day for some shootin', an' lo and behold!--came back that\nevenin' to discover my cook an' three others carryin' on as if Kingdom\nCome had took place at last.  Never heard or saw such a jamboree.  The\nblamed leopard was up in the loft; and had eaten the pigeon, feathers\nand all, but couldn't get out again!\"\n\n\"What happened?  Nothin'!  I was that riled I didn't stop to\nthink--fixed a bayonet on the old Martini the gov'ment supplies to\nsettlers out of the depths of its wisdom an' generosity--climbed up by\nthe same route the leopard took--invaded him--an' skewered him wi' the\nbayonet in the dark!  I wouldn't do it again for a kingdom--but I won't\nbuy more pigeons either!\"\n\n\"What do you raise on your farm, then--pigs?\" we asked.\n\n\"No, the leopards take pigs.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Well--as I was explainin' to that Greek Georges Coutlass at\nNairobi--there's a way of farmin' out your cattle among the natives\nthat beats keepin' 'em yourself.  The natives put 'em in the village\npen o' nights; an' besides, they know about the business.\n\n\"All you need do is give 'em a heifer calf once in a while, and they're\ncontented.  I keep a herd o' two hundred cows in a native village not\nfar from my place.  The natural increase o' them will make me\nwell-to-do some day.\"\n\nThe day before we reached Brown's tiny homestead we heard a lot of\nshooting over the hill behind us.\n\n\"That'll be railway men takin' a day off after leopards,\" announced\nBrown with the air of a man who can not be mistaken.\n\nNevertheless, Fred and I went back to see, but could make out nothing.\nWe lay on the top of the hill and watched for two or three hours, but\nalthough we heard rifle firing repeatedly we did not once catch sight\nof smoke or men.  We marched into camp late that night with a feeling\nof foreboding that we could not explain but that troubled us both\nequally.\n\nOnce or twice in the night we heard firing again, as if somebody's camp\nnot very far away was invaded by leopards, or perhaps lions.  Yet at\ndawn there were no signs of tents.  And when that night we arrived at\nBrown's homestead we seemed to have the whole world to ourselves.\n\nBrown's house was a tiny wooden affair with a thick grass roof.  It\nboasted a big fireplace at one end of the living-room, and a chimney\nthat Brown had built himself so cunningly that smoke could go up and\nout but no leopards could come down.\n\nHe got very drunk that night to celebrate the home-coming, and stayed\ncompletely drunk for three days, we making use of his barn to give our\nporters a good rest.  By day we shot enough meat for the camp, and at\nnight we sat over the log fire, praying that Brown might sober up, Fred\nsinging songs to his infernal concertina, and all the natives who could\ncrowd in the doorway listening to him with all their ears.  Fred made\nvast headway in native favor, and learned a lot of two languages at\nonce.\n\nEvery day we sent Kazimoto and another boy exploring among the Lumbwa\ntribe, gathering information as to routes and villages, and it was\nKazimoto who came running in breathless one night just as Brown was at\nlast sobering up, with the news that some Greeks had swooped down on\nBrown's cattle, had wounded two or three of the villagers who herded\nthem, and had driven the whole herd away southward.\n\nThat news sobered Brown completely.  He took the bottle of whisky he\nhad just brought up from the cellar and replaced it unopened.\n\n\"There's on'y one Greek in the world knew where my cattle were!\" he\nannounced grimly.  \"There's on'y one Greek I ever talked to about\ncattle.  Coutlass, by the great horn spoon!  The blackguard swore he\nwas after you chaps--swore he didn't care nothing about me!  What he\ndid to you was none o' my business, o' course--an' I figured anyway as\nyou could look out for yourselves!  Not that I told the swine any o'\nyour business, mind!  Not me!  I was so sure he was gunnin' for you\nthat I told him my own business to throw him off your track!  And now\nthe devil goes an' turns on me!\"\n\nHe got down his rifle and began overhauling it, feverishly, yet with a\ndeliberate care that was curious in a man so recently drunk.  While he\ncleaned and oiled be gave orders to his own boys; and what with having\nservants of our own and having to talk to them mostly in the native\ntongue, we were able to understand pretty well the whole of what he\nsaid.\n\n\"You're not going to start after them to-night?\" Fred objected.  But he\nand Will were also already overhauling weapons, for the second time\nthat evening.  (It is religion with the true hunter never to eat supper\nuntil his rifle is cleaned and oiled.)  I got my own rifle down from\nthe shelf over Brown's stone mantelpiece.\n\n\"What d'you take me for?\" demanded Brown.  \"There's one pace they'll go\nat, an' that's the fastest possible.  There's one place they'll head\nfor, an' that's German East.  They can't march faster than the cattle,\nan' the cattle'll have to eat.  Maybe they'll drive 'em all through the\nfirst night, and on into the next day; but after that they'll have to\nrest 'em an' graze 'em a while.  That's when we'll begin to gain.  The\ntireder the cattle get, the faster we'll overhaul 'em, for we can eat\nwhile we're marchin', which the cattle can't!  You chaps just stay here\nan' look after my farm till I come back!\"\n\n\"You mean you propose to go alone after them?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Why not?  Whose cattle are they?\"\n\nHe was actually disposed to argue the point.\n\n\"Man alive, there'll be shootin'!\" he insisted.  \"If they once get over\nthe border with all those cattle, the Germans'll never hand 'em over\nuntil every head o' cattle's gone.  They'll fine 'em, an' arrest 'em,\nan' trick 'em, an' fine 'em again until the Germans own the herd all\nlegal an' proper--an' then they'll chase the Greeks back to British\nEast for punishment same as they always do.  What good 'ud that be to\nme?  No, no!  Me--I'm going to catch 'em this side o' the line, or else\nbu'st--an' I won't be too partic'lar where the line's drawn either!\nThere's maybe a hundred miles to the south o' their line that the\nGermans don't patrol more often than once in a leap-year.  If I catch\nthem Greeks in any o' that country, I'm going to kid myself deliberate\nthat it's British East, and act accordin'!\"\n\nAt last we convinced him, although I don't remember how, for he was\nobstinate from the aftermath of whisky, that we would no more permit\nhim to go alone than he would consider abandoning his cattle.  Then we\nhad to decide who should follow with our string of porters, for if\nforced marching was in order it was obvious that we should far\noutdistance our train.\n\nWe invited Brown to follow with all the men while we three skirmished\nahead, but he waxed so apoplectically blasphemous at the very thought\nof it that Fred assured him the proposal was intended for a joke.  Then\nwe argued among ourselves, coaxed, blarneyed, persuaded, and tried to\nbribe one another.  Finally, all else failing, we tossed a coin for it,\nodd man out, and Fred lost.\n\nSo Brown, Will Yerkes and I, with Kazimoto, our two personal servants,\nand six boys to carry one tent for the lot of us and food and cooking\npots, started off just as the moon rose over the nearest cedars, and\nlaughed at Fred marshaling the sleepy porters by lamplight in the open\nspace between the house and barn.  He was to follow as fast as the\nloaded porters could be made to travel, and with that concertina of his\nto spur them on there was little likelihood of losing touch.  But the\nrear-guard, when it comes to pursuing a retreating enemy, is ever the\nleast alluring place.\n\n\"You've got all the luck,\" he shouted.  \"Make the most of it or I'll\nnever gamble on the fall of a coin again!\"\n\nThat pursuit was a journey of accidents, chapter after chapter of them\nin such close sequence that the whole was a nightmare without let-up or\nreason.  I began the book by falling into an elephant pit.\n\nBefore we had gone a mile in the dark we stood in doubt as to whether\nthe most practicable trail went right or left.  Brown set his own\nindecision down frankly to the whisky that had muddled him.  Even\nKazimoto, who had passed that way three times, did not know for\ncertain.  So I went forward to scout--stepped into the deep shadow of\nsome jungle--trod on nothing--threw the other foot forward to save\nmyself--and fell downward into blackness for an eternity.\n\nI brought up at last unhurt in the trash and decaying vegetation at the\nbottom of a pit, and looked up to see the stars in a rough\nparallelogram above me, whose edge I guessed was more than thirty feet\nabove my head.  I started to dig my way out, but the crumbling sides\nfell in and threatened to bury me alive unless I kept still.  So I\nshouted until my lungs ached, but without result.  I suppose the noise\nwent trumpeting upward out of the hole and away to the clouds and the\nstars.  At any rate, Will and Brown swore afterward they never heard it.\n\nI was fifteen minutes in the hole that very likely had held many an\nelephant with his legs wedged together under him until the poor brute\nperished of thirst, before it occurred to me to fire my rifle.  I fired\nseveral shots when I did think of it; but we had agreed on no system\nof signals, and instead of coming to find me at once, the other two\ncursed me for wasting time shooting at leopards in the dark instead of\nscouting for the track.  I used twenty cartridges before they came to\nsee what sort of battle I was waging, and with the last shot I nearly\nblew Brown's helmet off as he stooped over the hole to look down in.\n\nThen there were more precious minutes wasted while someone cut a long\npole for me to swarm up, and at the end of that time, when I stood on\nfirm ground at last and wiped the blood from hands and knees, we were\nno wiser about the proper direction to take.\n\nThe next accident was a little before midnight.  Will Yerkes was\nleading, I following, next the boys, and Brown bringing up the rear\n(for in those wild hills there is never a good track wide enough for\ntwo men to march abreast.  Even the cattle proceed in single file\nunless driven furiously.)  Will came on a leopard devouring its kill, a\nfat buck, in the midst of the track in the moonlight, and the brute\nresented the interruption of his meal.  It slunk into the shadows\nbefore Will could get a shot at it, and for the next two hours followed\nus, slinking from shadow to shadow, snarling and growling.  It plainly\nintended murder, but which of us was to be the victim, and when, there\nwas no means of guessing, so that the nerves of all of us were tortured\nevery time the brute approached.\n\nWe wasted at least thirty cartridges on futile efforts to guess his\nwhereabouts in velvet black shadows, and Brown went through all the\nstages from simple nervousness to fear, and then to frenzy, until we\nfeared he would shoot one of us in frantic determination to ring the\nleopard's knell.\n\nAt last the brute did rush in, and of course where least expected.  He\nseized one of our porters by the shoulder, his claws doing more damage\nthan his teeth. I shot him by thrusting my rifle into his ear, and\nalthough that dropped him instantly his claws, in the dying spasm and\nby the weight of his fall, tore wounds in the man's arm eighteen or\ntwenty inches long.\n\nOne of the things we did have with us was bandages.  But it took time\nto attend to the man's wounds properly by lamp and moonlight, and after\nthat he could neither march fast, nor was there anywhere to leave him.\n\nSo just before dawn Fred came up with us, and was more pleased at our\ndiscomfiture than sympathetic. He told off two men to carry the injured\nporter to a mission station more than a day's march away, and\nredistributed the loads. Then we went on again, once more placing rock,\nhill, and cedar forest between us and our supply column, this time with\nFred's counsel ringing in our ears.\n\n\"Better send for nursemaids and perambulators, and have yourselves\npushed!\"\n\nAt noon that day we found the track of the driven cattle, and soon\nafter that came on the half-devoured carcass of a heifer that the\nGreeks had shot, presumably because it could not march, and perhaps\nwith the added reason that freshly-killed meat would draw off leopards\nand hyenas and provide peace for a few miles.\n\nOnce on the trail it would not have been easy to lose it, except in the\ndark, for the Greek marauders were bent on speed and the driven cattle\nhad smashed down the undergrowth in addition to leaving deep\nhoof-prints at every water-course.\n\nThe first suspicion that dawned on me of something more than mere\nfreebooting on the part of Coutlass, was due to the discovery of\nhoof-prints of either mules or horses.  I was marching alone in\nadvance, and came on them beside a stream that was only apparently\nfordable in that one place.  After making sure of what they were I\nhalted to let Will and Brown catch up.\n\n\"Did Coutlass have money enough to buy mules for himself and gang?\"\nwondered Will.\n\n\"That robber?\" snorted Brown.  \"When Lady Saffren Waldon refused him\ntobacco money in the hotel he tried to borrow from me!\"\n\n\"Where could be steal mules?\" Will asked.\n\n\"Nowhere. Aren't any!\"\n\n\"Horses' then?\"\n\n\"He'd never take horses.  They'd die.\"\n\n\"What are they riding, then?\"\n\n\"Unless he stole trained zebras from the gov'ment farm at Naivasha,\"\nsaid Brown, \"an' they're difficulter to ride 'an a greasy pole up-ended\non a earthquake, he must ha' bought mules from the one man who has any\nto sell.  And he lives t'other side o' Nairobi.  There are none between\nthere and here--none whatever.  Zachariah Korn--him who owns mules--is\ntoo wide awake to be stolen from.  He bought 'em, you take it from me,\nand paid twice what they were worth into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Then he bought them with her money!\" said Will.\n\n\"If not Schillingschen's,\" said I.\n\n\"Or the Sultan of Zanzibar's\" said Will, \"or the German government's.\"\n\n\"But why?  Why should she, or they, conspire at great expense and risk\nto steal Brown's cattle?\"\n\n\"They'll figure,\" said Will, \"that Brown is helping us, and therefore,\nBrown is an enemy.  Prob'ly they surmise Brown is in league with us to\nshow us a short cut to what we're after.  If that's how they work it\nout, then they wouldn't need think much to conclude that putting Brown\non the blink would hoodoo us. Maybe they allow that that much bad luck\nto begin with would unsettle Brown's friendly feelings for us.\nAnyway--somebody bought the mules--somebody stole the cattle--cattle\nare somewhere ahead.  Let's hurry forward and see!\"\n\nWe did hurry, but made disgustingly poor time.  Once a dozen buffalo\nstampeded our tiny column.  Our five porters dropped their loads, and\nthe biggest old bull mistook our only tent for our captain's dead body\nand proceeded to play ball with it, tossing it and tearing it to pieces\nuntil at last Will got a chance for a shoulder shot and drilled him\nneatly.  Two other bulls took to fighting in the midst of the\nexcitement and we got both of them.  Then the rest trotted off; so we\npacked the horns of the dead ones on the head of our free porter (for\nthe tent he had carried was now utterly no use) and hastened on.\n\nOnce, in trying to make a cut that should have saved us ten or fifteen\nmiles between two rivers, we fell shoulder-deep into a bog and only\nescaped after an hour's struggle during which we all but lost two\nporters.  We had to retrace our steps and follow the Greek's route,\nonly to have the mortification of seeing Fred and our column of\nsupplies coming over the top of a rise not eight miles behind us.\n\nDetermined not to be overtaken by him a second time and treated to\nadvice about nursemaids, we dispensed with sleep altogether for that\nnight, and nearly got drowned at the second river.\n\nWe found a native who owned a thing he called a mtungi--a near-canoe,\nburned out of a tree-trunk.  He assured us the ford was very winding\n(he drew a wiggly finger-mark in the mud by way of illustration) but\nthat his boat would hold twice our number, and that he could take us\nover easily in the dark.  In fact he swore he had ferried twice our\nnumber over on darker nights more than twenty or thirty times.  He also\nsaid that he had taken the cattle over by the ford early that morning,\nand then had crossed over in the boat with two Greeks and a bwana Goa.\nHe showed us the brass wire and beads they gave him in proof of that\nstatement, and we began to put some faith in his tale.\n\nSo we all piled into his crazy boat with our belongings, and he\npromptly lost the way amid the twelve-foot grass-papyrus mostly--that\ndivided the river into narrow streams and afforded protection to the\nmost savagely hungry mosquitoes in the world.  Our faces and hands were\nwet with blood in less than two minutes.\n\nPresently, instead of finding bottom for his pole, he pushed us into\ndeep water.  The grass disappeared, and a ripple on the water lipping\ndangerously within three inches of our uneven gunwale proved that we\nwere more or less in the main stream.  We had enjoyed that sensation\nfor about a minute, and were headed toward where we supposed the\nopposite bank must be, when a hippo in a hurry to breathe blew just\nbeside us--saw, smelt, or heard us (it was all one to him)--and dived\nagain.\n\nI suppose in order to get his head down fast enough he shoved his rump\nup, and his great fat back made a wave that ended that voyage abruptly.\nOur three inches of broadside vanished.  The canoe rocked violently,\nfilled, turned over, and floated wrong side up.\n\n\"All the same,\" laughed Will, spluttering and spitting dirty water,\n\"here's where the crocks get fooled!  They don't eat me for supper!\"\n\nHe was first on top of the overturned boat, and dragged me up after\nhim.  Together we hauled up Brown, who could not swim but was\nbombastically furious and unafraid; and the three of us pulled out the\nporters and the fatuous boat's owner.  The pole was floating near by,\nand I swam down-stream and fetched it.  When they had dragged me back\non to the wreck the moon came out, and we saw the far bank hazily\nthrough mist and papyrus.\n\nThe boat floated far more steadily wrong side up, perhaps because we\nhad lashed all our loads in place and they acted as ballast.  Will took\nthe pole and acted the part of Charon, our proper pilot contenting\nhimself with perching on the rear end lamenting the ill-fortune noisily\nuntil Kazimoto struck him and threatened to throw him back into the\nwater.\n\n\"They don't want a fool like you in the other world,\" he assured him.\n\"You will die of old age!\"\n\nThe papyrus inshore was high enough to screen the moon from us, and we\nhad to hunt a passage through it in pitch darkness.  Then, having found\nthe muddy bank at last (and more trillions of mosquitoes) we had to\ndrag the overturned boat out high and dry to rescue our belongings.\nAnd that was ticklish work, because most of the crocodiles, and\npractically all the largest ones, spend the night alongshore.\n\nMatches were wet.  We had no means of making a flare to frighten the\nmonsters away.  We simply had to \"chance it\" as cheerfully and swiftly\nas we could, and at the end of a half-hour's slimy toil we carried our\nmuddied loads to the nearest high ground and settled down there for the\nnight.\n\nIt would be mad exaggeration to say we camped.  Wet to the skin--dirty\nto the verge of feeling suicidal--bitten by insects until the blood ran\ndown from us--lost (for we had no notion where the end of the ford\nmight be)--at the mercy of any prowling beasts that might discover us\n(for our rifle locks were fouled with mud)--we sat with chattering\nteeth and waited for the morning.\n\nWhen the sun rose we found a village less than four hundred yards away\nand sent the boys down to it to unpack the loads and spread everything\nin the sun to dry, while we went down to the river again and washed our\nrifles.  Then we dried and oiled them, and without a word of bargain or\nexplanation, invaded the cleanest looking hut, lay down on the stamped\nclay floor, and slept.  It was only clean-looking, that hut.  It housed\nmore myraids of fleas than the air outside supported \"skeeters\"; but we\nslept, unconscious of them all.\n\nAt four that afternoon we had the mortification of being roused by\nFred's voice, and the dumping of loads as his sixty porters dropped\ntheir burdens inside the village stockade.  He had scorned the ferry\nand crossed the ford on foot, making a prodigious splash to keep\ncrocodiles away, and was as full of life and fun as a schoolboy on\nvacation.\n\n\"Wake up, you vorloopers!\" he shouted.  \"Wake up!  Shake off the fleas\nand come, and I'll show you something.\"\n\nHe had already had the tale of our night's misfortune in detail from\nthe owner of the only canoe (who claimed double pay on the ground that\nwe had lost no loads in spite of over-turning.  \"The last really white\nman who crossed lost all his loads!\" he explained.).\n\n\"Come and I'll show you something you never saw before, you\nscouts!--you advance guard!--you line of skirmishers!\"\n\nWill hurled a lump of earth at him, and chased him to the river, where\nthey wrestled, trying to throw each other in, until both were\nbreathless.  Then, when neither could make another effort:\n\n\"Look!\" gasped Fred.\n\nThere was an island in mid-stream below where we must have crossed.\nThe stream was straight, and from where we stood we could see more than\nhalf a mile of alluvial mud with an arm of the river on either side.\nThe mud was white, not black--so white that it dazzled the eyes to look\nat it.\n\n\"Know what it is?\" Fred panted.\n\nWe did not know, and it was no use guessing.  It looked like burned\nlime, or else the secretions of about a billion birds; and there were\nno birds to speak of.\n\n\"Crocodile eggs!\" said Fred.\n\nWe did not believe that.  Even Brown did not believe it.  There was no\ntime to spare, but Brown out of curiosity agreed, so we took the absurd\ncanoe and poled down to investigate.  As we came nearer the solid white\nbroke up into a myriad dots, and Fred's tale stood confirmed.\n\nThey were as long as two hens' eggs laid end to end, or longer.  They\nlay in the sun in batches in every stage of incubation, and from almost\nevery batch there were little crocodiles emerging, that made straight\nfor the water.  What worse monster preyed on them to keep their numbers\ndown, or what disease took care of their prolixity we could not guess.\nPerhaps they ate one another, or just died of hunger.  The owner of the\nboat vowed there were no fish left in the river, and that the\ncrocodiles did not eat hippo unless it were first dead.\n\nWe took another tent from among Fred's loads, changed two of our\nporters for stronger ones, and went forward that evening; for it began\nto be obvious that the speed had been telling on the cattle.  We passed\ntwo more dead heifers within a few miles of the river bank, and there\nwere other signs that for all our long sleep we were gaining on them.\n\nPerhaps the Greeks thought they had shaken off pursuit.  Judging by the\ncompass they were headed for the shore of Victoria Nyanza, where the\ngrazing would be better, food for men would be purchaseable, and the\nnumber of villages closely spaced would make the task of night-herding\nvastly easier.  There isn't a village in that part of Africa that is\nnot proud to be a host to anybody's cattle, if only because the\nownership of so much living wealth casts glory on all who come in\ncontact with it.\n\nThere was no means of telling whether or not we were over the German\nborder.  The boundary line had not been surveyed yet, and on the map\nthe part where we were was set down as \"unexplored,\" although that was\nscarcely accurate; the route was well enough known to Greeks and\nArabs, and other bad characters bent on smuggling or in some other way\ndefeating the ends of justice.\n\nWe marched that night until midnight, slept until dawn, and were off\nagain.  At noon we reached rising ground, and Kazimoto ran ahead of us\nto the summit.  We saw him standing at gaze for three or four minutes\nwith one hand shading his eyes before he came scampering back, as\nexcited as if his own fortune were in the balance.\n\n\"Hooko-chini!\" he shouted. \"Hooko-chini--mba-a-a-li sana!\"--(They're\ndown below there, very far away!)\n\nWe hurried up-hill, but for many minutes could see nothing except a\nplain of waving grass higher than a man's head and almost as\nimpenetrable as bamboo-country that carried small hope in it for man or\nbeast, that would be a holocaust in the dry season when the heat set\nfire to the grass, and was an insect-haunted marsh at most other times.\nHowever, path across it there must be, for the Greeks had driven\nBrown's cattle that way that very morning, and Kazimoto swore he could\nsee them in the distance, although Brown, and Will, and I--all three\nkeen-sighted--could see nothing whatever but immeasurable, worthless\nwaving grass.\n\nAt last I detected a movement near the horizon that did not synchronize\nwith the wind-blown motion of the rest.  I pointed it out to the\nothers, and after a few minutes we agreed that it moved against the\nwind.\n\n\"They're hurrying again,\" said Brown, peering under both hands.\n\"There's no feed for cattle on all this plain.  They're racing to get\nto short grass before the cattle all die.  Come on--let's hurry after\n'em!\"\n\nFor the second time on that trip we essayed a short cut, making as\nstraight as a bee would fly for the point on the horizon where we knew\nthe Greeks to be.  And for the second time we fell into a bog, nearly\nlosing our lives in it.  We had to pull one another out, using even our\nprecious rifles as supports in the yielding mud, and then spending\nequally precious time in cleaning locks and sights again.\n\nAfter that we hunted for the cattle trail and followed that closely;\nand that was not so easy as it reads, because the trampled grass had\nrisen again, and cattle and mounted men can cross easily ground that\ndelays men on foot.\n\nThe heat was that of an oven.  The water--what there was of it in the\nholes and swampy places--stank, and tasted acrid.  The flies seemed to\ngreet us as their only prospect of food that year.  The monotony of\nhurrying through grass-stems that cut off all view and only showed the\nsky through a waving curtain overhead was more nerve-trying than the\nphysical weariness and thirst.\n\nWe slept a night in that grass, burning some of it for a smudge to keep\nmosquitoes at bay, and an hour after dawn, reaching rising ground\nagain, realized that we had our quarry within reach at last.\n\nThey were out in the open on short good grazing.  The Greeks' tent was\npitched.  We could see their mules, like brown insects, tied under a\ntree, and the cattle dotted here and there, some lying down, some\nfeeding.\n\n\"At last!\" said Brown.  \"Boys, they're our meat!  There's a tree to\nhang the Greeks and the Goa to!  When we've done that, if you'll all\ncome back with me I'll send to Nairobi for an extra jar of Irish\nwhisky, and we'll have a spree at Lumbwa that'll make the fall of Rome\nsound like a Sunday-school picnic!  We're in German territory now, all\nright.  There's not a white man for a hundred miles in any\ndirection--except your friend that's coming along behind.  There's\nnobody to carry tales or prevent!  I'm no savage.  I'm no degenerate.\nI don't hold with too much of anything, but--\"\n\n\"There'll be no dirty work, if that's what you mean,\" said Will quietly.\n\nBrown stared hard at him.\n\n\"D'you mean you'll object to hanging 'em?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.  We hang or shoot cattle thieves in the States.  I\nsaid there'll be no dirty work, that's all.\"\n\n\"Shall we rest a while, and come on them fresh in the morning?\" I\nproposed.\n\n\"Forward!\" snorted Brown.  \"Why d'you want to wait?\"\n\n\"Forward it is!\" agreed Will.  \"When we get a bit closer we'll stop and\nhold council of war.\"\n\n\"One minute!\" said I.  \"Tell me what that is?\"\n\nI had been searching the whole countryside, looking for some means of\nstealing on the marauders unawares and finding none.  They had chosen\ntheir camping place very wisely from the point of view of men unwilling\nto be taken by surprise.  Far away over to our right, appearing and\ndisappearing as I watched them, were a number of tiny black dots in\nsort of wide half-moon formation, and a larger number of rather larger\ndots contained within the semicircle.\n\n\"Cattle!\" exploded Brown.\n\n\"And men!\" added Will.\n\n\"Black men!\" said I. \"Black men with spears!\"\n\n\"Masai!\" said Kazimoto excitedly.  He had far the keenest eyes of all\nof us.\n\nWe were silent for several minutes.  The veriest stranger in that land\nknows about the feats and bravery of the Masai, who alone of all tribes\ndid not fear the Arabs, and who terrorized a quarter of a continent\nbefore the British came and broke their power.\n\n\"Mbaia cabisa!\" muttered Kazimoto, meaning that the development was\nvery bad indeed.  And he had right to know.\n\nHe explained it was a raid.  The Masai, in accordance with time-honored\ncustom, had come from British East to raid the lake-shore villages of\nGerman territory, and were driving back the plundered cattle.  None can\ndrive cattle as Masai can.  They can take leg-weary beasts by the tail\nand make them gallop, one beast encouraging the next until they all go\nlike the wind.  For food they drink hot blood, opening a vein in a\nbeast's neck and closing it again when they have had their fill.  Their\nonly luggage is a spear.  Their only speed-limit the maximum the cattle\ncan be stung to.  On a raid three hundred and sixty miles in six days\nis an ordinary rate of traveling.\n\nJust now they did not seem in much hurry.  They had probably butchered\nthe fighting men of all the villages in their rear, and were well\ninformed as to the disposition of the nearest German forces.  There\nwere probably no Germans within a hundred miles.  There was no\ntelegraph in all those parts.  To notify Muanza by runner and Bagamoyo\non the coast from there by wire would take several days. Then Bagamoyo\nwould have to wire the station at Kilimanjaro, and there was no earthly\nchance of Germans intercepting them before they could reach British\nEast.\n\nNor was there any treaty provision between British and German colonial\ngovernments for handing over raiders.  The Germans had refused to make\nany such agreement for reasons best known to themselves.  The fact that\nthey were far the heaviest losers by the lack of reciprocal police\narrangements was due to the fact that most of the Masai lived in\nBritish East.  The Masai would have raided across either border with\nsupreme indifference.\n\n\"Masai not talking.  Masai using spear and kill!\" remarked Kazimoto.\n\n\"One good thing our gov'ment's done,\" said Brown.  \"Just one.  It has\nkept those rascals from owning rifles!  But lordy!  They've got spears\nthat give a man the creeps to see!\"\n\nHe began looking to his rifle.  So did Will and I.\n\n\"Now this here is my fight,\" he explained.  \"Them's my cattle.  They're\nall the wealth I own in the world.  If I lose 'em I'm minded to die\nanyhow.  There's nothing in life for a drunkard like me with all his\nmoney gone and nothing to do but take a mean white's job.  You chaps\njust wait here and watch while I 'tend to my own affairs.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Will answered dryly. \"I've a hundred rounds in my pockets.\nThat ought to be enough.\"\n\nWhile we made ready, leaving our loads and porters in a safe place and\ngiving the boys orders, I saw two things happen.  First, the Masai\nbecame aware of the little Greek encampment and the two hundred head of\ncattle waiting at their mercy; and second, the Greeks grew aware of\nthe Masai.\n\nThe Greeks had boys with them; I saw at least half a dozen go\nscattering to round up the cattle.  The tents began to come down, and I\nsaw three figures that might be the Greeks and the Goanese holding a\nconsultation near the tree.\n\n\"And now,\" remarked Will, \"I begin to see the humor in this comedy.\nWhich are we--allies of the Greeks or of the Masai?  Are we to help the\nGreeks get away with Brown's cattle, or help the Masai steal 'em from\nthe Greeks?  Are your cattle all branded, Brown?\"\n\n\"You blooming well bet they are!\"\n\n\"Masai know enough to alter a brand?\"\n\n\"Never heard o' their doing it.\"\n\n\"Then if the Masai get away with them to British East, if you can find\n'em you can claim 'em, eh?\"\n\n\"Claim 'em in court wi' the whole blooming tribe o' Masai--more'n a\nquarter of a million of 'em--all on hand to swear they bought 'em from\nme; an' the British gov'ment takin' sides with the black men, as it\nalways does?  Oh, yes!  It sounds easy, that does!\"\n\n\"But if the Greeks get away with 'em,\" argued Will, \"you've no chance\nof recovering at all.\"\n\n\"I'll not take sides with Masai--even against Greeks!\" Brown answered\ngrimly, and Will laughed.\n\n\"If we attack the Greeks first,\" I said, \"perhaps they'll run.  We're\nnearer to them than the Masai are.  The Masai, will have to corral\ntheir own cattle before they can leave them to raid a new lot.  We can\nopen fire at long range to begin with.  If that scares the Greeks away,\nthen we can round up Brown's cattle and drive them back northward.  We\nmay possibly escape with them too quickly for the Masai to think it\nworth while to follow.\"\n\nBrown laughed cynically.\n\n\"We can try it,\" he said. \"An' if the Greeks don't run pretty quick\nthey'll never run again--I'll warrant that!\"\n\nNobody had a better plan to propose, so we emptied our pockets of all\nbut fifty rounds of ammunition each, and gave the rest to Kazimoto to\ncarry, with orders to keep in hiding and watch, and run with cartridges\nto whoever should first need them.\n\nThen, because instead of corraling their cattle the Masai were already\ndividing themselves into two parties, one of which drove the cattle\nforward and the other diverged to study the attack, we ducked down\nunder a ridge and ran toward the Greeks.  The sooner we could get the\nfirst stage of the fighting off our hands the better.\n\nIt proved a long way--far longer than I expected, and the going was\nrougher.  Moreover, the Greeks' boys were losing no time about rounding\nup the cattle.  By the time they were ready to make a move we were\nstill more than a mile away, and out of breath.\n\n\"If they go south,\" panted Brown, throwing himself down by a clump of\ngrass to gasp for his third or fourth wind, \"the Masai'll catch 'em\nsure, an' we'll be out o' the running!  Lord send they head 'em back\ntoward British East!\"\n\nHe was in much the worst physical condition because of the whisky, but\nhis wits were working well enough.  The Greeks on the other hand seemed\nundecided and appeared to be arguing.  Then Brown's prayer was\nanswered.  The Greeks' boys decided the matter for them by stampeding\nthe herd northward toward us.  They did not come fast.  They were lame,\nand bone-weary from hard driving, but they knew the way home again and\nmade a bee line.  Within a minute they were spread fan-wise between us\nand the Greeks, making a screen we could not shoot through.\n\n\"Scatter to right and left!\" Brown shouted.  \"Get round the wings!\"\n\nBut what was the use?  He was in the center, and short-winded.  I\nclimbed on an ant-hill.\n\n\"The Greeks are on the run!\" I said.  \"They are headed southward!\nThey've got their boys together, and have abandoned the cattle!\nThey're off with their tent and belongings due south!\"\n\n\"The cowards!\" swore Brown, with such disappointment that Will and I\nlaughed.\n\n\"Laugh all you like!\" he said.  \"I've a long job on my hands!  I'll\nhave revenge on 'em if it takes the rest o' my life!  I'll follow 'em\nto hell-and-gone!\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" I said, still standing on the ant-hill, \"the Masai are\nfollowing the cattle!  They're smoking this way in two single columns\nof about twenty spears in each.  The remainder are driving their own\ncattle about due eastward so as to be out of the way of trouble.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Brown, growing suddenly cheerful again.  \"Then it'll\nbe a rear-guard action.  Let the cattle through, and open fire behind\n'em!  Send that Kazimoto o' yours to warn our boys to round 'em up and\ndrive 'em slow and steady northward!\"\n\nKazimoto ran back and gave the necessary orders.  He lost no time about\nit, but returned panting, and lay down in a hollow behind us with\ncartridges in either fist and a grin on his face that would have done\ncredit to a circus clown.  I never, anywhere, saw any one more pleased\nthan Kazimoto at the prospect of a fight.\n\nWe let the cattle through and lay hidden, waiting for the raiders.\nThey were in full war dress, which is to say as nearly naked as\npossible except for their spears, a leg ornament made from the hair of\nthe colobus monkey, a leather apron hung on just as suited the\nindividual wearer's fancy, a great shield, and an enormous\nostrich-feather head-dress.  They seemed in no hurry, for they probably\nguessed that the cattle would stop to graze again when the first scare\nwas over; yet they came along as smoke comes, swiftly and easily,\nmaking no noise.\n\nSuddenly those in the lead caught sight of our boys getting behind the\ncattle to herd them northward.  They halted to hold\nconsultation--apparently decided that they had only unarmed natives to\ndeal with--and came on again, faster than before.\n\n\"Better open fire now!\" said Brown, when they were still a quarter of a\nmile away.\n\n\"Wait till you can see their eyes!\" Will advised.  \"An unexpected\nvolley at close quarters will do more havoc than hours of long-range\nshooting.\n\n\"This ain't a long range!\" Brown objected.  \"As for unexpected--just\nwatch me startle 'em!  My sight's fixed at four hundred.  Watch!\"\n\nHe fired--we wished he had not.  The leading Masai of the right-hand\ncolumn jerked his head sidewise as the whistling bullet passed, and\nthen there was nothing for it but to follow his lead and blaze away for\nall we were worth.  If Brown had been willing to accept Will's advice\nthere is nothing more likely than that the close-quarter surprise would\nhave won the day for us.  We would have done much more execution with\nthree volleys at ten-yard range.  As it was, we all missed with our\nfinest shots, and the Masai took heart and charged in open order.\n\nThe worst of it was that, although we dropped several of them, now the\nothers had a chance to discover there were only three of us.  Their\nleader shouted.  The right-hand column continued to attack, but changed\nits tactics.  The left-hand party made a circuit at top speed,\noutflanked us, and pursued the cattle.\n\nSupposing my count was right, we had laid out, either wounded or dead,\nseven of the crowd attacking us.  This left perhaps fourteen against\nus, to be dealt with before the others could come back with the cattle\nand take us in the rear.\n\nWill brought another man down; I saw the blood splash on his forehead\nas the bullet drilled the skull cleanly.  Then one man shouted and they\nall lay prone, beginning to crawl toward us with their shields held\nbefore, not as protection against bullets (for as that they were\nutterly worthless) but as cover that made their exact position merest\nguesswork.\n\nI fell back and took position on the ant-hill from which I had first\nseen them, thus making our position triangular and giving myself a\nchance to protect the other two should they feel forced to retire.  The\nextra height also gave me a distinct advantage, for I could see the\nlegs of the Masai over the tops of their shields, and was able to wound\nmore than one of them so severely that they crawled to the rear.\n\nBut the rest came on.  Kazimoto began to be busy supplying cartridges.\nIn that first real pinch we were in he certainly lived up to all\nCourtney had said of him, for without the stimulus of his proper\nmaster's eye he neither flinched nor faltered, but crawled from one to\nthe other, dividing the spare rounds equally.\n\nThe Masai began to attempt to outflank us, but my position on the\nant-hill to the rear made that impossible; they found themselves faced\nby a side of the triangle from whichever side they attacked.  But in\nturning to keep an eye on the flank I became aware of a greater danger.\nThe cattle were coming back.  That meant that the other Masai were\ncoming, too, and that in a few moments we were likely to be\noverwhelmed.  I shouted to Will and Brown, but either they did not hear\nme, or did not have time to answer.\n\nI fired half a dozen shots, and then distinctly heard the crack of a\nrifle from beyond the cattle.  That gave matters the worst turn yet.\nIf one of the raiders had a rifle, then unless I could spot him at once\nand put him out of action our cause was likely lost.  I stood up to\nlook for him and heard a wild cheer, followed by three more shots in\nquick succession.  Then at last I saw Fred Oakes running along a\ndepression in the ground, followed at a considerable distance by the\nadvance-guard of his porters.  He was running, and then kneeling to\nfire--running, and kneeling again.  And he was not wasting ammunition.\nHe was much the best shot of us all, now that Monty was absent.\n\nThe terrified cattle stampeded past us, too wild to be cheeked by any\nnoise.  Seeing them, and sure now of their booty, the party attacking\nus hauled off and took to their heels.  Will and Brown were for\nspeeding them with bullets in the rear, but I yelled again, and this\ntime made myself heard.  Those who had got behind the cattle and were\ndriving them were coming on with spears and shields raised to slay us\nin passing.  The other two joined me, and we stood on the ant-hill\nthree abreast.  They charged us--seven or eight of them.  Three bit the\ndust, but the rest came on, and if it had not been for two swift shots\nfrom Fred's rifle in the very nick of time we should have all been dead\nmen.\n\nAs it was, one seized me by the knees and we went over together,\nrolling down the ant-hill, he slashing at me with his great\nbroad-bladed spear, I ahold of his wrist with one hand, and with the\nother fist belaboring him in the face.  He was stronger than\nI--greasier--sweatier--harder to hold.  He slipped from under me,\nrolled on top, wrenched his wrist free, and in another second grinned\nin my face as, with both knees in my stomach, he raised the spear to\nkill.  I shut my eyes.  I had not another breath left, nor an effort in\nme, I thought I would deny him the pleasure of watching my death agony.\nBut I could not keep my eyes shut.  Opening them to see why he did not\nstrike, I saw Kazimoto with my rifle in both hands swing for his skull\nwith the full weight of the butt and all his strength.  Kazimoto\ngrunted.  The Masai half turned his head at the sound.  The butt hit\nhome--broke off--and my face and breast were deluged with blood and\nbrains.\n\nWhen I had wiped off that mess with Kazimoto's help I saw Fred and Will\nand Brown pursuing the retreating Masai, kneeling to shoot every few\nyards, at every other shot or so bringing down a victim, but being\nrapidly out-distanced.  Cattle are all the Masai care about.  They had\nthe cattle.  They had hold of tails and were making the whole herd\nscamper due east, where they no doubt knew of a trail not in maps.\nThey made no attempt to defend themselves--left their dead lying--and\nran.  I saw two or three wounded ones riding on cows, and no doubt some\nof those who ran holding to the cows' tails were wounded, too.\n\nI was useless now, as far as fighting was concerned, for the butt of my\nrifle was broken clean off at the grip, but I ran on, and heard Brown\nshout:\n\n\"Shoot cattle!  Don't let the brutes get away with them all!\"\n\nHe was shooting cows himself when I came up, but it was Fred who\nstopped him.\n\n\"Never mind that, old man.  We'll follow 'em up!  Our time's our own.\nWe'll get your cattle back, never fear.  Dead ones are no use.\"\n\nBrown stopped shooting and began to blubber.  Whisky had not left him\nmanhood enough to see his whole available resources carried away before\nhis eyes, and he broke down as utterly as any child.  It was neither\nagreeable nor decent to watch, and I turned away.  I was feeling sick\nmyself from the pressure of the Masai's knees in my stomach.  That, and\nthe sun, and the long march, and hunger (for we had not stopped to eat\na meal that day) combined in argument, and I hunted about for a soft\nplace and a little shade.  It happened that Fred Oakes was watching me,\nalthough I did not know it.  He suspected sunstroke.\n\nI saw a clump of rushes that gave shade enough.  I could crush down\nsome, and lie on those.  I hurried, for I was feeling deathly sick now.\nAs I reached the grass my knees began giving under me.  I staggered,\nbut did not quite fall.\n\nThat, and Fred's watchfulness, saved my life; for at the moment that\nmy head and shoulders gave the sudden forward lurch, a wounded Masai\njumped out of the rushes and drove with his spear at my breast.  The\nblade passed down my back and split my jacket.\n\nHe sprang back, and made another lunge at me, but Fred's rifle barked\nat the same second and he fell over sidewise, driving the spear into my\nleg in his death spasm.\n\nThe twenty minutes following that are the worst in memory.  Kazimoto\nbroke the gruesome news that the spear-blade was almost surely\npoisoned--dipped in gangrene.  The Masai are no believers in wounded\nenemies, or mercy on the battlefield.\n\nWe doubted the assertion for a while--I especially, for none but a\nhypochondriac would care to admit without proof that gangrene had been\nforced into his system.  Kazimoto grew indignant, and offered to prove\nthe truth of his claim on some animal.  But there was no living animal\nin sight on which to prove it.  We asked him how long gangrene,\ninjected in that way, took to kill a man.\n\n\"Very few minutes!\" he answered.\n\nThen it occurred that none of us knew what to do.  Kazimoto announced\nthat he knew, and offered to make good at once if given permission.  He\ndemanded permission again and again from each one of us, making me\nespecially repeat my words.  Then he gathered stems of grass a third of\nan inch thick from the bed of the tiny watercourse, and proceeded to\nmake a tiny fire, talking in a hurry as he did it to several of Fred's\nstring of porters, who were now arriving on the scene.\n\nWhile I watched with a sort of tortured interest what he was doing at\nthe fire, five of the largest boys with whom he had been speaking\nrushed me from behind, and before I could struggle, or even swear, had\nme pinned out on my back on the ground.  One sat on my head; one on my\npoor bruised stomach; the others held wrists and ankles in such way\nthat I could not break free, nor even kick much, however hard I tried.\n\nThen Kazimoto came with glowing ends of grass from the fire, blowing on\nthem to keep them cherry-red, and inserted one after another into the\nopen spear-wound.  I could not cry out, because of the man sitting on\nmy face, but I could bite.  And to the everlasting glory of the\nman--Ali bin Yema, his name was--be it written that he neither spoke\nnor moved a muscle, although my front teeth met in his flesh.\n\nI do not know how long the process lasted, or how many times Kazimoto\nreturned to the fire for more of his sizzling sticks, for I fainted;\nand when I came round the agony was still too intense to permit\ninterest in anything but agony.  They had my leg bandaged, how and with\nwhat I neither knew nor cared.  And it was evident that unless they\nchose to leave me in camp where I was they would have to abandon all\nthought of pursuing Masai for the present.  Even Brown saw the force of\nthat, and he was the first to refuse flatly to leave me there.\n\nFor a while they hunted through the grass for more wounded men, but\nfound none.  There must have been several, but they probably feared the\nsort of mercy from us that they habitually gave to their own enemies,\nand crawled away--in all likelihood to die of thirst and hunger, unless\nsome beast of prey should smell them out and make an earlier end.\n\nThen there was consultation.  It was decided a doctor for me was the\nmost urgent need; that Muanza, the largest German station on Victoria\nNyanza, was probably as near as anywhere, and that German East being\nour immediate destination anyway, the best course to take was forward,\nroughly south by west.  So I was slung in a blanket on a tent-pole, and\nwe started, I swearing like a pirate every time a boy stumbled and\njolted me.  (There is something in the nature of a burn that makes bad\nlanguage feel like singing hymns.)\n\nOur troubles were not all over, for we passed through a country where\nbuck were fairly plentiful, and that meant lions.  They did no damage,\nbut they kept us awake; and one night near the first village we came\nto, where our porters all quartered themselves with the villagers for\nsake of the change from their crowded tents, the fires that we made\nwent out, and five lions (we counted their foot-prints afterward) came\nand sniffed around the pegs of the tent in which Fred and I lay, we\nlying still and shamming dead.  To have lifted a rifle in the darkness\nand tried to shoot would have been suicide.\n\nThen there were trees we passed among--baobabs, whose youngest tendrils\nswung to and fro in the evening breeze like snakes head-downward.  And\ntaking advantage of that natural provision, twenty-foot pythons swung\namong them, in coloring and marking aping the habit of the tree.  One\nof them knocked Fred's helmet off as he marched beside me.  They are\neasy to kill.  He shot it, and it dropped like a stone, three hundred\npounds or more, but the sweat ran down Fred's face for half an hour\nafterward.\n\n(Since then I have seen pythons kill their prey a score of times.  I\nnever once saw one kill by crushing.  The end of their nose is as hard\nas iron, and they strike a terrific blow with that, so swift that the\neye can not follow it.  Then, having killed by striking, they crawl\naround their prey and crush it into shape for swallowing.)\n\nBut the worst of the journey was the wayside villages--dirty beyond\nbelief, governed in a crude way by a headman whom the Germans honored\nwith the title of sultani.  These wayside beggars (for they were no\nbetter)--destitute paupers, taxed until their wits failed them in the\neffort to scrape together surplus enough out of which to pay--were\nsupplied with a mockery of a crown apiece, a thing of brass and\nimitation plush that they wore in the presence of strangers.  To add to\nthe irony of that, the law of the land permitted any white man passing\nthrough to beat them, with as many as twenty-five lashes, if they\nfailed to do his bidding.\n\nOn arriving at such a village, the first thing we did was to ask for\nmilk.  If they had any they brought it, not daring to refuse for fear\nlest a German sergeant-major should be sent along to wreak vengeance\nlater.  But it was always too dirty to drink.\n\nThat ceremony over, the headman retired and the village sick were\nbrought for our inspection.  Gruesome sores, running ulcers, wounds and\ncrippled limbs were stripped and exposed to our most reluctant gaze.\nThere was little we could do for them.  Our own supply of medicines and\nbandages was almost too small for our own needs to begin with.  By the\ntime we passed three villages we scarcely had enough lint and liniment\nleft to take care of my wound; but even that scant supply we cut in\nhalf for a particularly bad case.\n\n\"Don't the Germans do anything for you?\" we demanded, over and over\nagain.\n\nThe answer was always the same.\n\n\"Germani mbaia!\" (The Germans are bad!)\n\nThey were lifeless--listless--tamed until neither ambition nor courage\nwas left.  When their cattle had brought forth young and it looked as\nif there might be some profit at last, the Masai came and raided them,\ntaking away all but the very old ones and the youngest calves.  The\nGermans, they said, taxed them and took their weapons away, but gave\nthem no protection.\n\nAt one place we passed a rifle, lying all rusted by the track.  At the\nnext village we asked about it.  They told us that a German native\nsoldier had deserted six months before and had thrown his rifle away.\nSince that day no one had dared touch it, and they begged us to send\nback and lay it where we found it, lest the Germans come and punish\nthem for touching it.  So we did that, to oblige them, and they were\ngrateful to the extent of offering us one of their only two male sheep.\n\nI forget now for how many days we traveled across that sad and\nsaddening land, Fred always cheerful in spite of everything, Will more\nangry at each village with its dirt and sores, Brown moaning always\nabout his lovely herd of cows, and I groaning oftener than not.\n\nMy leg grew no better, what with jolting and our ignorance of how to\ntreat it.  Sometimes, in efforts to obtain relief, I borrowed a cow at\none village and rode it to the next; but a cow is a poor mount and\ntakes as a rule unkindly to the business.  Now and then I tried to walk\nfor a while, on crutches that Fred made for me; but most of the time I\nwas carried in a blanket that grew hotter and more comfortless as day\ndragged after day.\n\nAt last, however, we topped a low rise and saw Muanza lying on the\nlake-shore, with the great island of Ukereweto to northward in the\ndistance.  From where we first glimpsed it it was a tidy, tree-shaded,\npleasant-looking place, with a square fort, and a big house for the\ncommandant on a rise overlooking the town.\n\n\"Now we'll wire Monty at last!\" said Fred.\n\n\"Now we'll shave and wash and write letters!\" said Will.\n\n\"Now at last for a doctor!\" said I.\n\nBut Brown said nothing, and Kazimoto wore a look of anxious discontent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTHE DARKNESS COMPREHENDED IT NOT\n\n        When Kenia's peak glows gold and rose\n                A dawn breeze whispers to the plain\n        With breath cooled sweet by mountain snows--\n                \"The darkness soon shall come again!\"\n        Stirs then the sleepless, lean Masai\n                And stands o'er plain and peak at gaze\n        Resentful of the bright'ning sky,\n                Impatient of the white man's days.\n\n  Oh dark nights, when the charcoal glowed and falling hammers rang!\n  When fundis* forged the spear-blades, and the warriors danced and sang!\n  When the marriageable spearmen gathered, calling each to each\n  Telling over proverbs that the tribal wisemen teach,\n  Brother promising blood-brother partnership in weal and woe--\n  Nightlong stories of the runners come from spying on the foe--\n  Nights of boasting by the thorn-fire of the coming tale of slain--\n  Oh the times before the English!

There was neatness--of a kind.  The\nround huts were confined to certain streets, and all inhabited by\nnatives.  Arabs, Swahili, Indians, Goanese, Syrians, Greeks and so on\nhad to live in rectangular huts and keep to other streets.  On one\nstreet, chiefly of stores, all the roofs were of corrugated iron.  And\nall the streets were straight, with shade trees planted down both sides\nat exactly equal intervals.\n\nBut the German blight was there, instantly recognizable by any one not\nmentally perverted by German teaching.  The place was governed--existed\nfor and by leave of government.  The inhabitants were there on\nsuffrance, and aware of it--not in the very least degree enthusiastic\nover German rule, but awfully appreciative.\n\nThe first thing we met of interest on entering the township was a\nchain-gang, fifty long, marching at top speed in step, led by a Nubian\nsoldier with a loaded rifle, flanked by two others, and pursued by a\nfourth armed only with the hippo-hide whip, called kiboko by the\nnatives, that can cut and bruise at one stroke.  He plied it liberally\nwhenever the gang betrayed symptoms of intending to slow down.\n\nThose Nubiains, we learned later, were deserters from British Sudanese\nregiments, and runaways from British jails, afraid to take the\nthousand-mile journey northward home again, scornful of all foreign\nblack men, fanatic Muhammedans, and therefore fine tools in the German\nhand.  They worked harder than the chain-gang, for they had to march\nwith it step for step and into the bargain force it to do its appointed\nlabor.  The chain-gang kept the township clean--very clean indeed, as\nfar as outward appearance went.\n\nThe boma, or fort, was down by the water-front and its high eastern\nwall, pierced by only one gate, formed one boundary of the drill-ground\nthat was also township square.  Facing the wall on the eastern side of\nthe square was a row of Indian and Arab stores.  At the north end was\nthe market building--an enormous structure of round stucco pillars\nsupporting a great grass roof; and facing that at the southern end\nwere the court-house, the hospital, and a store owned by the Deutch\nOest Africa Gesellschaft, known far and wide by its initials--a concern\nthat owned the practical monopoly of wholesale import and export trade,\nand did a retail business, too.\n\nWe went first to the hospital.  Fred and Will lifted me out of the\nhammock, for my wound had grown much worse during the last few days,\nand the door being shut they set me down on the step.  Then we sent\nKazimoto into the fort with a note to the senior officer informing him\nthat a European waited at the hospital in need of prompt medical\ntreatment.\n\nThe sentry admitted Kazimoto readily enough, but he did not come out\nagain for half-an-hour, and then looked glum.\n\n\"Habanah!\" he said simply, using the all-embracing native negative.\n\n\"Isn't any one in there?\" we demanded all together.\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Very many.\"\n\n\"Officers?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Is a doctor there?\"\n\nHe told us he had asked for the doctor.  A soldier had pointed him out.\nHe had placed the note in the doctor's hand.\n\n\"Did he read it?\" we asked.\n\n\"Surely.  He read it, and then showed it to the other officers.\"\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"They laughed and said nothing.\"\n\nIt seemed pretty obvious that Kazimoto had made a mistake in some way.\nPerhaps he had visited the non-commissioned officers' mess.\n\n\"I'll go myself,\" announced Will.  \"I can sling the German language like\na barkeep.  Bet you I'm back here with a doctor inside of three\nminutes!\"\n\nHe strode off like Sir Galahad in football shorts, and was passed\nthrough the gate by the sentry almost unchallenged.  But he was gone\nmore than fifteen minutes, and came back at last with his ears crimson.\nNor would he answer our questions.\n\n\"Shall I go?\" suggested Fred.\n\n\"Not unless you like insolence!  We passed the camping-ground, it\nseems, on our way in.  We've leave to pitch tents there.  We'd better\nbe moving.\"\n\nSo we trailed back the way we had come to a triangular sandy space\nenclosed by a cactus hedge at the junction of three roads.  There were\nseveral small grass-roofed shelters with open sides in there, and two\ntents already pitched, but we were not sufficiently interested just\nthen to see who owned the other tents.  We pitched our own--stowed the\nloads in one of the shelters--gave our porters money for board and\nrations--and sent them to find quarters in the town.  Another of the\nshelters we took over for a kitchen, and while our servants were\ncooking a meal we four gathered in Fred's tent and began to question\nWill again.\n\n\"They've got a fine place in there,\" he said.  \"Neat as a new pin.\nOfficers' mess.  Non-commissioned officers' quarters.  Stores.\nVegetable garden.  Jail--looks like a fine jail--hold a couple of\nhundred.  Government offices.  Two-story buildings.  Everything fine.\nThe officers were all sitting smoking on a veranda.\n\n\"'Is one of you the doctor?' I asked in German, and a tall lean one\nwith a mighty mean face turned his head to squint at me:  but he didn't\ntake his feet off the rail.  He looked inquisitive, that's all.\n\n\"'Are you the doctor?' I asked him.\n\n\"'I am staff surgeon,' he answered.  'What do you want?'\n\n\"I told him about your wound, and how we'd marched about two hundred\nmiles on purpose to get medical assistance.  He listened without asking\na question, and when I'd done he said curtly that the hospital opens\nfor out-patients at eight in the morning.\n\n\"Well, I piled it on then.  I told him your leg was so rotten that you\nmight not be alive to-morrow morning.  He didn't even look interested.\nI piled it on thicker and told him about the poisoned spear.  He didn't\nbat an eyelid or make a move.  So I started in to coax him.\n\n\"I did some coaxing.  Believe me, I swallowed more pride in five\nminutes than I guessed I owned!  A ward-heeler cadging votes for a\nMilwaukee alderman never wheedled more gingerly.  I called him 'Herr\nStaff Surgeon' and mentioned the well-known skill of German medicos,\nand the keen sense of duty of the German army, and a whole lot of other\nstuff.\n\n\"'Tomorrow morning at eight!' was all the answer I got from him.\n\n\"I reckon it was somewhere about that time I began to get rattled.  I\npulled out money and showed it.  He looked the other way, and when I\nwent on talking he turned his back.  I suspect he didn't dare keep on\nlookin' at money almost within reach.  Anyhow, then I opened on him,\nfirin' both bow guns.  I dared him to sit there, with a patient in need\nof prompt attention less than two hundred yards away.  I called him\nnames.  I guaranteed to write to the German government and the United\nStates papers about him.  I told him I'd have his job if it cost me all\nmy money and a lifetime's trouble.  He was just about ready to\nshoot--I'd just about got the red blood rising on his neck and\nears--when along came the commandant--der Herr Capitain--the officer\ncommanding Muanza--a swag-bellied ruffian with a beard and a beery look\nin his eye, but a voice like a man falling down three stories with all\nthe fire-irons.\n\n\"'What do you want?' he demanded in English, and I thanked him first\nfor not having mistaken me for one of his own countrymen.  Then I told\nhim what I'd come for.\n\n\"'To-morrow at eight o'clock!' he snapped, after he'd had a word with\nthe medico.  'Meanwhile, make yourself scarce out of here!  There is a\ncamping-ground for the use of foreigners.  You and your party go to it!\nIf you do any damage there you will hear from me later!'\n\n\"I didn't come as easy as all that.  I stood there telling him things\nabout Germany and Germans, and what I'd do to help his personal\nreputation with the home folks, until I guessed he had his craw as near\nfull as he could stand it without having me arrested.  Then I did\ncome--whistling Yankee-doodle.  And say--Fred!  Where's that concertina\nof yours?\"\n\nFred patted it.  His beloved instrument was never far from hand.\n\n\"Why don't you play all the American and English tunes you know\nto-night?  Play and sing 'em, Britannia Rule the Waves--Marching\nThrough Georgia--My Country 'tis of Thee--The Marseillaise--The Battle\nHymn of the Republic--and anything and everything you know that\nSquareheads won't like.  Let's make this camp a reg'lar--hello--see\nwho's here!\"\n\nFred had begun fingering the keys already and the first strains of\nMarching Through Georgia began to awake the neighborhood to recognition\nof the fact that foreigners were present who held no especial brief for\nGerman rule.  The tent-door darkened.  Brown leapt to his feet and\nswore.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" said a voice we all recognized instantly.  \"That tune\nsounds good!  I've lived in the States!  I'm a United States citizen!\nA man can't forget his own country's tunes so easily!\"\n\nCool and impudent, Georges Coutlass entered and, without waiting for an\ninvitation, took a seat on a load of canned food.  Brown grabbed the\nnearest rifle (it happened to be Fred's)--snapped open the\nbreach--discovered it was loaded--and took aim.  Coutlass did not even\nblink.  He was either sure Fred and Will would interfere, or else at\nthe end of his tether and indifferent to death.\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Brown!\"\n\nFred knocked the rifle up.  Will took it away and returned it to the\ncorner.\n\n\"All very easy for you men to take high moral ground and all that sort\nof rot,\" Brown grumbled.  \"It's my cattle he took!  It's me be's\nruined!  What do I care if the Germans hang me?  Let me have a crack at\nhim--just one!\"\n\n\"Use your fists all you care to!\" grinned Will.\n\nBut Brown was no match for the Greek without weapons--very likely no\nmatch for him with them.  Coutlass sat still and grinned, while Brown\nremained in the back of the tent, glaring.\n\n\"Bah!\" sneered Coutlass.  \"Of what use is being sulky?  I found cattle\nin a village.  How should I know whose cattle they were?  Why blame me?\nThe Masai got the cattle, not I!  They took them from me, and they'd\nhave taken them from you just the same!  You lost nothing by my lifting\nthem first!  Gassharamminy!  By blazes!  We're all in the same boat!\nLet's be friendly, and treat one another like gentlemen!  We're all in\nthe power of the Germans, unless we can think of a way to escape!  I\nand my party are under arrest.  So will you be by to-morrow!  I shall\ntell a tale to-morrow that will keep you by the heels for a month at\nleast while they investigate!  Wait and see!\"\n\n\"Get out of this tent!\" growled Fred in the dead-level voice he uses\nwhen he means to brook no refusal.\n\n\"Presently!\"\n\nFred made a spring at him, but Coutlass was on his feet with the speed\nof a cat, and just outside the tent in time to avoid the swing of\nFred's fist.  He withdrew about two yards and stood there grinning\nmaliciously.\n\n\"You'll be glad to make terms with me by this time to-morrow!\" he\nboasted.  \"By James, you'll be glad to have me for a friend!  Listen,\nyou fools!  Make terms with me now; let us all go together and unearth\nthat Tippoo Tib ivory, and I can arrange with these Germans to let us\ngo away!  Otherwise, you shall see how long you stop here!  By the\nTwelve Apostles! You shall rot in a German jail until your joints\ncreak!\"\n\nHis Greek friend and the Goanese, supposing him in trouble perhaps,\ncame and stood in line with him.  Very comfortless they looked, and of\nthe three only Coutlass had courage of a kind.\n\n\"They stole the cattle on the British side of the border,\" Will said\nsotto voice.  \"No earthly use threatening them with German law.\"\n\n\"Keep away from our camp,\" Fred Ordered them, \"or take the\nconsequences!  Mr. Brown here is in no mood for pleasantries!\"\n\n\"That drunkard Brown?\" roared Coutlass.  \"He is in no mood for--oh,\nhaw-hah-hee-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Drunkard Brown of Lumbwa wants to avenge\nhimself, and his friends won't let him!  Oh, isn't that a joke!  Oh,\nha-ha-ha-hee-hee-ha-ho-ho!\"\n\nHis two companions made a trio of it, yelling with stage laughter like\ndisgusting animals.  Fred took a short quick step forward.  Will\nfollowed, and Brown reached for the rifle again.  But I stopped all\nthree of them.\n\n\"Come back!  Don't let's be fools!\" I insisted.  \"I never saw a more\nobvious effort to start trouble in my life!  It's a trap!  Keep out of\nit!\"\n\n\"Sure enough,\" Will admitted. \"You're right!\"\n\nHe returned into the tent and the Greeks, perhaps supposing he went for\nweapons, retreated, continuing to shout abuse at Brown who, between a\nyearning to get drunk and sorrow for his stolen cattle, was growing\ntearful.\n\n\"They got here first,\" I argued.  \"They've had time to tell their own\nstory.  That may account for our cold reception by the Germans.  He\nsays they're under arrest.  That may be true, or it may be a trick.\nIt's perfectly obvious Coutlass wanted to start a fight, and I'm dead\nsure he wasn't taking such a chance as it seemed.  Who wants to look\nbehind the cactus hedge and see whether he has friends in ambush?\"\n\n\"Drunkard Brown is on the town--on the town--on the town!\" roared\nCoutlass and his friends from not very far away.\n\n\"Oh, let me go and have a crack at 'em!\" begged Brown.  \"I tell you I\ndon't care about jail!  I don't care if I do get killed!\"\n\nFred kept a restraining hand on him.  Will left the tent and walked\nstraight for the gap in the cactus hedge by which we had entered the\nenclosure.  It was only twenty yards away.\n\nOnce through the gap he glanced swiftly to right and left--laughed--and\ncame back again.\n\n\"Only six of 'em!\" he grinned.  \"Six full-sized Nubians in uniform,\nwith army boots on, no bayonets or rifles, but good big sticks and\nhandcuffs!  If we'd touched those Greeks they'd have jumped the fence\nand stretched us out!  What the devil d'you suppose they want us in\njail for?\"\n\n\"D'you suppose they think,\" I said, \"that if they had us in jail in\nthis God-forsaken place we'd divulge the secret of Tippoo's ivory?\"\n\n\"Why don't we tell 'em the secret!\" suggested Will, and that seemed\nsuch a good idea that we laughed ourselves back into good temper--even\nBrown, who had no notion whether we knew the secret, being perfectly\nsure we would not be such fools as to tell the true whereabouts of the\nhoard in any case.\n\n\"I want to get even with all Africa!\" he grumbled.  \"I want to make\ntrouble that'll last!  I'd start a war this minute if I knew how!  If\nit weren't for those bloody Greeks laughing at me I'd get more drunk\nto-night than any ten men in the world ever were before in history!\nYes, sir!  And my name's Brown of Lumbwa to prove I mean what I say!\"\n\nAfter a while, seeing that no trouble was likely, the Nubian soldiers\ncame out of ambush and marched away.  We ate supper.  The Greeks and\nthe Goanese subsided into temporary quiet, and our own boys, squatting\nby a fire they had placed so that they could watch the Greeks'\nencampment, began humming a native song.  Their song reminded Fred of\nWill's earlier suggestion, and he unclasped the concertina.\n\nThen for three-quarters of an hour he played, and we sang all the tunes\nwe knew least likely to make Germans happy, repeating The Marseillaise\nand Rule Britannia again and again in pious hope that at least a few\nbars might reach to the commandant's house on the hill.\n\nWhether they did or not--whether the commandant writhed as we hoped in\nthe torture of supreme insult, or slept as was likely from the\nafter-effect of too much bottled beer with dinner--there were others\nwho certainly did hear, and made no secret of it.\n\nTo begin with, the part of the township nearest us was the quarter of\nround grass roofs, where the aborigines lived; and the Bantu heart\nresponds to tuneful noise, as readily as powder to the match.  All that\nsection of Muanza, man, woman and child, came and squatted outside the\ncactus hedge.  (It was streng politzeilich verboten for natives to\nenter the European camping-ground, so that except when they wanted to\nsteal they absolutely never trespassed past the hedge.)\n\nEnraptured by the unaccustomed strains they sat quite still until some\nSwahili and Arabs came and beat them to make room.  When the struggle\nand hot argument that followed that had died down, Indians began\ncoming, and other Greeks, until most of the inhabitants of the eastern\nside of town were either squatting or standing or pacing to and fro\noutside the camping-ground.\n\nAt last rumor of what was happening reached the D.O.A.G.--the store at\nthe corner of the drill-ground, where it seemed the non-commissioned\nofficers took their pleasure of an evening.  Pleasure, except as laid\ndown in regulations, is not permitted in German colonies to any except\nwhite folk.  No less than eight German sergeants and a sergeant-major,\nall the worse for liquor, turned out as if to a fire and came down\nstreet at a double.\n\nThey had kibokos in their hands.  The first we heard of their approach\nwas the crack-crack-crack of the black whips falling on naked or\nthin-cotton-clad backs and shoulders.  There was no yelling (it was not\nallowed after dark on German soil, at least by natives) but a sudden\npattering in the dust as a thousand feet hurried away.  Then, in the\nglow of our lamplight, came the sergeant-major standing spraddle-legged\nin front of us.\n\nHe was a man of medium height, in clean white uniform.  The first thing\nI noticed about him was the high cheek-bones and murderous blue eyes,\nlike a pig's.  His general build was heavy.  The fair mustache made no\nattempt to conceal fat lips that curled cruelly.  His general air was\nthat most offensive one to decent folk, of the bully who would\ningratiate by seeming a good fellow.\n\n\"'nabnd, meine Herren!\" he said aggressively, with a smile more than\nhalf made up of contempt for courtesy.  \"Ich heiess Schubert-Feldwebel\nHans Schubert.\"\n\n\"Wass wollen Sie?\" Will asked.  He was the only one of us who knew\nGerman well.\n\nBut Schubert, it seemed, knew English and was glad to show it off.\n\n\"You make fine music!  Ach!  Up at the D.O.A.G. very near here we\nUnteroffitzieren spend the evening, all very fond of singing, yet\nwithout music at all.  Will you not come and play with us?\"\n\n\"I only know French and English tunes!\" lied Fred.\n\n\"Ach!  I do not believe it!  Kommen Sie!  There is beer at the\nD.O.A.G.--champagne--brandy--whisky--rum--?\"\n\n\"I'm going, then, for one!\" announced Brown, getting up immediately.\n\n\"Cigars--cigarettes--tobacco,\" the sergeant-major continued.  \"There is\nno closing time.\"  He saw that the line of argument was not tempting,\nand changed his tactics. \"Listen!  You gentlemen have not too many\nfriends in Muanza!  I speak in friendship.  I invite you on behalf of\nmyself and other Unteroffitzieren to spend gemuthlich evening with us.\nThat can do you no harm!  In the course of friendly conversation much\ncan be learned that official lips would not tell!\n\n\"Kommen Sie nun!\"\n\n\"Let's go!\" I said. \"My leg hurts like hell.  If I stay here I can't\nsleep.  Anything to keep from thinking about it!  Besides, some one\nmust go and look after Brown!\"\n\n\"Who'll watch those Greeks?\" Fred demanded.  \"They'd as soon steal as\neat!\"\n\n\"We'd better all stay here together,\" said Will, \"and take turns\nkeeping watch till morning.\"  He said it with a straight face, but I\ndid not think he was in earnest.\n\n\"Ach!\" exclaimed Schubert.  \"That is all ganz einfach!  You shall have\naskaris!\"\n\nHe turned and shouted an order.  A non-commissioned officer went\nrunning back up-street.\n\n\"You shall have three askaris to guard your camp.  So nothing whatever\nshall be stolen!  Then come along and make music--seien Sie gemuthlich!\nYah?\"\n\nBrown had already gone, jingling money in his pocket.  We waited until\nthe Nubian soldiers came--saw them posted--and then walked up-street\nbehind the sergeants, Schubert leading us all, and I limping between\nFred and Will.  They as good as carried me the last half of the way.\n\nThe sergeants marched with the air peculiar to military Germans, of men\nwho are going to be amused.  They said nothing--did not smile--but\nstrode straight forward, three abreast, swinging their kibokos with a\nsort of elephantine sporty air.  They were men of all heights and\nthicknesses, but each alike impressed me with the Prussian military\nmold that leaves a man no imagination of his own, and no virtue, but\nonly an animal respect for whatever can make to suffer, or appease an\nappetite.\n\nThe D.O.A.G. proved a mournful enough lounging place in which to spend\nconvivial evenings.  However, it seemed that when the sergeant-major\nhad decreed amusement the non-commissioned officers' mess overlooked\nall trifles in brave determination to obey.  They marched in, humming\ntunes (each a different one, and nearly all high tenor) and took seats\nin a room at the rear of the building with their backs against a\nmud-brick wall that was shiny from much rubbing by drill tunics.\n\nDown the center was a narrow table, loaded with drinks of all sorts.  A\ncase of bottled beer occupied the place of pride at one end; as\nSchubert had boasted, nothing was lacking that East Africa could show\nin the way of imported alcohol.  Under the table was an unopened case\nof sweet German champagne, and on a little table against one wall were\nsuch things as absinth, chartreuse, peppermint, and benedictine.\nSoda-water was slung outside the window in a basket full of wet grass\nwhere the evening breeze would keep it cool.\n\n\"Now for Gesang!\" shouted Schubert, knocking the neck off a bottle of\nbeer, and beginning to sing like a drunken pirate.\n\nA man whom he introduced as \"a genuine Jew from Jerusalem\" came out\nfrom a gloomy recess filled with tusks and sacks of dried red pepper,\nand watched everything from now on with an eye like a gimlet, writing\ndown in a book against each sergeant's name whatever he took to drink.\nThey appeared to have no check on him.  Nobody signed anything.  Nobody\nas much as glanced at his account.\n\n\"What is the use?\" said Schubert, noticing my glance and interpreting\nthe unspoken question.  \"There is just so much drink in the whole\nplace.  We shall drink every drop of it!  All that matters is, who is\nto pay for the champagne?  That stuff is costly.\"\n\nThey all took beer to begin with, knocking the necks from the bottles\nas if that act alone lent the necessary air of deviltry to the whole\nproceedings.  A small, very black Nyamwesi came with brush and pan and\ngroped on the floor all night for the splinters of glass, sleeping\nbetween times in a corner until a fresh volley of breaking bottle necks\nawoke him to work again.\n\n\"Die Wacht am Rhein!\" yelled Schubert.  \"Start it up!  Sing that\nfirst!\"  He began to sing it himself, all out of tune.\n\nFred cut the noise short by standing up to play something nobody could\nsing to a jangling clamor of chords and runs on which he prides\nhimself, that he swears is classical, but of which neither he nor\nanybody knows the name.  Then he drank some beer and sang a comic song\nor two in English, we joining in the choruses.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown was soaking away steadily, taking whatever drink came\nfirst to hand, and having no interest whatever in anything but the task\nof assuaging the thirst he had accumulated in the course of all that\nlong marching since he left home.  He had forgotten his cattle\nalready--the Greeks who stole them--the Masai who stole from the\nGreeks.  He paid for all he took, to the Jew's extreme surprise and\nsatisfaction, and grumbled at the price of everything, to the Jew's\nsupremest unconcern.\n\n\"An' my name's Brown o' Lumbwa, just in proof of all I say!\" he\ninformed the room at large at intervals.\n\nWhen Will had exhausted all the American songs he knew, and Fred had\nrun through his own long list there was nothing left for it but to make\nup accompaniments to the songs the sergeants had been raised on.  Fred\nmade the happy discovery that none of them knew The Marseillaise, so he\nplayed that as an antidote each time after they had made the hard-wood\nrafters ring and the smoke-filled air vibrate with Teutonic jingoism.\nThe Jew, who probably knew more than he cared to admit, grew more and\nmore beady-eyed each time The Marseillaise was played.\n\nThere was a pause in the proceedings at about ten o'clock, by which\ntime all the sergeants except Schubert were sufficiently drunk to feel\nthoroughly at ease.  Schubert was cold-eyed sober, although scarcely\nany longer thirsty.\n\nA native was brought in by two askaris and charged before Schubert with\nhanging about the boma gate after dark.  He was asked the reason.  The\nJew, sitting beside me with his book of names and charges, poured cool\nwater over my bandages and translated to me what they all said.  He\nspoke English very well indeed, but in such low tones that I could\nscarcely catch the words, drawing in his breath and not moving his lips\nat all.\n\nThe native explained that he had waited to see the bwana makubwa--the\ncommandant.  He had nowhere to go and no money with which to pay for\nlodging, so he proposed to wait outside the gate and watch for the\ncoming of the commandant next morning.  He would intercept him on his\nway down from the white house on the hill.\n\nHe was asked why.  To beg a favor.  What favor?  Satisfaction.  For\nwhat?  For his daughter.  He was the father of the girl whom the\ncommandant had favored with attentions.  She had been a virgin.  Now\nshe was to have a child.  It would be a half-black, half-white child.\nWho would now marry a woman with such a child as that?  Yet nothing bad\nbeen given her.  She had been simply sent back home to be a charge on\nher parents and an already poverty-stricken village.  Therefore he had\ncome to ask that justice be done, and the girl be given at least a\npresent of money.\n\nThe sergeants roared with laughter, all except Schubert, who seemed\nonly appalled by the impudence of the request.  He sat back and ordered\nthe story repeated.\n\n\"And you dare ask for money from the bwana makubwa!\" he demanded.\n\"You dog of a Nyamwesi!  Is the honor not sufficient that your black\nbrute of a daughter should have a baby by such a great person?  You\ncattle have no sense of honor!  You must learn!  Put him down!  Beat\nhim till I say stop!\"\n\nThere was no need to put him down, however.  The motion of the hand,\nvoice inflection, order were all too well understood.  The man lay\nface-downward on the floor without so much as a murmur of objection,\nand buried his face in both hands.  The askaris promptly stripped him\nof the thin cotton loin-cloth that constituted his only garment,\ntearing it in pieces as they dragged it from him.\n\n\"Go on!\" ordered Schubert.  \"Beat him!\"\n\nBoth the askaris had kibokos.  The longest of the two was split at the\nnether end into four fingers.  The shortest was more than a yard long,\ntapering from an inch and a half where the man's fist gripped it to\nhalf an inch thick at the tip.  They stood one each side of their\nvictim and brought the whips down on his naked skin alternately.\n\n\"Slowly!\" ordered Schubert.  \"Slowly, and with all your strength!  The\nbrute doesn't feel it when you beat so fast!  Let him wait for the\nblow!  Don't let him know when it's coming!  So--so is better!\"\n\nNot every blow drew blood, for a native's skin is thick and tough,\nespecially where he sits.  But the blows that fell on the back and\nthighs all cut the skin, and within two minutes the native's back was a\nbloody mass, and there was blood running on the floor, and splashes of\nblood on the whitewashed wall cast by the whips as they ascended.\n\nI made up my mind the man was going to be killed, for Schubert gave no\norder and the askaris did not dare stop without one.  The victim\nwrithed, but did not cry out, and the writhing grew less.  Even Brown\nsobered up for a time at the sight of it.  He came and sat between me\nand the Jew.\n\n\"It's a shame!\" he grumbled.  \"Up in our country twenty-five lashes is\nthe masshimum, an' only to be laid on in the presence of a\nmassishtrate.  You beat a black man an' they'll fine you first offense,\njail you second offense, an' third offense God knows what they'll do!\nPoor ole Brown o' Lumbwa!  They fined me once a'ready.  Nessht time\nthey'll put me in jail!  Better get quite drunk an' be blowed to it!\"\n\nHe staggered back to his chair by the farther wall, leering at Schubert\nas he passed.\n\n\"You're no gentleman!\" he asserted aggressively.  \"You're no better 'n\na black man yourself!  You ought-to-be-on-floor 'stead o' him!\nDunno-how-behave-yourself!  Take your coat off, an' come outside, an'\nfight like a man!\"\n\nSchubert gave the order to stop at last.  The askaris stood aside,\npanting from the effort.\n\n\"Get up!\" ordered Schubert.\n\nThe miserable Nyamwesi struggled to his feet and stood limply before\nSchubert, his back running blood and his face drawn with torture.\n\n\"Don't you know how to behave!\" demanded Schubert.\n\nThe native made no answer.\n\n\"If you don't salute properly I'll order you thrown down and thrashed\nagain!\"\n\nThe native saluted in a sort of imitation of the German military manner.\n\n\"Now, will you lie in wait for the bwana makubwa to trouble him with\nyour pig's affairs again?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Will you go back home?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You've learned a lesson, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Then say thank you!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\"\n\n\"Rrruksa!\"*  [*Ruksa, you have leave to go.]\n\nThe poor wretch turned and went, staggering rather than walking, to the\ndoor and disappearing into outer darkness without a backward glance.\n\n\"Now for some more songs and a round of drinks!\" Schubert shouted.\n\nBut Fred was no longer in mood to make music, or even to be civil.  He\nshut the concertina up, and asked the Jew how much he owed.  The\nsergeants went on singing without music, and while we waited for the\nJew to reckon up Fred's score Schubert came over to us, sat down\nbetween me and Fred, and proceeded to deal with the new situation in\nproper German military manner, by direct assault.\n\n\"Always you English criticize!\" he began.  \"Can you never travel\nwithout applying your cursed standards to everything you behold?  I\ntell you, we Germans know how to rule these black people!  We\nunderstand!  We employ no sickly sentiment!  We give orders--they obey,\nor else suffer terribly and swiftly!  In that manner we arrive at\nknowing where we are!\"\n\n\"Are you well loved by the people?\" Fred asked him politely.\n\n\"Bah!  Sie wollen wohl beliebt werden!*  Not I!  Not we!  Of what value\nis the love of such people?  Their fear is what we cultivate!  Having\nmade them afraid of us, we successfully make them work our will!  But\nwhy should I trouble to explain?  In a few years there will only be one\ngovernment of Africa!  One, I tell you, and that German!  You English\nare not fit to govern colonies!  You are mawkishly sentimental!  You\nthink more of the feelings of a black man and of the rights of his\nwomen than of progress--advancement--kultur!  Bah!  I tell you they\nhave no feelings a real man need consider!  They are only fit for\nfurthering the aims of us Germans!  And their women have no rights!\nNone whatever!  You know, I suppose, that it is the policy of the\nGerman government to encourage the spread of Muhammedanism in Africa?\nWell, under the Muhammedan law as given in the Koran women have no\nsouls!  That is good!  That is as it should be!  No women have souls!\"\n\n------------\n*You want to be popular, don't you!\n------------\n\n\"How about your own mother?\" Fred suggested.\n\n\"She was a good Prussian!  She was a super-woman!  Not to be mentioned\nin the same breath with women of any other race!  Yet even she--the\ngood Prussian mother--could not hold a candle to a man!  Her business\nwas to raise sons for Prussia, and she did it!  I have eight brothers,\nall in the army, and only one sister; she has four sons already!\"\n\n\"Strange that your nation should breed like that!\" said Fred.\n\n\"Not strange at all!\" answered Schubert.  \"We are needed to conquer the\nworld!  Think, for instance, when we have conquered the Congo Free\nState, and taken away East and South Africa from England--to say\nnothing of Egypt and India!--how many Prussian sergeant-majors we shall\nwant! Donnerwetter!  Do you think we Germans will long be satisfied\nwith this miserable section of East Africa that was all the English\nleft to us on this coast?  We use this for a foothold, that is all!  We\nuse this to gain time and get ready!  You think perhaps I do not know,\neh?  I am only feldwebel--non-commissioned officer, you call it.  Well\nand good.  I tell you our officers talk all the time of nothing else!\nAnd they don't care who hears them!\"\n\nThe Jew gave Fred his bill, scrawled on a piece of wrapping paper.\nSchubert snatched it away and crumpled it into a ball.\n\n\"Kreutzblitzen!  You are my guests to-night!  I invited you!\"\n\n\"Thanks\" Fred answered, \"but we don't care to be your guests.  Here,\"\nhe said, turning to the Jew, \"take your money!\"\n\nSchubert said nothing, but eyed the Jew with a perfectly blank face, as\nif he watched to see whether the man would damn himself or not.\n\n\"Take your money!\" repeated Fred.  But the Jew turned his back and\nbusied himself with bottles at the side-table.\n\n\"He knows better!\" Schubert laughed.  \"He understands by this time our\nGerman hospitality!\"\n\n\"All right,\" answered Fred.  \"We'll go out without paying!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" retorted Schubert.  \"The mess shall pay bill in full!\nYou stay here until I have said what I have to say to you!  The rest of\nyour party may go, but you stay!  You can explain to the others\nafterward.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, reached a bottle of beer off the table, knocked off\nthe neck, and emptied the contents down his throat at a draught.\nBehind his back we exchanged glances.\n\n\"I'll listen,\" said Fred.\n\n\"You alone?\"\n\n\"No, we all stay.  All or none!\"\n\nSchubert made a contemptuous gesture with his thumb toward Brown, who\nhad fallen dead drunk on the floor.\n\n\"Will that one stay, too?\"\n\n\"He is not of our party really,\" Fred answered.  \"He knows nothing of\nour affairs.\"\n\n\"You men are in trouble--worse trouble than you guess!\"\n\nSchubert looked with his cruel blue eyes into each of ours in turn,\nthen stared straight in front of him and waited.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Fred answered.  \"We have done nothing to merit\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Merit in this world is another name for chance!\" said Schubert.\n\n\"What are we supposed to have done?\" demanded Fred.\n\nSchubert at once assumed what was intended to be a sly look, of\nuncommunicable knowledge.\n\n\"None of my business to tell what my officers know,\" he answered.  \"As\nfor that, time will no doubt disclose much.  The point is--trouble can\nbe forestalled.\"\n\n\"Aw--show your hand!\" cut in Will, leaning in front of Fred.  \"I've\nseen you Heinies fishing for graft too often in the States not to\nrecognize symptoms!  Spill the bait can!  There's no other way to tell\nif we'll bite!  Tell us what you're driving at!\"\n\n\"Ivory!\" said Schubert savagely and simply, shutting his jaws after the\nword like a snap with a steel spring.  It would have broken the teeth\nof an ordinary human.\n\n\"What ivory?\"\n\nWe all did our best to look blank.\n\n\"You know!  Tippoo Tib's ivory!  It belongs to the German government!\nEmin Pasha, whom that adventurer Stanley rescued against his will,\nagreed to sell the secret to us, but we never agreed on a price and he\ndied without telling.  Gott!  He would have told had I had the\ninterviewing of him!  It was known in Zanzibar that you and a certain\nEnglish lord shared the secret.  You have been watched. You are known\nto be in search of the stuff.\"\n\n\"The deuce you say!\" Fred murmured, with a glance to left and right at\nus.\n\n\"If you were to go to the office to-morrow, and tell our commandant\nwhat you know,\" said Schubert, \"you might be suitably compensated.  You\nwould certainly be given facilities for leaving the country in comfort\nat your leisure.\"\n\n\"Who told you to promise us that?\" Fred demanded, turning on him.\n\nThe feldwebel did not answer, but sat with his legs straight out in\nfront of him, his heels together, and the palms of his hands touching\nbetween his knees.  The sergeants were all singing, smoking and\ndrinking.  The Jew was back at his old post, watching every one with\ngimlet eyes.\n\n\"Think it over!\" said Schubert, getting up.  \"There is time until\nmorning.  There is time until you leave this building.  After that--\"\nHe shrugged his square shoulders brutally.\n\nThere was no sense in going out at once, as we had intended, with that\ncombination of threat and promise hanging over us.\n\n\"Why not do what we said--admit that we know what we don't know--and\nput 'em on the wrong scent?\" Will whispered.\n\n\"I wish to God Monty were here!\" groaned Fred.\n\n\"Rot!\" Will answered.  \"Monty is all you ever said of him and then\nsome; but we're able to handle this ourselves all right without him.\nTell 'em a bull yarn, I say!\"\n\nFred relapsed into a sort of black gloom intended to attract the Muse\nof Strategy.  He was always better at swift action in the open and\noptimism in the face of visible danger, than at matching wits against\nsomething he could not see beginning or end of.\n\n\"Tell 'em it's in German East!\" urged Will.  \"Offer to lead them to it\non certain conditions.  Think up controversial proposals!  Play for\ntime!\"\n\nFred shook his head.\n\n\"What if it turns out true?  Monty's in Europe.  Suppose he should\nlearn while he's there that the stuff is really in German East--we'd\nhave spoiled his game!\"\n\n\"If the stuff should really be in German East,\" Will argued, \"we've no\nchance in the world of getting even a broker's share of it, Monty or no\nMonty!  Take my advice and tell 'em what they want to know!\"\n\nMeanwhile an argument of another kind had started across the room.\nSchubert had related with grim amusement to Sergeant Sachse, who was\nsitting next him, our disapproval of the flogging of the father of the\ncommandant's abandoned woman.\n\n\"At what were they shocked?\" wondered Sachse. \"At the flogging, or the\nintercourse, or because he sent the female packing when she proposed to\nhave a child?  Do they not know that to have children about the\npremises would be subversive of military excellence?\"\n\n\"They were shocked at all three things,\" grinned Schubert, \"but\nchiefly, I think, at the flogging.\"\n\n\"Bah!  Such a tickling of a native's hide doesn't hurt him to speak of!\nWait until they see our court in the morning!\"\n\nIt was that that raised the clamor.  Even Schubert, who might be\nsupposed to have won promotion because he could stay sober longer than\nthe others, was beginning to grow noisy in his speech and to laugh\nwithout apparent reason.  The rest were all already frankly drunk, and\nany excuse for dispute was a good one.  They one and all, including\nSchubert, denied Sachse's contention that a flogging did not hurt\nenough to matter.\n\n\"I bet I could take one without winking!\" Sachse announced.\n\nSchubert's little bright pig-eyes gleamed through the smoke at that.\n\n\"Kurtz und gut!\" he laughed.  \"There is a case of champagne unopened.\nI bet you that case of champagne that you lie!  That you can not take a\nflogging!\"\n\nThere was an united yelp of delight.  The sergeants rose and gathered\nround Sachse.  Schubert cursed them and drove them to the chairs again.\n\n\"Open that case of champagne!\" he roared, and the Jew obeyed, setting\nthe bottles on the table in two rows.\n\n\"I bet you those twelve bottles you dare not take a regular flogging,\nand that you can not endure it if you dare try!\"\n\n\"I can stand as much as you!\" hedged Sachse.\n\n\"Good!  We will see!  We will both take a flogging--stroke for stroke!\nWhoever squeals first shall pay for the champagne!\"\n\nSachse could not back out.  His cheeks grew whiter, but he staggered to\nhis feet, swearing.\n\n\"I will show you of what material a German sergeant is made!\" he\nboasted.        \"It is not only Prussians who are men of metal!  How\nshall it be arranged?\"\n\nThe arrangement was easy enough.  Schubert shouted for an askari, and\nthe corporal who was doing police duty outside in the street came\nrunning.  He had a kiboko in his hand almost a yard and a half long,\nand Schubert examined it with approval.\n\n\"How would you like to flog white men?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I would not dare!\" grinned the corporal.\n\n\"Not dare, eh?  Would you not obey an order?\"\n\n\"Always I obey!\" the man answered, saluting.\n\n\"Good.  I shall lie here.  This other bwana shall lie there beside me.\nYou shall stand between.  First you shall strike one, then the\nother--turn and turn about until I give the order to cease!  And\nlisten!  If you fail once--just one little time!--to flog with all your\nmight, you shall have two hundred lashes yourself; and they shall be\ngood ones, because I will lay them on!  Is it understood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the corporal, the whites of his eyes betraying doubt, fear\nand wonder.  But he grinned with his lips, lest the feldwebel should\nsuspect him of unwillingness.\n\n\"Are the terms understood?\" demanded Schubert, and the sergeants yelped\nin the affirmative.\n\n\"Then choose a referee!\"\n\nOne of the sergeants volunteered for the post.  Schubert lay down on\nthe floor, and Sachse beside him about four feet away.  The corporal\ntook his stand between.  He was an enormous Nubian, broad of chest,\nwith the big sloping shoulder muscles that betray double the strength\nthat tailors try to suggest with jackets padded to look square.\n\n\"Nun--recht feste schlagen!\"* ordered Schubert. Then he took the sleeve\nof his tunic between his teeth and hid his face.  [*Now, hit good and\nhard!]\n\n\"One!\" said the referee.  Down came the heavy black whip with a crack\nlike a gun going off.  Schubert neither winced nor murmured, but the\nblood welled into the seat of his pants and spread like red ink on\nblotting-paper.\n\n\"'One!\" said the referee again.  The corporal faced about, and raised\nhis weapon, standing on tiptoe to get more swing.  Sachse flinched at\nthe sound of the whip going up, and the other sergeants roared delight.\nBut he was still when it descended, and the crack of the blow drew\nneither murmur nor movement from him either.  Like the feldwebel, he\nhad his sleeve between his teeth.\n\n\"Two!\" said the referee, and the black whip rose again.  It descended\nwith a crack and a splash on the very spot whence the blood flowed,\nthis time cutting the pants open, but Schubert took no more notice of\nit than if a fly had settled on him.  There was a chorus of applause.\n\n\"Two!\" said the referee.  Again the corporal faced about and balanced\nhimself on tiptoe.  Sachse was much the more nervous of the two.  He\nflinched again while waiting for the blow, but met it when it did come\nwithout a tremor of any kind.  He was much the softer.  Blood flowed\nfrom him more freely, but his pants seemed to be of sterner stuff, for\nthey did not split until the eight-and-twentieth lash, or thereabouts.\n\nFrom first to last, although the raw flesh lay open to the lash, and\nthe corporal, urged to it by the united threats and praise of all the\nother sergeants, wrought his utmost, Schubert lay like a man asleep.\nHe might have been dead, except for the even rise and fall of his\nbreathing, that never checked or quickened once.  Nine-and-forty\nstrokes he took without a sign of yielding.  At the eight-and-fortieth\nSachse moaned a little, and the referee gave the match against him.\nSchubert rose to his feet unaided, grinning, red in the face, but\nwithout any tortured look.\n\n\"Now you can say forever that you have flogged two white men!\" he told\nthe askari.\n\n\"Who will believe me?\" the man answered.\n\nSachse had to be helped to his feet.  He was pale and demanded brandy.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" laughed Schubert.  \"A Prussian is better than\nany man!  Look at him, and then at me!\"\n\nHe shouted for his servant, who had to be fetched from the boma--a\nsmug-faced little rascal, obviously in love with the glory reflected on\nthe sergeant-major's servant.  He was made to produce a basin and cold\nwater--he discovered them somewhere in the dim recesses of the\nstore--and sponge his master's raw posterior before us all.  Then he\nwas sent for clean white pants and presently Schubert, only refusing to\nsit down, was quite himself again.\n\nSachse on the other hand refused the ministrations of the boy--was\nannoyed by the chaff of the other sergeants--refused to drink any of\nthe sweet champagne he would now have to pay for--and went away in\ngreat dudgeon, murmuring about the madness that takes hold of men in\nAfrica.\n\nMeanwhile, while Schubert strutted and swaggered, making jokes more raw\nand beastly than his own flogged hide, the Jew came and poured more\ncool water on my hot bandages, touching them with deft fingers that\nlooked like the hairy legs of a huge spider--his touch more\ngentle--more fugitive than any woman's.\n\n\"You should not tell zat dam feldwebel nozink!\"  he advised in nasal\nEnglish.  \"Nefer mind vat you tell heem he is all ze same not your\nfrien.  He only obey hees officers.  Zey say to cut your troat--he cut\nit!  Zey say to tell you a lot o' lies--he tell!  He iss not a t'inker,\nbut a doer:  and hees faforite spectacle iss ze blood of innocence!  Do\nnot effer say I did not tell you!  On ze ozzer hand, tell no one zat I\ndid tell!  Zese are dangerous people!\"\n\nHe resumed business with his account book, and I whispered to Fred and\nWill what advice he had given.  Seeing us with our heads together,\nSchubert crossed the room, beginning to get very drunk now that the\nshock of the flogging had had time to reinforce the alcohol.  (The\nblows had sobered him at first.)\n\n\"What have you decided?\" he asked, standing before us with his legs\napart and his hands behind him in his favorite attitude--swaying gently\nback and forward because of the drink, and showing all his teeth in a\ngrin.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Fred answered.  \"We'll think it over.\"\n\n\"Too late in the morning!\" he answered, continuing to sway.  \"I can do\nnothing for you in the morning.\"\n\n\"What can you do to-night?\" Fred asked.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \"I can report.  The report will go in at\ndawn.\"\n\n\"You may tell your superiors,\" Fred answered, rising, \"that if they\ncare to make us a reasonable offer, I don't say we won't do business!\"\n\nSchubert leered.\n\n\"To-morrow will be too late!\" he repeated.\n\nIt was Fred's turn to shrug shoulders, and he did it inimitably,\nturning his back on Schubert and helping Will support me to the door.\nThe feldwebel stood grinning while I held to the doorpost and they\ndragged Brown to his feet.  He made no offer to help us in any way at\nall, nor did any of the sergeants.\n\nThere was no getting action from Brown.  He was as dead to the world as\na piece of wood, and there being no other obvious solution of the\nproblem, Will hoisted him upon his back and carried him, he snoring,\nall the way home to camp.  Fred hoisted and carried me, for the pain of\nmy wound when I tried to walk was unbearable.\n\nWe reached camp abreast and were challenged by the sentries, who made a\ngreat show of standing guard.  They took Brown and threw him on the bed\nin his own tent--accepted Fred's offer of silver money--and departed,\nmarching up-street in their heavy, iron-bound military boots with the\nswing and swagger only the Nubian in all the world knows just how to\nget away with.\n\nI lay on the bed in Fred's tent,  and then Kazimoto came to us, hugely\ntroubled about something, stirring the embers of the fire before the\ntent and arranging the lantern so that its rays would betray any\neavesdropper.  He searched all the shadows thoroughly, prodding into\nthem with a stick, before he unburdened his mind.\n\n\"Those askaris were not put here to guard our tents,\" he told us.  (The\nreally good native servant when speaking of his master's property\nalways says our, and never your.)  \"As soon as you were gone the Greeks\nand the Goa came.  They and the askaris questioned me.  It was a trick!\nYou were drawn away on purpose!  One by one--two by two--they\nquestioned us all, but particularly me.\"\n\n\"What about?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"About our business.  Why are we here.  What will we do.  What do we\nknow.  What do I know about you.  What do you know about me.  Why do I\nserve you.  How did I come to take service with you.  To what place\nwill we travel next, and when.  How much money have we with us.  Have\nwe friends or acquaintances in Muanza.  Do you, bwana, carry any\nletters in your pockets.  Of what do you speak when you suppose no man\nis listening.  Bwana, my heart is very sad in me!  Those Greeks tell\nlies, and the Germans stir trouble in a big pot like the witches!  I\nknow the Germans!  I am Nyamwezi.  I was born not far from here, and\nran away as soon as I was old enough because the Germans shot my father\nand let my mother and brothers starve to death.  I did not starve,\nbecause one of them took me for a servant; but I ran away from him.\nMy heart is very sad to be in this place!  They ask what of a hoard of\nivory.  I tell them I do not know, and they threaten to beat me!  This\nplace is bad!  Let us go away to-night!\"\n\nThere was no sleep that night for any of us.  My wound hurt too much.\nThe others were too worried.  By the light of the lantern in Fred's\ntent we cooked up a story to tell that we hoped would induce the\nGermans to let us wander where we chose.\n\n\"Sure, they'll watch us!\" Will admitted.  \"But as our only real reason\nfor coming down here--leaving Brown's cattle out of the reckoning--was\nto throw people off the scent, in what way are we worse off?  The lake\nis big enough to lose ourselves in!  What is it--two hundred and fifty\nmiles long by as many broad?  D'you mean we can't give their sleuths\nthe slip?  We can't beat that for a plan:  let 'em keep on thinking we\nknow where Tippoo hid the stuff.  If we succeed in losing 'em they'll\nthink we're at large in German East and keep on hunting for us--whereas\nwe'll really be up in British East.  Let's send a telegram in code to\nMonty!\"\n\nThen Fred thought of an idea that in the end solved our biggest\nproblem, although we did not think much of it at the time.\n\n\"They may refuse to take a telegram in code,\" he said.  \"It's likely\nthey'll open letters.  (We can try the code, of course.  They'll\nprobably take our money, and put their experts on deciphering the\nmessage.  They'll say it was lost if there are any inquiries\nafterward.)  I propose we send a straight-out cablegram advising Monty\nof our whereabouts (they'll let that go through) and warning him to ask\nfor letters at the Bank in Mombasa before he does anything else.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\" Will objected.\n\n\"Wait!\" said Fred.  \"I haven't finished.  Then write two letters:  one\nfull of any old nonsense, to be sent in the regular way by mail.\nThey'll open that.  The other to go by runner.  Kazimoto can find us a\nrunner.  He knows these Wan-yamwezi.  He can pick a man who'll get\nthrough without fail.\"\n\nWe could think of nothing to say against the plan.  The argument that\nthe German government would scarcely stoop to opening private mail did\nnot seem to hold water when we examined it, so we wrote as Fred\nsuggested--one letter telling Monty that we hoped to make some\narrangement with the Germans, and at all events to wait in German East\nuntil he could join us--and the other telling him the real facts at\ngreat length, laboriously set out in the code we had agreed\nupon.\n\nWe sealed the second letter in several wrappers, and sewed it up\nfinally in a piece of waterproof silk.  Then we sent for Kazimoto and\nordered him to find the sort of messenger we needed.\n\n\"Send me!\" he urged.  \"I will start now, before it is light!  I will\nhide by day and travel by night until I reach the British border!  Give\nme only enough cooked food and my pay and I will take the letter\nwithout fail!\"\n\nWe refused, for he was too useful to us.  He begged again and again to\nbe sent with the letter, promising faithfully to wait for us afterward\non the British side of the border at any place we should name.  But we\nupbraided him for cowardice, ordered him to find another messenger, and\npromised him he need have no fear of Germans as long as he remained our\nservant.\n\nBefore high noon we would each have given many years of Kazimoto's pay\nif only we could have recalled that decision and have known that he was\nspeeding away from Muanza toward a border where white men knew the use\nof mercy.\n\nJust as the first peep of dawn began to color the sky Schubert came\nswaggering down-street to us, wiping his mouth with the back of his\nhand.\n\n\"How have you slept?\" he asked us, laughing.\n\nWe answered something or other.\n\n\"I did not trouble to sleep!  I stayed and finished the drinks.  I have\njust swallowed the last of the beer!  Whoever wants a morning drink\nmust wait for it now until the overland safari comes!\"\n\nWe displayed no interest.  Brown, the only one likely to yearn for\nalcohol before breakfast, snored in his still.\n\n\"What of it now?  I go drill my troops.  Parade is sharp!  There remain\ntwenty minutes.  Come with me tell your secret at the boma now, before\nit is too late!\"\n\n\"Explain why it would be too late after breakfast!\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"All right,\" said Schubert.  \"I will tell you this much.  There will\ncome a launch this morning from Kisumu in British East.  There will be\npeople on that launch, one of whom has authority that overrides that of\nthe commandant of this place.  The commandant desires to know your\ninformation--and get the credit for it--before that individual, whose\nauthority is higher, comes.  Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" Fred answered.\n\n\"See if this is clear, too!\" cut in Will.  \"You go and ask your\ncommandant what price he offers for the secret!  Nothing for nothing!\nTell him we're not afraid of him!\"\n\n\"It is none of my business to tell him anything,\" sneered Schubert,\nspitting and turning on his heel.  He swaggered out of the\ncamping-ground and up-street again, leaving the clear impression behind\nhim that he washed his hands of us for good and all.\n\n\"Let's watch him drill his men,\" said I.  \"I'll wait on the hospital\nsteps until they open the place.\"\n\nSo we ate a scratch breakfast and Fred and Will helped me up-street,\npast where the Jew stood blinking in the morning sun on the steps of\nthe D.O.A.G.  He seemed to be saying prayers, but beckoned to us.\n\n\"Trouble!\" he said.  \"Trouble!  If you have any frien's fetch\nthem--send for them!\"\n\n\"Can yon send a letter for us to British East?\" Fred asked him.\n\n\"God forbid!\" He jumped at the very thought, and shrugged himself like\na man standing under a water-spout.  \"What would they do to me if I\nwere found out?\"\n\n\"What is the nature of the trouble?\" Fred asked him.\n\n\"Ali, who should tell!  Trouble, I tell you, trouble!  Zat cursed\nSchubert sat here drinking until dawn.  I heard heem say many t'ings!\nSend for your friens!\"\n\nHe turned his back on us and ran in.  There was a lieutenant arrayed in\nspotless white with a saber in glittering scabbard watching us all from\nthe boma gate.  A little later that morning we knew better why the Jew\nfled indoors at sight of him.\n\nSchubert was standing in mid-square with a hundred askaris lined up\ntwo-deep in front of him.  There were no other Germans on parade.  The\ncorporals were Nubians, and the rest of the rank and file either Nubian\nor some sort of Sudanese.  He was haranguing them in a bastard mixture\nof Swahili, Arabic, and German, they standing rigidly at attention,\ntheir rifles at the present.\n\nNot content with the effect of his words, he strode up presently to a\nfront-rank man and hit him in the face with clenched fist.  In the\neffort to recover his balance the man let his rifle get out of\nalignment.  Schubert wrenched it from him.  It fell to the ground.  He\nstruck the man, and when he stooped to pick the rifle up kicked him in\nthe face.  Then he strode down the line and beat two other men for\ngrinning.  All this the lieutenant watched without a sign of\ndisapproval, or even much interest.\n\nMeanwhile the chain-gang emerged from the boma gate, going full-pelt,\nfastened neck to neck, the chain taut and each man carrying a\nwater-jar.  The minute they had crossed the square Schubert commenced\nwith company drill, and for two hours after that, with but one interval\nof less than five minutes for rest, he kept them pounding the gravel in\nevolution after evolution--manual exercise at the double--skirmishing\nexercise--setting up drill--goose-step, and all the mechanical,\nmerciless precision drill with which the Germans make machines of men.\n\nHis debauch did not seem in the least to have affected him, unless to\nmake his temper more violently critical.  By seven o'clock the sun was\nbeating down on him and dazzling his eyes from over the boma wall.  The\ndust rose off the square.  The words of command came bellowing in swift\nsuccession from a throat that ought to have been hard put to it to\nwhisper.  If anything, he grew more active and exacting as the askaris\nwearied, and by the time the two hours were up they were ready to a man\nto drop.\n\nBut not so he.  He dismissed them, and swaggered over to the\nmarketplace to hector and bully the natives who were piling their wares\nin the shade of the great grass roof.  Then he went into the boma to\nbreakfast just as a sergeant in khaki came over and unlocked the\nhospital door.  I followed the sergeant in, but he ordered me out again.\n\n\"I have come to see the doctor,\" I said. \"I need attention.\"\n\nHe was not one of the sergeants who had been drunk in the D.O.A.G. the\nnight before, but a man of a higher mental type, although no less surly.\n\n\"It will be for the doctor to say what you need when he has seen you!\"\nhe answered, turning his back and busying himself about the room.  Will\ntranslated, and I limped out again.\n\nBy and by the doctor came, and passed me sitting on the steps amid a\nthrong of natives who seemed to have all the imaginable kinds of sores.\nHe took no notice of me, but sent out the sergeant to inquire why I\nhad not stood up as he passed.  I did not answer, and the sergeant went\nin again.\n\nFred by that time was simply blasphemous, alternately threatening to go\nin and kick the doctor, and condemning Will's determination to do the\nsame thing.     Finally we decided to see the matter through patiently,\nand all sat together on the steps watching the activity of the square.\nThere was a lot going on--bartering of skins and hides--counting of\ncrocodile eggs, brought in by natives for sake of the bounty of a few\ncopper coins the hundred--a cock-fight in one corner--the carrying to\nand fro of bunches of bananas, meat, and grain in baskets; and in and\nout among it all full pelt in the hot sun marched the chain-gang, doing\nthe township dirty work.\n\nBy and by Schubert emerged from the boma gate followed by natives\ncarrying a table and a soap-box.  He set these under a limb of the\ngreat baobab that faced the boma gate not far from the middle of the\nsquare.  I noticed then for the first time that a short hempen rope\nhung suspended from the largest branch, with a noose in the end.  The\nnoose was not more than two feet below the branch.\n\nSchubert's consideration of the table's exact position, and the placing\nof the soap-box on the table, was interrupted by the arrival of\nCoutlass, his Greek companion and the Goanese arm in arm, followed\nclosely by two askaris who shouted angrily and made a great show of\ntrying to prevent them.  One of the askaris aimed his rifle absurdly at\nCoutlass, both Greeks and the Goanese daring him gleefully to pull the\ntrigger.\n\nThey purposely came close to us, not that we showed signs of meaning to\nbefriend them.  They were simply unable to understand that there are\ndegrees of disgrace. To Coutlass all victims of government outrage\nought surely to be more than friendly with any one in conflict with the\nlaw.  Personal quarrels should go for nothing in face of the common\nwrong.\n\n\"There is going to be a hanging!\" Coutlass shouted to us.  \"They\nthought we would remain quietly in camp with that going on!  Give us\nchairs!\" he called to Schubert.  \"Provide us a place in the front row\nwhere we may see!\"\n\nSchubert grinned.  He returned to the boma yard and presumably\nconferred with an officer, for presently he came out again and gave the\nGreeks leave to stand under the tree, provided they would return to\ncamp afterward.  Later yet, Brown came along and joined us on the\nsteps, looking red-eyed and ridiculous.\n\n\"Goin' to be a hangin,\" he announced.  \"I been askin' natives about it.\nBlack man stole the condemned man's daughter an' refused to pay cows\nfor her accordin' to custom or anythin'--said he could do what the\nwhite men did an' help himself.  Father of the girl took a spear and\nsettled the thief's hash with it--ran him through--did a clean job.\nServe him right--eh--what?  Germans went an' nabbed him, though--tried\nhim in open court--goin' to hang him this mornin' for murder!  How does\nit strike you?\"\n\nWe were not exactly in mood to talk to Brown--in fact, we wished him\nanywhere but with us, but he thought self perfectly welcome, and\nrambled on:\n\n\"Up in British East we don't hang black men for murder unless it's what\nthey call an aggravated case--murder an' robbery--murder an'\narson--murder an' rape.  Hang a white man for murderin' a black sure as\nyou're sitting here, an' shoot a black man for murderin' a white; but\nthe blacks don't understand, so when they kill one another in such a\ncase this, why we give 'em a short jail sentence an' a good lo lecture,\nan' let 'em go again.  These folks have it t'other way round.  They\nnever hang a German, whether he's guilty or not, but hang a poor black\nman, what doesn't understand, for half o' nothin'!\"\n\nA great crowd began gathering about the tree, and was presently driven\nby askaris with whips into a mass on the far side of the tree from us.\nWhether purposely or not, they left a clear view from the hospital\nsteps of all that should happen.  Evidently warning had been sent out\nbroadcast, for the inhabitants of village after village came trooping\ninto town to watch, each lot led by its sultani in filthy rags and the\nfoolish imitation crown his conquerors had supplied him at several\ntimes its proper price.  The square was a dense sea of people before\nnine o'clock, and the askaris made the front few hundreds lie, and the\nnext rows squat, in order that the men and women behind might see.\n\nThen at last out came the victim with his hands tied behind him and a\nbright red blanket on his loins.  He was a proud-looking fellow.  He\nhalted a moment between his guard of German sergeants and eyed the\ncrowd, and us, and the tree, and the noose.  Then he looked down on the\nground and appeared to take no further interest.\n\nThe sergeants took him by the arms and led him along to the table\nbetween them.  Out came the commandant then, in snow-white uniform,\nwith his saber polished until it shone--all spruced up for the\noccasion, and followed by a guard of honor consisting of lieutenant,\ntwo sergeants, and six black askaris.\n\nThere was a chair by the table.  At sight of the commandant the\nsergeants made their victim use that as a step by which to mount the\ntable and soap-box, and there he stood eying his oppressors as calmly\nas if he were witnessing a play.  A murmur arose among the crowd.  A\nnumber of natives called to him by name, but he took no notice after\nthat one first steady gaze.\n\n\"They're sayin' good-by to him,\" said Brown, breathing in my ear.\n\"They're telling him they won't forget him!\"\n\nThe crack of askaris' whips falling on head and naked shoulders swiftly\nreduced the crowd to silence.  Then the commandant faced them all, and\nmade a speech with that ash-can voice of his--first in German, then in\nthe Nyamwezi tongue.  Will translated to us sentence by sentence, the\ndoctor standing on the top step behind us smiling approval.  He seemed\nto think we would be benefited by the lecture just as much as the\nnatives.\n\nIt was awful humbug that the commandant reeled off to his silent\naudience--hypocrisy garbed in paternal phrases, and interlarded with\nbuncombe about Germany's mission to bring happiness to subject peoples.\n\n\"Above all,\" he repeated again and again, \"the law must be enforced\nimpartially--the good, sound, German law that knows no fear or favor,\nbut governs all alike!\"\n\nWhen he had finished he turned to the culprit.\n\n\"Now,\" he demanded, \"do you know why you are to be hanged?\"\n\nThere was a moment's utter silence.  The crowd drew in its breath,\nseeming to know in advance that some brave answer was forthcoming.  The\nman on the table with his hands behind him surveyed the crowd again\nwith the gaze of simple dignity, looked down on the commandant, and\nraised his voice.  It was an unexpected, high, almost falsetto note,\nthat in the silence carried all across the square.\n\n\"I am to die,\" he said, \"because I did right!  My enemy did what German\nofficers do.  He stole my young girl.  I killed him, as I hope all you\nGermans may be killed!  But hope no longer gathers fruit in this land!\"\n\n\"Ah-h-h-h!\" the crowd sighed in unison.\n\n\"Good man!\" exploded Fred, and the doctor tried to kick him from\nbehind--not hard, but enough to call his attention to the proprieties.\nHis toe struck me instead, and when I looked up angrily he tried to\npretend he was not aware of what he had done.\n\nUnder the trees the commandant flew into a rage such I have seldom\nseen.  Each land has a temper of its own, and the white man's anger\nvaries in inverse ratio with his nearness to the equator.  But furor\nteutonicus transplanted is the least controllable, least dignified,\nleast admirable that there is.  And that man's passion was the apex of\nits kind.\n\nHis beard spread, as a peacock spreads its tail.  His eyes blazed.  His\neyebrows disappeared under the brim of his white helmet, and his\nclenched fists burst the white cotton gloves.  He half-drew his\nsaber--thought better of that, and returned it.  There was an askari\nstanding near with kiboko in hand to drive back the crowd should any\npress too closely.  He snatched the whip and struck the condemned man\nwith it, as high up as he could reach, making a great welt across his\nbare stomach.  The man neither winced nor complained.\n\n\"For those words,\" the commandant screamed at him in German, \"you shall\nnot die in comfort!  For that insolence, mere hanging is too good!\"\n\nThen he calmed himself a little, and repeated the words in the native\ntongue, explaining to the crowd that German dignity should be upheld at\nall costs.\n\n\"Fetch him down from there,\" he ordered.\n\nSchubert sprang on the table and knocked the condemned man off it with\na blow of his fist.  With hands bound behind him the poor fellow had no\npower of balance, and though he jumped clear he fell face-downward,\nskinning his cheek on the gravel.  The commandant promptly put a foot\non his neck and pinned him down.\n\n\"Flog him!\" he ordered. \"Two hundred lashes!\"\n\nIt was done in silence, except for the corporal's labored breathing and\nthe commandant's incessant sharp commands to beat\nharder--harder--harder.  A sergeant stood by counting.  The crack of\nthe whip divided up the silence into periods of agony.\n\nWhen the count was done the victim was still conscious.  Schubert and a\nsergeant dragged him to his feet, and hauled him to the table.  Four\nother men--two sergeants and two natives--passed a rope round the table\nlegs.  Schubert lifted the victim by the elbows so that his head could\npass through the noose, and when that was accomplished the man had to\nstand on tiptoe on the soap-box in order to breathe at all.\n\n\"All ready!\" announced Schubert, and jumped off with a laugh, his white\ntunic bloody from contact with the victim's tortured back.\n\n\"Los!\" roared the commandant\n\nThe men hauled on the rope.  Table and soap-box came tumbling away, and\nthe victim spun in the air on nothing, spinning round, and round, and\nround--slower and slower and slower--then back the other way round\nfaster and faster.\n\nThey say hanging is a merciful death--that the pressure of rope on two\narteries produces anesthesia, but few are reported to have come back to\ntell of the experience.  At any rate, as is not the case with shooting,\nit is easy to know when the victim is really dead.\n\nFor seconds that seemed minutes--for minutes that seemed hours the poor\nwretch spun, his elbows out, his knees up, his tongue out, his face\nwrinkled into tortured shapes, and his toes pointed upward so sharply\nthat they almost touched his shins.  Then suddenly the toes turned\ndownward and the knees relapsed.  The corpse hung limp, and the crowd\nsighed miserably, to the last man, woman and child, turning its back on\nwhat to them must have symbolized German rule.\n\nThey left the corpse hanging there.  It was to be there until evening,\nsome one said, for an example to frequenters of the market-place.  The\ncrowd trailed away, none glancing back.  The pattering of feet ceased.\nThe market-place across the square resumed its hum and activity.  Then\na native orderly came down the steps and touched me on the elbow.  I\nstruggled to my feet and limped after him up the steps.\n\nPractically at the mercy of the doctor, I made up my mind to be civil\nto him whether that suited me or not.  I rather expected he would come\nto meet me, perhaps help me to chair, and I wondered how, in my\nignorance of German, I should contrive to answer his questions.\n\nBut I need not have worried.  I did not even see him.  He had left by\nthe back door, and the orderly washed the wound and changed my\nbandages.  That was all.  There was no charge for the bandages, and the\norderly was gentle now that his master's back was turned.\n\n\"Didn't he leave word when he would see me?\" I asked.\n\n\"Habandh!\" he answered--meaning, \"He did not--there is not--there is\nnothing doing!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nIPSOS CUSTODES\n\n  We were an ignorant people.  Out of a gloom we came\n  Hungering, striving, feasting--vanishing into the same.\n  Came to us your foreloopers, told us the gloom was bad,\n  Spoke of the Light that might be--simply it could be had--\n  Knowledge and wealth and freedom, plenty and peace and play,\n  And at all the price of obedience. \"Listen and learn and obey,\"\n  We were told, \"and the gloom shall be lifted.  Ignorance surely\n      is shame.\"\n  We listened to your foreloopersy till presently Cadis* came.\n\n  We were an ignorant people.  Our law was \"an eye for an eye,\"\n  And he who wronged should right the wrong, and he who stole should die--\n  Bad law the Cadis told us, based on the fall of man;\n  And they set us to building law-courts on the Pangermanic plan--\n  Courts where the gloom of ages should be pierced, said they, with Light\n  And scientific theory displace wrong views of Right.\n  The Cadis' law was writ in books that only they could read,\n  But what should we know of the strings to that?  'Twas gloom when\n      we agreed.\n\n  We were an ignorant people.  The Offizieren came\n  To lend to law eye, tooth, and claw and so enforce the same.\n  Now nought are the tribal customs; free speech is under ban;\n  Displaced are misconceptions that were based on fallen man,\n  And our gloom has gone in darkness of the risen German's night,\n  Nor is there salt of mercy lest it sap the hold of Might.\n  They strike--we may not answer, nor dare we ask them why.\n  We sold ourselves to supermen.  If we rebel, we die.\n\n-----------------\n* Cadi--judge.\n-----------------\n\n\nI sat down once more on the hospital steps, and listened while Fred and\nWill relieved themselves of their opinions about German manners.\nNothing seemed likely to relieve me.  I had marched a hundred miles,\nendured the sickening pain, and waited an extra night at the end of it\nall simply on the strength of anticipation.  Now that the surgeon would\nnot see me, hope seemed gone.  I could think of nothing but to go and\nhide somewhere, like a wounded animal.\n\nBut there were two more swift shocks in store, and no hiding-place.\nThe path to the water-front led past us directly along the southern\nboma wall.  Before Fred and Will had come to an end of swearing they\nsaw something that struck them silent so suddenly that I looked up and\nsaw, too. Not that I cared very much.  To me it seemed merely one last\nsuper-added piece of evidence that life was not worth while.\n\nPlainly the launch had come from British East, of which Schubert had\nspoken.  Hand in hand from the water-front, followed by the obsequious\nSchubert, all smiles and long black whip (for the chain-gang trailed\nafter with the luggage, and needed to be overawed), walked Professor\nSchillingschen and Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon.  They seemed in love--or\nat any rate the professor did, for he ogled and smirked like a bearded\ngargoyle; and she made such play of being charmed by his grimaces that\nthe Syrian maid fell behind to hide her face.\n\nNone of us spoke.  We watched them.  Personally I did not mind the\nfeeling that the worst had happened at last.  I was incapable of\nsounding further depths of gloom--too full of pain bodily to suffer\nmentally from threats of what might yet be.  But the other two looked\nmiserable--more so because Fred's bearded chin perked up so bravely,\nand Will set his jaw like a rock.\n\nNot one of us had said a word when the biggest askari we had seen yet\nstrode up to us--saluted--and gave Fred a sealed envelope.  It was\nwritten in English, addressed to us three by name (although our names\nwere wrongly spelled).  We were required to present ourselves at the\ncourt-house at once, reason not given.  The letter was signed\n\"Liebenkrantz,--Lieutenant.\"\n\nThe askari waited for us.  I suppose it would not be correct to say we\nwere under arrest, but the enormous black man made it sufficiently\nobvious that he did not intend returning to the court without us.  The\ncourt-house was not more than two hundred yards away.  As we turned\ntoward it we saw Lady Saffren Waldon being helped into the commandant's\nlitter, borne by four men, the commandant himself superintending the\nceremony with a vast deal of bowing and chatter, and Professor\nSchillingschen looking on with an air of owning litter, porters,\ntownship, boma, and all.  As we turned our backs on them they started\noff toward the neat white dwelling on the hill.\n\nThe court was a round, grass-roofed affair, with white-washed walls of\nsun-dried brick.  For about four-fifths of the circumference the wall\nwas barely breast-high, the roof being supported on wooden pillars\nbricked into the wall, as well as by the huge pole that propped it up\numbrella-wise in the center.\n\nThe remaining fifth of the wall continued up as high as the roof,\nforming a back to the platform.  Facing the platform was the entrance,\nand on either side benches arranged in rows followed the curve of the\nwall.  There was a long table on the platform, at which sat the\nlieutenant who had summoned us, with a sergeant seated on either hand.\nThe sergeants were acting as court clerks, scribbling busily on sheets\nof blue paper, and in books.\n\nBehind the lieutenant, in a great gilt frame on the white-washed wall,\nwas a full-length portrait of the Kaiser in general's uniform.  The\nKaiser was depicted scowling, his gloved hands resting on a saber\nalmost as ferocious-looking as the one the lieutenant kept winding his\nleg around.\n\nAll the benches were crowded with spectators, prisoners, witnesses, and\nlitigants.  Outside, at least two hundred Arabs, Indians, and natives\nleaned with elbows on the wall and gazed at the scene within.  The\nlieutenant glared, but otherwise took no notice of our entry; he gave\nno order, but one of the two sergeants came down from the platform and\nkicked half a dozen natives off the front bench to make room for us.\n\nWe were mistaken in supposing our case would be called first, or even\namong the first.  The floor in the midst of the court was clear except\nfor a long single line of natives and six askari corporals, each with a\nwhip in his hand.  It was evident at once that these natives were all\nahead of us, even if those on the benches were not to be heard and\ndealt with before our turn came.\n\n\"Look at the far end of the line!\" whispered Fred.\n\nLo and behold Kazimoto, looking rather drawn and gray, but standing\nbravely, looking neither to the right nor left.  I judged he knew we\nwere in court--he could hardly have failed to notice our coming in--but\nhe sturdily refused to turn his head and see us.\n\n\"What has he done?\" I wondered.\n\n\"Nothing more than told some Heinie to go to hell--you can bet your\nboots!\" said Will.\n\nThe lieutenant was in no hurry to enlighten us.  Our boy stood at the\nwrong end of the line to be taken first.  The lieutenant called a name,\nand two great askaris pounced on the trembling native at the other end\nand dragged him forward, leaving him standing alone before the desk.\n\n\"Silence!\" the lieutenant shouted, and the court became still as death.\n\nHe had a voice as mean as a hyena's--a voice that matched his face.\nThe insolent, upturned twist of his fair mustache showed both corners\nof a thin-lipped mouth.  He had the Prussian head, shaped square\nwhichever way you viewed it.  There was strength in the\njaw-bones--strength in the deep-set bright eyes--strength in the\nshoulders that were square as box-corners without any padding--strength\nin the lean lithe figure; but it was always brute strength.  There was\nno moral strength whatever in the restless fidgeting--the savage\nwinding and unwinding of his left foot around the saber scabbard, or\nthe attitude, leaning forward over the table, of petulant pugnacity.\nAnd the cruel voice was as weak as the hand was strong with which he\nrapped on the table.\n\nHe questioned the boy in front of him sharply--told him he stood\ncharged with theft--and demanded an answer.\n\n\"With theft of what thing, and whose thing?\"\n\nThe answer was bold.  The trembling had ceased.  Now that he faced\nnemesis the strength of native fatalism came to his rescue, bolstering\nup the pride that every uncontaminated Nyamwezi owns.  He was not more\nthan seventeen years old, but he stood there at last like a veteran at\nbay.\n\n\"Put him down and beat him!\" ordered the lieutenant.\n\n\"Impudent answers to this court shall always be soundly punished!  Call\nthe next case while that one is being taught good manners.\"\n\nA woman was stood in front of the line, fidgety with fear, in doubt\nwhether to lay her suckling baby on the bench before she faced military\njustice.  She laid it on the floor at her feet, hesitated, and then\npicked it up again and wrapped it in a corner of the red blanket that\nconstituted her only dress.\n\n\"Take that brat away from her!\" the lieutenant ordered.  \"She must pay\nattention to me.  With that in her arms she will only think of\nmothering!\"\n\nAn askari seized the baby by the arm and leg and gave it with a laugh\nto another woman to hold, its mother whimpering with fright until she\nsaw it safely nestled.\n\n\"Quick, now!  What about this one?\"\n\nIt seemed there was no charge against her.  The two sergeants searched\nthrough the piles of blue sheets in vain.\n\n\"Then what the devil is she here for?  What do you want, you?\"\n\nThe trembling woman pointed to her baby, but was dumb.  It needed\ncourage to answer that lieutenant, and the crack--crack--crack of a\nthick kiboko descending at measured intervals on the naked back of the\nboy who had answered boldly was no help toward reassurance.\n\n\"Speak!\" the lieutenant ordered, \"or I shall have you compelled to\nspeak!\"\n\nShe burst into sudden volubility.  The dam once down, she poured forth\na catalogue of wrongs that seemed endless, switching off from one\ndialect to another and at intervals inserting, apropos apparently of\nnothing, the few words of German she had picked up.  The lieutenant\nyelled for an interpreter, and a Nyamwezi who knew German rose from the\nfront bench and came and stood beside her.\n\n\"That baby is a white man's,\" he explained.\n\n\"What does she want?\"\n\n\"She says the white man is the bwana dakitari (the doctor!).\"\n\n\"Oh!  Then I am glad she came here.  It is time these loose women were\ntaught a lesson!  They tell the same tale.  They say a white man passed\nthrough the village, gave their father a present, and carried them off.\nIs that her tale, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well--what of it?  The father agreed at the time when he accepted the\npresent, didn't he?  The consequence is a baby--not for the first time!\nInstead of going back to her village, she comes here and tries to\nblackmail the officer!  She is young.  It's the first time she has been\nin this court.  This time I will be lenient.  One hundred lashes!\"\n\nThe interpreter translated, and the woman screamed.  An askari seized\nher by the shoulders.  She clung to him, but he threw her to the\nground, and another one tore off the blanket that would have deadened\nthe blows to some extent.  She begged, and clung to their feet, but the\nblows began to rain on her, and presently she lay still, her breasts\nflattened against the earth floor, her mouth full of dust, and her\nnaked body paralyzed by fear of the descending lash.\n\n\"Now bring up number one again!\" the lieutenant ordered.\n\nThe askaris ceased from flogging him.  One of them kicked him to his\nfeet, and he resumed his stand in front of the lieutenant, looking up\nat him as proudly as ever, for all that his back was bruised and bloody.\n\n\"Did you steal or did you not?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"Steal what from whom?\"\n\n\"Oh, go on beating him! Next case!\"\n\nThe next man escaped the whip, but his witnesses were less\nfortunate.  He brought two men and a woman with him to prove an alibi\non a charge of attempted theft, and the glibness of their answers\nconvinced the lieutenant they were lying.  In the absence of all\nevidence for the prosecution except the unsupported word of a police\naskari who admitted a personal grudge against the defendant, the\nlieutenant resorted to the whip to change the witnesses' convictions,\nbut without avail.\n\nThe woman yelled under the lash like a demented thing, but, far from\nwithdrawing her statements, tried to spit in the lieutenant's face when\njerked to her feet and stood again before him--an impossible feat\nbecause the platform on which he sat at the table was too high.  He had\nher beaten a second time for spitting.\n\nThe next man was a fat Baganda from British territory, charged with\ntrading without a license.  He pleaded ignorance of the law, and denied\nhaving traded.  He was flogged for telling lies in court, and changed\nhis testimony under the lash, whereat he was promptly sentenced to a\nhundred and fifty lashes and a month on the chain-gang.  Under the lash\na second time, he recanted--swore that his first statements had been\ntrue and that he had done no trading--a mistake in tactics that only\ncaused the tale of lashes to be increased by fifty and the term on the\nchain-gang to be doubled.\n\n\"You must learn that the methods taught you on British territory are of\nno use here!\" remarked the lieutenant.\n\nBy the time Kazimoto was called and stood out alone in front of him the\nlieutenant was in a boiling rage, and the floor of the court was\nactually crowded by prone natives being beaten.  Extra askaris had been\nsent for in order that proceedings might not be delayed, and the\naudience could scarcely hear the evidence and sentences because of the\ncrack of whips and the moans of victims. (Not that they all moaned by\nany means.  By far the most of them submitted to the torture in grim\nproud silence:  but the few who did make a noise--especially the\nwomen--made lots of it.)\n\nAs Kazimoto faced the lieutenant he turned once and looked at us.  His\neyes sought Fred's.\n\n\"Oh, bwana!\" he said--and now for the first time we learned why he had\nchosen Fred to be his particular master.  \"I have been faithful!\nStroke, then, that beard of yours as Bwana Courtney, my former master,\nused to stroke his.  Then we shall both know what to do!\"\n\nFred stroked his beard promptly, for the man needed comfort, not\nridicule:  but the concession to his superstition did none of us any\ngood.\n\n\"Face this way!\" the lieutenant shouted at him.  \"You are charged with\nbeing a deserter from German service.  Also with giving information to\nforeigners.  Also with serving foreigners in their effort to exploit\nthe country, and with refusing to give proper answers when questioned\nby those in authority.  Do you understand?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kazimoto in the most melancholy tone I ever heard from him.\n\n\"Are you a Nyamwezi?  Now don't dare to lie to me!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You were born in this country?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you belong in this country!\"\n\n\"I belong where my master takes me.  My spirit is good.  I am a true\nman,\" Kazimoto answered.\n\n\"Your spirit is rotten!  You are a traitor!  What do you mean by\ntalking to me of your master, you reptile!  Your master is the German\ngovernment, of which His Majesty the Kaiser is supreme overlord!  There\nis a picture of your master!\"  He pointed with a thumb over his\nshoulder to the full-length atrocity in oils behind him.  \"Salute it!\"\n\nThe boy obeyed.\n\n\"Answer now!  Who is your master?\"\n\nKazimoto hesitated.\n\n\"Answer, I order you!\"\n\nHe turned and pointed a finger at Fred, who nodded.\n\n\"That English bwana is my master,\" he said stoutly.  It was a forlorn\nhope, though.  He did not seem to believe that the statement of fact\nwould do him any good.\n\nFred jumped to his feet.\n\n\"That is perfectly correct,\" he said in English.  \"The boy is my\nservant, engaged on British territory, under a contract for wages to be\npaid in English money.  He is to be paid off in British East at the end\nof my journey.\"\n\n\"Who asked you to speak?\" demanded the lieutenant angrily, sitting up\nlike a startled scorpion.  \"Do you not know this is a court?\"\n\n\"It looks like a shambles!\" Fred answered, glancing to right and left\nand indicating the victims of the whip writhing in the name of German\njustice.\n\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" counseled Will in a stage whisper, but either Fred\ndid not hear him, or was too worked up to care.\n\n\"Silence! Sit down!\"\n\n\"I warn you!\" Fred answered.  \"That boy has claimed British protection.\nI shall see he has it!\"\n\nThen he sat down.  The lieutenant glared at Kazimoto, the glare\nchanging to a cold grin as he realized how fully we were all at his\nmercy for the moment.\n\n\"You are sentenced,\" he said, \"to two hundred lashes for making\nimpudent answers to the court, and to six months on the chain-gang for\ndeserting from this country and entering foreign service.  Further\nevidence against you will be assembled in the meanwhile, and other\ncharges against you will be tried on completion of the chain-gang\nsentence!\"\n\n\"I protest!\" shouted Fred, jumping up again.  \"I give notice of appeal\nto whatever higher court there is.  I am ready to give bonds!\"\n\n\"What does this delay mean?\" snapped the lieutenant.  \"Put him down at\nonce and lay the lashes on!\"\n\nThe unfortunate Kazimoto was pounced on by two askaris and thrown\nface-downward on the floor.  One of them tore off his clothes, ripping\nup his good English jacket.\n\n\"Did you hear my protest?\" shouted Fred.  \"Did you hear my notice of\nappeal?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said the lieutenant.  \"Appeals are heard at the coast.  You\nmust give notice by mail, and receive an acknowledgment from the higher\nmilitary court before I grant stay of execution.  Lay on the lashes!\"\n\n\"I will hold you personally liable for this outrage,\" Fred told him,\n\"if it costs me all my money and all the rest of my years!  I defy you\nto continue!\"\n\n\"You have yourself to blame!\" the lieutenant grinned.  \"But for your\nuninvited interruption the Nyamwezi would have had a better hearing!\nLay those lashes on harder and more slowly!\"\n\nKazimoto was taking his gruel like a man.  Two askaris were beating\nhim.  The blows fell at random anywhere below the neck and above the\nheels, raising a great welt where they did not actually cut the skin.\nHe had buried his face in his forearms, and Will had gone to stand near\nhim, stooping down to encourage him with any words at all that might\nseem to serve.\n\n\"Stick it out, Kazi!  We'll stand by!  We won't leave you down here!\nRemember you've got friends who won't desert you!\"\n\nProbably in his agony Kazimoto did not understand a word of it, but the\nlieutenant did,--and swiftly took steps to interfere.\n\n\"Call the Europeans' cases next!\" he shouted, and promptly the German\nsergeants stepped down from the platform to marshal us in line.  The\nlieutenant went through the form of studying the blue papers, and\ncalled out our names.  That of Brown was included, but Brown was not in\ncourt and we were kept standing there until he had been fetched from\nhis tent.  He had retired immediately after the hanging to sleep off\nthe effects of his debauch, and being now deprived of that luxury\narrived between two askaris in a volcanic temper.  He insulted the\nlieutenant to begin with.\n\n\"A diet o' beer an' sausage don't seem to have filled you full o' good\nmanners, do it?\"\n\nThe lieutenant scowled, but for the moment chose to ignore the\npleasantry.\n\n\"You people are charged,\" he said, \"with entering German territory\notherwise than by a regular road and without reporting at a customs\nstation.  Further, with intending to defraud the customs--with carrying\nand possessing arms without a license--with being in possession of\nammunition without a permit--with shooting game without a license--with\nfilibustering--with intentional homicide, in that you shot and killed\ncertain men of the Masai tribe within German territory--with wandering\nat large without permits and with felonious intent; and last, and this\nis the most serious charge, with being spies within the military\nmeaning of that term.  Do you plead guilty or not guilty?\"\n\nWe were dumb.  Even the crack of the heavy whips on poor Kazimoto's\nskin ceased to make impression on us.  Suffering already from my wound\nto the point of nausea, I actually reeled before this new deluge of\ntrouble, and had to hold on to Fred and Will.  They each put an arm\nunder mine.  It was Brown who spoke and stole from our sails what\nlittle wind there might have been.\n\n\"Decline to plead!\" he shouted boisterously.  \"You're no judge, you're\na pirate!  You're not fit to try natives, let alone white men!  You're\na disgrace, that's what you are!  All you're fit for is to make a\ndecent fellow glad he needn't know you!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" roared the lieutenant, banging on the table with his open\npalm--then with his fist--then with a mallet.\n\n\"Silence yourself!\" retorted Brown as soon as the hammering ceased.\n\"You ought to be ashamed o' yourself!  Your court's a bally disgrace,\nan' you're the worst thing in it!  You and your Kaiser can go to hell,\nand be damned to both of you!\"\n\n\"One month in jail for contempt of court and Majestaets-beleidigung!\"\nsnapped the lieutenant. \"Take him away!\"\n\nQuite clearly that was not the first time that a white man had been\nimprisoned in Muanza.  There was no hesitation about the way in which\nan askari seized Brown's wrists or a sergeant snapped the handcuffs.\nHe was hustled out expostulating, kicked on the shins by the sergeant\nwhen he faced about to argue, and shoved into a run by both sergeant\nand askari.\n\n\"You others would better be careful what you say!\" said the lieutenant.\n\n\"I've a mind to share Brown's cell!\" said Will, but the lieutenant\naffected not to hear that.\n\n\"Since you refuse to plead in this court, you shall be held until the\narrival of Major Schunck from the coast.  Your arms and ammunition are\nto be handed over to the askaris, who will be sent to the rest-camp to\nreceive them.  The askaris will search your belongings thoroughly to\nmake sure they have all your weapons.  You are ordered confined within\nthe limits of this township, and if you are detected making any attempt\nto trespass outside township limits you will be confined as the Greeks\nare within the rest-camp under observation.  The porters you brought\ninto the country are all to be paid their full wages by you until Major\nSchunck shall have dealt with you; the porters are refused permission\nto leave Muanza, being needed as witnesses.  Next case!\"\n\nHe scrawled his signature at the foot of each sheet of blue paper, and\nmade a motion with his arm that we should leave court.  But we sat down\nand waited until the two Nubian giants had finished flogging Kazimoto,\nand when they dragged him to his feet Will and Fred walked over to give\nhim a few words of comfort.  That act of ordinary kindness threw the\nlieutenant into another fury.\n\n\"Bring the Nyamwezi here!\" he ordered, and the askaris hustled him up\nin front of the table.\n\n\"What do you do?  Have you no manners?  Return proper thanks for the\nlesson you have received!\"\n\nKazimoto stood silent.\n\n\"For God's sake--\" Will began.\n\n\"Say 'Thank you' to him, Kazimoto!\" Fred whispered.\n\nThere is no native word for \"Thank you\"--only a bastard thing\nintroduced by tyrants from Europe who never understood the African\ncontention that the giver rewards himself if his gift is worth anything\nat all.\n\n\"Asente,\" said Kazimoto meekly.\n\n\"Why don't you salute?  Don't you know where you are?\"\n\n\"For the love of God salute him!\" Will almost shouted.\n\nKazimoto obeyed.\n\n\"Take him and put him on the chain-gang!\" ordered the lieutenant. \"You\nEuropeans leave the court!\"\n\n\"I'm no European!\" Will shouted back.  \"Thank the Lord I was born in a\ncountry you'll never set foot in!\"\n\n\"Take them away before I have to make an example of them!\" the\nlieutenant ordered.\n\nObediently the askaris gathered about us and hustled us out into the\nopen, poking at my bandaged wound to get swifter action, and going as\nfar as to threaten us with their hippo-hide whips.  I trod on the naked\ntoe of one of them with sufficient suddenness and weight to deprive him\nof the use of it for all time, and luckily for me he did not see who\ndid it.  The askari next to him had boots on, and got the blame.\n\nThe black men who were to search our belongings tried to induce us to\nhurry, but we insisted on seeing the iron ring riveted to Kazimoto's\nneck.  The ring had a shackle on it, and through that they passed the\nlong chain that held him prisoner in the midst of a gang of forty men.\nNobody washed the wounds on his back.  We bought water from a woman who\nwas passing with a great jar on her head, and did that much for him.\nHe was naked.  His clothes that the askaris had torn from him had been\nthrown outside the court, and some one had stolen them.  Later they\ngave him a piece of cheap calico to bind round his waist, but during\nall that hot afternoon he had nothing to keep the sun from his tortured\nback; nor would they permit us to give him anything.\n\nThe mortification of having one's private belongings gone through by\nblack men in uniform was made more exasperating still by the fact that\nCoutlass and the other Greek and the Goanese were spectators, amusing\nthemselves with comments that came nearer to causing murder than they\nguessed.\n\nThe real motive of the search was evident within two minutes from the\ncommencement.  The askaris could not read, but they showed a most\nremarkable affinity for paper that had been written on.  They took the\nguns and ammunition first, but after that they emptied everything from\nour bags and boxes on to the sand, and confiscated every scrap of\npaper, shaking our books to make sure nothing was left between the\nleaves.\n\nThey even took away our writing material in their zeal to find\ninformation likely to prove useful to their masters.  But they forgot\nto search our pockets, so that they overlooked the letter we had\nwritten in code to Monty and had not yet sent away by messenger.\n\nThat letter became our most besetting problem.  How to find a runner\nwho would take it to British East and mail it for us up there without\nbetraying us first to the Germans was something we could not guess.\nEven Fred grew gloomy when we realized there was probably not a native\non the whole countryside with sufficient manhood left in him to dare\nmake the attempt.  The first overture we might make would almost\ncertainly be reported to the commandant at once.\n\n\"What fools we were not to send Kazimoto with it when he begged us to!\"\n\n\"What worse than fools!\"\n\n\"What brutes!  Think what we might have saved him!\"\n\nWe were unanimous as to that, but unanimity brought no comfort, until\nwe all together hit on a notion that did ease our feelings a trifle.\nCoutlass and his two friends were sitting on camp-stools in the open\nwhere they could have a full view of our doings.  Assuming the\ncamping-ground to be equally divided between their party and ours, they\nwere well within our portion.  We decided their curiosity was insolent,\ndeclared inexorable war, and there and then felt better.\n\nFred went out with a tent-peg and scored in the sand a deep line to\ndenote our boundary, the Greeks watching, all eyes and guesswork.\n\n\"Over the other side with you!\" Fred ordered when he had finished.\n\nThey refused.  He charged at them, and they ran.\n\n\"Whichever of you, man or servant, sets foot on our side of that line\nshall be a dead-sure hospital case!\" Fred announced.  \"We'll\nreciprocate by leaving your side of the camp to you!\"\n\n\"Who made you men rulers of this rest-camp?\" Coutlass demanded.\n\n\"We did,\" Fred answered.  \"We've lost our rifles just as you have.\nWe'll fight you with bare hands and skin you alive if you trespass!\"\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" shouted Coutlass.  \"By hell and Waterloo, you mistake\nme for a weakling!  Wait and see!\"\n\nWe had to wait a very long and weary time, but we did see.  In the days\nthat followed, when my wound festered and I grew too ill to drag myself\nabout, Fred and Will were able to leave me alone in the camp without\nany fear of a visit from the Greeks.  It was not that there was much\nleft worth stealing, but a mere visit from them might have had\nconsequences we could never have offset.  Alone, unable to rise, I\ncould not have forced them to leave, and their lingering would surely\nhave been interpreted by the guard, who always watched them from the\ncorner of the road, as evidence of collusion of some sort between them\nand us.\n\nJust at that time Coutlass, as it happened, would have liked nothing\nbetter in the world than the chance to persuade the Germans that he was\nin our councils.  Fred's mere irritable determination to divide the\ncamp in halves saved us in all human probability from a trap out of\nwhich there would have been no escape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n\n\"SPEAK YE, AND SO DO\"\n\n  Ok Thou, who gavest English speech\n        To both our Anglo-Saxon breeds,\n  And didst adown all ages teach\n        That Art of crowning words with deeds,\n  May we, who use the speech, be blest\n        With bravery, that when shall come\n  In thy full time our hour of test--\n        That promised hour of Christendom,\n  We may be found, whate'er our need,\n        How grim soe'er our circumstance,\n  Unwilling to be fed or freed,\n        Or fame or fortune to enhance\n  By flinching from the good begun,\n        By broken word or serpent plan,\n  Or cruelty in malice done\n        To helpless beast or subject man.\n                                Amen\n\n\nThere was method, of course, behind the difference in treatment\nextended to us and to the Greeks.  The motive for making Coutlass sell\nhis mules and stay within the miserable confines of the rest-camp was\nto make sure he had money enough to feed himself, and to cut off all\nopportunity for swift escape.  Not for a second were the Germans\nsufficiently unwary to admit collusion with him.\n\nThe real ownership of the three mules was left in little doubt when\nthey were sold at public auction and bought in by Schillingschen.  Fred\nand Will attended the auction the day following our scene in court, and\nextracted a lot of amusement from bidding against Schillinschen,\ncompelling him finally to pay a good sum more than the mules were worth.\n\nCoutlass was in a strange predicament.  The looting of Brown's cattle\nhad been a bid for fortune on his own account.  Yet by causing us to\ngive chase he had brought us into the German net more handily than ever\nthey had hoped.  So it was reasonable on his part to suppose that if he\ncould betray us more completely still, he might get rewarded instead of\ntreated as a broken tool.\n\nYet he did not dare to approach our camp, for fear lest Fred should\ncarry out his threat and fight.  The fight would certainly be reported\nby the askari on watch at the crossroads, and that would destroy his\nchance of making believe to be in our confidence.  So he kept sending\nnotes to me when the others were absent, even the native boy who\nbrought them--not daring to enter our camp, but fastening the message\nto a stone and throwing it in through the tent door.\n\nThey were strange, illiterate messages, childishly conceived, varying\nbetween straight-out offers to help us escape and dark insinuations\nthat he knew of something it would pay us well to investigate.\n\nIt was an English missionary spending three days in Muanza on his way\nto Lake Tanganika, who came to see what he could do for my wound and\ncleared up the mystery quite a little by reporting what he had heard in\nthe non-commissioned mess, where he had been invited to eat a meal.\n\n\"The Greek,\" he said, \"is trying to curry favor by pretending he knows\nyour plans.  If he succeeds in worming into your confidence and\npersuading you to make plans to escape with him, they will feel\njustified in putting you in jail--and that, I understand, is where they\nwant you.\"\n\n\"Will you do me a favor?\" I asked.\n\nHe hesitated.  It was kindness that had sent him down to ease my pain,\nif possible, not anti-Germanism; it was part of German policy to pose\nas the friend of all missionaries, and if anything he was prejudiced\nagainst us--particularly against Brown, whom he had visited in jail,\nand who assured him the only hymn he ever sang was \"Beer, glorious\nbeer!\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he answered.\n\n\"We are quite sure any letters we write will be opened,\" I said.\n\nHe answered that he could hardly believe that.\n\n\"If we could send a letter unopened to British East it would solve our\nworst problem,\" I told him.  \"If you know of a dependable messenger who\nwould carry our letter, I would contribute fifty pounds out of my own\npocket to the funds of your mission.\"\n\nI made a mistake there, and realized it the next moment.\n\n\"What kind of letter is worth fifty pounds?\" he asked me.  \"Isn't it\nsomething illegal that you fear might get you into worse trouble if\nopened and read?\"\n\nI argued in vain, and only made my case worse by citing as an instance\nof German official turpitude the staff surgeon's neglect of me.\n\n\"But he tells me you refuse to be treated by him!\" he answered.  \"He\nsays you enter his hospital and are insolent if he happens to be too\nbusy to attend to you at once.  He says you refuse to let a native\norderly dress your wound!\"\n\nHe had been entertained to one meal at the commandant's house on the\nhill, and regaled by awful accounts of our ferocity.  I did not succeed\nin inserting as much as the thin end of a different view until he asked\nme how a man's name could be professor Schillingschen and his wife's\nLady Isobel Saffren Waldon.\n\n\"I don't understand about titles,\" he said. \"Shouldn't she take his\nname, or else he hers, or something?\"\n\nI assured him that marriage had never as much as entered the head of\neither of them.\n\n\"They're simply living together,\" I said. \"He's a cynical brute.  She's\na designing female!\"\n\nThe missionary mind recoiled and refused to believe me.  But after he\nhad thought the matter over and seen the probability, he swung over to\na sort of lame admission that a few more of my statements might perhaps\nbe true.\n\n\"I will take your letter and guarantee its delivery in British East,\nprovided I may read it and do not disapprove of its contents.\" he\nvolunteered.\n\n\"That's not unreasonable,\" I said, \"but the letter is in code.\"\n\n\"I should have to see it decoded.\"\n\nI told him to find Fred and Will.  He came on them sitting smoking\nunder the great rock near the waterfront that had been inset with a\nbronze medallion of Bismarck, and startled them almost into committing\nan assault on him, by saying that he wanted our secret code at once.\nThey had been trying to get tobacco to Brown, and sweetmeats to\nKazimoto, had failed in both efforts and were short-tempered. He\nexplained after they had insulted him sufficiently, and they walked\ndown to the camp one on either hand, apologizing all the way.  I\nimagine they had criticized missions of all denominations pretty\nthoroughly.\n\nIn the end he decided not to read the letter at all.\n\n\"I have reached the conclusion you three men are gentlemen,\" he said,\n\"and would not take advantage of me.  I will take your letter to Ujiji,\nand send it to the south end of Lake Tanganika, to be put in the\nBritish mail bag for Mombasa by way of Durban.  It will take a long\ntime to reach its destination--perhaps two months; but I will have it\nregistered, and it will undoubtedly get there.\"\n\nThat he kept his word and better we had ample proof later on, but I did\nnot bless him particularly fervidly at the time, for he went straight\nto the doctor and repeated my complaints.  He left for Ujiji the next\nday, and the net result of his friendly interference was that the\ndoctor refused me any sort of attention at all--even a change of\nbandages.\n\nFred and Will did their best for me, but it was little.  I read in\ntheir faces, and in their studied cheerfulness when speaking in my\npresence, that they had made up their minds I was going to lose the\nnumber of my mess.  They went to the commandant and the lieutenant\nbesides the doctor in efforts to secure for me some sort of\nconsideration, but without result; and they wrote at least six letters\nto the British East African Protectorate government that we ascertained\nafterward never reached their destination.  They tried to register one\nletter, but registration was refused.\n\n\"Why don't they jail us simply, and have done with it?\"--Will kept\nwondering aloud.\n\n\"They will when it suits their books,\" said I.  \"For the present they\nscarcely dare.  Word might reach the British government.  They're\nbreaking no international law by holding us here and keeping tabs on\nus.\"\n\nBefore many days I grew unable to leave the hard cork mattress on the\ncamp-bed in Fred's tent.  They went again to the commandant, this time\ndetermined to force the issue.\n\n\"I will send some one,\" he told them, and they came away delighted that\nstrong language should succeed where politeness formerly had failed.\n\nBut all the commandant did send was an askari twice a day, to lean on\nhis rifle in the tent door, leer at me, and march away again.\n\n\"He comes to see if I'm dead,\" said I.  \"It would be inconvenient to\nhave me die in jail; there might be inquiries afterward from British\nEast.  After I'm dead and buried they'll jail you two healthy ones, and\nkeep you until you 'blab'!\"\n\n\"Why don't we straight out tell 'em we don't know a thing about the\nivory?\" wondered Will.\n\n\"Because they wouldn't believe us!\" Fred answered.\n\nSeven days after the sentry's first call the doctor took to coming in\nperson to look at me.  He never except once stepped inside the tent,\nbut was satisfied to give me a glance of contempt and go away again,\nonce or twice taking pains to inspect the Greeks' camp before leaving.\nHe usually had Schubert trailing in his wake, and gave him stern orders\nabout sanitation which nobody ever carried out.  The sanitary\nconditions of that rest-camp were simply non-existent until we came\nthere, and we had gone to no pains on the Greeks' account.\n\nBut the Greeks did us an unexpected good turn, though it looked like\nmaking more trouble for us at the time.  They began to complain of lack\nof exercise, and to grow actually sick for want of it.  Because of\nthat, and jealousy, they raised a clamor about our freedom to go\nanywhere within township limits as against their strict confinement to\nthe camp.  The commandant came down to the camp in person to hear what\nthey had to say, and being in a good humor saw fit to yield a point.\nBeing a military German, though, he could not do it without attaching\nignominious conditions.\n\nThere was a band attached to the local company of Sudanese--an affair\nconsisting of four native war-drums and two fifes.  They knew eight\nbars of one tune, and were proud of it, the fifers blowing with beef\nand pluck and the drummers thundering native fashion, which means that\nthe only difference between their noise and a thunder-storm was in the\ntempo.\n\nDay after day, twice a day, whether it rained or shone, it seemed to be\nthe law that this \"band\" should patrol the whole township limits,\nplaying its only tune, lifting the tops of men's heads with its\ninfernal drumming, and delighting nobody except the players and the\ntownship urchins, who marched in its wake rejoicing.\n\nThe Greeks and the Goanese were given leave to march with the band\ntwice a day for the sake of exercise.  They refused indignantly.  The\ncommandant flew into the rage that is the birthright of all German\nofficials, but suddenly checked himself; he had a brilliant idea.\n\nHe withdrew the permission and changed it to an order that Coutlass and\nhis two friends should march with the band twice daily for the sake of\ntheir health, on pain of imprisonment should they refuse.\n\n\"And I will prove to you,\" he said, \"that the good German rule is\nimpartial.  All aliens awaiting trial and confined within the township\nlimits shall march with the band if they are able!\"  As an afterthought\nhe added magnanimously:  \"Those in the jail, too, provided they have\nnot been sentenced for serious crimes!\"\n\nSo Coutlass, his Greek friend, the Goanese, Fred, Will, and Brown of\nLumbwa marched about the town twice daily, at seven in the morning and\nthree in the afternoon, a journey of five miles, Fred and Will making\nno objection because it gave them a chance to talk with Brown.  There\nwere strict orders against talking, and four askaris armed with rifles\nmarched behind to enforce the rule as well as keep guard over Brown.\nBut the drums were so thunderous and the shrill fifes so lusty that the\naskaris could not hear conversation pitched in low tones.\n\n\"Brown says,\" said Fred, returning from the first march, \"that he\nsleeps with only a sheet of corrugated iron between him and the ward\nwhere the chain-gang lies.  He can talk with Kazimoto when he happens\nto be at that end of the chain.  They've nothing but planks to lie on,\nany of them.  He says Kazimoto seems determined to kill the lieutenant\nwho sentenced him, and as soon as he's off the chain we'd better grab\nhim and hurry him out of the country.\"\n\n\"Six months!\" said I. \"Splendid advice!  How many of us will be alive\nor at liberty six months from now? Not I, at any rate!\"\n\n\"How d'you suppose they discipline the chain-gang?\" Fred asked,\nignoring my growing hopelessness.\n\n\"With the lash,\" said I.  \"I've seen!\"\n\n\"That's by day,\" said Fred.  \"They've better ways at night.  One plan\nis no supper or breakfast; but the champion scheme is the doctor's.\nOn complaint by the askaris that a man on the chain has shirked his\nwork, or answered back, or been obstreperous, the doctor serves him out\na handful of strong pills and sees him swallow them.  They don't\nunchain them at night.  D'you get the idea?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Every time the man has to go outside he must wake the whole gang and\ntake them with him!  They're weary after working twelve hours at a\nstretch.  After the second or third time up they begin to object pretty\nstrenuously.  After the third or fourth time he's so unpopular that\nhe'd almost rather die than wake them.  Imagine the result, and what he\nsuffers!\"\n\nDespondency began to have hold of me, and I no longer wished to live.\nThe doctor's momentary daily visits increased my loathing for the crew\nwho tyrannized there in the name of Progress, and I could see no way of\nretaliating.  I became seized with a sort of delirious conviction that\nif only I could die and be out of the way my friends would be far\nbetter able to contrive without me.  There is no convalescence in a\nmood of that sort, and each morning found me nearer death than the\nlast.  Then malaria developed, to give me the finishing touch, and\nalthough strangely enough I grew less instead of more delirious, Fred\nand Will at last made no secret of their belief that I was doomed.\n\nI myself was as sure of death as they were of dinner, and had better\nappetite for my fate than they for the meal, when one morning the\ndoctor came earlier than usual.  He had Schubert with him, and they\nboth peered through the tent door.  I was alone, for Fred and Will were\nin the other tent.  The doctor stepped inside and examined me closely,\ndrawing up the mosquito net to see my face.  I did not trouble to speak\nto him, or even to open my eyes after the first glimpse.  He spoke to\nSchubert in German, let the net fall again, and went away.  Schubert\nspat and rubbed his hands, and swung along after him.\n\nThen I heard Will and Fred arguing.\n\n\"Don't be a fool!\"  That was Fred's voice.\n\n\"I tell you I'll tell him!\"\n\n\"Fine thing to tell a poor devil that's dying!  Let him die in peace!\"\n\n\"No.  He has guts, for I've seen him use 'em.  I shall tell him.  You\nwait here!\"\n\nBut they both came in, and sat one on either side of my bed.\n\n\"Did you hear what that doctor person said to the sergeant-major?\"\nasked Will.\n\n\"I don't talk his beastly language,\" I answered.\n\n\"He said you'll be dead by this evening!  He told Schubert to go and\nget the chain-gang and have them dig your grave at noon instead of\nlaying off for dinner.  He added they'll have you buried and out of the\nway by four or five o'clock.  Then Schubert asked him--\"\n\n\"No need to tell him that!\" Fred objected.  But Will was watching my\nface keenly, and went on.\n\n\"Schubert asked him who was to say whether you are dead or not.  What\nd'you suppose the answer was?\"\n\nFred objected again, but Will waved him aside.\n\n\"The answer he gave Schubert was:  'Once he is covered with two meters\nof earth, I shall not hesitate to sign a certificate!'--So now you know\nwhat to expect!\"\n\nWill smiled as he watched me.  His face was as keen and calm as Fred's\nwas troubled.\n\n\"Take more than his guesswork to put you where he'd like to have\nyou--eh?\" he laughed.  And I sat up.\n\nFred began to grin too.  \"You were right, Will!\" he admitted.\n\nIt was not anger that swept over me and gave me new strength.  Anger, I\nthink, would have hastened the end.  It was sudden recognition of my\nown superiority to the devils who knew so little mercy.  It was simple\ninability in the last recourse to admit myself able to be their victim.\nEven my leg felt better.  I demanded food; and by the time they\nreturned from their morning march around the township I had made my boy\ndress me and was sitting up.\n\nWe dated the turn of the tide of our fortunes from that hour.\nCertainly from that day we began to prosper--at first gradually, but\nafter a while in the old swift way that had made all our ventures with\nMonty such amazingly amusing work.\n\nWe saw the chain-gang--Kazimoto last, with a shovel over his\nshoulder--march away at noon to dig me a grave in the sand close to\nwhere they burned the township refuse.  Fred and Will went and watched\nthem a while, contriving to slip a paper of snuff into Kazimoto's hand\nwhile he rested and let the pick-men labor.  (Snuff to a Nyamwezi is as\ncomforting as an old sweet pipe to nine white men out of ten.)\n\nWhen Schubert came that evening at five with an old sack to put my body\nin, and plenty of askaris to help decide disputes, I was standing up.\nHe could not very well make even himself believe that a man who could\nspeak and walk was dead, but he could be immensely enraged by what he\nwas pleased to call my schweinspiel.* He cursed me in every language he\nknew, including several native ones, and ended by threatening to make\nsure of me before going to so much trouble a second time.  [*Literally,\npig-play.]\n\nWe enraged him still further by laughing at him, and Fred got out his\nconcertina that for many days past had lain idle.  The first few notes\nof it made me realize more than any other thing could have done what\ndepths of despondency we must have plumbed, for hitherto, for as long\nas I had known Fred, he had always been able with that weird instrument\nof his to rouse his own spirits and so stir the rest of us.  He resumed\nold habits now, and gloom departed.\n\nThat evening I went to bed like a new man, and for the first night for\nlong weeks slept until dawn, awaking hungry.  My leg began to mend.  We\nall saw the absurdity, if nothing else, of the treatment meted out to\nus, based on no better grounds than our supposed possession of a\nsecret.  Laughter brought good hope.  Hope gave us courage, and courage\nset Fred and Will hunting for a means of escape.  We decided there and\nthen that to wait for this Major Schunck to come from the coast and\npass judgment on us was a ridiculous waste of time as well as highly\ndangerous.\n\nThe first discovery Fred and Will made was that there were footholds\ncut in the great granite rock in which the Bismarck medallion was set.\nThey climbed it, and discovered that from the summit they could see all\nMuanza harbor from the shore line to the island in the distance.\nSitting up there, they presently spotted a native dhow drawn up with\nbow to the beach with the indefinable, yet unescapable air of rather\nlong disuse.\n\nResisting the first temptation to hurry along the shore and examine it,\nthey returned to camp to tell me of the find, and sent Simba,\nKazimoto's understudy, to find out whose the dhow was and why it lay\nthere.  They explained it was a fairly big dhow, and might be laid up\nthere on account of leakiness.\n\nBut Simba came back grinning with the news that the dhow belonged to an\nIndian from British East who had been jailed for smuggling.  The dhow\nhad been sold to pay his court fine, and was now owned by a Punjabi who\nhad bought it as a speculation and repented already of his bargain,\nbecause the Germans would grant him no license to use it and nobody\nelse would buy.\n\nThey went off again to have another distant view of it and to try and\ninvent some means of inspecting it closely without betraying their\npurpose.  I was already able to walk with the aid of a stick, although\nnot fast enough to keep up with them, and curiosity taking hold of me I\ncalled two of our servants to give me a supporting arm and limped off\nto see the grave the chain-gang had recently dug for me.\n\nIt was a struggle to get there, but it seemed to me the trip was worth\nit.  I found the grave about a foot too short, but otherwise\ncommensurate, and sat down on a stone beside it to consider a number of\nthings.  A convalescent man sitting beside his own grave may be\nforgiven for amusing himself with a lot of near-philosophy, and if I\ntrespassed over the borders of common sense on that occasion I claim it\nwas not without excuse.\n\nMy meditations were disturbed by the arrival on the scene of the very\nlast man I expected.  We had been told that Professor Schillingschen\nhad gone out on a journey, leaving his \"wife\" in the care of the\ncommandant; yet I looked up suddenly to see him standing on the other\nside of the grave with both hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers\nand a grin of malevolent amusement showing through the tangled mass of\nhair that hid his lower face.\n\n\"Yours?\" he asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"A close call!  I have seen closer!  I have stood so close to the brink\nof death that the width of an eyelash would have damned me!\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" I answered rudely.  \"How can the already damned be damned\nagain?\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"You are sick still.  You are petulant.  Never mind.  I was coming to\ncall on you.  I watched you leave the camp from the top of that hill\nbehind you, and followed.  It is better.  We can talk here without\nbeing overheard.  Send those natives away!\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" I answered, but I reckoned without the professor and\nthe fear his hairy presence instilled in them.\n\n\"Go!\" he said simply in the native tongue; and although I ordered them\nat once to stay by me they ran back to the camp as fast as their legs\ncould carry them.\n\n\"How do you feel now?\" the professor asked.\n\nI stared at him, wondering just what he meant.\n\n\"I mean, without a pistol!\"\n\nI saw the point.  The rest-camp was not far away, but as far as I could\njudge we were quite out of sight from it, and unless there should\nhappen to be some one hiding among the rocks at the foot of the hill\nbehind me we were quite alone, unless, as was probable, he had placed\none or two of his own hangers-on in hiding within call.\n\n\"This grave should be a lesson to you!\" he grinned.\n\n\"It has been,\" I answered.\n\n\"An illustration,\" he suggested.\n\n\"A period,\" said I.\n\n\"To your youth?\" he asked maliciously.  \"To the age of folly?\"\n\n\"To the time,\" I said, \"when any man could blackmail me.  I would go\ninto that grave ten times rather than tell you what you want to know!\"\n\n\"There are worse places than the grave!\" he said, beginning to leer\nsavagely.  His eyes glittered.  He could scarcely find patience for\nargument.  The thin veneer of his first mock-friendliness was gone\nutterly.\n\n\"I imagine that German colonial life is far worse than death,\" said I.\n\n\"German will be the only rule in Africa,\" he answered.  \"You fools of\nEnglish have set your hopes on the Christian missionary.  No\nweaker-backed camel could exist!  The German Michael is wiser!  Islam\nis the key to the native mind--Islam and the lash--they understand\nthat!  In a few years there will be nothing in Africa that is not\nGerman from core to epidermis!  As to whether you shall live to see\nthat day or not depends on yourself, my young friend!\"\n\nBeing quite sure that he had a plan in mind that nothing would prevent\nhim from unfolding, I did not waste effort or words on prompting him,\nbut sat still.  My silence and apparent lack of curiosity disturbed\nhim; there is nothing your bully likes better than to force his victim\ninto a war of words.\n\n\"I will be short and blunt with you!\" he began again.  \"I know your\nhistory!  You were in Portuguese Africa with Lord Montdidier.  There he\ncame in possession of the secret of Tippoo Tib's ivory; how, I do not\nyet know, but you shall tell me that presently!  You and your friends\ncame with him to Zanzibar, where you made certain inquiries--sufficient\nto set the Sultan of Zanzibar by the ears.  You left Zanzibar for\nMombasa, and for some reason that you shall also tell me presently,\nLord Montdidier did not leave the ship at Mombasa but continued the\nvoyage toward London.  Certain individuals decided that it would be\nbetter not to permit Lord Montdidier to reach Europe alive.  There were\nagents charged with the duty of attending to that.  It was considered\nsafest to throw him overboard into the Mediterranean; men were ordered\nby cable to board the ship at Suez.  Yet when the ship reached Suez\nnobody knew anything about him!  Tell me where he left the ship, and\nwhy!\"\n\nHe glared with eyes accustomed to extorting facts from savages,\ndepending on physical weakness so to undermine my will that I would\ngive my secret away, perhaps without knowing it.\n\nI lowered my eyes, not being minded to match the strength of my\neye-muscles against his.  The news that Monty had not reached Suez as a\nmatter of fact made me feel physically sick.  If it were true, it meant\nmost likely that he had been the victim of foul play, for that steamer\nwas not scheduled to stop anywhere before reaching the Suez Canal.  As\nfor the people on the ship knowing nothing about him they no doubt\npreferred not to talk to strangers.  That sort of news is easily kept\nunder cover for a while.  Schillingschen grew angry at my silence, and\nchanged his tactics.\n\n\"Where did he leave the ship?\" he shouted--suddenly--savagely.\n\nI did not answer.  He came round to my side of the grave, and laid a\nheavy clenched fist on my shoulder.  It seemed to weigh like lead in\nthe weak condition I was in.\n\n\"You shall tell me what Lord Montdidier is doing now, or that grave\nshall resemble in your imagination a bed of roses!\"\n\nHe seized my neck in a grasp like iron, and squeezed it.  I rose\nsuddenly and struck him in the stomach with my elbow.  Strength had\nreturned more swiftly than I had guessed, or perhaps it was indignation\nat the touch of his fingers.  At any rate he staggered clear of me, and\nI thought he would assault me now in real earnest; but perhaps he\nsuspected me of having weapons concealed somewhere.  Instead of rushing\nat me like an angry bull he calmed himself and laughed.\n\n\"You are strong for a man they thought of burying!\"' he said.  \"Never\nmind!  You shall see reason presently!  It is well understood that you\nand your friends know where Tippoo Tib's ivory is hidden.  You imagine\nyou can keep the secret.  If you keep it, you shall never make use of\nit, my young friend!  If you choose to tell, you shall be suitably\nrewarded!  Come now--I thought you were going to look for it down in\nthese parts.  I admit you fooled me.  You simply made a false move to\ndraw attention off from Lord Montdidier.  Tell me where he is and what\nhe does--and--or--\"\n\n\"And what?  Or what?\"  I demanded, as insolently as I knew how.  I saw\nno sense in answering him gently.\n\n\"I will show you!\"\n\nI had begun to feel weak again, but he offered me an arm, and since he\nseemed in no hurry I was able to struggle along beside him.  We took to\nthe main road and when we reached the D.O.A.G. he called for a hammock\nand some porters.  Being carried in that way was sheer luxury after the\nwalk in my weak state, and I lay back feeling like a tripper on\nvacation.  I saw Fred and Will climbing down from their observation\npost on top of the Bismarck monument, but he did not notice them.\n\nEvery German sergeant, and every askari we passed saluted us with about\ntwice as much respect as I had ever seen them show the commandant; and\nSchillingschen returned salutes much less carefully than he, merely by\na curt nod, or one raised finger.  Apparently the military feared him,\nfor when we passed the commandant, who was personally superintending\nthe flogging of two natives in the market-place for not saluting\nhimself, he took several paces forward to make sure Schillingschen\nshould see his act of homage.  The professor merely nodded in return,\nand I began to I wonder whether there was a rift in the lute of\nMuanza's official good relations.  Surely I hoped so.  Anything\ncalculated to set the Germans' garrison life at odds looked to me like\nthe gift of heaven!\n\nSchillingschen, striding beside the hammock, directed our course along\nthe shore-front under palm-trees, planted in stately rows with\nmeticulous precision.  He kept far enough to one side to avoid the\ncharge of being seen walking with me, but from time to time tossed me\nremarks calculated to keep my nerves on edge.\n\n\"What I shall show you is by way of warning!\" was a remark he repeated\ntwo or three times.  Then:  \"A native can always be made to talk by\nflogging him.  Some white men need sterner measures!\"\n\nWe left the commandant's house on the hill far behind and followed the\ncurve of the lake shore, toward a rocky promontory with a clump of\nthick jungle behind it.  Fear began to get its work in, until the\nthought came that what he most desired was to make me afraid; then I\nmanaged to summon sufficient contempt for him and his tribe to regain\nmy nerve and once more almost enjoy the promenade.\n\nHe halted the hammock bearers at a spot about three hundred yards away\nfrom the promontory and, leaving them standing there, turned inland\nwith a hand on my arm to give me support and direction.  We followed a\npath that was fairly well marked out and trodden, but rough, and\nseveral times I should have fallen but for his help.  My legs still\nrefused any sort of strenuous duty.\n\n\"The staff surgeon at this station is a man of ideas,\" he announced as\nwe rounded a big rock and passed down a narrow glade in the jungle.\n\"He is original.  He is not like some of our official fools.  He\nstudies.\"\n\nI refused to seem curious, and walked beside him in silence.\n\n\"He studies sleeping sickness.  If he can find the key to the solution\nof that scourge it will mean promotion for him.  He has noticed that\nthe sleeping sickness is always at its worst beside the lake, and\nputting two and two together like a sensible man has reached the\nconclusion that the disease may be propagated in some way in the blood\nof these things.\"\n\nWe emerged into a clearing in which a pool more than a hundred yards\nlong and nearly as many wide was formed naturally by a hollow in the\nsurface of a great sheet of granite.  The pool was fed by a trickle of\nwater from a jumble of rocks at one end.  At the other end the bottom\nof the pond sloped upward gradually, so that a ramp of smooth rock was\nformed, emerging out of shallow water.  A stone wall had been built\nabout three feet high to enclose that end of the pond, and all the way\nalong both sides the granite had been broken and chipped until the\nedges were sheer and unclimbable.\n\n\"Look!\" he said, pointing.\n\nI looked and grew sick.  On the ramp, half in the water and half out\nlay about a hundred crocodiles basking in the sun, their yellow eyes\nall open.  They were aware of us, for they began to move slowly higher\nout of water as if they expected something.\n\n\"You see that post?\" asked Schillingschen.\n\nThe stump of a dead tree that he referred to stood up nearly straight\nout of a crack in the rock, and a few yards above water level.  The\ncrocodiles all lay nose toward it, some of them twelve or fourteen feet\nlong, some smaller, and some very small indeed, all interested to\ndistraction in the dead tree-trunk.\n\n\"That is where he feeds them,\" Schillingschen announced.  \"He has\ntested them for hearing, smell, and eyesight.  By making fast a living\nanimal to that post be has been able to convince himself that from\nabout nine in the morning until five in the afternoon their senses are\nlimited.  Only occasionally do they come and take the bait between\nthose hours.  They are hungriest in the early morning just before\ndaylight.  Recently a large ape tied to the post at midday was not\nkilled and eaten until four next morning, and that is about the usual\nthing, although not the rule.  Now my proposal is--\"\n\nHe stepped back and eyed me with the coldest look of appraisal I ever\nsickened under.  I blenched at last--visibly suffered under his eye,\nand he liked it.\n\n\"--that you tell your secret or be fastened to that post from noon,\nsay, until the crocodiles make an end of you!\"\n\nHe stepped back a pace farther, perhaps to gloat over my discomfort,\nperhaps from fear of some concealed weapon.\n\n\"You have not much time to arrive at your decision!\"\n\nHe took another pace backward.  It occurred to me then that he was\nlooking for some one he expected.  Nobody turning up, he began to\ngather loose stones and throw them at the reptiles, driving them down\ninto deep water, first in ones and twos and then by dozens.  Most of\nthem swam away to the far side of the pool, and hid themselves where it\nwas deep.\n\nThen, panting with having run, there came a native who looked like a\nZulu, for he had enormous thighs and the straight up and down carriage,\nas well as facial characteristics.\n\n\"You are late!\" shouted Schillingschen in German \"Warum?  What d'ye\nmean by it?\"\n\nThe man opened his mouth wide and made grimaces.  He had no tongue.\nSchillingschen laughed.\n\n\"This is a servant who does no tattling in the market-place!\" he said,\nturning again toward me.  \"He and I can tie you to that post easily.\nWhat do you say?\"\n\nThere was nothing whatever to say, or to do except wonder how to\ncircumvent him, and nothing in sight that could possibly turn into a\nfriend--except a little tuft of faded brown that out of the corner of\nmy eye I detected zigzagging toward me in the direction from which we\nhad come.  A moment later I knew it really was a friend.  \"Crinkle,\" a\nmongrel dog that Fred had adopted the day after our arrival, breasted\nthe low rise, saw me, gave a yelp of delight and came scampering.\n\nThe dog sniffed my knee to make sure of me, and then trotted over to\nsniff Schillingschen.  The professor stooped down to pat him, rubbed\nhis ear a moment to get the dog's confidence, and then seized him\nsuddenly by both hind legs.  I saw what he intended too late.\n\n\"Stop, or I'll kill you!\" I shouted, and made a rush at him.  But he\nswung the yelping dog and hurled him far out into the pool.\n\nA second later my fist crashed into his face and he staggered backward.\nA second later yet the dumb Zulu pinned my elbows from behind and set\nhis knee into the small of my back with such terrific force that I\nyelled with pain.  Then Schillingschen approached me and began to try\nto drive my teeth in with unaccustomed fists.  He loosened my front\nteeth, but cut his own knuckles, so began looking about for a stick.\n\nStrangely enough my own attention was less fixed on Schillingschen than\non the wretched \"Crinkle\" swimming frantically for shore.  Dog-like he\nwas making straight for me, and there was no possibility whatever of\nhis being able to scramble up the steep side.  I shouted to call his\nattention, and tried to motion to him to swim toward shallow water, but\nthe Zulu would not let my arms free, and the dog only thought I was\nurging him to hurry.\n\nSchillingschen found a stick and came back to give me a hammering with\nit just at the moment when a crocodile saw \"Crinkle.\"  A blow landed on\nmy head, cut my forehead, and sent the blood down into my eyes at the\nsame moment that  I heard the dog's yelp of agony; and next time I\nlooked at the pond there was a tiny whirlpool on the surface, slightly\ntinged with red.\n\n\"You swine!\" I shouted at Schillingschen, trying to break loose and\nattack him.  For answer he raised his cudgel in both hands and stood on\ntiptoe to get leverage.  If that blow had landed it must have broken\nsomething, for he was strong as a gorilla; but somebody shouted--I\nrecognized Fred's voice, and in another second he and Will charged down\non us.  Schillingschen turned about to strike Fred instead of me, but\nWill's fist hit him on the ear and split it.  The professor staggered\nbackward, and a moment later Fred had felled the Zulu.  I reeled from\nweakness and excitement, and nearly fell down.\n\n\"Throw him to the crocks, you men!\" I urged madly.  \"He threw Crinkle\nin.  Throw him!  Nobody'll ever know!  He'd have dared throw me in!\nNobody comes here!  Throw him in and trust the crocks to leave no\ntrace!\"\n\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" growled Fred.\n\n\"Did you see him throw that dog in?\" I retorted.\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"but I saw him strike you.  That's enough!  I'll\ndeal with him!\"\n\nI suppose Fred intended to knock the professor down and belabor him\nwith the same stick he had used on me, but the plan died stillborn.\nSchillingschen bethought him of his hip-pocket, produced a repeating\npistol, and leveled it.\n\n\"Any nonsense, and I shoot you all!\" he announced.\n\nThat ended the battle as far as we were concerned.  We had no firearms.\nSchillingschen wasted no time on explanations, but beckoned his Zulu\nand walked off, striding at a great pace and only looking back over his\nshoulder once or twice to make sure we were not in pursuit.\n\nFred and Will lent me an arm apiece and we followed slowly, I\nrecounting as fast as I could all that had happened, and they trying to\nchaff me back into a sensible frame of mind.\n\n\"That was a decent dog!\" I insisted.  \"He slept on my bed those nights\nwhen I had fever!\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Fred answered.  \"Will and I lay and scratched, while you\nrested, with proper flea-food for protection!  Don't worry, we'll find\nyou another dog!\"\n\nSchillingschen's consideration for my wound had vanished with the\nchance of making use of me.  As we emerged into the open we saw him in\nthe distance lolling in the hammock he had brought me in.\n\n\"Never mind!\" grinned Will.  \"I'll bet the brute has an earache!\"\n\n\"And teeth-ache!\" added Fred.\n\n\"And I'll bet he has gone to prepare us a hot reception!\" said I.  \"He\nowns this town!\"\n\nBut nothing happened immediately on our return into the town.  Actually\nFred and Will had been outside township limits and could be arrested;\nsuspecting foul play as soon as they saw me with Schillingschen, they\nhad followed at once.  They were as mystified as I when no swift\nvengeance lit on them.  We saw Schillingschen carried in the hammock up\nthe steep path leading to the commandant's house; but no one came down\nagain.  After we got back to camp we spent all the rest of the day\nwaiting for the vengeance we felt sure was overdue, but none came.\nToward evening we even began to grow hopeful again and to talk about\nthe dhow.  Fred and Will had examined it through field-glasses from the\ntop of the rock, and were optimistic 'regarding its size and general\ncondition.\n\n\"Even if it leaks rather badly,\" said Will, \"we could reach some\nisland, and beach it there, and caulk it.\"\n\n\"How about that launch, that brought the professor and Lady Saffren\nWaldon?\" I asked.\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"Couldn't they follow us with that?\"\n\n\"You bet they could!\" said Will.        \"We've either got to spike the\nlaunch's boilers, or give them the complete slip on a dark night!\"\n\n\"We might steal the launch!\" suggested Fred, but that was too wild a\nproposal to be taken seriously.  The launch was the apple of the German\ngovernmental eye, and the engine crew slept on it always.\n\nThe prospect was unpromising as ever, yet I went to bed and listened to\nthe strains of Fred's concertina in the next tent with less foreboding\nthan at any time since reaching Muanza, and fell asleep to the tune of\nSilver Hairs among the Gold, a melancholy piece that Will liked to sing\nwhen hope or courage stirred him.\n\nI was awakened near midnight of a moonless black night by a hand on my\nbedclothes and the light of a lantern in my eyes.\n\n\"Hus-s-s-h!\" said some one. \"Don't speak yet!  Listen!\"\n\nIt was a woman's voice, and it puzzled me indescribably, for a sick\nman's wits don't work swiftly as a rule when he lies between sleeping\nand waking.\n\n\"Listen!\" said the voice again.  \"I must come to terms with you three\nmen!  You are the only hope left me!  I have no friends in Muanza--and\nnone whom I trust!  Those Greeks and that Goanese would sell me to the\nfirst bidder, and these Germans are worse than dogs!\"\n\n\"But who are you?\" I asked stupidly.\n\nFor answer she held the lantern so that I could see her face.  Her hand\ntrembled, and the unsteady light threw baffling shadows, but even so I\ncould see she looked drawn and aged.\n\n\"Where is your maid, then, Lady Waldon?\" I asked, for it seemed to me\nthat was one friend who had served her through thick and thin.\n\n\"Ask the commandant!\" she answered.  \"The poor fool thinks he will\nmarry her!  Little she knows of the German method!  I am alone!  I have\nnot even a servant any longer!  I have walked through the shadows from\nthe commandant's house, only lighting this lantern after I was inside\nthe hedge.  Nobody knows I am here.  One watchman was asleep; the\nothers did not see me.  All you need fear is those Greeks.  As long as\nthey don't suspect I am here we can talk safely.\"\n\nI tumbled out of bed on the far side, and went to waken the other two.\nAfter a hurried consultation we decided my tent was the best for the\ninterview, because of the light that had burned in it nearly always\nwhile I was so deathly ill.  We wrapped ourselves in blankets, and Fred\nwent and shook Simba awake.\n\n\"Watch those Greeks!\" he ordered him.  \"If they show signs of life,\ncome and give the alarm!\"\n\nThen we set Lady Waldon's lantern on the ground in the back of my tent,\nclosed the tent up, and foregathered.  There was one chair.  We three\nsat on the bed.\n\n\"Before we begin,\" said Fred, \"we'd like some kind of proof, Lady\nWaldon, that your overture is honest!  I've no need to labor the point.\nUntil now you have been our implacable enemy.  Why should we believe\nyou are our friend to-night?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I don't expect friendship,\" she answered.  \"You and I are\nin deep water, and must find a straw that may float us all!  If I can\nhelp you to escape out of the country I will.  If you can help me, you\nmust!  If you don't escape there are worse things in store for you than\nyou imagine!  If you tell your secret now, they intend to prevent your\ntelling it to any one else afterward!  And unless you tell they intend\nto take terrible steps to compel you!  As for me--they have discovered\nthat after all I know nothing, and am of no further use to them!  They\nhave not said so, but it is very clear to me how the land lies.\nProfessor Schillingschen is drunk to-night; he came home with his car\nand mouth bleeding,  and has plied the whisky bottle freely ever since\nuntil he fell asleep an hour and a half ago.  He boasted over his cups.\nThey are simply using this long wait for Major Schunk, who is supposed\nto be coming from the coast, to gather additional evidence against you.\nThey have men out following your trail back by the way you came, and\nif they can find no genuine evidence they will invent what they need;\nthe purpose is to get you legally behind the bars; and if you ever\ncome out again alive that would not be their fault!\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"Escape!\" she answered excitedly.  Then another thought made her clench\nher fists.  \"Is it possible you told Professor Schillingschen your\nsecret to-day?  Did one of you tell him?  Is that why he is drunk?\"\n\nShe saw by our faces that that fear was groundless, but a greater one,\nthat she might not be able to convince us, seized her next and she made\nsuch an excited gesture that the shawl she wore over her head and\nshoulders fell away and her long hair came tumbling down like a witch's.\n\n\"Listen!  There is nothing that you men from your point of view\ncould say too bad about me!  I know!  I have been in the pay of Germany\nfor many years, but what you don't know is how they got me in the toils\nand kept me in, dragging me down from one degradation to another!  They\nhave dragged me down so far at last that I am not much more use to\nthem.  If we were in British territory they would simply expose me to\nthe British government and save themselves the trouble of ending my\ncareer.  They did that to Mrs. Winstin Willoughby, and Lord James Rait,\nand fifty others; it was so easy to put incriminating evidence against\nthem in the hands of the public prosecutor.  Lord James Rait died in\nDartmoor Prison--a common felon.  I shall not!  But believe me--I am\ncertain as I sit here that they only wait for my return to British\nEast!  To have me murdered here might start inconvenient rumors that\nwould lead to unanswerable questions!  It was proposed to me to-day\nthat I should return to British East on the launch!\"\n\n\"Then why talk about escaping?\" Fred wondered.  \"Why not go?\"\n\n\"Because,\" she hissed emphatically, \"don't you see, you stupid!--if\nthey send me back it will be to my doom!  My one chance is to escape\nfrom their clutches--get into touch with British officials--and save\nthe situation by telling my own tale first!\"\n\nFred was in no hurry to be convinced.  I was already for accepting her\nstory and helping her out; but that was perhaps because I was a sick\nman, too recently recovered from the gates of death to care to be hard\non any one.\n\n\"I still don't see your danger,\" Fred told her.  \"In all my life I fail\nto recall a single instance of the British courts passing a severe\nsentence on a spy.  If you'll excuse my saying so, your story about\nLord James Rait is incorrect.  I recall the case well.  He got a\ntwenty-year sentence for forgery.\"\n\n\"True!\" she answered.  \"And Mrs. Winstin Willoughby was sentenced to\nfifteen years for theft!  Lord James did forge--in the way of business\nfor the German government!  Jane Winstin Willoughby did steal--for the\nsame blackguard masters!  Do you think they will expose me as a spy?\nThat would be too clumsy, even for such bullies as they are!  Do you\nsuppose they could have dragged me down to this without some sword held\nover me?  They can prove that I committed a crime in England several\nyears ago.  Oh, yes, I am a criminal!  I raised a check.  It was a\ncheck on a German bank, given to me by a German on behalf of a\ncountryman of his.  I needed money desperately, and the man who brought\nthe check to me suggested I should raise it!  Since then I have tried\nto repay that money with interest a dozen times, but they have always\nlaughed and told me they preferred to leave matters as they are.\"\n\n\"What would be the use of returning to British territory, then?\" asked\nFred.  \"If they hold that over you, they can denounce you at any time.\"\n\n\"Not they!\" she answered.  \"Not if I get there first!  I know too much!\nI can tell too much!  I can prove too much!  If I were once arrested\non the charge of raising that check, no government in the world would\nlisten to me.  But if I can tell my story first, and confess about the\ncheck, and explain why the charge is likely to be brought against me,\nthen there will be Downing Street officials who know how to whisper to\nthe German Embassy words that will frighten them into silence!  I can\nprove too much against the German government, if only I can tell my\ntale before they crush me!\"\n\n\"Why not write it?\" asked Fred, and it seemed to me there was humor in\nhis eye, but she only detected stubbornness, and laughed scornfully.\n\n\"My own maid even gave them the letters written to me by my sister!  If\nI should be suspected of writing they would never rest until they had\nthe letter!\"\n\n\"Give me your letter to mail!\" suggested Fred maliciously.\n\n\"Deluded man!\" she sneered. \"All the letters you have written since you\ncame to Muanza lie in a drawer in the commandant's desk!  I myself have\nread them!\"\n\nIn the dark, with shifting shadows thrown by the cheap trade lantern,\nit was difficult to judge what was going on behind that beard of\nFred's.  I had begun to suspect he was coming over to my way of\nthinking and would yield to her presently, but he returned to the\nattack--very directly and abruptly.\n\n\"What is it you know against the German government?\" he demanded, and\nsat with his jaw in the palm of his hand waiting for her answer.\n\n\"Why should I tell you?  Why should I put myself completely in your\npower?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Fred.\n\n\"What would prevent you from stealing my thunder, and telling my story\nas your own--leaving me at the Germans' mercy?\"\n\n\"Something very potent that I think you would not understand if I\ntalked of it,\" Fred answered.  \"Listen to me now a minute.  I haven't\nconferred with my friends here, as you know.  Whatever I tell you is\nsubject to their agreeing with me.  The only condition on which I, for\none, would consent to taking part with you in anything--after all our\nexperience of you!--would be that you should put yourself so completely\nin our power that we could feel we had your safekeeping.  On those\nterms I would be willing to do my best to help you out.\"\n\n\"I agree to that like a shot!\" said Will; and I nodded.\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"All or nothing!\" Fred insisted.\n\n\"You mean that you also, just like these Germans, must have a sword to\nhold over me?\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't understand!\" Fred answered.  \"What we demand,\nLady Saffren Walden, is proof that you really do give us your\nconfidence.  Without that we have nothing to say to you, and nothing to\ndo with you!\"\n\nShe broke down then and cried a little, tearing herself with sobs she\nhated to release.  Suddenly she raised her head and glared at us\nwildly, dry-eyed; not a tear had accompanied the sobbing.\n\n\"If I tell you--if you fail me after that--I shall kill myself in such\nway that you shall know--my blood is on your heads!\"\n\nFred laughed.  It was no doubt the best thing to do, but I wondered how\nhe managed it.\n\n\"Suppose you begin by telling us,\" he said.  \"We can discuss the\nblood-stains afterward!\"\n\nThen she suddenly burst into her tale, as if she had rehearsed it a\nhundred times in readiness to pour into the ears of the first British\nofficial who had power enough to shield her.  She told it dramatically,\nin few words, wasting no breath on side-issues, and without once\npausing to explain, letting her words smash down the barriers of\nunbelief and pave their own way for explanations afterward.\n\n\"Germany is planning to conquer the world!--not now, but ten or a dozen\nyears from now!  She is getting ready ceaselessly!  Part of the plan is\nto undermine British rule in Africa by means of a religious influence\namong the natives.  That is the special duty of Professor\nSchillinschen.  As soon as possible a great native army is to be\ntrained, and thoroughly schooled in the fanatical precepts of Islam.\nBut the German people are too heavily taxed already, and refuse to vote\nmoney for this miserable colony, where the great beginning must be made\nbecause it is only here that they can work unsuspected.  So funds must\nbe found in some other way!\"\n\nShe paused for breath.  No woman pleading at the bar of justice could\nhave seemed more in earnest.  Of one thing I was quite sure:  she had\nfound it worth her while to convince us if that were possible.  She was\nplaying no half-hearted game.\n\n\"Do you begin to see now why the Germans are so set on finding Tippoo\nTib's hoard of ivory?  Do you begin to understand why they are\ndetermined, not only to prevent your finding it, but to learn your\nsecret?  If rumor is one-half true, the Arab buried somewhere enough\nivory to finance this plan of theirs!  They have been going about the\nsearch systematically, and sooner or later they feel they must stumble\non it.  They will not let you forestall them!\"\n\nShe paused again.  Her very earnestness exhausted her more than the\nwalk through the dark in danger had done.\n\n\"Take your time,\" Fred advised her.  \"We're all listening!\"\n\n\"When I told you in Nairobi that Lord Montdidier had been murdered, I\nbelieved I was so near the truth that you would never know the\ndifference.  I knew the order had been given to have him killed on\nboard ship--given by men who are accustomed to be obeyed--who do not\nexcuse failure on any ground.  They feared he might be going to divulge\nthe secret of the ivory to his government in London.  Oh, I tell you\nthey stop at nothing!  To-day London is the ivory market of the world,\nbut they have their arrangements made for transferring that center of\ntrade to Hamburg!  They mean first to crush competitors, and then\nmonopolize!  They hope the ivory is in this country.  In that case\ntheir task will be easy.  But if it should be found in British East,\nthey are all ready with the necessary men of influence to apply for a\nmining or agricultural concession, and they will fence that place off\nso thoroughly that no one will ever be the wiser until they have\ncarried the ivory out of the country!\"\n\n\"They could never get it out of British East without the government\nknowing,\" objected Fred; but she laughed at him.\n\n\"If worse came to the worst, they are ready with an offer to exchange\nten times the territory elsewhere for just that small section of the\ncountry.  They would give up German New Guinea, or Southwest\nAfrica--anything!  They have fooled the French and Russian governments\nuntil they are ready to bring pressure to bear on England\ndiplomatically to induce her to make almost any bargain of that kind\nthat the Germans want.  They are even willing to concede to England the\nwhole of Abyssinia, which nobody owns yet, and to back her up against\nthe claims of France and Italy!  Why should they not be willing to make\ntemporary concessions, when all Africa is to be theirs in ten years'\ntime!  They will give to-day, and with the help of the money that ivory\nwill bring they will create an army that shall take away to-morrow!\"\n\n\"But how can you prove all this?\" Fred asked her.\n\n\"How?  I know the names of the men who are preaching Germany's sermons\nall through British East!  I know all Schillingschen's secrets!  Why\nshould I not?  I have suffered enough!  He is a drunken brute nearly\nalways after the sun goes down, and his caresses are disgusting; I\nhave endured them until I know all he knows!  Now he realizes that I\nknow his secrets and have none of my own to tell, so he hopes to send\nme to my doom at the hands of the government I have betrayed too many\ntimes!  What is the use of my pretending to be better than I am?  I am\na spy--a traitress--a divorced woman with worse than no reputation!  I\nam not a person likely to be shown much mercy!  I never would have\nrecanted unless the end of my rope had come!  Now I know I must buy my\npardon--I must earn it--I must pay for it with solid value!  Luckily I\ncan do that!  I do not ask you men for mercy.  I know what is in store\nfor you if you do not escape!  I offer to help you to escape, in\nexchange for helping me!\"\n\n\"Better be more precise!\" suggested Fred.  \"Exactly what is in store\nfor us?\"\n\nShe pointed her finger at me.  \"You went out of bounds to-day with\nSchillingschen!  Well and good; he was with you.  But you, and you--\"\nShe pointed at Fred and Will.  \"--went without permission.  Why do you\nsuppose they over-looked such a splendid chance of jailing you legally?\nSchillingschen came up to the commandant's house in a towering\npassion, demanding the immediate arrest and close confinement of all\nthree of you.  He was only persuaded to wait a few days longer because\na runner has come in with word that the bodies of several Masai whom\nyou shot on this side of the German border have been found!  The\nbones--the bullets found among the bones--and cartridge cases that will\nfit your rifles are being brought to Muanza!  After that--the deluge,\nmy friends!  That is why Professor Schillingschen gets drunk and sings\nhimself to sleep in spite of your being still at liberty!     Either\nescape before that evidence reaches Muanza, or make up your minds for\nthe worst!  It is growing late--answer me--do you agree?\"\n\nFred glanced once at each of us.  We both nodded.\n\n\"We agree with reservations,\" he said.\n\n\"What are they?  Man--don't be a fool!  Don't fritter the lives of all\nof us away!\"\n\n\"They're simple.  We've a friend in the jail here.  His name's Brown.\"\n\n\"That drunkard?  Leave him!  He's worthless!\"\n\n\"We've a servant on the chain-gang.  His name is Kazimoto.\"\n\n\"A nigger?  You'd risk another day in this place for a nigger?  How\nabsurd!  They're never grateful.  They don't see things from the white\nman's standpoint.  They don't expect ideal treatment.  Leave him his\nwages and tell him to follow when they let him off the chain!\"\n\n\"And we have a string of porters,\" Fred continued.  \"We will not leave\nMuanza without the porters, our man Kazimoto, and Mr. Brown of Lumbwa!\"\n\n\"You are mad!  You are crazy!\"\n\n\"We are the men you have invited to trust you,\"  Fred answered kindly.\n\"Those are our conditions.  We will not 'bate one iota!  Take\n'em or leave 'em, Lady Waldon!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n\nIN HOC SIGNO VADE\n\n  Lean, loveless, hungry lanes are these!\n        The longest has an end.\n  Ill luck tasted to the bitter lees\n        Soonest shall mend.\n  From out the foe's ranks if Heaven please\n        Shall come your friend.\n\n\nWe came to no fixed decision that night, although we knew there was no\nalternative.  She held out, in the vain hope of making us agree to\nleave Kazimoto and Brown behind.  The porters, she agreed, might come\nin very handy, although it was at least doubtful that we should be able\nto slip out of Muanza by land.  The Germans had taken latterly to\ncounting our porters every morning, to supplying them with ration money\nonce every day, and to sending the bill to us by an askari, who waited\nfor the cash.  At any rate, she conceded the porters, provided we would\nleave the two others behind.  And of course we were adamant.\n\nShe left us an hour and a half before dawn, we letting her return alone\nbecause of the greater danger of detection if we had tried to escort\nher.  It was after she had gone, while we sat listening for the sound\nof a challenge that would have ruined all her hopes, if not ours, that\nWill conceived the bright idea which finally saved us.\n\n\"The Heinies don't know that we're wise to their game,\" he said\ncheerfully.  His ears were sticking out from his head and he had the\nnaughty boy look that always presaged wisdom.  \"Why don't we play that\ncard for all it's worth?\"\n\n\"We need five cards to make even a poker hand,\" Fred objected.\n\n\"Will a full house suit you--aces and queens?\" he answered.  \"I've\nnamed you one ace already.  Ace number two is the fact that these\nGerman officials are brutes pure and simple--brutes who don't\nunderstand how to be anything else, with brutal low cunning and no\nother cleverness.\"\n\n\"That sounds like the joker!\" said Fred.\n\n\"It's ace number two,  I tell you!  The third is the fact that Brown of\nLumbwa can talk with Kazimoto in the night through that corrugated iron\npartition!  Three aces--count 'em--one, two, three!  Queens?  One of\n'em left a few minutes ago!  The other's the dhow!  We'll call that\nblessed boat the Queen of Sheba for luck!  The Queen of Sheba got to\nher journey's end, and found more than she expected, and by the lights\nof little old Broadway, so shall we!  I've dealt the cards--is it up to\nme to play them?\"\n\n\"Your hand, America!  Talk it over first, though!  There's an awful lot\nhangs on the game!\" said Fred.\n\nI fell asleep while they argued over the points of Will's strategy.\nAfrica is a land of sudden death and swift recoveries, but for a\nconvalescent man I had been through a strenuous day and had right to be\ntired out.  It was broad daylight when I awoke, and breakfast was\nready.  Fred and Will had returned from their march around the township\nwith the native band, and to my surprise the commandant was standing in\nfront of their tent, talking with them.  I threw on a jacket and joined\nthem at table.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said the commandant.  \"Either talk German or\nspeak more slowly!\"\n\nWill took a purchase on his stock of patience and began again.\n\n\"If our porters run away, you'll blame us.  We don't care to be blamed\nfor what is none of our fault.  So if you don't put 'em all on a chain\nand lock 'em up nights, we're going to discontinue paying for their\nkeep.  That's flat!  You can work 'em if you like.  Let 'em help keep\nthe township clean.  We'll pay their board and wages as long as you're\nresponsible for their not escaping!  And say!  If you want to get real\nwork out of 'em I'll give you a tip.  There never was a savage like\nthat Kazimoto of ours for getting results out of that gang.  Put him on\nthe same chain with the lot of 'em, and we'll all be satisfied!  I\ndon't presume to be running your jail, but I'm telling you facts\nthat'll hurt nobody.  Those porters 'ud be a darn sight better off with\nplenty of exercise.\"\n\n\"Do I understand you to ask that your porters be made prisoners?\" asked\nthe commandant.\n\n\"You get me exactly!\" said Will.\n\nThe commandant grunted, nodded, waited for us to get up and salute him,\ngrunted again with disgust when we did nothing of the sort, turned on\nhis heel, and walked off.  We spent an hour on tenterhooks, and I began\nto believe the German had simply become more suspicious than ever and\nwould keep closer watch on us without troubling at all about the men.\nBut at the end of an hour we saw the porters rounded up, and a chain\nfetched out that was long enough to hold them all.  They disappeared\nwithin the boma wall.  Ten minutes later suddenly Will pointed toward\nthe southward.\n\n\"Look!  See what happens when the roofs of shanty-town take fire!\"\n\nFlames went up from the dry grass roof of one of the rectangular\nSwahili huts.  Within thirty seconds the askaris on guard at the boma\nbegan firing their rifles in the air as fast as they could pull the\ntrigger and reload.  Within two minutes the chain-gang was headed for\njail, where it was locked behind doors, in order that every askari in\nMuanza might be free to pile arms and hurry to the fire.\nIt was not only askaris; the whole township turned out as to the\ncircus, with Schubert and his long kiboko ruling the riot.  The other\nsergeants were in evidence, but quiet, imperturbable men compared to\ntheir feldwebel, plying their kibokos without wasting words, stirring\nthe whole world within their reach into action--if not orderly and\npurposeful, action, at least.\n\nSchubert climbed on a roof well to windward and safe from the sparks,\nand directed proceedings in a voice that out-thundered the mob's roar\nand crackling flames.  To illustrate his meaning he seized handsful of\nthe thatch on which he stood and tore them out, to the huge discontent\nof the owner.  The crowd saw what he wanted and began at once tearing\noff roofs in a wide circle around the fire so as to isolate it,\nSchubert demonstrating until scarcely a handful of thatch remained on\nthe roof he honored and he had to stand awkwardly on the crisscross\npoles, while the owner and his women wept.\n\nWithin ten minutes after the commencement of the fire there was under\nway a regular orgy of roof pulling.  Whoever had an enemy ran and tore\nhis roof off, and there were several instances of reciprocity, two\nfamilies tearing off each other's roofs, each believing the other to be\nat the fire.\n\nMuanza was a furious place--a riot--a home of din and tumult while the\nfire lasted, and when it was put out it took another hour to stop the\nfights between victims of the flames and unofficial salvage-men.\n\n\"D'ye get the idea of it?\" asked Will.  \"D'ye see the Achilles heel?\"\n\nIn that second, I believe, Fred Oakes and I betrayed ourselves genuine\nadventurers.  Any fool could have talked glibly about setting the town\non fire; any coward could have yelped about the danger of it, and\nimprobability of success.  It needed adventurers to size up instantly\nall the odds against the idea, recognize the one infinitesimal chance,\nand plump for it.  And we were there!\n\n\"It's the only chance we've got!\" agreed Fred.  \"I'm for it!  Lead on\nAmerica!\"\n\n\"I believe we can pull it off!\" said I.  \"I'm game!\"\n\nAfter that it seemed like waste of time to talk, yet every single\ndetail of our plan had to be thought out beforehand and mentally\nrehearsed, if we hoped to have even the one slim chance we built on.\nLuckily Professor Schillingschen continued drunk, which meant that he\nwould sleep early and give Lady Waldon another chance to pay us a\nnocturnal visit.  One of our boys told us that according to market\ngossips the commandant was drinking with him and the two of them were\nwatching a sort of prolonged native nautch they had staged in seclusion\non the hill.\n\nThe next day we learned there was to be a murder trial of no less than\nnine men--an event likely to keep the whole garrison's attention drawn\naway from us.  And after the trial would come the hanging (it would\nhave been impossible to convince any one, German or native, that the\nverdict and sentence were not foregone conclusions).  The stars in\ntheir courses appeared to be on our side.  For several nights to come\nthe worst the moon could do would be to show a sliver of silver\ncrescent for an hour or two.\n\nLady Waldon came earlier that night.  When we outlined our plan to her\nroughly she argued against it at first--and it was impossible\nfar-fetched--ridiculous.  She insisted again on our simply sneaking\naway by night with her.  But Fred wasted no time on argument, and took\nthe upper hand.\n\n\"Take us or leave us, Lady Waldon, as we are!  We've an unwritten rule\nthat none of us has ever thought of breaking, that binds us to obey the\nmember of the party whose plan we have adopted.  On this occasion we\nhave agreed to Mr. Yerkes' plan, and you've got to obey him implicitly\nif you want to have part with us!  We will not leave our men or Brown\nof Lumbwa behind, and we will not change the plan by a hair's breadth!\nWill you or won't you obey?\"\n\nShe yielded then very quickly.  It seemed a relief to her at last to\nsubject her views to those of men whose purpose was merely honest.\nWill took up the reins at once.\n\n\"We've talked over buying the boat,\" he said, \"but that's hopeless.\nThe more we paid for it the louder the owner would brag.  The Germans\nwould be 'on' in a minute.  We've simply got to steal it.  It's up to\nyou to find out the man's proper name and address, and we'll send him\nthe money from the first British post-office we reach.\"\n\n\"Don Quixote de la Mancha!\" she said critically.  \"Well--we steal the\nboat and you pay for it afterward.  The owner will think you are crazy,\nand if the Germans ever discover it they will take the money away from\nhim by some legal process.  But go on!\"\n\n\"We've plenty of money,\" said Will, \"so there's no need to worry about\ntoo many supplies to begin with.  But we'll need scant rations for\nourselves and all our men until we reach some place where more are to\nbe bought.  And we've got to get them on board the dhow secretly.  The\nfirst question is, how to do that.\"\n\nShe told us at once of a path going round by the back of the hill\nbehind us, that would make the trip to the dhow in the dark a matter of\nover two miles, but that avoided all sentries and habitations.  We\nagreed that all three of us should climb to the top of the hill, which\nwas not out of bounds--and study the track next morning.  On the\nfateful night we must take our chance, just as she had done, of\navoiding the sleepy-eyed sentry who kept watch over the Greeks.\n\n\"We'll talk to Brown of Lumbwa on the morning and afternoon march\naround the township,\" Will went on.  \"Brown must whisper to Kazimoto\nthrough the corrugated iron partition in the jail at night, and have\nthem all ready to break loose at the signal and bring him along with\nthem.  We must be careful to show Brown just where the dhow is.  He has\nbeen sober quite a while.  Maybe he'll remember if we direct him\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"What is to be the signal?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just what I'm coming to,\" said Will.  \"A fire-alarm on the first windy\nnight!  The next question is, who is to start the fire?  We'll need a\ngood one!  Yet if we do it, we're likely to be caught by the crowd\ncoming running to deal with it.\"\n\n\"Coutlass!\" she answered suddenly.  \"Coutlass and his two friends!\"\n\n\"You'll perhaps pardon me,\" Fred answered, \"but none of us would trust\nthose Greeks as far as a hen could swim in alcohol!\"\n\n\"Yet you must!  Leave them to me!  They don't know that the sand in my\nglass has run down.  Let me go to them presently, pretending that I\nwent direct to them and am afraid of being seen by you.  I will tell\nthem that the Germans want a good excuse for putting you three men in\njail and that they will be sent away free as a reward if they will\nstart a fire and charge you afterward with arson!  I will tell them to\nchoose the first windy night, so as to have a really spectacular blaze\nworth committing perjury about!\"\n\n\"Better arrange a signal,\" Will advised.  \"They might otherwise fire\nbefore we were ready!\"\n\n\"Very well.  You men give me the word at midday of the day of the\nstart, and I will spread red, white and blue laundry on the roof of the\ncommandant's house for the Greeks to see.\"\n\n\"Good enough!\" agreed Will.  \"Now one more stunt!  We simply must have\nfirearms.  The Germans have taken ours away and locked them up.  At a\npinch I suppose we could manage with one rifle, provided we had lots of\nammunition.  We would rather have one each.  In fact, the more the\nmerrier.  One we must have!  What about it?\"\n\nShe thought for several minutes.  At last she told us that one of the\ncommandant's rifles and one of Schillingschen's stood leaning in a\ncorner of the living-room beside a book-case.  Whether she could make\naway with one or both of those without detection she did not know, and\nshe would have to use her wits regarding ammunition.  It was always\nkept locked up.\n\n\"Why not kill an askari and take his rifle and cartridges?\" she asked.\n\"The sentry on duty watching the Greeks will be in the way.  Knock him\non the head from behind!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" grinned Will, exchanging glances with us.  \"We shall have\nabout enough on our consciences setting fire to half the township.\nWe'll not kill except in self-defense.\"\n\n\"But you won't set the town on fire!  The Greeks will do that!\"\n\n\"Don't let's argue ethics!\" Fred interrupted, for Will's ears were\ngetting red.  \"Can you tell us for certain, Lady Waldon, whether all\nthe askaris and German sergeants really run to a fire?  Or do a certain\nnumber remain in the boma?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know about that,\" she answered.  \"Until the prisoners are all\nlocked in--that is to say, in case of fire in the daytime--six or eight\naskaris remain inside the boma.  The minute they are locked in, if the\nfire is serious, and in case of fire by night, they all go except two,\nwho stand on the eastern boma wall, one at each corner.  From there\nthey are supposed to be able to see on every side except the\nwater-front.  Nobody guards the water-front; I don't know why, unless\nit is that the gate on that side is kept locked almost always and the\nwall runs along the water's edge.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said I, \"those two sentries on the wall will be\ntoo busy staring at the fire, if the Greeks really make a big one, to\nsee anything else unless we march by under their noses with a brass\nband.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" sneered Lady Waldon.  \"If I get that rifle I would dare shoot\nthem both for you myself!\"\n\n\"If you overstep one detail of Will's plan, I guarantee to put you\nashore on the first barren island we come to!\" said Fred.  \"Leave\nshooting to us!\"\n\nThe next problem was to draw away from the Greeks the attention of the\naskari at the cross-roads.  We could not see him, for it was one of\nthose black African nights when the stars look like tiny pin-pricks and\nthere are no shadows because all is dark.  To go out and look what he\nwas doing would have been to arouse his suspicion.  Yet there was\nalways a chance that he might be patrolling down near the Greek camp;\ndoubtless acting on orders, he had a trick of approaching their tents\nvery closely once in a while.\n\nSo when Lady Waldon had slipped out into the darkness we lit half a\ndozen lamps and started a concert, Fred playing and we singing the sort\nof tunes that black men love.  He took the bait, hook, sinker, and all;\nin the silence at the end of the first song we heard his butt ground\non the gravel just beyond the cactus hedge in front of us; and there\nhe stayed, we entertaining him for an hour.  By that time we were quite\nsure that Lady Waldon had passed along the road behind him; so Fred\nwent out and gave him tobacco.\n\n\"It's time you went and looked at those Greeks again!\" he advised him.\n\"You would be in trouble if they slipped away in the night!\"\n\nNow that a plan of campaign was finally decided on, there seemed much\nless to do than we had feared.  Mapping out in our minds the way round\nthe back of the hill to the dhow was perfectly simple; we went and\nsmoked on the hilltop, and within an hour after breakfast had every\nturn and twist memorized.  Fred drew a chart of the track for safety's\nsake.\n\nPersuading Brown of Lumbwa proved unexpectedly to be much the most\ndifficult task.  Added to the fact that the askaris who marched behind\nand the Greeks who marched in front were unusually inquisitive, Brown\nhimself was afraid.\n\n\"We'll all be shot in the dark!\" he objected.\n\n\"Would you rather,\" Will asked, \"be shot in the dark with a run for\nyour money, or fed to the crocks in the doctor's pond?\"  And he told\nhim about the crocodiles to encourage him.\n\n\"They'll have to let me out of jail at the end of the month,\" Brown\nargued.\n\n\"Don't you believe it!  In less than a week from now we'll all be in on\none and the same charge of filibustering!  They'll not let you go back\nto British East to tell tales about their treatment of the rest of us,\"\nWill assured him.\n\nBut Brown proved tinged with a little streak of yellow somewhere.  It\nwas not until the afternoon march that Fred and Will, one on either\nside of him, by appeals to his racial instinct and recalling the\nmethods of the military court, induced him to do his part.  Once having\npromised he vowed he would see the thing through to the end; but he\nwas the weak link; he was afraid; and he disbelieved in the wisdom of\nthe attempt.\n\nIt was Kazimoto in the end who kept Brown up to the mark, and shamed\nhim into action by superior courage.  Fred found a chance to speak to\nhim as the long string rested al noon under the narrow shade of a\ncactus hedge, and warned him in about fifty words of what was intended.\n(The askaris, almost as leg-weary as the gang, were sprawling at the\nfar end of the line, gambling at pitch-and-toss.)\n\n\"Be sure you sleep as near to the partition as you can.  Get details of\nthe plan from Mr. Brown, and then drill the porters one by one!  Don't\nlet them tell one another.  You tell each one of them yourself!\"\n\nThen he walked down the line and ordered the porters in a loud voice to\nobey the askaris implicitly, and to work harder in return for the good\nfood and care they were getting, winking at the same time very\nemphatically, with the eye the askaris could not see.\n\nThe night work was the hardest, because, although we were quite sure\nabout direction, even in the dark, it was another matter to feel our\nway and carry unaccustomed loads.  By day we decided what to take and\nwhat to leave behind, and we cut down what to take with us to the\nirreducible, dangerous minimum.  Then we broke that up into thirty- or\nforty-pound packages, so that when we all three made the trip to the\ndhow the most we took at one time was about a hundred pounds' weight.\nIn the condition I was in I could take not more than one trip to the\nothers' two; after the first it was agreed that I would better stay\nbehind and keep an eye on the askari.  The minute he showed symptoms of\nbecoming inquisitive I was to invent some way of keeping his attention;\nso all unsuspected by him I lay in the sand by the roadside within\nthree yards of him, while the ants crawled over me and he dozed leaning\non his rifle.  Once a long snake crawled over my wrist and my very\nmarrow curdled with fear and loathing; but except for mosquitoes, who\nwere legion and sucked their fill, there was no other contretemps.  I\ndon't know what I would have done if the askari had taken alarm and set\noff to investigate.  I trusted to intuition should that happen.\n\nThe work of arranging the stuff in the dhow was the most difficult of\nall, because we dared not light a lantern, yet we also dared not stow\nthings carelessly for fear of confusion when the hour of action came.\nThe space was ridiculously small for ourselves and all those men, and\nevery inch had to be economized.  In addition to that the dhow had to\nbe worked backward off the mud far enough to be shoved off easily, and\nthen made fast by a rope to the bushes in such way as not to be\nnoticeable.  Most of the ropes turned out to be rather rotten, and we\ncould only guess at the condition of the sails; the feel of them in\nthe dark gave us small assurance.  But fortunately we had a couple of\nhundred feet of good half-inch manila in camp with us,  and that Fred\nand Will took out and stowed in the hold the night following.\n\nWe bought such things at the D.O.A.G. as we could without arousing\nsuspicion, as, for instance, a quantity of German dried pea-soup--not\nthat the porters would take to it kindly, but it would go a long way\namong them at a pinch.  Live stock we did not dare buy, for fear of the\nnoise it would make; but we laid in some eggs and bananas.  Most of\nthe thirty-pound loads were rice.\n\nIt troubled us sorely to leave our good tents, beds, and equipment\nbehind, yet all we could take was the blankets and one gladstone bag\npacked with clothes for us all.  Kettles and pots and pans were a noisy\nnuisance, yet we had to have them, and blankets for all those porters,\nwho would escape from jail practically naked, were an essential; but\nfortunately we had a sixty-pound bale of trade-blankets among our loads.\n\nNot one word did we exchange all this while with Coutlass and his\nfriends.  Not one overture did we make to them, or they to us.  But\nthere was no doubt of their intention to do their worst.  They gloated\nover us--eyed us with lofty disdain and scornful superior knowledge.\nThey were so full of the notion of having us jailed for their misdeed\nthat they positively ached to come and jeer at us, and I believe were\nonly saved from doing that by the shortness of the time.\n\nAt last, three days after decision had been reached, we threw our\nblankets with a red one uppermost over the top of both tents in the\nsun; and within thirty minutes after that Lady Saffren Waldon had\nspread on the commandant's roof a blue cotton dress, a white petticoat,\nand a blazing red piece of silken stuff.  There and then the Greeks and\nthe Goanese pledged one another out in the open with copious draughts\nin turn from the neck of one whisky bottle, and we began to pray they\nmight not get too drunk before night.  Judging by their meaning glances\nat us, they considered us their mortal and cruel enemies whom it would\nbe an act of sublime virtue to bring to book.\n\nThe trial of the natives for murder had taken place, accompanied by the\nusual amount of thrashing of witnesses and the usual stir throughout\nthe countryside.  These were charged with having murdered an askari\nnear their village--a big bully sent to arrest a man, who had taken\nleave to help himself to more than rations, and had made a lot too free\nwith the village women.  So German military honor had to be upheld\nexemplarily.  Condign vengeance was sure and swift.  The execution was\nto take place on the drill-ground on the day we chose for our departure.\n\nThere was no risk of investigations that day.  Had we known it, we\ncould have gone away in all likelihood in broad daylight, so busy was\nthe garrison in marshaling into place and policing the swarms of\nvillagers brought in from as far as sixty miles away to witness German\njustice.  Even the customary parade of the band was canceled for that\noccasion, and that was our only real ground for uneasiness, for it\nprevented our having a last talk with Brown of Lumbwa and assuring\nourselves that courage would not fail him in the pinch.\n\nWe worried in plenty without cause, as it seems that humans must do on\nthe eve of putting plans, however well laid, to the test.  We had a\nthousand scares--a thousand doubts--and overlooked at least a thousand\nevidences that fortune favored us.  Toward the end our hearts turned to\nwater at the thought that Kazimoto would probably fail to do his part,\nalthough why we should have doubted him after his faithful record, and\nknowing his hatred of German rule, we would have found it hard to say.\n\nSeveral times that morning we showed ourselves about the town, with the\npurpose of allaying any possible suspicion and saving the authorities\nthe trouble of asking what we were up to.  With the same end in view we\nattended the execution in the afternoon, and sincerely wished before it\nwas over that we had stayed away.\n\nOn this occasion even the chain-gangs were included among the\nspectators, in the front row, on the ground that, being proved\ncriminals, they needed the lesson more than the hempen-noose-food not\nyet caught and tried and brought to book.\n\nThe same sort of sermon, only this time more fiery and full of ranting\nhumbug about German righteousness, was preached by the commandant.  The\nmiserable victims had received a simple death sentence, but he\nexplained that in virtue of his superior office he had seen fit to add\nto it.  \"Death\" he explained, \"would certainly rid the German\nprotectorate of such conscienceless scalawags as these, but might not\nbe enough to discourage the bad element that disliked German rule.\nNatives must be taught that the very name of all that is German must be\nreverenced, and that German punishment is as terrible and sure as the\nGerman arm is long!  And be sure of this!\" he continued.  \"The ear of\nthe German government is as far-reaching as its arm!  In your\nvillages--in your homes--in your families--there is always an agent of\nthe government listening!  Your own brother--your wife--your child may\nbe that agent of the government!  Now, watch carefully and see what\nhappens to men with bad hearts--aye, and to women with bad hearts, who\nconspire against German rule!\"\n\nWhat followed was more impressive because of the determination we had\nheard of to bring all Africa under the German yoke.  In vain should the\nwretched natives in after years escape by the hundreds northward in the\nhope of living under British government.  The fools--the \"easy\npeople\"--the \"folk who gave without a price\"--the \"truth tellers\"--the\n\"men who wish to forget\"--the unwise, cocksure, cleaner-living,\nunbelievably credulous, foolishly honest British officials would be all\ngone.  The pikelhaube and the lash, blackmail and coercion would take\nthe place of generosity.  Africa would better be back under the Arabs\nagain, for the Arabs had no system to speak of and were inefficient.\nSome Arabs have a heart--some a very soft heart.\n\nThe crowd grew bright-eyed, little children straining forward between\ntheir elders in the bull-fight frenzy--that same intoxication of the\nsenses that held the Roman freemen spellbound at the sight of suffering.\n\nOne at a time, that the last might see the torture of the first, the\nvictims were noosed by the heel (one heel)--thrown with a jerk--hauled\nheel-first to the overhanging branch--and flogged into unconsciousness\nwith slow blows, the lieutenant standing by to reprove the askaris if\nthey struck too fast, for that would have been merciful.  Not until the\nvictims ceased to struggle were they lowered and thrown on the ground,\nto lie bleeding, awaiting their turn to be hanged.\n\nThe last two--supposed to have been the culprits who actually held the\nspear that pierced the marauding askari's heart--were hauled up\nheel-to-heel together, and hanged presently in the same noose, the\ncommandant laughing at their struggles and Professor Schillingschen\nstudying their agony with strictly scientific interest.\n\nWhen the last had ceased struggling Schillingschen permitted himself\none more pleasure.  He strolled over to us and blocked Fred's way,\nstanding with hands behind him and out-thrust chin.\n\n\"You flatter yourself, don't you!\" he sneered.  He was just drunk\nenough to be boastful, while thoroughly sure of what he was saying.\n\"You expect to tell a fine tale!  I know the psychology of the English!\n I know it like a book!  Let me tell you two things:  First, your\nEnglish would not believe you.  They are such supremely cocksure fools\nthat they can not be made to believe that another so-called civilized\nnation would act as they, in their egoism, would be ashamed to act!\nCivilization!  That is a fine word, full of false meanings!\nCivilization is prudery--sham--false pride--veneer!  Only the Germans\nare truly civilized, because they alone are not afraid to face naked\nanimalism without its mask!  The British dare not! They hide from\nit--shut their eyes!  The fools!  If you could tell them their story\nthey would never listen!\n\n\"Second:  You will never tell the story!  Being English, you were such\ndull-witted fools that you did not even hide the cartridge cases, or\nthe bones of the Masai you shot!  Bah-ha-ha-ha-hah!  You can escape\nhanging yet by telling your secret.  Jail you can not escape!  Try it\nif you don't believe me!  Try to escape--go on!\"\n\nHe turned on his heel and left us, striding heavily with the strength\nof an ox and about the alertness of a traction engine, turning his head\nevery once in a while to enjoy the spectacle of our discomfort.\n\nWe judged it best to appear concerned, as if that was indeed our first\nrealization of the extent of the case against us and the nature of the\nevidence.  But we did not find it difficult.  We were all three\nstartled by the fear that in some way he had got wind of our plans, and\nthat he meant to play with us cat-and-mouse fashion.\n\nThat night it stormed--not rain, but wind from east to west, blowing\nsuch clouds of dust that one could scarcely see across the narrow\nstreets.  Every element favored us.  Even the askari at the\ncross-roads, supposed to be watching the Greeks, turned his back to the\nwind, and what with rubbing sand in and out of smarting eyes and\nfingering it out of his ears, heard and saw nothing.  It was scarcely\nsunset when we saw both Greeks and the Goanese sneak out of the camping\nplace in Indian file with their pockets full of cotton waste.  They had\nsoaked the stuff in kerosene right under our eye that afternoon.\n\nThere ought to have been a sliver of moon, but the wind and dust hid\nit.  Fifteen minutes after sundown the only light was from the lamps in\nwindows and the cooking fires glowing in the open here and there.\nThirty minutes later there began to be a red glow in three directions.\nLess than one second after we saw the first indications of the\nholocaust a regular volley of shots broke out from the boma as the\nsentries on duty gave the general alarm.  Less than five minutes after\nthat the whole of the southern, grass-roofed section of the town was\ngoing up in flames, and every living man, black, white, gray, mulatto,\nbrown and mixed, was running full pelt to the scene of action.\n\nWe waited ten minutes longer, rather expecting the Greeks to double\nback and begin denouncing us at once.  In that case we intended to\nstretch them out with the first weapons handy.  I sat feeling the\nweight of an ax, and wondering just how hard I could hit a Greek's head\nwith the back of it without killing him.  Fred had a long tent-peg.\nWill chose a wooden mallet that our porters carried to help in pitching\ntents.\n\nBut the Greeks did not come, and there streamed such a perfect screen\nof crimson dust, sparkling in the reflected blaze and more beautiful\nthan all the fireworks ever loosed off at a coronation, that it was\nfolly to linger.  We each seized the load left for that last trip\n(Fred's included the hammer, pincers, and cold chisel for striking off\nthe porters' chain) and started off quietly round the hill, not\nbeginning to hurry until the hill lay between us and the burning town.\n\nThere was not much need for caution.  The roar of flames, the shouting,\nthe excitement would have protected us, whatever noise we made, however\nopenly we ran.  Over and above the tumult we could hear Schubert's\nbull-throated bellowing, and then the echo to him as the sergeants took\nup the shout all together, ordering \"Off with the grass roofs!  Off\nwith the roofs!\"\n\nThe white officials were more than interested, and had no time for\nanything but thought for the blaze.  As we crossed the shoulder of the\nfar side of the hill we could see them standing on the drill-ground all\ntogether, clearly defined against the crimson flare.  Schillingschen\nwas with them.\n\nThere was no sign of what had happened at the boma.  The gang would\nhave to emerge from a little-used gate at the northern end, provided\nthey could break the lock or secure the key to it; otherwise their\nonly chance was to climb the wall by the cook-house roof and jump\ntwenty feet on the far side.  I was for running to the little gate and\nbursting it in from the outside, but Fred damned me for a mutineer\nbetween his panting for breath, and Will, who was longer-winded, agreed\nwith him.\n\n\"Have to leave their end of the plan to them!  Let's do our part right!\"\n\nAs it turned out, we were last at the rendezvous.  We heard the chain\nclanking in the dark just ahead of us, and try how we might, could not\ncatch up.  Then, near the boat bow, Kazimoto suddenly recognized Fred\nand nearly throttled him in a fierce embrace, releasing all his pent-up\nrage, agony, resentment, misery, fear in one paroxysm of affection for\nthe man who cared enough to run risks for the sake of rescuing him.\nFred had to pry him off by main force.\n\n\"Into the boat with you!\" Will ordered them.  \"Chain-gang first!  Get\ndown below, and lie down!  The first head that shows shall be hit with\na club!  Quickly now!\"\n\nClanking their infernal chain like all the ghosts from all the haunted\ngranges of the Old World, they climbed overside and disappeared.  There\nwere more figures left on shore then than we expected.  Brown we could\nmake out dimly in the dark:  he was chattering nervously, and admitted\nthat but for Kazimoto he would not be there.  The faithful fellow had\nbroken down the corrugated iron partition and had dragged him out by\nmain force.  He was rather resentful than grateful.\n\n\"Hauled here by a nigger--think of it!\"\n\nWe ordered Brown on board and below, pretty peremptorily.  Lady Saffren\nWaldon stepped out of the darkness next, holding a rifle and two\nbandoliers so full of cartridges that she could hardly raise her arms.\nWe took the load from her, and helped her overside.  Fred took the\nrifle and succumbed to the hunter's habit of opening the breach first\nthing.  It was a German sporting Mauser, with a hair trigger attachment\nand magazine, as handy and useful a weapon as the heart of man could\nwish.  He had scarcely snapped the breach to again when a voice we all\nrecognized made the hair rise on my neck.  Fred jumped and raised the\nrifle.  Will swore softly--endlessly.\n\n\"Gassharrrrammminy!  You men took us for damned fools, didn't you?  You\nthought to get away and leave us!  By hell, no!  We go or you stay!\nBirds of a feather fly together!  One of you is American--I am\nAmerican!  Two of you are English--I am English, and can prove it!  My\nfriends come with me!\"\n\nFred leveled the rifle at him.\n\n\"About face!  Off back to town with you!\" he barked.\n\n\"Not on your tin-type!\" Coutlass yelled.  \"I'm no man's popinjay!\nShoot if you dare, and I'll spoil the whole game!  Help!  He-e-e-lp!\nHe-e-e-e-lp!\"\n\nThe other Greek and the Goanese joined in the shout, the dark man\nsetting up such an ululating screech that the very storm dwindled into\nsecond place in comparison.  It was true, the unearthly yelling was\ncarried out over the water, and very likely not a sound of it reached\ntwenty yards inland; but it rattled our nerves, nevertheless.  The\nskin grew prickly all up and down my backbone, and the men on the\nchain-gang inside the hull began shouting to know what the matter was.\n\nWill remembered then that he was captain for the day, and made virtue\nof necessity.\n\n\"In with you!\" he ordered. \"Quick!\"\n\nWith a grin that was half-triumph, half-cunning, and wholly glad,\nCoutlass helped his companions over the bow, and had the civility to\nstand there with hand outstretched to help us in after him.  We sent\nhim below with his friends, but he came up again and insisted on\nleaning his weight on the poles with which we began shoving off into\ndeeper water.  It was hard work, for with her human cargo and several\nhundred gallons of water that had leaked through her gaping seams, the\ndhow was down several inches.  Her hull had just begun to feel the wind\nand to rise and fall freely, when a white figure ran screaming down\ntoward the water's edge and stood there waving to us frantically.\n\n\"Leave her!\" said Lady Waldon excitedly, clutching my arm.  I was up on\nthe bow, just about to lay the pole along the deck and haul on the\nhalyards.  She spoke very slowly right in my ear.  \"That, is my maid\nRebecca.  The faithless slut--\"\n\nCoutlass began to shout, trying to pole the dhow back to land\nsingle-handed.\n\n\"We can't leave that woman behind there!\" Fred shouted, hardly making\nhimself heard against the wind.\n\n\"Can't we!\" shouted Lady Waldon.  \"Give me that rifle, and I'll solve\nthe problem for you!\"\n\nBut Coutlass solved it in another way by jumping overboard, over his\nhead in deep water, taking our hempen warp with him (I had made one end\nof it fast to the bitts, meaning to be able to find it in the dark).\n\nThere was quite a sea running, even as close inshore as that, and for a\nmoment I doubted whether the Greek would make it.  By that time it was\nall we could do to see the woman's white figure, still gesticulating,\nand screaming like a mad thing.  Presently, however, the warp\ntightened, and then by the strain on it I knew that Coutlass was trying\nto haul us back inshore.  Failing to do that, for the strength of the\nwind was increasing, he seized the Syrian woman by the waist and\nplunged into the water with her.  I saw them disappear and hauled on\nthe warp hand-over-hand with all my might, Lady Waldon leaning over to\nstrike at my hands until I shouted to Fred to come and hold her.  Then\nshe begged Fred again for the rifle, promising to kill the two of them\nand reduce our problem to that extent if we would only let her.\n\nWill and I hauled the dripping pair on board, and Coutlass carried the\nmaid to the stern. She had fainted, either from fright or from being\nhalf-drowned, there was no guessing which.  Then in pitch blackness\nwith Will's help I got the ship beam to the wind and began to make sail.\n\nNow danger was only just beginning!  I was the only one of them all who\nknew anything whatever about sails and sailing.  I was too weak to get\nthe sail up single-handed, had no compass, knew nothing whatever of the\nrocks and shoals, except by rumor that there were plenty of both.\nThere appeared to be no way of reefing the lateen sail, which was made\nof no better material than calico, and I was entirely unfamiliar with\nthe rigging.\n\nBehind us, as we payed before the gaining wind, was brilliant blaze\nthat showed where Muanza was.  Against the blaze stood out the lakeward\nboma wall.  I stood due east away from it, and discovered presently\nthat by easing on the halyard so as to lower the long spar I could\nobtain something the effect of reefing.\n\nI set Fred and Will to making a sea-anchor of buckets and spars in case\nthe sail or rotten rigging should carry away, leaving us at the mercy\nof the short steep waves that fresh-water lakes and the North Sea only\nknow.  The big curved spar, now that it was hanging low, bucked and\nswung and the dhow steered like an omnibus on slippery pavement.\nLuckily, I had living ballast and could trim the ship how I chose.\nThey all began to grow seasick, but I gave them something to think\nabout by making them shift backward and forward and from side to side\nuntil I found which way the dhow rode easiest.\n\nWhen Fred had finished the sea-anchor he got out the tools and began\nstriking off the iron rings on the porters' necks through which the\nchain passed.  The job took him two hours, but at the end of it we\nowned a good serviceable chain, and a crew that could be drilled to\ntake the brute hard labor off our shoulders.\n\nCoutlass meanwhile was busy on the seat in the stern beside me making\nHellenic inflammatory love to Lady Waldon's maid, whom he had wrapped\nin his own blanket and held shivering in his arms.  Lady Waldon herself\nsat on the other side of me, affecting not to be aware of the existence\nof either of them.  The other Greek and the Goanese had been driven\nbelow, where they started to smoke until I saw the glow of their pipes\nand shouted to Will to stop that foolishness.  He snatched both pipes\nand threw them overboard.  The thought of being seen from shore was\nalmost incitement enough for murder.  They refused to turn a hand to\nanything that night, but sat sulking below the sloping roof of reeds\nand tarpaulin that did duty for a deck, wedged alongside of seasick\nWanyamwezi.\n\nIt was Kazimoto who chose the least disheartened of the gang, beat them\nand stung them into liveliness, and set them to bailing.  There was a\ntrough running thwartwise of the ship into which the water had to be\nlifted from the midship well.  It took the gang of eight men, working\nin relays, until nearly dawn to get the water out of her; and to keep\nher bottom reasonably dry after that two men working constantly.\n\nI knew vaguely that the great island of Ukerewe lay to the\nnorthwestward of us.  Between that and the mainland, running roughly\nnorth, was a passage that narrowed in more than one place to less than\na hundred yards.  That would have been the obvious course to take had\nwe not been afraid of pursuit, had we dared get away by daylight, and\nprovided I had known the way.  As it was I intended to add another\nhundred miles to the distance between us and the northern shore of the\nlake, by sailing well clear of and around Ukerewe, trusting to the less\nfrequented water and the wilder islands to make escape easier.\n\nI judged it likely that the moment we were missed, the launch would be\nsent off in search of us, and that the Germans would search the narrow\npassage first.  They would expect us to take the narrow passage, as the\nshortest, and depend on their ability to steam a dozen miles an hour to\noverhaul us, even should we get a long start on the outside course.\n\nWith gaining wind, a following sea, a little ship crowded to\nsuffocation, and a sail that might blow to shreds at any minute, it was\nnot long before I began to pray for the lee of Ukerewe, and to stand in\ncloser toward where I judged the end of the island ought to be than\nperhaps I should have done.  It was lucky, though, that I did.\n\nIn making calculations I had overlooked the obvious fact that, steaming\nthree miles to our one, the launch could very well afford to take the\noutside course to start with.  Then they could take a good look for us\nin the open water next morning, and, failing to find us, steam all\naround Ukerewe, come back down the inside passage, and catch us between\ntwo banks.\n\nIt was Lady Saffren Waldon on my left hand, looking anywhere but at her\nmaid and sweeping the dark waste of water with eyes as restless as the\nwaves themselves, who gave the first alarm.\n\n\"What is that light?\" she asked me.\n\nFollowing the direction of her hand I saw a red glow on the water to\nour left, not more than a mile behind.\n\n\"Reflection from the burning town,\" I answered, but I had no sooner\nsaid it than I knew the answer was foolish.  It was the glow that rides\nabove hot steamer funnels in the night.\n\n\"Fred!\" I shouted, for fear took hold of the very roots of my heart,\n\"for the love of God make every one keep silence! Show no lights!\nDon't speak above a whisper!  Keep all heads below the gunwale!  That\ncursed German launch is after us!\"\n\nWe were in double danger.  I could hear surf pounding on rocks to\nstarboard.  I did not dare to come up into the wind because nobody but\nI knew how the spar would have to be passed around the mast, and in any\ncase the noise and the fluttering sail might attract attention.\n\n\"Look out for breakers ahead!\" I ordered.  \"I'm going to hold this\ncourse and hope they pass us in the dark!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n\"DAVID PREVAILED\"\n                (I. Sam. 17:50)\n\n  Be glad if ye know the accursed thing\n        And know it accurst, for the Gift is yours\n  Of Sight where the prophets of blindness sing\n        By the brink of death. And the Gift endures;\n  Ye shall see the last of the sharpened lies\n        That rivet privilege's gripe.\n  Be still, then, ye with the opened eyes,\n        Come away from the thing till the time is ripe.\n\n  Be glad that ye loathe the accursed thing,\n        It is given to you to foreknow the end.\n  But they who the unwise challenge fling\n        Shall startle foe at the risk of friend\n  As yet unready to endure--\n        And can ye fend Goliath's swipe?\n  The slowly grinding mills are sure,\n        Let terror alone till the time is ripe.\n\n  Be glad when the shout for the spoils, and the glee,\n        The hoofs and the wheels of the prophets of wrong,\n  Out thunder the warning of what shall be;\n        Be still, for the tumult is not for long.\n  The Finger that wrote, from a polished wall\n        As surely the closed account shall wipe;\n  The accursed thing ye feared shall fall\n        To a boy with a sling when the time is ripe.\n\n\nIf the dhow had been seaworthy; if the crew had understood the rigging\nand the long unwieldy spar; if we had had any chart, or had known\nanything whatever of the coast; if nobody had been afraid; and, above\nall, if that incessant din of surf pounding on rocks not far away to\nstarboard had not threatened disaster even greater than the Germans in\nthe steam launch, our problem might have been simple enough.\n\nBut every one was afraid, including me who held the tiller (and the\nlives of all the party) in my right hand.  Lady Saffren Waldon\ndisguised fear under an acid temper and some villainously bad advice.\n\n\"Steer toward them!\" she kept shouting in my ear.  \"Steer toward them!\nRam them!  Sink them!\"\n\nCoutlass, on my other hand, made feverish haste with his love-affair,\nfearful lest discovery by the Germans should postpone forever the\nassuaging of his hungry heart's desire.\n\n\"Steer toward shore!\" he urged me.  \"Who cares if we run on rocks?\nCan't we swim?  Gassharamminy!  Take to the land and give them a run\nfor it!\"\n\nHe seized the tiller to reinforce the argument, and wrenched at it\nuntil I hit him, and Fred threatened him with the only rifle.\n\n\"Get up forward!\" Fred ordered; but Georges Coutlass would not go.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he snarled. \"You want my girl!  I will fight the whole\ndamned crew before I let her out of the hollow of my arm.\n\n\"All right, touch that tiller again and I'll kill you!\" Fred warned him.\n\n\"Touch my girl, and you kill me or get out and swim!\" Coutlass retorted.\n\nWill was up forward with Brown, looking out for breakers through the\nspray that swept over us continually.  I watched the glow that rode\nabove the launch's funnel, marveling, when I found time for it, at the\nmystery of why the cotton sail should hold.  The firm, somewhere in\nConnecticut, who made that export calico, should be praised by name,\nonly that the dye they used was much less perfect than the stuff and\nworkmanship; their trademark was all washed out.\n\nSuddenly Will dodged under the bellying sail, throwing up both hands,\nand he and Brown screamed at me:  \"To your left!  Go to your left!\nRocks to the right!\"\n\nThe Germans had passed us, but not by much, for the short steep seas\nwere tossing their propeller out of the water half the time.  Because\nof the course I had taken the wind was setting slightly from us toward\nthem, and I could have sworn they heard Will's voice.  Yet there was\nnothing for it but to put the helm over, and as I laid her nearly\nbroadside to the wind a great wave swept us.  At that the Greek, the\nGoanese, and all the natives in the hold set up a yell together that\nought to have announced our presence to the Seven Sleepers.\n\nI held the helm up, and let her reel and wallow in the trough.  Now I\ncould see the fangs of rock myself and the white waves raging around\nthem.  See?  I could have spat on them!  There was a current there that\nset strongly toward the rocks, for a backwash of some sort helped the\nhelm and we won clear, about a third full of water, with the crew too\npanicky to bail.\n\n\"Hold her so!\" yelled Fred in my ear.  \"Don't ease up yet!  If we get\ntoo close and they see us, I've the rifle!  They haven't seen us yet!\"\n\n\"Rocks ahead again!\" yelled Will.  \"To the left again!\"\n\nWe were in the gaping jaws of a sort of pocket, and it was too late to\nsteer clear.\n\n\"Throw the anchor over!\" I roared, \"and let go everything.\"\n\nWill attended to the anchor.  Fred was too anxious for the safety of\nthe only rifle to trust it out of hand, and he hesitated.  Georges\nCoutlass saved the day by letting go the shivering Syrian maid and\nslashing at the halyard with his knife.  Down came the great spar with\na crash, and as the dhow swung round in answer to anchor and helm,\nFred, Will and Brown, between them, contrived to save the sail, Brown\ncomplaining that we were the first sailors he ever heard of who did not\nhave rum served them for working overtime in dirty weather.\n\nSo we lay, then, wallowing in the jaws of a crescent granite reef, and\nwatched the red glow above the German launch move farther and farther\naway from us.  We waited there, wet and hungry, until dawn dimmed the\nflame from the burning roofs of Muanza, Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon\nloudly accusing us all at intervals of being rank incompetents unfit to\nbe trusted with the lives of fish, and Coutlass afraid of nothing but\ninterruption.  The things he said to the maid, in English--the only\nlanguage that they had apparently in common--would have scandalized a\nGoanese harbor \"guide\" or a Rock Scorpion from the lower streets of\nGib.  He did not mention marriage to her, beyond admitting that he had\nhalf a dozen wives already, and had been too bored by convention ever\nto submit to the yoke again.  The maid seemed enraptured--delirious in\nthe bight of his lawless arm, forgetful of her wetting, and only afraid\nwhen he left her for a minute.\n\nWe dared not try to cook anything, even supposing that had been\npossible.  Forward was a box full of sand to serve as hearthstone, but\nthe little scraps of fuel we had brought with us were drenched and\nunburnable, even if the risk of being seen were not too great.  Lady\nSaffren Waldon told us we were \"toe-rag contrivers.\"  In fact, now that\nshe was out of reach of the men she feared and hated most, she reverted\nto type and tried to domineer over us all by the simple old\nrecipe--audacious arrogance.  Luckily, she slept for an hour or two.\n\nA little before dawn, when it began to be light enough to let us see\nthe outline of the shore, we sent Kazimoto aloft to reeve our hemp rope\nthrough the hole that did duty for block, and by the time the sun had\npushed the uppermost arc of his rim above the sky-line we once more had\nthe sail set.\n\nThe wind was still blowing a gale; the seamanlike precaution would\nhave been to lie where we were at anchor until fairer weather; but\ndaring is forced on the fearfullest, and there was nothing for it but\nto study out the method by which the unwieldy spar should be made to\npass the mast when tacking, drill Fred, Will, Brown and Kazimoto, and\nthen haul up the anchor and sail away before people on shore could see\nus.\n\nWe had to tack toward Muanza for a quarter of a mile with fear in our\narms to make them clumsy before I dared believe we were clear of the\nreefs; but when I put the helm down at last there was neither launch\nin sight nor any other boat that might contain an enemy.  The southern\nspur of Ukerewe stuck out like a wedge into boiling water not many\nmiles ahead, and once around that we should be sheltered.  The only fly\nin the ointment then was the probability that the launch would be\nwaiting for us just around the spur, or else under the lee of another\nsmaller island in the offing to our left, but what we could not see in\nthat hour could not upset us much.\n\nEvery one clamored for food.  The porters, already forgetful of the\nchain that had galled them, and the whips that had flayed them day and\nnight, demanded to be set ashore to build a fire and eat.  Lady Saffren\nWaldon awoke to fresh bad temper, and Coutlass, too, grew villainously\nimpatient.  His Greek friend, from under the shelter of the leaky\nreed-and-tarpaulin deck, offered him Greek advice, and was cursed for\nhis trouble.  One curse led to another, and then they both had to be\nbeaten into subjection with the first thing handy, because when they\nfought Lady Saffren Waldon egged them on and the maid tried to savage\nthe other Greek with a brooch-pin, which brought out the Goanese to the\nrescue.  That crowded dhow was no place for pitched battles, plunging\nand rolling between the frying-pan of Muanza and the fire of unknown\nthings ahead.\n\n\"One more outbreak from you, and I shoot!\" Fred announced, patting the\nrifle.  But, he did not mean it, and Coutlass knew he did not.  The\nEnglish temperament does not turn readily on even the most rascally\nfellow beings in distress.  Besides, it was an indubitable fact that we\nall much preferred Coutlass, with his daring record, and now a most\noutrageous love-affair on hand, to the other Greek or the Goanese, who\nwere now disposed to bid for our friendship by abusing him.  Georges\nCoutlass was no drawing-room darling, or worthy citizen of any land,\nbut he had courage of a kind, and a sort of splendid fire that made men\nforget his turpitude.\n\nWe were a seasick, cold and sorry company that rounded the point at\nlast and came to anchor in a calm shallow bay where fuel grew close\ndown to the water's edge.  Having no small boat, we had to wade ashore\nand carry the women, Coutlass attending to his own inamorata.  Lady\nSaffren Waldon's picric acid rage exploded by being dropped between two\nporters waist-deep into the water.  It was her fault.  She insisted one\nwas not enough, yet refused to explain how two should do the work of\none.  Sitting on their two shoulders, holding on by their hair, she\nfrightened the left-hand man by losing her balance and clutching his\nnose and eyes.  She insisted on having both men flogged for having\ndropped her, and Fred's refusal was the signal for new war, our rescue\nof her being flung at once on to the scrap heap of her memory.\n\nShe counted with cold cynicism on our unwillingness to leave her again\nat the mercy of the Germans, and had no more consideration of our\nrights or feelings than the cuckoo has for the owner of the nest in\nwhich she lays her eggs.\n\n\"Beat those fools!\" she ordered.  \"Beat them blue and give them no\nbreakfast!\"\n\n\"Do you see that rock over there, Lady Waldon?\" Fred answered.  \"Go and\nspread your clothes to dry.  When we've cooked food we'll send Rebecca\nto you with your share.\"\n\n\"If you send that slut to me I will kill her!\" she answered, flying\ninto a new fury.\n\n\"Whom do you call slut?\" demanded Coutlass (and he had no  compunctions\nof any kind--particularly none about women, and calling names.  He was\nsimply feeling gallant after his own fashion, and alert for a chance to\nshow off.)  Lady Waldon backed away from him.\n\n\"Of course,\" she sneered, \"if you loose your bully at me, I am no match\nat all!\"\n\nFred promptly kicked Coutlass until he ran limping out of range, to sit\nand nurse his bruises with polyglot profanity.  The Syrian Rebecca went\nover to comfort him, and eying the two of them with either malice or\nelse calculation (it was impossible to judge which) Lady Waldon\nretreated toward the rock that Fred had pointed out.\n\nWe cooked a miserable meal, neither daring to make too great inroad\ninto our stores before making sure we could replenish them, nor caring\nto make more smoke than we could help.  We hoped to escape being seen\neven by natives, but Lady Waldon upset that part of our plan by setting\nup such a scream when she saw three islanders crossing a ridge three\nhundred yards away, that they could not help hearing her, and came to\ninvestigate.  She was forced to dress faster than ever in her life\nbefore, and came running to demand that we flog all three \"to teach\nthem manners.\"  She had perfectly absorbed the German attitude toward\nall black men.\n\nFrom the natives we learned that there was no telegraph wire along\nthat coast, and that the only German settlements were semi-permanent\ncamps where they were cutting wood, for fuel for their own launch and\nfor the steamers the British were building to serve the lake ports,\nMuanza included.\n\nWith that good news for encouragement we made the three natives a small\npresent in the vain hope that they might be induced not to talk about\nus, and put to sea again. The weather was fairer and growing\nintolerably hot.  Even before the sun grew high the dhow was a\ncomfortless indecent thing, more crowded than anything Noah can have\nhad to tolerate:  and we lacked Noah's faith in omniscient guidance, in\naddition to sailing in a hotter latitude, and having more fleas on\nboard than the pair he is reported to have carried.\n\nAs we crept up-coast, leaning to this or that side when the gusts of\nwind varied, the only enviable ones were the three in the bow, posted\nthere to keep a look-out for the launch or any other enemy.  They had\nroom enough to sit without touching one another, and air to breathe\nthat mostly had not been tasted half a dozen times.  Fred, Will and\nBrown took turns commanding the foredeck look-out, keeping it awake and\nits units from quarreling.  The rest of us found no joy in life, and\nnot too much hope even when Fred's concertina lifted the refrain of\nmissionary hymn-tunes that even the porters knew, and most of us sang,\nthe porters humming wordless melancholy through their noses.  (When\nthat happened Lady Saffren Waldon's scorn was something the\narch-priests of Babylon would have paid to see.)\n\nThere was never room on the tiny after-deck for more than six people\nsitting elbow to elbow and back to back or knee to knee.  Lady Waldon\nsimply refused to yield her corner seat on any account at any time to\nany one.  Coutlass refused to leave his new sweetheart, for the\nfreely-voiced reason that then Brown might make love to her; and we\ndid not care to send both of them below for obvious reasons.  That\nreduced open-air accommodation to a minimum, because the\nreed-and-tarpaulin deck was scarcely strong enough to bear the weight\nof two men at a time, and we did not care to throw the whole deck\noverboard for fear of rain.\n\nAnd by-and-by the rain came--out of season, but no less violent because\nof that.  It rained three days and nights on end--three windless days\nand starless nights, during which we had to linger alongshore close to\nthe papyrus.  In order to keep mosquitoes out we had to light a smudge\nin the sand-box below.  The smudge added to the heat, and the heat\ndrove men to the open air to gasp a few minutes in the rain for breath\nand go down again to make room for the next in turn.\n\nSleep on shore was impossible, for thereabouts were crocodile and snake\nswamps, fuller of insect life than dictionaries are of letters.  Poling\nwas next to impossible, because the soft mud bottom gave no purchase.\nAnd the oars we made out of poles were clumsy affairs; there was not\nroom for more than two boys to try to use them at a time, even if the\ndeck would have stood the strain of more feet, which it certainly would\nnot have done.\n\nLady Waldon slept seated in her corner, with her head wrapped in a veil\nover which the mosquitoes prospected in gangs.  Coutlass and his\nlady-love endured rain and insects in the open, too, but suffered less,\nbecause of mutual distraction.  The rest of us took turns with the\nnatives below, lying packed between them, much as sardines nestle in a\ncan, wondering whether the famous Black Hole of Calcutta was really\nsuch a record-breaker as they say.  Brown was of the opinion that the\nBlack Hole was a nosegay compared to our lot--\"Besides which, they\nprobably had rum with 'em!\" he added.\n\nSome of the porters grew sick under the strain of heat, fear,\nexcitement and inactivity.  The native suffers as much from\nunaccustomed inconvenience as the white man, and more from close\nconfinement.  The third night out the man next me began coughing,\nshaking my frame as much as his own as he racked himself, for we were\nwedged together with only the thickness of his blanket and mine between\nus, and I was jammed tight against the ship's side.  Toward morning he\ngrew quiet--grew colder, too.  When dawn came we found that he had\ncoughed up the most of his lungs on my white English blanket.\n\nI gave them the blanket to bury him in, and we poled the Queen of Sheba\ninshore to find a place to dig a hole, leaving the body stretched on\nsome tree-roots while we prospected.  We should have known enough by\nthat time to leave four or five men on guard close by; as it was, when\nthe men still on board the dhow began kicking up a babel, Fred and I\ncame running and jumping back through the marsh just in time to see a\ncrocodile wriggle off into the water, with the corpse in his jaws feet\nfirst.  Fred fired a shotted salute, but missed, and that ended that\nfuneral.\n\nBy day we passed villages on higher ground, where we might have\nprocured more food if we had dared run the risk of meeting Germans.  It\nwas likely enough the villagers were so used to dhows that they would\nnot trouble to report having seen us in the distance; but it was\nperfectly certain that if we paid them a visit they would pass word\nalong from mouth to mouth with that astonishing, undiscoverable ease\nthat is at once the blessing and bane of governments.\n\nSo Fred wasted hot hours with the only rifle, trying to hunt meat on a\nshore where all the four-legged game had been ran down by the natives,\nor butchered by the German machine-guns long ago (for to teach Sudanese\nmercenaries the art of rapid fire in action their officers marched them\nout to practise on herds of antelope.  There was game in plenty away\nfrom the lake, but none where the German officer could conveniently\npractise his profession.)\n\nWe tried to shoot ducks and geese; but a rifle at long range is not\nthe best weapon for that sport.  We shot very few, and then only to\ndiscover the invincible repugnance natives have to eating \"dagi\" as\nthey call all birds.  We kept ourselves alive, but did not solve the\nproblem of the ever-diminishing supplies of rice for our men.\n\nSomebody thought of fishing.  We found hooks in a crevice in the Queen\nof Sheba's bow, and made lines from a frayed rope.  But although the\nshore was lined with traps in which the inhabitants no doubt took fish\nin proper season, all that we caught was one miserable finny specimen,\nall head and mouth and tail, that the natives said would poison any one\nwho ate it.  The truth was, of course, that they preferred rice to\nanything, and, African native-like, would eat nothing else as long as\nrice was to be had, having no earthly notions of economy.  When the\nrice was all gone on the fifth day out of Muanza they raided a banana\nplantation before we knew what they were up to, and came back gorged,\nwith bunches enough to feed them for two or three more days.\n\nThe fat was in the fire then, of course.  We paid the owners\nhandsomely, giving them their choice of money or blankets when they\nbore down on us in long canoes demanding vengeance.  They voted for\nblankets and money, but vowed they would far rather have the bananas,\nbecause now their own people would be on short commons to make up for\nthe surfeit of ours.\n\nWe left them never doubting that they would send word to the nearest\nGerman officer. (They told us there was a wood-cutting station within a\n\"few hours,\" and we prayed he might be only a non-commissioned man in\ncharge of it, but knew that prayer was too sweetly reasonable to be\nanswered where the German Gott makes war on foreigners.)  Kazimoto\nassured us he heard them telling one another they would make complaint\nagainst us within the day.\n\nIt remained, then, only to guess where that steam launch might be.  We\nwere approaching the northern end of Ukerewe, not a day's sail, if the\nlight wind held, from the narrow mouth of the channel between Ukerewe\nand the mainland.  That was the likeliest place for the launch to lie\nin wait; it was where we would have waited had we been pursuers and\nthey the pursued.  So we decided after a council of war to put the helm\nover and sail almost due westward, hoping to meet with an island where\nwe might stop for a few days, catch fish and dry them, and caulk the\nleaky dhow, without the risk of letting the Germans know our\nwhereabouts.  (It is a peculiar fact that whatever the native secret\nsystem of transferring messages may be, it does not work across water.)\n\nNot all the little gods of Africa were fighting for the Germans,\nalthough it began to seem so.  An hour after putting up the helm we\nsighted a school of hippopotami--fifty at least, and for half a day we\nchased them, Fred trying to shoot one until Will and I objected to\nfurther waste of ammunition.  A dead hippo would have provided us with\nmeat enough for a month for the whole ship's company.  We could have\ntowed the carcass ashore somewhere and dried the meat in slabs.  But\nthe glare on the water made shooting very nearly impossible (Fred's\neyes were sore from it); and if we should meet the Germans those\nremaining cartridges would be our only hope.  But the diversion took us\nout of sight of land, and that stood us in better stead presently than\ntons of fresh meat.\n\nWhether the Germans heard us, or were merely quartering that part of\nthe lake in wait, we never knew.  Probably they heard the shooting in\nthe distance and gave chase.  At any rate, within ten minutes of Fred's\nlast wasted shot Coutlass caught sight of smoke and announced the fact\nwith his favorite oath.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!  The launch!\"\n\nAt first we were all in a stew because there was no land near, where we\nmight have beached the dhow and scattered.  It was an hour before our\nadvantage of position dawned on us, and all the while the launch\napproached us leisurely.  She had plenty of fuel; the wood was piled\nhigh above her gunwale in a stack toward the stern; but those on board\nher seemed to take more pleasure in contemplation of our\ndefenselessness than in speed.  She steamed twice around us slowly\nbefore closing in; and then we made out Schillingschen's hairy shape,\nleaning against the cord-wood with a rifle between his hands.\n\n\"Shoot him!  Shoot him, by Jiminy!\" urged Coutlass, but Fred was not so\nprevious as that.  We were not yet on the defensive.  We counted five\nrifles, in addition to Schillingschen's protruding above the launch's\nside, and we all took cover in the hope either that they might decide\nwe were not the dhow they waited for, or else that they might come very\nclose out of curiosity.  For Fred had a plan of his own.  Rifle in\nhand, he crawled under the hot tarpaulin and lay flat on the reed deck,\nWill crawling after him to snatch the rifle in case Fred should be hit.\n\n\"Steer straight toward 'em!\" Fred called to me, as soon as it was\nevident that the launch did not intend to pass us by.  \"Keep headed\ntoward them!\"\n\nThat was not easy in the light wind, until Schillingschen tired of\nstaring at us and gave an order to the engineer.  Then they laid the\nlaunch broadside on to our bow at about two hundred yards' range, and\nwithout a word of warning opened fire on us from all six rifles,\nSchillingschen devoting his first attention to myself at the helm.\n\nOur lone rifle cracked in reply, but they could not see Fred and did\nnot guess where to shoot in order to search him out.  They came no\nnearer, but circled slowly around us, only Schillingschen's bullets\nappearing to come anywhere near the target, until a yell from below\nshowed what their real plan was and I understood why the sail was not\nripped and no bullets whistled overhead.        They were shooting\nthrough the planking of the dhow, endeavoring to massacre the helpless\ncrowd below, and no doubt to sink her and drown us as soon as she was\nfull enough of holes.\n\nA wounded Nyamwezi came scrambling on deck, spouting blood from his\nneck and crazed with fear.  He jumped overboard and tried to swim\ntoward the launch, but one of the Germans hit him in the head at the\nthird shot and he disappeared.  Then one of Schillingschen's elephant\nbullets slit my sleeve, and the next one pierced my helmet.\n\n\"Put one into Schillingschen, Fred!\" I shouted, but Fred did not\nanswer.  He kept up a very steady succession of shots that were doing\nno good at all that I could see.\n\nAnother German bullet found its mark below deck in the thigh of the\nGoanese.  He might have known enough to lie quiet, having some alleged\nwhite blood in him, but instead he, too, came struggling to the\nafter-deck, bellowing like a mad-man.  Coutlass knocked him back below\nwith a blow on the chin, and he there and then threw the whole crowd\ninto a panic by screaming and kicking.  They all began to try to swarm\ntogether through the narrow opening, and those in the rear tore at the\nreed deck.\n\nInto that pandemonium went Coutlass, armed with nothing but Hellenic\nfury, thoughtful of nothing but his lady-love--surely reckless of his\nown skin.  He beat, kicked, bit, scragged, banged their foolish heads\ntogether, cursed, spat, gouged, and strangled as surely no catamount\never did.  Brown leaped in to lend a hand, and into the midst of that\ninferno three more bullets penetrated, each wounding a man.  Lady\nWaldon, mad with some idiotic strategy of her own sudden devising,\nseized the tiller and tried to wrench it from my hand.  The Syrian\nRebecca, imagining new treachery and fearful for her Greek lover, tried\nto prevent her with teeth and nails.  The Germans raised a war-whoop of\nwild enjoyment.  And just at the height of all that, Fred's\nthree-and-twentieth shot went home.\n\nThere was a loud report, followed by instant nothing except stampede on\nthe part of the Germans to get out of reach of something.  Then the\nsomething grew denser; invisible hot vapor became a pall of steam that\nbid the launch from view, three more shots from Fred's rifle finding\nthe proper mark by sheer accident, for there was another explosion;\nthe cloud increased and the launch stopped dead.\n\n\"That gray sheet of metal wasn't her boiler at all!\" Fred shouted back\nto me.  \"The first shot pierced the boiler when I found out where to\naim!  I think three of them are scalded badly--hope so!--high pressure\nsteam--superheated--did you see?  Now leave 'em to find their own way\nhome!\"\n\n\"See if you can't get Schillingschen!\" said I.\n\nBut Schillingschen was invisible in the white cloud, and Fred refused\nto waste one of the half-dozen cartridges remaining.  The light wind\nthat bore us away from the launch also spread the screen of steam\nbetween us and them.  A shot or two from Schillingschens rifle proved\nhim to be still alive, and still determined, but missed us by so much\nthat we began to dare to sit upright.  Then Fred went below to sort out\nwounded men, plug holes in the dhow, and stop the panic, and we all\nprayed for wind with a fervor they never exceeded in Nelson's fleet.\n\nWhen Will had gone below to help Fred, the panic had ceased, two dead\nmen had been thrown overboard, and six of the crew had been set to work\nbailing in deadly earnest to keep ahead of the new leaks, there was\ntime to consider the position and to realize how hugely better off we\nwere than if the launch had caught us somewhere close inshore.  Now we\ncould sail safely northward, every puff of wind carrying us nearer to\nBritish water and safety, whereas unless they could mend that\nhigh-pressure boiler, they would have to lie there for a week, or a\nmonth--die unless some one came in search of them.  Had we holed their\nboiler near the shore they would have been able to take to the land\nuntil they found canoes.  Good canoes, well manned, could have\noverhauled us hand over fist like terriers after a rat.\n\nIt was fifteen minutes yet before we were out of rifle range, and\nSchillingschen tried to make the most of them when the steam thinned,\nexposing his beefy carcass recklessly.  But by the time it had thinned\ndown sufficiently to let him really see us we were too far away to make\nsure shooting.  He slit the sail, giving us half a night's work to mend\nit, and made three more holes in our planking, but hurt nobody.\n\nThat was the only launch the German government had on the lake in those\ndays, an almost perfect toy with an aluminum hull and more up-to-date\ngadgets on her machinery than a battleship's engineer could have\nexplained the purpose of in a watch.  They had lavished a whole\nappropriation on one show.  From the minute we were out of range of\nSchillingschen's big-bore elephant gun we ran risk of starvation, and\nperhaps surprise, but no longer of pursuit, and we headed the Queen of\nSheba as nearly as we could guess for British East with feelings that\neven Lady Waldon shared, for she grew distantly polite again, and\ncomplimented Fred on his cool nerve and accurate shooting.\n\nWe should have suspected treachery, for she made no attempt to\nretaliate on Rebecca for scratching her face.  Unnatural inaction\nshould have put us on our guard.  She even went so far as to compliment\nthe maid on \"finding such a great, strong, brave man as Coutlass to\ncherish her.\"  The Greek simply cooed at that--threw out his great\nchest and rearranged with his fingers the whiskers that had almost\ntotally disguised him.\n\n(There was not one of us but looked like a pirate by that time.  The\nnatives of that part of Africa shave every particle of hair from their\nbodies whenever they get the chance, and prefer their heads as shiny\nand naked as any other part of them.  But the German prison system,\ndevised to break the spirit of whoever came within its clutches,\nincluded prohibition of shaving, so that we had the woolliest crowd of\npassengers imaginable.)\n\nWe found it impossible to help being sorry for Lady Waldon, or even for\nthe maid, who suffered in spite of Coutlass's kisses and strong arms.\nThe obvious fact that the dhow was no place for a woman made us\noverlook the conduct of both of them over and over again, shutting eyes\nand ears to Lady Waldon's meanness and the maid's increasing impudence.\n\nLady Waldon actually began to set her own cap at Coutlass, encouraging\nhim to boast to the porters, and pretending to admire the gift with\nwhich he told them tales in Kiswahili that would have made even her\nblush if she had understood the half of them.  At intervals the maid\ngrew jealous, and had to be kissed back to serenity by Coutlass, who\nwas no less in love with her because of any mere addition to the number\nof his interests.  He could have made hot love to six women, and have\nenjoyed it.  There were times when he really flattered himself that\nLady Waldon admired his looks and fine physique.\n\nFood was now the chief concern.  We trailed a fishing line behind us,\nbut caught nothing.  Brown said there were too many crocodiles for fish\nto be plentiful, but on the other hand, Kazimoto, who surely should\nhave known, swore that the water was full of big fish, and that the\nislanders lived on little else.  Whatever the truth of it, we caught\nnothing; and when we reached an island whose shore was lined with\nfish-traps made of stakes and basket-work we searched all the traps in\nvain.  The natives we saw in the distance all ran away from us, and\nthere were no crops that we could see of any kind, which rather bore\nout Kazimoto's story.\n\n\"Crocks' eggs are what those savages eat, I tell you!\" Brown insisted.\n\"They're wholesome and don't taste worse than a rotten hen's egg.\"  We\noffered him his own price if he would eat one himself in the presence\nof us all; but hungry though we were all beginning to be, he refused,\nand we needed his example.\n\nAfter that first island we began to sail among a regular archipelago,\nmost of them scarcely better than granite rocks on which the crocodiles\ncould crawl to sun themselves, but some of them a half-mile long, or\nlonger.  Nearly all of them were barren, but at last, when we judged\nourselves well inside the British portion of the lake, we came on a\nvery large one that had a mountain in the middle of it, and contained a\nfair-sized village hidden among trees.\n\nIt was dark, and we were all famished when we reached it, so when we\nhad poled the dhow into a little bay between granite boulders big\nenough to hide her, mast and all, we went ashore, made fires, and\nserved out the last handfuls of rice, skimping our own allowance to\nincrease those of the porters, whose larger stomachs afforded vaster\nyearning power.  They were pitiably meager rations--a mere jest--an\ninsult to hungry men; but we found before we had cooked and finished\nthem that we had witnesses who thought us fortunate.\n\nThey came so silently that even the porters did not notice them at\nfirst--gaunt black shadows flitting in the deeper shadows, and coming\npresently to squat outside the edge of the circle of firelight, until a\ntribe, men, women and little children, were all gathered around us\nburning up the darkness with their eyes.\n\nThey were hungrier than we!  Our food, that looked so scant to us, to\nthem was a very feast of the gods!  They all had pieces of leather or\nplaited grass drawn tight around their middles to lessen the pangs of\nhunger, and the chief, who sat rather apart from the rest, gnawed at a\npiece of bark.\n\nNone of them wore any clothes.  Those that had goat-skin aprons had\nthem on behind, and they were as free from self-consciousness as the\ntrees in winter.  Some of them had spears, and they all had knives, yet\nnone offered violence, or as much as begged.  There were three or four\nhundred of them, at the lowest reckoning, yet they allowed us to finish\nour meal in the dark in peace.\n\nThere was nothing to say when we had finished.  We knew what the matter\nwas, and they knew we knew.  We had nothing to share with them, and\nthey knew that, for they could see the empty rice bags that the porters\nhad shaken and beaten to get out the very dust.  We did not know their\nlanguage; even Kazimoto professed himself ignorant of any dozen words\nthat could unlock their understanding.\n\nPresently, under the eyes of all of them, Fred got out the rifle from\nits wrappings and proceeded to clean and oil it carefully, as every\ngenuine hunter should before he sleeps.\n\nThen it was evident at once that new hope for some reason had been born\namong that silent crowd.  The chief, uninvited, drew nearer and watched\nevery detail of Fred's husbandry with glittering eye.\n\n\"Give him the oily rag to suck!\" suggested Brown, but that proved not\nto be the key to his interest, for he thrust the rag back into Fred's\nhand and motioned to him to continue cleaning.\n\nFinally Fred examined the last handful of cartridges carefully one by\none, and filled the magazine.  Then, after making sure the sights were\nin order, he began to wrap the rifle again.\n\nBut at that the chief held out a lean long arm and stopped him.\nCoutlass sprang to his feet in a hurry, imagining that was a signal to\nattack at last, but Fred ordered him to sit down, and Lady Waldon, who\nseemed possessed for the once by uncanny calmness, asked him to give\nher an arm to the dhow, where she proposed to try to sleep.  Coutlass\nfelt flattered, and obeyed.  The maid got up and followed them both in\na fury of jealousy, and they three were lost to view in a moment among\nthe shadows cast by our four flickering fires.  The other Greek got up\nand followed them, leaving the Goanese already snoozing by the fire.\n\nThen, just as the half of a brilliantly pale moon rose above the\npapyrus, the chief came a pace nearer and touched Fred's hand.  Then he\nbeckoned.  Then he touched the hand again and retreated backward.\nGlancing around I saw the shadows that were his tribe leaning toward us\nin strained attention, with eyes for nothing but their chief and Fred.\nUnderstanding there was something that the chief desired him to go and\ndo, Fred passed the rifle to Will and rose to his feet.\n\nWith patience that was simply pathetic the chief shook his head and\ntried to explain something in weary-motioned pantomime.  Fred took the\nrifle back from Will.  The chief nodded.  Fred started to follow him,\nand then the whole tribe sighed, with a sound like the evening wind\nrustling through the papyrus.\n\nIt being clear now that he was to shoot something, Fred took the\nwrappings off the rifle, threw them to me, and walked into the dark,\nthe chief trotting ahead like a phantom and glancing back to beckon\nabout once a minute.  Not caring to miss the play, we followed in\nIndian file, I bringing up the rear.\n\nThe whole tribe rose at once and flitted along beside us on our\nlandward side.  We could not hear a footfall, or a breath.  They passed\nthrough dry grass without rustling, neither stumbling nor crowding one\nanother, but all so governed by one all-absorbing thought that they\nacted in absolute unison.  That the thought was food did not, even in\ntheir starving state, make them forget the crowning need for silence.\nWe with our leather boots made more noise than all they together.\n\nWe passed along the lake shore for half a mile, until suddenly the\nchief, looking tall as a stripped tree in the pale uncertain light,\nthrew up an arm and waved it in a circle.  Instantly the whole tribe\nvanished.  It was as if a puff of wind had blown them; or as if they\nhad been figures thrown on a screen by a magic lantern and suddenly\nswitched off at the performer's whim. Then the chief continued forward,\nwe marching more carefully.\n\nNow he turned to the half-right and followed a narrow track across a\nneck of land that jutted out into the lake.  We approached a low rise,\nand as he drew near the top of that he went down on hands and knees,\ncrawling up the last few yards so cautiously that I had to stare hard\nto be sure he was there at all.\n\nAs soon as Fred came near he made frantic signals to him to get down\nand crawl too; so we all knelt down and crawled behind Fred, striving\nto make no noise and filling the unhappy chief so full of fury at the\nnoise we did make that he writhed in nervous torment.\n\nOn top of the rise Fred stopped and in imitation of the chief thrust\nhis head forward very gradually.  One by one we followed suit until,\nlying prone in line along the ridge within thirty paces of the water,\nwe saw at last what we were after.\n\nBathed in the moonlight, head and shoulders clear of the mirror-like\nwater, a great bull hippopotamus surveyed the scenery, drinking in\ncontentment through his little placid eyes.  Out there nothing troubled\nhim, as for instance the mosquitoes troubled us.  He had eaten his\nfill, for some sort of green stuff hung from his jaws; and he was\nbeginning to feel sleepy, for he opened his enormous mouth and yawned\nstraight toward us--three tons of meat on the hoof, less than a hundred\nyards away, stock-still, and unsuspicious!\n\nThe chief began whispering unintelligible warnings in a voice so low\nthat it sounded like the drone of insects.  Fred thrust the rifle\nforward inch by inch and, taking his time about it, settled himself\ncomfortably for the shot.  It was no easy shot in that uncertain light\nat a downward angle.  The glare of the sun on the lake had troubled his\neyes during the last few days.  The shimmer of the moonlight was\ndeceptive now.  I wished he would pass the rifle to Will, or even to\nBrown of Lumbwa, who was digging his fingers into the earth beside me\nin almost uncontrollable excitement.  But Fred was unperturbed, and the\nchief, who was nervous enough to detect the slightest sign of\nnervousness in Fred, did not seem to mistrust him for one second.\n\nThree times I saw Fred breathe deeply, as if about to squeeze the\ntrigger, but each time he was only \"makkin' sikkar,\" and eased his\nlungs again.  The target a hippo offers to a Mauser rifle bullet is not\nmuch more than half the size of a man's hand, including only the ear\nand eye and the narrow space between them.  By daylight at a hundred\nyards that is nothing for a cool shot to complain about, but in\nhalf-moonlight, at that angle, it is none too much.  I swore silently,\nwishing again and again that Fred would pass the rifle to Will, or to\nBrown--or to me!  Yet if he had passed it to me I should have trembled\nworse than any one.\n\nVisions began to haunt me of what would happen if Fred should miss!\nWhat would the effect be on wild folk tortured by hunger and keyed to\nthe pitch of frenzy by suspense?  Then, even while we watched, another\nproblem added itself.  Over on the water there began to come a wind,\ndriving ripples and little waves in front of it.  The moment those came\nnear the hippo he would vanish from view, for they only care for\nmoonlight when they can see it mirrored on a perfectly still surface.\n\nI cursed Fred between set teeth, almost loud enough for him to hear me;\nfor the hippo did move.  His head was a foot nearer water-level; he\nhad seen or heard something that alarmed him.  He was in the act of\nsinking under water when Fred made sure of the sights at last and the\nrifle spoke, ringing out into the still night like the crack of\nJudgment Day, more startling because we had waited so long for it in\nsuch suspense.\n\nInstantly the amazing happened.  A yell burst out behind us that split\nthe night apart.  Where stilly blackness had been, now four or five\nhundred crazy shadows leaped and danced, murdering the silence with\nmarrow-curdling noises intended to express joy.\n\nOut on the water the stricken hippo pitched head downward and plunged\nlike a mountain of meat gone mad, thrashing up great waves that were\ndarkened with his life-blood.  A whole herd, several hundred strong,\nemerged shoulder-high from the water to take one swift look at him and\nflee.  The arriving wind overswept the little whirlpools they all made\nin the moonlight, as they dived to seek seclusion somewhere and no\ndoubt to choose themselves a new bully after terrific fighting.\n\nOur quarry plunged a last time, and stayed under.  Now was new anxiety.\nIn twenty minutes or half an hour he should rise to the surface again,\nbut no man could guess where, and the wind and currents would very\nswiftly hide his great carcass somewhere amid the acres of papyrus\nunless sharp eyes were alert.\n\nBut the papyrus was friend as well as foe.  In a space of time to be\nmeasured by seconds the yelling young men of the tribe had uncovered\nthree canoes, hidden from marauding enemies among the\nmore-than-man-high reeds, and the rest of the tribe--men, women and\nyoung ones--scattered along the shore to watch from between the stalks.\n\nIn less than fifteen minutes some one yelled, and even the very old\nmen, who had stayed beside us to gape at Fred's rifle and our clothes\nand boots, began running like hares toward the sound.  In twenty\nminutes after that, with the aid of grass ropes and leather thongs,\nthey had hauled the huge carcass to the shore and rolled it out of the\nwater, where it lay glistening in moonlight, stumpy, foolish, legs\nuppermost.\n\nThe butcher's work----the feast--did not begin yet.  There was\ntime-honored custom to obey, which Kazimoto knew all about even if\nthose ignorant wachenzie* would have fallen to without ceremony.  He\ndrove them off.  A white man had slain that animal; therefore the\nwhite man's choice of meat was first, and he very leisurely and\nskillfully cut out the enormous tongue for us and fifty pounds of meat\nfor our following before he would let them as much as touch the carcass\nwith a dagger.   [* Plural of machenzie, \"man from 'way back,'\"\n\"rube,\" \"simp.\"]\n\nThen, though, the tribe fell to, naked, with little naked\nknives--tearing off the thick hide in foot-wide strips, and hacking the\nred flesh into lumps that they ate, raw and quivering, while they\nworked.  The little bits of children, each chewing raw bloody meat,\nbrought baskets for the overflow, dragging them to wherever they could\nfind a space between the legs of struggling men, the women emptying the\nbaskets almost as fast as the children filled them, and chewing until\ntheir jaws ran blood.\n\nNothing was wasted.  The blood was caught in pools in part of the hide,\nspread like an apron on the earth, and lapped up by whoever could get\nto it.  The very guts were gathered up in baskets to be cooked.  And\nwhere the last little soft iron dagger had done its work, the blood had\nbeen drunk, and the last scrap of hide bad been cut into strips, to be\nchewed when the meat and its memory were things of the past, the\nenormous ribs lay glistening in the moonlight like those of an\nabandoned wreck, picked as clean as if the kites had done it.\n\n\"Have we done a commendable thing?\" laughed Fred, looking at the\ncrowd's distended paunches.  \"There's a good bull hippo the less.\nWe've saved the lives for a time of several hundred gluttons.  They\nknow neither grace nor gratitude.\"\n\nBut he was wrong.  They did.  They brought Fred a woman--their fattest,\nugliest; which means she was skin and bone and uglier than Want, also\nshe was more afraid of Fred than Satan is said to be of shriving.  The\nchief led her by the hand, she hanging back and hiding her face under\none arm (which left the rest of her nakedness unprotected).  He seized\nFred's hand and put the woman's in it.\n\n\"Now you're spliced!\" Brown explained.  \"Married to the gal forever in\npresence of legal witnesses!\"\n\nKazimoto confirmed the fearful news.\n\n\"Married in regular form an' accord with tribal custom!\"  Brown\ncontinued, nodding solemnly.\n\n\"Divorce me--soon and swiftly, somebody!\" Fred demanded.\n\nWe appealed to Kazimoto for information, but only threw him into a\nquandary, and he proceeded to add to ours.  The usual price for a\nwoman, it seemed, was cows--many or few according as she was lovely or\nher father rich. In case of divorce, custom decreed that the cows with\ntheir offspring should be given back.  The objection to any other\nproperty than cows changing hands to bind or loose in wedlock was that\nfood, for instance, when eaten was not returnable.\n\n\"Married to the gal for good an! all!\"' Brown grinned, nudging Will and\nme to note Fred's consternation.  \"You'd better stay here an' take the\nchief's job when he kicks the bucket--possibly you can speed the day by\noverfeedin' him!\"\n\n\"Some men's luck,\" Will murmured, but stopped in mid-sentence, for\ninterruption came in the form of a weird figure, gesticulating like a\nwindmill, stumbling and careening through the gloom, shouting as it\ncame.  Not until it was thirty yards away did an intelligible sound\nexplain at least who the apparition was.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!  Give me that gun!\"\n\nCoutlass burst in among us so out of breath that he could not force\nthrough his teeth another rational syllable, but he made his intentions\npartly clear by snatching at Fred's rifle, persisting until Will and I\npulled him off.\n\n\"The dhow's gone!\" he panted at last.  \"Give me that rifle, or come\nyourself!  Hurry!  There's a wind!  You'll be too late!\"\n\n\"You're dreaming or drunk!\" Fred answered, but Coutlass refused to be\ndisbelieved, and in another moment we were all running as fast as we\ndared through the darkness toward the camp-fires, where we had left the\nGoanese snoozing and the dhow snugly moored among the rocks.\n\nThe chief and his followers far outdistanced us in spite of their\ngorged condition--all except the woman, who jogged dutifully, although\nunhappily, behind Fred.  When we reached the campfires they were\nstanding gazing out on the lake, where we could just make out the\nbellying sail of the Queen of Sheba leaning like a phantom away from\nthe gaining wind.  The distance was not to be judged in that weak\nuncertain light.  We all shouted together, but there came no answer and\nwe could not tell whether the sound carried as far as the dhow or not.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!--why don't you shoot!\" shouted Coutlass, dancing up and\ndown the bank in frenzy.  \"Give me that rifle!  I'll show you!  I'll\nteach them!\"\n\nI believe I would have fired if the rifle had been in my hands.  Brown,\nlast to arrive and most out of breath, joined with Coutlass in angry\nshouts for vengeance.  Will offered no argument against sending them a\nparting shot.  Fred set the butt of the rifle down with a determined\nsnort, walked over toward the fire, stirred the embers, threw on more\nfuel, and looked about him when the dry wood blazed.\n\n\"If she has left as much as one blanket among the lot of us, I don't\nsee it anywhere!\" he said, taking his seat on a rock.\n\n\"A blanket?\" sneered Coutlass.  \"She has even your money!  Worse than\nthat--she has my woman!  You were a gum-gasted galoot not to shoot at\nher!\"\n\nFred patted the bulging pocket of his shooting jacket.\n\n\"Most of the money is here,\" he said quietly, and we all sighed with\nrelief.\n\n\"Take canoes and chase them!\" shouted Coutlass, beginning to dance up\nand down again.\n\n\"There's time enough\" Fred answered.  \"We know the winds of these parts\nwell enough by this time.  This will blow until midnight.  Then calm\nuntil dawn.  After dawn a little more wind for an hour or two, then\ndoldrums again until late afternoon.  They'll run on a rock in all\nlikelihood.  If they do we can catch them at our leisure, supposing we\ncan get these islanders to paddle.  If it should blow hard, then we\ncan't catch them anyhow.  Sit down and tell us what happened, Coutlass!\"\n\nThe Greek cursed and swore and pranced, but all in vain.  Fred was\ninexorable.  We others grew calmer when the problem of who should\npaddle the canoes solved itself suddenly with the arrival of fourteen\nof our own men.  Discovering themselves left behind, they had run along\nthe bank in vain hope of catching the dhow somehow--perchance of\nswimming through the crocodile-infested water, and returned now\ndisconsolate, to leap and laugh with new hope at sight of us and of the\nred meat that Kazimoto had thrown on the ground near the fire.  They\ncame near in a cluster.  Will hacked off a lump of meat for them, and\nthey forthwith forgot their troubles, as instantly as the birds forget\nwhen a sparrow-hawk has done murder down a hedge-row and swooped away.\n\nNot everything was gone after all.  Kazimoto found the pots we had\ncooked the rice in, and started to boil the hippo's tongue for us.\n\n\"Come, Coutlass--sit down before we eat and tell us what happened,\"\nFred suggested.\n\nThe Greek paced up and down another time or two, and at last calmed\nhimself sufficiently to laugh at Fred's woman, who had squatted down\npatiently in the shadow behind him.\n\n\"Easy for you!\" he grinned savagely, squatting on the far side of the\nfire.  \"You have a woman!  Mine is God knows where!  She said to\nme--that hell-damned Lady Saffren Waldon said to me--we sat all three\ntogether in the stern of the dhow, I with my arm around Rebecca, and\nshe said to me--\"\n\n\"I'll see if I can't make a dicker for the chief's canoes,\" Will\ninterrupted.    \"We can hear the Greek's tale any old time.\"\n\n\"Trade my woman for them!\" Fred suggested cheerfully.  \"Go on,\nCoutlass!\"\n\nThe Greek gritted his teeth savagely.  \"She said--that hell-damned Lady\nSaffren Waldon said, as we sat there in the dhow, 'How about the\nkicking Fred Oakes gave you on the island, Mr. Coutlass?  Where is your\nGreek honor?'--Do you see?  She worked on my bodily bruises and my\nspiritual courage at the same time--the cunning hussy!  'That Fred\nOakes will win this Rebecca away from you very soon!' she went on.  'I\nhave watched him.\"'\n\nFred smiled about as comfortably as a martyr on the grid.  The presence\nof the dusky damsel, confirmed by her smell behind him, made him touchy\non the subject of sex.\n\n\"Presently she said to me, 'I have my own affairs that will adjust\nthemselves all the better for their absence when I get to British East.\nAs for you, they will simply report you to the authorities for raiding\nthose cattle of Brown's.  Can you imagine that creature Brown forgiving\nyou?  He will have you thrown in jail!  Why wait?  But we must not\nleave the Goanese or the other porters, and we must hurry!  You go,'\nshe said, 'and send the Goanese and the rest of the porters on board!'\n\n\"So I did go.  I kicked de Sousa awake, and he cursed me, because my\ntoe landed once or twice on his thigh where the bullet wounded him.  I\ndrove him on board, and she put him to work with Kamarajes getting up\nthe sail.  Then I went off to get those cursed porters.  I could not\nfind them!  The dogs had gone to the village, to find women I don't\ndoubt!  I tell you what I would do to them if they were mine!\"\n\n\"Never mind that!\" Fred cut in.  We could all guess what form the\npunishment would take.  \"Get on with the tale!  You couldn't find the\nporters.  What next?\"\n\n\"I decided to leave the dogs behind, and serve them right!  I went back\nto the dhow in a great hurry.  She was gone!  Vanished!  Disappeared as\nif the lake had opened up and swallowed her!  I could just see the sail\nin the distance.  I shouted!  No answer!  I shouted again.  I heard\nRebecca call to me!  Then I heard laughter--Lady Isobel Saffren\nWaldon's laughter!  Gassharamminy!  I will run red-hot skewers into\nthat woman when I catch her!  Do you see how she has vengeance on\nRebecca?  Do you see now why she took sides between me and Kamarajes\nand de Sousa?  Do you see how she has plotted?  What will she do now?\nWhat Will she do?\"\n\nHe began to pace up and down again furiously, shaking both fists at the\nunresponsive stars.\n\n\"She will do Rebecca an injury!  She will give that girl to de Sousa or\nto that old Kamarajes!  We shall never catch them!  Gassharamminy!  Oh,\nAbsalom!  You should have fired when I told you!  That she-dog has a\ntrick of some kind up her sleeve yet!  How shall we catch her?  Why do\nwe wait?  Give me that rifle!  I will take a canoe and go after them\nalone!  You do not know what Greek spirit is!  I am American\nsometimes--English when it suits me--always Greek when I am wronged!\"\n\n\"You certainly have been put upon\" Fred answered.  \"Tell us how your\nGreek spirit justified deserting us.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" snarled Coutlass.  \"Do you love me?  What would you do to me\nif you could get me to British East in your power?  You would hand me\nover as a cattle thief!\"\n\n\"You bet I will!\" admitted Brown of Lumbwa.  \"You dog, you've ruined\nme!\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" demanded Coutlass.  \"Why, then, should I not\nlook out for myself?\"\n\n\"I think we'd better leave you on this island,\" Fred told him quietly.\n\"We can't trust you out of sight.  The only way to prevent you from\nstealing this rifle and murdering us all would be to lie awake in\nturns.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" grinned the Greek, striding back toward the fire.  \"How many\ncartridges have you left?  Five, eh?  After I had murdered all of you,\nhow many would remain?\"\n\n\"You'll have to think of a better argument than that,\" smiled Fred, and\nfor the first time I suspected he was speaking in deadly earnest.\nCoutlass suspected it, too, and grew still.  The sweat burst out on his\nface, and his eyes bulged from their sockets.\n\n\"You will leave me here?\" he stammered.\n\nFred nodded, smiling up at him.\n\n\"You see, you're such on all-in scoundrel!\" Brown assured him.\n\n\"You!  You poor drunkard!\" Coutlass turned his back on Brown, and faced\nFred squarely.  \"You are a man, Mr. Oakes!  I can speak to you as to my\nbrother.\"\n\nFred smiled blandly.\n\n\"I will speak to you God's truth!\"\n\nFred grinned.\n\n\"I will tell you where the ivory is!\"\n\nFred threw his head back and laughed outright.\n\n\"I speak to you on my honor!  That mother of misery, Lady Saffren\nWaldon, stole a map from Shillingschen.  Before I would agree to set\nthe town on fire I made her give me that for a hostage, lest she should\nprove treacherous and leave me behind after all!  I have it now!  It is\nmarked with a circle to show where Schillingschen believes the stuff\nmust be, because he has searched everywhere else!\"\n\n\"If that map is worth anything,\" Fred countered, \"how did Lady Saffren\nWaldon care to leave you behind with it?\"\n\n\"The harridan forgot it!\" answered Coutlass.  \"She was so delighted to\nget vengeance on Rebecca by taking her away from me that she did not\ncare for anything else!  She hates you!  She hates me!  She hates\nRebecca!  Those who hate--as I can hate!--would rather have revenge\nthan all the riches of Africa!  Do you think I would hesitate between\nmoney and revenge on her?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Fred answered.  \"The map, then--what about it?\"\n\n\"Take me with you and the map is yours!\"\n\n\"Show it to me, then!\"\n\n\"I must have a share of the ivory!\"\n\n\"Show me the map first!\"\n\nCoutlass searched inside his flannel shirt--swiftly--more\nswiftly--angrily.  His jaw dropped.  Even between the fire-light and\nthe moonlight one could judge that his color changed--and changed again.\n\n\"Show me the map before we bargain!\" Fred insisted.  \"Hurry, man!\nThere's Mr. Yerkes with the canoe.  We can't wait here all night!\"\n\n\"It is gone!\" admitted Coutlass.  \"Some one stole it!\"\n\n\"I could have told you that in the first place,\" Fred informed him,\nrising to his feet.  \"I have the map in my pocket.\"\n\n\"You stole it?\" Coutlass gasped.\n\n\"Certainly not.  Rebecca stole it while she was supposed to be sleeping\nin your arms!\"\n\n\"Gassharamminy!  I might have known it!  Those Syrians--she meant to\ngive us all the slip and find the ivory herself!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the Sort!\" said Fred.  \"She stole it from you, to give it\nto Lady Saffren Waldon!  Kazimoto saw her do it--saw where Lady Waldon\nhid it--and stole it from her while she slept to give to me, believing\nit to be something of mine.  Here it is!\"\n\nFred let the end of a folded map protrude from his inner pocket just\nfar enough for Coutlass to recognize it by the fire-light.  The Greek\nturned on his heel.\n\n\"All right!\" he said ruefully, swinging suddenly round again.  \"If you\nwere alone I would fight you, my knife against your rifle!  I can not\nfight all four of you!  Go away then, and be damned!  I have nothing to\noffer.  There is nothing I can do.  Leave me, and I will look after\nmyself!\"\n\n\"Now you're talking like a man.\" said Fred.\n\n\"Leave me that woman of yours, and go to hell, all of you!\" laughed the\nGreek.\n\nFred seemed suddenly possessed of a bright idea.  He turned to the\nwoman and beckoned her to rise.  Then in unmistakable pantomime he went\nthrough the motions of presenting her to Coutlass.  The woman\ngasped--stammered something that was positively not consent--stared\nwith frightened eyes at Coutlass--shook her shaven head violently--and\nran away into the darkness, pursued by roars of laughter that speeded\nher on her way.\n\n\"A clear case of desertion!\" announced Fred judicially.  \"You men are\nwitnesses!\"  Then he turned once more to Coutlass.  \"I don't think\nwe'll leave you to raise Cain on this island.  It depends on you\nwhether we find you a lonelier island--turn you loose or hand you over\nto the authorities in British East!\"\n\n\"Good!\" Coutlass shouted.  \"By Jingo, you are a gentleman!  You are the\nbest man in the world!  I will treat you as my brother!\"\n\n\"Thanks!\" said Fred dryly.\n\n\"Aren't you men ever coming?\" asked Will, striding out of the shadows.\n\"I've made the dicker--found a man who'd been on the mainland and knows\nSwahili.  The chief's agreeable to loan us two canoes in place of\ndeeding you the woman.  I took your name in vain, Fred, and consented\nto that while your back was turned--kick all you like--the deed is\ndone!  Four of his savages come with us as far as we want to go, we\nfeeding 'em meat and paying 'em money.  It's agreed they're to eat just\nas often as we do.  They paddle the canoes back home when we're through\nwith them.  Are you all ready?  Then all aboard!  Let's hurry!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\n\"MANY THAT ARE FIRST SHALL BE LAST; AND THE LAST FIRST--\"\n\n  When the last of the luck has deserted and the least of the chances\n      has waned,\n  When there's nowhere to run to and even the pluck in the smile\n      that you carry is feigned;\n  When grimmer than yesterday's horror to-morrow dawns hungry and cold,\n  And your faith in the coming unknown is denied in regret for the\n      known and the old,\n  Then you're facing, my son, what the Fathers from Abraham down to to-day\n  Have looked on alone, and stood up to alone, and each in his several way\n  O'ercame (or he shouldn't be Father).  So ye shall o'ercome: while\n      ye live,\n  Though ye've nothing but breath and good-will to your name ye must\n      stand to it naked, and give!\n\n  Ye shall learn in that hour that the plunder ye won by profession is\n      nought--\n  And false was the aim ye aspired with--and dross was the glamour\n      ye sought--\n  The codes and the creeds that ye cherished were shadows of clouds\n      in the wind,\n  (And ye can not recall for their counsel lost leaders ye dallied\n      behind!)\n  Ye shall stand in that hour and discover by agony's guttering flame\n  How the fruits of self-will, and the lees of ambition and\n      bitterness all are the same,\n  Until, stripped of desire, ye shall know that was death.  Then the\n      proof that ye live\n  Shall be knowledge new-born that the naked--the fools and the felons,\n      can give!\n\n  Then the suns and the stars in their courses shall speedily swing\n      to your aid,\n  And nothing shall hinder you further, and nothing shall make you afraid,\n  For the veriest edges of evil shall challenge your joy, and no more,\n  And room for the right shall shine clear in your vision where wrong\n      was before.\n  Then the stones in the road shall be restful that used to be traps\n      for your feet,\n  Then the crowd shall be kind that was cruel before, and your\n      solitude sweet\n  That was want to be gloomy aforetime and gray--when the proof that ye\n      live\n  Is no longer the pain of desire, but the will--and the wit--and\n      the vision, to give!\n\n\nThe canoes were the usual crazy affairs, longer and rather wider than\nthe average.  The bottom portion of each was made from a tree-trunk,\nhollowed out by burning, and chipped very roughly into shape.  The\nsides were laboriously hewn planks, stitched into place with thread\nmade from papyrus.\n\nSome of the men left behind were our personal servants.  Counting them\nand Kazimoto, there were twenty natives remaining with us, making, with\nthe four men lent us by the chief, an allowance of twelve to each\ncanoe.  If we had had loads as well it would have been a problem how to\nget the whole party away; but as Lady Saffren Waldon had left us\nnothing but three cooking-pots, we just contrived to crowd the last man\nin without passing the danger point, Fred taking charge of the first\ncanoe with Brown of Lumbwa and Kazimoto, and leaving Coutlass with the\nother canoe to Will and me.  We agreed it was most convenient to keep\nthe Greek and the rifle separated by a stretch of water.\n\nThere is one inevitable, invariable way of starting on a journey by\ncanoe in Africa.  Somebody pushes off.  The naked paddlers, seated at\nintervals down either side, strain their toes against a thwart or a\nrib.  The leading paddler yells, and off you go with a swing and a\nrhythmic thunder as they all bring their paddles hard against the\nboat's side at the end of each stroke. Fifty--sixty--seventy--perhaps a\nhundred strokes they take at top speed, and the passenger settles down\nto enjoy himself, for there is no more captivating motion in the world.\nThen suddenly they stop, and all begin arguing at top of their lungs.\nUnless the passenger is a man of swift decision and firm purpose there\nis frequently a fight at that stage, likely to end in overturned canoes\nand an adventure among the crocodiles.\n\nOur voyage broke no precedents.  We started off in fine style, feeling\nlike old-time emperors traveling in state; and within ten minutes we\nwere using paddles ourselves to poke and beat our men into\nunderstanding of the laws of balance, they abusing one another while\nthe canoes rocked and took in water through the loosely laid on planks.\n\nThe fiber stitching began to give out very soon after that, because\nwhen not in use the canoes were always hauled out somewhere and the\ndried-out fiber cracked and broke.  We had all to sit to one side while\nsome one restitched the planking.  Later, when a wind came up and the\nquick short sea arose peculiar to lakes, we were very glad we had done\nthat job so early.\n\nIt was only the first mile that as much as suggested enjoyment.  Never\naccustomed to much paddling in any case, our own men had suffered from\nhunger and confinement in the reeking hot dhow.  Then, hippo meat needs\nhours of cooking to be wholesome (our own share of it was still in the\npot, waiting to be boiled more thoroughly at the next halting place).\nThey had merely toasted their tough lumps in the camp-fire embers and\ngobbled it.  The result was a craving for sleep, noisily seconded by\nthe chief's four men, who had eaten the stuff without cooking at all,\nand in enormous quantities.\n\nWe began with a keen determination to overhaul the dhow, that dwindled\nas we had time to think the matter over; wondering what we should do\nwith two such women in case we should capture them, and how we should\nprevent Coutlass in that case from acting like a savage.\n\n\"Why don't we leave 'em to make their own explanations?\" I proposed at\nlast.  \"We can claim our few belongings at any time if we see fit.\"\nBut the suggestion took time to recommend itself.\n\nThat night until nearly morning we fretted at every rest the paddlers\ntook--drove them unmercifully--ran risks of overturning on the slippery\nshoulders of partly submerged rocks--took long turns ourselves to\nrelieve the weary men, Coutlass working harder than the rest of us.  It\nwould have been a bad night's work if we had overhauled the dhow and\nloosed him to do his will.\n\n\"Think of the baggage!\" he kept shouting to the night at large. \"Lying\nin the arms of Georges Coutlass, kissing and being kissed, simply to\nrob him--Coutlass--me!  Think of it!  Only think of it.  She lay in the\nhook of my right arm and only thought of how to win back the favor of\nthe other she-hellion!  And I was deceived by such a cabbage!  Wait\nthough!  Nobody ever turned a trick on Georges Coutlass more than once!\nWait till we catch them!  See what I do to them!  I don't forget\nKamarajes either, or that bastard de Sousa, also pretending they were\nfriends of mine!  Heiah!  Hurry!  Drive the paddles in, you lazy black\nmen!\"\n\nIt was more his hunger for revenge than any other one thing that tipped\nthe scales of indecision and called us off the chase.  A little before\nmorning, at about that darkest hour, when the stars have seen the\ncoming sun but the world is not yet aware of it, Fred called to us to\nturn in toward a barren-looking hill of granite that rose almost sheer\nout of the water but at one corner offered a shelving landing place.\nThere we all clambered out to stretch cramped muscles and make a fire\nto cook the hippo's tongue, Coutlass cursing us for letting what he\ncalled idleness come between us and revenge.\n\nKazimoto had scarcely more than gathered an armful of wood, thrown it\ndown, and gone to hunt for more; one of the other boys had struck a\nmatch, and the first little flicker of crimson fire and purple smoke\nwas starting to curl skyward, when Fred jumped on it and stamped it out.\n\n\"Silence!\" he ordered.  \"Keep still every one!\" and repeated it twice\nin Kiswahili for the natives' benefit.\n\nWe could not see at first which way he was staring through the\ndarkness.  It was more than two minutes before I knew what had alarmed\nhim, and then it was sound, not sight that gave me the first clue.\nThere came a purring from the lake; and when I had searched for a\nminute for the source of it I saw the glow we had watched from the dhow\nin the storm the first night out--the telltale crimson stain on the\ndark that rides above a steamer's funnel, and at intervals a stream of\nsparks to prove they were burning wood and driving her at top speed.\n\n\"It can't be the German launch,\" said I.\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded Fred irritably.  He knew I knew it was the German\nlaunch as certainly as he did.\n\n\"How can they have patched her boiler?\" I asked.\n\n\"How many beans make five?  They've done it, and there she goes!  No\nother launch on the lake can make that speed!  I've heard the British\nrailway people have a launch or two, but they're small enough to have\ntraveled down the line on ordinary trucks.  That's the German launch\nand Schillingschen as surely as we stand here!\"\n\nWe waited there until dawn, arguing at intervals, not daring to light a\nfire, nor caring to sleep, Coutlass sitting apart and laughing every\nnow and then like a hyena.\n\n\"If the men weren't so dead beat I'd be for carrying on, said Fred.\n\n\"What's the use?\" argued Brown.  \"We can't catch the bally launch, can\nwe?  Soon as it's daylight they'd see us, like as not.  I hope to get\ndrunk once more before I die!  Schillingschen 'ud run us down, an'\ngood-by us!\"\n\n\"I'd say follow them if the men could make it,\" Will agreed.  \"But\nwhat's the odds?  It's us they're after.  They'll dare do nothing to\nthe women on the dhow--in British waters.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" I agreed, not believing a word of it, any more than they.\nOne had to calm one's feelings somehow; the men were too weary to\ndrive the canoes another mile at anything like speed.  Coutlass, who\nhad heard every word of the argument, burst out into such yells of\nlaughter that Fred threw a rock at him.  \"Curse you, you ghoul!\"\n\nCoutlass changed his tone from demoniacal delight to quieter, grim\namusement.\n\n\"They will do nothing, eh?  It is I, Georges Coutlass, who need do\nnothing!  I have my revenge by proxy!  Wait and see!\"\n\nFred threw a second rock, and hit him squarely.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" swore the Greek.  \"Do you know that rock is harder\nthan a man's head?\"\n\nFred let the boys light a fire when the sun had risen high enough to\nmake the little blaze not noticeable.  Most of the men were asleep, but\nthough our eyes ached with the long vigil we could not have copied\nthem.  About three hours after daylight we breakfasted off slices of\nhot boiled hippo tongue and cold lake water, without salt or condiments\nof any kind, and with discontent increased by that unpleasing feast we\naroused the boys and drove them into the canoes.\n\nWe forced the pace again, and picked up smoke on the sky-line an hour\nbefore noon, but it was not from a steamer's funnel.  It was lazy,\nflat-flowing, spreading smoke with a look of iniquity about it that\nsent our hearts to our mouths.  We paddled toward it with frenzied\nenergy, and long before any of us could make out details Coutlass,\nstanding balancing himself amidships, told us what we knew was true and\nflatly refused to believe.\n\n\"It's the Queen of Sheba burning to the water-line!\"\n\n\"Sit down, you fool, or you'll upset us!\"\n\n\"She's gutted already--the flame is about finished! nothing now but\nsmoke!\"\n\n\"Sit down, you lying idiot, and hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"I can see the smoke of the German launch now!  Don't you all see it?\nStraight ahead beyond the smoke of the dhow!  They've burned the dhow\nand steamed away!  I'll bet you a million pounds they've killed\neverybody--shot 'em, or burned 'em alive, or drowned 'em!\"\n\n\"Did you hear me tell you to sit down?  I'll tip you overboard and make\nyou swim for shore--d'ye see those crocodiles?  Ugh!  Look at the\nbrutes!  In you go among the crocks if you don't sit down at once!\"\n\nCoutlass took no notice of the threat, but rocked the canoe recklessly\nas he stood on tiptoe.\n\n\"Think of their gall!  By Bacchus, they're steaming for British East!\nI bet you five million pounds to a kick they think they've drowned the\nlot of us!  They're going to steam in and report the accident!\"\n\nWe got him to sit down at last by ordering the paddlers nearest him to\nthrow him overboard, but nothing would stop his evil croaking any more\nthan flat refusal to admit the truth of what he gloated over lessened\nour real conviction.\n\nLong before we reached the dhow there was no room left for unbelief.\nThe stern planks were charred, but stood erect, unburned yet, and the\nblue and white paint smeared on them was surely that of the Queen of\nSheba.  When we came within fifty yards the water was full of loathsome\nreptiles; our paddles actually struck them as they swarmed after the\nprey, snapping at one another and at our canoes--long, slimy-looking\nmonsters, as able to smell carrion in the distance as kites are to see.\n\nThere were garments on the water--blankets--and one soaked, torn, lacy\nthing that certainly had been a woman's.  More than a dozen crocodiles\nfought around that.  We tried to go close enough to see whether there\nwere dead bodies in the dhow's charred hull, but as if the very ripple\nfrom our paddles were the last straw, the wreck dipped suddenly ten\nfeet from us and plunged, the crocodiles following it down into deep\nwater with lashing tails--swifter than fish.\n\nWe paddled about for an hour in the blistering sun, searching stupidly\nfor what we knew we could never find; crocodiles remove traces of\nidentity more swiftly than kites and crows.\n\n\"I'll bet you they thought we were on board!\" gleed Coutlass.  \"I'll\nbet you they opened fire, and when we didn't answer came to the\nconclusion we had no ammunition.  Then they steamed close enough to\nthrow kerosene on board and light it!  I bet you they steamed round and\nround and watched the people jump as the flames drove them overboard!\nOr d'you think they shot them all, and then threw them overboard and\nfired the dhow?  No--then they'd have known we weren't on the dhow;\nthey'd have steamed back then to find us; they thought we were in the\ndhow!  They thought we were hiding below deck!  They're going to\nBritish East to take their Bible oaths they saw us burn and drown!\nIsn't that a joke!  Isn't that a good one!  Gassharamminy!  But I'd\ngive my hope of heaven to know whether they shot the women first or\nwatched them jump among the crocodiles when the heat grew fierce!\"\n\nWe paddled to another rocky island--one that had trees on it, and\nrested through the heat of the day when we had killed all the snakes\nthat had forestalled us in the shade.  There, after again eating\nhippo-tongue unseasoned and ungarnished, we held a council of war, and\nFred produced the map that Rebecca stole from Coutlass.\n\n\"If we make for a township now--Kisumu is the nearest--about five and\ntwenty miles away,\" said Fred, \"we can give ourselves the pleasure of\nsurprising Schillingschen, and of course we can get a square meal and\nsome clothes and soap and so on--incidentally perhaps some rifles and\nammunition.  But we can't prove a thing against Schillingschen, and he\nhas enough pull with British officials to make things deuced unpleasant\nfor us, for a time at least.  Consider the other side of it.  Suppose\nwe don't make for a station.  Schillingschen reports us dead.  Nobody\nlooks for us--unless perhaps out on the lake for a hat or some scrap of\nclothing by way of corroborative evidence.  Suppose we paddle out of\nthis gulf and take to shore somewhere along the north end of the lake.\nWe've no food, no tents, only one gun, next to no ammunition, nothing\nbut money and a purpose.  We don't know what chance we have of getting\nsupplies, and particularly rifles, without letting any one know where\nwe are, but we do know we've a clear field and a straight mark for\nElgon, where rumor says--and Courtney said--and Schillingschen\nthinks--and this map says the ivory ought to be!  The odds are against\nus--climate--starvation--wild beasts--savages--last and not least, the\ngovernment, if they ever get wind of our being beyond bounds.  Are we\nwilling to take the chance, or are we not?\"\n\nWe talked it over for an hour, Coutlass listening all ears to most of\nwhat we said, although we drove him to the farthest limit of the shade\ntrees.  We were in two minds whether or not it mattered if he listened,\nand made the usual two-minds hash of it.  Finally we put it to a vote,\nletting Brown have a voice with the rest of us.  He was in favor of\nanything that offered prospect of a gamble; and we remembered the\nletter in code we had given the missionary to mail to Monty. We had\ntold him in that that we should make tracks for Elgon, and we all voted\nthe same way.\n\n\"In other words\" grinned Fred, \"we're perfect idiots, and ready and\nwilling to prove it!  Good!  If you fellows had voted the other way I'd\nhave gone forward to Elgon alone!\"\n\nIt was then that Georges Coutlass took a hand in the game again.  He\ncame striding through the trees with something of his old swagger, and\nsat down among us with an air.\n\n\"Count me in!\" he demanded.\n\n\"D'you mean in the lake?\" suggested Fred.\n\n\"In on the trip to Mount Elgon!\"\n\n\"We've had nearly enough of you!\" Fred answered.  \"I know what's\ncoming!  If you don't come with us you'll tell tales?  Blackmail, eh?\nWell, it won't work!  We'll set you ashore on the mainland, and if you\ndare show yourself to Schillingschen or any British official, we'll run\nthat risk cheerfully!\"\n\nBut Coutlass was imperturbable for once.  He laid a hand on Fred's\nknee, and changed his tone to one of gentle persuasion between friend\nand friend.\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Oakes,  I know you now too well!  You are not the man to leave\nme in the lurch!  These others perhaps!  You never!  You know me, too.\nYou have seen me under all conditions.  You are able to judge my\ncharacter.  You know how firm a friend I can be, as well as how savage\nan enemy!  You know I would never be false to a friend such as you--to\na man whom I admire as I do you!\"\n\nWill Yerkes, who had tried to keep a straight face, now went off into\npeals of laughter, rolling over on his back and rocking his legs in the\nair--a performance that did not appear to discourage Coutlass in the\nleast.  Brown was far from amused.  He advised throwing the Greek into\nthe lake.\n\n\"Remember those cattle o' mine!\" he insisted.\n\n\"Yes!\" agreed Coutlass.  \"Remember those cattle!  Consider what a man\nof quick decision and courage I am!  How useful I can be!  What a\nforager!  What a guide!  What a fighting man!  What a hunter!  What a\nliar on behalf of my friends!  What a danger for my friends' enemies!\nWhat are the cattle of a drunkard like Brown--the poor unhappy\nsot!--compared to the momentary needs of a gentleman!  Ah! By the\nordeal!  I am a gentleman, and that is the secret of it all!  You, Mr.\nOakes, as one brave gentleman, can not despise the right hand of\nfriendship of Georges Coutlass, another gentleman!  I know you can not!\nYou haven't it in you!  You were born under another star than that!  I\nhave confidence!  I sit contented!\"\n\n\"You good-for-nothing villain!\" Fred grinned.  \"I'll take you at your\nword!\" and Brown of Lumbwa gasped, the very hairs of his red beard\nbristling.\n\n\"I knew you would!\" said Coutlass calmly.  \"These others are not\ngentlemen.  They do not understand.\"\n\n\"If your word is good for anything,\" Fred continued.\n\n\"My word is my bond!\" said the Greek.\n\n\"And you really want to prove yourself my friend--\"\n\n\"I would go to hell for you and bring you back the devil's favorite\nwife!\"\n\n\"I will set you on the mainland, to go and recover those cattle of Mr.\nBrown's from the Masai who raided them!  Return them to Lumbwa, and\nI'll guarantee Brown shall shake hands with you!\"\n\n\"Pah! Brown! That drunkard!\"\n\n\"See here!\" said Brown, getting up and peeling off his coat.  \"I've had\nenough of being called drunkard by you.  Put up your dukes!\"\n\nBut a fight between Brown and the Greek with bare fists would have been\nlittle short of murder.  Brown was in no condition to thrash that wiry\ncustomer, and we in no mood to see Coutlass get the better of him.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Brown! Sit down!\" ordered Fred, and having saved his\nface Brown condescended readily enough.\n\n\"What you said's right,\" he admitted.  \"Let him get my cattle back\nafore he's fit to fight a gentleman!\"\n\nAnd so the matter was left for the present, with Georges Coutlass under\nsentence of abandonment to his own devices as soon as we could do that\nwithout entailing his starvation.  We had no right to have pity for the\nrascal; he had no claim whatever on our generosity; yet I think even\nBrown would not have consented to deserting him on any of those barren\nislands, whatever the risk of his spoiling our plans as soon as we\nshould let him out of sight.\n\nFrom then until we beached the canoes at last in a gap in the papyrus\non the lake's northern shore, we pressed forward like hunted men.  For\none thing, the very thought of boiled meat without bread, salt, or\nvegetables grew detestable even to the natives after the second or\nthird meal, although hippo tongue is good food.  We tried green stuff\ngathered on the islands, but it proved either bitter or else\nnauseating, and although our boys gathered bark and roots that they\nsaid were fit for food, it was noticeable that they did not eat much of\nit themselves.  The simplest course was to race for the shore with as\nlittle rest and as little sleep as the men could do with.\n\nHowever, we were not noticeably better off when we first set foot on\nshore.  There was nothing but short grass growing on the thin soil that\nonly partly hid the volcanic rock and manganese iron ore.  Victoria\nNyanza is the crater of a once enormous, long ago extinct volcano, and\nwe stood on a shelf of rock about a thousand feet below what had been\nthe upper rim--a chain of mountains leading away toward the north\nhigher and higher, until they culminated in Mount Elgon, another\nextinct volcano fourteen thousand feet above sea level.\n\nIt was not unexplored land where we stood, but it was so little known\nthat the existence of white men was said to be a matter of some doubt\namong natives a mile or two to either side of the old safari route that\npassed from east to west.  We could see no villages, although we\nmarched for hours, the loaned canoe-men tagging along behind us,\nhungrier than we, until at last over the back of a long low spur we\nspied the tops of growing kaffir corn.\n\nAt sight of that we broke into a run and burst on the field of grain\nlike a pack of the dog-baboons that swoop from the hills and make\nhavoc.  We seized the heads of grain, rubbed them between our hands,\nand had munched our fill before we were seen by the jealous owners.  A\nsmall boy herding hump-backed cattle down in the valley watched us for\na minute, and then deserted his charge to report to the village hidden\nbehind a clump of trees.  Ten minutes after that we were surrounded by\nnaked black giants, all armed with spears and a personal smell that\noutstank one's notions of Gehenna.\n\nWe had nothing to offer them, except money, for which they obviously\nhad not the slightest use.  None of us knew their language.  From their\npoint of view we were thieves taken in the act, all but one of us\nunarmed as far as they knew, to be judged by the tribal standard that\nfor more centuries than men remember has decreed that the thief shall\ndie.  They were most incensed at the four unhappy islanders, probably\non the same principle that dogs pick on the weakest, and fight most\nreadily with dogs of a more or less similar breed.\n\nIt was Coutlass who saved that situation.  He instantly went crazy, or\nthe next thing to it, wrinkling up his black-whiskered face into a\ncaricature, yelling a Greek monologue in a refrain consisting of five\nnotes repeated over and over, and dancing around in a wide ring with\none leg shorter than the other and his arms executing symbols of\nwitchcraft.\n\nThe chief was the biggest man--not an inch less than seven feet--black\nas ebony, from the curly hair, into which his patient wives had plaited\nfiber to hang in a greasy lump over his neck, all down his naked body\nto the soles of his enormous feet.  Each time he came in front of that\nindividual Coutlass paused and executed special finger movements, like\nthe trills of a super-pianist, ending invariably in a punctuation point\nthat made the savage shiver.\n\nThe fifth time round, to avoid the accusing fingers, the giant dodged\nbehind a smaller man, who dodged behind a woman, who promptly turned\nand ran, swinging in the wind behind her a bustle like a horse's tail\nthat was her only garment.  Her flight was the touch that settled the\ndecision in our favor.  We all began to do a mumbo-jumbo dance around\nCoutlass, and in five seconds more the whole armed party was in full\nretreat, holding their spears behind them as some sort of protection\nagainst magic.\n\n\"After that,\" said Coutlass proudly, \"will you still dismiss me from\nyour party, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"You've got to go and find Brown's cattle and return them to him!\" Fred\nanswered firmly.  But we none of us felt like sending him packing until\nhe was better fed and some provision could be made for his safety on\nthe road.  It was wonderful, the number of excuses that flocked through\nmy mind for befriending the ruffian, and later on I found it was the\nsame with Fred and Will.  Brown, on the other hand, affected\nindignation at his being allowed to go with us another yard.\n\n\"Make a rope o' grass an' hang the swine!\" he grumbled.\n\nWe decided to march on the village, retreat being obviously far too\ndangerous, and the only likely safe course being to follow up the\nchance success.  Sleep another night in the open among the mosquitoes\nand wild beasts, besides making us wretched at the mere suggestion, was\nlikely to bring us all down with fever.  We preferred the thought of\nfever to the loneliness; for man is unlike all other nomads, and that\nis why the dog takes kindly to him; he must have a home of his own--a\nportable one, if you will--a tub like Diogenes--a Bedouin's tent--a\ncave, or a hole in the ground--something, so be he may rent it or own\nit or know for a fact he may sleep there when night comes.  Life in the\nopen is only good fun when there is cover to take to at will.\n\nAll the way along the winding foot-track leading in every imaginable\ndirection except toward the village, and only turning suddenly toward\nit when we had grown disgusted and decided to leave it and try to find\nanother, Brown kept pointing out trees with suitable overhanging arms\nto which we might hang Coutlass.  The Greek, with eyes for nothing but\nthe fat, hump-backed village cattle in the distance, seemed to think\nonly of them, until Will commented on the fact, and Fred saw fit to\ndrop a hint.\n\n\"Steal as much as a young calf, Coutlass, and we'll let Brown choose\nthe tree!  Try it on if you don't believe me!\"\n\nThe villagers closed their gate against us by dragging great piles of\nthorn across the gap in the rough palisade, but, as Coutlass pointed\nout, they would have to open it up again to let the cattle in before\ndark, so we sat down and ate the remaining fragments of the hippo\ntongue--no ambrosia by that time; it had to be eaten, to save it from\nutter waste!\n\nThen Coutlass once more did a first-class devil dance backward and\nforward this time before the gate, putting genius into it and fear into\nthe hearts of the defenders.  Kazimoto helped even more than he by\ndiscovering a native within the palisade who could speak a common\ntongue.\n\nTheir villagers held a very noisy council on their side of the thorn\nobstruction, under the apparent impression that it was sound- and\nbullet-proof.  It was beginning to be pretty obvious that a man who\nadvised volleying through the crevices with spears was winning the\nargument when Kazimoto detected familiar accents and raised his voice.\nAfter that the barricade was dragged aside within ten minutes and we\nentered, if not in honor, at least in temporary safety.\n\nLuxury is a question of contrast.  That evening in a hut assigned to us\nby the chief, squatting on the trodden cow-dung floor, leaning against\nthe dried-mud sides, with a little fire of sticks in the midst to give\nus light and keep mosquitoes at a distance at the expense of almost\nunbearable heat, we ate porridge made from mtama as they call their\nkaffir corn, and washed it down with milk--good rich cows' milk, milked\nby Kazimoto into our own metal pot instead of their unwashed gourds.\nLucullus never dined better.\n\nThe feast was only rather spoiled by two things:  we all had chiggers\nin our feet--the minute fleas that haunt the dust of native villages\nand insert themselves under toe-nails to grow great and lay their eggs.\n(Nearly every native in the village had more than one toe missing.)\nAnd the chief felt obliged to insert his smelly presence among us and\nask innumerable idiotic questions through the medium of his interpreter\nand Kazimoto.  He received some astonishing answers, but would not have\nbeen satisfied with anything more reasonable.  We wanted him satisfied,\nand gave our interpreter free rein.\n\nThe main trouble was we had nothing of value to offer him.  Money was\nsomething he had no knowledge of.  He wanted beads of a certain size\nand color; for two handfuls of them he expressed himself willing to be\nour friend for life.  We had to educate him about money, and Kazimoto\nassured him that the silver rupees Fred produced from a bag were so\nprecious that governments went to war to get them away from other\ngovernments.\n\nBut the impression still prevailed that we were wasikini--poor men;\nand that is a fatal qualification in the savage mind.\n\n\"Why have you only one gun?\"\n\nIn vain Kazimoto assured him that we had dozens of guns \"at home\"--that\nFred's landed possessions were so vast that two hundred strong men\nwalking for a month would be unable to march across them--that Fred's\nwives (Fred seemed to live under a cloud of sexual scandal in those\ndays) were so many in number they had to be counted twice a day to make\nsure none was missing.\n\nThe chief had eighteen wives of his own to show.  He could prove his\nmatrimonial felicity.  Why had Fred left his behind?  How did he dare?\nWho looked after them?  Had he left the guns behind to guard the women?\nWhy did such a rich man travel without food for his men?  The chief\nhad seen us with his own eyes devour porridge as if we were starving.\n\nTo have told him the truth would have been worse than useless.  To have\nmentioned such a thing as shipwreck would only have stirred the savage\ninstinct to prey off all unfortunates.  Failing evidence of wealth in\nour possession, the only feasible plan was to claim so much that he\nmight believe some of it, and it was Coutlass, drawing a bow at a\nventure, who ordered Kazimoto to tell him that we expected a party in a\nfew days bringing tents, provisions and more guns.\n\n\"There will be blue-and-white beads of the sort you long for among\nthose loads,\" added Kazimoto on his own account; and that eased the\nchief's mind for the night.  Fred gave him a half-rupee, and promised\nhim to exchange it when the loads should come for as many of the beads\nas he could seize in his two fists.  The chief went out to brag to the\nvillage, opening and closing his fists to see how huge their compass\nwas; and later that night his wives had to be beaten for fighting.\nThey were jealous because the fattest and the youngest new one had both\nbeen promised double shares.\n\nThere was another fight because our porters emerged from their hut and\ndemanded that a barren cow out of the village herd be butchered.  They\nmade their meaning perfectly clear by taking the cow by the horns and\ntail and throwing her on her back.  Fred decided that argument with a\nthick stick about four feet long.\n\nThe unusual spectacle of some one taking sides against his own men,\nwhatever the rights or wrongs of it, so affected the chief that he\nentered our hut next morning disposed to hold us up for double promises\nof beads.  It was evident we had to deal with a born extortioner.  He\nwould increase his demands with every fresh concession.\n\n\"Oh, what's the odds!\" laughed Coutlass.  \"Promise him anything!  The\nonly loads likely to come along this way for a year or two are\nSchillingschen's!\"\n\nFred told the chief he would think the matter over, and chased him out\nof the hut.  Coutlass had given us all a new idea in an instant, and he\nwas the only one who did not see its point--he, the only one who did\nnot give a snap of the fingers for the laws of any land!\n\n\"D'you suppose--\"\n\n\"Too good to hope for!\"\n\n\"If he thinks we're dead--?\"\n\n\"And if he believes in that map--\"\n\n\"He'll not need the map.  He'll have memorized it.  There's only a\ncircle drawn on it to mark the Elgon district.  All the old pencil\nmarks have been rubbed out as he searched the other likely places and\ndrew them all blank.\"\n\n\"He'll travel without military escort?\"\n\n\"Sure!  He won't want witnesses!  He'll make believe it's a scientific\ntrip.  Remember, he's a professor of ethnology.  That's how he puts it\nall over the British and goes where he pleases without as much as\nby-your-leave.\"\n\n\"Say, fellows!  It's a moral cinch that when we broke away from Muanza\nhe made up his mind in a flash to return to British East and destroy us\non the way.  He thinks he made a clean job of that.  I'll bet he loaded\nthe launch down with stuff for a long safari, and thinks now he has a\nclear run and can take his time!\"\n\n\"If that's how the cards lie, the game's ours!\"\n\nCoutlass saw the point at last and offered himself on the altar of\nforgiveness and friendship.\n\n\"Make me your partner, gentlemen, and if he travels within a hundred\nmiles of this I will crawl into that Schillingschen's tent in the night\nand slit his throat!  I would murder him as willingly as I eat when I\nam hungry!\"\n\n\"Your job has been assigned you!\" answered Fred. \"When Mr. Brown's\ncattle are back in Lumbwa perhaps we'll give you something else to do!\"\n\nNevertheless, Coutlass had outlined in a flash the limits of the plan.\nWe would draw the line at murdering even Schillingschen, but must help\nourselves to his outfit as our only chance of re-outfitting without\nbetraying our presence in British East.  But the plan was not without\nrat-holes in it that a fool could see.\n\n\"Schillingschen's boys will escape and run to the nearest British\nofficial with the story!\"\n\n\"And the British official will be so full of the importance of\nSchillingschen and the need of protecting his beastly carcass--to say\nnothing of the everlasting disgrace of letting him be scoughed on\nBritish territory--and the official reprimand from home that's sure to\nfollow--that he'll come hot-foot to investigate!\"\n\n\"We'll have to provide against that,\" said Fred, and we all laughed,\nincluding Coutlass.  Talk of provisions is easy when you have no means\nout of which to provide.  It did not occur to include Coutlass in the\ncalculations, or to dismiss him from them; but without exchanging any\nremarks on the subject it was clear enough to all of us that no such\nplan could hope to succeed with the Greek at large, at liberty to spoil\nit.  We saw we should have to keep him in our party for the present.\n\n\"Don't forget,\" said Coutlass, more accustomed than we to seizing the\nstrategic points of desperate situations, \"that Schillingschen will\nhave his own boys with him from German East.\"\n\n\"I didn't see any with him on the launch,\" I objected.\n\n\"He would never have come without them\" Coutlass insisted.  \"He made\nthem lie below the water-line out of reach of bullets at the only time\nwhen you might have seen them!  He wouldn't trust himself to British\nporters.  My word, no!  That devil knows natives!  He knows some of\nthem might be British government spies!  He'll have his own boys,--if\nthey can't carry all his loads he'll buy donkeys at Mumias; there are\nalways donkeys to be bought at that place, brought down from Turkana by\nthe Arab ivory traders.  Do donkeys talk?\"\n\nAt any rate, we talked, and made no bones at all about including\nGeorges Coutlass in the conversation.  It was his suggestion that we\nshould send natives to look out for Schillingschen, and Fred's\namendment that reduced the messengers to one, and that one Kazimoto.\nAny of the others might decide to desert, once out of sight, and we\ncould scarcely have blamed them, for their path had not lain among\nroses in our company.\n\nKazimoto had a million objections to offer against going alone on that\nerrand, as, for instance, that the chigger fleas would invade our\ntoe-nails disastrously without his cunning fingers to hunt them out\nagain.  He also prophesied that without him to interpret there would\nswiftly be trouble between us and the chief; but we saw the other side\nof that medal and rather looked forward to an interval when the chief\nshould not be able to talk to us at all.\n\nAt last, on the second morning after our arrival at the village,\nKazimoto wrapped an enormous mound of cold mtama pudding in a cloth and\nwent his way, prophesying darkly of murder and sudden death lurking\nbehind rocks and trees, as unwishful to be alone as a terrier without a\nmaster, but much too faithful to refuse duty.\n\nThe chief saw a side of the medal that we had not guessed existed.  He\ncame and sat beside us like an evil-smelling shadow, satisfied that now\nwe could not dismiss him, he being under no obligation to understand\ngestures.  Curiosity was the impelling motive, but he was not without\nsuspicion.  Fred said he reminded him of a Bloomsbury landlady whose\nlodgers had not paid their board and rooming in advance.\n\nWill solved that problem by taking the rifle, and one cartridge that\nFred doled out grudgingly, and after a long day's stalking among\nmosquitoes in the papyrus at the edge of the lake five miles away, at\nimminent risk of crocodiles and an even worse horror we had not yet\nsuspected, shooting a hippopotamus.  Forthwith the whole village, chief\nincluded, went to cut up and carry off the meat, and there followed\nrevelry by night, the chiefs wives brewing beer from the mtama, and all\ngetting drunk as well as gorged.  Coutlass and Brown got more drunk\nthan any one.\n\nWill came back with flies on his coat--three large things like\nhorse-flies, that crossed their wings in repose, resembling in all\nother respects the common tetse fly.  He said the reeds by the\nlake-side were full of them.\n\nRemembering tales about sleeping sickness, and suspicion of conveying\nit said to rest on a tetse fly that crossed its wings, I went out the\nfollowing day and walked many miles east-ward, taking with me the only\ntwo sober villagers I could find.  They came willingly enough for five\nmiles, thinking, I suppose, that I intended to follow Will's example\nand kill some more meat (although, as I did not take the rifle with me,\nthey were not guilty of much dead-weight reasoning).\n\nAt the bank of the fifth stream we came to they stopped, and refused to\ngo another yard.  Thinking they were merely lusting after the meat and\nbeer in the village, I took a stick to drive them across the stream in\nfront of me, but they dodged in terror and ran back home as if the\ndevil had been after them.\n\nI crossed the stream and continued forward alone about another mile\ntoward a fairly large village visible between great blue boulders with\ncactus dotted all about.  There was the usual herd of cattle grazing\nnear at hand, but the place had an unaccountable forlorn look, and the\nsmall boy standing on an ant-hill to watch the cattle seemed too\nlistless to be curious, and too indifferent to run away.  The big brown\ntetse flies, that crossed their wings when resting, were everywhere,\nmaking no noise at all, but announcing themselves every once in a while\nby a bite on the back of the hand that stung like a whip-lash.  They\nseemed to have special liking for coat-sleeves, and a dozen of them\nwere generally riding on each side of me.  One could drive them off,\nbut they came back at once, as horse-flies do when poked off with a\nwhip.\n\nWhen I drew near the village nobody came out to look at me, which was\nsuspicious in itself.  Nobody shouted.  Nobody blocked the way, or\ndragged thorn-bushes across the gateway.  There were black men and\nwomen there, sitting in the shadows of the eaves, who looked up and\nstared at me--men and women too intent on sitting still to care whether\ntheir skins were glossy--unoiled, unwashed, unfed, by the look of\nthem--skeletons clothed in leather and dust, desiring death, but\ncruelly denied it.\n\nOne man, thin as a wisp of smoke, rushed at me from the shadow of a hut\ndoor and tried to bite my leg.  The merest push sent him rolling over,\nand there he lay, too overcome by inertia to move another inch, his arm\nuplifted in the act of self-defense.  Nobody else in the village\nstirred.  There were more huts than people, more kites on the roofs\nthan huts.  Some of the littlest children played in the hut doors, but\nnearly all of them were listless like the grown folk.  The only sign of\nnormal activity was the big black earthen jars that witnessed that the\nwomen performed part at least of their daily round by bringing water\nfrom the lake.\n\nI returned late that afternoon, walking, as it were, out of a belt of\ntetse flies.  On one side of a narrow stream they were thick together;\nto the west of it there were scarcely any, although the wind blew from\neast to west.\n\n\"There's no fear of news about us reaching any government official,\" I\nannounced.  \"There's a curtain of death between us and the government\nthat even suspicion couldn't penetrate!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nTHE SLEEP THAT IS NO SLEEP*\n\n  Ten were the plagues that Israel fled, and leaving left no cure,\n        Whose progeny self-multiplied a million-fold remain,\n  The cloak of each one ignorance, idolatry its lure,\n        And death the goal till, clarion-called, lost Israel come again.\n  Till then that loaded lash that bade the tale of bricks increase\n        (Eye for an eye, and limb for limb!) shall fail not though\n            ye weep;\n  The conqueror's heel for Africa!--The fear that shall not cease!--\n        Desire, distrust, the alien law!--The sleep that is no  sleep!\n\n------------------\n* It is a characteristic of the so-called Sleeping Sickness that is\ndecimating the tribes around Victoria Nyanza that the victim, although\nhe goes into a coma, never actually sleeps from the time of taking the\ndisease until the end, usually more than a year later.  The natives, a\ntribe that came originally down from Egypt, themselves say that the\ndreaded sickness is a \"visitation\" by way of revenge on them for former\nsins, although what sins, and whose vengeance, they are at a total loss\nto explain.\n------------------\n\n\nKazimoto was gone five days, and then came preceded by proof of the\nnews he brought.  He came in the evening.  In the morning,\nunaccountably from the northward, instead of from the westward where\nUganda lay,--avoiding the regular safari route and the belt of sleeping\nsickness villages, came a genial, sleek, shiny Baganda, arrayed in\nkhaki coat, red fez, and bordered loin-cloth, gifted with tongues, and\nself-confident beyond belief.\n\nHe knew nothing of us at first, for we sat in our hut with a smudge\ngoing, nervous about flies, even Coutlass, reckless as a rule of\nanything he could not see, and perfectly indifferent to death for\nothers, now fidgety and afraid to swagger forth.\n\nOne of our Nyamwezi porters suddenly made a great shout of \"Hodi!\"* and\ncame stooping through the low door, standing erect again inside to\nawait our pleasure.  We could hear others outside, listening under the\neaves.  When we had kept him waiting sufficiently long to prevent his\ngetting too much notion of his own importance, Fred nodded to him to\nspeak.  [* Hodi! Equivalent to \"May I come In!\"]\n\n\"Is it true, bwana,\" he asked, \"that the Germans will come soon and\nconquer this part of Africa?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Fred.\n\n\"There is one out here, a Baganda, who says they will surely come.  He\nsays the religion of Islam will be preached from end to end of\neverywhere, and that the Germans are the true priests of Islam.  They\nwill come, says he, when the time is ripe, and call on all the converts\nof Islam to rise and slay all other people, including all white folk,\nlike the English, who do not accept that creed.  If that is true,\nbwana, whither shall we go, and whither shall you go, to escape such\nterrible things?\"\n\n\"Does the Baganda know there are white men in this village?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"Not yet, bwana.\"\n\n\"Don't tell him, then, but bring him in here.  Tell him there are folk\nin here who say he is a liar.\"\n\nThe Nyamwezi backed out, and we heard whispering outside.  There is\nprecious little performance in Africa without a deal of talk.  At the\nend of about ten minutes the porter again shouted \"Hodi!\" and this time\nwas followed in by the stranger, seven other of our own men, uninvited,\nbringing up the rear.\n\n\"Jambo!\"* said the Baganda, with a great effort at bravado, when his\neyes had grown accustomed to the gloom and the first severe surprise of\nseeing white men had worn off.  He was a very cool customer indeed.  [*\nJambo! Kiswahili equivalent of \"How d'you do?\"]\n\n\"Whose pimp are you?\" demanded Fred, without answering the salutation.\n\nThe man fell back on insolence at once.  There is no native in Africa\nwho takes more keenly to that weapon than the mission-schooled Baganda.\n\n\"I am employed by a gentleman of superior position,\" he answered in\nperfectly good English.\n\n\"In what capacity?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"I am not employed to tell his secrets to the first strangers who ask\nme!\"\n\n\"Do you obey him implicitly?\"\n\n\"I do.  I am honorable person.  I receive his pay and do his bidding.\"\n\n\"Is his name Schillingschen?\"\n\nThe Baganda hesitated.\n\n\"All right,\" said Fred.  \"I know his name is Schillingschen.  You have\nboasted that you do what he orders you.  These men tell me you have\nsaid that the Germans are coming to conquer the country and destroy all\npeople, including the English, who have not accepted Islam!\"\n\nThe man hesitated again, glancing over his shoulder to discover his\nretreat cut off by our porters, and eying Fred with malignity that\nreminded one of a cornered beast of prey.  He could control his face,\nbut not his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir!\" he answered after swallowing a time or two.  \"How could\nthey tell such lies against me!  I am a person born in Uganda, now a\nBritish protectorate and enjoying all blessings of British rule.  I am\neducated at the mission college at Entebbe.  How should I tell such a\ntale against my benefactors?\"\n\n\"That is what you are here to explain!\" Fred answered.  \"No!  You can't\nescape, you hellion!  Squat down and answer!\"\n\n\"All this stuff is pretty familiar,\" Will interrupted.  \"In the States\nthere are always people going the rounds among our darkies preaching\nsome form of treason.  Over there we can afford to treat it as a\njoke--now and then an ugly one, and on the darkies!\"\n\n\"This is an ugly joke on a darkie, too!\" grinned Fred.\n\nThe Baganda made a sudden dive and a determined struggle to get through\nthe door, but our porters were too quick and strong for him.\n\n\"Confession is your one chance!\" said Fred.\n\n\"Put hot irons to his feet!\" advised Coutlass.  (The native beer had\nleft him villainously evil-tempered.)  \"Gassharamminy!  Leave me alone\nwith that fat Baganda for half an hour, and I will make him tell me\nwhat is on the far side of the moon, as well as what his mother said\nand did before she bore him!\"\n\n\"Shall I hand you over to this Greek gentleman?\" suggested Fred.\n\n\"Oh, my God, no!\" the Baganda answered, trembling.  \"Hand me over to\nthe bwana collector!  He will put me in jail.  I am not afraid of\nBritish jail!  It will not be for long!  The English do not punish as\nthe Germans do!  You dare not assault me!  You dare not torture me!\nYou must hand me over to the bwana collector to be tried in court of\nlaw.  Nothing else is permissible!  I shall receive short sentence,\nthat is all, with reprieve after two-thirds time on account of good\nconduct!\"\n\n\"Make him prisoner in the sleeping sickness village you told us about!\"\nadvised Coutlass, lolling at ease on his elbow to watch the man's\nincreasing fear.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!  Oh, gentlemen!  That is not how white Englishmen behave!\nYou must either let me go, or--\"\n\nHe made another terrific dive for liberty, biting and kicking at his\ncaptors, and finally lying on his back to scream as if the hot irons\nCoutlass had recommended were being applied in earnest.\n\n\"What shall we do with the beast?\" asked Fred.  The hut was so full of\nhis infernal screaming that we could talk without his hearing us.\n\n\"Tie him up,\" I said.  \"If we let him go he'll run straight to\nSchillingschen.\"\n\n\"Leave him here with Coutlass and me!\"  urged Brown.  (He and Coutlass\nhad grown almost friendly since getting drunk together on the native\nbeer.)\n\n\"I recommend,\" said Will, \"that we take the law in our own hands--\"\n\nThe Baganda ceased screaming and listened. For some reason he suspected\nWill of being the deciding factor in our councils--perhaps because Will\nhad said least.\n\n\"--take the law in our own hands, and thrash him soundly.  Later on we\ncan report what we have done to the British government, and ask for\ncondonation under the circumstances or pay whatever piffling fine they\ncare to impose for the sake of appearances.  The point is, there's no\ncourt of law in these parts to hand him over to, and he needs\npunishing.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Fred. \"Let's thrash him to begin with.\"\n\n\"Let's thrash him,\" went on Will, \"as thoroughly as we've seen his\nfriends the Germans do the job!\"\n\n\"Both sides!\" agreed Brown.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no!  You can not do that, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Lay him out!\" ordered Fred.  \"Let's begin on him.  Who shall beat him\nfirst?\"\n\nAt a nod from Fred our porters stretched him face downward on the dry\ndung floor, and knelt on his arms and legs.  One of them staffed a good\nhandful of the dry dung into his mouth to stop his yelling.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Will, rather slowly and distinctly, \"if he told us\nabout Schillingschen, we'd have to let him off.  Let's hope he holds\nhis tongue, for I never wanted to flog a man so much in all my life!\"\n\nThe most palpable absurdity at the moment was that there was nothing in\nthe hut to beat him with.  There were dozens of strips of the recently\nshot hippo hide hanging in the sun outside to dry, with stones tied to\nthe end of each, to keep them taut and straight, but nobody made a move\nto bring one in.\n\n\"Take off his loin-cloth!\" ordered Fred.  \"It won't hurt him enough\nwith that thing on!\"\n\nThe Baganda spat the cow-dung from his mouth and struggled violently.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" he shouted.  \"I will tell!  I will tell everything!\"\n\n\"Too late now!\" said Will jubilantly.\n\n\"No, gentlemen, no!  Not too late!  I tell all--I tell quickly!  Only\nlisten!  Bwana Schillingschen will shoot me if he knows!  He is very\nbad man--very kali--very fierce--and oh, too clever!  You must protect\nme!\"\n\nHe could hardly get the words out, for the knees of our porters pinned\nhim down, and his chin was pressed hard on the floor.\n\n\"I ordered that loin-cloth removed!\" was all Fred commented.  One of\nthe porters attended to the task, and the Baganda hurried with his\ntale, drawing in breath in noisy gasps like a man with asthma because\nof the weight of his captors on him and the strained position of his\nneck.\n\n\"Bwana Schillingschen is sending me and many other men--not all\nBaganda, but of many tribes--to go through all parts and say Islam is\nthe only good religion--all Germans are high-priests of Islam--soon the\nGermans are coming with great armies to destroy the British and all\nother foolish people who have not accepted Islam as their creed!  All\nare to get ready to receive the Germans.\"\n\n\"Where is Schillingschen now?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"Beyond Mumias.\"\n\n\"How far beyond Mumias?\"\n\n\"Who knows?  He is marching.\"\n\n\"In which direction?  What for?\"\n\n\"To Mount Elgon.  I do not know what for.\"\n\n\"How do you know he is going to Mount Elgon?\"\n\n\"He told me to go there and find him after my work is done.\"\n\n\"How long were you to continue at what you call your work?\"\n\n\"A month or five weeks.\"\n\n\"So he expects to stay a long time up there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Has he many loads with him?\"\n\n\"Very many provisions for a long time.\"\n\n\"Guns?\"\n\n\"Several.  I do not know how many.  He gives guns to some of his men\nwhen he gets to where the government will not know about it.\"\n\n\"How many men has he?\"\n\n\"Not many.  Ten, I think.\"\n\n\"How can they carry all those loads?\"\n\n\"He brought a hundred porters from Kisumu to Mumias, and there bought\nmore than forty donkeys, sending the porters back again.\"\n\n\"Then are the men he has with him his own?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"From German East?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What orders did he give you besides to tell these lies about German\nconquest?\"\n\n\"None.\n\n\"Pass me that whip!\" ordered Fred.  There was no whip, but the Baganda\ncould not know that.\n\n\"He gave the same order to all of us,\" he yelled.  \"We are to stay out\na month or five weeks unless we meet white men.  If we meet white men\nwe are to discover the white men's plans by talking with their\nservants, and then hurry to him and report.\"\n\n\"Ah!  How many other spies has he out in this direction?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Why don't you pass me that whip when I ask for it?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"None!  None! None, bwana!  I am the only man in this direction!  He\nhas sent them north, south, east and west, but I am the only one down\nhere.\"\n\n\"He has a lot more to tell yet,\" said Coutlass.  \"Let me put hot irons\non his feet!\"\n\nFred demurred.  \"He couldn't march with us if we did that!\" he said\nwith a perfectly straight face.\n\n\"Who cares whether or not he marches!\" answered Coutlass.  \"To tell all\nhe knows is his business!  Wait while I heat the iron!\"\n\nThe Baganda began to scream again, babbling that he knew no more.  He\nassured us that Schillingschen had set the closest watch along the old\ncaravan route, and toward his own rear in the direction of Kisumu,\nwhence officials might come on chance errands.\n\n\"All right,\" said Fred.  \"Truss him up tight and keep him prisoner\namong our men in their hut.\"\n\n\"Our men are likely to get drunk tonight,\" warned Will.\n\n\"Let me watch him!\" urged Coutlass.  \"Leave me with him alone!\"\n\nTo the Greek's disgust we decided to trust the prisoner with our own\nmen, and to keep very careful watch on them, threatening them with loss\nof all their pay if they dared get drunk and lose him--a threat they\naccepted at its full face value, but resented because of Brown's and\nthe Greek's behavior the night before.  They begged to get a little\ndrunk--to get half as drunk as Brown had been--half as drunk as\nCoutlass had been--not drunk at all, but just to drink a little.  We\nwere adamant, and Brown added to their resentment by preaching them a\nsermon in their own tongue on the importance of being respectful toward\nwhite folk.\n\nKazimoto came in toward dark, foot-weary, but primed with news, and\nmost of what he had to say confirmed the Baganda's story.\nSchillingschen, he said, was making for Mount Elgon in very leisurely\nstages, letting his loaded donkeys graze their way along, and spending\nhours of his time in questioning natives along the way on every subject\nunder the sun.\n\nBesides the fact of his leisurely progress, which was sufficiently\nimportant in itself, we learned from Kazimoto that Schillingschen's own\nten boys were unable to speak the language of the country beyond a few\nof the commonest words--that they all slept in a tent together at\nnight, usually quite a little distance apart from Schillingschen's--and\nthat the donkeys were usually picketed between the two tents in a long\nline.  He also told us the ten men had five Mauser rifles between them,\nin addition to the German's own battery of three guns, one of which he\ncarried all day and kept beside his bed at night; the other two were\ncarried behind him in the daytime by a gun-bearer.\n\nThat was good news on the whole.  Coutlass went out on the strength of\nit and began to drink beer from the big earthenware crock in which the\nwomen had just brewed a fresh supply.  Brown joined him within five\nminutes, and at the end of an hour, they were swearing everlasting\nfriendship, Coutlass promising Brown his cattle back, and Brown\nassuring him that Greece and the Greeks had always held his warmest\npossible regards.\n\n\"Thermopylae, y'know, old boy, an' Marathon, an' all that kind o'\nthing!  How many miles in a day could a Greek run in them days?  Gosh!\"\n\nThey two drank themselves to sleep among the gentle cattle in the\ncircular enclosure in the midst of the village, and we--going out in\nturns at intervals to make sure our own boys were not drinking--matured\nour plans in peace.\n\nWe were too few to dare undertake the task in front of us without the\naid of Brown and the Greek.  It was a case of who was not against us\nmust be for us, and the end must justify both men and means.  We tried\nto work out ways of managing without them, but when we thought of our\nBaganda prisoner, and the almost certainty that both he and Coutlass\nwould race to give our game away to Schillingschen if let out of sight\nfor a minute, the necessity of making the best, not the worst, of the\nGreek seemed overwhelming.\n\nEarly next morning, before the village had awakened from its glut of\nbeer and hippo meat, we shook Coutlass and Brown to their feet none too\ngently, and, with the Baganda firmly secured by the wrists between two\nof our men, started off, Fred leading.\n\nThe village awoke as if by magic before we had dragged away the thorns\nfrom the gate, and the chief leaped to the realization that the beads\nhe had promised his women were about as concrete as his drunken dreams.\nHe and a swarm of his younger men followed us, begging and\narguing--mile after mile--growing angrier and more importunate.  It was\nby my advice that we crossed the stream into the sleeping sickness zone\nand left them shuddering on their own side.  Our own men did not know\nso much about the ravages of that plague, and in any case were willing\nto dare whatever risks we despised.  But we took a long bend back and\ncrossed the stream again higher up as soon as the chief and his beggars\nwere out of sight.  It was a pity not to keep exact faith and give them\nthe promised beads, if only for the sake of other white men who might\ncamp there in the future; but more than two tons of hippo meat was not\nbad pay for their hospitality.\n\nWe wished we had as good price to offer at the villages on our way, for\nsleep under cover we must, if we hoped to escape the ravages of fever;\nand the primitive savage, at least in those parts, had the principle\ndown fine of nothing whatever for nothing.  Yet as it turned out, the\nvery man whose company we looked on as a nuisance proved to be a key to\nall gates.  We marched along the track the Baganda had taken. The\nchiefs of all villages knew him again; and the men who dared take such\na prophet of evil prisoner were looked upon as high government\nofficials at least.\n\nWe accepted that description of ourselves, letting it go by silent\nassent, and explained our lack of tents and almost every other thing\nthe white man generally travels with as due to haste.  Heaven only knew\nwhat lies Kazimoto told those credulous folk, to the perfectly worthy\nend of making our lot bearable, but we were fed after a fashion, and\nlodged after a worse one all along our road.  And who should send in\nreports about us--and to whom?  Obviously white men with a prisoner,\nmarching in such a hurry toward the north, were government officials.\nWho should report officials to their government?  As for the tale about\nour having left our loads behind--are not all white people crazy?  Who\nshall explain their craziness?\n\nFrom being a nuisance the Baganda became a joke.  When it dawned on\nhis fat intellect that we were hurrying toward Schillingschen with only\none rifle among us and no baggage at all, he jumped at once to the\nconclusion we must be Schillingschen's friends; and his fear that we\nintended to hand him over to that ruthless brute for summary punishment\nwas more melting to his backbone than the dread of our imaginary whip,\nthat had caused him to give Schillingschen away.\n\nHe tried to bite through the thongs that held him, but Will twisted for\nhim handcuffs out of thick iron wire that we begged from a chief, who\nhad intended to make ornaments with it for his own legs.  We did not\ndare let the man escape, nor care to prevent our men from using force\nwhen he threw himself on the ground and wept like a spoiled child.\n\n\"I will tell you\" he said at last, deciding he might as well be hanged\nfor mutton as for lamb, \"what Bwana Schillingschen is searching for!  I\nwill tell you who knows where to find it!  I will tell you where to\nfind the man who knows!  Only let me run away then to my own home in\nUganda, and I will never again leave it!  I am afraid!  I am afraid!\"\n\nBut that was only one more reason for keeping him with us, and no\nground at all for delay.  He would not tell unless we loosed his hands\nfirst, so we pressed on, camping late and starting early, until about\nnoon of the fourth day we caught sight of Schillingschen's tents in the\ndistance, and gathered our party at once into a little rocky hollow to\ndiscuss the situation.\n\nBehind us the land sloped gradually for thirty or forty miles toward a\nsharp escarpment that overlooked the level land beside the lake.  At\ntimes between the hills and trees we could glimpse Nyanza itself,\nlooking like the vast rim of forever, mysterious and calm.  In front of\nus the rolling hills, broken out here and there into rocky knolls,\npiled up on one another toward the hump of Elgon, on which the blue sky\nrested.  In every direction were villages of folk who knew so little of\nwhite men that they paid no taxes yet and did no work--marrying and\ngiving in marriage--fighting and running away--eating and drinking and\nwatching their women cultivate the corn and beans and sweet\npotatoes--without as much as foreboding of the taxes, work for wages,\nmissionaries, law and commerce soon to come.\n\nSchillingschen was more than taking his time, he was dawdling, keeping\nhis donkeys fat, and letting his men wander at pleasure to right and\nleft gathering reports for him of unusual folk or things.  We came very\nclose to being seen by one of them, who emerged from a village near us\nwith a pair of chickens he had foraged, followed by the owner of the\nluckless birds in a great hurry and fury to get paid for them.\n\nSchillingschen's tent could fairly easily be stalked from the far side\nin broad daylight, and I was for making the attempt.  There was the\nrisk that one of our porters might grow restless and break bounds if we\nwaited, or that the Baganda might take to yelling.  We gagged him as\nsoon as I talked of the danger of that.\n\nCoutlass and Brown, however, were the only two who would agree with me.\nLike me, they were weary to death of mtama porridge, with or without\nmilk, and the sight of Schillingschen's distant campfire with a great\npot resting on stones in the midst of it whetted appetite for white\nman's food.  They and I were for supping as soon as possible from the\nGerman's provender, and sleeping under his canvas roof.\n\nBut Fred and Will insisted on caution, claiming reasonably that\nsurprise would be infinitely easier after dark.  It was unlikely that\nSchillingschen would post any sentries, and not much matter if he did.\nHis knowledge of natives and natural air of authority made him quite\nsafe among any but the wildest, and these were a comparatively peaceful\nfolk.  In all probability he would sit and read by candle light, with\nhis boys all snoring a hundred yards away.  There was no making Fred\nand Will see the virtue of my contention that a sudden attack while his\nboys were scattered all about among the villages would be just as\nlikely to succeed; so we settled down to wait where we were with what\npatience we could summon.\n\nIt was a miserable, hungry business, under a blazing hot sky, packed\ntightly together among men who objected to our smell as strongly as we\nto theirs.  It is the fixed opinion of all black people that the white\nman smells like \"bad water\"; and no word seems discoverable that will\nquite return the compliment.  That afternoon was reminiscent of the\nlong days on the dhow, when nobody could move without disturbing\neverybody else, and we all breathed the same hot mixed stench over and\nover.\n\nWe posted two sentries to lie with their eyes on the level of the rim\nand guard against surprise.  But there was so little to watch, except\nkites wheeling overhead everlastingly, that they went to sleep; and we\nwere so bored, and so sure of our hiding-place and Schillingschen's\nunsuspicion that we did not notice them.  I myself fell asleep toward\nfive o'clock, and when I awoke the sun was so low in the west that our\nhollow lay in deep gloom.\n\nFred was lying on his elbow, sucking an unfilled, unlighted pipe.  Will\nlay on his side, too, with back toward both of us, ruminating.\nCoutlass and Brown were both asleep, but Coutlass awoke as I rolled\nover and struck him with my heel.  Nearly all the porters were snoring.\n\nIt was a sharp exclamation from the Greek that caused me to sit up and\nface due westward.  The others lay as they were.  It was the gloom in\nour hollow--the velvety shadows in which we lay with granite boulders\nscattered between us, and no alertness on our part that saved that day,\nalthough Coutlass acted instantly and creditably, once awake.\n\nSchillingschen stood there looking down on us, with his feet planted\nsquarely on the rim of the hollow, and Mauser rifle under one arm.  His\ngreat splay beard flowed sidewise in the evening wind.  One hand he\nheld over his eyes, trying to make out details in the dark, as stupid\nas we were.  He stood with his back to the setting sun, exposing\nhimself without any thought of the risk he ran, his huge, filled-out\nhead refusing stubbornly to take in the truth of what had happened.\nOnce convinced, the Prussian mind is not readily unconvinced.  He had\nassured himself long ago that our party was at the bottom of Victoria\nNyanza.\n\nThe second he did make out details he was swift to act, but that was\nalready too late, although he did not know it at the moment.  He threw\nup his rifle and laughed--a great deep guffaw from the stomach, that\nawoke every one.\n\n\"So, so!\" he gloated.  \"So Mr. Oakes and his fellow escaped convicts\nare alive after all!  Ha-ha-ho-ho!  So you followed me all this way,\nonly to forget that kites are curious!  A fine comfortless journey you\nmust have had, too!  There were twenty kites wheeling over you.  I\ncounted, and wondered.  Curiosity drove me to come and see.  The first\nman who moves a finger, Mr. Oakes, will die that instant!  Let your\nrifle lie where it is!\"\n\nIt would be no use pretending the man had not courage, at all events of\nthe sort that glories in the upper hand of a fight.  He chuckled, and\nreveled in our predicament, taking in, now that his eyes had grown\naccustomed to the darkness of our hollow, the utter lack of comforts or\nprovisions, and enjoying our disappointment.  He certainly knew himself\nmaster of the situation.\n\n\"I suspect you have a man of mine down there with you!\" he announced\npresently.  \"Is not that my Baganda?  Is he gagged?  Is he bound?\nLoose him, Mr. Oakes, at once!  I say at once!  Otherwise you die now!\"\n\nHe pointed his rifle directly at Fred, and the next second fired it,\nbut not intentionally.  Coutlass sprang from behind him, having crawled\nout through a shadow, and hit him so hard with a stone on the back of\nthe skull that he loosed off the rifle and pitched head-foremost down\namong us.  The Greek promptly jumped on top of him with a yell like a\nmaniac's, failing to land with both heels on his backbone by nothing\nbut luck.  As it was, he lost balance and sat down so hard on\nSchillingschen's head that there was no need of the energy with which\nwe all followed suit, piling all over him to pin him down like hounds\nthat have rolled their quarry over.\n\nThe German was stunned--knocked into utter oblivion--breathing like a\nsleeping drunkard, and bleeding freely from the nose.  Coutlass jumped\noff him and began to execute a war dance up and down, yelling like a\nmadman until Fred threatened him with the rifle and Will gagged him\nfrom behind.\n\n\"Do you want his armed men down on us, you ass?\"\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he laughed. \"I forgot about them!  Let us go and eat\ntheir supper!\"  He spoke as a man who had full right now to be\nconsidered a member in good standing.  We all noticed it, and exchanged\nglances; but that was no time for argument about men's rights.\n\nBrown was already over the rim of the hollow and making in the\ndirection of the tents.  We called him back and compelled him to stay\non guard over the prisoners, to his awful disgust, for he suspected\nthere was whisky among Schillingschen's \"chop-boxes.\"  But so did we!\nWe left all our boys with him except Kazimoto, threatening them with\nhitherto unheard of penalties if they dared as much as show a lock of\nhair above the rim of the hollow while we were gone.\n\nThen the rest of us, with Fred leading and Kazimoto last of all, crept\nout and sought the lowest level along which to reach the camp.  Will\nhad taken Schillingschen's rifle and went next after Fred.  Coutlass\nfollowed so close on my heels that more than once he trod on them, and\nonce so nearly tripped me that Fred called a halt behind some bushes\nand cursed me for clumsiness.\n\nBut it turned out to be easy hunting.  The ten boys had tied the\ndonkeys up to a rope in line and sat crooning while their supper cooked\nat a long bright fire.  We came up to Schillingschen's tent from\nbehind, crept around the side of it, and in a moment had three more\ngood weapons, I taking the big-bore elephant gun that had dealt with us\nso savagely on the lake, Coutlass seizing another Mauser, and Kazimoto\nadopting the shot-gun.\n\nThe rest was child's play.  We marched out of the tent all abreast and\ncalled on the ten boys to surrender, making them put up their hands\nuntil Coutlass had found their five rifles and ammunition.  They were\ntoo astonished even to ask questions.  Accustomed to Schillingschen's\ndespotic orders, they obeyed ours silently, showing no symptoms of\ntrying to bolt, having nowhere to bolt to; but we took precautions.\n\nKazimoto ran back to bring our party, and we took a coil of iron wire\nfrom Schillingschen's trade goods and fastened every prisoner's hands\nfirmly behind his back, including the unconscious German's.  That done,\nwe ate the meat, beans and vegetable supper that the ten had cooked.\n\nBrown and Coutlass found Schillingschen's whisky after that, and under\nits influence again swore ceaseless friendship beneath the\nnon-committal stars.  While they feasted we took Coutlass' rifle away\nas a plain precaution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nPARCERE SUBJECTIS?\n\n  'When the devil's at bay\n  Ye may kneel down and pray\n  For a year and a day\n  To be spared the distress of dispatching him,\n  But the longer ye kneel\n  The more squeamish ye'll feel\n  'Cause the louder he'll squeal,\n  And at brotherly talk there's no matching him.\n  Discussion's his aim,\n  And as sure as you're game\n  To give heed to the same,\n  You regarding extremes with compunction,\n  You may bet he'll requite\n  Your compassion with spite,\n  Knifing you in the night\n  With much probonopublico unction.\n\n\nFor a while we looked like having trouble with Coutlass. We gave Brown\na rifle, and distributed the other Mausers among Kazimoto and our best\nboys, but we did not dare trust the Greek with a weapon he might use\nagainst us, and he resented that bitterly.  He had an answer to Fred's\nsubterfuge that as a white man he would need a license before daring to\ncarry firearms.  \"I dare do anything!  I care nothing for law!\" he\nargued, and Fred nodded.\n\nThat night we reveled in luxury, for after the life we had led recently\nit took time to reaccustom any of us to the common comforts.\nSchillingschen traveled with every provision for his carcass and his\nbelly; and we plundered him.\n\nWe put the prisoners and our own porters in a hut in the nearest native\nvillage (less than half a mile away) under the watchful eye of Kazimoto\nand the shot-gun, dividing Schillingschen's two large tents between\nourselves.  The others offered me the camp-bed as a recent invalid, but\nI refused, and Will won it by matching coins.  We divided the blankets\nin the same way, and all the spare underwear.  Brown and Coutlass had\nto be satisfied with cotton blankets from a bale of trade goods; but\nwhen they had rifled enough to build up good thick mattresses as well\nas coverings, there were still two apiece for our boys and all the\nporters.\n\nThe chop-boxes were a revelation.  The man had with him food enough for\nat least a year's traveling, including all the canned delicacies that\nhungry men dream about in the wilderness.  Before we slept we ate so\nenormously of so very many things that it was a wonder that we were\nable to sleep at all.\n\nWe all hoped Schillingschen would die, for it was a hard problem what\nto do with him.  He had no papers in his possession, beyond a diary\nwritten in German schrift that even Will could not make head or tail\nof, for all his knowledge of the language; and a very vague map\nbearing the imprint of  the British government, filled in by himself\nwith the names of the villages he had passed on his way.  There was no\nproof that we could find that would have condemned him of nefarious\npractises in a British court of law.\n\n\"And believe me,\" argued Will, sprawling on the plundered bed, blowing\nthe smoke of a Melachrino through his nose, \"your local British judges\nwould take the word of Professor Schillingschen against all of ours,\nbacked up by simply overwhelming native evidence!  They're so in awe of\nSchillingschen's professorial degree, and of his passports, and his\nletters of introduction from this and that mogul that they wouldn't\nbelieve him guilty of arson if they caught him in the act!\"\n\n\"Something's got to be done with him pretty soon, though,\" answered\nFred from the floor, lying at ease on a pillow and a folded Jaeger\nblanket, smoking a fat cigar.\n\nCoutlass and Brown were singing songs outside the tent and I sat in a\ngenuine armchair with my feet on a box full of canned plum pudding.\n(Nobody knows, who has not hungered on the high or low veld--who has\nnot eaten meat without vegetables for days on end, and then porridge\nwithout salt or sugar--how good that common, export, canned plum\nPudding is!  To sit with my feet on the case that contained it was the\narrogance of affluence!)\n\n\"We have his stores and his papers,\" said I.  \"We have his Baganda;\nand as time goes on, and his other spies begin to come in, we shall\nhave them, too, if we're half careful.  Why don't we let him go, to\ntell his own tale wherever he likes?\"\n\n\"Maybe he'll die yet!\" said the optimist on the camp-bed, blowing more\ncigarette smoke.\n\n\"Suppose he doesn't.  We've done our best to keep him alive.  He's quit\nbleeding.  Suppose we let him go, and he lays a charge against us.\nSuppose they send after us and bring us in.  We've his diary and his\nmen--evidence enough,\" said I.\n\n\"You bally ass!\" Fred murmured.\n\n\"Cuckoo!\" laughed Will.\n\n\"I don't believe he'd dare approach a British official with his story,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Incredible imbecile!\" Fred answered.  \"He has the gall of a brass\nmonkey.\"\n\n\"And magnetism--loads of it,\" Will added.  \"He'd make the Pope play\nthree-card monte.\"\n\n\"To say nothing,\" continued Fred, \"of the necessity of not letting the\ngovernment know we're here!  Rather than turn him loose, I'd march him\ninto Kisumu and hand him over.  But, as Will says wisely, our\nproconsuls would believe him, and put us under bonds for outraging a\ndistinguished foreigner.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said I, \"what the devil shall we do with him?  Offer\nsomething constructive, you two solons!\"\n\n\"Have the four men we borrowed from the island bolted home yet?\"\nwondered Will.\n\n\"They hadn't this evening,\" I answered.  \"I don't believe they'll\nventure home until we stop feeding them.  They were hungry on their\nisland.  Our shortest commons then seemed affluence.  Now they're in\nheaven!\"\n\n\"Their canoes must be where they left them in the papyrus.\"\n\n\"Sure. Who'd steal a canoe?\"\n\n\"Whoever could find them,\" Fred answered.  \"But they're skilfully\nhidden.  Why don't we put Schillingschen and his ten pet blacks into\nthose canoes, with a little food and no rifles--and show them the way\nto German East?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said I, \"they wouldn't go.  They'd turn around and paddle\nfor Kisumu, to file complaint against us.\"\n\n\"Don't you suppose,\" suggested Will, \"that Schillingschen's own men 'ud\ninsist on going home?  Out on the water, ten to one, without guns or\ntoo much food, they wouldn't have the same fear of him they had\nformerly.\"\n\n\"That chance is too broad and long and deep,\" said Fred.  \"Altogether\ntoo bulky to be taken.  Let's sleep on it.  This cigar's done, and I'm\ndrowsy.  Are you quite sure Schillingschen's hands are fast behind him?\nThen good night, all!\"\n\nThe problem looked no easier next morning, with Schillingschen\nrecovered sufficiently to be hungry and sit up.  There was a look in\nhis eye of smoldering courage and assurance that did not bode well for\nus, and when we untwisted the iron wire from his wrists to let him wash\nhimself and eat he looked about him with a sort of quick-fire cunning\nthat belied his story of headache.\n\nHe was much too astute a customer to be judged superficially.  I\nwhispered to Fred not to shackle him again too soon, and sat near and\nwatched him, close enough for real safety, yet not so close that he\nmight not venture to try tricks.  He said nothing whatever, but I\nnoticed that his eye, after roving around the tent, kept returning\nagain and again to a chop-box that stood near the foot of the bed.\n\nNow I had unpacked that chop-box and repacked it the previous night.  I\nknew everything it contained--exactly how many cans of plum pudding.\nIt was the box I had rested my feet on.  I felt perfectly sure he knew\nas well as I what the box contained, and to suppose he would sit there\nplanning to recover canned food, however dainty, was ridiculous.\n\nWherefore it was a safe conclusion he was trying to deceive me as to\nhis real intention.  I put my foot on the box again, and he frowned, as\nmuch as to say I had forestalled his only hope.  Pretending to watch\nthe box and him, I examined every detail of the tent, particularly that\nside of it opposite the box, away from where it seemed he wanted me to\nlook.\n\nThe human eye is a highly imperfect piece of mechanism and the human\nbrain is mostly grayish slush.  It was minutes before I detected the\nedge of his diary, sticking out from the pocket of Fred's shooting coat\nthat itself protruded from under the folded blanket on which Fred had\nslept.  It was nearer to Schillingschen than to me.  After watching him\nfor about fifteen minutes, during which he made a great fuss about his\nheadache, I was quite sure it was the diary that interested him.\n\nI stooped and extracted it from the coat pocket.  The grimace he made\nwas certainly not due to headache.\n\n\"Fred!\" I called out, and he and Will came striding in together.\n\n\"That diary's the key,\" I said.  \"It's important.  It holds his\nsecrets!\"\n\nWill was swift to put that to the test.\n\n\"What will you offer?\" he asked Schillingschen.  \"We want you to go\nback direct to German East.  Will you go, if we give you back your\ndiary?\"\n\nSchillingschen blundered into the trap like a buffalo in strange\nsurroundings.\n\n\"Ja wohl!\" he answered.  \"Give me that, and yon shall never see me\nagain!\"\n\nAt that Fred threw himself full length on his blanket and took one of\nSchillingschen's cigars.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"you would give anything for leave to take those\nwords back!  You needn't try to hide the wince--we fully appreciate the\nsituation!  What do you say, you fellows?  How about last night's idea?\nWho mooted it?  Shall we send him back by canoe to German East, with a\nguarantee that if he doesn't go we'll hand over diary and him to our\ngovernment?\"\n\n\"Better send the book to the commissioner at Nairobi, or Mombasa, or\nwherever he is,\" suggested Will.  \"Then if the 'prof' here doesn't get\na swift move on he's liable to be overtaken by the cops, I should say.\"\n\n\"Let's make no promises,\" said I.  \"I vote we simply give him time to\nget away.\"\n\nAt that the Germain saw the weak side of our case in a flash.\n\n\"If you dared give that diary to your government,\" he growled, \"you\nwould do so without bargaining with me!  Why do you propose to let me\ngo?  Out of love for me?  No!  But because you dare not appeal to your\ngovernment!  Give me that diary, and I will go at once to German East,\nnot otherwise!  It is only a diary,\" he added.  \"Nothing\nimportant--merely my private jottings and memoranda.\"\n\nFred turned toward me so that Schillingschen could not see his face.\n\n\"Are you willing to start for Kisumu at once with that book?\" he asked,\nand I nodded.  He winked at me so violently that I could not trust\nmyself to answer aloud and keep a straight face.\n\n\"Very well,\"' he said.  \"Suppose you start with it to-morrow morning.\nAt the end of a week well turn the professor home to follow his own\nnose!\"\n\nSchillingschen shrugged his shoulders and refused to be drawn into\nfurther argument.  We gave him a good meal from his own provisions, and\nthen once more made his hands fast with wire behind him and left him to\nsleep off his rage if he cared to in a corner of the tent.\n\nLater that morning we sent for the Baganda--gave him a view of\nSchillingschen trussed and helpless--and questioned him about the man\nhe boasted he knew, who could tell us what Schillingschen was after.\nHe was so full of fear by that time that he held back nothing.\n\nHe assured us the German was after buried ivory.  There was a man, who\nhad promised to meet Schillingschen, who knew where to find the ivory\nand would lead the way to it.  He did not know names or places--knew\nonly that the man would be found waiting at a certain place, and was\nnot white.\n\n\"How did you get that information?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"By listening.\"\n\n\"When?  Where?\"\n\n\"At night, months ago, in Nairobi, outside the professor's tent.  I lay\nunder the fly among the loads and listened.  The man came in the dark,\nand went in the dark.  I did not see him.  I did not hear him called by\nname.  He must have been an old man.  Speaking Kiswahili, he admitted\nhe knew where the ivory is.  He said he saw it buried, and that he\nalone survives of all men who buried it.  He promised to lead the\nprofessor to the place on condition that the Germans shall release his\nbrother, and his brother's wife, and two sons whom they keep in prison\non a life-sentence.  The professor agreed, but said, 'Wait!  There are\nfirst those people who also think they know the secret.  Perhaps they\ndo!  Wait until after I have dealt with them.  Then you shall take me\nto the place!  After that your criminal relations shall be pardoned!\nHere is money.  Go and wait for me at the place we spoke of when we\ntalked before.'\"\n\nWe each cross-examined him in turn, but could not make him change his\nstory in any essential.  He merely exaggerated the parts that he\nguessed might please us, and begged to be allowed to run before\nSchillingschen could break loose and get after him.\n\nBy noontime, when we gave him his second meal, Schillingschen had made\nup his own mind that his case was desperate and called for heroic\nremedy.\n\n\"All right,\" he growled.  \"I need that diary.  Hand it to me and I'll\ntell you how to find what you're after!\"\n\n\"You mean about the man who's to meet you?\" suggested Fred blandly.\n\nSchillingschen started as if shot.\n\n\"One of your men is an eavesdropper,\" Fred assured him with a cheerful\nnod.  \"That plug has been pulled already, Professor!\"\n\n\"Let's play the cards face up!\" Will interrupted impatiently.  \"Listen,\nSchillingschen.  You're an all-in scoundrel.  You're a spy.  You're a\nbloody murderer of women and defenseless natives.  If we could prove\nthat we wouldn't argue with you.  We know you burned that dhow with the\nwomen in it, but we've got no evidence, that's all.  We know the German\ngovernment wants that ivory, and we know why.  We also want it.  Our\nonly reason for secrecy is that we hope for better terms from the\nBritish government.  We've nothing to fear, except possible financial\nloss.  If you prefer to come with us to Kisumu and have the whole\nmatter out in court, all you need do is just say so.  On the other\nhand, if you want to get out of this country before your diary can\nreach the hands of the British High Commissioner--you'd just better\nslide, that's all!\"\n\n\"You've only until dawn to think it over,\" remarked Fred.  \"You poor\nboob!\" continued Will.  \"You imagine we're criminals because you're one\nyourself!  The difference between your offer and ours is that you're\nbluffing and we know it, whereas we're not bluffing by as much as a\nhair, and the quicker you see that the better for you!\"\n\n\"Oh, rats!  Let's take him in with us to Kisumu!\" said I, and at that\nProfessor Schillingschen capitulated.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said.  \"Kurtz und gut. I will leave the country.  Permit\nme to take only food enough, and my porters, and one gun!\"\n\n\"No guns!\" said Fred promptly.\n\nSchillingschen sighed resignedly, and we went out of the tent to talk\nover ways and means.  In spite of our recent experience of Germany's\ncolonial government we were still so ignorant of the workings of the\nmens germanica that we took his surrender at face value.\n\nThe problem of getting him down to the lake shore safely was none too\nsimple.  I was soft hearted and headed enough to propose that we should\nloose his hands, now that he had surrendered, and permit him reasonable\nliberty.  Will--least inclined of all of us to cruelty--was disposed to\nagree with me.  We might have overborne Fred's objections if Coutlass\nand Brown, returning from walking off their overnight debauch together,\nhad not shouted and beckoned us in a mysterious sort of way, as if some\nnew discovery puzzled them.\n\nWe walked about a hundred and fifty yards to where they stood by a row\nof low ant-hills.  Neither of them was in a sociable frame of mind.  It\nwas obvious from the moment we could see their faces clearly that they\nhad not called us to enjoy a joke.  They stood like two dumb bird-dogs,\npointing, and we had to come about abreast of them before we knew why\nwe were summoned.\n\nThere lay five clean-picked skeletons, one on each ant-hill.  One was a\nbig bird's; one looked like a dog's; the third was a snake's; the\nfourth a young antelope's; and the fifth was certainly that of a\nyellow village cur, for some of the hairs from the tip of its tail were\nremaining, not yet borne off by the ants.\n\nThe skeletons lay as if the creatures had died writhing.  There were\npegs driven into the earth that had evidently held them in position by\nthe sinews.  Most peculiar circumstance of all, there was a camp-chair\nstanding very near by, with its feet deep in the red earth, as if a\nvery heavy man had sat in it.\n\nI went back to the camp and told Kazimoto to bring one of the\nprofessor's men.  Kazimoto had to do the talking, for we did not know\nthe man's language, nor he ours.\n\nYes, the professor always did that to animals.  He liked to sit and\nwatch them and keep the kites away.  He said it was white man's\nknowledge (science?).  Yes, the animals were pegged out alive on the\nant-hills, and the professor would sit with his watch in his hand,\ncounting the minutes until they ceased from writhing.  It was part of\nthe duty of the ten to catch animals and bring them alive to him in\ncamp for that purpose.  No, they did not know why he did it, except\nthat it was white man's knowledge.  No, natives did not do that way,\nexcept now and then to their enemies.  The professor always made\nthreats he would do so to them if they ran away from him, or disobeyed,\nor misbehaved.  Certainly they believed him!  Why should they not\nbelieve him?  Did not Germans always keep their word when they talked\nof punishment?\n\nWe decided after that to let Schillingschen lie bound, whether or not\nthe iron wire cut his wrists.  We did not trouble to go back to inquire\nwhether he needed drink, but let him wait for that until supper-time.\nThe remainder of that afternoon we spent discussing who should have the\ndisagreeable and not too easy task of taking the professor to the lake\nand sending him on his way.  We sat with our backs against a rock, with\nthe firearms beside us and a good view of all the countryside, very\nmuch puzzled as to whether to leave Coutlass behind in camp (with Brown\nand the whisky) or send him (with or without Brown) and one or two of\nus on the errand.  He was a dangerous ally in either case.\n\nEvening fell, and the good smell of supper came along the wind to find\nus still undecided.  We returned to the tent thinking that perhaps\nsomething Schillingschen himself might say would help us to decide one\nway or the other.\n\n\"Better see if the brute wants a drink,\" said Fred, and I went in ahead\nto offer him water.\n\nHe was gone!  Clean gone, without a trace, or a hint as to how he\nmanaged it!  I called the others, and we hunted.  The sides of the tent\nwere pegged down tight all around.  The front, it is true, was wide\nopen, but we had sat in full view of it and not so much as a rat could\nhave crept out without our seeing.  There were no signs of burrowing.\nHe was not under the bed, or behind the boxes, or between the sides of\nthe tent and the fly.  The only cover for more than a hundred yards was\nthe shallow depression along which we had come to the capture of the\ncamp, and that was the way he must have taken.  But that, too, had been\npractically in full view of us all the time.\n\nWe counted heads and called the roll.  Coutlass was close by.  It did\nnot look as if he had played traitor this time.  Brown was sleeping off\nhis headache in the shade.  Kazimoto and all the boys were accounted\nfor.  The prisoners were safe.  No donkeys were missing--no\nfirearms--and no loads.  The earth had simply opened up and swallowed\nSchillingschen, and that was all about it!\n\nHe had not made off with his pocket diary.  Fred had that.  There and\nthen we packed it in an empty biscuit tin and buried it under a rock,\nWill and I keeping watch while Fred did the digging and covering up.\nIt was too likely that Schillingschen would come back in the night and\ntry to steal it for any of us to care about keeping it on his person.\n\nIt was too late to look far and wide for him that evening.  A hunter\nsuch as he could have lain unseen in the dark with us almost stepping\non him.  Gone was all appetite for supper!  We nibbled, and swore, and\nsmoked--locked up the whisky--defied either Brown or Coutlass to try to\nbreak the boxes open--and arranged to take turns on sentry-go all that\nnight, Will, Fred, and I--declining very pointedly offers by the other\ntwo to have their part in keeping watch.  In spite of lack of evidence\nwe suspected Coutlass; and we knew no particular reason for having\nconfidence in Brown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\n\nTHE SONG OF THE DARK-LORDS\n\n  Turn in!  Turn in!  The jungle lords come forth\n        Cat-footed, blazing-eyed--the owners of the dark,\n  What though ye steal the day! We know the worth\n        Of vain tubes spitting at a phantom mark\n  With only human eyes to guide the fire!\n        Tremble, ye hairless ones, who only see by day,\n  The night is ours!  Who challenges our ire?\n        Urrumph!  Urrarrgh!  Turn in there!  Way!\n\n  Ye come with iron lines and dare to camp\n        Where we were lords when Daniel stood a test!\n  Where once the tired safaris used to tramp\n        On noisy wheels ye loll along at rest!\n  Tremble, ye long-range lovers of the day,\n        'Twas we who shook the circus walls of ancient Rome!\n  The dark is ours!  Take cover!  Way there!  Way!\n        Urmmph!  Urrarrgh!  Take cover!  Home!\n\n\nThe man who tries to explain away coincidences to men who were the\nvictims of them is likely to need more sympathy than he will get.  The\ndictionary defines them clumsily as instances of coinciding, apparently\naccidental, but which suggest a casual connection.\n\nLions paid us a visit that first night after Schillingschen's\nescape--the first lions we had seen or heard since landing on the north\nshore of the lake.  We prayed they might get Schillingschen, yet they\nand he persisted until morning--they roaring and circling never near\nenough for the man on guard to get a shot--he also circling the camp,\ncalling to his ten men, whom we had transferred from the native village\nto the second tent under guard of Kazimoto and our own men as a\nprecaution.\n\nOur boys slept as if drugged, but not his.  He called to them in a\nlanguage that even Kazimoto did not understand, and they kept answering\nat intervals.  Once, when I was listening to locate Schillingschen if I\ncould, the lions came sniffing and snuffing to the back side of the\ntent.  I tried to stalk them--a rash, reprehensible, tenderfoot trick.\nLuck was with me; they slunk away in the shadows, and I lived to\nsummon Fred and Will.  We tried to save the donkeys, but the lions took\nthree of them at their leisure, and scared the rest so that they broke\nout of the thorn-bush boma we had made the boys build (as a precaution\nagainst leopards, not lions).  Next morning out of forty we recovered\ntwenty-five, and wondered how many of them Schillingschen got.\n\nRemembering how we ourselves had managed, without ammunition or\nsupplies, we did not fool ourselves with the belief that\nSchillingschen, with his brutal personal magnetism and profound\nknowledge of natives, would not do better.  The probability was he\nwould stir up the countryside against us.\n\nHe had been doing missionary work; it might be the natives of that\npart were already sufficiently schooled to do murder at his bidding.\n\nWe decided to leave at once for a district where he had not yet done\nany of his infernal preaching.\n\n\"You should set a trap and shoot the swine!\" Coutlass insisted.  Will\nwas inclined to agree with him, but Fred and I demurred.  The British\nwrit had never really run as far as the slopes of Elgon, and we could\nsee them ahead of us not very many marches away.  If Schillingschen\nintended to dog us and watch chances we preferred to have him do that\nin a remote wilderness, where our prospect of influencing natives would\nlikely be as good as his, that was all.\n\nPart of our strategy was to make an early start and march swiftly,\ntaking advantage of his physical weariness after a night in the open on\nthe prowl; but after a few days in camp it is the most difficult thing\nimaginable to get a crowd of porters started on the march.  It was more\nparticularly difficult on that occasion because none of our men were\nfamiliar with Schillingschen's loads, and the captured ten, even when\nwe loosed their hands and treated them friendly, showed no disposition\nto be useful.  We gave them a load apiece to carry, but to every one we\nhad to assign two of our own as guards, so that, what with having lost\nthe fifteen donkeys, we had not a man to spare.\n\nIt was after midday when we got off at last.  We had not left the camp\nmore than half a mile behind when I looked back and saw Schillingschen\nwhere his great tent had stood, cavorting on hands and feet like an\nenormous dog-baboon, searching every inch of the ground for anything we\nmight have left.  We three stood and watched him for half an hour,\nsweating with fear lest he chance on the place where his diary lay\nburied in the tin box.  We began to wish we had brought it with us.  I\nsaid we had done foolishly to leave it, although I had approved of\nFred's burying it at the time.\n\n\"Suppose,\" I argued, \"he sets the natives of that village to searching!\nWhat's to prevent him?  You know the kind of job they'd make of\nit--blade by blade of grass--pebble by pebble.  Where they found a\ntrace of loosened dirt they'd dig.\"\n\n\"Did you bury something, then?\" inquired a voice we knew too well.  \"By\nthe ace of stinks, those natives can smell out anything a white man\never touched!\"\n\nWe turned and faced Coutlass, whom we had imagined on ahead with the\nsafari.  If he noticed our sour looks, he saw fit to ignore them; but\nhe took an upperhanded, new, insolent way with us, no doubt due to our\nrefusal to shoot Schillingschen.  He ascribed that to a yellow streak.\n\n\"I was right.  Gassharamminy!  I could have sworn I saw two of you on\nwatch while the third man dug among the stones!  What did you bury?  I\ncame back to talk about Brown.  The poor drunkard wants to head more to\nthe east.  I say straight on.  What do you say?\"\n\nWe told him to go forward.  Then we looked in one another's eyes, and\nsaid nothing.  Whether or not the original decision had been wise,\nthere was no question now what was the proper course.\n\nInstead of tiring out Schillingschen we made an early camp by a\nwatercourse, and built a very big protection for the donkeys against\nlions--a high thorn enclosure, and an outer one not so high, with a\nspace between them wide enough for the two tents and half a dozen big\nfires.  Before dark we had enough fuel stacked up to keep the fires\nblazing well all night long.\n\nNeither Coutlass nor Brown had had a drink of whisky that day, so it\nwas all the more remarkable that Coutlass lay down early in a corner of\nthe tent and fell into a sound sleep almost at once.  We were\nthoroughly glad of it.  Our plan was for two of us to creep out of camp\nwhen it was dark enough, and recover the contents of that tin box\nbefore Schillingschen or the blacks could forestall us.\n\nThe lions began roaring again at about sundown, but they love\ndonkey-meat more than almost any except giraffe, and it was not likely\nthey would trouble us.  We were so sure the task was not particularly\nrisky that Fred, who would have insisted on the place of greater danger\nfor himself, consented willingly enough to stay in camp while Will and\nI went back.  Our original intention was to take Schillingschen's\npatent, wind-proof, non-upsettable camp lantern to find the way with\nand keep wild beasts at bay; but just as Will went toward the tent to\nfetch it (Fred's back was turned, over on the far side where he was\nseeing to the camp-fires) we both at once caught sight of Coutlass\ncreeping on hands and knees along a shadow.  We had closed the gap in\nthe outer wall of thorn, but he dragged aside enough to make an opening\nand slipped through, thinking himself unobserved.\n\nTo have followed him with a lantern would have been worse than my crime\nof stalking lions in the dark.  Will ran to tell Fred what had happened\nwhile I followed the Greek through the gap, and presently Will and I\nwere both hot on his trail, as close to him as we could keep without\nletting him hear us.\n\n\"Fred says,\" Will whispered, \"if we catch him talking with\nSchillingschen, shoot 'em both!  Fred won't let him into camp again\nunless we bring back proof he's not a traitor!\"\n\nWe were pursuing a practised hunter, who at first kept stopping to make\nsure he was not followed.  He took a line across that wild country in\nthe dark with such assurance, and so swiftly that it was unbelievably\nhard to follow him quietly.  It was not long before we lost sound of\nhim.  Then we ran more freely, trusting to luck as much as anything to\nkeep him thinking he had the darkness to himself.\n\nOur short day's journey seemed to have trebled itself!  We were\nleg-weary and tired-eyed when at last we reached, and nearly fell into\na hollow we recognized.  Will went down and struck a match to get a\nlook at his watch.\n\n\"There ought to be a moon in about ten minutes,\" he whispered.  \"We're\nwithin sight of the place.  Suppose we climb a tree and scout about a\nbit.\"\n\nIt was not a very big tree that we selected, but it was the biggest;\nit had low branches, and the merit of being easy to climb.\n\nWhen the pale latter half of the moon announced itself we could dimly\nmake out from the upper branches all of the flat ground where the camp\nhad been.  There was no sign of Coutlass.  None of Schillingschen.  A\nlioness and two enormous lions stood facing one another in a triangle,\nalmost exactly on the spot where the larger tent had stood, not fifty\nyards from us.\n\n\"Gee!\"' whispered Will excitedly.  \"We nearly stumbled on 'em!\"\n\n\"Shoot!\" I whispered.  My own position on the branch was so insecure\nthat I could not have brought my rifle into use without making a\nprodigious noise.  Will shook his head.\n\n\"I can see Coutlass now!  Look at that rock--he's hiding behind\nit--see, he's climbing!  And look, there's Schillingschen!\"\n\nNeither man was aware of the other's presence, or of ours.  They were\nout of sight of each other, Coutlass on the very rocks against which we\nhad leaned to watch the tent the afternoon before, and neither man\nreally out of reach of anything with claws that cared to go after them\nin earnest.\n\nThe arrival of the dim moon seemed to give the lions their cue for\naction.  The lioness turned half away, as if weary of waiting, and then\nlay down full-length to watch as one lion sprang at the other with a\nroar like the wrath of warring worlds.  They met in mid-air, claw to\nclaw, and went down together--a roaring, snarling, eight-legged,\ntwo-tailed catastrophe--never apart--not still an instant--tearing,\nbeating--rolling over and over--emitting bellows of mingled rage and\nagony whenever the teeth of one or other brute went home.\n\nEven as shadows fighting in the shadows they were terrible to watch.\nThey shook the very earth and air, as if they owned all the primeval\nbestial force of all the animals.  And the she-lion lay watching them,\nher eyes like burning yellow coals, not moving a muscle that we could\nsee.\n\nIron could not have withstood the blows; the thunder of them reached\nus in the tree!  Steel ropes could not have endured the strain as claws\nwent home, and the brutes wrenched, ripped, and yelled in titanic\nagony.  Their fury increased.  Wounds did not seem to enfeeble them.\nNothing checked the speed of the fighting an instant, until suddenly\nthe lioness stood erect, gave a long loud call like a cat's, and turned\nand vanished.\n\nShe had seen.  She knew.  Like a spring loosed from its containing box\none of the lions freed himself in mid-air and hurtled clear, landing on\nall-fours and hurrying away after the lioness with a bad limp.  The\nother lion fell on his side and lay groaning, then roared\nhalf-heartedly and dragged himself away.\n\nThe second lion had hardly gone when Coutlass descended gingerly from\nthe rock, peering about him, and listening.  He evidently had no\nsuspicion of our presence, for he never once looked in our direction.\nIt was Schillingschen, not lions, he feared; and Schillingschen,\nclambering over the top of another rock, watched him as a night-beast\neyes its prey.  Another one-act drama was staged, and it was not time\nfor us to come down from the tree yet.\n\nSatisfied he was not followed and that Schillingschen was elsewhere,\nCoutlass crept from rock to rock toward the little cluster of small\nones where, by his own confession, he had seen Fred bury the box.\nSchillingschen stalked him through the shadows as actively as a great\nape, making no sound, as clearly visible to us as he was invisible to\nCoutlass.\n\nThere was not a trace of mist--nothing to obscure the dim pale light,\nand as the moon swung higher into space we could see both men's every\nmovement, like the play of marionettes.\n\nDown on his knees at last among the small loose rocks, Coutlass began\ndigging with his fingers--grew weary of that very soon, and drew out\nthe long knife from his boot--dug with that like a frenzied man until\nfrom our tree we heard the hard point strike on metal.  Then\nSchillingschen began to close in, and it was time for us to drop down\nfrom the tree.\n\nWe made an abominable lot of noise about it, for the tree creaked, and\nour clothing tore on the thorny projections of limbs that seemed to\nhave grown there since we climbed.  To make matters worse, I stepped\noff the lowest branch, imagining there was another branch beneath it,\nand fell headlong, rifle and all, with a clatter and thump that should\nhave alarmed the village half a mile away.  And Will, not knowing what\nI had done but alarmed by the noise I made, jumped down on top of me.\n\nWe picked ourselves up and listened.  We could hear the short quick\nstabs of the knife as Coutlass loosed and scooped the earth out.  Among\nthe myriad noises of the African night our own, that seemed appalling\nto us, had passed unnoticed--or perhaps Schillingschen heard, and\nthought it was the injured lion dragging himself away.  (Nobody needed\nworry about the chance of attack from that particular lion for many a\nnight to come; he would ask nothing better than to be left to eat mice\nand carrion until his awful wounds were healed.)\n\nReassured by the sound of digging we crept forward, knowing pretty well\nthe best path to take from having seen Schillingschen stalking.  But it\nwas more by dint of their obsession than by any skill of ours that we\ncrept up near without giving them alarm.  Coutlass was still on his\nknees, throwing out the last few handfuls of loose dirt.\nSchillingschen stood almost over him, so close that the thrown dirt\nstruck against his legs.\n\nWe took up positions in the shadow, one to either side, almost afraid\nto breathe, I cursing because the rifle quivered in my two hands like\nthe proverbial aspen leaf.  The prospect of shooting a white man--even\nsuch a thorough-paced blackguard white as Schillingschen--made me as\nnervous as a school-girl at a grown-up party.\n\nAt last Coutlass groped down shoulder-deep and drew the box out.\n\n\"Give that to me!\"  Schillingschen shouted like a thunder-clap, making\nme jump as if I were the one intended.\n\nThe moonlight gleamed on the tin box.  Coutlass did not drop it but\nturned his head to look behind him.  Schillingschen swung for his face\nwith a clenched fist and the whole weight and strength of his ungainly\nbody.  He would have broken the jaw he aimed at had the blow landed;\nbut the Greek's wit was too swift.\n\nHe kicked like a mule, hard and suddenly, ducking his head, and then\ndiving backward between the German's legs that were outspread to give\nhim balance and leverage for the fist-blow.  Schillingschen pitched\nover him head-forward, landing on both hands with one shoulder in the\nhole out of which the box had come.  With the other arm he reached for\nthe knife that Coutlass had laid on the loose earth.  Coutlass reached\nfor it, too, too late, and there followed a fight not at all inferior\nin fury to the battle of the lions.  Humans are only feebler than the\nbeasts, not less malicious.\n\nWill reached for the tin box, opened it, took out the diary, closed it\nagain, put the diary in his own inner pocket, and returned the box;\nbut they never saw or heard him.  The German, with an arm as strong as\nan ape's, thrust again and again at Coutlass, missing his skin by a\nbait's breadth as the Greek held off the blows with the utmost strength\nof both hands.\n\nSuddenly Coutlass sprang to his feet, broke loose for a second, landed\na terrific kick in the German's stomach, and closed again.  He twisted\nSchillingschen's great splay beard into a wisp and wrenched it, forcing\nhis head back, holding the knife-hand in his own left, and spitting\nbetween the German's parted teeth; then threw all his weight on him\nsuddenly, and they went down together, Coutlass on top and\nSchillingschen stabbing violently in the direction of his ribs.\n\nLetting go the beard, Coutlass rained blows on the German's face with\nhis free fist.  Made frantic by that assault Schillingschen squirmed\nand upset the Greek's balance, rolled him partly over and, blinded by a\nvery rain of blows, slashed and stabbed half a dozen times.  Coutlass\nscreamed once, and swore twice as the knife got in between his bones.\nThe German could not wrench it out again.  With both hands free now,\nthe Greek seized him by the throat and began to throttle him, beating\nwith his forehead on the purple face the while his steel fingers\nkneaded, as if the throat were dough.\n\nWe were not at all inclined to stop Coutlass from killing the man.  We\ncame closer, to see the end, and Coutlass caught sight of us at last.\n\n\"Shoot him!\" he screamed.  \"Gassharamminy!  Shoot him, can't you, while\nI hold him!\"\n\nAs he made that appeal the German convulsed his whole body like an\nearthquake, wrenched the knife loose at last, and as Coutlass changed\nposition to guard against a new terrific stab rolled him over, freed\nhimself and stood with upraised hand to give the finishing blow.  Then\nsuddenly he saw us and his jaw dropped, the beastly mess that had been\nhis well-kept beard dropping an inch and showing where the Greeks fist\nhad broken the front teeth.  But that was only for a second--a second\nthat gave Coutlass time to rise to his knees, and dodge the descending\nblow.\n\nI made up my mind then it was time to shoot the German, whatever the\ncrimes of the Greek might be; but Coutlass had not grown slower of wit\nfrom loss of blood.  As he dodged he rolled sidewise and seized my\nrifle, jerking it from my hand.  He jerked too quickly.  The German saw\nthe move and kicked it, sending it spinning several yards away.  We all\nmade a sudden scramble for it, Schillingschen leading, when the German\nturned as suddenly as one of the great apes he so resembled, tripped\nWill by the heel, wrenched the rifle from his right hand, pounced on\nthe empty tin box, and was gone!\n\nToo late, I remembered my own rifle and fired after him, emptying the\nmagazine at shadows.\n\nWill's rage and self-contempt were more distressing than the Greek's\nspouting knife-wounds.\n\n\"By blood and knuckle-bones!  Give me that gun of yours, will you!  I\ngo after the swine!  I cut his liver out!  Where is my knife?  Ah,\nthere it is!  Stoop and give it me, for my ribs hurt!  So!  Now I go\nafter him!\"\n\nWe held Coutlass back, making him be still while we tore his shirt in\nstrips, and then our own, and tried to staunch the blood, Will almost\nblubbering with rage while his fingers worked, and the Greek cursing us\nboth for wasting time.\n\n\"He has the box!\" he screamed.  \"He has the rifle!\"\n\n\"He has no ammunition but what's in the magazine,\" said I; and that\nstarted Will off swearing at himself all over again from the beginning.\n\n\"You damned yegg!\" he complained as he knotted two strips of shirt.\n\"This would never have happened if you hadn't sneaked out to steal the\ncontents of the box!\"\n\nSuddenly Coutlass screamed again, like a mad stallion smelling battle.\n\n\"There he is!  There the swine is!  I see him!  I hear him! Give me\nthat--\"\n\nHe reached for my rifle,  but I was too quick that time and stepped\nback out of range of his arm.  As I did that the blood burst anew from\nhis wounds.  He put his left hand to his side and scattered the hot\nblood up in the air in a sort of votive offering to the gods of Greek\nrevenge, and, brandishing the long knife, tore away into the dark.\n\n\"I see him!\" he yelled.  \"I see the swine!  By Gassharamminy!  To-night\nhis naked feet'll blister on the floor of hell!\"\n\nWe followed him, enthralled by mixed motives made of desire and a sort\nof half-genuine respect for the courage of this man, who claimed three\ncountries and disgraced each one at intervals in turn.  We did not go\nso fast as he.  We were not so enamored of the risks the dark contained.\n\nSuddenly there came out of the blackness just ahead a marrow-curdling\ncry--agony, rage, and desperation--that surely no human ever\nuttered--roar, yelp of pain, and battle-cry in one.\n\n\"Help!\" yelled Coutlass.  \"Help!  Oh-ah!  Ah!\"\n\nWe raced forward then, I leading with my rifle thrust forward.  A\nsecond later I fired; and that was the only time in my life I ever\ntouched a lion's face with a rifle muzzle before I pulled the trigger!\nThe brute fell all in a heap, with Coutlass underneath him and the\nGreek's long knife stuck in his shoulder to the hilt.  The lion must\nhave died within the minute without my shot to finish him.\n\nCoutlass lay dead under the defeated beast that had crawled away to\nhide and lick his wounds.  We dragged his body out from under, and in\nproof that Schillingschen, the common enemy, lived, a bullet came\nwhistling between us.  The flash of my shot had given him direction.\nPerhaps he could see us, too, against the moon.  We ducked, and lay\nstill, but no more shots came.\n\n\"He's only got four left,\" Will whispered.  \"Maybe he'll husband those!\"\n\n\"Maybe he knows by now that box is empty!\" said I.  \"He'll stalk us on\nthe way back!\"\n\n\"Us for the tree, then, until morning!\" said Will.\n\n\"Sure!\" I answered.  \"And be shot out of it like crows out of a nest!\"\n\nBut Will had the right idea for all that.  He was merely getting at it\nin his own way.  After a little whispering we went to work with fevered\nfingers, stripping off the bloody bandages we had tied on the Greek's\nribs--stripping off more of his clothes--then more of ours--tying them\nall into one--then skinning the mangled lion with the long knife that\nhad really ended his career, tearing the hide into strips and knotting\nthem each to each.  In twenty minutes we had a slippery, smeary, smelly\nrope of sorts.  In five more we had dragged the Greek's dead body\nunderneath the tree.\n\nThen I went back to the vantage point among the rocks and waited until\nWill had thrown the rope with a stone tied to its end over an upper\nbranch.  Presently I saw Coutlass' dead body go clambering ungracefully\nup among the branches, looking so much less dead than alive that I\nthought at first Will must have tangled the rope in the crotch of the\ntree and be clambering up to release it.\n\nThe ruse worked.  Georges Coutlass served us dead as well as living.\nOut of the darkness to my left there came a flash and a report.  I did\nnot look to see whether the corpse in the tree jerked as the bullet\nstruck.  Before the flash had died--almost before the crack of the\nreport bad reached my ear-drums I answered with three shots in quick\nsuccession.\n\n\"Did you get him?\" called Will.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered.  \"If I didn't, he's only got three\ncartridges left!\"\n\nWe left the Greek's body in the tree for Schillingschen to shoot at\nfurther if he saw fit; it was safer there from marauding animals than\nif we had laid it on the ground, and as for the rites of the dead, it\nwas a toss-up which was better, kites and vultures, or jackals and the\nants.  We saw no sense that night in laboring with a knife and our\nhands to bury a body that the brutes would dig up again within five\nminutes of our leaving it.\n\n\"Schillingschen has three cartridges,\"' sad Will. \"One each for you, me\nand Fred Oakes!  I'll stay and trick him some more.  I'll think up a\nnew plan.  I don't care if he gets me.  I'd hate to face Fred without\nmy rifle, and have to tell him the enemy is laying for him with it\nthrough my carelessness.\"\n\nIt was my first experience of Will with hysteria, for it amounted to\nthat.  I remembered that to cure a bevy of school-girls of it one\nshould rap out something sharply, with a cane if need be.  Yet Will was\nnot like a school-girl, and his hysteria took the pseudo-manly form of\nrefusal to retreat.  I yearned for Fred's camp-fires, and Fred's laugh,\nhot supper, or breakfast, or whatever the meal would be, and blankets.\nWill, with a ruthless murderer stalking him in the dark, yearned only\nfor self-contentment.  All at once I saw the thing to do, and thrust my\nrifle in his hands.\n\n\"Take it,\" I said.  \"Hunt Schillingschen all night if you want to.  I'm\ngoing back to tell Fred I've lost my rifle, and was afraid to face you\nfor fear you'd laugh at me.  Go on--take it!  No, you've got to take\nit!\"\n\nI let the rifle fall at his feet, and he was forced to pick it up.  By\nthat time I was on my way, and he had to hurry if he hoped to catch me.\nI kept him hurrying--cursing, and calling out to wait.  And so, hours\nlater, we arrived in sight of Fred's fires and answered his cheery\nchallenge:\n\n\"Halt there, or I'll shoot your bally head off!\"\n\nLions had kept him busy making the boys pile thornwood on the fires.\nHe had shot two--one inside the enclosure, where the brute had jumped\nin a vain effort to reach the frantic donkeys.  We stumbled over the\ncarcass of the other as we made our way toward the gate-gap, and\ndragged it in ignominiously by the tail (not such an easy task as the\nuninitiated might imagine).\n\nOnce within the enclosure I left Will to tell Fred his story as best\nsuited him, Fred roaring with laughter as he watched Will's rueful\nface, yet turning suddenly on Brown to curse him like a criminal for\nlaughing, too!\n\n\"Go and fetch that Mauser of yours, Brown, and give it to Mr. Yerkes in\nplace of what he's lost!  Hurry, please!\"\n\nIt was touch and go whether Brown would obey.  But he happened to be\nsober, and realized that he had committed tho unpermissible offense.\nFred might laugh at Will all he chose; so might I; either of us might\nlaugh Fred out of countenance; or they might howl derisively at me.\nBut Brown, camp-fellow though he was, and not bad fellow though he was,\nwas not of our inner-guard.  He might laugh with, never at, especially\nwhen catastrophe brought inner feelings to the surface.\n\n\"Take the shot-gun if you care to,\" Fred told him, as he passed Will\nthe rifle. \"I'll unlock the chop-box presently, and let you have some\nwhisky!\"\n\nThis last was the cruellest cut, but it did Brown good.  When Fred kept\nhis promise and produced a whole bottle from the locked-up store Brown\nrefused to touch it, instead insulting him like a good man, cursing\nhim--whisky, whiskers, whims and all, using language that Fred\ngood-naturedly assured him was very unladylike.\n\nBefore dawn the boys, peering through the gaps between the camp-fires,\nto distinguish lions if they could and give the alarm before another\ncould jump in and do damage, swore they saw Schillingschen, rifle in\nhand, stalking among the shadows.  Nothing could convince them they had\nnot seen him.  They said he stooped like a man in a dream--that big\nbeard was matted, and his shirt torn--that he strode out of darkness\ninto darkness like a man whose mind was gone.  We purposely laughed at\ntheir story, to see if we could shake them in it.  But they laughed at\nour incredulity.\n\n\"My eyes are good eyes\" answered Kazimoto.  \"What I see I see!  Why\nshould I invent lies?\"\n\nIt was not pleasant to imagine Schillingschen, mind gone or not, with\nor without three cartridges and a rifle, prowling about our camp\nawaiting opportunity to do murder.\n\n\"Come to think of it,\" said Fred, \"we've no proof he hasn't a lot more\nthan three cartridges.  It's hardly likely, but he might have cached\nsome in reserve near where we found his camp pitched.  More unlikely\nthings have happened.  But the bally man must go to sleep some time.\nHe seems to have been awake ever since he escaped.  We'll be off at\ndawn, and either tire him out or leave him!\"\n\n\"I'll bet he's got one or more of those donkeys,\" I answered.  \"He'll\nnot be so easy to tire.\"\n\n\"Suppose you and Will go and sleep,\" suggested Fred.  \"Otherwise we'll\nall go crazy, and all get left behind!\"\n\nThere did not remain much time for sleeping.  The porters, being used\nto the tents and their loads now, got away to a good start, heading\nstraight toward the frowning pile of Elgon that hove its great hump\nagainst a blue sky and domineered over the world to the northward.\n\nThere were plenty of villages, well filled with timid spear-men and\nhard-working naked wives.  Now that we had trade goods in plenty there\nwas no difficulty at all about making friends with them.  They had two\nobsessing fears:  that it might not rain in proper season, and \"the\npeople\" as they called themselves would \"have too much hunger\"; and\nthat the men from the mountain might come and take their babies.\n\n\"Which men, from what mountain?\"\n\n\"Bad men, from very high up on that mountain!\"  They pointed toward\nElgon, shuddered, and looked away.\n\n\"Why should they take your babies?\"\n\n\"They eat them!\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"We know it!  They come!  Once in so often they come and fight with us,\nand take away, and kill and eat our fat babies!\"\n\nAll the inhabitants of all the villages agreed.  None of them had ever\nventured on the mountain; but all agreed that very bad black men came\nraiding from the upper slopes at uncertain intervals.  There was no\nvariation of the tale.\n\nOne thing puzzled us much more than the cannibal story.  We heard\nshooting a long way off behind us to our right--two shots, followed by\nthe unmistakable ringing echo among growing trees.  Had Schillingschen\ndecided to desert us?  And if so, how did he dare squander two of his\nthree cartridges at once--supposing he were not now mad, as our boys,\nand his, all vowed he was?  His own ten men began to beg to be\nprotected from him, and the captured Baganda recommended in best\nmissionary English that we seek the services of the first witch doctor\nwe could find.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\n\nTHE SONG OF THE ELEPHANTS\n\n  Who is as heavy as we, or as strong?\n        Ho! but we trample the shambas down!\n  Saw ye a swath where the trash lay long\n        And tall trees flat like a harvest mown?\n  That was the path we shore in haste\n        (Judge, is it easy to find, and wide!)\n  Ripping the branch and bough to waste\n        Like rocks shot loose from a mountain side!\n  Therefore hear us:\n\n(All together, stamping steadily In time.)\n\n        'Twas we who lonely echoes woke\n        To copy the crash of the trees we broke!\n        Goad, nor whip, nor wheel, nor yoke\n        Shall humble the will of the Ivory Folk!\n\n  Once we were monarchs from sky to sky,\n        Many were we and the men were few;\n  Then we would go to the Place to die--\n        Elephant tombs* that the oldest knew,--\n  Old as the trees when the prime is past,\n        Lords unchallenged of vale and plain,\n  Grazing aloof and alone at last\n        To lie where the oldest had always lain.\n  So we sing of it:\n\n-----------------------------\n* The legendary place that every Ivory hunter hopes some day to stumble\non, where elephants are said to have gone away to die of old age, and\nwhere there should therefore be almost unimaginable wealth of ivory.\nThe legend, itself as old as African speech, is probably due to the\nrarity of remains of elephants that have died a natural death.\n------------------------------\n\n(All together, swinging from side to side in time, and tossing trunks.)\n\n        'Twas we who lonely echoes woke\n        To copy the crash of the trees we broke!\n        Goad, nor whip, nor wheel, nor yoke\n        Shall govern the strength of the Ivory Folk!\n\n  Still we are monarchs! Our strength and weight\n        Can flatten the huts of the frightened men!\n  But the glory of smashing is lost of late,\n        We raid less eagerly now than then,\n  For pits are staked, and the traps are blind,\n        The guns be many, the men be more;\n  We fidget with pickets before and behind,\n        Who snoozed in the noonday heat of yore.\n  Yet, hear us sing:\n\n(All together, ears up and trunks extended.)\n\n        'Twas we who lonely echoes woke\n        To copy the crash of the trees we broke!\n        Goad, nor whip, nor wheel, nor yoke\n        Have lessened the rage of the Ivory Folk!\n\n  Still we are monarchs of field and stream!\n        None is as strong or as heavy as we!\n  We scent--we swerve--we come--we scream--\n        And the men are as mud 'neath tusk and knee!\n  But we go no more to the Place to die,\n        For the blacks head off and the guns pursue;\n  Bleaching our scattered rib-bones lie,\n        And men be many, and we be few.\n  Nevertheless:\n\n(All together, trunks up-thrown, ears extended, and stamping in slow\ntime with the fore-feet.)\n\n        'Twas we who lonely echoes woke\n        To copy the crash of the trees we broke!\n        Goad, nor whip, nor wheel, nor yoke\n        Shall humble the pride of the Ivory Folk!\n\n\nWe had laughed at Fred's suggestion that Schillingschen might have\nammunition cached away.  Fred had sneered at my guess that the German\nmight ride donkey-back and not be so easily left behind.  Now the\nprobability of both suggestions seemed to stiffen into reality.\n\nDay followed day, and Schillingschen, squandering cartridges not far\naway behind us, always had more of them.  He seemed, too, to lose\ninterest in keeping so extremely close to us, as we raced to get away\nfrom him toward the mountain.  If he was really crazy, as his trembling\nboys maintained, then for a crazy man blazing at everything or nothing\nhe was shooting remarkably little.  On the contrary, if he was sane,\nand shooting for the pot, he must have acquired a big following in some\nmysterious manner, or else have lost his marksmanship when Coutlass\nbruised his eyes.  He fired each day, judging by the echo of the shots,\nabout as many cartridges as we did, who had to feed a fairly long\ncolumn of men, and make presents of meat, in addition, to the chiefs of\nvillages.  It began to be a mystery how he carried so much ammunition,\nunless he had donkeys or porters.\n\nSoon we began to pass through a country where elephants bad been.\nThere was ruin a hundred yards wide, where a herd of more than a\nthousand of them must have swept in panic for fifteen miles.  There\nwere villages with roofs not yet re-thatched, whose inhabitants came\nand begged us to take vengeance on the monsters, showing us their\ntrampled enclosures, torn-down huts, and ruined plantations.  They\noffered to do whatever we told them in the way of taking part, and\nseveral times we marshaled the men of two or three villages together in\nan effort to get a line to windward and drive the herd our way.\n\nBut each time, as the plan approached development, ringing shots from\nbehind us put the brutes to flight.  It became uncanny--as if\nSchillingschen in his new mad mood was able to divine exactly when his\nnoise would work most harm.  Our fool boys told the local natives that\na madman was on our heels, and after that all offers of help ceased,\neven from those who had suffered most from the elephants.  We began to\nbe regarded as mad ourselves.  Efforts to get natives to go scouting to\nwatch Schillingschen, and report to us, were met with point-blank\nrefusal.  Rumor began to precede us, and from one village that had\nsuffered more than usually badly from passing elephants the inhabitants\nall fled at the first sign of Brown, leading our long single column.\n\nWe followed the herd.  Its track was wide, and easier than the winding\nnative foot-paths; and we were willing enough to jettison loads of\ntrade-goods if only we could replace them with tusks.  The chase led up\ntoward Elgon, over the shoulder of an outlying spur, and upward toward\nthe mountain's eastern slopes.\n\nAs long as we kept in the wake of the herd the going presented no\ndifficulties.  We knew by the state of the tracks and the dung that the\nherd was never far ahead.  Frequently we heard them crashing through\ntrees in front of us.  Yet whenever we came so close as to hope for a\nview, and a shot at a tusker, invariably a regular fusillade from the\neastward to our rear would start the herd stampeding with a din like\nall the avalanches.\n\nStreams by the dozen flowed down from the mountain's sides, their banks\ncrushed into bog where the elephants had crossed.  Our donkeys grew\nused to being tied by the head in line and hauled across (for in common\nwith all herds of donkeys, there were a few of them that swam readily,\nand many that either could not or refused).  The flies in the wake of\nthe elephants were worse than the tetse that haunted the shore of\nNyanza.\n\nWe had no trouble now from our boys.  We could even let the Baganda's\nhands loose.  They feared the cannibals of the higher slopes, but were\nmuch more afraid of the madman to our right rear.  Our difficulty lay\nin compelling them to keep a course sufficiently to eastward, and in\ncalling a halt each day before men and animals were too utterly tired\nout.  Yet for all their hurry, we did not gain on the man who made them\nso afraid.\n\nElephants, once thoroughly scared, will run away forever.  Our boys\nopenly praised the herd in front for its speed and stamina, hoping it\nwould continue on its course and oblige us to keep the madman with the\nrifle at a safe distance to our rear.  But it seemed he had an easier\nline than we, or else his frenzy gave him seven-league boots, for he\neven began to gain on us, keeping along our right flank at a distance\nof several miles, and driving us nearly mad in the frantic effort to\nkeep our column from turning and running away to the westward.  If we\nhad relaxed our vigilance for a moment they would have broken line and\nfled.\n\nIt was old volcanic country we were marching through, densely wooded,\nvirgin forest for the most part, with earth so warm at times that it\nwas not easy to believe the crater of Elgon quite extinct.  Even at\nthat low level we came on blow-holes nearly filled in with dirt and\ntrash, serving as fine caves for beasts of prey.  We went into one for\nabout three hundred paces before it narrowed into nothing, and would\nhave camped in it but for the stink.  It smelt like a place where the\negg of original sin had turned rotten.  Fred said that was sulphur,\nwith the air of a man who would like it believed that he knew.\n\nAt last the enemy must have made a night march, for he passed us, and\nthe following dawn we heard him shooting to our right in front.  That\nmorning it was simply impossible to make the boys break camp.  They\nswore that the ghost of Schillingschen had gone in league with the\nelephants to destroy us, and they preferred to be shot by us rather\nthan murdered by witchcraft.\n\nBeyond doubt they would have bolted and left us had that camp not been\nan almost perfect one, on rising ground with two great wings of rock\nalmost enclosing it, and a singing brook galloping through the midst.\nThere was only one gap by which elephant or man could enter (unless\nthey should fall from the sky), and they closed that by rolling rocks\nand dragging up trunks of trees.\n\nAfter a useless argument, during which we all lost our tempers and they\nwere reduced to the verge of panic, we decided to leave them there in\ncharge of Brown and those porters, except Kazimoto, who had rifles.\nThe armed men promised faithfully to die beside Brown in the only place\nof exit rather than permit a man to pass out; and the rest all agreed\nit would be right to shoot them if they attempted to desert; but we\nleft the camp together--Fred, Will, I, and Kazimoto, with Will's\npersonal servant and mine bringing up the rear--wondering whether we\nshould ever see any member or part of the outfit again.  It felt like\ngoing to a funeral--or rather from it--more than likely Brown's.\n\nKazimoto and the other two should have been carrying spare rifles; but\nBrown had refused to remain behind unless we left him all but the one\napiece we absolutely needed.  We took the boys more from habit than for\nany use they were likely to be; and my boy and Will's bolted back to\nthe camp almost before we were out of sight of it, Kazimoto begging us\nto shoot them in the back for cowards.\n\n\"Huh!\" he grunted.  \"They are afraid of death.  Teach them what death\nis!\"\n\nWe heard Brown challenge them as they approached the camp, and hoped he\nthrashed them soundly.  But it turned out he did not.  He himself had\ngrown afraid; for the fear of a crowd is contagious, and spreads\nnearly as readily from black to white as from white to black.  He broke\nopen a chop-box and consoled himself with whisky.\n\nForcing our way through vegetation that crowded around a spur of\nvolcanic rock, it soon became evident that the whole of the huge herd\nwas breakfasting not far in front of us, tearing off limbs of trees,\nand crashing about as if noise were the only object.  We climbed and\nattempted to look down on them, only to discover that the part of the\nforest where we were consisted of a narrow belt, with a mile-wide open\nspace beyond it between us and the elephants.  The wind was from them\ntoward us, but that did not wholly account for the amount of noise that\nreached us.  It was the fact that the herd was twice as big as we\nimagined.  There were elephants in every direction.  We could see and\nhear branches breaking with reports like cannon-fire.\n\nKazimoto was as steady as an old soldier, a great grin spreading across\nhis ugly honest face, and his eyes alight with enthusiasm.  This was\nthe profession he had followed when he was Courtney's gun-bearer, and\nhe kept close to Fred with a handful of cartridges ready to pass to\nhim, whispering wise counsel.\n\n\"Get close to them, bwana!  Go close!  Go close!  Wind coming our\nway--smell coming our way--noise coming our way--elephant very busy\neating--no hurry!  No long shooting!  Go right up close!\"\n\nIt was easier said than done.  The elephants had spread broadcast\nthrough the forest, and there was no longer one well-defined swath to\nfollow, but a very great number of twisting narrow alleys through\nelastic undergrowth between great unyielding trees.  We had to\nseparate, to gain any advantage from our number, so that we emerged\ninto the open more than a hundred yards apart, with Fred at the far\nleft and Will in the center.  Fred, with Kazimoto close at his heels,\nwas more than fifty yards in front of either of us.\n\nAnd crossing that mile of open land was no simple business.  It was a\nmass of rocks and tree-roots, burned over in some swift-running forest\nfire and not yet reseeded, nor yet rotted down.  There were winding\nways all across it by the dozen that the elephants, with their greater\nheight and better woodcraft, could follow on the run, but great stumps\nand rocks higher than a man's head (that from a distance had looked\nlike level land) blocked all vision and made progress mostly guesswork.\n\nHowever, the latter half-mile was more like level going--I emerged from\nbetween two boulders, wondering whether I could ever find my way back\nagain, and envied Fred, who had found a better track and had the lead\nof me now by several hundred yards.  Will was as far behind him as I,\nbut had gone over more to the left, leaving me--feeling remarkably\nlonely--away in the rear to the right.\n\nKazimoto followed Fred so closely, stooping low behind him, that the\ntwo looked like some strange four-legged beast.  They were headed for\nthe forest in front of them at a great pace, increasing their lead from\nWill, who, like me, was more or less winded.  I stooped at a pool to\nscoop up water and splash my face and neck.  When I looked up a moment\nlater I could see none of them.\n\nAt that instant, when I could actually smell the great brutes crashing\nin the forest, unseen within a hundred yards of me, and would have\ngiven all I had or hoped for just to have a friend within speaking\ndistance, a shot rang out in the forest ahead, and rattled from tree to\ntree like the echo of a skirmish.  It was not from Fred's gun, or\nWill's.  It was the phantom rifleman at work again.\nSchillingschen--Schillingschen's ghost--or whoever he was, he could not\nhave timed his fusillade better for our undoing.  The first shot was\nfollowed by six more in swift succession.  And then chaos broke loose.\n\nToward where I stood, from every angle to my front, the whole herd\nstampeded.  No human being could have guessed their number.  The forest\nawoke with a battle-din of falling trees and crashing undergrowth,\nsplit apart by the trumpeting of angry bulls and the screams of cows\nsummoning their young ones.  The earth shook under the weight of their\ntremendous rout.  I heard Fred's rifle ring out three times far to my\nleft--then Will's a rifle nearer to me; and at that the herd swung\ntoward its own left, and the whole lot of them came full-pelt, blind,\nscreaming, frantic, straight for me.\n\nThere was no turning them now. None but the very farthest on the flank\ncould have turned, given sense enough left to do it.  It was a flood of\nmaddened monsters, crazed with fear, pent by their own numbers, forced\nforward by the crowd behind, that invited me to dam them if I could!\nAs they burst into the open, more shots rang out in the forest to lend\ntheir fury wings!\n\nI glanced behind, to right and left, but there was no escape, I had\ncome too far into the open to retreat!  There were big rocks to the\nrear to have scrambled on, but there was no time.  There was one big\nrock in front of me that divided their course about in halves; to pass\nit they must open up, although they would almost surely close again.  I\ntook my stand in line with that, as a man on trial for life takes\nrefuge behind an unestablishable alibi.\n\nThey talk glibly about men's whole lives passing in review before them\nin the instant of a crisis.  That may be.  That was a crisis, and I saw\nelephants--elephants!  I remembered some of what Courtney had told\nus--some of the mad yarns Coutlass spun when liquor and the camp-fire\nmade him boastful.  All the advice I ever heard; all my previous\nimaginings of what I should do when such a time came, seemed to be\ncondensed into one concrete demand--shoot, shoot, shoot, and keep on\nshooting!  Yet my finger, bent around the trigger, absolutely would not\nact!\n\nThe oncoming gray wave of brutes split apart at the rock, as it must\ndo, some of them screaming as they crashed into it breast on and were\ncrushed by the crowd behind.  In the van of the right-hand wing,\nbrushing the rock with his shoulder, charged an enormous bull with\ntusks so large that the heavier had weighed down his head to a\npermanent rakish angle.  He caught sight of me--trumpeted like a siren\nin the Channel fog--and came at me with raised ears and trunk\noutstretched.  I heard shooting to the left, and more shots from the\nforest, where the very active ghost or madman was keeping up a battle\nof his own.  I felt the fear, that turns a man's very heart to ice,\ngrip hold of me--felt as if nothing mattered--imagined the whole\nuniverse a sea of charging elephants--accepted the inevitable--and\nsuddenly received my manhood back again!  My forefinger acted!  I fired\npoint-blank down the throat of the charging bull.  And it seemed to\nhave no more effect on him than a pea-shooter has on a railroad train!\n\nI had left Schillingschen's heavy-bored elephant gun behind with Brown,\nconsidering it too cumbersome, and was using a Mauser with flat-nosed\nbullets.  I fired four shots as fast as I could pump them from the\nmagazine straight down the monster's hot red throat; and he continued\nto come on as if I had not touched him, hard-pressed on either flank by\nbulls nearly as big as he.\n\nPerhaps the reason why my past history did not flash review was that my\ntime was not yet come!  I continued to see elephant--nothing but\nelephant!--little bloodshot eyes aflame with frenzy--great tusks\nupthrown--a trunk upraised to brain me--huge flat feet that raged to\ntread me down and knead me into purple mud!  I kept the last shot with\na coolness I believe was really numbness--then felt his hot breath like\na blast on my face, and let him have it, straight down the throat again!\n\nHe screamed--stopped--quivered right over me--toppled from the\nknees--and fell like a landslide, pushed forward as he tumbled by the\nweight behind, and held from rolling sidewise by the living tide on\neither flank.  I tried to spring back, but his falling trunk struck me\nto earth.  On either side of me a huge tusk drove into the ground, and\nI lay still between them, as safe as if in bed, while the herd crashed\npast to right and left for so many minutes that it seemed all the\nuniverse was elephants--bulls, cows and calves all trumpeting in mad\ndesire to get away--away--anywhere at all so be it was not where they\nthen were.\n\nBlood poured on me from the dead brute's throat--warm, slippery, sticky\nstuff; but I lay still.  I did not move when the crashing had all gone\nby, but lay looking up at the monster that had willed his worst and,\nseeking to slay, had saved me.  Those are the moments when young men\nsummon all their calf-philosophy.  I wondered what the difference was\nbetween that brute and me, that I should be justified in slaying; that\nI should be congratulated; that I should have been pitied, had the\ntouch-and-go reversed itself and he killed me.  I knew there was a\ndifference that had nothing to do with shape, or weight, or size, but I\ncould not give it a name or lay my finger on it.\n\nMy reverie, or reaction, or whatever it was, was broken by Fred's\nvoice, flustered and out of breath, coming nearer at a great pace.\n\n\"I tell you the poor chap's dead as a door-nail!  He's under that great\nbull, I tell you!  He's simply been charged and flattened out!  What a\ndog I was--what a green-horn--what a careless, fat-headed tomfool to\nleave him alone like that!  He was the least experienced of all of us,\nand we let him take the full brunt of a charging herd!  We ought to be\nhung, drawn and quartered!  I shall never forgive myself!  As for you,\nWill, it wasn't half as much your fault as mine!  You were following\nme.  You expected me to give the orders, and I ought to have called a\nhalt away back there until we were all three in touch!  I'll never\nforgive myself--never!\"\n\nI crawled out then from between the tusks, and shook myself, much more\ndazed than I expected, and full of an unaccountable desire to vomit.\n\n\"Damn your soul!\" Fred fairly yelled at me.  \"What the hell d'you mean\nby startling me in that way!  Why aren't you dead?  Look out!  What's\nthe matter with the man?  The poor chap's hurt--I knew he was!\"\n\nBut that inexplicable desire to empty all I had inside me out on to the\ntrampled ground could no longer be resisted, that was all.  The\naftermath of deadly fear is fear's corollary.  Each bears fruit after\nits kind.\n\nTo my one tusker Will and Fred had brought down five and six\nrespectively.  That made twenty-three tusks, for one was an enormous\n\"singleton.\"  We sent Kazimoto back alone to try to persuade some of\nour porters to come and chop out the ivory with axes, bidding him\npromise them all the hearts, and as many tail-hairs as they chose to\npull out to keep witches away with.  Then, since my sickness passed\npresently and left me steady on my legs, Fred made a proposal that we\njumped at.\n\n\"Let's go and lay Schillingschen's ghost!  If that was Schillingschen\nshooting in the forest, we've a little account with him!  If it wasn't\nI want to know it!  Come along!\"\n\nWe advanced into the forest and toiled up-hill along the tracks the\nstampeding elephants had made, amid flies indescribable, and almost\nintolerable heat.  The blood on my clothing made me a veritable\nfeeding-place of flies, until I threw most of it off, and then began to\nsuffer in addition from bites I could not feel before, and from the\nsharp points of beckoning undergrowth.  My bare legs began to bleed\nfrom scratches, and the flies swooped anew on those, and clung as if\nthey grew there.\n\nWill climbed a huge tree, at imminent risk of pythons and rotten\nbranches, and descried open country on our right front.  We made for\nit, I walking last to take advantage of the others' wake, and after\nmore than an hour of most prodigious effort we emerged on rolling rocky\ncountry under a ledge that overhung a thousand feet sheer above us on\nthe side of Elgon.  To our right was all green grass, sloping away from\nus.\n\nThere was a camp half a mile away pitched on the edge of the forest--a\nwhite man's tent--a mule--meat hanging to dry in the wind under a\nbranch--two tents for natives--and a pile of bags and boxes orderly\narranged.  We could see a man sitting under a big tent awning.  He was\nreading, or writing, or something of that kind.  He was certainly not\nSchillingschen.  We hurried.  Fred presently broke into a run; then,\nhalf-ashamed, checked himself and waited for me, who was beyond running.\n\nWhen we came quite close we saw that the man was playing chess all by\nhimself with a folding board open on his knees.  He did not look up,\nalthough by that time he surely should have heard us.  Fred began to\nwalk quietly, signaling to the camp hangers-on to say nothing.  We\nfollowed him silently in Indian file.  As he came near the awning Fred\ntip-toed, and I felt like giggling, or yelling--like doing anything\nridiculous.\n\nHe who played chess yawned suddenly, and closed the chess-board with a\nsnap.  He got up lazily, smiled, stretched himself like a great\ngood-looking cat, faced Fred, and laughed outright.\n\n\"Glad to see you all!  Did you get many elephants?\" he asked.\n\n\"Monty, you old pirate--I knew it was you!\" said Fred, holding a hand\nout.\n\nMonty took it, and forced him into the chair he had just vacated.\n\n\"You damned old liar!\" he said, nodding approvingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nTHEY TOIL NOT, NEITHER DO THEY SPIN\n\n  Now for opulence and place\n        And the increment unearned\n        We will thieve and stab and cover it with perjury,\n  Contemptuous of grace\n        And the lesson never learned\n        That the Rules are not amenable to surgery.\n  We will steal a neighbor's tools\n        In the quest for easy cash,\n        Aye, jump his claim and burrow to the heart of it,\n  But the innocents and fools\n        Get all the goods, and we the trash,\n        And that's the most exasperating part of it!\n\n\nNobody in camp slept that night.  When the tusks had been chopped out,\nand our camp carried across and pitched beside Monty's--ivory\nweighed--lion-proof boma built--and elephant-heart portioned out to the\nmen, who gorged themselves on it in order that their own hearts might\ngrow great and strong; when all the myriad matters had been seen to\nthat make camping in the tropics such a business, then there were tales\nto be told.  We demanded Monty's first; he ours; and because his was\nlikely to be much the shortest we won that argument.\n\n\"Wait one minute, though,\" he insisted.  \"Before I begin, have you any\nnotion who a man with a beard could be--bruised face-broken front\nteeth--Mauser rifle--big dark beard cut shovel-shape--enormously\npowerful by the look of his shoulders and arms?  I came on him three,\nno, four days' march back.\"\n\n\"Schillingschen!\" we exclaimed with one voice.\n\n\"Show me Schillingschen!\" echoed Brown, who was very drunk by that\ntime, nearly ready to be put to bed.  \"Show me Schillingschen, an' I'll\nshow you a corpse!\"\n\n\"He's right,\" nodded Monty.  \"The man's dead.  Blew his brains out with\nhis last cartridge.  Looked to me to have lost himself.  Slept in\ntrees, I should say.  Clothing all torn.  Hadn't been dead long when\nsome of my boys came on him and drove away the jackals.  Had he been in\na fight, do you know?\"\n\nBut we would not tell him that tale until we had his own.\n\n\"Mine's short and simple,\" he began.  \"Some ruffians boarded my ship at\nSuez, who made such eyes at me, and so obviously intended to do me\ndamage at the first opportunity, that I talked it over with the captain\n(giving him a hint or two of the possible reason) and he agreed to slip\nme off secretly at Ismailia.  It was easy--middle of the night, you\nknow--had the doctor isolate the ruffians on the starboard side while\nthe ship anchored--some cooked-up excuse about quarantine--and kept 'em\nout of sight of what was happening until the ship went on again.  Very\nsimple.\"\n\n\"Go on, Didums--we'll be all night talking--what did you do with the\nKing of Belgium?\" Fred demanded.\n\n\"Nothing.  Didn't go near the King of Belgium.  I was quarantined at\nIsmailia on wholly imaginary grounds for fourteen days; and who should\ncome smiling into the same lazaretto on the last day but Frederick\nCourtney--a very old friend of mine!\"\n\n\"He was to go to Somaliland,\" I said.\n\n\"So he told me.  He's on his way there now.  Decided for reasons of his\nown to enter the country by way of Abyssinia.  Told me of the advice\nhe'd given you fellows, and assured me he'd seen King Leopold himself\non the very matter scarcely a year before.  Of course, he said, I might\nsucceed where he failed, using influence and all that sort of thing,\nbut he assured me Leopold was hard to deal with, and difficult to tie\ndown.  His advice was, go back to Elgon, and hunt for the stuff there.\"\n\n\"That's what he kept advising us,\" said Will.  \"But why should he give\naway his information free?  And if it's good, where did he get it?\"\n\n\"Courtney's no dog in the manger,\" Monty answered.  \"He told me of this\nman Schillingschen.  Said he had sent in a report about him to the Home\nGovernment, but couldn't for the life of him get documentary evidence\nwith which to back up his charges.\"\n\nWill whistled, and drew out the diary he had rescued from the tin box.\nFred nodded.  Will threw it to Monty, who caught it.\n\n\"He told me this Schillingschen had searched the whole country over for\nthe stuff--had it straight from Schillingschen's boys--I dare say you\nknow how Courtney can make a native tell him all he knows.\nSchillingschen, he said, had eliminated pretty nearly all the likely\nplaces until Mount Elgon was about all there is left.  Courtney said,\ntoo, that there were always so many thousands of elephants near Elgon\nthat Tippoo Tib probably gathered a harvest there.  We discussed\nprobabilities, and agreed it wasn't likely he would carry the stuff far\nin order to hide it.  It seemed likely to both of us, too, that if the\nquantity the old man hid was anything like what rumor says, then there\nwere probably half a dozen hiding-places, not one.  Most of the stuff\nmay be in the Congo Free State, and we'll do well to leave that to\nLeopold of Belgium and his pet concessionaires.  Some of it may be near\nhere.  I stayed in the lazaretto an extra day with Courtney, talking it\nover.  One other thing he remembered to tell me was that Schillingschen\nhad hunted high and low for Tippoo Tib's old servants, and had finally\nmanaged to have the relatives of that man Hassan--I remember, Fred, you\ncalled him Johnson in Zanzibar--thrown in jail in German East for some\nalleged offense or other.\"\n\nMonty stopped to scrape out a faithful pipe, fill it, press down\ntobacco with a practised thumb, and reach toward the campfire for a\nburning brand.  Then he smoked for two minutes reflectively.\n\n\"I offered Courtney a share should we find the stuff.  Knew you fellows\nwould agree.\"  Pause.  \"Courtney wouldn't hear of it.\"  Pause.  \"Said\ngood-by to him, and took a coastwise trading steamer back to Mombasa.\nDelightful trip--put in everywhere--saw everything.  Saw a lot of the\nGalla--fine tribe, the Galla.\"\n\n\"Suppose you cut the travelogue stuff until later on!\" suggested Will.\n\n\"Landed at Mombasa, and learned the first day that you fellows had\nmanaged to make more enemies than friends.  Put in a number of days on\nheavy social labor--lingered at the club--drank too much of their\ninfernal gin-and-black-pepper appetizer--but made you fellows right, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"We're not interested in the slumming.  Go on and tell us what you\ndid!\" urged Fred.\n\n\"That is what I did--and undid.  I made friends.  Soon I had all the\nother junior officials in a state of mind to help me if they could.\nThen I began to inquire for Hassan.  They drew the dragnet tight, and\ndiscovered him at Nairobi!  A young assistant district superintendent\nof police, who will rise in the service, I hope, before long,\ndiscovered a woman--who was jealous of a man--who was just then making\nlove to the dusky damsel particularly favored by Hassan; and in that\nroundabout way we discovered that Hassan intended to take a trip very\nsoon toward Mount Elgon, where, if you please, he was to take part in\nProfessor Schillingschen's ethnological studies.  On condition that he\nheld his tongue until I gave him leave to talk, I promised that young\npoliceman--to put him en rapport with Schillingschen's doings as\nswiftly as may be.  Then I returned to Mombasa, and got your code\nletter saying you would head this way.  It all fitted in like a game of\nchess.\"\n\n\"How in the world did you get that letter so soon?\" demanded Fred.\n\"The missionary chap was to mail it in Ujiji, via Salisbury, Rhodesia.\"\n\n\"I suppose he simply didn't do that, that's all,\" Monty answered.  \"The\nbank manager told me he received it in the mission mail bag--from\nUjiji, yes, but by way of Muanza, Tabora, and Dar es Salaam. It reached\nme in the nick of time.  I must have been marching nearly parallel with\nyou chaps for about a week!\"\n\n\"If coincidence of evidence means anything,\" said Will \"we're all on a\nred-hot scent!  That Baganda we have in our outfit is our prisoner.\nOne of Schillingschen's pet pimps.  He swears Hassan--or rather some\nold native whose name he doesn't know--was to meet Schillingschen in\nthese parts and lead him to where he actually helped bury the ivory,\nyears ago!\"\n\n\"We may have difficulty finding him,\" said I.  \"Mount Elgon's big!\"\n\n\"What about Brown?\" asked Monty.  \"I hope you haven't made him partner?\nI agree, of course, if you have, but I hope not!\"\n\n\"Nothing doing!\"\n\n\"No.  Why should we?\"\n\n\"Brown's all right, but a present ought to satisfy him.\"\n\nWe began to tell Monty about Brown's cattle that Coutlass stole, and\nthe Masai looted from Coutlass and us.\n\n\"Were they branded?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Branded and hoof- and ear-marked,\" said I.\n\n\"Then they ought to be traceable, even among the huge herds the Masai\nhave.  I think I've influence enough by this time with this government\nto have those cattle traced and returned to Brown.\"\n\n\"They're his only love!\" said I.  \"Do that for him, and he'll never\nwait to receive a present!\"\n\nDawn found us still recounting our adventures and Monty alternately\nlaughing and frowning.\n\n\"I regret Coutlass\" he said, shaking the ashes from his pipe at last\nwhen Kazimoto brought our breakfast.  \"I regretted having to throw him\nout of the hotel in Zanzibar.  I wish he could have escaped with his\nlife--a picturesque scoundrel if ever there was one!  I'd rather be\nrobbed by him than flattered by ten Schillingschens or Lady Saffren\nWaldons.  I suppose if I'd been with you I'd have killed him.  It's\nwell I wasn't.  I might have regretted it all my days!\"\n\nWe buried our newly won ivory under a tree, locating the spot exactly\nwith the aid of Monty's compass, and broke camp, starting sleepless up\nthe mountain.  As Monty said:\n\n\"No use meandering around the mountain.  Hassan might be higher up or\nlower down.  If he is there you may depend on it he's tired of waiting.\nHe's looking for a safari.  Let's climb where we can be seen from\nmiles away.\"\n\nSo climb we did, thousand after thousand feet, until the night air grew\nso cold that the porters' teeth chattered and they threatened to desert\nus.  They grew afraid, too, remembering the tales the villagers had\ntold them down below.\n\n\"Wow!  You are not fat babies!\" Kazimoto told them.  \"Who would eat\nsuch stringy meat as you?\"\n\nWe came to caves that none of the men dared enter--vast, gloomy tunnels\ninto the mountain through which the chill wind whistled like a dirge.\nYet the caverns were warmer than the wind, and not bad camping-places\nif we could have persuaded the boys to take advantage of them.\n\nThe earth, too, all over the mountain and the range to eastward of it\nwas warm in spite of the wind.  In places there were warm springs\nbubbling from the rock, and at night and early morning a blanket of\nwhite mist that was remarkably like steam covered everything.  It was a\nland of thunderless lightning--lightning from a clear sky, flashing\nhere and there without warning or excuse.  On the high slopes there was\nlittle or no game, and no signs whatever of inhabitants, until late one\nafternoon the porters shouted, and we saw an old man racing toward us\nalong the top of a ridge.\n\nHe held his hands out, and shouted as he ran--a round-faced,\nbig-bellied man, although not nearly so fat as when we saw him last;\nunclean, unkempt, in tattered shirt and crushed-in fez--a man with one\ndesire expressed all over him--to see, and touch, and talk with other\nmen.  He ran and threw himself at Monty's feet, clasped his legs, and\nblubbered.\n\n\"Bwana! Oh, bwana! Oh, bwana!\"\n\n\"Get up, Johnson!\"  Fred took him by the arm and raised him.  \"Tell us\nwhat's the matter.\"\n\n\"Men who eat men!  Men who eat men!  I had three porters to carry my\ntent and food.  Now I have none.  They have eaten them!  Now they hunt\nme!\"\n\n\"Well, you're safe,\" said Monty. \"Calm yourself.\"\n\n\"But you are not Bwana Schillingschen!  I am here to wait for him.\nHave you seen him?  Where is he?\"\n\nFred answered him. \"Dead!\"\n\nHassan threw himself on the ground again at Monty's feet.\n\n\"Oh, what shall I do?\" he blubbered.  \"I am an old man.  Who shall take\nmy people out of jail?  Who shall go to Dar es Salaam and make Germans\ngive them up?\"\n\n\"If you're willing to show us what you intended to show\nSchillingschen,\" said Monty, \"I'll do what I can for your relations.\"\n\n\"What can you do?  Oh, what can you do?  No man but a German can make\nthese Germans cease from punishing!\"\n\nMonty beckoned to the Baganda who had once done Schillingschen's dirty\nwork.\n\n\"D'you see this man?  This is a German spy.  The German will be willing\nto hand over your relations in exchange for a promise not to make a\nfuss about this man.  Wait a minute, though!  Are your relations\ncriminals?\"\n\n\"No, bwana! No, bwana!  My relations honorable folk!  Formerly living\nin Zanzibar--going to Bagamoyo to serve in German family by invitation\nof person attached to German Consulate--no sooner landed than thrown in\njail on charges they know nothing whatever about.  Then Schillingschen\nhe finding me, and say to me, 'You show where is that Tippoo Tib's\nivory, and your relations shall go free!'  And Tippoo Tib, he say to\nme, 'You take first step to show any man where is that ivory, and you\nshall be fed to white ants by my faithful people!' And Schillingschen\nhe catch two of them faithful people, and feed 'em to white ants when\nnobody looking that way!  Schillingschen terrible!  Tippoo Tib\nterrible!  What shall do?  Tippoo Tib, he one time making me go long\ntrip with Bwana Coutlass, very bad Greek.  Bwana Coutlass wanting\nivory--me pretending showing him--leading him wrong way.  Coutlass very\nbad man, beating me ngumu sana.*  All the same, me more afraid of\nTippoo Tib and Bwana Schillingschen.  Not long ago Tippoo Tib sending\nme with Bwana Coutlass second time, making bad threats against me if I\nnot lead him wrong.  Then Schillingschen he send for me and making\nworse threats!  Oh, what shall do!  Oh, what shall do!\"  [* Ngumu sana,\nvery severely.]\n\n\"You shall show us where that ivory is!\" Monty answered him.  \"Stop\nblubbering!  Get up!  Look here!  See this!  (Get me that diary, Will.)\nIf the Germans won't release your relations from jail on account of\nthis Baganda, this is a written book that will make them do it!  In\nthis book are the names of men who have broken treaties and the law of\nnations.  When the Germans know the British Government in London has\nthis book under lock and key, they will think it a little thing to\nrelease your relations for the sake of avoiding trouble!\"\n\n\"Promise me, bwana!  You promise me!\"\n\n\"I promise I will do my best for you.\"\n\n\"Word of an Englishman--promise!\"\n\n\"Word Of an Englishman--I promise to do my best!\"\n\nThat was a proud enough moment on the shoulder of a mountain, with\nwilderness in every direction farther than the highest eagle in the air\nabove could see, to have that helpless, hopeless ex-slave, part Arab,\npart machenzie, put his whole stock-in-trade--his secret--all he had on\nearth to bargain with for those he loved--in the balance on the promise\nof an Englishman.  It was a tribute to a race that has had its share,\nno doubt, of bad men, but has won dominion over half the earth and\npretty much all the sea by keeping faith with men who could not by any\nmeans compel good faith.\n\n\"Then I tell!\" said Hassan.  \"Then I show!\"\n\nBut now a new fear seized him, and he clung to Monty, trembling and\njabbering.\n\n\"The men who eat men!  The men who eat men!\"\n\n\"Pah!  Cannibals!\" sneered Fred.  \"They're always cowards!\"\n\n\"Tippoo Tib, he afraid of nothing--nobody!  He is hiding the ivory\nwhere men who eat men can guard it and none dare come!\"\n\n\"Lead on, McDuff!\" Fred grinned, shouldering his rifle.\n\nAll of us except Monty had beards by that time that fluttered in the\nwind, and looked desperate enough for any venture.  Considering the\nrifles and our uncouth appearance, Hassan took heart of grace.  He\ninsisted on an armed guard to walk on either side of him, and nearly\ndrove Kazimoto frantic by ducking behind rocks at intervals, imagining\nhe saw an enemy; but he did not refuse any longer to show the way.\n\nIt seemed that in expectation of Schillingschen's early arrival he had\ncamped within a mile of the place where the stuff was hidden, taking\nunreasoning courage from the bare fact of having the redoubtable\nSchillingschen for friend.  But the cannibals (who must have been a\nhungry folk, for there were no plantations, and almost no animals on\nall those upper slopes) had pounced on his three lean porters, missing\nhimself by a hair's breadth.\n\nIn hiding, he had watched his three men killed, toasted before a fire\nin a cavern-mouth, and eaten.  Then he had run for his life, following\nthe shoulder of the mountain in the hope of meeting Schillingschen,\nmunching uncooked corn he had in a little bag, hiding and running at\nintervals for a day and a night until he chanced on us.  For an old man\nalmost sick with fear he was astonishingly little affected by the\nadventure.\n\nWe took longer over the course than he had done, because he wanted to\nfind cannibals, and teach them, maybe, a needed lesson.  Fred's theory\nwas that we should surprise them and pen them into a cavern,\ndiscovering some means of talking with them when hunger brought them\nout to surrender and cringe.\n\nSo we threw out a line of scouts, and pounced on cave-mouths suddenly,\nentering great tunnels and following the course of them in ages-old\nlava until sometimes we thought ourselves lost in the gloom and spent\nhours finding the way out again.\n\nTime and again we found bones--bones of wild animals, and of birds, and\nof fish; now and then bones that perhaps had been monkeys, but that\nlooked too suspiciously like those of the fat babies mothers mourned\nfor in the villages below for the benefit of the doubt to be conceded\nwithout something more or less resembling proof.  But never a human\nbeing did we see until we rounded the northeastern hump of the mountain\nin a bitter wind, and spied half a hundred naked men and women, thinner\nthan wraiths, who scampered off at sight of us and volleyed ridiculous\narrows from a cave-mouth.  The arrows fell about midway between us and\nthem, but threw Hassan into a paroxysm of fear, out of which it was\ndifficult to shake him.\n\n\"Those are the people who ate my men!  That is the cavern where Tippoo\nTib hid the ivory!  That is where my men's bones are!  See--they have\ntorn my tent for clothing for their naked women!\"\n\nWe put Hassan under double guard for fear lest he bolt again and leave\nus.  And all that day, and all the next we hunted for cannibals through\nmazy caverns that seemed to extend into the mountain's very womb.\nThere were times when the stench was so horrible we nearly fainted.  We\nstumbled on men's bones.  We collided with sharp projections in the\ngloom--fell down holes that might have been bottomless for aught we\nknew in advance--and scrambled over ledges that in places were smooth\nwith the wear of feet for ages.  Everlastingly to right, or left of us,\nor up above, or down below we could hear the inhabitants scampering\naway.  Now and then an arrow would flitter between us; but their\nsupply of ammunition seemed very scanty.\n\nAt night we camped in the cavern mouth to cut off all escape, and\nresumed the hunt at dawn.  But the caverns were hot--hotter by contrast\nwith the biting winds outside; and when in the afternoon of the second\nday we all came out to breathe and cool off the running sweat, we saw\nthe whole tribe--scarcely more than fifty of them--emerge from an\nopening above, whose existence we had not guessed, and go scampering\naway along a ledge like monkeys.  Some of them stopped to throw stones\nat us--impotent, aimless stones that fell half-way; and Fred sent\nthree bullets after them, chipping bits from the ledge, after which\nthey showed us a turn of speed that was simply incredible, and vanished.\n\n\"Now for the great disillusionment!\" laughed Will.  \"Hassan!  Go\nforward, and show us where that hoard of ivory ought ta be!\"\n\nWe all expected disillusionment.  Brown, who was under no delusion as\nto his share in the venture, scoffed openly at the idea of finding\nanything buried, in a land where every living \"crittur,\" as he put it,\nwas a thief from birth.  But Hassan led on in, fearless now that the\ncannibals were gone, and positive as if he led into his own house and\nwould show his house-hold treasures.\n\nHe stopped before a black-mouthed chasm, two or three hundred yards\nalong the smallest subdivision of the cavern, and called for lights and\na rope.  We lit lanterns, and he showed us men's bones lying everywhere\nin grisly confusion.\n\n\"Tippoo Tib his men!\" he remarked.  \"They throwing ivory in here, then\nbyumby men who eat men kill and eat them.  I alone living to tell!\nPlenty men who eat men in those days--all mountains full of them!\"\n\nHe tied a lantern to a rope and lowered it down what looked like an old\nvent-hole in the lava.  But the little light was lost in the enormous\nblackness, and we could see nothing.\n\n\"Send a man down!\" he counseled.\n\nWe leaned over the edge and sniffed.  There was a faint smell of what\nmight be sulphur, but not enough to hurt.\n\n\"Who'll go?\" asked Monty, and I thought he was going to volunteer\nhimself.\n\n\"I go down!\" announced Kazimoto cheerfully, and promptly proceeded to\ndivest himself of every stitch of clothing.\n\nWe made our stoutest line fast under his arm-pits, gave him a lantern\nand lowered him over the edge.  For fifty or sixty feet he descended\nsteadily, swinging the lantern and walking downward, held almost\nhorizontally by the slowly paid-out rope.  Then he stopped, and we\nheard him whistling.\n\n\"What do you see?\" we called down.\n\n\"Pembe!\" (Ivory.)\n\n\"Much of it?\"\n\n\"Teli!\"  (Too much!)  \"Oh, teli, teli! Teli, teli, teli, TELI!\"\n\nHis voice ended with the very high-pitched note that natives use when\nthey want to multiply superlatives.  Then he whistled again.  Next he\ncalled very excitedly.\n\n\"Very bad smell here, bwana!  Pull me out quickly!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nL'ENVOI\n\n  The dry death-rattle of the streets\n  Asserts a joyless goal--\n  Re-echoed clang where traffic meets,\n  And drab monotony repeats\n  The hour-encumbered role.\n  Tinsel and glare, twin tawdry shams\n  Outshine the evening star\n  Where puppet-show and printed lie,\n  Victim and trapper and trap, deny\n  Old truths that always are.\n  So fare ye, fare ye well, old roofs!\n  The syren warns the shore,\n  The flowing tide sings overside\n  Of far-off beaches where abide\n  The joys ye know no more!\n  The salt sea spray shall kiss our lips--\n  Kiss clean from the fumes that were,\n  And gulls shall herald waking days\n  With news of far-seen water-ways\n  All warm, and passing fair.\n  They've cast the shore-lines loose at last\n  And coiled the wet hemp down--\n  Cut picket-ropes of Kedar's tents,\n  Of time-clock task and square-foot rents!\n  Good luck to you, old town!\n  Oh, Africa is calling back\n  Alluringly and low\n  And few they be who hear the voice,\n  But they obey--Lot's wife's the choice,\n  And we must surely go!\n  So fare ye, fare ye well, old roofs!\n  The stars and clouds and trees\n  In place of you!  The heaped thorn fire--\n  Delight for the town's two-edged desire--\n  For thrice-breathed breath the breeze!\n  For rumble of wheels the lion's roar,\n  Glad green for trodden brown\n  For potted plant and measured lawn\n  The view of the velvet veld at dawn!\n  Good-by to you, old town!\n\n\nIf all is well that ends well, and only that is well, then this story\nfails at the finish, for we never caught the cannibals, so never taught\nthem the lesson in housekeeping and economics that they needed.  But\nthere is no other shortcoming to record.\n\nIt is no business of any one's what terms we made in the end with the\nProtectorate Government; but thanks to Monty's tact and influence, and\nto their sense of fair play, we were treated generously.  And if, when\nthe world war at last broke out and the Germans undertook to put in\npractise the treachery they had so long planned, there was a secret\nfund of hugely welcome money at the disposal of the out-numbered\ndefenders of British East, its source will no doubt be accounted for,\nas well as its expenditures, to the proper people, by the proper\npeople, at the proper time and place.\n\nBut those who are curious, and are adept at unraveling statistics might\nlearn more than a little by studying the export figures relating to\nivory during the years that preceded the war.  They say statistics\nnever lie; but those who write them now and then do, and it may be\nthat camouflage was understood and went by another name before the\ngreat war made the art notorious and popular.\n\nSome of the ivory in that huge hole was ruined by the heat that still\nlives in Elgon's womb.  Some of it was splintered by the fall when\nyoked slaves tossed it in.  Rats had gnawed some of it, to get at the\nsoft sweet core.\n\nBut the men who keep the keys of the bursting ivory vaults by London\ndocks could tell how much of it was good, and what huge stores of it\nreached them.  For some strange reason they are not a very talkative\nbreed of men.\n\nWe did not haul the ivory out ourselves.  That would have been too\npublic a proceeding.  But any one who attempted during the years that\nfollowed nineteen hundred to make a trip to Elgon can truthfully inform\nwhoever cares to know,  how jealously and wakefully the Protectorate\nGovernment guarded those lonely trails.  And there are folk who saw the\nhundred-man safaris that came down from that way every week or so,\ncarrying old ivory, said to be acquired in the way of trade.  But that\nis really all government business, and looks impertinent in print.\n\nWe did not make enough money to establish Monty in the homes of his\nancestors at Montdidier Towers and Kirkudbrightshire Castle; for that\nwould have been an unbelievable amount; it takes more than mere\naffluence to keep up an earldom in the proper style.  But we all got\nrich.\n\nBrown received his cattle back after a long wait, as well as a present\nof money that set him up handsomely for life.  And certain dissatisfied\nMasai were fined so many cows and sheep for raiding across the border\nthat they talked of migrating out of spite to German East--but did not\ndo it.\n\nA youthful red-headed assistant district superintendent of police was\nunaccountably alert enough to round up and bring into court more than a\ndozen natives who had preached sedition.  And, being lucky enough to\nsecure convictions in every case, he was promoted.  The last I heard of\nhim he was fighting in the very heart of German East in command of a\nwhole brigade.  So it is advantageous sometimes to do favors for stray\nnoblemen, provided you are clever enough, and man enough to make good\nwhen the favors are repaid.\n\nAnd while on the subject of favors, the four homesick islanders who had\nlent us their canoes and came with us all that journey, were sent back\nto their island followed by a launch towing two barges full of\ncorn--free, gratis, and for nothing--\"burre tu,\" as the natives say,\nmeaning that the English are certainly crazy and giving away food\nwithout a pull-back to it simply and solely because \"the people\" have\ntoo much nja.  Nja is the nastiest word in all those languages.  It\nmeans the one thing everybody dreads--the thing that only the English\nseem to know charms against--want--emptiness--HUNGER.\n\nAt our expense, but by the favor of the government, there went to that\nisland food enough in boxes and strong sacks--and seeds, treated\nagainst insects--and tools with which the wives could chop the soil up\n(for you can't expect the owner of a wife to work) to keep that island\nand its friendly folk from hunger for many a day.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ivory Trail, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IVORY TRAIL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5194.txt or 5194.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/9/5194/\n\nProduced by Jake Jaqua\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
