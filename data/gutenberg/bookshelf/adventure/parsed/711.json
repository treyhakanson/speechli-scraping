It is very hard having only one son to lose him\nthus, but God's will be done. Who am I that I should complain? The great\nwheel of Fate rolls on like a Juggernaut, and crushes us all in turn,\nsome soon, some late--it does not matter when, in the end, it crushes us\nall. We do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor Indians; we\nfly hither and thither--we cry for mercy; but it is of no use, the black\nFate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder.\n\n'Poor Harry to go so soon! just when his life was opening to him. He was\ndoing so well at the hospital, he had passed his last examination with\nhonours, and I was proud of them, much prouder than he was, I think. And\nthen he must needs go to that smallpox hospital. He wrote to me that he\nwas not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience; and now\nthe disease has killed him, and I, old and grey and withered, am left\nto mourn over him, without a chick or child to comfort me. I might have\nsaved him, too--I have money enough for both of us, and much more than\nenough--King Solomon's Mines provided me with that; but I said, \"No, let\nthe boy earn his living, let him labour that he may enjoy rest.\" But the\nrest has come to him before the labour. Oh, my boy, my boy!\n\n'I am like the man in the Bible who laid up much goods and builded\nbarns--goods for my boy and barns for him to store them in; and now his\nsoul has been required of him, and I am left desolate. I would that it\nhad been my soul and not my boy's!\n\n'We buried him this afternoon under the shadow of the grey and ancient\ntower of the church of this village where my house is. It was a dreary\nDecember afternoon, and the sky was heavy with snow, but not much was\nfalling. The coffin was put down by the grave, and a few big flakes lit\nupon it. They looked very white upon the black cloth! There was a little\nhitch about getting the coffin down into the grave--the necessary ropes\nhad been forgotten: so we drew back from it, and waited in silence\nwatching the big flakes fall gently one by one like heavenly\nbenedictions, and melt in tears on Harry's pall. But that was not all.\nA robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin and\nbegan to sing. And then I am afraid that I broke down, and so did Sir\nHenry Curtis, strong man though he is; and as for Captain Good, I saw\nhim turn away too; even in my own distress I could not help noticing\nit.'\n\n\nThe above, signed 'Allan Quatermain', is an extract from my diary\nwritten two years and more ago. I copy it down here because it seems to\nme that it is the fittest beginning to the history that I am about to\nwrite, if it please God to spare me to finish it. If not, well it does\nnot matter. That extract was penned seven thousand miles or so from the\nspot where I now lie painfully and slowly writing this, with a pretty\ngirl standing by my side fanning the flies from my august countenance.\nHarry is there and I am here, and yet somehow I cannot help feeling that\nI am not far off Harry.\n\nWhen I was in England I used to live in a very fine house--at least\nI call it a fine house, speaking comparatively, and judging from\nthe standard of the houses I have been accustomed to all my life in\nAfrica--not five hundred yards from the old church where Harry is\nasleep, and thither I went after the funeral and ate some food; for it\nis no good starving even if one has just buried all one's earthly\nhopes. But I could not eat much, and soon I took to walking, or rather\nlimping--being permanently lame from the bite of a lion--up and down,\nup and down the oak-panelled vestibule; for there is a vestibule in my\nhouse in England. On all the four walls of this vestibule were placed\npairs of horns--about a hundred pairs altogether, all of which I had\nshot myself. They are beautiful specimens, as I never keep any horns\nwhich are not in every way perfect, unless it may be now and again on\naccount of the associations connected with them. In the centre of the\nroom, however, over the wide fireplace, there was a clear space left on\nwhich I had fixed up all my rifles. Some of them I have had for forty\nyears, old muzzle-loaders that nobody would look at nowadays. One was an\nelephant gun with strips of rimpi, or green hide, lashed round the stock\nand locks, such as used to be owned by the Dutchmen--a 'roer' they call\nit. That gun, the Boer I bought it from many years ago told me, had been\nused by his father at the battle of the Blood River, just after Dingaan\nswept into Natal and slaughtered six hundred men, women, and children,\nso that the Boers named the place where they died 'Weenen', or the\n'Place of Weeping'; and so it is called to this day, and always will be\ncalled. And many an elephant have I shot with that old gun. She always\ntook a handful of black powder and a three-ounce ball, and kicked like\nthe very deuce.\n\nWell, up and down I walked, staring at the guns and the horns which\nthe guns had brought low; and as I did so there rose up in me a great\ncraving:--I would go away from this place where I lived idly and at\nease, back again to the wild land where I had spent my life, where I met\nmy dear wife and poor Harry was born, and so many things, good, bad, and\nindifferent, had happened to me. The thirst for the wilderness was on\nme; I could tolerate this place no more; I would go and die as I had\nlived, among the wild game and the savages. Yes, as I walked, I began to\nlong to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and\nmysterious sea of bush, and watch the lines of game travelling down the\nridges to the water. The ruling passion is strong in death, they say,\nand my heart was dead that night. But, independently of my trouble, no\nman who has for forty years lived the life I have, can with impunity go\ncoop himself in this prim English country, with its trim hedgerows\nand cultivated fields, its stiff formal manners, and its well-dressed\ncrowds. He begins to long--ah, how he longs!--for the keen breath of the\ndesert air; he dreams of the sight of Zulu impis breaking on their foes\nlike surf upon the rocks, and his heart rises up in rebellion against\nthe strict limits of the civilized life.\n\nAh! this civilization, what does it all come to? For forty years and\nmore I lived among savages, and studied them and their ways; and now for\nseveral years I have lived here in England, and have in my own stupid\nmanner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light; and what\nhave I found? A great gulf fixed? No, only a very little one, that a\nplain man's thought may spring across. I say that as the savage is, so\nis the white man, only the latter is more inventive, and possesses the\nfaculty of combination; save and except also that the savage, as I have\nknown him, is to a large extent free from the greed of money, which\neats like a cancer into the heart of the white man. It is a depressing\nconclusion, but in all essentials the savage and the child of\ncivilization are identical. I dare say that the highly civilized lady\nreading this will smile at an old fool of a hunter's simplicity when\nshe thinks of her black bead-bedecked sister; and so will the superfine\ncultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club, the cost of\nwhich would keep a starving family for a week. And yet, my dear young\nlady, what are those pretty things round your own neck?--they have a\nstrong family resemblance, especially when you wear that _very_ low\ndress, to the savage woman's beads. Your habit of turning round and\nround to the sound of horns and tom-toms, your fondness for pigments\nand powders, the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich\nwarrior who has captured you in marriage, and the quickness with which\nyour taste in feathered head-dresses varies--all these things suggest\ntouches of kinship; and you remember that in the fundamental principles\nof your nature you are quite identical. As for you, sir, who also laugh,\nlet some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying\nthat marvellous-looking dish, and we shall soon see how much of the\nsavage there is in _you_.\n\nThere, I might go on for ever, but what is the good? Civilization is\nonly savagery silver-gilt. A vainglory is it, and like a northern\nlight, comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark. Out of the soil\nof barbarism it has grown like a tree, and, as I believe, into the\nsoil like a tree it will once more, sooner or later, fall again, as the\nEgyptian civilization fell, as the Hellenic civilization fell, and as\nthe Roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost\ncount, fell also. Do not let me, however, be understood as decrying our\nmodern institutions, representing as they do the gathered experience\nof humanity applied for the good of all. Of course they have great\nadvantages--hospitals for instance; but then, remember, we breed\nthe sickly people who fill them. In a savage land they do not exist.\nBesides, the question will arise: How many of these blessings are due to\nChristianity as distinct from civilization? And so the balance sways and\nthe story runs--here a gain, there a loss, and Nature's great average\nstruck across the two, whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in\nthat mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity\nof her purpose.\n\nI make no apology for this digression, especially as this is an\nintroduction which all young people and those who never like to think\n(and it is a bad habit) will naturally skip. It seems to me very\ndesirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations\nof our nature, so that we may not be carried away by the pride of\nknowledge. Man's cleverness is almost indefinite, and stretches like an\nelastic band, but human nature is like an iron ring. You can go round\nand round it, you can polish it highly, you can even flatten it a little\non one side, whereby you will make it bulge out the other, but you will\n_never_, while the world endures and man is man, increase its total\ncircumference. It is the one fixed unchangeable thing--fixed as the\nstars, more enduring than the mountains, as unalterable as the way of\nthe Eternal. Human nature is God's kaleidoscope, and the little bits\nof coloured glass which represent our passions, hopes, fears, joys,\naspirations towards good and evil and what not, are turned in His mighty\nhand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars, and continually\nfall into new patterns and combinations. But the composing elements\nremain the same, nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor\none less for ever and ever.\n\nThis being so, supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves\ninto twenty parts, nineteen savage and one civilized, we must look\nto the nineteen savage portions of our nature, if we would really\nunderstand ourselves, and not to the twentieth, which, though so\ninsignificant in reality, is spread all over the other nineteen, making\nthem appear quite different from what they really are, as the blacking\ndoes a boot, or the veneer a table. It is on the nineteen rough\nserviceable savage portions that we fall back on emergencies, not on the\npolished but unsubstantial twentieth. Civilization should wipe away our\ntears, and yet we weep and cannot be comforted. Warfare is abhorrent\nto her, and yet we strike out for hearth and home, for honour and fair\nfame, and can glory in the blow. And so on, through everything.\n\nSo, when the heart is stricken, and the head is humbled in the dust,\ncivilization fails us utterly. Back, back, we creep, and lay us like\nlittle children on the great breast of Nature, she that perchance may\nsoothe us and make us forget, or at least rid remembrance of its sting.\nWho has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward\nfeatures of the universal Mother; to lie on the mountains and watch the\nclouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the\nshore, to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life;\nto feel the slow beat of her eternal heart, and to forget his woes, and\nlet his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of\nher of whom we are, from whom we came, and with whom we shall again be\nmingled, who gave us birth, and will in a day to come give us our burial\nalso.\n\nAnd so in my trouble, as I walked up and down the oak-panelled vestibule\nof my house there in Yorkshire, I longed once more to throw myself into\nthe arms of Nature. Not the Nature which you know, the Nature that waves\nin well-kept woods and smiles out in corn-fields, but Nature as she was\nin the age when creation was complete, undefiled as yet by any human\nsinks of sweltering humanity. I would go again where the wild game was,\nback to the land whereof none know the history, back to the savages,\nwhom I love, although some of them are almost as merciless as Political\nEconomy. There, perhaps, I should be able to learn to think of poor\nHarry lying in the churchyard, without feeling as though my heart would\nbreak in two.\n\nAnd now there is an end of this egotistical talk, and there shall be\nno more of it. But if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my\nwritten thoughts have got so far as this, I ask you to persevere, since\nwhat I have to tell you is not without its interest, and it has never\nbeen told before, nor will again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I THE CONSUL'S YARN\n\n\nA week had passed since the funeral of my poor boy Harry, and one\nevening I was in my room walking up and down and thinking, when there\nwas a ring at the outer door. Going down the steps I opened it myself,\nand in came my old friends Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good,\nRN. They entered the vestibule and sat themselves down before the wide\nhearth, where, I remember, a particularly good fire of logs was burning.\n\n'It is very kind of you to come round,' I said by way of making a\nremark; 'it must have been heavy walking in the snow.'\n\nThey said nothing, but Sir Henry slowly filled his pipe and lit it with\na burning ember. As he leant forward to do so the fire got hold of a\ngassy bit of pine and flared up brightly, throwing the whole scene into\nstrong relief, and I thought, What a splendid-looking man he is! Calm,\npowerful face, clear-cut features, large grey eyes, yellow beard and\nhair--altogether a magnificent specimen of the higher type of humanity.\nNor did his form belie his face. I have never seen wider shoulders or a\ndeeper chest. Indeed, Sir Henry's girth is so great that, though he is\nsix feet two high, he does not strike one as a tall man. As I looked at\nhim I could not help thinking what a curious contrast my little dried-up\nself presented to his grand face and form. Imagine to yourself a small,\nwithered, yellow-faced man of sixty-three, with thin hands, large brown\neyes, a head of grizzled hair cut short and standing up like a half-worn\nscrubbing-brush--total weight in my clothes, nine stone six--and you\nwill get a very fair idea of Allan Quatermain, commonly called Hunter\nQuatermain, or by the natives 'Macumazahn'--Anglic\u00e8, he who keeps a\nbright look-out at night, or, in vulgar English, a sharp fellow who is\nnot to be taken in.\n\nThen there was Good, who is not like either of us, being short, dark,\nstout--_very_ stout--with twinkling black eyes, in one of which an\neyeglass is everlastingly fixed. I say stout, but it is a mild term;\nI regret to state that of late years Good has been running to fat in a\nmost disgraceful way. Sir Henry tells him that it comes from idleness\nand over-feeding, and Good does not like it at all, though he cannot\ndeny it.\n\nWe sat for a while, and then I got a match and lit the lamp that stood\nready on the table, for the half-light began to grow dreary, as it is\napt to do when one has a short week ago buried the hope of one's life.\nNext, I opened a cupboard in the wainscoting and got a bottle of whisky\nand some tumblers and water. I always like to do these things for\nmyself: it is irritating to me to have somebody continually at my elbow,\nas though I were an eighteen-month-old baby. All this while Curtis and\nGood had been silent, feeling, I suppose, that they had nothing to say\nthat could do me any good, and content to give me the comfort of their\npresence and unspoken sympathy; for it was only their second visit since\nthe funeral. And it is, by the way, from the _presence_ of others that\nwe really derive support in our dark hours of grief, and not from their\ntalk, which often only serves to irritate us. Before a bad storm the\ngame always herd together, but they cease their calling.\n\nThey sat and smoked and drank whisky and water, and I stood by the fire\nalso smoking and looking at them.\n\nAt last I spoke. 'Old friends,' I said, 'how long is it since we got\nback from Kukuanaland?'\n\n'Three years,' said Good. 'Why do you ask?'\n\n'I ask because I think that I have had a long enough spell of\ncivilization. I am going back to the veldt.'\n\nSir Henry laid his head back in his arm-chair and laughed one of his\ndeep laughs. 'How very odd,' he said, 'eh, Good?'\n\nGood beamed at me mysteriously through his eyeglass and murmured, 'Yes,\nodd--very odd.'\n\n'I don't quite understand,' said I, looking from one to the other, for I\ndislike mysteries.\n\n'Don't you, old fellow?' said Sir Henry; 'then I will explain. As Good\nand I were walking up here we had a talk.'\n\n'If Good was there you probably did,' I put in sarcastically, for Good\nis a great hand at talking. 'And what may it have been about?'\n\n'What do you think?' asked Sir Henry.\n\nI shook my head. It was not likely that I should know what Good might be\ntalking about. He talks about so many things.\n\n'Well, it was about a little plan that I have formed--namely, that if\nyou were willing we should pack up our traps and go off to Africa on\nanother expedition.'\n\nI fairly jumped at his words. 'You don't say so!' I said.\n\n'Yes I do, though, and so does Good; don't you, Good?'\n\n'Rather,' said that gentleman.\n\n'Listen, old fellow,' went on Sir Henry, with considerable animation of\nmanner. 'I'm tired of it too, dead-tired of doing nothing more except\nplay the squire in a country that is sick of squires. For a year or more\nI have been getting as restless as an old elephant who scents danger. I\nam always dreaming of Kukuanaland and Gagool and King Solomon's Mines.\nI can assure you I have become the victim of an almost unaccountable\ncraving. I am sick of shooting pheasants and partridges, and want to\nhave a go at some large game again. There, you know the feeling--when\none has once tasted brandy and water, milk becomes insipid to the\npalate. That year we spent together up in Kukuanaland seems to me worth\nall the other years of my life put together. I dare say that I am a fool\nfor my pains, but I can't help it; I long to go, and, what is more, I\nmean to go.' He paused, and then went on again. 'And, after all, why\nshould I not go? I have no wife or parent, no chick or child to keep me.\nIf anything happens to me the baronetcy will go to my brother George and\nhis boy, as it would ultimately do in any case. I am of no importance to\nany one.'\n\n'Ah!' I said, 'I thought you would come to that sooner or later. And\nnow, Good, what is your reason for wanting to trek; have you got one?'\n\n'I have,' said Good, solemnly. 'I never do anything without a reason;\nand it isn't a lady--at least, if it is, it's several.'\n\nI looked at him again. Good is so overpoweringly frivolous. 'What is\nit?' I said.\n\n'Well, if you really want to know, though I'd rather not speak of a\ndelicate and strictly personal matter, I'll tell you: I'm getting too\nfat.'\n\n'Shut up, Good!' said Sir Henry. 'And now, Quatermain, tell us, where do\nyou propose going to?'\n\nI lit my pipe, which had gone out, before answering.\n\n'Have you people ever heard of Mt Kenia?' I asked.\n\n'Don't know the place,' said Good.\n\n'Did you ever hear of the Island of Lamu?' I asked again.\n\n'No. Stop, though--isn't it a place about 300 miles north of Zanzibar?'\n\n'Yes. Now listen. What I have to propose is this. That we go to Lamu and\nthence make our way about 250 miles inland to Mt Kenia; from Mt Kenia on\ninland to Mt Lekakisera, another 200 miles, or thereabouts, beyond which\nno white man has to the best of my belief ever been; and then, if we get\nso far, right on into the unknown interior. What do you say to that, my\nhearties?'\n\n'It's a big order,' said Sir Henry, reflectively.\n\n'You are right,' I answered, 'it is; but I take it that we are all three\nof us in search of a big order. We want a change of scene, and we are\nlikely to get one--a thorough change. All my life I have longed to visit\nthose parts, and I mean to do it before I die. My poor boy's death has\nbroken the last link between me and civilization, and I'm off to my\nnative wilds. And now I'll tell you another thing, and that is, that\nfor years and years I have heard rumours of a great white race which is\nsupposed to have its home somewhere up in this direction, and I have a\nmind to see if there is any truth in them. If you fellows like to come,\nwell and good; if not, I'll go alone.'\n\n'I'm your man, though I don't believe in your white race,' said Sir\nHenry Curtis, rising and placing his arm upon my shoulder.\n\n'Ditto,' remarked Good. 'I'll go into training at once. By all means\nlet's go to Mt Kenia and the other place with an unpronounceable name,\nand look for a white race that does not exist. It's all one to me.'\n\n'When do you propose to start?' asked Sir Henry.\n\n'This day month,' I answered, 'by the British India steamboat; and\ndon't you be so certain that things have no existence because you do not\nhappen to have heard of them. Remember King Solomon's mines!'\n\n\nSome fourteen weeks or so had passed since the date of this\nconversation, and this history goes on its way in very different\nsurroundings.\n\nAfter much deliberation and inquiry we came to the conclusion that our\nbest starting-point for Mt Kenia would be from the neighbourhood of the\nmouth of the Tana River, and not from Mombassa, a place over 100 miles\nnearer Zanzibar. This conclusion we arrived at from information given to\nus by a German trader whom we met upon the steamer at Aden. I think that\nhe was the dirtiest German I ever knew; but he was a good fellow, and\ngave us a great deal of valuable information. 'Lamu,' said he, 'you\ngoes to Lamu--oh ze beautiful place!' and he turned up his fat face and\nbeamed with mild rapture. 'One year and a half I live there and never\nchange my shirt--never at all.'\n\nAnd so it came to pass that on arriving at the island we disembarked\nwith all our goods and chattels, and, not knowing where to go, marched\nboldly up to the house of Her Majesty's Consul, where we were most\nhospitably received.\n\nLamu is a very curious place, but the things which stand out most\nclearly in my memory in connection with it are its exceeding dirtiness\nand its smells. These last are simply awful. Just below the Consulate is\nthe beach, or rather a mud bank that is called a beach. It is left quite\nbare at low tide, and serves as a repository for all the filth, offal,\nand refuse of the town. Here it is, too, that the women come to bury\ncoconuts in the mud, leaving them there till the outer husk is quite\nrotten, when they dig them up again and use the fibres to make mats\nwith, and for various other purposes. As this process has been going on\nfor generations, the condition of the shore can be better imagined than\ndescribed. I have smelt many evil odours in the course of my life, but\nthe concentrated essence of stench which arose from that beach at Lamu\nas we sat in the moonlit night--not under, but _on_ our friend the\nConsul's hospitable roof--and sniffed it, makes the remembrance of them\nvery poor and faint. No wonder people get fever at Lamu. And yet the\nplace was not without a certain quaintness and charm of its own, though\npossibly--indeed probably--it was one which would quickly pall.\n\n'Well, where are you gentlemen steering for?' asked our friend the\nhospitable Consul, as we smoked our pipes after dinner.\n\n'We propose to go to Mt Kenia and then on to Mt Lekakisera,' answered\nSir Henry. 'Quatermain has got hold of some yarn about there being a\nwhite race up in the unknown territories beyond.'\n\nThe Consul looked interested, and answered that he had heard something\nof that, too.\n\n'What have you heard?' I asked.\n\n'Oh, not much. All I know about it is that a year or so ago I got\na letter from Mackenzie, the Scotch missionary, whose station, \"The\nHighlands\", is placed at the highest navigable point of the Tana River,\nin which he said something about it.'\n\n'Have you the letter?' I asked.\n\n'No, I destroyed it; but I remember that he said that a man had\narrived at his station who declared that two months' journey beyond Mt\nLekakisera, which no white man has yet visited--at least, so far as\nI know--he found a lake called Laga, and that then he went off to the\nnorth-east, a month's journey, over desert and thorn veldt and great\nmountains, till he came to a country where the people are white and live\nin stone houses. Here he was hospitably entertained for a while, till\nat last the priests of the country set it about that he was a devil, and\nthe people drove him away, and he journeyed for eight months and reached\nMackenzie's place, as I heard, dying. That's all I know; and if you ask\nme, I believe that it is a lie; but if you want to find out more about\nit, you had better go up the Tana to Mackenzie's place and ask him for\ninformation.'\n\nSir Henry and I looked at each other. Here was something tangible.\n\n'I think that we will go to Mr Mackenzie's,' I said.\n\n'Well,' answered the Consul, 'that is your best way, but I warn you that\nyou are likely to have a rough journey, for I hear that the Masai are\nabout, and, as you know, they are not pleasant customers. Your best plan\nwill be to choose a few picked men for personal servants and hunters,\nand to hire bearers from village to village. It will give you an\ninfinity of trouble, but perhaps on the whole it will prove a cheaper\nand more advantageous course than engaging a caravan, and you will be\nless liable to desertion.'\n\nFortunately there were at Lamu at this time a party of Wakwafi Askari\n(soldiers). The Wakwafi, who are a cross between the Masai and the\nWataveta, are a fine manly race, possessing many of the good qualities\nof the Zulu, and a great capacity for civilization. They are also great\nhunters. As it happened, these particular men had recently been on a\nlong trip with an Englishman named Jutson, who had started from\nMombasa, a port about 150 miles below Lamu, and journeyed right round\nKilimanjaro, one of the highest known mountains in Africa. Poor fellow,\nhe had died of fever when on his return journey, and within a day's\nmarch of Mombasa. It does seem hard that he should have gone off thus\nwhen within a few hours of safety, and after having survived so many\nperils, but so it was. His hunters buried him, and then came on to Lamu\nin a dhow. Our friend the Consul suggested to us that we had better try\nand hire these men, and accordingly on the following morning we started\nto interview the party, accompanied by an interpreter.\n\nIn due course we found them in a mud hut on the outskirts of the town.\nThree of the men were sitting outside the hut, and fine frank-looking\nfellows they were, having a more or less civilized appearance. To them\nwe cautiously opened the object of our visit, at first with very scant\nsuccess. They declared that they could not entertain any such idea, that\nthey were worn and weary with long travelling, and that their hearts\nwere sore at the loss of their master. They meant to go back to their\nhomes and rest awhile. This did not sound very promising, so by way of\neffecting a diversion I asked where the remainder of them were. I was\ntold there were six, and I saw but three. One of the men said they slept\nin the hut, and were yet resting after their labours--'sleep weighed\ndown their eyelids, and sorrow made their hearts as lead: it was best\nto sleep, for with sleep came forgetfulness. But the men should be\nawakened.'\n\nPresently they came out of the hut, yawning--the first two men being\nevidently of the same race and style as those already before us; but the\nappearance of the third and last nearly made me jump out of my skin.\nHe was a very tall, broad man, quite six foot three, I should say, but\ngaunt, with lean, wiry-looking limbs. My first glance at him told me\nthat he was no Wakwafi: he was a pure bred Zulu. He came out with his\nthin aristocratic-looking hand placed before his face to hide a yawn, so\nI could only see that he was a 'Keshla' or ringed man {Endnote 1}, and\nthat he had a great three-cornered hole in his forehead. In another\nsecond he removed his hand, revealing a powerful-looking Zulu face, with\na humorous mouth, a short woolly beard, tinged with grey, and a pair of\nbrown eyes keen as a hawk's. I knew my man at once, although I had not\nseen him for twelve years. 'How do you do, Umslopogaas?' I said quietly\nin Zulu.\n\nThe tall man (who among his own people was commonly known as the\n'Woodpecker', and also as the 'Slaughterer') started, and almost let\nthe long-handled battleaxe he held in his hand fall in his astonishment.\nNext second he had recognized me, and was saluting me in an outburst of\nsonorous language which made his companions the Wakwafi stare.\n\n'Koos' (chief), he began, 'Koos-y-Pagete! Koos-y-umcool! (Chief from of\nold--mighty chief) Koos! Baba! (father) Macumazahn, old hunter, slayer\nof elephants, eater up of lions, clever one! watchful one! brave one!\nquick one! whose shot never misses, who strikes straight home, who\ngrasps a hand and holds it to the death (i.e. is a true friend) Koos!\nBaba! Wise is the voice of our people that says, \"Mountain never meets\nwith mountain, but at daybreak or at even man shall meet again with\nman.\" Behold! a messenger came up from Natal, \"Macumazahn is dead!\"\ncried he. \"The land knows Macumazahn no more.\" That is years ago. And\nnow, behold, now in this strange place of stinks I find Macumazahn, my\nfriend. There is no room for doubt. The brush of the old jackal has\ngone a little grey; but is not his eye as keen, and are not his teeth as\nsharp? Ha! ha! Macumazahn, mindest thou how thou didst plant the ball in\nthe eye of the charging buffalo--mindest thou--'\n\nI had let him run on thus because I saw that his enthusiasm was\nproducing a marked effect upon the minds of the five Wakwafi, who\nappeared to understand something of his talk; but now I thought it time\nto put a stop to it, for there is nothing that I hate so much as this\nZulu system of extravagant praising--'bongering' as they call it.\n'Silence!' I said. 'Has all thy noisy talk been stopped up since last\nI saw thee that it breaks out thus, and sweeps us away? What doest thou\nhere with these men--thou whom I left a chief in Zululand? How is it\nthat thou art far from thine own place, and gathered together with\nstrangers?'\n\nUmslopogaas leant himself upon the head of his long battleaxe (which\nwas nothing else but a pole-axe, with a beautiful handle of rhinoceros\nhorn), and his grim face grew sad.\n\n'My Father,' he answered, 'I have a word to tell thee, but I cannot\nspeak it before these low people (umfagozana),' and he glanced at the\nWakwafi Askari; 'it is for thine own ear. My Father, this will I say,'\nand here his face grew stern again, 'a woman betrayed me to the death,\nand covered my name with shame--ay, my own wife, a round-faced girl,\nbetrayed me; but I escaped from death; ay, I broke from the very hands\nof those who came to slay me. I struck but three blows with this mine\naxe Inkosikaas--surely my Father will remember it--one to the right, one\nto the left, and one in front, and yet I left three men dead. And then I\nfled, and, as my Father knows, even now that I am old my feet are as the\nfeet of the Sassaby {Endnote 2}, and there breathes not the man who, by\nrunning, can touch me again when once I have bounded from his side. On I\nsped, and after me came the messengers of death, and their voice was as\nthe voice of dogs that hunt. From my own kraal I flew, and, as I passed,\nshe who had betrayed me was drawing water from the spring. I fleeted by\nher like the shadow of Death, and as I went I smote with mine axe, and\nlo! her head fell: it fell into the water pan. Then I fled north. Day\nafter day I journeyed on; for three moons I journeyed, resting not,\nstopping not, but running on towards forgetfulness, till I met the\nparty of the white hunter who is now dead, and am come hither with his\nservants. And nought have I brought with me. I who was high-born, ay,\nof the blood of Chaka, the great king--a chief, and a captain of the\nregiment of the Nkomabakosi--am a wanderer in strange places, a man\nwithout a kraal. Nought have I brought save this mine axe; of all my\nbelongings this remains alone. They have divided my cattle; they have\ntaken my wives; and my children know my face no more. Yet with this\naxe'--and he swung the formidable weapon round his head, making the\nair hiss as he clove it--'will I cut another path to fortune. I have\nspoken.'\n\nI shook my head at him. 'Umslopogaas,' I said, 'I know thee from of\nold. Ever ambitious, ever plotting to be great, I fear me that thou hast\noverreached thyself at last. Years ago, when thou wouldst have plotted\nagainst Cetywayo, son of Panda, I warned thee, and thou didst listen.\nBut now, when I was not by thee to stay thy hand, thou hast dug a pit\nfor thine own feet to fall in. Is it not so? But what is done is done.\nWho can make the dead tree green, or gaze again upon last year's light?\nWho can recall the spoken word, or bring back the spirit of the fallen?\nThat which Time swallows comes not up again. Let it be forgotten!\n\n'And now, behold, Umslopogaas, I know thee for a great warrior and a\nbrave man, faithful to the death. Even in Zululand, where all the men\nare brave, they called thee the \"Slaughterer\", and at night told stories\nround the fire of thy strength and deeds. Hear me now. Thou seest this\ngreat man, my friend'--and I pointed to Sir Henry; 'he also is a warrior\nas great as thou, and, strong as thou art, he could throw thee over his\nshoulder. Incubu is his name. And thou seest this one also; him with the\nround stomach, the shining eye, and the pleasant face. Bougwan (glass\neye) is his name, and a good man is he and a true, being of a curious\ntribe who pass their life upon the water, and live in floating kraals.\n\n'Now, we three whom thou seest would travel inland, past Dongo Egere,\nthe great white mountain (Mt Kenia), and far into the unknown beyond.\nWe know not what we shall find there; we go to hunt and seek adventures,\nand new places, being tired of sitting still, with the same old things\naround us. Wilt thou come with us? To thee shall be given command of all\nour servants; but what shall befall thee, that I know not. Once before\nwe three journeyed thus, in search of adventure, and we took with us\na man such as thou--one Umbopa; and, behold, we left him the king of\na great country, with twenty Impis (regiments), each of 3,000 plumed\nwarriors, waiting on his word. How it shall go with thee, I know not;\nmayhap death awaits thee and us. Wilt thou throw thyself to Fortune and\ncome, or fearest thou, Umslopogaas?'\n\nThe great man smiled. 'Thou art not altogether right, Macumazahn,' he\nsaid; 'I have plotted in my time, but it was not ambition that led me to\nmy fall; but, shame on me that I should have to say it, a fair woman's\nface. Let it pass. So we are going to see something like the old times\nagain, Macumazahn, when we fought and hunted in Zululand? Ay, I will\ncome. Come life, come death, what care I, so that the blows fall fast\nand the blood runs red? I grow old, I grow old, and I have not fought\nenough! And yet am I a warrior among warriors; see my scars'--and he\npointed to countless cicatrices, stabs and cuts, that marked the skin of\nhis chest and legs and arms. 'See the hole in my head; the brains gushed\nout therefrom, yet did I slay him who smote, and live. Knowest thou how\nmany men I have slain, in fair hand-to-hand combat, Macumazahn? See,\nhere is the tale of them'--and he pointed to long rows of notches cut\nin the rhinoceros-horn handle of his axe. 'Number them, Macumazahn--one\nhundred and three--and I have never counted but those whom I have\nripped open {Endnote 3}, nor have I reckoned those whom another man had\nstruck.'\n\n'Be silent,' I said, for I saw that he was getting the blood-fever on\nhim; 'be silent; well art thou called the \"Slaughterer\". We would not\nhear of thy deeds of blood. Remember, if thou comest with us, we fight\nnot save in self-defence. Listen, we need servants. These men,' and I\npointed to the Wakwafi, who had retired a little way during our 'indaba'\n(talk), 'say they will not come.'\n\n'Will not come!' shouted Umslopogaas; 'where is the dog who says he will\nnot come when my Father orders? Here, thou'--and with a single bound he\nsprang upon the Wakwafi with whom I had first spoken, and, seizing him\nby the arm, dragged him towards us. 'Thou dog!' he said, giving the\nterrified man a shake, 'didst thou say that thou wouldst not go with my\nFather? Say it once more and I will choke thee'--and his long fingers\nclosed round his throat as he said it--'thee, and those with thee. Hast\nthou forgotten how I served thy brother?'\n\n'Nay, we will come with the white man,' gasped the man.\n\n'White man!' went on Umslopogaas, in simulated fury, which a very\nlittle provocation would have made real enough; 'of whom speakest thou,\ninsolent dog?'\n\n'Nay, we will go with the great chief.'\n\n'So!' said Umslopogaas, in a quiet voice, as he suddenly released his\nhold, so that the man fell backward. 'I thought you would.'\n\n'That man Umslopogaas seems to have a curious moral ascendency over his\ncompanions,' Good afterwards remarked thoughtfully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II THE BLACK HAND\n\n\n\nIn due course we left Lamu, and ten days afterwards we found ourselves\nat a spot called Charra, on the Tana River, having gone through many\nadventures which need not be recorded here. Amongst other things we\nvisited a ruined city, of which there are many on this coast, and\nwhich must once, to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of\nmosques and stone houses, have been very populous places. These ruined\ncities are immeasurably ancient, having, I believe, been places of\nwealth and importance as far back as the Old Testament times, when they\nwere centres of trade with India and elsewhere. But their glory has\ndeparted now--the slave trade has finished them--and where wealthy\nmerchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained\nin the crowded market-places, the lion holds his court at night, and\ninstead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the\nbidders, his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors. At this\nparticular place we discovered on a mound, covered up with rank growth\nand rubbish, two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is\npossible to conceive. The carving on them was simply exquisite, and I\nonly regret that we had no means of getting them away. No doubt they had\nonce been the entrances to a palace, of which, however, no traces were\nnow to be seen, though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound.\n\nGone! quite gone! the way that everything must go. Like the nobles and\nthe ladies who lived within their gates, these cities have had their\nday, and now they are as Babylon and Nineveh, and as London and Paris\nwill one day be. Nothing may endure. That is the inexorable law. Men\nand women, empires and cities, thrones, principalities, and powers,\nmountains, rivers, and unfathomed seas, worlds, spaces, and universes,\nall have their day, and all must go. In this ruined and forgotten place\nthe moralist may behold a symbol of the universal destiny. For this\nsystem of ours allows no room for standing still--nothing can loiter on\nthe road and check the progress of things upwards towards Life, or the\nrush of things downwards towards Death. The stern policeman Fate moves\nus and them on, on, uphill and downhill and across the level; there is\nno resting-place for the weary feet, till at last the abyss swallows us,\nand from the shores of the Transitory we are hurled into the sea of the\nEternal.\n\nAt Charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearers we\nhad hired to go as far as this, and who now wished to extort large extra\npayment from us. In the result he threatened to set the Masai--about\nwhom more anon--on to us. That night he, with all our hired bearers,\nran away, stealing most of the goods which had been entrusted to them\nto carry. Luckily, however, they had not happened to steal our rifles,\nammunition, and personal effects; not because of any delicacy of feeling\non their part, but owing to the fact that they chanced to be in the\ncharge of the five Wakwafis. After that, it was clear to us that we had\nhad enough of caravans and of bearers. Indeed, we had not much left for\na caravan to carry. And yet, how were we to get on?\n\nIt was Good who solved the question. 'Here is water,' he said, pointing\nto the Tana River; 'and yesterday I saw a party of natives hunting\nhippopotami in canoes. I understand that Mr Mackenzie's mission station\nis on the Tana River. Why not get into canoes and paddle up to it?'\n\nThis brilliant suggestion was, needless to say, received with\nacclamation; and I instantly set to work to buy suitable canoes from\nthe surrounding natives. I succeeded after a delay of three days in\nobtaining two large ones, each hollowed out of a single log of some\nlight wood, and capable of holding six people and baggage. For these two\ncanoes we had to pay nearly all our remaining cloth, and also many other\narticles.\n\nOn the day following our purchase of the two canoes we effected a\nstart. In the first canoe were Good, Sir Henry, and three of our\nWakwafi followers; in the second myself, Umslopogaas, and the other two\nWakwafis. As our course lay upstream, we had to keep four paddles at\nwork in each canoe, which meant that the whole lot of us, except Good,\nhad to row away like galley-slaves; and very exhausting work it was. I\nsay, except Good, for, of course, the moment that Good got into a boat\nhis foot was on his native heath, and he took command of the party. And\ncertainly he worked us. On shore Good is a gentle, mild-mannered man,\nand given to jocosity; but, as we found to our cost, Good in a boat was\na perfect demon. To begin with, he knew all about it, and we didn't. On\nall nautical subjects, from the torpedo fittings of a man-of-war down\nto the best way of handling the paddle of an African canoe, he was a\nperfect mine of information, which, to say the least of it, we were not.\nAlso his ideas of discipline were of the sternest, and, in short, he\ncame the royal naval officer over us pretty considerably, and paid us\nout amply for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land;\nbut, on the other hand, I am bound to say that he managed the boats\nadmirably.\n\nAfter the first day Good succeeded, with the help of some cloth and a\ncouple of poles, in rigging up a sail in each canoe, which lightened our\nlabours not a little. But the current ran very strong against us, and at\nthe best we were not able to make more than twenty miles a day. Our\nplan was to start at dawn, and paddle along till about half-past ten,\nby which time the sun got too hot to allow of further exertion. Then we\nmoored our canoes to the bank, and ate our frugal meal; after which\nwe ate or otherwise amused ourselves till about three o'clock, when we\nagain started, and rowed till within an hour of sundown, when we called\na halt for the night. On landing in the evening, Good would at once set\nto work, with the help of the Askari, to build a little 'scherm', or\nsmall enclosure, fenced with thorn bushes, and to light a fire. I, with\nSir Henry and Umslopogaas, would go out to shoot something for the pot.\nGenerally this was an easy task, for all sorts of game abounded on the\nbanks of the Tana. One night Sir Henry shot a young cow-giraffe, of\nwhich the marrow-bones were excellent; on another I got a couple of\nwaterbuck right and left; and once, to his own intense satisfaction,\nUmslopogaas (who, like most Zulus, was a vile shot with a rifle) managed\nto kill a fine fat eland with a Martini I had lent him. Sometimes\nwe varied our food by shooting some guinea-fowl, or bush-bustard\n(paau)--both of which were numerous--with a shot-gun, or by catching\na supply of beautiful yellow fish, with which the waters of the Tana\nswarmed, and which form, I believe, one of the chief food-supplies of\nthe crocodiles.\n\nThree days after our start an ominous incident occurred. We were just\ndrawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night, when\nwe caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty\nyards away, and intensely watching our approach. One glance was\nsufficient--although I was personally unacquainted with the tribe--to\ntell me that he was a Masai Elmoran, or young warrior. Indeed, had I\nhad any doubts, they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified\nejaculation of '_Masai_!' that burst simultaneously from the lips of our\nWakwafi followers, who are, as I think I have said, themselves bastard\nMasai.\n\nAnd what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage war-gear!\nAccustomed as I have been to savages all my life, I do not think that I\nhave ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or awe-inspiring. To\nbegin with, the man was enormously tall, quite as tall as Umslopogaas, I\nshould say, and beautifully, though somewhat slightly, shaped; but with\nthe face of a devil. In his right hand he held a spear about five and a\nhalf feet long, the blade being two and a half feet in length, by nearly\nthree inches in width, and having an iron spike at the end of the\nhandle that measured more than a foot. On his left arm was a large\nand well-made elliptical shield of buffalo hide, on which were painted\nstrange heraldic-looking devices. On his shoulders was a huge cape of\nhawk's feathers, and round his neck was a 'naibere', or strip of cotton,\nabout seventeen feet long, by one and a half broad, with a stripe of\ncolour running down the middle of it. The tanned goatskin robe, which\nformed his ordinary attire in times of peace, was tied lightly round his\nwaist, so as to serve the purposes of a belt, and through it were stuck,\non the right and left sides respectively, his short pear-shaped sime, or\nsword, which is made of a single piece of steel, and carried in a wooden\nsheath, and an enormous knobkerrie. But perhaps the most remarkable\nfeature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrich-feathers,\nwhich was fixed on the chin, and passed in front of the ears to the\nforehead, and, being shaped like an ellipse, completely framed the face,\nso that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of\nfeather fire-screen. Round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair,\nand, projecting from the upper portion of the calves, to which they were\nattached, were long spurs like spikes, from which flowed down tufts of\nthe beautiful black and waving hair of the Colobus monkey. Such was the\nelaborate array of the Masai Elmoran who stood watching the approach of\nour two canoes, but it is one which, to be appreciated, must be seen;\nonly those who see it do not often live to describe it. Of course I\ncould not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion\nof this my first introduction, being, indeed, amply taken up with the\nconsideration of the general effect, but I had plenty of subsequent\nopportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it\nup.\n\nWhilst we were hesitating what to do, the Masai warrior drew himself\nup in a dignified fashion, shook his huge spear at us, and, turning,\nvanished on the further side of the slope.\n\n'Hulloa!' holloaed Sir Henry from the other boat; 'our friend the\ncaravan leader has been as good as his word, and set the Masai after us.\nDo you think it will be safe to go ashore?'\n\nI did not think it would be at all safe; but, on the other hand, we had\nno means of cooking in the canoes, and nothing that we could eat raw,\nso it was difficult to know what to do. At last Umslopogaas simplified\nmatters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre, which he did, creeping\noff into the bush like a snake, while we hung off in the stream waiting\nfor him. In half an hour he returned, and told us that there was not a\nMasai to be seen anywhere about, but that he had discovered a spot where\nthey had recently been encamped, and that from various indications he\njudged that they must have moved on an hour or so before; the man we saw\nhaving, no doubt, been left to report upon our movements.\n\nThereupon we landed; and, having posted a sentry, proceeded to cook and\neat our evening meal. This done, we took the situation into our serious\nconsideration. Of course, it was possible that the apparition of the\nMasai warrior had nothing to do with us, that he was merely one of a\nband bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another\ntribe. But when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader, and\nreflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear\nat us, this did not appear very probable. On the contrary, what did\nseem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable\nopportunity to attack us. This being so, there were two things that\nwe could do--one of which was to go on, and the other to go back. The\nlatter idea was, however, rejected at once, it being obvious that we\nshould encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance; and, besides,\nwe had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price. Under these\ncircumstances, however, we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore, so\nwe got into our canoes, and, paddling out into the middle of the stream,\nwhich was not very wide here, managed to anchor them by means of big\nstones fastened to ropes made of coconut-fibre, of which there were\nseveral fathoms in each canoe.\n\nHere the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive, and this, combined with\nanxiety as to our position, effectually prevented me from sleeping as\nthe others were doing, notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid Tana\nmosquitoes. And so I lay awake, smoking and reflecting on many things,\nbut, being of a practical turn of mind, chiefly on how we were to give\nthose Masai villains the slip. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and,\nnotwithstanding the mosquitoes, and the great risk we were running from\nfever from sleeping in such a spot, and forgetting that I had the cramp\nvery badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position\nin the canoe, and that the Wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt\nhorribly, I really began to enjoy myself. The moonbeams played upon the\nsurface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards\nthe sea, like men's lives towards the grave, till it glittered like\na wide sheet of silver, that is in the open where the trees threw no\nshadows. Near the banks, however, it was very dark, and the night wind\nsighed sadly in the reeds. To our left, on the further side of the\nriver, was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees, and here I could\nmake out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water,\ntill suddenly there came an ominous roar, whereupon they all made off\nhurriedly. Then after a pause I caught sight of the massive form of His\nMajesty the Lion, coming down to drink his fill after meat. Presently he\nmoved on, then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us,\nand a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water, about\ntwenty yards from me, and snorted. It was the head of a hippopotamus.\nDown it went without a sound, only to rise again within five yards\nof where I sat. This was decidedly too near to be comfortable, more\nespecially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense\ncuriosity to know what on earth our canoes were. He opened his great\nmouth, to yawn, I suppose, and gave me an excellent view of his ivories;\nand I could not help reflecting how easily he could crunch up our frail\ncanoe with a single bite. Indeed, I had half a mind to give him a ball\nfrom my eight-bore, but on reflection determined to let him alone unless\nhe actually charged the boat. Presently he sank again as noiselessly as\nbefore, and I saw no more of him. Just then, on looking towards the bank\non our right, I fancied that I caught sight of a dark figure flitting\nbetween the tree trunks. I have very keen sight, and I was almost sure\nthat I saw something, but whether it was bird, beast, or man I could not\nsay. At the moment, however, a dark cloud passed over the moon, and I\nsaw no more of it. Just then, too, although all the other sounds of\nthe forest had ceased, a species of horned owl with which I was well\nacquainted began to hoot with great persistency. After that, save for\nthe rustling of trees and reeds when the wind caught them, there was\ncomplete silence.\n\nBut somehow, in the most unaccountable way, I had suddenly become\nnervous. There was no particular reason why I should be, beyond the\nordinary reasons which surround the Central African traveller, and yet I\nundoubtedly was. If there is one thing more than another of which I\nhave the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief, it is of\npresentiments, and yet here I was all of a sudden filled with and\npossessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil. I would\nnot give way to it, however, although I felt the cold perspiration stand\nout upon my forehead. I would not arouse the others. Worse and worse I\ngrew, my pulse fluttered like a dying man's, my nerves thrilled with\nthe horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to\nnightmare will be familiar with, but still my will triumphed over my\nfears, and I lay quiet (for I was half sitting, half lying, in the\nbow of the canoe), only turning my face so as to command a view of\nUmslopogaas and the two Wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and\nbeyond me.\n\nIn the distance I heard a hippopotamus splash faintly, then the owl\nhooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note {Endnote 4}, and\nthe wind began to moan plaintively through the trees, making a\nheart-chilling music. Above was the black bosom of the cloud, and\nbeneath me swept the black flood of the water, and I felt as though I\nand Death were utterly alone between them. It was very desolate.\n\nSuddenly my blood seemed to freeze in my veins, and my heart to stand\nstill. Was it fancy, or were we moving? I turned my eyes to look for\nthe other canoe which should be alongside of us. I could not see it, but\ninstead I saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above\nthe gunwale of the little boat. Surely it was a nightmare! At the same\ninstant a dim but devilish-looking face appeared to rise out of the\nwater, and then came a lurch of the canoe, the quick flash of a knife,\nand an awful yell from the Wakwafi who was sleeping by my side (the\nsame poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me), and something warm\nspurted into my face. In an instant the spell was broken; I knew that it\nwas no nightmare, but that we were attacked by swimming Masai. Snatching\nat the first weapon that came to hand, which happened to be Umslopogaas'\nbattleaxe, I struck with all my force in the direction in which I\nhad seen the flash of the knife. The blow fell upon a man's arm, and,\ncatching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe, completely\nsevered it from the body just above the wrist. As for its owner, he\nuttered no sound or cry. Like a ghost he came, and like a ghost he went,\nleaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife, or rather\na short sword, that was buried in the heart of our poor servant.\n\nInstantly there arose a hubbub and confusion, and I fancied, rightly\nor wrongly, that I made out several dark heads gliding away towards the\nright-hand bank, whither we were rapidly drifting, for the rope by which\nwe were moored had been severed with a knife. As soon as I had realized\nthis fact, I also realized that the scheme had been to cut the boat\nloose so that it should drift on to the right bank (as it would have\ndone with the natural swing of the current), where no doubt a party of\nMasai were waiting to dig their shovel-headed spears into us. Seizing\none paddle myself, I told Umslopogaas to take another (for the remaining\nAskari was too frightened and bewildered to be of any use), and together\nwe rowed vigorously out towards the middle of the stream; and not an\ninstant too soon, for in another minute we should have been aground, and\nthen there would have been an end of us.\n\nAs soon as we were well out, we set to work to paddle the canoe upstream\nagain to where the other was moored; and very hard and dangerous work\nit was in the dark, and with nothing but the notes of Good's stentorian\nshouts, which he kept firing off at intervals like a fog-horn, to guide\nus. But at last we fetched up, and were thankful to find that they\nhad not been molested at all. No doubt the owner of the same hand that\nsevered our rope should have severed theirs also, but was led away from\nhis purpose by an irresistible inclination to murder when he got the\nchance, which, while it cost us a man and him his hand, undoubtedly\nsaved all the rest of us from massacre. Had it not been for that ghastly\napparition over the side of the boat--an apparition that I shall never\nforget till my dying hour--the canoe would undoubtedly have drifted\nashore before I realized what had happened, and this history would never\nhave been written by me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III THE MISSION STATION\n\n\n\nWe made the remains of our rope fast to the other canoe, and sat waiting\nfor the dawn and congratulating ourselves upon our merciful escape,\nwhich really seemed to result more from the special favour of Providence\nthan from our own care or prowess. At last it came, and I have not\noften been more grateful to see the light, though so far as my canoe was\nconcerned it revealed a ghastly sight. There in the bottom of the little\nboat lay the unfortunate Askari, the sime, or sword, in his bosom, and\nthe severed hand gripping the handle. I could not bear the sight, so\nhauling up the stone which had served as an anchor to the other canoe,\nwe made it fast to the murdered man and dropped him overboard, and down\nhe went to the bottom, leaving nothing but a train of bubbles behind\nhim. Alas! when our time comes, most of us like him leave nothing but\nbubbles behind, to show that we have been, and the bubbles soon burst.\nThe hand of his murderer we threw into the stream, where it slowly sank.\nThe sword, of which the handle was ivory, inlaid with gold (evidently\nArab work), I kept and used as a hunting-knife, and very useful it\nproved.\n\nThen, a man having been transferred to my canoe, we once more started on\nin very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future,\nbut fondly hoping to arrive at the 'Highlands' station by night. To make\nmatters worse, within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents,\nwetting us to the skin, and even necessitating the occasional baling\nof the canoes, and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the\nsails, and had to get along as best as we could with our paddles.\n\nAt eleven o'clock we halted on an open piece of ground on the left bank\nof the river, and, the rain abating a little, managed to make a fire and\ncatch and broil some fish. We did not dare to wander about to search for\ngame. At two o'clock we got off again, taking a supply of broiled fish\nwith us, and shortly afterwards the rain came on harder than ever. Also\nthe river began to get exceedingly difficult to navigate on account of\nthe numerous rocks, reaches of shallow water, and the increased force of\nthe current; so that it soon became clear to us that we should not reach\nthe Rev. Mackenzie's hospitable roof that night--a prospect that did\nnot tend to enliven us. Toil as we would, we could not make more than\nan average of a mile an hour, and at five o'clock in the afternoon (by\nwhich time we were all utterly worn out) we reckoned that we were still\nquite ten miles below the station. This being so, we set to work to\nmake the best arrangements we could for the night. After our recent\nexperience, we simply did not dare to land, more especially as the banks\nof the Tana were clothed with dense bush that would have given cover to\nfive thousand Masai, and at first I thought that we were going to have\nanother night of it in the canoes. Fortunately, however, we espied a\nlittle rocky islet, not more than fifteen miles or so square, situated\nnearly in the middle of the river. For this we paddled, and, making fast\nthe canoes, landed and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances\nwould permit, which was very uncomfortable indeed. As for the weather,\nit continued to be simply vile, the rain coming down in sheets till we\nwere chilled to the marrow, and utterly preventing us from lighting a\nfire. There was, however, one consoling circumstance about this rain;\nour Askari declared that nothing would induce the Masai to make an\nattack in it, as they intensely disliked moving about in the wet,\nperhaps, as Good suggested, because they hate the idea of washing. We\nate some insipid and sodden cold fish--that is, with the exception of\nUmslopogaas, who, like most Zulus, cannot bear fish--and took a pull of\nbrandy, of which we fortunately had a few bottles left, and then began\nwhat, with one exception--when we same three white men nearly perished\nof cold on the snow of Sheba's Breast in the course of our journey to\nKukuanaland--was, I think, the most trying night I ever experienced. It\nseemed absolutely endless, and once or twice I feared that two of the\nAskari would have died of the wet, cold, and exposure. Indeed, had it\nnot been for timely doses of brandy I am sure that they would have died,\nfor no African people can stand much exposure, which first paralyses and\nthen kills them. I could see that even that iron old warrior Umslopogaas\nfelt it keenly; though, in strange contrast to the Wakwafis, who\ngroaned and bemoaned their fate unceasingly, he never uttered a single\ncomplaint. To make matters worse, about one in the morning we again\nheard the owl's ominous hooting, and had at once to prepare ourselves\nfor another attack; though, if it had been attempted, I do not think\nthat we could have offered a very effective resistance. But either the\nowl was a real one this time, or else the Masai were themselves too\nmiserable to think of offensive operations, which, indeed, they rarely,\nif ever, undertake in bush veldt. At any rate, we saw nothing of them.\n\nAt last the dawn came gliding across the water, wrapped in wreaths of\nghostly mist, and, with the daylight, the rain ceased; and then, out\ncame the glorious sun, sucking up the mists and warming the chill air.\nBenumbed, and utterly exhausted, we dragged ourselves to our feet, and\nwent and stood in the bright rays, and were thankful for them. I can\nquite understand how it is that primitive people become sun worshippers,\nespecially if their conditions of life render them liable to exposure.\n\nIn half an hour more we were once again making fair progress with the\nhelp of a good wind. Our spirits had returned with the sunshine, and\nwe were ready to laugh at difficulties and dangers that had been almost\ncrushing on the previous day.\n\nAnd so we went on cheerily till about eleven o'clock. Just as we were\nthinking of halting as usual, to rest and try to shoot something to eat,\na sudden bend in the river brought us in sight of a substantial-looking\nEuropean house with a veranda round it, splendidly situated upon a hill,\nand surrounded by a high stone wall with a ditch on the outer side.\nRight against and overshadowing the house was an enormous pine, the\ntop of which we had seen through a glass for the last two days, but of\ncourse without knowing that it marked the site of the mission station.\nI was the first to see the house, and could not restrain myself from\ngiving a hearty cheer, in which the others, including the natives,\njoined lustily. There was no thought of halting now. On we laboured,\nfor, unfortunately, though the house seemed quite near, it was still a\nlong way off by river, until at last, by one o'clock, we found ourselves\nat the bottom of the slope on which the building stood. Running the\ncanoes to the bank, we disembarked, and were just hauling them up on\nto the shore, when we perceived three figures, dressed in ordinary\nEnglish-looking clothes, hurrying down through a grove of trees to meet\nus.\n\n'A gentleman, a lady, and a little girl,' ejaculated Good, after\nsurveying the trio through his eyeglass, 'walking in a civilized\nfashion, through a civilized garden, to meet us in this place. Hang me,\nif this isn't the most curious thing we have seen yet!'\n\nGood was right: it certainly did seem odd and out of place--more like a\nscene out of a dream or an Italian opera than a real tangible fact;\nand the sense of unreality was not lessened when we heard ourselves\naddressed in good broad Scotch, which, however, I cannot reproduce.\n\n'How do you do, sirs,' said Mr Mackenzie, a grey-haired, angular man,\nwith a kindly face and red cheeks; 'I hope I see you very well. My\nnatives told me an hour ago they spied two canoes with white men in them\ncoming up the river; so we have just come down to meet you.'\n\n'And it is very glad that we are to see a white face again, let me tell\nyou,' put in the lady--a charming and refined-looking person.\n\nWe took off our hats in acknowledgment, and proceeded to introduce\nourselves.\n\n'And now,' said Mr Mackenzie, 'you must all be hungry and weary; so come\non, gentlemen, come on, and right glad we are to see you. The last white\nwho visited us was Alphonse--you will see Alphonse presently--and that\nwas a year ago.'\n\nMeanwhile we had been walking up the slope of the hill, the lower\nportion of which was fenced off, sometimes with quince fences and\nsometimes with rough stone walls, into Kaffir gardens, just now full\nof crops of mealies, pumpkins, potatoes, etc. In the corners of these\ngardens were groups of neat mushroom-shaped huts, occupied by Mr\nMackenzie's mission natives, whose women and children came pouring\nout to meet us as we walked. Through the centre of the gardens ran the\nroadway up which we were walking. It was bordered on each side by a line\nof orange trees, which, although they had only been planted ten years,\nhad in the lovely climate of the uplands below Mt Kenia, the base of\nwhich is about 5,000 feet above the coastline level, already grown to\nimposing proportions, and were positively laden with golden fruit. After\na stiffish climb of a quarter of a mile or so--for the hillside was\nsteep--we came to a splendid quince fence, also covered with fruit,\nwhich enclosed, Mr Mackenzie told us, a space of about four acres\nof ground that contained his private garden, house, church, and\noutbuildings, and, indeed, the whole hilltop. And what a garden it was!\nI have always loved a good garden, and I could have thrown up my hands\nfor joy when I saw Mr Mackenzie's. First there were rows upon rows of\nstandard European fruit-trees, all grafted; for on top of this hill the\nclimate was so temperate that nearly all the English vegetables, trees,\nand flowers flourished luxuriantly, even including several varieties\nof the apple, which, generally, runs to wood in a warm climate and\nobstinately refuses to fruit. Then there were strawberries and tomatoes\n(such tomatoes!), and melons and cucumbers, and, indeed, every sort of\nvegetable and fruit.\n\n'Well, you have something like a garden!' I said, overpowered with\nadmiration not untouched by envy.\n\n'Yes,' answered the missionary, 'it is a very good garden, and has well\nrepaid my labour; but it is the climate that I have to thank. If you\nstick a peach-stone into the ground it will bear fruit the fourth year,\nand a rose-cutting will bloom in a year. It is a lovely clime.'\n\nJust then we came to a ditch about ten feet wide, and full of water, on\nthe other side of which was a loopholed stone wall eight feet high, and\nwith sharp flints plentifully set in mortar on the coping.\n\n'There,' said Mr Mackenzie, pointing to the ditch and wall, 'this is my\nmagnum opus; at least, this and the church, which is the other side of\nthe house. It took me and twenty natives two years to dig the ditch and\nbuild the wall, but I never felt safe till it was done; and now I can\ndefy all the savages in Africa, for the spring that fills the ditch\nis inside the wall, and bubbles out at the top of the hill winter and\nsummer alike, and I always keep a store of four months' provision in the\nhouse.'\n\nCrossing over a plank and through a very narrow opening in the wall, we\nentered into what Mrs Mackenzie called _her_ domain--namely, the flower\ngarden, the beauty of which is really beyond my power to describe. I\ndo not think I ever saw such roses, gardenias, or camellias (all reared\nfrom seeds or cuttings sent from England); and there was also a patch\ngiven up to a collection of bulbous roots mostly collected by Miss\nFlossie, Mr Mackenzie's little daughter, from the surrounding country,\nsome of which were surpassingly beautiful. In the middle of this garden,\nand exactly opposite the veranda, a beautiful fountain of clear water\nbubbled up from the ground, and fell into a stone-work basin which had\nbeen carefully built to receive it, whence the overflow found its way by\nmeans of a drain to the moat round the outer wall, this moat in its\nturn serving as a reservoir, whence an unfailing supply of water\nwas available to irrigate all the gardens below. The house itself, a\nmassively built single-storied building, was roofed with slabs of stone,\nand had a handsome veranda in front. It was built on three sides of\na square, the fourth side being taken up by the kitchens, which stood\nseparate from the house--a very good plan in a hot country. In the\ncentre of this square thus formed was, perhaps, the most remarkable\nobject that we had yet seen in this charming place, and that was a\nsingle tree of the conifer tribe, varieties of which grow freely on the\nhighlands of this part of Africa. This splendid tree, which Mr Mackenzie\ninformed us was a landmark for fifty miles round, and which we had\nourselves seen for the last forty miles of our journey, must have been\nnearly three hundred feet in height, the trunk measuring about sixteen\nfeet in diameter at a yard from the ground. For some seventy feet it\nrose a beautiful tapering brown pillar without a single branch, but at\nthat height splendid dark green boughs, which, looked at from below, had\nthe appearance of gigantic fern-leaves, sprang out horizontally from\nthe trunk, projecting right over the house and flower-garden, to both of\nwhich they furnished a grateful proportion of shade, without--being so\nhigh up--offering any impediment to the passage of light and air.\n\n'What a beautiful tree!' exclaimed Sir Henry.\n\n'Yes, you are right; it is a beautiful tree. There is not another like\nit in all the country round, that I know of,' answered Mr Mackenzie. 'I\ncall it my watch tower. As you see, I have a rope ladder fixed to the\nlowest bough; and if I want to see anything that is going on within\nfifteen miles or so, all I have to do is to run up it with a spyglass.\nBut you must be hungry, and I am sure the dinner is cooked. Come in,\nmy friends; it is but a rough place, but well enough for these savage\nparts; and I can tell you what, we have got--a French cook.' And he led\nthe way on to the veranda.\n\nAs I was following him, and wondering what on earth he could mean by\nthis, there suddenly appeared, through the door that opened on to the\nveranda from the house, a dapper little man, dressed in a neat blue\ncotton suit, with shoes made of tanned hide, and remarkable for a\nbustling air and most enormous black mustachios, shaped into an\nupward curve, and coming to a point for all the world like a pair of\nbuffalo-horns.\n\n'Madame bids me for to say that dinnar is sarved. Messieurs, my\ncompliments;' then suddenly perceiving Umslopogaas, who was loitering\nalong after us and playing with his battleaxe, he threw up his hands\nin astonishment. 'Ah, mais quel homme!' he ejaculated in French, 'quel\nsauvage affreux! Take but note of his huge choppare and the great pit in\nhis head.'\n\n'Ay,' said Mr Mackenzie; 'what are you talking about, Alphonse?'\n\n'Talking about!' replied the little Frenchman, his eyes still fixed upon\nUmslopogaas, whose general appearance seemed to fascinate him; 'why I\ntalk of him'--and he rudely pointed--'of ce monsieur noir.'\n\nAt this everybody began to laugh, and Umslopogaas, perceiving that he\nwas the object of remark, frowned ferociously, for he had a most lordly\ndislike of anything like a personal liberty.\n\n'Parbleu!' said Alphonse, 'he is angered--he makes the grimace. I like\nnot his air. I vanish.' And he did with considerable rapidity.\n\nMr Mackenzie joined heartily in the shout of laughter which we indulged\nin. 'He is a queer character--Alphonse,' he said. 'By and by I will tell\nyou his history; in the meanwhile let us try his cooking.'\n\n'Might I ask,' said Sir Henry, after we had eaten a most excellent\ndinner, 'how you came to have a French cook in these wilds?'\n\n'Oh,' answered Mrs Mackenzie, 'he arrived here of his own accord about\na year ago, and asked to be taken into our service. He had got into some\ntrouble in France, and fled to Zanzibar, where he found an application\nhad been made by the French Government for his extradition. Whereupon\nhe rushed off up-country, and fell in, when nearly starved, with our\ncaravan of men, who were bringing us our annual supply of goods, and was\nbrought on here. You should get him to tell you the story.'\n\nWhen dinner was over we lit our pipes, and Sir Henry proceeded to give\nour host a description of our journey up here, over which he looked very\ngrave.\n\n'It is evident to me,' he said, 'that those rascally Masai are following\nyou, and I am very thankful that you have reached this house in\nsafety. I do not think that they will dare to attack you here. It is\nunfortunate, though, that nearly all my men have gone down to the coast\nwith ivory and goods. There are two hundred of them in the caravan, and\nthe consequence is that I have not more than twenty men available for\ndefensive purposes in case they should attack us. But, still, I will\njust give a few orders;' and, calling a black man who was loitering\nabout outside in the garden, he went to the window, and addressed him in\na Swahili dialect. The man listened, and then saluted and departed.\n\n'I am sure I devoutly hope that we shall bring no such calamity upon\nyou,' said I, anxiously, when he had taken his seat again. 'Rather than\nbring those bloodthirsty villains about your ears, we will move on and\ntake our chance.'\n\n'You will do nothing of the sort. If the Masai come, they come, and\nthere is an end on it; and I think we can give them a pretty warm\ngreeting. I would not show any man the door for all the Masai in the\nworld.'\n\n'That reminds me,' I said, 'the Consul at Lamu told me that he had had\na letter from you, in which you said that a man had arrived here who\nreported that he had come across a white people in the interior. Do you\nthink that there was any truth in his story? I ask, because I have once\nor twice in my life heard rumours from natives who have come down from\nthe far north of the existence of such a race.'\n\nMr Mackenzie, by way of answer, went out of the room and returned,\nbringing with him a most curious sword. It was long, and all the blade,\nwhich was very thick and heavy, was to within a quarter of an inch of\nthe cutting edge worked into an ornamental pattern exactly as we work\nsoft wood with a fret-saw, the steel, however, being invariably pierced\nin such a way as not to interfere with the strength of the sword. This\nin itself was sufficiently curious, but what was still more so was that\nall the edges of the hollow spaces cut through the substance of the\nblade were most beautifully inlaid with gold, which was in some way that\nI cannot understand welded on to the steel {Endnote 5}.\n\n'There,' said Mr Mackenzie, 'did you ever see a sword like that?'\n\nWe all examined it and shook our heads.\n\n'Well, I have got it to show you, because this is what the man who said\nhe had seen the white people brought with him, and because it does more\nor less give an air of truth to what I should otherwise have set down\nas a lie. Look here; I will tell you all that I know about the matter,\nwhich is not much. One afternoon, just before sunset, I was sitting on\nthe veranda, when a poor, miserable, starved-looking man came limping up\nand squatted down before me. I asked him where he came from and what he\nwanted, and thereon he plunged into a long rambling narrative about how\nhe belonged to a tribe far in the north, and how his tribe was destroyed\nby another tribe, and he with a few other survivors driven still further\nnorth past a lake named Laga. Thence, it appears, he made his way to\nanother lake that lay up in the mountains, \"a lake without a bottom\"\nhe called it, and here his wife and brother died of an infectious\nsickness--probably smallpox--whereon the people drove him out of their\nvillages into the wilderness, where he wandered miserably over mountains\nfor ten days, after which he got into dense thorn forest, and was one\nday found there by some _white men_ who were hunting, and who took him\nto a place where all the people were white and lived in stone houses.\nHere he remained a week shut up in a house, till one night a man with\na white beard, whom he understood to be a \"medicine-man\", came and\ninspected him, after which he was led off and taken through the thorn\nforest to the confines of the wilderness, and given food and this sword\n(at least so he said), and turned loose.'\n\n'Well,' said Sir Henry, who had been listening with breathless interest,\n'and what did he do then?'\n\n'Oh! he seems, according to his account, to have gone through sufferings\nand hardships innumerable, and to have lived for weeks on roots and\nberries, and such things as he could catch and kill. But somehow he did\nlive, and at last by slow degrees made his way south and reached this\nplace. What the details of his journey were I never learnt, for I told\nhim to return on the morrow, bidding one of my headmen look after him\nfor the night. The headman took him away, but the poor man had the itch\nso badly that the headman's wife would not have him in the hut for fear\nof catching it, so he was given a blanket and told to sleep outside.\nAs it happened, we had a lion hanging about here just then, and most\nunhappily he winded this unfortunate wanderer, and, springing on him,\nbit his head almost off without the people in the hut knowing anything\nabout it, and there was an end of him and his story about the white\npeople; and whether or no there is any truth in it is more than I can\ntell you. What do you think, Mr Quatermain?'\n\nI shook my head, and answered, 'I don't know. There are so many queer\nthings hidden away in the heart of this great continent that I should\nbe sorry to assert that there was no truth in it. Anyhow, we mean to try\nand find out. We intend to journey to Lekakisera, and thence, if we live\nto get so far, to this Lake Laga; and, if there are any white people\nbeyond, we will do our best to find them.'\n\n'You are very venturesome people,' said Mr Mackenzie, with a smile, and\nthe subject dropped.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV ALPHONSE AND HIS ANNETTE\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we thoroughly inspected all the outbuildings and grounds\nof the station, which I consider the most successful as well as the most\nbeautiful place of the sort that I have seen in Africa. We then returned\nto the veranda, where we found Umslopogaas taking advantage of this\nfavourable opportunity to clean all the rifles thoroughly. This was the\nonly _work_ that he ever did or was asked to do, for as a Zulu chief it\nwas beneath his dignity to work with his hands; but such as it was he\ndid it very well. It was a curious sight to see the great Zulu sitting\nthere upon the floor, his battleaxe resting against the wall behind\nhim, whilst his long aristocratic-looking hands were busily employed,\ndelicately and with the utmost care, cleaning the mechanism of the\nbreech-loaders. He had a name for each gun. One--a double four-bore\nbelonging to Sir Henry--was the Thunderer; another, my 500 Express,\nwhich had a peculiarly sharp report, was 'the little one who spoke like\na whip'; the Winchester repeaters were 'the women, who talked so fast\nthat you could not tell one word from another'; the six Martinis were\n'the common people'; and so on with them all. It was very curious to\nhear him addressing each gun as he cleaned it, as though it were an\nindividual, and in a vein of the quaintest humour. He did the same with\nhis battle-axe, which he seemed to look upon as an intimate friend,\nand to which he would at times talk by the hour, going over all his old\nadventures with it--and dreadful enough some of them were. By a piece of\ngrim humour, he had named this axe 'Inkosi-kaas', which is the Zulu word\nfor chieftainess. For a long while I could not make out why he gave it\nsuch a name, and at last I asked him, when he informed me that the axe\nwas very evidently feminine, because of her womanly habit of prying very\ndeep into things, and that she was clearly a chieftainess because all\nmen fell down before her, struck dumb at the sight of her beauty and\npower. In the same way he would consult 'Inkosi-kaas' if in any dilemma;\nand when I asked him why he did so, he informed me it was because she\nmust needs be wise, having 'looked into so many people's brains'.\n\nI took up the axe and closely examined this formidable weapon. It was,\nas I have said, of the nature of a pole-axe. The haft, made out of an\nenormous rhinoceros horn, was three feet three inches long, about an\ninch and a quarter thick, and with a knob at the end as large as a\nMaltese orange, left there to prevent the hand from slipping. This\nhorn haft, though so massive, was as flexible as cane, and practically\nunbreakable; but, to make assurance doubly sure, it was whipped round\nat intervals of a few inches with copper wire--all the parts where the\nhands grip being thus treated. Just above where the haft entered the\nhead were scored a number of little nicks, each nick representing a man\nkilled in battle with the weapon. The axe itself was made of the\nmost beautiful steel, and apparently of European manufacture, though\nUmslopogaas did not know where it came from, having taken it from the\nhand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before. It was not\nvery heavy, the head weighing two and a half pounds, as nearly as I\ncould judge. The cutting part was slightly concave in shape--not convex,\nas it generally the case with savage battleaxes--and sharp as a razor,\nmeasuring five and three-quarter inches across the widest part. From the\nback of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long, for the last two\nof which it was hollow, and shaped like a leather punch, with an opening\nfor anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed\nout above--in fact, in this respect it exactly resembled a butcher's\npole-axe. It was with this punch end, as we afterwards discovered, that\nUmslopogaas usually struck when fighting, driving a neat round hole\nin his adversary's skull, and only using the broad cutting edge for a\ncircular sweep, or sometimes in a melee. I think he considered the\npunch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool, and it was from his habit\nof pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of 'Woodpecker'.\nCertainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one.\n\nSuch was Umslopogaas' axe, Inkosi-kaas, the most remarkable and fatal\nhand-to-hand weapon that I ever saw, and one which he cherished as\nmuch as his own life. It scarcely ever left his hand except when he was\neating, and then he always sat with it under his leg.\n\nJust as I returned his axe to Umslopogaas, Miss Flossie came up and took\nme off to see her collection of flowers, African liliums, and blooming\nshrubs, some of which are very beautiful, many of the varieties being\nquite unknown to me and also, I believe, to botanical science. I asked\nher if she had ever seen or heard of the 'Goya' lily, which Central\nAfrican explorers have told me they have occasionally met with and whose\nwonderful loveliness has filled them with astonishment. This lily, which\nthe natives say blooms only once in ten years, flourishes in the\nmost arid soil. Compared to the size of the bloom, the bulb is small,\ngenerally weighing about four pounds. As for the flower itself (which\nI afterwards saw under circumstances likely to impress its appearance\nfixedly in my mind), I know not how to describe its beauty and\nsplendour, or the indescribable sweetness of its perfume. The\nflower--for it has only one bloom--rises from the crown of the bulb on\na thick fleshy and flat-sided stem, the specimen that I saw measured\nfourteen inches in diameter, and is somewhat trumpet-shaped like the\nbloom of an ordinary 'longiflorum' set vertically. First there is\nthe green sheath, which in its early stage is not unlike that of a\nwater-lily, but which as the bloom opens splits into four portions and\ncurls back gracefully towards the stem. Then comes the bloom itself, a\nsingle dazzling arch of white enclosing another cup of richest velvety\ncrimson, from the heart of which rises a golden-coloured pistil. I have\nnever seen anything to equal this bloom in beauty or fragrance, and as\nI believe it is but little known, I take the liberty to describe it at\nlength. Looking at it for the first time I well remember that I realized\nhow even in a flower there dwells something of the majesty of its Maker.\nTo my great delight Miss Flossie told me that she knew the flower well\nand had tried to grow it in her garden, but without success, adding,\nhowever, that as it should be in bloom at this time of the year she\nthought that she could procure me a specimen.\n\nAfter that I fell to asking her if she was not lonely up here among all\nthese savage people and without any companions of her own age.\n\n'Lonely?' she said. 'Oh, indeed no! I am as happy as the day is long,\nand besides I have my own companions. Why, I should hate to be buried\nin a crowd of white girls all just like myself so that nobody could tell\nthe difference! Here,' she said, giving her head a little toss, 'I am I;\nand every native for miles around knows the \"Water-lily\",--for that is\nwhat they call me--and is ready to do what I want, but in the books that\nI have read about little girls in England it is not like that. Everybody\nthinks them a trouble, and they have to do what their schoolmistress\nlikes. Oh! it would break my heart to be put in a cage like that and not\nto be free--free as the air.'\n\n'Would you not like to learn?' I asked.\n\n'So I do learn. Father teaches me Latin and French and arithmetic.'\n\n'And are you never afraid among all these wild men?'\n\n'Afraid? Oh no! they never interfere with me. I think they believe that\nI am \"Ngai\" (of the Divinity) because I am so white and have fair hair.\nAnd look here,' and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress\nshe produced a double-barrelled nickel-plated Derringer, 'I always carry\nthat loaded, and if anybody tried to touch me I should shoot him. Once\nI shot a leopard that jumped upon my donkey as I was riding along. It\nfrightened me very much, but I shot it in the ear and it fell dead,\nand I have its skin upon my bed. Look there!' she went on in an altered\nvoice, touching me on the arm and pointing to some far-away object, 'I\nsaid just now that I had companions; there is one of them.'\n\nI looked, and for the first time there burst upon my sight the glory of\nMount Kenia. Hitherto the mountain had always been hidden in mist, but\nnow its radiant beauty was unveiled for many thousand feet, although\nthe base was still wrapped in vapour so that the lofty peak or pillar,\ntowering nearly twenty thousand feet into the sky, appeared to be a\nfairy vision, hanging between earth and heaven, and based upon the\nclouds. The solemn majesty and beauty of this white peak are together\nbeyond the power of my poor pen to describe. There it rose straight and\nsheer--a glittering white glory, its crest piercing the very blue of\nheaven. As I gazed at it with that little girl I felt my whole heart\nlifted up with an indescribable emotion, and for a moment great and\nwonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind, even as the arrows of\nthe setting sun were breaking upon Kenia's snows. Mr Mackenzie's natives\ncall the mountain the 'Finger of God', and to me it did seem eloquent\nof immortal peace and of the pure high calm that surely lies above this\nfevered world. Somewhere I had heard a line of poetry,\n\n     A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,\n\nand now it came into my mind, and for the first time I thoroughly\nunderstood what it meant. Base, indeed, would be the man who could look\nupon that mighty snow-wreathed pile--that white old tombstone of the\nyears--and not feel his own utter insignificance, and, by whatever name\nhe calls Him, worship God in his heart. Such sights are like visions of\nthe spirit; they throw wide the windows of the chamber of our small\nselfishness and let in a breath of that air that rushes round the\nrolling spheres, and for a while illumine our darkness with a far-off\ngleam of the white light which beats upon the Throne.\n\nYes, such things of beauty are indeed a joy for ever, and I can well\nunderstand what little Flossie meant when she talked of Kenia as her\ncompanion. As Umslopogaas, savage old Zulu that he was, said when I\npointed out to him the peak hanging in the glittering air: 'A man might\nlook thereon for a thousand years and yet be hungry to see.' But he gave\nrather another colour to his poetical idea when he added in a sort of\nchant, and with a touch of that weird imagination for which the man was\nremarkable, that when he was dead he should like his spirit to sit upon\nthat snow-clad peak for ever, and to rush down the steep white sides\nin the breath of the whirlwind, or on the flash of the lightning, and\n'slay, and slay, and slay'.\n\n'Slay what, you old bloodhound?' I asked.\n\nThis rather puzzled him, but at length he answered--\n\n'The other shadows.'\n\n'So thou wouldst continue thy murdering even after death?' I said.\n\n'I murder not,' he answered hotly; 'I kill in fair fight. Man is born to\nkill. He who kills not when his blood is hot is a woman, and no man. The\npeople who kill not are slaves. I say I kill in fair fight; and when\nI am \"in the shadow\", as you white men say, I hope to go on killing in\nfair fight. May my shadow be accursed and chilled to the bone for ever\nif it should fall to murdering like a bushman with his poisoned arrows!'\nAnd he stalked away with much dignity, and left me laughing.\n\nJust then the spies whom our host had sent out in the morning to find\nout if there were any traces of our Masai friends about, returned,\nand reported that the country had been scoured for fifteen miles round\nwithout a single Elmoran being seen, and that they believed that those\ngentry had given up the pursuit and returned whence they came. Mr\nMackenzie gave a sigh of relief when he heard this, and so indeed did\nwe, for we had had quite enough of the Masai to last us for some time.\nIndeed, the general opinion was that, finding we had reached the mission\nstation in safety, they had, knowing its strength, given up the pursuit\nof us as a bad job. How ill-judged that view was the sequel will show.\n\nAfter the spies had gone, and Mrs Mackenzie and Flossie had retired for\nthe night, Alphonse, the little Frenchman, came out, and Sir Henry, who\nis a very good French scholar, got him to tell us how he came to visit\nCentral Africa, which he did in a most extraordinary lingo, that for the\nmost part I shall not attempt to reproduce.\n\n'My grandfather,' he began, 'was a soldier of the Guard, and served\nunder Napoleon. He was in the retreat from Moscow, and lived for ten\ndays on his own leggings and a pair he stole from a comrade. He used to\nget drunk--he died drunk, and I remember playing at drums on his coffin.\nMy father--'\n\nHere we suggested that he might skip his ancestry and come to the point.\n\n'Bien, messieurs!' replied this comical little man, with a polite bow.\n'I did only wish to demonstrate that the military principle is not\nhereditary. My grandfather was a splendid man, six feet two high, broad\nin proportion, a swallower of fire and gaiters. Also he was remarkable\nfor his moustache. To me there remains the moustache and--nothing more.\n\n'I am, messieurs, a cook, and I was born at Marseilles. In that dear\ntown I spent my happy youth. For years and years I washed the dishes at\nthe Hotel Continental. Ah, those were golden days!' and he sighed. 'I am\na Frenchman. Need I say, messieurs, that I admire beauty? Nay, I adore\nthe fair. Messieurs, we admire all the roses in a garden, but we pluck\none. I plucked one, and alas, messieurs, it pricked my finger. She was\na chambermaid, her name Annette, her figure ravishing, her face\nan angel's, her heart--alas, messieurs, that I should have to\nown it!--black and slippery as a patent leather boot. I loved to\ndesperation, I adored her to despair. She transported me--in every\nsense; she inspired me. Never have I cooked as I cooked (for I had been\npromoted at the hotel) when Annette, my adored Annette, smiled on me.\nNever'--and here his manly voice broke into a sob--'never shall I cook\nso well again.' Here he melted into tears.\n\n'Come, cheer up!' said Sir Henry in French, smacking him smartly on the\nback. 'There's no knowing what may happen, you know. To judge from your\ndinner today, I should say you were in a fair way to recovery.'\n\nAlphonse stopped weeping, and began to rub his back. 'Monsieur,' he\nsaid, 'doubtless means to console, but his hand is heavy. To continue:\nwe loved, and were happy in each other's love. The birds in their little\nnest could not be happier than Alphonse and his Annette. Then came the\nblow--sapristi!--when I think of it. Messieurs will forgive me if I wipe\naway a tear. Mine was an evil number; I was drawn for the conscription.\nFortune would be avenged on me for having won the heart of Annette.\n\n'The evil moment came; I had to go. I tried to run away, but I was\ncaught by brutal soldiers, and they banged me with the butt-end\nof muskets till my mustachios curled with pain. I had a cousin a\nlinen-draper, well-to-do, but very ugly. He had drawn a good number,\nand sympathized when they thumped me. \"To thee, my cousin,\" I said, \"to\nthee, in whose veins flows the blue blood of our heroic grandparent, to\nthee I consign Annette. Watch over her whilst I hunt for glory in the\nbloody field.\"\n\n'\"Make your mind easy,\" said he; \"I will.\" As the sequel shows, he did!\n\n'I went. I lived in barracks on black soup. I am a refined man and a\npoet by nature, and I suffered tortures from the coarse horror of my\nsurroundings. There was a drill sergeant, and he had a cane. Ah, that\ncane, how it curled! Alas, never can I forget it!\n\n'One morning came the news; my battalion was ordered to Tonquin.\nThe drill sergeant and the other coarse monsters rejoiced. I--I made\nenquiries about Tonquin. They were not satisfactory. In Tonquin are\nsavage Chinese who rip you open. My artistic tastes--for I am also an\nartist--recoiled from the idea of being ripped open. The great man makes\nup his mind quickly. I made up my mind. I determined not to be ripped\nopen. I deserted.\n\n'I reached Marseilles disguised as an old man. I went to the house of\nmy cousin--he in whom runs my grandfather's heroic blood--and there sat\nAnnette. It was the season of cherries. They took a double stalk. At\neach end was a cherry. My cousin put one into his mouth, Annette put\nthe other in hers. Then they drew the stalks in till their eyes met--and\nalas, alas that I should have to say it!--they kissed. The game was\na pretty one, but it filled me with fury. The heroic blood of my\ngrandfather boiled up in me. I rushed into the kitchen. I struck my\ncousin with the old man's crutch. He fell--I had slain him. Alas, I\nbelieve that I did slay him. Annette screamed. The gendarmes came. I\nfled. I reached the harbour. I hid aboard a vessel. The vessel put to\nsea. The captain found me and beat me. He took an opportunity. He posted\na letter from a foreign port to the police. He did not put me ashore\nbecause I cooked so well. I cooked for him all the way to Zanzibar. When\nI asked for payment he kicked me. The blood of my heroic grandfather\nboiled within me, and I shook my fist in his face and vowed to have my\nrevenge. He kicked me again. At Zanzibar there was a telegram. I cursed\nthe man who invented telegraphs. Now I curse him again. I was to be\narrested for desertion, for murder, and que sais-je? I escaped from\nthe prison. I fled, I starved. I met the men of Monsieur le Cure. They\nbrought me here. I am full of woe. But I return not to France. Better to\nrisk my life in these horrible places than to know the Bagne.'\n\nHe paused, and we nearly choked with laughter, having to turn our faces\naway.\n\n'Ah! you weep, messieurs,' he said. 'No wonder--it is a sad story.'\n\n'Perhaps,' said Sir Henry, 'the heroic blood of your grandparent will\ntriumph after all; perhaps you will still be great. At any rate we shall\nsee. And now I vote we go to bed. I am dead tired, and we had not much\nsleep on that confounded rock last night.'\n\nAnd so we did, and very strange the tidy rooms and clean white sheets\nseemed to us after our recent experiences.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V UMSLOPOGAAS MAKES A PROMISE\n\n\n\nNext morning at breakfast I missed Flossie and asked where she was.\n\n'Well,' said her mother, 'when I got up this morning I found a note put\noutside my door in which--But here it is, you can read it for yourself,'\nand she gave me the slip of paper on which the following was written:--\n\n'Dearest M--,--It is just dawn, and I am off to the hills to get Mr Q--a\nbloom of the lily he wants, so don't expect me till you see me. I have\ntaken the white donkey; and nurse and a couple of boys are coming with\nme--also something to eat, as I may be away all day, for I am determined\nto get the lily if I have to go twenty miles for it.--Flossie.'\n\n\n'I hope she will be all right,' I said, a little anxiously; 'I never\nmeant her to trouble after the flower.'\n\n'Ah, Flossie can look after herself,' said her mother; 'she often goes\noff in this way like a true child of the wilderness.' But Mr Mackenzie,\nwho came in just then and saw the note for the first time, looked rather\ngrave, though he said nothing.\n\nAfter breakfast was over I took him aside and asked him whether it would\nnot be possible to send after the girl and get her back, having in view\nthe possibility of there still being some Masai hanging about, at whose\nhands she might come to harm.\n\n'I fear it would be of no use,' he answered. 'She may be fifteen miles\noff by now, and it is impossible to say what path she has taken.\nThere are the hills;' and he pointed to a long range of rising ground\nstretching almost parallel with the course followed by the river Tana,\nbut gradually sloping down to a dense bush-clad plain about five miles\nshort of the house.\n\nHere I suggested that we might get up the great tree over the house and\nsearch the country round with a spyglass; and this, after Mr Mackenzie\nhad given some orders to his people to try and follow Flossie's spoor,\nwe did.\n\nThe ascent of the mighty tree was rather an alarming performance, even\nwith a sound rope-ladder fixed at both ends to climb up, at least to a\nlandsman; but Good came up like a lamplighter.\n\nOn reaching the height at which the first fern-shaped boughs sprang\nfrom the bole, we stepped without any difficulty upon a platform made\nof boards, nailed from one bough to another, and large enough to\naccommodate a dozen people. As for the view, it was simply glorious.\nIn every direction the bush rolled away in great billows for miles and\nmiles, as far as the glass would show, only here and there broken by the\nbrighter green of patches of cultivation, or by the glittering surface\nof lakes. To the northwest, Kenia reared his mighty head, and we could\ntrace the Tana river curling like a silver snake almost from his feet,\nand far away beyond us towards the ocean. It is a glorious country, and\nonly wants the hand of civilized man to make it a most productive one.\n\nBut look as we would, we could see no signs of Flossie and her donkey,\nso at last we had to come down disappointed. On reaching the veranda I\nfound Umslopogaas sitting there, slowly and lightly sharpening his axe\nwith a small whetstone he always carried with him.\n\n'What doest thou, Umslopogaas?' I asked.\n\n'I smell blood,' was the answer; and I could get no more out of him.\n\nAfter dinner we again went up the tree and searched the surrounding\ncountry with a spyglass, but without result. When we came down\nUmslopogaas was still sharpening Inkosi-kaas, although she already had\nan edge like a razor. Standing in front of him, and regarding him with a\nmixture of fear and fascination, was Alphonse. And certainly he did seem\nan alarming object--sitting there, Zulu fashion, on his haunches, a wild\nlook upon his intensely savage and yet intellectual face, sharpening,\nsharpening, sharpening at the murderous-looking axe.\n\n'Oh, the monster, the horrible man!' said the little French cook,\nlifting his hands in amazement. 'See but the hole in his head; the skin\nbeats on it up and down like a baby's! Who would nurse such a baby?' and\nhe burst out laughing at the idea.\n\nFor a moment Umslopogaas looked up from his sharpening, and a sort of\nevil light played in his dark eyes.\n\n'What does the little \"buffalo-heifer\" [so named by Umslopogaas, on\naccount of his mustachios and feminine characteristics] say? Let him be\ncareful, or I will cut his horns. Beware, little man monkey, beware!'\n\nUnfortunately Alphonse, who was getting over his fear of him, went on\nlaughing at 'ce drole d'un monsieur noir'. I was about to warn him to\ndesist, when suddenly the huge Zulu bounded off the veranda on to the\nopen space where Alphonse was standing, his features alive with a sort\nof malicious enthusiasm, and began swinging the axe round and round over\nthe Frenchman's head.\n\n'Stand still,' I shouted; 'do not move as you value your life--he will\nnot hurt you;' but I doubt if Alphonse heard me, being, fortunately for\nhimself, almost petrified with horror.\n\nThen followed the most extraordinary display of sword, or rather of\naxemanship, that I ever saw. First of all the axe went flying round\nand round over the top of Alphonse's head, with an angry whirl and such\nextraordinary swiftness that it looked like a continuous band of steel,\never getting nearer and yet nearer to that unhappy individual's skull,\ntill at last it grazed it as it flew. Then suddenly the motion was\nchanged, and it seemed to literally flow up and down his body and limbs,\nnever more than an eighth of an inch from them, and yet never striking\nthem. It was a wonderful sight to see the little man fixed there, having\napparently realized that to move would be to run the risk of sudden\ndeath, while his black tormentor towered over him, and wrapped him round\nwith the quick flashes of the axe. For a minute or more this went\non, till suddenly I saw the moving brightness travel down the side of\nAlphonse's face, and then outwards and stop. As it did so a tuft of\nsomething black fell to the ground; it was the tip of one of the little\nFrenchman's curling mustachios.\n\nUmslopogaas leant upon the handle of Inkosi-kaas, and broke into a long,\nlow laugh; and Alphonse, overcome with fear, sank into a sitting posture\non the ground, while we stood astonished at this exhibition of almost\nsuperhuman skill and mastery of a weapon. 'Inkosi-kaas is sharp enough,'\nhe shouted; 'the blow that clipped the \"buffalo-heifer's\" horn would\nhave split a man from the crown to the chin. Few could have struck it\nbut I; none could have struck it and not taken off the shoulder too.\nLook, thou little heifer! Am I a good man to laugh at, thinkest thou?\nFor a space hast thou stood within a hair's-breadth of death. Laugh not\nagain, lest the hair's-breadth be wanting. I have spoken.'\n\n'What meanest thou by such mad tricks?' I asked of Umslopogaas,\nindignantly. 'Surely thou art mad. Twenty times didst thou go near to\nslaying the man.'\n\n'And yet, Macumazahn, I slew not. Thrice as Inkosi-kaas flew the spirit\nentered into me to end him, and send her crashing through his skull; but\nI did not. Nay, it was but a jest; but tell the \"heifer\" that it is not\nwell to mock at such as I. Now I go to make a shield, for I smell blood,\nMacumazahn--of a truth I smell blood. Before the battle hast thou not\nseen the vulture grow of a sudden in the sky? They smell the blood,\nMacumazahn, and my scent is more keen than theirs. There is a dry\nox-hide down yonder; I go to make a shield.'\n\n'That is an uncomfortable retainer of yours,' said Mr Mackenzie, who had\nwitnessed this extraordinary scene. 'He has frightened Alphonse out of\nhis wits; look!' and he pointed to the Frenchman, who, with a scared\nwhite face and trembling limbs, was making his way into the house. 'I\ndon't think that he will ever laugh at \"le monsieur noir\" again.'\n\n'Yes,' answered I, 'it is ill jesting with such as he. When he is roused\nhe is like a fiend, and yet he has a kind heart in his own fierce way.\nI remember years ago seeing him nurse a sick child for a week. He is a\nstrange character, but true as steel, and a strong stick to rest on in\ndanger.'\n\n'He says he smells blood,' said Mr Mackenzie. 'I only trust he is not\nright. I am getting very fearful about my little girl. She must have\ngone far, or she would be home by now. It is half-past three o'clock.'\n\nI pointed out that she had taken food with her, and very likely would\nnot in the ordinary course of events return till nightfall; but I myself\nfelt very anxious, and fear that my anxiety betrayed itself.\n\nShortly after this, the people whom Mr Mackenzie had sent out to search\nfor Flossie returned, stating that they had followed the spoor of the\ndonkey for a couple of miles and had then lost it on some stony ground,\nnor could they discover it again. They had, however, scoured the country\nfar and wide, but without success.\n\nAfter this the afternoon wore drearily on, and towards evening, there\nstill being no signs of Flossie, our anxiety grew very keen. As for the\npoor mother, she was quite prostrated by her fears, and no wonder, but\nthe father kept his head wonderfully well. Everything that could be done\nwas done: people were sent out in all directions, shots were fired, and\na continuous outlook kept from the great tree, but without avail.\n\nAnd then it grew dark, and still no sign of fair-haired little Flossie.\n\nAt eight o'clock we had supper. It was but a sorrowful meal, and Mrs\nMackenzie did not appear at it. We three also were very silent, for in\naddition to our natural anxiety as to the fate of the child, we were\nweighed down by the sense that we had brought this trouble on the head\nof our kind host. When supper was nearly at an end I made an excuse to\nleave the table. I wanted to get outside and think the situation over. I\nwent on to the veranda and, having lit my pipe, sat down on a seat about\na dozen feet from the right-hand end of the structure, which was, as\nthe reader may remember, exactly opposite one of the narrow doors of the\nprotecting wall that enclosed the house and flower garden. I had been\nsitting there perhaps six or seven minutes when I thought I heard the\ndoor move. I looked in that direction and I listened, but, being unable\nto make out anything, concluded that I must have been mistaken. It was a\ndarkish night, the moon not having yet risen.\n\nAnother minute passed, when suddenly something round fell with a soft\nbut heavy thud upon the stone flooring of the veranda, and came\nbounding and rolling along past me. For a moment I did not rise, but sat\nwondering what it could be. Finally, I concluded it must have been an\nanimal. Just then, however, another idea struck me, and I got up quick\nenough. The thing lay quite still a few feet beyond me. I put down my\nhand towards it and it did not move: clearly it was not an animal. My\nhand touched it. It was soft and warm and heavy. Hurriedly I lifted it\nand held it up against the faint starlight.\n\n_It was a newly severed human head!_\n\nI am an old hand and not easily upset, but I own that that ghastly sight\nmade me feel sick. How had the thing come there? Whose was it? I put it\ndown and ran to the little doorway. I could see nothing, hear nobody. I\nwas about to go out into the darkness beyond, but remembering that to do\nso was to expose myself to the risk of being stabbed, I drew back,\nshut the door, and bolted it. Then I returned to the veranda, and in as\ncareless a voice as I could command called Curtis. I fear, however, that\nmy tones must have betrayed me, for not only Sir Henry but also Good and\nMackenzie rose from the table and came hurrying out.\n\n'What is it?' said the clergyman, anxiously.\n\nThen I had to tell them.\n\nMr Mackenzie turned pale as death under his red skin. We were standing\nopposite the hall door, and there was a light in it so that I could see.\nHe snatched the head up by the hair and held it against the light.\n\n'It is the head of one of the men who accompanied Flossie,' he said with\na gasp. 'Thank God it is not hers!'\n\nWe all stood and stared at each other aghast. What was to be done?\n\nJust then there was a knocking at the door that I had bolted, and a\nvoice cried, 'Open, my father, open!'\n\nThe door was unlocked, and in sped a terrified man. He was one of the\nspies who had been sent out.\n\n'My father,' he cried, 'the Masai are on us! A great body of them have\npassed round the hill and are moving towards the old stone kraal down\nby the little stream. My father, make strong thy heart! In the midst\nof them I saw the white ass, and on it sat the Water-lily [Flossie]. An\nElmoran [young warrior] led the ass, and by its side walked the nurse\nweeping. The men who went with her in the morning I saw not.'\n\n'Was the child alive?' asked Mr Mackenzie, hoarsely.\n\n'She was white as the snow, but well, my father. They passed quite close\nto me, and looking up from where I lay hid I saw her face against the\nsky.'\n\n'God help her and us!' groaned the clergyman.\n\n'How many are there of them?' I asked.\n\n'More than two hundred--two hundred and half a hundred.'\n\nOnce more we looked one on the other. What was to be done? Just then\nthere rose a loud insistent cry outside the wall.\n\n'Open the door, white man; open the door! A herald--a herald to speak\nwith thee.' Thus cried the voice.\n\nUmslopogaas ran to the wall, and, reaching with his long arms to the\ncoping, lifted his head above it and gazed over.\n\n'I see but one man,' he said. 'He is armed, and carries a basket in his\nhand.'\n\n'Open the door,' I said. 'Umslopogaas, take thine axe and stand thereby.\nLet one man pass. If another follows, slay.'\n\nThe door was unbarred. In the shadow of the wall stood Umslopogaas, his\naxe raised above his head to strike. Just then the moon came out. There\nwas a moment's pause, and then in stalked a Masai Elmoran, clad in the\nfull war panoply that I have already described, but bearing a large\nbasket in his hand. The moonlight shone bright upon his great spear\nas he walked. He was physically a splendid man, apparently about\nthirty-five years of age. Indeed, none of the Masai that I saw were\nunder six feet high, though mostly quite young. When he got opposite to\nus he halted, put down the basket, and stuck the spike of his spear into\nthe ground, so that it stood upright.\n\n'Let us talk,' he said. 'The first messenger we sent to you could not\ntalk;' and he pointed to the head which lay upon the paving of the\nstoep--a ghastly sight in the moonlight; 'but I have words to speak\nif ye have ears to hear. Also I bring presents;' and he pointed to the\nbasket and laughed with an air of swaggering insolence that is perfectly\nindescribable, and yet which one could not but admire, seeing that he\nwas surrounded by enemies.\n\n'Say on,' said Mr Mackenzie.\n\n'I am the \"Lygonani\" [war captain] of a party of the Masai of the Guasa\nAmboni. I and my men followed these three white men,' and he pointed\nto Sir Henry, Good, and myself, 'but they were too clever for us, and\nescaped hither. We have a quarrel with them, and are going to kill\nthem.'\n\n'Are you, my friend?' said I to myself.\n\n'In following these men we this morning caught two black men, one\nblack woman, a white donkey, and a white girl. One of the black men we\nkilled--there is his head upon the pavement; the other ran away. The\nblack woman, the little white girl, and the white ass we took and\nbrought with us. In proof thereof have I brought this basket that she\ncarried. Is it not thy daughter's basket?'\n\nMr Mackenzie nodded, and the warrior went on.\n\n'Good! With thee and thy daughter we have no quarrel, nor do we wish to\nharm thee, save as to thy cattle, which we have already gathered, two\nhundred and forty head--a beast for every man's father.' {Endnote 6}\n\nHere Mr Mackenzie gave a groan, as he greatly valued this herd of\ncattle, which he bred with much care and trouble.\n\n'So, save for the cattle, thou mayst go free; more especially,' he added\nfrankly, glancing at the wall, 'as this place would be a difficult one\nto take. But as to these men it is otherwise; we have followed them\nfor nights and days, and must kill them. Were we to return to our kraal\nwithout having done so, all the girls would make a mock of us. So,\nhowever troublesome it may be, they must die.\n\n'Now I have a proposition for thee. We would not harm the little girl;\nshe is too fair to harm, and has besides a brave spirit. Give us one of\nthese three men--a life for a life--and we will let her go, and throw in\nthe black woman with her also. This is a fair offer, white man. We ask\nbut for one, not for the three; we must take another opportunity to kill\nthe other two. I do not even pick my man, though I should prefer the\nbig one,' pointing to Sir Henry; 'he looks strong, and would die more\nslowly.'\n\n'And if I say I will not yield the man?' said Mr Mackenzie.\n\n'Nay, say not so, white man,' answered the Masai, 'for then thy daughter\ndies at dawn, and the woman with her says thou hast no other child. Were\nshe older I would take her for a servant; but as she is so young I will\nslay her with my own hand--ay, with this very spear. Thou canst come and\nsee, an' thou wilt. I give thee a safe conduct;' and the fiend laughed\naloud as his brutal jest.\n\nMeanwhile I had been thinking rapidly, as one does in emergencies, and\nhad come to the conclusion that I would exchange myself against\nFlossie. I scarcely like to mention the matter for fear it should be\nmisunderstood. Pray do not let any one be misled into thinking that\nthere was anything heroic about this, or any such nonsense. It was\nmerely a matter of common sense and common justice. My life was an old\nand worthless one, hers was young and valuable. Her death would pretty\nwell kill her father and mother also, whilst nobody would be much the\nworse for mine; indeed, several charitable institutions would have cause\nto rejoice thereat. It was indirectly through me that the dear little\ngirl was in her present position. Lastly, a man was better fitted to\nmeet death in such a peculiarly awful form than a sweet young girl. Not,\nhowever, that I meant to let these gentry torture me to death--I am far\ntoo much of a coward to allow that, being naturally a timid man; my plan\nwas to see the girl safely exchanged and then to shoot myself, trusting\nthat the Almighty would take the peculiar circumstances of the case into\nconsideration and pardon the act. All this and more went through my mind\nin very few seconds.\n\n'All right, Mackenzie,' I said, 'you can tell the man that I will\nexchange myself against Flossie, only I stipulate that she shall be\nsafely in this house before they kill me.'\n\n'Eh?' said Sir Henry and Good simultaneously. 'That you don't.'\n\n'No, no,' said Mr Mackenzie. 'I will have no man's blood upon my hands.\nIf it please God that my daughter should die this awful death, His will\nbe done. You are a brave man (which I am not by any means) and a noble\nman, Quatermain, but you shall not go.'\n\n'If nothing else turns up I shall go,' I said decidedly.\n\n'This is an important matter,' said Mackenzie, addressing the Lygonani,\n'and we must think it over. You shall have our answer at dawn.'\n\n'Very well, white man,' answered the savage indifferently; 'only\nremember if thy answer is late thy little white bud will never grow into\na flower, that is all, for I shall cut it with this,' and he touched the\nspear. 'I should have thought that thou wouldst play a trick and attack\nus at night, but I know from the woman with the girl that your men are\ndown at the coast, and that thou hast but twenty men here. It is not\nwise, white man,' he added with a laugh, 'to keep so small a garrison\nfor your \"boma\" [kraal]. Well, good night, and good night to you also,\nother white men, whose eyelids I shall soon close once and for all. At\ndawn thou wilt bring me word. If not, remember it shall be as I have\nsaid.' Then turning to Umslopogaas, who had all the while been standing\nbehind him and shepherding him as it were, 'Open the door for me,\nfellow, quick now.'\n\nThis was too much for the old chief's patience. For the last ten minutes\nhis lips had been, figuratively speaking, positively watering over the\nMasai Lygonani, and this he could not stand. Placing his long hand\non the Elmoran's shoulder he gripped it and gave him such a twist\nas brought him face to face with himself. Then, thrusting his fierce\ncountenance to within a few inches of the Masai's evil feather-framed\nfeatures, he said in a low growling voice:--\n\n'Seest thou me?'\n\n'Ay, fellow, I see thee.'\n\n'And seest thou this?' and he held Inkosi-kaas before his eyes.\n\n'Ay, fellow, I see the toy; what of it?'\n\n'Thou Masai dog, thou boasting windbag, thou capturer of little girls,\nwith this \"toy\" will I hew thee limb from limb. Well for thee that thou\nart a herald, or even now would I strew thy members about the grass.'\n\nThe Masai shook his great spear and laughed loud and long as he\nanswered, 'I would that thou stoodst against me man to man, and we would\nsee,' and again he turned to go still laughing.\n\n'Thou shalt stand against me man to man, be not afraid,' replied\nUmslopogaas, still in the same ominous voice. 'Thou shalt stand face\nto face with Umslopogaas, of the blood of Chaka, of the people of the\nAmazulu, a captain in the regiment of the Nkomabakosi, as many have done\nbefore, and bow thyself to Inkosi-kaas, as many have done before. Ay,\nlaugh on, laugh on! tomorrow night shall the jackals laugh as they\ncrunch thy ribs.'\n\nWhen the Lygonani had gone, one of us thought of opening the basket\nhe had brought as a proof that Flossie was really their prisoner. On\nlifting the lid it was found to contain a most lovely specimen of both\nbulb and flower of the Goya lily, which I have already described, in\nfull bloom and quite uninjured, and what was more a note in Flossie's\nchildish hand written in pencil upon a greasy piece of paper that had\nbeen used to wrap up some food in:--\n\n'Dearest Father and Mother,' ran the note, 'The Masai caught us when we\nwere coming home with the lily. I tried to escape but could not. They\nkilled Tom: the other man ran away. They have not hurt nurse and me, but\nsay that they mean to exchange us against one of Mr Quatermain's party.\n_I will have nothing of the sort_. Do not let anybody give his life\nfor me. Try and attack them at night; they are going to feast on three\nbullocks they have stolen and killed. I have my pistol, and if no\nhelp comes by dawn I will shoot myself. They shall not kill me. If so,\nremember me always, dearest father and mother. I am very frightened,\nbut I trust in God. I dare not write any more as they are beginning to\nnotice. Goodbye.--Flossie.'\n\n\nScrawled across the outside of this was 'Love to Mr Quatermain. They are\ngoing to take the basket, so he will get the lily.'\n\nWhen I read those words, written by that brave little girl in an hour\nof danger sufficiently near and horrible to have turned the brain of\na strong man, I own I wept, and once more in my heart I vowed that she\nshould not die while my life could be given to save her.\n\nThen eagerly, quickly, almost fiercely, we fell to discussing the\nsituation. Again I said that I would go, and again Mackenzie negatived\nit, and Curtis and Good, like the true men that they are, vowed that, if\nI did, they would go with me, and die back to back with me.\n\n'It is,' I said at last, 'absolutely necessary that an effort of some\nsort should be made before the morning.'\n\n'Then let us attack them with what force we can muster, and take our\nchance,' said Sir Henry.\n\n'Ay, ay,' growled Umslopogaas, in Zulu; 'spoken like a man, Incubu. What\nis there to be afraid of? Two hundred and fifty Masai, forsooth! How\nmany are we? The chief there [Mr Mackenzie] has twenty men, and thou,\nMacumazahn, hast five men, and there are also five white men--that is,\nthirty men in all--enough, enough. Listen now, Macumazahn, thou who art\nvery clever and old in war. What says the maid? These men eat and make\nmerry; let it be their funeral feast. What said the dog whom I hope to\nhew down at daybreak? That he feared no attack because we were so few.\nKnowest thou the old kraal where the men have camped? I saw it this\nmorning; it is thus:' and he drew an oval on the floor; 'here is the big\nentrance, filled up with thorn bushes, and opening on to a steep rise.\nWhy, Incubu, thou and I with axes will hold it against an hundred men\nstriving to break out! Look, now; thus shall the battle go. Just as the\nlight begins to glint upon the oxen's horns--not before, or it will be\ntoo dark, and not later, or they will be awakening and perceive us--let\nBougwan creep round with ten men to the top end of the kraal, where the\nnarrow entrance is. Let them silently slay the sentry there so that he\nmakes no sound, and stand ready. Then, Incubu, let thee and me and one\nof the Askari--the one with the broad chest--he is a brave man--creep to\nthe wide entrance that is filled with thorn bushes, and there also slay\nthe sentry, and armed with battleaxes take our stand also one on each\nside of the pathway, and one a few paces beyond to deal with such as\npass the twain at the gate. It is there that the rush will come. That\nwill leave sixteen men. Let these men be divided into two parties, with\none of which shalt thou go, Macumazahn, and with one the \"praying man\"\n[Mr Mackenzie], and, all armed with rifles, let them make their way\none to the right side of the kraal and one to the left; and when thou,\nMacumazahn, lowest like an ox, all shall open fire with the guns upon\nthe sleeping men, being very careful not to hit the little maid. Then\nshall Bougwan at the far end and his ten men raise the war-cry, and,\nspringing over the wall, put the Masai there to the sword. And it shall\nhappen that, being yet heavy with food and sleep, and bewildered by the\nfiring of the guns, the falling of men, and the spears of Bougwan, the\nsoldiers shall rise and rush like wild game towards the thorn-stopped\nentrance, and there the bullets from either side shall plough through\nthem, and there shall Incubu and the Askari and I wait for those who\nbreak across. Such is my plan, Macumazahn; if thou hast a better, name\nit.'\n\nWhen he had done, I explained to the others such portions of his\nscheme as they had failed to understand, and they all joined with me in\nexpressing the greatest admiration of the acute and skilful programme\ndevised by the old Zulu, who was indeed, in his own savage fashion,\nthe finest general I ever knew. After some discussion we determined to\naccept the scheme, as it stood, it being the only one possible under the\ncircumstances, and giving the best chance of success that such a forlorn\nhope would admit of--which, however, considering the enormous odds and\nthe character of our foe, was not very great.\n\n'Ah, old lion!' I said to Umslopogaas, 'thou knowest how to lie in wait\nas well as how to bite, where to seize as well as where to hang on.'\n\n'Ay, ay, Macumazahn,' he answered. 'For thirty years have I been a\nwarrior, and have seen many things. It will be a good fight. I smell\nblood--I tell thee, I smell blood.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI THE NIGHT WEARS ON\n\n\n\nAs may be imagined, at the very first sign of a Masai the entire\npopulation of the Mission Station had sought refuge inside the\nstout stone wall, and were now to be seen--men, women, and countless\nchildren--huddled up together in little groups, and all talking at once\nin awed tones of the awfulness of Masai manners and customs, and of the\nfate that they had to expect if those bloodthirsty savages succeeded in\ngetting over the stone wall.\n\nImmediately after we had settled upon the outline of our plan of action\nas suggested by Umslopogaas, Mr Mackenzie sent for four sharp boys of\nfrom twelve to fifteen years of age, and despatched them to various\npoints where they could keep an outlook upon the Masai camp, with others\nto report from time to time what was going on. Other lads and even women\nwere stationed at intervals along the wall in order to guard against the\npossibility of surprise.\n\nAfter this the twenty men who formed his whole available fighting force\nwere summoned by our host into the square formed by the house, and\nthere, standing by the bole of the great conifer, he earnestly addressed\nthem and our four Askari. Indeed, it formed a very impressive scene--one\nnot likely to be forgotten by anybody who witnessed it. Immediately by\nthe tree stood the angular form of Mr Mackenzie, one arm outstretched\nas he talked, and the other resting against the giant bole, his hat off,\nand his plain but kindly face clearly betraying the anguish of his mind.\nNext to him was his poor wife, who, seated on a chair, had her face\nhidden in her hand. On the other side of her was Alphonse, looking\nexceedingly uncomfortable, and behind him stood the three of us, with\nUmslopogaas' grim and towering form in the background, resting, as\nusual, on his axe. In front stood and squatted the group of armed\nmen--some with rifles in their hands, and others with spears and\nshields--following with eager attention every word that fell from the\nspeaker's lips. The white light of the moon peering in beneath the\nlofty boughs threw a strange wild glamour over the scene, whilst the\nmelancholy soughing of the night wind passing through the millions of\npine needles overhead added a sadness of its own to what was already a\nsufficiently tragic occasion.\n\n'Men,' said Mr Mackenzie, after he had put all the circumstances of the\ncase fully and clearly before them, and explained to them the proposed\nplan of our forlorn hope--'men, for years I have been a good friend to\nyou, protecting you, teaching you, guarding you and yours from harm, and\nye have prospered with me. Ye have seen my child--the Water-lily, as ye\ncall her--grow year by year, from tenderest infancy to tender childhood,\nand from childhood on towards maidenhood. She has been your children's\nplaymate, she has helped to tend you when sick, and ye have loved her.'\n\n'We have,' said a deep voice, 'and we will die to save her.'\n\n'I thank you from my heart--I thank you. Sure am I that now, in this\nhour of darkest trouble; now that her young life is like to be cut off\nby cruel and savage men--who of a truth \"know not what they do\"--ye will\nstrive your best to save her, and to save me and her mother from broken\nhearts. Think, too, of your own wives and children. If she dies, her\ndeath will be followed by an attack upon us here, and at the best, even\nif we hold our own, your houses and gardens will be destroyed, and your\ngoods and cattle swept away. I am, as ye well know, a man of peace.\nNever in all these years have I lifted my hand to shed man's blood; but\nnow I say strike, strike, in the name of God, Who bade us protect our\nlives and homes. Swear to me,' he went on with added fervour--'swear to\nme that whilst a man of you remains alive ye will strive your uttermost\nwith me and with these brave white men to save the child from a bloody\nand cruel death.'\n\n'Say no more, my father,' said the same deep voice, that belonged to\na stalwart elder of the Mission; 'we swear it. May we and ours die the\ndeath of dogs, and our bones be thrown to the jackals and the kites,\nif we break the oath! It is a fearful thing to do, my father, so few to\nstrike at so many, yet will we do it or die in the doing. We swear!'\n\n'Ay, thus say we all,' chimed in the others.\n\n'Thus say we all,' said I.\n\n'It is well,' went on Mr Mackenzie. 'Ye are true men and not broken\nreeds to lean on. And now, friends--white and black together--let us\nkneel and offer up our humble supplication to the Throne of Power,\npraying that He in the hollow of Whose hand lie all our lives, Who\ngiveth life and giveth death, may be pleased to make strong our arms\nthat we may prevail in what awaits us at the morning's light.'\n\nAnd he knelt down, an example that we all followed except Umslopogaas,\nwho still stood in the background, grimly leaning on Inkosi-kaas. The\nfierce old Zulu had no gods and worshipped nought, unless it were his\nbattleaxe.\n\n'Oh God of gods!' began the clergyman, his deep voice, tremulous with\nemotion, echoing up in the silence even to the leafy roof; 'Protector of\nthe oppressed, Refuge of those in danger, Guardian of the helpless, hear\nThou our prayer! Almighty Father, to Thee we come in supplication.\nHear Thou our prayer! Behold, one child hast Thou given us--an innocent\nchild, nurtured in Thy knowledge--and now she lies beneath the shadow of\nthe sword, in danger of a fearful death at the hands of savage men. Be\nwith her now, oh God, and comfort her! Save her, oh Heavenly Father! Oh\nGod of battle, Who teacheth our hands to war and our fingers to fight,\nin Whose strength are hid the destinies of men, be Thou with us in the\nhour of strife. When we go forth into the shadow of death, make Thou\nus strong to conquer. Breathe Thou upon our foes and scatter them;\nturn Thou their strength to water, and bring their high-blown pride to\nnought; compass us about with Thy protection; throw over us the shield\nof Thy power; forget us not now in the hour of our sore distress; help\nus now that the cruel man would dash our little ones against the stones!\nHear Thou our prayer! And for those of us who, kneeling now on earth\nin health before Thee, shall at the sunrise adore Thy Presence on\nthe Throne, hear our prayer! Make them clean, oh God; wash away their\noffences in the blood of the Lamb; and when their spirits pass, oh\nreceive Thou them into the haven of the just. Go forth, oh Father, go\nforth with us into the battle, as with the Israelites of old. Oh God of\nbattle, hear Thou our prayer!'\n\nHe ceased, and after a moment's silence we all rose, and then began our\npreparations in good earnest. As Umslopogaas said, it was time to stop\n'talking' and get to business. The men who were to form each little\nparty were carefully selected, and still more carefully and minutely\ninstructed as to what was to be done. After much consideration it was\nagreed that the ten men led by Good, whose duty it was to stampede the\ncamp, were not to carry firearms; that is, with the exception of Good\nhimself, who had a revolver as well as a short sword--the Masai 'sime'\nwhich I had taken from the body of our poor servant who was murdered\nin the canoe. We feared that if they had firearms the result of three\ncross-fires carried on at once would be that some of our own people\nwould be shot; besides, it appeared to all of us that the work they\nhad to do would best be carried out with cold steel--especially to\nUmslopogaas, who was, indeed, a great advocate of cold steel. We had\nwith us four Winchester repeating rifles, besides half a dozen Martinis.\nI armed myself with one of the repeaters--my own; an excellent weapon\nfor this kind of work, where great rapidity of fire is desirable, and\nfitted with ordinary flap-sights instead of the cumbersome sliding\nmechanism which they generally have. Mr Mackenzie took another, and the\ntwo remaining ones were given to two of his men who understood the\nuse of them and were noted shots. The Martinis and some rifles of\nMr Mackenzie's were served out, together with a plentiful supply of\nammunition, to the other natives who were to form the two parties whose\nduty it was to be to open fire from separate sides of the kraal on the\nsleeping Masai, and who were fortunately all more or less accustomed to\nthe use of a gun.\n\nAs for Umslopogaas, we know how he was armed--with an axe. It may be\nremembered that he, Sir Henry, and the strongest of the Askari were to\nhold the thorn-stopped entrance to the kraal against the anticipated\nrush of men striving to escape. Of course, for such a purpose as this\nguns were useless. Therefore Sir Henry and the Askari proceeded to arm\nthemselves in like fashion. It so happened that Mr Mackenzie had in his\nlittle store a selection of the very best and English-made hammer-backed\naxe-heads. Sir Henry selected one of these weighing about two and a half\npounds and very broad in the blade, and the Askari took another a size\nsmaller. After Umslopogaas had put an extra edge on these two\naxe-heads, we fixed them to three feet six helves, of which Mr Mackenzie\nfortunately had some in stock, made of a light but exceedingly tough\nnative wood, something like English ash, only more springy. When two\nsuitable helves had been selected with great care and the ends of the\nhafts notched to prevent the hand from slipping, the axe-heads were\nfixed on them as firmly as possible, and the weapons immersed in a\nbucket of water for half an hour. The result of this was to swell the\nwood in the socket in such a fashion that nothing short of burning would\nget it out again. When this important matter had been attended to\nby Umslopogaas, I went into my room and proceeded to open a little\ntin-lined deal case, which contained--what do you think?--nothing more\nor less than four mail shirts.\n\nIt had happened to us three on a previous journey that we had made in\nanother part of Africa to owe our lives to iron shirts of native make,\nand remembering this, I had suggested before we started on our present\nhazardous expedition that we should have some made to fit us. There\nwas a little difficulty about this, as armour-making is pretty well an\nextinct art, but they can do most things in the way of steel work in\nBirmingham if they are put to it and you will pay the price, and the\nend of it was that they turned us out the loveliest steel shirts it is\npossible to see. The workmanship was exceedingly fine, the web being\ncomposed of thousands upon thousands of stout but tiny rings of the\nbest steel made. These shirts, or rather steel-sleeved and high-necked\njerseys, were lined with ventilated wash leather, were not bright, but\nbrowned like the barrel of a gun; and mine weighed exactly seven pounds\nand fitted me so well that I found I could wear it for days next to my\nskin without being chafed. Sir Henry had two, one of the ordinary\nmake, viz. a jersey with little dependent flaps meant to afford some\nprotection to the upper part of the thighs, and another of his\nown design fashioned on the pattern of the garments advertised as\n'combinations' and weighing twelve pounds. This combination shirt, of\nwhich the seat was made of wash-leather, protected the whole body down\nto the knees, but was rather more cumbersome, inasmuch as it had to be\nlaced up at the back and, of course, involved some extra weight. With\nthese shirts were what looked like four brown cloth travelling caps with\near pieces. Each of these caps was, however, quilted with steel links so\nas to afford a most valuable protection for the head.\n\nIt seems almost laughable to talk of steel shirts in these days of\nbullets, against which they are of course quite useless; but where one\nhas to do with savages, armed with cutting weapons such as assegais or\nbattleaxes, they afford the most valuable protection, being, if well\nmade, quite invulnerable to them. I have often thought that if only the\nEnglish Government had in our savage wars, and more especially in the\nZulu war, thought fit to serve out light steel shirts, there would be\nmany a man alive today who, as it is, is dead and forgotten.\n\nTo return: on the present occasion we blessed our foresight in bringing\nthese shirts, and also our good luck, in that they had not been stolen\nby our rascally bearers when they ran away with our goods. As Curtis had\ntwo, and after considerable deliberation, had made up his mind to wear\nhis combination one himself--the extra three or four pounds' weight\nbeing a matter of no account to so strong a man, and the protection\nafforded to the thighs being a very important matter to a fighting man\nnot armed with a shield of any kind--I suggested that he should lend the\nother to Umslopogaas, who was to share the danger and the glory of his\npost. He readily consented, and called the Zulu, who came bearing Sir\nHenry's axe, which he had now fixed up to his satisfaction, with him.\nWhen we showed him the steel shirt, and explained to him that we wanted\nhim to wear it, he at first declined, saying that he had fought in his\nown skin for thirty years, and that he was not going to begin now to\nfight in an iron one. Thereupon I took a heavy spear, and, spreading the\nshirt upon the floor, drove the spear down upon it with all my strength,\nthe weapon rebounding without leaving a mark upon the tempered steel.\nThis exhibition half converted him; and when I pointed out to him how\nnecessary it was that he should not let any old-fashioned prejudices he\nmight possess stand in the way of a precaution which might preserve a\nvaluable life at a time when men were scarce, and also that if he wore\nthis shirt he might dispense with a shield, and so have both hands free,\nhe yielded at once, and proceeded to invest his frame with the 'iron\nskin'. And indeed, although made for Sir Henry, it fitted the great Zulu\nlike a skin. The two men were almost of a height; and, though Curtis\nlooked the bigger man, I am inclined to think that the difference was\nmore imaginary than real, the fact being that, although he was plumper\nand rounder, he was not really bigger, except in the arm. Umslopogaas\nhad, comparatively speaking, thin arms, but they were as strong as wire\nropes. At any rate, when they both stood, axe in hand, invested in\nthe brown mail, which clung to their mighty forms like a web garment,\nshowing the swell of every muscle and the curve of every line, they\nformed a pair that any ten men might shrink from meeting.\n\nIt was now nearly one o'clock in the morning, and the spies reported\nthat, after having drunk the blood of the oxen and eaten enormous\nquantities of meat, the Masai were going to sleep round their\nwatchfires; but that sentries had been posted at each opening of the\nkraal. Flossie, they added, was sitting not far from the wall in the\ncentre of the western side of the kraal, and by her were the nurse and\nthe white donkey, which was tethered to a peg. Her feet were bound with\na rope, and warriors were lying about all round her.\n\nAs there was absolutely nothing further that could be done then we all\ntook some supper, and went to lie down for a couple of hours. I could\nnot help admiring the way in which old Umslopogaas flung himself upon\nthe floor, and, unmindful of what was hanging over him, instantly sank\ninto a deep sleep. I do not know how it was with the others, but I could\nnot do as much. Indeed, as is usual with me on these occasions, I am\nsorry to say that I felt rather frightened; and, now that some of the\nenthusiasm had gone out of me, and I began to calmly contemplate what we\nhad undertaken to do, truth compels me to add that I did not like it.\nWe were but thirty men all told, a good many of whom were no doubt quite\nunused to fighting, and we were going to engage two hundred and fifty\nof the fiercest, bravest, and most formidable savages in Africa, who,\nto make matters worse, were protected by a stone wall. It was, indeed,\na mad undertaking, and what made it even madder was the exceeding\nimprobability of our being able to take up our positions without\nattracting the notice of the sentries. Of course if we once did\nthat--and any slight accident, such as the chance discharge of a gun,\nmight do it--we were done for, for the whole camp would be up in a\nsecond, and our only hope lay in surprise.\n\nThe bed whereon I lay indulging in these uncomfortable reflections was\nnear an open window that looked on to the veranda, through which came an\nextraordinary sound of groaning and weeping. For a time I could not make\nout what it was, but at last I got up and, putting my head out of the\nwindow, stared about. Presently I saw a dim figure kneeling on the end\nof the veranda and beating his breast--in which I recognized Alphonse.\nNot being able to understand his French talk or what on earth he was at,\nI called to him and asked him what he was doing.\n\n'Ah, monsieur,' he sighed, 'I do make prayer for the souls of those whom\nI shall slay tonight.'\n\n'Indeed,' I said, 'then I wish that you would do it a little more\nquietly.'\n\nAlphonse retreated, and I heard no more of his groans. And so the time\npassed, till at length Mr Mackenzie called me in a whisper through the\nwindow, for of course everything had now to be done in the most absolute\nsilence. 'Three o'clock,' he said: 'we must begin to move at half-past.'\n\nI told him to come in, and presently he entered, and I am bound to say\nthat if it had not been that just then I had not got a laugh anywhere\nabout me, I should have exploded at the sight he presented armed for\nbattle. To begin with, he had on a clergyman's black swallow-tail and\na kind of broad-rimmed black felt hat, both of which he had donned on\naccount, he said, of their dark colour. In his hand was the Winchester\nrepeating rifle we had lent him; and stuck in an elastic cricketing\nbelt, like those worn by English boys, were, first, a huge\nbuckhorn-handled carving knife with a guard to it, and next a\nlong-barrelled Colt's revolver.\n\n'Ah, my friend,' he said, seeing me staring at his belt, 'you are\nlooking at my \"carver\". I thought it might come in handy if we came to\nclose quarters; it is excellent steel, and many is the pig I have killed\nwith it.'\n\nBy this time everybody was up and dressing. I put on a light Norfolk\njacket over my mail shirt in order to have a pocket handy to hold my\ncartridges, and buckled on my revolver. Good did the same, but Sir Henry\nput on nothing except his mail shirt, steel-lined cap, and a pair of\n'veldt-schoons' or soft hide shoes, his legs being bare from the knees\ndown. His revolver he strapped on round his middle outside the armoured\nshirt.\n\nMeanwhile Umslopogaas was mustering the men in the square under the big\ntree and going the rounds to see that each was properly armed, etc. At\nthe last moment we made one change. Finding that two of the men who were\nto have gone with the firing parties knew little or nothing of guns,\nbut were good spearsmen, we took away their rifles, supplied them with\nshields and long spears of the Masai pattern, and took them off to join\nCurtis, Umslopogaas, and the Askari in holding the wide opening; it\nhaving become clear to us that three men, however brave and strong, were\ntoo few for the work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII A SLAUGHTER GRIM AND GREAT\n\n\n\nThen there was a pause, and we stood there in the chilly silent darkness\nwaiting till the moment came to start. It was, perhaps, the most trying\ntime of all--that slow, slow quarter of an hour. The minutes seemed\nto drag along with leaden feet, and the quiet, the solemn hush,\nthat brooded over all--big, as it were, with a coming fate, was most\noppressive to the spirits. I once remember having to get up before\ndawn to see a man hanged, and I then went through a very similar set of\nsensations, only in the present instance my feelings were animated by\nthat more vivid and personal element which naturally appertains rather\nto the person to be operated on than to the most sympathetic spectator.\nThe solemn faces of the men, well aware that the short passage of\nan hour would mean for some, and perhaps all of them, the last great\npassage to the unknown or oblivion; the bated whispers in which they\nspoke; even Sir Henry's continuous and thoughtful examination of his\nwoodcutter's axe and the fidgety way in which Good kept polishing his\neyeglass, all told the same tale of nerves stretched pretty nigh to\nbreaking-point. Only Umslopogaas, leaning as usual upon Inkosi-kaas and\ntaking an occasional pinch of snuff, was to all appearance perfectly and\ncompletely unmoved. Nothing could touch his iron nerves.\n\nThe moon went down. For a long while she had been getting nearer and\nnearer to the horizon. Now she finally sank and left the world in\ndarkness save for a faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely\nheralded the dawn.\n\nMr Mackenzie stood, watch in hand, his wife clinging to his arm and\nstriving to stifle her sobs.\n\n'Twenty minutes to four,' he said, 'it ought to be light enough to\nattack at twenty minutes past four. Captain Good had better be moving,\nhe will want three or four minutes' start.'\n\nGood gave one final polish to his eyeglass, nodded to us in a jocular\nsort of way--which I could not help feeling it must have cost him\nsomething to muster up--and, ever polite, took off his steel-lined cap\nto Mrs Mackenzie and started for his position at the head of the kraal,\nto reach which he had to make a detour by some paths known to the\nnatives.\n\nJust then one of the boys came in and reported that everybody in the\nMasai camp, with the exception of the two sentries who were walking\nup and down in front of the respective entrances, appeared to be fast\nasleep. Then the rest of us took the road. First came the guide, then\nSir Henry, Umslopogaas, the Wakwafi Askari, and Mr Mackenzie's\ntwo mission natives armed with long spears and shields. I followed\nimmediately after with Alphonse and five natives all armed with guns,\nand Mr Mackenzie brought up the rear with the six remaining natives.\n\nThe cattle kraal where the Masai were camped lay at the foot of the\nhill on which the house stood, or, roughly speaking, about eight hundred\nyards from the Mission buildings. The first five hundred yards of this\ndistance we traversed quietly indeed, but at a good pace; after that we\ncrept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey, gliding like ghosts\nfrom bush to bush and stone to stone. When I had gone a little way I\nchanced to look behind me, and saw the redoubtable Alphonse staggering\nalong with white face and trembling knees, and his rifle, which was at\nfull cock, pointed directly at the small of my back. Having halted and\ncarefully put the rifle at 'safety', we started again, and all went well\ntill we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal, when his teeth\nbegan to chatter in the most aggressive way.\n\n'If you don't stop that I will kill you,' I whispered savagely; for the\nidea of having all our lives sacrificed to a tooth-chattering cook was\ntoo much for me. I began to fear that he would betray us, and heartily\nwished we had left him behind.\n\n'But, monsieur, I cannot help it,' he answered, 'it is the cold.'\n\nHere was a dilemma, but fortunately I devised a plan. In the pocket of\nthe coat I had on was a small piece of dirty rag that I had used some\ntime before to clean a gun with. 'Put this in your mouth,' I whispered\nagain, giving him the rag; 'and if I hear another sound you are a dead\nman.' I knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth. I must\nhave looked as if I meant what I said, for he instantly obeyed me, and\ncontinued his journey in silence.\n\nThen we crept on again.\n\nAt last we were within fifty yards of the kraal. Between us and it was\nan open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of\ntussocks of a sort of thistle for cover. We were still hidden in fairly\nthick bush. It was beginning to grow light. The stars had paled and a\nsickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth. We\ncould see the outline of the kraal clearly enough, and could also make\nout the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the Masai camp-fires. We\nhalted and watched, for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening.\nPresently he appeared, a fine tall fellow, walking idly up and down\nwithin five paces of the thorn-stopped entrance. We had hoped to catch\nhim napping, but it was not to be. He seemed particularly wide awake. If\nwe could not kill that man, and kill him silently, we were lost. There\nwe crouched and watched him. Presently Umslopogaas, who was a few paces\nahead of me, turned and made a sign, and next second I saw him go\ndown on his stomach like a snake, and, taking an opportunity when\nthe sentry's head was turned, begin to work his way through the grass\nwithout a sound.\n\nThe unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune, and Umslopogaas\ncrept on. He reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and\nthere waited. Still the sentry walked up and down. Presently he turned\nand looked over the wall into the camp. Instantly the human snake who\nwas stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks\nof the thistle-like plant, reaching it as the Elmoran turned again. As\nhe did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles, and it seemed to\nstrike him that it did not look quite right. He advanced a pace towards\nit--halted, yawned, stooped down, picked up a little pebble and threw\nit at it. It hit Umslopogaas upon the head, luckily not upon the armour\nshirt. Had it done so the clink would have betrayed us. Luckily, too,\nthe shirt was browned and not bright steel, which would certainly have\nbeen detected. Apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong, he\nthen gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning\non his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft. For at least three\nminutes did he stand thus, plunged apparently in a gentle reverie, and\nthere we lay in the last extremity of anxiety, expecting every moment\nthat we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would\nhappen. I could hear Alphonse's teeth going like anything on the oiled\nrag, and turning my head round made an awful face at him. But I am bound\nto state that my own heart was at much the same game as the Frenchman's\ncastanets, while the perspiration was pouring from my body, causing the\nwash-leather-lined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly, and altogether I\nwas in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a 'blue fright'.\n\nAt last the ordeal came to an end. The sentry glanced at the east, and\nappeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to\nan end--as indeed it was, once and for all--for he rubbed his hands and\nbegan to walk again briskly to warm himself.\n\nThe moment his back was turned the long black snake glided on again, and\nreached the other thistle tuft, which was within a couple of paces of\nhis return beat.\n\nBack came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft, utterly\nunconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it. Had he looked\ndown he could scarcely have failed to see, but he did not do so.\n\nHe passed, and then his hidden enemy erected himself, and with\noutstretched hand followed in his tracks.\n\nA moment more, and, just as the Elmoran was about to turn, the great\nZulu made a spring, and in the growing light we could see his long lean\nhands close round the Masai's throat. Then followed a convulsive twining\nof the two dark bodies, and in another second I saw the Masai's head\nbent back, and heard a sharp crack, something like that of a dry\ntwig snapping, and he fell down upon the ground, his limbs moving\nspasmodically.\n\nUmslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warrior's\nneck.\n\nFor a moment he knelt upon his victim, still gripping his throat till he\nwas sure that there was nothing more to fear from him, and then he rose\nand beckoned to us to advance, which we did on all fours, like a colony\nof huge apes. On reaching the kraal we saw that the Masai had still\nfurther choked this entrance, which was about ten feet wide--no doubt in\norder to guard against attack--by dragging four or five tops of mimosa\ntrees up to it. So much the better for us, I reflected; the more\nobstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through.\nHere we separated; Mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow\nof the wall to the left, while Sir Henry and Umslopogaas took their\nstations one on each side of the thorn fence, the two spearmen and the\nAskari lying down in front of it. I and my men crept on up the right\nside of the kraal, which was about fifty paces long.\n\nWhen I was two-thirds up I halted, and placed my men at distances of\nfour paces from one another, keeping Alphonse close to me, however. Then\nI peeped for the first time over the wall. It was getting fairly light\nnow, and the first thing I saw was the white donkey, exactly opposite\nto me, and close by it I could make out the pale face of little Flossie,\nwho was sitting as the lad had described, some ten paces from the wall.\nRound her lay many warriors, sleeping. At distances all over the surface\nof the kraal were the remains of fires, round each of which slept some\nfive-and-twenty Masai, for the most part gorged with food. Now and then\na man would raise himself, yawn, and look at the east, which was turning\nprimrose; but none got up. I determined to wait another five minutes,\nboth to allow the light to increase, so that we could make better\nshooting, and to give Good and his party--of whom we could see or hear\nnothing--every opportunity to make ready.\n\nThe quiet dawn began to throw her ever-widening mantle over plain and\nforest and river--mighty Kenia, wrapped in the silence of eternal snows,\nlooked out across the earth--till presently a beam from the unrisen sun\nlit upon his heaven-kissing crest and purpled it with blood; the sky\nabove grew blue, and tender as a mother's smile; a bird began to pipe\nhis morning song, and a little breeze passing through the bush shook\ndown the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world. Everywhere\nwas peace and the happiness of arising strength, everywhere save in the\nheart of cruel man!\n\nSuddenly, just as I was nerving myself for the signal, having already\nselected my man on whom I meant to open fire--a great fellow sprawling\non the ground within three feet of little Flossie--Alphonse's teeth\nbegan to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe, making a\ngreat noise in the silence. The rag had dropped out in the agitation of\nhis mind. Instantly a Masai within three paces of us woke, and, sitting\nup, gazed about him, looking for the cause of the sound. Moved beyond\nmyself, I brought the butt-end of my rifle down on to the pit of the\nFrenchman's stomach. This stopped his chattering; but, as he doubled up,\nhe managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed\nwithin an inch of my head.\n\nThere was no need for a signal now. From both sides of the kraal broke\nout a waving line of fire, in which I myself joined, managing with a\nsnap shot to knock over my Masai by Flossie, just as he was jumping up.\nThen from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell, in which\nI rejoiced to recognize Good's piercing notes rising clear and shrill\nabove the din, and in another second followed such a scene as I have\nnever seen before nor shall again. With an universal howl of terror and\nfury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet,\nmany of them to fall again beneath our well-directed hail of lead before\nthey had moved a yard. For a moment they stood undecided, and then\nhearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end\nof the kraal, and bewildered by the storm of bullets, they as by one\nimpulse rushed down towards the thorn-stopped entrance. As they went we\nkept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as\nfast as we could load. I had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it\ncontained and was just beginning to slip in some more when I bethought\nme of little Flossie. Looking up, I saw that the white donkey was lying\nkicking, having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a\nMasai spear-thrust. There were no living Masai near, but the black nurse\nwas on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound Flossie's\nfeet. Next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb\nover it, an example which the little girl followed. But Flossie was\nevidently very stiff and cramped, and could only go slowly, and as she\nwent two Masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed\ntowards her to kill her. The first fellow came up just as the poor\nlittle girl, after a desperate effort to climb the wall, fell back into\nthe kraal. Up flashed the great spear, and as it did so a bullet from my\nrifle found its home in the holder's ribs, and over he went like a shot\nrabbit. But behind him was the other man, and, alas, I had only that\none cartridge in the magazine! Flossie had scrambled to her feet and was\nfacing the second man, who was advancing with raised spear. I turned my\nhead aside and felt sick as death. I could not bear to see him stab her.\nGlancing up again, to my surprise I saw the Masai's spear lying on the\nground, while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to\nhis head. Suddenly I saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from\nFlossie, and the man fell down headlong. Then I remembered the Derringer\npistol she carried, and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at\nhim, thereby saving her life. In another instant she had made an effort,\nand assisted by the nurse, who was lying on the top, had scrambled over\nthe wall, and I knew that she was, comparatively speaking, safe.\n\nAll this takes time to tell, but I do not suppose that it took more than\nfifteen seconds to enact. I soon got the magazine of the repeater filled\nagain with cartridges, and once more opened fire, not on the seething\nblack mass which was gathering at the end of the kraal, but on fugitives\nwho bethought them to climb the wall. I picked off several of these men,\nmoving down towards the end of the kraal as I did so, and arriving at\nthe corner, or rather the bend of the oval, in time to see, and by means\nof my rifle to assist in, the mighty struggle that took place there.\n\nBy this time some two hundred Masai--allowing that we had up to the\npresent accounted for fifty--had gathered together in front of the\nthorn-stopped entrance, driven thither by the spears of Good's men,\nwhom they doubtless supposed were a large force instead of being but ten\nstrong. For some reason it never occurred to them to try and rush the\nwall, which they could have scrambled over with comparative ease;\nthey all made for the fence, which was really a strongly interwoven\nfortification. With a bound the first warrior went at it, and even\nbefore he touched the ground on the other side I saw Sir Henry's great\naxe swing up and fall with awful force upon his feather head-piece, and\nhe sank into the middle of the thorns. Then with a yell and a crash they\nbegan to break through as they might, and ever as they came the great\naxe swung and Inkosi-kaas flashed and they fell dead one by one, each\nman thus helping to build up a barrier against his fellows. Those who\nescaped the axes of the pair fell at the hands of the Askari and the two\nMission Kaffirs, and those who passed scatheless from them were brought\nlow by my own and Mackenzie's fire.\n\nFaster and more furious grew the fighting. Single Masai would spring\nupon the dead bodies of their comrades, and engage one or other of the\naxemen with their long spears; but, thanks chiefly to the mail shirts,\nthe result was always the same. Presently there was a great swing of the\naxe, a crashing sound, and another dead Masai. That is, if the man was\nengaged with Sir Henry. If it was Umslopogaas that he fought with the\nresult indeed would be the same, but it would be differently attained.\nIt was but rarely that the Zulu used the crashing double-handed\nstroke; on the contrary, he did little more than tap continually at his\nadversary's head, pecking at it with the pole-axe end of the axe as a\nwoodpecker {Endnote 7} pecks at rotten wood. Presently a peck would go\nhome, and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole\nin his forehead or skull, exactly similar to that which a cheese-scoop\nmakes in a cheese. He never used the broad blade of the axe except when\nhard pressed, or when striking at a shield. He told me afterwards that\nhe did not consider it sportsmanlike.\n\nGood and his men were quite close by now, and our people had to cease\nfiring into the mass for fear of killing some of them (as it was, one of\nthem was slain in this way). Mad and desperate with fear, the Masai by\na frantic effort burst through the thorn fence and piled-up dead, and,\nsweeping Curtis, Umslopogaas, and the other three before them, into the\nopen. And now it was that we began to lose men fast. Down went our poor\nAskari who was armed with the axe, a great spear standing out a foot\nbehind his back; and before long the two spearsmen who had stood with\nhim went down too, dying fighting like tigers; and others of our party\nshared their fate. For a moment I feared the fight was lost--certainly\nit trembled in the balance. I shouted to my men to cast down their\nrifles, and to take spears and throw themselves into the melee. They\nobeyed, their blood being now thoroughly up, and Mr Mackenzie's people\nfollowed their example.\n\nThis move had a momentary good result, but still the fight hung in the\nbalance.\n\nOur people fought magnificently, hurling themselves upon the dark mass\nof Elmoran, hewing, thrusting, slaying, and being slain. And ever\nabove the din rose Good's awful yell of encouragement as he plunged to\nwherever the fight was thickest; and ever, with an almost machine-like\nregularity, the two axes rose and fell, carrying death and disablement\nat every stroke. But I could see that the strain was beginning to tell\nupon Sir Henry, who was bleeding from several flesh wounds: his breath\nwas coming in gasps, and the veins stood out on his forehead like blue\nand knotted cords. Even Umslopogaas, man of iron that he was, was hard\npressed. I noticed that he had given up 'woodpecking', and was now using\nthe broad blade of Inkosi-kaas, 'browning' his enemy wherever he could\nhit him, instead of drilling scientific holes in his head. I myself did\nnot go into the melee, but hovered outside like the swift 'back' in a\nfootball scrimmage, putting a bullet through a Masai whenever I got a\nchance. I was more use so. I fired forty-nine cartridges that morning,\nand I did not miss many shots.\n\nPresently, do as we would, the beam of the balance began to rise against\nus. We had not more than fifteen or sixteen effectives left now, and the\nMasai had at least fifty. Of course if they had kept their heads, and\nshaken themselves together, they could soon have made an end of the\nmatter; but that is just what they did not do, not having yet recovered\nfrom their start, and some of them having actually fled from their\nsleeping-places without their weapons. Still by now many individuals\nwere fighting with their normal courage and discretion, and this alone\nwas sufficient to defeat us. To make matters worse just then, when\nMackenzie's rifle was empty, a brawny savage armed with a 'sime',\nor sword, made a rush for him. The clergyman flung down his gun, and\ndrawing his huge carver from his elastic belt (his revolver had dropped\nout in the fight), they closed in desperate struggle. Presently, locked\nin a close embrace, missionary and Masai rolled on the ground behind the\nwall, and for some time I, being amply occupied with my own affairs, and\nin keeping my skin from being pricked, remained in ignorance of his fate\nor how the duel had ended.\n\nTo and fro surged the fight, slowly turning round like the vortex of\na human whirlpool, and the matter began to look very bad for us. Just\nthen, however, a fortunate thing happened. Umslopogaas, either by\naccident or design, broke out of the ring and engaged a warrior at some\nfew paces from it. As he did so, another man ran up and struck him with\nall his force between his shoulders with his great spear, which, falling\non the tough steel shirt, failed to pierce it and rebounded. For a\nmoment the man stared aghast--protective armour being unknown among\nthese tribes--and then he yelled out at the top of his voice--\n\n'_They are devils--bewitched, bewitched!_' And seized by a sudden panic,\nhe threw down his spear, and began to fly. I cut short his career with\na bullet, and Umslopogaas brained his man, and then the panic spread to\nthe others.\n\n'_Bewitched, bewitched!_' they cried, and tried to escape in every\ndirection, utterly demoralized and broken-spirited, for the most part\neven throwing down their shields and spears.\n\nOn the last scene of that dreadful fight I need not dwell. It was a\nslaughter great and grim, in which no quarter was asked or given. One\nincident, however, is worth detailing. Just as I was hoping that it was\nall done with, suddenly from under a heap of slain where he had been\nhiding, an unwounded warrior sprang up, and, clearing the piles of dying\ndead like an antelope, sped like the wind up the kraal towards the\nspot where I was standing at the moment. But he was not alone, for\nUmslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallow-like\nmotion for which he was noted, and as they neared me I recognized in the\nMasai the herald of the previous night. Finding that, run as he would,\nhis pursuer was gaining on him, the man halted and turned round to give\nbattle. Umslopogaas also pulled up.\n\n'Ah, ah,' he cried, in mockery, to the Elmoran, 'it is thou whom I\ntalked with last night--the Lygonani! the Herald! the capturer of little\ngirls--he who would kill a little girl! And thou didst hope to stand man\nto man and face to face with Umslopogaas, an Induna of the tribe of\nthe Maquilisini, of the people of the Amazulu? Behold, thy prayer is\ngranted! And I didst swear to hew thee limb from limb, thou insolent\ndog. Behold, I will do it even now!'\n\nThe Masai ground his teeth with fury, and charged at the Zulu with\nhis spear. As he came, Umslopogaas deftly stepped aside, and swinging\nInkosi-kaas high above his head with both hands, brought the broad blade\ndown with such fearful force from behind upon the Masai's shoulder just\nwhere the neck is set into the frame, that its razor edge shore right\nthrough bone and flesh and muscle, almost severing the head and one arm\nfrom the body.\n\n'_Ou!_' ejaculated Umslopogaas, contemplating the corpse of his foe; 'I\nhave kept my word. It was a good stroke.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII  ALPHONSE EXPLAINS\n\n\nAnd so the fight was ended. On returning from the shocking scene it\nsuddenly struck me that I had seen nothing of Alphonse since the moment,\nsome twenty minutes before--for though this fight has taken a long while\nto describe, it did not take long in reality--when I had been forced\nto hit him in the wind with the result of nearly getting myself shot.\nFearing that the poor little man had perished in the battle, I began to\nhunt among the dead for his body, but, not being able either to see or\nhear anything of it, I concluded that he must have survived, and walked\ndown the side of the kraal where we had first taken our stand, calling\nhim by name. Now some fifteen paces back from the kraal wall stood a\nvery ancient tree of the banyan species. So ancient was it that all the\ninside had in the course of ages decayed away, leaving nothing but a\nshell of bark.\n\n'Alphonse,' I called, as I walked down the wall. 'Alphonse!'\n\n'Oui, monsieur,' answered a voice. 'Here am I.'\n\nI looked round but could see nobody. 'Where?' I cried.\n\n'Here am I, monsieur, in the tree.'\n\nI looked, and there, peering out of a hole in the trunk of the banyan\nabout five feet from the ground, I saw a pale face and a pair of large\nmustachios, one clipped short and the other as lamentably out of curl\nas the tail of a newly whipped pug. Then, for the first time, I realized\nwhat I had suspected before--namely, that Alphonse was an arrant coward.\nI walked up to him. 'Come out of that hole,' I said.\n\n'Is it finished, monsieur?' he asked anxiously; 'quite finished? Ah, the\nhorrors I have undergone, and the prayers I have uttered!'\n\n'Come out, you little wretch,' I said, for I did not feel amiable; 'it\nis all over.'\n\n'So, monsieur, then my prayers have prevailed? I emerge,' and he did.\n\nAs we were walking down together to join the others, who were gathered\nin a group by the wide entrance to the kraal, which now resembled a\nveritable charnel-house, a Masai, who had escaped so far and been hiding\nunder a bush, suddenly sprang up and charged furiously at us. Off went\nAlphonse with a howl of terror, and after him flew the Masai, bent upon\ndoing some execution before he died. He soon overtook the poor little\nFrenchman, and would have finished him then and there had I not, just\nas Alphonse made a last agonized double in the vain hope of avoiding the\nyard of steel that was flashing in his immediate rear, managed to plant\na bullet between the Elmoran's broad shoulders, which brought matters\nto a satisfactory conclusion so far as the Frenchman was concerned. But\njust then he tripped and fell flat, and the body of the Masai fell right\non the top of him, moving convulsively in the death struggle. Thereupon\nthere arose such a series of piercing howls that I concluded that before\nhe died the savage must have managed to stab poor Alphonse. I ran up\nin a hurry and pulled the Masai off, and there beneath him lay Alphonse\ncovered with blood and jerking himself about like a galvanized frog.\nPoor fellow! thought I, he is done for, and kneeling down by him I began\nto search for his wound as well as his struggles would allow.\n\n'Oh, the hole in my back!' he yelled. 'I am murdered. I am dead. Oh,\nAnnette!'\n\nI searched again, but could see no wound. Then the truth dawned on\nme--the man was frightened, not hurt.\n\n'Get up!' I shouted, 'Get up. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You are\nnot touched.'\n\nThereupon he rose, not a penny the worse. 'But, monsieur, I thought I\nwas,' he said apologetically; 'I did not know that I had conquered.'\nThen, giving the body of the Masai a kick, he ejaculated triumphantly,\n'Ah, dog of a black savage, thou art dead; what victory!'\n\nThoroughly disgusted, I left Alphonse to look after himself, which he\ndid by following me like a shadow, and proceeded to join the others by\nthe large entrance. The first thing that I saw was Mackenzie, seated on\na stone with a handkerchief twisted round his thigh, from which he was\nbleeding freely, having, indeed, received a spear-thrust that passed\nright through it, and still holding in his hand his favourite carving\nknife now bent nearly double, from which I gathered that he had been\nsuccessful in his rough and tumble with the Elmoran.\n\n'Ah, Quatermain!' he sang out in a trembling, excited voice, 'so we have\nconquered; but it is a sorry sight, a sorry sight;' and then breaking\ninto broad Scotch and glancing at the bent knife in his hand, 'It fashes\nme sair to have bent my best carver on the breastbone of a savage,' and\nhe laughed hysterically. Poor fellow, what between his wound and the\nkilling excitement he had undergone his nerves were much shaken, and\nno wonder! It is hard upon a man of peace and kindly heart to be called\nupon to join in such a gruesome business. But there, fate puts us\nsometimes into very comical positions!\n\nAt the kraal entrance the scene was a strange one. The slaughter was\nover by now, and the wounded men had been put out of their pain, for no\nquarter had been given. The bush-closed entrance was trampled flat, and\nin place of bushes it was filled with the bodies of dead men. Dead men,\neverywhere dead men--they lay about in knots, they were flung by ones\nand twos in every position upon the open spaces, for all the world like\nthe people on the grass in one of the London parks on a particularly hot\nSunday in August. In front of this entrance, on a space which had been\ncleared of dead and of the shields and spears which were scattered in\nall directions as they had fallen or been thrown from the hands of their\nowners, stood and lay the survivors of the awful struggle, and at their\nfeet were four wounded men. We had gone into the fight thirty strong,\nand of the thirty but fifteen remained alive, and five of them\n(including Mr Mackenzie) were wounded, two mortally. Of those who held\nthe entrance, Curtis and the Zulu alone remained. Good had lost five men\nkilled, I had lost two killed, and Mackenzie no less than five out of\nthe six with him. As for the survivors they were, with the exception of\nmyself who had never come to close quarters, red from head to foot--Sir\nHenry's armour might have been painted that colour--and utterly\nexhausted, except Umslopogaas, who, as he grimly stood on a little\nmound above a heap of dead, leaning as usual upon his axe, did not seem\nparticularly distressed, although the skin over the hole in his head\npalpitated violently.\n\n'Ah, Macumazahn!' he said to me as I limped up, feeling very sick, 'I\ntold thee that it would be a good fight, and it has. Never have I seen a\nbetter, or one more bravely fought. As for this iron shirt, surely it is\n\"tagati\" [bewitched]; nothing could pierce it. Had it not been for the\ngarment I should have been _there_,' and he nodded towards the great\npile of dead men beneath him.\n\n'I give it thee; thou art a brave man,' said Sir Henry, briefly.\n\n'Koos!' answered the Zulu, deeply pleased both at the gift and the\ncompliment. 'Thou, too, Incubu, didst bear thyself as a man, but I must\ngive thee some lessons with the axe; thou dost waste thy strength.'\n\nJust then Mackenzie asked about Flossie, and we were all greatly\nrelieved when one of the men said he had seen her flying towards the\nhouse with the nurse. Then bearing such of the wounded as could be moved\nat the moment with us, we slowly made our way towards the Mission-house,\nspent with toil and bloodshed, but with the glorious sense of victory\nagainst overwhelming odds glowing in our hearts. We had saved the life\nof the little maid, and taught the Masai of those parts a lesson that\nthey will not forget for ten years--but at what a cost!\n\nPainfully we made our way up the hill which, just a little more than an\nhour before, we had descended under such different circumstances. At the\ngate of the wall stood Mrs Mackenzie waiting for us. When her eyes fell\nupon us, however, she shrieked out, and covered her face with her\nhands, crying, 'Horrible, horrible!' Nor were her fears allayed when she\ndiscovered her worthy husband being borne upon an improvized stretcher;\nbut her doubts as to the nature of his injury were soon set at rest.\nThen when in a few brief words I had told her the upshot of the struggle\n(of which Flossie, who had arrived in safety, had been able to explain\nsomething) she came up to me and solemnly kissed me on the forehead.\n\n'God bless you all, Mr Quatermain; you have saved my child's life,' she\nsaid simply.\n\nThen we went in and got our clothes off and doctored our wounds; I am\nglad to say I had none, and Sir Henry's and Good's were, thanks to those\ninvaluable chain shirts, of a comparatively harmless nature, and to be\ndealt with by means of a few stitches and sticking-plaster. Mackenzie's,\nhowever, were serious, though fortunately the spear had not severed any\nlarge artery. After that we had a bath, and what a luxury it was! And\nhaving clad ourselves in ordinary clothes, proceeded to the dining-room,\nwhere breakfast was set as usual. It was curious sitting down there,\ndrinking tea and eating toast in an ordinary nineteenth-century sort\nof way just as though we had not employed the early hours in a regular\nprimitive hand-to-hand Middle-Ages kind of struggle. As Good said,\nthe whole thing seemed more as though one had had a bad nightmare just\nbefore being called, than as a deed done. When we were finishing our\nbreakfast the door opened, and in came little Flossie, very pale\nand tottery, but quite unhurt. She kissed us all and thanked us. I\ncongratulated her on the presence of mind she had shown in shooting the\nMasai with her Derringer pistol, and thereby saving her own life.\n\n'Oh, don't talk of it!' she said, beginning to cry hysterically; 'I\nshall never forget his face as he went turning round and round, never--I\ncan see it now.'\n\nI advised her to go to bed and get some sleep, which she did, and awoke\nin the evening quite recovered, so far as her strength was concerned. It\nstruck me as an odd thing that a girl who could find the nerve to shoot\na huge black ruffian rushing to kill her with a spear should have been\nso affected at the thought of it afterwards; but it is, after all,\ncharacteristic of the sex. Poor Flossie! I fear that her nerves will not\nget over that night in the Masai camp for many a long year. She told\nme afterwards that it was the suspense that was so awful, having to sit\nthere hour after hour through the livelong night utterly ignorant as to\nwhether or not any attempt was to be made to rescue her. She said that\non the whole she did not expect it, knowing how few of us, and how many\nof the Masai--who, by the way, came continually to stare at her, most of\nthem never having seen a white person before, and handled her arms and\nhair with their filthy paws. She said also that she had made up her mind\nthat if she saw no signs of succour by the time the first rays of the\nrising sun reached the kraal she would kill herself with the pistol, for\nthe nurse had heard the Lygonani say that they were to be tortured to\ndeath as soon as the sun was up if one of the white men did not come in\ntheir place. It was an awful resolution to have to take, but she meant\nto act on it, and I have little doubt but what she would have done so.\nAlthough she was at an age when in England girls are in the schoolroom\nand come down to dessert, this 'child of the wilderness' had more\ncourage, discretion, and power of mind than many a woman of mature\nage nurtured in idleness and luxury, with minds carefully drilled and\neducated out of any originality or self-resource that nature may have\nendowed them with.\n\nWhen breakfast was over we all turned in and had a good sleep, only\ngetting up in time for dinner; after which meal we once more adjourned,\ntogether with all the available population--men, women, youths, and\ngirls--to the scene of the morning's slaughter, our object being to bury\nour own dead and get rid of the Masai by flinging them into the Tana\nRiver, which ran within fifty yards of the kraal. On reaching the spot\nwe disturbed thousands upon thousands of vultures and a sort of brown\nbush eagle, which had been flocking to the feast from miles and\nmiles away. Often have I watched these great and repulsive birds, and\nmarvelled at the extraordinary speed with which they arrive on a scene\nof slaughter. A buck falls to your rifle, and within a minute high in\nthe blue ether appears a speck that gradually grows into a vulture, then\nanother, and another. I have heard many theories advanced to account for\nthe wonderful power of perception nature has given these birds. My own,\nfounded on a good deal of observation, is that the vultures, gifted\nas they are with powers of sight greater than those given by the most\npowerful glass, quarter out the heavens among themselves, and hanging\nin mid-air at a vast height--probably from two to three miles above the\nearth--keep watch, each of them, over an enormous stretch of country.\nPresently one of them spies food, and instantly begins to sink towards\nit. Thereon his next neighbour in the airy heights sailing leisurely\nthrough the blue gulf, at a distance perhaps of some miles, follows his\nexample, knowing that food has been sighted. Down he goes, and all the\nvultures within sight of him follow after, and so do all those in sight\nof them. In this way the vultures for twenty miles round can be summoned\nto the feast in a few minutes.\n\nWe buried our dead in solemn silence, Good being selected to read the\nBurial Service over them (in the absence of Mr Mackenzie, confined to\nbed), as he was generally allowed to possess the best voice and most\nimpressive manner. It was melancholy in the extreme, but, as Good said,\nit might have been worse, for we might have had 'to bury ourselves'. I\npointed out that this would have been a difficult feat, but I knew what\nhe meant.\n\nNext we set to work to load an ox-wagon which had been brought round\nfrom the Mission with the dead bodies of the Masai, having first\ncollected the spears, shields, and other arms. We loaded the wagon five\ntimes, about fifty bodies to the load, and emptied it into the Tana.\nFrom this it was evident that very few of the Masai could have escaped.\nThe crocodiles must have been well fed that night. One of the last\nbodies we picked up was that of the sentry at the upper end. I asked\nGood how he managed to kill him, and he told me that he had crept up\nmuch as Umslopogaas had done, and stabbed him with his sword. He groaned\na good deal, but fortunately nobody heard him. As Good said, it was a\nhorrible thing to have to do, and most unpleasantly like cold-blooded\nmurder.\n\nAnd so with the last body that floated away down the current of the\nTana ended the incident of our attack on the Masai camp. The spears and\nshields and other arms we took up to the Mission, where they filled an\nouthouse. One incident, however, I must not forget to mention. As we\nwere returning from performing the obsequies of our Masai friends\nwe passed the hollow tree where Alphonse had secreted himself in\nthe morning. It so happened that the little man himself was with us\nassisting in our unpleasant task with a far better will than he had\nshown where live Masai were concerned. Indeed, for each body that he\nhandled he found an appropriate sarcasm. Alphonse throwing Masai into\nthe Tana was a very different creature from Alphonse flying for dear\nlife from the spear of a live Masai. He was quite merry and gay, he\nclapped his hands and warbled snatches of French songs as the grim dead\nwarriors went 'splash' into the running waters to carry a message of\ndeath and defiance to their kindred a hundred miles below. In short,\nthinking that he wanted taking down a peg, I suggested holding a\ncourt-martial on him for his conduct in the morning.\n\nAccordingly we brought him to the tree where he had hidden, and\nproceeded to sit in judgment on him, Sir Henry explaining to him in the\nvery best French the unheard-of cowardice and enormity of his conduct,\nmore especially in letting the oiled rag out of his mouth, whereby he\nnearly aroused the Masai camp with teeth-chattering and brought about\nthe failure of our plans: ending up with a request for an explanation.\n\nBut if we expected to find Alphonse at a loss and put him to open shame\nwe were destined to be disappointed. He bowed and scraped and smiled,\nand acknowledged that his conduct might at first blush appear strange,\nbut really it was not, inasmuch as his teeth were not chattering from\nfear--oh, dear no! oh, certainly not! he marvelled how the 'messieurs'\ncould think of such a thing--but from the chill air of the morning. As\nfor the rag, if monsieur could have but tasted its evil flavour, being\ncompounded indeed of a mixture of stale paraffin oil, grease, and\ngunpowder, monsieur himself would have spat it out. But he did nothing\nof the sort; he determined to keep it there till, alas! his stomach\n'revolted', and the rag was ejected in an access of involuntary\nsickness.\n\n'And what have you to say about getting into the hollow tree?' asked Sir\nHenry, keeping his countenance with difficulty.\n\n'But, monsieur, the explanation is easy; oh, most easy! it was thus: I\nstood there by the kraal wall, and the little grey monsieur hit me in\nthe stomach so that my rifle exploded, and the battle began. I watched\nwhilst recovering myself from monsieur's cruel blow; then, messieurs, I\nfelt the heroic blood of my grandfather boil up in my veins. The sight\nmade me mad. I ground my teeth! Fire flashed from my eyes! I shouted\n\"En avant!\" and longed to slay. Before my eyes there rose a vision of\nmy heroic grandfather! In short, I was mad! I was a warrior indeed!\nBut then in my heart I heard a small voice: \"Alphonse,\" said the voice,\n\"restrain thyself, Alphonse! Give not way to this evil passion! These\nmen, though black, are brothers! And thou wouldst slay them? Cruel\nAlphonse!\" The voice was right. I knew it; I was about to perpetrate the\nmost horrible cruelties: to wound! to massacre! to tear limb from limb!\nAnd how restrain myself? I looked round; I saw the tree, I perceived the\nhole. \"Entomb thyself,\" said the voice, \"and hold on tight! Thou wilt\nthus overcome temptation by main force!\" It was bitter, just when the\nblood of my heroic grandfather boiled most fiercely; but I obeyed! I\ndragged my unwilling feet along; I entombed myself! Through the hole I\nwatched the battle! I shouted curses and defiance on the foe! I noted\nthem fall with satisfaction! Why not? I had not robbed them of their\nlives. Their gore was not upon my head. The blood of my heroic--'\n\n'Oh, get along with you, you little cur!' broke out Sir Henry, with a\nshout of laughter, and giving Alphonse a good kick which sent him flying\noff with a rueful face.\n\nIn the evening I had an interview with Mr Mackenzie, who was suffering\na good deal from his wounds, which Good, who was a skilful though\nunqualified doctor, was treating him for. He told me that this\noccurrence had taught him a lesson, and that, if he recovered safely, he\nmeant to hand over the Mission to a younger man, who was already on his\nroad to join him in his work, and return to England.\n\n'You see, Quatermain,' he said, 'I made up my mind to it, this very\nmorning, when we were creeping down those benighted savages. \"If we live\nthrough this and rescue Flossie alive,\" I said to myself, \"I will go\nhome to England; I have had enough of savages.\" Well, I did not think\nthat we should live through it at the time; but thanks be to God and you\nfour, we have lived through it, and I mean to stick to my resolution,\nlest a worse thing befall us. Another such time would kill my poor wife.\nAnd besides, Quatermain, between you and me, I am well off; it is thirty\nthousand pounds I am worth today, and every farthing of it made by\nhonest trade and savings in the bank at Zanzibar, for living here costs\nme next to nothing. So though it will be hard to leave this place, which\nI have made to blossom like a rose in the wilderness, and harder still\nto leave the people I have taught, I shall go.'\n\n'I congratulate you on your decision,' answered I, 'for two reasons.\nThe first is, that you owe a duty to your wife and daughter, and more\nespecially to the latter, who should receive some education and mix with\ngirls of her own race, otherwise she will grow up wild, shunning her\nkind. The other is, that as sure as I am standing here, sooner or later\nthe Masai will try to avenge the slaughter inflicted on them today. Two\nor three men are sure to have escaped the confusion who will carry\nthe story back to their people, and the result will be that a great\nexpedition will one day be sent against you. It might be delayed for\na year, but sooner or later it will come. Therefore, if only for that\nreason, I should go. When once they have learnt that you are no longer\nhere they may perhaps leave the place alone.' {Endnote 8}\n\n'You are quite right,' answered the clergyman. 'I will turn my back upon\nthis place in a month. But it will be a wrench, it will be a wrench.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX INTO THE UNKNOWN\n\n\n\nA week had passed, and we all sat at supper one night in the Mission\ndining-room, feeling very much depressed in spirits, for the reason that\nwe were going to say goodbye to our kind friends, the Mackenzies, and\ndepart upon our way at dawn on the morrow. Nothing more had been seen\nor heard of the Masai, and save for a spear or two which had been\noverlooked and was rusting in the grass, and a few empty cartridges\nwhere we had stood outside the wall, it would have been difficult to\ntell that the old cattle kraal at the foot of the slope had been the\nscene of so desperate a struggle. Mackenzie was, thanks chiefly to his\nbeing so temperate a man, rapidly recovering from his wound, and could\nget about on a pair of crutches; and as for the other wounded men, one\nhad died of gangrene, and the rest were in a fair way to recovery. Mr\nMackenzie's caravan of men had also returned from the coast, so that the\nstation was now amply garrisoned.\n\nUnder these circumstances we concluded, warm and pressing as were the\ninvitations for us to stay, that it was time to move on, first to Mount\nKenia, and thence into the unknown in search of the mysterious white\nrace which we had set our hearts on discovering. This time we were going\nto progress by means of the humble but useful donkey, of which we had\ncollected no less than a dozen, to carry our goods and chattels, and, if\nnecessary, ourselves. We had now but two Wakwafis left for servants, and\nfound it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into\nthe unknown parts we proposed to explore--and small blame to them.\nAfter all, as Mr Mackenzie said, it was odd that three men, each of\nwhom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth\nliving--health, sufficient means, and position, etc.--should from their\nown pleasure start out upon a wild-goose chase, from which the chances\nwere they never would return. But then that is what Englishmen are,\nadventurers to the backbone; and all our magnificent muster-roll of\ncolonies, each of which will in time become a great nation, testify to\nthe extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight\nlooks like a mild form of lunacy. 'Adventurer'--he that goes out to meet\nwhatever may come. Well, that is what we all do in the world one way or\nanother, and, speaking for myself, I am proud of the title, because it\nimplies a brave heart and a trust in Providence. Besides, when many and\nmany a noted Croesus, at whose feet the people worship, and many and\nmany a time-serving and word-coining politician are forgotten, the names\nof those grand-hearted old adventurers who have made England what she\nis, will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children\nwhose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be. Not\nthat we three can expect to be numbered with such as these, yet have we\ndone something--enough, perhaps, to throw a garment over the nakedness\nof our folly.\n\nThat evening, whilst we were sitting on the veranda, smoking a pipe\nbefore turning in, who should come up to us but Alphonse, and, with a\nmagnificent bow, announce his wish for an interview. Being requested to\n'fire away', he explained at some length that he was anxious to attach\nhimself to our party--a statement that astonished me not a little,\nknowing what a coward the little man was. The reason, however, soon\nappeared. Mr Mackenzie was going down to the coast, and thence on to\nEngland. Now, if he went down country, Alphonse was persuaded that he\nwould be seized, extradited, sent to France, and to penal servitude.\nThis was the idea that haunted him, as King Charles's head haunted Mr\nDick, and he brooded over it till his imagination exaggerated the danger\nten times. As a matter of fact, the probability is that his offence\nagainst the laws of his country had long ago been forgotten, and that\nhe would have been allowed to pass unmolested anywhere except in France;\nbut he could not be got to see this. Constitutional coward as the little\nman was, he infinitely preferred to face the certain hardships and great\nrisks and dangers of such an expedition as ours, than to expose himself,\nnotwithstanding his intense longing for his native land, to the\npossible scrutiny of a police officer--which is after all only another\nexemplification of the truth that, to the majority of men, a far-off\nforeseen danger, however shadowy, is much more terrible than the most\nserious present emergency. After listening to what he had to say, we\nconsulted among ourselves, and finally agreed, with Mr Mackenzie's\nknowledge and consent, to accept his offer. To begin with, we were very\nshort-handed, and Alphonse was a quick, active fellow, who could turn\nhis hand to anything, and cook--ah, he _could_ cook! I believe that\nhe would have made a palatable dish of those gaiters of his heroic\ngrandfather which he was so fond of talking about. Then he was a\ngood-tempered little man, and merry as a monkey, whilst his pompous,\nvainglorious talk was a source of infinite amusement to us; and what is\nmore, he never bore malice. Of course, his being so pronounced a coward\nwas a great drawback to him, but now that we knew his weakness we could\nmore or less guard against it. So, after warning him of the undoubted\nrisks he was exposing himself to, we told him that we would accept\nhis offer on condition that he would promise implicit obedience to our\norders. We also promised to give him wages at the rate of ten pounds a\nmonth should he ever return to a civilized country to receive them. To\nall of this he agreed with alacrity, and retired to write a letter\nto his Annette, which Mr Mackenzie promised to post when he got down\ncountry. He read it to us afterwards, Sir Henry translating, and a\nwonderful composition it was. I am sure the depth of his devotion and\nthe narration of his sufferings in a barbarous country, 'far, far from\nthee, Annette, for whose adored sake I endure such sorrow,' ought to\nhave touched the feelings of the stoniest-hearted chambermaid.\n\nWell, the morrow came, and by seven o'clock the donkeys were all loaded,\nand the time of parting was at hand. It was a melancholy business,\nespecially saying goodbye to dear little Flossie. She and I were great\nfriends, and often used to have talks together--but her nerves had never\ngot over the shock of that awful night when she lay in the power of\nthose bloodthirsty Masai. 'Oh, Mr Quatermain,' she cried, throwing her\narms round my neck and bursting into tears, 'I can't bear to say goodbye\nto you. I wonder when we shall meet again?'\n\n'I don't know, my dear little girl,' I said, 'I am at one end of life\nand you are at the other. I have but a short time before me at best, and\nmost things lie in the past, but I hope that for you there are many long\nand happy years, and everything lies in the future. By-and-by you will\ngrow into a beautiful woman, Flossie, and all this wild life will be\nlike a far-off dream to you; but I hope, even if we never do meet again,\nthat you will think of your old friend and remember what I say to you\nnow. Always try to be good, my dear, and to do what is right, rather\nthan what happens to be pleasant, for in the end, whatever sneering\npeople may say, what is good and what is happy are the same. Be\nunselfish, and whenever you can, give a helping hand to others--for the\nworld is full of suffering, my dear, and to alleviate it is the noblest\nend that we can set before us. If you do that you will become a sweet\nand God-fearing woman, and make many people's lives a little brighter,\nand then you will not have lived, as so many of your sex do, in vain.\nAnd now I have given you a lot of old-fashioned advice, and so I am\ngoing to give you something to sweeten it with. You see this little\npiece of paper. It is what is called a cheque. When we are gone give it\nto your father with this note--not before, mind. You will marry one day,\nmy dear little Flossie, and it is to buy you a wedding present which\nyou are to wear, and your daughter after you, if you have one, in\nremembrance of Hunter Quatermain.'\n\nPoor little Flossie cried very much, and gave me a lock of her bright\nhair in return, which I still have. The cheque I gave her was for a\nthousand pounds (which being now well off, and having no calls upon\nme except those of charity, I could well afford), and in the note I\ndirected her father to invest it for her in Government security, and\nwhen she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace\nhe could get for the money and accumulated interest. I chose diamonds\nbecause I think that now that King Solomon's Mines are lost to the\nworld, their price will never be much lower than it is at present, so\nthat if in after-life she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties, she\nwill be able to turn them into money.\n\nWell, at last we got off, after much hand-shaking, hat-waving, and also\nfarewell saluting from the natives, Alphonse weeping copiously (for he\nhas a warm heart) at parting with his master and mistress; and I was\nnot sorry for it at all, for I hate those goodbyes. Perhaps the most\naffecting thing of all was to witness Umslopogaas' distress at parting\nwith Flossie, for whom the grim old warrior had conceived a strong\naffection. He used to say that she was as sweet to see as the only star\non a dark night, and was never tired of loudly congratulating himself\non having killed the Lygonani who had threatened to murder her. And that\nwas the last we saw of the pleasant Mission-house--a true oasis in\nthe desert--and of European civilization. But I often think of the\nMackenzies, and wonder how they got down country, and if they are now\nsafe and well in England, and will ever see these words. Dear little\nFlossie! I wonder how she fares there where there are no black folk to\ndo her imperious bidding, and no sky-piercing snow-clad Kenia for her to\nlook at when she gets up in the morning. And so goodbye to Flossie.\n\nAfter leaving the Mission-house we made our way, comparatively\nunmolested, past the base of Mount Kenia, which the Masai call 'Donyo\nEgere', or the 'speckled mountain', on account of the black patches\nof rock that appear upon its mighty spire, where the sides are too\nprecipitous to allow of the snow lying on them; then on past the\nlonely lake Baringo, where one of our two remaining Askari, having\nunfortunately trodden on a puff-adder, died of snake-bite, in spite of\nall our efforts to save him. Thence we proceeded a distance of about a\nhundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snow-clad mountain called\nLekakisera, which has never, to the best of my belief, been visited\nbefore by a European, but which I cannot now stop to describe. There\nwe rested a fortnight, and then started out into the trackless and\nuninhabited forest of a vast district called Elgumi. In this forest\nalone there are more elephants than I ever met with or heard of before.\nThe mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man, and\nonly kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing\nbeyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them.\nNeedless to say, however, we did not shoot many of them, first because\nwe could not afford to waste ammunition, of which our stock was getting\nperilously low, a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in\nfording a flooded river; and secondly, because we could not carry away\nthe ivory, and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter. So\nwe let the great beasts be, only shooting one or two in self-protection.\nIn this district, the elephants, being unacquainted with the hunter and\nhis tender mercies, would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of\nthem in the open, while they stood, with their great ears cocked for all\nthe world like puzzled and gigantic puppy-dogs, and stared at that new\nand extraordinary phenomenon--man. Occasionally, when the inspection did\nnot prove satisfactory, the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge,\nbut this did not often happen. When it did we had to use our rifles.\nNor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great Elgumi forest. All\nsorts of large game abounded, including lions--confound them! I have\nalways hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for\nlife. As a consequence, another thing that abounded was the dreadful\ntsetse fly, whose bite is death to domestic animals. Donkeys have,\ntogether with men, hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity\nfrom its attacks; but all I have to say, whether it was on account\nof their poor condition, or because the tsetse in those parts is\nmore poisonous than usual, I do not know, but ours succumbed to its\nonslaught. Fortunately, however, that was not till two months or so\nafter the bites had been inflicted, when suddenly, after a two days'\ncold rain, they all died, and on removing the skins of several of them I\nfound the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of\ndeath from bites from the tsetse, marking the spot where the insect had\ninserted his proboscis. On emerging from the great Elgumi forest,\nwe, still steering northwards, in accordance with the information Mr\nMackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him\nonly to die so tragically, struck the base in due course of the large\nlake, called Laga by the natives, which is about fifty miles long by\ntwenty broad, and of which, it may be remembered, he made mention.\nThence we pushed on nearly a month's journey over great rolling uplands,\nsomething like those in the Transvaal, but diversified by patches of\nbush country.\n\nAll this time we were continually ascending at the rate of about one\nhundred feet every ten miles. Indeed the country was on a slope which\nappeared to terminate at a mass of snow-tipped mountains, for which we\nwere steering, and where we learnt the second lake of which the wanderer\nhad spoken as the lake without a bottom was situated. At length we\narrived there, and, having ascertained that there _was_ a large lake on\ntop of the mountains, ascended three thousand feet more till we came to\na precipitous cliff or edge, to find a great sheet of water some\ntwenty miles square lying fifteen hundred feet below us, and evidently\noccupying an extinct volcanic crater or craters of vast extent.\nPerceiving villages on the border of this lake, we descended with\ngreat difficulty through forests of pine trees, which now clothed the\nprecipitous sides of the crater, and were well received by the people, a\nsimple, unwarlike folk, who had never seen or even heard of a white man\nbefore, and treated us with great reverence and kindness, supplying us\nwith as much food and milk as we could eat and drink. This wonderful\nand beautiful lake lay, according to our aneroid, at a height of no less\nthan 11,450 feet above sea-level, and its climate was quite cold, and\nnot at all unlike that of England. Indeed, for the first three days of\nour stay there we saw little or nothing of the scenery on account of an\nunmistakable Scotch mist which prevailed. It was this rain that set the\ntsetse poison working in our remaining donkeys, so that they all died.\n\nThis disaster left us in a very awkward position, as we had now no\nmeans of transport whatever, though on the other hand we had not much to\ncarry. Ammunition, too, was very short, amounting to but one hundred and\nfifty rounds of rifle cartridges and some fifty shot-gun cartridges.\nHow to get on we did not know; indeed it seemed to us that we had about\nreached the end of our tether. Even if we had been inclined to abandon\nthe object of our search, which, shadow as it was, was by no means the\ncase, it was ridiculous to think of forcing our way back some seven\nhundred miles to the coast in our present plight; so we came to the\nconclusion that the only thing to be done was to stop where we were--the\nnatives being so well disposed and food plentiful--for the present, and\nabide events, and try to collect information as to the countries beyond.\n\nAccordingly, having purchased a capital log canoe, large enough to hold\nus all and our baggage, from the headman of the village we were staying\nin, presenting him with three empty cold-drawn brass cartridges by way\nof payment, with which he was perfectly delighted, we set out to make\na tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a\ncamp. As we did not know if we should return to this village, we put all\nour gear into the canoe, and also a quarter of cooked water-buck, which\nwhen young is delicious eating, and off we set, natives having already\ngone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other\nvillages of our approach.\n\nAs we were puddling leisurely along Good remarked upon the extraordinary\ndeep blue colour of the water, and said that he understood from the\nnatives, who were great fishermen--fish, indeed, being their principal\nfood--that the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep, and to have\na hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some\ngreat fire that was raging below.\n\nI pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend\narising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time\nwhen one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity. We saw\nseveral round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working\nat a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater\nwhich now formed the bed of the lake itself. When it finally became\nextinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run\ndown and put out the big fire below, more especially as, though it was\nconstantly fed by streams running from the snow-tipped peaks about,\nthere was no visible exit to it.\n\nThe farther shore of the lake we found, on approaching it, to consist\nof a vast perpendicular wall of rock, which held the water without any\nintermediate sloping bank, as elsewhere. Accordingly we paddled parallel\nwith this precipice, at a distance of about a hundred paces from it,\nshaping our course for the end of the lake, where we knew that there was\na large village.\n\nAs we went we began to pass a considerable accumulation of floating\nrushes, weed, boughs of trees, and other rubbish, brought, Good\nsupposed, to this spot by some current, which he was much puzzled to\naccount for. Whilst we were speculating about this, Sir Henry pointed\nout a flock of large white swans, which were feeding on the drift some\nlittle way ahead of us. Now I had already noticed swans flying about\nthis lake, and, having never come across them before in Africa, was\nexceedingly anxious to obtain a specimen. I had questioned the natives\nabout them, and learnt that they came from over the mountain, always\narriving at certain periods of the year in the early morning, when it\nwas very easy to catch them, on account of their exhausted condition.\nI also asked them what country they came from, when they shrugged their\nshoulders, and said that on the top of the great black precipice was\nstony inhospitable land, and beyond that were mountains with snow, and\nfull of wild beasts, where no people lived, and beyond the mountains\nwere hundreds of miles of dense thorn forest, so thick that even the\nelephants could not get through it, much less men. Next I asked them if\nthey had ever heard of white people like ourselves living on the farther\nside of the mountains and the thorn forest, whereat they laughed. But\nafterwards a very old woman came and told me that when she was a little\ngirl her grandfather had told her that in his youth _his_ grandfather\nhad crossed the desert and the mountains, and pierced the thorn forest,\nand seen a white people who lived in stone kraals beyond. Of course,\nas this took the tale back some two hundred and fifty years, the\ninformation was very indefinite; but still there it was again, and on\nthinking it over I grew firmly convinced that there was some truth in\nall these rumours, and equally firmly determined to solve the mystery.\nLittle did I guess in what an almost miraculous way my desire was to be\ngratified.\n\nWell, we set to work to stalk the swans, which kept drawing, as they\nfed, nearer and nearer to the precipice, and at last we pushed the canoe\nunder shelter of a patch of drift within forty yards of them. Sir Henry\nhad the shot-gun, loaded with No. 1, and, waiting for a chance, got two\nin a line, and, firing at their necks, killed them both. Up rose the\nrest, thirty or more of them, with a mighty splashing; and, as they did\nso, he gave them the other barrel. Down came one fellow with a broken\nwing, and I saw the leg of another drop and a few feathers start out of\nhis back; but he went on quite strong. Up went the swans, circling ever\nhigher till at last they were mere specks level with the top of the\nfrowning precipice, when I saw them form into a triangle and head off\nfor the unknown north-east. Meanwhile we had picked up our two dead\nones, and beautiful birds they were, weighing not less than about thirty\npounds each, and were chasing the winged one, which had scrambled over\na mass of driftweed into a pool of clear water beyond. Finding a\ndifficulty in forcing the canoe through the rubbish, I told our only\nremaining Wakwafi servant, whom I knew to be an excellent swimmer, to\njump over, dive under the drift, and catch him, knowing that as there\nwere no crocodiles in this lake he could come to no harm. Entering into\nthe fun of the thing, the man obeyed, and soon was dodging about after\nthe winged swan in fine style, getting gradually nearer to the rock\nwall, against which the water washed as he did so.\n\nPresently he gave up swimming after the swan, and began to cry out\nthat he was being carried away; and, indeed, we saw that, though he was\nswimming with all his strength towards us, he was being drawn slowly to\nthe precipice. With a few desperate strokes of our paddles we pushed the\ncanoe through the crust of drift and rowed towards the man as hard as we\ncould, but, fast as we went, he was drawn faster to the rock. Suddenly I\nsaw that before us, just rising eighteen inches or so above the surface\nof the lake, was what looked like the top of the arch of a submerged\ncave or railway tunnel. Evidently, from the watermark on the rock\nseveral feet above it, it was generally entirely submerged; but there\nhad been a dry season, and the cold had prevented the snow from melting\nas freely as usual; so the lake was low and the arch showed. Towards\nthis arch our poor servant was being sucked with frightful rapidity. He\nwas not more than ten fathoms from it, and we were about twenty when I\nsaw it, and with little help from us the canoe flew along after him.\nHe struggled bravely, and I thought that we should have saved him, when\nsuddenly I perceived an expression of despair come upon his face, and\nthere before our eyes he was sucked down into the cruel swirling blue\ndepths, and vanished. At the same moment I felt our canoe seized as with\na mighty hand, and propelled with resistless force towards the rock.\n\nWe realized our danger now and rowed, or rather paddled, furiously in\nour attempt to get out of the vortex. In vain; in another second we were\nflying straight for the arch like an arrow, and I thought that we were\nlost. Luckily I retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out,\ninstantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the\ncanoe, 'Down on your faces--down!' and the others had the sense to take\nthe hint. In another instant there was a grinding noise, and the boat\nwas pushed down till the water began to trickle over the sides, and I\nthought that we were gone. But no, suddenly the grinding ceased, and we\ncould again feel the canoe flying along. I turned my head a little--I\ndared not lift it--and looked up. By the feeble light that yet reached\nthe canoe, I could make out that a dense arch of rock hung just over our\nheads, and that was all. In another minute I could not even see as much\nas that, for the faint light had merged into shadow, and the shadows had\nbeen swallowed up in darkness, utter and complete.\n\nFor an hour or so we lay there, not daring to lift our heads for fear\nlest the brains should be dashed out of them, and scarcely able to speak\neven, on account of the noise of the rushing water which drowned our\nvoices. Not, indeed, that we had much inclination to speak, seeing that\nwe were overwhelmed by the awfulness of our position and the imminent\nfear of instant death, either by being dashed against the sides of the\ncavern, or on a rock, or being sucked down in the raging waters, or\nperhaps asphyxiated by want of air. All of these and many other modes of\ndeath presented themselves to my imagination as I lay at the bottom\nof the canoe, listening to the swirl of the hurrying waters which ran\nwhither we knew not. One only other sound could I hear, and that was\nAlphonse's intermittent howl of terror coming from the centre of the\ncanoe, and even that seemed faint and unnatural. Indeed, the whole thing\noverpowered my brain, and I began to believe that I was the victim of\nsome ghastly spirit-shaking nightmare.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X THE ROSE OF FIRE\n\n\n\nOn we flew, drawn by the mighty current, till at last I noticed that\nthe sound of the water was not half so deafening as it had been, and\nconcluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes\nto disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse's howls much more distinctly;\nthey were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme\nPower and the name of his beloved Annette that it is possible to\nconceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them\nfrom profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a\npaddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that\nthe end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously\nraised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch\nno roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as\nI could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the\nright and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought\nme that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions,\na bull's-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and\nhaving a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got\na hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the\nfirst thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse,\nwho, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing\na preliminary celestial phenomenon, gave a terrific yell and was with\ndifficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was\nlying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and\ngazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting\non the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the\nspeed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas\nI could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast\nquarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we\nall prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into\nthe water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas's head had come down uncommonly\nnear this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from\nthe first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry.\nThereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now\nemployed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he\nafterwards explained, he thought that he was going 'on a long journey',\nand preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of the people\nwho are going to be hanged, and who are generally reported in the\nEnglish daily papers to have made 'an excellent breakfast'.\n\nAs soon as the others saw that I had managed to light the lamp, we\nbundled Alphonse into the farther end of the canoe with a threat which\ncalmed him down wonderfully, that if he would insist upon making the\ndarkness hideous with his cries we would put him out of suspense by\nsending him to join the Wakwafi and wait for Annette in another sphere,\nand began to discuss the situation as well as we could. First, however,\nat Good's suggestion, we bound two paddles mast-fashion in the bows so\nthat they might give us warning against any sudden lowering of the\nroof of the cave or waterway. It was clear to us that we were in an\nunderground river or, as Alphonse defined it, 'main drain', which\ncarried off the superfluous waters of the lake. Such rivers are well\nknown to exist in many parts of the world, but it has not often been the\nevil fortune of explorers to travel by them. That the river was wide we\ncould clearly see, for the light from the bull's-eye lantern failed to\nreach from shore to shore, although occasionally, when the current swept\nus either to one side or the other, we could distinguish the rock wall\nof the tunnel, which, as far as we could make out, appeared to arch\nabout twenty-five feet above our heads. As for the current itself, it\nran, Good estimated, at least eight knots, and, fortunately for us, was,\nas is usual, fiercest in the middle of the stream. Still, our first act\nwas to arrange that one of us, with the lantern and a pole there was in\nthe canoe, should always be in the bows ready, if possible, to prevent\nus from being stove in against the side of the cave or any projecting\nrock. Umslopogaas, having already dined, took the first turn. This was\nabsolutely, with one exception, all that we could do towards preserving\nour safety. The exception was that another of us took up a position in\nthe stern with a paddle by means of which it was possible to steer the\ncanoe more or less and to keep her from the sides of the cave. These\nmatters attended to, we made a somewhat sparing meal off the cold buck's\nmeat (for we did not know how long it might have to last us), and then\nfeeling in rather better spirits I gave my opinion that, serious as\nit undoubtedly was, I did not consider our position altogether without\nhope, unless, indeed, the natives were right, and the river plunged\nstraight down into the bowels of the earth. If not, it was clear that it\nmust emerge somewhere, probably on the other side of the mountains, and\nin that case all we had to think of was to keep ourselves alive till\nwe got there, wherever 'there' might be. But, of course, as Good\nlugubriously pointed out, on the other hand we might fall victims to\na hundred unsuspected horrors--or the river might go on winding away\ninside the earth till it dried up, in which case our fate would indeed\nbe an awful one.\n\n'Well, let us hope for the best and prepare ourselves for the worst,'\nsaid Sir Henry, who is always cheerful and even spirited--a very tower\nof strength in the time of trouble. 'We have come out of so many queer\nscrapes together, that somehow I almost fancy we shall come out of\nthis,' he added.\n\nThis was excellent advice, and we proceeded to take it each in our\nseparate way--that is, except Alphonse, who had by now sunk into a sort\nof terrified stupor. Good was at the helm and Umslopogaas in the bows,\nso there was nothing left for Sir Henry and myself to do except to lie\ndown in the canoe and think. It certainly was a curious, and indeed\nalmost a weird, position to be placed in--rushing along, as we were,\nthrough the bowels of the earth, borne on the bosom of a Stygian river,\nsomething after the fashion of souls being ferried by Charon, as Curtis\nsaid. And how dark it was! The feeble ray from our little lamp did but\nserve to show the darkness. There in the bows sat old Umslopogaas, like\nPleasure in the poem, {Endnote 9} watchful and untiring, the pole ready\nto his hand, and behind in the shadow I could just make out the form\nof Good peering forward at the ray of light in order to make out how\nto steer with the paddle that he held and now and again dipped into the\nwater.\n\n'Well, well,' thought I, 'you have come in search of adventures, Allan\nmy boy, and you have certainly got them. At your time of life, too! You\nought to be ashamed of yourself; but somehow you are not, and, awful as\nit all is, perhaps you will pull through after all; and if you don't,\nwhy, you cannot help it, you see! And when all's said and done an\nunderground river will make a very appropriate burying-place.'\n\nAt first, however, I am bound to say that the strain upon the nerves was\nvery great. It is trying to the coolest and most experienced person not\nto know from one hour to another if he has five minutes more to live,\nbut there is nothing in this world that one cannot get accustomed to,\nand in time we began to get accustomed even to that. And, after all,\nour anxiety, though no doubt natural, was, strictly speaking, illogical,\nseeing that we never know what is going to happen to us the next minute,\neven when we sit in a well-drained house with two policemen patrolling\nunder the window--nor how long we have to live. It is all arranged for\nus, my sons, so what is the use of bothering?\n\nIt was nearly midday when we made our dive into darkness, and we had set\nour watch (Good and Umslopogaas) at two, having agreed that it should\nbe of a duration of five hours. At seven o'clock, accordingly, Sir Henry\nand I went on, Sir Henry at the bow and I at the stern, and the other\ntwo lay down and went to sleep. For three hours all went well, Sir Henry\nonly finding it necessary once to push us off from the side; and I that\nbut little steering was required to keep us straight, as the violent\ncurrent did all that was needed, though occasionally the canoe showed\na tendency which had to be guarded against to veer and travel broadside\non. What struck me as the most curious thing about this wonderful river\nwas: how did the air keep fresh? It was muggy and thick, no doubt,\nbut still not sufficiently so to render it bad or even remarkably\nunpleasant. The only explanation that I can suggest is that the water of\nthe lake had sufficient air in it to keep the atmosphere of the tunnel\nfrom absolute stagnation, this air being given out as it proceeded on\nits headlong way. Of course I only give the solution of the mystery for\nwhat it is worth, which perhaps is not much.\n\nWhen I had been for three hours or so at the helm, I began to notice a\ndecided change in the temperature, which was getting warmer. At first I\ntook no notice of it, but when, at the expiration of another half-hour,\nI found that it was getting hotter and hotter, I called to Sir Henry and\nasked him if he noticed it, or if it was only my imagination. 'Noticed\nit!' he answered; 'I should think so. I am in a sort of Turkish bath.'\nJust about then the others woke up gasping, and were obliged to begin\nto discard their clothes. Here Umslopogaas had the advantage, for he did\nnot wear any to speak of, except a moocha.\n\nHotter it grew, and hotter yet, till at last we could scarcely breathe,\nand the perspiration poured out of us. Half an hour more, and though we\nwere all now stark naked, we could hardly bear it. The place was like\nan antechamber of the infernal regions proper. I dipped my hand into\nthe water and drew it out almost with a cry; it was nearly boiling. We\nconsulted a little thermometer we had--the mercury stood at 123 degrees.\nFrom the surface of the water rose a dense cloud of steam. Alphonse\ngroaned out that we were already in purgatory, which indeed we were,\nthough not in the sense that he meant it. Sir Henry suggested that we\nmust be passing near the seat of some underground volcanic fire, and\nI am inclined to think, especially in the light of what subsequently\noccurred, that he was right. Our sufferings for some time after this\nreally pass my powers of description. We no longer perspired, for all\nthe perspiration had been sweated out of us. We simply lay in the\nbottom of the boat, which we were now physically incapable of directing,\nfeeling like hot embers, and I fancy undergoing very much the same\nsensations that the poor fish do when they are dying on land--namely,\nthat of slow suffocation. Our skins began to crack, and the blood to\nthrob in our heads like the beating of a steam-engine.\n\nThis had been going on for some time, when suddenly the river turned\na little, and I heard Sir Henry call out from the bows in a hoarse,\nstartled voice, and, looking up, saw a most wonderful and awful thing.\nAbout half a mile ahead of us, and a little to the left of the centre of\nthe stream--which we could now see was about ninety feet broad--a huge\npillar-like jet of almost white flame rose from the surface of the water\nand sprang fifty feet into the air, when it struck the roof and spread\nout some forty feet in diameter, falling back in curved sheets of fire\nshaped like the petals of a full-blown rose. Indeed this awful gas jet\nresembled nothing so much as a great flaming flower rising out of the\nblack water. Below was the straight stalk, a foot or more thick, and\nabove the dreadful bloom. And as for the fearfulness of it and its\nfierce and awesome beauty, who can describe it? Certainly I cannot.\nAlthough we were now some five hundred yards away, it, notwithstanding\nthe steam, lit up the whole cavern as clear as day, and we could see\nthat the roof was here about forty feet above us, and washed perfectly\nsmooth with water. The rock was black, and here and there I could make\nout long shining lines of ore running through it like great veins, but\nof what metal they were I know not.\n\nOn we rushed towards this pillar of fire, which gleamed fiercer than any\nfurnace ever lit by man.\n\n'Keep the boat to the right, Quatermain--to the right,' shouted Sir\nHenry, and a minute afterwards I saw him fall forward senseless.\nAlphonse had already gone. Good was the next to go. There they lay as\nthough dead; only Umslopogaas and I kept our senses. We were within\nfifty yards of it now, and I saw the Zulu's head fall forward on his\nhands. He had gone too, and I was alone. I could not breathe; the fierce\nheat dried me up. For yards and yards round the great rose of fire the\nrock-roof was red-hot. The wood of the boat was almost burning. I saw\nthe feathers on one of the dead swans begin to twist and shrivel up; but\nI would not give in. I knew that if I did we should pass within three or\nfour yards of the gas jet and perish miserably. I set the paddle so as\nto turn the canoe as far from it as possible, and held on grimly.\n\nMy eyes seemed to be bursting from my head, and through my closed lids I\ncould see the fierce light. We were nearly opposite now; it roared like\nall the fires of hell, and the water boiled furiously around it. Five\nseconds more. We were past; I heard the roar behind me.\n\nThen I too fell senseless. The next thing that I recollect is feeling\na breath of air upon my face. My eyes opened with great difficulty. I\nlooked up. Far, far above me there was light, though around me was great\ngloom. Then I remembered and looked. The canoe still floated down the\nriver, and in the bottom of it lay the naked forms of my companions.\n'Were they dead?' I wondered. 'Was I left alone in this awful place?'\nI knew not. Next I became conscious of a burning thirst. I put my hand\nover the edge of the boat into the water and drew it up again with a\ncry. No wonder: nearly all the skin was burnt off the back of it. The\nwater, however, was cold, or nearly so, and I drank pints and splashed\nmyself all over. My body seemed to suck up the fluid as one may see a\nbrick wall suck up rain after a drought; but where I was burnt the touch\nof it caused intense pain. Then I bethought myself of the others, and,\ndragging myself towards them with difficulty, I sprinkled them with\nwater, and to my joy they began to recover--Umslopogaas first, then the\nothers. Next they drank, absorbing water like so many sponges. Then,\nfeeling chilly--a queer contrast to our recent sensations--we began as\nbest we could to get into our clothes. As we did so Good pointed to the\nport side of the canoe: it was all blistered with heat, and in places\nactually charred. Had it been built like our civilized boats, Good said\nthat the planks would certainly have warped and let in enough water to\nsink us; but fortunately it was dug out of the soft, willowy wood of a\nsingle great tree, and had sides nearly three inches and a bottom four\ninches thick. What that awful flame was we never discovered, but I\nsuppose that there was at this spot a crack or hole in the bed of\nthe river through which a vast volume of gas forced its way from its\nvolcanic home in the bowels of the earth towards the upper air. How\nit first became ignited is, of course, impossible to say--probably, I\nshould think, from some spontaneous explosion of mephitic gases.\n\nAs soon as we had got some things together and shaken ourselves together\na little, we set to work to make out where we were now. I have said that\nthere was light above, and on examination we found that it came from the\nsky. Our river that was, Sir Henry said, a literal realization of the\nwild vision of the poet {Endnote 10}, was no longer underground, but\nwas running on its darksome way, not now through 'caverns measureless to\nman', but between two frightful cliffs which cannot have been less than\ntwo thousand feet high. So high were they, indeed, that though the sky\nwas above us, where we were was dense gloom--not darkness indeed, but\nthe gloom of a room closely shuttered in the daytime. Up on either side\nrose the great straight cliffs, grim and forbidding, till the eye grew\ndizzy with trying to measure their sheer height. The little space of\nsky that marked where they ended lay like a thread of blue upon their\nsoaring blackness, which was unrelieved by any tree or creeper. Here\nand there, however, grew ghostly patches of a long grey lichen, hanging\nmotionless to the rock as the white beard to the chin of a dead man. It\nseemed as though only the dregs or heavier part of the light had sunk to\nthe bottom of this awful place. No bright-winged sunbeam could fall so\nlow: they died far, far above our heads.\n\nBy the river's edge was a little shore formed of round fragments of rock\nwashed into this shape by the constant action of water, and giving the\nplace the appearance of being strewn with thousands of fossil cannon\nballs. Evidently when the water of the underground river is high there\nis no beach at all, or very little, between the border of the stream\nand the precipitous cliffs; but now there was a space of seven or eight\nyards. And here, on this beach, we determined to land, in order to rest\nourselves a little after all that we had gone through and to stretch our\nlimbs. It was a dreadful place, but it would give an hour's respite from\nthe terrors of the river, and also allow of our repacking and arranging\nthe canoe. Accordingly we selected what looked like a favourable spot,\nand with some little difficulty managed to beach the canoe and scramble\nout on to the round, inhospitable pebbles.\n\n'My word,' called out Good, who was on shore the first, 'what an awful\nplace! It's enough to give one a fit.' And he laughed.\n\nInstantly a thundering voice took up his words, magnifying them a\nhundred times. '_Give one a fit--Ho! ho! ho!'--'A fit, Ho! ho! ho!_'\nanswered another voice in wild accents from far up the cliff--_a fit! a\nfit! a fit!_ chimed in voice after voice--each flinging the words to\nand fro with shouts of awful laughter to the invisible lips of the other\ntill the whole place echoed with the words and with shrieks of fiendish\nmerriment, which at last ceased as suddenly as they had begun.\n\n'Oh, mon Dieu!' yelled Alphonse, startled quite out of such self-command\nas he possessed.\n\n'_Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!_' the Titanic echoes thundered,\nshrieked, and wailed in every conceivable tone.\n\n'Ah,' said Umslopogaas calmly, 'I clearly perceive that devils live\nhere. Well, the place looks like it.'\n\nI tried to explain to him that the cause of all the hubbub was a very\nremarkable and interesting echo, but he would not believe it.\n\n'Ah,' he said, 'I know an echo when I hear one. There was one lived\nopposite my kraal in Zululand, and the Intombis [maidens] used to talk\nwith it. But if what we hear is a full-grown echo, mine at home can only\nhave been a baby. No, no--they are devils up there. But I don't think\nmuch of them, though,' he added, taking a pinch of snuff. 'They can\ncopy what one says, but they don't seem to be able to talk on their\nown account, and they dare not show their faces,' and he relapsed into\nsilence, and apparently paid no further attention to such contemptible\nfiends.\n\nAfter this we found it necessary to keep our conversation down to a\nwhisper--for it was really unbearable to have every word one uttered\ntossed to and fro like a tennis-ball, as precipice called to precipice.\n\nBut even our whispers ran up the rocks in mysterious murmurs till at\nlast they died away in long-drawn sighs of sound. Echoes are delightful\nand romantic things, but we had more than enough of them in that\ndreadful gulf.\n\nAs soon as we had settled ourselves a little on the round stones, we\nwent on to wash and dress our burns as well as we could. As we had but a\nlittle oil for the lantern, we could not spare any for this purpose,\nso we skinned one of the swans, and used the fat off its breast, which\nproved an excellent substitute. Then we repacked the canoe, and finally\nbegan to take some food, of which I need scarcely say we were in need,\nfor our insensibility had endured for many hours, and it was, as our\nwatches showed, midday. Accordingly we seated ourselves in a circle, and\nwere soon engaged in discussing our cold meat with such appetite as we\ncould muster, which, in my case at any rate, was not much, as I felt\nsick and faint after my sufferings of the previous night, and had\nbesides a racking headache. It was a curious meal. The gloom was so\nintense that we could scarcely see the way to cut our food and convey\nit to our mouths. Still we got on pretty well, till I happened to look\nbehind me--my attention being attracted by a noise of something crawling\nover the stones, and perceived sitting upon a rock in my immediate rear\na huge species of black freshwater crab, only it was five times the size\nof any crab I ever saw. This hideous and loathsome-looking animal had\nprojecting eyes that seemed to glare at one, very long and flexible\nantennae or feelers, and gigantic claws. Nor was I especially favoured\nwith its company. From every quarter dozens of these horrid brutes were\ncreeping up, drawn, I suppose, by the smell of the food, from between\nthe round stones and out of holes in the precipice. Some were already\nquite close to us. I stared quite fascinated by the unusual sight, and\nas I did so I saw one of the beasts stretch out its huge claw and give\nthe unsuspecting Good such a nip behind that he jumped up with a howl,\nand set the 'wild echoes flying' in sober earnest. Just then, too,\nanother, a very large one, got hold of Alphonse's leg, and declined\nto part with it, and, as may be imagined, a considerable scene ensued.\nUmslopogaas took his axe and cracked the shell of one with the flat of\nit, whereon it set up a horrid screaming which the echoes multiplied\na thousandfold, and began to foam at the mouth, a proceeding that drew\nhundreds more of its friends out of unsuspected holes and corners.\nThose on the spot perceiving that the animal was hurt fell upon it like\ncreditors on a bankrupt, and literally rent it limb from limb with their\nhuge pincers and devoured it, using their claws to convey the fragments\nto their mouths. Seizing whatever weapons were handy, such as stones\nor paddles, we commenced a war upon the monsters--whose numbers were\nincreasing by leaps and bounds, and whose stench was overpowering.\nSo fast as we cracked their armour others seized the injured ones and\ndevoured them, foaming at the mouth, and screaming as they did so. Nor\ndid the brutes stop at that. When they could they nipped hold of us--and\nawful nips they were--or tried to steal the meat. One enormous fellow\ngot hold of the swan we had skinned and began to drag it off. Instantly\na score of others flung themselves upon the prey, and then began a\nghastly and disgusting scene. How the monsters foamed and screamed, and\nrent the flesh, and each other! It was a sickening and unnatural sight,\nand one that will haunt all who saw it till their dying day--enacted as\nit was in the deep, oppressive gloom, and set to the unceasing music of\nthe many-toned nerve-shaking echoes. Strange as it may seem to say\nso, there was something so shockingly human about these fiendish\ncreatures--it was as though all the most evil passions and desires of\nman had got into the shell of a magnified crab and gone mad. They were\nso dreadfully courageous and intelligent, and they looked as if they\n_understood_. The whole scene might have furnished material for another\ncanto of Dante's 'Inferno', as Curtis said.\n\n\n'I say, you fellows, let's get out of this or we shall all go off our\nheads,' sung out Good; and we were not slow to take the hint. Pushing\nthe canoe, around which the animals were now crawling by hundreds and\nmaking vain attempts to climb, off the rocks, we bundled into it and got\nout into mid-stream, leaving behind us the fragments of our meal and the\nscreaming, foaming, stinking mass of monsters in full possession of the\nground.\n\n'Those are the devils of the place,' said Umslopogaas with the air of\none who has solved a problem, and upon my word I felt almost inclined to\nagree with him.\n\nUmslopogaas' remarks were like his axe--very much to the point.\n\n'What's to be done next?' said Sir Henry blankly.\n\n'Drift, I suppose,' I answered, and we drifted accordingly. All the\nafternoon and well into the evening we floated on in the gloom beneath\nthe far-off line of blue sky, scarcely knowing when day ended and night\nbegan, for down in that vast gulf the difference was not marked, till\nat length Good pointed out a star hanging right above us, which, having\nnothing better to do, we observed with great interest. Suddenly it\nvanished, the darkness became intense, and a familiar murmuring sound\nfilled the air. 'Underground again,' I said with a groan, holding up the\nlamp. Yes, there was no doubt about it. I could just make out the roof.\nThe chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had recommenced. And then\nthere began another long, long night of danger and horror. To describe\nall its incidents would be too wearisome, so I will simply say that\nabout midnight we struck on a flat projecting rock in mid-stream and\nwere as nearly as possible overturned and drowned. However, at last we\ngot off, and went upon the uneven tenor of our way. And so the hours\npassed till it was nearly three o'clock. Sir Henry, Good, and Alphonse\nwere asleep, utterly worn out; Umslopogaas was at the bow with the pole,\nand I was steering, when I perceived that the rate at which we\nwere travelling had perceptibly increased. Then, suddenly, I heard\nUmslopogaas make an exclamation, and next second came a sound as of\nparting branches, and I became aware that the canoe was being forced\nthrough hanging bushes or creepers. Another minute, and the breath of\nsweet open air fanned my face, and I felt that we had emerged from the\ntunnel and were floating upon clear water. I say felt, for I could\nsee nothing, the darkness being absolutely pitchy, as it often is just\nbefore the dawn. But even this could scarcely damp my joy. We were out\nof that dreadful river, and wherever we might have got to this at least\nwas something to be thankful for. And so I sat down and inhaled the\nsweet night air and waited for the dawn with such patience as I could\ncommand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI THE FROWNING CITY\n\n\n\nFor an hour or more I sat waiting (Umslopogaas having meanwhile gone to\nsleep also) till at length the east turned grey, and huge misty shapes\nmoved over the surface of the water like ghosts of long-forgotten dawns.\nThey were the vapours rising from their watery bed to greet the sun.\nThen the grey turned to primrose, and the primrose grew to red. Next,\nglorious bars of light sprang up across the eastern sky, and through\nthem the radiant messengers of the dawn came speeding upon their arrowy\nway, scattering the ghostly vapours and awaking the mountains with\na kiss, as they flew from range to range and longitude to longitude.\nAnother moment, and the golden gates were open and the sun himself\ncame forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, with pomp and glory and a\nflashing as of ten million spears, and embraced the night and covered\nher with brightness, and it was day.\n\nBut as yet I could see nothing save the beautiful blue sky above, for\nover the water was a thick layer of mist exactly as though the whole\nsurface had been covered with billows of cotton wool. By degrees,\nhowever, the sun sucked up the mists, and then I saw that we were afloat\nupon a glorious sheet of blue water of which I could not make out the\nshore. Some eight or ten miles behind us, however, there stretched as\nfar as the eye could reach a range of precipitous hills that formed a\nretaining wall of the lake, and I have no doubt but that it was through\nsome entrance in these hills that the subterranean river found its way\ninto the open water. Indeed, I afterwards ascertained this to be the\nfact, and it will be some indication of the extraordinary strength and\ndirectness of the current of the mysterious river that the canoe, even\nat this distance, was still answering to it. Presently, too, I,\nor rather Umslopogaas, who woke up just then, discovered another\nindication, and a very unpleasant one it was. Perceiving some whitish\nobject upon the water, Umslopogaas called my attention to it, and with\na few strokes of the paddle brought the canoe to the spot, whereupon\nwe discovered that the object was the body of a man floating face\ndownwards. This was bad enough, but imagine my horror when Umslopogaas\nhaving turned him on to his back with the paddle, we recognized in the\nsunken features the lineaments of--whom do you suppose? None other than\nour poor servant who had been sucked down two days before in the waters\nof the subterranean river. It quite frightened me. I thought that we had\nleft him behind for ever, and behold! borne by the current, he had\nmade the awful journey with us, and with us had reached the end. His\nappearance also was dreadful, for he bore traces of having touched the\npillar of fire--one arm being completely shrivelled up and all his hair\nbeing burnt off. The features were, as I have said, sunken, and yet they\npreserved upon them that awful look of despair that I had seen upon\nhis living face as the poor fellow was sucked down. Really the sight\nunnerved me, weary and shaken as I felt with all that we had gone\nthrough, and I was heartily glad when suddenly and without any warning\nthe body began to sink just as though it had had a mission, which having\nbeen accomplished, it retired; the real reason no doubt being that\nturning it on its back allowed a free passage to the gas. Down it went\nto the transparent depths--fathom after fathom we could trace its course\ntill at last a long line of bright air-bubbles, swiftly chasing each\nother to the surface, alone remained where it had passed. At length\nthese, too, were gone, and that was an end of our poor servant.\nUmslopogaas thoughtfully watched the body vanish.\n\n'What did he follow us for?' he asked. ''Tis an ill omen for thee and\nme, Macumazahn.' And he laughed.\n\nI turned on him angrily, for I dislike these unpleasant suggestions.\nIf people have such ideas, they ought in common decency to keep them\nto themselves. I detest individuals who make on the subject of their\ndisagreeable presentiments, or who, when they dream that they saw one\nhanged as a common felon, or some such horror, will insist upon telling\none all about it at breakfast, even if they have to get up early to do\nit.\n\nJust then, however, the others woke up and began to rejoice exceedingly\nat finding that we were out of that dreadful river and once more beneath\nthe blue sky. Then followed a babel of talk and suggestions as to what\nwe were to do next, the upshot of all of which was that, as we were\nexcessively hungry, and had nothing whatsoever left to eat except a few\nscraps of biltong (dried game-flesh), having abandoned all that remained\nof our provisions to those horrible freshwater crabs, we determined to\nmake for the shore. But a new difficulty arose. We did not know where\nthe shore was, and, with the exception of the cliffs through which the\nsubterranean river made its entry, could see nothing but a wide expanse\nof sparkling blue water. Observing, however, that the long flights of\naquatic birds kept flying from our left, we concluded that they were\nadvancing from their feeding-grounds on shore to pass the day in the\nlake, and accordingly headed the boat towards the quarter whence they\ncame, and began to paddle. Before long, however, a stiffish breeze\nsprang up, blowing directly in the direction we wanted, so we improvized\na sail with a blanket and the pole, which took us along merrily. This\ndone, we devoured the remnants of our biltong, washed down with the\nsweet lake water, and then lit our pipes and awaited whatever might turn\nup.\n\nWhen we had been sailing for an hour, Good, who was searching the\nhorizon with the spy-glass, suddenly announced joyfully that he saw\nland, and pointed out that, from the change in the colour of the water,\nhe thought we must be approaching the mouth of a river. In another\nminute we perceived a great golden dome, not unlike that of St Paul's,\npiercing the morning mists, and while we were wondering what in the\nworld it could be, Good reported another and still more important\ndiscovery, namely, that a small sailing-boat was advancing towards us.\nThis bit of news, which we were very shortly able to verify with our\nown eyes, threw us into a considerable flutter. That the natives of this\nunknown lake should understand the art of sailing seemed to suggest that\nthey possessed some degree of civilization. In a few more minutes it\nbecame evident that the occupant or occupants of the advancing boat\nhad made us out. For a moment or two she hung in the wind as though in\ndoubt, and then came tacking towards us with great swiftness. In ten\nmore minutes she was within a hundred yards, and we saw that she was a\nneat little boat--not a canoe 'dug out', but built more or less in the\nEuropean fashion with planks, and carrying a singularly large sail for\nher size. But our attention was soon diverted from the boat to her crew,\nwhich consisted of a man and a woman, _nearly as white as ourselves_.\n\nWe stared at each other in amazement, thinking that we must be mistaken;\nbut no, there was no doubt about it. They were not fair, but the two\npeople in the boat were decidedly of a white as distinguished from a\nblack race, as white, for instance, as Spaniards or Italians. It was a\npatent fact. So it was true, after all; and, mysteriously led by a Power\nbeyond our own, we had discovered this wonderful people. I could have\nshouted for joy when I thought of the glory and the wonder of the thing;\nand as it was, we all shook hands and congratulated each other on the\nunexpected success of our wild search. All my life had I heard rumours\nof a white race that existed in the highlands of this vast continent,\nand longed to put them to the proof, and now here I saw it with my own\neyes, and was dumbfounded. Truly, as Sir Henry said, the old Roman was\nright when he wrote 'Ex Africa semper aliquid novi', which he tells me\nmeans that out of Africa there always comes some new thing.\n\nThe man in the boat was of a good but not particularly fine physique,\nand possessed straight black hair, regular aquiline features, and an\nintelligent face. He was dressed in a brown cloth garment, something\nlike a flannel shirt without the sleeves, and in an unmistakable kilt of\nthe same material. The legs and feet were bare. Round the right arm and\nleft leg he wore thick rings of yellow metal that I judged to be gold.\nThe woman had a sweet face, wild and shy, with large eyes and curling\nbrown hair. Her dress was made of the same material as the man's, and\nconsisted, as we afterwards discovered, first of a linen under-garment\nthat hung down to her knee, and then of a single long strip of cloth,\nabout four feet wide by fifteen long, which was wound round the body in\ngraceful folds and finally flung over the left shoulder so that the end,\nwhich was dyed blue or purple or some other colour, according to the\nsocial standing of the wearer, hung down in front, the right arm\nand breast being, however, left quite bare. A more becoming dress,\nespecially when, as in the present case, the wearer was young and\npretty, it is quite impossible to conceive. Good (who has an eye for\nsuch things) was greatly struck with it, and so indeed was I. It was so\nsimple and yet so effective.\n\nMeanwhile, if we had been astonished at the appearance of the man and\nwoman, it was clear that they were far more astonished at us. As for the\nman, he appeared to be overcome with fear and wonder, and for a while\nhovered round our canoe, but would not approach. At last, however,\nhe came within hailing distance, and called to us in a language that\nsounded soft and pleasing enough, but of which we could not understand\none word. So we hailed back in English, French, Latin, Greek, German,\nZulu, Dutch, Sisutu, Kukuana, and a few other native dialects that I\nam acquainted with, but our visitor did not understand any of these\ntongues; indeed, they appeared to bewilder him. As for the lady, she\nwas busily employed in taking stock of us, and Good was returning the\ncompliment by staring at her hard through his eyeglass, a proceeding\nthat she seemed rather to enjoy than otherwise. At length, the man,\nbeing unable to make anything of us, suddenly turned his boat round and\nbegan to head off for the shore, his little boat skimming away before\nthe wind like a swallow. As she passed across our bows the man turned to\nattend to the large sail, and Good promptly took the opportunity to kiss\nhis hand to the young lady. I was horrified at this proceeding, both on\ngeneral grounds and because I feared that she might take offence, but\nto my delight she did not, for, first glancing round and seeing that her\nhusband, or brother, or whoever he was, was engaged, she promptly kissed\nhers back.\n\n'Ah!' said I. 'It seems that we have at last found a language that the\npeople of this country understand.'\n\n'In which case,' said Sir Henry, 'Good will prove an invaluable\ninterpreter.'\n\nI frowned, for I do not approve of Good's frivolities, and he knows\nit, and I turned the conversation to more serious subjects. 'It is very\nclear to me,' I said, 'that the man will be back before long with a host\nof his fellows, so we had best make up our minds as to how we are going\nto receive them.'\n\n'The question is how will they receive us?' said Sir Henry.\n\nAs for Good he made no remark, but began to extract a small square tin\ncase that had accompanied us in all our wanderings from under a pile of\nbaggage. Now we had often remonstrated with Good about this tin case,\ninasmuch as it had been an awkward thing to carry, and he had never\ngiven any very explicit account as to its contents; but he had insisted\non keeping it, saying mysteriously that it might come in very useful one\nday.\n\n'What on earth are you going to do, Good?' asked Sir Henry.\n\n'Do--why dress, of course! You don't expect me to appear in a new\ncountry in these things, do you?' and he pointed to his soiled and worn\ngarments, which were however, like all Good's things, very tidy, and\nwith every tear neatly mended.\n\nWe said no more, but watched his proceedings with breathless interest.\nHis first step was to get Alphonse, who was thoroughly competent in\nsuch matters, to trim his hair and beard in the most approved fashion.\nI think that if he had had some hot water and a cake of soap at hand\nhe would have shaved off the latter; but he had not. This done, he\nsuggested that we should lower the sail of the canoe and all take a\nbath, which we did, greatly to the horror and astonishment of Alphonse,\nwho lifted his hands and ejaculated that these English were indeed a\nwonderful people. Umslopogaas, who, though he was, like most high-bred\nZulus, scrupulously cleanly in his person, did not see the fun of\nswimming about in a lake, also regarded the proceeding with mild\namusement. We got back into the canoe much refreshed by the cold water,\nand sat to dry in the sun, whilst Good undid his tin box, and produced\nfirst a beautiful clean white shirt, just as it had left a London steam\nlaundry, and then some garments wrapped first in brown, then in white,\nand finally in silver paper. We watched this undoing with the tenderest\ninterest and much speculation. One by one Good removed the dull husks\nthat hid their splendours, carefully folding and replacing each piece\nof paper as he did so; and there at last lay, in all the majesty of its\ngolden epaulettes, lace, and buttons, a Commander of the Royal Navy's\nfull-dress uniform--dress sword, cocked hat, shiny patent leather boots\nand all. We literally gasped.\n\n'_What!_' we said, '_what!_ Are you going to put those things on?'\n\n'Certainly,' he answered composedly; 'you see so much depends upon a\nfirst impression, especially,' he added, 'as I observe that there are\nladies about. One at least of us ought to be decently dressed.'\n\nWe said no more; we were simply dumbfounded, especially when we\nconsidered the artful way in which Good had concealed the contents of\nthat box for all these months. Only one suggestion did we make--namely,\nthat he should wear his mail shirt next his skin. He replied that he\nfeared it would spoil the set of his coat, now carefully spread in the\nsun to take the creases out, but finally consented to this precautionary\nmeasure. The most amusing part of the affair, however, was to see\nold Umslopogaas's astonishment and Alphonse's delight at Good's\ntransformation. When at last he stood up in all his glory, even down to\nthe medals on his breast, and contemplated himself in the still waters\nof the lake, after the fashion of the young gentleman in ancient\nhistory, whose name I cannot remember, but who fell in love with his own\nshadow, the old Zulu could no longer restrain his feelings.\n\n'Oh, Bougwan!' he said. 'Oh, Bougwan! I always thought thee an ugly\nlittle man, and fat--fat as the cows at calving time; and now thou art\nlike a blue jay when he spreads his tail out. Surely, Bougwan, it hurts\nmy eyes to look at thee.'\n\nGood did not much like this allusion to his fat, which, to tell the\ntruth, was not very well deserved, for hard exercise had brought him\ndown three inches; but on the whole he was pleased at Umslopogaas's\nadmiration. As for Alphonse, he was quite delighted.\n\n'Ah! but Monsieur has the beautiful air--the air of the warrior. It\nis the ladies who will say so when we come to get ashore. Monsieur is\ncomplete; he puts me in mind of my heroic grand--'\n\nHere we stopped Alphonse.\n\nAs we gazed upon the beauties thus revealed by Good, a spirit of\nemulation filled our breasts, and we set to work to get ourselves up\nas well as we could. The most, however, that we were able to do was to\narray ourselves in our spare suits of shooting clothes, of which we\neach had several, all the fine clothes in the world could never make it\notherwise than scrubby and insignificant; but Sir Henry looked what he\nis, a magnificent man in his nearly new tweed suit, gaiters, and boots.\nAlphonse also got himself up to kill, giving an extra turn to his\nenormous moustaches. Even old Umslopogaas, who was not in a general way\ngiven to the vain adorning of his body, took some oil out of the lantern\nand a bit of tow, and polished up his head-ring with it till it shone\nlike Good's patent leather boots. Then he put on the mail shirt Sir\nHenry had given him and his 'moocha', and, having cleaned up Inkosi-kaas\na little, stood forth complete.\n\nAll this while, having hoisted the sail again as soon as we had finished\nbathing, we had been progressing steadily for the land, or, rather, for\nthe mouth of a great river. Presently--in all about an hour and a half\nafter the little boat had left us--we saw emerging from the river\nor harbour a large number of boats, ranging up to ten or twelve tons\nburden. One of these was propelled by twenty-four oars, and most of\nthe rest sailed. Looking through the glass we soon made out that the\nrow-boat was an official vessel, her crew being all dressed in a sort of\nuniform, whilst on the half-deck forward stood an old man of venerable\nappearance, and with a flowing white beard, and a sword strapped to his\nside, who was evidently the commander of the craft. The other boats were\napparently occupied by people brought out by curiosity, and were rowing\nor sailing towards us as quickly as they could.\n\n'Now for it,' said I. 'What is the betting? Are they going to be\nfriendly or to put an end to us?'\n\nNobody could answer this question, and, not liking the warlike\nappearance of the old gentleman and his sword, we felt a little anxious.\n\nJust then Good spied a school of hippopotami on the water about two\nhundred yards off us, and suggested that it would not be a bad plan to\nimpress the natives with a sense of our power by shooting some of them\nif possible. This, unluckily enough, struck us as a good idea, and\naccordingly we at once got out our eight-bore rifles, for which we still\nhad a few cartridges left, and prepared for action. There were four\nof the animals, a big bull, a cow, and two young ones, one three\nparts grown. We got up to them without difficulty, the great animals\ncontenting themselves with sinking down into the water and rising again\na few yards farther on; indeed, their excessive tameness struck me as\nbeing peculiar. When the advancing boats were about five hundred yards\naway, Sir Henry opened the ball by firing at the three parts grown young\none. The heavy bullet struck it fair between the eyes, and, crashing\nthrough the skull, killed it, and it sank, leaving a long train of blood\nbehind it. At the same moment I fired at the cow, and Good at the\nold bull. My shot took effect, but not fatally, and down went the\nhippopotamus with a prodigious splashing, only to rise again presently\nblowing and grunting furiously, dyeing all the water round her crimson,\nwhen I killed her with the left barrel. Good, who is an execrable shot,\nmissed the head of the bull altogether, the bullet merely cutting the\nside of his face as it passed. On glancing up, after I had fired my\nsecond shot, I perceived that the people we had fallen among were\nevidently ignorant of the nature of firearms, for the consternation\ncaused by our shots and their effect upon the animals was prodigious.\nSome of the parties in the boats began to cry out in fear; others turned\nand made off as hard as they could; and even the old gentleman with the\nsword looked greatly puzzled and alarmed, and halted his big row-boat.\nWe had, however, but little time for observation, for just then the old\nbull, rendered furious by the wound he had received, rose fair within\nforty yards of us, glaring savagely. We all fired, and hit him in\nvarious places, and down he went, badly wounded. Curiosity now began to\novercome the fear of the onlookers, and some of them sailed on up close\nto us, amongst these being the man and woman whom we had first seen a\ncouple of hours or so before, who drew up almost alongside. Just then\nthe great brute rose again within ten yards of their base, and instantly\nwith a roar of fury made at it open-mouthed. The woman shrieked, and the\nman tried to give the boat way, but without success. In another second\nI saw the huge red jaws and gleaming ivories close with a crunch on the\nfrail craft, taking an enormous mouthful out of its side and capsizing\nit. Down went the boat, leaving its occupants struggling in the water.\nNext moment, before we could do anything towards saving them, the huge\nand furious creature was up again and making open-mouthed at the poor\ngirl, who was struggling in the water. Lifting my rifle just as the\ngrinding jaws were about to close on her, I fired over her head right\ndown the hippopotamus's throat. Over he went, and commenced turning\nround and round, snorting, and blowing red streams of blood through his\nnostrils. Before he could recover himself, however, I let him have the\nother barrel in the side of the throat, and that finished him. He\nnever moved or struggled again, but instantly sank. Our next effort\nwas directed towards saving the girl, the man having swum off towards\nanother boat; and in this we were fortunately successful, pulling\nher into the canoe (amidst the shouts of the spectators) considerably\nexhausted and frightened, but otherwise unhurt.\n\nMeanwhile the boats had gathered together at a distance, and we could\nsee that the occupants, who were evidently much frightened,\nwere consulting what to do. Without giving them time for further\nconsideration, which we thought might result unfavourably to ourselves,\nwe instantly took our paddles and advanced towards them, Good standing\nin the bow and taking off his cocked hat politely in every direction,\nhis amiable features suffused by a bland but intelligent smile. Most of\nthe craft retreated as we advanced, but a few held their ground, while\nthe big row-boat came on to meet us. Presently we were alongside, and\nI could see that our appearance--and especially Good's and\nUmslopogaas's--filled the venerable-looking commander with astonishment,\nnot unmixed with awe. He was dressed after the same fashion as the man\nwe first met, except that his shirt was not made of brown cloth, but of\npure white linen hemmed with purple. The kilt, however, was identical,\nand so were the thick rings of gold around the arm and beneath the\nleft knee. The rowers wore only a kilt, their bodies being naked to\nthe waist. Good took off his hat to the old gentleman with an extra\nflourish, and inquired after his health in the purest English, to\nwhich he replied by laying the first two fingers of his right hand\nhorizontally across his lips and holding them there for a moment, which\nwe took as his method of salutation. Then he also addressed some\nremarks to us in the same soft accents that had distinguished our first\ninterviewer, which we were forced to indicate we did not understand by\nshaking our heads and shrugging our shoulders. This last Alphonse,\nbeing to the manner born, did to perfection, and in so polite a way that\nnobody could take any offence. Then we came a standstill, till I, being\nexceedingly hungry, thought I might as well call attention to the fact,\nand did so first by opening my mouth and pointing down it, and then\nrubbing my stomach. These signals the old gentleman clearly understood,\nfor he nodded his head vigorously, and pointed towards the harbour; and\nat the same time one of the men on his boat threw us a line and motioned\nto us to make it fast, which we did. The row-boat then took us in tow,\nand went with great rapidity towards the mouth of the river, accompanied\nby all the other boats. In about twenty minutes more we reached the\nentrance to the harbour, which was crowded with boats full of people who\nhad come out to see us. We observed that all the occupants were more or\nless of the same type, though some were fairer than others. Indeed, we\nnoticed certain ladies whose skin was of a most dazzling whiteness;\nand the darkest shade of colour which we saw was about that of a rather\nswarthy Spaniard. Presently the wide river gave a sweep, and when it did\nso an exclamation of astonishment and delight burst from our lips as we\ncaught our first view of the place that we afterwards knew as Milosis,\nor the Frowning City (from mi, which means city, and losis, a frown).\n\nAt a distance of some five hundred yards from the river's bank rose a\nsheer precipice of granite, two hundred feet or so in height, which had\nno doubt once formed the bank itself--the intermediate space of land\nnow utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining, and\ndeepening and embanking the stream.\n\nOn the brow of this precipice stood a great building of the same granite\nthat formed the cliff, built on three sides of a square, the fourth\nside being open, save for a kind of battlement pierced at its base by a\nlittle door. This imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace\nof the queen, or rather of the queens. At the back of the palace the\ntown sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble,\ncrowned by the golden dome which we had already observed. The city was,\nwith the exception of this one building, entirely built of red granite,\nand laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between. So far\nas we could see also the houses were all one-storied and detached, with\ngardens round them, which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the\nvista of red granite. At the back of the palace a road of extraordinary\nwidth stretched away up the hill for a distance of a mile and a half or\nso, and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming\nbuilding that crowned the hill. But right in front of us was the\nwonder and glory of Milosis--the great staircase of the palace, the\nmagnificence of which took our breath away. Let the reader imagine,\nif he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from balustrade to\nbalustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one hundred and\ntwenty-five steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad,\nconnected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and running from\nthe palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway\nor canal cut to its foot from the river. This marvellous staircase\nwas supported upon a single enormous granite arch, of which the\nresting-place between the two flights formed the crown; that is, the\nconnecting open space lay upon it. From this archway sprang a subsidiary\nflying arch, or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape,\nsuch as none of us had seen in any other country, and of which the\nbeauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined. Three hundred\nfeet from point to point, and no less than five hundred and fifty round\nthe curve, that half-arc soared touching the bridge it supported for a\nspace of fifty feet only, one end resting on and built into the parent\narchway, and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the\nprecipice.\n\nThis staircase with its supports was, indeed, a work of which any living\nman might have been proud, both on account of its magnitude and its\nsurpassing beauty. Four times, as we afterwards learnt, did the work,\nwhich was commenced in remote antiquity, fail, and was then abandoned\nfor three centuries when half-finished, till at last there rose a\nyouthful engineer named Rademas, who said that he would complete it\nsuccessfully, and staked his life upon it. If he failed he was to be\nhurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale; if he succeeded,\nhe was to be rewarded by the hand of the king's daughter. Five years was\ngiven to him to complete the work, and an unlimited supply of labour and\nmaterial. Three times did his arch fall, till at last, seeing failure\nto be inevitable, he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the\nthird collapse. That night, however, a beautiful woman came to him in a\ndream and touched his forehead, and of a sudden he saw a vision of the\ncompleted work, and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties\nconnected with the flying arch that had hitherto baffled his genius were\nto be overcome. Then he awoke and once more commenced the work, but on\na different plan, and behold! he achieved it, and on the last day of\nthe five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into\nthe palace. And in due course he became king by right of his wife, and\nfounded the present Zu-Vendi dynasty, which is to this day called the\n'House of the Stairway', thus proving once more how energy and talent\nare the natural stepping-stones to grandeur. And to commemorate his\ntriumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming, and of the fair woman\nwho touched him on the forehead, and placed it in the great hall of the\npalace, and there it stands to this day.\n\nSuch was the great stair of Milosis, and such the city beyond. No wonder\nthey named it the 'Frowning City', for certainly those mighty works in\nsolid granite did seem to frown down upon our littleness in their sombre\nsplendour. This was so even in the sunshine, but when the storm-clouds\ngathered on her imperial brow Milosis looked more like a supernatural\ndwelling-place, or some imagining of a poet's brain, than what she is--a\nmortal city, carven by the patient genius of generations out of the red\nsilence of the mountain side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII THE SISTER QUEENS\n\n\n\nThe big rowing-boat glided on up the cutting that ran almost to the foot\nof the vast stairway, and then halted at a flight of steps leading to\nthe landing-place. Here the old gentleman disembarked, and invited us to\ndo so likewise, which, having no alternative, and being nearly starved,\nwe did without hesitation--taking our rifles with us, however. As each\nof us landed, our guide again laid his fingers on his lips and bowed\ndeeply, at the same time ordering back the crowds which had assembled to\ngaze on us. The last to leave the canoe was the girl we had picked out\nof the water, for whom her companion was waiting. Before she went away\nshe kissed my hand, I suppose as a token of gratitude for having saved\nher from the fury of the hippopotamus; and it seemed to me that she had\nby this time quite got over any fear she might have had of us, and was\nby no means anxious to return in such a hurry to her lawful owners. At\nany rate, she was going to kiss Good's hand as well as mine, when the\nyoung man interfered and led her off. As soon as we were on shore, a\nnumber of the men who had rowed the big boat took possession of our few\ngoods and chattels, and started with them up the splendid staircase,\nour guide indicating to us by means of motions that the things were\nperfectly safe. This done, he turned to the right and led the way to\na small house, which was, as I afterwards discovered, an inn. Entering\ninto a good-sized room, we saw that a wooden table was already furnished\nwith food, presumably in preparation for us. Here our guide motioned\nus to be seated on a bench that ran the length of the table. We did\nnot require a second invitation, but at once fell to ravenously on the\nviands before us, which were served on wooden platters, and consisted\nof cold goat's-flesh, wrapped up in some kind of leaf that gave it a\ndelicious flavour, green vegetables resembling lettuces, brown bread,\nand red wine poured from a skin into horn mugs. This wine was peculiarly\nsoft and good, having something of the flavour of Burgundy. Twenty\nminutes after we sat down at that hospitable board we rose from it,\nfeeling like new men. After all that we had gone through we needed two\nthings, food and rest, and the food of itself was a great blessing to\nus. Two girls of the same charming cast of face as the first whom we had\nseen waited on us while we ate, and very nicely they did it. They were\nalso dressed in the same fashion namely, in a white linen petticoat\ncoming to the knee, and with the toga-like garment of brown cloth,\nleaving bare the right arm and breast. I afterwards found out that\nthis was the national dress, and regulated by an iron custom, though of\ncourse subject to variations. Thus, if the petticoat was pure white,\nit signified that the wearer was unmarried; if white, with a straight\npurple stripe round the edge, that she was married and a first or legal\nwife; if with a black stripe, that she was a widow. In the same way the\ntoga, or 'kaf', as they call it, was of different shades of colour, from\npure white to the deepest brown, according to the rank of the wearer,\nand embroidered at the end in various ways. This also applies to the\n'shirts' or tunics worn by the men, which varied in material and colour;\nbut the kilts were always the same except as regards quality. One\nthing, however, every man and woman in the country wore as the national\ninsignia, and that was the thick band of gold round the right arm above\nthe elbow, and the left leg beneath the knee. People of high rank also\nwore a torque of gold round the neck, and I observed that our guide had\none on.\n\nSo soon as we had finished our meal our venerable conductor, who had\nbeen standing all the while, regarding us with inquiring eyes, and our\nguns with something as like fear as his pride would allow him to show,\nbowed towards Good, whom he evidently took for the leader of the party\non account of the splendour of his apparel, and once more led the way\nthrough the door and to the foot of the great staircase. Here we paused\nfor a moment to admire two colossal lions, each hewn from a single block\nof pure black marble, and standing rampant on the terminations of\nthe wide balustrades of the staircase. These lions are magnificently\nexecuted, and it is said were sculptured by Rademas, the great prince\nwho designed the staircase, and who was without doubt, to judge from the\nmany beautiful examples of his art that we saw afterwards, one of the\nfinest sculptors who ever lived, either in this or any other country.\nThen we climbed almost with a feeling of awe up that splendid stair,\na work executed for all time and that will, I do not doubt, be admired\nthousands of years hence by generations unborn unless an earthquake\nshould throw it down. Even Umslopogaas, who as a general rule made it\na point of honour not to show astonishment, which he considered\nundignified, was fairly startled out of himself, and asked if the\n'bridge had been built by men or devils', which was his vague way of\nalluding to any supernatural power. But Alphonse did not care about it.\nIts solid grandeur jarred upon the frivolous little Frenchman, who said\nthat it was all 'tres magnifique, mais triste--ah, triste!' and went on\nto suggest that it would be improved if the balustrades were _gilt_.\n\nOn we went up the first flight of one hundred and twenty steps, across\nthe broad platform joining it to the second flight, where we paused\nto admire the glorious view of one of the most beautiful stretches of\ncountry that the world can show, edged by the blue waters of the lake.\nThen we passed on up the stair till at last we reached the top, where we\nfound a large standing space to which there were three entrances, all\nof small size. Two of these opened on to rather narrow galleries or\nroadways cut in the face of the precipice that ran round the palace\nwalls and led to the principal thoroughfares of the city, and were\nused by the inhabitants passing up and down from the docks. These were\ndefended by gates of bronze, and also, as we afterwards learnt, it was\npossible to let down a portion of the roadways themselves by withdrawing\ncertain bolts, and thus render it quite impracticable for an enemy\nto pass. The third entrance consisted of a flight of ten curved black\nmarble steps leading to a doorway cut in the palace wall. This wall was\nin itself a work of art, being built of huge blocks of granite to\nthe height of forty feet, and so fashioned that its face was concave,\nwhereby it was rendered practically impossible for it to be scaled. To\nthis doorway our guide led us. The door, which was massive, and made\nof wood protected by an outer gate of bronze, was closed; but on our\napproach it was thrown wide, and we were met by the challenge of a\nsentry, who was armed with a heavy triangular-bladed spear, not unlike a\nbayonet in shape, and a cutting sword, and protected by breast and back\nplates of skilfully prepared hippopotamus hide, and a small round shield\nfashioned of the same tough material. The sword instantly attracted our\nattention; it was practically identical with the one in the possession\nof Mr Mackenzie which he had obtained from the ill-starred wanderer.\nThere was no mistaking the gold-lined fretwork cut in the thickness of\nthe blade. So the man had told the truth after all. Our guide instantly\ngave a password, which the soldier acknowledged by letting the iron\nshaft of his spear fall with a ringing sound upon the pavement, and we\npassed on through the massive wall into the courtyard of the palace.\nThis was about forty yards square, and laid out in flower-beds full of\nlovely shrubs and plants, many of which were quite new to me. Through\nthe centre of this garden ran a broad walk formed of powdered shells\nbrought from the lake in the place of gravel. Following this we came\nto another doorway with a round heavy arch, which is hung with thick\ncurtains, for there are no doors in the palace itself. Then came another\nshort passage, and we were in the great hall of the palace, and once\nmore stood astonished at the simple and yet overpowering grandeur of the\nplace.\n\nThe hall is, as we afterwards learnt, one hundred and fifty feet long by\neighty wide, and has a magnificent arched roof of carved wood. Down\nthe entire length of the building there are on either side, and at a\ndistance of twenty feet from the wall, slender shafts of black marble\nspringing sheer to the roof, beautifully fluted, and with carved\ncapitals. At one end of this great place which these pillars support is\nthe group of which I have already spoken as executed by the King Rademas\nto commemorate his building of the staircase; and really, when we had\ntime to admire it, its loveliness almost struck us dumb. The group, of\nwhich the figures are in white, and the rest is black marble, is\nabout half as large again as life, and represents a young man of\nnoble countenance and form sleeping heavily upon a couch. One arm is\ncarelessly thrown over the side of this couch, and his head reposes upon\nthe other, its curling locks partially hiding it. Bending over him,\nher hand resting on his forehead, is a draped female form of such white\nloveliness as to make the beholder's breath stand still. And as for the\ncalm glory that shines upon her perfect face--well, I can never hope to\ndescribe it. But there it rests like the shadow of an angel's smile; and\npower, love, and divinity all have their part in it. Her eyes are fixed\nupon the sleeping youth, and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about\nthis beautiful work is the success with which the artist has succeeded\nin depicting on the sleeper's worn and weary face the sudden rising of\na new and spiritual thought as the spell begins to work within his mind.\nYou can see that an inspiration is breaking in upon the darkness of the\nman's soul as the dawn breaks in upon the darkness of night. It is a\nglorious piece of statuary, and none but a genius could have conceived\nit. Between each of the black marble columns is some such group of\nfigures, some allegorical, and some representing the persons and wives\nof deceased monarchs or great men; but none of them, in our opinion,\ncomes up to the one I have described, although several are from the hand of\nthe sculptor and engineer, King Rademas.\n\nIn the exact centre of the hall was a solid mass of black marble about\nthe size of a baby's arm-chair, which it rather resembled in appearance.\nThis, as we afterwards learnt, was the sacred stone of this remarkable\npeople, and on it their monarchs laid their hand after the ceremony\nof coronation, and swore by the sun to safeguard the interests of the\nempire, and to maintain its customs, traditions, and laws. This stone\nwas evidently exceedingly ancient (as indeed all stones are), and was\nscored down its sides with long marks or lines, which Sir Henry said\nproved it to have been a fragment that at some remote period in its\nhistory had been ground in the iron jaws of glaciers. There was a\ncurious prophecy about this block of marble, which was reported among\nthe people to have fallen from the sun, to the effect that when it was\nshattered into fragments a king of alien race should rule over the\nland. As the stone, however, looked remarkably solid, the native princes\nseemed to have a fair chance of keeping their own for many a long year.\n\nAt the end of the hall is a dais spread with rich carpets, on which\ntwo thrones are set side by side. These thrones are shaped like great\nchairs, and made of solid gold. The seats are richly cushioned, but\nthe backs are left bare, and on each is carved the emblem of the sun,\nshooting out his fiery rays in all directions. The footstools are golden\nlions couchant, with yellow topazes set in them for eyes. There are no\nother gems about them.\n\nThe place is lighted by numerous but narrow windows, placed high up,\ncut on the principle of the loopholes to be seen in ancient castles, but\ninnocent of glass, which was evidently unknown here.\n\nSuch is a brief description of this splendid hall in which we now found\nourselves, compiled of course from our subsequent knowledge of it.\nOn this occasion we had but little time for observation, for when we\nentered we perceived that a large number of men were gathered together\nin front of the two thrones, which were unoccupied. The principal among\nthem were seated on carved wooden chairs ranged to the right and the\nleft of the thrones, but not in front of them, and were dressed in white\ntunics, with various embroideries and different coloured edgings, and\narmed with the usual pierced and gold-inlaid swords. To judge from the\ndignity of their appearance, they seemed one and all to be individuals\nof very great importance. Behind each of these great men stood a small\nknot of followers and attendants.\n\nSeated by themselves, in a little group to the left of the throne, were\nsix men of a different stamp. Instead of wearing the ordinary kilt, they\nwere clothed in long robes of pure white linen, with the same symbol of\nthe sun that is to be seen on the back of the chairs, emblazoned in gold\nthread upon the breast. This garment was girt up at the waist with a\nsimple golden curb-like chain, from which hung long elliptic plates of\nthe same metal, fashioned in shiny scales like those of a fish, that, as\ntheir wearers moved, jingled and reflected the light. They were all men\nof mature age and of a severe and impressive cast of features, which was\nrendered still more imposing by the long beards they wore.\n\nThe personality of one individual among them, however, impressed us\nat once. He seemed to stand out among his fellows and refuse to be\noverlooked. He was very old--eighty at least--and extremely tall, with\na long snow-white beard that hung nearly to his waist. His features were\naquiline and deeply cut, and his eyes were grey and cold-looking. The\nheads of the others were bare, but this man wore a round cap entirely\ncovered with gold embroidery, from which we judged that he was a person\nof great importance; and indeed we afterwards discovered that he was\nAgon, the High Priest of the country. As we approached, all these men,\nincluding the priests, rose and bowed to us with the greatest courtesy,\nat the same time placing the two fingers across the lips in salutation.\nThen soft-footed attendants advanced from between the pillars, bearing\nseats, which were placed in a line in front of the thrones. We three sat\ndown, Alphonse and Umslopogaas standing behind us. Scarcely had we done\nso when there came a blare of trumpets from some passage to the right,\nand a similar blare from the left. Next a man with a long white wand\nof ivory appeared just in front of the right-hand throne, and cried out\nsomething in a loud voice, ending with the word _Nyleptha_, repeated\nthree times; and another man, similarly attired, called out a similar\nsentence before the other throne, but ending with the word _Sorais_,\nalso repeated thrice. Then came the tramp of armed men from each\nside entrance, and in filed about a score of picked and magnificently\naccoutred guards, who formed up on each side of the thrones, and let\ntheir heavy iron-handled spears fall simultaneously with a clash upon\nthe black marble flooring. Another double blare of trumpets, and in\nfrom either side, each attended by six maidens, swept the two Queens of\nZu-Vendis, everybody in the hall rising to greet them as they came.\n\nI have seen beautiful women in my day, and am no longer thrown into\ntransports at the sight of a pretty face; but language fails me when I\ntry to give some idea of the blaze of loveliness that then broke upon\nus in the persons of these sister Queens. Both were young--perhaps\nfive-and-twenty years of age--both were tall and exquisitely formed;\nbut there the likeness stopped. One, Nyleptha, was a woman of dazzling\nfairness; her right arm and breast bare, after the custom of her people,\nshowed like snow even against her white and gold-embroidered 'kaf', or\ntoga. And as for her sweet face, all I can say is, that it was one that\nfew men could look on and forget. Her hair, a veritable crown of gold,\nclustered in short ringlets over her shapely head, half hiding the ivory\nbrow, beneath which eyes of deep and glorious grey flashed out in tender\nmajesty. I cannot attempt to describe her other features, only the\nmouth was most sweet, and curved like Cupid's bow, and over the whole\ncountenance there shone an indescribable look of loving-kindness, lit\nup by a shadow of delicate humour that lay upon her face like a touch of\nsilver on a rosy cloud.\n\nShe wore no jewels, but on her neck, arm, and knee were the usual\ntorques of gold, in this instance fashioned like a snake; and her dress\nwas of pure white linen of excessive fineness, plentifully embroidered\nwith gold and with the familiar symbols of the sun.\n\nHer twin sister, Sorais, was of a different and darker type of beauty.\nHer hair was wavy like Nyleptha's but coal-black, and fell in masses\non her shoulders; her complexion was olive, her eyes large, dark, and\nlustrous; the lips were full, and I thought rather cruel. Somehow her\nface, quiet and even cold as it is, gave an idea of passion in repose,\nand caused one to wonder involuntarily what its aspect would be if\nanything occurred to break the calm. It reminded me of the deep sea,\nthat even on the bluest days never loses its visible stamp of power, and\nin its murmuring sleep is yet instinct with the spirit of the storm.\nHer figure, like her sister's, was almost perfect in its curves and\noutlines, but a trifle more rounded, and her dress was absolutely the\nsame.\n\nAs this lovely pair swept onwards to their respective thrones, amid the\ndeep attentive silence of the Court, I was bound to confess to myself\nthat they did indeed fulfil my idea of royalty. Royal they were in\nevery way--in form, in grace, and queenly dignity, and in the barbaric\nsplendour of their attendant pomp. But methought that they needed no\nguards or gold to proclaim their power and bind the loyalty of wayward\nmen. A glance from those bright eyes or a smile from those sweet lips,\nand while the red blood runs in the veins of youth women such as these\nwill never lack subjects ready to do their biddings to the death.\n\nBut after all they were women first and queens afterwards, and therefore\nnot devoid of curiosity. As they passed to their seats I saw both of\nthem glance swiftly in our direction. I saw, too, that their eyes passed\nby me, seeing nothing to charm them in the person of an insignificant\nand grizzled old man. Then they looked with evident astonishment on\nthe grim form of old Umslopogaas, who raised his axe in salutation.\nAttracted next by the splendour of Good's apparel, for a second their\nglance rested on him like a humming moth upon a flower, then off it\ndarted to where Sir Henry Curtis stood, the sunlight from a window\nplaying upon his yellow hair and peaked beard, and marking the outlines\nof his massive frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomy hall.\nHe raised his eyes, and they met the fair Nyleptha's full, and thus for\nthe first time the goodliest man and woman that it has ever been my lot\nto see looked one upon another. And why it was I know not, but I saw the\nswift blood run up Nyleptha's skin as the pink lights run up the morning\nsky. Red grew her fair bosom and shapely arm, red the swanlike neck; the\nrounded cheeks blushed red as the petals of a rose, and then the crimson\nflood sank back to whence it came and left her pale and trembling.\n\nI glanced at Sir Henry. He, too, had coloured up to the eyes.\n\n'Oh, my word!' thought I to myself, 'the ladies have come on the stage,\nand now we may look to the plot to develop itself.' And I sighed and\nshook my head, knowing that the beauty of a woman is like the beauty\nof the lightning--a destructive thing and a cause of desolation. By\nthe time that I had finished my reflections both the Queens were on the\nthrones, for all this had happened in about six seconds. Once more the\nunseen trumpets blared out, and then the Court seated itself, and Queen\nSorais motioned to us to do likewise.\n\nNext from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn stepped forward our\nguide, the old gentleman who had towed us ashore, holding by the\nhand the girl whom we had seen first and afterwards rescued from the\nhippopotamus. Having made obeisance he proceeded to address the Queens,\nevidently describing to them the way and place where we had been found.\nIt was most amusing to watch the astonishment, not unmixed with fear,\nreflected upon their faces as they listened to his tale. Clearly they\ncould not understand how we had reached the lake and been found floating\non it, and were inclined to attribute our presence to supernatural\ncauses. Then the narrative proceeded, as I judged from the frequent\nappeals that our guide made to the girl, to the point where we had shot\nthe hippopotami, and we at once perceived that there was something\nvery wrong about those hippopotami, for the history was frequently\ninterrupted by indignant exclamations from the little group of\nwhite-robed priests and even from the courtiers, while the two Queens\nlistened with an amazed expression, especially when our guide pointed to\nthe rifles in our hands as being the means of destruction. And here, to\nmake matters clear, I may as well explain at once that the inhabitants\nof Zu-Vendis are sun-worshippers, and that for some reason or another\nthe hippopotamus is sacred among them. Not that they do not kill it,\nbecause at a certain season of the year they slaughter thousands--which\nare specially preserved in large lakes up the country--and use their\nhides for armour for soldiers; but this does not prevent them from\nconsidering these animals as sacred to the sun. {Endnote 11} Now, as ill\nluck would have it, the particular hippopotami we had shot were a family\nof tame animals that were kept in the mouth of the port and daily fed by\npriests whose special duty it was to attend to them. When we shot them\nI thought that the brutes were suspiciously tame, and this was, as we\nafterwards ascertained, the cause of it. Thus it came about that in\nattempting to show off we had committed sacrilege of a most aggravated\nnature.\n\nWhen our guide had finished his tale, the old man with the long beard\nand round cap, whose appearance I have already described, and who was,\nas I have said, the High Priest of the country, and known by the name\nof Agon, rose and commenced an impassioned harangue. I did not like the\nlook of his cold grey eye as he fixed it on us. I should have liked it\nstill less had I known that in the name of the outraged majesty of his\ngod he was demanding that the whole lot of us should be offered up as a\nsacrifice by means of being burnt alive.\n\nAfter he had finished speaking the Queen Sorais addressed him in a soft\nand musical voice, and appeared, to judge from his gestures of dissent,\nto be putting the other side of the question before him. Then Nyleptha\nspoke in liquid accents. Little did we know that she was pleading for\nour lives. Finally, she turned and addressed a tall, soldierlike man of\nmiddle age with a black beard and a long plain sword, whose name, as\nwe afterwards learnt, was Nasta, and who was the greatest lord in the\ncountry; apparently appealing to him for support. Now when Sir Henry\nhad caught her eye and she had blushed so rosy red, I had seen that the\nincident had not escaped this man's notice, and, what is more, that\nit was eminently disagreeable to him, for he bit his lip and his\nhand tightened on his sword-hilt. Afterwards we learnt that he was an\naspirant for the hand of this Queen in marriage, which accounted for it.\nThis being so, Nyleptha could not have appealed to a worse person, for,\nspeaking in slow, heavy tones, he appeared to confirm all that the High\nPriest Agon had said. As he spoke, Sorais put her elbow on her knee,\nand, resting her chin on her hand, looked at him with a suppressed smile\nupon her lips, as though she saw through the man, and was determined to\nbe his match; but Nyleptha grew very angry, her cheek flushed, her eyes\nflashed, and she did indeed look lovely. Finally she turned to Agon and\nseemed to give some sort of qualified assent, for he bowed at her words;\nand as she spoke she moved her hands as though to emphasize what she\nsaid; while all the time Sorais kept her chin on her hand and smiled.\nThen suddenly Nyleptha made a sign, the trumpets blew again, and\neverybody rose to leave the hall save ourselves and the guards, whom she\nmotioned to stay.\n\nWhen they were all gone she bent forward and, smiling sweetly, partially\nby signs and partially by exclamations made it clear to us that she\nwas very anxious to know where we came from. The difficulty was how to\nexplain, but at last an idea struck me. I had my large pocket-book in\nmy pocket and a pencil. Taking it out, I made a little sketch of a lake,\nand then as best I could I drew the underground river and the lake\nat the other end. When I had done this I advanced to the steps of the\nthrone and gave it to her. She understood it at once and clapped her\nhands with delight, and then descending from the throne took it to her\nsister Sorais, who also evidently understood. Next she took the pencil\nfrom me, and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a\nseries of delightful little sketches, the first representing herself\nholding out both hands in welcome, and a man uncommonly like Sir Henry\ntaking them. Next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus\nrolling about dying in the water, and of an individual, in whom we had\nno difficulty in recognizing Agon the High Priest, holding up his\nhands in horror on the bank. Then followed a most alarming picture of a\ndreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure, Agon, poking us into it\nwith a forked stick. This picture perfectly horrified me, but I was a\nlittle reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth\ndrawing--a man again uncommonly like Sir Henry, and of two women, in\nwhom I recognized Sorais and herself, each with one arm around him, and\nholding a sword in protection over him. To all of these Sorais, who\nI saw was employed in carefully taking us all in--especially\nCurtis--signified her approval by nodding.\n\nAt last Nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rising sun, indicating that\nshe must go, and that we should meet on the following morning; whereat\nSir Henry looked so disappointed that she saw it, and, I suppose by\nway of consolation, extended her hand to him to kiss, which he did with\npious fervour. At the same time Sorais, off whom Good had never taken\nhis eyeglass during the whole indaba [interview], rewarded him by giving\nhim her hand to kiss, though, while she did so, her eyes were fixed\nupon Sir Henry. I am glad to say that I was not implicated in these\nproceedings; neither of them gave _me_ her hand to kiss.\n\nThen Nyleptha turned and addressed the man who appeared to be in\ncommand of the bodyguard, apparently from her manner and his frequent\nobeisances, giving him very stringent and careful orders; after which,\nwith a somewhat coquettish nod and smile, she left the hall, followed by\nSorais and most of the guards.\n\nWhen the Queens had gone, the officer whom Nyleptha had addressed\ncame forward and with many tokens of deep respect led us from the hall\nthrough various passages to a sumptuous set of apartments opening out of\na large central room lighted with brazen swinging lamps (for it was now\ndusk) and richly carpeted and strewn with couches. On a table in the\ncentre of the room was set a profusion of food and fruit, and, what is\nmore, flowers. There was a delicious wine also in ancient-looking sealed\nearthenware flagons, and beautifully chased golden and ivory cups to\ndrink it from. Servants, male and female, also were there to minister to\nus, and whilst we ate, from some recess outside the apartment\n\n\n   'The silver lute did speak between\n    The trumpet's lordly blowing;'\n\n\nand altogether we found ourselves in a sort of earthly paradise which\nwas only disturbed by the vision of that disgusting High Priest who\nintended to commit us to the flames. But so very weary were we with\nour labours that we could scarcely keep ourselves awake through the\nsumptuous meal, and as soon as it was over we indicated that we desired\nto sleep. As a further precaution against surprise we left Umslopogaas\nwith his axe to sleep in the main chamber near the curtained doorways\nleading to the apartments which we occupied respectively, Good and I in\nthe one, and Sir Henry and Alphonse in the other. Then throwing off our\nclothes, with the exception of the mail shirts, which we considered it\nsafer to keep on, we flung ourselves down upon the low and luxurious\ncouches, and drew the silk-embroidered coverlids over us.\n\nIn two minutes I was just dropping off when I was aroused by Good's\nvoice.\n\n'I say, Quatermain,' he said, 'did you ever see such eyes?'\n\n'Eyes!' I said, crossly; 'what eyes?'\n\n'Why, the Queen's, of course! Sorais, I mean--at least I think that is\nher name.'\n\n'Oh, I don't know,' I yawned; 'I didn't notice them much: I suppose they\nare good eyes,' and again I dropped off.\n\nFive minutes or so elapsed, and I was once more awakened.\n\n'I say, Quatermain,' said the voice.\n\n'Well,' I answered testily, 'what is it now?'\n\n'Did you notice her ankle? The shape--'\n\nThis was more than I could stand. By my bed stood the veldtschoons I had\nbeen wearing. Moved quite beyond myself, I took them up and threw them\nstraight at Good's head--and hit it.\n\nAfterwards I slept the sleep of the just, and a very heavy sleep it must\nbe. As for Good, I don't know if he went to sleep or if he continued to\npass Sorais' beauties in mental review, and, what is more, I don't care.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII ABOUT THE ZU-VENDI PEOPLE\n\n\n\nAnd now the curtain is down for a few hours, and the actors in this\nnovel drama are plunged in dewy sleep. Perhaps we should except\nNyleptha, whom the reader may, if poetically inclined, imagine lying in\nher bed of state encompassed by her maidens, tiring women, guards, and\nall the other people and appurtenances that surround a throne, and yet\nnot able to slumber for thinking of the strangers who had visited a\ncountry where no such strangers had ever come before, and wondering, as\nshe lay awake, who they were and what their past has been, and if she\nwas ugly compared to the women of their native place. I, however, not\nbeing poetically inclined, will take advantage of the lull to give some\naccount of the people among whom we found ourselves, compiled, needless\nto state, from information which we subsequently collected.\n\nThe name of this country, to begin at the beginning, is Zu-Vendis,\nfrom Zu, 'yellow', and Vendis, 'place or country'. Why it is called the\nYellow Country I have never been able to ascertain accurately, nor do\nthe inhabitants themselves know. Three reasons are, however, given, each\nof which would suffice to account for it. The first is that the name\nowes its origin to the great quantity of gold that is found in the land.\nIndeed, in this respect Zu-Vendis is a veritable Eldorado, the precious\nmetal being extraordinarily plentiful. At present it is collected from\npurely alluvial diggings, which we subsequently inspected, and which\nare situated within a day's journey from Milosis, being mostly found in\npockets and in nuggets weighing from an ounce up to six or seven pounds\nin weight. But other diggings of a similar nature are known to exist,\nand I have besides seen great veins of gold-bearing quartz. In Zu-Vendis\ngold is a much commoner metal than silver, and thus it has curiously\nenough come to pass that silver is the legal tender of the country.\n\nThe second reason given is, that at certain times of the year the native\ngrasses of the country, which are very sweet and good, turn as yellow\nas ripe corn; and the third arises from a tradition that the people\nwere originally yellow skinned, but grew white after living for many\ngenerations upon these high lands. Zu-Vendis is a country about the size\nof France, is, roughly speaking, oval in shape; and on every side\ncut off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of\nimpenetrable thorn, beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of\nmorasses, deserts, and great mountains. It is, in short, a huge, high\ntableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent, much as\nin southern Africa flat-topped mountains rise from the level of the\nsurrounding veldt. Milosis itself lies, according to my aneroid, at a\nlevel of about nine thousand feet above the sea, but most of the land\nis even higher, the greatest elevation of the open country being, I\nbelieve, about eleven thousand feet. As a consequence the climate\nis, comparatively speaking, a cold one, being very similar to that of\nsouthern England, only brighter and not so rainy. The land is, however,\nexceedingly fertile, and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and\ntimber to perfection; and in the lower-lying parts even produces a hardy\nvariety of sugar-cane. Coal is found in great abundance, and in many\nplaces crops out from the surface; and so is pure marble, both black and\nwhite. The same may be said of almost every metal except silver, which\nis scarce, and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the\nnorth.\n\nZu-Vendis comprises in her boundaries a great variety of scenery,\nincluding two ranges of snow-clad mountains, one on the western boundary\nbeyond the impenetrable belt of thorn forest, and the other piercing the\ncountry from north to south, and passing at a distance of about eighty\nmiles from Milosis, from which town its higher peaks are distinctly\nvisible. This range forms the chief watershed of the land. There are\nalso three large lakes--the biggest, namely that whereon we emerged, and\nwhich is named Milosis after the city, covering some two hundred square\nmiles of country--and numerous small ones, some of them salt.\n\nThe population of this favoured land is, comparatively speaking, dense,\nnumbering at a rough estimate from ten to twelve millions. It is almost\npurely agricultural in its habits, and divided into great classes as\nin civilized countries. There is a territorial nobility, a considerable\nmiddle class, formed principally of merchants, officers of the army,\netc.; but the great bulk of the people are well-to-do peasants who live\nupon the lands of the lords, from whom they hold under a species of\nfeudal tenure. The best bred people in the country are, as I think I\nhave said, pure whites with a somewhat southern cast of countenance; but\nthe common herd are much darker, though they do not show any negro or\nother African characteristics. As to their descent I can give no certain\ninformation. Their written records, which extend back for about a\nthousand years, give no hint of it. One very ancient chronicler does\nindeed, in alluding to some old tradition that existed in his day, talk\nof it as having probably originally 'come down with the people from the\ncoast', but that may mean little or nothing. In short, the origin of the\nZu-Vendi is lost in the mists of time. Whence they came or of what race\nthey are no man knows. Their architecture and some of their sculptures\nsuggest an Egyptian or possibly an Assyrian origin; but it is well\nknown that their present remarkable style of building has only sprung up\nwithin the last eight hundred years, and they certainly retain no traces\nof Egyptian theology or customs. Again, their appearance and some\nof their habits are rather Jewish; but here again it seems hardly\nconceivable that they should have utterly lost all traces of the Jewish\nreligion. Still, for aught I know, they may be one of the lost ten\ntribes whom people are so fond of discovering all over the world, or\nthey may not. I do not know, and so can only describe them as I find\nthem, and leave wiser heads than mine to make what they can out of it,\nif indeed this account should ever be read at all, which is exceedingly\ndoubtful.\n\nAnd now after I have said all this, I am, after all, going to hazard a\ntheory of my own, though it is only a very little one, as the young lady\nsaid in mitigation of her baby. This theory is founded on a legend which\nI have heard among the Arabs on the east coast, which is to the effect\nthat 'more than two thousand years ago' there were troubles in the\ncountry which was known as Babylonia, and that thereon a vast horde of\nPersians came down to Bushire, where they took ship and were driven by\nthe north-east monsoon to the east coast of Africa, where, according to\nthe legend, 'the sun and fire worshippers' fell into conflict with the\nbelt of Arab settlers who even then were settled on the east coast, and\nfinally broke their way through them, and, vanishing into the interior,\nwere no more seen. Now, I ask, is it not at least possible that the\nZu-Vendi people are the descendants of these 'sun and fire worshippers'\nwho broke through the Arabs and vanished? As a matter of fact, there\nis a good deal in their characters and customs that tallies with the\nsomewhat vague ideas that I have of Persians. Of course we have no books\nof reference here, but Sir Henry says that if his memory does not fail\nhim, there was a tremendous revolt in Babylon about 500 BC, whereon\na vast multitude were expelled from the city. Anyhow, it is a\nwell-established fact that there have been many separate emigrations\nof Persians from the Persian Gulf to the east coast of Africa up to as\nlately as seven hundred years ago. There are Persian tombs at Kilwa, on\nthe east coast, still in good repair, which bear dates showing them to\nbe just seven hundred years old. {Endnote 12}\n\nIn addition to being an agricultural people, the Zu-Vendi are, oddly\nenough, excessively warlike, and as they cannot from the exigencies of\ntheir position make war upon other nations, they fight among each other\nlike the famed Kilkenny cats, with the happy result that the population\nnever outgrows the power of the country to support it. This habit of\ntheirs is largely fostered by the political condition of the country.\nThe monarchy is nominally an absolute one, save in so far as it is\ntempered by the power of the priests and the informal council of the\ngreat lords; but, as in many other institutions, the king's writ does\nnot run unquestioned throughout the length and breadth of the land. In\nshort, the whole system is a purely feudal one (though absolute serfdom\nor slavery is unknown), all the great lords holding nominally from the\nthrone, but a number of them being practically independent, having the\npower of life and death, waging war against and making peace with\ntheir neighbours as the whim or their interests lead them, and even\non occasion rising in open rebellion against their royal master or\nmistress, and, safely shut up in their castles and fenced cities, as far\nfrom the seat of government, successfully defying them for years.\n\nZu-Vendis has had its king-makers as well as England, a fact that will\nbe well appreciated when I state that eight different dynasties have sat\nupon the throne in the last one thousand years, every one of which took\nits rise from some noble family that succeeded in grasping the purple\nafter a sanguinary struggle. At the date of our arrival in the country\nthings were a little better than they had been for some centuries,\nthe last king, the father of Nyleptha and Sorais, having been an\nexceptionally able and vigorous ruler, and, as a consequence, he kept\ndown the power of the priests and nobles. On his death, two years before\nwe reached Zu-Vendis, the twin sisters, his children, were, following\nan ancient precedent, called to the throne, since an attempt to exclude\neither would instantly have provoked a sanguinary civil war; but it\nwas generally felt in the country that this measure was a most\nunsatisfactory one, and could hardly be expected to be permanent.\nIndeed, as it was, the various intrigues that were set on foot by\nambitious nobles to obtain the hand of one or other of the queens in\nmarriage had disquieted the country, and the general opinion was that\nthere would be bloodshed before long.\n\nI will now pass on to the question of the Zu-Vendi religion, which\nis nothing more or less than sun-worship of a pronounced and highly\ndeveloped character. Around this sun-worship is grouped the entire\nsocial system of the Zu-Vendi. It sends its roots through every\ninstitution and custom of the land. From the cradle to the grave the\nZu-Vendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying. As an infant he\nis solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to 'the symbol of\ngood, the expression of power, and the hope of Eternity', the ceremony\nanswering to our baptism. Whilst still a tiny child, his parents point\nout the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god,\nand he worships it at its up-rising and down-setting. Then when still\nquite small, he goes, holding fast to the pendent end of his mother's\n'kaf' (toga), up to the temple of the Sun of the nearest city, and\nthere, when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden\ncentral altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon, he hears the\nwhite-robed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the\npeople fall down to adore, and then, amidst the blowing of the golden\ntrumpets, watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath\nthe altar. Here he comes again to be declared 'a man' by the priests,\nand consecrated to war and to good works; here before the solemn altar\nhe leads his bride; and here too, if differences shall unhappily arise,\nhe divorces her.\n\nAnd so on, down life's long pathway till the last mile is travelled, and\nhe comes again armed indeed, and with dignity, but no longer a man. Here\nthey bear him dead and lay his bier upon the falling brazen doors before\nthe eastern altar, and when the last ray from the setting sun falls\nupon his white face the bolts are drawn and he vanishes into the raging\nfurnace beneath and is ended.\n\nThe priests of the Sun do not marry, but are recruited as young men\nspecially devoted to the work by their parents and supported by the\nState. The nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with\nthe Crown, but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed, and\nit is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land. To begin\nwith, they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy, so that\nan order issued by the High Priest at Milosis will be instantly and\nunhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country\ntown three or four hundred miles off. They are the judges of the land,\ncriminal and civil, an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of\nthe district, and from him to the king; and they have, of course,\npractically unlimited jurisdiction over religious and moral offences,\ntogether with a right of excommunication, which, as in the faiths of\nmore highly civilized lands, is a very effective weapon. Indeed, their\nrights and powers are almost unlimited, but I may as well state here\nthat the priests of the Sun are wise in their generation, and do not\npush things too far. It is but very seldom that they go to extremes\nagainst anybody, being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of\nmercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorous-minded\npeople on whose neck they have set their yoke, lest it should rise and\nbreak it off altogether.\n\nAnother source of the power of the priests is their practical monopoly\nof learning, and their very considerable astronomical knowledge, which\nenables them to keep a hold on the popular mind by predicting eclipses\nand even comets. In Zu-Vendis only a few of the upper classes can read\nand write, but nearly all the priests have this knowledge, and are\ntherefore looked upon as learned men.\n\nThe law of the country is, on the whole, mild and just, but differs\nin several respects from our civilized law. For instance, the law of\nEngland is much more severe upon offences against property than against\nthe person, as becomes a people whose ruling passion is money. A man\nmay half kick his wife to death or inflict horrible sufferings upon his\nchildren at a much cheaper rate of punishment than he can compound for\nthe theft of a pair of old boots. In Zu-Vendis this is not so, for there\nthey rightly or wrongly look upon the person as of more consequence\nthan goods and chattels, and not, as in England, as a sort of necessary\nappendage to the latter. For murder the punishment is death, for treason\ndeath, for defrauding the orphan and the widow, for sacrilege, and\nfor attempting to quit the country (which is looked on as a sacrilege)\ndeath. In each case the method of execution is the same, and a rather\nawful one. The culprit is thrown alive into the fiery furnace beneath\none of the altars to the Sun. For all other offences, including the\noffence of idleness, the punishment is forced labour upon the vast\nnational buildings which are always going on in some part of the\ncountry, with or without periodical floggings, according to the crime.\n\nThe social system of the Zu-Vendi allows considerable liberty to the\nindividual, provided he does not offend against the laws and customs\nof the country. They are polygamous in theory, though most of them\nhave only one wife on account of the expense. By law a man is bound to\nprovide a separate establishment for each wife. The first wife also is\nthe legal wife, and her children are said to be 'of the house of the\nFather'. The children of the other wives are of the houses of their\nrespective mothers. This does not, however, imply any slur upon either\nmother or children. Again, a first wife can, on entering into the\nmarried state, make a bargain that her husband shall marry no other\nwife. This, however, is very rarely done, as the women are the great\nupholders of polygamy, which not only provides for their surplus numbers\nbut gives greater importance to the first wife, who is thus practically\nthe head of several households. Marriage is looked upon as primarily\na civil contract, and, subject to certain conditions and to a proper\nprovision for children, is dissoluble at the will of both contracting\nparties, the divorce, or 'unloosing', being formally and ceremoniously\naccomplished by going through certain portions of the marriage ceremony\nbackwards.\n\nThe Zu-Vendi are on the whole a very kindly, pleasant, and light-hearted\npeople. They are not great traders and care little about money, only\nworking to earn enough to support themselves in that class of life in\nwhich they were born. They are exceedingly conservative, and look with\ndisfavour upon changes. Their legal tender is silver, cut into little\nsquares of different weights; gold is the baser coin, and is about\nof the same value as our silver. It is, however, much prized for its\nbeauty, and largely used for ornaments and decorative purposes. Most of\nthe trade, however, is carried on by means of sale and barter, payment\nbeing made in kind. Agriculture is the great business of the country,\nand is really well understood and carried out, most of the available\nacreage being under cultivation. Great attention is also given to the\nbreeding of cattle and horses, the latter being unsurpassed by any I\nhave ever seen either in Europe or Africa.\n\nThe land belongs theoretically to the Crown, and under the Crown to the\ngreat lords, who again divide it among smaller lords, and so on down\nto the little peasant farmer who works his forty 'reestu' (acres) on a\nsystem of half-profits with his immediate lord. In fact the whole system\nis, as I have said, distinctly feudal, and it interested us much to meet\nwith such an old friend far in the unknown heart of Africa.\n\nThe taxes are very heavy. The State takes a third of a man's total\nearnings, and the priesthood about five per cent on the remainder.\nBut on the other hand, if a man through any cause falls into bona fide\nmisfortune the State supports him in the position of life to which he\nbelongs. If he is idle, however, he is sent to work on the Government\nundertakings, and the State looks after his wives and children. The\nState also makes all the roads and builds all town houses, about which\ngreat care is shown, letting them out to families at a small rent. It\nalso keeps up a standing army of about twenty thousand men, and provides\nwatchmen, etc. In return for their five per cent the priests attend to\nthe service of the temples, carry out all religious ceremonies, and keep\nschools, where they teach whatever they think desirable, which is\nnot very much. Some of the temples also possess private property, but\npriests as individuals cannot hold property.\n\nAnd now comes a question which I find some difficulty in answering. Are\nthe Zu-Vendi a civilized or barbarous people? Sometimes I think the one,\nsometimes the other. In some branches of art they have attained the\nvery highest proficiency. Take for instance their buildings and their\nstatuary. I do not think that the latter can be equalled either in\nbeauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world, and as for the former\nit may have been rivalled in ancient Egypt, but I am sure that it has\nnever been since. But, on the other hand, they are totally ignorant of\nmany other arts. Till Sir Henry, who happened to know something about\nit, showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime, they could\nnot make a piece of glass, and their crockery is rather primitive. A\nwater-clock is their nearest approach to a watch; indeed, ours delighted\nthem exceedingly. They know nothing about steam, electricity, or\ngunpowder, and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the\npenny post. Thus they are spared many evils, for of a truth our age has\nlearnt the wisdom of the old-world saying, 'He who increaseth knowledge,\nincreaseth sorrow.'\n\nAs regards their religion, it is a natural one for imaginative people\nwho know no better, and might therefore be expected to turn to the\nsun and worship him as the all-Father, but it cannot justly be called\nelevating or spiritual. It is true that they do sometimes speak of the\nsun as the 'garment of the Spirit', but it is a vague term, and what\nthey really adore is the fiery orb himself. They also call him the 'hope\nof eternity', but here again the meaning is vague, and I doubt if the\nphrase conveys any very clear impression to their minds. Some of them\ndo indeed believe in a future life for the good--I know Nyleptha does\nfirmly--but it is a private faith arising from the promptings of the\nspirit, not an essential of their creed. So on the whole I cannot say\nthat I consider this sun-worship as a religion indicative of a civilized\npeople, however magnificent and imposing its ritual, or however moral\nand high-sounding the maxims of its priests, many of whom, I am sure,\nhave their own opinions on the whole subject; though of course they have\nnothing but praise for a system which provides them with so many of the\ngood things of this world.\n\nThere are now only two more matters to which I need allude--namely,\nthe language and the system of calligraphy. As for the former, it is\nsoft-sounding, and very rich and flexible. Sir Henry says that it sounds\nsomething like modern Greek, but of course it has no connection with it.\nIt is easy to acquire, being simple in its construction, and a peculiar\nquality about it is its euphony, and the way in which the sound of\nthe words adapts itself to the meaning to be expressed. Long before we\nmastered the language, we could frequently make out what was meant by\nthe ring of the sentence. It is on this account that the language lends\nitself so well to poetical declamation, of which these remarkable\npeople are very fond. The Zu-Vendi alphabet seems, Sir Henry says, to\nbe derived, like every other known system of letters, from a Phoenician\nsource, and therefore more remotely still from the ancient Egyptian\nhieratic writing. Whether this is a fact I cannot say, not being learned\nin such matters. All I know about it is that their alphabet consists of\ntwenty-two characters, of which a few, notably B, E, and O, are not\nvery unlike our own. The whole affair is, however, clumsy and puzzling.\n{Endnote 13} But as the people of Zu-Vendi are not given to the writing\nof novels, or of anything except business documents and records of the\nbriefest character, it answers their purpose well enough.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV THE FLOWER TEMPLE\n\n\n\nIt was half-past eight by my watch when I woke on the morning following\nour arrival at Milosis, having slept almost exactly twelve hours, and\nI must say that I did indeed feel better. Ah, what a blessed thing is\nsleep! and what a difference twelve hours of it or so makes to us after\ndays and nights of toil and danger. It is like going to bed one man and\ngetting up another.\n\nI sat up upon my silken couch--never had I slept upon such a bed\nbefore--and the first thing that I saw was Good's eyeglass fixed on me\nfrom the recesses of his silken couch. There was nothing else of him to\nbe seen except his eyeglass, but I knew from the look of it that he was\nawake, and waiting till I woke up to begin.\n\n'I say, Quatermain,' he commenced sure enough, 'did you observe her\nskin? It is as smooth as the back of an ivory hairbrush.'\n\n'Now look here, Good,' I remonstrated, when there came a sound at the\ncurtain, which, on being drawn, admitted a functionary, who signified by\nsigns that he was there to lead us to the bath. We gladly consented, and\nwere conducted to a delightful marble chamber, with a pool of running\ncrystal water in the centre of it, into which we gaily plunged. When we\nhad bathed, we returned to our apartment and dressed, and then went into\nthe central room where we had supped on the previous evening, to find a\nmorning meal already prepared for us, and a capital meal it was, though\nI should be puzzled to describe the dishes. After breakfast we lounged\nround and admired the tapestries and carpets and some pieces of statuary\nthat were placed about, wondering the while what was going to happen\nnext. Indeed, by this time our minds were in such a state of complete\nbewilderment that we were, as a matter of fact, ready for anything\nthat might arrive. As for our sense of astonishment, it was pretty well\nobliterated. Whilst we were still thus engaged, our friend the captain\nof the guard presented himself, and with many obeisances signified\nthat we were to follow him, which we did, not without doubts and\nheart-searchings--for we guessed that the time had come when we should\nhave to settle the bill for those confounded hippopotami with our\ncold-eyed friend Agon, the High Priest. However, there was no help for\nit, and personally I took great comfort in the promise of the protection\nof the sister Queens, knowing that if ladies have a will they can\ngenerally find a way; so off we started as though we liked it. A\nminute's walk through a passage and an outer court brought us to the\ngreat double gates of the palace that open on to the wide highway which\nruns uphill through the heart of Milosis to the Temple of the Sun a mile\naway, and thence down the slope on the farther side of the temple to the\nouter wall of the city.\n\nThese gates are very large and massive, and an extraordinarily beautiful\nwork in metal. Between them--for one set is placed at the entrance to an\ninterior, and one at that of the exterior wall--is a fosse, forty-five\nfeet in width. This fosse is filled with water and spanned by a\ndrawbridge, which when lifted makes the palace nearly impregnable to\nanything except siege guns. As we came, one half of the wide gates were\nflung open, and we passed over the drawbridge and presently stood gazing\nup one of the most imposing, if not the most imposing, roadways in the\nworld. It is a hundred feet from curb to curb, and on either side,\nnot cramped and crowded together, as is our European fashion, but each\nstanding in its own grounds, and built equidistant from and in similar\nstyle to the rest, are a series of splendid, single-storied mansions,\nall of red granite. These are the town houses of the nobles of the\nCourt, and stretch away in unbroken lines for a mile or more till the\neye is arrested by the glorious vision of the Temple of the Sun that\ncrowns the hill and heads the roadway.\n\nAs we stood gazing at this splendid sight, of which more anon, there\nsuddenly dashed up to the gateway four chariots, each drawn by two\nwhite horses. These chariots are two-wheeled, and made of wood. They are\nfitted with a stout pole, the weight of which is supported by leathern\ngirths that form a portion of the harness. The wheels are made with four\nspokes only, are tired with iron, and quite innocent of springs. In the\nfront of the chariot, and immediately over the pole, is a small seat for\nthe driver, railed round to prevent him from being jolted off. Inside\nthe machine itself are three low seats, one at each side, and one with\nthe back to the horses, opposite to which is the door. The whole vehicle\nis lightly and yet strongly made, and, owing to the grace of the curves,\nthough primitive, not half so ugly as might be expected.\n\nBut if the chariots left something to be desired, the horses did not.\nThey were simply splendid, not very large but strongly built, and well\nribbed up, with small heads, remarkably large and round hoofs, and a\ngreat look of speed and blood. I have often wondered whence this breed,\nwhich presents many distinct characteristics, came, but like that of its\nowners, it history is obscure. Like the people the horses have always\nbeen there. The first and last of these chariots were occupied by\nguards, but the centre two were empty, except for the driver, and to\nthese we were conducted. Alphonse and I got into the first, and Sir\nHenry, Good, and Umslopogaas into the one behind, and then suddenly\noff we went. And we did go! Among the Zu-Vendi it is not usual to trot\nhorses either riding or driving, especially when the journey to be made\nis a short one--they go at full gallop. As soon as we were seated the\ndriver called out, the horses sprang forward, and we were whirled\naway at a speed sufficient to take one's breath, and which, till I got\naccustomed to it, kept me in momentary fear of an upset. As for the\nwretched Alphonse, he clung with a despairing face to the side of what\nhe called this 'devil of a fiacre', thinking that every moment was his\nlast. Presently it occurred to him to ask where we were going, and\nI told him that, as far as I could ascertain, we were going to be\nsacrificed by burning. You should have seen his face as he grasped the\nside of the vehicle and cried out in his terror.\n\nBut the wild-looking charioteer only leant forward over his flying\nsteeds and shouted; and the air, as it went singing past, bore away the\nsound of Alphonse's lamentations.\n\nAnd now before us, in all its marvellous splendour and dazzling\nloveliness, shone out the Temple of the Sun--the peculiar pride of the\nZu-Vendi, to whom it was what Solomon's, or rather Herod's, Temple was\nto the Jews. The wealth, and skill, and labour of generations had been\ngiven to the building of this wonderful place, which had been only\nfinally completed within the last fifty years. Nothing was spared that\nthe country could produce, and the result was indeed worthy of the\neffort, not so much on account of its size--for there are larger fanes\nin the world--as because of its perfect proportions, the richness and\nbeauty of its materials, and the wonderful workmanship. The building\n(that stands by itself on a space of some eight acres of garden ground\non the hilltop, around which are the dwelling-places of the priests)\nis built in the shape of a sunflower, with a dome-covered central hall,\nfrom which radiate twelve petal-shaped courts, each dedicated to one of\nthe twelve months, and serving as the repositories of statues reared in\nmemory of the illustrious dead. The width of the circle beneath the dome\nis three hundred feet, the height of the dome is four hundred feet, and\nthe length of the rays is one hundred and fifty feet, and the height of\ntheir roofs three hundred feet, so that they run into the central dome\nexactly as the petals of the sunflower run into the great raised heart.\nThus the exact measurement from the centre of the central altar to the\nextreme point of any one of the rounded rays would be three hundred feet\n(the width of the circle itself), or a total of six hundred feet from\nthe rounded extremity of one ray or petal to the extremity of the\nopposite one. {Endnote 14}\n\nThe building itself is of pure and polished white marble, which shows\nout in marvellous contrast to the red granite of the frowning city, on\nwhose brow it glistens indeed like an imperial diadem upon the forehead\nof a dusky queen. The outer surface of the dome and of the twelve petal\ncourts is covered entirely with thin sheets of beaten gold; and from the\nextreme point of the roof of each of these petals a glorious golden form\nwith a trumpet in its hand and widespread wings is figured in the very\nact of soaring into space. I really must leave whoever reads this to\nimagine the surpassing beauty of these golden roofs flashing when the\nsun strikes--flashing like a thousand fires aflame on a mountain of\npolished marble--so fiercely that the reflection can be clearly seen\nfrom the great peaks of the range a hundred miles away.\n\nIt is a marvellous sight--this golden flower upborne upon the cool white\nmarble walls, and I doubt if the world can show such another. What makes\nthe whole effect even more gorgeous is that a belt of a hundred and\nfifty feet around the marble wall of the temple is planted with an\nindigenous species of sunflower, which were at the time when we first\nsaw them a sheet of golden bloom.\n\nThe main entrance to this wonderful place is between the two\nnorthernmost of the rays or petal courts, and is protected first by the\nusual bronze gates, and then by doors made of solid marble, beautifully\ncarved with allegorical subjects and overlaid with gold. When these\nare passed there is only the thickness of the wall, which is, however,\ntwenty-five feet (for the Zu-Vendi build for all time), and another\nslight wall also of white marble, introduced in order to avoid causing a\nvisible gap in the inner skin of the wall, and you stand in the circular\nhall under the great dome. Advancing to the central altar you look upon\nas beautiful a sight as the imagination of man can conceive. You are in\nthe middle of the holy place, and above you the great white marble dome\n(for the inner skin, like the outer, is of polished marble throughout)\narches away in graceful curves something like that of St Paul's in\nLondon, only at a slighter angle, and from the funnel-like opening at\nthe exact apex a bright beam of light pours down upon the golden altar.\nAt the east and the west are other altars, and other beams of light stab\nthe sacred twilight to the heart. In every direction, 'white, mystic,\nwonderful', open out the ray-like courts, each pierced through by a\nsingle arrow of light that serves to illumine its lofty silence and\ndimly to reveal the monuments of the dead. {Endnote 15}\n\nOvercome at so awe-inspiring a sight, the vast loveliness of which\nthrills the nerves like a glance from beauty's eyes, you turn to the\ncentral golden altar, in the midst of which, though you cannot see it\nnow, there burns a pale but steady flame crowned with curls of faint\nblue smoke. It is of marble overlaid with pure gold, in shape round\nlike the sun, four feet in height, and thirty-six in circumference.\nHere also, hinged to the foundations of the altar, are twelve petals\nof beaten gold. All night and, except at one hour, all day also, these\npetals are closed over the altar itself exactly as the petals of a\nwater-lily close over the yellow crown in stormy weather; but when the\nsun at midday pierces through the funnel in the dome and lights upon the\ngolden flower, the petals open and reveal the hidden mystery, only to\nclose again when the ray has passed.\n\nNor is this all. Standing in semicircles at equal distances from each\nother on the north and south of the sacred place are ten golden angels,\nor female winged forms, exquisitely shaped and draped. These figures,\nwhich are slightly larger than life-size, stand with bent heads in an\nattitude of adoration, their faces shadowed by their wings, and are most\nimposing and of exceeding beauty.\n\nThere is but one thing further which calls for description in this\naltar, which is, that to the east the flooring in front of it is not of\npure white marble, as elsewhere throughout the building, but of solid\nbrass, and this is also the case in front of the other two altars.\n\nThe eastern and western altars, which are semicircular in shape, and\nplaced against the wall of the building, are much less imposing, and\nare not enfolded in golden petals. They are, however, also of gold, the\nsacred fire burns on each, and a golden-winged figure stands on either\nside of them. Two great golden rays run up the wall behind them, but\nwhere the third or middle one should be is an opening in the wall,\nwide on the outside, but narrow within, like a loophole turned inwards.\nThrough the eastern loophole stream the first beams of the rising sun,\nand strike right across the circle, touching the folded petals of the\ngreat gold flower as they pass till they impinge upon the western altar.\nIn the same way at night the last rays of the sinking sun rest for a\nwhile on the eastern altar before they die away into darkness. It is the\npromise of the dawn to the evening and the evening to the dawn.\n\nWith the exception of those three altars and the winged figures about\nthem, the whole space beneath the vast white dome is utterly empty and\ndevoid of ornamentation--a circumstance that to my fancy adds greatly to\nits splendour.\n\nSuch is a brief description of this wonderful and lovely building, to\nthe glories of which, to my mind so much enhanced by their complete\nsimplicity, I only wish I had the power to do justice. But I cannot, so\nit is useless talking more about it. But when I compare this great\nwork of genius to some of the tawdry buildings and tinsel ornamentation\nproduced in these latter days by European ecclesiastical architects,\nI feel that even highly civilized art might learn something from the\nZu-Vendi masterpieces. I can only say that the exclamation which sprang\nto my lips as soon as my eyes first became accustomed to the dim light\nof that glorious building, and its white and curving beauties, perfect\nand thrilling as those of a naked goddess, grew upon me one by one, was,\n'Well! a dog would feel religious here.' It is vulgarly put, but perhaps\nit conveys my meaning more clearly than any polished utterance.\n\nAt the temple gates our party was received by a guard of soldiers,\nwho appeared to be under the orders of a priest; and by them we were\nconducted into one of the ray or 'petal' courts, as the priests call\nthem, and there left for at least half-an-hour. Here we conferred\ntogether, and realizing that we stood in great danger of our lives,\ndetermined, if any attempt should be made upon us, to sell them as\ndearly as we could--Umslopogaas announcing his fixed intention of\ncommitting sacrilege on the person of Agon, the High Priest, by\nsplitting his head with Inkosi-kaas. From where we stood we could\nperceive that an immense multitude were pouring into the temple,\nevidently in expectation of some unusual event, and I could not help\nfearing that we had to do with it. And here I may explain that every\nday, when the sunlight falls upon the central altar, and the trumpets\nsound, a burnt sacrifice is offered to the Sun, consisting generally of\nthe carcase of a sheep or ox, or sometimes of fruit or corn. This event\ncomes off about midday; of course, not always exactly at that hour, but\nas Zu-Vendis is situated not far from the Line, although--being so\nhigh above the sea it is very temperate--midday and the falling of the\nsunlight on the altar were generally simultaneous. Today the sacrifice\nwas to take place at about eight minutes past twelve.\n\nJust at twelve o'clock a priest appeared, and made a sign, and the\nofficer of the guard signified to us that we were expected to advance,\nwhich we did with the best grace that we could muster, all except\nAlphonse, whose irrepressible teeth instantly began to chatter. In a\nfew seconds we were out of the court and looking at a vast sea of human\nfaces stretching away to the farthest limits of the great circle,\nall straining to catch a glimpse of the mysterious strangers who\nhad committed sacrilege; the first strangers, mind you, who, to the\nknowledge of the multitude, had ever set foot in Zu-Vendis since such\ntime that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.\n\nAs we appeared there was a murmur through the vast crowd that went\nechoing away up the great dome, and we saw a visible blush of excitement\ngrow on the thousands of faces, like a pink light on a stretch of pale\ncloud, and a very curious effect it was. On we passed down a lane cut\nthrough the heart of the human mass, till presently we stood upon\nthe brazen patch of flooring to the east of the central altar, and\nimmediately facing it. For some thirty feet around the golden-winged\nfigures the space was roped off, and the multitudes stood outside\nthe ropes. Within were a circle of white-robed gold-cinctured priests\nholding long golden trumpets in their hands, and immediately in front of\nus was our friend Agon, the High Priest, with his curious cap upon his\nhead. His was the only covered head in that vast assemblage. We took\nour stand upon the brazen space, little knowing what was prepared for\nus beneath, but I noticed a curious hissing sound proceeding apparently\nfrom the floor for which I could not account. Then came a pause, and I\nlooked around to see if there was any sign of the two Queens, Nyleptha\nand Sorais, but they were not there. To the right of us, however, was a\nbare space that I guessed was reserved for them.\n\nWe waited, and presently a far-off trumpet blew, apparently high up in\nthe dome. Then came another murmur from the multitude, and up a long\nlane, leading to the open space to our right, we saw the two Queens\nwalking side by side. Behind them were some nobles of the Court, among\nwhom I recognized the great lord Nasta, and behind them again a body of\nabout fifty guards. These last I was very glad to see. Presently they\nhad all arrived and taken their stand, the two Queens in the front,\nthe nobles to the right and left, and the guards in a double semicircle\nbehind them.\n\nThen came another silence, and Nyleptha looked up and caught my eye;\nit seemed to me that there was meaning in her glance, and I watched it\nnarrowly. From my eye it travelled down to the brazen flooring, on\nthe outer edge of which we stood. Then followed a slight and almost\nimperceptible sidelong movement of the head. I did not understand it,\nand it was repeated. Then I guessed that she meant us to move back off\nthe brazen floor. One more glance and I was sure of it--there was\ndanger in standing on the floor. Sir Henry was placed on one side of me,\nUmslopogaas on the other. Keeping my eyes fixed straight before me, I\nwhispered to them, first in Zulu and then in English, to draw slowly\nback inch by inch till half their feet were resting on the marble\nflooring where the brass ceased. Sir Henry whispered on to Good and\nAlphonse, and slowly, very very slowly, we shifted backwards; so slowly\nthat nobody, except Nyleptha and Sorais, who saw everything seemed to\nnotice the movement. Then I glanced again at Nyleptha, and saw that,\nby an almost imperceptible nod, she indicated approval. All the while\nAgon's eyes were fixed upon the altar before him apparently in an\necstasy of contemplation, and mine were fixed upon the small of his back\nin another sort of ecstasy. Suddenly he flung up his long arm, and in a\nsolemn and resounding voice commenced a chant, of which for convenience'\nsake I append a rough, a _very_ rough, translation here, though, of\ncourse, I did not then comprehend its meaning. It was an invocation to\nthe Sun, and ran somewhat as follows:--\n\n  There is silence upon the face of the Earth and the waters thereof!\n  Yea, the silence doth brood on the waters like a nesting bird;\n  The silence sleepeth also upon the bosom of the profound darkness,\n  Only high up in the great spaces star doth speak unto star,\n  The Earth is faint with longing and wet with the tears of her desire;\n  The star-girdled night doth embrace her, but she is not comforted.\n  She lies enshrouded in mists like a corpse in the grave-clothes,\n  And stretches her pale hands to the East.\n\n  Lo! away in the farthest East there is the shadow of a light;\n  The Earth seeth and lifts herself.  She looks out from beneath\n  the hollow of her hand.\n  Then thy great angels fly forth from the Holy Place, oh Sun,\n  They shoot their fiery swords into the darkness and shrivel it up.\n  They climb the heavens and cast down the pale stars from their thrones;\n  Yea, they hurl the changeful stars back into the womb of the night;\n  They cause the moon to become wan as the face of a dying man,\n  And behold!  Thy glory comes, oh Sun!\n\n  Oh, Thou beautiful one, Thou drapest thyself in fire.\n  The wide heavens are thy pathway: thou rollest o'er them as a chariot.\n  The Earth is thy bride.  Thou dost embrace her and\n  she brings forth children;\n  Yea, Thou favourest her, and she yields her increase.\n  Thou art the All Father and the giver of life, oh Sun.\n  The young children stretch out their hands and grow in thy brightness;\n  The old men creep forth and seeing remember their strength.\n  Only the dead forget Thee, oh Sun!\n\n  When Thou art wroth then Thou dost hide Thy face;\n  Thou drawest around Thee a thick curtain of shadows.\n  Then the Earth grows cold and the Heavens are dismayed;\n  They tremble, and the sound thereof is the sound of thunder:\n  They weep, and their tears are outpoured in the rain;\n  They sigh, and the wild winds are the voice of their sighing.\n  The flowers die, the fruitful fields languish and turn pale;\n  The old men and the little children go unto their appointed place\n  When Thou withdrawest thy light, oh Sun!\n\n  Say, what art Thou, oh Thou matchless Splendour--\n  Who set Thee on high, oh Thou flaming Terror?\n  When didst Thou begin, and when is the day of Thy ending?\n  Thou art the raiment of the living Spirit. {Endnote 16}\n  None did place Thee on high, for Thou was the Beginning.\n  Thou shalt not be ended when thy children are forgotten;\n  Nay, Thou shalt never end, for thy hours are eternal.\n  Thou sittest on high within thy golden house and\n  measurest out the centuries.\n  Oh Father of Life! oh dark-dispelling Sun!\n\n\nHe ceased this solemn chant, which, though it seems a poor enough thing\nafter going through my mill, is really beautiful and impressive in the\noriginal; and then, after a moment's pause, he glanced up towards the\nfunnel-sloped opening in the dome and added--\n\nOh Sun, descend upon thine Altar!\n\n\nAs he spoke a wonderful and a beautiful thing happened. Down from on\nhigh flashed a splendid living ray of light, cleaving the twilight like\na sword of fire. Full upon the closed petals it fell and ran shimmering\ndown their golden sides, and then the glorious flower opened as though\nbeneath the bright influence. Slowly it opened, and as the great petals\nfell wide and revealed the golden altar on which the fire ever burns,\nthe priests blew a blast upon the trumpets, and from all the people\nthere rose a shout of praise that beat against the domed roof and came\nechoing down the marble walls. And now the flower altar was open, and\nthe sunlight fell full upon the tongue of sacred flame and beat it down,\nso that it wavered, sank, and vanished into the hollow recesses whence\nit rose. As it vanished, the mellow notes of the trumpets rolled out\nonce more. Again the old priest flung up his hands and called aloud--\n\nWe sacrifice to thee, oh Sun!\n\n\nOnce more I caught Nyleptha's eye; it was fixed upon the brazen\nflooring.\n\n'Look out,' I said, aloud; and as I said it, I saw Agon bend forward and\ntouch something on the altar. As he did so, the great white sea of faces\naround us turned red and then white again, and a deep breath went up\nlike a universal sigh. Nyleptha leant forward, and with an involuntary\nmovement covered her eyes with her hand. Sorais turned and whispered to\nthe officer of the royal bodyguard, and then with a rending sound the\nwhole of the brazen flooring slid from before our feet, and there in its\nplace was suddenly revealed a smooth marble shaft terminating in a most\nawful raging furnace beneath the altar, big enough and hot enough to\nheat the iron stern-post of a man-of-war.\n\nWith a cry of terror we sprang backwards, all except the wretched\nAlphonse, who was paralysed with fear, and would have fallen into the\nfiery furnace which had been prepared for us, had not Sir Henry caught\nhim in his strong hand as he was vanishing and dragged him back.\n\nInstantly there arose the most fearful hubbub, and we four got back\nto back, Alphonse dodging frantically round our little circle in his\nattempts to take shelter under our legs. We all had our revolvers\non--for though we had been politely disarmed of our guns on leaving\nthe palace, of course these people did not know what a revolver was.\nUmslopogaas, too, had his axe, of which no effort had been made to\ndeprive him, and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing\nZulu war-shout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion.\nNext second, the priests, baffled of their prey, had drawn swords from\nbeneath their white robes and were leaping on us like hounds upon a\nstag at bay. I saw that, dangerous as action might be, we must act or be\nlost, so as the first man came bounding along--and a great tall fellow\nhe was--I sent a heavy revolver ball through him, and down he fell at\nthe mouth of the shaft, and slid, shrieking frantically, into the fiery\ngulf that had been prepared for us.\n\nWhether it was his cries, or the, to them, awful sound and effect of\nthe pistol shot, or what, I know not, but the other priests halted,\nparalysed and dismayed, and before they could come on again Sorais had\ncalled out something, and we, together with the two Queens and most\nof the courtiers, were being surrounded with a wall of armed men. In a\nmoment it was done, and still the priests hesitated, and the people hung\nin the balance like a herd of startled buck as it were, making no sign\none way or the other.\n\nThe last yell of the burning priest had died away, the fire had finished\nhim, and a great silence fell upon the place.\n\nThen the High Priest Agon turned, and his face was as the face of a\ndevil. 'Let the sacrifice be sacrificed,' he cried to the Queens. 'Has\nnot sacrilege enough been done by these strangers, and would ye, as\nQueens, throw the cloak of your majesty over evildoers? Are not the\ncreatures sacred to the Sun dead? And is not a priest of the Sun also\ndead, but now slain by the magic of these strangers, who come as the\nwinds out of heaven, whence we know not, and who are what we know not?\nBeware, oh Queens, how ye tamper with the great majesty of the God, even\nbefore His high altar! There is a Power that is more than your power;\nthere is a Justice that is higher than your justice. Beware how ye lift\nan impious hand against it! Let the sacrifice be sacrificed, oh Queens.'\n\nThen Sorais made answer in her deep quiet tones, that always seemed to\nme to have a suspicion of mockery about them, however serious the theme:\n'Oh, Agon, thou hast spoken according to thy desire, and thou hast\nspoken truth. But it is thou who wouldst lift an impious hand\nagainst the justice of thy God. Bethink thee the midday sacrifice is\naccomplished; the Sun hath claimed his priest as a sacrifice.'\n\nThis was a novel idea, and the people applauded it.\n\n'Bethink thee what are these men? They are strangers found floating on\nthe bosom of a lake. Who brought them here? How came they here? How know\nyou that they also are not servants of the Sun? Is this the hospitality\nthat ye would have our nation show to those whom chance brings to\nthem, to throw them to the flames? Shame on you! Shame on you! What is\nhospitality? To receive the stranger and show him favour. To bind up his\nwounds, and find a pillow for his head, and food for him to eat. But thy\npillow is the fiery furnace, and thy food the hot savour of the flame.\nShame on thee, I say!'\n\nShe paused a little to watch the effect of her speech upon the\nmultitude, and seeing that it was favourable, changed her tone from one\nof remonstrance to one of command.\n\n'Ho! place there,' she cried; 'place, I say; make way for the Queens,\nand those whom the Queens cover with their \"kaf\" (mantle).'\n\n'And if I refuse, oh Queen?' said Agon between his teeth.\n\n'Then will I cut a path with my guards,' was the proud answer; 'ay,\neven in the presence of thy sanctuary, and through the bodies of thy\npriests.'\n\nAgon turned livid with baffled fury. He glanced at the people as though\nmeditating an appeal to them, but saw clearly that their sympathies were\nall the other way. The Zu-Vendi are a very curious and sociable people,\nand great as was their sense of the enormity that we had committed in\nshooting the sacred hippopotami, they did not like the idea of the only\nreal live strangers they had seen or heard of being consigned to a fiery\nfurnace, thereby putting an end for ever to their chance of extracting\nknowledge and information from, and gossiping about us. Agon saw this\nand hesitated, and then for the first time Nyleptha spoke in her soft\nsweet voice.\n\n'Bethink thee, Agon,' she said, 'as my sister Queen has said, these men\nmay also be servants of the Sun. For themselves they cannot speak, for\ntheir tongues are tied. Let the matter be adjourned till such time as\nthey have learnt our language. Who can be condemned without a hearing?\nWhen these men can plead for themselves, then it will be time to put\nthem to the proof.'\n\nHere was a clever loophole of escape, and the vindictive old priest took\nit, little as he liked it.\n\n'So be it, oh Queens,' he said. 'Let the men go in peace, and when they\nhave learnt our tongue then let them speak. And I, even I, will make\nhumble supplication at the altar lest pestilence fall on the land by\ncause of the sacrilege.'\n\nThese words were received with a murmur of applause, and in another\nminute we were marching out of the temple surrounded by the royal\nguards.\n\nBut it was not till long afterwards that we learnt the exact substance\nof what had passed, and how hardly our lives had been wrung out of the\ncruel grip of the Zu-Vendi priesthood, in the face of which even the\nQueens were practically powerless. Had it not been for their strenuous\nefforts to protect us we should have been slain even before we set foot\nin the Temple of the Sun. The attempt to drop us bodily into the fiery\npit as an offering was a last artifice to attain this end when several\nothers quite unsuspected by us had already failed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV SORAIS' SONG\n\n\n\nAfter our escape from Agon and his pious crew we returned to our\nquarters in the palace and had a very good time. The two Queens, the\nnobles and the people vied with each other in doing us honour and\nshowering gifts upon us. As for that painful little incident of the\nhippopotami it sank into oblivion, where we were quite content to leave\nit. Every day deputations and individuals waited on us to examine our\nguns and clothing, our chain shirts, and our instruments, especially our\nwatches, with which they were much delighted. In short, we became quite\nthe rage, so much so that some of the fashionable young swells among\nthe Zu-Vendi began to copy the cut of some of our clothes, notably Sir\nHenry's shooting jacket. One day, indeed, a deputation waited on us\nand, as usual, Good donned his full-dress uniform for the occasion. This\ndeputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally\ncame to visit us. They were little insignificant men of an excessively\npolite, not to say servile, demeanour; and their attention appeared\nto be chiefly taken up with observing the details of Good's full-dress\nuniform, of which they took copious notes and measurements. Good was\nmuch flattered at the time, not suspecting that he had to deal with the\nsix leading tailors of Milosis. A fortnight afterwards, however, when\non attending court as usual he had the pleasure of seeing some seven\nor eight Zu-Vendi 'mashers' arrayed in all the glory of a very fair\nimitation of his full-dress uniform, he changed his mind. I shall never\nforget his face of astonishment and disgust. It was after this, chiefly\nto avoid remark, and also because our clothes were wearing out and had\nto be saved up, that we resolved to adopt the native dress; and a very\ncomfortable one we found it, though I am bound to say that I looked\nsufficiently ridiculous in it, and as for Alphonse! Only Umslopogaas\nwould have none of these things; when his moocha was worn out the fierce\nold Zulu made him a new one, and went about unconcerned, as grim and\nnaked as his own battleaxe.\n\nMeanwhile we pursued our study of the language steadily and made very\ngood progress. On the morning following our adventure in the temple,\nthree grave and reverend signiors presented themselves armed with\nmanuscript books, ink-horns and feather pens, and indicated that they\nhad been sent to teach us. So, with the exception of Umslopogaas, we all\nbuckled to with a will, doing four hours a day. As for Umslopogaas, he\nwould have none of that either. He did not wish to learn that 'woman's\ntalk', not he; and when one of the teachers advanced on him with a book\nand an ink-horn and waved them before him in a mild persuasive way, much\nas a churchwarden invitingly shakes the offertory bag under the nose of\na rich but niggardly parishioner, he sprang up with a fierce oath and\nflashed Inkosi-kaas before the eyes of our learned friend, and there was\nan end of the attempt to teach _him_ Zu-Vendi.\n\nThus we spent our mornings in useful occupation which grew more and\nmore interesting as we proceeded, and the afternoons were given up to\nrecreation. Sometimes we made trips, notably one to the gold mines and\nanother to the marble quarries both of which I wish I had space and time\nto describe; and sometimes we went out hunting buck with dogs trained\nfor that purpose, and a very exciting sport it is, as the country is\nfull of agricultural enclosures and our horses were magnificent. This\nis not to be wondered at, seeing that the royal stables were at our\ncommand, in addition to which we had four splendid saddle horses given\nto us by Nyleptha.\n\nSometimes, again, we went hawking, a pastime that is in great favour\namong the Zu-Vendi, who generally fly their birds at a species of\npartridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its\nflight. When attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head,\nand, instead of seeking cover, flies high into the sky, thus offering\nwonderful sport. I have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out\nof sight when followed by the hawk. Still better sport is offered by a\nvariety of solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock, which is plentiful\nin this country, and which is flown at with a very small, agile, and\nhighly-trained hawk with an almost red tail. The zigzagging of the great\nsnipe and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the\nred-tailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one. Another variety of\nthe same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope\nwith trained eagles; and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the\ngreat bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the\nsunlight, and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannon-ball upon\nsome cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything\nbut that piercing eye. Still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes\nthe buck running.\n\nOn other days we would pay visits to the country seats at some of the\ngreat lords' beautiful fortified places, and the villages clustering\nbeneath their walls. Here we saw vineyards and corn-fields and well-kept\npark-like grounds, with such timber in them as filled me with delight,\nfor I do love a good tree. There it stands so strong and sturdy, and yet\nso beautiful, a very type of the best sort of man. How proudly it\nlifts its bare head to the winter storms, and with what a full heart it\nrejoices when the spring has come again! How grand its voice is, too,\nwhen it talks with the wind: a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the\nbeauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf. All day it points to the\nsunshine and all night to the stars, and thus passionless, and yet\nfull of life, it endures through the centuries, come storm, come shine,\ndrawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth, and as\nthe slow years roll by, learning the great mysteries of growth and of\ndecay. And so on and on through generations, outliving individuals,\ncustoms, dynasties--all save the landscape it adorns and human\nnature--till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and\nrejoices over a reclaimed space, or decay puts the last stroke to his\nfungus-fingered work.\n\nAh, one should always think twice before one cuts down a tree!\n\nIn the evenings it was customary for Sir Henry, Good, and myself to\ndine, or rather sup, with their Majesties--not every night, indeed, but\nabout three or four times a week, whenever they had not much company, or\nthe affairs of state would allow of it. And I am bound to say that those\nlittle suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that\nI ever had to do with. How true is the saying that the very highest\nin rank are always the most simple and kindly. It is from your\nhalf-and-half sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity, the\ndifference between the two being very much what one sees every day in\nEngland between the old, out-at-elbows, broken-down county family, and\nthe overbearing, purse-proud people who come and 'take the place'. I\nreally think that Nyleptha's greatest charm is her sweet simplicity, and\nher kindly genuine interest even in little things. She is the simplest\nwoman I ever knew, and where her passions are not involved, one of the\nsweetest; but she can look queenly enough when she likes, and be as\nfierce as any savage too.\n\nFor instance, never shall I forget that scene when I for the first time\nwas sure that she was really in love with Curtis. It came about in this\nway--all through Good's weakness for ladies' society. When we had been\nemployed for some three months in learning Zu-Vendi, it struck Master\nGood that he was getting rather tired of the old gentlemen who did us\nthe honour to lead us in the way that we should go, so he proceeded,\nwithout saying a word to anybody else, to inform them that it was a\npeculiar fact, but that we could not make any real progress in the\ndeeper intricacies of a foreign language unless we were taught by\nladies--young ladies, he was careful to explain. In his own country, he\npointed out, it was habitual to choose the very best-looking and most\ncharming girls who could be found to instruct any strangers who happened\nto come that way, etc.\n\nAll of this the old gentlemen swallowed open-mouthed. There was,\nthey admitted, reason in what he said, since the contemplation of the\nbeautiful, as their philosophy taught, induced a certain porosity of\nmind similar to that produced upon the physical body by the healthful\ninfluences of sun and air. Consequently it was probable that we might\nabsorb the Zu-Vendi tongue a little faster if suitable teachers could\nbe found. Another thing was that, as the female sex was naturally\nloquacious, good practice would be gained in the viva voce department of\nour studies.\n\nTo all of this Good gravely assented, and the learned gentlemen\ndeparted, assuring him that their orders were to fall in with our wishes\nin every way, and that, if possible, our views should be met.\n\nImagine, therefore the surprise and disgust of myself, and I trust and\nbelieve Sir Henry, when, on entering the room where we were accustomed\nto carry on our studies the following morning, we found, instead of\nour usual venerable tutors, three of the best-looking young women whom\nMilosis could produce--and that is saying a good deal--who blushed and\nsmiled and curtseyed, and gave us to understand that they were there\nto carry on our instruction. Then Good, as we gazed at one another in\nbewilderment, thought fit to explain, saying that it had slipped his\nmemory before--but the old gentlemen had told him, on the previous\nevening, that it was absolutely necessary that our further education\nshould be carried on by the other sex. I was overwhelmed, and appealed\nto Sir Henry for advice in such a crisis.\n\n'Well,' he said, 'you see the ladies are here, ain't they? If we sent\nthem away, don't you think it might hurt their feelings, eh? One doesn't\nlike to be rough, you see; and they look regular _blues_, don't they,\neh?'\n\nBy this time Good had already begun his lessons with the handsomest of\nthe three, and so with a sigh I yielded. That day everything went very\nwell: the young ladies were certainly very clever, and they only smiled\nwhen we blundered. I never saw Good so attentive to his books before,\nand even Sir Henry appeared to tackle Zu-Vendi with a renewed zest.\n'Ah,' thought I, 'will it always be thus?'\n\nNext day we were much more lively, our work was pleasingly interspersed\nwith questions about our native country, what the ladies were like\nthere, etc., all of which we answered as best as we could in Zu-Vendi,\nand I heard Good assuring his teacher that her loveliness was to the\nbeauties of Europe as the sun to the moon, to which she replied with a\nlittle toss of the head, that she was a plain teaching woman and nothing\nelse, and that it was not kind 'to deceive a poor girl so'. Then we had\na little singing that was really charming, so natural and unaffected.\nThe Zu-Vendi love-songs are most touching. On the third day we were all\nquite intimate. Good narrated some of his previous love affairs to his\nfair teacher, and so moved was she that her sighs mingled with his own.\nI discoursed with mine, a merry blue-eyed girl, upon Zu-Vendian art, and\nnever saw that she was waiting for an opportunity to drop a specimen of\nthe cockroach tribe down my back, whilst in the corner Sir Henry and\nhis governess appeared, so far as I could judge, to be going through a\nlesson framed on the great educational principles laid down by Wackford\nSqueers Esq., though in a very modified or rather spiritualized form.\nThe lady softly repeated the Zu-Vendi word for 'hand', and he took hers;\n'eyes', and he gazed deep into her brown orbs; 'lips', and--but just at\nthat moment _my_ young lady dropped the cockroach down my back and ran\naway laughing. Now if there is one thing I loathe more than another it\nis cockroaches, and moved quite beyond myself, and yet laughing at her\nimpudence, I took up the cushion she had been sitting on and threw it\nafter her. Imagine then my shame--my horror, and my distress--when the\ndoor opened, and, attended by two guards only, in walked _Nyleptha_.\nThe cushion could not be recalled (it missed the girl and hit one of the\nguards on the head), but I instantly and ineffectually tried to look as\nthough I had not thrown it. Good ceased his sighing, and began to murder\nZu-Vendi at the top of his voice, and Sir Henry whistled and looked\nsilly. As for the poor girls, they were utterly dumbfounded.\n\nAnd Nyleptha! she drew herself up till her frame seemed to tower even\nabove that of the tall guards, and her face went first red, and then\npale as death.\n\n'Guards,' she said in a quiet choked voice, and pointing at the fair but\nunconscious disciple of Wackford Squeers, 'slay me that woman.'\n\nThe men hesitated, as well they might.\n\n'Will ye do my bidding,' she said again in the same voice, 'or will ye\nnot?'\n\nThen they advanced upon the girl with uplifted spears. By this time Sir\nHenry had recovered himself, and saw that the comedy was likely to turn\ninto a tragedy.\n\n'Stand back,' he said in a voice of thunder, at the same time getting in\nfront of the terrified girl. 'Shame on thee, Nyleptha--shame! Thou shalt\nnot kill her.'\n\n'Doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her. Thou couldst\nhardly do less in honour,' answered the infuriated Queen; 'but she shall\ndie--she shall die,' and she stamped her little foot.\n\n'It is well,' he answered; 'then will I die with her. I am thy servant,\noh Queen; do with me even as thou wilt.' And he bowed towards her, and\nfixed his clear eyes contemptuously on her face.\n\n'I could wish to slay thee too,' she answered; 'for thou dost make a\nmock of me;' and then feeling that she was mastered, and I suppose not\nknowing what else to do, she burst into such a storm of tears and looked\nso royally lovely in her passionate distress, that, old as I am, I must\nsay I envied Curtis his task of supporting her. It was rather odd to see\nhim holding her in his arms considering what had just passed--a thought\nthat seemed to occur to herself, for presently she wrenched herself free\nand went, leaving us all much disturbed.\n\nPresently, however, one of the guards returned with a message to the\ngirls that they were, on pain of death, to leave the city and return to\ntheir homes in the country, and that no further harm would come to them;\nand accordingly they went, one of them remarking philosophically that\nit could not be helped, and that it was a satisfaction to know that they\nhad taught us a little serviceable Zu-Vendi. Mine was an exceedingly\nnice girl, and, overlooking the cockroach, I made her a present of my\nfavourite lucky sixpence with a hole in it when she went away. After\nthat our former masters resumed their course of instruction, needless to\nsay to my great relief.\n\nThat night, when in fear and trembling we attended the royal supper\ntable, we found that Nyleptha was laid up with a bad headache. That\nheadache lasted for three whole days; but on the fourth she was present\nat supper as usual, and with the most gracious and sweet smile gave Sir\nHenry her hand to lead her to the table. No allusion was made to the\nlittle affair described above beyond her saying, with a charming air of\ninnocence, that when she came to see us at our studies the other day she\nhad been seized with a giddiness from which she had only now recovered.\nShe supposed, she added with a touch of the humour that was common to\nher, that it was the sight of people working so hard which had affected\nher.\n\nIn reply Sir Henry said, dryly, that he had thought she did not look\nquite herself on that day, whereat she flashed one of those quick\nglances of hers at him, which if he had the feelings of a man must have\ngone through him like a knife, and the subject dropped entirely.\nIndeed, after supper was over Nyleptha condescended to put us through\nan examination to see what we had learnt, and to express herself well\nsatisfied with the results. Indeed, she proceeded to give us, especially\nSir Henry, a lesson on her own account, and very interesting we found\nit.\n\nAnd all the while that we talked, or rather tried to talk, and laughed,\nSorais would sit there in her carven ivory chair, and look at us and\nread us all like a book, only from time to time saying a few words, and\nsmiling that quick ominous smile of hers which was more like a flash of\nsummer lightning on a dark cloud than anything else. And as near to her\nas he dared would sit Good, worshipping through his eyeglass, for he\nreally was getting seriously devoted to this sombre beauty, of whom,\nspeaking personally, I felt terribly afraid. I watched her keenly, and\nsoon I found out that for all her apparent impassibility she was at\nheart bitterly jealous of Nyleptha. Another thing I found out, and\nthe discovery filled me with dismay, and that was, that she _also_ was\ngrowing devoted to Sir Henry Curtis. Of course I could not be sure; it\nis not easy to read so cold and haughty a woman; but I noticed one or\ntwo little things, and, as elephant hunters know, dried grass shows\nwhich way the wind has set.\n\nAnd so another three months passed over us, by which time we had all\nattained to a very considerable mastery of the Zu-Vendi language,\nwhich is an easy one to learn. And as the time went on we became great\nfavourites with the people, and even with the courtiers, gaining an\nenormous reputation for cleverness, because, as I think I have said,\nSir Henry was able to show them how to make glass, which was a national\nwant, and also, by the help of a twenty-year almanac that we had\nwith us, to predict various heavenly combinations which were\nquite unsuspected by the native astronomers. We even succeeded in\ndemonstrating the principle of the steam-engine to a gathering of the\nlearned men, who were filled with amazement; and several other things of\nthe same sort we did. And so it came about that the people made up their\nminds that we must on no account be allowed to go out of the country\n(which indeed was an apparent impossibility even if we had wished it),\nand we were advanced to great honour and made officers to the bodyguards\nof the sister Queens while permanent quarters were assigned to us in the\npalace, and our opinion was asked upon questions of national policy.\n\nBut blue as the sky seemed, there was a cloud, and a big one, on the\nhorizon. We had indeed heard no more of those confounded hippopotami,\nbut it is not on that account to be supposed that our sacrilege was\nforgotten, or the enmity of the great and powerful priesthood headed by\nAgon appeased. On the contrary, it was burning the more fiercely because\nit was necessarily suppressed, and what had perhaps begun in bigotry\nwas ending in downright direct hatred born of jealousy. Hitherto, the\npriests had been the wise men of the land, and were on this account, as\nwell as from superstitious causes, looked on with peculiar veneration.\nBut our arrival, with our outlandish wisdom and our strange inventions\nand hints of unimagined things, dealt a serious blow to this state of\naffairs, and, among the educated Zu-Vendi, went far towards destroying\nthe priestly prestige. A still worse affront to them, however, was the\nfavour with which we were regarded, and the trust that was reposed in\nus. All these things tended to make us excessively obnoxious to the\ngreat sacerdotal clan, the most powerful because the most united faction\nin the kingdom.\n\nAnother source of imminent danger to us was the rising envy of some of\nthe great lords headed by Nasta, whose antagonism to us had at best\nbeen but thinly veiled, and which now threatened to break out into open\nflame. Nasta had for some years been a candidate for Nyleptha's hand in\nmarriage, and when we appeared on the scene I fancy, from all I could\ngather, that though there were still many obstacles in his path, success\nwas by no means out of his reach. But now all this had changed; the coy\nNyleptha smiled no more in his direction, and he was not slow to guess\nthe cause. Infuriated and alarmed, he turned his attention to Sorais,\nonly to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain side. With a\nbitter jest or two about his fickleness, that door was closed on him for\never. So Nasta bethought himself of the thirty thousand wild swordsmen\nwho would pour down at his bidding through the northern mountain passes,\nand no doubt vowed to adorn the gates of Milosis with our heads.\n\nBut first he determined, as I learned, to make one more attempt and to\ndemand the hand of Nyleptha in the open Court after the formal annual\nceremony of the signing of the laws that had been proclaimed by the\nQueens during the year.\n\nOf this astounding fact Nyleptha heard with simulated nonchalance, and\nwith a little trembling of the voice herself informed us of it as we sat\nat supper on the night preceding the great ceremony of the law-giving.\n\nSir Henry bit his lip, and do what he could to prevent it plainly showed\nhis agitation.\n\n'And what answer will the Queen be pleased to give to the great Lord?'\nasked I, in a jesting manner.\n\n'Answer, Macumazahn' (for we had elected to pass by our Zulu names in\nZu-Vendis), she said, with a pretty shrug of her ivory shoulder. 'Nay, I\nknow not; what is a poor woman to do, when the wooer has thirty thousand\nswords wherewith to urge his love?' And from under her long lashes she\nglanced at Curtis.\n\nJust then we rose from the table to adjourn into another room.\n'Quatermain, a word, quick,' said Sir Henry to me. 'Listen. I have never\nspoken about it, but surely you have guessed: I love Nyleptha. What am I\nto do?'\n\nFortunately, I had more or less already taken the question into\nconsideration, and was therefore able to give such answer as seemed the\nwisest to me.\n\n'You must speak to Nyleptha tonight,' I said. 'Now is your time, now or\nnever. Listen. In the sitting-chamber get near to her, and whisper to\nher to meet you at midnight by the Rademas statue at the end of the\ngreat hall. I will keep watch for you there. Now or never, Curtis.'\n\nWe passed on into the other room. Nyleptha was sitting, her hands before\nher, and a sad anxious look upon her lovely face. A little way off was\nSorais talking to Good in her slow measured tones.\n\nThe time went on; in another quarter of an hour I knew that, according\nto their habit, the Queens would retire. As yet, Sir Henry had had no\nchance of saying a word in private: indeed, though we saw much of the\nroyal sisters, it was by no means easy to see them alone. I racked my\nbrains, and at last an idea came to me.\n\n'Will the Queen be pleased,' I said, bowing low before Sorais, 'to sing\nto her servants? Our hearts are heavy this night; sing to us, oh Lady of\nthe Night' (Sorais' favourite name among the people).\n\n'My songs, Macumazahn, are not such as to lighten the heavy heart, yet\nwill I sing if it pleases thee,' she answered; and she rose and went a\nfew paces to a table whereon lay an instrument not unlike a zither, and\nstruck a few wandering chords.\n\nThen suddenly, like the notes of some deep-throated bird, her rounded\nvoice rang out in song so wildly sweet, and yet with so eerie and sad\na refrain, that it made the very blood stand still. Up, up soared the\ngolden notes, that seemed to melt far away, and then to grow again and\ntravel on, laden with all the sorrow of the world and all the despair of\nthe lost. It was a marvellous song, but I had not time to listen to\nit properly. However, I got the words of it afterwards, and here is a\ntranslation of its burden, so far as it admits of being translated at\nall.\n\n\n  SORAIS' SONG\n\n  As a desolate bird that through darkness its lost way is winging,\n  As a hand that is helplessly raised when Death's sickle is swinging,\n  So is life! ay, the life that lends passion and breath to my singing.\n\n  As the nightingale's song that is full of a sweetness unspoken,\n  As a spirit unbarring the gates of the skies for a token,\n  So is love! ay, the love that shall fall when his pinion is broken.\n\n  As the tramp of the legions when trumpets their challenge are sending,\n  As the shout of the Storm-god when lightnings the black sky are rending,\n  So is power! ay, the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending.\n\n  So short is our life; yet with space for all things to forsake us,\n  A bitter delusion, a dream from which nought can awake us,\n  Till Death's dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall o'ertake us.\n\n\nRefrain\n\n  Oh, the world is fair at the dawning--dawning--dawning,\n  But the red sun sinks in blood--the red sun sinks in blood.\n\n\nI only wish that I could write down the music too.\n\n'Now, Curtis, now,' I whispered, when she began the second verse, and\nturned my back.\n\n'Nyleptha,' he said--for my nerves were so much on the stretch that I\ncould hear every word, low as it was spoken, even through Sorais' divine\nnotes--'Nyleptha, I must speak with thee this night, upon my life I\nmust. Say me not nay; oh, say me not nay!'\n\n'How can I speak with thee?' she answered, looking fixedly before her;\n'Queens are not like other people. I am surrounded and watched.'\n\n'Listen, Nyleptha, thus. I will be before the statue of Rademas in\nthe great hall at midnight. I have the countersign and can pass in.\nMacumazahn will be there to keep guard, and with him the Zulu. Oh come,\nmy Queen, deny me not.'\n\n'It is not seemly,' she murmured, 'and tomorrow--'\n\nJust then the music began to die in the last wail of the refrain, and\nSorais slowly turned her round.\n\n'I will be there,' said Nyleptha, hurriedly; 'on thy life see that thou\nfail me not.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI BEFORE THE STATUE\n\n\n\nIt was night--dead night--and the silence lay on the Frowning City like\na cloud.\n\nSecretly, as evildoers, Sir Henry Curtis, Umslopogaas, and myself\nthreaded our way through the passages towards a by-entrance to the great\nThrone Chamber. Once we were met by the fierce rattling challenge of the\nsentry. I gave the countersign, and the man grounded his spear and let\nus pass. Also we were officers of the Queens' bodyguard, and in that\ncapacity had a right to come and go unquestioned.\n\nWe gained the hall in safety. So empty and so still was it, that even\nwhen we had passed the sound of our footsteps yet echoed up the lofty\nwalls, vibrating faintly and still more faintly against the carven roof,\nlike ghosts of the footsteps of dead men haunting the place that once\nthey trod.\n\nIt was an eerie spot, and it oppressed me. The moon was full, and threw\ngreat pencils and patches of light through the high windowless openings\nin the walls, that lay pure and beautiful upon the blackness of the\nmarble floor, like white flowers on a coffin. One of these silver arrows\nfell upon the statue of the sleeping Rademas, and of the angel form bent\nover him, illumining it, and a small circle round it, with a soft clear\nlight, reminding me of that with which Catholics illumine the altars of\ntheir cathedrals.\n\nHere by the statue we took our stand, and waited. Sir Henry and I close\ntogether, Umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness, so that I could\nonly just make out his towering outline leaning on the outline of an\naxe.\n\nSo long did we wait that I almost fell asleep resting against the cold\nmarble, but was suddenly aroused by hearing Curtis give a quick catching\nbreath. Then from far away there came a little sound as though the\nstatues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message\nof the ages.\n\nIt was the faint sweep of a lady's dress. Nearer it grew, and nearer\nyet. We could see a figure steal from patch to patch of moonlight, and\neven hear the soft fall of sandalled feet. Another second and I saw\nthe black silhouette of the old Zulu raise its arm in mute salute, and\nNyleptha was before us.\n\nOh, how beautiful she looked as she paused a moment just within the\ncircle of the moonlight! Her hand was pressed upon her heart, and her\nwhite bosom heaved beneath it. Round her head a broidered scarf was\nloosely thrown, partially shadowing the perfect face, and thus rendering\nit even more lovely; for beauty, dependent as it is to a certain extent\nupon the imagination, is never so beautiful as when it is half hid.\nThere she stood radiant but half doubting, stately and yet so sweet. It\nwas but a moment, but I then and there fell in love with her myself,\nand have remained so to this hour; for, indeed, she looked more like\nan angel out of heaven than a loving, passionate, mortal woman. Low we\nbowed before her, and then she spoke.\n\n'I have come,' she whispered, 'but it was at great risk. Ye know not how\nI am watched. The priests watch me. Sorais watches me with those great\neyes of hers. My very guards are spies upon me. Nasta watches me too.\nOh, let him be careful!' and she stamped her foot. 'Let him be careful;\nI am a woman, and therefore hard to drive. Ay, and I am a Queen, too,\nand can still avenge. Let him be careful, I say, lest in place of giving\nhim my hand I take his head,' and she ended the outburst with a little\nsob, and then smiled up at us bewitchingly and laughed.\n\n'Thou didst bid me come hither, my Lord Incubu' (Curtis had taught her\nto call him so). 'Doubtless it is about business of the State, for I\nknow that thou art ever full of great ideas and plans for my welfare\nand my people's. So even as a Queen should I have come, though I greatly\nfear the dark alone,' and again she laughed and gave him a glance from\nher grey eyes.\n\nAt this point I thought it wise to move a little, since secrets 'of the\nState' should not be made public property; but she would not let me go\nfar, peremptorily stopping me within five yards or so, saying that she\nfeared surprise. So it came to pass that, however unwillingly, I heard\nall that passed.\n\n'Thou knowest, Nyleptha,' said Sir Henry, 'that it was for none of these\nthings that I asked thee to meet me at this lonely place. Nyleptha,\nwaste not the time in pleasantry, but listen to me, for--I love thee.'\n\nAs he said the words I saw her face break up, as it were, and change.\nThe coquetry went out of it, and in its place there shone a great light\nof love which seemed to glorify it, and make it like that of the marble\nangel overhead. I could not help thinking that it must have been a touch\nof prophetic instinct which made the long dead Rademas limn, in the\nfeatures of the angel of his inspiring vision, so strange a likeness of\nhis own descendant. Sir Henry, also, must have observed and been struck\nby the likeness, for, catching the look upon Nyleptha's face, he glanced\nquickly from it to the moonlit statue, and then back again at his\nbeloved.\n\n'Thou sayest thou dost love me,' she said in a low voice, 'and thy voice\nrings true, but how am I to know that thou dost speak the truth?'\n\n'Though,' she went on with proud humility, and in the stately third\nperson which is so largely used by the Zu-Vendi, 'I be as nothing in the\neyes of my lord,' and she curtseyed towards him, 'who comes from among\na wonderful people, to whom my people are but children, yet here am I\na queen and a leader of men, and if I would go to battle a hundred\nthousand spears shall sparkle in my train like stars glimmering down the\npath of the bent moon. And although my beauty be a little thing in\nthe eyes of my lord,' and she lifted her broidered skirt and curtseyed\nagain, 'yet here among my own people am I held right fair, and ever\nsince I was a woman the great lords of my kingdom have made quarrel\nconcerning me, as though forsooth,' she added with a flash of passion,\n'I were a deer to be pulled down by the hungriest wolf, or a horse to\nbe sold to the highest bidder. Let my lord pardon me if I weary my lord,\nbut it hath pleased my lord to say that he loves me, Nyleptha, a Queen\nof the Zu-Vendi, and therefore would I say that though my love and my\nhand be not much to my lord, yet to me are they all.'\n\n'Oh!' she cried, with a sudden and thrilling change of voice, and\nmodifying her dignified mode of address. 'Oh, how can I know that thou\nlovest but me? How can I know that thou wilt not weary of me and seek\nthine own place again, leaving me desolate? Who is there to tell me but\nthat thou lovest some other woman, some fair woman unknown to me, but\nwho yet draws breath beneath this same moon that shines on me tonight?\nTell me _how_ am I to know?' And she clasped her hands and stretched\nthem out towards him and looked appealingly into his face.\n\n'Nyleptha,' answered Sir Henry, adopting the Zu-Vendi way of speech; 'I\nhave told thee that I love thee; how am I to tell thee how much I love\nthee? Is there then a measure for love? Yet will I try. I say not that I\nhave never looked upon another woman with favour, but this I say that\nI love thee with all my life and with all my strength; that I love thee\nnow and shall love thee till I grow cold in death, ay, and as I believe\nbeyond my death, and on and on for ever: I say that thy voice is music\nto my ear, and thy touch as water to a thirsty land, that when thou art\nthere the world is beautiful, and when I see thee not it is as though\nthe light was dead. Oh, Nyleptha, I will never leave thee; here and now\nfor thy dear sake I will forget my people and my father's house, yea,\nI renounce them all. By thy side will I live, Nyleptha, and at thy side\nwill I die.'\n\nHe paused and gazed at her earnestly, but she hung her head like a lily,\nand said never a word.\n\n'Look!' he went on, pointing to the statue on which the moonlight played\nso brightly. 'Thou seest that angel woman who rests her hand upon the\nforehead of the sleeping man, and thou seest how at her touch his soul\nflames up and shines out through his flesh, even as a lamp at the touch\nof the fire, so is it with me and thee, Nyleptha. Thou hast awakened my\nsoul and called it forth, and now, Nyleptha, it is not mine, not mine,\nbut _thine_ and thine only. There is no more for me to say; in thy hands\nis my life.' And he leaned back against the pedestal of the statue,\nlooking very pale, and his eyes shining, but proud and handsome as a\ngod.\n\nSlowly, slowly she raised her head, and fixed her wonderful eyes, all\nalight with the greatness of her passion, full upon his face, as though\nto read his very soul. Then at last she spoke, low indeed, but clearly\nas a silver bell.\n\n'Of a truth, weak woman that I am, I do believe thee. Ill will be the\nday for thee and for me also if it be my fate to learn that I have\nbelieved a lie. And now hearken to me, oh man, who hath wandered here\nfrom far to steal my heart and make me all thine own. I put my hand upon\nthy hand thus, and thus I, whose lips have never kissed before, do kiss\nthee on the brow; and now by my hand and by that first and holy kiss,\nay, by my people's weal and by my throne that like enough I shall lose\nfor thee--by the name of my high House, by the sacred Stone and by the\neternal majesty of the Sun, I swear that for thee will I live and die.\nAnd I swear that I will love thee and thee only till death, ay, and\nbeyond, if as thou sayest there be a beyond, and that thy will shall be\nmy will, and thy ways my ways.\n\n'Oh see, see, my lord! thou knowest not how humble is she who loves; I,\nwho am a Queen, I kneel before thee, even at thy feet I do my homage;'\nand the lovely impassioned creature flung herself down on her knees on\nthe cold marble before him. And after that I really do not know, for\nI could stand it no longer, and cleared off to refresh myself with a\nlittle of old Umslopogaas' society, leaving them to settle it their own\nway, and a very long time they were about it.\n\nI found the old warrior leaning on Inkosi-kaas as usual, and surveying\nthe scene in the patch of moonlight with a grim smile of amusement.\n\n'Ah, Macumazahn,' he said, 'I suppose it is because I am getting old,\nbut I don't think that I shall ever learn to understand the ways of you\nwhite people. Look there now, I pray thee, they are a pretty pair of\ndoves, but what is all the fuss about, Macumazahn? He wants a wife, and\nshe wants a husband, then why does he not pay his cows down {Endnote 17}\nlike a man and have done with it? It would save a deal of trouble, and\nwe should have had our night's sleep. But there they go, talk, talk,\ntalk, and kiss, kiss, kiss, like mad things. Eugh!'\n\nSome three-quarters of an hour afterwards the 'pair of doves' came\nstrolling towards us, Curtis looking slightly silly, and Nyleptha\nremarking calmly that the moonlight made very pretty effects on the\nmarble. Then, for she was in a most gracious mood, she took my hand and\nsaid that I was 'her Lord's' dear friend, and therefore most dear to\nher--not a word for my own sake, you see. Next she lifted Umslopogaas'\naxe, and examined it curiously, saying significantly as she did so that\nhe might soon have cause to use it in defence of her.\n\nAfter that she nodded prettily to us all, and casting a tender glance at\nher lover, glided off into the darkness like a beautiful vision.\n\nWhen we got back to our quarters, which we did without accident, Curtis\nasked me jocularly what I was thinking about.\n\n'I am wondering,' I answered, 'on what principle it is arranged that\nsome people should find beautiful queens to fall in love with them,\nwhile others find nobody at all, or worse than nobody; and I am also\nwondering how many brave men's lives this night's work will cost.' It\nwas rather nasty of me, perhaps, but somehow all the feelings do not\nevaporate with age, and I could not help being a little jealous of my\nold friend's luck. Vanity, my sons; vanity of vanities!\n\nOn the following morning, Good was informed of the happy occurrence,\nand positively rippled with smiles that, originating somewhere about the\nmouth, slowly travelled up his face like the rings in a duckpond, till\nthey flowed over the brim of his eyeglass and went where sweet smiles\ngo. The fact of the matter, however, was that not only was Good rejoiced\nabout the thing on its own merits but also for personal reasons. He\nadored Sorais quite as earnestly as Sir Henry adored Nyleptha, and his\nadoration had not altogether prospered. Indeed, it had seemed to him and\nto me also that the dark Cleopatra-like queen favoured Curtis in her own\ncurious inscrutable way much more than Good. Therefore it was a\nrelief to him to learn that his unconscious rival was permanently and\nsatisfactorily attached in another direction. His face fell a little,\nhowever, when he was told that the whole thing was to be kept as secret\nas the dead, above all from Sorais for the present, inasmuch as the\npolitical convulsion which would follow such an announcement at the\nmoment would be altogether too great to face and would very possibly, if\nprematurely made, shake Nyleptha from her throne.\n\nThat morning we again attended in the Throne Hall, and I could not help\nsmiling to myself when I compared the visit to our last, and reflecting\nthat, if walls could speak, they would have strange tales to tell.\n\nWhat actresses women are! There, high upon her golden throne, draped in\nher blazoned 'kaf' or robe of state, sat the fair Nyleptha, and when Sir\nHenry came in a little late, dressed in the full uniform of an officer\nof her guard and humbly bent himself before her, she merely acknowledged\nhis salute with a careless nod and turned her head coldly aside. It was\na very large Court, for not only did the signing of the laws attract\nmany outside of those whose duty it was to attend, but also the rumour\nthat Nasta was going to publicly ask the hand of Nyleptha in marriage\nhad gone abroad, with the result that the great hall was crowded to its\nutmost capacity. There were our friends the priests in force, headed by\nAgon, who regarded us with a vindictive eye; and a most imposing band\nthey were, with their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden\nchain from which hung the fish-like scales. There, too, were a number\nof the lords, each with a band of brilliantly attired attendants, and\nprominent among them was Nasta, stroking his black beard meditatively\nand looking unusually pleasant. It was a splendid and impressive sight,\nespecially when the officer after having read out each law handed them\nto the Queens to sign, whereon the trumpets blared out and the Queens'\nguard grounded their spears with a crash in salute. This reading and\nsigning of the laws took a long time, but at length it came to an end,\nthe last one reciting that 'whereas distinguished strangers, etc.', and\nproceeding to confer on the three of us the rank of 'lords', together\nwith certain military commands and large estates bestowed by the Queen.\nWhen it was read the trumpets blared and the spears clashed down as\nusual, but I saw some of the lords turn and whisper to each other, while\nNasta ground his teeth. They did not like the favour that was shown to\nus, which under all the circumstances was not perhaps unnatural.\n\nThen there came a pause, and Nasta stepped forward and bowing humbly,\nthough with no humility in his eye, craved a boon at the hands of the\nQueen Nyleptha.\n\nNyleptha turned a little pale, but bowed graciously, and prayed the\n'well-beloved lord' to speak on, whereon in a few straightforward\nsoldier-like words he asked her hand in marriage.\n\nThen, before she could find words to answer, the High Priest Agon took\nup the tale, and in a speech of real eloquence and power pointed out the\nmany advantages of the proposed alliance; how it would consolidate the\nkingdom, for Nasta's dominions, of which he was virtually king, were to\nZu-Vendis much what Scotland used to be to England; how it would gratify\nthe wild mountaineers and be popular among the soldiery, for Nasta was\na famous general; how it would set her dynasty firmly on the throne, and\nwould gain the blessing and approval of the 'Sun', i.e. of the office\nof the High Priest, and so on. Many of his arguments were undoubtedly\nvalid, and there was, looking at it from a political point of view,\neverything to be said for the marriage. But unfortunately it is\ndifficult to play the game of politics with the persons of young and\nlovely queens as though they were ivory effigies of themselves on a\nchessboard. Nyleptha's face, while Agon spouted away, was a perfect\nstudy; she smiled indeed, but beneath the smile it set like a stone, and\nher eyes began to flash ominously.\n\nAt last he stopped, and she prepared herself to answer. Before she did\nso, however, Sorais leant towards her and said in a voice sufficiently\nloud for me to catch what she said, 'Bethink thee well, my sister, ere\nthou dost speak, for methinks that our thrones may hang upon thy words.'\n\nNyleptha made no answer, and with a shrug and a smile Sorais leant back\nagain and listened.\n\n'Of a truth a great honour has been done to me,' she said, 'that my poor\nhand should not only have been asked in marriage, but that Agon here\nshould be so swift to pronounce the blessing of the Sun upon my union.\nMethinks that in another minute he would have wed us fast ere the bride\nhad said her say. Nasta, I thank thee, and I will bethink me of thy\nwords, but now as yet I have no mind for marriage, that is a cup of\nwhich none know the taste until they begin to drink it. Again I thank\nthee, Nasta,' and she made as though she would rise.\n\nThe great lord's face turned almost as black as his beard with fury, for\nhe knew that the words amounted to a final refusal of his suit.\n\n'Thanks be to the Queen for her gracious words,' he said, restraining\nhimself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful, 'my heart\nshall surely treasure them. And now I crave another boon, namely, the\nroyal leave to withdraw myself to my own poor cities in the north till\nsuch time as the Queen shall say my suit nay or yea. Mayhap,' he added,\nwith a sneer, 'the Queen will be pleased to visit me there, and to bring\nwith her these stranger lords,' and he scowled darkly towards us. 'It is\nbut a poor country and a rough, but we are a hardy race of mountaineers,\nand there shall be gathered thirty thousand swordsmen to shout a welcome\nto her.'\n\nThis speech, which was almost a declaration of rebellion, was received\nin complete silence, but Nyleptha flushed up and answered it with\nspirit.\n\n'Oh, surely, Nasta, I will come, and the strange lords in my train, and\nfor every man of thy mountaineers who calls thee Prince, will I bring\ntwo from the lowlands who call me Queen, and we will see which is the\nstaunchest breed. Till then farewell.'\n\nThe trumpets blared out, the Queens rose, and the great assembly broke\nup in murmuring confusion, and for myself I went home with a heavy heart\nforeseeing civil war.\n\nAfter this there was quiet for a few weeks. Curtis and the Queen did\nnot often meet, and exercised the utmost caution not to allow the true\nrelation in which they stood to each other to leak out; but do what they\nwould, rumours as hard to trace as a buzzing fly in a dark room, and yet\nquite as audible, began to hum round and round, and at last to settle on\nher throne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII THE STORM BREAKS\n\n\n\nAnd now it was that the trouble which at first had been but a cloud as\nlarge as a man's hand began to loom very black and big upon our horizon,\nnamely, Sorais' preference for Sir Henry. I saw the storm drawing nearer\nand nearer; and so, poor fellow, did he. The affection of so lovely and\nhighly-placed a woman was not a thing that could in a general way be\nconsidered a calamity by any man, but, situated as Curtis was, it was a\ngrievous burden to bear.\n\nTo begin with, Nyleptha, though altogether charming, was, it must be\nadmitted, of a rather jealous disposition, and was sometimes apt to\nvisit on her lover's head her indignation at the marks of what Alphonse\nwould have called the 'distinguished consideration' with which her\nroyal sister favoured him. Then the enforced secrecy of his relation\nto Nyleptha prevented Curtis from taking some opportunity of putting a\nstop, or trying to put a stop, to this false condition of affairs, by\ntelling Sorais, in a casual but confidential way, that he was going to\nmarry her sister. A third sting in Sir Henry's honey was that he knew\nthat Good was honestly and sincerely attached to the ominous-looking\nbut most attractive Lady of the Night. Indeed, poor Bougwan was wasting\nhimself to a shadow of his fat and jolly self about her, his face\ngetting so thin that his eyeglass would scarcely stick in it; while she,\nwith a sort of careless coquetry, just gave him encouragement enough\nto keep him going, thinking, no doubt, that he might be useful as a\nstalking-horse. I tried to give him a hint, in as delicate a way as\nI could, but he flew into a huff and would not listen to me, so I was\ndetermined to let ill along, for fear of making it worse. Poor Good, he\nreally was very ludicrous in his distress, and went in for all sorts\nof absurdities, under the belief that he was advancing his suit. One\nof them was the writing--with the assistance of one of the grave and\nrevered signiors who instructed us, and who, whatever may have been the\nmeasure of his erudition, did not understand how to scan a line--of a\nmost interminable Zu-Vendi love-song, of which the continually recurring\nrefrain was something about 'I will kiss thee; oh yes, I will kiss\nthee!' Now among the Zu-Vendi it is a common and most harmless thing\nfor young men to serenade ladies at night, as I believe they do in the\nsouthern countries of Europe, and sing all sorts of nonsensical songs to\nthem. The young men may or may not be serious; but no offence is meant\nand none is taken, even by ladies of the highest rank, who accept the\nwhole thing as an English girl would a gracefully-turned compliment.\n\nAvailing himself of this custom, Good bethought him that would serenade\nSorais, whose private apartments, together with those of her maidens,\nwere exactly opposite our own, on the further side of a narrow courtyard\nwhich divided one section of the great palace from another. Accordingly,\nhaving armed himself with a native zither, on which, being an adept\nwith the light guitar, he had easily learned to strum, he proceeded at\nmidnight--the fashionable hour for this sort of caterwauling--to make\nnight hideous with his amorous yells. I was fast asleep when they began,\nbut they soon woke me up--for Good possesses a tremendous voice and\nhas no notion of time--and I ran to my window-place to see what was the\nmatter. And there, standing in the full moonlight in the courtyard, I\nperceived Good, adorned with an enormous ostrich feather head-dress and\na flowing silken cloak, which it is the right thing to wear upon these\noccasions, and shouting out the abominable song which he and the old\ngentleman had evolved, to a jerky, jingling accompaniment. From the\ndirection of the quarters of the maids of honour came a succession of\nfaint sniggerings; but the apartments of Sorais herself--whom I devoutly\npitied if she happened to be there--were silent as the grave. There\nwas absolutely no end to that awful song, with its eternal 'I will kiss\nthee!' and at last neither I nor Sir Henry, whom I had summoned to\nenjoy the sight, could stand it any longer; so, remembering the dear old\nstory, I put my head to the window opening, and shouted, 'For Heaven's\nsake, Good, don't go on talking about it, but _kiss_ her and let's all\ngo to sleep!' That choked him off, and we had no more serenading.\n\nThe whole thing formed a laughable incident in a tragic business. How\ndeeply thankful we ought to be that even the most serious matters have\ngenerally a silver lining about them in the shape of a joke, if only\npeople could see it. The sense of humour is a very valuable possession\nin life, and ought to be cultivated in the Board schools--especially in\nScotland.\n\nWell, the more Sir Henry held off the more Sorais came on, as is not\nuncommon in such cases, till at last things got very queer indeed.\nEvidently she was, by some strange perversity of mind, quite blinded to\nthe true state of the case; and I, for one, greatly dreaded the moment\nof her awakening. Sorais was a dangerous woman to be mixed up with,\neither with or without one's consent. At last the evil moment came, as I\nsaw it must come. One fine day, Good having gone out hawking, Sir Henry\nand I were sitting quietly talking over the situation, especially with\nreference to Sorais, when a Court messenger arrived with a written note,\nwhich we with some difficulty deciphered, and which was to the effect\nthat 'the Queen Sorais commanded the attendance of the Lord Incubu in\nher private apartments, whither he would be conducted by the bearer'.\n\n'Oh my word!' groaned Sir Henry. 'Can't you go instead, old fellow?'\n\n'Not if I know it,' I said with vigour. 'I had rather face a wounded\nelephant with a shot-gun. Take care of your own business, my boy. If you\nwill be so fascinating you must take the consequences. I would not be in\nyour place for an empire.'\n\n'You remind me of when I was going to be flogged at school and the other\nboys came to console me,' he said gloomily. 'What right has this Queen\nto command my attendance, I should like to know? I won't go.'\n\n'But you must; you are one of her officers and bound to obey her, and\nshe knows it. And after all it will soon be over.'\n\n'That's just what they used to say,' he said again. 'I only hope she\nwon't put a knife into me. I believe that she is quite capable of it.'\nAnd off he started very faintheartedly, and no wonder.\n\nI sat and waited, and at the end of about forty-five minutes he\nreturned, looking a good deal worse than when he went.\n\n'Give me something to drink,' he said hoarsely.\n\nI got him a cup of wine, and asked what was the matter.\n\n'What is the matter? Why if ever there was trouble there's trouble\nnow. You know when I left you? Well, I was shown straight into Sorais'\nprivate chamber, and a wonderful place it is; and there she sat, quite\nalone, upon a silken couch at the end of the room, playing gently upon\nthat zither of hers. I stood before her, and for a while she took no\nnotice of me, but kept on playing and singing a little, and very sweet\nmusic it was. At last she looked up and smiled.\n\n'\"So thou art come,\" she said. \"I thought perchance thou hadst gone\nabout the Queen Nyleptha's business. Thou art ever on her business, and\nI doubt not a good servant and a true.\"\n\n'To this I merely bowed, and said I was there to receive the Queen's\nword.\n\n'\"Ah yes, I would talk with thee, but be thou seated. It wearies me to\nlook so high,\" and she made room for me beside her on the couch, placing\nherself with her back against the end, so as to have a view of my face.\n\n'\"It is not meet,\" I said, \"that I should make myself equal with the\nQueen.\"\n\n'\"I said be seated,\" was her answer, so I sat down, and she began to\nlook at me with those dark eyes of hers. There she sat like an incarnate\nspirit of beauty, hardly talking at all, and when she did, very low, but\nall the while looking at me. There was a white flower in her black hair,\nand I tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals, but it was of\nno use. At last, whether it was her gaze, or the perfume in her hair, or\nwhat I do not know, but I almost felt as though I was being mesmerized.\nAt last she roused herself.\n\n'\"Incubu,\" she said, \"lovest thou power?\"\n\n'I replied that I supposed all men loved power of one sort or another.\n\n'\"Thou shalt have it,\" she said. \"Lovest thou wealth?\"\n\n'I said I liked wealth for what it brought.\n\n'\"Thou shalt have it,\" she said. \"And lovest thou beauty?\"\n\n'To this I replied that I was very fond of statuary and architecture,\nor something silly of that sort, at which she frowned, and there was a\npause. By this time my nerves were on such a stretch that I was shaking\nlike a leaf. I knew that something awful was going to happen, but she\nheld me under a kind of spell, and I could not help myself.\n\n'\"Incubu,\" she said at length, \"wouldst thou be a king? Listen, wouldst\nthou be a king? Behold, stranger, I am minded to make thee king of all\nZu-Vendis, ay and husband of Sorais of the Night. Nay, peace and hear\nme. To no man among my people had I thus opened out my secret heart, but\nthou art an outlander and therefore I speak without shame, knowing all I\nhave to offer and how hard it had been thee to ask. See, a crown lies at\nthy feet, my lord Incubu, and with that fortune a woman whom some have\nwished to woo. Now mayst thou answer, oh my chosen, and soft shall thy\nwords fall upon mine ears.\"\n\n'\"Oh Sorais,\" I said, \"I pray thee speak not thus\"--you see I had\nnot time to pick and choose my words--\"for this thing cannot be. I am\nbetrothed to thy sister Nyleptha, oh Sorais, and I love her and her\nalone.\"\n\n'Next moment it struck me that I had said an awful thing, and I looked\nup to see the results. When I spoke, Sorais' face was hidden in her\nhands, and as my words reached her she slowly raised it, and I shrank\nback dismayed. It was ashy white, and her eyes were flaming. She rose to\nher feet and seemed to be choking, but the awful thing was that she was\nso quiet about it all. Once she looked at a side table, on which lay a\ndagger, and from it to me, as though she thought of killing me; but she\ndid not take it up. At last she spoke one word, and one only--\n\n'\"_Go!_\"\n\n'And I went, and glad enough I was to get out of it, and here I am. Give\nme another cup of wine, there's a good fellow, and tell me, what is to\nbe done?'\n\nI shook my head, for the affair was indeed serious. As one of the poets\nsays,\n\n\n'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned',\n\n\nmore especially if the woman is a queen and a Sorais, and indeed I\nfeared the very worst, including imminent danger to ourselves.\n\n'Nyleptha had better be told of this at once,' I said, 'and perhaps I\nhad better tell her; she might receive your account with suspicion.'\n\n'Who is captain of her guard tonight?' I went on.\n\n'Good.'\n\n'Very well then, there will be no chance of her being got at. Don't look\nsurprised. I don't think that her sister would stick at that. I suppose\none must tell Good of what has happened.'\n\n'Oh, I don't know,' said Sir Henry. 'It would hurt his feelings, poor\nfellow! You see, he takes a lively personal interest in Sorais.'\n\n'That's true; and after all, perhaps there is no need to tell him. He\nwill find out the truth soon enough. Now, you mark my words, Sorais will\nthrow in her lot with Nasta, who is sulking up in the North there,\nand there will be such a war as has not been known in Zu-Vendis for\ncenturies. Look there!' and I pointed to two Court messengers, who were\nspeeding away from the door of Sorais' private apartments. 'Now follow\nme,' and I ran up a stairway into an outlook tower that rose from the\nroof of our quarters, taking the spyglass with me, and looked out\nover the palace wall. The first thing we saw was one of the messengers\nspeeding towards the Temple, bearing, without any doubt, the Queen's\nword to the High Priest Agon, but for the other I searched in vain.\nPresently, however, I spied a horseman riding furiously through the\nnorthern gate of the city, and in him I recognized the other messenger.\n\n'Ah!' I said, 'Sorais is a woman of spirit. She is acting at once, and\nwill strike quick and hard. You have insulted her, my boy, and the blood\nwill flow in rivers before the stain is washed away, and yours with it,\nif she can get hold of you. Well, I'm off to Nyleptha. Just you stop\nwhere you are, old fellow, and try to get your nerves straight again.\nYou'll need them all, I can tell you, unless I have observed human\nnature in the rough for fifty years for nothing.' And off I went\naccordingly.\n\nI gained audience of the Queen without trouble. She was expecting\nCurtis, and was not best pleased to see my mahogany-coloured face\ninstead.\n\n'Is there aught wrong with my Lord, Macumazahn, that he waits not upon\nme? Say, is he sick?'\n\nI said that he was well enough, and then, without further ado, I plunged\ninto my story and told it from beginning to end. Oh, what a rage she\nflew into! It was a sight to see her, she looked so lovely.\n\n'How darest thou come to me with such a tale?' she cried. 'It is a lie\nto say that my Lord was making love to Sorais, my sister.'\n\n'Pardon me, oh Queen,' I answered, 'I said that Sorais was making love\nto thy lord.'\n\n'Spin me no spiders' webs of words. Is not the thing the same thing? The\none giveth, the other taketh; but the gift passes, and what matters it\nwhich is the most guilty? Sorais! oh, I hate her--Sorais is a queen\nand my sister. She had not stooped so low had he not shown the way.\nOh, truly hath the poet said that man is like a snake, whom to touch is\npoison, and whom none can hold.'\n\n'The remark, oh Queen, is excellent, but methinks thou hast misread the\npoet. Nyleptha,' I went on, 'thou knowest well that thy words are empty\nfoolishness, and that this is no time for folly.'\n\n'How darest thou?' she broke in, stamping her foot. 'Hast my false lord\nsent thee to me to insult me also? Who art thou, stranger, that thou\nshouldst speak to me, the Queen, after this sort? How darest thou?'\n\n'Yea, I dare. Listen. The moments which thou dost waste in idle anger\nmay well cost thee thy crown and all of us our lives. Already Sorais'\nhorsemen go forth and call to arms. In three days' time Nasta will rouse\nhimself in his fastnesses like a lion in the evening, and his growling\nwill be heard throughout the North. The \"Lady of the Night\" (Sorais)\nhath a sweet voice, and she will not sing in vain. Her banner will be\nborne from range to range and valley to valley, and warriors will spring\nup in its track like dust beneath a whirlwind; half the army will echo\nher war-cry; and in every town and hamlet of this wide land the priests\nwill call out against the foreigner and will preach her cause as holy. I\nhave spoken, oh Queen!'\n\nNyleptha was quite calm now; her jealous anger had passed; and putting\noff the character of a lovely headstrong lady, with a rapidity and\ncompleteness that distinguished her, she put on that of a queen and a\nwoman of business. The transformation was sudden but entire.\n\n'Thy words are very wise, Macumazahn. Forgive me my folly. Ah, what a\nQueen I should be if only I had no heart! To be heartless--that is to\nconquer all. Passion is like the lightning, it is beautiful, and it\nlinks the earth to heaven, but alas it blinds!\n\n'And thou thinkest that my sister Sorais would levy war upon me. So be\nit. She shall not prevail against me. I, too, have my friends and my\nretainers. There are many, I say, who will shout \"Nyleptha!\" when my\npennon runs up on peak and pinnacle, and the light of my beacon fires\nleaps tonight from crag to crag, bearing the message of my war. I will\nbreak her strength and scatter her armies. Eternal night shall be the\nportion of Sorais of the Night. Give me that parchment and the ink. So.\nNow summon the officer in the ante-room. He is a trusty man.'\n\nI did as I was bid! and the man, a veteran and quiet-looking gentleman\nof the guard, named Kara, entered, bowing low.\n\n'Take this parchment,' said Nyleptha; 'it is thy warrant; and guard\nevery place of in and outgoing in the apartments of my sister Sorais,\nthe \"Lady of the Night\", and a Queen of the Zu-Vendi. Let none come in\nand none go out, or thy life shall pay the cost.'\n\nThe man looked startled, but he merely said, 'The Queen's word be done,'\nand departed. Then Nyleptha sent a messenger to Sir Henry, and presently\nhe arrived looking uncommonly uncomfortable. I thought that another\noutburst was about to follow, but wonderful are the ways of woman; she\nsaid not a word about Sorais and his supposed inconstancy, greeting him\nwith a friendly nod, and stating simply that she required his advice\nupon high matters. All the same there was a look in her eye, and a sort\nof suppressed energy in her manner towards him, that makes me think\nthat she had not forgotten the affair, but was keeping it for a private\noccasion.\n\nJust after Curtis arrived the officer returned, and reported that Sorais\nwas _gone_. The bird had flown to the Temple, stating that she was\ngoing, as was sometimes the custom among Zu-Vendi ladies of rank, to\nspend the night in meditation before the altar. We looked at each other\nsignificantly. The blow had fallen very soon.\n\nThen we set to work.\n\nGenerals who could be trusted were summoned from their quarters, and\nas much of the State affairs as was thought desirable was told to each,\nstrict injunctions being given to them to get all their available force\ntogether. The same was done with such of the more powerful lords as\nNyleptha knew she could rely on, several of whom left that very day for\ndistant parts of the country to gather up their tribesmen and retainers.\nSealed orders were dispatched to the rulers of far-off cities, and some\ntwenty messengers were sent off before nightfall with instructions to\nride early and late till they reached the distant chiefs to whom their\nletters were addressed: also many spies were set to work. All the\nafternoon and evening we laboured, assisted by some confidential\nscribes, Nyleptha showing an energy and resource of mind that astonished\nme, and it was eight o'clock before we got back to our quarters. Here we\nheard from Alphonse, who was deeply aggrieved because our non-return had\nspoilt his dinner (for he had turned cook again now), that Good had come\nback from his hawking and gone on duty. As instructions had already been\ngiven to the officer of the outer guard to double the sentries at the\ngate, and as we had no reason to fear any immediate danger, we did not\nthink it worth while to hunt him up and tell him anything of what had\npassed, which at best was, under the peculiar circumstances of the case,\none of those tasks that one prefers to postpone, so after swallowing\nour food we turned in to get some much-needed rest. Before we did\nso, however, it occurred to Curtis to tell old Umslopogaas to keep\na look-out in the neighbourhood of Nyleptha's private apartments.\nUmslopogaas was now well known about the place, and by the Queen's order\nallowed to pass whither he would by the guards, a permission of which he\noften availed himself by roaming about the palace during the still\nhours in a nocturnal fashion that he favoured, and which is by no means\nuncommon amongst black men generally. His presence in the corridors\nwould not, therefore, be likely to excite remark. Without any comment\nthe Zulu took up his axe and departed, and we also departed to bed.\n\nI seemed to have been asleep but a few minutes when I was awakened by a\npeculiar sensation of uneasiness. I felt that somebody was in the room\nand looking at me, and instantly sat up, to see to my surprise that it\nwas already dawn, and that there, standing at the foot of my couch and\nlooking peculiarly grim and gaunt in the grey light, was Umslopogaas\nhimself.\n\n'How long hast thou been there?' I asked testily, for it is not pleasant\nto be aroused in such a fashion.\n\n'Mayhap the half of an hour, Macumazahn. I have a word for thee.'\n\n'Speak on,' I said, now wide enough awake.\n\n'As I was bid I went last night to the place of the White Queen and\nhid myself behind a pillar in the second anteroom, beyond which is the\nsleeping-place of the Queen. Bougwan (Good) was in the first anteroom\nalone, and outside the curtain of that room was a sentry, but I had a\nmind to see if I could pass in unseen, and I did, gliding behind them\nboth. There I waited for many hours, when suddenly I perceived a dark\nfigure coming secretly towards me. It was the figure of a woman, and in\nher hand she held a dagger. Behind that figure crept another unseen by\nthe woman. It was Bougwan following in her tracks. His shoes were off,\nand for so fat a man he followed very well. The woman passed me, and the\nstarlight shone upon her face.'\n\n'Who was it?' I asked impatiently.\n\n'The face was the face of the \"Lady of the Night\", and of a truth she is\nwell named.\n\n'I waited, and Bougwan passed me also. Then I followed. So we went\nslowly and without a sound up the long chamber. First the woman, then\nBougwan, and then I; and the woman saw not Bougwan, and Bougwan saw not\nme. At last the \"Lady of the Night\" came to the curtains that shut off\nthe sleeping place of the White Queen, and put out her left hand to part\nthem. She passed through, and so did Bougwan, and so did I. At the far\nend of the room is the bed of the Queen, and on it she lay very fast\nasleep. I could hear her breathe, and see one white arm lying on the\ncoverlid like a streak of snow on the dry grass. The \"Lady of the Night\"\ndoubled herself thus, and with the long knife lifted crept towards the\nbed. So straight did she gaze thereat that she never thought to look\nbehind her. When she was quite close Bougwan touched her on the arm, and\nshe caught her breath and turned, and I saw the knife flash, and heard\nit strike. Well was it for Bougwan that he had the skin of iron on him,\nor he had been pierced. Then for the first time he saw who the woman\nwas, and without a word he fell back astonished, and unable to speak.\nShe, too, was astonished, and spoke not, but suddenly she laid her\nfinger on her lip, thus, and walked towards and through the curtain,\nand with her went Bougwan. So close did she pass to me that her dress\ntouched me, and I was nigh to slaying her as she went. In the first\nouter room she spoke to Bougwan in a whisper and, clasping her hands\nthus, she pleaded with him, but what she said I know not. And so they\npassed on to the second outer room, she pleading and he shaking his\nhead, and saying, \"Nay, nay, nay\". And it seemed to me that he was about\nto call the guard, when she stopped talking and looked at him with great\neyes, and I saw that he was bewitched by her beauty. Then she stretched\nout her hand and he kissed it, whereon I gathered myself together to\nadvance and take her, seeing that now had Bougwan become a woman, and no\nlonger knew the good from the evil, when behold! she was gone.'\n\n'Gone!' I ejaculated.\n\n'Ay, gone, and there stood Bougwan staring at the wall like one asleep,\nand presently he went too, and I waited a while and came away also.'\n\n'Art thou sure, Umslopogaas,' said I, 'that thou hast not been a dreamer\nthis night?'\n\nIn reply he opened his left hand, and produced about three inches of a\nblade of a dagger of the finest steel. 'If I be, Macumazahn, behold what\nthe dream left with me. The knife broke upon Bougwan's bosom and as I\npassed I picked this up in the sleeping-place of the White Queen.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII WAR! RED WAR!\n\n\n\nTelling Umslopogaas to wait, I tumbled into my clothes and went off\nwith him to Sir Henry's room, where the Zulu repeated his story word for\nword. It was a sight to watch Curtis' face as he heard it.\n\n'Great Heavens!' he said: 'here have I been sleeping away while Nyleptha\nwas nearly murdered--and all through me, too. What a fiend that Sorais\nmust be! It would have served her well if Umslopogaas had cut her down\nin the act.'\n\n'Ay,' said the Zulu. 'Fear not; I should have slain her ere she struck.\nI was but waiting the moment.'\n\nI said nothing, but I could not help thinking that many a thousand\ndoomed lives would have been saved if he had meted out to Sorais the\nfate she meant for her sister. And, as the issue proved, I was right.\n\nAfter he had told his tale Umslopogaas went off unconcernedly to get his\nmorning meal, and Sir Henry and I fell to talking.\n\nAt first he was very bitter against Good, who, he said, was no longer\nto be trusted, having designedly allowed Sorais to escape by some secret\nstair when it was his duty to have handed her over to justice. Indeed,\nhe spoke in the most unmeasured terms on the matter. I let him run\non awhile, reflecting to myself how easy we find it to be hard on the\nweaknesses of others, and how tender we are to our own.\n\n'Really, my dear fellow,' I said at length, 'one would never think, to\nhear you talk, that you were the man who had an interview with this\nsame lady yesterday, and found it rather difficult to resist her\nfascinations, notwithstanding your ties to one of the loveliest and most\nloving women in the world. Now suppose it was Nyleptha who had tried to\nmurder Sorais, and _you_ had caught her, and she had pleaded with you,\nwould you have been so very eager to hand her over to an open shame, and\nto death by fire? Just look at the matter through Good's eyeglass for a\nminute before you denounce an old friend as a scoundrel.'\n\nHe listened to this jobation submissively, and then frankly acknowledged\nthat he had spoken hardly. It is one of the best points in Sir Henry's\ncharacter that he is always ready to admit it when he is in the wrong.\n\nBut, though I spoke up thus for Good, I was not blind to the fact that,\nhowever natural his behaviour might be, it was obvious that he was being\ninvolved in a very awkward and disgraceful complication. A foul and\nwicked murder had been attempted, and he had let the murderess escape,\nand thereby, among other things, allowed her to gain a complete\nascendency over himself. In fact, he was in a fair way to become her\ntool--and no more dreadful fate can befall a man than to become the tool\nof an unscrupulous woman, or indeed of any woman. There is but one\nend to it: when he is broken, or has served her purpose, he is thrown\naway--turned out on the world to hunt for his lost self-respect. Whilst\nI was pondering thus, and wondering what was to be done--for the whole\nsubject was a thorny one--I suddenly heard a great clamour in the\ncourtyard outside, and distinguished the voice of Umslopogaas and\nAlphonse, the former cursing furiously, and the latter yelling in\nterror.\n\nHurrying out to see what was the matter, I was met by a ludicrous sight.\nThe little Frenchman was running up the courtyard at an extraordinary\nspeed, and after him sped Umslopogaas like a great greyhound. Just as I\ncame out he caught him, and, lifting him right off his legs, carried him\nsome paces to a beautiful but very dense flowering shrub which bore a\nflower not unlike the gardenia, but was covered with short thorns. Next,\ndespite his howls and struggles, he with one mighty thrust plunged poor\nAlphonse head first into the bush, so that nothing but the calves of his\nlegs and heels remained in evidence. Then, satisfied with what he\nhad done, the Zulu folded his arms and stood grimly contemplating the\nFrenchman's kicks, and listening to his yells, which were awful.\n\n'What art thou doing?' I said, running up. 'Wouldst thou kill the man?\nPull him out of the bush!'\n\nWith a savage grunt he obeyed, seizing the wretched Alphonse by the\nankle, and with a jerk that must have nearly dislocated it, tearing\nhim out of the heart of the shrub. Never did I see such a sight as he\npresented, his clothes half torn off his back, and bleeding as he was\nin every direction from the sharp thorns. There he lay and yelled and\nrolled, and there was no getting anything out of him.\n\nAt last, however, he got up and, ensconcing himself behind me, cursed\nold Umslopogaas by every saint in the calendar, vowing by the blood of\nhis heroic grandfather that he would poison him, and 'have his revenge'.\n\nAt last I got to the truth of the matter. It appeared that Alphonse\nhabitually cooked Umslopogaas's porridge, which the latter ate for\nbreakfast in the corner of the courtyard, just as he would have done at\nhome in Zululand, from a gourd, and with a wooden spoon. Now Umslopogaas\nhad, like many Zulus, a great horror of fish, which he considered a\nspecies of water-snake; so Alphonse, who was as fond of playing tricks\nas a monkey, and who was also a consummate cook, determined to make him\neat some. Accordingly he grated up a quantity of white fish very finely,\nand mixed it with the Zulu's porridge, who swallowed it nearly all down\nin ignorance of what he was eating. But, unfortunately for Alphonse, he\ncould not restrain his joy at this sight, and came capering and peering\nround, till at last Umslopogaas, who was very clever in his way,\nsuspected something, and, after a careful examination of the remains of\nhis porridge, discovered 'the buffalo heifer's trick', and, in revenge,\nserved him as I have said. Indeed, the little man was fortunate not\nto get a broken neck for his pains; for, as one would have thought, he\nmight have learnt from the episode of his display of axemanship that 'le\nMonsieur noir' was an ill person to play practical jokes upon.\n\nThis incident was unimportant enough in itself, but I narrate it because\nit led to serious consequences. As soon as he had stanched the bleeding\nfrom his scratches and washed himself, Alphonse went off still cursing,\nto recover his temper, a process which I knew from experience would take\na very long time. When he had gone I gave Umslopogaas a jobation and\ntold him that I was ashamed of his behaviour.\n\n'Ah, well, Macumazahn,' he said, 'you must be gentle with me, for\nhere is not my place. I am weary of it, weary to death of eating and\ndrinking, of sleeping and giving in marriage. I love not this soft\nlife in stone houses that takes the heart out of a man, and turns his\nstrength to water and his flesh to fat. I love not the white robes and\nthe delicate women, the blowing of trumpets and the flying of hawks.\nWhen we fought the Masai at the kraal yonder, ah, then life was worth\nthe living, but here is never a blow struck in anger, and I begin to\nthink I shall go the way of my fathers and lift Inkosi-kaas no more,'\nand he held up the axe and gazed at it in sorrow.\n\n'Ah,' I said, 'that is thy complaint, is it? Thou hast the\nblood-sickness, hast thou? And the Woodpecker wants a tree. And at thy\nage, too. Shame on thee! Umslopogaas.'\n\n'Ay, Macumazahn, mine is a red trade, yet is it better and more honest\nthan some. Better is it to slay a man in fair fight than to suck out his\nheart's blood in buying and selling and usury after your white fashion.\nMany a man have I slain, yet is there never a one that I should fear to\nlook in the face again, ay, many are there who once were friends, and\nwhom I should be right glad to snuff with. But there! there! thou hast\nthy ways, and I mine: each to his own people and his own place. The\nhigh-veldt ox will die in the fat bush country, and so is it with me,\nMacumazahn. I am rough, I know it, and when my blood is warm I know not\nwhat to do, but yet wilt thou be sorry when the night swallows me and\nI am utterly lost in blackness, for in thy heart thou lovest me, my\nfather, Macumazahn the fox, though I be nought but a broken-down Zulu\nwar-dog--a chief for whom there is no room in his own kraal, an outcast\nand a wanderer in strange places: ay, I love thee, Macumazahn, for we\nhave grown grey together, and there is that between us that cannot be\nseen, and yet is too strong for breaking;' and he took his snuff-box,\nwhich was made of an old brass cartridge, from the slit in his ear where\nhe always carried it, and handed it to me for me to help myself.\n\nI took the pinch of snuff with some emotion. It was quite true, I was\nmuch attached to the bloodthirsty old ruffian. I do not know what was\nthe charm of his character, but it had a charm; perhaps it was its\nfierce honesty and directness; perhaps one admired his almost superhuman\nskill and strength, or it may have been simply that he was so absolutely\nunique. Frankly, with all my experience of savages, I never knew a man\nquite like him, he was so wise and yet such a child with it all; and\nthough it seems laughable to say so, like the hero of the Yankee parody,\nhe 'had a tender heart'. Anyway, I was very fond of him, though I should\nnever have thought of telling him so.\n\n'Ay, old wolf,' I said, 'thine is a strange love. Thou wouldst split me\nto the chin if I stood in thy path tomorrow.'\n\n'Thou speakest truth, Macumazahn, that would I if it came in the way of\nduty, but I should love thee all the same when the blow had gone fairly\nhome. Is there any chance of some fighting here, Macumazahn?' he went on\nin an insinuating voice. 'Methought that what I saw last night did show\nthat the two great Queens were vexed one with another. Else had the\n\"Lady of the Night\" not brought that dagger with her.'\n\nI agreed with him that it showed that more or less pique and irritation\nexisted between the ladies, and told him how things stood, and that they\nwere quarrelling over Incubu.\n\n'Ah, is it so?' he exclaimed, springing up in delight; 'then will there\nbe war as surely as the rivers rise in the rains--war to the end. Women\nlove the last blow as well as the last word, and when they fight for\nlove they are pitiless as a wounded buffalo. See thou, Macumazahn, a\nwoman will swim through blood to her desire, and think nought of it.\nWith these eyes have I seen it once, and twice also. Ah, Macumazahn,\nwe shall see this fine place of houses burning yet, and hear the battle\ncries come ringing up the street. After all, I have not wandered for\nnothing. Can this folk fight, think ye?'\n\nJust then Sir Henry joined us, and Good arrived, too, from another\ndirection, looking very pale and hollow-eyed. The moment Umslopogaas saw\nthe latter he stopped his bloodthirsty talk and greeted him.\n\n'Ah, Bougwan,' he cried, 'greeting to thee, Inkoos! Thou art surely\nweary. Didst thou hunt too much yesterday?' Then, without waiting for an\nanswer, he went on--\n\n'Listen, Bougwan, and I will tell thee a story; it is about a woman,\ntherefore wilt thou hear it, is it not so?\n\n'There was a man and he had a brother, and there was a woman who loved\nthe man's brother and was beloved of the man. But the man's brother had\na favourite wife and loved not the woman, and he made a mock of her.\nThen the woman, being very cunning and fierce-hearted for revenge, took\ncounsel with herself and said to the man, \"I love thee, and if thou wilt\nmake war upon thy brother I will marry thee.\" And he knew it was a lie,\nyet because of his great love of the woman, who was very fair, did he\nlisten to her words and made war. And when many people had been killed\nhis brother sent to him, saying, \"Why slayest thou me? What hurt have I\ndone unto thee? From my youth up have I not loved thee? When thou wast\nlittle did I not nurture thee, and have we not gone down to war together\nand divided the cattle, girl by girl, ox by ox, and cow by cow? Why\nslayest thou me, my brother, son of my own mother?\"\n\n'Then the man's heart was heavy, and he knew that his path was evil,\nand he put aside the tempting of the woman and ceased to make war on his\nbrother, and lived at peace in the same kraal with him. And after a time\nthe woman came to him and said, \"I have lost the past, I will be thy\nwife.\" And in his heart he knew that it was a lie and that she thought\nthe evil thing, yet because of his love did he take her to wife.\n\n'And the very night that they were wed, when the man was plunged into a\ndeep sleep, did the woman arise and take his axe from his hand and creep\ninto the hut of his brother and slay him in his rest. Then did she slink\nback like a gorged lioness and place the thong of the red axe back upon\nhis wrist and go her ways.\n\n'And at the dawning the people came shouting, \"Lousta is slain in the\nnight,\" and they came unto the hut of the man, and there he lay asleep\nand by him was the red axe. Then did they remember the war and say, \"Lo!\nhe hath of a surety slain his brother,\" and they would have taken and\nkilled him, but he rose and fled swiftly, and as he fleeted by he slew\nthe woman.\n\n'But death could not wipe out the evil she had done, and on him rested\nthe weight of all her sin. Therefore is he an outcast and his name a\nscorn among his own people; for on him, and him only, resteth the burden\nof her who betrayed. And, therefore, does he wander afar, without a\nkraal and without an ox or a wife, and therefore will he die afar like a\nstricken buck and his name be accursed from generation to generation,\nin that the people say that he slew his brother, Lousta, by treachery in\nthe night-time.'\n\nThe old Zulu paused, and I saw that he was deeply agitated by his own\nstory. Presently he lifted his head, which he had bowed to his breast,\nand went on:\n\n'I was the man, Bougwan. Ou! I was that man, and now hark thou! Even as\nI am so wilt thou be--a tool, a plaything, an ox of burden to carry the\nevil deeds of another. Listen! When thou didst creep after the \"Lady\nof the Night\" I was hard upon thy track. When she struck thee with the\nknife in the sleeping place of the White Queen I was there also; when\nthou didst let her slip away like a snake in the stones I saw thee, and\nI knew that she had bewitched thee and that a true man had abandoned the\ntruth, and he who aforetime loved a straight path had taken a crooked\nway. Forgive me, my father, if my words are sharp, but out of a full\nheart are they spoken. See her no more, so shalt thou go down with\nhonour to the grave. Else because of the beauty of a woman that weareth\nas a garment of fur shalt thou be even as I am, and perchance with more\ncause. I have said.'\n\nThroughout this long and eloquent address Good had been perfectly\nsilent, but when the tale began to shape itself so aptly to his own\ncase, he coloured up, and when he learnt that what had passed between\nhim and Sorais had been overseen he was evidently much distressed. And\nnow, when at last he spoke, it was in a tone of humility quite foreign\nto him.\n\n'I must say,' he said, with a bitter little laugh, 'that I scarcely\nthought that I should live to be taught my duty by a Zulu; but it just\nshows what we can come to. I wonder if you fellows can understand how\nhumiliated I feel, and the bitterest part of it is that I deserve it\nall. Of course I should have handed Sorais over to the guard, but\nI could not, and that is a fact. I let her go and I promised to say\nnothing, more is the shame to me. She told me that if I would side\nwith her she would marry me and make me king of this country, but thank\ngoodness I did find the heart to say that even to marry her I could not\ndesert my friends. And now you can do what you like, I deserve it all.\nAll I have to say is that I hope that you may never love a woman with\nall your heart and then be so sorely tempted of her,' and he turned to\ngo.\n\n'Look here, old fellow,' said Sir Henry, 'just stop a minute. I have a\nlittle tale to tell you too.' And he went on to narrate what had taken\nplace on the previous day between Sorais and himself.\n\nThis was a finishing stroke to poor Good. It is not pleasant to any man\nto learn that he has been made a tool of, but when the circumstances are\nas peculiarly atrocious as in the present case, it is about as bitter a\npill as anybody can be called on to swallow.\n\n'Do you know,' he said, 'I think that between you, you fellows have\nabout worked a cure,' and he turned and walked away, and I for one felt\nvery sorry for him. Ah, if the moths would always carefully avoid the\ncandle, how few burnt wings there would be!\n\nThat day was a Court day, when the Queens sat in the great hall and\nreceived petitions, discussed laws, money grants, and so forth, and\nthither we adjourned shortly afterwards. On our way we were joined by\nGood, who was looking exceedingly depressed.\n\nWhen we got into the hall Nyleptha was already on her throne and\nproceeding with business as usual, surrounded by councillors, courtiers,\nlawyers, priests, and an unusually strong guard. It was, however,\neasy to see from the air of excitement and expectation on the faces\nof everybody present that nobody was paying much attention to ordinary\naffairs, the fact being that the knowledge that civil war was imminent\nhad now got abroad. We saluted Nyleptha and took our accustomed places,\nand for a little while things went on as usual, when suddenly the\ntrumpets began to call outside the palace, and from the great crowd that\nwas gathered there in anticipation of some unusual event there rose a\nroar of '_Sorais! Sorais!_'\n\nThen came the roll of many chariot wheels, and presently the great\ncurtains at the end of the hall were drawn wide and through them entered\nthe 'Lady of the Night' herself. Nor did she come alone. Preceding her\nwas Agon, the High Priest, arrayed in his most gorgeous vestments, and\non either side were other priests. The reason for their presence was\nobvious--coming with them it would have been sacrilege to attempt to\ndetain her. Behind her were a number of the great lords, and behind them\na small body of picked guards. A glance at Sorais herself was enough to\nshow that her mission was of no peaceful kind, for in place of her gold\nembroidered 'kaf' she wore a shining tunic formed of golden scales, and\non her head a little golden helmet. In her hand, too, she bore a toy\nspear, beautifully made and fashioned of solid silver. Up the hall she\ncame, looking like a lioness in her conscious pride and beauty, and as\nshe came the spectators fell back bowing and made a path for her. By the\nsacred stone she halted, and laying her hand on it, she cried out with a\nloud voice to Nyleptha on the throne, 'Hail, oh Queen!'\n\n'All hail, my royal sister!' answered Nyleptha. 'Draw thou near. Fear\nnot, I give thee safe conduct.'\n\nSorais answered with a haughty look, and swept on up the hall till she\nstood right before the thrones.\n\n'A boon, oh Queen!' she cried again.\n\n'Speak on, my sister; what is there that I can give thee who hath half\nour kingdom?'\n\n'Thou canst tell me a true word--me and the people of Zu-Vendis. Art\nthou, or art thou not, about to take this foreign wolf,' and she pointed\nto Sir Henry with her toy spear, 'to be a husband to thee, and share thy\nbed and throne?'\n\nCurtis winced at this, and turning towards Sorais, said to her in a low\nvoice, 'Methinks that yesterday thou hadst other names than wolf to call\nme by, oh Queen!' and I saw her bite her lips as, like a danger flag,\nthe blood flamed red upon her face. As for Nyleptha, who is nothing if\nnot original, she, seeing that the thing was out, and that there was\nnothing further to be gained by concealment, answered the question in\na novel and effectual manner, inspired thereto, as I firmly believe, by\ncoquetry and a desire to triumph over her rival.\n\nUp she rose and, descending from the throne, swept in all the glory\nof her royal grace on to where her lover stood. There she stopped and\nuntwined the golden snake that was wound around her arm. Then she bade\nhim kneel, and he dropped on one knee on the marble before her, and\nnext, taking the golden snake with both her hands, she bent the pure\nsoft metal round his neck, and when it was fast, deliberately kissed him\non the brow and called him her 'dear lord'.\n\n'Thou seest,' she said, when the excited murmur of the spectators had\ndied away, addressing her sister as Sir Henry rose to his feet, 'I\nhave put my collar round the \"wolf's\" neck, and behold! he shall be my\nwatchdog, and that is my answer to thee, Queen Sorais, my sister, and to\nthose with thee. Fear not,' she went on, smiling sweetly on her lover,\nand pointing to the golden snake she had twined round his massive\nthroat, 'if my yoke be heavy, yet is it of pure gold, and it shall not\ngall thee.'\n\nThen, turning to the audience, she continued in a clear proud tone, 'Ay,\nLady of the Night, Lords, Priests, and People here gathered together, by\nthis sign do I take the foreigner to husband, even here in the face of\nyou all. What, am I a Queen, and yet not free to choose the man whom\nI will love? Then should I be lower than the meanest girl in all my\nprovinces. Nay, he hath won my heart, and with it goes my hand, and\nthrone, and all I have--ay, had he been a beggar instead of a great lord\nfairer and stronger than any here, and having more wisdom and knowledge\nof strange things, I had given him all, how much more so being what he\nis!' And she took his hand and gazed proudly on him, and holding it,\nstood there boldly facing the people. And such was her sweetness and the\npower and dignity of her person, and so beautiful she looked standing\nhand in hand there at her lover's side, so sure of him and of herself,\nand so ready to risk all things and endure all things for him, that most\nof those who saw the sight, which I am sure no one of them will ever\nforget, caught the fire from her eyes and the happy colour from her\nblushing face, and cheered her like wild things. It was a bold stroke\nfor her to make, and it appealed to the imagination; but human nature\nin Zu-Vendis, as elsewhere, loves that which is bold and not afraid to\nbreak a rule, and is moreover peculiarly susceptible to appeals to its\npoetical side.\n\nAnd so the people cheered till the roof rang; but Sorais of the Night\nstood there with downcast eyes, for she could not bear to see her\nsister's triumph, which robbed her of the man whom she had hoped to win,\nand in the awfulness of her jealous anger she trembled and turned white\nlike an aspen in the wind. I think I have said somewhere of her that she\nreminded me of the sea on a calm day, having the same aspect of sleeping\npower about her. Well, it was all awake now, and like the face of the\nfurious ocean it awed and yet fascinated me. A really handsome woman\nin a royal rage is always a beautiful sight, but such beauty and such\na rage I never saw combined before, and I can only say that the effect\nproduced was well worthy of the two.\n\nShe lifted her white face, the teeth set, and there were purple rings\nbeneath her glowing eyes. Thrice she tried to speak and thrice she\nfailed, but at last her voice came. Raising her silver spear, she shook\nit, and the light gleamed from it and from the golden scales of her\ncuirass.\n\n'And thinkest thou, Nyleptha,' she said in notes which pealed through\nthe great hall like a clarion, 'thinkest thou that I, Sorais, a Queen\nof the Zu-Vendi, will brook that this base outlander shall sit upon my\nfather's throne and rear up half-breeds to fill the place of the great\nHouse of the Stairway? Never! never! while there is life in my bosom and\na man to follow me and a spear to strike with. Who is on my side? Who?\n\n'Now hand thou over this foreign wolf and those who came hither to prey\nwith him to the doom of fire, for have they not committed the deadly sin\nagainst the sun? or, Nyleptha, I give thee War--red War! Ay, I say to\nthee that the path of thy passion shall be marked out by the blazing of\nthy towns and watered with the blood of those who cleave to thee. On thy\nhead rest the burden of the deed, and in thy ears ring the groans of the\ndying and the cries of the widows and those who are left fatherless for\never and for ever.\n\n'I tell thee I will tear thee, Nyleptha, the White Queen, from thy\nthrone, and that thou shalt be hurled--ay, hurled even from the topmost\nstair of the great way to the foot thereof, in that thou hast covered\nthe name of the House of him who built it with black shame. And I tell\nye strangers--all save Bougwan, whom because thou didst do me a service\nI will save alive if thou wilt leave these men and follow me' (here\npoor Good shook his head vigorously and ejaculated 'Can't be done' in\nEnglish)--'that I will wrap you in sheets of gold and hang you yet alive\nin chains from the four golden trumpets of the four angels that fly east\nand west and north and south from the giddiest pinnacles of the Temple,\nso that ye may be a token and a warning to the land. And as for thee,\nIncubu, thou shalt die in yet another fashion that I will not tell thee\nnow.'\n\nShe ceased, panting for breath, for her passion shook her like a storm,\nand a murmur, partly of horror and partly of admiration, ran through the\nhall. Then Nyleptha answered calmly and with dignity:\n\n'Ill would it become my place and dignity, oh sister, so to speak as\nthou hast spoken and so to threat as thou hast threatened. Yet if thou\nwilt make war, then will I strive to bear up against thee, for if my\nhand seem soft, yet shalt thou find it of iron when it grips thine\narmies by the throat. Sorais, I fear thee not. I weep for that which\nthou wilt bring upon our people and on thyself, but for myself I say--I\nfear thee not. Yet thou, who but yesterday didst strive to win my lover\nand my lord from me, whom today thou dost call a \"foreign wolf\", to be\n_thy_ lover and _thy_ lord' (here there was an immense sensation in the\nhall), 'thou who but last night, as I have learnt but since thou didst\nenter here, didst creep like a snake into my sleeping-place--ay, even by\na secret way, and wouldst have foully murdered me, thy sister, as I lay\nasleep--'\n\n'It is false, it is false!' rang out Agon's and a score of other voices.\n\n'It is _not_ false,' said I, producing the broken point of the dagger\nand holding it up. 'Where is the haft from which this flew, oh Sorais?'\n\n'It is not false,' cried Good, determined at last to act like a loyal\nman. 'I took the Lady of the Night by the White Queen's bed, and on my\nbreast the dagger broke.'\n\n'Who is on my side?' cried Sorais, shaking her silver spear, for she\nsaw that public sympathy was turning against her. 'What, Bougwan, thou\ncomest not?' she said, addressing Good, who was standing close to her,\nin a low, concentrated voice. 'Thou pale-souled fool, for a reward thou\nshalt eat out thy heart with love of me and not be satisfied, and thou\nmightest have been my husband and a king! At least I hold _thee_ in\nchains that cannot be broken.\n\n'_War! War! War!_' she cried. 'Here, with my hand upon the sacred stone\nthat shall endure, so runs the prophecy, till the Zu-Vendi set their\nnecks beneath an alien yoke, I declare war to the end. Who follows\nSorais of the Night to victory and honour?'\n\nInstantly the whole concourse began to break up in indescribable\nconfusion. Many present hastened to throw in their lot with the 'Lady of\nthe Night', but some came from her following to us. Amongst the former\nwas an under officer of Nyleptha's own guard, who suddenly turned and\nmade a run for the doorway through which Sorais' people were already\npassing. Umslopogaas, who was present and had taken the whole scene in,\nseeing with admirable presence of mind that if this soldier got away\nothers would follow his example, seized the man, who drew his sword\nand struck at him. Thereon the Zulu sprang back with a wild shout, and,\navoiding the sword cuts, began to peck at his foe with his terrible axe,\ntill in a few seconds the man's fate overtook him and he fell with a\nclash heavily and quite dead upon the marble floor.\n\nThis was the first blood spilt in the war.\n\n'Shut the gates,' I shouted, thinking that we might perhaps catch Sorais\nso, and not being troubled with the idea of committing sacrilege. But\nthe order came too late, her guards were already passing through them,\nand in another minute the streets echoed with the furious galloping of\nhorses and the rolling of her chariots.\n\nSo, drawing half the people after her, Sorais was soon passing like a\nwhirlwind through the Frowning City on her road to her headquarters at\nM'Arstuna, a fortress situated a hundred and thirty miles to the north\nof Milosis.\n\nAnd after that the city was alive with the endless tramp of regiments\nand preparations for the gathering war, and old Umslopogaas once\nmore began to sit in the sunshine and go through a show of sharpening\nInkosi-kaas's razor edge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX A STRANGE WEDDING\n\n\n\nOne person, however, did not succeed in getting out in time before the\ngates were shut, and that was the High Priest Agon, who, as we had every\nreason to believe, was Sorais' great ally, and the heart and soul of her\nparty. This cunning and ferocious old man had not forgiven us for those\nhippopotami, or rather that was what he said. What he meant was that\nhe would never brook the introduction of our wider ways of thought and\nforeign learning and influence while there was a possibility of stamping\nus out. Also he knew that we possessed a different system of religion,\nand no doubt was in daily terror of our attempting to introduce it into\nZu-Vendis. One day he asked me if we had any religion in our country,\nand I told him that so far as I could remember we had ninety-five\ndifferent ones. You might have knocked him down with a feather, and\nreally it is difficult not to pity a high priest of a well-established\ncult who is haunted by the possible approach of one or all of\nninety-five new religions.\n\nWhen we knew that Agon was caught, Nyleptha, Sir Henry, and I discussed\nwhat was to be done with him. I was for closely incarcerating him,\nbut Nyleptha shook her head, saying that it would produce a disastrous\neffect throughout the country. 'Ah!' she added, with a stamp of her\nfoot, 'if I win and am once really Queen, I will break the power of\nthose priests, with their rites and revels and dark secret ways.' I only\nwished that old Agon could have heard her, it would have frightened him.\n\n'Well,' said Sir Henry, 'if we are not to imprison him, I suppose that\nwe may as well let him go. He is of no use here.'\n\nNyleptha looked at him in a curious sort of way, and said in a dry\nlittle voice, 'Thinkest thou so, my lord?'\n\n'Eh?' said Curtis. 'No, I do not see what is the use of keeping him.'\n\nShe said nothing, but continued looking at him in a way that was as shy\nas it was sweet.\n\nThen at last he understood.\n\n'Forgive me, Nyleptha,' he said, rather tremulously. 'Dost thou mean\nthat thou wilt marry me, even now?'\n\n'Nay, I know not; let my lord say,' was her rapid answer; 'but if my\nlord wills, the priest is there and the altar is there'--pointing to the\nentrance to a private chapel--'and am I not ready to do the will of my\nlord? Listen, oh my lord! In eight days or less thou must leave me and\ngo down to war, for thou shalt lead my armies, and in war--men sometimes\nfall, and so I would for a little space have had thee all my own, if\nonly for memory's sake;' and the tears overflowed her lovely eyes and\nrolled down her face like heavy drops of dew down the red heart of a\nrose.\n\n'Mayhap, too,' she went on, 'I shall lose my crown, and with my crown my\nlife and thine also. Sorais is very strong and very bitter, and if she\nprevails she will not spare. Who can read the future? Happiness is the\nworld's White Bird, that alights seldom, and flies fast and far till one\nday he is lost in the clouds. Therefore should we hold him fast if by\nany chance he rests for a little space upon our hand. It is not wise to\nneglect the present for the future, for who knows what the future will\nbe, Incubu? Let us pluck our flowers while the dew is on them, for when\nthe sun is up they wither and on the morrow will others bloom that we\nshall never see.' And she lifted her sweet face to him and smiled into\nhis eyes, and once more I felt a curious pang of jealousy and turned and\nwent away. They never took much notice of whether I was there or not,\nthinking, I suppose, that I was an old fool, and that it did not matter\none way or the other, and really I believe that they were right.\n\nSo I went back to our quarters and ruminated over things in general, and\nwatched old Umslopogaas whetting his axe outside the window as a vulture\nwhets his beak beside a dying ox.\n\nAnd in about an hour's time Sir Henry came tearing over, looking\nvery radiant and wildly excited, and found Good and myself and even\nUmslopogaas, and asked us if we should like to assist at a real wedding.\nOf course we said yes, and off we went to the chapel, where we found\nAgon looking as sulky as any High Priest possibly could, and no wonder.\nIt appeared that he and Nyleptha had a slight difference of opinion\nabout the coming ceremony. He had flatly refused to celebrate it, or to\nallow any of his priests to do so, whereupon Nyleptha became very angry\nand told him that she, as Queen, was head of the Church, and meant to\nbe obeyed. Indeed, she played the part of a Zu-Vendi Henry the Eighth to\nperfection, and insisted that, if she wanted to be married, she would be\nmarried, and that he should marry her. {Endnote 18}\n\nHe still refused to go through the ceremony, so she clinched her\nargument thus--\n\n'Well, I cannot execute a High Priest, because there is an absurd\nprejudice against it, and I cannot imprison him because all his\nsubordinates would raise a crying that would bring the stars down on\nZu-Vendis and crush it; but I _can_ leave him to contemplate the\naltar of the Sun without anything to eat, because that is his natural\nvocation, and if thou wilt not marry me, O Agon! thou shalt be placed\nbefore the altar yonder with nought but a little water till such time as\nthou hast reconsidered the matter.'\n\nNow, as it happened, Agon had been hurried away that morning without his\nbreakfast, and was already exceedingly hungry, so he presently modified\nhis views and consented to marry them, saying at the same time that he\nwashed his hands of all responsibility in the matter.\n\nSo it chanced that presently, attended only by two of her favourite\nmaidens, came the Queen Nyleptha, with happy blushing face and downcast\neyes, dressed in pure white, without embroidery of any sort, as seems\nto be the fashion on these occasions in most countries of the world. She\ndid not wear a single ornament, even her gold circlets were removed,\nand I thought that if possible she looked more lovely than ever without\nthem, as really superbly beautiful women do.\n\nShe came, curtseyed low to Sir Henry, and then took his hand and led him\nup before the altar, and after a little pause, in a slow, clear voice\nuttered the following words, which are customary in Zu-Vendis if the\nbride desires and the man consents:--\n\n'Thou dost swear by the Sun that thou wilt take no other woman to wife\nunless I lay my hand upon her and bid her come?'\n\n'I swear it,' answered Sir Henry; adding in English, 'One is quite\nenough for me.'\n\nThen Agon, who had been sulking in a corner near the altar, came forward\nand gabbled off something into his beard at such a rate that I could not\nfollow it, but it appeared to be an invocation to the Sun to bless\nthe union and make it fruitful. I observed that Nyleptha listened very\nclosely to every word, and afterwards discovered that she was afraid\nlest Agon should play her a trick, and by going through the invocations\nbackwards divorce them instead of marry them. At the end of the\ninvocations they were asked, as in our service, if they took each other\nfor husband and wife, and on their assenting they kissed each other\nbefore the altar, and the service was over, so far as their rites were\nconcerned. But it seemed to me that there was yet something wanting, and\nso I produced a Prayer-Book, which has, together with the 'Ingoldsby\nLegends', that I often read when I lie awake at night, accompanied me in\nall my later wanderings. I gave it to my poor boy Harry years ago, and\nafter his death I found it among his things and took it back again.\n\n'Curtis,' I said, 'I am not a clergyman, and I do not know if what I am\ngoing to propose is allowable--I know it is not legal--but if you and\nthe Queen have no objection I should like to read the English marriage\nservice over you. It is a solemn step which you are taking, and I think\nthat you ought, so far as circumstances will allow, to give it the\nsanction of your own religion.'\n\n'I have thought of that,' he said, 'and I wish you would. I do not feel\nhalf married yet.'\n\nNyleptha raised no objection, fully understanding that her husband\nwished to celebrate the marriage according to the rites prevailing in\nhis own country, and so I set to work and read the service, from 'Dearly\nbeloved' to 'amazement', as well as I could; and when I came to 'I,\nHenry, take thee, Nyleptha,' I translated, and also 'I, Nyleptha, take\nthee, Henry,' which she repeated after me very well. Then Sir Henry took\na plain gold ring from his little finger and placed it on hers, and so\non to the end. The ring had been Curtis' mother's wedding-ring, and I\ncould not help thinking how astonished the dear old Yorkshire lady would\nhave been if she could have foreseen that her wedding-ring was to serve\na similar purpose for Nyleptha, a Queen of the Zu-Vendi.\n\nAs for Agon, he was with difficulty kept calm while this second ceremony\nwas going on, for he at once understood that it was religious in its\nnature, and doubtless bethought him of the ninety-five new faiths which\nloomed so ominously in his eyes. Indeed, he at once set me down as a\nrival High Priest, and hated me accordingly. However, in the end off he\nwent, positively bristling with indignation, and I knew that we might\nlook out for danger from his direction.\n\nAnd off went Good and I, and old Umslopogaas also, leaving the happy\npair to themselves, and very low we all felt. Marriages are supposed\nto be cheerful things, but my experience is that they are very much the\nreverse to everybody, except perhaps the two people chiefly interested.\nThey mean the breaking-up of so many old ties as well as the undertaking\nof so many new ones, and there is always something sad about the passing\naway of the old order. Now to take this case for instance: Sir Henry\nCurtis is the best and kindest fellow and friend in the world, but he\nhas never been quite the same since that little scene in the chapel.\nIt is always Nyleptha this and Nyleptha that--Nyleptha, in short,\nfrom morning till night in one way or another, either expressed or\nunderstood. And as for the old friends--well, of course they have taken\nthe place that old friends ought to take, and which ladies are as a rule\nvery careful to see they do take when a man marries, and that is, the\nsecond place. Yes, he would be angry if anybody said so, but it is a\nfact for all that. He is not quite the same, and Nyleptha is very sweet\nand very charming, but I think that she likes him to understand that she\nhas married _him_, and not Quatermain, Good, and Co. But there! what is\nthe use of grumbling? It is all very right and proper, as any married\nlady would have no difficulty in explaining, and I am a selfish, jealous\nold man, though I hope I never show it.\n\nSo Good and I went and ate in silence and then indulged in an extra fine\nflagon of old Zu-Vendian to keep our spirits up, and presently one of\nour attendants came and told a story that gave us something to think\nabout.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be remembered that, after his quarrel with Umslopogaas,\nAlphonse had gone off in an exceedingly ill temper to sulk over his\nscratches. Well, it appears that he walked right past the Temple to the\nSun, down the wide road on the further side of the slope it crowns, and\nthence on into the beautiful park, or pleasure gardens, which are laid\nout just beyond the outer wall. After wandering about there for a little\nhe started to return, but was met near the outer gate by Sorais' train\nof chariots, which were galloping furiously along the great northern\nroad. When she caught sight of Alphonse, Sorais halted her train and\ncalled to him. On approaching he was instantly seized and dragged\ninto one of the chariots and carried off, 'crying out loudly', as our\ninformant said, and as from my general knowledge of him I can well\nbelieve.\n\nAt first I was much puzzled to know what object Sorais could have had in\ncarrying off the poor little Frenchman. She could hardly stoop so low\nas to try to wreak her fury on one whom she knew was only a servant. At\nlast, however, an idea occurred to me. We three were, as I think I have\nsaid, much revered by the people of Zu-Vendis at large, both because\nwe were the first strangers they had ever seen, and because we were\nsupposed to be the possessors of almost supernatural wisdom. Indeed,\nthough Sorais' cry against the 'foreign wolves'--or, to translate it\nmore accurately, 'foreign hyenas'--was sure to go down very well with\nthe nobles and the priests, it was not as we learnt, likely to be\nparticularly effectual amongst the bulk of the population. The Zu-Vendi\npeople, like the Athenians of old, are ever seeking for some new thing,\nand just because we were so new our presence was on the whole acceptable\nto them. Again, Sir Henry's magnificent personal appearance made a deep\nimpression upon a race who possess a greater love of beauty than any\nother I have ever been acquainted with. Beauty may be prized in other\ncountries, but in Zu-Vendis it is almost worshipped, as indeed\nthe national love of statuary shows. The people said openly in the\nmarket-places that there was not a man in the country to touch Curtis in\npersonal appearance, as with the exception of Sorais there was no woman\nwho could compete with Nyleptha, and that therefore it was meet that\nthey should marry; and that he had been sent by the Sun as a husband for\ntheir Queen. Now, from all this it will be seen that the outcry against\nus was to a considerable extent fictitious, and nobody knew it better\nthan Sorais herself. Consequently it struck me that it might have\noccurred to her that down in the country and among the country people,\nit would be better to place the reason of her conflict with her sister\nupon other and more general grounds than Nyleptha's marriage with the\nstranger. It would be easy in a land where there had been so many civil\nwars to rake out some old cry that would stir up the recollection of\nburied feuds, and, indeed, she soon found an effectual one. This being\nso, it was of great importance to her to have one of the strangers with\nher whom she could show to the common people as a great Outlander, who\nhad been so struck by the justice of her cause that he had elected to\nleave his companions and follow her standard.\n\nThis, no doubt, was the cause of her anxiety to get a hold of Good, whom\nshe would have used till he ceased to be of service and then cast off.\nBut Good having drawn back she grasped at the opportunity of securing\nAlphonse, who was not unlike him in personal appearance though smaller,\nno doubt with the object of showing him off in the cities and country as\nthe great Bougwan himself. I told Good that I thought that that was her\nplan, and his face was a sight to see--he was so horrified at the idea.\n\n'What,' he said, 'dress up that little wretch to represent me? Why, I\nshall have to get out of the country! My reputation will be ruined for\never.'\n\nI consoled him as well as I could, but it is not pleasant to be\npersonated all over a strange country by an arrant little coward, and I\ncan quite sympathize with his vexation.\n\nWell, that night Good and I messed as I have said in solitary grandeur,\nfeeling very much as though we had just returned from burying a friend\ninstead of marrying one, and next morning the work began in good\nearnest. The messages and orders which had been despatched by Nyleptha\ntwo days before now began to take effect, and multitudes of armed men\ncame pouring into the city. We saw, as may be imagined, but very little\nof Nyleptha and not too much of Curtis during those next few days,\nbut Good and I sat daily with the council of generals and loyal\nlords, drawing up plans of action, arranging commissariat matters, the\ndistribution of commands, and a hundred and one other things. Men came\nin freely, and all the day long the great roads leading to Milosis were\nspotted with the banners of lords arriving from their distant places to\nrally round Nyleptha.\n\nAfter the first few days it became clear that we should be able to\ntake the field with about forty thousand infantry and twenty thousand\ncavalry, a very respectable force considering how short was the time we\nhad to collect it, and that about half the regular army had elected to\nfollow Sorais.\n\nBut if our force was large, Sorais' was, according to the reports\nbrought in day by day by our spies, much larger. She had taken up her\nheadquarters at a very strong town called M'Arstuna, situated, as I have\nsaid, to the north of Milosis, and all the countryside was flocking to\nher standard. Nasta had poured down from his highlands and was on\nhis way to join her with no less than twenty-five thousand of his\nmountaineers, the most terrible soldiers to face in all Zu-Vendis.\nAnother mighty lord, named Belusha, who lived in the great\nhorse-breeding district, had come in with twelve thousand cavalry, and\nso on. Indeed, what between one thing and another, it seemed certain\nthat she would gather a fully armed host of nearly one hundred thousand\nmen.\n\nAnd then came news that Sorais was proposing to break up her camp and\nmarch on the Frowning City itself, desolating the country as she came.\nThereon arose the question whether it would be best to meet her at\nMilosis or to go out and give her battle. When our opinion was asked\nupon the subject, Good and I unhesitatingly gave it in favour of an\nadvance. If we were to shut ourselves up in the city and wait to be\nattacked, it seemed to us that our inaction would be set down to fear.\nIt is so important, especially on an occasion of this sort, when a very\nlittle will suffice to turn men's opinions one way or the other, to be\nup and doing something. Ardour for a cause will soon evaporate if the\ncause does not move but sits down to conquer. Therefore we cast our vote\nfor moving out and giving battle in the open, instead of waiting till we\nwere drawn from our walls like a badger from a hole.\n\nSir Henry's opinion coincided with ours, and so, needless to say, did\nthat of Nyleptha, who, like a flint, was always ready to flash out fire.\nA great map of the country was brought and spread out before her. About\nthirty miles this side of M'Arstuna, where Sorais lay, and ninety odd\nmiles from Milosis, the road ran over a neck of land some two and a half\nmiles in width, and flanked on either side by forest-clad hills\nwhich, without being lofty, would, if the road were blocked, be quite\nimpracticable for a great baggage-laden army to cross. She looked\nearnestly at the map, and then, with a quickness of perception that in\nsome women amounts almost to an instinct, she laid her finger upon this\nneck of rising ground, and turning to her husband, said, with a proud\nair of confidence and a toss of the golden head--\n\n'Here shalt thou meet Sorais' armies. I know the spot, here shalt thou\nmeet them, and drive them before thee like dust before the storm.'\n\nBut Curtis looked grave and said nothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX THE BATTLE OF THE PASS\n\n\n\nIt was on the third morning after this incident of the map that Sir\nHenry and I started. With the exception of a small guard, all the great\nhost had moved on the night before, leaving the Frowning City very\nsilent and empty. Indeed, it was found impossible to leave any garrison\nwith the exception of a personal guard for Nyleptha, and about a\nthousand men who from sickness or one cause or another were unable to\nproceed with the army; but as Milosis was practically impregnable, and\nas our enemy was in front of and not behind us, this did not so much\nmatter.\n\nGood and Umslopogaas had gone on with the army, but Nyleptha accompanied\nSir Henry and myself to the city gates, riding a magnificent white horse\ncalled Daylight, which was supposed to be the fleetest and most enduring\nanimal in Zu-Vendis. Her face bore traces of recent weeping, but there\nwere no tears in her eyes now, indeed she was bearing up bravely against\nwhat must have been a bitter trial to her. At the gate she reined in\nher horse and bade us farewell. On the previous day she had reviewed and\naddressed the officers of the great army, speaking to them such high,\neloquent words, and expressing so complete a confidence in their valour\nand in their ultimate victory, that she quite carried their hearts\naway, and as she rode from rank to rank they cheered her till the ground\nshook. And now today the same mood seemed to be on her.\n\n'Fare thee well, Macumazahn!' she said. 'Remember, I trust to thy wits,\nwhich are as a needle to a spear-handle compared to those of my people,\nto save us from Sorais. I know that thou wilt do thy duty.'\n\nI bowed and explained to her my horror of fighting, and my fear lest I\nshould lose my head, at which she laughed gently and turned to Curtis.\n\n'Fare thee well, my lord!' she said. 'Come back with victory, and as a\nking, or on thy soldiers' spears.' {Endnote 19}\n\nSir Henry said nothing, but turned his horse to go; perhaps he had a bit\nof a lump in his throat. One gets over it afterwards, but these sort of\npartings are trying when one has only been married a week.\n\n'Here,' added Nyleptha, 'will I greet thee when ye return in triumph.\nAnd now, my lords, once more, farewell!'\n\nThen we rode on, but when we had gone a hundred and fifty yards or so,\nwe turned and perceived her still sitting on her horse at the same spot,\nand looking out after us beneath her hand, and that was the last we saw\nof her. About a mile farther on, however, we heard galloping behind\nus, and looking round, saw a mounted soldier coming towards us, leading\nNyleptha's matchless steed--Daylight.\n\n'The Queen sends the white stallion as a farewell gift to her Lord\nIncubu, and bids me tell my lord that he is the fleetest and most\nenduring horse in all the land,' said the soldier, bending to his\nsaddle-bow before us.\n\nAt first Sir Henry did not want to take the horse, saying that he was\ntoo good for such rough work, but I persuaded him to do so, thinking\nthat Nyleptha would be hurt if he did not. Little did I guess at the\ntime what service that noble horse would render in our sorest need. It\nis curious to look back and realize upon what trivial and apparently\ncoincidental circumstances great events frequently turn as easily and\nnaturally as a door on its hinges.\n\nWell, we took the horse, and a beauty he was, it was a perfect pleasure\nto see him move, and Curtis having sent back his greetings and thanks,\nwe proceeded on our journey.\n\nBy midday we overtook the rear-guard of the great army of which\nSir Henry then formally took over the command. It was a heavy\nresponsibility, and it oppressed him very much, but the Queen's\ninjunctions on the point were such as did not admit of being\ntrifled with. He was beginning to find out that greatness has its\nresponsibilities as well as its glories.\n\nThen we marched on without meeting with any opposition, almost indeed\nwithout seeing anybody, for the populations of the towns and villages\nalong our route had for the most part fled, fearing lest they should\nbe caught between the two rival armies and ground to powder like grain\nbetween the upper and the nether stones.\n\nOn the evening of the fourth day, for the progress of so great a\nmultitude was necessarily slow, we camped two miles this side of the\nneck or ridge I have spoken of, and our outposts brought us word that\nSorais with all her power was rolling down upon us, and had pitched her\ncamp that night ten miles the farther side of the neck.\n\nAccordingly before dawn we sent forward fifteen hundred cavalry to seize\nthe position. Scarcely had they occupied it, however, before they were\nattacked by about as many of Sorais' horsemen, and a very smart little\ncavalry fight ensued, with a loss to us of about thirty men killed. On\nthe advance of our supports, however, Sorais' force drew off, carrying\ntheir dead and wounded with them.\n\nThe main body of the army reached the neck about dinner-time, and I must\nsay that Nyleptha's judgment had not failed her, it was an admirable\nplace to give battle in, especially to a superior force.\n\nThe road ran down a mile or more, through ground too broken to admit of\nthe handling of any considerable force, till it reached the crest of a\ngreat green wave of land, that rolled down a gentle slope to the banks\nof a little stream, and then rolled away again up a still gentler slope\nto the plain beyond, the distance from the crest of the land-wave down\nto the stream being a little over half a mile, and from the stream up to\nthe plain beyond a trifle less. The length of this wave of land at its\nhighest point, which corresponded exactly with the width of the neck of\nthe land between the wooded hills, was about two miles and a quarter,\nand it was protected on either side by dense, rocky, bush-clad ground,\nthat afforded a most valuable cover to the flanks of the army and\nrendered it almost impossible for them to be turned.\n\nIt was on the hither slope of this neck of land that Curtis encamped\nhis army in the same formation that he had, after consultation with the\nvarious generals, Good, and myself, determined that they should occupy\nin the great pitched battle which now appeared to be imminent.\n\nOur force of sixty thousand men was, roughly speaking, divided\nas follows. In the centre was a dense body of twenty thousand\nfoot-soldiers, armed with spears, swords, and hippopotamus-hide shields,\nbreast and back plates. {Endnote 20} These formed the chest of the army,\nand were supported by five thousand foot, and three thousand horse in\nreserve. On either side of this chest were stationed seven thousand\nhorse arranged in deep, majestic squadrons; and beyond and on either\nside but slightly in front of them again were two bodies, each numbering\nabout seven thousand five hundred spearmen, forming the right and left\nwings of the army, and each supported by a contingent of some fifteen\nhundred cavalry. This makes in all sixty thousand men.\n\nCurtis commanded in chief, I was in command of the seven thousand horse\nbetween the chest and right wing, which was commanded by Good, and the\nother battalions and squadrons were entrusted to Zu-Vendis generals.\n\nScarcely had we taken up our positions before Sorais' vast army began to\nswarm on the opposite slope about a mile in front of us, till the whole\nplace seemed alive with the multitude of her spearpoints, and the ground\nshook with the tramp of her battalions. It was evident that the spies\nhad not exaggerated; we were outnumbered by at least a third. At first\nwe expected that Sorais was going to attack us at once, as the clouds\nof cavalry which hung upon her flanks executed some threatening\ndemonstrations, but she thought better of it, and there was no fight\nthat day. As for the formation of her great forces I cannot now describe\nit with accuracy, and it would only serve to bewilder if I did, but I\nmay say, generally, that in its leading features it resembled our own,\nonly her reserve was much greater.\n\nOpposite our right wing, and forming Sorais' left wing, was a great army\nof dark, wild-looking men, armed with sword and shield only, which,\nI was informed, was composed of Nasta's twenty-five thousand savage\nhillsmen.\n\n'My word, Good,' said I, when I saw them, 'you will catch it tomorrow\nwhen those gentlemen charge!' whereat Good not unnaturally looked rather\nanxious.\n\nAll day we watched and waited, but nothing happened, and at last night\nfell, and a thousand watch-fires twinkled brightly on the slopes, to\nwane and die one by one like the stars they resembled. As the hours wore\non, the silence gradually gathered more deeply over the opposing hosts.\n\nIt was a very wearying night, for in addition to the endless things that\nhad to be attended to, there was our gnawing suspense to reckon\nwith. The fray which tomorrow would witness would be so vast, and the\nslaughter so awful, that stout indeed must the heart have been that was\nnot overwhelmed at the prospect. And when I thought of all that hung\nupon it, I own I felt ill, and it made me very sad to reflect that\nthese mighty forces were gathered for destruction, simply to gratify the\njealous anger of a woman. This was the hidden power which was to send\nthose dense masses of cavalry, flashing like human thunderbolts across\nthe plain, and to roll together the fierce battalions as clouds when\nhurricane meets hurricane. It was a dreadful thought, and set one\nwondering about the responsibilities of the great ones of the earth.\nDeep into the night we sat, with pale faces and heavy hearts, and took\ncounsel, whilst the sentries tramped up and down, down and up, and the\narmed and plumed generals came and went, grim and shadow-like.\n\nAnd so the time wore away, till everything was ready for the coming\nslaughter; and I lay down and thought, and tried to get a little rest,\nbut could not sleep for fear of the morrow--for who could say what the\nmorrow would bring forth? Misery and death, this was certain; beyond\nthat we knew not, and I confess I was very much afraid. But as I\nrealized then, it is useless to question that eternal Sphinx, the\nfuture. From day to day she reads aloud the riddles of the yesterday, of\nwhich the puzzled wordlings of all ages have not answered one, nor ever\nwill, guess they never so wildly or cry they never so loud.\n\nAnd so at length I gave up wondering, being forced humbly to leave the\nissue in the balancing hands of Providence and the morrow.\n\nAnd at last up came the red sun, and the huge camps awoke with a clash,\nand a roar, and gathered themselves together for battle. It was a\nbeautiful and awe-inspiring scene, and old Umslopogaas, leaning on his\naxe, contemplated it with grim delight.\n\n'Never have I seen the like, Macumazahn, never,' he said. 'The battles\nof my people are as the play of children to what this will be. Thinkest\nthou that they will fight it out?'\n\n'Ay,' I answered sadly, 'to the death. Content thyself, \"Woodpecker\",\nfor once shalt thou peck thy fill.'\n\nTime went on, and still there was no sign of an attack. A force of\ncavalry crossed the brook, indeed, and rode slowly along our front,\nevidently taking stock of our position and numbers. With this we did\nnot attempt to interfere, as our decision was to stand strictly on the\ndefensive, and not to waste a single man. The men breakfasted and stood\nto their arms, and the hours wore on. About midday, when the men were\neating their dinner, for we thought they would fight better on full\nstomachs, a shout of '_Sorais, Sorais_' arose like thunder from the\nenemy's extreme right, and taking the glass, I was able to clearly\ndistinguish the 'Lady of the Night' herself, surrounded by a glittering\nstaff, and riding slowly down the lines of her battalions. And as she\nwent, that mighty, thundering shout rolled along before her like the\nrolling of ten thousand chariots, or the roaring of the ocean when the\ngale turns suddenly and carries the noise of it to the listener's ears,\ntill the earth shook, and the air was full of the majesty of sound.\n\nGuessing that this was a prelude to the beginning of the battle, we\nremained still and made ready.\n\nWe had not long to wait. Suddenly, like flame from a cannon's mouth, out\nshot two great tongue-like forces of cavalry, and came charging down the\nslope towards the little stream, slowly at first, but gathering speed\nas they came. Before they got to the stream, orders reached me from Sir\nHenry, who evidently feared that the shock of such a charge, if allowed\nto fall unbroken upon our infantry, would be too much for them, to send\nfive thousand sabres to meet the force opposite to me, at the moment\nwhen it began to mount the stiffest of the rise about four hundred yards\nfrom our lines. This I did, remaining behind myself with the rest of my\nmen.\n\nOff went the five thousand horsemen, drawn up in a wedge-like form, and\nI must say that the general in command handled them very ably. Starting\nat a hand gallop, for the first three hundred yards he rode straight at\nthe tip of the tongue-shaped mass of cavalry which, numbering, so far as\nI could judge, about eight thousand sabres, was advancing to charge us.\nThen he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace, and I saw the\ngreat wedge curl round, and before the foe could check himself and turn\nto meet it, strike him about halfway down his length, with a crashing\nrending sound, like that of the breaking-up of vast sheets of ice. In\nsank the great wedge, into his heart, and as it cut its way hundreds\nof horsemen were thrown up on either side of it, just as the earth is\nthrown up by a ploughshare, or more like still, as the foaming water\ncurls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship. In, yet in, vainly does\nthe tongue twist its ends round in agony, like an injured snake,\nand strive to protect its centre; still farther in, by Heaven! right\nthrough, and so, amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands,\nback again upon the severed ends, beating them down, driving them as\na gale drives spray, till at last, amidst the rushing of hundreds of\nriderless horses, the flashing of swords, and the victorious clamour of\ntheir pursuers, the great force crumples up like an empty glove, then\nturns and gallops pell-mell for safety back to its own lines.\n\nI do not think it reached them more than two-thirds as strong as it\nwent out ten minutes before. The lines which were now advancing to the\nattack, opened and swallowed them up, and my force returned, having\nonly suffered a loss of about five hundred men--not much, I thought,\nconsidering the fierceness of the struggle. I could also see that the\nopposing bodies of cavalry on our left wing were drawing back, but how\nthe fight went with them I do not quite know. It is as much as I can do\nto describe what took place immediately around me.\n\nBy this time the dense masses of the enemy's left, composed almost\nentirely of Nasta's swordsmen, were across the little stream, and\nwith alternate yells of 'Nasta' and 'Sorais', with dancing banners and\ngleaming swords, were swarming up towards us like ants.\n\nAgain I received orders to try and check this movement, and also the\nmain advance against the chest of our army, by means of cavalry charges,\nand this I did to the best of my ability, by continually sending\nsquadrons of about a thousand sabres out against them. These squadrons\ndid the enemy much damage, and it was a glorious sight to see them flash\ndown the hillside, and bury themselves like a living knife in the heart\nof the foe. But, also, we lost many men, for after the experience of a\ncouple of these charges, which had drawn a sort of bloody St Andrew's\ncross of dead and dying through the centre of Nasta's host, our foes\nno longer attempted to offer an unyielding front to their irresistible\nweight, but opened out to let the rush go through, throwing themselves\non the ground and hamstringing hundreds of horses as they passed.\n\nAnd so, notwithstanding all that we could do, the enemy drew nearer,\ntill at last he hurled himself upon Good's force of seven thousand five\nhundred regulars, who were drawn up to receive them in three strong\nsquares. About the same time, too, an awful and heartshaking roar told\nme that the main battle had closed in on the centre and extreme left. I\nraised myself in my stirrups and looked down to my left; so far as the\neye could see there was a long dazzling shimmer of steel as the sun\nglanced upon falling sword and thrusting spear.\n\nTo and fro swung the contending lines in that dread struggle, now giving\nway, now gaining a little in the mad yet ordered confusion of attack\nand defence. But it was as much as I could do to keep count of what was\nhappening to our own wing; and, as for the moment the cavalry had fallen\nback under cover of Good's three squares, I had a fair view of this.\n\nNasta's wild swordsmen were now breaking in red waves against the sullen\nrock-like squares. Time after time did they yell out their war-cries,\nand hurl themselves furiously against the long triple ridges of spear\npoints, only to be rolled back as billows are when they meet the cliff.\n\nAnd so for four long hours the battle raged almost without a pause, and\nat the end of that time, if we had gained nothing we had lost nothing.\nTwo attempts to turn our left flank by forcing a way through the wood by\nwhich it was protected had been defeated; and as yet Nasta's swordsmen\nhad, notwithstanding their desperate efforts, entirely failed to break\nGood's three squares, though they had thinned their numbers by quite a\nthird.\n\nAs for the chest of the army where Sir Henry was with his staff and\nUmslopogaas, it had suffered dreadfully, but it had held its own with\nhonour, and the same may be said of our left battle.\n\nAt last the attacks slackened, and Sorais' army drew back, having, I\nbegan to think, had enough of it. On this point, however, I was soon\nundeceived, for splitting up her cavalry into comparatively small\nsquadrons, she charged us furiously with them, all along the line,\nand then once more sullenly rolled her tens of thousands of sword and\nspearmen down upon our weakened squares and squadrons; Sorais herself\ndirecting the movement, as fearless as a lioness heading the main\nattack. On they came like an avalanche--I saw her golden helm gleaming\nin the van--our counter charges of cavalry entirely failing to check\ntheir forward sweep. Now they had struck us, and our centre bent in like\na bow beneath the weight of their rush--it parted, and had not the ten\nthousand men in reserve charged down to its support it must have\nbeen utterly destroyed. As for Good's three squares, they were swept\nbackwards like boats upon an incoming tide, and the foremost one was\nburst into and lost half its remaining men. But the effort was too\nfierce and terrible to last. Suddenly the battle came, as it were, to a\nturning-point, and for a minute or two stood still.\n\nThen it began to move towards Sorais' camp. Just then, too, Nasta's\nfierce and almost invincible highlanders, either because they were\ndisheartened by their losses or by way of a ruse, fell back, and the\nremains of Good's gallant squares, leaving the positions they had held\nfor so many hours, cheered wildly, and rashly followed them down the\nslope, whereon the swarms of swordsmen turned to envelop them, and once\nmore flung themselves upon them with a yell. Taken thus on every side,\nwhat remained of the first square was quickly destroyed, and I perceived\nthat the second, in which I could see Good himself mounted on a large\nhorse, was on the point of annihilation. A few more minutes and it was\nbroken, its streaming colours sank, and I lost sight of Good in the\nconfused and hideous slaughter that ensued.\n\nPresently, however, a cream-coloured horse with a snow-white mane\nand tail burst from the ruins of the square and came rushing past me\nriderless and with wide streaming reins, and in it I recognized the\ncharger that Good had been riding. Then I hesitated no longer, but\ntaking with me half my effective cavalry force, which now amounted to\nbetween four and five thousand men, I commended myself to God, and,\nwithout waiting for orders, I charged straight down upon Nasta's\nswordsmen. Seeing me coming, and being warned by the thunder of my\nhorses' hoofs, the majority of them faced round, and gave us a right\nwarm welcome. Not an inch would they yield; in vain did we hack and\ntrample them down as we ploughed a broad red furrow through their\nthousands; they seemed to re-arise by hundreds, driving their terrible\nsharp swords into our horses, or severing their hamstrings, and then\nhacking the troopers who came to the ground with them almost into\npieces. My horse was speedily killed under me, but luckily I had a fresh\none, my own favourite, a coal-black mare Nyleptha had given me, being\nheld in reserve behind, and on this I afterwards mounted. Meanwhile I\nhad to get along as best I could, for I was pretty well lost sight of\nby my men in the mad confusion of the moment. My voice, of course, could\nnot be heard in the midst of the clanging of steel and the shrieks of\nrage and agony. Presently I found myself mixed up with the remnants of\nthe square, which had formed round its leader Good, and was fighting\ndesperately for existence. I stumbled against somebody, and glancing\ndown, caught sight of Good's eyeglass. He had been beaten to his knee.\nOver him was a great fellow swinging a heavy sword. Somehow I managed to\nrun the man through with the sime I had taken from the Masai whose hand\nI had cut off; but as I did so, he dealt me a frightful blow on the left\nside and breast with the sword, and though my chain shirt saved my life,\nI felt that I was badly hurt. For a minute I fell on to my hands and\nknees among the dead and dying, and turned sick and faint. When I\ncame to again I saw that Nasta's spearmen, or rather those of them who\nremained, were retreating back across the stream, and that Good was\nthere by me smiling sweetly.\n\n'Near go that,' he shouted; 'but all's well that ends well.'\n\nI assented, but I could not help feeling that it had not ended well for\nme. I was sorely hurt.\n\nJust then we saw the smaller bodies of cavalry stationed on our extreme\nright and left, and which were now reinforced by the three thousand\nsabres which we had held in reserve, flash out like arrows from their\nposts and fall upon the disordered flanks of Sorais' forces, and that\ncharge decided the issue of the battle. In another minute or two the\nenemy was in slow and sullen retreat across the little stream, where\nthey once more re-formed. Then came another lull, during which I managed\nto get a second horse, and received my orders to advance from Sir Henry,\nand then with one fierce deep-throated roar, with a waving of banners\nand a wide flashing of steel, the remains of our army took the offensive\nand began to sweep down, slowly indeed, but irresistibly from the\npositions they had so gallantly held all day.\n\nAt last it was our turn to attack.\n\nOn we moved, over the piled-up masses of dead and dying, and were\napproaching the stream, when suddenly I perceived an extraordinary\nsight. Galloping wildly towards us, his arms tightly clasped around his\nhorse's neck, against which his blanched cheek was tightly pressed, was\na man arrayed in the full costume of a Zu-Vendi general, but in whom, as\nhe came nearer, I recognized none other than our lost Alphonse. It was\nimpossible even then to mistake those curling mustachios. In a minute he\nwas tearing through our ranks and narrowly escaped being cut down, till\nat last somebody caught his horse's bridle, and he was brought to me\njust as a momentary halt occurred in our advance to allow what remained\nof our shattered squares to form into line.\n\n'Ah, monsieur,' he gasped out in a voice that was nearly inarticulate\nwith fright, 'grace to the sky, it is you! Ah, what I have endured!\nBut you win, monsieur, you win; they fly, the laches. But listen,\nmonsieur--I forget, it is no good; the Queen is to be murdered tomorrow\nat the first light in the palace of Milosis; her guards will leave\ntheir posts, and the priests are going to kill her. Ah yes! they little\nthought it, but I was ensconced beneath a banner, and I heard it all.'\n\n'What?' I said, horror-struck; 'what do you mean?'\n\n'What I say, monsieur; that devil of a Nasta he went last night to\nsettle the affair with the Archbishop [Agon]. The guard will leave open\nthe little gate leading from the great stair and go away, and Nasta and\nAgon's priests will come in and kill her. Themselves they would not kill\nher.'\n\n'Come with me,' I said, and, shouting to the staff-officer next to me to\ntake over the command, I snatched his bridle and galloped as hard as I\ncould for the spot, between a quarter and half a mile off, where I saw\nthe royal pennon flying, and where I knew that I should find Curtis if\nhe were still alive. On we tore, our horses clearing heaps of dead and\ndying men, and splashing through pools of blood, on past the long broken\nlines of spearmen to where, mounted on the white stallion Nyleptha had\nsent to him as a parting gift, I saw Sir Henry's form towering above the\ngenerals who surrounded him.\n\nJust as we reached him the advance began again. A bloody cloth was bound\naround his head, but I saw that his eye was as bright and keen as ever.\nBeside him was old Umslopogaas, his axe red with blood, but looking\nquite fresh and uninjured.\n\n'What's wrong, Quatermain?' he shouted.\n\n'Everything. There is a plot to murder the Queen tomorrow at dawn.\nAlphonse here, who has just escaped from Sorais, has overheard it all,'\nand I rapidly repeated to him what the Frenchman had told me.\n\nCurtis' face turned deadly pale and his jaw dropped.\n\n'At dawn,' he gasped, 'and it is now sunset; it dawns before four and we\nare nearly a hundred miles off--nine hours at the outside. What is to be\ndone?'\n\nAn idea entered into my head. 'Is that horse of yours fresh?' I said.\n\n'Yes, I have only just got on to him--when my last was killed, and he\nhas been fed.'\n\n'So is mine. Get off him, and let Umslopogaas mount; he can ride well.\nWe will be at Milosis before dawn, or if we are not--well, we cannot\nhelp it. No, no; it is impossible for you to leave now. You would be\nseen, and it would turn the fate of the battle. It is not half won yet.\nThe soldiers would think you were making a bolt of it. Quick now.'\n\nIn a moment he was down, and at my bidding Umslopogaas sprang into the\nempty saddle.\n\n'Now farewell,' I said. 'Send a thousand horsemen with remounts after\nus in an hour if possible. Stay, despatch a general to the left wing to\ntake over the command and explain my absence.'\n\n'You will do your best to save her, Quatermain?' he said in a broken\nvoice.\n\n'Ay, that I will. Go on; you are being left behind.'\n\nHe cast one glance at us, and accompanied by his staff galloped off to\njoin the advance, which by this time was fording the little brook that\nnow ran red with the blood of the fallen.\n\nAs for Umslopogaas and myself, we left that dreadful field as arrows\nleave a bow, and in a few minutes had passed right out of the sight of\nslaughter, the smell of blood, and the turmoil and shouting, which only\ncame to our ears as a faint, far-off roaring like the sound of distant\nbreakers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI AWAY! AWAY!\n\n\n\nAt the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses;\nand, turning, glanced at the battle beneath us, which, illumined as it\nwas by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red,\nlooked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an\nactual hand-to-hand combat. The distinguishing scenic effect from that\ndistance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the\nswords and spears, otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have\nbeen expected. The great green lap of sward in which the struggle was\nbeing fought out, the bold round outline of the hills behind, and\nthe wide sweep of the plain beyond, seemed to dwarf it; and what was\ntremendous enough when one was in it, grew insignificant when viewed\nfrom the distance. But is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of\nour race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and\nworry? How utterly antlike, and morally and physically insignificant,\nmust they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths\nabove!\n\n'We win the day, Macumazahn,' said old Umslopogaas, taking in the whole\nsituation with a glance of his practised eye. 'Look, the Lady of the\nNight's forces give on every side, there is no stiffness left in them,\nthey bend like hot iron, they are fighting with but half a heart. But\nalas! the battle will in a manner be drawn, for the darkness gathers,\nand the regiments will not be able to follow and slay!'--and he shook\nhis head sadly. 'But,' he added, 'I do not think that they will fight\nagain. We have fed them with too strong a meat. Ah! it is well to have\nlived! At last I have seen a fight worth seeing.'\n\nBy this time we were on our way again, and as we went side by side I\ntold him what our mission was, and how that, if it failed, all the lives\nthat had been lost that day would have been lost in vain.\n\n'Ah!' he said, 'nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these, and to\nbe there before the dawn! Well--away! away! man can but try, Macumazahn;\nand mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old \"witch-finder's\"\n[Agon's] skull for him. Once he wanted to burn us, the old \"rain-maker\",\ndid he? And now he would set a snare for my mother [Nyleptha], would he?\nGood! So sure as my name is the name of the Woodpecker, so surely, be\nmy mother alive or dead, will I split him to the beard. Ay, by T'Chaka's\nhead I swear it!' and he shook Inkosi-kaas as he galloped. By now the\ndarkness was closing in, but fortunately there would be a moon later,\nand the road was good.\n\nOn we sped through the twilight, the two splendid horses we bestrode\nhad got their wind by this, and were sweeping along with a wide steady\nstride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile. Down the side\nof slopes we galloped, across wide vales that stretched to the foot\nof far-off hills. Nearer and nearer grew the blue hills; now we were\ntravelling up their steeps, and now we were over and passing towards\nothers that sprang up like visions in the far, faint distance beyond.\n\nOn, never pausing or drawing rein, through the perfect quiet of the\nnight, that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses'\nhoofs; on, past deserted villages, where only some forgotten starving\ndog howled a melancholy welcome; on, past lonely moated dwellings; on,\nthrough the white patchy moonlight, that lay coldly upon the wide bosom\nof the earth, as though there was no warmth in it; on, knee to knee, for\nhour after hour!\n\nWe spake not, but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious\nhorses, and listened to their deep, long-drawn breaths as they filled\ntheir great lungs, and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round\nhoofs. Grim and black indeed did old Umslopogaas look beside me, mounted\nupon the great white horse, like Death in the Revelation of St John, as\nnow and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road,\nand pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house.\n\nAnd so on, still on, without break or pause for hour after hour.\n\nAt last I felt that even the splendid animal that I rode was beginning\nto give out. I looked at my watch; it was nearly midnight, and we were\nconsiderably more than half way. On the top of a rise was a little\nspring, which I remembered because I had slept by it a few nights\nbefore, and here I motioned to Umslopogaas to pull up, having determined\nto give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in. He did so,\nand we dismounted--that is to say, Umslopogaas did, and then helped me\noff, for what with fatigue, stiffness, and the pain of my wound, I could\nnot do so for myself; and then the gallant horses stood panting there,\nresting first one leg and then another, while the sweat fell drip, drip,\nfrom them, and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night\nair.\n\nLeaving Umslopogaas to hold the horses, I hobbled to the spring and\ndrank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful\nof wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up,\nthough my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry. Then, having\nlaved my fevered head and hands, I returned, and the Zulu went and\ndrank. Next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls each--no\nmore; and oh, what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from\nthe water! There were yet two minutes, and I employed it in hobbling\nup and down to try and relieve my stiffness, and in inspecting the\ncondition of the horses. My mare, gallant animal though she was, was\nevidently much distressed; she hung her head, and her eye looked sick\nand dull; but Daylight, Nyleptha's glorious horse--who, if he is served\naright, should, like the steeds who saved great Rameses in his need,\nfeed for the rest of his days out of a golden manger--was still\ncomparatively speaking fresh, notwithstanding the fact that he had had\nby far the heavier weight to carry. He was 'tucked up', indeed, and\nhis legs were weary, but his eye was bright and clear, and he held his\nshapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that\nseemed to say that whoever failed _he_ was good for those five-and-forty\nmiles that yet lay between us and Milosis. Then Umslopogaas helped me\ninto the saddle and--vigorous old savage that he was!--vaulted into his\nown without touching a stirrup, and we were off once more, slowly at\nfirst, till the horses got into their stride, and then more swiftly. So\nwe passed over another ten miles, and then came a long, weary rise of\nsome six or seven miles, and three times did my poor black mare nearly\ncome to the ground with me. But on the top she seemed to gather herself\ntogether, and rattled down the slope with long, convulsive strides,\nbreathing in gasps. We did that three or four miles more swiftly than\nany since we had started on our wild ride, but I felt it to be a last\neffort, and I was right. Suddenly my poor horse took the bit between\nher teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some\nthree or four hundred yards, and then, with two or three jerky strides,\npulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head, I rolling\nmyself free as she did so. As I struggled to my feet the brave beast\nraised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes, and then\nher head dropped with a groan and she was dead. Her heart was broken.\n\nUmslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase, and I looked at him in dismay.\nThere were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn, and how were we\nto do it with one horse? It seemed hopeless, but I had forgotten the old\nZulu's extraordinary running powers.\n\nWithout a single word he sprang from the saddle and began to hoist me\ninto it.\n\n'What wilt thou do?' I asked.\n\n'Run,' he answered, seizing my stirrup-leather.\n\nThen off we went again, almost as fast as before; and oh, the relief\nit was to me to get that change of horses! Anybody who has ever ridden\nagainst time will know what it meant.\n\nDaylight sped along at a long stretching hand-gallop, giving the\ngaunt Zulu a lift at every stride. It was a wonderful thing to see\nold Umslopogaas run mile after mile, his lips slightly parted and his\nnostrils agape like the horse's. Every five miles or so we stopped for a\nfew minutes to let him get his breath, and then flew on again.\n\n'Canst thou go farther,' I said at the third of these stoppages, 'or\nshall I leave thee to follow me?'\n\nHe pointed with his axe to a dim mass before us. It was the Temple of\nthe Sun, now not more than five miles away.\n\n'I reach it or I die,' he gasped.\n\nOh, that last five miles! The skin was rubbed from the inside of my\nlegs, and every movement of my horse gave me anguish. Nor was that all.\nI was exhausted with toil, want of food and sleep, and also suffering\nvery much from the blow I had received on my left side; it seemed as\nthough a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung.\nPoor Daylight, too, was pretty nearly finished, and no wonder. But there\nwas a smell of dawn in the air, and we might not stay; better that all\nthree of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while\nthere was life in us. The air was thick and heavy, as it sometimes is\nbefore the dawn breaks, and--another infallible sign in certain parts of\nZu-Vendis that sunrise is at hand--hundreds of little spiders pendant on\nthe end of long tough webs were floating about in it. These early-rising\ncreatures, or rather their webs, caught upon the horse's and our own\nforms by scores, and, as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush\nthem off, we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads\nthat streamed out a yard or more behind us--and a very strange\nappearance they must have given us.\n\nAnd now before us are the huge brazen gates of the outer wall of the\nFrowning City, and a new and horrible doubt strikes me: What if they\nwill not let us in?\n\n'_Open! open!_' I shout imperiously, at the same time giving the royal\npassword. '_Open! open!_ a messenger, a messenger with tidings of the\nwar!'\n\n'What news?' cried the guard. 'And who art thou that ridest so madly,\nand who is that whose tongue lolls out'--and it actually did--'and who\nruns by thee like a dog by a chariot?'\n\n'It is the Lord Macumazahn, and with him is his dog, his black dog.\n_Open! open!_ I bring tidings.'\n\nThe great gates ran back on their rollers, and the drawbridge fell with\na rattling crash, and we dashed on through the one and over the other.\n\n'What news, my lord, what news?' cried the guard.\n\n'Incubu rolls Sorais back, as the wind a cloud,' I answered, and was\ngone.\n\nOne more effort, gallant horse, and yet more gallant man!\n\nSo, fall not now, Daylight, and hold thy life in thee for fifteen short\nminutes more, old Zulu war-dog, and ye shall both live for ever in the\nannals of the land.\n\nOn, clattering through the sleeping streets. We are passing the Flower\nTemple now--one mile more, only one little mile--hold on, keep your\nlife in thee, see the houses run past of themselves. Up, good horse,\nup, there--but fifty yards now. Ah! you see your stables and stagger on\ngallantly.\n\n'Thank God, the palace at last!' and see, the first arrows of the dawn\nare striking on the Temple's golden dome. {Endnote 21} But shall I get\nin here, or is the deed done and the way barred?\n\nOnce more I give the password and shout '_Open! open!_'\n\nNo answer, and my heart grows very faint.\n\nAgain I call, and this time a single voice replies, and to my joy\nI recognize it as belonging to Kara, a fellow-officer of Nyleptha's\nguards, a man I know to be as honest as the light--indeed, the same whom\nNyleptha had sent to arrest Sorais on the day she fled to the temple.\n\n'Is it thou, Kara?' I cry; 'I am Macumazahn. Bid the guard let down the\nbridge and throw wide the gate. Quick, quick!'\n\nThen followed a space that seemed to me endless, but at length the\nbridge fell and one half of the gate opened and we got into the\ncourtyard, where at last poor Daylight fell down beneath me, as I\nthought, dead. Except Kara, there was nobody to be seen, and his look\nwas wild, and his garments were all torn. He had opened the gate and let\ndown the bridge alone, and was now getting them up and shut again (as,\nowing to a very ingenious arrangement of cranks and levers, one man\ncould easily do, and indeed generally did do).\n\n'Where are the guard?' I gasped, fearing his answer as I never feared\nanything before.\n\n'I know not,' he answered; 'two hours ago, as I slept, was I seized and\nbound by the watch under me, and but now, this very moment, have I freed\nmyself with my teeth. I fear, I greatly fear, that we are betrayed.'\n\nHis words gave me fresh energy. Catching him by the arm, I staggered,\nfollowed by Umslopogaas, who reeled after us like a drunken man, through\nthe courtyards, up the great hall, which was silent as the grave,\ntowards the Queen's sleeping-place.\n\nWe reached the first ante-room--no guards; the second, still no guards.\nOh, surely the thing was done! we were too late after all, too late! The\nsilence and solitude of those great chambers was dreadful, and weighed\nme down like an evil dream. On, right into Nyleptha's chamber we rushed\nand staggered, sick at heart, fearing the very worst; we saw there was\na light in it, ay, and a figure bearing the light. Oh, thank God, it\nis the White Queen herself, the Queen unharmed! There she stands in\nher night gear, roused, by the clatter of our coming, from her bed, the\nheaviness of sleep yet in her eyes, and a red blush of fear and shame\nmantling her lovely breast and cheek.\n\n'Who is it?' she cries. 'What means this? Oh, Macumazahn, is it thou?\nWhy lookest thou so wildly? Thou comest as one bearing evil tidings--and\nmy lord--oh, tell me not my lord is dead--not dead!' she wailed,\nwringing her white hands.\n\n'I left Incubu wounded, but leading the advance against Sorais last\nnight at sundown; therefore let thy heart have rest. Sorais is beaten\nback all along her lines, and thy arms prevail.'\n\n'I knew it,' she cried in triumph. 'I knew that he would win; and they\ncalled him Outlander, and shook their wise heads when I gave him the\ncommand! Last night at sundown, sayest thou, and it is not yet dawn?\nSurely--'\n\n'Throw a cloak around thee, Nyleptha,' I broke in, 'and give us wine\nto drink; ay, and call thy maidens quick if thou wouldst save thyself\nalive. Nay, stay not.'\n\nThus adjured she ran and called through the curtains towards some room\nbeyond, and then hastily put on her sandals and a thick cloak, by which\ntime a dozen or so of half-dressed women were pouring into the room.\n\n'Follow us and be silent,' I said to them as they gazed with wondering\neyes, clinging one to another. So we went into the first ante-room.\n\n'Now,' I said, 'give us wine to drink and food, if ye have it, for we\nare near to death.'\n\nThe room was used as a mess-room for the officers of the guards, and\nfrom a cupboard some flagons of wine and some cold flesh were brought\nforth, and Umslopogaas and I drank, and felt life flow back into our\nveins as the good red wine went down.\n\n'Hark to me, Nyleptha,' I said, as I put down the empty tankard. 'Hast\nthou here among these thy waiting-ladies any two of discretion?'\n\n'Ay,' she said, 'surely.'\n\n'Then bid them go out by the side entrance to any citizens whom thou\ncanst bethink thee of as men loyal to thee, and pray them come armed,\nwith all honest folk that they can gather, to rescue thee from death.\nNay, question not; do as I say, and quickly. Kara here will let out the\nmaids.'\n\nShe turned, and selecting two of the crowd of damsels, repeated the\nwords I had uttered, giving them besides a list of the names of the men\nto whom each should run.\n\n'Go swiftly and secretly; go for your very lives,' I added.\n\nIn another moment they had left with Kara, whom I told to rejoin us at\nthe door leading from the great courtyard on to the stairway as soon as\nhe had made fast behind the girls. Thither, too, Umslopogaas and I made\nour way, followed by the Queen and her women. As we went we tore off\nmouthfuls of food, and between them I told her what I knew of the danger\nwhich encompassed her, and how we found Kara, and how all the guards and\nmen-servants were gone, and she was alone with her women in that great\nplace; and she told me, too, that a rumour had spread through the town\nthat our army had been utterly destroyed, and that Sorais was marching\nin triumph on Milosis, and how in consequence thereof all men had fallen\naway from her.\n\nThough all this takes some time to tell, we had not been but six or\nseven minutes in the palace; and notwithstanding that the golden roof of\nthe temple being very lofty was ablaze with the rays of the rising sun,\nit was not yet dawn, nor would be for another ten minutes. We were in\nthe courtyard now, and here my wound pained me so that I had to take\nNyleptha's arm, while Umslopogaas rolled along after us, eating as he\nwent.\n\nNow we were across it, and had reached the narrow doorway through the\npalace wall that opened on to the mighty stair.\n\nI looked through and stood aghast, as well I might. The door was gone,\nand so were the outer gates of bronze--entirely gone. They had been\ntaken from their hinges, and as we afterwards found, hurled from the\nstairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath. There in front of us\nwas the semicircular standing-space, about twice the size of a large\noval dining-table, and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to\nthe main stair--and that was all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII HOW UMSLOPOGAAS HELD THE STAIR\n\n\n\nWe looked at one another.\n\n'Thou seest,' I said, 'they have taken away the door. Is there aught\nwith which we may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us\nere the daylight.' I spoke thus, because I knew that we must hold this\nplace or none, as there were no inner doors in the palace, the rooms\nbeing separated one from another by curtains. I also knew that if\nwe could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in\nnowhere else; for the palace is absolutely impregnable, that is, since\nthe secret door by which Sorais had entered on that memorable night of\nattempted murder had, by Nyleptha's order, been closed up with masonry.\n\n'I have it,' said Nyleptha, who, as usual with her, rose to the\nemergency in a wonderful way. 'On the farther side of the courtyard are\nblocks of cut marble--the workmen brought them there for the bed of the\nnew statue of Incubu, my lord; let us block the door with them.'\n\nI jumped at the idea; and having despatched one of the remaining maidens\ndown the great stair to see if she could obtain assistance from the\ndocks below, where her father, who was a great merchant employing\nmany men, had his dwelling-place, and set another to watch through the\ndoorway, we made our way back across the courtyard to where the hewn\nmarble lay; and here we met Kara returning from despatching the first\ntwo messengers. There were the marble blocks, sure enough, broad,\nmassive lumps, some six inches thick, and weighing about eighty pounds\neach, and there, too, were a couple of implements like small stretchers,\nthat the workmen used to carry them on. Without delay we got some of the\nblocks on to the stretchers, and four of the girls carried them to the\ndoorway.\n\n'Listen, Macumazahn,' said Umslopogaas, 'if those low fellows come, it\nis I who will hold the stair against them till the door is built up.\nNay, nay, it will be a man's death: gainsay me not, old friend. It has\nbeen a good day, let it now be good night. See, I throw myself down to\nrest on the marble there; when their footsteps are nigh, wake thou me,\nnot before, for I need my strength,' and without a word he went outside\nand flung himself down on the marble, and was instantly asleep.\n\nAt this time, I too was overcome, and was forced to sit down by the\ndoorway, and content myself with directing operations. The girls\nbrought the block, while Kara and Nyleptha built them up across the\nsix-foot-wide doorway, a triple row of them, for less would be useless.\nBut the marble had to be brought forty yards and then there were forty\nyards to run back, and though the girls laboured gloriously, even\nstaggering along alone, each with a block in her arms, it was slow work,\ndreadfully slow.\n\nThe light was growing now, and presently, in the silence, we heard a\ncommotion at the far-bottom of the stair, and the faint clinking of\narmed men. As yet the wall was only two feet high, and we had been eight\nminutes at the building of it. So they had come. Alphonse had heard\naright.\n\nThe clanking sound came nearer, and in the ghostly grey of the dawning\nwe could make out long files of men, some fifty or so in all, slowly\ncreeping up the stair. They were now at the half-way standing place that\nrested on the great flying arch; and here, perceiving that something\nwas going on above, they, to our great gain, halted for three or four\nminutes and consulted, then slowly and cautiously advanced again.\n\nWe had been nearly a quarter of an hour at the work now, and it was\nalmost three feet high.\n\nThen I woke Umslopogaas. The great man rose, stretched himself, and\nswung Inkosi-kaas round his head.\n\n'It is well,' he said. 'I feel as a young man once more. My strength has\ncome back to me, ay, even as a lamp flares up before it dies. Fear not,\nI shall fight a good fight; the wine and the sleep have put a new heart\ninto me.\n\n'Macumazahn, I have dreamed a dream. I dreamed that thou and I stood\ntogether on a star, and looked down on the world, and thou wast as a\nspirit, Macumazahn, for light flamed through thy flesh, but I could not\nsee what was the fashion of mine own face. The hour has come for us,\nold hunter. So be it: we have had our time, but I would that in it I had\nseen some more such fights as yesterday's.\n\n'Let them bury me after the fashion of my people, Macumazahn, and set\nmy eyes towards Zululand;' and he took my hand and shook it, and then\nturned to face the advancing foe.\n\nJust then, to my astonishment, the Zu-Vendi officer Kara clambered over\nour improvised wall in his quiet, determined sort of way, and took his\nstand by the Zulu, unsheathing his sword as he did so.\n\n'What, comest thou too?' laughed out the old warrior. 'Welcome--a\nwelcome to thee, brave heart! Ow! for the man who can die like a man;\now! for the death grip and the ringing of steel. Ow! we are ready. We\nwet our beaks like eagles, our spears flash in the sun; we shake our\nassegais, and are hungry to fight. Who comes to give greeting to the\nChieftainess [Inkosi-kaas]? Who would taste her kiss, whereof the fruit\nis death? I, the Woodpecker, I, the Slaughterer, I the Swiftfooted! I,\nUmslopogaas, of the tribe of the Maquilisini, of the people of Amazulu,\na captain of the regiment of the Nkomabakosi: I, Umslopogaas, the son\nof Indabazimbi, the son of Arpi the son of Mosilikaatze, I of the royal\nblood of T'Chaka, I of the King's House, I the Ringed Man, I the Induna,\nI call to them as a buck calls, I challenge them, I await them. Ow! it\nis thou, it is thou!'\n\nAs he spake, or rather chanted, his wild war-song, the armed men,\namong whom in the growing light I recognized both Nasta and Agon, came\nstreaming up the stair with a rush, and one big fellow, armed with a\nheavy spear, dashed up the ten semicircular steps ahead of his comrades\nand struck at the great Zulu with the spear. Umslopogaas moved his\nbody but not his legs, so that the blow missed him, and next instant\nInkosi-kaas crashed through headpiece, hair and skull, and the\nman's corpse was rattling down the steps. As he dropped, his round\nhippopotamus-hide shield fell from his hand on to the marble, and the\nZulu stooped down and seized it, still chanting as he did so.\n\nIn another second the sturdy Kara had also slain a man, and then began a\nscene the like of which has not been known to me.\n\nUp rushed the assailants, one, two, three at a time, and as fast as they\ncame, the axe crashed and the sword swung, and down they rolled again,\ndead or dying. And ever as the fight thickened, the old Zulu's eye\nseemed to get quicker and his arm stronger. He shouted out his war-cries\nand the names of chiefs whom he had slain, and the blows of his awful\naxe rained straight and true, shearing through everything they fell on.\nThere was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this\nlast immortal fight of his; he had no time for it, but struck with his\nfull strength, and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks, and went\nrattling down the marble steps.\n\nThey hacked and hewed at him with swords and spears, wounding him in a\ndozen places till he streamed red with blood; but the shield protected\nhis head and the chain-shirt his vitals, and for minute after minute,\naided by the gallant Zu-Vendi, he still held the stair.\n\nAt last Kara's sword broke, and he grappled with a foe, and they rolled\ndown together, and he was cut to pieces, dying like the brave man that\nhe was.\n\nUmslopogaas was alone now, but he never blenched or turned. Shouting\nout some wild Zulu battle-cry, he beat down a foe, ay, and another, and\nanother, till at last they drew back from the slippery blood-stained\nsteps, and stared at him with amazement, thinking that he was no mortal\nman.\n\nThe wall of marble block was four feet six high now, and hope rose in my\nteeth as I leaned there against it a miserable helpless log, and ground\nmy teeth, and watched that glorious struggle. I could do no more for I\nhad lost my revolver in the battle.\n\nAnd old Umslopogaas, he leaned too on his good axe, and, faint as he\nwas with wounds, he mocked them, he called them 'women'--the grand old\nwarrior, standing there one against so many! And for a breathing space\nnone would come against him, notwithstanding Nasta's exhortations, till\nat last old Agon, who, to do him justice, was a brave man, mad with\nbaffled rage, and seeing that the wall would soon be built and his plans\ndefeated, shook the great spear he held, and rushed up the dripping\nsteps.\n\n'Ah, ah!' shouted the Zulu, as he recognized the priest's flowing white\nbeard, 'it is thou, old \"witch-finder\"! Come on! I await thee, white\n\"medicine man\"; come on! come on! I have sworn to slay thee, and I ever\nkeep my faith.'\n\nOn he came, taking him at his word, and drave the big spear with such\nforce at Umslopogaas that it sunk right through the tough shield and\npierced him in the neck. The Zulu cast down the transfixed shield, and\nthat moment was Agon's last, for before he could free his spear\nand strike again, with a shout of '_There's for thee, Rain-maker!_'\nUmslopogaas gripped Inkosi-kaas with both hands and whirled on high and\ndrave her right on to his venerable head, so that Agon rolled down dead\namong the corpses of his fellow-murderers, and there was an end to him\nand his plots altogether. And even as he fell, a great cry rose from the\nfoot of the stair, and looking out through the portion of the doorway\nthat was yet unclosed, we saw armed men rushing up to the rescue, and\ncalled an answer to their shouts. Then the would-be murderers who yet\nremained on the stairway, and amongst whom I saw several priests, turned\nto fly, but, having nowhere to go, were butchered as they fled. Only one\nman stayed, and he was the great lord Nasta, Nyleptha's suitor, and\nthe father of the plot. For a moment the black-bearded Nasta stood with\nbowed face leaning on his long sword as though in despair, and then,\nwith a dreadful shout, he too rushed up at the Zulu, and, swinging the\nglittering sword around his head, dealt him such a mighty blow beneath\nhis guard, that the keen steel of the heavy blade bit right through the\nchain armour and deep into Umslopogaas' side, for a moment paralysing\nhim and causing him to drop his axe.\n\nRaising the sword again, Nasta sprang forward to make an end of him,\nbut little he knew his foe. With a shake and a yell of fury, the Zulu\ngathered himself together and sprang straight at Nasta's throat, as I\nhave sometimes seen a wounded lion spring. He struck him full as his\nfoot was on the topmost stair, and his long arms closing round him like\niron bands, down they rolled together struggling furiously. Nasta was a\nstrong man and a desperate, but he could not match the strongest man in\nZululand, sore wounded though he was, whose strength was as the strength\nof a bull. In a minute the end came. I saw old Umslopogaas stagger\nto his feet--ay, and saw him by a single gigantic effort swing up the\nstruggling Nasta and with a shout of triumph hurl him straight over the\nparapet of the bridge, to be crushed to powder on the rocks two hundred\nfeet below.\n\nThe succour which had been summoned by the girl who had passed down the\nstair before the assassins passed up was at hand, and the loud shouts\nwhich reached us from the outer gates told us that the town was also\naroused, and the men awakened by the women were calling to be admitted.\nSome of Nyleptha's brave ladies, who in their night-shifts and with\ntheir long hair streaming down their backs, just as they had been\naroused from rest, went off to admit them at the side entrance, whilst\nothers, assisted by the rescuing party outside, pushed and pulled down\nthe marble blocks they had placed there with so much labour.\n\nSoon the wall was down again, and through the doorway, followed by a\ncrowd of rescuers, staggered old Umslopogaas, an awful and, in a way, a\nglorious figure. The man was a mass of wounds, and a glance at his wild\neye told me that he was dying. The 'keshla' gum-ring upon his head was\nsevered in two places by sword-cuts, one just over the curious hole in\nhis skull, and the blood poured down his face from the gashes. Also on\nthe right side of his neck was a stab from a spear, inflicted by\nAgon; there was a deep cut on his left arm just below where the mail\nshirt-sleeve stopped, and on the right side of his body the armour was\nsevered by a gash six inches long, where Nasta's mighty sword had bitten\nthrough it and deep into its wearer's vitals.\n\nOn, axe in hand, he staggered, that dreadful-looking, splendid savage,\nand the ladies forgot to turn faint at the scene of blood, and\ncheered him, as well they might, but he never stayed or heeded. With\noutstretched arms and tottering gait he pursued his way, followed by us\nall along the broad shell-strewn walk that ran through the courtyard,\npast the spot where the blocks of marble lay, through the round arched\ndoorway and the thick curtains that hung within it, down the\nshort passage and into the great hall, which was now filling with\nhastily-armed men, who poured through the side entrance. Straight up\nthe hall he went, leaving behind him a track of blood on the marble\npavement, till at last he reached the sacred stone, which stood in the\ncentre of it, and here his strength seemed to fail him, for he stopped\nand leaned upon his axe. Then suddenly he lifted up his voice and cried\naloud--\n\n'I die, I die--but it was a kingly fray. Where are they who came up the\ngreat stair? I see them not. Art thou there, Macumazahn, or art thou\ngone before to wait for me in the dark whither I go? The blood blinds\nme--the place turns round--I hear the voice of waters.'\n\nNext, as though a new thought had struck him, he lifted the red axe and\nkissed the blade.\n\n'Farewell, Inkosi-kaas,' he cried. 'Nay, nay, we will go together; we\ncannot part, thou and I. We have lived too long one with another, thou\nand I.\n\n'One more stroke, only one! A good stroke! a straight stroke! a\nstrong stroke!' and, drawing himself to his full height, with a wild\nheart-shaking shout, he with both hands began to whirl the axe round his\nhead till it looked like a circle of flaming steel. Then, suddenly, with\nawful force he brought it down straight on to the crown of the mass\nof sacred stone. A shower of sparks flew up, and such was the almost\nsuperhuman strength of the blow, that the massive marble split with\na rending sound into a score of pieces, whilst of Inkosi-kaas there\nremained but some fragments of steel and a fibrous rope of shattered\nhorn that had been the handle. Down with a crash on to the pavement fell\nthe fragments of the holy stone, and down with a crash on to them, still\ngrasping the knob of Inkosi-kaas, fell the brave old Zulu--_dead_.\n\nAnd thus the hero died.\n\nA gasp of wonder and astonishment rose from all those who witnessed\nthe extraordinary sight, and then somebody cried, '_The prophecy! the\nprophecy!_ He has shattered the sacred stone!' and at once a murmuring\narose.\n\n'Ay,' said Nyleptha, with that quick wit which distinguishes her.\n'Ay, my people, he has shattered the stone, and behold the prophecy is\nfulfilled, for a stranger king rules in Zu-Vendis. Incubu, my lord, hath\nbeat Sorais back, and I fear her no more, and to him who hath saved the\nCrown it shall surely be. And this man,' she said, turning to me and\nlaying her hand upon my shoulder, 'wot ye that, though wounded in the\nfight of yesterday, he rode with that old warrior who lies there, one\nhundred miles 'twixt sun set and rise to save me from the plots of cruel\nmen. Ay, and he has saved me, by a very little, and therefore because of\nthe deeds that they have done--deeds of glory such as our history cannot\nshow the like--therefore I say that the name of Macumazahn and the name\nof dead Umslopogaas, ay, and the name of Kara, my servant, who aided him\nto hold the stair, shall be blazoned in letters of gold above my throne,\nand shall be glorious for ever while the land endures. I, the Queen,\nhave said it.'\n\nThis spirited speech was met with loud cheering, and I said that after\nall we had only done our duty, as it is the fashion of both Englishmen\nand Zulus to do, and there was nothing to make an outcry about; at\nwhich they cheered still more, and then I was supported across the outer\ncourtyard to my old quarters, in order that I might be put to bed. As\nI went, my eyes lit upon the brave horse Daylight that lay there, his\nwhite head outstretched on the pavement, exactly as he had fallen on\nentering the yard; and I bade those who supported me take me near him,\nthat I might look on the good beast once more before he was dragged\naway. And as I looked, to my astonishment he opened his eyes and,\nlifting his head a little, whinnied faintly. I could have shouted for\njoy to find that he was not dead, only unfortunately I had not a shout\nleft in me; but as it was, grooms were sent for and he was lifted up\nand wine poured down his throat, and in a fortnight he was as well and\nstrong as ever, and is the pride and joy of all the people of Milosis,\nwho, whenever they see him, point him out to the little children as the\n'horse which saved the White Queen's life'.\n\nThen I went on and got off to bed, and was washed and had my mail shirt\nremoved. They hurt me a great deal in getting it off, and no wonder, for\non my left breast and side was a black bruise the size of a saucer.\n\nThe next thing that I remember was the tramp of horsemen outside the\npalace wall, some ten hours later. I raised myself and asked what was\nthe news, and they told me that a large body of cavalry sent by Curtis\nto assist the Queen had arrived from the scene of the battle, which they\nhad left two hours after sundown. When they left, the wreck of Sorais'\narmy was in full retreat upon M'Arstuna, followed by all our effective\ncavalry. Sir Henry was encamping the remains of his worn-out forces on\nthe site (such is the fortune of war) that Sorais had occupied the night\nbefore, and proposed marching to M'Arstuna on the morrow. Having heard\nthis, I felt that I could die with a light heart, and then everything\nbecame a blank.\n\n\nWhen next I awoke the first thing I saw was the round disc of a\nsympathetic eyeglass, behind which was Good.\n\n'How are you getting on, old chap?' said a voice from the neighbourhood\nof the eyeglass.\n\n'What are you doing here?' I asked faintly. 'You ought to be at\nM'Arstuna--have you run away, or what?'\n\n'M'Arstuna,' he replied cheerfully. 'Ah, M'Arstuna fell last\nweek--you've been unconscious for a fortnight, you see--with all the\nhonours of war, you know--trumpets blowing, flags flying, just as though\nthey had had the best of it; but for all that, weren't they glad to go.\nIsrael made for his tents, I can tell you--never saw such a sight in my\nlife.'\n\n'And Sorais?' I asked.\n\n'Sorais--oh, Sorais is a prisoner; they gave her up, the scoundrels,' he\nadded, with a change of tone--'sacrificed the Queen to save their skins,\nyou see. She is being brought up here, and I don't know what will happen\nto her, poor soul!' and he sighed.\n\n'Where is Curtis?' I asked.\n\n'He is with Nyleptha. She rode out to meet us today, and there was\na grand to-do, I can tell you. He is coming to see you tomorrow; the\ndoctors (for there is a medical \"faculty\" in Zu-Vendis as elsewhere)\nthought that he had better not come today.'\n\nI said nothing, but somehow I thought to myself that notwithstanding the\ndoctors he might have given me a look; but there, when a man is newly\nmarried and has just gained a great victory, he is apt to listen to the\nadvice of doctors, and quite right too.\n\nJust then I heard a familiar voice informing me that 'Monsieur must\nnow couch himself,' and looking up perceived Alphonse's enormous black\nmustachios curling away in the distance.\n\n'So you are here?' I said.\n\n'Mais oui, Monsieur; the war is now finished, my military instincts are\nsatisfied, and I return to nurse Monsieur.'\n\nI laughed, or rather tried to; but whatever may have been Alphonse's\nfailings as a warrior (and I fear that he did not come up to the level\nof his heroic grandfather in this particular, showing thereby how true\nis the saying that it is a bad thing to be overshadowed by some great\nancestral name), a better or kinder nurse never lived. Poor Alphonse! I\nhope he will always think of me as kindly as I think of him.\n\nOn the morrow I saw Curtis and Nyleptha with him, and he told me the\nwhole history of what had happened since Umslopogaas and I galloped\nwildly away from the battle to save the life of the Queen. It seemed\nto me that he had managed the thing exceedingly well, and showed great\nability as a general. Of course, however, our loss had been dreadfully\nheavy--indeed, I am afraid to say how many perished in the desperate\nbattle I have described, but I know that the slaughter has appreciably\naffected the male population of the country. He was very pleased to see\nme, dear fellow that he is, and thanked me with tears in his eyes\nfor the little that I had been able to do. I saw him, however, start\nviolently when his eyes fell upon my face.\n\nAs for Nyleptha, she was positively radiant now that 'her dear lord' had\ncome back with no other injury than an ugly scar on his forehead. I do\nnot believe that she allowed all the fearful slaughter that had taken\nplace to weigh ever so little in the balance against this one fact, or\neven to greatly diminish her joy; and I cannot blame her for it, seeing\nthat it is the nature of loving woman to look at all things through the\nspectacles of her love, and little does she reck of the misery of the\nmany if the happiness of the _one_ be assured. That is human nature,\nwhich the Positivists tell us is just perfection; so no doubt it is all\nright.\n\n'And what art thou going to do with Sorais?' I asked her.\n\nInstantly her bright brow darkened to a frown.\n\n'Sorais,' she said, with a little stamp of the foot; 'ah, but Sorais!'\n\nSir Henry hastened to turn the subject.\n\n'You will soon be about and all right again now, old fellow,' he said.\n\nI shook my head and laughed.\n\n'Don't deceive yourselves,' I said. 'I may be about for a little, but\nI shall never be all right again. I am a dying man, Curtis. I may die\nslow, but die I must. Do you know I have been spitting blood all the\nmorning? I tell you there is something working away into my lung; I can\nfeel it. There, don't look distressed; I have had my day, and am ready\nto go. Give me the mirror, will you? I want to look at myself.'\n\nHe made some excuse, but I saw through it and insisted, and at last he\nhanded me one of the discs of polished silver set in a wooden frame like\na hand-screen, which serve as looking-glasses in Zu-Vendis. I looked and\nput it down.\n\n'Ah,' I said quietly, 'I thought so; and you talk of my getting all\nright!' I did not like to let them see how shocked I really was at my\nown appearance. My grizzled stubby hair was turned snow-white, and my\nyellow face was shrunk like an aged woman's and had two deep purple\nrings painted beneath the eyes.\n\nHere Nyleptha began to cry, and Sir Henry again turned the subject,\ntelling me that the artists had taken a cast of the dead body of old\nUmslopogaas, and that a great statue in black marble was to be erected\nof him in the act of splitting the sacred stone, which was to be matched\nby another statue in white marble of myself and the horse Daylight as he\nappeared when, at the termination of that wild ride, he sank beneath me\nin the courtyard of the palace. I have since seen these statues, which\nat the time of writing this, six months after the battle, are nearly\nfinished; and very beautiful they are, especially that of Umslopogaas,\nwhich is exactly like him. As for that of myself, it is good, but they\nhave idealized my ugly face a little, which is perhaps as well, seeing\nthat thousands of people will probably look at it in the centuries to\ncome, and it is not pleasant to look at ugly things.\n\nThen they told me that Umslopogaas' last wish had been carried out, and\nthat, instead of being cremated, as I shall be, after the usual custom\nhere, he had been tied up, Zulu fashion, with his knees beneath his\nchin, and, having been wrapped in a thin sheet of beaten gold, entombed\nin a hole hollowed out of the masonry of the semicircular space at the\ntop of the stair he defended so splendidly, which faces, as far as we\ncan judge, almost exactly towards Zululand. There he sits, and will sit\nfor ever, for they embalmed him with spices, and put him in an air-tight\nstone coffer, keeping his grim watch beneath the spot he held alone\nagainst a multitude; and the people say that at night his ghost rises\nand stands shaking the phantom of Inkosi-kaas at phantom foes. Certainly\nthey fear during the dark hours to pass the place where the hero is\nburied.\n\nOddly enough, too, a new legend or prophecy has arisen in the land in\nthat unaccountable way in which such things to arise among barbarous\nand semi-civilized people, blowing, like the wind, no man knows whence.\nAccording to this saying, so long as the old Zulu sits there, looking\ndown the stairway he defended when alive, so long will the New House of\nthe Stairway, springing from the union of the Englishman and Nyleptha,\nendure and flourish; but when he is taken from thence, or when, ages\nafter, his bones at last crumble into dust, the House will fall, and the\nStairway shall fall, and the Nation of the Zu-Vendi shall cease to be a\nNation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII I HAVE SPOKEN\n\n\n\nIt was a week after Nyleptha's visit, when I had begun to get about\na little in the middle of the day, that a message came to me from Sir\nHenry to say that Sorais would be brought before them in the Queen's\nfirst antechamber at midday, and requesting my attendance if possible.\nAccordingly, greatly drawn by curiosity to see this unhappy woman once\nmore, I made shift, with the help of that kind little fellow Alphonse,\nwho is a perfect treasure to me, and that of another waiting-man, to\nreach the antechamber. I got there, indeed, before anybody else, except\na few of the great Court officials who had been bidden to be present,\nbut I had scarcely seated myself before Sorais was brought in by a party\nof guards, looking as beautiful and defiant as ever, but with a worn\nexpression on her proud face. She was, as usual, dressed in her royal\n'kaf', emblazoned with the emblem of the Sun, and in her right hand she\nstill held the toy spear of silver. A pang of admiration and pity went\nthrough me as I looked at her, and struggling to my feet I bowed deeply,\nat the same time expressing my sorrow that I was not able, owing to my\ncondition, to remain standing before her.\n\nShe coloured a little and then laughed bitterly. 'Thou dost forget,\nMacumazahn,' she said, 'I am no more a Queen, save in blood; I am an\noutcast and a prisoner, one whom all men should scorn, and none show\ndeference to.'\n\n'At least,' I replied, 'thou art still a lady, and therefore one to whom\ndeference is due. Also, thou art in an evil case, and therefore it is\ndoubly due.'\n\n'Ah!' she answered, with a little laugh, 'thou dost forget that I\nwould have wrapped thee in a sheet of gold and hung thee to the angel's\ntrumpet at the topmost pinnacle of the Temple.'\n\n'No,' I answered, 'I assure thee that I forgot it not; indeed, I often\nthought of it when it seemed to me that the battle of the Pass was\nturning against us; but the trumpet is there, and I am still here,\nthough perchance not for long, so why talk of it now?'\n\n'Ah!' she went on, 'the battle! the battle! Oh, would that I were once\nmore a Queen, if only for one little hour, and I would take such a\nvengeance on those accursed jackals who deserted me in my need; that it\nshould only be spoken of in whispers; those woman, those pigeon-hearted\nhalf-breeds who suffered themselves to be overcome!' and she choked in\nher wrath.\n\n'Ay, and that little coward beside thee,' she went on, pointing at\nAlphonse with the silver spear, whereat he looked very uncomfortable;\n'he escaped and betrayed my plans. I tried to make a general of him,\ntelling the soldiers it was Bougwan, and to scourge valour into him'\n(here Alphonse shivered at some unhappy recollection), 'but it was of no\navail. He hid beneath a banner in my tent and thus overheard my plans. I\nwould that I had slain him, but, alas! I held my hand.\n\n'And thou, Macumazahn, I have heard of what thou didst; thou art brave,\nand hast a loyal heart. And the black one too, ah, he was a _man_. I\nwould fain have seen him hurl Nasta from the stairway.'\n\n'Thou art a strange woman, Sorais,' I said; 'I pray thee now plead with\nthe Queen Nyleptha, that perchance she may show mercy unto thee.'\n\nShe laughed out loud. 'I plead for mercy!' she said and at that moment\nthe Queen entered, accompanied by Sir Henry and Good, and took her seat\nwith an impassive face. As for poor Good, he looked intensely ill at\nease.\n\n'Greeting, Sorais!' said Nyleptha, after a short pause. 'Thou hast rent\nthe kingdom like a rag, thou hast put thousands of my people to the\nsword, thou hast twice basely plotted to destroy my life by murder, thou\nhast sworn to slay my lord and his companions and to hurl me from the\nStairway. What hast thou to say why thou shouldst not die? Speak, O\nSorais!'\n\n'Methinks my sister the Queen hath forgotten the chief count of the\nindictment,' answered Sorais in her slow musical tones. 'It runs thus:\n\"Thou didst strive to win the love of my lord Incubu.\" It is for this\ncrime that my sister will slay me, not because I levied war. It is\nperchance happy for thee, Nyleptha, that I fixed my mind upon his love\ntoo late.\n\n'Listen,' she went on, raising her voice. 'I have nought to say save\nthat I would I had won instead of lost. Do thou with me even as\nthou wilt, O Queen, and let my lord the King there' (pointing to Sir\nHenry)--'for now will he be King--carry out the sentence, as it is meet\nhe should, for as he is the beginning of the evil, let him also be the\nend.' And she drew herself up and shot one angry glance at him from her\ndeep fringed eyes, and then began to toy with her spear.\n\nSir Henry bent towards Nyleptha and whispered something that I could not\ncatch, and then the Queen spoke.\n\n'Sorais, ever have I been a good sister to thee. When our father died,\nand there was much talk in the land as to whether thou shouldst sit\nupon the throne with me, I being the elder, I gave my voice for thee and\nsaid, \"Nay, let her sit. She is twin with me; we were born at a birth;\nwherefore should the one be preferred before the other?\" And so has it\never been 'twixt thee and me, my sister. But now thou knowest in what\nsort thou hast repaid me, but I have prevailed, and thy life is forfeit,\nSorais. And yet art thou my sister, born at a birth with me, and we\nplayed together when we were little and loved each other much, and at\nnight we slept in the same cot with our arms each around the other's\nneck, and therefore even now does my heart go out to thee, Sorais.\n\n'But not for that would I spare thy life, for thy offence has been too\nheavy; it doth drag down the wide wings of my mercy even to the ground.\nAlso, while thou dost live the land will never be at peace.\n\n'Yet shalt thou not die, Sorais, because my dear lord here hath begged\nthy life of me as a boon; therefore as a boon and as a marriage gift\ngive I it to him, to do with even as he wills, knowing that, though\nthou dost love him, he loves thee not, Sorais, for all thy beauty. Nay,\nthough thou art lovely as the night in all her stars, O Lady of the\nNight, yet it is me his wife whom he loves, and not thee, and therefore\ndo I give thy life to him.'\n\nSorais flushed up to her eyes and said nothing, and I do not think that\nI ever saw a man look more miserable than did Sir Henry at that moment.\nSomehow, Nyleptha's way of putting the thing, though true and forcible\nenough, was not altogether pleasant.\n\n'I understand,' stammered Curtis, looking at Good, 'I understood that he\nwere attached--eh--attached to--to the Queen Sorais. I am--eh--not aware\nwhat the--in short, the state of your feelings may be just now; but if\nthey happened to be that way inclined, it has struck me that--in short,\nit might put a satisfactory end to an unpleasant business. The lady also\nhas ample private estates, where I am sure she would be at liberty to\nlive unmolested as far as we are concerned, eh, Nyleptha? Of course, I\nonly suggest.'\n\n'So far as I am concerned,' said Good, colouring up, 'I am quite willing\nto forget the past; and if the Lady of the Night thinks me worth the\ntaking I will marry her tomorrow, or when she likes, and try to make her\na good husband.'\n\nAll eyes were now turned to Sorais, who stood with that same slow smile\nupon her beautiful face which I had noticed the first time that I ever\nsaw her. She paused a little while, and cleared her throat, and then\nthrice she curtseyed low, once to Nyleptha, once to Curtis, and once to\nGood, and began to speak in measured tones.\n\n'I thank thee, most gracious Queen and royal sister, for the\nloving-kindness thou hast shown me from my youth up, and especially in\nthat thou hast been pleased to give my person and my fate as a gift\nto the Lord Incubu--the King that is to be. May prosperity, peace and\nplenty deck the life-path of one so merciful and so tender, even as\nflowers do. Long mayst thou reign, O great and glorious Queen, and hold\nthy husband's love in both thy hands, and many be the sons and daughters\nof thy beauty. And I thank thee, my Lord Incubu--the King that is to\nbe--I thank thee a thousand times in that thou hast been pleased to\naccept that gracious gift, and to pass it on to thy comrade in arms\nand in adventure, the Lord Bougwan. Surely the act is worthy of thy\ngreatness, my Lord Incubu. And now, lastly, I thank thee also, my Lord\nBougwan, who in thy turn hast deigned to accept me and my poor beauty.\nI thank thee a thousand times, and I will add that thou art a good and\nhonest man, and I put my hand upon my heart and swear that I would that\nI could say thee \"yea\". And now that I have rendered thanks to all in\nturn'--and again she smiled--'I will add one short word.\n\n'Little can you understand of me, Queen Nyleptha and my lords, if ye\nknow not that for me there is no middle path; that I scorn your pity and\nhate you for it; that I cast off your forgiveness as though it were a\nserpent's sting; and that standing here, betrayed, deserted, insulted,\nand alone, I yet triumph over you, mock you, and defy you, one and all,\nand _thus_ I answer you.' And then, of a sudden, before anybody guessed\nwhat she intended to do, she drove the little silver spear she carried\nin her hand into her side with such a strong and steady aim that the\nkeen point projected through her back, and she fell prone upon the\npavement.\n\nNyleptha shrieked, and poor Good almost fainted at the sight, while the\nrest of us rushed towards her. But Sorais of the Night lifted herself\nupon her hand, and for a moment fixed her glorious eyes intently on\nCurtis' face, as though there were some message in the glance, then\ndropped her head and sighed, and with a sob her dark but splendid spirit\npassed.\n\nWell, they gave her a royal funeral, and there was an end of her.\n\n\nIt was a month after the last act of the Sorais tragedy that a great\nceremony was held in the Flower Temple, and Curtis was formally declared\nKing-Consort of Zu-Vendis. I was too ill to go myself; and indeed, I\nhate all that sort of thing, with the crowds and the trumpet-blowing and\nbanner-waving; but Good, who was there (in his full-dress uniform), came\nback much impressed, and told me that Nyleptha had looked lovely, and\nCurtis had borne himself in a right royal fashion, and had been received\nwith acclamations that left no doubt as to his popularity. Also he told\nme that when the horse Daylight was led along in the procession, the\npopulace had shouted '_Macumazahn, Macumazahn!_' till they were hoarse,\nand would only be appeased when he, Good, rose in his chariot and told\nthem that I was too ill to be present.\n\nAfterwards, too, Sir Henry, or rather the King, came to see me, looking\nvery tired, and vowing that he had never been so bored in his life;\nbut I dare say that that was a slight exaggeration. It is not in human\nnature that a man should be altogether bored on such an extraordinary\noccasion; and, indeed, as I pointed out to him, it was a marvellous\nthing that a man, who but little more than one short year before had\nentered a great country as an unknown wanderer, should today be\nmarried to its beautiful and beloved Queen, and lifted, amidst public\nrejoicings, to its throne. I even went the length to exhort him in the\nfuture not to be carried away by the pride and pomp of absolute\npower, but always to strive to remember that he was first a Christian\ngentleman, and next a public servant, called by Providence to a great\nand almost unprecedented trust. These remarks, which he might fairly\nhave resented, he was so good as to receive with patience, and even to\nthank me for making them.\n\nIt was immediately after this ceremony that I caused myself to be moved\nto the house where I am now writing. It is a very pleasant country seat,\nsituated about two miles from the Frowning City, on to which it looks.\nThat was five months ago, during the whole of which time I have, being\nconfined to a kind of couch, employed my leisure in compiling this\nhistory of our wanderings from my journal and from our joint memories.\nIt is probable that it will never be read, but it does not much matter\nwhether it is or not; at any rate, it has served to while away many\nhours of suffering, for I have suffered a deal of pain lately. Thank\nGod, however, there will not be much more of it.\n\n\nIt is a week since I wrote the above, and now I take up my pen for the\nlast time, for I know that the end is at hand. My brain is still clear\nand I can manage to write, though with difficulty. The pain in my lung,\nwhich has been very bad during the last week, has suddenly quite left\nme, and been succeeded by a feeling of numbness of which I cannot\nmistake the meaning. And just as the pain has gone, so with it all fear\nof that end has departed, and I feel only as though I were going to sink\ninto the arms of an unutterable rest. Happily, contentedly, and with the\nsame sense of security with which an infant lays itself to sleep in its\nmother's arms, do I lay myself down in the arms of the Angel Death. All\nthe tremors, all the heart-shaking fears which have haunted me through\na life that seems long as I looked back upon it, have left me now; the\nstorms have passed, and the Star of our Eternal Hope shines clear and\nsteady on the horizon that seems so far from man, and yet is so very\nnear to me tonight.\n\nAnd so this is the end of it--a brief space of troubling, a few\nrestless, fevered, anguished years, and then the arms of that great\nAngel Death. Many times have I been near to them, and now it is my turn\nat last, and it is well. Twenty-four hours more and the world will be\ngone from me, and with it all its hopes and all its fears. The air will\nclose in over the space that my form filled and my place know me no\nmore; for the dull breath of the world's forgetfulness will first dim\nthe brightness of my memory, and then blot it out for ever, and of a\ntruth I shall be dead. So is it with us all. How many millions have lain\nas I lie, and thought these thoughts and been forgotten!--thousands upon\nthousands of years ago they thought them, those dying men of the dim\npast; and thousands on thousands of years hence will their descendants\nthink them and be in their turn forgotten. 'As the breath of the oxen\nin winter, as the quick star that runs along the sky, as a little shadow\nthat loses itself at sunset,' as I once heard a Zulu called Ignosi put\nit, such is the order of our life, the order that passeth away.\n\nWell, it is not a good world--nobody can say that it is, save those who\nwilfully blind themselves to facts. How can a world be good in which\nMoney is the moving power, and Self-interest the guiding star? The\nwonder is not that it is so bad, but that there should be any good left\nin it.\n\nStill, now that my life is over, I am glad to have lived, glad to have\nknown the dear breath of woman's love, and that true friendship which\ncan even surpass the love of woman, glad to have heard the laughter of\nlittle children, to have seen the sun and the moon and the stars, to\nhave felt the kiss of the salt sea on my face, and watched the wild game\ntrek down to the water in the moonlight. But I should not wish to live\nagain!\n\nEverything is changing to me. The darkness draws near, and the light\ndeparts. And yet it seems to me that through that darkness I can already\nsee the shining welcome of many a long-lost face. Harry is there, and\nothers; one above all, to my mind the sweetest and most perfect woman\nthat ever gladdened this grey earth. But of her I have already written\nelsewhere, and at length, so why speak of her now? Why speak of her\nafter this long silence, now that she is again so near to me, now that I\ngo where she has gone?\n\nThe sinking sun is turning the golden roof of the great Temple to a\nfiery flame, and my fingers tire.\n\nSo to all who have known me, or known of me, to all who can think one\nkindly thought of the old hunter, I stretch out my hand from the far-off\nshore and bid a long farewell.\n\nAnd now into the hands of Almighty God, who sent it, do I commit my\nspirit.\n\n'_I have spoken,_' as the Zulus say.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV  BY ANOTHER HAND\n\n\nA year has elapsed since our most dear friend Allan Quatermain wrote the\nwords '_I have spoken_' at the end of his record of our adventures. Nor\nshould I have ventured to make any additions to the record had it not\nhappened that by a most strange accident a chance has arisen of its\nbeing conveyed to England. The chance is but a faint one, it is true;\nbut, as it is not probable that another will arise in our lifetimes,\nGood and myself think that we may as well avail ourselves of it, such as\nit is. During the last six months several Frontier Commissions have\nbeen at work on the various boundaries of Zu-Vendis, with a view of\ndiscovering whether there exists any possible means of ingress or egress\nfrom the country, with the result that a channel of communication with\nthe outer world hitherto overlooked has been discovered. This channel,\napparently the only one (for I have discovered that it was by it that\nthe native who ultimately reached Mr Mackenzie's mission station,\nand whose arrival in the country, together with the fact of his\nexpulsion--for he _did_ arrive about three years before ourselves--was\nfor reasons of their own kept a dead secret by the priests to whom he\nwas brought), is about to be effectually closed. But before this is\ndone, a messenger is to be despatched bearing with him this manuscript,\nand also one or two letters from Good to his friends, and from myself to\nmy brother George, whom it deeply grieves me to think I shall never see\nagain, informing them, as our next heirs, that they are welcome to our\neffects in England, if the Court of Probate will allow them to take them\n{Endnote 22}, inasmuchas we have made up our minds never to return to\nEurope. Indeed, it would be impossible for us to leave Zu-Vendis even if\nwe wished to do so.\n\nThe messenger who is to go--and I wish him joy of his journey--is\nAlphonse. For a long while he has been wearied to death of Zu-Vendis\nand its inhabitants. 'Oh, oui, c'est beau,' he says, with an expressive\nshrug; 'mais je m'ennuie; ce n'est pas chic.' Again, he complains\ndreadfully of the absence of cafes and theatres, and moans continually\nfor his lost Annette, of whom he says he dreams three times a week. But\nI fancy his secret cause of disgust at the country, putting aside the\nhomesickness to which every Frenchman is subject, is that the people\nhere laugh at him so dreadfully about his conduct on the occasion of the\ngreat battle of the Pass about eighteen months ago, when he hid beneath\na banner in Sorais's tent in order to avoid being sent forth to fight,\nwhich he says would have gone against his conscience. Even the little\nboys call out at him in the streets, thereby offending his pride and\nmaking his life unbearable. At any rate, he has determined to brave the\nhorrors of a journey of almost unprecedented difficulty and danger, and\nalso to run the risk of falling into the hands of the French police\nto answer for a certain little indiscretion of his own some years old\n(though I do not consider that a very serious matter), rather than\nremain in ce triste pays. Poor Alphonse! we shall be very sorry to part\nwith him; but I sincerely trust, for his own sake and also for the sake\nof this history, which is, I think, worth giving to the world, that he\nmay arrive in safety. If he does, and can carry the treasure we have\nprovided him with in the shape of bars of solid gold, he will be,\ncomparatively speaking, a rich man for life, and well able to marry his\nAnnette, if she is still in the land of the living and willing to marry\nher Alphonse.\n\nAnyhow, on the chance, I may as well add a word or two to dear old\nQuatermain's narrative.\n\nHe died at dawn on the day following that on which he wrote the last\nwords of the last chapter. Nyleptha, Good and myself were present, and a\nmost touching and yet in its way beautiful scene it was. An hour before\nthe daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking, and our\ndistress was very keen. Indeed, Good melted into tears at the idea--a\nfact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying\nfriend, for even at that hour he could be humorous. Good's emotion had,\nby loosening the muscles, naturally caused his eyeglass to fall from\nits accustomed place, and Quatermain, who always observed everything,\nobserved this also.\n\n'At last,' he gasped, with an attempt at a smile, 'I have seen Good\nwithout his eyeglass.'\n\nAfter that he said no more till the day broke, when he asked to be\nlifted up to watch the rising of the sun for the last time.\n\n'In a very few minutes,' he said, after gazing earnestly at it, 'I shall\nhave passed through those golden gates.'\n\nTen minutes afterwards he raised himself and looked us fixedly in the\nface.\n\n'I am going a stranger journey than any we have ever taken together.\nThink of me sometimes,' he murmured. 'God bless you all. I shall wait\nfor you.' And with a sigh he fell back dead.\n\nAnd so passed away a character that I consider went as near perfection\nas any it has ever been my lot to encounter.\n\nTender, constant, humorous, and possessing of many of the qualities that\ngo to make a poet, he was yet almost unrivalled as a man of action and\na citizen of the world. I never knew any one so competent to form an\naccurate judgment of men and their motives. 'I have studied human nature\nall my life,' he would say, 'and I ought to know something about it,'\nand he certainly did. He had but two faults--one was his excessive\nmodesty, and the other a slight tendency which he had to be jealous of\nanybody on whom he concentrated his affections. As regards the first of\nthese points, anybody who reads what he has written will be able to form\nhis own opinion; but I will add one last instance of it.\n\nAs the reader will doubtless remember, it is a favourite trick of his to\ntalk of himself as a timid man, whereas really, though very cautious,\nhe possessed a most intrepid spirit, and, what is more, never lost his\nhead. Well, in the great battle of the Pass, where he got the wound that\nfinally killed him, one would imagine from the account which he gives\nof the occurrence that it was a chance blow that fell on him in the\nscrimmage. As a matter of fact, however, he was wounded in a most\ngallant and successful attempt to save Good's life, at the risk and, as\nit ultimately turned out, at the cost of his own. Good was down on the\nground, and one of Nasta's highlanders was about to dispatch him, when\nQuatermain threw himself on to his prostrate form and received the blow\non his own body, and then, rising, killed the soldier.\n\nAs regards his jealousy, a single instance which I give in justice to\nmyself and Nyleptha will suffice. The reader will, perhaps, recollect\nthat in one or two places he speaks as though Nyleptha monopolized me,\nand he was left by both of us rather out in the cold. Now Nyleptha is\nnot perfect, any more than any other woman is, and she may be a little\nexigeante at times, but as regards Quatermain the whole thing is pure\nimagination. Thus when he complains about my not coming to see him when\nhe is ill, the fact was that, in spite of my entreaties, the doctors\npositively forbade it. Those little remarks of his pained me very much\nwhen I read them, for I loved Quatermain as dearly as though he were\nmy own father, and should never have dreamed of allowing my marriage to\ninterfere with that affection. But let it pass; it is, after all, but\none little weakness, which makes no great show among so many and such\nlovable virtues.\n\nWell, he died, and Good read the Burial Service over him in the presence\nof Nyleptha and myself; and then his remains were, in deference to the\npopular clamour, accorded a great public funeral, or rather cremation. I\ncould not help thinking, however, as I marched in that long and splendid\nprocession up to the Temple, how he would have hated the whole thing\ncould he have been there to see it, for he had a horror of ostentation.\n\nAnd so, a few minutes before sunset, on the third night after his death,\nthey laid him on the brazen flooring before the altar, and waited for\nthe last ray of the setting sun to fall upon his face. Presently it\ncame, and struck him like a golden arrow, crowning the pale brows with\nglory, and then the trumpets blew, and the flooring revolved, and all\nthat remained of our beloved friend fell into the furnace below.\n\nWe shall never see his like again if we live a hundred years. He was\nthe ablest man, the truest gentleman, the firmest friend, the finest\nsportsman, and, I believe, the best shot in all Africa.\n\nAnd so ended the very remarkable and adventurous life of Hunter\nQuatermain.\n\n\nSince then things have gone very well with us. Good has been, and still\nis, busily employed in the construction of a navy on Lake Milosis and\nanother of the large lakes, by means of which we hope to be able to\nincrease trade and commerce, and also to overcome some very troublesome\nand warlike sections of the population who live upon their borders. Poor\nfellow! he is beginning to get over the sad death of that misguided but\nmost attractive woman, Sorais, but it is a sad blow to him, for he was\nreally deeply attached to her. I hope, however, that he will in time\nmake a suitable marriage and get that unhappy business out of his head.\nNyleptha has one or two young ladies in view, especially a daughter of\nNasta's (who was a widower), a very fine imperial-looking girl, but with\ntoo much of her father's intriguing, and yet haughty, spirit to suit my\ntaste.\n\nAs for myself, I should scarcely know where to begin if I set to work\nto describe my doings, so I had best leave them undescribed, and content\nmyself with saying that, on the whole, I am getting on very well in my\ncurious position of King-Consort--better, indeed, than I had any right\nto expect. But, of course, it is not all plain sailing, and I find the\nresponsibilities very heavy. Still, I hope to be able to do some good in\nmy time, and I intend to devote myself to two great ends--namely, to the\nconsolidation of the various clans which together make up the Zu-Vendi\npeople, under one strong central government, and to the sapping of the\npower of the priesthood. The first of these reforms will, if it can\nbe carried out, put an end to the disastrous civil wars that have for\ncenturies devastated this country; and the second, besides removing a\nsource of political danger, will pave the road for the introduction of\ntrue religion in the place of this senseless Sun worship. I yet hope to\nsee the shadow of the Cross of Christ lying on the golden dome of the\nFlower Temple; or, if I do not, that my successors may.\n\nThere is one more thing that I intend to devote myself to, and that is\nthe total exclusion of all foreigners from Zu-Vendis. Not, indeed, that\nany more are ever likely to get here, but if they do, I warn them fairly\nthat they will be shown the shortest way out of the country. I do not\nsay this from any sense of inhospitality, but because I am convinced of\nthe sacred duty that rests upon me of preserving to this, on the\nwhole, upright and generous-hearted people the blessings of comparative\nbarbarism. Where would all my brave army be if some enterprising rascal\nwere to attack us with field-guns and Martini-Henrys? I cannot see that\ngunpowder, telegraphs, steam, daily newspapers, universal suffrage,\netc., etc., have made mankind one whit the happier than they used to\nbe, and I am certain that they have brought many evils in their train.\nI have no fancy for handing over this beautiful country to be torn and\nfought for by speculators, tourists, politicians and teachers, whose\nvoice is as the voice of Babel, just as those horrible creatures in the\nvalley of the underground river tore and fought for the body of the wild\nswan; nor will I endow it with the greed, drunkenness, new diseases,\ngunpowder, and general demoralization which chiefly mark the progress\nof civilization amongst unsophisticated peoples. If in due course it\npleases Providence to throw Zu-Vendis open to the world, that is another\nmatter; but of myself I will not take the responsibility, and I may add\nthat Good entirely approves of my decision. Farewell.\n\nHenry Curtis\n\n\nDecember 15, 18--.\n\nPS--I quite forgot to say that about nine months ago Nyleptha (who\nis very well and, in my eyes at any rate, more beautiful than ever)\npresented me with a son and heir. He is a regular curly-haired,\nblue-eyed young Englishman in looks, and, though he is destined, if he\nlives, to inherit the throne of Zu-Vendis, I hope I may be able to bring\nhim up to become what an English gentleman should be, and generally\nis--which is to my mind even a prouder and a finer thing than being\nborn heir apparent to the great House of the Stairway, and, indeed, the\nhighest rank that a man can reach upon this earth.\n\nH. C.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE BY GEORGE CURTIS, Esq.\n\n\n\nThe MS of this history, addressed to me in the handwriting of my dear\nbrother Henry Curtis, whom we had given up for dead, and bearing the\nAden postmark, reached me in safety on December 20, 18--, or a little\nmore than two years after it left his hands in the far centre of Africa,\nand I hasten to give the astonishing story it contains to the world.\nSpeaking for myself, I have read it with very mixed feelings; for though\nit is a great relief to know that he and Good are alive and strangely\nprosperous, I cannot but feel that for me and for all their friends they\nmight as well be dead, since we can never hope to see them more.\n\nThey have cut themselves off from old England and from their homes and\ntheir relations for ever, and perhaps, under the circumstances, they\nwere right and wise to do so.\n\nHow the MS came to be posted I have been quite unable to discover; but\nI presume, from the fact of its being posted at all, that the little\nFrenchman, Alphonse, accomplished his hazardous journey in safety. I\nhave, however, advertised for him and caused various inquiries to\nbe made in Marseilles and elsewhere with a view of discovering his\nwhereabouts, but so far without the slightest success. Possibly he is\ndead, and the packet was posted by another hand; or possibly he is now\nhappily wedded to his Annette, but still fears the vengeance of the law,\nand prefers to remain incognito. I cannot say, I have not yet abandoned\nmy hopes of finding him, but I am bound to say that they grow fainter\nday by day, and one great obstacle to my search is that nowhere in\nthe whole history does Mr Quatermain mention his surname. He is always\nspoken of as 'Alphonse', and there are so many Alphonses. The letters\nwhich my brother Henry says he is sending with the packet of manuscript\nhave never arrived, so I presume that they are lost or destroyed.\n\nGeorge Curtis\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORITIES\n\n\n\nA novelist is not usually asked, like a historian, for his 'Quellen'.\nAs I have, however, judging from certain experiences in the past,\nsome reason to anticipate such a demand, I wish to acknowledge my\nindebtedness to Mr Thomson's admirable history of travel 'Through Masai\nLand' for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes\ninhabiting that portion of the East Coast, and the country where\nthey live; also to my brother, John G. Haggard, RN, HBM's consul at\nMadagascar, and formerly consul at Lamu, for many details furnished by\nhim of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the Masai; also\nto my sister-in-law, Mrs John Haggard, who kindly put the lines of p.\n183 into rhyme for me; also to an extract in a review from some book of\ntravel of which I cannot recollect the name, to which I owe the idea of\nthe great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river. {Endnote 23}\nBut if I remember right, the crabs in the book when irritated projected\ntheir eyes quite out of their heads. I regret that I was not able to\n'plagiarize' this effect, but I felt that, although crabs may, and\ndoubtless do, behave thus in real life, in romance they 'will not do\nso.'\n\nThere is an underground river in 'Peter Wilkins', but at the time of\nwriting the foregoing pages I had not read that quaint but entertaining\nwork.\n\nIt has been pointed out to me that there exists a similarity between the\nscene of Umslopogaas frightening Alphonse with his axe and a scene in\nFar from the Madding Crowd. I regret this coincidence, and believe that\nthe talented author of that work will not be inclined to accuse me of\nliterary immorality on its account.\n\nFinally, I may say that Mr Quatermain's little Frenchman appears to\nbelong to the same class of beings as those English ladies whose long\nyellow teeth and feet of enormous size excite our hearty amusement in\nthe pages of the illustrated Gallic press.\n\nThe Writer of 'Allan Quatermain'\n\n\nEndnote 1\n\nAmong the Zulus a man assumes the ring, which is made of a species of\nblack gum twisted in with the hair, and polished a brilliant black,\nwhen he has reached a certain dignity and age, or is the husband of a\nsufficient number of wives.

These\nare, I believe, the first white people who are known to have fallen\nvictims to this cruel tribe.--Editor.\n\n\nEndnote 9\n\nMr Allan Quatermain misquotes--Pleasure sat at the helm.--Editor.\n\n\nEndnote 10\n\n  Where Alph the sacred river ran\n  Through caverns measureless to man\n  Down to a sunless sea\n\n\nEndnote 11\n\nMr Quatermain does not seem to have been aware that it is common for\nanimal-worshipping people to annually sacrifice the beasts they adore.\nSee Herodotus, ii. 45.--Editor.\n\n\nEndnote 12\n\nThere is another theory which might account for the origin of the\nZu-Vendi which does not seem to have struck my friend Mr Quatermain\nand his companions, and that is, that they are descendants of the\nPhoenicians. The cradle of the Phoenician race is supposed to have\nbeen on the western shore of the Persian Gulf. Thence, as there is\ngood evidence to show, they emigrated in two streams, one of which took\npossession of the shores of Palestine, while the other is supposed by\nsavants to have immigrated down the coast of Eastern Africa where,\nnear Mozambique, signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting.\nIndeed, it would have been very extraordinary if they did not, when\nleaving the Persian Gulf, make straight for the East Coast, seeing that\nthe north-east monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that\ndirection, while for the other six months it blows back again. And, by\nthe way of illustrating the probability, I may add that to this day a\nvery extensive trade is carried on between the Persian Gulf and Lamu and\nother East African ports as far south as Madagascar, which is of course\nthe ancient Ebony Isle of the 'Arabian Nights'.--Editor.\n\n\nEndnote 13\n\nThere are twenty-two letters in the Phoenician alphabet (see Appendix,\nMaspero's Histoire ancienne des peuples de l'Orient, p. 746, etc.)\nUnfortunately Mr Quatermain gives us no specimen of the Zu-Vendi\nwriting, but what he here states seems to go a long way towards\nsubstantiating the theory advanced in the note on p. 149.--Editor.\n\n\nEndnote 14\n\nThese are internal measurements.--A. Q.\n\n\nEndnote 15\n\nLight was also admitted by sliding shutters under the eaves of the dome\nand in the roof.--A. Q.\n\n\nEndnote 16\n\nThis line is interesting as being one of the few allusions to be found\nin the Zu-Vendi ritual to a vague divine essence independent of the\nmaterial splendour of the orb they worship. 'Taia', the word used\nhere, has a very indeterminate meaning, and signifies essence, vital\nprinciple, spirit, or even God.\n\n\nEndnote 17\n\nAlluding to the Zulu custom.--A.

Q.\n\n\nEndnote 21\n\nOf course, the roof of the Temple, being so high, caught the light some\ntime before the breaking of the dawn.--A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
