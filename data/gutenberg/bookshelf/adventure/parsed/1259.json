The Shade of Cardinal Richelieu.\n\n\nIn a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal, formerly styled the Palais\nCardinal, a man was sitting in deep reverie, his head supported on\nhis hands, leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with\nletters and papers. Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive\nwith leaping flames; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the\npolished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments\nof the lonely tenant of the room, which was illumined grandly by twin\ncandelabra rich with wax-lights.\n\nAny one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar--the\ngorgeous robe of office--and the rich lace, or who gazed on that\npale brow, bent in anxious meditation, might, in the solitude of that\napartment, combined with the silence of the ante-chambers and the\nmeasured paces of the guards upon the landing-place, have fancied that\nthe shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt.\n\nIt was, alas! the ghost of former greatness. France enfeebled, the\nauthority of her sovereign contemned, her nobles returning to their\nformer turbulence and insolence, her enemies within her frontiers--all\nproved the great Richelieu no longer in existence.\n\nIn truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his\nno longer, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which\nseemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a living\ncreature--from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts crowded\nwith guards--from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising from\nthe streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the room,\nwhich resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the\nminister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns\nfiring--let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to\nthe guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais\nRoyal, that the people were possessed of arms.\n\nThe shade of Richelieu was Mazarin. Now Mazarin was alone and\ndefenceless, as he well knew.\n\n\"Foreigner!\" he ejaculated, \"Italian! that is their mean yet mighty\nbyword of reproach--the watchword with which they assassinated, hanged,\nand made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would\nassassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although\nthey have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then.\nIdiots! ignorant of their real enemies, they do not perceive that it\nis not the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine\nthings to them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Mazarin continued, whilst his wonted smile, full of\nsubtlety, lent a strange expression to his pale lips; \"yes, these noises\nprove to me, indeed, that the destiny of favorites is precarious; but ye\nshall know I am no ordinary favorite. No! The Earl of Essex, 'tis\ntrue, wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him by his royal\nmistress, whilst I--I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold, with a\ncipher on it and a date; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of\nthe Palais Royal, * so they will never ruin me, as they long to do, and\nwhilst they shout, 'Down with Mazarin!' I, unknown, and unperceived by\nthem, incite them to cry out, 'Long live the Duke de Beaufort' one day;\nanother, 'Long live the Prince de Conde;' and again, 'Long live the\nparliament!'\" And at this word the smile on the cardinal's lips assumed\nan expression of hatred, of which his mild countenance seemed incapable.\n\"The parliament! We shall soon see how to dispose,\" he continued, \"of\nthe parliament! Both Orleans and Montargis are ours. It will be a work\nof time, but those who have begun by crying out: Down with Mazarin! will\nfinish by shouting out, Down with all the people I have mentioned, each\nin his turn.\n\n     * It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not\n     taken such vows as to prevent it, was secretly married to\n     Anne of Austria.--La Porte's Memoirs.\n\n\"Richelieu, whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise\nafter his death, was even less popular than I am. Often he was driven\naway, oftener still had he a dread of being sent away. The queen will\nnever banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she\nwould yield with me; if I fly, she will fly; and then we shall see how\nthe rebels will get on without either king or queen.\n\n\"Oh, were I not a foreigner! were I but a Frenchman! were I but of\ngentle birth!\"\n\nThe position of the cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had\nadded to his difficulties. Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks\nof society in France. Crushed and impoverished by taxation--imposed\nby Mazarin, whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very\ndust--the people, as the Advocate-General Talon described it, had\nnothing left to them except their souls; and as those could not be sold\nby auction, they began to murmur. Patience had in vain been recommended\nto them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels,\nhowever, were not meat and drink, and the people had for some time been\nin a state of discontent.\n\nHad this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for\nwhen the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated\nas it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the\nbourgeoisie, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily, Mazarin had\nhad the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than\ntwelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high price; and as\nthe officers of that court paid very dearly for their places, and as the\naddition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of\neach place, the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves,\nand, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their\nnumber, but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue; and\nshould any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance, to\ncombine to indemnify him for his loss.\n\nNow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending\nparties.\n\nOn the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had\nassembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house\nproperty. They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of\nOrleans, who, according to his custom, affected popularity. The duke\nreceived them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay\nthis tax, even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its\ncollectors by force of arms. They were listened to with great politeness\nby the duke, who held out hopes of easier measures, promised to speak\nin their behalf to the queen, and dismissed them with the ordinary\nexpression of royalty, \"We will see what we can do.\"\n\nTwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal\nand their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and\ndetermination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation\naway with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of\nOrleans--that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with\nthat intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent\nof finance was summoned.\n\nThis man, named Emery, was the object of popular detestation, in\nthe first place because he was superintendent of finance, and every\nsuperintendent of finance deserved to be hated; in the second place,\nbecause he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred.\n\nHe was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, who, after\nbecoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal\nRichelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had\nintroduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII. under\nhis assumed name, in order that he might be appointed to the post he\nsubsequently held.\n\n\"You surprise me!\" exclaimed the monarch. \"I am rejoiced to hear you\nspeak of Monsieur d'Emery as calculated for a post which requires a\nman of probity. I was really afraid that you were going to force that\nvillain Particelli upon me.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Richelieu, \"rest assured that Particelli, the man to\nwhom your majesty refers, has been hanged.\"\n\n\"Ah; so much the better!\" exclaimed the king. \"It is not for nothing\nthat I am styled Louis the Just.\" and he signed Emery's appointment.\n\nThis was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance.\n\nHe was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and\ntrembling, declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the\nday before, near the palace. The mob had insulted him on account of the\nostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung with red velvet\nedged with gold fringe. This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus,\nwho arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became secretary\nof state, and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of\nfrancs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for\nhimself.\n\nThe fact was that Emery's son had run a great chance of being\nsuffocated, one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he\ngave up all the gold he had swallowed. Nothing, therefore, was settled\nthat day, as Emery's head was not steady enough for business after such\nan occurrence.\n\nOn the next day Mathieu Mole, the chief president, whose courage at\nthis crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc\nde Beaufort and the Prince de Conde--in other words, of the two men who\nwere considered the bravest in France--had been attacked in his turn.\nThe people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that\nhung over them. But the chief president had replied with his habitual\ncoolness, without betraying either disturbance or surprise, that should\nthe agitators refuse obedience to the king's wishes he would have\ngallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the\nmost active among them. To which the others had responded that they\nwould be glad to see the gallows erected; they would serve for the\nhanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the\nprice of the people's misery.\n\nNor was this all. On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre\nDame, as she always did on Saturdays, was followed by more than two\nhundred women demanding justice. These poor creatures had no bad\nintentions. They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before\ntheir sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but they\nwere prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way,\nhaughtily disdainful of their entreaties.\n\nAt length parliament was convoked; the authority of the king was to be\nmaintained.\n\nOne day--it was the morning of the day my story begins--the king, Louis\nXIV., then ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning\nthanks for his recovery from the small-pox, to Notre Dame. He took\nthe opportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the\nmusketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the\nquays, and on the Pont Neuf. After mass the young monarch drove to the\nParliament House, where, upon the throne, he hastily confirmed not only\nsuch edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each\none, according to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others--a\nproceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief\npresident, Mole--whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel\nraised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.\n\nThe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais\nRoyal. All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, many of the people\nused threatening language.\n\nAt first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the king's visit to the\nparliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but\nscarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased,\nwhen cries of \"Down with Mazarin!\" \"Long live Broussel!\" \"Long live\nBlancmesnil!\" resounded through the city. For the people had learned\nthat Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf, and,\nalthough the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail, it\nhad none the less won for them the people's good-will. All attempts\nto disperse the groups collected in the streets, or silence their\nexclamations, were in vain. Orders had just been given to the royal\nguards and the Swiss guards, not only to stand firm, but to send out\npatrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where the people\nthronged and where they were the most vociferous, when the mayor of\nParis was announced at the Palais Royal.\n\nHe was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive\nprecautions were not discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under\narms.\n\nDeliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards, named\nComminges, made his appearance, with his clothes all torn, his face\nstreaming with blood. The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise\nand asked him what was going on.\n\nAs the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated\nthe mob. The tocsin was sounded. Comminges had arrested one of the\nringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du\nTrahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were\nattacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent\nhad escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house. They\nbroke open the doors and searched the dwelling, but in vain. Comminges,\nwounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead, had left a\npicket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal, followed by a\nmenacing crowd, to tell his story.\n\nThis account confirmed that of the mayor. The authorities were not in a\ncondition to cope with serious revolt. Mazarin endeavored to circulate\namong the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the\nquays and on the Pont Neuf, on account of the ceremonial of the day, and\nthat they would soon withdraw. In fact, about four o'clock they were\nall concentrated about the Palais Royal, the courts and ground floors\nof which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards, and there awaited\nthe outcome of all this disturbance.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our\nreaders to the study of Cardinal Mazarin--once that of Cardinal\nRichelieu. We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs\nfrom below, which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the guns,\nthe firing of which resounded through that room. All at once he raised\nhis head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed\na resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to\nstrike ten, and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the\ntable near him, he shrilled it twice.\n\nA door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black\nsilently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat.\n\n\"Bernouin,\" said the cardinal, not turning round, for having whistled,\nhe knew that it was his valet-de-chambre who was behind him; \"what\nmusketeers are now within the palace?\"\n\n\"The Black Musketeers, my lord.\"\n\n\"What company?\"\n\n\"Treville's company.\"\n\n\"Is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante-chamber?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"A man on whom we can depend, I hope.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on.\"\n\nThe valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few\nminutes bringing the dress demanded.\n\nThe cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take off the\nrobes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of\nparliament, and to attire himself in the military coat, which he wore\nwith a certain degree of easy grace, owing to his former campaigns in\nItaly. When he was completely dressed he said:\n\n\"Send hither Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\nThe valet went out of the room, this time by the centre door, but still\nas silently as before; one might have fancied him an apparition.\n\nWhen he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass\nwith a feeling of self-satisfaction. Still young--for he was scarcely\nforty-six years of age--he possessed great elegance of form and was\nabove the middle height; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful;\nhis glance full of expression; his nose, though large, was well\nproportioned; his forehead broad and majestic; his hair, of a chestnut\ncolor, was curled slightly; his beard, which was darker than his hair,\nwas turned carefully with a curling iron, a practice that greatly\nimproved it. After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt,\nthen looked with great complacency at his hands, which were most elegant\nand of which he took the greatest care; and throwing on one side the\nlarge kid gloves tried on at first, as belonging to the uniform, he put\non others of silk only. At this instant the door opened.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the valet-de-chambre.\n\nAn officer, as he spoke, entered the apartment. He was a man between\nthirty-nine and forty years of age, of medium height but a very well\nproportioned figure; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy; his\nbeard black, and his hair turning gray, as often happens when people\nhave found life either too gay or too sad, more especially when they\nhappen to be of swart complexion.\n\nD'Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment.\n\nHow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room!\nSeeing, however, no one there except a musketeer of his own troop, he\nfixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier, in whose dress, nevertheless,\nhe recognized at the first glance the cardinal.\n\nThe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture,\nsuch as became a man of good birth, who had in the course of his life\nbeen frequently in the society of the highest nobles.\n\nThe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance,\nyet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary\nsilence said:\n\n\"You are Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I am that individual,\" replied the officer.\n\nMazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence, the play\nof which had been, nevertheless, subdued by age and experience; and\nD'Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly\nsustained many a searching look, very different, indeed, from those\nwhich were inquiringly directed on him at that instant.\n\n\"Sir,\" resumed the cardinal, \"you are to come with me, or rather, I am\nto go with you.\"\n\n\"I am at your command, my lord,\" returned D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal;\ndo you suppose that there is any danger in so doing?\"\n\n\"Danger, my lord!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan with a look of astonishment,\n\"what danger?\"\n\n\"I am told that there is a general insurrection.\"\n\n\"The uniform of the king's musketeers carries a certain respect with it,\nand even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to\nput to flight a hundred of these clowns.\"\n\n\"Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers----\"\n\n\"Which means, I suppose, that the musketeers are better soldiers than\nthe guards.\" The cardinal smiled as he spoke.\n\n\"Every one likes his own uniform best, my lord.\"\n\n\"Myself excepted,\" and again Mazarin smiled; \"for you perceive that I\nhave left off mine and put on yours.\"\n\n\"Lord bless us! this is modesty indeed!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Had I such\na uniform as your eminence possesses, I protest I should be mightily\ncontent, and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume----\"\n\n\"Yes, but for to-night's adventure I don't suppose my dress would have\nbeen a very safe one. Give me my felt hat, Bernouin.\"\n\nThe valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide\nbrim. The cardinal put it on in military style.\n\n\"Your horses are ready saddled in their stables, are they not?\" he said,\nturning to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Well, let us set out.\"\n\n\"How many men does your eminence wish to escort you?\"\n\n\"You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low\nfellows; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred,\ntake eight----\"\n\n\"As many as my lord wishes.\"\n\n\"I will follow you. This way--light us downstairs Bernouin.\"\n\nThe valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key from his bureau\nand opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the\nPalais Royal.\n\n\n\n\n2. A Nightly Patrol.\n\n\n\nIn ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street \"Les\nBons Enfants\" behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the\nplay of \"Mirame,\" and in which Mazarin, who was an amateur of music, but\nnot of literature, had introduced into France the first opera that was\never acted in that country.\n\nThe appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation. Numberless\ngroups paraded the streets and, whatever D'Artagnan might think of it,\nit was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their\nusual forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect. From time to\ntime noises came in the direction of the public markets. The report\nof firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church\nbells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace.\nD'Artagnan, meantime, pursued his way with the indifference of a man\nupon whom such acts of folly made no impression. When he approached a\ngroup in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a\nword of warning; and the members of the group, whether rebels or not,\nas if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal, at once\ngave place to the patrol. The cardinal envied that composure, which\nhe attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none the less he\nconceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment\nplaced himself, that consideration which even prudence pays to careless\ncourage. On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens, the\nsentinel cried out, \"Who's there?\" and D'Artagnan answered--having\nfirst asked the word of the cardinal--\"Louis and Rocroy.\" After which he\ninquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the\noutpost. The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was\nconversing, on foot, his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the\nindividual to whom he was talking sat. Here was the officer D'Artagnan\nwas seeking.\n\n\"Here is Monsieur Comminges,\" said D'Artagnan, returning to the\ncardinal. He instantly retired, from a feeling of respectful delicacy;\nit was, however, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both\nComminges and the other officers on horseback.\n\n\"Well done, Guitant,\" cried the cardinal to the equestrian; \"I see\nplainly that, notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed over\nyour head, you are still the same man, active and zealous. What were you\nsaying to this youngster?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Guitant, \"I was observing that we live in troublous\ntimes and that to-day's events are very like those in the days of the\nLigue, of which I heard so much in my youth. Are you aware that the mob\nhave even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and\nthe Rue Saint Antoine?\"\n\n\"And what was Comminges saying to you in reply, my good Guitant?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Comminges, \"I answered that to compose a Ligue only one\ningredient was wanting--in my opinion an essential one--a Duc de Guise;\nmoreover, no generation ever does the same thing twice.\"\n\n\"No, but they mean to make a Fronde, as they call it,\" said Guitant.\n\n\"And what is a Fronde?\" inquired Mazarin.\n\n\"My lord, Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party.\"\n\n\"And what is the origin of this name?\"\n\n\"It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at\nthe palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys\nslinging--qui frondent--stones from the moats round Paris, young urchins\nwho run off the moment the constable appears, only to return to their\ndiversion the instant his back is turned. So they have picked up the\nword and the insurrectionists are called 'Frondeurs,' and yesterday\nevery article sold was 'a la Fronde;' bread 'a la Fronde,' hats 'a la\nFronde,' to say nothing of gloves, pocket-handkerchiefs, and fans; but\nlisten----\"\n\nAt that moment a window opened and a man began to sing:\n\n    \"A tempest from the Fronde\n    Did blow to-day:\n    I think 'twill blow\n    Sieur Mazarin away.\"\n\n\"Insolent wretch!\" cried Guitant.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Comminges, who, irritated by his wounds, wished for\nrevenge and longed to give back blow for blow, \"shall I fire off a ball\nto punish that jester, and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune\nin the future?\"\n\nAnd as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle's\nsaddle-bow.\n\n\"Certainly not! certainly not,\" exclaimed Mazarin. \"Diavolo! my dear\nfriend, you are going to spoil everything--everything is going on\nfamously. I know the French as well as if I had made them myself. They\nsing--let them pay the piper. During the Ligue, about which Guitant\nwas speaking just now, the people chanted nothing except the mass, so\neverything went to destruction. Come, Guitant, come along, and let's see\nif they keep watch at the Quinze-Vingts as at the Barriere des Sergens.\"\n\nAnd waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D'Artagnan, who instantly\nput himself at the head of his troop, followed by the cardinal, Guitant\nand the rest of the escort.\n\n\"Just so,\" muttered Comminges, looking after Mazarin. \"True, I forgot;\nprovided he can get money out of the people, that is all he wants.\"\n\nThe street of Saint Honore, when the cardinal and his party passed\nthrough it, was crowded by an assemblage who, standing in groups,\ndiscussed the edicts of that memorable day. They pitied the young king,\nwho was unconsciously ruining his country, and threw all the odium of\nhis proceedings on Mazarin. Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to\nConde were suggested. Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest\nfavor.\n\nD'Artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob\njust as if his horse and he had been made of iron. Mazarin and Guitant\nconversed together in whispers. The musketeers, who had already\ndiscovered who Mazarin was, followed in profound silence. In the street\nof Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by\nthe name of Quinze-Vingts. Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns,\nasking how matters were progressing.\n\n\"Ah, captain!\" said the officer, \"everything is quiet hereabout--if I\ndid not know that something is going on in yonder house!\"\n\nAnd he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon\nthe Vaudeville now stands.\n\n\"In that hotel? it is the Hotel Rambouillet,\" cried Guitant.\n\n\"I really don't know what hotel it is; all I do know is that I observed\nsome suspicious looking people go in there----\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Guitant, with a burst of laughter; \"those men must\nbe poets.\"\n\n\"Come, Guitant, speak, if you please, respectfully of these gentlemen,\"\nsaid Mazarin; \"don't you know that I was in my youth a poet? I wrote\nverses in the style of Benserade----\"\n\n\"You, my lord?\"\n\n\"Yes, I; shall I repeat to you some of my verses?\"\n\n\"Just as you please, my lord. I do not understand Italian.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you understand French,\" and Mazarin laid his hand upon\nGuitant's shoulder. \"My good, my brave Guitant, whatsoever command I may\ngive you in that language--in French--whatever I may order you to do,\nwill you not perform it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I have already answered that question in the affirmative;\nbut that command must come from the queen herself.\"\n\n\"Yes! ah yes!\" Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke; \"I know your devotion\nto her majesty.\"\n\n\"I have been a captain in the queen's guards for twenty years,\" was the\nreply.\n\n\"En route, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal; \"all goes well in\nthis direction.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, in the meantime, had taken the head of his detachment\nwithout a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks\nthe character of an old soldier.\n\nHe led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche. The Rue Richelieu and the\nRue Villedot were then, owing to their vicinity to the ramparts, less\nfrequented than any others in that direction, for the town was thinly\ninhabited thereabout.\n\n\"Who is in command here?\" asked the cardinal.\n\n\"Villequier,\" said Guitant.\n\n\"Diavolo! Speak to him yourself, for ever since you were deputed by\nme to arrest the Duc de Beaufort, this officer and I have been on bad\nterms. He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that, and I have told him a hundred times that he was\nwrong. The king could not give that order, since at that time he was\nhardly four years old.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I could give him the order--I, Guitant--and I preferred to\ngive it to you.\"\n\nGuitant, without reply, rode forward and desired the sentinel to call\nMonsieur de Villequier.\n\n\"Ah! so you are here!\" cried the officer, in the tone of ill-humor\nhabitual to him; \"what the devil are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I wish to know--can you tell me, pray--is anything fresh occurring in\nthis part of the town?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? People cry out, 'Long live the king! down with\nMazarin!' That's nothing new; no, we've been used to those acclamations\nfor some time.\"\n\n\"And you sing chorus,\" replied Guitant, laughing.\n\n\"Faith, I've half a mind to do it. In my opinion the people are right;\nand cheerfully would I give up five years of my pay--which I am never\npaid, by the way--to make the king five years older.\"\n\n\"Really! And pray what would come to pass, supposing the king were five\nyears older than he is?\"\n\n\"As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands\nhimself, and 'tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV. than\nthe son of Peter Mazarin. 'Sdeath! I would die willingly for the king,\nbut supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin, as your\nnephew came near being to-day, there could be nothing in Paradise,\nhowever well placed I might be there, that could console me for it.\"\n\n\"Well, well, Monsieur de Villequier,\" Mazarin interposed, \"I shall make\nit my care the king hears of your loyalty. Come, gentlemen,\" addressing\nthe troop, \"let us return.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" exclaimed Villequier, \"so Mazarin was here! so much the better.\nI have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him. I\nam obliged to you Guitant, although your intention was perhaps not very\nfavorable to me, for such an opportunity.\"\n\nHe turned away and went off to his post, whistling a tune then popular\namong the party called the \"Fronde,\" whilst Mazarin returned, in a\npensive mood, toward the Palais Royal. All that he had heard from these\nthree different men, Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, confirmed him in\nhis conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one\non his side except the queen; and then Anne of Austria had so often\ndeserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious. During\nthe whole of this nocturnal ride, during the whole time that he was\nendeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges, Guitant\nand Villequier, Mazarin was, in truth, studying more especially one\nman. This man, who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by\nthe mob--not a muscle of whose face was stirred, either at Mazarin's\nwitticisms or by the jests of the multitude--seemed to the cardinal a\npeculiar being, who, having participated in past events similar to\nthose now occurring, was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of\ntaking place.\n\nThe name of D'Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin, who, although\nhe did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635, that is to\nsay, about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in\na preceding narrative, * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of\none who was said to be a model of courage, address and loyalty.\n\n     * \"The Three Musketeers.\"\n\n\nPossessed by this idea, the cardinal resolved to know all about\nD'Artagnan immediately; of course he could not inquire from D'Artagnan\nhimself who he was and what had been his career; he remarked, however,\nin the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke\nwith a Gascon accent. Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much\nalike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them\nmay say of himself; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the\nPalais Royal, the cardinal knocked at a little door, and after thanking\nD'Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal,\nhe made a sign to Guitant to follow him.\n\nThey both dismounted, consigned their horses to the lackey who had\nopened the door, and disappeared in the garden.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said the cardinal, leaning, as they walked through\nthe garden, on his friend's arm, \"you told me just now that you had been\ntwenty years in the queen's service.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's true. I have,\" returned Guitant.\n\n\"Now, my dear Guitant, I have often remarked that in addition to your\ncourage, which is indisputable, and your fidelity, which is invincible,\nyou possess an admirable memory.\"\n\n\"You have found that out, have you, my lord? Deuce take it--all the\nworse for me!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a\ncourtier is to know when to forget.\"\n\n\"But you, Guitant, are not a courtier. You are a brave soldier, one of\nthe few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV. Alas! how few to-day\nexist!\"\n\n\"Plague on't, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out\nof me?\"\n\n\"No; I only brought you here to ask you,\" returned Mazarin, smiling, \"if\nyou have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan? I have had no occasion to notice him particularly;\nhe's an old acquaintance. He's a Gascon. De Treville knows him and\nesteems him very highly, and De Treville, as you know, is one of the\nqueen's greatest friends. As a soldier the man ranks well; he did his\nwhole duty and even more, at the siege of Rochelle--as at Suze and\nPerpignan.\"\n\n\"But you know, Guitant, we poor ministers often want men with other\nqualities besides courage; we want men of talent. Pray, was not Monsieur\nd'Artagnan, in the time of the cardinal, mixed up in some intrigue from\nwhich he came out, according to report, quite cleverly?\"\n\n\"My lord, as to the report you allude to\"--Guitant perceived that the\ncardinal wished to make him speak out--\"I know nothing but what the\npublic knows. I never meddle in intrigues, and if I occasionally become\na confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will\napprove of my keeping them secret.\"\n\nMazarin shook his head.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said; \"some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they\nwish to know.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Guitant, \"such ministers do not weigh men in the same\nbalance; they get their information on war from warriors; on intrigues,\nfrom intriguers. Consult some politician of the period of which you\nspeak, and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you\nwant.\"\n\n\"Eh, pardieu!\" said Mazarin, with a grimace which he always made when\nspoken to about money. \"They will be paid, if there is no way of getting\nout of it.\"\n\n\"Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the\ncabals of that day?\"\n\n\"By Bacchus!\" rejoined Mazarin, impatiently, \"it's about an hour since I\nasked you for that very thing, wooden-head that you are.\"\n\n\"There is one man for whom I can answer, if he will speak out.\"\n\n\"That's my concern; I will make him speak.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord, 'tis not easy to make people say what they don't wish to\nlet out.\"\n\n\"Pooh! with patience one must succeed. Well, this man. Who is he?\"\n\n\"The Comte de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"The Comte de Rochefort!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I don't\nknow where he is.\"\n\n\"I know, Guitant,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of\ninformation?\"\n\n\"You think,\" resumed Mazarin, \"that Rochefort----\"\n\n\"He was Cardinal Richelieu's creature, my lord. I warn you, however,\nhis services will cost you something. The cardinal was lavish to his\nunderlings.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Guitant,\" said Mazarin; \"Richelieu was a great man, a very\ngreat man, but he had that defect. Thanks, Guitant; I shall benefit by\nyour advice this very evening.\"\n\nHere they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the\nPalais Royal, Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down\nwithin that inclosure.\n\nIt was D'Artagnan, who was waiting for him.\n\n\"Come hither,\" said Mazarin in his softest voice; \"I have an order to\ngive you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase,\nsoon found himself in the study whence they had first set out.\n\nThe cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of\npaper wrote some lines upon it, whilst D'Artagnan stood imperturbable,\nwithout showing either impatience or curiosity. He was like a soldierly\nautomaton, or rather, like a magnificent marionette.\n\nThe cardinal folded and sealed his letter.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" he said, \"you are to take this dispatch to the\nBastile and bring back here the person it concerns. You must take a\ncarriage and an escort, and guard the prisoner with the greatest care.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took the letter, touched his hat with his hand, turned round\nupon his heel like a drill-sergeant, and a moment afterward was heard,\nin his dry and monotonous tone, commanding \"Four men and an escort, a\ncarriage and a horse.\" Five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage\nand the horses' shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the\ncourtyard.\n\n\n\n\n3. Dead Animosities.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past\neight. His visit was announced to the governor, who, on hearing that he\ncame from the cardinal, went to meet him and received him at the top of\nthe great flight of steps outside the door. The governor of the Bastile\nwas Monsieur du Tremblay, the brother of the famous Capuchin, Joseph,\nthat fearful favorite of Richelieu's, who went by the name of the Gray\nCardinal.\n\nDuring the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the\nBastile--where he remained for twelve long years--when his companions,\nin their dreams of liberty, said to each other: \"As for me, I shall go\nout of the prison at such a time,\" and another, at such and such a time,\nthe duke used to answer, \"As for me, gentlemen, I shall leave only when\nMonsieur du Tremblay leaves;\" meaning that at the death of the cardinal\nDu Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De\nBassompierre regain his at court.\n\nHis prediction was nearly fulfilled, but in a very different way from\nthat which De Bassompierre supposed; for after the death of Richelieu\neverything went on, contrary to expectation, in the same way as before;\nand Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison.\n\nMonsieur du Tremblay received D'Artagnan with extreme politeness and\ninvited him to sit down with him to supper, of which he was himself\nabout to partake.\n\n\"I should be delighted to do so,\" was the reply; \"but if I am not\nmistaken, the words 'In haste,' are written on the envelope of the\nletter which I brought.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Du Tremblay. \"Halloo, major! tell them to order\nNumber 25 to come downstairs.\"\n\nThe unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased, as he crossed the\nthreshold, to be a man--he became a number.\n\nD'Artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys; he remained on horseback,\nfeeling no inclination to dismount, and sat looking at the bars, at the\nbuttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from\nthe other side of the moat, but by which he had for twenty years been\nawe-struck.\n\nA bell resounded.\n\n\"I must leave you,\" said Du Tremblay; \"I am sent for to sign the release\nof a prisoner. I shall be happy to meet you again, sir.\"\n\n\"May the devil annihilate me if I return thy wish!\" murmured D'Artagnan,\nsmiling as he pronounced the imprecation; \"I declare I feel quite ill\nafter only being five minutes in the courtyard. Go to! go to! I would\nrather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of\nthe Bastile.\"\n\nHe had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived. On\nseeing him D'Artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.\nThe prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the\nmusketeer.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" thus D'Artagnan addressed the four musketeers, \"I am\nordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner,\nand since there are no locks to the carriage, I shall sit beside him.\nMonsieur de Lillebonne, lead my horse by the bridle, if you please.\" As\nhe spoke he dismounted, gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer\nand placing himself by the side of the prisoner said, in a voice\nperfectly composed, \"To the Palais Royal, at full trot.\"\n\nThe carriage drove on and D'Artagnan, availing himself of the darkness\nin the archway under which they were passing, threw himself into the\narms of the prisoner.\n\n\"Rochefort!\" he exclaimed; \"you! is it you, indeed? I am not mistaken?\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan!\" cried Rochefort.\n\n\"Ah! my poor friend!\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"not having seen you for four\nor five years I concluded you were dead.\"\n\n\"I'faith,\" said Rochefort, \"there's no great difference, I think,\nbetween a dead man and one who has been buried alive; now I have been\nburied alive, or very nearly so.\"\n\n\"And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to speak the truth?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Have you any suspicion of me, Rochefort?\"\n\n\"No! on the honor of a gentleman; but I cannot be imprisoned for the\nreason alleged; it is impossible.\"\n\n\"What reason?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"For stealing.\"\n\n\"For stealing! you, Rochefort! you are laughing at me.\"\n\n\"I understand. You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?\"\n\n\"I admit it.\"\n\n\"Well, this is what actually took place: One evening after an orgy\nin Reinard's apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc d'Harcourt,\nFontrailles, De Rieux and others, the Duc d'Harcourt proposed that\nwe should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf; that is, you know, a\ndiversion which the Duc d'Orleans made quite the fashion.\"\n\n\"Were you crazy, Rochefort? at your age!\"\n\n\"No, I was drunk. And yet, since the amusement seemed to me rather tame,\nI proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead\nof actors, and, in order to see to advantage, that we should mount\nthe bronze horse. No sooner said than done. Thanks to the spurs, which\nserved as stirrups, in a moment we were perched upon the croupe; we were\nwell placed and saw everything. Four or five cloaks had already been\nlifted, with a dexterity without parallel, and not one of the victims\nhad dared to say a word, when some fool of a fellow, less patient than\nthe others, took it into his head to cry out, 'Guard!' and drew upon\nus a patrol of archers. Duc d'Harcourt, Fontrailles, and the others\nescaped; De Rieux was inclined to do likewise, but I told him they\nwouldn't look for us where we were. He wouldn't listen, put his foot on\nthe spur to get down, the spur broke, he fell with a broken leg, and,\ninstead of keeping quiet, took to crying out like a gallows-bird. I then\nwas ready to dismount, but it was too late; I descended into the arms of\nthe archers. They conducted me to the Chatelet, where I slept soundly,\nbeing very sure that on the next day I should go forth free. The\nnext day came and passed, the day after, a week; I then wrote to the\ncardinal. The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile.\nThat was five years ago. Do you believe it was because I committed the\nsacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV.?\"\n\n\"No; you are right, my dear Rochefort, it couldn't be for that; but you\nwill probably learn the reason soon.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! I forgot to ask you--where are you taking me?\"\n\n\"To the cardinal.\"\n\n\"What does he want with me?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I did not even know that you were the person I was sent\nto fetch.\"\n\n\"Impossible--you--a favorite of the minister!\"\n\n\"A favorite! no, indeed!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Ah, my poor friend! I am\njust as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung, twenty-two years ago,\nyou know; alas!\" and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh.\n\n\"Nevertheless, you come as one in authority.\"\n\n\"Because I happened to be in the ante-chamber when the cardinal called\nme, by the merest chance. I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and\nhave been so these twenty years.\"\n\n\"Then no misfortune has happened to you?\"\n\n\"And what misfortune could happen to me? To quote some Latin verses I\nhave forgotten, or rather, never knew well, 'the thunderbolt never falls\non the valleys,' and I am a valley, dear Rochefort,--one of the lowliest\nof the low.\"\n\n\"Then Mazarin is still Mazarin?\"\n\n\"The same as ever, my friend; it is said that he is married to the\nqueen.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"If not her husband, he is unquestionably her lover.\"\n\n\"You surprise me. Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin!\"\n\n\"Just like the women,\" replied D'Artagnan, coolly.\n\n\"Like women, not like queens.\"\n\n\"Egad! queens are the weakest of their sex, when it comes to such things\nas these.\"\n\n\"And M. de Beaufort--is he still in prison?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, but that he might get me out of this, if he were favorably\ninclined to me.\"\n\n\"You are probably nearer freedom than he is, so it will be your business\nto get him out.\"\n\n\"And,\" said the prisoner, \"what talk is there of war with Spain?\"\n\n\"With Spain, no,\" answered D'Artagnan; \"but Paris.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Rochefort.\n\n\"Do you hear the guns, pray? The citizens are amusing themselves in the\nmeantime.\"\n\n\"And you--do you really think that anything could be done with these\nbourgeois?\"\n\n\"Yes, they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one\nbody.\"\n\n\"How miserable not to be free!\"\n\n\"Don't be downcast. Since Mazarin has sent for you, it is because he\nwants you. I congratulate you! Many a long year has passed since any one\nhas wanted to employ me; so you see in what a situation I am.\"\n\n\"Make your complaints known; that's my advice.\"\n\n\"Listen, Rochefort; let us make a compact. We are friends, are we not?\"\n\n\"Egad! I bear the traces of our friendship--three slits or slashes from\nyour sword.\"\n\n\"Well, if you should be restored to favor, don't forget me.\"\n\n\"On the honor of a Rochefort; but you must do the like for me.\"\n\n\"There's my hand,--I promise.\"\n\n\"Therefore, whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my\nbehalf----\"\n\n\"I shall say it, and you?\"\n\n\"I shall do the same.\"\n\n\"Apropos, are we to speak of your friends also, Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis? or have you forgotten them?\"\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\n\"What has become of them?\"\n\n\"I don't know; we separated, as you know. They are alive, that's all\nthat I can say about them; from time to time I hear of them indirectly,\nbut in what part of the world they are, devil take me if I know, No, on\nmy honor, I have not a friend in the world but you, Rochefort.\"\n\n\"And the illustrious--what's the name of the lad whom I made a sergeant\nin Piedmont's regiment?\"\n\n\"Planchet!\"\n\n\"The illustrious Planchet. What has become of him?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very\nmoment. He married a woman who keeps a confectioner's shop in the Rue\ndes Lombards, for he's a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats; he's now\na citizen of Paris. You'll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff\nbefore I shall be a captain.\"\n\n\"Come, dear D'Artagnan, look up a little! Courage! It is when one\nis lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry-go-round wheels and\nrewards us. This evening your destiny begins to change.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, stopping the carriage.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Rochefort.\n\n\"We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting out of your\ncarriage; we are supposed not to know each other.\"\n\n\"You are right. Adieu.\"\n\n\"Au revoir. Remember your promise.\"\n\nIn five minutes the party entered the courtyard and D'Artagnan led\nthe prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and\nante-chamber.\n\nAs they stopped at the door of the cardinal's study, D'Artagnan was\nabout to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder.\n\n\"D'Artagnan, let me confess to you what I've been thinking about during\nthe whole of my drive, as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who\nperpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with\nfiery eyes.\"\n\n\"Speak out,\" answered D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I had only to cry out 'Help!' for you and for your companions to be cut\nto pieces, and then I should have been free.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you do it?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"Come, come!\" cried Rochefort. \"Did we not swear friendship? Ah! had any\none but you been there, I don't say----\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed. \"Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man\nthan I am?\" he said to himself. And he caused himself to be announced to\nthe minister.\n\n\"Let M. de Rochefort enter,\" said Mazarin, eagerly, on hearing their\nnames pronounced; \"and beg M. d'Artagnan to wait; I shall have further\nneed of him.\"\n\nThese words gave great joy to D'Artagnan. As he had said, it had been a\nlong time since any one had needed him; and that demand for his services\non the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign.\n\nRochefort, rendered suspicious and cautious by these words, entered the\napartment, where he found Mazarin sitting at the table, dressed in his\nordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church, his costume\nbeing similar to that of the abbes in that day, excepting that his scarf\nand stockings were violet.\n\nAs the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin, which was\nanswered by one, equally furtive, from the minister.\n\nThere was little change in the cardinal; still dressed with sedulous\ncare, his hair well arranged and curled, his person perfumed, he looked,\nowing to his extreme taste in dress, only half his age. But Rochefort,\nwho had passed five years in prison, had become old in the lapse of\na few years; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct\nCardinal Richelieu were now white; the deep bronze of his complexion had\nbeen succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility. As he gazed\nat him Mazarin shook his head slightly, as much as to say, \"This is a\nman who does not appear to me fit for much.\"\n\nAfter a pause, which appeared an age to Rochefort, Mazarin took from a\nbundle of papers a letter, and showing it to the count, he said:\n\n\"I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty, Monsieur de\nRochefort. You are in prison, then?\"\n\nRochefort trembled in every limb at this question. \"But I thought,\"\nhe said, \"that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any\none----\"\n\n\"I? Oh no! There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile, who were\ncooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu; I don't even know their\nnames.\"\n\n\"Yes, but in regard to myself, my lord, it cannot be so, for I was\nremoved from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your\neminence.\"\n\n\"You think you were.\"\n\n\"I am certain of it.\"\n\n\"Ah, stay! I fancy I remember it. Did you not once refuse to undertake a\njourney to Brussels for the queen?\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" exclaimed Rochefort. \"There is the true reason! Idiot that\nI am, though I have been trying to find it out for five years, I never\nfound it out.\"\n\n\"But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment. I merely ask\nyou, did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen, whilst you had\nconsented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal?\"\n\n\"That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels. I was there\nat a fearful moment. I was sent there to intercept a correspondence\nbetween Chalais and the archduke, and even then, when I was discovered\nI was nearly torn to pieces. How could I, then, return to Brussels? I\nshould injure the queen instead of serving her.\"\n\n\"Well, since the best motives are liable to misconstruction, the queen\nsaw in your refusal nothing but a refusal--a distinct refusal she had\nalso much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal;\nyes, her majesty the queen----\"\n\nRochefort smiled contemptuously.\n\n\"Since I was a faithful servant, my lord, to Cardinal Richelieu during\nhis life, it stands to reason that now, after his death, I should serve\nyou well, in defiance of the whole world.\"\n\n\"With regard to myself, Monsieur de Rochefort,\" replied Mazarin, \"I am\nnot, like Monsieur de Richelieu, all-powerful. I am but a minister, who\nwants no servants, being myself nothing but a servant of the queen's.\nNow, the queen is of a sensitive nature. Hearing of your refusal to obey\nher she looked upon it as a declaration of war, and as she considers you\na man of superior talent, and consequently dangerous, she desired me\nto make sure of you; that is the reason of your being shut up in the\nBastile. But your release can be managed. You are one of those men who\ncan comprehend certain matters and having understood them, can act with\nenergy----\"\n\n\"Such was Cardinal Richelieu's opinion, my lord.\"\n\n\"The cardinal,\" interrupted Mazarin, \"was a great politician and therein\nshone his vast superiority over me. I am a straightforward, simple man;\nthat's my great disadvantage. I am of a frankness of character quite\nFrench.\"\n\nRochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile.\n\n\"Now to the point. I want friends; I want faithful servants. When I\nsay I want, I mean the queen wants them. I do nothing without her\ncommands--pray understand that; not like Monsieur de Richelieu, who went\non just as he pleased. So I shall never be a great man, as he was, but\nto compensate for that, I shall be a good man, Monsieur de Rochefort,\nand I hope to prove it to you.\"\n\nRochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice, in which sounded\nsometimes a sort of gentle lisp, like the hissing of young vipers.\n\n\"I am disposed to believe your eminence,\" he replied; \"though I have had\nbut little evidence of that good-nature of which your eminence speaks.\nDo not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no\nmedium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison.\"\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur de Rochefort! have I not told you already that I had\nnothing to do with that? The queen--cannot you make allowances for\nthe pettishness of a queen and a princess? But that has passed away as\nsuddenly as it came, and is forgotten.\"\n\n\"I can easily suppose, sir, that her majesty has forgotten it amid the\nfetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal, but I who have passed those\nyears in the Bastile----\"\n\n\"Ah! mon Dieu! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort! do you absolutely think\nthat the Palais Royal is the abode of gayety? No. We have had great\nannoyances there. As for me, I play my game squarely, fairly, and above\nboard, as I always do. Let us come to some conclusion. Are you one of\nus, Monsieur de Rochefort?\"\n\n\"I am very desirous of being so, my lord, but I am totally in the dark\nabout everything. In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers\nand jailers, and you have not an idea, my lord, how little is known\nof what is going on by people of that sort; I am of Monsieur de\nBassompierre's party. Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France?\"\n\n\"He is dead, sir; a great loss. His devotion to the queen was boundless;\nmen of loyalty are scarce.\"\n\n\"I think so, forsooth,\" said Rochefort, \"and when you find any of them,\nyou march them off to the Bastile. However, there are plenty in the\nworld, but you don't look in the right direction for them, my lord.\"\n\n\"Indeed! explain to me. Ah! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, how much you\nmust have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal! Ah! he\nwas a great man.\"\n\n\"Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?\"\n\n\"I! never! you know you may say anything to me. I try to be beloved, not\nfeared.\"\n\n\"Well, there is on the wall of my cell, scratched with a nail, a\nproverb, which says, 'Like master, like servant.'\"\n\n\"Pray, what does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants,\ndozens and dozens of them.\"\n\n\"He! the point aimed at by every poniard! Richelieu, who passed his life\nin warding off blows which were forever aimed at him!\"\n\n\"But he did ward them off,\" said De Rochefort, \"and the reason was,\nthat though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends. I have\nknown persons,\" he continued--for he thought he might avail himself of\nthe opportunity of speaking of D'Artagnan--\"who by their sagacity and\naddress have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu; who by\ntheir valor have got the better of his guards and spies; persons without\nmoney, without support, without credit, yet who have preserved to the\ncrowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon.\"\n\n\"But those men you speak of,\" said Mazarin, smiling inwardly on seeing\nRochefort approach the point to which he was leading him, \"those men\nwere not devoted to the cardinal, for they contended against him.\"\n\n\"No; in that case they would have met with more fitting reward. They had\nthe misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you\nwere seeking servants.\"\n\n\"But how is it that you know so much of these matters?\"\n\n\"I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my\nenemies; because they fought against me; because I did them all the harm\nI could and they returned it to the best of their ability; because one\nof them, with whom I had most to do, gave me a pretty sword-thrust, now\nabout seven years ago, the third that I received from the same hand; it\nclosed an old account.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mazarin, with admirable suavity, \"could I but find such men!\"\n\n\"My lord, there has stood for six years at your very door a man such\nas I describe, and during those six years he has been unappreciated and\nunemployed by you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"It is Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"That Gascon!\" cried Mazarin, with well acted surprise.\n\n\"'That Gascon' has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess\nthat in point of talent, address and political skill, to him he was only\na tyro.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency.\"\n\n\"Tell me a little about it, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"That is somewhat difficult, my lord,\" said Rochefort, with a smile.\n\n\"Then he will tell it me himself.\"\n\n\"I doubt it, my lord.\"\n\n\"Why do you doubt it?\"\n\n\"Because the secret does not belong to him; because, as I have told you,\nit has to do with a great queen.\"\n\n\"And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?\"\n\n\"No, my lord, he had three colleagues, three brave men, men such as you\nwere wishing for just now.\"\n\n\"And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really\nunited?\"\n\n\"As if they had been one man--as if their four hearts had pulsated in\none breast.\"\n\n\"You pique my curiosity, dear Rochefort; pray tell me the whole story.\"\n\n\"That is impossible; but I will tell you a true story, my lord.\"\n\n\"Pray do so, I delight in stories,\" cried the cardinal.\n\n\"Listen, then,\" returned Rochefort, as he spoke endeavoring to read in\nthat subtle countenance the cardinal's motive. \"Once upon a time there\nlived a queen--a powerful monarch--who reigned over one of the greatest\nkingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much\nto injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well. (Do not try, my\nlord, you cannot guess who it is; all this happened long before you came\ninto the country where this queen reigned.) There came to the court an\nambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost\nher heart to him; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him\ncertain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like\nthem.\n\n\"As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his\nmajesty to insist upon the queen's appearing in them as part of her\njewels at a ball which was soon to take place. There is no occasion\nto tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for a fact that these\nornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away,\nbeyond seas. This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her\nsubjects--fallen from her high estate.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, four men resolved to save her. These four men were not\nprinces, neither were they dukes, neither were they men in power; they\nwere not even rich. They were four honest soldiers, each with a good\nheart, a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it.\nThey set out. The minister knew of their departure and had planted\npeople on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination.\nThree of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants; one\nof them alone arrived at the port, having either killed or wounded those\nwho wished to stop him. He crossed the sea and brought back the set of\nornaments to the great queen, who was able to wear them on her shoulder\non the appointed day; and this very nearly ruined the minister. What do\nyou think of that exploit, my lord?\"\n\n\"It is magnificent!\" said Mazarin, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well, I know of ten such men.\"\n\nMazarin made no reply; he reflected.\n\nFive or six minutes elapsed.\n\n\"You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?\" said Rochefort.\n\n\"Yes. And you say that Monsieur d'Artagnan was one of those four men?\"\n\n\"He led the enterprise.\"\n\n\"And who were the others?\"\n\n\"I leave it to Monsieur d'Artagnan to name them, my lord. They were his\nfriends and not mine. He alone would have any influence with them; I do\nnot even know them under their true names.\"\n\n\"You suspect me, Monsieur de Rochefort; I want him and you and all to\naid me.\"\n\n\"Begin with me, my lord; for after five or six years of imprisonment it\nis natural to feel some curiosity as to one's destination.\"\n\n\"You, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, shall have the post of confidence;\nyou shall go to Vincennes, where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined; you\nwill guard him well for me. Well, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible,\" said\nRochefort, shaking his head with an air of disappointment.\n\n\"What! impossible? And why is it impossible?\"\n\n\"Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends, or rather, I am one\nof his. Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me\nto the queen?\"\n\n\"Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State.\"\n\n\"That may be, my lord; but since I am neither king nor queen nor\nminister, he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your offer.\"\n\n\"This, then, is what you call devotion! I congratulate you. Your\ndevotion does not commit you too far, Monsieur de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"And then, my lord,\" continued Rochefort, \"you understand that to emerge\nfrom the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change one's\nprison.\"\n\n\"Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort; that will\nbe the most sincere line of conduct,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"My lord, I have been so long shut up, that I am only of one party--I am\nfor fresh air. Employ me in any other way; employ me even actively, but\nlet it be on the high roads.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur de Rochefort,\" Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery,\n\"you think yourself still a young man; your spirit is that of the\nphoenix, but your strength fails you. Believe me, you ought now to take\na rest. Here!\"\n\n\"You decide, then, nothing about me, my lord?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I have come to a decision.\"\n\nBernouin came into the room.\n\n\"Call an officer of justice,\" he said; \"and stay close to me,\" he added,\nin a low tone.\n\nThe officer entered. Mazarin wrote a few words, which he gave to this\nman; then he bowed.\n\n\"Adieu, Monsieur de Rochefort,\" he said.\n\nRochefort bent low.\n\n\"I see, my lord, I am to be taken back to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"You are sagacious.\"\n\n\"I shall return thither, my lord, but it is a mistake on your part not\nto employ me.\"\n\n\"You? the friend of my greatest foes? Don't suppose that you are the\nonly person who can serve me, Monsieur de Rochefort. I shall find many\nmen as able as you are.\"\n\n\"I wish you may, my lord,\" replied De Rochefort.\n\nHe was then reconducted by the little staircase, instead of passing\nthrough the ante-chamber where D'Artagnan was waiting. In the courtyard\nthe carriage and the four musketeers were ready, but he looked around in\nvain for his friend.\n\n\"Ah!\" he muttered to himself, \"this changes the situation, and if there\nis still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin\nthat we are still, thank God, good for something else than keeping guard\nover a prisoner;\" and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a\nman of five-and-twenty.\n\n\n\n\n4. Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.\n\n\n\nWhen left alone with Bernouin, Mazarin was for some minutes lost in\nthought. He had gained much information, but not enough. Mazarin was a\ncheat at the card-table. This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne. He\ncalled it using his advantages. He now determined not to begin the game\nwith D'Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary's cards.\n\n\"My lord, have you any commands?\" asked Bernouin.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Mazarin. \"Light me; I am going to the queen.\"\n\nBernouin took up a candlestick and led the way.\n\nThere was a secret communication between the cardinal's apartments and\nthose of the queen; and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever\nhe wished to visit Anne of Austria.\n\n\n\n*This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal.\n\n\n\nIn the bedroom in which this passage ended, Bernouin encountered\nMadame de Beauvais, like himself intrusted with the secret of these\nsubterranean love affairs; and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare\nAnne of Austria, who was in her oratory with the young king, Louis XIV.,\nto receive the cardinal.\n\nAnne, reclining in a large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand,\nher elbow resting on a table, was looking at her son, who was turning\nover the leaves of a large book filled with pictures. This celebrated\nwoman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity. It was her\npractice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room, without\neither reading or praying.\n\nWhen Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal,\nthe child, who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius,\nenlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander's feats of arms,\nfrowned and looked at his mother.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"does he enter without first asking for an audience?\"\n\nAnne colored slightly.\n\n\"The prime minister,\" she said, \"is obliged in these unsettled days to\ninform the queen of all that is happening from time to time, without\nexciting the curiosity or remarks of the court.\"\n\n\"But Richelieu never came in this manner,\" said the pertinacious boy.\n\n\"How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did? You were too young\nto know about such things.\"\n\n\"I do not remember what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told\nall about it.\"\n\n\"And who told you about it?\" asked Anne of Austria, with a movement of\nimpatience.\n\n\"I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions,\"\nanswered the child, \"for if I do I shall learn nothing further.\"\n\nAt this very moment Mazarin entered. The king rose immediately, took\nhis book, closed it and went to lay it down on the table, near which\nhe continued standing, in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand\nalso.\n\nMazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance. They\nexplained what had occurred that evening.\n\nHe bowed respectfully to the king, who gave him a somewhat cavalier\nreception, but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which,\nfrom his infancy, Louis XIV. had entertained toward Mazarin, and he\nendeavored to receive the minister's homage with civility.\n\nAnne of Austria sought to read in Mazarin's face the occasion of this\nunexpected visit, since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only\nafter every one had retired.\n\nThe minister made a slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said\nto Madame Beauvais:\n\n\"It is time for the king to go to bed; call Laporte.\"\n\nThe queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to\nbed, and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where\nhe was; but now he made no reply, but turned pale and bit his lips with\nanger.\n\nIn a few minutes Laporte came into the room. The child went directly to\nhim without kissing his mother.\n\n\"Well, Louis,\" said Anne, \"why do you not kiss me?\"\n\n\"I thought you were angry with me, madame; you sent me away.\"\n\n\"I do not send you away, but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid\nthat sitting up late may tire you.\"\n\n\"You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the\npalace to-day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to\nrebellion.\"\n\n\"Sire!\" interposed Laporte, in order to turn the subject, \"to whom does\nyour majesty wish me to give the candle?\"\n\n\"To any one, Laporte,\" the child said; and then added in a loud voice,\n\"to any one except Mancini.\"\n\nNow Mancini was a nephew of Mazarin's and was as much hated by Louis as\nthe cardinal himself, although placed near his person by the minister.\n\nAnd the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or\neven bowing to the cardinal.\n\n\"Good,\" said Mazarin, \"I am glad to see that his majesty has been\nbrought up with a hatred of dissimulation.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" asked the queen, almost timidly.\n\n\"Why, it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no\nexplanation. Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little\naffection he has for me. That, however, does not hinder me from being\nentirely devoted to his service, as I am to that of your majesty.\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon for him, cardinal,\" said the queen; \"he is a child,\nnot yet able to understand his obligations to you.\"\n\nThe cardinal smiled.\n\n\"But,\" continued the queen, \"you have doubtless come for some important\npurpose. What is it, then?\"\n\nMazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his\ncountenance.\n\n\"It is likely,\" he replied, \"that we shall soon be obliged to separate,\nunless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy.\"\n\n\"Why,\" cried the queen; \"how is that?\"\n\n\"Because, as they say in the opera of 'Thisbe,' 'The whole world\nconspires to break our bonds.'\"\n\n\"You jest, sir!\" answered the queen, endeavoring to assume something of\nher former dignity.\n\n\"Alas! I do not, madame,\" rejoined Mazarin. \"Mark well what I say. The\nwhole world conspires to break our bonds. Now as you are one of the\nwhole world, I mean to say that you also are deserting me.\"\n\n\"Cardinal!\"\n\n\"Heavens! did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans?\nor rather at what he said?\"\n\n\"And what was he saying?\"\n\n\"He said this, madame: 'Mazarin is a stumbling-block. Send him away and\nall will then be well.'\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, madame! you are the queen!\"\n\n\"Queen, forsooth! when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the\nPalais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense, or of every country\nsquire in the kingdom.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, you have still the power of banishing from your presence\nthose whom you do not like!\"\n\n\"That is to say, whom you do not like,\" returned the queen.\n\n\"I! persons whom I do not like!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been\npersecuted twelve years under the last reign?\"\n\n\"A woman of intrigue, who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of\ncabal she had raised against M. de Richelieu.\"\n\n\"Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort, that friend so loyal that she\nrefused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine?\"\n\n\"A prude, who told you every night, as she undressed you, that it was a\nsin to love a priest, just as if one were a priest because one happens\nto be a cardinal.\"\n\n\"Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested?\"\n\n\"An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate\nme.\"\n\n\"You see, cardinal,\" replied the queen, \"that your enemies are mine.\"\n\n\"That is not enough madame, it is necessary that your friends should be\nalso mine.\"\n\n\"My friends, monsieur?\" The queen shook her head. \"Alas, I have them no\nlonger!\"\n\n\"How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many\nin adversity?\"\n\n\"It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends, monsieur;\nbecause I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis, who, returning from\nher first exile, treated with contempt all those who had suffered for\nher and, being proscribed a second time, died at Cologne abandoned by\nevery one, even by her own son.\"\n\n\"Well, let us see,\" said Mazarin; \"isn't there still time to repair the\nevil? Search among your friends, your oldest friends.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Nothing else than I say--search.\"\n\n\"Alas, I look around me in vain! I have no influence with any one.\nMonsieur is, as usual, led by his favorite; yesterday it was Choisy,\nto-day it is La Riviere, to-morrow it will be some one else. Monsieur le\nPrince is led by the coadjutor, who is led by Madame de Guemenee.\"\n\n\"Therefore, madame, I ask you to look, not among your friends of to-day,\nbut among those of other times.\"\n\n\"Among my friends of other times?\" said the queen.\n\n\"Yes, among your friends of other times; among those who aided you to\ncontend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him.\"\n\n\"What is he aiming at?\" murmured the queen, looking uneasily at the\ncardinal.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued his eminence; \"under certain circumstances, with that\nstrong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses, aided by your friends,\nyou were able to repel the attacks of that adversary.\"\n\n\"I!\" said the queen. \"I suffered, that is all.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" said Mazarin, \"as women suffer in avenging themselves. Come, let\nus come to the point. Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort?\"\n\n\"One of my bitterest enemies--the faithful friend of Cardinal\nRichelieu.\"\n\n\"I know that, and we sent him to the Bastile,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Is he at liberty?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"No; still there, but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce\nthe name of another man. Do you know Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" he added,\nlooking steadfastly at the queen.\n\nAnne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart.\n\n\"Has the Gascon been indiscreet?\" she murmured to herself, then said\naloud:\n\n\"D'Artagnan! stop an instant, the name seems certainly familiar.\nD'Artagnan! there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women.\nPoor young creature! she was poisoned on my account.\"\n\n\"That's all you know of him?\" asked Mazarin.\n\nThe queen looked at him, surprised.\n\n\"You seem, sir,\" she remarked, \"to be making me undergo a course of\ncross-examination.\"\n\n\"Which you answer according to your fancy,\" replied Mazarin.\n\n\"Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them.\"\n\nThe queen spoke with some impatience.\n\n\"Well, madame,\" said Mazarin, bowing, \"I desire that you give me a\nshare in your friends, as I have shared with you the little industry and\ntalent that Heaven has given me. The circumstances are grave and it will\nbe necessary to act promptly.\"\n\n\"Still!\" said the queen. \"I thought that we were finally quit of\nMonsieur de Beaufort.\"\n\n\"Yes, you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything\nand you gave no attention to the still water. There is, however, a\nproverb current in France relating to water which is quiet.\"\n\n\"Continue,\" said the queen.\n\n\"Well, then, madame, not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts\nfrom your princes and your lordly servants, all of them automata who do\nnot perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move, nor do they\nsee that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured,\nirritated man, who has sworn to himself to master them one of these\ndays. We have arrested Monsieur de Beaufort, but he is the least\ndangerous among them. There is the Prince de Conde----\"\n\n\"The hero of Rocroy. Do you think of him?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, often and often, but pazienza, as we say in Italy; next,\nafter Monsieur de Conde, comes the Duke of Orleans.\"\n\n\"What are you saying? The first prince of the blood, the king's uncle!\"\n\n\"No! not the first prince of the blood, not the king's uncle, but the\nbase conspirator, the soul of every cabal, who pretends to lead the\nbrave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of\nthe blood--not the prince nearest to the throne, not the king's uncle,\nI repeat, but the murderer of Chalais, of Montmorency and of Cinq-Mars,\nwho is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that\nhe will win the game because he has a new adversary--instead of a man\nwho threatened, a man who smiles. But he is mistaken; I shall not\nleave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased\ncardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling\npoint.\"\n\nAnne blushed and buried her face in her hands.\n\n\"What am I to do?\" she said, bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant.\n\n\"Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed\nthe Channel, in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu, tracking the roads along\nwhich they passed by their blood, to bring back to your majesty certain\njewels given by you to Buckingham.\"\n\nAnne arose, full of majesty, and as if touched by a spring, and looking\nat the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth\nhad made her so powerful: \"You are insulting me!\" she said.\n\n\"I wish,\" continued Mazarin, finishing, as it were, the speech this\nsudden movement of the queen had cut; \"I wish, in fact, that you should\nnow do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover.\"\n\n\"Again that accusation!\" cried the queen. \"I thought that calumny was\nstifled or extinct; you have spared me till now, but since you speak of\nit, once for all, I tell you----\"\n\n\"Madame, I do not ask you to tell me,\" said Mazarin, astounded by this\nreturning courage.\n\n\"I will tell you all,\" replied Anne. \"Listen: there were in truth,\nat that epoch, four devoted hearts, four loyal spirits, four faithful\nswords, who saved more than my life--my honor----\"\n\n\"Ah! you confess it!\" exclaimed Mazarin.\n\n\"Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others, sir? and\ncannot women be dishonored by appearances? Yes, appearances were against\nme and I was about to suffer dishonor. However, I swear I was not\nguilty, I swear it by----\"\n\nThe queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could\nswear, and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry, a small\ncoffer of rosewood set in silver, and laying it on the altar:\n\n\"I swear,\" she said, \"by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my\nlover.\"\n\n\"What relics are those by which you swear?\" asked Mazarin, smiling. \"I\nam incredulous.\"\n\nThe queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung\nthere, and presented it to the cardinal.\n\n\"Open, sir,\" she said, \"and look for yourself.\"\n\nMazarin opened the coffer; a knife, covered with rust, and two letters,\none of which was stained with blood, alone met his gaze.\n\n\"What are these things?\" he asked.\n\n\"What are these things?\" replied Anne, with queen-like dignity,\nextending toward the open coffer an arm, despite the lapse of years,\nstill beautiful. \"These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to\nhim. This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed him. Read the\nletters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth.\"\n\nBut Mazarin, notwithstanding this permission, instead of reading the\nletters, took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of\nthe wound and sent by Laporte to the queen. The blade was red, for the\nblood had become rust; after a momentary examination during which the\nqueen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she\nwas leaning, he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder.\n\n\"It is well, madame, I believe your oath.\"\n\n\"No, no, read,\" exclaimed the queen, indignantly; \"read, I command you,\nfor I am resolved that everything shall be finished to-night and never\nwill I recur to this subject again. Do you think,\" she said, with a\nghastly smile, \"that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer\nany future accusations?\"\n\nMazarin, overcome by this determination, read the two letters. In one\nthe queen asked for the ornaments back again. This letter had been\nconveyed by D'Artagnan and had arrived in time. The other was that which\nLaporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, warning him\nthat he was about to be assassinated; that communication had arrived too\nlate.\n\n\"It is well, madame,\" said Mazarin; \"nothing can gainsay such\ntestimony.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the queen, closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon\nit, \"if there is anything to be said, it is that I have always been\nungrateful to the brave men who saved me--that I have given nothing to\nthat gallant officer, D'Artagnan, you were speaking of just now, but my\nhand to kiss and this diamond.\"\n\nAs she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed\nhim a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger.\n\n\"It appears,\" she resumed, \"that he sold it---he sold it in order to\nsave me another time--to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn\nhim of his danger--he sold it to Monsieur des Essarts, on whose finger I\nremarked it. I bought it from him, but it belongs to D'Artagnan. Give\nit back to him, sir, and since you have such a man in your service, make\nhim useful.\"\n\n\"Thank you, madame,\" said Mazarin. \"I will profit by the advice.\"\n\n\"And now,\" added the queen, her voice broken by her emotion, \"have you\nany other question to ask me?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\"--the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner--\"except\nto beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions. I love you so tenderly\nthat I cannot help being jealous, even of the past.\"\n\nA smile, which was indefinable, passed over the lips of the queen.\n\n\"Since you have no further interrogations to make, leave me, I beseech\nyou,\" she said. \"I wish, after such a scene, to be alone.\"\n\nMazarin bent low before her.\n\n\"I will retire, madame. Do you permit me to return?\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow.\"\n\nThe cardinal took the queen's hand and pressed it with an air of\ngallantry to his lips.\n\nScarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son's room, and\ninquired from Laporte if the king was in bed. Laporte pointed to the\nchild, who was asleep.\n\nAnne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid\nforehead of her son; then she retired as silently as she had come,\nmerely saying to Laporte:\n\n\"Try, my dear Laporte, to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le\nCardinal, to whom both he and I are under such important obligations.\"\n\n\n\n\n5. The Gascon and the Italian.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room; and after asking\nBernouin, who stood at the door, whether anything had occurred during\nhis absence, and being answered in the negative, he desired that he\nmight be left alone.\n\nWhen he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of\nthe ante-chamber. There D'Artagnan was asleep upon a bench.\n\nThe cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder. D'Artagnan\nstarted, awakened himself, and as he awoke, stood up exactly like a\nsoldier under arms.\n\n\"Here I am,\" said he. \"Who calls me?\"\n\n\"I,\" said Mazarin, with his most smiling expression.\n\n\"I ask pardon of your eminence,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but I was so\nfatigued----\"\n\n\"Don't ask my pardon, monsieur,\" said Mazarin, \"for you fatigued\nyourself in my service.\"\n\nD'Artagnan admired Mazarin's gracious manner. \"Ah,\" said he, between\nhis teeth, \"is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one\nsleeps?\"\n\n\"Follow me, monsieur,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Come, come,\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"Rochefort has kept his promise,\nbut where in the devil is he?\" And he searched the cabinet even to the\nsmallest recesses, but there was no sign of Rochefort.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal, sitting down on a fauteuil,\n\"you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"but he has taken a long time to let\nme know his thoughts;\" nevertheless, he bowed to the very ground in\ngratitude for Mazarin's compliment.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Mazarin, \"the time has come to put to use your talents\nand your valor.\"\n\nThere was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer's eyes, which vanished\nimmediately, for he knew nothing of Mazarin's purpose.\n\n\"Order, my lord,\" he said; \"I am ready to obey your eminence.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued the cardinal, \"you performed sundry\nsuperb exploits in the last reign.\"\n\n\"Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor. It is\ntrue I fought with tolerable success.\"\n\n\"I don't speak of your warlike exploits, monsieur,\" said Mazarin;\n\"although they gained you much reputation, they were surpassed by\nothers.\"\n\nD'Artagnan pretended astonishment.\n\n\"Well, you do not reply?\" resumed Mazarin.\n\n\"I am waiting, my lord, till you tell me of what exploits you speak.\"\n\n\"I speak of the adventure--Eh, you know well what I mean.\"\n\n\"Alas, no, my lord!\" replied D'Artagnan, surprised.\n\n\"You are discreet--so much the better. I speak of that adventure in\nbehalf of the queen, of the ornaments, of the journey you made with\nthree of your friends.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" thought the Gascon; \"is this a snare or not? Let me be on my\nguard.\"\n\nAnd he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose, two of\nthe first actors of the day, might have envied.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Mazarin; \"they told me that you were the man I wanted.\nCome, let us see what you will do for me.\"\n\n\"Everything that your eminence may please to command me,\" was the reply.\n\n\"You will do for me what you have done for the queen?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" D'Artagnan said to himself, \"he wishes to make me speak\nout. He's not more cunning than De Richelieu was! Devil take him!\" Then\nhe said aloud:\n\n\"The queen, my lord? I don't comprehend.\"\n\n\"You don't comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of\nuse to me?\"\n\n\"Which of my friends, my lord?\"\n\n\"Your three friends--the friends of former days.\"\n\n\"Of former days, my lord! In former days I had not only three friends, I\nhad thirty; at two-and-twenty one calls every man one's friend.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returned Mazarin, \"prudence is a fine thing, but to-day you\nmight regret having been too prudent.\"\n\n\"My lord, Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that\nthey might learn to hold their tongues.\"\n\n\"But you have been silent for twenty years, sir. Speak, now the queen\nherself releases you from your promise.\"\n\n\"The queen!\" said D'Artagnan, with an astonishment which this time was\nnot pretended.\n\n\"Yes, the queen! And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show\nyou this diamond, which she thinks you know.\"\n\nAnd so saying, Mazarin extended his hand to the officer, who sighed as\nhe recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the\nnight of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased\nfrom Monsieur des Essarts.\n\n\"'Tis true. I remember well that diamond, which belonged to the queen.\"\n\n\"You see, then, that I speak to you in the queen's name. Answer me\nwithout acting as if you were on the stage; your interests are concerned\nin your so doing.\"\n\n\"Faith, my lord, it is very necessary for me to make my fortune, your\neminence has so long forgotten me.\"\n\n\"We need only a week to amend all that. Come, you are accounted for, you\nare here, but where are your friends?\"\n\n\"I do not know, my lord. We have parted company this long time; all\nthree have left the service.\"\n\n\"Where can you find them, then?\"\n\n\"Wherever they are, that's my business.\"\n\n\"Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?\"\n\n\"Money, my lord, as much money as what you wish me to undertake will\nrequire. I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of\nmoney, and but for that diamond, which I was obliged to sell, we should\nhave remained on the road.\"\n\n\"The devil he does! Money! and a large sum!\" said Mazarin. \"Pray, are\nyou aware that the king has no money in his treasury?\"\n\n\"Do then as I did, my lord. Sell the crown diamonds. Trust me, don't\nlet us try to do things cheaply. Great undertakings come poorly off with\npaltry means.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mazarin, \"we will satisfy you.\"\n\n\"Richelieu,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"would have given me five hundred\npistoles in advance.\"\n\n\"You will then be at my service?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"Yes, if my friends agree.\"\n\n\"But if they refuse can I count on you?\"\n\n\"I have never accomplished anything alone,\" said D'Artagnan, shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"Go, then, and find them.\"\n\n\"What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence?\"\n\n\"You know them better than I. Adapt your promises to their respective\ncharacters.\"\n\n\"What shall I promise?\"\n\n\"That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude\nshall be magnificent.\"\n\n\"But what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy; when the time for action comes you shall be put in\nfull possession of what I require from you; wait till that time arrives\nand find out your friends.\"\n\n\"My lord, perhaps they are not in Paris. It is even probable that I\nshall have to make a journey. I am only a lieutenant of musketeers, very\npoor, and journeys cost money.\n\n\"My intention,\" said Mazarin, \"is not that you go with a great\nfollowing; my plans require secrecy, and would be jeopardized by a too\nextravagant equipment.\"\n\n\"Still, my lord, I can't travel on my pay, for it is now three months\nbehind; and I can't travel on my savings, for in my twenty-two years of\nservice I have accumulated nothing but debts.\"\n\nMazarin remained some moments in deep thought, as if he were fighting\nwith himself; then, going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock,\nhe took from it a bag of silver, and weighing it twice in his hands\nbefore he gave it to D'Artagnan:\n\n\"Take this,\" he said with a sigh, \"'tis merely for your journey.\"\n\n\"If these are Spanish doubloons, or even gold crowns,\" thought\nD'Artagnan, \"we shall yet be able to do business together.\" He saluted\nthe cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket.\n\n\"Well, then, all is settled; you are to set off,\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Apropos, what are the names of your friends?\"\n\n\"The Count de la Fere, formerly styled Athos; Monsieur du Vallon,\nwhom we used to call Porthos; the Chevalier d'Herblay, now the Abbe\nd'Herblay, whom we styled Aramis----\"\n\nThe cardinal smiled.\n\n\"Younger sons,\" he said, \"who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned\nnames in order not to lower their family names. Long swords but light\npurses. Was that it?\"\n\n\"If, God willing, these swords should be devoted to the service of your\neminence,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I shall venture to express a wish, which\nis, that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and\ntheirs heavy--for with these three men your eminence may rouse all\nEurope if you like.\"\n\n\"These Gascons,\" said the cardinal, laughing, \"almost beat the Italians\nin effrontery.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" answered D'Artagnan, with a smile almost as crafty as\nthe cardinal's, \"they beat them when they draw their swords.\"\n\nHe then withdrew, and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a\nlamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money.\n\n\"Crown pieces only--silver pieces! I suspected it. Ah! Mazarin! Mazarin!\nthou hast no confidence in me! so much the worse for thee, for harm may\ncome of it!\"\n\nMeanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction.\n\n\"A hundred pistoles! a hundred pistoles! for a hundred pistoles I have\ndiscovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand\ncrowns; without reckoning the value of that diamond\"--he cast a\ncomplacent look at the ring, which he had kept, instead of restoring to\nD'Artagnan--\"which is worth, at least, ten thousand francs.\"\n\nHe returned to his room, and after depositing the ring in a casket\nfilled with brilliants of every sort, for the cardinal was a connoisseur\nin precious stones, he called to Bernouin to undress him, regardless of\nthe noises of gun-fire that, though it was now near midnight, continued\nto resound through Paris.\n\nIn the meantime D'Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne, where\nhe lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette.\n\nWe will explain in a few words how D'Artagnan had been led to choose\nthat place of residence.\n\n\n\n\n6. D'Artagnan in his Fortieth Year.\n\n\n\nYears have elapsed, many events have happened, alas! since, in our\nromance of \"The Three Musketeers,\" we took leave of D'Artagnan at No.\n12 Rue des Fossoyeurs. D'Artagnan had not failed in his career, but\ncircumstances had been adverse to him. So long as he was surrounded by\nhis friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character. He\nwas one of those fine, ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves\neasily to the dispositions of others. Athos imparted to him his\ngreatness of soul, Porthos his enthusiasm, Aramis his elegance. Had\nD'Artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have\nbecome a superior character. Athos was the first to leave him, in order\nthat he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois;\nPorthos, the second, to marry an attorney's wife; and lastly, Aramis,\nthe third, to take orders and become an abbe. From that day D'Artagnan\nfelt lonely and powerless, without courage to pursue a career in which\nhe could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three\ncompanions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from\nHeaven.\n\nNotwithstanding his commission in the musketeers, D'Artagnan felt\ncompletely solitary. For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame\nBonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge, perishable\nindeed; for like all other recollections in this world, these\nimpressions were, by degrees, effaced. A garrison life is fatal even\nto the most aristocratic organization; and imperceptibly, D'Artagnan,\nalways in the camp, always on horseback, always in garrison, became (I\nknow not how in the present age one would express it) a typical trooper.\nHis early refinement of character was not only not lost, it grew even\ngreater than ever; but it was now applied to the little, instead of\nto the great things of life--to the martial condition of the\nsoldier--comprised under the head of a good lodging, a rich table, a\ncongenial hostess. These important advantages D'Artagnan found to his\nown taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe.\n\nFrom the time D'Artagnan took quarters in that hotel, the mistress of\nthe house, a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman, twenty-five or\ntwenty-six years old, had been singularly interested in him; and after\ncertain love passages, much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to\nwhom a dozen times D'Artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword\nthrough his body, that husband had disappeared one fine morning, after\nfurtively selling certain choice lots of wine, carrying away with him\nmoney and jewels. He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who\ncherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow, stoutly maintained\nthat death had taken him. Therefore, after the connection had continued\nthree years, carefully fostered by D'Artagnan, who found his bed and his\nmistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other,\nthe mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and\nproposed to D'Artagnan that he should marry her.\n\n\"Ah, fie!\" D'Artagnan replied. \"Bigamy, my dear! Come now, you don't\nreally wish it?\"\n\n\"But he is dead; I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us\nhanged.\"\n\n\"All right; if he comes back you will kill him, you are so skillful and\nso brave.\"\n\n\"Peste! my darling! another way of getting hanged.\"\n\n\"So you refuse my request?\"\n\n\"To be sure I do--furiously!\"\n\nThe pretty landlady was desolate. She would have taken D'Artagnan not\nonly as her husband, but as her God, he was so handsome and had so\nfierce a mustache.\n\nThen along toward the fourth year came the expedition of Franche-Comte.\nD'Artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart. There\nwere then great griefs, tears without end and solemn promises to remain\nfaithful--all of course on the part of the hostess. D'Artagnan was too\ngrand to promise anything; he purposed only to do all that he could to\nincrease the glory of his name.\n\nAs to that, we know D'Artagnan's courage; he exposed himself freely to\ndanger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball\nthrough the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle. He\nhad been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise;\nevery one, therefore, believed him to be dead, especially those to whom\nhis death would give promotion. One believes readily what he wishes\nto believe. Now in the army, from the division-generals who desire the\ndeath of the general-in-chief, to the soldiers who desire the death of\nthe corporals, all desire some one's death.\n\nBut D'Artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that.\nAfter he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the\nbattle-field, the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself.\nHe gained a village, knocked at the door of the finest house and was\nreceived as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France. He\nwas petted, tended, cured; and one fine morning, in better health than\never before, he set out for France. Once in France he turned his course\ntoward Paris, and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne.\n\nBut D'Artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man,\ncomplete, except for the sword, arranged along the wall.\n\n\"He has returned,\" said he. \"So much the worse, and so much the better!\"\n\nIt need not be said that D'Artagnan was still thinking of the husband.\nHe made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the\nmistress had gone for a walk.\n\n\"Alone?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"With monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur has returned, then?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" naively replied the servant.\n\n\"If I had any money,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I would go away;\nbut I have none. I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess, while\nthwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition.\"\n\nHe had just completed this monologue--which proves that in momentous\ncircumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue--when the\nservant-maid, watching at the door, suddenly cried out:\n\n\"Ah! see! here is madame returning with monsieur.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the\nhostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss, who\ntiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him\nof his old friend Porthos.\n\n\"Is that monsieur?\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"Oh! oh! he has grown\na good deal, it seems to me.\" And he sat down in the hall, choosing a\nconspicuous place.\n\nThe hostess, as she entered, saw D'Artagnan and uttered a little cry,\nwhereupon D'Artagnan, judging that he had been recognized, rose, ran to\nher and embraced her tenderly. The Swiss, with an air of stupefaction,\nlooked at the hostess, who turned pale.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, monsieur! What do you want of me?\" she asked, in great\ndistress.\n\n\"Is monsieur your cousin? Is monsieur your brother?\" said D'Artagnan,\nnot in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing.\nAnd without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the\nHelvetian, who received him with great coldness.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" he asked.\n\nThe hostess replied only by gasps.\n\n\"Who is that Swiss?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur is going to marry me,\" replied the hostess, between two gasps.\n\n\"Your husband, then, is at last dead?\"\n\n\"How does that concern you?\" replied the Swiss.\n\n\"It concerns me much,\" said D'Artagnan, \"since you cannot marry madame\nwithout my consent and since----\"\n\n\"And since?\" asked the Swiss.\n\n\"And since--I do not give it,\" said the musketeer.\n\nThe Swiss became as purple as a peony. He wore his elegant uniform,\nD'Artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak; the Swiss was six feet\nhigh, D'Artagnan was hardly more than five; the Swiss considered himself\non his own ground and regarded D'Artagnan as an intruder.\n\n\"Will you go away from here?\" demanded the Swiss, stamping violently,\nlike a man who begins to be seriously angry.\n\n\"I? By no means!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Some one must go for help,\" said a lad, who could not comprehend that\nthis little man should make a stand against that other man, who was so\nlarge.\n\nD'Artagnan, with a sudden accession of wrath, seized the lad by the ear\nand led him apart, with the injunction:\n\n\"Stay you where you are and don't you stir, or I will pull this ear off.\nAs for you, illustrious descendant of William Tell, you will straightway\nget together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me, and\ngo out quickly to another lodging.\"\n\nThe Swiss began to laugh boisterously. \"I go out?\" he said. \"And why?\"\n\n\"Ah, very well!\" said D'Artagnan; \"I see that you understand French.\nCome then, and take a turn with me and I will explain.\"\n\nThe hostess, who knew D'Artagnan's skill with the sword, began to weep\nand tear her hair. D'Artagnan turned toward her, saying, \"Then send him\naway, madame.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the Swiss, who had needed a little time to take in\nD'Artagnan's proposal, \"pooh! who are you, in the first place, to ask me\nto take a turn with you?\"\n\n\"I am lieutenant in his majesty's musketeers,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and\nconsequently your superior in everything; only, as the question now is\nnot of rank, but of quarters--you know the custom--come and seek for\nyours; the first to return will recover his chamber.\"\n\nD'Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of\nthe hostess, who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former\nlover, though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that\nhaughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand.\n\nIt was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle.\nD'Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed\nchamber; the Swiss refused by shaking his head, and drew his sword.\n\n\"Then you will lie here,\" said D'Artagnan. \"It is a wretched bed, but\nthat is not my fault, and it is you who have chosen it.\" With these\nwords he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary.\n\nHe had to contend against a strong wrist, but his agility was superior\nto all force. The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it,\nby reason of the cold; but suddenly feebleness, occasioned by loss of\nblood, obliged him to sit down.\n\n\"There!\" said: D'Artagnan, \"what did I tell you? Fortunately, you won't\nbe laid up more than a fortnight. Remain here and I will send you your\nclothes by the boy. Good-by! Oh, by the way, you'd better take lodging\nin the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote. You will be well fed\nthere, if the hostess remains the same. Adieu.\"\n\nThereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the\nSwiss the things that belonged to him. The boy found him sitting where\nD'Artagnan had left him, still overwhelmed by the coolness of his\nadversary.\n\nThe boy, the hostess, and all the house had the same regard for\nD'Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to\nrepeat his twelve labors.\n\nBut when he was alone with the hostess he said: \"Now, pretty Madeleine,\nyou know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman. As for you,\nyou have acted like a barmaid. So much the worse for you, for by such\nconduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage. I have driven away\nthe Swiss to humiliate you, but I shall lodge here no longer. I will not\nsleep where I must scorn. Ho, there, boy! Have my valise carried to the\nMuid d'Amour, Rue des Bourdonnais. Adieu, madame.\"\n\nIn saying these words D'Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and\ngrieved. The hostess threw herself at his feet, asked his pardon and\nheld him back with a sweet violence. What more need be said? The spit\nturned, the stove roared, the pretty Madeleine wept; D'Artagnan felt\nhimself invaded by hunger, cold and love. He pardoned, and having\npardoned he remained.\n\nAnd this explains how D'Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne, at\nthe Hotel de la Chevrette.\n\nD'Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood, finding a somewhat\nlively pleasure in carrying Mazarin's bag of money and thinking of that\nfine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on\nthe minister's finger that night.\n\n\"Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again,\" he reflected, \"I\nwould turn it at once into money; I would buy with the proceeds certain\nlands around my father's chateau, which is a pretty place, well enough,\nbut with no land to it at all, except a garden about the size of the\nCemetery des Innocents; and I should wait in all my glory till some\nrich heiress, attracted by my good looks, rode along to marry me. Then I\nshould like to have three sons; I should make the first a nobleman, like\nAthos; the second a good soldier, like Porthos; the third an excellent\nabbe, like Aramis. Faith! that would be a far better life than I lead\nnow; but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch, who won't dispossess himself\nof his diamond in my favor.\"\n\nOn entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a\ndense crowd near the house.\n\n\"Oho!\" said he, \"is the hotel on fire?\" On approaching the hotel of the\nRoe he found, however, that it was in front of the next house the mob\nwas collected. The people were shouting and running about with torches.\nBy the light of one of these torches D'Artagnan perceived men in\nuniform.\n\nHe asked what was going on.\n\nHe was told that twenty citizens, headed by one man, had attacked a\ncarriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal's bodyguard; but\na reinforcement having come up, the assailants had been put to flight\nand the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings; the\nhouse was now being searched.\n\nIn his youth D'Artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against\nthe military, but he was cured of all those hot-headed propensities;\nbesides, he had the cardinal's hundred pistoles in his pocket, so he\nwent into the hotel without a word. There he found Madeleine alarmed for\nhis safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening, but he\ncut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him\nwith it a bottle of good Burgundy.\n\nHe took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom. He had\nbeen contented, for the convenience of the house, to lodge in the fourth\nstory; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just\nabove the gutter and below the roof. His first care on entering it was\nto lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money, and then\nas soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up\nand sat down to table.\n\nNot to reflect on what had passed, as one might fancy. No, D'Artagnan\nconsidered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to\ntheir proper time. He was hungry; he supped, he went to bed. Neither was\nhe one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings\ncounsel with it. In the night he slept, but in the morning, refreshed\nand calm, he was inspired with his clearest views of everything. It\nwas long since he had any reason for his morning's inspiration, but he\nalways slept all night long. At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around\nhis room.\n\n\"In '43,\" he said, \"just before the death of the late cardinal, I\nreceived a letter from Athos. Where was I then? Let me see. Oh! at the\nsiege of Besancon I was in the trenches. He told me--let me think--what\nwas it? That he was living on a small estate--but where? I was just\nreading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away, I\nsuppose to the Spaniards; there's no use in thinking any more about\nAthos. Let me see: with regard to Porthos, I received a letter from him,\ntoo. He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of\nSeptember, 1646. Unluckily, as I was then in Bearn, on account of my\nfather's death, the letter followed me there. I had left Bearn when it\narrived and I never received it until the month of April, 1647; and as\nthe invitation was for September, 1646, I couldn't accept it. Let me\nlook for this letter; it must be with my title deeds.\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room, and\nwhich was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period\nof two hundred years lost to his family. He uttered an exclamation\nof delight, for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible, and\nunderneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse.\n\nD'Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter; it was dated\nfrom the Chateau du Vallon.\n\nPorthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary; in his pride\nhe fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon.\n\n\"Devil take the vain fellow,\" said D'Artagnan. \"However, I had better\nfind him out first, since he can't want money. Athos must have become\nan idiot by this time from drinking. Aramis must have worn himself to a\nshadow of his former self by constant genuflexion.\"\n\nHe cast his eyes again on the letter. There was a postscript:\n\n\"I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his\nconvent.\"\n\n\"In his convent! What convent? There are about two hundred in Paris and\nthree thousand in France; and then, perhaps, on entering the convent\nhe changed his name. Ah! if I were but learned in theology I should\nrecollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of\nMontdidier and the superior of the Jesuits, when we were at Crevecoeur;\nI should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that\nwhat saint he has adopted as his patron.\n\n\"Well, suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into\nall the convents one can find, even into the nunneries? It would be\na curious idea, and maybe I should find my friend under the name of\nAchilles. But, no! I should lose myself in the cardinal's opinion. Great\npeople only thank you for doing the impossible; what's possible, they\nsay, they can effect themselves, and they are right. But let us wait a\nlittle and reflect. I received a letter from him, the dear fellow,\nin which he even asked me for some small service, which, in fact, I\nrendered him. Yes, yes; but now what did I do with that letter?\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung\nhis old clothes. He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he\nhad orderly habits, he found it hanging on its nail. He felt in the\npocket and drew from it a paper; it was the letter of Aramis:\n\n\n\n\"Monsieur D'Artagnan: You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain\ngentleman, who has given me an appointment for this evening in the\nPlace Royale. As I am of the church, and the affair might injure me if\nI should share it with any other than a sure friend like you, I write to\nbeg that you will serve me as second.\n\n\"You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine; under the second lamp\non the right you will find your adversary. I shall be with mine under\nthe third.\n\n\"Wholly yours,\n\n\"Aramis.\"\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan tried to recall his remembrances. He had gone to the\nrendezvous, had encountered there the adversary indicated, whose name\nhe had never known, had given him a pretty sword-stroke on the arm, then\nhad gone toward Aramis, who at the same time came to meet him, having\nalready finished his affair. \"It is over,\" Aramis had said. \"I think I\nhave killed the insolent fellow. But, dear friend, if you ever need me\nyou know that I am entirely devoted to you.\" Thereupon Aramis had given\nhim a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades.\n\nSo, then, he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos\nwere, and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity, when he\nfancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window. He thought\ndirectly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was\nsleeping. He was not mistaken; as he entered his bedroom a man was\ngetting in by the window.\n\n\"Ah! you scoundrel!\" cried D'Artagnan, taking the man for a thief and\nseizing his sword.\n\n\"Sir!\" cried the man, \"in the name of Heaven put your sword back into\nthe sheath and don't kill me unheard. I'm no thief, but an honest\ncitizen, well off in the world, with a house of my own. My name is--ah!\nbut surely you are Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"And thou--Planchet!\" cried the lieutenant.\n\n\"At your service, sir,\" said Planchet, overwhelmed with joy; \"if I were\nstill capable of serving you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"But why the devil dost thou run\nabout the tops of houses at seven o'clock of the morning in the month of\nJanuary?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Planchet, \"you must know; but, perhaps you ought not to\nknow----\"\n\n\"Tell us what,\" returned D'Artagnan, \"but first put a napkin against the\nwindow and draw the curtains.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the prudent Planchet, \"in the first place, are you on good\nterms with Monsieur de Rochefort?\"\n\n\"Perfectly; one of my dearest friends.\"\n\n\"Ah! so much the better!\"\n\n\"But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading\nmy room?\"\n\n\"Ah, sir! I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is----\"\n\nPlanchet hesitated.\n\n\"Egad, I know where he is,\" said D'Artagnan. \"He's in the Bastile.\"\n\n\"That is to say, he was there,\" replied Planchet. \"But in returning\nthither last night, when fortunately you did not accompany him, as his\ncarriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted\nthe people, who began to abuse them. The prisoner thought this a good\nopportunity for escape; he called out his name and cried for help. I was\nthere. I heard the name of Rochefort. I remembered him well. I said in a\nloud voice that he was a prisoner, a friend of the Duc de Beaufort, who\ncalled for help. The people were infuriated; they stopped the horses and\ncut the escort to pieces, whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and\nMonsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd. At\nthis moment a patrol passed by. I was obliged to sound a retreat toward\nthe Rue Tiquetonne; I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to\nthis, where I have been concealed between two mattresses. This morning I\nventured to run along the gutters and----\"\n\n\"Well,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"I am delighted that De Rochefort is\nfree, but as for thee, if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the\nking's servants they will hang thee without mercy. Nevertheless, I\npromise thee thou shalt be hidden here, though I risk by concealing thee\nneither more nor less than my lieutenancy, if it was found out that I\ngave one rebel an asylum.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, you know well I would risk my life for you.\"\n\n\"Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it, Planchet. I have not forgotten\nall I owe thee. Sit down there and eat in security. I see thee cast\nexpressive glances at the remains of my supper.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; for all I've had since yesterday was a slice of bread and\nbutter, with preserves on it. Although I don't despise sweet things in\nproper time and place, I found the supper rather light.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said D'Artagnan. \"Well, come; set to.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir, you are going to save my life a second time!\" cried Planchet.\n\nAnd he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days\nof the Rue des Fossoyeurs, whilst D'Artagnan walked to and fro and\nthought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances.\nWhile he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up\nfor lost time at table. At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and\npaused, as if he had partially appeased his hunger.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, who thought that it was now a convenient time\nto begin his interrogations, \"dost thou know where Athos is?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Planchet.\n\n\"The devil thou dost not! Dost know where Porthos is?\"\n\n\"No--not at all.\"\n\n\"And Aramis?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"The devil! the devil! the devil!\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" said Planchet, with a look of shrewdness, \"I know where\nBazin is.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"At Notre Dame.\"\n\n\"What has he to do at Notre Dame?\"\n\n\"He is beadle.\"\n\n\"Bazin beadle at Notre Dame! He must know where his master is!\"\n\n\"Without a doubt he must.\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought for a moment, then took his sword and put on his\ncloak to go out.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Planchet, in a mournful tone, \"do you abandon me thus to my\nfate? Think, if I am found out here, the people of the house, who have\nnot seen me enter it, will take me for a thief.\"\n\n\"True,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Let's see. Canst thou speak any patois?\"\n\n\"I can do something better than that, sir, I can speak Flemish.\"\n\n\"Where the devil didst thou learn it?\"\n\n\"In Artois, where I fought for years. Listen, sir. Goeden morgen,\nmynheer, eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand.\"\n\n\"Which means?\"\n\n\"Good-day, sir! I am anxious to know the state of your health.\"\n\n\"He calls that a language! But never mind, that will do capitally.\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire\nMadeleine to come upstairs.\n\nWhen the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at\nseeing Planchet.\n\n\"My dear landlady,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I beg to introduce to you your\nbrother, who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into\nmy service.\"\n\n\"My brother?\"\n\n\"Wish your sister good-morning, Master Peter.\"\n\n\"Wilkom, suster,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Goeden day, broder,\" replied the astonished landlady.\n\n\"This is the case,\" said D'Artagnan; \"this is your brother, Madeleine;\nyou don't know him perhaps, but I know him; he has arrived from\nAmsterdam. You must dress him up during my absence. When I return, which\nwill be in about an hour, you must offer him to me as a servant, and\nupon your recommendation, though he doesn't speak a word of French, I\ntake him into my service. You understand?\"\n\n\"That is to say, I guess your wishes, and that is all that's necessary,\"\nsaid Madeleine.\n\n\"You are a precious creature, my pretty hostess, and I am much obliged\nto you.\"\n\nThe next moment D'Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame.\n\n\n\n\n7. Touches upon the Strange Effects a Half-pistole may have upon a\nBeadle and a Chorister.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan, as he crossed the Pont Neuf, congratulated himself on\nhaving found Planchet again, for at that time an intelligent servant\nwas essential to him; nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the\nsituation which he held in Rue des Lombards, a connection with the\nbourgeoisie might be commenced, at that critical period when that class\nwere preparing to make war with the court party. It was like having\na spy in the enemy's camp. In this frame of mind, grateful for the\naccidental meeting with Planchet, pleased with himself, D'Artagnan\nreached Notre Dame. He ran up the steps, entered the church, and\naddressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel, asked him if he knew\nMonsieur Bazin.\n\n\"Monsieur Bazin, the beadle?\" said the verger. \"Yes. There he is,\nattending mass, in the chapel of the Virgin.\"\n\nD'Artagnan nearly jumped for joy; he had despaired of finding Bazin, but\nnow, he thought, since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty\nsure to reach the other end.\n\nHe knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his\nman; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take\na book with him, he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin.\n\nBazin wore his dress, it may be observed, with equal dignity and saintly\npropriety. It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the\ncrown of his ambition and that the silver-mounted wand he brandished\nwas in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal's baton\nwhich Conde threw, or did not throw, into the enemy's line of battle at\nFribourg. His person had undergone a change, analogous to the change in\nhis dress; his figure had grown rotund and, as it were, canonical. The\nstriking points of his face were effaced; he had still a nose, but his\ncheeks, fattened out, each took a portion of it unto themselves; his\nchin had joined his throat; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness\nof his cheeks; his hair, cut straight in holy guise, covered his\nforehead as far as his eyebrows.\n\nThe officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst D'Artagnan was\nlooking at Bazin; he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and\nretired, giving the benediction, which was received by the kneeling\ncommunicants, to the astonishment of D'Artagnan, who recognized in the\npriest the coadjutor* himself, the famous Jean Francois Gondy, who\nat that time, having a presentiment of the part he was to play, was\nbeginning to court popularity by almsgiving. It was to this end that he\nperformed from time to time some of those early masses which the common\npeople, generally, alone attended.\n\n\n\n*A sacerdotal officer.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan knelt as well as the rest, received his share of the\nbenediction and made the sign of the cross; but when Bazin passed in his\nturn, with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking, in all humility, the\nvery last, D'Artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe.\n\nBazin looked down and started, as if he had seen a serpent.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" he cried; \"Vade retro Satanas!\"\n\n\"So, my dear Bazin!\" said the officer, laughing, \"this is the way you\nreceive an old friend.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Bazin, \"the true friends of a Christian are those who aid\nhim in working out his salvation, not those who hinder him in doing so.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, Bazin; nor can I see how I can be a\nstumbling-block in the way of your salvation,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You forget, sir, that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master;\nand that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned\neternally for remaining a musketeer, whilst all the time his true\nvocation was the church.\"\n\n\"My dear Bazin, you ought to perceive,\" said D'Artagnan, \"from the\nplace in which you find me, that I am greatly changed in everything. Age\nproduces good sense, and, as I doubt not but that your master is on the\nroad to salvation, I want you to tell me where he is, that he may help\nme to mine.\"\n\n\"Rather say, to take him back with you into the world. Fortunately, I\ndon't know where he is.\"\n\n\"How!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"you don't know where Aramis is?\"\n\n\"Formerly,\" replied Bazin, \"Aramis was his name of perdition. By Aramis\nis meant Simara, which is the name of a demon. Happily for him he has\nceased to bear that name.\"\n\n\"And therefore,\" said D'Artagnan, resolved to be patient to the end, \"it\nis not Aramis I seek, but the Abbe d'Herblay. Come, my dear Bazin, tell\nme where he is.\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear me tell you, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I don't know\nwhere he is?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; but to that I answer that it is impossible.\"\n\n\"It is, nevertheless, the truth, monsieur--the pure truth, the truth of\nthe good God.\"\n\nD'Artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man, who\nwas evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the\nabode of Aramis, but whose lies were bold and decided.\n\n\"Well, Bazin,\" said D'Artagnan, \"since you do not know where your master\nlives, let us speak of it no more; let us part good friends. Accept this\nhalf-pistole to drink to my health.\"\n\n\"I do not drink\"--Bazin pushed away with dignity the officer's\nhand--\"'tis good only for the laity.\"\n\n\"Incorruptible!\" murmured D'Artagnan; \"I am unlucky;\" and whilst he was\nlost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy, and even there\nhe could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door\nbehind him.\n\nD'Artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the\nshoulder. He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise\nwhen the other made to him a sign of silence.\n\n\"You here, Rochefort?\" he said, in a low voice.\n\n\"Hush!\" returned Rochefort. \"Did you know that I am at liberty?\"\n\n\"I knew it from the fountain-head--from Planchet. And what brought you\nhere?\"\n\n\"I came to thank God for my happy deliverance,\" said Rochefort.\n\n\"And nothing more? I suppose that is not all.\"\n\n\"To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up\nMazarin a little.\"\n\n\"A bad plan; you'll be shut up again in the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, I shall take care, I assure you. The air, the fresh,\nfree air is so good; besides,\" and Rochefort drew a deep breath as he\nspoke, \"I am going into the country to make a tour.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"I, too, am going.\"\n\n\"And if I may without impertinence ask--where are you going?\"\n\n\"To seek my friends.\"\n\n\"What friends?\"\n\n\"Those that you asked about yesterday.\"\n\n\"Athos, Porthos and Aramis--you are looking for them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"On honor?\"\n\n\"What, then, is there surprising in that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Queer, though. And in whose behalf are you looking for them?\"\n\n\"You are in no doubt on that score.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have no idea where they are.\"\n\n\"And you have no way to get news of them? Wait a week and I myself will\ngive you some.\"\n\n\"A week is too long. I must find them within three days.\"\n\n\"Three days are a short time and France is large.\"\n\n\"No matter; you know the word must; with that word great things are\ndone.\"\n\n\"And when do you set out?\"\n\n\"I am now on my road.\"\n\n\"Good luck to you.\"\n\n\"And to you--a good journey.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we shall meet on our road.\"\n\n\"That is not probable.\"\n\n\"Who knows? Chance is so capricious. Adieu, till we meet again! Apropos,\nshould Mazarin speak to you about me, tell him that I should have\nrequested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether I\nam, as he says, too old for action.\"\n\nAnd Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used\nformerly to make D'Artagnan shudder, but D'Artagnan could now see it\nwithout alarm, and smiling in his turn, with an expression of melancholy\nwhich the recollections called up by that smile could, perhaps, alone\ngive to his countenance, he said:\n\n\"Go, demon, do what thou wilt! It matters little now to me. There's no\nsecond Constance in the world.\"\n\nOn his return to the cathedral, D'Artagnan saw Bazin, who was conversing\nwith the sacristan. Bazin was making, with his spare little short arms,\nridiculous gestures. D'Artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence\nwith respect to himself.\n\nD'Artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade\nat the corner of the Rue des Canettes; it was impossible that Bazin\nshould go out of the cathedral without his seeing him.\n\nIn five minutes Bazin made his appearance, looking in every direction\nto see if he were observed, but he saw no one. Calmed by appearances he\nventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame. Then D'Artagnan rushed\nout of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the\nRue de la Juiverie and enter, in the Rue de la Calandre, a respectable\nlooking house; and this D'Artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation\nof the worthy beadle. Afraid of making any inquiries at this house,\nD'Artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and\nasked for a cup of hypocras. This beverage required a good half-hour to\nprepare. And D'Artagnan had time, therefore, to watch Bazin unsuspected.\n\nHe perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years\nof age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the\nguise of a chorister. He questioned him, and as the boy had no interest\nin deceiving, D'Artagnan learned that he exercised, from six o'clock in\nthe morning until nine, the office of chorister, and from nine o'clock\ntill midnight that of a waiter in the tavern.\n\nWhilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of\nBazin's house. It was saddled and bridled. Almost immediately Bazin came\ndownstairs.\n\n\"Look!\" said the boy, \"there's our beadle, who is going a journey.\"\n\n\"And where is he going?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Forsooth, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Half a pistole if you can find out,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"For me?\" cried the boy, his eyes sparkling with joy, \"if I can find\nout where Bazin is going? That is not difficult. You are not joking, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, on the honor of an officer; there is the half-pistole;\" and he\nshowed him the seductive coin, but did not give it him.\n\n\"I shall ask him.\"\n\n\"Just the very way not to know. Wait till he is set out and then, marry,\ncome up, ask, and find out. The half-pistole is ready,\" and he put it\nback again into his pocket.\n\n\"I understand,\" said the child, with that jeering smile which marks\nespecially the \"gamin de Paris.\" \"Well, we must wait.\"\n\nThey had not long to wait. Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a\nfull trot, urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie, which he was\nin the habit of using instead of a riding whip.\n\nScarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy\nrushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent.\n\nBefore ten minutes had elapsed the child returned.\n\n\"Well!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well!\" answered the boy, \"the thing is done.\"\n\n\"Where is he gone?\"\n\n\"The half-pistole is for me?\"\n\n\"Doubtless, answer me.\"\n\n\"I want to see it. Give it me, that I may see it is not false.\"\n\n\"There it is.\"\n\nThe child put the piece of money into his pocket.\n\n\"And now, where is he gone?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"He is gone to Noisy.\"\n\n\"How dost thou know?\"\n\n\"Ah, faith! there was no great cunning necessary. I knew the horse he\nrode; it belonged to the butcher, who lets it out now and then to M.\nBazin. Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like\nthat without knowing where it was going. And he answered 'that Monsieur\nBazin went to Noisy.' 'Tis his custom. He goes two or three times a\nweek.\"\n\n\"Dost thou know Noisy well?\"\n\n\"I think so, truly; my nurse lives there.\"\n\n\"Is there a convent at Noisy?\"\n\n\"Isn't there a great and grand one--the convent of Jesuits?\"\n\n\"What is thy name?\"\n\n\"Friquet.\"\n\nD'Artagnan wrote the child's name in his tablets.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said the boy, \"do you think I can gain any more\nhalf-pistoles in any way?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nAnd having got out all he wanted, he paid for the hypocras, which he did\nnot drink, and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne.\n\n\n\n\n8. How D'Artagnan, on going to a Distance to discover Aramis, discovers\nhis old Friend on Horseback behind his own Planchet.\n\n\n\nOn entering the hotel D'Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the\nfire. It was Planchet, but so completely transformed, thanks to the\nold clothes that the departing husband had left behind, that D'Artagnan\nhimself could hardly recognize him. Madeleine introduced him in presence\nof all the servants. Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish\nphrase; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language\nat all, and the bargain was concluded; Madeleine's brother entered\nD'Artagnan's service.\n\nThe plan adopted by D'Artagnan was soon perfected. He resolved not to\nreach Noisy in the day, for fear of being recognized; he had therefore\nplenty of time before him, for Noisy is only three or four leagues from\nParis, on the road to Meaux.\n\nHe began his day by breakfasting substantially--a bad beginning when one\nwants to employ the head, but an excellent precaution when one wants to\nwork the body; and about two o'clock he had his two horses saddled, and\nfollowed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete. A\nmost active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de\nla Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet.\n\nAt about a league and a half from the city, D'Artagnan, finding that\nin his impatience he had set out too soon, stopped to give the horses\nbreathing time. The inn was full of disreputable looking people,\nwho seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly\nexpedition. A man, wrapped in a cloak, appeared at the door, but seeing\na stranger he beckoned to his companions, and two men who were drinking\nin the inn went out to speak to him.\n\nD'Artagnan, on his side, went up to the landlady, praised her\nwine--which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil--and\nheard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the\nvillage; one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris, and was at\nthat time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville; the other\nwas a convent of Jesuits and was the property--a by no means unusual\ncircumstance--of these worthy fathers.\n\nAt four o'clock D'Artagnan recommenced his journey. He proceeded slowly\nand in deep reverie. Planchet also was lost in thought, but the subject\nof their reflections was not the same.\n\nOne word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular\nturn to D'Artagnan's deliberations; this was the name of Madame de\nLongueville.\n\nThat name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought.\nMadame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm; she\nwas also one of the greatest beauties at court. She had formerly been\nsuspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny, who, for\nher sake, had been killed in a duel, in the Place Royale, by the Duc\nde Guise. She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the\nPrince de Marsillac, the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld,\nwhom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Conde,\nher brother-in-law, whom she now hated mortally.\n\nD'Artagnan thought of all these matters. He remembered how at the Louvre\nhe had often seen, as she passed by him in the full radiance of her\ndazzling charms, the beautiful Madame de Longueville. He thought of\nAramis, who, without possessing any greater advantages than himself, had\nformerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse, who had been to a former\ncourt what Madame de Longueville was in that day; and he wondered how it\nwas that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish,\nsome in ambition, others in love, whilst others, either from chance,\nor from ill-luck, or from some natural defect or impediment,\nremain half-way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and\nexpectations.\n\nHe was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy\nclass, when Planchet approached and said:\n\n\"I will lay a wager, your honor, that you and I are thinking of the same\nthing.\"\n\n\"I doubt it, Planchet,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"but what are you thinking\nof?\"\n\n\"I am thinking, sir, of those desperate looking men who were drinking in\nthe inn where we rested.\"\n\n\"Always cautious, Planchet.\"\n\n\"'Tis instinct, your honor.\"\n\n\"Well, what does your instinct tell you now?\"\n\n\"Sir, my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for\nsome bad purpose; and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me,\nin the darkest corner of the stable, when a man wrapped in a cloak and\nfollowed by two other men, came in.\"\n\n\"Ah ah!\" said D'Artagnan, Planchet's recital agreeing with his own\nobservations. \"Well?\"\n\n\"One of these two men said, 'He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming\nthere this evening, for I have seen his servant.'\n\n\"'Art thou sure?' said the man in the cloak.\n\n\"'Yes, my prince.'\"\n\n\"My prince!\" interrupted D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, 'my prince;' but listen. 'If he is here'--this is what the other\nman said--'let's see decidedly what to do with him.'\n\n\"'What to do with him?' answered the prince.\n\n\"'Yes, he's not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow; he'll defend\nhimself.'\n\n\"'Well, we must try to take him alive. Have you cords to bind him with\nand a gag to stop his mouth?'\n\n\"'We have.'\n\n\"'Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman.'\n\n\"'Yes, yes, my lord; don't be uneasy.'\n\n\"'Besides, I shall be there.'\n\n\"'You will assure us that justice----'\n\n\"'Yes, yes! I answer for all that,' the prince said.\n\n\"'Well, then, we'll do our best.' Having said that, they went out of the\nstable.\"\n\n\"Well, what matters all that to us?\" said D'Artagnan. \"This is one of\nthose attempts that happen every day.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that we are not its objects?\"\n\n\"We? Why?\"\n\n\"Just remember what they said. 'I have seen his servant,' said one, and\nthat applies very well to me.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"'He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening,' said\nthe other; and that applies very well to you.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Then the prince said: 'Take notice that in all probability he will be\ndisguised as a cavalier;' which seems to me to leave no room for doubt,\nsince you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers.\nNow then, what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"Alas! my dear Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, sighing, \"we are\nunfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to\nassassinate me. Those were good old days; never fear--these people owe\nus no grudge.\"\n\n\"Is your honor sure?\"\n\n\"I can answer for it they do not.\"\n\n\"Well, we won't speak of it any more, then;\" and Planchet took his place\nin D'Artagnan's suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in\nhis master, which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed.\n\nThey had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up\nto D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Stop, sir, look yonder,\" he whispered; \"don't you see in the darkness\nsomething pass by, like shadows? I fancy I hear horses' feet.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" returned D'Artagnan. \"The ground is soaking wet; yet I\nfancy, as thou sayest, that I see something.\"\n\nAt this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear, coming through\ndarkness and space.\n\n\"There are men somewhere about, but that's of no consequence to us,\"\nsaid D'Artagnan; \"let us ride onward.\"\n\nAt about half-past eight o'clock they reached the first houses in Noisy;\nevery one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village. The\nobscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of\nthe roofs of houses. Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an\naffrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take\nrefuge behind a pile of faggots, from which retreat her eyes would shine\nlike peridores. These were the only living creatures that seemed to\ninhabit the village.\n\nToward the middle of the town, commanding the principal open space,\nrose a dark mass, separated from the rest of the world by two lanes\nand overshadowed in the front by enormous lime-trees. D'Artagnan looked\nattentively at the building.\n\n\"This,\" he said to Planchet, \"must be the archbishop's chateau, the\nabode of the fair Madame de Longueville; but the convent, where is\nthat?\"\n\n\"The convent, your honor, is at the other end of the village; I know it\nwell.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Planchet, gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horse's\ngirth, and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the\nJesuits' windows.\"\n\nIn about five minutes Planchet returned.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"there is one window of the convent lighted up.\"\n\n\"Hem! If I were a 'Frondeur,'\" said D'Artagnan, \"I should knock here and\nshould be sure of a good supper. If I were a monk I should knock yonder\nand should have a good supper there, too; whereas, 'tis very possible\nthat between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds,\ndying with hunger and thirst.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Planchet, \"like the famous ass of Buridan. Shall I knock?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"the light no longer burns in yonder\nwindow.\"\n\n\"Do you hear nothing?\" whispered Planchet.\n\n\"What is that noise?\"\n\nThere came a sound like a whirlwind, at the same time two troops of\nhorsemen, each composed of ten men, sallied forth from each of the lanes\nwhich encompassed the house and surrounded D'Artagnan and Planchet.\n\n\"Heyday!\" cried D'Artagnan, drawing his sword and taking refuge behind\nhis horse; \"are you not mistaken? is it really for us that you mean your\nattack?\"\n\n\"Here he is! we have him!\" cried the horsemen, rushing on D'Artagnan\nwith naked swords.\n\n\"Don't let him escape!\" said a loud voice.\n\n\"No, my lord; be assured we shall not.\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.\n\n\"Halloo, gentlemen!\" he called out in his Gascon accent, \"what do you\nwant? what do you demand?\"\n\n\"That thou shalt soon know,\" shouted a chorus of horsemen.\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried he whom they had addressed as \"my lord;\" \"'tis not\nhis voice.\"\n\n\"Ah! just so, gentlemen! pray, do people get into a passion at random\nat Noisy? Take care, for I warn you that the first man that comes within\nthe length of my sword--and my sword is long--I rip him up.\"\n\nThe chieftain of the party drew near.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked in a lofty tone, as that of one\naccustomed to command.\n\n\"And you--what are you doing here?\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to\nproclaim oneself, one insists on respect suitable to one's rank.\"\n\n\"You don't choose to discover yourself, because you are the leader of\nan ambuscade,\" returned D'Artagnan; \"but with regard to myself, who am\ntraveling quietly with my own servant, I have not the same reasons as\nyou have to conceal my name.\"\n\n\"Enough! enough! what is your name?\"\n\n\"I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me,\nmy lord, or my prince, as it may suit you best to be called,\" said our\nGascon, who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat. \"Do you know\nMonsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant in the king's musketeers?\" said the voice; \"you are Monsieur\nd'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Then you came here to defend him?\"\n\n\"Him? whom?\"\n\n\"The man we are seeking.\"\n\n\"It seems,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that whilst I thought I was coming\nto Noisy I have entered, without suspecting it, into the kingdom of\nmysteries.\"\n\n\"Come,\" replied the same lofty tone, \"answer! Are you waiting for him\nunderneath these windows? Did you come to Noisy to defend him?\"\n\n\"I am waiting for no one,\" replied D'Artagnan, who was beginning to be\nangry. \"I propose to defend no one but myself, and I shall defend myself\nvigorously, I give you warning.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the voice; \"go away from here and leave the place to\nus.\"\n\n\"Go away from here!\" said D'Artagnan, whose purposes were in conflict\nwith that order, \"that is not so easy, since I am on the point of\nfalling, and my horse, too, through fatigue; unless, indeed, you are\ndisposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Rascal!\"\n\n\"Eh! monsieur!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I beg you will have a care what you\nsay; for if you utter another word like that, be you marquis, duke,\nprince or king, I will thrust it down your throat! do you hear?\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" rejoined the leader, \"there's no doubt 'tis a Gascon who\nis speaking, and therefore not the man we are looking for. Our blow\nhas failed for to-night; let us withdraw. We shall meet again, Master\nd'Artagnan,\" continued the leader, raising his voice.\n\n\"Yes, but never with the same advantages,\" said D'Artagnan, in a tone\nof raillery; \"for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and\nthere will be daylight.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good,\" said the voice. \"En route, gentlemen.\"\n\nAnd the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared in the darkness and took\nthe road to Paris. D'Artagnan and Planchet remained for some moments\nstill on the defensive; then, as the noise of the horsemen became more\nand more distant, they sheathed their swords.\n\n\"Thou seest, simpleton,\" said D'Artagnan to his servant, \"that they\nwished no harm to us.\"\n\n\"But to whom, then?\"\n\n\"I'faith! I neither know nor care. What I do care for now, is to make\nmy way into the Jesuits' convent; so to horse and let us knock at their\ndoor. Happen what will, the devil take them, they can't eat us.\"\n\nAnd he mounted his horse. Planchet had just done the same when an\nunexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.\n\n\"Hey! your honor!\" cried Planchet, \"I've a man behind me.\"\n\nD'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's\nhorse.\n\n\"'Tis then the devil that pursues!\" he cried; drawing his sword and\npreparing to attack the new foe.\n\n\"No, no, dear D'Artagnan,\" said the figure, \"'tis not the devil, 'tis\nAramis; gallop fast, Planchet, and when you come to the end of the\nvillage turn swiftly to the left.\"\n\nAnd Planchet, with Aramis behind him, set off at full gallop, followed\nby D'Artagnan, who began to think he was in the merry maze of some\nfantastic dream.\n\n\n\n\n9. The Abbe D'Herblay.\n\n\n\nAt the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience\nto the orders of Aramis, and stopped underneath the window which\nhad light in it. Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times.\nImmediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from\nit.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Aramis, \"if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to\nreceive you.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is that the way you return to your apartment?\"\n\n\"After nine at night, pardieu!\" said Aramis, \"the rule of the convent is\nvery severe.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I think you said\n'pardieu!'\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Aramis, smiling; \"it is possible. You have\nno idea, my dear fellow, how one acquires bad habits in these cursed\nconvents, or what evil ways all these men of the church have, with whom\nI am obliged to live. But will you not go up?\"\n\n\"Pass on before me, I beg of you.\"\n\n\"As the late cardinal used to say to the late king, 'only to show you\nthe way, sire.'\" And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the\nwindow in an instant.\n\nD'Artagnan followed, but less nimbly, showing plainly that this mode of\nascent was not one to which he was accustomed.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Aramis, noticing his awkwardness; \"if I had\nknown that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured\nthe gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan on the summit of the ladder,\n\"this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of\nnecessity I might also climb up, but my two horses cannot mount the\nladder.\"\n\n\"Take them to yonder shed, my friend,\" said Aramis, pointing to a low\nbuilding on the plain; \"there you will find hay and straw for them; then\ncome back here and clap your hands three times, and we will give you\nwine and food. Marry, forsooth, people don't die of hunger here.\"\n\nAnd Aramis, drawing in the ladder, closed the window. D'Artagnan then\nlooked around attentively.\n\nNever was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more\nelegant. At each corner were arranged trophies, presenting to view\nswords of all sorts, and on the walls hung four great pictures\nrepresenting in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de\nLorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the Cardinal de la Valette, and the\nArchbishop of Bordeaux. Exteriorly, nothing in the room showed that it\nwas the habitation of an abbe. The hangings were of damask, the carpets\nfrom Alencon, and the bed, especially, had more the look of a fine\nlady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered\ncounterpane, than that of a man who had made a vow that he would\nendeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification.\n\n\"You are examining my den,\" said Aramis. \"Ah, my dear fellow, excuse me;\nI am lodged like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?\"\n\n\"I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and\nyet the ladder didn't come down of itself.\"\n\n\"No, it is Bazin.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But,\" continued Aramis, \"Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing\nthat I was not alone he discreetly retired. Sit down, my dear friend,\nand let us talk.\" And Aramis pushed forward a large easy-chair, in which\nD'Artagnan stretched himself out.\n\n\"In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Yes, if you really wish it,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and even with great\npleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.\"\n\n\"Ah, my poor friend!\" said Aramis, \"you will find meagre fare; you were\nnot expected.\"\n\n\"Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?\"\n\n\"Oh, let us hope,\" said Aramis, \"that with the help of God and of Bazin\nwe shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy\nJesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.\"\n\nThe door opened and Bazin entered; on perceiving the musketeer he\nuttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair.\n\n\"My dear Bazin,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I am delighted to see with what\nwonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Bazin, \"I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers\nthat it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good\ncause.\"\n\n\"So far well,\" said Aramis; \"we are dying of hunger. Serve us up the\nbest supper you can, and especially give us some good wine.\"\n\nBazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.\n\n\"Now we are alone, dear Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan, \"tell me how the devil\nyou managed to alight upon the back of Planchet's horse.\"\n\n\"I'faith!\" answered Aramis, \"as you see, from Heaven.\"\n\n\"From Heaven,\" replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; \"you have no more\nthe appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Aramis, with a look of imbecility on his face which\nD'Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers, \"if I did\nnot come from Heaven, at least I was leaving Paradise, which is almost\nthe same.\"\n\n\"Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,\" observed D'Artagnan, \"until\nnow they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise;\nsome place it on Mount Ararat, others between the rivers Tigris and\nEuphrates; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it,\nwhile it was actually very near. Paradise is at Noisy le Sec, upon the\nsite of the archbishop's chateau. People do not go out from it by the\ndoor, but by the window; one doesn't descend here by the marble steps\nof a peristyle, but by the branches of a lime-tree; and the angel with\na flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his\ncelestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the\nPrince de Marsillac.\"\n\nAramis burst into a fit of laughter.\n\n\"You were always a merry companion, my dear D'Artagnan,\" he said, \"and\nyour witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you. Yes, there is something\nin what you say; nevertheless, do not believe that it is Madame de\nLongueville with whom I am in love.\"\n\n\"A plague on't! I shall not do so. After having been so long in love\nwith Madame de Chevreuse, you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of\nher mortal enemy!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Aramis, with an absent air; \"yes, that poor duchess! I\nonce loved her much, and to do her justice, she was very useful to us.\nEventually she was obliged to leave France. He was a relentless enemy,\nthat damned cardinal,\" continued Aramis, glancing at the portrait of the\nold minister. \"He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut\noff her head had she not escaped with her waiting-maid--poor Kitty! I\nhave heard that she met with a strange adventure in I don't know what\nvillage, with I don't know what cure, of whom she asked hospitality and\nwho, having but one chamber, and taking her for a cavalier, offered to\nshare it with her. For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man,\nthat dear Marie; I know only one other woman who can do it as well.\nSo they made this song about her: 'Laboissiere, dis moi.' You know it,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"No, sing it, please.\"\n\nAramis immediately complied, and sang the song in a very lively manner.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you sing charmingly, dear Aramis. I do not\nperceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice.\"\n\n\"My dear D'Artagnan,\" replied Aramis, \"you understand, when I was a\nmusketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbe I\nsay as few masses as I can. But to return to our duchess.\"\n\n\"Which--the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville?\"\n\n\"Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the\nDuchess de Longueville? Little flirtations, perhaps, and that's all. No,\nI spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse; did you see her after her return\nfrom Brussels, after the king's death?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is still beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"I saw her also at that time. I gave her good\nadvice, by which she did not profit. I ventured to tell her that Mazarin\nwas the lover of Anne of Austria. She wouldn't believe me, saying that\nshe knew Anne of Austria, who was too proud to love such a worthless\ncoxcomb. After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of\nBeaufort; and the 'coxcomb' arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de\nChevreuse.\"\n\n\"You know,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"that she has had leave to return to\nFrance?\"\n\n\"Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or\nanother.\"\n\n\"Oh, but this time perhaps she will follow your advice.\"\n\n\"Oh, this time,\" returned Aramis, \"I haven't seen her; she is much\nchanged.\"\n\n\"In that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same;\nyou have still your beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure,\nstill your feminine hands, which are admirably suited to a prelate.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Aramis, \"I am extremely careful of my appearance. Do you\nknow that I am growing old? I am nearly thirty-seven.\"\n\n\"Mind, Aramis\"--D'Artagnan smiled as he spoke--\"since we are together\nagain, let us agree on one point: what age shall we be in future?\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Formerly I was your junior by two or three years, and if I am not\nmistaken I am turned forty years old.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Then 'tis I who am mistaken, for you have always been a good\nchronologist. By your reckoning I must be forty-three at least. The\ndevil I am! Don't let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet; it would ruin\nme,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said D'Artagnan. \"I never go there.\"\n\n\"Why, what in the world,\" cried Aramis, \"is that animal Bazin doing?\nBazin! Hurry up there, you rascal; we are mad with hunger and thirst!\"\n\nBazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand.\n\n\"At last,\" said Aramis, \"we are ready, are we?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, quite ready,\" said Bazin; \"but it took me some time to\nbring up all the----\"\n\n\"Because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle's robe,\nand spend all your time reading your breviary. But I give you warning\nthat if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up\nmy sword, I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see\nthat you are roasted on it.\"\n\nBazin, scandalized, made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his\nhand. D'Artagnan, more surprised than ever at the tone and manners\nof the Abbe d'Herblay, which contrasted so strongly with those of the\nMusketeer Aramis, remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of\nhis friend.\n\nBazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it\nso many things, gilded, perfumed, appetizing, that D'Artagnan was quite\novercome.\n\n\"But you expected some one then?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Aramis, \"I always try to be prepared; and then I knew you\nwere seeking me.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"From Master Bazin, to be sure; he took you for the devil, my dear\nfellow, and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if\nI should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" said Bazin, clasping his hands supplicatingly.\n\n\"Come, no hypocrisy! you know that I don't like it. You will do much\nbetter to open the window and let down some bread, a chicken and a\nbottle of wine to your friend Planchet, who has been this last hour\nkilling himself clapping his hands.\"\n\nPlanchet, in fact, had bedded and fed his horses, and then coming back\nunder the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon.\n\nBazin obeyed, fastened to the end of a cord the three articles\ndesignated and let them down to Planchet, who then went satisfied to his\nshed.\n\n\"Now to supper,\" said Aramis.\n\nThe two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls, partridges\nand hams with admirable skill.\n\n\"The deuce!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"do you live in this way always?\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty well. The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting\non the jours maigres, on account of my health; then I have engaged as\nmy cook the cook who lived with Lafollone--you know the man I mean?--the\nfriend of the cardinal, and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner\nused to be, 'Good Lord, do me the favor to cause me to digest what I\nhave eaten.'\"\n\n\"Nevertheless he died of indigestion, in spite of his grace,\" said\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"What can you expect?\" replied Aramis, in a tone of resignation. \"Every\nman that's born must fulfil his destiny.\"\n\n\"If it be not an indelicate question,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"have you\ngrown rich?\"\n\n\"Oh, Heaven! no. I make about twelve thousand francs a year, without\ncounting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me.\"\n\n\"And how do you make your twelve thousand francs? By your poems?\"\n\n\"No, I have given up poetry, except now and then to write a drinking\nsong, some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram; I compose sermons, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"What! sermons? Do you preach them?\"\n\n\"No; I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation\nyourself?\"\n\n\"I should, my dear D'Artagnan, have been so, but nature said 'No.' When\nI am in the pulpit, if by chance a pretty woman looks at me, I look at\nher again: if she smiles, I smile too. Then I speak at random; instead\nof preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise.\nAn event took place in the Church of St. Louis au Marais. A gentleman\nlaughed in my face. I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool; the\ncongregation went out to get stones to stone me with, but whilst they\nwere away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present, so\nthat my foe was pelted instead of me. 'Tis true that he came the next\nmorning to my house, thinking that he had to do with an abbe--like all\nother abbes.\"\n\n\"And what was the end of the affair?\"\n\n\"We met in the Place Royale--Egad! you know about it.\"\n\n\"Was I not your second?\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You were; you know how I settled the matter.\"\n\n\"Did he die?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But, at all events, I gave him absolution in articulo\nmortis. 'Tis enough to kill the body, without killing the soul.\"\n\nBazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved\nthe moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered.\n\n\"Bazin, my friend,\" said Aramis, \"you don't seem to be aware that I\ncan see you in that mirror, and you forget that once for all I have\nforbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation. You will do me the\nfavor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw. Besides, my\nfriend D'Artagnan has something to say to me privately, have you not,\nD'Artagnan?\"\n\nD'Artagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired, after placing on the table\nthe Spanish wine.\n\nThe two friends, left alone, remained silent, face to face. Aramis\nseemed to await a comfortable digestion; D'Artagnan, to be preparing his\nexordium. Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly\nglance. It was Aramis who broke the silence.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?\" he began.\n\n\"I was thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you\nturned your thoughts incessantly to the church, and now that you are an\nabbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer.\"\n\n\"'Tis true; man, as you know,\" said Aramis, \"is a strange animal, made\nup of contradictions. Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but\nbattles.\"\n\n\"That is apparent in your surroundings; you have rapiers here of every\nform and to suit the most exacting taste. Do you still fence well?\"\n\n\"I--I fence as well as you did in the old time--better still, perhaps; I\ndo nothing else all day.\"\n\n\"And with whom?\"\n\n\"With an excellent master-at-arms that we have here.\"\n\n\"What! here?\"\n\n\"Yes, here, in this convent, my dear fellow. There is everything in a\nJesuit convent.\"\n\n\"Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone\nto attack you, instead of at the head of twenty men?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Aramis, \"and even at the head of his twenty men, if\nI could have drawn without being recognized.\"\n\n\"God pardon me!\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I believe he has become\nmore Gascon than I am!\" Then aloud: \"Well, my dear Aramis, do you ask me\nwhy I came to seek you?\"\n\n\"No, I have not asked you that,\" said Aramis, with his subtle manner;\n\"but I have expected you to tell me.\"\n\n\"Well, I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to\nkill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please, prince though he is.\"\n\n\"Hold on! wait!\" said Aramis; \"that is an idea!\"\n\n\"Of which I invite you to take advantage, my friend. Let us see; with\nyour thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you\nmake by selling sermons, are you rich? Answer frankly.\"\n\n\"I? I am as poor as Job, and were you to search my pockets and my boxes\nI don't believe you would find a hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"Peste! a hundred pistoles!\" said D'Artagnan to himself; \"he calls that\nbeing as poor as Job! If I had them I should think myself as rich as\nCroesus.\" Then aloud: \"Are you ambitious?\"\n\n\"As Enceladus.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, I bring you the means of becoming rich, powerful, and\nfree to do whatever you wish.\"\n\nThe shadow of a cloud passed over Aramis's face as quickly as that which\nin August passes over the field of grain; but quick as it was, it did\nnot escape D'Artagnan's observation.\n\n\"Speak on,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"One question first. Do you take any interest in politics?\"\n\nA gleam of light shone in Aramis's eyes, as brief as the shadow that\nhad passed over his face, but not so brief but that it was seen by\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"No,\" Aramis replied.\n\n\"Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you, since for the\nmoment you have no master but God?\"\n\n\"It is possible.\"\n\n\"Have you, my dear Aramis, thought sometimes of those happy, happy,\nhappy days of youth we passed laughing, drinking, and fighting each\nother for play?\"\n\n\"Certainly, and more than once regretted them; it was indeed a glorious\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well, those splendidly wild days may chance to come again; I am\ncommissioned to find out my companions and I began by you, who were the\nvery soul of our society.\"\n\nAramis bowed, rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment.\n\n\"To meddle in politics,\" he exclaimed, in a languid voice, leaning back\nin his easy-chair. \"Ah! dear D'Artagnan! see how regularly I live and\nhow easy I am here. We have experienced the ingratitude of 'the great,'\nas you well know.\"\n\n\"'Tis true,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Yet the great sometimes repent of\ntheir ingratitude.\"\n\n\"In that case it would be quite another thing. Come! let's be merciful\nto every sinner! Besides, you are right in another respect, which is\nin thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a\nbetter time than the present.\"\n\n\"How can you know that? You who never interest yourself in politics?\"\n\n\"Ah! without caring about them myself, I live among those who are much\noccupied in them. Poet as I am, I am intimate with Sarazin, who is\ndevoted to the Prince de Conti, and with Monsieur de Bois-Robert, who,\nsince the death of Cardinal Richelieu, is of all parties or any party;\nso that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to\nme.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Now, my dear friend, look upon all I tell you as merely the statement\nof a monk--of a man who resembles an echo--repeating simply what he\nhears. I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy\nas to the state of affairs; that his orders are not respected like those\nof our former bugbear, the deceased cardinal, whose portrait as you see\nhangs yonder--for whatever may be thought of him, it must be allowed\nthat Richelieu was great.\"\n\n\"I will not contradict you there,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"My first impressions were favorable to the minister; I said to myself\nthat a minister is never loved, but that with the genius this one was\nsaid to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make\nhimself feared, which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to\nbe loved----\"\n\nD'Artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely\napproved that doubtful maxim.\n\n\"This, then,\" continued Aramis, \"was my first opinion; but as I am very\nignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess\nobliges me not to rest on my own judgment, but to ask the opinion of\nothers, I have inquired--Eh!--my friend----\"\n\nAramis paused.\n\n\"Well? what?\" asked his friend.\n\n\"Well, I must mortify myself. I must confess that I was mistaken.\nMonsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius, as I thought, he is a man\nof no origin--once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio, and he got on by\nintrigue. He is an upstart, a man of no name, who will only be the tool\nof a party in France. He will amass wealth, he will injure the king's\nrevenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others.\nHe is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling, but a sort of\nbuffoon, a punchinello, a pantaloon. Do you know him? I do not.\"\n\n\"Hem!\" said D'Artagnan, \"there is some truth in what you say.\"\n\n\"Ah! it fills me with pride to find that, thanks to a common sort of\npenetration with which I am endowed, I am approved by a man like you,\nfresh from the court.\"\n\n\"But you speak of him, not of his party, his resources.\"\n\n\"It is true--the queen is for him.\"\n\n\"Something in his favor.\"\n\n\"But he will never have the king.\"\n\n\"A mere child.\"\n\n\"A child who will be of age in four years. Then he has neither the\nparliament nor the people with him--they represent the wealth of the\ncountry; nor the nobles nor the princes, who are the military power of\nFrance.\"\n\nD'Artagnan scratched his ear. He was forced to confess to himself that\nthis reasoning was not only comprehensive, but just.\n\n\"You see, my poor friend, that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary\nthoughtfulness; perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you, who have\nevidently a leaning to Mazarin.\"\n\n\"I!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"not in the least.\"\n\n\"You spoke of a mission.\"\n\n\"Did I? I was wrong then, no, I said what you say--there is a crisis at\nhand. Well! let's fly the feather before the wind; let us join with that\nside to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life. We\nwere once four valiant knights--four hearts fondly united; let us unite\nagain, not our hearts, which have never been severed, but our courage\nand our fortunes. Here's a good opportunity for getting something better\nthan a diamond.\"\n\n\"You are right, D'Artagnan; I held a similar project, but as I had not\nnor ever shall have your fruitful, vigorous imagination, the idea was\nsuggested to me. Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries; propositions have\nbeen made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made\nme speak out.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Gondy! the cardinal's enemy?\"\n\n\"No; the king's friend,\" said Aramis; \"the king's friend, you\nunderstand. Well, it is a question of serving the king, the gentleman's\nduty.\"\n\n\"But the king is with Mazarin.\"\n\n\"He is, but not willingly; in appearance, not heart; and that is exactly\nthe snare the king's enemies are preparing for the poor child.\"\n\n\"Ah! but this is, indeed, civil war which you propose to me, dear\nAramis.\"\n\n\"War for the king.\"\n\n\"Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarin's side.\"\n\n\"But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beaufort.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Beaufort? He is at Vincennes.\"\n\n\"Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort? Monsieur de Beaufort or another.\nMonsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince.\"\n\n\"But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army; he is entirely\ndevoted to the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Oh oh!\" said Aramis, \"there are questions between them at this\nvery moment. And besides, if it is not the prince, then Monsieur de\nGondy----\"\n\n\"But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal; they are soliciting the\nhat for him.\"\n\n\"And are there no cardinals that can fight? Come now, recall the four\ncardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant\nand Monsieur de Gassion.\"\n\n\"But a humpbacked general!\n\n\"Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen. Besides, remember that\nAlexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye.\"\n\n\"Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party?\" asked\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"I foresee in it the aid of powerful princes.\"\n\n\"With the enmity of the government.\"\n\n\"Counteracted by parliament and insurrections.\"\n\n\"That may be done if they can separate the king from his mother.\"\n\n\"That may be done,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Never!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"You, Aramis, know Anne of Austria better\nthan I do. Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her\nsafeguard, her shield, the pledge for her dignity, for her fortune and\nher life? Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over\nto the princes' side; but you know better than I do that there are\ncertain reasons why she can never abandon Mazarin.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said Aramis, thoughtfully; \"therefore I shall\nnot pledge myself.\"\n\n\"To them or to us, do you mean, Aramis?\"\n\n\"To no one. I am a priest,\" resumed Aramis. \"What have I to do with\npolitics? I am not obliged to read any breviary. I have a jolly little\ncircle of witty abbes and pretty women; everything goes on smoothly, so\ncertainly, dear friend, I shall not meddle in politics.\"\n\n\"Well, listen, my dear Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan; \"your philosophy\nconvinces me, on my honor. I don't know what devil of an insect stung\nme and made me ambitious. I have a post by which I live; at the death\nof Monsieur de Treville, who is old, I may be a captain, which is a\nvery snug berth for a once penniless Gascon. Instead of running after\nadventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos; I shall go and\nshoot on his estate. You know he has estates--Porthos?\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed. Ten leagues of wood, of marsh land and\nvalleys; he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a\nsuit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon!\"\n\n\"Good,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"That's what I wanted to know.\nPorthos is in Picardy.\"\n\nThen aloud:\n\n\"And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon?\"\n\n\"To which he adds that of Bracieux, an estate which has been a barony,\nby my troth.\"\n\n\"So that Porthos will be a baron.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it. The 'Baroness Porthos' will sound particularly\ncharming.\"\n\nAnd the two friends began to laugh.\n\n\"So,\" D'Artagnan resumed, \"you will not become a partisan of Mazarin's?\"\n\n\"Nor you of the Prince de Conde?\"\n\n\"No, let us belong to no party, but remain friends; let us be neither\nCardinalists nor Frondists.\"\n\n\"Adieu, then.\" And D'Artagnan poured out a glass of wine.\n\n\"To old times,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Aramis. \"Unhappily, those times are past.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! They will return,\" said D'Artagnan. \"At all events, if you\nwant me, remember the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette.\"\n\n\"And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits; from six in the morning to\neight at night come by the door. From eight in the evening until six in\nthe morning come in by the window.\"\n\n\"Adieu, dear friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't let you go so! I will go with you.\" And he took his sword\nand cloak.\n\n\"He wants to be sure that I go away,\" said D'Artagnan to himself.\n\nAramis whistled for Bazin, but Bazin was asleep in the ante-chamber, and\nAramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him.\n\nBazin stretched his arms, rubbed his eyes, and tried to go to sleep\nagain.\n\n\"Come, come, sleepy head; quick, the ladder!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Bazin, yawning portentously, \"the ladder is still at the\nwindow.\"\n\n\"The other one, the gardener's. Didn't you see that Monsieur d'Artagnan\nmounted with difficulty? It will be even more difficult to descend.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily, when\nan idea came into his head which silenced him.\n\nBazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder.\nPresently a good, solid, wooden ladder was placed against the window.\n\n\"Now then,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is something like; this is a means of\ncommunication. A woman could go up a ladder like that.\"\n\nAramis's searching look seemed to seek his friend's thought even at the\nbottom of his heart, but D'Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an\nair of admirable simplicity. Besides, at that moment he put his foot on\nthe first step of the ladder and began his descent. In a moment he was\non the ground. Bazin remained at the window.\n\n\"Stay there,\" said Aramis; \"I shall return immediately.\"\n\nThe two friends went toward the shed. At their approach Planchet came\nout leading the two horses.\n\n\"That is good to see,\" said Aramis. \"There is a servant active and\nvigilant, not like that lazy fellow Bazin, who is no longer good for\nanything since he became connected with the church. Follow us, Planchet;\nwe shall continue our conversation to the end of the village.\"\n\nThey traversed the width of the village, talking of indifferent things,\nthen as they reached the last houses:\n\n\"Go, then, dear friend,\" said Aramis, \"follow your own career. Fortune\nlavishes her smiles upon you; do not let her flee from your embrace. As\nfor me, I remain in my humility and indolence. Adieu!\"\n\n\"Thus 'tis quite decided,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that what I have to offer\nto you does not tempt you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it would tempt me were I any other man,\" rejoined\nAramis; \"but I repeat, I am made up of contradictions. What I hate\nto-day I adore to-morrow, and vice versa. You see that I cannot, like\nyou, for instance, settle on any fixed plan.\"\n\n\"Thou liest, subtile one,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"Thou alone,\non the contrary, knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it\nstealthily.\"\n\nThe friends embraced. They descended into the plain by the ladder.\nPlanchet met them hard by the shed. D'Artagnan jumped into the saddle,\nthen the old companions in arms again shook hands. D'Artagnan and\nPlanchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris.\n\nBut after he had gone about two hundred steps D'Artagnan stopped short,\nalighted, threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and\ntook the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"This is the matter: be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his\ndupe. Stand here, don't stir, turn your back to the road and wait for\nme.\"\n\nHaving thus spoken, D'Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and\ncrossed the plain so as to wind around the village. He had observed\nbetween the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent\nof the Jesuits, an open space surrounded by a hedge.\n\nThe moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road.\n\nHe reached the hedge and hid himself behind it; in passing by the house\nwhere the scene which we have related took place, he remarked that the\nwindow was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not\nyet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be\nalone.\n\nIn truth, in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers.\n\nClose to the hedge the steps stopped.\n\nD'Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge.\n\nTwo men, to the astonishment of D'Artagnan, appeared shortly; soon,\nhowever, his surprise vanished, for he heard the murmurs of a soft,\nharmonious voice; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a\ncavalier.\n\n\"Calm yourself, dear Rene,\" said the soft voice, \"the same thing will\nnever happen again. I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage\nwhich runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the\nmarble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" answered another voice, which D'Artagnan instantly recognized as\nthat of Aramis. \"I swear to you, princess, that if your reputation did\nnot depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the\nworld, but you do not belong to me alone; you belong to all our party.\nBe prudent! sensible!\"\n\n\"I always obey, madame, when I am commanded by so gentle a voice.\"\n\nHe kissed her hand tenderly.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat?\"\n\nAramis rushed after the fugitive hat. D'Artagnan took advantage of the\ncircumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick, where his glance\ncould penetrate to the supposed cavalier. At that instant, the moon,\ninquisitive, perhaps, like D'Artagnan, came from behind a cloud and by\nher light D'Artagnan recognized the large blue eyes, the golden hair and\nthe classic head of the Duchess de Longueville.\n\nAramis returned, laughing, one hat on his head and the other in his\nhand; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent.\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan, rising and brushing his knees; \"now I have\nthee--thou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville.\"\n\n\n\n\n10. Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.\n\n\n\nThanks to what Aramis had told him, D'Artagnan, who knew already that\nPorthos called himself Du Vallon, was now aware that he styled himself,\nfrom his estate, De Bracieux; and that he was, on account of this\nestate, engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon. It was, then, in\nthe neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate. His itinerary\nwas promptly determined: he would go to Dammartin, from which place two\nroads diverge, one toward Soissons, the other toward Compiegne; there he\nwould inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to\nthe left according to the information obtained.\n\nPlanchet, who was still a little concerned for his safety after his\nrecent escapade, declared that he would follow D'Artagnan even to the\nend of the world, either by the road to the right or by that to the\nleft; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening, for\ngreater security to himself. D'Artagnan suggested that he should send\nword to his wife, so that she might not be anxious about him, but\nPlanchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would\nnot die of anxiety through not knowing where he was, while he, Planchet,\nremembering her incontinence of tongue, would die of anxiety if she did\nknow.\n\nThis reasoning seemed to D'Artagnan so satisfactory that he no further\ninsisted; and about eight o'clock in the evening, the time when the\nvapors of night begin to thicken in the streets, he left the Hotel de la\nChevrette, and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of\nthe Saint Denis gate.\n\nAt midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin, but it was then too\nlate to make inquiries--the host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to\nbed.\n\nThe next morning D'Artagnan summoned the host, one of those sly Normans\nwho say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a\ndirect answer. D'Artagnan, however, gathered from his equivocal replies\nthat the road to the right was the one he ought to take, and on that\nuncertain information he resumed his journey. At nine in the morning\nhe reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast. His host here was a good\nfellow from Picardy, who gave him all the information he needed. The\nBracieux estate was a few leagues from Villars-Cotterets.\n\nD'Artagnan was acquainted with Villars-Cotterets, having gone thither\nwith the court on several occasions; for at that time Villars-Cotterets\nwas a royal residence. He therefore shaped his course toward that\nplace and dismounted at the Dauphin d'Or. There he ascertained that the\nBracieux estate was four leagues distant, but that Porthos was not at\nBracieux. Porthos had, in fact, been involved in a dispute with the\nBishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property, which adjoined\nhis own, and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his\ncomprehension, he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added\nthat name to his others. He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de\nPierrefonds, and resided on his new estate.\n\nThe travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next\nday; the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest. It is\ntrue they might have taken others, but there was a great forest to pass\nthrough and Planchet, as we have seen, had no liking for forests after\ndark.\n\nThere was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was\nstarting on a journey with a hungry stomach. Accordingly, D'Artagnan, on\nawaking, found his breakfast waiting for him. It need not be said\nthat Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former\nhumility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by\nD'Artagnan.\n\nIt was nearly eight o'clock when they set out again. Their course was\nclearly defined: they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on\nemerging from the forest turn to the right.\n\nThe morning was beautiful, and in this early springtime the birds sang\non the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades, like\ncurtains of golden gauze.\n\nIn other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through\nthe foliage, and the stems of two old oak trees, the refuge of the\nsquirrel, startled by the travelers, were in deep shadow.\n\nThere came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs,\nflowers and leaves, which delighted the heart. D'Artagnan, sick of\nthe closeness of Paris, thought that when a man had three names of his\ndifferent estates joined one to another, he ought to be very happy in\nsuch a paradise; then he shook his head, saying, \"If I were Porthos and\nD'Artagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to\nhim, I know what I should say to it.\"\n\nAs to Planchet, he thought of little or nothing, but was happy as a\nhunting-hound in his old master's company.\n\nAt the extremity of the wood D'Artagnan perceived the road that had been\ndescribed to him, and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an\nimmense feudal castle.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" he said, \"I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient\nbranch of Orleans. Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de\nLongueville?\"\n\n\"Faith!\" exclaimed Planchet, \"here's land in good condition; if it\nbelongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"don't call him Porthos, nor even Vallon;\ncall him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds; thou wilt knell out damnation to\nmy mission otherwise.\"\n\nAs he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye,\nD'Artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend\ndwelt; the towers, though solid and as if built yesterday, were open\nand broken. One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with\nblows from a hatchet.\n\nOn arriving at the extremity of the castle D'Artagnan found himself\noverlooking a beautiful valley, in which, at the foot of a charming\nlittle lake, stood several scattered houses, which, humble in their\naspect, and covered, some with tiles, others with thatch, seemed to\nacknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau, built about the\nbeginning of the reign of Henry IV., and surmounted by four stately,\ngilded weather-cocks. D'Artagnan no longer doubted that this was\nPorthos's pleasant dwelling place.\n\nThe road led straight up to the chateau which, compared to its ancestor\non the hill, was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc d'Enghein\nwould have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles\nVII. D'Artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road, followed by\nPlanchet at the same pace.\n\nIn ten minutes D'Artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted\nwith fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate, the points and\ncrossed bars of which were gilt. In the midst of this avenue was a\nnobleman, dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the\niron gate, riding on a tall horse. On his right hand and his left were\ntwo footmen, with the seams of their dresses laced. A considerable\nnumber of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord.\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de\nBracieux de Pierrefonds? Well-a-day! how he has shrunk since he gave up\nthe name of Porthos!\"\n\n\"This cannot be Monsieur Porthos,\" observed Planchet replying, as it\nwere, to his master's thoughts. \"Monsieur Porthos was six feet high;\nthis man is scarcely five.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said D'Artagnan, \"the people are bowing very low to this\nperson.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he rode toward the tall horse--to the man of importance and\nhis valets. As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this\nindividual.\n\n\"Jesu!\" cried Planchet, \"can it be?\"\n\nAt this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty\nair, and the two travelers could see, displayed in all their\nbrilliancy, the large eyes, the vermilion visage, and the eloquent smile\nof--Mousqueton.\n\nIt was indeed Mousqueton--Mousqueton, as fat as a pig, rolling about\nwith rude health, puffed out with good living, who, recognizing\nD'Artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin, slipped\noff his horse and approached the officer with his hat off, so that the\nhomage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun, which\neclipsed the former luminary.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan! Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried Mousqueton, his fat\ncheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy; \"Monsieur\nd'Artagnan! oh! what joy for my lord and master, Du Vallon de Bracieux\nde Pierrefonds!\"\n\n\"Thou good Mousqueton! where is thy master?\"\n\n\"You stand upon his property!\"\n\n\"But how handsome thou art--how fat! thou hast prospered and grown\nstout!\" and D'Artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change\ngood fortune had produced on the once famished one.\n\n\"Hey, yes, thank God, I am pretty well,\" said Mousqueton.\n\n\"But hast thou nothing to say to thy friend Planchet?\"\n\n\"How, my friend Planchet? Planchet--art thou there?\" cried Mousqueton,\nwith open arms and eyes full of tears.\n\n\"My very self,\" replied Planchet; \"but I wanted first to see if thou\nwert grown proud.\"\n\n\"Proud toward an old friend? never, Planchet! thou wouldst not have\nthought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well.\"\n\n\"So far so well,\" answered Planchet, alighting, and extending his arms\nto Mousqueton, the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched\nthose who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a\ngreat lord in disguise, so highly did they estimate the position of\nMousqueton.\n\n\"And now, sir,\" resumed Mousqueton, when he had rid himself of Planchet,\nwho had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend's fat back,\n\"now, sir, allow me to leave you, for I could not permit my master to\nhear of your arrival from any but myself; he would never forgive me for\nnot having preceded you.\"\n\n\"This dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, carefully avoiding to utter either\nthe former name borne by Porthos or his new one, \"then he has not\nforgotten me?\"\n\n\"Forgotten--he!\" cried Mousqueton; \"there's not a day, sir, that we\ndon't expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of\nMonsieur de Gassion, or of Monsieur de Bassompierre.\"\n\nOn D'Artagnan's lips there played one of those rare and melancholy\nsmiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul--the last\ntrace of youth and happiness that had survived life's disillusions.\n\n\"And you--fellows,\" resumed Mousqueton, \"stay near Monsieur le Comte\nd'Artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to\nprepare my lord for his visit.\"\n\nAnd mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass\nat a hand gallop.\n\n\"Ah, there! there's something promising,\" said D'Artagnan. \"No\nmysteries, no cloak to hide one's self in, no cunning policy here;\npeople laugh outright, they weep for joy here. I see nothing but faces a\nyard broad; in short, it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday\ngarb, and that the trees, instead of leaves and flowers, are covered\nwith red and green ribbons as on gala days.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said Planchet, \"I seem to smell, from this place, even, a\nmost delectable perfume of fine roast meat, and to see the scullions\nin a row by the hedge, hailing our approach. Ah! sir, what a cook must\nMonsieur Pierrefonds have, when he was so fond of eating and drinking,\neven whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos!\"\n\n\"Say no more!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"If the reality corresponds with\nappearances I am lost; for a man so well off will never change his\nhappy condition, and I shall fail with him, as I have already done with\nAramis.\"\n\n\n\n\n11. How D'Artagnan, in discovering the Retreat of Porthos, perceives\nthat Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the\nchateau. He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps. Let us\ndo justice to D'Artagnan. Independently of every selfish wish, his heart\npalpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor,\nwhich recalled to him a good and brave man.\n\nHe ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms; the whole body of\nservants, arranged in a semi-circle at a respectful distance, looked on\nwith humble curiosity. Mousqueton, at the head of them, wiped his eyes.\nPorthos linked his arm in that of his friend.\n\n\"Ah! how delightful to see you again, dear friend!\" he cried, in a voice\nwhich was now changed from a baritone into a bass, \"you've not then\nforgotten me?\"\n\n\"Forget you! oh! dear Du Vallon, does one forget the happiest days\nof flowery youth, one's dearest friends, the dangers we have dared\ntogether? On the contrary, there is not an hour we have passed together\nthat is not present to my memory.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Porthos, trying to give to his mustache a curl which it\nhad lost whilst he had been alone. \"Yes, we did some fine things in our\ntime and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel.\"\n\nAnd he heaved a sigh.\n\n\"Under any circumstances,\" he resumed, \"you are welcome, my dear friend;\nyou will help me to recover my spirits; to-morrow we will hunt the hare\non my plain, which is a superb tract of land, or pursue the deer in my\nwoods, which are magnificent. I have four harriers which are considered\nthe swiftest in the county, and a pack of hounds which are unequalled\nfor twenty leagues around.\"\n\nAnd Porthos heaved another sigh.\n\n\"But, first,\" interposed D'Artagnan, \"you must present me to Madame du\nVallon.\"\n\nA third sigh from Porthos.\n\n\"I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago,\" he said, \"and you find me still\nin affliction on that account. That was the reason why I left my Chateau\ndu Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux. Poor Madame\ndu Vallon! her temper was uncertain, but she came at last to accustom\nherself to my little ways and understand my little wishes.\"\n\n\"So you are free now, and rich?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" groaned Porthos, \"I am a widower and have forty thousand francs\na year. Let us go to breakfast.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to do so; the morning air has made me hungry.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos; \"my air is excellent.\"\n\nThey went into the chateau; there was nothing but gilding, high and low;\nthe cornices were gilt, the mouldings were gilt, the legs and arms of\nthe chairs were gilt. A table, ready set out, awaited them.\n\n\"You see,\" said Porthos, \"this is my usual style.\"\n\n\"Devil take me!\" answered D'Artagnan, \"I wish you joy of it. The king\nhas nothing like it.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Porthos, \"I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the\ncardinal, Monsieur de Mazarin. Taste this cutlet, my dear D'Artagnan;\n'tis off one of my sheep.\"\n\n\"You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it.\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, the sheep are fed in my meadows, which are excellent pasture.\"\n\n\"Give me another cutlet.\"\n\n\"No, try this hare, which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens.\"\n\n\"Zounds! what a flavor!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"ah! they are fed on thyme\nonly, your hares.\"\n\n\"And how do you like my wine?\" asked Porthos; \"it is pleasant, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Capital!\"\n\n\"It is nothing, however, but a wine of the country.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, a small declivity to the south, yonder on my hill, gives me twenty\nhogsheads.\"\n\n\"Quite a vineyard, hey?\"\n\nPorthos sighed for the fifth time--D'Artagnan had counted his sighs. He\nbecame curious to solve the problem.\n\n\"Well now,\" he said, \"it seems, my dear friend, that something vexes\nyou; you are ill, perhaps? That health, which----\"\n\n\"Excellent, my dear friend; better than ever. I could kill an ox with a\nblow of my fist.\"\n\n\"Well, then, family affairs, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Family! I have, happily, only myself in the world to care for.\"\n\n\"But what makes you sigh?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" replied Porthos, \"to be candid with you, I am not\nhappy.\"\n\n\"You are not happy, Porthos? You who have chateau, meadows, mountains,\nwoods--you who have forty thousand francs a year--you--are--not--happy?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, all those things I have, but I am a hermit in the midst\nof superfluity.\"\n\n\"Surrounded, I suppose, only by clodhoppers, with whom you could not\nassociate.\"\n\nPorthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine.\n\n\"No; but just think, there are paltry country squires who have all some\ntitle or another and pretend to go back as far as Charlemagne, or at\nleast to Hugh Capet. When I first came here; being the last comer, it\nwas for me to make the first advances. I made them, but you know, my\ndear friend, Madame du Vallon----\"\n\nPorthos, in pronouncing these words, seemed to gulp down something.\n\n\"Madame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility. She had, in her first\nmarriage--I don't think, D'Artagnan, I am telling you anything\nnew--married a lawyer; they thought that 'nauseous;' you can understand\nthat's a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men. I have\nkilled two, which has made people hold their tongues, but has not made\nme their friend. So that I have no society; I live alone; I am sick of\nit--my mind preys on itself.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled. He now saw where the breastplate was weak, and\nprepared the blow.\n\n\"But now,\" he said, \"that you are a widower, your wife's connection\ncannot injure you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but understand me; not being of a race of historic fame, like the\nDe Courcys, who were content to be plain sirs, or the Rohans, who didn't\nwish to be dukes, all these people, who are all either vicomtes or\ncomtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies, and I can say\nnothing to them. Ah! If I only were a----\"\n\n\"A baron, don't you mean?\" cried D'Artagnan, finishing his friend's\nsentence.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Porthos; \"would I were but a baron!\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, I am come to give you this very title which you wish\nfor so much.\"\n\nPorthos gave a start that shook the room; two or three bottles fell and\nwere broken. Mousqueton ran thither, hearing the noise.\n\nPorthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles.\n\n\"I am glad to see,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that you have still that honest\nlad with you.\"\n\n\"He is my steward,\" replied Porthos; \"he will never leave me. Go away\nnow, Mouston.\"\n\n\"So he's called Mouston,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"'tis too long a word to\npronounce 'Mousqueton.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said aloud, \"let us resume our conversation later, your\npeople may suspect something; there may be spies about. You can suppose,\nPorthos, that what I have to say relates to most important matters.\"\n\n\"Devil take them; let us walk in the park,\" answered Porthos, \"for the\nsake of digestion.\"\n\n\"Egad,\" said D'Artagnan, \"the park is like everything else and there\nare as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren; you are a happy\nman, my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase,\nbut acquired that of fishing.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Porthos, \"I leave fishing to Mousqueton,--it is a\nvulgar pleasure,--but I shoot sometimes; that is to say, when I am dull,\nand I sit on one of those marble seats, have my gun brought to me, my\nfavorite dog, and I shoot rabbits.\"\n\n\"Really, how very amusing!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Porthos, with a sigh, \"it is amusing.\"\n\nD'Artagnan now no longer counted the sighs. They were innumerable.\n\n\"However, what had you to say to me?\" he resumed; \"let us return to that\nsubject.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"I must, however, first frankly\ntell you that you must change your mode of life.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Go into harness again, gird on your sword, run after adventures, and\nleave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside.\"\n\n\"Ah! hang it!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I see you are spoiled, dear friend; you are corpulent, your arm has no\nlonger that movement of which the late cardinal's guards have so many\nproofs.\"\n\n\"Ah! my fist is strong enough I swear,\" cried Porthos, extending a hand\nlike a shoulder of mutton.\n\n\"So much the better.\"\n\n\"Are we then to go to war?\"\n\n\"By my troth, yes.\"\n\n\"Against whom?\"\n\n\"Are you a politician, friend?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Are you for Mazarin or for the princes?\"\n\n\"I am for no one.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you are for us. Well, I tell you that I come to you\nfrom the cardinal.\"\n\nThis speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still\nbeen in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal.\n\n\"Ho! ho! What are the wishes of his eminence?\"\n\n\"He wishes to have you in his service.\"\n\n\"And who spoke to him of me?\"\n\n\"Rochefort--you remember him?\"\n\n\"Yes, pardieu! It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on\nthe road so much; you gave him three sword-wounds in three separate\nengagements.\"\n\n\"But you know he is now our friend?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't know that. So he cherishes no resentment?\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan. \"It is I who cherish no\nresentment.\"\n\nPorthos didn't understand any too clearly; but then we know that\nunderstanding was not his strong point. \"You say, then,\" he continued,\n\"that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the queen, too.\"\n\n\"The queen, do you say?\"\n\n\"To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarin's hands\nthat famous diamond--you remember all about it--that I once sold to\nMonsieur des Essarts and of which, I don't know how, she has regained\npossession.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me,\" said Porthos, \"that she would have done much\nbetter if she had given it back to you.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"but kings and queens are strange\nbeings and have odd fancies; nevertheless, since they are the ones who\nhave riches and honors, we are devoted to them.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are devoted to them,\" repeated Porthos; \"and you--to whom are\nyou devoted now?\"\n\n\"To the king, the queen, and to the cardinal; moreover, I have answered\nfor your devotion also.\"\n\n\"And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf?\"\n\n\"Magnificent, my dear fellow, magnificent! In the first place you have\nplenty of money, haven't you? forty thousand francs income, I think you\nsaid.\"\n\nPorthos began to be suspicious. \"Eh! my friend,\" said he, \"one never has\ntoo much money. Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder; I am not\nmuch of a hand at figures, so that I live almost from hand to mouth.\"\n\n\"He is afraid I have come to borrow money,\" thought D'Artagnan. \"Ah, my\nfriend,\" said he, \"it is all the better if you are in difficulties.\"\n\n\"How is it all the better?\"\n\n\"Yes, for his eminence will give you all that you want--land, money, and\ntitles.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! ah!\" said Porthos, opening his eyes at that last word.\n\n\"Under the other cardinal,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"we didn't know enough\nto make our profits; this, however, doesn't concern you, with your forty\nthousand francs income, the happiest man in the world, it seems to me.\"\n\nPorthos sighed.\n\n\"At the same time,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"notwithstanding your forty\nthousand francs a year, and perhaps even for the very reason that you\nhave forty thousand francs a year, it seems to me that a little coronet\nwould do well on your carriage, hey?\"\n\n\"Yes indeed,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend, win it--it is at the point of your sword. We\nshall not interfere with each other--your object is a title; mine,\nmoney. If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan, which my ancestors,\nimpoverished by the Crusades, allowed to fall into ruins, and to buy\nthirty acres of land about it, that is all I wish. I shall retire and\ndie tranquilly--at home.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said Porthos, \"I desire to be made a baron.\"\n\n\"You shall be one.\"\n\n\"And have you not seen any of our other friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have seen Aramis.\"\n\n\"And what does he wish? To be a bishop?\"\n\n\"Aramis,\" answered D'Artagnan, who did not wish to undeceive Porthos,\n\"Aramis, fancy, has become a monk and a Jesuit, and lives like a bear.\nMy offers did not arouse him,--did not even tempt him.\"\n\n\"So much the worse! He was a clever man. And Athos?\"\n\n\"I have not yet seen him. Do you know where I shall find him?\"\n\n\"Near Blois. He is called Bragelonne. Only imagine, my dear friend.\nAthos, who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one\nestate which gives him the title of comte, what is he to do with all\nthose dignities--the Comte de la Fere, Comte de Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"And he has no children with all these titles?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, \"I have heard that he had adopted a young man who\nresembles him greatly.\"\n\n\"What, Athos? Our Athos, who was as virtuous as Scipio? Have you seen\nhim?\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall see him to-morrow and tell him about you; but I'm afraid,\nentre nous, that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him.\"\n\n\"Yes, he used to drink a great deal,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"And then he was older than any of us,\" added D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Some years only. His gravity made him look older than he was.\"\n\n\"Well then, if we can get Athos, all will be well. If we cannot, we will\ndo without him. We two are worth a dozen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits;\n\"but we four, altogether, would be equal to thirty-six, more especially\nas you say the work will not be child's play. Will it last long?\"\n\n\"By'r Lady! two or three years perhaps.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" cried Porthos. \"You have no idea, my friend, how\nmy bones ache since I came here. Sometimes on a Sunday, I take a ride in\nthe fields and on the property of my neighbours, in order to pick up a\nnice little quarrel, which I am really in want of, but nothing happens.\nEither they respect or they fear me, which is more likely, but they let\nme trample down the clover with my dogs, insult and obstruct every one,\nand I come back still more weary and low-spirited, that's all. At any\nrate, tell me: there's more chance of fighting in Paris, is there not?\"\n\n\"In that respect, my dear friend, it's delightful. No more edicts,\nno more of the cardinal's guards, no more De Jussacs, nor other\nbloodhounds. I'Gad! underneath a lamp in an inn, anywhere, they ask 'Are\nyou one of the Fronde?' They unsheathe, and that's all that is said. The\nDuke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing\nwas said of it.\"\n\n\"Ah, things go on gaily, then,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Besides which, in a short time,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"We shall have set\nbattles, cannonades, conflagrations and there will be great variety.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I decide.\"\n\n\"I have your word, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis given. I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin; but----\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"But he must make me a baron.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" said D'Artagnan, \"that's settled already; I will be\nresponsible for the barony.\"\n\nOn this promise being given, Porthos, who had never doubted his friend's\nassurance, turned back with him toward the castle.\n\n\n\n\n12. In which it is shown that if Porthos was discontented with his\nCondition, Mousqueton was completely satisfied with his.\n\n\n\nAs they returned toward the castle, D'Artagnan thought of the miseries\nof poor human nature, always dissatisfied with what it has, ever\ndesirous of what it has not.\n\nIn the position of Porthos, D'Artagnan would have been perfectly happy;\nand to make Porthos contented there was wanting--what? five letters to\nput before his three names, a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of\nhis carriage!\n\n\"I shall pass all my life,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"in seeking for a man\nwho is really contented with his lot.\"\n\nWhilst making this reflection, chance seemed, as it were, to give him\nthe lie direct. When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw\nMousqueton approaching. The face of the steward, despite one slight\nshade of care, light as a summer cloud, seemed a physiognomy of absolute\nfelicity.\n\n\"Here is what I am looking for,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"but alas! the poor\nfellow does not know the purpose for which I am here.\"\n\nHe then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the servant, \"I have a favour to ask you.\"\n\n\"Speak out, my friend.\"\n\n\"I am afraid to do so. Perhaps you will think, sir, that prosperity has\nspoiled me?\"\n\n\"Art thou happy, friend?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"As happy as possible; and yet, sir, you may make me even happier than I\nam.\"\n\n\"Well, speak, if it depends on me.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir! it depends on you only.\"\n\n\"I listen--I am waiting to hear.\"\n\n\"Sir, the favor I have to ask of you is, not to call me 'Mousqueton' but\n'Mouston.' Since I have had the honor of being my lord's steward I\nhave taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my\ninferiors respect me. You, sir, know how necessary subordination is in\nany large establishment of servants.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled; Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names, Mousqueton\nto cut his short.\n\n\"Well, my dear Mouston,\" he said, \"rest satisfied. I will call thee\nMouston; and if it makes thee happy I will not 'tutoyer' you any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mousqueton, reddening with joy; \"if you do me, sir, such\nhonor, I shall be grateful all my life; it is too much to ask.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" thought D'Artagnan, \"it is very little to offset the unexpected\ntribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed\nme.\"\n\n\"Will monsieur remain long with us?\" asked Mousqueton, with a serene and\nglowing countenance.\n\n\"I go to-morrow, my friend,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, \"then you have come here only to awaken\nour regrets.\"\n\n\"I fear that is true,\" said D'Artagnan, in a low tone.\n\nD'Artagnan was secretly touched with remorse, not at inducing Porthos to\nenter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy,\nfor Porthos, in the title of baron, had his object and reward; but poor\nMousqueton, whose only wish was to be called Mouston--was it not cruel\nto snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he\nwas?\n\nHe was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner.\n\n\"What! to dinner?\" said D'Artagnan. \"What time is it, then?\"\n\n\"Eh! why, it is after one o'clock.\"\n\n\"Your home is a paradise, Porthos; one takes no note of time. I follow\nyou, though I am not hungry.\"\n\n\"Come, if one can't always eat, one can always drink--a maxim of poor\nAthos, the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be lonely.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, who as a Gascon, was inclined to sobriety, seemed not so\nsure as his friend of the truth of Athos's maxim, but he did his best to\nkeep up with his host. Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton\nrecurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton, though\nhe did not himself wait on the table, which would have been beneath him\nin his new position, appeared at the door from time to time and evinced\nhis gratitude to D'Artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to\nbe served. Therefore, when, at dessert, upon a sign from D'Artagnan,\nPorthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone:\n\n\"Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"who will attend you in your campaigns?\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Porthos, \"Mouston, of course.\"\n\nThis was a blow to D'Artagnan. He could already see the intendant's\nbeaming smile change to a contortion of grief. \"But,\" he said, \"Mouston\nis not so young as he was, my dear fellow; besides, he has grown fat and\nperhaps has lost his fitness for active service.\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" replied Porthos; \"but I am used to him, and besides,\nhe wouldn't be willing to let me go without him, he loves me so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, blind self-love!\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And you,\" asked Porthos, \"haven't you still in your service your old\nlackey, that good, that brave, that intelligent---what, then, is his\nname?\"\n\n\"Planchet--yes, I have found him again, but he is lackey no longer.\"\n\n\"What is he, then?\"\n\n\"With his sixteen hundred francs--you remember, the sixteen hundred\nfrancs he earned at the siege of La Rochelle by carrying a letter to\nLord de Winter--he has set up a little shop in the Rue des Lombards and\nis now a confectioner.\"\n\n\"Ah, he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards! How does it happen,\nthen, that he is in your service?\"\n\n\"He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed.\"\nAnd the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchet's adventure.\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, \"if any one had told you in the old times that the\nday would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would\nprotect him in it----\"\n\n\"I should not have believed him; but men are changed by events.\"\n\n\"There is nothing truer than that,\" said Porthos; \"but what does not\nchange, or changes for the better, is wine. Taste of this; it is a\nSpanish wine which our friend Athos thought much of.\"\n\nAt that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the\nproceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party\nwhich had been proposed.\n\n\"Tell me, Mouston,\" said Porthos, \"are my arms in good condition?\"\n\n\"Your arms, my lord--what arms?\"\n\n\"Zounds! my weapons.\"\n\n\"What weapons?\"\n\n\"My military weapons.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; at any rate, I think so.\"\n\n\"Make sure of it, and if they want it, have them burnished up. Which is\nmy best cavalry horse?\"\n\n\"Vulcan.\"\n\n\"And the best hack?\"\n\n\"Bayard.\"\n\n\"What horse dost thou choose for thyself?\"\n\n\"I like Rustaud, my lord; a good animal, whose paces suit me.\"\n\n\"Strong, thinkest thou?\"\n\n\"Half Norman, half Mecklenburger; will go night and day.\"\n\n\"That will do for us. See to these horses. Polish up or make some one\nelse polish my arms. Then take pistols with thee and a hunting-knife.\"\n\n\"Are we then going to travel, my lord?\" asked Mousqueton, rather uneasy.\n\n\"Something better still, Mouston.\"\n\n\"An expedition, sir?\" asked the steward, whose roses began to change\ninto lilies.\n\n\"We are going to return to the service, Mouston,\" replied Porthos, still\ntrying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost.\n\n\"Into the service--the king's service?\" Mousqueton trembled; even his\nfat, smooth cheeks shook as he spoke, and he looked at D'Artagnan with\nan air of reproach; he staggered, and his voice was almost choked.\n\n\"Yes and no. We shall serve in a campaign, seek out all sorts of\nadventures--return, in short, to our former life.\"\n\nThese last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt. It was those\nvery terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful,\nand the blow was so great he rushed out, overcome, and forgot to shut\nthe door.\n\nThe two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build\ncastles in the air. The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before\nthem traced out in glowing drops to D'Artagnan a fine perspective,\nshining with quadruples and pistoles, and showed to Porthos a blue\nribbon and a ducal mantle; they were, in fact, asleep on the table when\nthe servants came to light them to their bed.\n\nMousqueton was, however, somewhat consoled by D'Artagnan, who the next\nday told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in\nthe heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon, which was\nnear Corbeil, or Bracieux, which was near Melun, and of Pierrefonds,\nwhich was between Compiegne and Villars-Cotterets.\n\n\"But--formerly--it appears,\" began Mousqueton timidly.\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, \"we don't now make war as we did formerly. To-day\nit's a sort of diplomatic arrangement; ask Planchet.\"\n\nMousqueton inquired, therefore, the state of the case of his old friend,\nwho confirmed the statement of D'Artagnan. \"But,\" he added, \"in this war\nprisoners stand a chance of being hung.\"\n\n\"The deuce they do!\" said Mousqueton; \"I think I should like the siege\nof Rochelle better than this war, then!\"\n\nPorthos, meantime, asked D'Artagnan to give him his instructions how to\nproceed on his journey.\n\n\"Four days,\" replied his friend, \"are necessary to reach Blois; one\nday to rest there; three or four days to return to Paris. Set out,\ntherefore, in a week, with your suite, and go to the Hotel de la\nChevrette, Rue Tiquetonne, and there await me.\"\n\n\"That's agreed,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"As to myself, I shall go around to see Athos; for though I don't\nthink his aid worth much, one must with one's friends observe all due\npoliteness,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nThe friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the\nestate of Pierrefonds, to which Porthos escorted his friend.\n\n\"At least,\" D'Artagnan said to himself, as he took the road to\nVillars-Cotterets, \"at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking.\nThat devil, Porthos, is a man of prodigious strength; still, if Athos\njoins us, well, we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis, that little\ncoxcomb with his too good luck.\"\n\nAt Villars-Cotterets he wrote to the cardinal:\n\n\n\n\"My Lord,--I have already one man to offer to your eminence, and he is\nwell worth twenty men. I am just setting out for Blois. The Comte de la\nFere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne, in the environs of that city.\"\n\n\n\n\n13. Two Angelic Faces.\n\n\n\nThe road was long, but the horses upon which D'Artagnan and Planchet\nrode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of\nBracieux; the master and servant rode side by side, conversing as they\nwent, for D'Artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet\nhad entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant. He had been\nraised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master. It\nwas many years since D'Artagnan had opened his heart to any one; it\nhappened, however, that these two men, on meeting again, assimilated\nperfectly. Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new\nadventures; he was a man of uncommonly sound sense. Without courting\ndanger he never shrank from an encounter; in short, he had been a\nsoldier and arms ennoble a man; it was, therefore, on the footing of\nfriends that D'Artagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of\nBlois.\n\nGoing along, D'Artagnan, shaking his head, said:\n\n\"I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd; but still I owe\nthis courtesy to my old friend, a man who had in him material for the\nmost noble and generous of characters.\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman,\" said Planchet, \"was he\nnot? Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain. Do\nyou remember, sir, that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des\nCarmes? Ah! how lofty, how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day, when\nhe said to his adversary: 'You have insisted on knowing my name, sir;\nso much the worse for you, since I shall be obliged to kill you.' I was\nnear him, those were his exact words, when he stabbed his foe as he\nsaid he would, and his adversary fell without saying, 'Oh!' 'Tis a noble\ngentleman--Monsieur Athos.\"\n\n\"Yes, true as Gospel,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but one single fault has\nswallowed up all these fine qualities.\"\n\n\"I remember well,\" said Planchet, \"he was fond of drinking--in truth, he\ndrank, but not as other men drink. One seemed, as he raised the wine to\nhis lips, to hear him say, 'Come, juice of the grape, and chase away my\nsorrows.' And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a\nbottle! There was no one like him for that.\"\n\n\"And now,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"behold the sad spectacle that awaits us.\nThis noble gentleman with his lofty glance, this handsome cavalier, so\nbrilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in\nhis hand a sword only instead of a baton of command! Alas! we shall find\nhim changed into a broken down old man, with garnet nose and eyes that\nslobber; we shall find him extended on some lawn, whence he will look at\nus with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us. God knows,\nPlanchet, that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to\nshow my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de\nla Fere, whom we loved so much.\"\n\nPlanchet shook his head and said nothing. It was evident that he shared\nhis master's apprehensions.\n\n\"And then,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"to this decrepitude is probably added\npoverty, for he must have neglected the little that he had, and the\ndirty scoundrel, Grimaud, more taciturn than ever and still more drunken\nthan his master--stay, Planchet, it breaks my heart to merely think of\nit.\"\n\n\"I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him\nstammering,\" said Planchet, in a piteous tone, \"but at all events we\nshall soon know the real state of things, for I imagine that those lofty\nwalls, now turning ruby in the setting sun, are the walls of Blois.\"\n\n\"Probably; and those steeples, pointed and sculptured, that we catch a\nglimpse of yonder, are similar to those that I have heard described at\nChambord.\"\n\nAt this moment one of those heavy wagons, drawn by bullocks, which carry\nthe wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the\nLoire, came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the\ntwo horsemen were following. A man carrying a long switch with a nail\nat the end of it, with which he urged on his slow team, was walking with\nthe cart.\n\n\"Ho! friend,\" cried Planchet.\n\n\"What's your pleasure, gentlemen?\" replied the peasant, with a purity of\naccent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have\nput to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de\nl'Universite.\n\n\"We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nThe peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"the wood that I am carting is his; I cut it in\nhis copse and I am taking it to the chateau.\"\n\nD'Artagnan determined not to question this man; he did not wish to hear\nfrom another what he had himself said to Planchet.\n\n\"The chateau!\" he said to himself, \"what chateau? Ah, I understand!\nAthos is not a man to be thwarted; he, like Porthos, has obliged his\npeasantry to call him 'my lord,' and to dignify his pettifogging place\nby the name of chateau. He had a heavy hand--dear old Athos--after\ndrinking.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, after asking the man the right way, continued his route,\nagitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that\nsingular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much\nby advice and example to his education as a gentleman. He checked by\ndegrees the speed of his horse and went on, his head drooping as if in\ndeep thought.\n\nSoon, as the road turned, the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view;\nthen, a quarter of a mile beyond, a white house, encircled in sycamores,\nwas visible at the farther end of a group of trees, which spring had\npowdered with a snow of flowers.\n\nOn beholding this house, D'Artagnan, calm as he was in general, felt\nan unusual disturbance within his heart--so powerful during the\nwhole course of life are the recollections of youth. He proceeded,\nnevertheless, and came opposite to an iron gate, ornamented in the taste\nof the period.\n\nThrough the gate was seen kitchen-gardens, carefully attended to, a\nspacious courtyard, in which neighed several horses held by valets in\nvarious liveries, and a carriage, drawn by two horses of the country.\n\n\"We are mistaken,\" said D'Artagnan. \"This cannot be the establishment\nof Athos. Good heavens! suppose he is dead and that this property now\nbelongs to some one who bears his name. Alight, Planchet, and inquire,\nfor I confess that I have scarcely courage so to do.\"\n\nPlanchet alighted.\n\n\"Thou must add,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that a gentleman who is passing by\nwishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere,\nand if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest, then mention my name!\"\n\nPlanchet, leading his horse by the bridle, drew near to the gate and\nrang the bell, and immediately a servant-man with white hair and of\nerect stature, notwithstanding his age, presented himself.\n\n\"Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here?\" asked Planchet.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, it is here he lives,\" the servant replied to Planchet,\nwho was not in livery.\n\n\"A nobleman retired from service, is he not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who had a lackey named Grimaud?\" persisted Planchet, who had\nprudently considered that he couldn't have too much information.\n\n\"Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being,\" said\nthe servitor, who, little used as he was to such inquiries, began to\nexamine Planchet from head to foot.\n\n\"Then,\" cried Planchet joyously, \"I see well that it is the same Comte\nde la Fere whom we seek. Be good enough to open to me, for I wish to\nannounce to monsieur le comte that my master, one of his friends, is\nhere, and wishes to greet him.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so?\" said the servitor, opening the gate. \"But where\nis your master?\"\n\n\"He is following me.\"\n\nThe servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet, who made a sign\nto D'Artagnan. The latter, his heart palpitating more than ever, entered\nthe courtyard without dismounting.\n\nWhilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a\nvoice say:\n\n\"Well, where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here?\"\n\nThis voice, the sound of which reached D'Artagnan, reawakened in his\nheart a thousand sentiments, a thousand recollections that he had\nforgotten. He vaulted hastily from his horse, whilst Planchet, with a\nsmile on his lips, advanced toward the master of the house.\n\n\"But I know you, my lad,\" said Athos, appearing on the threshold.\n\n\"Oh, yes, monsieur le comte, you know me and I know you. I am\nPlanchet--Planchet, whom you know well.\" But the honest servant could\nsay no more, so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview.\n\n\"What, Planchet, is Monsieur d'Artagnan here?\"\n\n\"Here I am, my friend, dear Athos!\" cried D'Artagnan, in a faltering\nvoice and almost staggering from agitation.\n\nAt these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful\ncountenance and calm features of Athos. He rushed toward D'Artagnan with\neyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms. D'Artagnan, equally\nmoved, pressed him also closely to him, whilst tears stood in his eyes.\nAthos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room, where\nthere were several people. Every one arose.\n\n\"I present to you,\" he said, \"Monsieur le Chevalier D'Artagnan,\nlieutenant of his majesty's musketeers, a devoted friend and one of the\nmost excellent, brave gentlemen that I have ever known.\"\n\nD'Artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own\nway, and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at\nAthos.\n\nStrange! Athos was scarcely aged at all! His fine eyes, no longer\nsurrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too\ninfallibly, seemed larger, more liquid than ever. His face, a little\nelongated, had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish\nexcitement. His hand, always wonderfully beautiful and strong, was set\noff by a ruffle of lace, like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck. He\nwas less stiff than formerly. His long, dark hair, softly powdered here\nand there with silver tendrils, fell elegantly over his shoulders in\nwavy curls; his voice was still youthful, as if belonging to a Hercules\nof twenty-five, and his magnificent teeth, which he had preserved white\nand sound, gave an indescribable charm to his smile.\n\nMeanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were longing to\nbe alone, prepared to depart, when a noise of dogs barking resounded\nthrough the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment:\n\n\"Ah! 'tis Raoul, who is come home.\"\n\nAthos, as the name of Raoul was pronounced, looked inquisitively at\nD'Artagnan, in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his\nface. But D'Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost\nmechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age, dressed\nsimply, but in perfect taste, entered the room, raising, as he came, his\nhat, adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers.\n\nNevertheless, D'Artagnan was struck by the appearance of this\nnew personage. It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos; a\nresemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this\nregenerated existence. He remained listening and gazing.\n\n\"Here you are, home again, Raoul,\" said the comte.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the youth, with deep respect, \"and I have performed\nthe commission that you gave me.\"\n\n\"But what's the matter, Raoul?\" said Athos, very anxiously. \"You are\npale and agitated.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the young man, \"it is on account of an accident which has\nhappened to our little neighbor.\"\n\n\"To Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\" asked Athos, quickly.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried many persons present.\n\n\"She was walking with her nurse Marceline, in the place where the\nwoodmen cut the wood, when, passing on horseback, I stopped. She saw me\nalso and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she\nhad mounted, the poor child fell and was not able to rise again. I fear\nthat she has badly sprained her ankle.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" cried Athos. \"And her mother, Madame de Saint-Remy, have\nthey yet told her of it?\"\n\n\"No, sir, Madame de Saint-Remy is at Blois with the Duchess of Orleans.\nI am afraid that what was first done was unskillful, if not worse than\nuseless. I am come, sir, to ask your advice.\"\n\n\"Send directly to Blois, Raoul; or, rather, take horse and ride\nimmediately yourself.\"\n\nRaoul bowed.\n\n\"But where is Louise?\" asked the comte.\n\n\"I have brought her here, sir, and I have deposited her in charge of\nCharlotte, who, till better advice comes, has bathed the foot in cold\nwell-water.\"\n\nThe guests now all took leave of Athos, excepting the old Duc de Barbe,\nwho, as an old friend of the family of La Valliere, went to see little\nLouise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage.\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Athos. \"She will be the sooner with her\nmother. As for you, Raoul, I am sure it is your fault, some giddiness or\nfolly.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I assure you,\" muttered Raoul, \"it is not.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, I declare it is not!\" cried the young girl, while Raoul\nturned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster.\n\n\"Nevertheless, Raoul, you must go to Blois and you must make your\nexcuses and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy.\"\n\nThe youth looked pleased. He again took in his strong arms the little\ngirl, whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder,\nand placed her gently in the carriage; then jumping on his horse\nwith the elegance of a first-rate esquire, after bowing to Athos and\nD'Artagnan, he went off close by the door of the carriage, on somebody\ninside of which his eyes were riveted.\n\n\n\n\n14. The Castle of Bragelonne.\n\n\n\nWhilst this scene was going on, D'Artagnan remained with open mouth and\na confused gaze. Everything had turned out so differently from what he\nexpected that he was stupefied with wonder.\n\nAthos, who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts, took his\narm and led him into the garden.\n\n\"Whilst supper is being prepared,\" he said, smiling, \"you will not, my\nfriend, be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up.\"\n\n\"True, monsieur le comte,\" replied D'Artagnan, who felt that by degrees\nAthos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him.\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"First and foremost, dear D'Artagnan, we have no title such as count\nhere. When I call you 'chevalier,' it is in presenting you to my guests,\nthat they may know who you are. But to you, D'Artagnan, I am, I hope,\nstill dear Athos, your comrade, your friend. Do you intend to stand on\nceremony because you are less attached to me than you were?\"\n\n\"Oh! God forbid!\"\n\n\"Then let us be as we used to be; let us be open with each other. You\nare surprised at what you see here?\"\n\n\"Extremely.\"\n\n\"But above all things, I am a marvel to you?\"\n\n\"I confess it.\"\n\n\"I am still young, am I not? Should you not have known me again, in\nspite of my eight-and-forty years of age?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I do not find you the same person at all.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" cried Athos, with a gentle blush. \"Everything,\nD'Artagnan, even folly, has its limit.\"\n\n\"Then your means, it appears, are improved; you have a capital\nhouse--your own, I presume? You have a park, and horses, servants.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"Yes, I inherited this little property when I quitted the army, as I\ntold you. The park is twenty acres--twenty, comprising kitchen-gardens\nand a common. I have two horses,--I do not count my servant's bobtailed\nnag. My sporting dogs consist of two pointers, two harriers and two\nsetters. But then all this extravagance is not for myself,\" added Athos,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Yes, I see, for the young man Raoul,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You guess aright, my friend; this youth is an orphan, deserted by\nhis mother, who left him in the house of a poor country priest. I have\nbrought him up. It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see;\nI was dried up like a miserable tree, isolated, attached to nothing on\nearth; it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again\nand drag me back to life. This child has caused me to recover what I had\nlost. I had no longer any wish to live for myself, I have lived for him.\nI have corrected the vices that I had; I have assumed the virtues that\nI had not. Precept something, but example more. I may be mistaken, but I\nbelieve that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate\nage could display.\"\n\nThe remembrance of Milady recurred to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And you are happy?\" he said to his friend.\n\n\"As happy as it is allowed to one of God's creatures to be on this\nearth; but say out all you think, D'Artagnan, for you have not yet done\nso.\"\n\n\"You are too bad, Athos; one can hide nothing from you,\" answered\nD'Artagnan. \"I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror\nresembling----\"\n\n\"Remorse! I finish your phrase. Yes and no. I do not feel remorse,\nbecause that woman, I profoundly hold, deserved her punishment. Had she\none redeeming trait? I doubt it. I do not feel remorse, because had we\nallowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction.\nBut I do not mean, my friend that we were right in what we did. Perhaps\nall blood demands some expiation. Hers had been accomplished; it\nremains, possibly, for us to accomplish ours.\"\n\n\"I have sometimes thought as you do, Athos.\"\n\n\"She had a son, that unhappy woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard of him?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"He must be about twenty-three years of age,\" said Athos, in a low tone.\n\"I often think of that young man, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Strange! for I had forgotten him,\" said the lieutenant.\n\nAthos smiled; the smile was melancholy.\n\n\"And Lord de Winter--do you know anything about him?\"\n\n\"I know that he is in high favor with Charles I.\"\n\n\"The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water. He shed the blood\nof Strafford; that confirms what I said just now--blood will have blood.\nAnd the queen?\"\n\n\"What queen?\"\n\n\"Madame Henrietta of England, daughter of Henry IV.\"\n\n\"She is at the Louvre, as you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I hear in bitter poverty. Her daughter, during the severest\ncold, was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed. Do you grasp\nthat?\" said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; \"the daughter of Henry IV.\nshivering for want of a fagot! Why did she not ask from any one of us a\nhome instead of from Mazarin? She should have wanted nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the queen of England?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No; but my mother, as a child, saw her. Did I ever tell you that my\nmother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici?\"\n\n\"Never. You know, Athos, you never spoke much of such matters.\"\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu, yes, you are right,\" Athos replied; \"but then there must\nbe some occasion for speaking.\"\n\n\"Porthos wouldn't have waited for it so patiently,\" said D'Artagnan,\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Every one according to his nature, my dear D'Artagnan. Porthos, in\nspite of a touch of vanity, has many excellent qualities. Have you seen\nhim?\"\n\n\"I left him five days ago,\" said D'Artagnan, and he portrayed with\nGascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of Porthos in his Chateau\nof Pierrefonds; nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the\nexcellent Monsieur Mouston.\n\n\"I sometimes wonder,\" replied Athos, smiling at that gayety which\nrecalled the good old days, \"that we could form an association of men\nwho would be, after twenty years of separation, still so closely bound\ntogether. Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts, D'Artagnan.\nBelieve me, it is only the evil-minded who deny friendship; they cannot\nunderstand it. And Aramis?\"\n\n\"I have seen him also,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but he seemed to me cold.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have seen Aramis?\" said Athos, turning on D'Artagnan a\nsearching look. \"Why, it is a veritable pilgrimage, my dear friend, that\nyou are making to the Temple of Friendship, as the poets would say.\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" replied D'Artagnan, with embarrassment.\n\n\"Aramis, you know,\" continued Athos, \"is naturally cold, and then he is\nalways involved in intrigues with women.\"\n\n\"I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one,\" said\nD'Artagnan.\n\nAthos made no reply.\n\n\"He is not curious,\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\nAthos not only failed to reply, he even changed the subject of\nconversation.\n\n\"You see,\" said he, calling D'Artagnan's attention to the fact that they\nhad come back to the chateau after an hour's walk, \"we have made a tour\nof my domains.\"\n\n\"All is charming and everything savors of nobility,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nAt this instant they heard the sound of horses' feet.\n\n\"'Tis Raoul who has come back,\" said Athos; \"and we can now hear how the\npoor child is.\"\n\nIn fact, the young man appeared at the gate, covered with dust, entered\nthe courtyard, leaped from his horse, which he consigned to the charge\nof a groom, and then went to greet the count and D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Athos, placing his hand on D'Artagnan's shoulder,\n\"monsieur is the Chevalier D'Artagnan of whom you have often heard me\nspeak, Raoul.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the young man, saluting again and more profoundly,\n\"monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example\nwhenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman.\"\n\nThat little compliment could not fail to move D'Artagnan. He extended a\nhand to Raoul and said:\n\n\"My young friend, all the praises that are given me should be passed on\nto the count here; for he has educated me in everything and it is not\nhis fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions. But\nhe will make it up in you I am sure. I like your manner, Raoul, and your\npoliteness has touched me.\"\n\nAthos was more delighted than can be told. He looked at D'Artagnan\nwith an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those\nstrange smiles, of which children are so proud when they receive them.\n\n\"Now,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, noticing that silent play of\ncountenance, \"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"I hope the accident has been of no consequence?\"\n\n\"They don't yet know, sir, on account of the swelling; but the doctor is\nafraid some tendon has been injured.\"\n\nAt this moment a little boy, half peasant, half foot-boy, came to\nannounce supper.\n\nAthos led his guest into a dining-room of moderate size, the windows of\nwhich opened on one side on a garden, on the other on a hot-house full\nof magnificent flowers.\n\nD'Artagnan glanced at the dinner service. The plate was magnificent,\nold, and appertaining to the family. D'Artagnan stopped to look at a\nsideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver.\n\n\"That workmanship is divine!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, a chef d'oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor, Benvenuto\nCellini,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"What battle does it represent?\"\n\n\"That of Marignan, just at the point where one of my forefathers is\noffering his sword to Francis I., who has broken his. It was on that\noccasion that my ancestor, Enguerrand de la Fere, was made a knight\nof the Order of St. Michael; besides which, the king, fifteen years\nafterward, gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen\nformerly in my house, also a lovely specimen of workmanship. Men were\ngiants in those times,\" said Athos; \"now we are pigmies in comparison.\nLet us sit down to supper. Call Charles,\" he added, addressing the boy\nwho waited.\n\n\"My good Charles, I particularly recommend to your care Planchet, the\nlaquais of Monsieur D'Artagnan. He likes good wine; now you have the\nkey of the cellar. He has slept a long time on a hard bed, so he won't\nobject to a soft one; take every care of him, I beg of you.\" Charles\nbowed and retired.\n\n\"You think of everything,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and I thank you for\nPlanchet, my dear Athos.\"\n\nRaoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite\nsure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed.\n\n\"That name sounds strange to you,\" said Athos, smiling; \"it was my nom\nde guerre when Monsieur D'Artagnan, two other gallant friends and myself\nperformed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle, under the\ndeceased cardinal and Monsieur de Bassompierre. My friend is still so\nkind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation, which\nmakes my heart glad when I hear it.\"\n\n\"'Tis an illustrious name,\" said the lieutenant, \"and had one day\ntriumphal honors paid to it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"You have not forgotten St. Gervais, Athos, and the napkin which was\nconverted into a banner?\" and he then related to Raoul the story of the\nbastion, and Raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of\narms belonging to days of chivalry, so gloriously recounted by Tasso and\nAriosto.\n\n\"D'Artagnan does not tell you, Raoul,\" said Athos, in his turn, \"that he\nwas reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time--a knuckle of\niron, a wrist of steel, a sure eye and a glance of fire; that's what\nhis adversary met with. He was eighteen, only three years older than you\nare, Raoul, when I saw him set to work, pitted against tried men.\"\n\n\"And did Monsieur D'Artagnan come off the conqueror?\" asked the young\nman, with glistening eye.\n\n\"I killed one man, if I recollect rightly,\" replied D'Artagnan, with\na look of inquiry directed to Athos; \"another I disarmed or wounded, I\ndon't remember which.\"\n\n\"Wounded!\" said Athos; \"it was a phenomenon of skill.\"\n\nThe young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into\nthe night, but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose.\nD'Artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued, but Athos\ninsisted on his retiring to his chamber, conducted thither by Raoul.\n\n\n\n\n15. Athos as a Diplomatist.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan retired to bed--not to sleep, but to think over all he had\nheard that evening. Being naturally goodhearted, and having had once\na liking for Athos, which had grown into a sincere friendship, he was\ndelighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength,\ninstead of a drunkard. He admitted without annoyance the continued\nsuperiority of Athos over himself, devoid as he was of that jealousy\nwhich might have saddened a less generous disposition; he was delighted\nalso that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for\nhis mission. Nevertheless, it seemed to him that Athos was not in all\nrespects sincere and frank. Who was the youth he had adopted and who\nbore so striking a resemblance to him? What could explain Athos's having\nre-entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table?\nThe absence of Grimaud, whose name had never once been uttered by Athos,\ngave D'Artagnan uneasiness. It was evident either that he no longer\npossessed the confidence of his friend, or that Athos was bound by some\ninvisible chain, or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant's\nvisit.\n\nHe could not help thinking of M. Rochefort, whom he had seen in Notre\nDame; could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos? Again,\nthe moderate fortune which Athos possessed, concealed as it was, so\nskillfully, seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a\nlatent ambition which might be easily aroused. The clear and vigorous\nintellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less\nable man would be. He would enter into the minister's schemes with the\nmore ardor, because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity.\n\nResolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following\nday, D'Artagnan, in spite of his fatigue, prepared for an attack and\ndetermined that it should take place after breakfast. He determined to\ncultivate the good-will of the youth Raoul and, either whilst fencing\nwith him or when out shooting, to extract from his simplicity some\ninformation which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos\nof the present. But D'Artagnan at the same time, being a man of extreme\ncaution, was quite aware what injury he should do himself, if by any\nindiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the\nexperienced eye of Athos. Besides, to tell truth, whilst D'Artagnan was\nquite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis\nor the vanity of Porthos, he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos,\ntrue-hearted, open Athos. It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis\ndeemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy, they would like\nhim all the better for it; but that Athos, on the contrary, would\ndespise him.\n\n\"Ah! why is not Grimaud, the taciturn Grimaud, here?\" thought\nD'Artagnan, \"there are so many things his silence would have told me;\nwith Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence!\"\n\nThere reigned a perfect stillness in the house. D'Artagnan had heard the\ndoor shut and the shutters barred; the dogs became in their turn silent.\nAt last a nightingale, lost in a thicket of shrubs, in the midst of\nits most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and\nfallen asleep. Not a sound was heard in the castle, except of a footstep\nup and down, in the chamber above--as he supposed, the bedroom of Athos.\n\n\"He is walking about and thinking,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"but of what? It\nis impossible to know; everything else might be guessed, but not that.\"\n\nAt length Athos went to bed, apparently, for the noise ceased.\n\nSilence and fatigue together overcame D'Artagnan and sleep overtook him\nalso. He was not, however, a good sleeper. Scarcely had dawn gilded\nhis window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows.\nSomebody, he perceived, was in the courtyard, moving stealthily. True to\nhis custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power\nto know, D'Artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red\ncoat and brown hair of Raoul.\n\nThe young man was opening the door of the stable. He then, with\nnoiseless haste, took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous\nevening, saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the\nalley to the right of the kitchen-garden, opened a side door which\nconducted him to a bridle road, shut it after him, and D'Artagnan\nsaw him pass by like a dart, bending, as he went, beneath the pendent\nflowery branches of maple and acacia. The road, as D'Artagnan had\nobserved, was the way to Blois.\n\n\"So!\" thought the Gascon \"here's a young blade who has already his love\naffair, who doesn't at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair\nsex. He's not going to hunt, for he has neither dogs nor arms; he's not\ngoing on a message, for he goes secretly. Why does he go in secret? Is\nhe afraid of me or of his father? for I am sure the count is his father.\nBy Jove! I shall know about that soon, for I shall soon speak out to\nAthos.\"\n\nDay was now advanced; all the noises that had ceased the night before\nreawakened, one after the other. The bird on the branch, the dog in his\nkennel, the sheep in the field, the boats moored in the Loire, even,\nbecame alive and vocal. The latter, leaving the shore, abandoned\nthemselves gaily to the current. The Gascon gave a last twirl to his\nmustache, a last turn to his hair, brushed, from habit, the brim of his\nhat with the sleeve of his doublet, and went downstairs. Scarcely had\nhe descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down\ntoward the ground, as if he were looking for a crown-piece in the dust.\n\n\"Good-morning, my dear host,\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Good-day to you; have you slept well?\"\n\n\"Excellently, Athos, but what are you looking for? You are perhaps a\ntulip fancier?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, if I am, you must not laugh at me for being so. In the\ncountry people alter; one gets to like, without knowing it, all those\nbeautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth, which\nare despised in cities. I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I\nplanted here, close to this reservoir, and which some one has trampled\nupon this morning. These gardeners are the most careless people in the\nworld; in bringing the horse out to the water they've allowed him to\nwalk over the border.\"\n\nD'Artagnan began to smile.\n\n\"Ah! you think so, do you?\"\n\nAnd he took his friend along the alley, where a number of tracks like\nthose which had trampled down the flowerbeds, were visible.\n\n\"Here are the horse's hoofs again, it seems, Athos,\" he said carelessly.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, the marks are recent.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" replied the lieutenant.\n\n\"Who went out this morning?\" Athos asked, uneasily. \"Has any horse got\nloose?\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" answered the Gascon; \"these marks are regular.\"\n\n\"Where is Raoul?\" asked Athos; \"how is it that I have not seen him?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, putting his finger on his lips; and he\nrelated what he had seen, watching Athos all the while.\n\n\"Ah, he's gone to Blois; the poor boy----\"\n\n\"Wherefore?\"\n\n\"Ah, to inquire after the little La Valliere; she has sprained her foot,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"You think he has?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said Athos; \"don't you see that Raoul is in love?\"\n\n\"Indeed! with whom--with a child seven years old?\"\n\n\"Dear friend, at Raoul's age the heart is so expansive that it must\nencircle one object or another, fancied or real. Well, his love is half\nreal, half fanciful. She is the prettiest little creature in the world,\nwith flaxen hair, blue eyes,--at once saucy and languishing.\"\n\n\"But what say you to Raoul's fancy?\"\n\n\"Nothing--I laugh at Raoul; but this first desire of the heart is\nimperious. I remember, just at his age, how deep in love I was with\na Grecian statue which our good king, then Henry IV., gave my father,\ninsomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story of\nPygmalion was nothing but a fable.\"\n\n\"It is mere want of occupation. You do not make Raoul work, so he takes\nhis own way of employing himself.\"\n\n\"Exactly; therefore I think of sending him away from here.\"\n\n\"You will be wise to do so.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it; but it will break his heart. So long as three or four\nyears ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol, whom he will some\nday fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here. The parents\nof little La Valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at\nit; now they begin to look concerned.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! However, Raoul must be diverted from this fancy. Send him\naway or you will never make a man of him.\"\n\n\"I think I shall send him to Paris.\"\n\n\"So!\" thought D'Artagnan, and it seemed to him that the moment for\nattack had arrived.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said, \"we roughly chalk out a career for this young man. I\nwish to consult you about some thing.\"\n\n\"Do so.\"\n\n\"Do you think it is time for us to enter the service?\"\n\n\"But are you not still in the service--you, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I mean active service. Our former life, has it still no attractions for\nyou? would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of\nPorthos, the exploits of our youth?\"\n\n\"Do you propose to me to do so, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Decidedly and honestly.\"\n\n\"On whose side?\" asked Athos, fixing his clear, benevolent glance on the\ncountenance of the Gascon.\n\n\"Ah, devil take it, you speak in earnest----\"\n\n\"And must have a definite answer. Listen, D'Artagnan. There is but one\nperson, or rather, one cause, to whom a man like me can be useful--that\nof the king.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" answered the musketeer.\n\n\"Yes, but let us understand each other,\" returned Athos, seriously. \"If\nby the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin, we do not\nunderstand each other.\"\n\n\"I don't say exactly,\" answered the Gascon, confused.\n\n\"Come, D'Artagnan, don't let us play a sidelong game; your hesitation,\nyour evasion, tells me at once on whose side you are; for that party no\none dares openly to recruit, and when people recruit for it, it is with\naverted eyes and humble voice.\"\n\n\"Ah! my dear Athos!\"\n\n\"You know that I am not alluding to you; you are the pearl of brave,\nbold men. I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italian--of the pedant\nwho has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a\npillow--of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king--who\nwants to send the princes of the blood to prison, not daring to kill\nthem, as our great cardinal--our cardinal did--of the miser, who weighs\nhis gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear, though he is rich,\nof losing them at play next morning--of the impudent fellow who insults\nthe queen, as they say--so much the worse for her--and who is going\nin three months to make war upon us, in order that he may retain his\npensions; is that the master whom you propose to me? I thank you,\nD'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"You are more impetuous than you were,\" returned D'Artagnan. \"Age has\nwarmed, not chilled your blood. Who informed you this was the master I\npropose to you? Devil take it,\" he muttered to himself, \"don't let me\nbetray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Athos, \"what are your schemes? what do you propose?\"\n\n\"Zounds! nothing more than natural. You live on your estate, happy in\ngolden mediocrity. Porthos has, perhaps, sixty thousand francs income.\nAramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest, as they\nquarreled formerly over the musketeer; but I--what have I in the world?\nI have worn my cuirass these twenty years, kept down in this inferior\nrank, without going forward or backward, hardly half living. In fact,\nI am dead. Well! when there is some idea of being resuscitated, you say\nhe's a scoundrel, an impudent fellow, a miser, a bad master! By Jove!\nI am of your opinion, but find me a better one or give me the means of\nliving.\"\n\nAthos was for a few moments thoughtful.\n\n\"Good! D'Artagnan is for Mazarin,\" he said to himself.\n\nFrom that moment he grew very guarded.\n\nOn his side D'Artagnan became more cautious also.\n\n\"You spoke to me,\" Athos resumed, \"of Porthos; have you persuaded him to\nseek his fortune? But he has wealth, I believe, already.\"\n\n\"Doubtless he has. But such is man, we always want something more than\nwe already have.\"\n\n\"What does Porthos wish for?\"\n\n\"To be a baron.\"\n\n\"Ah, true! I forgot,\" said Athos, laughing.\n\n\"'Tis true!\" thought the Gascon, \"where has he heard it? Does he\ncorrespond with Aramis? Ah! if I knew that he did I should know all.\"\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul.\n\n\"Is our little neighbor worse?\" asked D'Artagnan, seeing a look of\nvexation on the face of the youth.\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" replied Raoul, \"her fall is a very serious one, and without\nany ostensible injury, the physician fears she will be lame for life.\"\n\n\"This is terrible,\" said Athos.\n\n\"And what makes me all the more wretched, sir, is, that I was the cause\nof this misfortune.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood.\"\n\n\"There's only one remedy, dear Raoul--that is, to marry her as a\ncompensation.\" remarked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" answered Raoul, \"you joke about a real misfortune; that is\ncruel, indeed.\"\n\nThe good understanding between the two friends was not in the least\naltered by the morning's skirmish. They breakfasted with a good\nappetite, looking now and then at poor Raoul, who with moist eyes and a\nfull heart, scarcely ate at all.\n\nAfter breakfast two letters arrived for Athos, who read them with\nprofound attention, whilst D'Artagnan could not restrain himself from\njumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles, in one of\nwhich, there being at the time a very strong light, he perceived the\nfine writing of Aramis. The other was in a feminine hand, long, and\ncrossed.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan to Raoul, seeing that Athos wished to be alone,\n\"come, let us take a turn in the fencing gallery; that will amuse you.\"\n\nAnd they both went into a low room where there were foils, gloves,\nmasks, breastplates, and all the accessories for a fencing match.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles\nbrought in a letter for D'Artagnan, which a messenger had just desired\nmight be instantly delivered.\n\nIt was now Athos's turn to take a sly look.\n\nD'Artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said, shaking his\nhead:\n\n\"See, dear friend, what it is to belong to the army. Faith, you are\nindeed right not to return to it. Monsieur de Treville is ill, so my\ncompany can't do without me; there! my leave is at an end!\"\n\n\"Do you return to Paris?\" asked Athos, quickly.\n\n\"Egad! yes; but why don't you come there also?\"\n\nAthos colored a little and answered:\n\n\"Should I go, I shall be delighted to see you there.\"\n\n\"Halloo, Planchet!\" cried the Gascon from the door, \"we must set out in\nten minutes; give the horses some hay.\"\n\nThen turning to Athos he added:\n\n\"I seem to miss something here. I am really sorry to go away without\nhaving seen Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Grimaud!\" replied Athos. \"I'm surprised you have never so much as asked\nafter him. I have lent him to a friend----\"\n\n\"Who will understand the signs he makes?\" returned D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\nThe friends embraced cordially; D'Artagnan pressed Raoul's hand.\n\n\"Will you not come with me?\" he said; \"I shall pass by Blois.\"\n\nRaoul turned toward Athos, who showed him by a secret sign that he did\nnot wish him to go.\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied the young man; \"I will remain with monsieur le\ncomte.\"\n\n\"Adieu, then, to both, my good friends,\" said D'Artagnan; \"may God\npreserve you! as we used to say when we said good-bye to each other in\nthe late cardinal's time.\"\n\nAthos waved his hand, Raoul bowed, and D'Artagnan and Planchet set out.\n\nThe count followed them with his eyes, his hands resting on the\nshoulders of the youth, whose height was almost equal to his own; but as\nsoon as they were out of sight he said:\n\n\"Raoul, we set out to-night for Paris.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" cried the young man, turning pale.\n\n\"You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy. I\nshall wait for you here till seven.\"\n\nThe young man bent low, with an expression of sorrow and gratitude\nmingled, and retired in order to saddle his horse.\n\nAs to D'Artagnan, scarcely, on his side, was he out of sight when he\ndrew from his pocket a letter, which he read over again:\n\n\n\n\"Return immediately to Paris.--J. M----.\"\n\n\n\n\"The epistle is laconic,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and if there had not been a\npostscript, probably I should not have understood it; but happily there\nis a postscript.\"\n\nAnd he read that welcome postscript, which made him forget the\nabruptness of the letter.\n\n\n\n\"P. S.--Go to the king's treasurer, at Blois; tell him your name and\nshow him this letter; you will receive two hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I admire this piece of prose. The\ncardinal writes better than I thought. Come, Planchet, let us pay a\nvisit to the king's treasurer and then set off.\"\n\n\"Toward Paris, sir?\"\n\n\"Toward Paris.\"\n\nAnd they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain.\n\n\n\n\n16. The Duc de Beaufort.\n\n\n\nThe circumstances that had hastened the return of D'Artagnan to Paris\nwere as follows:\n\nOne evening, when Mazarin, according to custom, went to visit the queen,\nin passing the guard-chamber he heard loud voices; wishing to know on\nwhat topic the soldiers were conversing, he approached with his wonted\nwolf-like step, pushed open the door and put his head close to the\nchink.\n\nThere was a dispute among the guards.\n\n\"I tell you,\" one of them was saying, \"that if Coysel predicted that,\n'tis as good as true; I know nothing about it, but I have heard say that\nhe's not only an astrologer, but a magician.\"\n\n\"Deuce take it, friend, if he's one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in\nsaying so.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he may be tried for it.\"\n\n\"Ah! absurd! they don't burn sorcerers nowadays.\"\n\n\"No? 'Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier,\nthough.\"\n\n\"My friend, Urban Grandier wasn't a sorcerer, he was a learned man.\nHe didn't predict the future, he knew the past--often a more dangerous\nthing.\"\n\nMazarin nodded an assent, but wishing to know what this prediction was,\nabout which they disputed, he remained in the same place.\n\n\"I don't say,\" resumed the guard, \"that Coysel is not a sorcerer, but\nI say that if his prophecy gets wind, it's a sure way to prevent it's\ncoming true.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Why, in this way: if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear\nhim, on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape, 'tis plain that\nthe cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will\nnot escape.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said another guard, who might have been thought asleep on\na bench, but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation, \"do you\nsuppose that men can escape their destiny? If it is written yonder, in\nHeaven, that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape, he will escape; and all\nthe precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it.\"\n\nMazarin started. He was an Italian and therefore superstitious. He\nwalked straight into the midst of the guards, who on seeing him were\nsilent.\n\n\"What were you saying?\" he asked with his flattering manner; \"that\nMonsieur de Beaufort had escaped, were you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my lord!\" said the incredulous soldier. \"He's well guarded now;\nwe only said he would escape.\"\n\n\"Who said so?\"\n\n\"Repeat your story, Saint Laurent,\" replied the man, turning to the\noriginator of the tale.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the guard, \"I have simply mentioned the prophecy I\nheard from a man named Coysel, who believes that, be he ever so\nclosely watched and guarded, the Duke of Beaufort will escape before\nWhitsuntide.\"\n\n\"Coysel is a madman!\" returned the cardinal.\n\n\"No,\" replied the soldier, tenacious in his credulity; \"he has foretold\nmany things which have come to pass; for instance, that the queen would\nhave a son; that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc\nde Guise; and finally, that the coadjutor would be made cardinal. Well!\nthe queen has not only one son, but two; then, Monsieur de Coligny was\nkilled, and----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mazarin, \"but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal!\"\n\n\"No, my lord, but he will be,\" answered the guard.\n\nMazarin made a grimace, as if he meant to say, \"But he does not wear the\ncardinal's cap;\" then he added:\n\n\"So, my friend, it's your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will\nescape?\"\n\n\"That's my idea, my lord; and if your eminence were to offer to make me\nat this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes, I should refuse it.\nAfter Whitsuntide it would be another thing.\"\n\nThere is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction. It has its own\neffect upon the most incredulous; and far from being incredulous,\nMazarin was superstitious. He went away thoughtful and anxious and\nreturned to his own room, where he summoned Bernouin and desired him\nto fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over\nMonsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive.\n\nThe guard had, in fact, touched the cardinal in the tenderest point.\nDuring the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in\nprison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret\ndread of his escape. It was not possible, as he knew well, to confine\nfor the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV., especially when\nthis young prince was scarcely thirty years of age. But however and\nwhensoever he did escape, what hatred he must cherish against him to\nwhom he owed his long imprisonment; who had taken him, rich, brave,\nglorious, beloved by women, feared by men, to cut off his life's best,\nhappiest years; for it is not life, it is merely existence, in prison!\nMeantime, Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke. But like\nthe miser in the fable, he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure.\nOften he awoke in the night, suddenly, dreaming that he had been robbed\nof Monsieur de Beaufort. Then he inquired about him and had the vexation\nof hearing that the prisoner played, drank, sang, but that whilst\nplaying, drinking, singing, he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin\nshould pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into\nat Vincennes.\n\nSo much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep, that\nwhen at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him, his first\nwords were: \"Well, what's the matter? Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped\nfrom Vincennes?\"\n\n\"I do not think so, my lord,\" said Bernouin; \"but you will hear about\nhim, for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence.\"\n\n\"Tell him to come in,\" said Mazarin, arranging his pillows, so that he\nmight receive the visitor sitting up in bed.\n\nThe officer entered, a large fat man, with an open physiognomy. His air\nof perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy.\n\n\"Approach, sir,\" said the cardinal.\n\nThe officer obeyed.\n\n\"Do you know what they are saying here?\"\n\n\"No, your eminence.\"\n\n\"Well, they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from\nVincennes, if he has not done so already.\"\n\nThe officer's face expressed complete stupefaction. He opened at once\nhis little eyes and his great mouth, to inhale better the joke his\neminence deigned to address to him, and ended by a burst of laughter, so\nviolent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done\nin an ague.\n\n\"Escape! my lord--escape! Your eminence does not then know where\nMonsieur de Beaufort is?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, sir; in the donjon of Vincennes.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; in a room, the walls of which are seven feet thick, with\ngrated windows, each bar as thick as my arm.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Mazarin, \"with perseverance one may penetrate through a\nwall; with a watch-spring one may saw through an iron bar.\"\n\n\"Then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him, four\nin his chamber, four in the antechamber, and that they never leave him.\"\n\n\"But he leaves his room, he plays at tennis at the Mall?\"\n\n\"Sir, those amusements are allowed; but if your eminence wishes it, we\nwill discontinue the permission.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Mazarin, fearing that should his prisoner ever leave\nhis prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus\nretrenched his amusement. He then asked with whom he played.\n\n\"My lord, either with the officers of the guard, with the other\nprisoners, or with me.\"\n\n\"But does he not approach the walls while playing?\"\n\n\"Your eminence doesn't know those walls; they are sixty feet high and I\ndoubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his\nneck by jumping off.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the cardinal, beginning to feel more comfortable. \"You mean\nto say, then, my dear Monsieur la Ramee----\"\n\n\"That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself\ninto a little bird, I will continue answerable for him.\"\n\n\"Take care! you assert a great deal,\" said Mazarin. \"Monsieur de\nBeaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often\nthought what he should do in case he were put into prison, and that he\nhad found out forty ways of escaping.\"\n\n\"My lord, if among these forty there had been one good way he would have\nbeen out long ago.\"\n\n\"Come, come; not such a fool as I fancied!\" thought Mazarin.\n\n\"Besides, my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor\nof Vincennes,\" continued La Ramee, \"and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not\nfriendly to Monsieur de Beaufort.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes absent.\"\n\n\"When he is absent I am there.\"\n\n\"But when you leave him, for instance?\"\n\n\"Oh! when I leave him, I place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to\nbe his majesty's special guard. I promise you he keeps a good watch over\nthe prisoner. During the three weeks that he has been with me, I have\nonly had to reproach him with one thing--being too severe with the\nprisoners.\"\n\n\"And who is this Cerberus?\"\n\n\"A certain Monsieur Grimaud, my lord.\"\n\n\"And what was he before he went to Vincennes?\"\n\n\"He was in the country, as I was told by the person who recommended him\nto me.\"\n\n\"And who recommended this man to you?\"\n\n\"The steward of the Duc de Grammont.\"\n\n\"He is not a gossip, I hope?\"\n\n\"Lord a mercy, my lord! I thought for a long time that he was dumb;\nhe answers only by signs. It seems his former master accustomed him to\nthat.\"\n\n\"Well, dear Monsieur la Ramee,\" replied the cardinal \"let him prove\na true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural\nmisdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable, and\nin the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king's\nhealth.\"\n\nMazarin was large in promises,--quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur\nGrimaud so bepraised by La Ramee; for he said nothing and did much.\n\nIt was now nine o'clock. The cardinal, therefore, got up, perfumed\nhimself, dressed, and went to the queen to tell her what had detained\nhim. The queen, who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort\nthan the cardinal himself, and who was almost as superstitious as he\nwas, made him repeat word for word all La Ramee's praises of his deputy.\nThen, when the cardinal had ended:\n\n\"Alas, sir! why have we not a Grimaud near every prince?\"\n\n\"Patience!\" replied Mazarin, with his Italian smile; \"that may happen\none day; but in the meantime----\"\n\n\"Well, in the meantime?\"\n\n\"I shall still take precautions.\"\n\nAnd he wrote to D'Artagnan to hasten his return.\n\n\n\n\n17. Describes how the Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the\nDonjon of Vincennes.\n\n\n\nThe captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and\nwhose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court, was\nwholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal.\n\nHe had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the\nfruitlessness of any attempt at escape. His vengeance, therefore,\nconsisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin; he even tried to\nmake some verses on him, but soon gave up the attempt, for Monsieur de\nBeaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying,\nhe had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose.\n\nThe duke was the grandson of Henry VI. and Gabrielle d'Estrees--as\ngood-natured, as brave, as proud, and above all, as Gascon as his\nancestor, but less elaborately educated. After having been for some time\nafter the death of Louis XIII. the favorite, the confidant, the first\nman, in short, at the court, he had been obliged to yield his place to\nMazarin and so became the second in influence and favor; and eventually,\nas he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position, the\nqueen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant,\nwho made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history\nand whom we shall see again. It is understood, of course, that when we\nsay \"the queen,\" Mazarin is meant.\n\nDuring the five years of this seclusion, which would have improved\nand matured the intellect of any other man, M. de Beaufort, had he not\naffected to brave the cardinal, despise princes, and walk alone without\nadherents or disciples, would either have regained his liberty or made\npartisans. But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every\nday the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant\nas possible to the minister.\n\nAfter having failed in poetry, Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing.\nHe drew portraits, with a piece of coal, of the cardinal; and as his\ntalents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness, he wrote\nunder the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the\noriginal: \"Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb, Mazarin.\" Monsieur de\nChavigny, the governor of Vincennes, waited upon the duke to request\nthat he would amuse himself in some other way, or that at all events, if\nhe drew likenesses, he would not put mottoes underneath them. The next\nday the prisoner's room was full of pictures and mottoes. Monsieur\nde Beaufort, in common with many other prisoners, was bent upon doing\nthings that were prohibited; and the only resource the governor had\nwas, one day when the duke was playing at tennis, to efface all these\ndrawings, consisting chiefly of profiles. M. de Beaufort did not venture\nto draw the cardinal's fat face.\n\nThe duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having, as he said, cleaned\nhis drawing-paper for him; he then divided the walls of his room into\ncompartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident\nin Mazarin's life. In one was depicted the \"Illustrious Coxcomb\"\nreceiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio, whose servant he\nhad been; another, the \"Illustrious Mazarin\" acting the part of Ignatius\nLoyola in a tragedy of that name; a third, the \"Illustrious Mazarin\"\nstealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de Chavigny, who\nhad expected to have it; a fourth, the \"Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin\"\nrefusing to give Laporte, the young king's valet, clean sheets, and\nsaving that \"it was quite enough for the king of France to have clean\nsheets every three months.\"\n\nThe governor, of course, thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if\nhe did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive\nhim of all the means of amusing himself in that manner. To this Monsieur\nde Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing\nhimself in arms was taken from him, he wished to make himself celebrated\nin the arts; since he could not be a Bayard, he would become a Raphael\nor a Michael Angelo. Nevertheless, one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was\nwalking in the meadow his fire was put out, his charcoal all removed,\ntaken away; and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed.\n\nThe poor duke swore, fell into a rage, yelled, and declared that they\nwished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano\nand the Grand Prior of Vendome; but he refused to promise that he would\nnot make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all\nthe winter.\n\nHis next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers. With this\nanimal, which he called Pistache, he was often shut up for hours alone,\nsuperintending, as every one supposed, its education. At last, when\nPistache was sufficiently well trained, Monsieur de Beaufort invited the\ngovernor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he\nwas going to have in his apartment.\n\nThe party assembled, the room was lighted with waxlights, and the\nprisoner, with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his\nroom, had traced a long white line, representing a cord, on the floor.\nPistache, on a signal from his master, placed himself on this line,\nraised himself on his hind paws, and holding in his front paws a wand\nwith which clothes used to be beaten, he began to dance upon the line\nwith as many contortions as a rope-dancer. Having been several times\nup and down it, he gave the wand back to his master and began without\nhesitation to perform the same evolutions over again.\n\nThe intelligent creature was received with loud applause.\n\nThe first part of the entertainment being concluded Pistache was desired\nto say what o'clock it was; he was shown Monsieur de Chavigny's watch;\nit was then half-past six; the dog raised and dropped his paw six times;\nthe seventh he let it remain upraised. Nothing could be better done; a\nsun-dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision.\n\nThen the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the\nprisons in France.\n\nThe dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself,\nwith the deepest respect, at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny, who at\nfirst seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud, but a\nfrown succeeded, and he bit his lips with vexation.\n\nThen the duke put to Pistache this difficult question, who was the\ngreatest thief in the world?\n\nPistache went again around the circle, but stopped at no one, and at\nlast went to the door and began to scratch and bark.\n\n\"See, gentlemen,\" said M. de Beaufort, \"this wonderful animal, not\nfinding here what I ask for, seeks it out of doors; you shall, however,\nhave his answer. Pistache, my friend, come here. Is not the greatest\nthief in the world, Monsieur (the king's secretary) Le Camus, who came\nto Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten\nmillions?\"\n\nThe dog shook his head.\n\n\"Then is it not,\" resumed the duke, \"the Superintendent Emery, who gave\nhis son, when he was married, three hundred thousand francs and a house,\ncompared to which the Tuileries are a heap of ruins and the Louvre a\npaltry building?\"\n\nThe dog again shook his head as if to say \"no.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the prisoner, \"let's think who it can be. Can it be, can it\npossibly be, the 'Illustrious Coxcomb, Mazarin de Piscina,' hey?\"\n\nPistache made violent signs that it was, by raising and lowering his\nhead eight or ten times successively.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you see,\" said the duke to those present, who dared not even\nsmile, \"that it is the 'Illustrious Coxcomb' who is the greatest thief\nin the world; at least, according to Pistache.\"\n\n\"Let us go on to another of his exercises.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen!\"--there was a profound silence in the room when the duke\nagain addressed them--\"do you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught\nall the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons, whom he styled\n'the fairest of the fair?' Pistache is going to show you how superior\nhe is to all other dogs. Monsieur de Chavigny, be so good as to lend me\nyour cane.\"\n\nMonsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort. Monsieur\nde Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot.\n\n\"Now, Pistache, my good dog, jump the height of this cane for Madame de\nMontbazon.\"\n\n\"But,\" interposed Monsieur de Chavigny, \"it seems to me that Pistache is\nonly doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle\nde Pons.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said the duke, \"Pistache, jump for the queen.\" And he raised his\ncane six inches higher.\n\nThe dog sprang, and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it.\n\n\"And now,\" said the duke, raising it still six inches higher, \"jump for\nthe king.\"\n\nThe dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said the duke, and as he spoke, lowered the cane almost\nlevel with the ground; \"Pistache, my friend, jump for the 'Illustrious\nCoxcomb, Mazarin de Piscina.'\"\n\nThe dog turned his back to the cane.\n\n\"What,\" asked the duke, \"what do you mean?\" and he gave him the cane\nagain, first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache.\n\"Jump then, Monsieur Pistache.\"\n\nBut Pistache, as at first, turned round on his legs and stood with his\nback to the cane.\n\nMonsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time, but by this time\nPistache's patience was exhausted; he threw himself furiously upon the\ncane, wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his\nteeth.\n\nMonsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented\nthem with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny, saying that for that\nevening the entertainment was ended, but in three months it should be\nrepeated, when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks.\n\nThree days afterward Pistache was found dead--poisoned.\n\nThen the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with\nwhich they meant to poison him; and one day after dinner he went to\nbed, calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had\npoisoned him.\n\nThis fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed\nhim greatly. The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy\nand Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal\nOrnano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight\nin arsenic--a bon mot which had great success. So it was ordered the\nprisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been\ntasted, and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster.\n\nEvery kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in\nreturn for the insults of the innocent Pistache. De Chavigny, who,\naccording to report, was a son of Richelieu's, and had been a creature\nof the late cardinal's, understood tyranny. He took from the duke all\nthe steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives\nand wooden forks, pretending that as he had been informed that the duke\nwas to pass all his life at Vincennes, he was afraid of his prisoner\nattempting suicide. A fortnight afterward the duke, going to the tennis\ncourt, found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger\nplanted by the roadside; he asked what they were for and was told that\nthey were to shade him from the sun on some future day. One morning\nthe gardener went to him and told him, as if to please him, that he was\ngoing to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use. Now, since, as\nevery one knows, asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection,\nthis civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort.\n\nAt last his patience was exhausted. He assembled his keepers, and\nnotwithstanding his well-known difficulty of utterance, addressed them\nas follows:\n\n\"Gentlemen! will you permit a grandson of Henry IV. to be overwhelmed\nwith insults and ignominy?\n\n\"Odds fish! as my grandfather used to say, I once reigned in Paris! do\nyou know that? I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my\ncare. The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man\nin the kingdom. Gentlemen and citizens, set me free; I shall go to the\nLouvre and strangle Mazarin. You shall be my body-guard. I will make you\nall captains, with good pensions! Odds fish! On! march forward!\"\n\nBut eloquent as he might be, the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV.\ndid not touch those hearts of stone; not one man stirred, so Monsieur\nde Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of\nrascals underneath the sun.\n\nSometimes, when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit, the duke used to\nask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians, all fully\narmed, appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison.\n\n\"My lord,\" answered De Chavigny, with a low bow, \"I have on the ramparts\ntwenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns.\nI should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was\nunexploded.\"\n\n\"Yes, but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would\ntake the donjon; the donjon being taken, I should be obliged to let them\nhang you--at which I should be most unhappy, certainly.\"\n\nAnd in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavigny.\n\n\"For myself, on the other hand, my lord,\" returned the governor, \"when\nthe first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should\nbe obliged to kill you with my own hand, since you were confided\npeculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up, dead or\nalive.\"\n\nAnd once more he bowed low before his highness.\n\nThese bitter-sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes, sometimes longer,\nbut always finished thus:\n\nMonsieur de Chavigny, turning toward the door, used to call out:\n\"Halloo! La Ramee!\"\n\nLa Ramee came into the room.\n\n\"La Ramee, I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you, particularly; treat him\nas a man of his rank and family ought to be treated; that is, never\nleave him alone an instant.\"\n\nLa Ramee became, therefore, the duke's dinner guest by compulsion--an\neternal keeper, the shadow of his person; but La Ramee--gay, frank,\nconvivial, fond of play, a great hand at tennis, had one defect in the\nduke's eyes--his incorruptibility.\n\nNow, although La Ramee appreciated, as of a certain value, the honor of\nbeing shut up with a prisoner of so great importance, still the pleasure\nof living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV. hardly compensated\nfor the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time\nto visit his family.\n\nOne may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and\nhusband. La Ramee adored his wife and children, whom now he could only\ncatch a glimpse of from the top of the wall, when in order to please him\nthey used to walk on the opposite side of the moat. 'Twas too brief an\nenjoyment, and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded\nas the cause of health (of which it was perhaps rather the result) would\nnot long survive such a mode of life.\n\nHe accepted, therefore, with delight, an offer made to him by his friend\nthe steward of the Duc de Grammont, to give him a substitute; he also\nspoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny, who promised that he would not\noppose it in any way--that is, if he approved of the person proposed.\n\nWe consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud;\nif, as we hope, our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part\nof this work, they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable\nindividual, who is wholly unchanged, except that he is twenty years\nolder, an advance in life that has made him only more silent; although,\nsince the change that had been working in himself, Athos had given\nGrimaud permission to speak.\n\nBut Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence,\nand a habit of fifteen or twenty years' duration becomes second nature.\n\n\n\n\n18. Grimaud begins his Functions.\n\n\n\nGrimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the\ndonjon of Vincennes. Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his\ninfallible penetration; for that which almost proved that he was the son\nof Richelieu was his everlasting pretension; he examined attentively the\ncountenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted\neyebrows, thin lips, hooked nose, and prominent cheek-bones of Grimaud\nwere favorable signs. He addressed about twelve words to him; Grimaud\nanswered in four.\n\n\"Here's a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits,\"\nsaid Monsieur de Chavigny. \"Go,\" he added, \"and make yourself agreeable\nto Monsieur la Ramee, and tell him that you suit me in all respects.\"\n\nGrimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to\nhave a deputy. So, after a thousand questions which met with only a word\nin reply, La Ramee, fascinated by this sobriety in speech, rubbed his\nhands and engaged Grimaud.\n\n\"My orders?\" asked Grimaud.\n\n\"They are these; never to leave the prisoner alone; to keep away from\nhim every pointed or cutting instrument, and to prevent his conversing\nany length of time with the keepers.\"\n\n\"Those are all?\" asked Grimaud.\n\n\"All now,\" replied La Ramee.\n\n\"Good,\" answered Grimaud; and he went right to the prisoner.\n\nThe duke was in the act of combing his beard, which he had allowed\nto grow, as well as his hair, in order to reproach Mazarin with his\nwretched appearance and condition. But having some days previously seen\nfrom the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage, and\nstill cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman, he did not wish\nto be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin, and in the hope of seeing\nher again, had asked for a leaden comb, which was allowed him. The\ncomb was to be a leaden one, because his beard, like that of most fair\npeople, was rather red; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it.\n\nAs Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea-table; he took it up, and\nas he took it he made a low bow.\n\nThe duke looked at this strange figure with surprise. The figure put the\ncomb in its pocket.\n\n\"Ho! hey! what's that?\" cried the duke. \"Who is this creature?\"\n\nGrimaud did not answer, but bowed a second time.\n\n\"Art thou dumb?\" cried the duke.\n\nGrimaud made a sign that he was not.\n\n\"What art thou, then? Answer! I command thee!\" said the duke.\n\n\"A keeper,\" replied Grimaud.\n\n\"A keeper!\" reiterated the duke; \"there was nothing wanting in my\ncollection, except this gallows-bird. Halloo! La Ramee! some one!\"\n\nLa Ramee ran in haste to obey the call.\n\n\"Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket?\" asked\nthe duke.\n\n\"One of your guards, my prince; a man of talent and merit, whom you will\nlike, as I and Monsieur de Chavigny do, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Why does he take my comb?\"\n\n\"Why do you take my lord's comb?\" asked La Ramee.\n\nGrimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the\nlargest teeth, pronounced this one word, \"Pointed.\"\n\n\"True,\" said La Ramee.\n\n\"What does the animal say?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed\ninstrument.\"\n\n\"Are you mad, La Ramee? You yourself gave me this comb.\"\n\n\"I was very wrong, my lord, for in giving it to you I acted in\nopposition to my orders.\"\n\nThe duke looked furiously at Grimaud.\n\n\"I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion,\" he\nmuttered.\n\nGrimaud, nevertheless, was resolved for certain reasons not at once to\ncome to a full rupture with the prisoner; he wanted to inspire, not\na sudden repugnance, but a good, sound, steady hatred; he retired,\ntherefore, and gave place to four guards, who, having breakfasted, could\nattend on the prisoner.\n\nA fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke. He had asked for\ncrawfish for his breakfast on the following morning; he intended to pass\nthe day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these\nfish in the middle of his room--the red color evidently conveying an\nallusion to the cardinal--so that he might have the pleasure of hanging\nMazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more\nsignificant than a crawfish.\n\nThe day was employed in preparations for the execution. Every one\ngrows childish in prison, but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was\nparticularly disposed to become so. In the course of his morning's walk\nhe collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small\npiece of broken glass, a discovery that quite delighted him. When he\ncame home he formed his handkerchief into a loop.\n\nNothing of all this escaped Grimaud, but La Ramee looked on with the\ncuriosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea\nconcerning a new toy for his children. The guards looked on it with\nindifference. When everything was ready, the gallows hung in the middle\nof the room, the loop made, and when the duke had cast a glance upon the\nplate of crawfish, in order to select the finest specimen among them, he\nlooked around for his piece of glass; it had disappeared.\n\n\"Who has taken my piece of glass?\" asked the duke, frowning. Grimaud\nmade a sign to denote that he had done so.\n\n\"What! thou again! Why didst thou take it?\"\n\n\"Yes--why?\" asked La Ramee.\n\nGrimaud, who held the piece of glass in his hand, said: \"Sharp.\"\n\n\"True, my lord!\" exclaimed La Ramee. \"Ah! deuce take it! we have a\nprecious fellow here!\"\n\n\"Monsieur Grimaud!\" said the duke, \"for your sake I beg of you, never\ncome within the reach of my fist!\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" cried La Ramee, \"give me your gibbet, my lord. I will\nshape it out for you with my knife.\"\n\nAnd he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible.\n\n\"That's it,\" said the duke, \"now make me a little hole in the floor\nwhilst I go and fetch the culprit.\"\n\nLa Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor; meanwhile the duke\nhung the crawfish up by a thread. Then he placed the gibbet in the\nmiddle of the room, bursting with laughter.\n\nLa Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus; Grimaud,\nhowever, did not even smile. He approached La Ramee and showing him the\ncrawfish hung up by the thread:\n\n\"Cardinal,\" he said.\n\n\"Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort!\" cried the prisoner,\nlaughing violently, \"and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee, the\nking's commissioner.\"\n\nLa Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet, which he\nbroke at once and threw the pieces out of the window. He was going to\nthrow the crawfish out also, when Grimaud snatched it from his hands.\n\n\"Good to eat!\" he said, and put it in his pocket.\n\nThis scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud\nfor his part in it; but on reflection he hated him more and more, being\nconvinced he had some evil motive for his conduct.\n\nBut the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the\ndonjon and even outside. Monsieur de Chavigny, who at heart detested the\ncardinal, took pains to tell the story to two or three friends, who put\nit into immediate circulation.\n\nThe prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very\ngood countenance; and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the\nmore and more odious to him. One morning he took this man on one side\nand had succeeded in speaking to him, when Grimaud entered and seeing\nwhat was going on approached the duke respectfully, but took the guard\nby the arm.\n\n\"Go away,\" he said.\n\nThe guard obeyed.\n\n\"You are insupportable!\" cried the duke; \"I shall beat you.\"\n\nGrimaud bowed.\n\n\"I will break every bone in your body!\" cried the duke.\n\nGrimaud bowed, but stepped back.\n\n\"Mr. Spy,\" cried the duke, more and more enraged, \"I will strangle you\nwith my own hands.\"\n\nAnd he extended his hands toward Grimaud, who merely thrust the guard\nout and shut the door behind him. At the same time he felt the duke's\narms on his shoulders like two iron claws; but instead either of calling\nout or defending himself, he placed his forefinger on his lips and said\nin a low tone:\n\n\"Hush!\" smiling as he uttered the word.\n\nA gesture, a smile and a word from Grimaud, all at once, were so unusual\nthat his highness stopped short, astounded.\n\nGrimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming\nlittle note with an aristocratic seal, and presented it to the duke\nwithout a word.\n\nThe duke, more and more bewildered, let Grimaud loose and took the note.\n\n\"From Madame de Montbazon?\" he cried.\n\nGrimaud nodded assent.\n\nThe duke tore open the note, passed his hands over his eyes, for he was\ndazzled and confused, and read:\n\n\n\n\"My Dear Duke,--You may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give\nyou this note; he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and\nto shut himself up at Vincennes with you, in order to prepare and assist\nyour escape, which we are contriving. The moment of your deliverance is\nat hand; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time\nand absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments\nthey have so long professed and truly entertained.\n\n\"Yours wholly and most affectionately\n\n\"Marie de Montbazon.\n\n\"P.S.--I sign my full name, for I should be vain if I could suppose that\nafter five years of absence you would remember my initials.\"\n\n\n\nThe poor duke became perfectly giddy. What for five years he had been\nwanting--a faithful servant, a friend, a helping hand--seemed to have\nfallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least.\n\n\"Oh, dearest Marie! she thinks of me, then, after five years of\nseparation! Heavens! there is constancy!\" Then turning to Grimaud, he\nsaid:\n\n\"And thou, my brave fellow, thou consentest thus to aid me?\"\n\nGrimaud signified his assent.\n\n\"And you have come here with that purpose?\"\n\nGrimaud repeated the sign.\n\n\"And I was ready to strangle you!\" cried the duke.\n\nGrimaud smiled.\n\n\"Wait, then,\" said the duke, fumbling in his pocket. \"Wait,\" he\ncontinued, renewing his fruitless search; \"it shall not be said that\nsuch devotion to a grandson of Henry IV. went without recompense.\"\n\nThe duke's endeavors evinced the best intention in the world, but one\nof the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to\nkeep no money. Whereupon Grimaud, observing the duke's disappointment,\ndrew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him.\n\n\"Here is what you are looking for,\" he said.\n\nThe duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimaud's hands,\nbut Grimaud shook his head.\n\n\"Thank you, monseigneur,\" he said, drawing back; \"I am paid.\"\n\nThe duke went from one surprise to another. He held out his hand.\nGrimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully. The grand manner of Athos\nhad left its mark on Grimaud.\n\n\"What shall we do? and when? and how proceed?\"\n\n\"It is now eleven,\" answered Grimaud. \"Let my lord at two o'clock ask\nleave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or\nthree balls over the ramparts.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works\nin the moat to send them back again.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the duke.\n\nGrimaud made a sign that he was going away.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the duke, \"will you not accept any money from me?\"\n\n\"I wish my lord would make me one promise.\"\n\n\"What! speak!\"\n\n\"'Tis this: when we escape together, that I shall go everywhere and be\nalways first; for if my lord should be overtaken and caught, there's\nevery chance of his being brought back to prison, whereas if I am caught\nthe least that can befall me is to be--hung.\"\n\n\"True, on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest.\"\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Grimaud, \"I've only one thing more to ask--that your\nhighness will continue to detest me.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said the duke.\n\nAt this moment La Ramee, after the interview we have described with the\ncardinal, entered the room. The duke had thrown himself, as he was wont\nto do in moments of dullness and vexation, on his bed. La Ramee cast\nan inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy\nbetween the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward\nsatisfaction. Then turning to Grimaud:\n\n\"Very good, my friend, very good. You have been spoken of in a promising\nquarter and you will soon, I hope, have news that will be agreeable to\nyou.\"\n\nGrimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew, as was his custom\non the entrance of his superior.\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" said La Ramee, with his rude laugh, \"you still set\nyourself against this poor fellow?\"\n\n\"So! 'tis you, La Ramee; in faith, 'tis time you came back again. I\nthrew myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall, that I mightn't\nbreak my promise and strangle Grimaud.\"\n\n\"I doubt, however,\" said La Ramee, in sprightly allusion to the silence\nof his subordinate, \"if he has said anything disagreeable to your\nhighness.\"\n\n\"Pardieu! you are right--a mute from the East! I swear it was time for\nyou to come back, La Ramee, and I was eager to see you again.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur is too good,\" said La Ramee, flattered by the compliment.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the duke, \"really, I feel bored today beyond the power\nof description.\"\n\n\"Then let us have a match in the tennis court,\" exclaimed La Ramee.\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, my lord.\"\n\n\"I protest, my dear La Ramee,\" said the duke, \"that you are a charming\nfellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure\nof your society.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied La Ramee, \"I think if it depended on the cardinal\nyour wishes would be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Have you seen him lately?\"\n\n\"He sent for me to-day.\"\n\n\"Really! to speak to you about me?\"\n\n\"Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me? Really, my lord, you\nare his nightmare.\"\n\nThe duke smiled with bitterness.\n\n\"Ah, La Ramee! if you would but accept my offers! I would make your\nfortune.\"\n\n\"How? you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be\nconfiscated.\"\n\n\"I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of Paris.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! pshaw! I cannot hear such things said as that; this is a fine\nconversation with an officer of the king! I see, my lord, I shall be\nobliged to fetch a second Grimaud!\"\n\n\"Very well, let us say no more about it. So you and the cardinal have\nbeen talking about me? La Ramee, some day when he sends for you,\nyou must let me put on your clothes; I will go in your stead; I will\nstrangle him, and upon my honor, if that is made a condition I will\nreturn to prison.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I see well that I must call Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Well, I am wrong. And what did the cuistre [pettifogger] say about me?\"\n\n\"I admit the word, monseigneur, because it rhymes with ministre\n[minister]. What did he say to me? He told me to watch you.\"\n\n\"And why so? why watch me?\" asked the duke uneasily.\n\n\"Because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape.\"\n\n\"Ah! an astrologer predicted that?\" said the duke, starting in spite of\nhimself.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! yes! those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things\nto torment honest people.\"\n\n\"And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence?\"\n\n\"That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not\nto buy one.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a\nbird.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, that is true. Let us go and have a game at tennis, La\nRamee.\"\n\n\"My lord--I beg your highness's pardon--but I must beg for half an\nhour's leave of absence.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness, though\nnot of such high birth: he forgot to ask me to breakfast.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I send for some breakfast here?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite\nthe castle--Daddy Marteau, as they called him----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris, an\ninvalid, ordered country air for his health.\"\n\n\"Well, what have I to do with that?\"\n\n\"Why, good Lord! this man, your highness, when he saw me stop before\nhis shop, where he has a display of things which would make your mouth\nwater, my lord, asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the\ndonjon. 'I bought,' said he, 'the business of my predecessor on the\nstrength of his assurance that he supplied the castle; whereas, on\nmy honor, Monsieur de Chavigny, though I've been here a week, has not\nordered so much as a tartlet.' 'But,' I then replied, 'probably Monsieur\nde Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good.' 'My pastry not good!\nWell, Monsieur La Ramee, you shall judge of it yourself and at once.' 'I\ncannot,' I replied; 'it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the\nchateau.' 'Very well,' said he, 'go and attend to your affairs, since\nyou seem to be in a hurry, but come back in half an hour.' 'In half an\nhour?' 'Yes, have you breakfasted?' 'Faith, no.' 'Well, here is a pate\nthat will be ready for you, with a bottle of old Burgundy.' So, you see,\nmy lord, since I am hungry, I would, with your highness's leave----\" And\nLa Ramee bent low.\n\n\"Go, then, animal,\" said the duke; \"but remember, I only allow you half\nan hour.\"\n\n\"May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau, my lord?\"\n\n\"Yes, if he does not put mushrooms in his pies; thou knowest that\nmushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my family.\"\n\nLa Ramee went out, but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard\nentered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the\nprisoner should never be left alone a moment.\n\nBut during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the\nnote from Madame de Montbazon, which proved to the prisoner that his\nfriends were concerting plans for his deliverance, but in what way he\nknew not.\n\nBut his confidence in Grimaud, whose petty persecutions he now perceived\nwere only a blind, increased, and he conceived the highest opinion of\nhis intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance.\n\n\n\n\n19. In which the Contents of the Pates made by the Successor of Father\nMarteau are described.\n\n\n\nIn half an hour La Ramee returned, full of glee, like most men who have\neaten, and more especially drank to their heart's content. The pates\nwere excellent, the wine delicious.\n\nThe weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air.\n\nAt two o'clock the tennis balls began, according to Grimaud's\ndirections, to take the direction of the moat, much to the joy of La\nRamee, who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat;\nand very soon balls were wanting, so many had gone over. La Ramee then\nproposed to send some one to pick them up, but the duke remarked that\nit would be losing time; and going near the rampart himself and looking\nover, he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared\nout by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat.\n\n\"Hey, friend!\" cried the duke.\n\nThe man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of\nsurprise. The peasant, the gardener, was Rochefort, whom he believed to\nbe in the Bastile.\n\n\"Well? Who's up there?\" said the man.\n\n\"Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls,\" said the duke.\n\nThe gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls, which were picked\nup by La Ramee and the guard. One, however, fell at the duke's feet, and\nseeing that it was intended for him, he put it into his pocket.\n\nLa Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood.\n\nThe duke went indoors and retired to bed, where he spent, indeed, the\ngreater part of every day, as they had taken his books away. La Ramee\ncarried off all his clothes, in order to be certain that the duke would\nnot stir. However, the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster\nand as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball\nwith his teeth and found underneath the following letter:\n\n\n\nMy Lord,--Your friends are watching over you and the hour of your\ndeliverance is at hand. Ask day after to-morrow to have a pie supplied\nyou by the new confectioner opposite the castle, and who is no other\nthan Noirmont, your former maitre d'hotel. Do not open the pie till you\nare alone. I hope you will be satisfied with its contents.\n\n\"Your highness's most devoted servant,\n\n\"In the Bastile, as elsewhere,\n\n\"Comte de Rochefort.\"\n\n\nThe duke, who had latterly been allowed a fire, burned the letter, but\nkept the ball, and went to bed, hiding the ball under his bolster. La\nRamee entered; he smiled kindly on the prisoner, for he was an excellent\nman and had taken a great liking for the captive prince. He endeavored\nto cheer him up in his solitude.\n\n\"Ah, my friend!\" cried the duke, \"you are so good; if I could but do\nas you do, and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father\nMarteau's successor.\"\n\n\"'Tis true, my lord,\" answered La Ramee, \"that his pates are famous and\nhis wine magnificent.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said the duke, \"his cellar and kitchen might easily excel\nthose of Monsieur de Chavigny.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" said La Ramee, falling into the trap, \"what is there to\nprevent your trying them? Besides, I have promised him your patronage.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the duke. \"If I am to remain here permanently,\nas Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand, I must provide\nmyself with a diversion for my old age, I must turn gourmand.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said La Ramee, \"if you will take a bit of good advice, don't\nput that off till you are old.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the Duc de Beaufort to himself, \"every man in order that he\nmay lose his heart and soul, must receive from celestial bounty one of\nthe seven capital sins, perhaps two; it seems that Master La Ramee's is\ngluttony. Let us then take advantage of it.\" Then, aloud:\n\n\"Well, my dear La Ramee! the day after to-morrow is a holiday.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord--Pentecost.\"\n\n\"Will you give me a lesson the day after to-morrow?\"\n\n\"In what?\"\n\n\"In gastronomy?\"\n\n\"Willingly, my lord.\"\n\n\"But tete-a-tete. Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of\nMonsieur de Chavigny; we'll have a supper here under your direction.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said La Ramee.\n\nThe proposal was seductive, but La Ramee was an old stager, acquainted\nwith all the traps a prisoner was likely to set. Monsieur de Beaufort\nhad said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison. Did this\nproposed breakfast cover some stratagem? He reflected, but he remembered\nthat he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore\nthat no powder could be mixed with the food, no drug with the wine. As\nto getting him drunk, the duke couldn't hope to do that, and he laughed\nat the mere thought of it. Then an idea came to him which harmonized\neverything.\n\nThe duke had followed with anxiety La Ramee's unspoken soliloquy,\nreading it from point to point upon his face. But presently the exempt's\nface suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Well,\" he asked, \"that will do, will it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, on one condition.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That Grimaud shall wait on us at table.\"\n\nNothing could be more agreeable to the duke, however, he had presence of\nmind enough to exclaim:\n\n\"To the devil with your Grimaud! He will spoil the feast.\"\n\n\"I will direct him to stand behind your chair, and since he doesn't\nspeak, your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little\neffort can imagine him a hundred miles away.\"\n\n\"Do you know, my friend, I find one thing very evident in all this, you\ndistrust me.\"\n\n\"My lord, the day after to-morrow is Pentecost.\"\n\n\"Well, what is Pentecost to me? Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will\ncome as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; but I have already told you what that damned magician\npredicted.\"\n\n\"And what was it?\"\n\n\"That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being\nout of Vincennes.\"\n\n\"You believe in sorcerers, then, you fool?\"\n\n\"I---I mind them no more than that----\" and he snapped his fingers;\n\"but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them; as an Italian he is\nsuperstitious.\"\n\nThe duke shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, then,\" with well acted good-humor, \"I allow Grimaud, but no one\nelse; you must manage it all. Order whatever you like for supper--the\nonly thing I specify is one of those pies; and tell the confectioner\nthat I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his\npies--not only now, but when I leave my prison.\"\n\n\"Then you think you will some day leave it?\" said La Ramee.\n\n\"The devil!\" replied the prince; \"surely, at the death of Mazarin. I\nam fifteen years younger than he is. At Vincennes, 'tis true, one lives\nfaster----\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied La Ramee, \"my lord----\"\n\n\"Or dies sooner, for it comes to the same thing.\"\n\nLa Ramee was going out. He stopped, however, at the door for an instant.\n\n\"Whom does your highness wish me to send to you?\"\n\n\"Any one, except Grimaud.\"\n\n\"The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFive minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be\nimmersed in the sublime combinations of chess.\n\nA strange thing is the mind, and it is wonderful what revolutions may be\nwrought in it by a sign, a word, a hope. The duke had been five years in\nprison, and now to him, looking back upon them, those five years, which\nhad passed so slowly, seemed not so long a time as were the two days,\nthe forty-eight hours, which still parted him from the time fixed for\nhis escape. Besides, there was one thing that engaged his most anxious\nthought--in what way was the escape to be effected? They had told him\nto hope for it, but had not told him what was to be hidden in the\nmysterious pate. And what friends awaited him without? He had friends,\nthen, after five years in prison? If that were so he was indeed a highly\nfavored prince. He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex, a\nwoman, strange to say, had remembered him. It is true that she had not,\nperhaps, been scrupulously faithful to him, but she had remembered him;\nthat was something.\n\nSo the duke had more than enough to think about; accordingly he fared\nat chess as he had fared at tennis; he made blunder upon blunder and the\nofficer with whom he played found him easy game.\n\nBut his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way--they\nkilled time for him till eight o'clock in the evening; then would come\nnight, and with night, sleep. So, at least, the duke believed; but sleep\nis a capricious fairy, and it is precisely when one invokes her presence\nthat she is most likely to keep him waiting. The duke waited until\nmidnight, turning on his mattress like St. Laurence on his gridiron.\nFinally he slept.\n\nBut at daybreak he awoke. Wild dreams had disturbed his repose. He\ndreamed that he was endowed with wings--he wished to fly away. For a\ntime these wings supported him, but when he reached a certain height\nthis new aid failed him. His wings were broken and he seemed to sink\ninto a bottomless abyss, whence he awoke, bathed in perspiration and\nnearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen. He fell asleep again\nand another vision appeared. He was in a subterranean passage by\nwhich he was to leave Vincennes. Grimaud was walking before him with\na lantern. By degrees the passage narrowed, yet the duke continued his\ncourse. At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to\nproceed. The sides of the walls seem to close in, even to press\nagainst him. He made fruitless efforts to go on; it was impossible.\nNevertheless, he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front, advancing.\nHe wished to call out to him but could not utter a word. Then at the\nother extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him.\nThese steps came on, came fast. He was discovered; all hope of flight\nwas gone. Still the walls seemed to be closing on him; they appeared to\nbe in concert with his enemies. At last he heard the voice of La Ramee.\nLa Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud. He was captured again, and\nconducted to the low and vaulted chamber, in which Ornano, Puylaurens,\nand his uncle had died. Their three graves were there, rising above the\nground, and a fourth was also there, yawning for its ghastly tenant.\n\nThe duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done\nto go to sleep; and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he\ninquired whether he was ill.\n\n\"In fact,\" said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and\nhad been kept awake by a toothache, brought on by the dampness of the\natmosphere, \"my lord has had a very restless night and two or three\ntimes, while dreaming, he called for help.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with your highness?\" asked La Ramee.\n\n\"'Tis your fault, you simpleton,\" answered the duke. \"With your idle\nnonsense yesterday about escaping, you worried me so that I dreamed that\nI was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so.\"\n\nLa Ramee laughed.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"'tis a warning from Heaven. Never commit such an\nimprudence as to try to escape, except in your dreams.\"\n\n\"And you are right, my dear La Ramee,\" said the duke, wiping away the\nsweat that stood on his brow, wide awake though he was; \"after this I\nwill think of nothing but eating and drinking.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said La Ramee; and one by one he sent away the guards, on\nvarious pretexts.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the duke when they were alone.\n\n\"Well!\" replied La Ramee, \"your supper is ordered.\"\n\n\"Ah! and what is it to be? Monsieur, my majordomo, will there be a pie?\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed--almost as high as a tower.\"\n\n\"You told him it was for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he said he would do his best to please your highness.\"\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed the duke, rubbing his hands.\n\n\"Devil take it, my lord! what a gourmand you are growing; I haven't seen\nyou with so cheerful a face these five years.\"\n\nThe duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought, but at that\nmoment, as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent\nneed of diverting La Ramee's ideas, Grimaud entered and made a sign to\nLa Ramee that he had something to say to him.\n\nLa Ramee drew near to Grimaud, who spoke to him in a low voice.\n\nThe duke meanwhile recovered his self-control.\n\n\"I have already forbidden that man,\" he said, \"to come in here without\nmy permission.\"\n\n\"You must pardon him, my lord,\" said La Ramee, \"for I directed him to\ncome.\"\n\n\"And why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me?\"\n\n\"My lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait\nupon us at that famous supper. My lord has forgotten the supper.\"\n\n\"No, but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud.\"\n\n\"My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to\nbe present.\"\n\n\"Go on, then; have it your own way.\"\n\n\"Come here, my lad,\" said La Ramee, \"and hear what I have to say.\"\n\nGrimaud approached, with a very sullen expression on his face.\n\nLa Ramee continued: \"My lord has done me the honor to invite me to a\nsupper to-morrow en tete-a-tete.\"\n\nGrimaud made a sign which meant that he didn't see what that had to do\nwith him.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said La Ramee, \"the matter concerns you, for you will have\nthe honor to serve us; and besides, however good an appetite we may have\nand however great our thirst, there will be something left on the plates\nand in the bottles, and that something will be yours.\"\n\nGrimaud bowed in thanks.\n\n\"And now,\" said La Ramee, \"I must ask your highness's pardon, but it\nseems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days and he\nhas sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his\ndeparture.\"\n\nThe duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud, but there was no\nglance in Grimaud's eyes.\n\n\"Go, then,\" said the duke, \"and return as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis\nyesterday?\"\n\nGrimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the duke, \"but take care, my dear La Ramee, for I propose to\nbeat you badly.\"\n\nLa Ramee went out. Grimaud looked after him, and when the door was\nclosed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper.\n\n\"Write, my lord,\" he said.\n\n\"And what?\"\n\nGrimaud dictated.\n\n\"All is ready for to-morrow evening. Keep watch from seven to nine. Have\ntwo riding horses ready. We shall descend by the first window in the\ngallery.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"Sign your name, my lord.\"\n\nThe duke signed.\n\n\"Now, my lord, give me, if you have not lost it, the ball--that which\ncontained the letter.\"\n\nThe duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to Grimaud. Grimaud\ngave a grim smile.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"Well, my lord, I sew up the paper in the ball and you, in your game of\ntennis, will send the ball into the ditch.\"\n\n\"But will it not be lost?\"\n\n\"Oh no; there will be some one at hand to pick it up.\"\n\n\"A gardener?\"\n\nGrimaud nodded.\n\n\"The same as yesterday?\"\n\nAnother nod on the part of Grimaud.\n\n\"The Count de Rochefort?\"\n\nGrimaud nodded the third time.\n\n\"Come, now,\" said the duke, \"give some particulars of the plan for our\nescape.\"\n\n\"That is forbidden me,\" said Grimaud, \"until the last moment.\"\n\n\"Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it, my lord.\"\n\n\"But at least, if you don't want to see me turn crazy, tell what that\nfamous pate will contain.\"\n\n\"Two poniards, a knotted rope and a poire d'angoisse.\" *\n\n     *This poire d'angoisse was a famous gag, in the form of a\n     pear, which, being thrust into the mouth, by the aid of a\n     spring, dilated, so as to distend the jaws to their greatest\n     width.\n\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\n\n\"My lord observes that there will be enough to go around.\"\n\n\"We shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope,\" replied the\nduke.\n\n\"And make La Ramee eat the pear,\" answered Grimaud.\n\n\"My dear Grimaud, thou speakest seldom, but when thou dost, one must do\nthee justice--thy words are words of gold.\"\n\n\n\n\n20. One of Marie Michon's Adventures.\n\n\n\nWhilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and\nGrimaud, the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were\nentering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel.\n\nThey stopped at the sign of the Fox, in the Rue du Vieux Colombier, a\ntavern known for many years by Athos, and asked for two bedrooms.\n\n\"You must dress yourself, Raoul,\" said Athos, \"I am going to present you\nto some one.\"\n\n\"To-day, monsieur?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"In half an hour.\"\n\nThe young man bowed. Perhaps, not being endowed with the endurance of\nAthos, who seemed to be made of iron, he would have preferred a bath in\nthe river Seine of which he had heard so much, and afterward his bed;\nbut the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Athos, \"take some pains with your toilet, Raoul; I\nwant you to be approved.\"\n\n\"I hope, sir,\" replied the youth, smiling, \"that there's no idea of a\nmarriage for me; you know of my engagement to Louise?\"\n\nAthos, in his turn, smiled also.\n\n\"No, don't be alarmed, although it is to a lady that I am going to\npresent you, and I am anxious that you should love her----\"\n\nThe young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness, but at a\nsmile from Athos he was quickly reassured.\n\n\"How old is she?\" inquired the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\n\n\"My dear Raoul, learn, once for all, that that is a question which is\nnever asked. When you can find out a woman's age by her face, it is\nuseless to ask it; when you cannot do so, it is indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Is she beautiful?\"\n\n\"Sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest, but the most\ngraceful woman in France.\"\n\nThis reply reassured the vicomte. A woman who had been a reigning beauty\na year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for\nhim. He retired to his toilet. When he reappeared, Athos received him\nwith the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on\nD'Artagnan, but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly\nimpressed upon his face.\n\nAthos cast a glance at his feet, hands and hair--those three marks of\nrace. The youth's dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls, forming\na sort of dark frame around his face; such was the fashion of the day.\nGloves of gray kid, matching the hat, well displayed the form of a\nslender and elegant hand; whilst his boots, similar in color to the hat\nand gloves, confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old.\n\n\"Come,\" murmured Athos, \"if she is not proud of him, she must be hard to\nplease.\"\n\nIt was three o'clock in the afternoon. The two travelers proceeded to\nthe Rue Saint Dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel,\nsurmounted with the arms of De Luynes.\n\n\"'Tis here,\" said Athos.\n\nHe entered the hotel and ascended the front steps, and addressing a\nfootman who waited there in a grand livery, asked if the Duchess de\nChevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere?\n\nThe servant returned with a message to say, that, though the duchess had\nnot the honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere, she would receive him.\n\nAthos followed the footman, who led him through a long succession of\napartments and paused at length before a closed door. Athos made a sign\nto the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was.\n\nThe footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.\n\nMadame de Chevreuse, whose name appears so often in our story \"The Three\nMusketeers,\" without her actually having appeared in any scene, was\nstill a beautiful woman. Although about forty-four or forty-five years\nold, she might have passed for thirty-five. She still had her rich\nfair hair; her large, animated, intelligent eyes, so often opened by\nintrigue, so often closed by the blindness of love. She had still her\nnymph-like form, so that when her back was turned she still was not\nunlike the girl who had jumped, with Anne of Austria, over the moat\nof the Tuileries in 1563. In all other respects she was the same mad\ncreature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make\nthem proverbial for eccentricity in her family.\n\nShe was in a little boudoir, hung with blue damask, adorned by red\nflowers, with a foliage of gold, looking upon a garden; and reclined\nupon a sofa, her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it.\nShe held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion.\n\nAt the footman's announcement she raised herself a little and peeped\nout, with some curiosity.\n\nAthos appeared.\n\nHe was dressed in violet-tinted velvet, trimmed with silk of the same\ncolor. His shoulder-knots were of burnished silver, his mantle had no\ngold nor embroidery on it; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his\nhat; his boots were of black leather, and at his girdle hung that sword\nwith a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue\nFeron. Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt, and lace\nfell also over the top of his boots.\n\nIn his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree, that Madame\nde Chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a\nsign to sit down near her.\n\nAthos bowed and obeyed. The footman was withdrawing, but Athos stopped\nhim by a sign.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said to the duchess, \"I have had the boldness to present\nmyself at your hotel without being known to you; it has succeeded,\nsince you deign to receive me. I have now the boldness to ask you for an\ninterview of half an hour.\"\n\n\"I grant it, monsieur,\" replied Madame de Chevreuse with her most\ngracious smile.\n\n\"But that is not all, madame. Oh, I am very presuming, I am aware. The\ninterview for which I ask is of us two alone, and I very earnestly wish\nthat it may not be interrupted.\"\n\n\"I am not at home to any one,\" said the Duchess de Chevreuse to the\nfootman. \"You may go.\"\n\nThe footman went out\n\nThere ensued a brief silence, during which these two persons, who at\nfirst sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race, examined\neach other without embarrassment on either side.\n\nThe duchess was the first to speak.\n\n\"Well, sir, I am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to\nme.\"\n\n\"And I, madame,\" replied Athos, \"am looking with admiration.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Madame de Chevreuse, \"you must excuse me, but I long to know\nto whom I am talking. You belong to the court, doubtless, yet I have\nnever seen you at court. Have you, by any chance, been in the Bastile?\"\n\n\"No, madame, I have not; but very likely I am on the road to it.\"\n\n\"Ah! then tell me who you are, and get along with you upon your\njourney,\" replied the duchess, with the gayety which made her\nso charming, \"for I am sufficiently in bad odor already, without\ncompromising myself still more.\"\n\n\"Who I am, madame? My name has been mentioned to you--the Comte de la\nFere; you do not know that name. I once bore another, which you knew,\nbut you have certainly forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Tell it me, sir.\"\n\n\"Formerly,\" said the count, \"I was Athos.\"\n\nMadame de Chevreuse looked astonished. The name was not wholly\nforgotten, but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections.\n\n\"Athos?\" said she; \"wait a moment.\"\n\nAnd she placed her hands on her brow, as if to force the fugitive ideas\nit contained to concentration in a moment.\n\n\"Shall I help you, madame?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"This Athos was connected with three young musketeers, named Porthos,\nD'Artagnan, and----\"\n\nHe stopped short.\n\n\"And Aramis,\" said the duchess, quickly.\n\n\"And Aramis; I see you have not forgotten the name.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"poor Aramis; a charming man, elegant, discreet, and\na writer of poetical verses. I am afraid he has turned out ill,\" she\nadded.\n\n\"He has; he is an abbe.\"\n\n\"Ah, what a misfortune!\" exclaimed the duchess, playing carelessly with\nher fan. \"Indeed, sir, I thank you; you have recalled one of the most\nagreeable recollections of my youth.\"\n\n\"Will you permit me, then, to recall another to you?\"\n\n\"Relating to him?\"\n\n\"Yes and no.\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said Madame de Chevreuse, \"say on. With a man like you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\nAthos bowed. \"Aramis,\" he continued, \"was intimate with a young\nneedlewoman from Tours, a cousin of his, named Marie Michon.\"\n\n\"Ah, I knew her!\" cried the duchess. \"It was to her he wrote from\nthe siege of Rochelle, to warn her of a plot against the Duke of\nBuckingham.\"\n\n\"Exactly so; will you allow me to speak to you of her?\"\n\n\"If,\" replied the duchess, with a meaning look, \"you do not say too much\nagainst her.\"\n\n\"I should be ungrateful,\" said Athos, \"and I regard ingratitude, not as\na fault or a crime, but as a vice, which is much worse.\"\n\n\"You ungrateful to Marie Michon, monsieur?\" said Madame de Chevreuse,\ntrying to read in Athos's eyes. \"But how can that be? You never knew\nher.\"\n\n\"Eh, madame, who knows?\" said Athos. \"There is a popular proverb to the\neffect that it is only mountains that never meet; and popular proverbs\ncontain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on, monsieur, go on!\" said Madame de Chevreuse eagerly; \"you\ncan't imagine how much this conversation interests me.\"\n\n\"You encourage me,\" said Athos, \"I will continue, then. That cousin of\nAramis, that Marie Michon, that needlewoman, notwithstanding her\nlow condition, had acquaintances in the highest rank; she called the\ngrandest ladies of the court her friend, and the queen--proud as she\nis, in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniard--called her her\nsister.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Madame de Chevreuse, with a slight sigh and a little\nmovement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own, \"since that time\neverything has changed.\"\n\n\"And the queen had reason for her affection, for Marie was devoted to\nher--devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse\nwith her brother, the king of Spain.\"\n\n\"Which,\" interrupted the duchess, \"is now brought up against her as a\ngreat crime.\"\n\n\"And therefore,\" continued Athos, \"the cardinal--the true cardinal, the\nother one--determined one fine morning to arrest poor Marie Michon\nand send her to the Chateau de Loches. Fortunately the affair was not\nmanaged so secretly but that it became known to the queen. The case had\nbeen provided for: if Marie Michon should be threatened with any danger\nthe queen was to send her a prayer-book bound in green velvet.\"\n\n\"That is true, monsieur, you are well informed.\"\n\n\"One morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de\nMarsillac. There was no time to lose. Happily Marie and a follower of\nhers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men's clothes.\nThe prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for\nKitty that of a lackey; he sent them two excellent horses, and the\nfugitives went out hastily from Tours, shaping their course toward\nSpain, trembling at the least noise, following unfrequented roads, and\nasking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no\ninn.\"\n\n\"Why, really, it was all exactly as you say!\" cried Madame de Chevreuse,\nclapping her hands. \"It would indeed be strange if----\" she checked\nherself.\n\n\"If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey?\" said\nAthos. \"No, madame, I will not thus waste your time. We will accompany\nthem only to a little village in Limousin, lying between Tulle and\nAngouleme--a little village called Roche-l'Abeille.\"\n\nMadame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise, and looked at Athos with\nan expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile.\n\n\"Wait, madame,\" continued Athos, \"what remains for me to tell you is\neven more strange than what I have narrated.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Madame de Chevreuse, \"I believe you are a sorcerer; I\nam prepared for anything. But really--No matter, go on.\"\n\n\"The journey of that day had been long and wearing; it was a cold day,\nthe eleventh of October, there was no inn or chateau in the village and\nthe homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive. Marie Michon was\na very aristocratic person; like her sister the queen, she had been\naccustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen; she resolved, therefore,\nto seek hospitality of the priest.\"\n\nAthos paused.\n\n\"Oh, continue!\" said the duchess. \"I have told you that I am prepared\nfor anything.\"\n\n\"The two travelers knocked at the door. It was late; the priest, who had\ngone to bed, cried out to them to come in. They entered, for the door\nwas not locked--there is much confidence among villagers. A lamp burned\nin the chamber occupied by the priest. Marie Michon, who made the most\ncharming cavalier in the world, pushed open the door, put her head in\nand asked for hospitality. 'Willingly, my young cavalier,' said the\npriest, 'if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with\nhalf my chamber.'\n\n\"The two travelers consulted for a moment. The priest heard a burst of\nlaughter and then the master, or rather, the mistress, replied: 'Thank\nyou, monsieur le cure, I accept.' 'Sup, then, and make as little noise\nas possible,' said the priest, 'for I, too, have been on the go all day\nand shall not be sorry to sleep to-night.'\"\n\nMadame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment, and\nfrom astonishment to stupefaction. Her face, as she looked at Athos, had\ntaken on an expression that cannot be described. It could be seen that\nshe had wished to speak, but she had remained silent through fear of\nlosing one of her companion's words.\n\n\"What happened then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Then?\" said Athos. \"Ah, I have come now to what is most difficult.\"\n\n\"Speak, speak! One can say anything to me. Besides, it doesn't concern\nme; it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true,\" said Athos. \"Well, then, Marie Michon had supper\nwith her follower, and then, in accordance with the permission given\nher, she entered the chamber of her host, Kitty meanwhile taking\npossession of an armchair in the room first entered, where they had\ntaken their supper.\"\n\n\"Really, monsieur,\" said Madame de Chevreuse, \"unless you are the devil\nin person I don't know how you could become acquainted with all these\ndetails.\"\n\n\"A charming woman was that Marie Michon,\" resumed Athos, \"one of those\nwild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas. Now,\nthinking that her host was a priest, that coquette took it into her head\nthat it would be a happy souvenir for her old age, among the many happy\nsouvenirs she already possessed, if she could win that of having damned\nan abbe.\"\n\n\"Count,\" said the duchess, \"upon my word, you frighten me.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" continued Athos, \"the poor abbe was not a St. Ambroise, and I\nrepeat, Marie Michon was an adorable creature.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\" cried the duchess, seizing Athos's hands, \"tell me this\nmoment how you know all these details, or I will send to the convent of\nthe Vieux Augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you.\"\n\nAthos laughed. \"Nothing is easier, madame. A cavalier, charged with\nan important mission, had come an hour before your arrival, seeking\nhospitality, at the very moment that the cure, summoned to the bedside\nof a dying person, left not only his house but the village, for the\nentire night. The priest having all confidence in his guest, who,\nbesides, was a nobleman, had left to him his house, his supper and his\nchamber. And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of\nthe good abbe and not from the good abbe himself.\"\n\n\"And that cavalier, that guest, that nobleman who arrived before she\ncame?\"\n\n\"It was I, the Comte de la Fere,\" said Athos, rising and bowing\nrespectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse.\n\nThe duchess remained a moment stupefied; then, suddenly bursting into\nlaughter:\n\n\"Ah! upon my word,\" said she, \"it is very droll, and that mad Marie\nMichon fared better than she expected. Sit down, dear count, and go on\nwith your story.\"\n\n\"At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault, madame. I have told\nyou that I was traveling on an important mission. At daybreak I left\nthe chamber without noise, leaving my charming companion asleep. In the\nfront room the follower was also still asleep, her head leaning back\non the chair, in all respects worthy of her mistress. Her pretty face\narrested my attention; I approached and recognized that little Kitty\nwhom our friend Aramis had placed with her. In that way I discovered\nthat the charming traveler was----\"\n\n\"Marie Michon!\" said Madame de Chevreuse, hastily.\n\n\"Marie Michon,\" continued Athos. \"Then I went out of the house; I\nproceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready.\nWe set forth on our journey.\"\n\n\"And have you never revisited that village?\" eagerly asked Madame de\nChevreuse.\n\n\"A year after, madame.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see the good cure again. I found him much preoccupied\nwith an event that he could not at all comprehend. A week before he had\nreceived, in a cradle, a beautiful little boy three months old, with\na purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words:\n'11 October, 1633.'\"\n\n\"It was the date of that strange adventure,\" interrupted Madame de\nChevreuse.\n\n\"Yes, but he couldn't understand what it meant, for he had spent that\nnight with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his\nreturn.\"\n\n\"You must know, monsieur, that Marie Michon, when she returned to France\nin 1643, immediately sought for information about that child; as a\nfugitive she could not take care of it, but on her return she wished to\nhave it near her.\"\n\n\"And what said the abbe?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it,\nhad answered for its future, and had taken it away.\"\n\n\"That was true.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see! That nobleman was you; it was his father!\"\n\n\"Hush! do not speak so loud, madame; he is there.\"\n\n\"He is there! my son! the son of Marie Michon! But I must see him\ninstantly.\"\n\n\"Take care, madame,\" said Athos, \"for he knows neither his father nor\nhis mother.\"\n\n\"You have kept the secret! you have brought him to see me, thinking\nto make me happy. Oh, thanks! sir, thanks!\" cried Madame de Chevreuse,\nseizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips; \"you have a noble\nheart.\"\n\n\"I bring him to you, madame,\" said Athos, withdrawing his hand, \"hoping\nthat in your turn you will do something for him; till now I have\nwatched over his education and I have made him, I hope, an accomplished\ngentleman; but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering\nlife of party faction. To-morrow I plunge into an adventurous affair\nin which I may be killed. Then it will devolve on you to push him on in\nthat world where he is called on to occupy a place.\"\n\n\"Rest assured,\" cried the duchess, \"I shall do what I can. I have but\nlittle influence now, but all that I have shall most assuredly be his.\nAs to his title and fortune----\"\n\n\"As to that, madame, I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne,\nmy inheritance, which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the\ntitle of vicomte.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul, monsieur,\" said the duchess, \"you are a true nobleman!\nBut I am eager to see our young vicomte. Where is he?\"\n\n\"There, in the salon. I will have him come in, if you really wish it.\"\n\nAthos moved toward the door; the duchess held him back.\n\n\"Is he handsome?\" she asked.\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"He resembles his mother.\"\n\nSo he opened the door and beckoned the young man in.\n\nThe duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a\nyoung cavalier, so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been\nable to conceive.\n\n\"Vicomte, come here,\" said Athos; \"the duchess permits you to kiss her\nhand.\"\n\nThe youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare, and\nkneeling down, kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, turning to Athos, \"was it not in compassion to my\ntimidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess de Chevreuse,\nand is she not the queen?\"\n\n\"No, vicomte,\" said Madame de Chevreuse, taking his hand and making him\nsit near her, while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure;\n\"no, unhappily, I am not the queen. If I were I should do for you at\nonce the most that you deserve. But let us see; whatever I may be,\" she\nadded, hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow, \"let us\nsee what profession you wish to follow.\"\n\nAthos, standing, looked at them both with indescribable pleasure.\n\n\"Madame,\" answered the youth in his sweet voice, \"it seems to me that\nthere is only one career for a gentleman--that of the army. I have been\nbrought up by monsieur le comte with the intention, I believe, of making\nme a soldier; and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would\npresent me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the\nprince.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand it well. Personally, I am on bad terms with him, on\naccount of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon, my mother-in-law,\nand Madame de Longueville. But the Prince de Marsillac! Yes, indeed,\nthat's the right thing. The Prince de Marsillac--my old friend--will\nrecommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville, who will give him a\nletter to her brother, the prince, who loves her too tenderly not to do\nwhat she wishes immediately.\"\n\n\"Well, that will do charmingly,\" said the count; \"but may I beg that the\ngreatest haste may be made, for I have reasons for wishing the vicomte\nnot to sleep longer than to-morrow night in Paris!\"\n\n\"Do you wish it known that you are interested about him, monsieur le\ncomte?\"\n\n\"Better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"You know, Bragelonne,\" said Athos, \"I never speak without reflection.\"\n\n\"Well, comte, I am going instantly,\" interrupted the duchess, \"to send\nfor the Prince de Marsillac, who is happily, in Paris just now. What are\nyou going to do this evening?\"\n\n\"We intend to visit the Abbe Scarron, for whom I have a letter of\nintroduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my friends.\"\n\n\"'Tis well; I will go there also, for a few minutes,\" said the duchess;\n\"do not quit his salon until you have seen me.\"\n\nAthos bowed and prepared to leave.\n\n\"Well, monsieur le comte,\" said the duchess, smiling, \"does one leave so\nsolemnly his old friends?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" murmured Athos, kissing her hand, \"had I only sooner known that\nMarie Michon was so charming a creature!\" And he withdrew, sighing.\n\n\n\n\n21. The Abbe Scarron.\n\n\n\nThere was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan\nchairmen and footmen of Paris, and yet, nevertheless, this house was\nneither that of a great lord nor of a rich man. There was neither\ndining, nor playing at cards, nor dancing in that house. Nevertheless,\nit was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went there. It\nwas the abode of the little Abbe Scarron.\n\nIn the home of the witty abbe dwelt incessant laughter; there all the\nitems of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed,\nmisrepresented, metamorphosed, some into epigrams, some into falsehoods,\nthat every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron,\nlistening to what he said, reporting it to others.\n\nThe diminutive Abbe Scarron, who, however, was an abbe only because he\nowned an abbey, and not because he was in orders, had formerly been one\nof the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans, which he inhabited. On\na day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual\nentertainment for that good town, of which he was the life and soul. He\nhad made his valet cover him with honey; then, opening a feather bed,\nhe had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is\npossible to imagine. He then began to visit his friends of both\nsexes, in that strange costume. At first he had been followed through\nastonishment, then with derisive shouts, then the porters had insulted\nhim, then children had thrown stones at him, and finally he was obliged\nto run, to escape the missiles. As soon as he took to flight every\none pursued him, until, pressed on all sides, Scarron found no way of\nescaping his escort, except by throwing himself into the river; but the\nwater was icy cold. Scarron was heated, the cold seized on him, and when\nhe reached the farther bank he found himself crippled.\n\nEvery means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs.\nHe had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine, at\nlength he sent away all his doctors, declaring that he preferred the\ndisease to the treatment, and came to Paris, where the fame of his wit\nhad preceded him. There he had a chair made on his own plan, and one\nday, visiting Anne of Austria in this chair, she asked him, charmed as\nshe was with his wit, if he did not wish for a title.\n\n\"Yes, your majesty, there is a title which I covet much,\" replied\nScarron.\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"That of being your invalid,\" answered Scarron.\n\nSo he was called the queen's invalid, with a pension of fifteen hundred\nfrancs.\n\nFrom that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life, spending both income\nand principal. One day, however, an emissary of the cardinal's gave him\nto understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often.\n\n\"And why?\" asked Scarron; \"is he not a man of good birth?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Agreeable?\"\n\n\"Undeniably.\"\n\n\"Witty?\"\n\n\"He has, unfortunately, too much wit.\"\n\n\"Well, then, why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man?\"\n\n\"Because he is an enemy.\"\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"Of the cardinal.\"\n\n\"What?\" answered Scarron, \"I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles\nDespreaux, who thinks ill of me, and you wish me to give up seeing the\ncoadjutor, because he thinks ill of another man. Impossible!\"\n\nThe conversation had rested there and Scarron, through sheer obstinacy,\nhad seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently.\n\nNow, the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter-day\npayment, and Scarron, as usual, had sent his servant to get his money\nat the pension-office, but the man had returned and said that the\ngovernment had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron.\n\nIt was on Thursday, the abbe's reception day; people went there in\ncrowds. The cardinal's refusal to pay the pension was known about the\ntown in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence.\n\nIn the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not\nknow, on horseback like himself, followed by a lackey like himself, and\ngoing in the same direction that he was. One of them, hat in hand, said\nto him:\n\n\"Would you believe it, monsieur? that contemptible Mazarin has stopped\npoor Scarron's pension.\"\n\n\"That is unreasonable,\" said Athos, saluting in his turn the two\ncavaliers. And they separated with courteous gestures.\n\n\"It happens well that we are going there this evening,\" said Athos to\nthe vicomte; \"we will pay our compliments to that poor man.\"\n\n\"What, then, is this Monsieur Scarron, who thus puts all Paris in\ncommotion? Is he some minister out of office?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not at all, vicomte,\" Athos replied; \"he is simply a gentleman\nof great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through\nhaving written certain verses against him.\"\n\n\"Do gentlemen, then, make verses?\" asked Raoul, naively, \"I thought it\nwas derogatory.\"\n\n\"So it is, my dear vicomte,\" said Athos, laughing, \"to make bad ones;\nbut to make good ones increases fame--witness Monsieur de Rotrou.\nNevertheless,\" he continued, in the tone of one who gives wholesome\nadvice, \"I think it is better not to make them.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Raoul, \"this Monsieur Scarron is a poet?\"\n\n\"Yes; you are warned, vicomte. Consider well what you do in that house.\nTalk only by gestures, or rather always listen.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Raoul.\n\n\"You will see me talking with one of my friends, the Abbe d'Herblay, of\nwhom you have often heard me speak.\"\n\n\"I remember him, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Come near to us from time to time, as if to speak; but do not\nspeak, and do not listen. That little stratagem may serve to keep off\ninterlopers.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur; I will obey you at all points.\"\n\nAthos made two visits in Paris; at seven o'clock he and Raoul directed\ntheir steps to the Rue des Tournelles; it was stopped by porters, horses\nand footmen. Athos forced his way through and entered, followed by the\nyoung man. The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis,\nplanted near a great chair on castors, very large, covered with a canopy\nof tapestry, under which there moved, enveloped in a quilt of brocade,\na little face, youngish, very merry, somewhat pallid, whilst its eyes\nnever ceased to express a sentiment at once lively, intellectual,\nand amiable. This was the Abbe Scarron, always laughing, joking,\ncomplimenting--yet suffering--and toying nervously with a small switch.\n\nAround this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and\nladies. The room was neatly, comfortably furnished. Large valances of\nsilk, embroidered with flowers of gay colors, which were rather faded,\nfell from the wide windows; the fittings of the room were simple, but in\nexcellent taste. Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the\ncompany. On perceiving Athos, Aramis advanced toward him, took him by\nthe hand and presented him to Scarron. Raoul remained silent, for he was\nnot prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit.\n\nAfter some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle\nPaulet.\n\nAthos touched the shoulder of the vicomte.\n\n\"Look at this lady, Raoul, she is an historic personage; it was to visit\nher King Henry IV. was going when he was assassinated.\"\n\nEvery one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet, for she was always very\nmuch the fashion. She was a tall woman, with a slender figure and a\nforest of golden curls, such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has\npainted all his Magdalens with. This fawn-colored hair, or, perhaps the\nsort of ascendancy which she had over other women, gave her the name of\n\"La Lionne.\" Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat, but before\nsitting down, she cast, in all her queen-like grandeur, a look around\nthe room, and her eyes rested on Raoul.\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you, vicomte; go and bow to her; don't\ntry to appear anything but what you are, a true country youth; on no\naccount speak to her of Henry IV.\"\n\n\"When shall we two walk together?\" Athos then said to Aramis.\n\n\"Presently--there are not a sufficient number of people here yet; we\nshall be remarked.\"\n\nAt this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor.\n\nAt this name every one looked around, for his was already a very\ncelebrated name. Athos did the same. He knew the Abbe de Gondy only by\nreport.\n\nHe saw a little dark man, ill made and awkward with his hands in\neverything--except drawing a sword and firing a pistol--with something\nhaughty and contemptuous in his face.\n\nScarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair.\n\n\"Well,\" said the coadjutor, on seeing him, \"you are in disgrace, then,\nabbe?\"\n\nThis was the orthodox phrase. It had been said that evening a hundred\ntimes--and Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject; he was\nvery nearly at the end of his humoristic tether, but one despairing\neffort saved him.\n\n\"Monsieur, the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"But how can you continue to receive us?\" asked the coadjutor; \"if\nyour income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre\nDame.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Scarron, \"I should compromise you too much.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant?\"\n\n\"I shall borrow from the queen.\"\n\n\"But her majesty has no property,\" interposed Aramis.\n\nAt this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced.\nEvery one arose. Scarron turned his chair toward the door, Raoul\nblushed, Athos made a sign to Aramis, who went and hid himself in the\nenclosure of a window.\n\nIn the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance,\nthe duchess seemed to be looking for some one; at last she found out\nRaoul and her eyes sparkled; she perceived Athos and became thoughtful;\nshe saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of\nsurprise behind her fan.\n\n\"Apropos,\" she said, as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in\nspite of herself, \"how is poor Voiture, do you know, Scarron?\"\n\n\"What, is Monsieur Voiture ill?\" inquired a gentleman who had spoken to\nAthos in the Rue Saint Honore; \"what is the matter with him?\"\n\n\"He was acting, but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of\nlinen ready after the performance,\" said the coadjutor, \"so he took cold\nand is about to die.\"\n\n\"Is he then so ill, dear Voiture?\" asked Aramis, half hidden by the\nwindow curtain.\n\n\"Die!\" cried Mademoiselle Paulet, bitterly, \"he! Why, he is surrounded\nby sultanas, like a Turk. Madame de Saintot has hastened to him with\nbroth; La Renaudot warms his sheets; the Marquise de Rambouillet sends\nhim his tisanes.\"\n\n\"You don't like him, my dear Parthenie,\" said Scarron.\n\n\"What an injustice, my dear invalid! I hate him so little that I should\nbe delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul.\"\n\n\"You are not called 'Lionne' for nothing,\" observed Madame de Chevreuse,\n\"your teeth are terrible.\"\n\n\"You are unjust to a great poet, it seems to me,\" Raoul ventured to say.\n\n\"A great poet! come, one may easily see, vicomte, that you are lately\nfrom the provinces and have never so much as seen him. A great poet! he\nis scarcely five feet high.\"\n\n\"Bravo bravo!\" cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long\nrapier, \"bravo, fair Paulet, it is high time to put little Voiture in\nhis right place. For my part, I always thought his poetry detestable,\nand I think I know something about poetry.\"\n\n\"Who is this officer,\" inquired Raoul of Athos, \"who is speaking?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Scudery, the author of 'Clelie,' and of 'Le Grand Cyrus,'\nwhich were composed partly by him and partly by his sister, who is now\ntalking to that pretty person yonder, near Monsieur Scarron.\"\n\nRaoul turned and saw two faces just arrived. One was perfectly charming,\ndelicate, pensive, shaded by beautiful dark hair, and eyes soft as\nvelvet, like those lovely flowers, the heartsease, in which shine out\nthe golden petals. The other, of mature age, seemed to have the former\none under her charge, and was cold, dry and yellow--the true type of a\nduenna or a devotee.\n\nRaoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the\nbeautiful girl with the soft eyes, who by a strange fancy, although she\nbore no resemblance, reminded him of his poor little Louise, whom he\nhad left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom, in the midst of all the\nparty, he had never for one moment quite forgotten. Meantime Aramis had\ndrawn near to the coadjutor, who, smiling all the while, contrived to\ndrop some words into his ear. Aramis, notwithstanding his self-control,\ncould not refrain from a slight movement of surprise.\n\n\"Laugh, then,\" said Monsieur de Retz; \"they are looking at us.\" And\nleaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse, who was in the\nmidst of a large group.\n\nAramis affected a laugh, to divert the attention of certain curious\nlisteners, and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the\nembrasure of a window and remained there, he proceeded to join him,\nthrowing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room.\n\nAs soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was\nemphasized by frequent gesticulation.\n\nRaoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do.\n\n\"'Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur l'abbe is repeating\nto me.\" said Athos in a loud voice, \"and I confess I think it\nincomparable.\"\n\nRaoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the\ngroup round Madame de Chevreuse.\n\n\"Well, then?\" asked Athos, in a low tone.\n\n\"It is to be to-morrow,\" said Aramis hastily.\n\n\"At what time?\"\n\n\"Six o'clock.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At Saint Mande.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"The Count de Rochefort.\"\n\nSome one drew near.\n\n\"And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voiture's works, but\nI am of the same opinion as the coadjutor--he is a poet, a true poet.\"\nAramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody.\n\n\"And I, too,\" murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes. \"I have the\nmisfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Scarron, do me the honor,\" said Raoul, blushing, \"to tell me\nthe name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that\nof others of the company.\"\n\n\"Ah! my young vicomte,\" replied Scarron, \"I suppose you wish to propose\nto her an alliance offensive and defensive.\"\n\nRaoul blushed again.\n\n\"You asked the name of that young lady. She is called the fair Indian.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" returned Raoul, blushing still more deeply, \"I know no\nmore than I did before. Alas! I am from the country.\"\n\n\"Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here\nflows down our streets. So much the better, young man! so much the\nbetter! Don't try to understand it--you will only lose your time.\"\n\n\"You forgive me, then, sir,\" said Raoul, \"and you will deign to tell me\nwho is the person that you call the young Indian?\"\n\n\"Certainly; one of the most charming persons that lives--Mademoiselle\nFrances d'Aubigne.\"\n\n\"Does she belong to the family of the celebrated Agrippa, the friend of\nHenry IV.?\"\n\n\"His granddaughter. She comes from Martinique, so I call her the\nbeautiful Indian.\"\n\nRaoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady, who\nsmiled.\n\nThe company went on speaking of the poet Voiture.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Mademoiselle d'Aubigne to Scarron, as if she wished\nto join in the conversation he was engaged in with Raoul, \"do you not\nadmire Monsieur Voiture's friends? Listen how they pull him to pieces\neven whilst they praise him; one takes away from him all claim to good\nsense, another robs him of his poetry, a third of his originality,\nanother of his humor, another of his independence of character, a\nsixth--but, good heavens! what will they leave him? as Mademoiselle de\nScudery remarks.\"\n\nScarron and Raoul laughed. The fair Indian, astonished at the sensation\nher observation produced, looked down and resumed her air of naivete.\n\nAthos, still within the inclosure of the window, watched this scene with\na smile of disdain on his lips.\n\n\"Tell the Comte de la Fere to come to me,\" said Madame de Chevreuse, \"I\nwant to speak to him.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the coadjutor, \"want it to be thought that I do not speak\nto him. I admire, I love him--for I know his former adventures--but I\nshall not speak to him until the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And why day after to-morrow?\" asked Madame de Chevreuse.\n\n\"You will know that to-morrow evening,\" said the coadjutor, smiling.\n\n\"Really, my dear Gondy,\" said the duchess, \"you remind one of the\nApocalypse. Monsieur d'Herblay,\" she added, turning toward Aramis, \"will\nyou be my servant once more this evening?\"\n\n\"How can you doubt it?\" replied Aramis; \"this evening, to-morrow,\nalways; command me.\"\n\n\"I will, then. Go and look for the Comte de la Fere; I wish to speak\nwith him.\"\n\nAramis found Athos and brought him.\n\n\"Monsieur le comte,\" said the duchess, giving him a letter, \"here is\nwhat I promised you; our young friend will be extremely well received.\"\n\n\"Madame, he is very happy in owing any obligation to you.\"\n\n\"You have no reason to envy him on that score, for I owe to you the\npleasure of knowing him,\" replied the witty woman, with a smile which\nrecalled Marie Michon to Aramis and to Athos.\n\nAs she uttered that bon mot, she arose and asked for her carriage.\nMademoiselle Paulet had already gone; Mademoiselle de Scudery was going.\n\n\"Vicomte,\" said Athos to Raoul, \"follow the duchess; beg her to do you\nthe favor to take your arm in going downstairs, and thank her as you\ndescend.\"\n\nThe fair Indian approached Scarron.\n\n\"You are going already?\" he said.\n\n\"One of the last, as you see; if you hear anything of Monsieur Voiture,\nbe so kind as to send me word to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Scarron, \"he may die now.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the young girl with the velvet eyes.\n\n\"Certainly; his panegyric has been uttered.\"\n\nThey parted, laughing, she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic\nman with interest, he looking after her with eyes of love.\n\nOne by one the several groups broke up. Scarron seemed not to observe\nthat certain of his guests had talked mysteriously, that letters had\npassed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a\nsecret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on\nwith so much ostentation. What was all that to Scarron? At his house\nrebellion could be planned with impunity, for, as we have said, since\nthat morning he had ceased to be \"the queen's invalid.\"\n\nAs to Raoul, he had attended the duchess to her carriage, where, as she\ntook her seat, she gave him her hand to kiss; then, by one of those wild\ncaprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous,\nshe had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead,\nsaying:\n\n\"Vicomte, may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune!\"\n\nThen she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the\nHotel de Luynes. The carriage had started, Madame de Chevreuse had made\na parting gesture to the young man, and Raoul had returned in a state of\nstupefaction.\n\nAthos surmised what had taken place and smiled. \"Come, vicomte,\" he\nsaid, \"it is time for you to go to bed; you will start in the morning\nfor the army of monsieur le prince. Sleep well your last night as\ncitizen.\"\n\n\"I am to be a soldier then?\" said the young man. \"Oh, monsieur, I thank\nyou with all my heart.\"\n\n\"Adieu, count,\" said the Abbe d'Herblay; \"I return to my convent.\"\n\n\"Adieu, abbe,\" said the coadjutor, \"I am to preach to-morrow and have\ntwenty texts to examine this evening.\"\n\n\"Adieu, gentlemen,\" said the count; \"I am going to sleep twenty-four\nhours; I am just falling down with fatigue.\"\n\nThe three men saluted one another, whilst exchanging a last look.\n\nScarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his\neye.\n\n\"Not one of them will do as he says,\" he murmured, with his little\nmonkey smile; \"but they may do as they please, the brave gentlemen! Who\nknows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension? They can move\ntheir arms, they can, and that is much. Alas, I have only my tongue, but\nI will try to show that it is good for something. Ho, there, Champenois!\nhere, it is eleven o'clock. Come and roll me to bed. Really, that\nDemoiselle d'Aubigne is very charming!\"\n\nSo the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his\nsleeping-room; and one by one the lights in the salon of the Rue des\nTournelles were extinguished.\n\n\n\n\n22. Saint Denis.\n\n\n\nThe day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself. It was\nplain, by a paleness still greater than usual, and by those traces which\nloss of sleep leaves on the face, that he must have passed almost the\nwhole of the night without sleeping. Contrary to the custom of a man\nso firm and decided, there was this morning in his personal appearance\nsomething tardy and irresolute.\n\nHe was occupied with the preparations for Raoul's departure and was\nseeking to gain time. In the first place he himself furbished a sword,\nwhich he drew from its perfumed leather sheath; he examined it to see\nif its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the\nhilt. Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young\nman a small bag of louis, called Olivain, the lackey who had followed\nhim from Blois, and made him pack the valise under his own eyes,\nwatchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful\nto a young man entering on his first campaign.\n\nAt length, after occupying about an hour in these preparations, he\nopened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept, and entered.\n\nThe sun, already high, penetrated into the room through the window, the\ncurtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening.\nHe was still sleeping, his head gracefully reposing on his arm.\n\nAthos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender\nmelancholy; he looked long on this young man, whose smiling mouth and\nhalf closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber, as if his\nguardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection. By\ndegrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the\nproximity of youth, so pure, so fresh. His own youth seemed to reappear,\nbringing with it all those savoury remembrances, which are like perfumes\nmore than thoughts. Between the past and the present was an ineffable\nabyss. But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels\nsafely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked,\nthe darkness in which our illusions are lost, the precipice whence our\nhappiness has been hurled and swallowed up. He remembered that all the\nfirst part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought\nwith alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine, and at the\nsame time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul.\n\nIn recalling all he had been through, he foresaw all that Raoul might\nsuffer; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which\nthrobbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed\non the young man.\n\nAt this moment Raoul awoke, without a cloud on his face without\nweariness or lassitude; his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and\nperhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was\nawaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress,\nfor his glance, in return, had all the tenderness of love.\n\n\"You are there, sir?\" he said, respectfully.\n\n\"Yes, Raoul,\" replied the count.\n\n\"And you did not awaken me?\"\n\n\"I wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep, my child;\nyou must be fatigued from yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, how good you are!\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"How do you feel this morning?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Perfectly well; quite rested, sir.\"\n\n\"You are still growing,\" Athos continued, with that charming and\npaternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth.\n\n\"Oh, sir, I beg your pardon!\" exclaimed Raoul, ashamed of so much\nattention; \"in an instant I shall be dressed.\"\n\nAthos then called Olivain.\n\n\"Everything,\" said Olivain to Athos, \"has been done according to your\ndirections; the horses are waiting.\"\n\n\"And I was asleep,\" cried Raoul, \"whilst you, sir, you had the kindness\nto attend to all these details. Truly, sir, you overwhelm me with\nbenefits!\"\n\n\"Therefore you love me a little, I hope,\" replied Athos, in a tone of\nemotion.\n\n\"Oh, sir! God knows how much I love, revere you.\"\n\n\"See that you forget nothing,\" said Athos, appearing to look about him,\nthat he might hide his emotion.\n\n\"No, indeed, sir,\" answered Raoul.\n\nThe servant then approached Athos and said, hesitatingly:\n\n\"Monsieur le vicomte has no sword.\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" said Athos, \"I will take care of that.\"\n\nThey went downstairs, Raoul looking every now and then at the count to\nsee if the moment of farewell was at hand, but Athos was silent. When\nthey reached the steps Raoul saw three horses.\n\n\"Oh, sir! then you are going with me?\"\n\n\"I will accompany you a portion of the way,\" said Athos.\n\nJoy shone in Raoul's eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle.\n\nAthos mounted more slowly, after speaking in a low voice to the lackey,\nwho, instead of following them immediately, returned to their rooms.\nRaoul, delighted at the count's companionship, perceived, or affected to\nperceive nothing of this byplay.\n\nThey set out, passing over the Pont Neuf; they pursued their way along\nthe quay then called L'Abreuvoir Pepin, and went along by the walls of\nthe Grand Chatelet. They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis.\n\nAfter passing through the Porte Saint Denis, Athos looked at Raoul's way\nof riding and observed:\n\n\"Take care, Raoul! I have already often told you of this; you must not\nforget it, for it is a great defect in a rider. See! your horse is tired\nalready, he froths at the mouth, whilst mine looks as if he had only\njust left the stable. You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth\nhard, so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly. The\nsafety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse.\nIn a week, remember, you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres\nfor practice, but on a field of battle.\"\n\nThen suddenly, in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to\nthis observation:\n\n\"See, Raoul!\" he resumed; \"what a fine plain for partridge shooting.\"\n\nThe young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the\ndelicate tenderness with which it was bestowed.\n\n\"I have remarked also another thing,\" said Athos, \"which is, that in\nfiring off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched. This\ntension lessens the accuracy of the aim. So in twelve times you thrice\nmissed the mark.\"\n\n\"Which you, sir, struck twelve times,\" answered Raoul, smiling.\n\n\"Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow--so; do you\nunderstand what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I have fired since in that manner and have been quite\nsuccessful.\"\n\n\"What a cold wind!\" resumed Athos; \"a wintry blast. Apropos, if you\nfire--and you will do so, for you are recommended to a young general\nwho is very fond of powder--remember that in single combat, which often\ntakes place in the cavalry, never to fire the first shot. He who fires\nthe first shot rarely hits his man, for he fires with the apprehension\nof being disarmed, before an armed foe; then, whilst he fires, make your\nhorse rear; that manoeuvre has saved my life several times.\"\n\n\"I shall do so, if only in gratitude----\"\n\n\"Eh!\" cried Athos, \"are not those fellows poachers they have arrested\nyonder? They are. Then another important thing, Raoul: should you be\nwounded in a battle, and fall from your horse, if you have any strength\nleft, disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed;\notherwise, it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by\nthe horses. At all events, should you be wounded, write to me that\nvery instant, or get some one at once to write to me. We are judges of\nwounds, we old soldiers,\" Athos added, smiling.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" answered the young man, much moved.\n\nThey arrived that very moment at the gate of the town, guarded by two\nsentinels.\n\n\"Here comes a young gentleman,\" said one of them, \"who seems as if he\nwere going to join the army.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\" inquired Athos.\n\n\"By his manner, sir, and his age; he's the second to-day.\"\n\n\"Has a young man, such as I am, gone through this morning, then?\" asked\nRaoul.\n\n\"Faith, yes, with a haughty presence, a fine equipage; such as the son\nof a noble house would have.\"\n\n\"He will be my companion on the journey, sir,\" cried Raoul. \"Alas! he\ncannot make me forget what I shall have lost!\"\n\nThus talking, they traversed the streets, full of people on account of\nthe fete, and arrived opposite the old cathedral, where first mass was\ngoing on.\n\n\"Let us alight; Raoul,\" said Athos. \"Olivain, take care of our horses\nand give me my sword.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen then went into the church. Athos gave Raoul some of\nthe holy water. A love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress\ndwells, undoubtedly, in some paternal hearts toward a son.\n\nAthos said a word to one of the vergers, who bowed and proceeded toward\nthe basement.\n\n\"Come, Raoul,\" he said, \"let us follow this man.\"\n\nThe verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and\nstood on the topmost step, whilst Athos and Raoul descended. The\nsepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on\nthe lowest step; and just below this lamp there was laid, wrapped in a\nflowing mantle of violet velvet, worked with fleurs-de-lis of gold, a\ncatafalque resting on trestles of oak. The young man, prepared for this\nscene by the state of his own feelings, which were mournful, and by the\nmajesty of the cathedral which he had passed through, descended in a\nslow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal\nspoils of the last king, who was not to be placed by the side of his\nforefathers until his successor should take his place there; and who\nappeared to abide on that spot, that he might thus address human pride,\nso sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne: \"Dust of the earth!\nHere I await thee!\"\n\nThere was profound silence.\n\nThen Athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin:\n\n\"This temporary sepulture is,\" he said, \"that of a man who was of feeble\nmind, yet one whose reign was full of great events; because over this\nking watched the spirit of another man, even as this lamp keeps vigil\nover this coffin and illumines it. He whose intellect was thus supreme,\nRaoul, was the actual sovereign; the other, nothing but a phantom to\nwhom he lent a soul; and yet, so powerful is majesty amongst us, this\nman has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service\nhis life was worn away. Remember, Raoul, this! If Richelieu made the\nking, by comparison, seem small, he made royalty great. The Palace of\nthe Louvre contains two things--the king, who must die, and royalty,\nwhich never dies. The minister, so feared, so hated by his master, has\ndescended into the tomb, drawing after him the king, whom he would not\nleave alone on earth, lest his work should be destroyed. So blind\nwere his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal's death as a\ndeliverance; and I, even I, opposed the designs of the great man who\nheld the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand. Raoul, learn\nhow to distinguish the king from royalty; the king is but a man; royalty\nis the gift of God. Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to\nserve, abandon the exterior, the material appearance for the invisible\nprinciple, for the invisible principle is everything. Raoul, I seem\nto read your future destiny as through a cloud. It will be happier, I\nthink, than ours has been. Different in your fate from us, you will have\na king without a minister, whom you may serve, love, respect. Should\nthe king prove a tyrant, for power begets tyranny, serve, love, respect\nroyalty, that Divine right, that celestial spark which makes this dust\nstill powerful and holy, so that we--gentlemen, nevertheless, of rank\nand condition--are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there\nextended.\"\n\n\"I shall adore God, sir,\" said Raoul, \"respect royalty and ever serve\nthe king. And if death be my lot, I hope to die for the king, for\nroyalty and for God. Have I, sir, comprehended your instructions?\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"Yours is a noble nature.\" he said; \"here is your sword.\"\n\nRaoul bent his knee to the ground.\n\n\"It was worn by my father, a loyal gentleman. I have worn it in my turn\nand it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and\nthe sheath at my side. Should your hand still be too weak to use this\nsword, Raoul, so much the better. You will have the more time to learn\nto draw it only when it ought to be used.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Raoul, putting the sword to his lips as he received it\nfrom the count, \"I owe you everything and yet this sword is the most\nprecious gift you have yet made me. I will wear it, I swear to you, as a\ngrateful man should do.\"\n\n\"'Tis well; arise, vicomte, embrace me.\"\n\nRaoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count's arms.\n\n\"Adieu,\" faltered the count, who felt his heart die away within him;\n\"adieu, and think of me.\"\n\n\"Oh! for ever and ever!\" cried the youth; \"oh! I swear to you, sir,\nshould any harm befall me, your name will be the last name that I shall\nutter, the remembrance of you my last thought.\"\n\nAthos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion, and regained with\nhurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses.\n\n\"Olivain,\" said Athos, showing the servant Raoul's shoulder-belt,\n\"tighten the buckle of the sword, it falls too low. You will accompany\nmonsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you. You know, Raoul, Grimaud\nis an old and zealous servant; he will follow you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Raoul.\n\n\"Now to horse, that I may see you depart!\"\n\nRaoul obeyed.\n\n\"Adieu, Raoul,\" said the count; \"adieu, my dearest boy!\"\n\n\"Adieu, sir, adieu, my beloved protector.\"\n\nAthos waved his hand--he dared not trust himself to speak: and Raoul\nwent away, his head uncovered. Athos remained motionless, looking after\nhim until he turned the corner of the street.\n\nThen the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a\npeasant, remounted the steps, went into the cathedral, there to kneel\ndown in the darkest corner and pray.\n\n\n\n\n23. One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner, as well as for those who\nwere preparing his escape; only for him it passed more slowly. Unlike\nother men, who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow\ncold as the moment of execution approaches, the Duc de Beaufort, whose\nbuoyant courage had become a proverb, seemed to push time before him and\nsought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action. In his escape alone,\napart from his plans for the future, which, it must be admitted, were\nfor the present sufficiently vague and uncertain, there was a beginning\nof vengeance which filled his heart. In the first place his escape would\nbe a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny, whom he hated for the\npetty persecutions he owed to him. It would be a still worse affair for\nMazarin, whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed.\nIt may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments\ntoward the governor of the prison and the minister--toward the\nsubordinate and the master.\n\nThen Monsieur de Beaufort, who was so familiar with the interior of the\nPalais Royal, though he did not know the relations existing between the\nqueen and the cardinal, pictured to himself, in his prison, all that\ndramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from\nthe minister's cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria: \"Monsieur\nde Beaufort has escaped!\" Whilst saying that to himself, Monsieur\nde Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside,\nbreathing the air of the plains and the forests, pressing a strong horse\nbetween his knees and crying out in a loud voice, \"I am free!\"\n\nIt is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within\nfour walls; he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him, and\nhis guards laughing and drinking in the ante-chamber. The only thing\nthat was pleasant to him in that odious tableau--such is the instability\nof the human mind--was the sullen face of Grimaud, for whom he had at\nfirst conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope.\nGrimaud seemed to him an Antinous. It is needless to say that this\ntransformation was visible only to the prisoner's feverish imagination.\nGrimaud was still the same, and therefore he retained the entire\nconfidence of his superior, La Ramee, who now relied upon him more than\nhe did upon himself, for, as we have said, La Ramee felt at the bottom\nof his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort.\n\nAnd so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with\nhis prisoner. He had but one fault--he was a gourmand; he had found the\npates good, the wine excellent. Now the successor of Pere Marteau\nhad promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl, and\nChambertin wine instead of Macon. All this, set off by the presence of\nthat excellent prince, who was so good-natured, who invented so droll\ntricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin,\nmade for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts\nof the year. He therefore looked forward to six o'clock with as much\nimpatience as the duke himself.\n\nSince daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations, and\ntrusting no one but himself, he had visited personally the successor\nof Pere Marteau. The latter had surpassed himself; he showed La Ramee a\nmonstrous pate, ornamented with Monsieur de Beaufort's coat-of-arms. It\nwas empty as yet, but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it.\nLa Ramee's mouth watered and he returned to the duke's chamber rubbing\nhis hands. To crown his happiness, Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a\njourney that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputy-governor of\nthe chateau.\n\nAs for Grimaud, he seemed more sullen than ever.\n\nIn the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis\nwith La Ramee; a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert. Grimaud, going\nin advance, followed the course which they were to take in the evening.\nThe game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the\nchateau, a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was\nplaying; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous, the wall was\nso high.\n\nThere were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure, each by a\ndifferent key. When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by\na loophole in the wall, letting his legs dangle outside. It was evident\nthat there the rope ladder was to be attached.\n\nThis manoeuvre, transparent to the Duc de Beaufort, was quite\nunintelligible to La Ramee.\n\nThe game at tennis, which, upon a sign from Grimaud, Monsieur de\nBeaufort had consented to play, began in the afternoon. The duke was in\nfull strength and beat La Ramee completely.\n\nFour of the guards, who were constantly near the prisoner, assisted in\npicking up the tennis balls. When the game was over, the duke, laughing\nat La Ramee for his bad play, offered these men two louis d'or to go and\ndrink his health, with their four other comrades.\n\nThe guards asked permission of La Ramee, who gave it to them, but not\ntill the evening, however; until then he had business and the prisoner\nwas not to be left alone.\n\nSix o'clock came and, although they were not to sit down to table until\nseven o'clock, dinner was ready and served up. Upon a sideboard appeared\nthe colossal pie with the duke's arms on it, and seemingly cooked to a\nturn, as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated\nthe crust.\n\nThe rest of the dinner was to come.\n\nEvery one was impatient, La Ramee to sit down to table, the guards to go\nand drink, the duke to escape.\n\nGrimaud alone was calm as ever. One might have fancied that Athos had\neducated him with the express forethought of such a great event.\n\nThere were moments when, looking at Grimaud, the duke asked himself if\nhe was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service\nand would grow animated when the moment came for action.\n\nLa Ramee sent away the guards, desiring them to drink to the duke's\nhealth, and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors, put the\nkeys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that\nsignified:\n\n\"Whenever my lord pleases.\"\n\nThe prince looked at Grimaud, Grimaud looked at the clock; it was hardly\na quarter-past six. The escape was fixed to take place at seven o'clock;\nthere was therefore three-quarters of an hour to wait.\n\nThe duke, in order to pass away another quarter of an hour, pretended\nto be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished\nthey would allow him to finish his chapter. La Ramee went up to him and\nlooked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so\nsingular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking\nhis dinner.\n\nIt was \"Caesar's Commentaries,\" which La Ramee had lent him, contrary to\nthe orders of the governor; and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey\nthese injunctions.\n\nMeantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good.\n\nAt half-past six the duke arose and said very gravely:\n\n\"Certainly, Caesar was the greatest man of ancient times.\"\n\n\"You think so, my lord?\" answered La Ramee.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, as for me, I prefer Hannibal.\"\n\n\"And why, pray, Master La Ramee?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"Because he left no Commentaries,\" replied La Ramee, with his coarse\nlaugh.\n\nThe duke vouchsafed no reply, but sitting down at the table made a\nsign that La Ramee should seat himself opposite. There is nothing so\nexpressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well\nspread table, so La Ramee, when receiving his plate of soup from\nGrimaud, presented a type of perfect bliss.\n\nThe duke smiled.\n\n\"Zounds!\" he said; \"I don't suppose there is a more contented man at\nthis moment in all the kingdom than yourself!\"\n\n\"You are right, my lord duke,\" answered the officer; \"I don't know any\npleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table; and when, added to\nthat, he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV., you will, my\nlord duke, easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure\none enjoys.\"\n\nThe duke, in his turn, bowed, and an imperceptible smile appeared on the\nface of Grimaud, who kept behind La Ramee.\n\n\"My dear La Ramee,\" said the duke, \"you are the only man to turn such\nfaultless compliments.\"\n\n\"No, my lord duke,\" replied La Ramee, in the fullness of his heart; \"I\nsay what I think; there is no compliment in what I say to you----\"\n\n\"Then you are attached to me?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"To own the truth, I should be inconsolable if you were to leave\nVincennes.\"\n\n\"A droll way of showing your affliction.\" The duke meant to say\n\"affection.\"\n\n\"But, my lord,\" returned La Ramee, \"what would you do if you got out?\nEvery folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they\nwould put you into the Bastile, instead of Vincennes. Now, Monsieur\nde Chavigny is not amiable, I allow, but Monsieur du Tremblay is\nconsiderably worse.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the duke, who from time to time looked at the clock,\nthe fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness.\n\n\"But what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk, brought\nup in the school of Cardinal Richelieu? Ah, my lord, it is a great\nhappiness that the queen, who always wished you well, had a fancy to\nsend you here, where there's a promenade and a tennis court, good air,\nand a good table.\"\n\n\"In short,\" answered the duke, \"if I comprehend you aright, La Ramee, I\nam ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place?\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord duke, 'tis the height of ingratitude; but your highness has\nnever seriously thought of it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned the duke, \"I must confess I sometimes think of it.\"\n\n\"Still by one of your forty methods, your highness?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said La Ramee, \"now we are quite at our ease and enjoying\nourselves, pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your\nhighness.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered the duke, \"give me the pie!\"\n\n\"I am listening,\" said La Ramee, leaning back in his armchair and\nraising his glass of Madeira to his lips, and winking his eye that he\nmight see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste.\n\nThe duke glanced at the clock. In ten minutes it would strike seven.\n\nGrimaud placed the pie before the duke, who took a knife with a silver\nblade to raise the upper crust; but La Ramee, who was afraid of any harm\nhappening to this fine work of art, passed his knife, which had an iron\nblade, to the duke.\n\n\"Thank you, La Ramee,\" said the prisoner.\n\n\"Well, my lord! this famous invention of yours?\"\n\n\"Must I tell you,\" replied the duke, \"on what I most reckon and what I\ndetermine to try first?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the thing, my lord!\" cried his custodian, gaily.\n\n\"Well, I should hope, in the first instance, to have for keeper an\nhonest fellow like you.\"\n\n\"And you have me, my lord. Well?\"\n\n\"Having, then, a keeper like La Ramee, I should try also to have\nintroduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to\nme, who would assist me in my flight.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said La Ramee, \"that's not a bad idea.\"\n\n\"Capital, isn't it? for instance, the former servingman of some brave\ngentleman, an enemy himself to Mazarin, as every gentleman ought to be.\"\n\n\"Hush! don't let us talk politics, my lord.\"\n\n\"Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him,\nand I should have news from those without the prison walls.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! but how can the news be brought to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier; in a game of tennis, for example.\"\n\n\"In a game of tennis?\" asked La Ramee, giving more serious attention to\nthe duke's words.\n\n\"Yes; see, I send a ball into the moat; a man is there who picks it up;\nthe ball contains a letter. Instead of returning the ball to me when I\ncall for it from the top of the wall, he throws me another; that other\nball contains a letter. Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen\nus do it.\"\n\n\"The devil it does! The devil it does!\" said La Ramee, scratching his\nhead; \"you are in the wrong to tell me that, my lord. I shall have to\nwatch the men who pick up balls.\"\n\nThe duke smiled.\n\n\"But,\" resumed La Ramee, \"that is only a way of corresponding.\"\n\n\"And that is a great deal, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"But not enough.\"\n\n\"Pardon me; for instance, I say to my friends, Be on a certain day, on a\ncertain hour, at the other side of the moat with two horses.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\" La Ramee began to be uneasy; \"unless the horses have\nwings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you.\"\n\n\"That's not needed. I have,\" replied the duke, \"a way of descending from\nthe ramparts.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A rope ladder.\"\n\n\"Yes, but,\" answered La Ramee, trying to laugh, \"a ladder of ropes can't\nbe sent around a ball, like a letter.\"\n\n\"No, but it may be sent in something else.\"\n\n\"In something else--in something else? In what?\"\n\n\"In a pate, for example.\"\n\n\"In a pate?\" said La Ramee.\n\n\"Yes. Let us suppose one thing,\" replied the duke \"let us suppose, for\ninstance, that my maitre d'hotel, Noirmont, has purchased the shop of\nPere Marteau----\"\n\n\"Well?\" said La Ramee, shuddering.\n\n\"Well, La Ramee, who is a gourmand, sees his pates, thinks them more\nattractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall\ntry them. I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with me. That\nwe may be more at our ease, La Ramee removes the guards, keeping only\nGrimaud to wait on us. Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to\nsecond me in everything. The moment for my escape is fixed--seven\no'clock. Well, at a few minutes to seven----\"\n\n\"At a few minutes to seven?\" cried La Ramee, cold sweat upon his brow.\n\n\"At a few minutes to seven,\" returned the duke (suiting the action to\nthe words), \"I raise the crust of the pie; I find in it two poniards,\na ladder of rope, and a gag. I point one of the poniards at La Ramee's\nbreast and I say to him, 'My friend, I am sorry for it, but if thou\nstirrest, if thou utterest one cry, thou art a dead man!'\"\n\nThe duke, in pronouncing these words, suited, as we have said, the\naction to the words. He was standing near the officer and he directed\nthe point of the poniard in such a manner, close to La Ramee's heart,\nthat there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his\ndetermination. Meanwhile, Grimaud, still mute as ever, drew from the pie\nthe other poniard, the rope ladder and the gag.\n\nLa Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes, his alarm every\nmoment increasing.\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" he cried, with an expression of stupefaction in his face;\n\"you haven't the heart to kill me!\"\n\n\"No; not if thou dost not oppose my flight.\"\n\n\"But, my lord, if I allow you to escape I am a ruined man.\"\n\n\"I will compensate thee for the loss of thy place.\"\n\n\"You are determined to leave the chateau?\"\n\n\"By Heaven and earth! This night I am determined to be free.\"\n\n\"And if I defend myself, or call, or cry out?\"\n\n\"I will kill thee, on the honor of a gentleman.\"\n\nAt this moment the clock struck.\n\n\"Seven o'clock!\" said Grimaud, who had not spoken a word.\n\nLa Ramee made one movement, in order to satisfy his conscience. The\nduke frowned, the officer felt the point of the poniard, which, having\npenetrated through his clothes, was close to his heart.\n\n\"Let us dispatch,\" said the duke.\n\n\"My lord, one last favor.\"\n\n\"What? speak, make haste.\"\n\n\"Bind my arms, my lord, fast.\"\n\n\"Why bind thee?\"\n\n\"That I may not be considered as your accomplice.\"\n\n\"Your hands?\" asked Grimaud.\n\n\"Not before me, behind me.\"\n\n\"But with what?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"With your belt, my lord!\" replied La Ramee.\n\nThe duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud, who tied La Ramee in\nsuch a way as to satisfy him.\n\n\"Your feet, too,\" said Grimaud.\n\nLa Ramee stretched out his legs, Grimaud took a table-cloth, tore it\ninto strips and tied La Ramee's feet together.\n\n\"Now, my lord,\" said the poor man, \"let me have the poire d'angoisse. I\nask for it; without it I should be tried in a court of justice because\nI did not raise the alarm. Thrust it into my mouth, my lord, thrust it\nin.\"\n\nGrimaud prepared to comply with this request, when the officer made a\nsign as if he had something to say.\n\n\"Speak,\" said the duke.\n\n\"Now, my lord, do not forget, if any harm happens to me on your account,\nthat I have a wife and four children.\"\n\n\"Rest assured; put the gag in, Grimaud.\"\n\nIn a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate. Two or three chairs\nwere thrown down as if there had been a struggle. Grimaud then took from\nthe pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the\ndoor of the room in which they were, then shut it and double-locked it,\nand both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led\nto the little inclosure. At last they reached the tennis court. It was\ncompletely deserted. No sentinels, no one at any of the windows. The\nduke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch,\nthree cavaliers with two riding horses. The duke exchanged a signal with\nthem. It was indeed for him that they were there.\n\nGrimaud, meantime, undid the means of escape.\n\nThis was not, however, a rope ladder, but a ball of silk cord, with\na narrow board which was to pass between the legs, the ball to unwind\nitself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board.\n\n\"Go!\" said the duke.\n\n\"First, my lord?\" inquired Grimaud.\n\n\"Certainly. If I am caught, I risk nothing but being taken back again to\nprison. If they catch thee, thou wilt be hung.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Grimaud.\n\nAnd instantly, Grimaud, sitting upon the board as if on horseback,\ncommenced his perilous descent.\n\nThe duke followed him with his eyes, with involuntary terror. He had\ngone down about three-quarters of the length of the wall when the cord\nbroke. Grimaud fell--precipitated into the moat.\n\nThe duke uttered a cry, but Grimaud did not give a single moan. He must\nhave been dreadfully hurt, for he did not stir from the place where he\nfell.\n\nImmediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat,\ntied under Grimaud's shoulders the end of a cord, and the remaining two,\nwho held the other end, drew Grimaud to them.\n\n\"Descend, my lord,\" said the man in the moat. \"There are only fifteen\nfeet more from the top down here, and the grass is soft.\"\n\nThe duke had already begun to descend. His task was the more difficult,\nas there was no board to support him. He was obliged to let himself down\nby his hands and from a height of fifty feet. But as we have said he was\nactive, strong, and full of presence of mind. In less than five minutes\nhe arrived at the end of the cord. He was then only fifteen feet from\nthe ground, as the gentlemen below had told him. He let go the rope and\nfell upon his feet, without receiving any injury.\n\nHe instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat, on the top of\nwhich he met De Rochefort. The other two gentlemen were unknown to him.\nGrimaud, in a swoon, was tied securely to a horse.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the duke, \"I will thank you later; now we have not a\nmoment to lose. On, then! on! those who love me, follow me!\"\n\nAnd he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop, snuffing the\nfresh air in his triumph and shouting out, with an expression of face\nwhich it would be impossible to describe:\n\n\"Free! free! free!\"\n\n\n\n\n24. The timely Arrival of D'Artagnan in Paris.\n\n\n\nAt Blois, D'Artagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any\nfuture service he might render the cardinal.\n\nFrom Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers,\nbut D'Artagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis.\nIn turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre, in order to reach the Rue\nTiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette, where he had appointed Porthos\nto meet him, he saw at one of the windows of the hotel, that friend\nhimself dressed in a sky-blue waistcoat, embroidered with silver, and\ngaping, till he showed every one of his white teeth; whilst the people\npassing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman, so handsome and so rich,\nwho seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness.\n\nD'Artagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos\nrecognized them.\n\n\"Eh! D'Artagnan!\" he cried. \"Thank God you have come!\"\n\n\"Eh! good-day, dear friend!\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel.\n\n\"Ah, my dear friend!\" he cried, \"what bad stabling for my horses here.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said D'Artagnan; \"I am most unhappy to hear it, on account of\nthose fine animals.\"\n\n\"And I, also--I was also wretchedly off,\" he answered, moving backward\nand forward as he spoke; \"and had it not been for the hostess,\" he\nadded, with his air of vulgar self-complacency, \"who is very agreeable\nand understands a joke, I should have got a lodging elsewhere.\"\n\nThe pretty Madeleine, who had approached during this colloquy, stepped\nback and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos's words, for she\nthought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated. But to her\ngreat surprise D'Artagnan remained perfectly calm, and instead of being\nangry he laughed, and said to Porthos:\n\n\"Yes, I understand, the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of\nPierrefonds; but console yourself, I will soon conduct you to one much\nbetter.\"\n\n\"When will you do that?\"\n\n\"Immediately, I hope.\"\n\n\"Ah! so much the better!\"\n\nTo that exclamation of Porthos's succeeded a groaning, low and profound,\nwhich seemed to come from behind a door. D'Artagnan, who had just\ndismounted, then saw, outlined against the wall, the enormous stomach of\nMousqueton, whose down-drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress.\n\n\"And you, too, my poor Monsieur Mouston, are out of place in this poor\nhotel, are you not?\" asked D'Artagnan, in that rallying tone which may\nindicate either compassion or mockery.\n\n\"He finds the cooking detestable,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Why, then, doesn't he attend to it himself, as at Chantilly?\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, I have not here, as I had there, the ponds of monsieur le\nprince, where I could catch those beautiful carp, nor the forests of\nhis highness to provide me with partridges. As for the cellar, I have\nsearched every part and poor stuff I found.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Mouston,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I should indeed condole with you\nhad I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to.\"\n\nThen taking Porthos aside:\n\n\"My dear Du Vallon,\" he said, \"here you are in full dress most\nfortunately, for I am going to take you to the cardinal's.\"\n\n\"Gracious me! really!\" exclaimed Porthos, opening his great wondering\neyes.\n\n\"Yes, my friend.\"\n\n\"A presentation? indeed!\"\n\n\"Does that alarm you?\"\n\n\"No, but it agitates me.\"\n\n\"Oh! don't be distressed; you have to deal with a cardinal of another\nkind. This one will not oppress you by his dignity.\"\n\n\"'Tis the same thing--you understand me, D'Artagnan--a court.\"\n\n\"There's no court now. Alas!\"\n\n\"The queen!\"\n\n\"I was going to say, there's no longer a queen. The queen! Rest assured,\nwe shall not see her.\"\n\n\"And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal?\"\n\n\"Immediately. Only, that there may be no delay, I shall borrow one of\nyour horses.\"\n\n\"Certainly; all the four are at your service.\"\n\n\"Oh, I need only one of them for the time being.\"\n\n\"Shall we take our valets?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may as well take Mousqueton. As to Planchet, he has certain\nreasons for not going to court.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\"\n\n\"Oh, he doesn't stand well with his eminence.\"\n\n\"Mouston,\" said Porthos, \"saddle Vulcan and Bayard.\"\n\n\"And for myself, monsieur, shall I saddle Rustaud?\"\n\n\"No, take a more stylish horse, Phoebus or Superbe; we are going with\nsome ceremony.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mousqueton, breathing more freely, \"you are only going, then,\nto make a visit?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, of course, Mouston; nothing else. But to avoid risk, put\nthe pistols in the holsters. You will find mine on my saddle, already\nloaded.\"\n\nMouston breathed a sigh; he couldn't understand visits of ceremony made\nunder arms.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Porthos, looking complacently at his old lackey as he\nwent away, \"you are right, D'Artagnan; Mouston will do; Mouston has a\nvery fine appearance.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled.\n\n\"But you, my friend--are you not going to change your dress?\"\n\n\"No, I shall go as I am. This traveling dress will serve to show the\ncardinal my haste to obey his commands.\"\n\nThey set out on Vulcan and Bayard, followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus,\nand arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven. The streets\nwere crowded, for it was the day of Pentecost, and the crowd looked in\nwonder at these two cavaliers; one as fresh as if he had come out of a\nbandbox, the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but\njust come off a field of battle.\n\nMousqueton also attracted attention; and as the romance of Don Quixote\nwas then the fashion, they said that he was Sancho, who, after having\nlost one master, had found two.\n\nOn reaching the palace, D'Artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in\nwhich he had been ordered to return without delay. He was soon ordered\nto the presence of the cardinal.\n\n\"Courage!\" he whispered to Porthos, as they proceeded. \"Do not be\nintimidated. Believe me, the eye of the eagle is closed forever. We have\nonly the vulture to deal with. Hold yourself as bolt upright as on\nthe day of the bastion of St. Gervais, and do not bow too low to this\nItalian; that might give him a poor idea of you.\"\n\n\"Good!\" answered Porthos. \"Good!\"\n\nMazarin was in his study, working at a list of pensions and benefices,\nof which he was trying to reduce the number. He saw D'Artagnan\nand Porthos enter with internal pleasure, yet showed no joy in his\ncountenance.\n\n\"Ah! you, is it? Monsieur le lieutenant, you have been very prompt. 'Tis\nwell. Welcome to ye.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my lord. Here I am at your eminence's service, as well as\nMonsieur du Vallon, one of my old friends, who used to conceal his\nnobility under the name of Porthos.\"\n\nPorthos bowed to the cardinal.\n\n\"A magnificent cavalier,\" remarked Mazarin.\n\nPorthos turned his head to the right and to the left, and drew himself\nup with a movement full of dignity.\n\n\"The best swordsman in the kingdom, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos bowed to his friend.\n\nMazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as, in later times, Frederick of\nPrussia used to be. He admired the strong hands, the broad shoulders and\nthe steady eye of Porthos. He seemed to see before him the salvation of\nhis administration and of the kingdom, sculptured in flesh and bone. He\nremembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four\npersons.\n\n\"And your two other friends?\" he asked.\n\nPorthos opened his mouth, thinking it a good opportunity to put in a\nword in his turn; D'Artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of\nhis eye.\n\n\"They are prevented at this moment, but will join us later.\"\n\nMazarin coughed a little.\n\n\"And this gentleman, being disengaged, takes to the service willingly?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, and from pure devotion to the cause, for Monsieur de\nBracieux is rich.\"\n\n\"Rich!\" said Mazarin, whom that single word always inspired with a great\nrespect.\n\n\"Fifty thousand francs a year,\" said Porthos.\n\nThese were the first words he had spoken.\n\n\"From pure zeal?\" resumed Mazarin, with his artful smile; \"from pure\nzeal and devotion then?\"\n\n\"My lord has, perhaps, no faith in those words?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Have you, Monsieur le Gascon?\" asked Mazarin, supporting his elbows on\nhis desk and his chin on his hands.\n\n\"I,\" replied the Gascon, \"I believe in devotion as a word at one's\nbaptism, for instance, which naturally comes before one's proper name;\nevery one is naturally more or less devout, certainly; but there should\nbe at the end of one's devotion something to gain.\"\n\n\"And your friend, for instance; what does he expect to have at the end\nof his devotion?\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, my friend has three magnificent estates: that of\nVallon, at Corbeil; that of Bracieux, in the Soissonais; and that of\nPierrefonds, in the Valois. Now, my lord, he would like to have one of\nhis three estates erected into a barony.\"\n\n\"Only that?\" said Mazarin, his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he\ncould pay for Porthos's devotion without opening his purse; \"only that?\nThat can be managed.\"\n\n\"I shall be baron!\" explained Porthos, stepping forward.\n\n\"I told you so,\" said D'Artagnan, checking him with his hand; \"and now\nhis eminence confirms it.\"\n\n\"And you, Monsieur D'Artagnan, what do you want?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is twenty years since Cardinal de\nRichelieu made me lieutenant.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you\ncaptain.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed.\n\n\"Well, that is not impossible. We will see, gentlemen, we will see. Now,\nMonsieur de Vallon,\" said Mazarin, \"what service do you prefer, in the\ntown or in the country?\"\n\nPorthos opened his mouth to reply.\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"Monsieur de Vallon is like me, he prefers\nservice extraordinary--that is to say, enterprises that are considered\nmad and impossible.\"\n\nThat boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin; he fell into\nmeditation.\n\n\"And yet,\" he said, \"I must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to\nquiet service; I have certain apprehensions--well, what is the meaning\nof that?\"\n\nIn fact, a great noise was heard in the ante-chamber; at the same time\nthe door of the study was burst open and a man, covered with dust,\nrushed into it, exclaiming:\n\n\"My lord the cardinal! my lord the cardinal!\"\n\nMazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew\nback, pushing his chair on the castors. D'Artagnan and Porthos moved so\nas to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" exclaimed Mazarin, \"what's the matter? and why do you rush\nin here, as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market-place?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied the messenger, \"I wish to speak to your eminence in\nsecret. I am Monsieur du Poins, an officer in the guards, on duty at the\ndonjon of Vincennes.\"\n\nMazarin, perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that\nhe had something of importance to say, made a sign that D'Artagnan and\nPorthos should give place.\n\nD'Artagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet.\n\n\"Speak, monsieur, speak at once!\" said Mazarin \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"The matter is, my lord, that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to\nescape from the Chateau of Vincennes.\"\n\nMazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the\nnews. He fell back, almost fainting, in his chair.\n\n\"Escaped? Monsieur de Beaufort escaped?\"\n\n\"My lord, I saw him run off from the top of the terrace.\"\n\n\"And you did not fire on him?\"\n\n\"He was out of range.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Chavigny--where was he?\"\n\n\"Absent.\"\n\n\"And La Ramee?\"\n\n\"Was found locked up in the prisoner's room, a gag in his mouth and a\nponiard near him.\"\n\n\"But the man who was under him?\"\n\n\"Was an accomplice of the duke's and escaped along with him.\"\n\nMazarin groaned.\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, advancing toward the cardinal, \"it seems to\nme that your eminence is losing precious time. It may still be possible\nto overtake the prisoner. France is large; the nearest frontier is sixty\nleagues distant.\"\n\n\"And who is to pursue him?\" cried Mazarin.\n\n\"I, pardieu!\"\n\n\"And you would arrest him?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You would arrest the Duc de Beaufort, armed, in the field?\"\n\n\"If your eminence should order me to arrest the devil, I would seize him\nby the horns and would bring him in.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"So would you!\" said Mazarin, looking with astonishment at those two\nmen. \"But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said D'Artagnan, his eyes aflame, \"battle! It is a long\ntime since we have had a battle, eh, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Battle!\" cried Porthos.\n\n\"And you think you can catch him?\"\n\n\"Yes, if we are better mounted than he.\"\n\n\"Go then, take what guards you find here, and pursue him.\"\n\n\"You command us, my lord, to do so?\"\n\n\"And I sign my orders,\" said Mazarin, taking a piece of paper and\nwriting some lines; \"Monsieur du Vallon, your barony is on the back of\nthe Duc de Beaufort's horse; you have nothing to do but to overtake it.\nAs for you, my dear lieutenant, I promise you nothing; but if you bring\nhim back to me, dead or alive, you may ask all you wish.\"\n\n\"To horse, Porthos!\" said D'Artagnan, taking his friend by the hand.\n\n\"Here I am,\" smiled Porthos, with his sublime composure.\n\nThey descended the great staircase, taking with them all the guards they\nfound on their road, and crying out, \"To arms! To arms!\" and immediately\nput spur to horse, which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the\nspeed of the whirlwind.\n\n\"Well, baron, I promise you some good exercise!\" said the Gascon.\n\n\"Yes, my captain.\"\n\nAs they went, the citizens, awakened, left their doors and the street\ndogs followed the cavaliers, barking. At the corner of the Cimetiere\nSaint Jean, D'Artagnan upset a man; it was too insignificant an\noccurrence to delay people so eager to get on. The troop continued its\ncourse as though their steeds had wings.\n\nAlas! there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see\nthat this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy.\n\n\n\n\n25. An Adventure on the High Road.\n\n\n\nThe musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and\nof the road to Vincennes, and soon found themselves out of the town,\nthen in a forest and then within sight of a village.\n\nThe horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step; their\nnostrils reddened like glowing furnaces. D'Artagnan, freely applying\nhis spurs, was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most; Mousqueton\nfollowed two lengths behind; the guards were scattered according to the\nvarying excellence of their respective mounts.\n\nFrom the top of an eminence D'Artagnan perceived a group of people\ncollected on the other side of the moat, in front of that part of the\ndonjon which looks toward Saint Maur. He rode on, convinced that in this\ndirection he would gain intelligence of the fugitive. In five minutes he\nhad arrived at the place, where the guards joined him, coming up one by\none.\n\nThe several members of that group were much excited. They looked at the\ncord, still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet\nfrom the ground. Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged\nconjectures. On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a\nfrightened air.\n\nA few soldiers, commanded by a sergeant, drove away idlers from the\nplace where the duke had mounted his horse. D'Artagnan went straight to\nthe sergeant.\n\n\"My officer,\" said the sergeant, \"it is not permitted to stop here.\"\n\n\"That prohibition is not for me,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Have the fugitives\nbeen pursued?\"\n\n\"Yes, my officer; unfortunately, they are well mounted.\"\n\n\"How many are there?\"\n\n\"Four, and a fifth whom they carried away wounded.\"\n\n\"Four!\" said D'Artagnan, looking at Porthos. \"Do you hear, baron? They\nare only four!\"\n\nA joyous smile lighted Porthos's face.\n\n\"How long a start have they?\"\n\n\"Two hours and a quarter, my officer.\"\n\n\"Two hours and a quarter--that is nothing; we are well mounted, are we\nnot, Porthos?\"\n\nPorthos breathed a sigh; he thought of what was in store for his poor\nhorses.\n\n\"Very good,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and now in what direction did they set\nout?\"\n\n\"That I am forbidden to tell.\"\n\nD'Artagnan drew from his pocket a paper. \"Order of the king,\" he said.\n\n\"Speak to the governor, then.\"\n\n\"And where is the governor?\"\n\n\"In the country.\"\n\nAnger mounted to D'Artagnan's face; he frowned and his cheeks were\ncolored.\n\n\"Ah, you scoundrel!\" he said to the sergeant, \"I believe you are\nimpudent to me! Wait!\"\n\nHe unfolded the paper, presented it to the sergeant with one hand and\nwith the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it.\n\n\"Order of the king, I tell you. Read and answer, or I will blow out your\nbrains!\"\n\nThe sergeant saw that D'Artagnan was in earnest. \"The Vendomois road,\"\nhe replied.\n\n\"And by what gate did they go out?\"\n\n\"By the Saint Maur gate.\"\n\n\"If you are deceiving me, rascal, you will be hanged to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And if you catch up with them you won't come back to hang me,\" murmured\nthe sergeant.\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders, made a sign to his escort and\nstarted.\n\n\"This way, gentlemen, this way!\" he cried, directing his course toward\nthe gate that had been pointed out.\n\nBut, now that the duke had escaped, the concierge had seen fit to fasten\nthe gate with a double lock. It was necessary to compel him to open it,\nas the sergeant had been compelled to speak, and this took another ten\nminutes. This last obstacle having been overcome, the troop pursued\ntheir course with their accustomed ardor; but some of the horses could\nno longer sustain this pace; three of them stopped after an hour's\ngallop, and one fell down.\n\nD'Artagnan, who never turned his head, did not perceive it. Porthos told\nhim of it in his calm manner.\n\n\"If only we two arrive,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it will be enough, since the\nduke's troop are only four in number.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Porthos\n\nAnd he spurred his courser on.\n\nAt the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues\nwithout stopping; their legs began to tremble, and the foam they shed\nwhitened the doublets of their masters.\n\n\"Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing\ntime,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Let us rather kill them! yes, kill them!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"I see\nfresh tracks; 'tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this\nplace.\"\n\nIn fact, the road was trodden by horses' feet, visible even in the\napproaching gloom of evening.\n\nThey set out; after a run of two leagues, Mousqueton's horse sank.\n\n\"Gracious me!\" said Porthos, \"there's Phoebus ruined.\"\n\n\"The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"I'm above that.\"\n\n\"Let us set out again, at full gallop.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we can.\"\n\nBut at last the lieutenant's horse refused to go on; he could not\nbreathe; one last spur, instead of making him advance, made him fall.\n\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Porthos; \"there's Vulcan foundered.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"then we must stop! Give me your horse,\nPorthos. What the devil are you doing?\"\n\n\"By Jove, I am falling, or rather, Bayard is falling,\" answered Porthos.\n\nAll three then cried: \"All's over.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I hear a horse.\"\n\n\"It belongs to one of our companions, who is overtaking us.\"\n\n\"No,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is in advance.\"\n\n\"That is another thing,\" said Porthos; and he listened toward the\nquarter indicated by D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, who, abandoning his horse on the high road,\nhad come on foot to rejoin his master, \"Phoebus could no longer hold out\nand----\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said Porthos.\n\nIn fact, at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night\nwind.\n\n\"It is five hundred feet from here, in advance,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"True, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton; \"and five hundred feet from here is a\nsmall hunting-house.\"\n\n\"Mousqueton, thy pistols,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I have them at hand, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Porthos, take yours from your holsters.\"\n\n\"I have them.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said D'Artagnan, seizing his own; \"now you understand, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Not too well.\"\n\n\"We are out on the king's service.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"For the king's service we need horses.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Then not a word, but set to work!\"\n\nThey went on through the darkness, silent as phantoms; they saw a light\nglimmering in the midst of some trees.\n\n\"Yonder is the house, Porthos,\" said the Gascon; \"let me do what I\nplease and do you what I do.\"\n\nThey glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the\nhouse unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut,\nfour fine horses. A groom was rubbing them down; near them were saddles\nand bridles.\n\nD'Artagnan approached quickly, making a sign to his two companions to\nremain a few steps behind.\n\n\"I buy those horses,\" he said to the groom.\n\nThe groom turned toward him with a look of surprise, but made no reply.\n\n\"Didn't you hear, fellow?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard.\"\n\n\"Why, then, didn't you reply?\"\n\n\"Because these horses are not to be sold,\" was the reply.\n\n\"I take them, then,\" said the lieutenant.\n\nAnd he took hold of one within his reach; his two companions did the\nsame thing.\n\n\"Sir,\" cried the groom, \"they have traversed six leagues and have only\nbeen unsaddled half an hour.\"\n\n\"Half an hour's rest is enough,\" replied the Gascon.\n\nThe groom cried aloud for help. A kind of steward appeared, just as\nD'Artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount. The steward\nattempted to expostulate.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" cried the lieutenant, \"if you say a word I will blow\nout your brains.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" answered the steward, \"do you know that these horses belong\nto Monsieur de Montbazon?\"\n\n\"So much the better; they must be good animals, then.\"\n\n\"Sir, I shall call my people.\"\n\n\"And I, mine; I've ten guards behind me, don't you hear them gallop? and\nI'm one of the king's musketeers. Come, Porthos; come, Mousqueton.\"\n\nThey all mounted the horses as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Halloo! hi! hi!\" cried the steward; \"the house servants, with the\ncarbines!\"\n\n\"On! on!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"there'll be firing! on!\"\n\nThey all set off, swift as the wind.\n\n\"Here!\" cried the steward, \"here!\" whilst the groom ran to a neighboring\nbuilding.\n\n\"Take care of your horses!\" cried D'Artagnan to him.\n\n\"Fire!\" replied the steward.\n\nA gleam, like a flash of lightning, illumined the road, and with the\nflash was heard the whistling of balls, which were fired wildly in the\nair.\n\n\"They fire like grooms,\" said Porthos. \"In the time of the cardinal\npeople fired better than that, do you remember the road to Crevecoeur,\nMousqueton?\"\n\n\"Ah, sir! my left side still pains me!\"\n\n\"Are you sure we are on the right track, lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Egad, didn't you hear? these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon;\nwell, Monsieur de Montbazon is the husband of Madame de Montbazon----\"\n\n\"And----\"\n\n\"And Madame de Montbazon is the mistress of the Duc de Beaufort.\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand,\" replied Porthos; \"she has ordered relays of horses.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left?\"\n\n\"My dear Porthos, you are really a man of most superior understanding,\"\nsaid D'Artagnan, with a look as if he spoke against his conviction.\n\n\"Pooh!\" replied Porthos, \"I am what I am.\"\n\nThey rode on for an hour, till the horses were covered with foam and\ndust.\n\n\"Zounds! what is yonder?\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this,\" said\nPorthos.\n\n\"Something bright.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" cried Mousqueton, \"saw them also.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! have we overtaken them?\"\n\n\"Good! a dead horse!\" said D'Artagnan, pulling up his horse, which\nshied; \"it seems their horses, too, are breaking down, as well as ours.\"\n\n\"I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen,\" exclaimed Porthos,\nleaning over his horse's mane.\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"They appear to be numerous.\"\n\n\"Then 'tis something else.\"\n\n\"Another horse!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"No, dying.\"\n\n\"Saddled?\"\n\n\"Yes, saddled and bridled.\"\n\n\"Then we are upon the fugitives.\"\n\n\"Courage, we have them!\"\n\n\"But if they are numerous,\" observed Mousqueton, \"'tis not we who have\nthem, but they who have us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"they'll suppose us to be stronger than\nthemselves, as we're in pursuit; they'll be afraid and will disperse.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" remarked Porthos.\n\n\"Ah! do you see?\" cried the lieutenant.\n\n\"The lights again! this time I, too, saw them,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"On! on! forward! forward!\" cried D'Artagnan, in his stentorian voice;\n\"we shall laugh over all this in five minutes.\"\n\nAnd they darted on anew. The horses, excited by pain and emulation,\nraced over the dark road, in the midst of which was now seen a moving\nmass, denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n26. The Rencontre.\n\n\n\nThey rode on in this way for ten minutes. Suddenly two dark forms seemed\nto separate from the mass, advanced, grew in size, and as they loomed up\nlarger and larger, assumed the appearance of two horsemen.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"they're coming toward us.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for them,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" cried a hoarse voice.\n\nThe three horsemen made no reply, stopped not, and all that was heard\nwas the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the\npistols with which the two phantoms were armed.\n\n\"Bridle in mouth!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left\nhand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" was asked a second time. \"Not a step forward, or\nyou're dead men.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" cried Porthos, almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle\nas a horse chews his bit. \"Stuff and nonsense; we have seen plenty of\ndead men in our time.\"\n\nHearing these words, the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light\nof the stars might be seen the shining of their arms.\n\n\"Back!\" shouted D'Artagnan, \"or you are dead!\"\n\nTwo shots were the reply to this threat; but the assailants attacked\ntheir foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them;\na third pistol-shot was heard, aimed by D'Artagnan, and one of his\nadversaries fell. As for Porthos, he assaulted the foe with such\nviolence that, although his sword was thrust aside, the enemy was thrown\noff his horse and fell about ten steps from it.\n\n\"Finish, Mouston, finish the work!\" cried Porthos. And he darted on\nbeside his friend, who had already begun a fresh pursuit.\n\n\"Well?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I've broken my man's skull,\" cried D'Artagnan. \"And you----\"\n\n\"I've only thrown the fellow down, but hark!\"\n\nAnother shot of a carbine was heard. It was Mousqueton, who was obeying\nhis master's command.\n\n\"On! on!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"all goes well! we have the first throw.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" answered Porthos, \"behold, other players appear.\"\n\nAnd in fact, two other cavaliers made their appearance, detached, as it\nseemed, from the principal group; they again disputed the road.\n\nThis time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak.\n\n\"Stand aside!\" he cried; \"stand off the road!\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked a voice.\n\n\"The duke!\" Porthos and D'Artagnan roared out both at once.\n\nA burst of laughter was the answer, but finished with a groan.\nD'Artagnan had, with his sword, cut in two the poor wretch who had\nlaughed.\n\nAt the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and\nD'Artagnan turned to him.\n\n\"Bravo! you've killed him, I think.\"\n\n\"No, wounded his horse only.\"\n\n\"What would you have, my dear fellow? One doesn't hit the bull's-eye\nevery time; it is something to hit inside the ring. Ho! parbleau! what\nis the matter with my horse?\"\n\n\"Your horse is falling,\" said Porthos, reining in his own.\n\nIn truth, the lieutenant's horse stumbled and fell on his knees; then a\nrattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die. He had received\nin the chest the bullet of D'Artagnan's first adversary. D'Artagnan\nswore loud enough to be heard in the skies.\n\n\"Does your honor want a horse?\" asked Mousqueton.\n\n\"Zounds! want one!\" cried the Gascon.\n\n\"Here's one, your honor----\"\n\n\"How the devil hast thou two horses?\" asked D'Artagnan, jumping on one\nof them.\n\n\"Their masters are dead! I thought they might be useful, so I took\nthem.\"\n\nMeantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols.\n\n\"Be on the qui vive!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Here are two other cavaliers.\"\n\nAs he spoke, two horsemen advanced at full speed.\n\n\"Ho! your honor!\" cried Mousqueton, \"the man you upset is getting up.\"\n\n\"Why didn't thou do as thou didst to the first man?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I held the horses, my hands were full, your honor.\"\n\nA shot was fired that moment; Mousqueton shrieked with pain.\n\n\"Ah, sir! I'm hit in the other side! exactly opposite the other! This\nhurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Amiens.\"\n\nPorthos turned around like a lion, plunged on the dismounted cavalier,\nwho tried to draw his sword; but before it was out of the scabbard,\nPorthos, with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the\nhead that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher's knife.\n\nMousqueton, groaning, slipped from his horse, his wound not allowing him\nto keep the saddle.\n\nOn perceiving the cavaliers, D'Artagnan had stopped and charged his\npistol afresh; besides, his horse, he found, had a carbine on the bow of\nthe saddle.\n\n\"Here I am!\" exclaimed Porthos. \"Shall we wait, or shall we charge?\"\n\n\"Let us charge them,\" answered the Gascon.\n\n\"Charge!\" cried Porthos.\n\nThey spurred on their horses; the other cavaliers were only twenty steps\nfrom them.\n\n\"For the king!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"The king has no authority here!\" answered a deep voice, which seemed\nto proceed from a cloud, so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of\ndust.\n\n\"'Tis well, we will see if the king's name is not a passport\neverywhere,\" replied the Gascon.\n\n\"See!\" answered the voice.\n\nTwo shots were fired at once, one by D'Artagnan, the other by the\nadversary of Porthos. D'Artagnan's ball took off his enemy's hat. The\nball fired by Porthos's foe went through the throat of his horse, which\nfell, groaning.\n\n\"For the last time, where are you going?\"\n\n\"To the devil!\" answered D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Good! you may be easy, then--you'll get there.\"\n\nD'Artagnan then saw a musket-barrel leveled at him; he had no time to\ndraw from his holsters. He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once\ngiven him, and made his horse rear.\n\nThe ball struck the animal full in front. D'Artagnan felt his horse\ngiving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one\nside.\n\n\"Ah! this,\" cried the voice, the tone of which was at once polished\nand jeering, \"this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat\nbetween men. To the sword, sir! the sword!\"\n\nAnd he jumped off his horse.\n\n\"To the swords! be it so!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"that is exactly what I\nwant.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, in two steps, was engaged with the foe, whom, according to\ncustom, he attacked impetuously, but he met this time with a skill and a\nstrength of arm that gave him pause. Twice he was obliged to step\nback; his opponent stirred not one inch. D'Artagnan returned and again\nattacked him.\n\nTwice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides, without effect;\nsparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth.\n\nAt last D'Artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints\nin fencing. He brought it to bear, skillfully executed it with the\nrapidity of lightning, and struck the blow with a force which he fancied\nwould prove irresistible.\n\nThe blow was parried.\n\n\"'Sdeath!\" he cried, with his Gascon accent.\n\nAt this exclamation his adversary bounded back and, bending his bare\nhead, tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant.\n\nAs to D'Artagnan, afraid of some feint, he still stood on the defensive.\n\n\"Have a care,\" cried Porthos to his opponent; \"I've still two pistols\ncharged.\"\n\n\"The more reason you should fire the first!\" cried his foe.\n\nPorthos fired; the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of\nbattle.\n\nAs the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two\ncombatants.\n\n\"Athos!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"D'Artagnan!\" ejaculated Athos.\n\nAthos raised his sword; D'Artagnan lowered his.\n\n\"Aramis!\" cried Athos, \"don't fire!\"\n\n\"Ah! ha! is it you, Aramis?\" said Porthos.\n\nAnd he threw away his pistol.\n\nAramis pushed his back into his saddle-bags and sheathed his sword.\n\n\"My son!\" exclaimed Athos, extending his hand to D'Artagnan.\n\nThis was the name which he gave him in former days, in their moments of\ntender intimacy.\n\n\"Athos!\" cried D'Artagnan, wringing his hands. \"So you defend him! And\nI, who have sworn to take him dead or alive, I am dishonored--and by\nyou!\"\n\n\"Kill me!\" replied Athos, uncovering his breast, \"if your honor requires\nmy death.\"\n\n\"Oh! woe is me! woe is me!\" cried the lieutenant; \"there's only one man\nin the world who could stay my hand; by a fatality that very man bars my\nway. What shall I say to the cardinal?\"\n\n\"You can tell him, sir,\" answered a voice which was the voice of high\ncommand in the battle-field, \"that he sent against me the only two\nmen capable of getting the better of four men; of fighting man to man,\nwithout discomfiture, against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier\nd'Herblay, and of surrendering only to fifty men!\n\n\"The prince!\" exclaimed at the same moment Athos and Aramis, unmasking\nas they addressed the Duc de Beaufort, whilst D'Artagnan and Porthos\nstepped backward.\n\n\"Fifty cavaliers!\" cried the Gascon and Porthos.\n\n\"Look around you, gentlemen, if you doubt the fact,\" said the duke.\n\nThe two friends looked to the right, to the left; they were encompassed\nby a troop of horsemen.\n\n\"Hearing the noise of the fight,\" resumed the duke, \"I fancied you had\nabout twenty men with you, so I came back with those around me, tired of\nalways running away, and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause; but\nyou are only two.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; but, as you have said, two that are a match for twenty,\"\nsaid Athos.\n\n\"Come, gentlemen, your swords,\" said the duke.\n\n\"Our swords!\" cried D'Artagnan, raising his head and regaining his\nself-possession. \"Never!\"\n\n\"Never!\" added Porthos.\n\nSome of the men moved toward them.\n\n\"One moment, my lord,\" whispered Athos, and he said something in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"As you will,\" replied the duke. \"I am too much indebted to you to\nrefuse your first request. Gentlemen,\" he said to his escort, \"withdraw.\nMonsieur d'Artagnan, Monsieur du Vallon, you are free.\"\n\nThe order was obeyed; D'Artagnan and Porthos then found themselves in\nthe centre of a large circle.\n\n\"Now, D'Herblay,\" said Athos, \"dismount and come here.\"\n\nAramis dismounted and went to Porthos, whilst Athos approached\nD'Artagnan.\n\nAll four once more together.\n\n\"Friends!\" said Athos, \"do you regret you have not shed our blood?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"I regret to see that we, hitherto united, are\nopposed to each other. Ah! nothing will ever go well with us hereafter!\"\n\n\"Oh, Heaven! No, all is over!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Well, be on our side now,\" resumed Aramis.\n\n\"Silence, D'Herblay!\" cried Athos; \"such proposals are not to be made to\ngentlemen such as these. 'Tis a matter of conscience with them, as with\nus.\"\n\n\"Meantime, here we are, enemies!\" said Porthos. \"Gramercy! who would\never have thought it?\"\n\nD'Artagnan only sighed.\n\nAthos looked at them both and took their hands in his.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as\nif you had pierced it through and through. Yes, we are severed; there is\nthe great, the distressing truth! But we have not as yet declared war;\nperhaps we shall have to make certain conditions, therefore a solemn\nconference is indispensable.\"\n\n\"For my own part, I demand it,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"I accept it,\" interposed D'Artagnan, proudly.\n\nPorthos bowed, as if in assent.\n\n\"Let us choose a place of rendezvous,\" continued Athos, \"and in a last\ninterview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain\ntoward each other.\"\n\n\"Good!\" the other three exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, then, the place?\"\n\n\"Will the Place Royale suit you?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"In Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAthos and Aramis looked at each other.\n\n\"The Place Royale--be it so!\" replied Athos.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening, if you like!\"\n\n\"At what hour?\"\n\n\"At ten in the evening, if that suits you; by that time we shall have\nreturned.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"There,\" continued Athos, \"either peace or war will be decided; honor,\nat all events, will be maintained!\"\n\n\"Alas!\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"our honor as soldiers is lost to us\nforever!\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, gravely, \"I assure you that you do me wrong in\ndwelling so upon that. What I think of is, that we have crossed swords\nas enemies. Yes,\" he continued, sadly shaking his head, \"Yes, it is as\nyou said, misfortune, indeed, has overtaken us. Come, Aramis.\"\n\n\"And we, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"will return, carrying our shame to\nthe cardinal.\"\n\n\"And tell him,\" cried a voice, \"that I am not too old yet for a man of\naction.\"\n\nD'Artagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"Bear witness that we have done all that we could.\"\n\n\"That shall be testified to, rest assured. Adieu! we shall meet soon,\nI trust, in Paris, where you shall have your revenge.\" The duke, as he\nspoke, kissed his hand, spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared,\nfollowed by his troop, who were soon lost in distance and darkness.\n\nD'Artagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles\ntwo horses; they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him.\n\n\"What do I see?\" cried the lieutenant. \"Grimaud, is it thou?\"\n\nGrimaud signified that he was not mistaken.\n\n\"And whose horses are these?\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Who has given them to us?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"Athos! Athos!\" muttered D'Artagnan; \"you think of every one; you are\nindeed a nobleman! Whither art thou going, Grimaud?\"\n\n\"To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders, your honor.\"\n\nThey were taking the road toward Paris, when groans, which seemed to\nproceed from a ditch, attracted their attention.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"It is I--Mousqueton,\" said a mournful voice, whilst a sort of shadow\narose out of the side of the road.\n\nPorthos ran to him. \"Art thou dangerously wounded, my dear Mousqueton?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"No, sir, but I am severely.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" said D'Artagnan; \"we must return to Paris.\"\n\n\"I will take care of Mousqueton,\" said Grimaud; and he gave his arm to\nhis old comrade, whose eyes were full of tears, nor could Grimaud tell\nwhether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him\nagain.\n\nD'Artagnan and Porthos went on, meantime, to Paris. They were passed by\na sort of courier, covered with dust, the bearer of a letter from the\nduke to the cardinal, giving testimony to the valor of D'Artagnan and\nPorthos.\n\nMazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him,\nannouncing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up\nmortal strife against him.\n\n\"What consoles me,\" said the cardinal after reading the letter, \"is\nthat, at least, in this chase, D'Artagnan has done me one good turn--he\nhas destroyed Broussel. This Gascon is a precious fellow; even his\nmisadventures are of use.\"\n\nThe cardinal referred to that man whom D'Artagnan upset at the corner\nof the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris, and who was no other than the\nCouncillor Broussel.\n\n\n\n\n27. The four old Friends prepare to meet again.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Porthos, seated in the courtyard of the Hotel de la\nChevrette, to D'Artagnan, who, with a long and melancholy face, had\nreturned from the Palais Royal; \"did he receive you ungraciously, my\ndear friend?\"\n\n\"I'faith, yes! a brute, that cardinal. What are you eating there,\nPorthos?\"\n\n\"I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine; do the same.\"\n\n\"You are right. Gimblou, a glass of wine.\"\n\n\"Well, how has all gone off?\"\n\n\"Zounds! you know there's only one way of saying things, so I went in\nand said, 'My lord, we were not the strongest party.'\n\n\"'Yes, I know that,' he said, 'but give me the particulars.'\n\n\"You know, Porthos, I could not give him the particulars without naming\nour friends; to name them would be to commit them to ruin, so I merely\nsaid they were fifty and we were two.\n\n\"'There was firing, nevertheless, I heard,' he said; 'and your\nswords--they saw the light of day, I presume?'\n\n\"'That is, the night, my lord,' I answered.\n\n\"'Ah!' cried the cardinal, 'I thought you were a Gascon, my friend?'\n\n\"'I am a Gascon,' said I, 'only when I succeed.' The answer pleased him\nand he laughed.\n\n\"'That will teach me,' he said, 'to have my guards provided with better\nhorses; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of\nthem had done as much as you and your friend, you would have kept your\nword and would have brought him back to me dead or alive.'\"\n\n\"Well, there's nothing bad in that, it seems to me,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! no, nothing at all. It was the way in which he spoke.\nIt is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine! They are veritable\nsponges! Gimblou, another bottle.\"\n\nThe bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of\nconsideration D'Artagnan enjoyed in the establishment. He continued:\n\n\"So I was going away, but he called me back.\n\n\"'You have had three horses foundered or killed?' he asked me.\n\n\"'Yes, my lord.'\n\n\"'How much were they worth?'\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Porthos, \"that was very good of him, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"'A thousand pistoles,' I said.\"\n\n\"A thousand pistoles!\" Porthos exclaimed. \"Oh! oh! that is a large sum.\nIf he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price.\"\n\n\"Faith! he was very much inclined to do so, the contemptible fellow.\nHe made a great start and looked at me. I also looked at him; then\nhe understood, and putting his hand into a drawer, he took from it a\nquantity of notes on a bank in Lyons.\"\n\n\"For a thousand pistoles?\"\n\n\"For a thousand pistoles--just that amount, the beggar; not one too\nmany.\"\n\n\"And you have them?\"\n\n\"They are here.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I think he acted very generously.\"\n\n\"Generously! to men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had\ndone him a great service?\"\n\n\"A great service--what was that?\"\n\n\"Why, it seems that I crushed for him a parliament councillor.\"\n\n\"What! that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint\nJean Cemetery?\"\n\n\"That's the man, my dear fellow; he was an annoyance to the cardinal.\nUnfortunately, I didn't crush him flat. It seems that he came to himself\nand that he will continue to be an annoyance.\"\n\n\"See that, now!\" said Porthos; \"and I turned my horse aside from going\nplump on to him! That will be for another time.\"\n\n\"He owed me for the councillor, the pettifogger!\"\n\n\"But,\" said Porthos, \"if he was not crushed completely----\"\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur de Richelieu would have said, 'Five hundred crowns for\nthe councillor.' Well, let's say no more about it. How much were your\nanimals worth, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Ah, if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction.\"\n\n\"No matter; you can tell within ten crowns.\"\n\n\"Why, Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles, and\nputting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty, we should be pretty near the\namount.\"\n\n\"There will remain, then, four hundred and fifty pistoles,\" said\nD'Artagnan, contentedly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"but there are the equipments.\"\n\n\"That is very true. Well, how much for the equipments?\"\n\n\"If we say one hundred pistoles for the three----\"\n\n\"Good for the hundred pistoles; there remains, then, three hundred and\nfifty.\"\n\nPorthos made a sign of assent.\n\n\"We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses,\" said\nD'Artagnan, \"and share the three hundred.\"\n\n\"We will share,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"A paltry piece of business!\" murmured D'Artagnan crumpling his note.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Porthos, \"it is always that. But tell me----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Didn't he speak of me in any way?\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, indeed!\" cried D'Artagnan, who was afraid of disheartening his\nfriend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about\nhim; \"yes, surely, he said----\"\n\n\"He said?\" resumed Porthos.\n\n\"Stop, I want to remember his exact words. He said, 'As to your friend,\ntell him he may sleep in peace.'\"\n\n\"Good, very good,\" said Porthos; \"that signified as clear as daylight\nthat he still intends to make me a baron.\"\n\nAt this moment nine o'clock struck. D'Artagnan started.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Porthos, \"there is nine o'clock. We have a rendezvous,\nyou remember, at the Place Royale.\"\n\n\"Ah! stop! hold your peace, Porthos, don't remind me of it; 'tis that\nwhich has made me so cross since yesterday. I shall not go.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who\ncaused the failure of our enterprise.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Porthos, \"neither of them had any advantage over us. I\nstill had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight, sword in hand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but what if this rendezvous had some hidden\npurpose?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Porthos, \"you can't think that, D'Artagnan!\"\n\nD'Artagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception, but he\nsought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous.\n\n\"We must go,\" said the superb lord of Bracieux, \"lest they should say we\nwere afraid. We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet\ntwo in the Place Royale.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but they took part with the princes without apprising us\nof it. Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms me. We\ndiscovered yesterday the truth; what is the use of going to-day to learn\nsomething else?\"\n\n\"You really have some distrust, then?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Of Aramis, yes, since he has become an abbe. You can't imagine, my dear\nfellow, the sort of man he is. He sees us on the road which leads him to\na bishopric, and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way.\"\n\n\"Ah, as regards Aramis, that is another thing,\" said Porthos, \"and it\nwouldn't surprise me at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try, in his turn, to lay hands on\nus.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! He had us in his power and he let us go. Besides we can be\non our guard; let us take arms, let Planchet post himself behind us with\nhis carbine.\"\n\n\"Planchet is a Frondeur,\" answered D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Devil take these civil wars! one can no more now reckon on one's\nfriends than on one's footmen,\" said Porthos. \"Ah! if Mousqueton were\nhere! there's a fellow who will never desert me!\"\n\n\"So long as you are rich! Ah! my friend! 'tis not civil war that\ndisunites us. It is that we are each of us twenty years older; it is\nthat the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of\ninterest, whispers of ambition, counsels of selfishness. Yes, you are\nright; let us go, Porthos, but let us go well armed; were we not to keep\nthe rendezvous, they would declare we were afraid. Halloo! Planchet!\nhere! saddle our horses, take your carbine.\"\n\n\"Whom are we going to attack, sir?\"\n\n\"No one; a mere matter of precaution,\" answered the Gascon.\n\n\"You know, sir, that they wished to murder that good councillor,\nBroussel, the father of the people?\"\n\n\"Really, did they?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, but he has been avenged. He was carried home in the arms of the\npeople. His house has been full ever since. He has received visits from\nthe coadjutor, from Madame de Longueville, and the Prince de Conti;\nMadame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his\ndoor. And now, whenever he wishes----\"\n\n\"Well, whenever he wishes?\"\n\nPlanchet began to sing:\n\n\n\n    \"Un vent de fronde\n    S'est leve ce matin;\n    Je crois qu'il gronde\n    Contre le Mazarin.\n    Un vent de fronde\n    S'est leve ce matin.\"\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me,\" said D'Artagnan, in a low tone to Porthos,\n\"that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the\nlife out of his councillor.\"\n\n\"You understand, then, monsieur,\" resumed Planchet, \"that if it were for\nsome enterprise like that undertaken against Monsieur Broussel that you\nshould ask me to take my carbine----\"\n\n\"No, don't be alarmed; but where did you get all these details?\"\n\n\"From a good source, sir; I heard it from Friquet.\"\n\n\"From Friquet? I know that name----\"\n\n\"A son of Monsieur de Broussel's servant, and a lad that, I promise you,\nin a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs.\"\n\n\"Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, that is the very boy; he's patronized by Bazin.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I know.\"\n\n\"Of what importance is this little reptile to you?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Gad!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"he has already given me good information and\nhe may do the same again.\"\n\nWhilst all this was going on, Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by\nthe Faubourg St. Antoine. They had taken some refreshment on the road\nand hastened on, that they might not fail at the appointed place. Bazin\nwas their only attendant, for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of\nMousqueton. As they were passing onward, Athos proposed that they should\nlay aside their arms and military costume, and assume a dress more\nsuited to the city.\n\n\"Oh, no, dear count!\" cried Aramis, \"is it not a warlike encounter that\nwe are going to?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Aramis?\"\n\n\"That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois,\nand nothing else.\"\n\n\"What! our friends?\"\n\n\"Are become our most dangerous enemies, Athos. Let us be on our guard.\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear D'Herblay!\"\n\n\"Who can say whether D'Artagnan may not have betrayed us to the\ncardinal? who can tell whether Mazarin may not take advantage of this\nrendezvous to seize us?\"\n\n\"What! Aramis, you think that D'Artagnan, that Porthos, would lend their\nhands to such an infamy?\"\n\n\"Among friends, my dear Athos, no, you are right; but among enemies it\nwould be only a stratagem.\"\n\nAthos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head.\n\n\"What can you expect, Athos? Men are so made; and we are not always\ntwenty years old. We have cruelly wounded, as you know, that personal\npride by which D'Artagnan is blindly governed. He has been beaten. Did\nyou not observe his despair on the journey? As to Porthos, his barony\nwas perhaps dependent on that affair. Well, he found us on his road\nand will not be baron this time. Perhaps that famous barony will\nhave something to do with our interview this evening. Let us take our\nprecautions, Athos.\"\n\n\"But suppose they come unarmed? What a disgrace to us.\"\n\n\"Oh, never fear! besides, if they do, we can easily make an excuse; we\ncame straight off a journey and are insurgents, too.\"\n\n\"An excuse for us! to meet D'Artagnan with a false excuse! to have to\nmake a false excuse to Porthos! Oh, Aramis!\" continued Athos, shaking\nhis head mournfully, \"upon my soul, you make me the most miserable\nof men; you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship. Go in\nwhatever guise you choose; for my part, I shall go unarmed.\"\n\n\"No, for I will not allow you to do so. 'Tis not one man, not Athos\nonly, not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable\nweakness, but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you.\"\n\n\"Be it so then,\" replied Athos, sorrowfully.\n\nAnd they pursued their road in mournful silence.\n\nScarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the\nPlace Royale, when they perceived three cavaliers, D'Artagnan, Porthos,\nand Planchet, the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under\nwhich their swords were hidden, and Planchet, his musket by his side.\nThey were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine, and\ntheir horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade. Athos, therefore,\ncommanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same\nmanner.\n\nThey then advanced two and two, and saluted each other politely.\n\n\"Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference?\"\ninquired Aramis, perceiving that people were stopping to look at them,\nsupposing that they were going to engage in one of those far-famed\nduels still extant in the memory of the Parisians, and especially the\ninhabitants of the Place Royale.\n\n\"The gate is shut,\" said Aramis, \"but if these gentlemen like a cool\nretreat under the trees, and perfect seclusion, I will get the key from\nthe Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well suited.\"\n\nD'Artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place. Porthos\nventured to put his head between the railings, to try if his glance\ncould penetrate the gloom.\n\n\"If you prefer any other place,\" said Athos, in his persuasive voice,\n\"choose for yourselves.\"\n\n\"This place, if Monsieur d'Herblay can procure the key, is the best that\nwe can have,\" was the answer.\n\nAramis went off at once, begging Athos not to remain alone within reach\nof D'Artagnan and Porthos; a piece of advice which was received with a\ncontemptuous smile.\n\nAramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan, who was saying\nto him:\n\n\"You swear, sir, that it is not so?\"\n\n\"Stop,\" and Aramis gave him a louis d'or.\n\n\"Ah! you will not swear, my master,\" said the concierge, shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"Well, one can never say what may happen; at present we and these\ngentlemen are excellent friends.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" added Athos and the other two.\n\nD'Artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it.\n\n\"You see?\" he said to Porthos.\n\n\"What do I see?\"\n\n\"That he wouldn't swear.\"\n\n\"Swear what?\"\n\n\"That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place\nRoyale to fight.\"\n\n\"And Aramis wouldn't swear?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Attention, then!\"\n\nAthos did not lose sight of the two speakers. Aramis opened the gate\nand faced around in order that D'Artagnan and Porthos might enter. In\npassing through the gate, the hilt of the lieutenant's sword was caught\nin the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak; in doing so he\nshowed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected\non the shining metal.\n\n\"Do you see?\" whispered Aramis to Athos, touching his shoulder with one\nhand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under\nhis belt.\n\n\"Alas! I do!\" replied Athos, with a deep sigh.\n\nHe entered third, and Aramis, who shut the gate after him, last. The\ntwo serving-men waited without; but as if they likewise mistrusted each\nother, they kept their respective distances.\n\n\n\n\n28. The Place Royale.\n\n\n\nThey proceeded silently to the centre of the Place, but as at this very\nmoment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud, they thought they\nmight be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained\nthe shade of the lime-trees.\n\nThere were benches here and there; the four gentlemen stopped near them;\nat a sign from Athos, Porthos and D'Artagnan sat down, the two others\nstood in front of them.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silent embarrassment, Athos spoke.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"our presence here is the best proof of former\nfriendship; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous; not\none has, therefore, to reproach himself.\"\n\n\"Hear me, count,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"instead of making compliments to\neach other, let us explain our conduct to each other, like men of right\nand honest hearts.\"\n\n\"I wish for nothing more; have you any cause of complaint against me or\nMonsieur d'Herblay? If so, speak out,\" answered Athos.\n\n\"I have,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"When I saw you at your chateau at\nBragelonne, I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly\nunderstood; instead of answering me as a friend, you played with me as\na child; the friendship, therefore, that you boast of was not broken\nyesterday by the shock of swords, but by your dissimulation at your\ncastle.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan!\" said Athos, reproachfully.\n\n\"You asked for candor and you have it. You ask what I have against you;\nI tell you. And I have the same sincerity to show you, if you wish,\nMonsieur d'Herblay; I acted in a similar way to you and you also\ndeceived me.\"\n\n\"Really, monsieur, you say strange things,\" said Aramis. \"You came\nseeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them? No,\nyou sounded me, nothing more. Very well what did I say to you? that\nMazarin was contemptible and that I wouldn't serve Mazarin. But that is\nall. Did I tell you that I wouldn't serve any other? On the contrary, I\ngave you to understand, I think, that I adhered to the princes. We\neven joked very pleasantly, if I remember rightly, on the very probable\ncontingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest. Were\nyou a party man? There is no doubt of that. Well, why should not we,\ntoo, belong to a party? You had your secret and we had ours; we didn't\nexchange them. So much the better; it proves that we know how to keep\nour secrets.\"\n\n\"I do not reproach you, monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan; \"'tis only because\nMonsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your\nconduct.\"\n\n\"And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame?\" asked Aramis,\nhaughtily.\n\nThe blood mounted instantly to the temples of D'Artagnan, who arose, and\nreplied:\n\n\"I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits.\"\n\nOn seeing D'Artagnan rise, Porthos rose also; these four men were\ntherefore all standing at the same time, with a menacing aspect,\nopposite to each other.\n\nUpon hearing D'Artagnan's reply, Aramis seemed about to draw his sword,\nwhen Athos prevented him.\n\n\"D'Artagnan,\" he said, \"you are here to-night, still infuriated by\nyesterday's adventure. I believed your heart noble enough to enable a\nfriendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an\nhour. Come, do you really think you have anything to say against me? Say\nit then; if I am in fault I will avow the error.\"\n\nThe grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have\nstill its ancient influence, whilst that of Aramis, which had become\nharsh and tuneless in his moments of ill-humor, irritated him. He\nanswered therefore:\n\n\"I think, monsieur le comte, that you had something to communicate to\nme at your chateau of Bragelonne, and that gentleman\"--he pointed to\nAramis--\"had also something to tell me when I was in his convent. At\nthat time I was not concerned in the adventure, in the course of which\nyou have so successfully estopped me! However, because I was prudent you\nmust not take me for a fool. If I had wished to widen the breach between\nthose whom Monsieur d'Herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and\nthose whom he receives with a wooden ladder, I could have spoken out.\"\n\n\"What are you meddling with?\" cried Aramis, pale with anger, suspecting\nthat D'Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame\nde Longueville.\n\n\"I never meddle save with what concerns me, and I know how to make\nbelieve that I haven't seen what does not concern me; but I hate\nhypocrites, and among that number I place musketeers who are abbes and\nabbes who are musketeers; and,\" he added, turning to Porthos \"here's a\ngentleman who's of the same opinion as myself.\"\n\nPorthos, who had not spoken one word, answered merely by a word and a\ngesture.\n\nHe said \"yes\" and he put his hand on his sword.\n\nAramis started back and drew his. D'Artagnan bent forward, ready either\nto attack or to stand on his defense.\n\nAthos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command\nwhich characterized him alone, drew out his sword and the scabbard at\nthe same time, broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the\npieces to his right. Then turning to Aramis:\n\n\"Aramis,\" he said, \"break your sword.\"\n\nAramis hesitated.\n\n\"It must be done,\" said Athos; then in a lower and more gentle voice, he\nadded. \"I wish it.\"\n\nThen Aramis, paler than before, but subdued by these words, snapped\nthe serpent blade between his hands, and then folding his arms, stood\ntrembling with rage.\n\nThese proceedings made D'Artagnan and Porthos draw back. D'Artagnan did\nnot draw his sword; Porthos put his back into the sheath.\n\n\"Never!\" exclaimed Athos, raising his right hand to Heaven, \"never! I\nswear before God, who seeth us, and who, in the darkness of this night\nheareth us, never shall my sword cross yours, never my eye express\na glance of anger, nor my heart a throb of hatred, at you. We lived\ntogether, we loved, we hated together; we shed, we mingled our blood\ntogether, and too probably, I may still add, that there may be yet a\nbond between us closer even than that of friendship; perhaps there may\nbe the bond of crime; for we four, we once did condemn, judge and slay\na human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world,\nalthough apparently fitter for hell than for this life. D'Artagnan, I\nhave always loved you as my son; Porthos, we slept six years side by\nside; Aramis is your brother as well as mine, and Aramis has once loved\nyou, as I love you now and as I have ever loved you. What can Cardinal\nMazarin be to us, to four men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to\nact as we pleased? What is such or such a prince to us, who fixed the\ndiadem upon a great queen's head? D'Artagnan, I ask your pardon for\nhaving yesterday crossed swords with you; Aramis does the same to\nPorthos; now hate me if you can; but for my own part, I shall ever, even\nif you do hate me, retain esteem and friendship for you. I repeat my\nwords, Aramis, and then, if you desire it, and if they desire it, let us\nseparate forever from our old friends.\"\n\nThere was a solemn, though momentary silence, which was broken by\nAramis.\n\n\"I swear,\" he said, with a calm brow and kindly glance, but in a voice\nstill trembling with recent emotion, \"I swear that I no longer bear\nanimosity to those who were once my friends. I regret that I ever\ncrossed swords with you, Porthos; I swear not only that it shall never\nagain be pointed at your breast, but that in the bottom of my heart\nthere will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment; now,\nAthos, come.\"\n\nAthos was about to retire.\n\n\"Oh! no! no! do not go away!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, impelled by one of\nthose irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature, the\nnative brightness of his character; \"I swear that I would give the\nlast drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve\nthe friendship of such a friend as you, Athos--of such a man as you,\nAramis.\" And he threw himself into the arms of Athos.\n\n\"My son!\" exclaimed Athos, pressing him in his arms.\n\n\"And as for me,\" said Porthos, \"I swear nothing, but I'm choked.\nForsooth! If I were obliged to fight against you, I think I should allow\nmyself to be pierced through and through, for I never loved any one\nbut you in the wide world;\" and honest Porthos burst into tears as he\nembraced Athos.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Athos, \"this is what I expected from such hearts\nas yours. Yes, I have said it and I now repeat it: our destinies are\nirrevocably united, although we now pursue divergent roads. I respect\nyour convictions, and whilst we fight for opposite sides, let us\nremain friends. Ministers, princes, kings, will pass away like mountain\ntorrents; civil war, like a forest flame; but we--we shall remain; I\nhave a presentiment that we shall.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"let us still be musketeers, and let us\nretain as our battle-standard that famous napkin of the bastion\nSt. Gervais, on which the great cardinal had three fleurs-de-lis\nembroidered.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" cried Aramis. \"Cardinalists or Frondeurs, what matters\nit? Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel, devoted friends in\nbusiness, merry companions in our ancient pleasures.\"\n\n\"And whenever,\" added Athos, \"we meet in battle, at this word, 'Place\nRoyale!' let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with\nthe right, even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage.\"\n\n\"You speak charmingly,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"And are the first of men!\" added D'Artagnan. \"You excel us all.\"\n\nAthos smiled with ineffable pleasure.\n\n\"'Tis then all settled. Gentlemen, your hands; are we not pretty good\nChristians?\"\n\n\"Egad!\" said D'Artagnan, \"by Heaven! yes.\"\n\n\"We should be so on this occasion, if only to be faithful to our oath,\"\nsaid Aramis.\n\n\"Ah, I'm ready to do what you will,\" cried Porthos; \"even to swear by\nMahomet. Devil take me if I've ever been so happy as at this moment.\"\n\nAnd he wiped his eyes, still moist.\n\n\"Has not one of you a cross?\" asked Athos.\n\nAramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds, which was hung\naround his neck by a chain of pearls. \"Here is one,\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Athos, \"swear on this cross, which, in spite of its\nmagnificent material, is still a cross; swear to be united in spite of\neverything, and forever, and may this oath bind us to each other, and\neven, also, our descendants! Does this oath satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said they all, with one accord.\n\n\"Ah, traitor!\" muttered D'Artagnan, leaning toward Aramis and whispering\nin his ear, \"you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse.\"\n\n\n\n\n29. The Ferry across the Oise.\n\n\n\nWe hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom\nwe left on the road to Flanders.\n\nIn losing sight of his guardian, whom he had quitted, gazing after him\nin front of the royal basilican, Raoul spurred on his horse, in order\nnot only to escape from his own melancholy reflections, but also to hide\nfrom Olivain the emotion his face might betray.\n\nOne hour's rapid progress, however, sufficed to disperse the gloomy\nfancies that had clouded the young man's bright anticipations; and the\nhitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom--a pleasure which is sweet even to\nthose who have never known dependence--seemed to Raoul to gild not only\nHeaven and earth, but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we\ncall the future.\n\nNevertheless, after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he\nforesaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull; and the\ncount's agreeable voice, his gentle and persuasive eloquence, recurred\nto his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about\nwhich he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details\nwhich he would have drawn from Athos, the most amusing and the best\ninformed of guides. Another recollection contributed also to sadden\nRaoul: on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived, hidden behind a\nscreen of poplars, a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of\nLa Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at\nit, and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to\nOlivain's respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention.\nThe aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating\nwith the fibres of memory, which in spite of us will arouse them at\ntimes; this thread, like that of Ariadne, when once unraveled will\nconduct one through a labyrinth of thought, in which one loses one's\nself in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called\nrecollection.\n\nNow the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues\nwestward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he\nhad taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for\nthe first time; and every branch of oak, every gilded weathercock on\nroof of slates, reminded him that, instead of returning to the friends\nof his childhood, every instant estranged him further and that perhaps\nhe had even left them forever.\n\nWith a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the\nhorses to a wayside inn, which he observed within gunshot range, a\nlittle in advance of the place they had reached.\n\nAs for himself, he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of\nchestnuts in flower, amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy\nbees, and bade Olivain send the host to him with writing paper and\nink, to be placed on a table which he found there, conveniently ready.\nOlivain obeyed and continued on his way, whilst Raoul remained sitting,\nwith his elbow leaning on the table, from time to time gently shaking\nthe flowers from his head, which fell upon him like snow, and gazing\nvaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him, dotted over\nwith green fields and groups of trees. Raoul had been there about\nten minutes, during five of which he was lost in reverie, when there\nappeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a\nrubicund face, who, with a napkin around his body, another under his\narm, and a white cap upon his head, approached him, holding paper, pen\nand ink in hand.\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed the apparition, \"every gentleman seems to have the\nsame fancy, for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad, well mounted\nlike you, as tall as you and of about your age, halted before this clump\nof trees and had this table and this chair brought here, and dined here,\nwith an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor, upon a pie, of which\nthey haven't left a mouthful, and two bottles of Macon wine, of which\nthey haven't left a drop, but fortunately we have still some of the same\nwine and some of the same pies left, and if your worship will but give\nyour orders----\"\n\n\"No, friend,\" replied Raoul, smiling, \"I am obliged to you, but at this\nmoment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked--only I\nshall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good; upon these\nconditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle, and for the\nink the price of the pie.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said the host, \"I'll give the pie and the bottle of\nwine to your servant, and in this way you will have the pen and ink into\nthe bargain.\"\n\n\"Do as you like,\" said Raoul, who was beginning his apprenticeship with\nthat particular class of society, who, when there were robbers on the\nhighroads, were connected with them, and who, since highwaymen no longer\nexist, have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place.\n\nThe host, his mind at ease about his bill, placed pen, ink and paper\nupon the table. By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul\nbegan to write. The host remained standing in front of him, looking with\na kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face, combining both\ngravity and sweetness of expression. Beauty has always been and always\nwill be all-powerful.\n\n\"He's not a guest like the other one here just now,\" observed mine host\nto Olivain, who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything,\n\"and your young master has no appetite.\"\n\n\"My master had appetite enough three days ago, but what can one do? he\nlost it the day before yesterday.\"\n\nAnd Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn,\nOlivain, according to the custom of serving-men well pleased with their\nplace, relating to the tavern-keeper all that he could say in favor of\nthe young gentleman; whilst Raoul wrote on thus:\n\n\n\n\"Sir,--After a four hours' march I stop to write to you, for I miss you\nevery moment, and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to\nreply when you speak to me. I was so bewildered by your departure and so\novercome with grief at our separation, that I am sure I was able to but\nvery feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you.\nYou will forgive me, sir, for your heart is of such a generous nature\nthat you can well understand all that has passed in mine. I entreat\nyou to write to me, for you form a part of my existence, and, if I may\nventure to tell you so, I also feel anxious. It seemed to me as if you\nwere yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking, about which\nI did not dare to question you, since you told me nothing. I have,\ntherefore, as you see, great need of hearing from you. Now that you are\nno longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring. You sustained\nme powerfully, sir, and I protest to you that to-day I feel very lonely.\nWill you have the goodness, sir, should you receive news from Blois, to\nsend me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\nabout whose health, when we left, so much anxiety was felt? You can\nunderstand, honored and dear guardian, how precious and indispensable to\nme is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you. I hope\nthat you will sometimes, too, think of me, and if at certain hours you\nshould miss me, if you should feel any slight regret at my absence,\nI shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my\naffection for and my devotion to yourself, and that I have been able to\nprove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you.\"\n\n\n\nAfter finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed; he looked well\naround him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him,\nwhilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper, a mute and touching caress,\nwhich the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter.\n\nDuring this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie;\nthe horses were also refreshed. Raoul motioned to the host to approach,\nthrew a crown upon the table, mounted his horse, and posted his letter\nat Senlis. The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses\nenabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace. At\nVerberie, Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man\nwho was preceding them; he had been observed to pass only three-quarters\nof an hour previously, but he was well mounted, as the tavern-keeper had\nalready said, and rode at a rapid pace.\n\n\"Let us try and overtake this gentleman,\" said Raoul to Olivain; \"like\nourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable\ncompany.\"\n\nIt was about four o'clock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at\nCompiegne; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young\ngentleman who was in advance of them. He had stopped, like Raoul, at\nthe Hotel of the Bell and Bottle, the best at Compiegne; and had started\nagain on his journey, saying that he should sleep at Noyon.\n\n\"Well, let us sleep at Noyon,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Olivain, respectfully, \"allow me to remark that we have\nalready much fatigued the horses this morning. I think it would be well\nto sleep here and to start again very early to-morrow. Eighteen leagues\nis enough for the first stage.\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on,\" replied Raoul, \"that I\nmight rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day; let us push\non, then, to Noyon; it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from\nBlois to Paris. We shall arrive at eight o'clock. The horses will have a\nlong night's rest, and at five o'clock to-morrow morning we can be again\non the road.\"\n\nOlivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed\nhis master, grumbling.\n\n\"Go on, go on,\" said he, between his teeth, \"expend your ardor the first\nday; to-morrow, instead of journeying twenty leagues, you will travel\nten, the day after to-morrow, five, and in three days you will be in\nbed. There you must rest; young people are such braggarts.\"\n\nIt was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the\nPlanchets and the Grimauds. Raoul really felt tired, but he was desirous\nof testing his strength, and, brought up in the principles of Athos\nand certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of\ntwenty-five leagues, he did not wish to fall far short of his model.\nD'Artagnan, that man of iron, who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle\nonly, had struck him with admiration. Therefore, in spite of Olivain's\nremarks, he continued to urge his steed more and more, and following a\npleasant little path, leading to a ferry, and which he had been assured\nshortened the journey by the distance of one league, he arrived at the\nsummit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him. A little\ntroop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream, ready\nto embark. Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort; he\ncalled out to him, but they were too distant to be heard; then, in spite\nof the weariness of his beast, he made it gallop but the rising ground\nsoon deprived him of all sight of the travelers, and when he had again\nattained a new height, the ferryboat had left the shore and was making\nfor the opposite bank. Raoul, seeing that he could not arrive in time to\ncross the ferry with the travelers, halted to wait for Olivain. At this\nmoment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river. Raoul\nturned toward the side whence the cry had sounded, and shaded his eyes\nfrom the glare of the setting sun with his hand.\n\n\"Olivain!\" he exclaimed, \"what do I see below there?\"\n\nA second scream, more piercing than the first, now sounded.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" cried Olivain, \"the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken\nand the boat is drifting. But what do I see in the water--something\nstruggling?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" exclaimed Raoul, fixing his glance on one point in the\nstream, splendidly illumined by the setting sun, \"a horse, a rider!\"\n\n\"They are sinking!\" cried Olivain in his turn.\n\nIt was true, and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and\nthat a man was drowning; he gave his horse its head, struck his spurs\ninto its sides, and the animal, urged by pain and feeling that he had\nspace open before him, bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the\nlanding place, and fell into the river, scattering to a distance waves\nof white froth.\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" cried Olivain, \"what are you doing? Good God!\"\n\nRaoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger. This\nwas, in fact, a custom familiar to him. Having been brought up on the\nbanks of the Loire, he might have been said to have been cradled on its\nwaves; a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback, a thousand times\nhad swum across. Athos, foreseeing the period when he should make\na soldier of the viscount, had inured him to all kinds of arduous\nundertakings.\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" continued Olivain, in despair, \"what would the count say\nif he only saw you now!\"\n\n\"The count would do as I do,\" replied Raoul, urging his horse vigorously\nforward.\n\n\"But I--but I,\" cried Olivain, pale and disconsolate rushing about on\nthe shore, \"how shall I cross?\"\n\n\"Leap, coward!\" cried Raoul, swimming on; then addressing the traveler,\nwho was struggling twenty yards in front of him: \"Courage, sir!\" said\nhe, \"courage! we are coming to your aid.\"\n\nOlivain advanced, retired, then made his horse rear--turned it and then,\nstruck to the core by shame, leaped, as Raoul had done, only repeating:\n\n\"I am a dead man! we are lost!\"\n\nIn the meantime, the ferryboat had floated away, carried down by the\nstream, and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and\nmore. A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the\nriver and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning;\nbut being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly.\nRaoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground; but the horse\nand its rider, of whom he did not lose sight, were evidently sinking.\nThe nostrils of the horse were no longer above water, and the rider, who\nhad lost the reins in struggling, fell with his head back and his arms\nextended. One moment longer and all would disappear.\n\n\"Courage!\" cried Raoul, \"courage!\"\n\n\"Too late!\" murmured the young man, \"too late!\"\n\nThe water closed above his head and stifled his voice.\n\nRaoul sprang from his horse, to which he left the charge of its own\npreservation, and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman's side;\nhe seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water;\nthe animal began to breathe again and, as if he comprehended that they\nhad come to his aid, redoubled his efforts. Raoul at the same time\nseized one of the young man's hands and placed it on the mane, which it\ngrasped with the tenacity of a drowning man. Thus, sure that the rider\nwould not release his hold, Raoul now only directed his attention to the\nhorse, which he guided to the opposite bank, helping it to cut through\nthe water and encouraging it with words.\n\nAll at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot\non the sand.\n\n\"Saved!\" exclaimed the man with gray hair, who also touched bottom.\n\n\"Saved!\" mechanically repeated the young gentleman, releasing the mane\nand sliding from the saddle into Raoul's arms; Raoul was but ten yards\nfrom the shore; there he bore the fainting man, and laying him down\nupon the grass, unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his\ndoublet. A moment later the gray-headed man was beside him. Olivain\nmanaged in his turn to land, after crossing himself repeatedly; and\nthe people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able\ntoward the bank, with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat.\n\nThanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young\ngentleman, the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying\nman, who opened his eyes, at first entirely bewildered, but who soon\nfixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" he exclaimed, \"it was you! Without you I was a dead\nman--thrice dead.\"\n\n\"But one recovers, sir, as you perceive,\" replied Raoul, \"and we have\nbut had a little bath.\"\n\n\"Oh! sir, what gratitude I feel!\" exclaimed the man with gray hair.\n\n\"Ah, there you are, my good D'Arminges; I have given you a great fright,\nhave I not? but it is your own fault. You were my tutor, why did you not\nteach me to swim?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur le comte,\" replied the old man, \"had any misfortune\nhappened to you, I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal\nagain.\"\n\n\"But how did the accident happen?\" asked Raoul.\n\n\"Oh, sir, in the most natural way possible,\" replied he to whom they had\ngiven the title of count. \"We were about a third of the way across the\nriver when the cord of the ferryboat broke. Alarmed by the cries and\ngestures of the boatmen, my horse sprang into the water. I cannot\nswim, and dared not throw myself into the river. Instead of aiding the\nmovements of my horse, I paralyzed them; and I was just going to drown\nmyself with the best grace in the world, when you arrived just in\ntime to pull me out of the water; therefore, sir, if you will agree,\nhenceforward we are friends until death.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Raoul, bowing, \"I am entirely at your service, I assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"I am called the Count de Guiche,\" continued the young man; \"my father\nis the Marechal de Grammont; and now that you know who I am, do me the\nhonor to inform me who you are.\"\n\n\"I am the Viscount de Bragelonne,\" answered Raoul, blushing at being\nunable to name his father, as the Count de Guiche had done.\n\n\"Viscount, your countenance, your goodness and your courage incline\nme toward you; my gratitude is already due. Shake hands--I crave your\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Raoul, returning the count's pressure of the hand, \"I\nlike you already, from my heart; pray regard me as a devoted friend, I\nbeseech you.\"\n\n\"And now, where are you going, viscount?\" inquired De Guiche.\n\n\"To join the army, under the prince, count.\"\n\n\"And I, too!\" exclaimed the young man, in a transport of joy. \"Oh, so\nmuch the better, we will fire the first shot together.\"\n\n\"It is well; be friends,\" said the tutor; \"young as you both are, you\nwere perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet. And\nnow,\" continued he, \"you must change your clothes; your servants, to\nwhom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat, ought to\nbe already at the inn. Linen and wine are both being warmed; come.\"\n\nThe young men had no objection to this proposition; on the contrary,\nthey thought it very timely.\n\nThey mounted again at once, whilst looks of admiration passed between\nthem. They were indeed two elegant horsemen, with figures slight and\nupright, noble faces, bright and proud looks, loyal and intelligent\nsmiles.\n\nDe Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age, but he was\nscarcely taller than Raoul, who was only fifteen.\n\n\n\n\n30. Skirmishing.\n\n\n\nThe halt at Noyon was but brief, every one there being wrapped in\nprofound sleep. Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive,\nbut Grimaud did not arrive. Doubtless, too, the horses on their part\nappreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which\nwas granted them. The Count de Guiche was awakened at five o'clock in\nthe morning by Raoul, who came to wish him good-day. They breakfasted in\nhaste, and at six o'clock had already gone ten miles.\n\nThe young count's conversation was most interesting to Raoul, therefore\nhe listened much, whilst the count talked well and long. Brought up\nin Paris, where Raoul had been but once; at the court, which Raoul had\nnever seen; his follies as page; two duels, which he had already found\nthe means of fighting, in spite of the edicts against them and, more\nespecially, in spite of his tutor's vigilance--these things excited the\ngreatest curiosity in Raoul. Raoul had only been at M. Scarron's house;\nhe named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there. Guiche knew\neverybody--Madame de Neuillan, Mademoiselle d'Aubigne, Mademoiselle\nde Scudery, Mademoiselle Paulet, Madame de Chevreuse. He criticised\neverybody humorously. Raoul trembled, lest he should laugh among the\nrest at Madame de Chevreuse, for whom he entertained deep and genuine\nsympathy, but either instinctively, or from affection for the duchess,\nhe said everything in her favor. His praises increased Raoul's\nfriendship twofold. Then came the question of gallantry and love\naffairs. Under this head, also, Bragelonne had much more to hear than\nto tell. He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through\nthree or four rather frivolous adventures, that the count, like himself,\nhad a secret to hide in the depths of his heart.\n\nDe Guiche, as we have said before, had been educated at the court, and\nthe intrigues of this court were not unknown to him. It was the same\ncourt of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak,\nexcept that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had\nhimself been part of it; therefore everything which the Count de Guiche\nrelated was new to his traveling companion. The young count, witty\nand caustic, passed all the world in review; the queen herself was not\nspared, and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule.\n\nThe day passed away as rapidly as an hour. The count's tutor, a man of\nthe world and a bon vivant, up to his eyes in learning, as his pupil\ndescribed him, often recalled the profound erudition, the witty and\ncaustic satire of Athos to Raoul; but as regarded grace, delicacy,\nand nobility of external appearance, no one in these points was to be\ncompared to the Comte de la Fere.\n\nThe horses, which were more kindly used than on the previous day,\nstopped at Arras at four o'clock in the evening. They were approaching\nthe scene of war; and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of\nthe night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras,\nthey determined to remain in the town until the morrow. The French army\nheld all between Pont-a-Marc as far as Valenciennes, falling back upon\nDouai. The prince was said to be in person at Bethune.\n\nThe enemy's army extended from Cassel to Courtray; and as there was no\nspecies of violence or pillage it did not commit, the poor people on the\nfrontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the\nstrong cities which held out a shelter to them. Arras was encumbered\nwith fugitives. An approaching battle was much spoken of, the prince\nhaving manoeuvred, until that movement, only in order to await a\nreinforcement that had just reached him.\n\nThe young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely.\nThe evening was employed in discussing the war; the grooms polished\ntheir arms; the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish, and\nthey awoke in despair, having both dreamed that they had arrived too\nlate to participate in the battle. In the morning it was rumored\nthat Prince de Conde had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin,\nleaving, however, a strong garrison in the former city.\n\nBut as there was nothing positively certain in this report, the young\nwarriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune, free on the road\nto diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary.\n\nThe count's tutor was well acquainted with the country; he consequently\nproposed to take a crossroad, which lay between that of Lens and that of\nBethune. They obtained information at Ablain, and a statement of their\nroute was left for Grimaud. About seven o'clock in the morning they set\nout. De Guiche, who was young and impulsive, said to Raoul, \"Here we\nare, three masters and three servants. Our valets are well armed and\nyours seems to be tough enough.\"\n\n\"I have never seen him put to the test,\" replied Raoul, \"but he is a\nBreton, which promises something.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" resumed De Guiche; \"I am sure he can fire a musket when\nrequired. On my side I have two sure men, who have been in action with\nmy father. We therefore represent six fighting men; if we should meet\na little troop of enemies, equal or even superior in number to our own,\nshall we charge them, Raoul?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied the viscount.\n\n\"Holloa! young people--stop there!\" said the tutor, joining in the\nconversation. \"Zounds! how you manoeuvre my instructions, count! You\nseem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to\nhis highness the prince! Once with the army you may be killed at your\ngood pleasure; but until that time, I warn you that in my capacity of\ngeneral of the army I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the\nfirst red coat we come across.\" De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each\nother, smiling.\n\nThey arrived at Ablain without accident. There they inquired and learned\nthat the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself\nbetween Cambria and La Venthie. Therefore, leaving directions at every\nplace for Grimaud, they took a crossroad which conducted the little\ntroop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys. The country\nwas beautiful, intersected by valleys as green as the emerald. Here\nand there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were\nfollowing. In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little\nwoods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band, thus\nforming the advance guard. Himself and the two young men represented the\nbody of the army, whilst Olivain, with his rifle upon his knee and his\neyes upon the watch, protected the rear.\n\nThey had observed for some time before them, on the horizon, a rather\nthick wood; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps\nfrom it, Monsieur d'Arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in\nadvance the count's two grooms. The servants had just disappeared under\nthe trees, followed by the tutor, and the young men were laughing and\ntalking about a hundred yards off. Olivain was at the same distance in\nthe rear, when suddenly there resounded five or six musket-shots. The\ntutor cried halt; the young men obeyed, pulling up their steeds, and at\nthe same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop.\n\nThe young men, impatient to learn the cause of the firing, spurred on\ntoward the servants. The tutor followed them.\n\n\"Were you stopped?\" eagerly inquired the two youths.\n\n\"No,\" replied the servants, \"it is even probable that we have not been\nseen; the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us, in\nthe thickest part of the wood, and we returned to ask your advice.\"\n\n\"My advice is this,\" said Monsieur d'Arminges, \"and if needs be, my\nwill, that we beat a retreat. There may be an ambuscade concealed in\nthis wood.\"\n\n\"Did you see nothing there?\" asked the count.\n\n\"I thought I saw,\" said one of the servants, \"horsemen dressed in\nyellow, creeping along the bed of the stream.\n\n\"That's it,\" said the tutor. \"We have fallen in with a party of\nSpaniards. Come back, sirs, back.\"\n\nThe two youths looked at each other, and at this moment a pistol-shot\nand cries for help were heard. Another glance between the young men\nconvinced them both that neither had any wish to go back, and as the\ntutor had already turned his horse's head, they both spurred forward,\nRaoul crying: \"Follow me, Olivain!\" and the Count de Guiche: \"Follow,\nUrban and Planchet!\" And before the tutor could recover from his\nsurprise they had both disappeared into the forest. Whilst they spurred\ntheir steeds they held their pistols ready also. In five minutes they\narrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded, and then restraining\ntheir horses, they advanced cautiously.\n\n\"Hush,\" whispered De Guiche, \"these are cavaliers.\"\n\n\"Yes, three on horseback and three who have dismounted.\"\n\n\"Can you see what they are doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man.\"\n\n\"It is some cowardly assassination,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"They are soldiers, though,\" resumed De Bragelonne.\n\n\"Yes, skirmishers; that is to say, highway robbers.\"\n\n\"At them!\" cried Raoul. \"At them!\" echoed De Guiche.\n\n\"Oh! gentlemen! gentlemen! in the name of Heaven!\" cried the poor tutor.\n\nBut he was not listened to, and his cries only served to arouse the\nattention of the Spaniards.\n\nThe men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths, leaving the three\nothers to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers; for\non approaching nearer, instead of one extended figure, the young men\ndiscovered two. De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed\nhis man; and the Spaniard, who had advanced to meet Raoul, aimed in his\nturn, and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm, similar to that of a blow\nfrom a whip. He let off his fire at but four paces. Struck in the breast\nand extending his arms, the Spaniard fell back on the crupper, and the\nterrified horse, turning around, carried him off.\n\nRaoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him,\nand remembering the recommendation of Athos, he, with the rapidity of\nlightning, made his horse rear as the shot was fired. His horse bounded\nto one side, losing its footing, and fell, entangling Raoul's leg under\nits body. The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle,\nin order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt. In the position in\nwhich Raoul lay, unfortunately, he could neither draw his sword from\nthe scabbard, nor his pistols from their holsters. The butt end of the\nmusket hovered over his head, and he could scarcely restrain himself\nfrom closing his eyes, when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard\nand placed a pistol at his throat. \"Yield!\" he cried, \"or you are a\ndead man!\" The musket fell from the soldier's hands, who yielded on the\ninstant. Guiche summoned one of his grooms, and delivering the prisoner\ninto his charge, with orders to shoot him through the head if he\nattempted to escape, he leaped from his horse and approached Raoul.\n\n\"Faith, sir,\" said Raoul, smiling, although his pallor betrayed the\nexcitement consequent on a first affair, \"you are in a great hurry\nto pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me.\nWithout your aid,\" continued he, repeating the count's words \"I should\nhave been a dead man--thrice dead.\"\n\n\"My antagonist took flight,\" replied De Guiche \"and left me at liberty\nto come to your assistance. But are you seriously wounded? I see you are\ncovered with blood!\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Raoul, \"that I have got something like a scratch on\nthe arm. If you will help me to drag myself from under my horse I hope\nnothing need prevent us continuing our journey.\"\n\nMonsieur d'Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were\nattempting to raise the struggling horse. At last Raoul succeeded in\ndrawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal, and\nin a second he was on his feet again.\n\n\"Nothing broken?\" asked De Guiche.\n\n\"Faith, no, thank Heaven!\" replied Raoul; \"but what has become of the\npoor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering?\"\n\n\"I fear we arrived too late. They have killed them, I think, and taken\nflight, carrying off their booty. My servants are examining the bodies.\"\n\n\"Let us go and see whether they are quite dead, or if they can still be\nhelped,\" suggested Raoul. \"Olivain, we have come into possession of two\nhorses, but I have lost my own. Take for yourself the better of the two\nand give me yours.\"\n\nThey approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay.\n\n\n\n\n31. The Monk.\n\n\n\nTwo men lay prone upon the ground, one bathed in blood and motionless,\nwith his face toward the earth; this one was dead. The other leaned\nagainst a tree, supported there by the two valets, and was praying\nfervently, with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven. He had received\na ball in his thigh, which had broken the bone. The young men first\napproached the dead man.\n\n\"He is a priest,\" said Bragelonne, \"he has worn the tonsure. Oh, the\nscoundrels! to lift their hands against a minister of God.\"\n\n\"Come here, sir,\" said Urban, an old soldier who had served under the\ncardinal duke in all his campaigns; \"come here, there is nothing to be\ndone with him, whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other.\"\n\nThe wounded man smiled sadly. \"Save me! Oh, no!\" said he, \"but help me\nto die, if you can.\"\n\n\"Are you a priest?\" asked Raoul.\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"I ask, as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the\nchurch.\"\n\n\"He is the curate of Bethune, sir, and was carrying the holy vessels\nbelonging to his church, and the treasure of the chapter, to a safe\nplace, the prince having abandoned our town yesterday; and as it was\nknown that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country, no one\ndared to accompany the good man, so I offered to do so.\n\n\"And, sir,\" continued the wounded man, \"I suffer much and would like, if\npossible, to be carried to some house.\"\n\n\"Where you can be relieved?\" asked De Guiche.\n\n\"No, where I can confess.\"\n\n\"But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think,\" said\nRaoul.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the wounded man, \"believe me, there is no time to lose;\nthe ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines.\"\n\n\"Are you a surgeon?\" asked De Guiche.\n\n\"No, but I know a little about wounds, and mine, I know, is mortal. Try,\ntherefore, either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest\nor take the trouble to send one to me here. It is my soul that must be\nsaved; as for my body, it is lost.\"\n\n\"To die whilst doing a good deed! It is impossible. God will help you.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, in the name of Heaven!\" said the wounded man, collecting\nall his forces, as if to get up, \"let us not lose time in useless\nwords. Either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on\nyour salvation that you will send me the first monk, the first cure, the\nfirst priest you may meet. But,\" he added in a despairing tone, \"perhaps\nno one will dare to come for it is known that the Spaniards are ranging\nthrough the country, and I shall die without absolution. My God! my God!\nGood God! good God!\" added the wounded man, in an accent of terror which\nmade the young men shudder; \"you will not allow that? that would be too\nterrible!\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, sir,\" replied De Guiche. \"I swear to you, you shall\nreceive the consolation that you ask. Only tell us where we shall find a\nhouse at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a\npriest.\"\n\n\"Thank you, and God reward you! About half a mile from this, on the same\nroad, there is an inn, and about a mile further on, after leaving the\ninn, you will reach the village of Greney. There you must find the\ncurate, or if he is not at home, go to the convent of the Augustines,\nwhich is the last house on the right, and bring me one of the brothers.\nMonk or priest, it matters not, provided only that he has received from\nholy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Arminges,\" said De Guiche, \"remain beside this unfortunate\nman and see that he is removed as gently as possible. The vicomte and\nmyself will go and find a priest.\"\n\n\"Go, sir,\" replied the tutor; \"but in Heaven's name do not expose\nyourself to danger!\"\n\n\"Do not fear. Besides, we are safe for to-day; you know the axiom, 'Non\nbis in idem.'\"\n\n\"Courage, sir,\" said Raoul to the wounded man. \"We are going to execute\nyour wishes.\"\n\n\"May Heaven prosper you!\" replied the dying man, with an accent of\ngratitude impossible to describe.\n\nThe two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten\nminutes reached the inn. Raoul, without dismounting, called to the host\nand announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house\nand begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful. He desired\nhim also, should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon,\nto fetch him, taking on himself the payment of the messenger.\n\nThe host, who saw two young noblemen, richly clad, promised everything\nthey required, and our two cavaliers, after seeing that preparations\nfor the reception were actually begun, started off again and proceeded\nrapidly toward Greney.\n\nThey had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the\nfirst houses of the village, the red-tiled roofs of which stood out from\nthe green trees which surrounded them, when, coming toward them mounted\non a mule, they perceived a poor monk, whose large hat and gray worsted\ndress made them take him for an Augustine brother. Chance for once\nseemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking.\nHe was a man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, but who\nappeared much older from ascetic exercises. His complexion was pale,\nnot of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty, but of a\nbilious, yellow hue; his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended\nbeyond the circle formed by the hat around his head, and his light blue\neyes seemed destitute of any expression.\n\n\"Sir,\" began Raoul, with his usual politeness, \"are you an\necclesiastic?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me that?\" replied the stranger, with a coolness which\nwas barely civil.\n\n\"Because we want to know,\" said De Guiche, haughtily.\n\nThe stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way.\n\nIn a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage.\n\"Answer, sir,\" exclaimed he; \"you have been asked politely, and every\nquestion is worth an answer.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who\ntake a fancy to ask me.\"\n\nIt was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he\nhad of breaking the monk's bones.\n\n\"In the first place,\" he said, making an effort to control himself,\n\"we are not people who may be treated anyhow; my friend there is the\nViscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche. Nor was it from\ncaprice we asked the question, for there is a wounded and dying man who\ndemands the succor of the church. If you be a priest, I conjure you in\nthe name of humanity to follow me to aid this man; if you be not, it is\na different matter, and I warn you in the name of courtesy, of which\nyou appear profoundly ignorant, that I shall chastise you for your\ninsolence.\"\n\nThe pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange, that\nRaoul, whose eyes were still fixed upon him, felt as if this smile had\nstruck to his heart like an insult.\n\n\"He is some Spanish or Flemish spy,\" said he, putting his hand to his\npistol. A glance, threatening and transient as lightning, replied to\nRaoul.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said De Guiche, \"are you going to reply?\"\n\n\"I am a priest,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Then, father,\" said Raoul, forcing himself to convey a respect by\nspeech that did not come from his heart, \"if you are a priest you have\nan opportunity, as my friend has told you, of exercising your vocation.\nAt the next inn you will find a wounded man, now being attended by our\nservants, who has asked the assistance of a minister of God.\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said the monk.\n\nAnd he touched his mule.\n\n\"If you do not go, sir,\" said De Guiche, \"remember that we have two\nsteeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized\nwherever you may be; and then I swear your trial will be summary; one\ncan always find a tree and a cord.\"\n\nThe monk's eye again flashed, but that was all; he merely repeated his\nphrase, \"I will go,\"--and he went.\n\n\"Let us follow him,\" said De Guiche; \"it will be the surest plan.\"\n\n\"I was about to propose so doing,\" answered De Bragelonne.\n\nIn the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether\nhe was followed or not.\n\n\"You see,\" said Raoul, \"we have done wisely.\"\n\n\"What a horrible face that monk has,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"Horrible!\" replied Raoul, \"especially in expression.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said De Guiche, \"a strange face; but these monks are subject\nto such degrading practices; their fasts make them pale, the blows of\nthe discipline make them hypocrites, and their eyes become inflamed\nthrough weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy,\nbut they have lost.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Raoul, \"the poor man will get his priest, but, by Heaven,\nthe penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the\nconfessor. I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different\nappearance.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"you must understand that this is one of\nthose wandering brothers, who go begging on the high road until some\nday a benefice falls down from Heaven on them; they are mostly\nforeigners--Scotch, Irish or Danish. I have seen them before.\"\n\n\"As ugly?\"\n\n\"No, but reasonably hideous.\"\n\n\"What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a\nfriar!\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said De Guiche. \"Absolution comes not from him who administers\nit, but from God. However, for my part, I would rather die unshriven\nthan have anything to say to such a confessor. You are of my opinion,\nare you not, viscount? and I see you playing with the pommel of your\nsword, as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father's\nhead.\"\n\n\"Yes, count, it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you, but\nI feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man. Have you ever\nseen a snake rise up on your path?\"\n\n\"Never,\" answered De Guiche.\n\n\"Well, it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests, and I\nremember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon\nme, curled up, swinging its head and pointing its tongue, I remained\nfixed, pale and as though fascinated, until the moment when the Comte de\nla Fere----\"\n\n\"Your father?\" asked De Guiche.\n\n\"No, my guardian,\" replied Raoul, blushing.\n\n\"Very well----\"\n\n\"Until the moment when the Comte de la Fere,\" resumed Raoul, \"said,\n'Come, Bragelonne, draw your sword;' then only I rushed upon the reptile\nand cut it in two, just at the moment when it was rising on its tail\nand hissing, ere it sprang upon me. Well, I vow I felt exactly the same\nsensation at sight of that man when he said, 'Why do you ask me that?'\nand looked so strangely at me.\"\n\n\"Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels?\"\n\n\"Faith, yes, almost,\" said Raoul.\n\nThey had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on\nthe opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by\nMonsieur d'Arminges. The youths spurred on.\n\n\"There is the wounded man,\" said De Guiche, passing close to the\nAugustine brother. \"Be good enough to hurry yourself a little, monsieur\nmonk.\"\n\nAs for Raoul, he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and\npassed him, turning his head away in repulsion.\n\nThe young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were\nfollowed by the priest. He raised himself to glance in the direction\nwhich they pointed out, saw the monk, and fell back upon the litter, his\nface illumined by joy.\n\n\"And now,\" said the youths, \"we have done all we can for you; and as we\nare in haste to rejoin the prince's army we must continue our journey.\nYou will excuse us, sir, but we are told that a battle is expected and\nwe do not wish to arrive the day after it.\"\n\n\"Go, my young sirs,\" said the sick man, \"and may you both be blessed for\nyour piety. You have done for me, as you promised, all that you could\ndo. As for me I can only repeat, may God protect you and all dear to\nyou!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said De Guiche to his tutor, \"we will precede you, and you can\nrejoin us on the road to Cambrin.\"\n\nThe host was at his door and everything was prepared--bed, bandages, and\nlint; and a groom had gone to Lens, the nearest village, for a doctor.\n\n\"Everything,\" said he to Raoul, \"shall be done as you desire; but you\nwill not stop to have your wound dressed?\"\n\n\"Oh, my wound--mine--'tis nothing,\" replied the viscount; \"it will be\ntime to think about it when we next halt; only have the goodness, should\nyou see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut\nhorse followed by a servant, to tell him, in fact, that you have\nseen me, but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at\nMazingarbe and to stop at Cambrin. This cavalier is my attendant.\"\n\n\"Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and\ntell him yours?\" demanded the host.\n\n\"There is no harm in over-precaution. I am the Viscount de Bragelonne\nand he is called Grimaud.\"\n\nAt this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk\nfrom the other, the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that\nit should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed.\n\n\"Sir monk,\" said De Guiche, \"confess well that brave man; and be not\nconcerned for your expenses or for those of your mule; all is paid.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur,\" said the monk, with one of those smiles that made\nBragelonne shudder.\n\n\"Come, count,\" said Raoul, who seemed instinctively to dislike the\nvicinity of the Augustine; \"come, I feel ill here,\" and the two young\nmen spurred on.\n\nThe litter, borne by two servants, now entered the house. The host and\nhis wife were standing on the steps, whilst the unhappy man seemed to\nsuffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was\nfollowed by the monk. At sight of this pale, bleeding man, the wife\ngrasped her husband's arm.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter?\" asked the latter, \"are you going to be ill\njust now?\"\n\n\"No, but look,\" replied the hostess, pointing to the wounded man; \"I ask\nyou if you recognize him?\"\n\n\"That man--wait a bit.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see you know him,\" exclaimed the wife; \"for you have become pale\nin your turn.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" cried the host, \"misfortune is coming on our house; it is the\nformer executioner of Bethune.\"\n\n\"The former executioner of Bethune!\" murmured the young monk, shrinking\nback and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his\npenitent inspired.\n\nMonsieur d'Arminges, who was at the door, perceived his hesitation.\n\n\"Sir monk,\" said he, \"whether he is now or has been an executioner, this\nunfortunate being is none the less a man. Render to him, then, the last\nservice he can by any possibility ask of you, and your work will be all\nthe more meritorious.\"\n\nThe monk made no reply, but silently wended his way to the room where\nthe two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed. D'Arminges and\nOlivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses, and all four\nstarted off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion. Just\nas the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn, a new traveler\nstopped on the threshold of the inn.\n\n\"What does your worship want?\" demanded the host, pale and trembling\nfrom the discovery he had just made.\n\nThe traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink, and then pointed to\nhis horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something.\n\n\"Ah, diable!\" said the host to himself; \"this man seems dumb. And where\nwill your worship drink?\"\n\n\"There,\" answered the traveler, pointing to the table.\n\n\"I was mistaken,\" said the host, \"he's not quite dumb. And what else\ndoes your worship wish for?\"\n\n\"To know if you have seen a young man pass, fifteen years of age,\nmounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom?\"\n\n\"The Viscount de Bragelonne?\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud?\"\n\nThe traveler made a sign of assent.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the host, \"your young master was here a quarter of an\nhour ago; he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambrin.\"\n\n\"How far is Mazingarbe?\"\n\n\"Two miles and a half.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nGrimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on\nthe table to be filled a second time, when a terrific scream resounded\nfrom the room occupied by the monk and the dying man. Grimaud sprang up.\n\n\"What is that?\" said he; \"whence comes that cry?\"\n\n\"From the wounded man's room,\" replied the host.\n\n\"What wounded man?\"\n\n\"The former executioner of Bethune, who has just been brought in\nhere, assassinated by Spaniards, and who is now being confessed by an\nAugustine friar.\"\n\n\"The old executioner of Bethune,\" muttered Grimaud; \"a man between\nfifty-five and sixty, tall, strong, swarthy, black hair and beard?\"\n\n\"That is he, except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is\nwhite; do you know him?\" asked the host.\n\n\"I have seen him once,\" replied Grimaud, a cloud darkening his\ncountenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of\nrecollection.\n\nAt this instant a second cry, less piercing than the first, but followed\nby prolonged groaning, was heard.\n\nThe three listeners looked at one another in alarm.\n\n\"We must see what it is,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered,\" murmured the\nhost.\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" said the woman, crossing herself.\n\nIf Grimaud was slow in speaking, we know that he was quick to act; he\nsprang to the door and shook it violently, but it was bolted on the\nother side.\n\n\"Open the door!\" cried the host; \"open it instantly, sir monk!\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"Unfasten it, or I will break it in!\" said Grimaud.\n\nThe same silence, and then, ere the host could oppose his design,\nGrimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the\nbolt. The room was inundated with blood, dripping from the mattresses\nupon which lay the wounded man, speechless; the monk had disappeared.\n\n\"The monk!\" cried the host; \"where is the monk?\"\n\nGrimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard.\n\n\"He has escaped by this means,\" exclaimed he.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said the host, bewildered; \"boy, see if the mule\nbelonging to the monk is still in the stable.\"\n\n\"There is no mule,\" cried he to whom this question was addressed.\n\nThe host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously, whilst\nGrimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man, whose worn, hard\nfeatures awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past.\n\n\"There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself,\" said he.\n\n\"Does he still live?\" inquired the innkeeper.\n\nMaking no reply, Grimaud opened the poor man's jacket to feel if the\nheart beat, whilst the host approached in his turn; but in a moment they\nboth fell back, the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming\npallid. The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side\nof the executioner.\n\n\"Run! run for help!\" cried Grimaud, \"and I will remain beside him here.\"\n\nThe host quitted the room in agitation, and as for his wife, she had\nfled at the sound of her husband's cries.\n\n\n\n\n32. The Absolution.\n\n\n\nThis is what had taken place: We have seen that it was not of his\nown free will, but, on the contrary, very reluctantly, that the monk\nattended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a\nmanner. Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen\nany possibility of doing so. He was restrained by the threats of the\ntwo gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants, who doubtless\nhad received their instructions. And besides, he considered it most\nexpedient, without exhibiting too much ill-will, to follow to the end\nhis role as confessor.\n\nThe monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man.\nThe executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to\nthose who are about to die and have no time to lose. He made a movement\nof surprise and said:\n\n\"Father, you are very young.\"\n\n\"Men who bear my robe have no age,\" replied the monk, dryly.\n\n\"Alas, speak to me more gently, father; in my last moments I need a\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Do you suffer much?\" asked the monk.\n\n\"Yes, but in my soul much more than in my body.\"\n\n\"We will save your soul,\" said the young man; \"but are you really the\nexecutioner of Bethune, as these people say?\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" eagerly replied the wounded man, who doubtless feared\nthat the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he\ncould claim--\"that is to say, I was, but am no longer; it is fifteen\nyears since I gave up the office. I still assist at executions, but no\nlonger strike the blow myself--no, indeed.\"\n\n\"You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?\"\n\n\"So long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession\nallowed me to sleep quietly, sheltered as I was by justice and law;\nbut since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private\nvengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of\nGod's creatures--since that day----\"\n\nThe executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" said the monk, who, sitting on the foot of the bed,\nbegan to be interested in a story so strangely introduced.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the dying man, with all the effusiveness of a grief declared\nafter long suppression, \"ah! I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty\nyears of good deeds; I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who\nshed blood; on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who\nwere in danger, and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took\naway. That is not all; the money gained in the exercise of my profession\nI have distributed to the poor; I have been assiduous in attending\nchurch and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to\nseeing me. All have forgiven me, some have even loved me; but I think\nthat God has not pardoned me, for the memory of that execution pursues\nme constantly and every night I see that woman's ghost rising before\nme.\"\n\n\"A woman! You have assassinated a woman, then?\" cried the monk.\n\n\"You also!\" exclaimed the executioner, \"you use that word which sounds\never in my ears--'assassinated!' I have assassinated, then, and not\nexecuted! I am an assassin, then, and not an officer of justice!\" and he\nclosed his eyes with a groan.\n\nThe monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more, for he\nexclaimed eagerly:\n\n\"Go on, I know nothing, as yet; when you have finished your story, God\nand I will judge.\"\n\n\"Oh, father,\" continued the executioner, without opening his eyes, as\nif he feared on opening them to see some frightful object, \"it is\nespecially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river, that\nthis terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me; it then\nseems as if my hand grew heavy, as if the cutlass was still in its\ngrasp, as if the water had the color of blood, and all the voices of\nnature--the whispering of the trees, the murmur of the wind, the lapping\nof the wave--united in a voice tearful, despairing, terrible, crying to\nme, 'Place for the justice of God!'\"\n\n\"Delirium!\" murmured the monk, shaking his head.\n\nThe executioner opened his eyes, turned toward the young man and grasped\nhis arm.\n\n\"'Delirium,'\" he repeated; \"'delirium,' do you say? Oh, no! I remember\ntoo well. It was evening; I had thrown the body into the river and\nthose words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride\npronounced. After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be\nthat of the justice of God.\"\n\n\"But let me see, how was it done? Speak,\" said the monk.\n\n\"It was at night. A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed\nhim. Four other noblemen awaited me. They led me away masked. I reserved\nthe right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem\nunjust. We traveled five or six leagues, serious, silent, and almost\nwithout speaking. At length, through the window of a little hut, they\nshowed me a woman sitting, leaning on a table, and said, 'there is the\nperson to be executed.'\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" said the monk. \"And you obeyed?\"\n\n\"Father, that woman was a monster. It was said that she had poisoned her\nsecond husband; she had tried to assassinate her brother-in-law; she\nhad just poisoned a young woman who was her rival, and before leaving\nEngland she had, it was believed, caused the favorite of the king to be\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"Buckingham?\" cried the monk.\n\n\"Yes, Buckingham.\"\n\n\"The woman was English, then?\"\n\n\"No, she was French, but she had married in England.\"\n\nThe monk turned pale, wiped his brow and went and bolted the door. The\nexecutioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back, groaning,\nupon his bed.\n\n\"No, no; I am here,\" said the monk, quickly coming back to him. \"Go on;\nwho were those men?\"\n\n\"One of them was a foreigner, English, I think. The four others were\nFrench and wore the uniform of musketeers.\"\n\n\"Their names?\" asked the monk.\n\n\"I don't know them, but the four other noblemen called the Englishman\n'my lord.'\"\n\n\"Was the woman handsome?\"\n\n\"Young and beautiful. Oh, yes, especially beautiful. I see her now, as\non her knees at my feet, with her head thrown back, she begged for life.\nI have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful,\nwith a face so pale.\"\n\nThe monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion; he trembled all over; he\nseemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask. At length,\nwith a violent effort at self-control:\n\n\"The name of that woman?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know what it was. As I have said, she was twice married, once\nin France, the second time in England.\"\n\n\"She was young, you say?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five years old.\"\n\n\"Beautiful?\"\n\n\"Ravishingly.\"\n\n\"Blond?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Abundance of hair--falling over her shoulders?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Eyes of an admirable expression?\"\n\n\"When she chose. Oh, yes, it is she!\"\n\n\"A voice of strange sweetness?\"\n\n\"How do you know it?\"\n\nThe executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened\nair at the monk, who became livid.\n\n\"And you killed her?\" the monk exclaimed. \"You were the tool of those\ncowards who dared not kill her themselves? You had no pity for that\nyouthfulness, that beauty, that weakness? you killed that woman?\"\n\n\"Alas! I have already told you, father, that woman, under that angelic\nappearance, had an infernal soul, and when I saw her, when I recalled\nall the evil she had done to me----\"\n\n\"To you? What could she have done to you? Come, tell me!\"\n\n\"She had seduced and ruined my brother, a priest. She had fled with him\nfrom her convent.\"\n\n\"With your brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, my brother was her first lover, and she caused his death. Oh,\nfather, do not look in that way at me! Oh, I am guilty, then; you will\nnot pardon me?\"\n\nThe monk recovered his usual expression.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said, \"I will pardon you if you tell me all.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the executioner, \"all! all! all!\"\n\n\"Answer, then. If she seduced your brother--you said she seduced him,\ndid you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If she caused his death--you said that she caused his death?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated the executioner.\n\n\"Then you must know what her name was as a young girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu!\" cried the executioner, \"I think I am dying. Absolution,\nfather! absolution.\"\n\n\"Tell me her name and I will give it.\"\n\n\"Her name was----My God, have pity on me!\" murmured the executioner; and\nhe fell back on the bed, pale, trembling, and apparently about to die.\n\n\"Her name!\" repeated the monk, bending over him as if to tear from him\nthe name if he would not utter it; \"her name! Speak, or no absolution!\"\n\nThe dying man collected all his forces.\n\nThe monk's eyes glittered.\n\n\"Anne de Bueil,\" murmured the wounded man.\n\n\"Anne de Bueil!\" cried the monk, standing up and lifting his hands to\nHeaven. \"Anne de Bueil! You said Anne de Bueil, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that was her name; and now absolve me, for I am dying.\"\n\n\"I, absolve you!\" cried the priest, with a laugh which made the dying\nman's hair stand on end; \"I, absolve you? I am not a priest.\"\n\n\"You are not a priest!\" cried the executioner. \"What, then, are you?\"\n\n\"I am about to tell you, wretched man.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu!\"\n\n\"I am John Francis de Winter.\"\n\n\"I do not know you,\" said the executioner.\n\n\"Wait, wait; you are going to know me. I am John Francis de Winter,\" he\nrepeated, \"and that woman----\"\n\n\"Well, that woman?\"\n\n\"Was my mother!\"\n\nThe executioner uttered the first cry, that terrible cry which had been\nfirst heard.\n\n\"Oh, pardon me, pardon me!\" he murmured; \"if not in the name of God, at\nleast in your own name; if not as priest, then as son.\"\n\n\"Pardon you!\" cried the pretended monk, \"pardon you! Perhaps God will\npardon you, but I, never!\"\n\n\"For pity's sake,\" said the executioner, extending his arms.\n\n\"No pity for him who had no pity! Die, impenitent, die in despair, die\nand be damned!\" And drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it\ninto the breast of the wounded man, saying, \"Here is my absolution!\"\n\nThen was heard that second cry, not so loud as the first and followed by\na long groan.\n\nThe executioner, who had lifted himself up, fell back upon his bed. As\nto the monk, without withdrawing the poniard from the wound, he ran to\nthe window, opened it, leaped out into the flowers of a small garden,\nglided onward to the stable, took out his mule, went out by a back gate,\nran to a neighbouring thicket, threw off his monkish garb, took from\nhis valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier, clothed himself in it,\nwent on foot to the first post, secured there a horse and continued with\na loose rein his journey to Paris.\n\n\n\n\n33. Grimaud Speaks.\n\n\n\nGrimaud was left alone with the executioner, who in a few moments opened\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Help, help,\" he murmured; \"oh, God! have I not a single friend in the\nworld who will aid me either to live or to die?\"\n\n\"Take courage,\" said Grimaud; \"they are gone to find assistance.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the wounded man, fixing his half opened eyes on\nGrimaud.\n\n\"An old acquaintance,\" replied Grimaud.\n\n\"You?\" and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person\nnow before him.\n\n\"Under what circumstances did we meet?\" he asked again.\n\n\"One night, twenty years ago, my master fetched you from Bethune and\nconducted you to Armentieres.\"\n\n\"I know you well now,\" said the executioner; \"you were one of the four\ngrooms.\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from now?\"\n\n\"I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse. They told\nme the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded, when you uttered two\npiercing cries. At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced\nit open.\"\n\n\"And the monk?\" exclaimed the executioner, \"did you see the monk?\"\n\n\"What monk?\"\n\n\"The monk that was shut in with me.\"\n\n\"No, he was no longer here; he appears to have fled by the window. Was\nhe the man that stabbed you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the executioner.\n\nGrimaud moved as if to leave the room.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked the wounded man.\n\n\"He must be apprehended.\"\n\n\"Do not attempt it; he has revenged himself and has done well. Now I may\nhope that God will forgive me, since my crime is expiated.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill----\"\n\n\"Milady?\"\n\n\"Yes, Milady; it is true you called her thus.\"\n\n\"What has the monk to do with this Milady?\"\n\n\"She was his mother.\"\n\nGrimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden\nmanner.\n\n\"His mother!\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes, his mother.\"\n\n\"But does he know this secret, then?\"\n\n\"I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession.\"\n\n\"Unhappy man!\" cried Grimaud, whose face was covered with sweat at the\nbare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause; \"unhappy\nman, you named no one, I hope?\"\n\n\"I pronounced no name, for I knew none, except his mother's, as a young\ngirl, and it was by this name that he recognized her, but he knows that\nhis uncle was among her judges.\"\n\nThus speaking, he fell back exhausted. Grimaud, wishing to relieve him,\nadvanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger.\n\n\"Touch me not!\" said the executioner; \"if this dagger is withdrawn I\nshall die.\"\n\nGrimaud remained with his hand extended; then, striking his forehead, he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Oh! if this man should ever discover the names of the others, my master\nis lost.\"\n\n\"Haste! haste to him and warn him,\" cried the wounded man, \"if he still\nlives; warn his friends, too. My death, believe me, will not be the end\nof this atrocious misadventure.\"\n\n\"Where was the monk going?\" asked Grimaud.\n\n\"Toward Paris.\"\n\n\"Who stopped him?\"\n\n\"Two young gentlemen, who were on their way to join the army and the\nname of one of whom I heard his companion mention--the Viscount de\nBragelonne.\"\n\n\"And it was this young man who brought the monk to you? Then it was the\nwill of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so\nawful,\" continued Grimaud. \"And yet that woman deserved her fate; do you\nnot think so?\"\n\n\"On one's death-bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison\nwith one's own,\" said the executioner; and falling back exhausted he\nclosed his eyes.\n\nGrimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the\nnecessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la\nFere. Whilst he thus hesitated the host re-entered the room, followed\nnot only by a surgeon, but by many other persons, whom curiosity had\nattracted to the spot. The surgeon approached the dying man, who seemed\nto have fainted.\n\n\"We must first extract the steel from the side,\" said he, shaking his\nhead in a significant manner.\n\nThe prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud,\nwho turned away his head. The weapon, as we have already stated, was\nplunged into the body to the hilt, and as the surgeon, taking it by the\nend, drew it forth, the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them\non him in a manner truly frightful. When at last the blade had been\nentirely withdrawn, a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man\nand a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length\ndrew breath; then, fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular\nexpression, the dying man uttered the last death-rattle and expired.\n\nThen Grimaud, lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was\ngliding along the room, to the horror of all present, made a sign to the\nhost to follow him, paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and\nagain mounted his horse. Grimaud's first intention had been to return to\nParis, but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might\noccasion Raoul, and reflecting that there were now only two miles\nbetween the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour's riding would\nunite them, and that the going, returning and explanation would not\noccupy an hour, he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had\nreached the only inn of Mazingarbe.\n\nRaoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor,\nwhen all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself,\ntravel-stained, dirty, and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy\nexecutioner.\n\n\"Grimaud, my good Grimaud!\" exclaimed Raoul \"here you are at last!\nExcuse me, sirs, this is not a servant, but a friend. How did you leave\nthe count?\" continued he. \"Does he regret me a little? Have you seen\nhim since I left him? Answer, for I have many things to tell you, too;\nindeed, the last three days some odd adventures have happened--but what\nis the matter? how pale you are! and blood, too! What is this?\"\n\n\"It is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who\ndied in my arms.\"\n\n\"In your arms?--that man! but know you who he was?\"\n\n\"He used to be the headsman of Bethune.\"\n\n\"You knew him? and he is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said D'Arminges, \"it is the common lot; even an executioner\nis not exempted. I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound,\nand since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion, too,\nthat death would follow.\"\n\nAt the mention of the monk, Grimaud became pale.\n\n\"Come, come,\" continued D'Arminges, \"to dinner;\" for like most men of\nhis age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to\ninterfere with a repast.\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Raoul. \"Come, Grimaud, order dinner for\nyourself and when you have rested a little we can talk.\"\n\n\"No, sir, no,\" said Grimaud. \"I cannot stop a moment; I must start for\nParis again immediately.\"\n\n\"What? You start for Paris? You are mistaken; it is Olivain who leaves\nme; you are to remain.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Olivain is to stay and I am to go. I have come for\nnothing else but to tell you so.\"\n\n\"But what is the meaning of this change?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"I cannot explain myself.\"\n\n\"Come, tell me, what is the joke?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never joke.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that\nyou were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris. I\nshall follow the count's directions.\"\n\n\"Not under present circumstances, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you mean to disobey me?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I must.\"\n\n\"You persist, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am going; may you be happy, monsieur,\" and Grimaud saluted and\nturned toward the door to go out.\n\nRaoul, angry and at the same time uneasy, ran after him and seized him\nby the arm. \"Grimaud!\" he cried; \"remain; I wish it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Grimaud, \"you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be\nkilled.\" He saluted and made a movement to depart.\n\n\"Grimaud, my friend,\" said the viscount, \"will you leave me thus, in\nsuch anxiety? Speak, speak, in Heaven's name!\" And Raoul fell back\ntrembling upon his chair.\n\n\"I can tell you but one thing, sir, for the secret you wish to know is\nnot my own. You met a monk, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe young men looked at each other with an expression of fear.\n\n\"You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him,\nand perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried both young men.\n\n\"Very well; if ever you meet him again, wherever it may be, whether on\nthe high road or in the street or in a church, anywhere that he or you\nmay be, put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity, without\nmercy, as you would crush a viper or a scorpion! destroy him utterly and\nquit him not until he is dead; the lives of five men are not safe, in my\nopinion, as long as he is on the earth.\"\n\nAnd without adding another word, Grimaud, profiting by the astonishment\nand terror into which he had thrown his auditors, rushed from the room.\nTwo minutes later the thunder of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the\nroad; it was Grimaud, on his way to Paris. When once in the saddle\nGrimaud reflected on two things; first, that at the pace he was going\nhis horse would not carry him ten miles, and secondly, that he had no\nmoney. But Grimaud's ingenuity was more prolific than his speech,\nand therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money\nobtained from the purchase took post horses.\n\n\n\n\n34. On the Eve of Battle.\n\n\n\nRaoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host, who rushed\ninto the apartment crying out, \"The Spaniards! the Spaniards!\"\n\nThat cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation. The\nyoung men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by\nway of Houdin and Bethune.\n\nWhile Monsieur d'Arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready\nfor departure, the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the\nhouse and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body\nof infantry and cavalry. This time it was not a wandering troop of\npartisans; it was an entire army. There was therefore nothing for them\nto do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur d'Arminges and beat\na retreat. They quickly went downstairs. Monsieur d'Arminges was already\nmounted. Olivain had ready the horses of the young men, and the lackeys\nof the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish\nprisoner, mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use. As a\nfurther precaution they had bound his hands.\n\nThe little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin, where\nthey expected to find the prince. But he was no longer there, having\nwithdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee, misled by false\nintelligence of the enemy's movements. Deceived by this intelligence he\nhad concentrated his forces between Vieille-Chapelle and La Venthie; and\nafter a reconnoissance along the entire line, in company with Marshal\nde Grammont, he had returned and seated himself before a table, with\nhis officers around him. He questioned them as to the news they had\neach been charged to obtain, but nothing positive had been learned. The\nhostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out\nof existence.\n\nNow an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening, as when\nhe has completely disappeared. The prince was, therefore, contrary to\nhis custom, gloomy and anxious, when an officer entered and announced to\nMarshal de Grammont that some one wished to see him.\n\nThe Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and\nwent out. The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at\nthe door; no one ventured to speak, for fear of disturbing him.\n\nSuddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard. The prince leaped to his\nfeet, extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound, there\nwas no mistaking it--it was the noise of cannon. Every one stood up.\n\nAt that moment the door opened.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Marshal de Grammont, with a radiant face, \"will your\nhighness permit my son, Count de Guiche, and his traveling companion,\nViscount de Bragelonne, to come in and give news of the enemy, whom they\nhave found while we were looking for him?\"\n\n\"What!\" eagerly replied the prince, \"will I permit? I not only permit, I\ndesire; let them come in.\"\n\nThe marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face\nwith the prince.\n\n\"Speak, gentlemen,\" said the prince, saluting them; \"first speak; we\nshall have time afterward for the usual compliments. The most urgent\nthing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing.\"\n\nIt fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply; not only was\nhe the elder, but he had been presented to the prince by his father.\nBesides, he had long known the prince, whilst Raoul now saw him for the\nfirst time. He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from\nthe inn at Mazingarbe.\n\nMeanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general, already made so\nfamous by the battles of Rocroy, Fribourg, and Nordlingen.\n\nLouis de Bourbon, Prince de Conde, who, since the death of his father,\nHenri de Bourbon, was called, in accordance with the custom of that\nperiod, Monsieur le Prince, was a young man, not more than twenty-six or\ntwenty-seven years old, with the eye of an eagle--agl' occhi grifani,\nas Dante says--aquiline nose, long, waving hair, of medium height,\nwell formed, possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful\nsoldier--that is to say, the rapid glance, quick decision, fabulous\ncourage. At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong\nmind, so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war, by\nhis new contributions to its methods, he had also made a revolution at\nParis, among the young noblemen of the court, whose natural chief he was\nand who, in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court,\nmodeled after Bassompierre, Bellegarde and the Duke d'Angouleme, were\ncalled the petits-maitres.\n\nAt the first words of the Count de Guiche, the prince, having in\nmind the direction whence came the sound of cannon, had understood\neverything. The enemy was marching upon Lens, with the intention,\ndoubtless, of securing possession of that town and separating from\nFrance the army of France. But in what force was the enemy? Was it\na corps sent out to make a diversion? Was it an entire army? To this\nquestion De Guiche could not respond.\n\nNow, as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence, it\nwas these to which the prince had especially desired an answer, exact,\nprecise, positive.\n\nRaoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and\napproaching the prince:\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"will you permit me to hazard a few words on that\nsubject, which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty?\"\n\nThe prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single\nglance; he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years\nold.\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur, speak,\" he said, softening his stern, accented\ntones, as if he were speaking to a woman.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Raoul, blushing, \"might examine the Spanish prisoner.\"\n\n\"Have you a Spanish prisoner?\" cried the prince.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true,\" said De Guiche; \"I had forgotten it.\"\n\n\"That is easily understood; it was you who took him, count,\" said Raoul,\nsmiling.\n\nThe old marshal turned toward the viscount, grateful for that praise of\nhis son, whilst the prince exclaimed:\n\n\"The young man is right; let the prisoner be brought in.\"\n\nMeanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner\nhad been taken and who this young man was.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the prince, turning toward Raoul, \"I know that you have\na letter from my sister, Madame de Longueville; but I see that you have\npreferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Raoul, coloring up, \"I did not wish to interrupt your\nhighness in a conversation so important as that in which you were\nengaged with the count. But here is the letter.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the prince; \"give it to me later. Here is the\nprisoner; let us attend to what is most pressing.\"\n\nThe prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood\nto whoever would buy, and grew old in stratagems and spoils. Since he\nhad been taken he had not uttered a word, so that it was not known to\nwhat country he belonged. The prince looked at him with unspeakable\ndistrust.\n\n\"Of what country are you?\" asked the prince.\n\nThe prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue.\n\n\"Ah! ah! it seems that he is a Spaniard. Do you speak Spanish,\nGrammont?\"\n\n\"Faith, my lord, but indifferently.\"\n\n\"And I not at all,\" said the prince, laughing. \"Gentlemen,\" he said,\nturning to those who were near him \"can any one of you speak Spanish and\nserve me as interpreter?\"\n\n\"I can, my lord,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Ah, you speak Spanish?\"\n\n\"Enough, I think, to fulfill your highness's wishes on this occasion.\"\n\nMeanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no\nunderstanding of what was taking place.\n\n\"My lord asks of what country you are,\" said the young man, in the\npurest Castilian.\n\n\"Ich bin ein Deutscher,\" replied the prisoner.\n\n\"What in the devil does he say?\" asked the prince. \"What new gibberish\nis that?\"\n\n\"He says he is German, my lord,\" replied Raoul; \"but I doubt it, for his\naccent is bad and his pronunciation defective.\"\n\n\"Then you speak German, also?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Well enough to question him in that language?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Question him, then.\"\n\nRaoul began the examination, but the result justified his opinion. The\nprisoner did not understand, or seemed not to understand, what Raoul\nsaid to him; and Raoul could hardly understand his replies, containing\na mixture of Flemish and Alsatian. However, amidst all the prisoner's\nefforts to elude a systematic examination, Raoul had recognized his\nnatural accent.\n\n\"Non siete Spagnuolo,\" he said; \"non siete Tedesco; siete Italiano.\"\n\nThe prisoner started and bit his lips.\n\n\"Ah, that,\" said the prince, \"I understand that language thoroughly; and\nsince he is Italian I will myself continue the examination. Thank you,\nviscount,\" continued the prince, laughing, \"and I appoint you from this\nmoment my interpreter.\"\n\nBut the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in\nthe other languages; his aim was to elude the examination. Therefore, he\nknew nothing either of the enemy's numbers, or of those in command, or\nof the purpose of the army.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the prince, understanding the reason of that\nignorance; \"the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery;\nhe might have purchased his life by speaking; he doesn't wish to speak.\nTake him out and shoot him.\"\n\nThe prisoner turned pale. The two soldiers who had brought him in took\nhim, each by one arm, and led him toward the door, whilst the prince,\nturning to Marshal de Grammont, seemed to have already forgotten the\norder he had given.\n\nWhen he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped. The\nsoldiers, who knew only their orders, attempted to force him along.\n\n\"One moment,\" said the prisoner, in French. \"I am ready to speak, my\nlord.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the prince, laughing, \"I thought we should come to that.\nI have a sure method of limbering tongues. Young men, take advantage of\nit against the time when you may be in command.\"\n\n\"But on condition,\" continued the prisoner, \"that your highness will\nswear that my life shall be safe.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor,\" said the prince.\n\n\"Question, then, my lord.\"\n\n\"Where did the army cross the Lys?\"\n\n\"Between Saint-Venant and Aire.\"\n\n\"By whom is it commanded?\"\n\n\"By Count de Fuonsaldagna, General Beck and the archduke.\"\n\n\"Of how many does it consist?\"\n\n\"Eighteen thousand men and thirty-six cannon.\"\n\n\"And its aim is?\"\n\n\"Lens.\"\n\n\"You see; gentlemen!\" said the prince, turning with a triumphant air\ntoward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said the marshal, \"you have divined all that was\npossible to human genius.\"\n\n\"Recall Le Plessis, Bellievre, Villequier and D'Erlac,\" said the prince,\n\"recall all the troops that are on this side of the Lys. Let them hold\nthemselves in readiness to march to-night. To-morrow, according to all\nprobability, we shall attack the enemy.\"\n\n\"But, my lord,\" said Marshal de Grammont, \"consider that when we have\ncollected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le marechal,\" said the prince, with that wonderful glance that\nwas peculiar to him, \"it is with small armies that great battles are\nwon.\"\n\nThen turning toward the prisoner, \"Take away that man,\" he said, \"and\nkeep him carefully in sight. His life is dependent on the information\nhe has given us; if it is true, he shall be free; if false, let him be\nshot.\"\n\nThe prisoner was led away.\n\n\"Count de Guiche,\" said the prince, \"it is a long time since you saw\nyour father, remain here with him. Monsieur,\" he continued, addressing\nRaoul, \"if you are not too tired, follow me.\"\n\n\"To the end of the world, my lord!\" cried Raoul, feeling an unknown\nenthusiasm for that young general, who seemed to him so worthy of his\nrenown.\n\nThe prince smiled; he despised flatterers, but he appreciated\nenthusiasts.\n\n\"Come, monsieur,\" he said, \"you are good in council, as we have already\ndiscovered; to-morrow we shall know if you are good in action.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the marshal, \"what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Wait here to receive the troops. I shall either return for them myself\nor shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me. Twenty\nguards, well mounted, are all that I shall need for my escort.\"\n\n\"That is very few,\" said the marshal.\n\n\"It is enough,\" replied the prince. \"Have you a good horse, Monsieur de\nBragelonne?\"\n\n\"My horse was killed this morning, my lord, and I am mounted\nprovisionally on my lackey's.\"\n\n\"Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best. No false\nmodesty; take the best horse you can find. You will need it this\nevening, perhaps; you will certainly need it to-morrow.\"\n\nRaoul didn't wait to be told twice; he knew that with superiors,\nespecially when those superiors are princes, the highest politeness is\nto obey without delay or argument; he went down to the stables, picked\nout a pie-bald Andalusian horse, saddled and bridled it himself, for\nAthos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at\na time of danger, and went to rejoin the prince, who at that moment\nmounted his horse.\n\n\"Now, monsieur,\" he said to Raoul, \"will you give me the letter you have\nbrought?\"\n\nRaoul handed the letter to the prince.\n\n\"Keep near me,\" said the latter.\n\nThe prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle, as he was\nwont to do when he wished to have both hands free, unsealed the letter\nof Madame de Longueville and started at a gallop on the road to Lens,\nattended by Raoul and his small escort, whilst messengers sent to recall\nthe troops set out with a loose rein in other directions. The prince\nread as he hastened on.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, after a moment, \"they tell me great things of you.\nI have only to say, after the little that I have seen and heard, that I\nthink even better of you than I have been told.\"\n\nRaoul bowed.\n\nMeanwhile, as the little troop drew nearer to Lens, the noise of the\ncannon sounded louder. The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction\nof the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey. One would have\nsaid that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited\nhis horizon. From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the\nsmell of powder, and he panted like a horse.\n\nAt length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were\nwithin a league of the field of battle, and at a turn of the road they\nperceived the little village of Aunay.\n\nThe peasants were in great commotion. The report of Spanish cruelty\nhad gone out and every one was frightened. The women had already fled,\ntaking refuge in Vitry; only a few men remained. On seeing the prince\nthey hastened to meet him. One of them recognized him.\n\n\"Ah, my lord,\" he said, \"have you come to drive away those rascal\nSpaniards and those Lorraine robbers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the prince, \"if you will serve me as guide.\"\n\n\"Willingly, my lord. Where does your highness wish to go?\"\n\n\"To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the\nsurrounding country----\"\n\n\"In that case, I'm your man.\"\n\n\"I can trust you--you are a true Frenchman?\"\n\n\"I am an old soldier of Rocroy, my lord.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said the prince, handing him a purse, \"here is for Rocroy. Now,\ndo you want a horse, or will you go afoot?\"\n\n\"Afoot, my lord; I have served always in the infantry. Besides, I expect\nto lead your highness into places where you will have to walk.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said the prince; \"let us lose no time.\"\n\nThe peasant started off, running before the prince's horse; then, a\nhundred steps from the village, he took a narrow road hidden at the\nbottom of the valley. For a half league they proceeded thus, the\ncannon-shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to\nhear the hum of the balls. At length they entered a path which, going\nout from the road, skirted the mountainside. The prince dismounted,\nordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example, and directed\nthe others to await his orders, keeping themselves meanwhile on the\nalert. He then began to ascend the path.\n\nIn about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau; those\nruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding\ncountry. At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down\non Lens, at bay, and before Lens the enemy's entire army.\n\nWith a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay\nbefore him, from Lens as far as Vimy. In a moment the plan of the battle\nwhich on the following day was to save France the second time from\ninvasion was unrolled in his mind. He took a pencil, tore a page from\nhis tablets and wrote:\n\n\n\n\"My Dear Marshal,--In an hour Lens will be in the enemy's possession.\nCome and rejoin me; bring with you the whole army. I shall be at Vendin\nto place it in position. To-morrow we shall retake Lens and beat the\nenemy.\"\n\n\n\nThen, turning toward Raoul: \"Go, monsieur,\" he said; \"ride fast and give\nthis letter to Monsieur de Grammont.\"\n\nRaoul bowed, took the letter, went hastily down the mountain, leaped\non his horse and set out at a gallop. A quarter of an hour later he was\nwith the marshal.\n\nA portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was\nexpected from moment to moment. Marshal de Grammont put himself at the\nhead of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to\nVendin, leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the rest. All\nthe artillery was ready to move, and started off at a moment's notice.\n\nIt was seven o'clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the\nappointed place. The prince awaited him there. As he had foreseen,\nLens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raoul's\ndeparture. The event was announced by the cessation of the firing.\n\nAs the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince\narrived in successive detachments. Orders were given that no drum should\nbe beaten, no trumpet sounded.\n\nAt nine o'clock the night had fully come. Still a last ray of twilight\nlighted the plain. The army marched silently, the prince at the head\nof the column. Presently the army came in sight of Lens; two or three\nhouses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what\nsuffering was endured by a town taken by assault.\n\nThe prince assigned to every one his post. Marshal de Grammont was\nto hold the extreme left, resting on Mericourt. The Duc de Chatillon\ncommanded the centre. Finally, the prince led the right wing, resting on\nAunay. The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions\ntaken in the evening. Each one, on awaking, would find himself on the\nfield of battle.\n\nThe movement was executed in silence and with precision. At ten o'clock\nevery one was in his appointed position; at half-past ten the prince\nvisited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day.\n\nThree things were especially urged upon the officers, who were to\nsee that the soldiers observed them scrupulously: the first, that the\ndifferent corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on\nthe same line and that each body should protect its gaps; the second, to\ngo to the charge no faster than a walk; the third, to let the enemy fire\nfirst.\n\nThe prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept\nBragelonne near his own person; but the two young men sought the\nprivilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them. A tent\nwas erected for them near that of the marshal.\n\nAlthough the day had been fatiguing, neither of them was inclined to\nsleep. And besides, even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is\na serious time; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were\nabout to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle. On the\nevening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till\nthen; those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those\nwho are friends become brothers. It need not be said that if in the\ndepths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender, it reaches then,\nquite naturally, the highest exaltation of which it is capable. Some\nsentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two\nfriends, for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an\nend of the tent and began to write.\n\nThe letters were long--the four pages were covered with closely written\nwords. The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled; they\nunderstood without speaking, their organizations were so delicate and\nsympathetic. The letters being finished, each put his own into two\nenvelopes, so that no one, without tearing the first envelope, could\ndiscover to whom the second was addressed; then they drew near to each\nother and smilingly exchanged their letters.\n\n\"In case any evil should happen to me,\" said Bragelonne.\n\n\"In case I should be killed,\" said De Guiche.\n\nThey then embraced each other like two brothers, and each wrapping\nhimself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth\nwhich is the prerogative of birds, flowers and infants.\n\n\n\n\n35. A Dinner in the Old Style.\n\n\n\nThe second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and\nthreatening as the first. Athos, with his superior understanding, wisely\ndeemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory\npoint of reunion, and at the moment when his friends, in deference\nto his deportment and sobriety, dared scarcely speak of some of their\nformer good dinners, he was the first to propose that they should\nall assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves\nunreservedly to their own natural character and manners--a freedom which\nhad formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them\nwhich gave them the name of the inseparables. For different reasons this\nwas an agreeable proposition to them all, and it was therefore agreed\nthat each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request\nof any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating\nhouse in the Rue de la Monnaie, of the sign of the Hermitage. The first\nrendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday, at eight o'clock in\nthe evening precisely.\n\nOn that day, in fact, the four friends arrived punctually at the hour,\neach from his own abode or occupation. Porthos had been trying a new\nhorse; D'Artagnan was on guard at the Louvre; Aramis had been to visit\none of his penitents in the neighborhood; and Athos, whose domicile\nwas established in the Rue Guenegaud, found himself close at hand. They\nwere, therefore, somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of\nthe Hermitage, Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf, Porthos by the Rue\nde la Roule, D'Artagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain l'Auxerrois,\nand Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy.\n\nThe first words exchanged between the four friends, on account of the\nceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration, were\nsomewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness.\nAthos perceived this embarrassment, and by way of supplying an effectual\nremedy, called for four bottles of champagne.\n\nAt this order, given in Athos's habitually calm manner, the face of the\nGascon relaxed and Porthos's brow grew smooth. Aramis was astonished.\nHe knew that Athos not only never drank, but more, that he had a kind of\nrepugnance to wine. This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw\nAthos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm. His\ncompanions followed his example. In a very few minutes the four bottles\nwere empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the\nslightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits. Now the four\nfriends began to speak loud, scarcely waiting till one had finished\nbefore another began, and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at\nthe table. Soon--strange fact--Aramis undid two buttons of his doublet,\nseeing which, Porthos unfastened his entirely.\n\nBattles, long journeys, blows given and received, sufficed for the first\nthemes of conversation, which turned upon the silent struggles sustained\nagainst him who was now called the great cardinal.\n\n\"Faith,\" said Aramis, laughing, \"we have praised the dead enough, let\nus revile the living a little; I should like to say something evil of\nMazarin; is it permissible?\"\n\n\"Go on, go on,\" replied D'Artagnan, laughing heartily; \"relate your\nstory and I will applaud it if it is a good one.\"\n\n\"A great prince,\" said Aramis, \"with whom Mazarin sought an alliance,\nwas invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he\nwould do him the honor to negotiate with him. The prince, who had a\ngreat repugnance to treat with such an ill-bred fellow, made out a list,\nagainst the grain, and sent it. In this list there were three conditions\nwhich displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns\nto renounce them.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha, ha!\" laughed the three friends, \"not a bad bargain; and there\nwas no fear of being taken at his word; what did the prince do then?\"\n\n\"The prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to Mazarin, begging\nhim never to write to him again, and offered twenty thousand francs\nmore, on condition that he would never speak to him. What did Mazarin\ndo?\"\n\n\"Stormed!\" suggested Athos.\n\n\"Beat the messenger!\" cried Porthos.\n\n\"Accepted the money!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You have guessed it,\" answered Aramis; and they all laughed so heartily\nthat the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted\nanything; he thought they were fighting.\n\nAt last their hilarity calmed down and:\n\n\"Faith!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan to the two friends, \"you may well wish ill\nto Mazarin; for I assure you, on his side he wishes you no good.\"\n\n\"Pooh! really?\" asked Athos. \"If I thought the fellow knew me by my name\nI would be rebaptized, for fear it might be thought I knew him.\"\n\n\"He knows you better by your actions than your name; he is quite aware\nthat there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de\nBeaufort, and he has instigated an active search for them, I can answer\nfor it.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By me; and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any\ninformation.\"\n\n\"And what did you reply?\"\n\n\"That I had none as yet; but that I was to dine to-day with two\ngentlemen, who would be able to give me some.\"\n\n\"You told him that?\" said Porthos, a broad smile spreading over his\nhonest face. \"Bravo! and you are not afraid of that, Athos?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Athos, \"it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Aramis, \"tell me a little what you do fear.\"\n\n\"Nothing for the present; at least, nothing in good earnest.\"\n\n\"And with regard to the past?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Oh! the past is another thing,\" said Athos, sighing; \"the past and the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid for your young Raoul?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Well,\" said D'Artagnan, \"one is never killed in a first engagement.\"\n\n\"Nor in the second,\" said Aramis\n\n\"Nor in the third,\" returned Porthos; \"and even when one is killed, one\nrises again, the proof of which is, that here we are!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Athos, \"it is not Raoul about whom I am anxious, for I trust\nhe will conduct himself like a gentleman; and if he is killed--well,\nhe will die bravely; but hold--should such a misfortune happen--well--\"\nAthos passed his hand across his pale brow.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Well, I shall look upon it as an expiation.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan; \"I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" added Aramis; \"but you must not think of that, Athos; what\nis past, is past.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"The affair at Armentieres,\" whispered D'Artagnan.\n\n\"The affair at Armentieres?\" asked he again.\n\n\"Milady.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Porthos; \"true, I had forgotten it!\"\n\nAthos looked at him intently.\n\n\"You have forgotten it, Porthos?\" said he.\n\n\"Faith! yes, it is so long ago,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"This affair does not, then, weigh upon your conscience?\"\n\n\"Faith, no.\"\n\n\"And you, D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"I--I own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no\nrecollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancieux.\nYes, yes,\" murmured he, \"I have often felt regret for the victim, but\nnever the very slightest remorse for the assassin.\"\n\nAthos shook his dead doubtfully.\n\n\"Consider,\" said Aramis, \"if you admit divine justice and its\nparticipation in the things of this world, that woman was punished by\nthe will of heaven. We were but the instruments, that is all.\"\n\n\"But as to free will, Aramis?\"\n\n\"How acts the judge? He has a free will, yet he fearlessly condemns.\nWhat does the executioner? He is master of his arm, yet he strikes\nwithout remorse.\"\n\n\"The executioner!\" muttered Athos, as if arrested by some recollection.\n\n\"I know that it is terrible,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but when I reflect that\nwe have killed English, Rochellais, Spaniards, nay, even French, who\nnever did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us, whose only\nfault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our\nblows--I can, on my honor, find an excuse for my share in the murder of\nthat woman.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said Porthos, \"now that you have reminded me of it, Athos,\nI have the scene again before me, as if I now were there. Milady was\nthere, as it were, where you sit.\" (Athos changed color.) \"I--I\nwas where D'Artagnan stands. I wore a long sword which cut like a\nDamascus--you remember it, Aramis for you always called it Balizarde.\nWell, I swear to you, all three, that had the executioner of\nBethune--was he not of Bethune?--yes, egad! of Bethune!--not been there,\nI would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of\nit, or even after thinking of it. She was a most atrocious woman.\"\n\n\"And then,\" said Aramis, with the tone of philosophical indifference\nwhich he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which\nthere was more atheism than confidence in God, \"what is the use of\nthinking of it all? At the last hour we must confess this action and\nGod knows better than we can whether it is a crime, a fault, or a\nmeritorious deed. I repent of it? Egad! no. Upon my honor and by the\nholy cross; I only regret it because she was a woman.\"\n\n\"The most satisfactory part of the matter,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is that\nthere remains no trace of it.\"\n\n\"She had a son,\" observed Athos.\n\n\"Oh! yes, I know that,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and you mentioned it to me;\nbut who knows what has become of him? If the serpent be dead, why not\nits brood? Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that\nyoung viper? De Winter probably condemned the son as he had done the\nmother.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Athos, \"woe to De Winter, for the child had done no harm.\"\n\n\"May the devil take me, if the child be not dead,\" said Porthos. \"There\nis so much fog in that detestable country, at least so D'Artagnan\ndeclares.\"\n\nJust as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back\nhilarity to faces now more or less clouded, hasty footsteps were heard\nupon the stair and some one knocked at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" cried Athos.\n\n\"Please your honors,\" said the host, \"a person in a great hurry wishes\nto speak to one of you.\"\n\n\"To which of us?\" asked all the four friends.\n\n\"To him who is called the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"It is I,\" said Athos, \"and what is the name of the person?\"\n\n\"Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Athos, turning pale. \"Back already! What can have\nhappened, then, to Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"Let him enter,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"let him come up.\"\n\nBut Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the\nlast step; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it.\nThe door being closed, the four friends waited in expectation. Grimaud's\nagitation, his pallor, the sweat which covered his face, the dust which\nsoiled his clothes, all indicated that he was the messenger of some\nimportant and terrible news.\n\n\"Your honors,\" said he, \"that woman had a child; that child has become\na man; the tigress had a little one, the tiger has roused himself; he is\nready to spring upon you--beware!\"\n\nAthos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile. Porthos\nturned to look at his sword, which was hanging on the wall; Aramis\nseized his knife; D'Artagnan arose.\n\n\"What do you mean, Grimaud?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That Milady's son has left England, that he is in France, on his road\nto Paris, if he be not here already.\"\n\n\"The devil he is!\" said Porthos. \"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"Certain,\" replied Grimaud.\n\nThis announcement was received in silence. Grimaud was so breathless, so\nexhausted, that he had fallen back upon a chair. Athos filled a beaker\nwith champagne and gave it to him.\n\n\"Well, after all,\" said D'Artagnan, \"supposing that he lives, that he\ncomes to Paris; we have seen many other such. Let him come.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" echoed Porthos, glancing affectionately at his sword, still\nhanging on the wall; \"we can wait for him; let him come.\"\n\n\"Moreover, he is but a child,\" said Aramis.\n\nGrimaud rose.\n\n\"A child!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you know what he has done, this child?\nDisguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from\nthe executioner of Bethune, and having confessed him, after having\nlearned everything from him, he gave him absolution by planting this\ndagger into his heart. See, it is on fire yet with his hot blood, for it\nis not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound.\"\n\nAnd Grimaud threw the dagger on the table.\n\nD'Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed\nto their swords. Athos alone remained seated, calm and thoughtful.\n\n\"And you say he is dressed as a monk, Grimaud?\"\n\n\"Yes, as an Augustine monk.\"\n\n\"What sized man is he?\"\n\n\"About my height; thin, pale, with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen\nhair.\"\n\n\"And he did not see Raoul?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Yes, on the contrary, they met, and it was the viscount himself who\nconducted him to the bed of the dying man.\"\n\nAthos, in his turn, rising without speaking, went and unhooked his\nsword.\n\n\"Heigh, sir,\" said D'Artagnan, trying to laugh, \"do you know we look\nvery much like a flock of silly, mouse-evading women! How is it that we,\nfour men who have faced armies without blinking, begin to tremble at the\nmention of a child?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Athos, \"but this child comes in the name of Heaven.\"\n\nAnd very soon they left the inn.\n\n\n\n\n36. A Letter from Charles the First.\n\n\n\nThe reader must now cross the Seine with us and follow us to the door of\nthe Carmelite Convent in the Rue Saint Jacques. It is eleven o'clock in\nthe morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the\nsuccess of the armies of King Charles I. Leaving the church, a woman and\na young girl dressed in black, the one as a widow and the other as an\norphan, have re-entered their cell.\n\nThe woman kneels on a prie-dieu of painted wood and at a short distance\nfrom her stands the young girl, leaning against a chair, weeping.\n\nThe woman must have once been handsome, but traces of sorrow have aged\nher. The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her; the lady\nappears to be about forty years of age, the girl about fourteen.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" prayed the kneeling suppliant, \"protect my husband, guard my\nson, and take my wretched life instead!\"\n\n\"Oh, God!\" murmured the girl, \"leave me my mother!\"\n\n\"Your mother can be of no use to you in this world, Henrietta,\" said\nthe lady, turning around. \"Your mother has no longer either throne or\nhusband; she has neither son, money nor friends; the whole world, my\npoor child, has abandoned your mother!\" And she fell back, weeping, into\nher daughter's arms.\n\n\"Courage, take courage, my dear mother!\" said the girl.\n\n\"Ah! 'tis an unfortunate year for kings,\" said the mother. \"And no one\nthinks of us in this country, for each must think about his own affairs.\nAs long as your brother was with me he kept me up; but he is gone and\ncan no longer send us news of himself, either to me or to your father.\nI have pledged my last jewels, sold your clothes and my own to pay his\nservants, who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice. We\nare now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of Heaven; we\nare the poor, succored by God.\"\n\n\"But why not address yourself to your sister, the queen?\" asked the\ngirl.\n\n\"Alas! the queen, my sister, is no longer queen, my child. Another\nreigns in her name. One day you will be able to understand how all this\nis.\"\n\n\"Well, then, to the king, your nephew. Shall I speak to him? You know\nhow much he loves me, my mother.\n\n\"Alas! my nephew is not yet king, and you know Laporte has told us\ntwenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything.\"\n\n\"Then let us pray to Heaven,\" said the girl.\n\nThe two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and\ngrand-daughter of Henry IV., the wife and daughter of Charles I.\n\nThey had just finished their double prayer, when a nun softly tapped at\nthe door of the cell.\n\n\"Enter, my sister,\" said the queen.\n\n\"I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations,\nbut a foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor,\ndemanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Oh, a letter! a letter from the king, perhaps. News from your father,\ndo you hear, Henrietta? And the name of this lord?\"\n\n\"Lord de Winter.\"\n\n\"Lord de Winter!\" exclaimed the queen, \"the friend of my husband. Oh,\nbid him enter!\"\n\nAnd the queen advanced to meet the messenger, whose hand she seized\naffectionately, whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her,\ncontained in a case of gold.\n\n\"Ah! my lord!\" said the queen, \"you bring us three things which we have\nnot seen for a long time. Gold, a devoted friend, and a letter from the\nking, our husband and master.\"\n\nDe Winter bowed again, unable to reply from excess of emotion.\n\nOn their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a\nwindow to read eagerly the following letter:\n\n\n\n\"Dear Wife,--We have now reached the moment of decision. I have\nconcentrated here at Naseby camp all the resources Heaven has left me,\nand I write to you in haste from thence. Here I await the army of my\nrebellious subjects. I am about to struggle for the last time with them.\nIf victorious, I shall continue the struggle; if beaten, I am lost. I\nshall try, in the latter case (alas! in our position, one must provide\nfor everything), I shall try to gain the coast of France. But can they,\nwill they receive an unhappy king, who will bring such a sad story\ninto a country already agitated by civil discord? Your wisdom and your\naffection must serve me as guides. The bearer of this letter will tell\nyou, madame, what I dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of\ntransit. He will explain to you the steps that I expect you to pursue. I\ncharge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments\nof my soul for yourself, my dearest sweetheart.\"\n\n\n\nThe letter bore the signature, not of \"Charles, King,\" but of\n\"Charles--still king.\"\n\n\"And let him be no longer king,\" cried the queen. \"Let him be conquered,\nexiled, proscribed, provided he still lives. Alas! in these days the\nthrone is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it. But my\nlord, tell me,\" she continued, \"hide nothing from me--what is, in truth,\nthe king's position? Is it as hopeless as he thinks?\"\n\n\"Alas! madame, more hopeless than he thinks. His majesty has so good\na heart that he cannot understand hatred; is so loyal that he does not\nsuspect treason! England is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance\nwhich, I greatly fear, blood alone can exorcise.\"\n\n\"But Lord Montrose,\" replied the queen, \"I have heard of his great and\nrapid successes of battles gained. I heard it said that he was marching\nto the frontier to join the king.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; but on the frontier he was met by Lesly; he had tried\nvictory by means of superhuman undertakings. Now victory has abandoned\nhim. Montrose, beaten at Philiphaugh, was obliged to disperse the\nremains of his army and to fly, disguised as a servant. He is at Bergen,\nin Norway.\"\n\n\"Heaven preserve him!\" said the queen. \"It is at least a consolation to\nknow that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe. And\nnow, my lord, that I see how hopeless the position of the king is, tell\nme with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband.\"\n\n\"Well, then, madame,\" said De Winter, \"the king wishes you to try and\ndiscover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him.\"\n\n\"Alas! you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a\nwoman weak enough. Here, Monsieur Mazarin is everything.\"\n\n\"Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell plays in\nEngland?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! He is a subtle, conscienceless Italian, who though he very\nlikely dreams of crime, dares not commit it; and unlike Cromwell, who\ndisposes of both Houses, Mazarin has had the queen to support him in his\nstruggle with the parliament.\"\n\n\"More reason, then, he should protect a king pursued by parliament.\"\n\nThe queen shook her head despairingly.\n\n\"If I judge for myself, my lord,\" she said, \"the cardinal will do\nnothing, and will even, perhaps, act against us. The presence of my\ndaughter and myself in France is already irksome to him; much more so\nwould be that of the king. My lord,\" added Henrietta, with a melancholy\nsmile, \"it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have\npassed the winter in the Louvre without money, without linen, almost\nwithout bread, and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" cried De Winter; \"the daughter of Henry IV., and the wife\nof King Charles! Wherefore did you not apply, then, madame, to the first\nperson you saw from us?\"\n\n\"Such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a\nking demands it.\"\n\n\"But I heard that a marriage between the Prince of Wales and\nMademoiselle d'Orleans was spoken of,\" said De Winter.\n\n\"Yes, for an instant I hoped it was so. The young people felt a mutual\nesteem; but the queen, who at first sanctioned their affection, changed\nher mind, and Monsieur, the Duc d'Orleans, who had encouraged the\nfamiliarity between them, has forbidden his daughter to think any more\nabout the union. Oh, my lord!\" continued the queen, without restraining\nher tears, \"it is better to fight as the king has done, and to die, as\nperhaps he will, than live in beggary like me.\"\n\n\"Courage, madame! courage! Do not despair! The interests of the French\ncrown, endangered at this moment, are to discountenance rebellion in a\nneighboring nation. Mazarin, as a statesman, will understand the politic\nnecessity.\"\n\n\"Are you sure,\" said the queen doubtfully, \"that you have not been\nforestalled?\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By the Joices, the Prinns, the Cromwells?\"\n\n\"By a tailor, a coachmaker, a brewer! Ah! I hope, madame, that the\ncardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men!\"\n\n\"Ah! what is he himself?\" asked Madame Henrietta.\n\n\"But for the honor of the king--of the queen.\"\n\n\"Well, let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor,\"\nsaid the queen. \"A true friend's eloquence is so powerful, my lord, that\nyou have reassured me. Give me your hand and let us go to the minister;\nand yet,\" she added, \"suppose he should refuse and that the king loses\nthe battle?\"\n\n\"His majesty will then take refuge in Holland, where I hear his highness\nthe Prince of Wales now is.\"\n\n\"And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his\nflight?\"\n\n\"Alas! no, madame,\" answered De Winter; \"but the case is provided for\nand I am come to France to seek allies.\"\n\n\"Allies!\" said the queen, shaking her head.\n\n\"Madame,\" replied De Winter, \"provided I can find some of my good old\nfriends of former times I will answer for anything.\"\n\n\"Come then, my lord,\" said the queen, with the painful doubt that is\nfelt by those who have suffered much; \"come, and may Heaven hear you.\"\n\n\n\n\n37. Cromwell's Letter.\n\n\n\nAt the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the\nPalais Royal, a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode\nand announced to the guards that he had something of importance to\ncommunicate to Cardinal Mazarin. Although the cardinal was often\ntormented by fear, he was more often in need of counsel and information,\nand he was therefore sufficiently accessible. The true difficulty of\nbeing admitted was not to be found at the first door, and even the\nsecond was passed easily enough; but at the third watched, besides the\nguard and the doorkeepers, the faithful Bernouin, a Cerberus whom no\nspeech could soften, no wand, even of gold, could charm.\n\nIt was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were\nbidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory.\n\nThe young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court,\nmounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first\nchamber.\n\n\"Cardinal Mazarin?\" said he.\n\n\"Pass on,\" replied the guard.\n\nThe cavalier entered the second hall, which was guarded by the\nmusketeers and doorkeepers.\n\n\"Have you a letter of audience?\" asked a porter, advancing to the new\narrival.\n\n\"I have one, but not one from Cardinal Mazarin.\"\n\n\"Enter, and ask for Monsieur Bernouin,\" said the porter, opening the\ndoor of the third room. Whether he only held his usual post or whether\nit was by accident, Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door\nand must have heard all that had passed.\n\n\"You seek me, sir,\" said he. \"From whom may the letter be you bear to\nhis eminence?\"\n\n\"From General Oliver Cromwell,\" said the new comer. \"Be so good as to\nmention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will\nreceive me--yes or no.\"\n\nSaying which, he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that\ntime to Puritans. Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person\nof the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal, to whom he\ntransmitted the messenger's words.\n\n\"A man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell?\" said Mazarin. \"And what\nkind of a man?\"\n\n\"A genuine Englishman, your eminence. Hair sandy-red--more red than\nsandy; gray-blue eyes--more gray than blue; and for the rest, stiff and\nproud.\"\n\n\"Let him give in his letter.\"\n\n\"His eminence asks for the letter,\" said Bernouin, passing back into the\nante-chamber.\n\n\"His eminence cannot see the letter without the bearer of it,\" replied\nthe young man; \"but to convince you that I am really the bearer of a\nletter, see, here it is; and kindly add,\" continued he, \"that I am not a\nsimple messenger, but an envoy extraordinary.\"\n\nBernouin re-entered the cabinet, returning in a few seconds. \"Enter,\nsir,\" said he.\n\nThe young man appeared on the threshold of the minister's closet, in one\nhand holding his hat, in the other the letter. Mazarin rose. \"Have you,\nsir,\" asked he, \"a letter accrediting you to me?\"\n\n\"There it is, my lord,\" said the young man.\n\nMazarin took the letter and read it thus:\n\n\n\"Mr. Mordaunt, one of my secretaries, will remit this letter of\nintroduction to His Eminence, the Cardinal Mazarin, in Paris. He is also\nthe bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence.\n\n\"Oliver Cromwell.\"\n\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur Mordaunt,\" said Mazarin, \"give me this second\nletter and sit down.\"\n\nThe young man drew from his pocket a second letter, presented it to the\ncardinal, and took his seat. The cardinal, however, did not unseal the\nletter at once, but continued to turn it again and again in his hand;\nthen, in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience\nthat few people could hide anything from him when he began to question\nthem, fixing his eyes upon them at the same time, he thus addressed the\nmessenger:\n\n\"You are very young, Monsieur Mordaunt, for this difficult task of\nambassador, in which the oldest diplomatists often fail.\"\n\n\"My lord, I am twenty-three years of age; but your eminence is mistaken\nin saying that I am young. I am older than your eminence, although\nI possess not your wisdom. Years of suffering, in my opinion, count\ndouble, and I have suffered for twenty years.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I understand,\" said Mazarin; \"want of fortune, perhaps.\nYou are poor, are you not?\" Then he added to himself: \"These English\nRevolutionists are all beggars and ill-bred.\"\n\n\"My lord, I ought to have a fortune of six millions, but it has been\ntaken from me.\"\n\n\"You are not, then, a man of the people?\" said Mazarin, astonished.\n\n\"If I bore my proper title I should be a lord. If I bore my name you\nwould have heard one of the most illustrious names of England.\"\n\n\"What is your name, then?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"My name is Mordaunt,\" replied the young man, bowing.\n\nMazarin now understood that Cromwell's envoy desired to retain his\nincognito. He was silent for an instant, and during that time he scanned\nthe young man even more attentively than he had done at first. The\nmessenger was unmoved.\n\n\"Devil take these Puritans,\" said Mazarin aside; \"they are carved from\ngranite.\" Then he added aloud, \"But you have relations left you?\"\n\n\"I have one remaining. Three times I presented myself to ask his support\nand three times he ordered his servants to turn me away.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! my dear Mr. Mordaunt,\" said Mazarin, hoping by a display\nof affected pity to catch the young man in a snare, \"how extremely your\nhistory interests me! You know not, then, anything of your birth--you\nhave never seen your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; she came three times, whilst I was a child, to my nurse's\nhouse; I remember the last time she came as well as if it were to-day.\"\n\n\"You have a good memory,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Oh! yes, my lord,\" said the young man, with such peculiar emphasis that\nthe cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein.\n\n\"And who brought you up?\" he asked again.\n\n\"A French nurse, who sent me away when I was five years old because no\none paid her for me, telling me the name of a relation of whom she had\nheard my mother often speak.\"\n\n\"What became of you?\"\n\n\"As I was weeping and begging on the high road, a minister from Kingston\ntook me in, instructed me in the Calvinistic faith, taught me all he\nknew himself and aided me in my researches after my family.\"\n\n\"And these researches?\"\n\n\"Were fruitless; chance did everything.\"\n\n\"You discovered what had become of your mother?\"\n\n\"I learned that she had been assassinated by my relation, aided by four\nfriends, but I was already aware that I had been robbed of my wealth and\ndegraded from my nobility by King Charles I.\"\n\n\"Oh! I now understand why you are in the service of Cromwell; you hate\nthe king.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I hate him!\" said the young man.\n\nMazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the\nyoung man uttered these words. Just as, ordinarily, faces are colored by\nblood, his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid.\n\n\"Your history is a terrible one, Mr. Mordaunt, and touches me keenly;\nbut happily for you, you serve an all-powerful master; he ought to aid\nyou in your search; we have so many means of gaining information.\"\n\n\"My lord, to a well-bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a\ntrack; he is certain to reach the other.\"\n\n\"But this relation you mentioned--do you wish me to speak to him?\" said\nMazarin, who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwell's person.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord, I will speak to him myself. He will treat me better\nthe next time I see him.\"\n\n\"You have the means, then, of touching him?\"\n\n\"I have the means of making myself feared.\"\n\nMazarin looked at the young man, but at the fire which shot from his\nglance he bent his head; then, embarrassed how to continue such a\nconversation, he opened Cromwell's letter.\n\nThe young man's eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance\nand he fell into a profound reverie. After reading the first lines of\nthe letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching\nthe expression of his face as he read. Observing his indifference, he\nshrugged his shoulders, saying:\n\n\"Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time! Let us see\nwhat this letter contains.\"\n\nWe here present the letter verbatim:\n\n\n\n\"To his Eminence, Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini:\n\n\"I have wished, monseigneur, to learn your intentions relating to the\nexisting state of affairs in England. The two kingdoms are so near that\nFrance must be interested in our situation, as we are interested in that\nof France. The English are almost of one mind in contending against the\ntyranny of Charles and his adherents. Placed by popular confidence at\nthe head of that movement, I can appreciate better than any other its\nsignificance and its probable results. I am at present in the midst of\nwar, and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles. I\nshall gain it, for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are\nwith me. This battle won by me, the king will have no further resources\nin England or in Scotland; and if he is not captured or killed, he will\nendeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish\nhimself with arms and money. France has already received Queen\nHenrietta, and, unintentionally, doubtless, has maintained a centre\nof inextinguishable civil war in my country. But Madame Henrietta is a\ndaughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France. As to\nKing Charles, the question must be viewed differently; in receiving and\naiding him, France will censure the acts of the English nation, and\nthus so essentially harm England, and especially the well-being of the\ngovernment, that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced\nhostilities.\"\n\n\n\nAt this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter\nwas taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man. The\nlatter continued in thought. Mazarin resumed his reading:\n\n\n\n\"It is important, therefore, monseigneur, that I should be informed as\nto the intentions of France. The interests of that kingdom and those of\nEngland, though taking now diverse directions, are very nearly the same.\nEngland needs tranquillity at home, in order to consummate the expulsion\nof her king; France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations\nthe throne of her young monarch. You need, as much as we do, that\ninterior condition of repose which, thanks to the energy of our\ngovernment, we are about to attain.\n\n\"Your quarrels with the parliament, your noisy dissensions with the\nprinces, who fight for you to-day and to-morrow will fight against you,\nthe popular following directed by the coadjutor, President Blancmesnil,\nand Councillor Broussel--all that disorder, in short, which pervades the\nseveral departments of the state, must lead you to view with uneasiness\nthe possibility of a foreign war; for in that event England, exalted\nby the enthusiasm of new ideas, will ally herself with Spain, already\nseeking that alliance. I have therefore believed, monseigneur, knowing\nyour prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present\ntime, that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the\ninterior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government\nof England. That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles\nfrom the territory of France and in refraining from helping him--a\nstranger to your country--with arms, with money or with troops.\n\n\"My letter is private and confidential, and for that reason I send it\nto you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels. It anticipates,\nthrough a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate, measures to be\ntaken after the events. Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to\ndeclare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarin's than to a queen\nadmirable for firmness, without doubt, but too much guided by vain\nprejudices of birth and of divine right.\n\n\"Farewell, monseigneur; should I not receive a reply in the space of\nfifteen days, I shall presume my letter will have miscarried.\n\n\"Oliver Cromwell.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Mordaunt,\" said the cardinal, raising his voice, as if to arouse\nthe dreamer, \"my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to\nGeneral Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having\ngiven one; go, therefore, and await it at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and promise\nme to set out to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I promise, my lord,\" replied Mordaunt; \"but how many days does your\neminence expect me to await your reply?\"\n\n\"If you do not receive it in ten days you can leave.\"\n\nMordaunt bowed.\n\n\"That is not all, sir,\" continued Mazarin; \"your private adventures have\ntouched me to the quick; besides, the letter from Mr. Cromwell makes\nyou an important person as ambassador; come, tell me, what can I do for\nyou?\"\n\nMordaunt reflected a moment and, after some hesitation, was about to\nspeak, when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the\ncardinal, whispered:\n\n\"My lord, the Queen Henrietta Maria, accompanied by an English noble, is\nentering the Palais Royal at this moment.\"\n\nMazarin made a bound from his chair, which did not escape the attention\nof the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the cardinal, \"you have heard me? I fix on Boulogne because\nI presume that every town in France is indifferent to you; if you prefer\nanother, name it; but you can easily conceive that, surrounded as I am\nby influences I can only muzzle by discretion, I desire your presence in\nParis to be unknown.\"\n\n\"I go, sir,\" said Mordaunt, advancing a few steps to the door by which\nhe had entered.\n\n\"No, not that way, I beg, sir,\" quickly exclaimed the cardinal, \"be so\ngood as to pass by yonder gallery, by which you can regain the hall. I\ndo not wish you to be seen leaving; our interview must be kept secret.\"\n\nMordaunt followed Bernouin, who led him through the adjacent chamber and\nleft him with a doorkeeper, showing him the way out.\n\n\n\n\n38. Henrietta Maria and Mazarin.\n\n\n\nThe cardinal rose, and advanced in haste to receive the queen of\nEngland. He showed the more respect to this queen, deprived of every\nmark of pomp and stripped of followers, as he felt some self-reproach\nfor his own want of heart and his avarice. But supplicants for favor\nknow how to accommodate the expression of their features, and the\ndaughter of Henry IV. smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and\ndespised.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mazarin to himself, \"what a sweet face; does she come to\nborrow money of me?\"\n\nAnd he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box; he even turned inside\nthe bevel of the magnificent diamond ring, the brilliancy of which drew\nevery eye upon his hand, which indeed was white and handsome.\n\n\"Your eminence,\" said the august visitor, \"it was my first intention to\nspeak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen, my sister,\nbut I have reflected that political affairs are more especially the\nconcern of men.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Mazarin, \"your majesty overwhelms me with flattering\ndistinction.\"\n\n\"He is very gracious,\" thought the queen; \"can he have guessed my\nerrand?\"\n\n\"Give,\" continued the cardinal, \"your commands to the most respectful of\nyour servants.\"\n\n\"Alas, sir,\" replied the queen, \"I have lost the habit of commanding\nand have adopted instead that of making petitions. I am here to petition\nyou, too happy should my prayer be favorably heard.\"\n\n\"I am listening, madame, with the greatest interest,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Your eminence, it concerns the war which the king, my husband, is now\nsustaining against his rebellious subjects. You are perhaps ignorant\nthat they are fighting in England,\" added she, with a melancholy smile,\n\"and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion\nthan they have done hitherto.\"\n\n\"I am completely ignorant of it, madame,\" said the cardinal,\naccompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders; \"alas, our\nown wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor, incapable, infirm\nold minister like me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, your eminence,\" said the queen, \"I must inform you that\nCharles I., my husband, is on the eve of a decisive engagement. In\ncase of a check\" (Mazarin made a slight movement), \"one must foresee\neverything; in the case of a check, he desires to retire into France and\nto live here as a private individual. What do you say to this project?\"\n\nThe cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face\nto betray what he felt, and his smile remained as it ever was--false and\nflattering; and when the queen finished speaking, he said:\n\n\"Do you think, madame, that France, agitated and disturbed as it is,\nwould be a safe retreat for a dethroned king? How will the crown,\nwhich is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV., support a double\nweight?\"\n\n\"The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril,\" interrupted the\nqueen, with a sad smile, \"and I ask no more for my husband than has been\ndone for me; you see that we are very humble monarchs, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, you, madame,\" the cardinal hastened to say, in order to cut short\nthe explanation he foresaw was coming, \"with regard to you, that is\nanother thing. A daughter of Henry IV., of that great, that sublime\nsovereign----\"\n\n\"All which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son-in-law,\nsir! Nevertheless, you ought to remember that that great, that sublime\nmonarch, when proscribed at one time, as my husband may be, demanded aid\nfrom England and England accorded it to him; and it is but just to say\nthat Queen Elizabeth was not his niece.\"\n\n\"Peccato!\" said Mazarin, writhing beneath this simple eloquence, \"your\nmajesty does not understand me; you judge my intentions wrongly, and\nthat is partly because, doubtless, I explain myself in French.\"\n\n\"Speak Italian, sir. Ere the cardinal, your predecessor, sent our\nmother, Marie de Medicis, to die in exile, she taught us that language.\nIf anything yet remains of that great, that sublime king, Henry, of whom\nyou have just spoken, he would be much surprised at so little pity for\nhis family being united to such a profound admiration of himself.\"\n\nThe perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarin's brow.\n\n\"That admiration is, on the contrary, so great, so real, madame,\"\nreturned Mazarin, without noticing the change of language offered to him\nby the queen, \"that if the king, Charles I.--whom Heaven protect from\nevil!--came into France, I would offer him my house--my own house; but,\nalas! it would be but an unsafe retreat. Some day the people will burn\nthat house, as they burned that of the Marechal d'Ancre. Poor Concino\nConcini! And yet he but desired the good of the people.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, like yourself!\" said the queen, ironically.\n\nMazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own\nsentence, but continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini.\n\n\"Well then, your eminence,\" said the queen, becoming impatient, \"what is\nyour answer?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" cried Mazarin, more and more moved, \"will your majesty permit\nme to give you counsel?\"\n\n\"Speak, sir,\" replied the queen; \"the counsels of so prudent a man as\nyourself ought certainly to be available.\"\n\n\"Madame, believe me, the king ought to defend himself to the last.\"\n\n\"He has done so, sir, and this last battle, which he encounters with\nresources much inferior to those of the enemy, proves that he will not\nyield without a struggle; but in case he is beaten?\"\n\n\"Well, madame, in that case, my advice--I know that I am very bold to\noffer advice to your majesty--my advice is that the king should not\nleave his kingdom. Absent kings are very soon forgotten; if he passes\nover into France his cause is lost.\"\n\n\"But,\" persisted the queen, \"if such be your advice and you have his\ninterest at heart, send him help of men and money, for I can do nothing\nfor him; I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him. If I had had\na single ornament left, I should have bought wood this winter to make a\nfire for my daughter and myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, madame,\" said Mazarin, \"your majesty knows not what you ask. On the\nday when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him\non his throne, it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and\nlove of his own subjects.\"\n\n\"To the point, sir,\" said the queen, \"to the point, and answer me, yes\nor no; if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him\nsuccor? If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality? What do\nyou intend to do? Speak.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the cardinal, affecting an effusive frankness of speech,\n\"I shall convince your majesty, I trust, of my devotion to you and my\ndesire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart. After\nwhich your majesty will, I think, no longer doubt my zeal in your\nbehalf.\"\n\nThe queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair.\n\n\"Well, what do you propose to do?\" she, said at length; \"come, speak.\"\n\n\"I will go this instant and consult the queen, and we will refer the\naffair at once to parliament.\"\n\n\"With which you are at war--is it not so? You will charge Broussel to\nreport it. Enough, sir, enough. I understand you or rather, I am wrong.\nGo to the parliament, for it was from this parliament, the enemy of\nmonarchs, that the daughter of the great, the sublime Henry IV., whom\nyou so much admire, received the only relief this winter which prevented\nher from dying of hunger and cold!\"\n\nAnd with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation, whilst the\ncardinal, raising his hands clasped toward her, exclaimed, \"Ah, madame,\nmadame, how little you know me, mon Dieu!\"\n\nBut Queen Henrietta, without even turning toward him who made these\nhypocritical pretensions, crossed the cabinet, opened the door for\nherself and passing through the midst of the cardinal's numerous\nguards, courtiers eager to pay homage, the luxurious show of a competing\nroyalty, she went and took the hand of De Winter, who stood apart in\nisolation. Poor queen, already fallen! Though all bowed before her,\nas etiquette required, she had now but a single arm on which she could\nlean.\n\n\"It signifies little,\" said Mazarin, when he was alone. \"It gave me pain\nand it was an ungracious part to play, but I have said nothing either to\nthe one or to the other. Bernouin!\"\n\nBernouin entered.\n\n\"See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair, who was\nwith me just now, is still in the palace.\"\n\nBernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges, who was on guard.\n\n\"Your eminence,\" said Comminges, \"as I was re-conducting the young man\nfor whom you have asked, he approached the glass door of the gallery,\nand gazed intently upon some object, doubtless the picture by Raphael,\nwhich is opposite the door. He reflected for a second and then descended\nthe stairs. I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace\ncourt. But is not your eminence going to the queen?\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Guitant, my uncle, has just told me that her majesty had\nreceived news of the army.\"\n\n\"It is well; I will go.\"\n\nComminges had seen rightly, and Mordaunt had really acted as he had\nrelated. In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery,\nhe perceived De Winter, who was waiting until the queen had finished her\nnegotiation.\n\nAt this sight the young man stopped short, not in admiration of\nRaphael's picture, but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible\nobject. His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body. One would\nhave said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which\nseparated him from his enemy; for if Comminges had seen with what an\nexpression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De\nWinter, he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was\nhis eternal foe.\n\nBut he stopped, doubtless to reflect; for instead of allowing his first\nimpulse, which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter, to carry him\naway, he leisurely descended the staircase, left the palace with his\nhead down, mounted his horse, which he reined in at the corner of the\nRue Richelieu, and with his eyes fixed on the gate, waited until the\nqueen's carriage had left the court.\n\nHe had not long to wait, for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an\nhour with Mazarin, but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a\ncentury to him. At last the heavy machine, which was called a chariot in\nthose days, came out, rumbling against the gates, and De Winter, still\non horseback, bent again to the door to converse with her majesty.\n\nThe horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre, which they\nentered. Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites, Henrietta\nhad desired her daughter to attend her at the palace, which she had\ninhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their\npoverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers.\n\nMordaunt followed the carriage, and when he had watched it drive beneath\nthe sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which\nthe shadow was extended, and remained motionless, amidst the moldings of\nJean Goujon, like a bas-relievo, representing an equestrian statue.\n\n\n\n\n39. How, sometimes, the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence.\n\n\n\n\"Well, madame,\" said De Winter, when the queen had dismissed her\nattendants.\n\n\"Well, my lord, what I foresaw has come to pass.\"\n\n\"What? does the cardinal refuse to receive the king? France refuse\nhospitality to an unfortunate prince? Ay, but it is for the first time,\nmadame!\"\n\n\"I did not say France, my lord; I said the cardinal, and the cardinal is\nnot even a Frenchman.\"\n\n\"But did you see the queen?\"\n\n\"It is useless,\" replied Henrietta, \"the queen will not say yes when\nthe cardinal says no. Are you not aware that this Italian directs\neverything, both indoors and out? And moreover, I should not be\nsurprised had we been forestalled by Cromwell. He was embarrassed whilst\nspeaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse. Then\ndid you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal, the passing to\nand fro of busy people? Can they have received any news, my lord?\"\n\n\"Not from England, madame. I made such haste that I am certain of not\nhaving been forestalled. I set out three days ago, passing miraculously\nthrough the Puritan army, and I took post horses with my servant Tony;\nthe horses upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris. Besides,\nthe king, I am certain, awaits your majesty's reply before risking\nanything.\"\n\n\"You will tell him, my lord,\" resumed the queen, despairingly, \"that I\ncan do nothing; that I have suffered as much as himself--more than he\nhas--obliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality\nfrom false friends who smile at my tears; and as regards his royal\nperson, he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king. I shall go\nand die by his side.\"\n\n\"Madame, madame,\" exclaimed De Winter, \"your majesty abandons yourself\nto despair; and yet, perhaps, there still remains some hope.\"\n\n\"No friends left, my lord; no other friends left in the wide world\nbut yourself! Oh, God!\" exclaimed the poor queen, raising her eyes to\nHeaven, \"have You indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once\nexisted in the world?\"\n\n\"I hope not, madame,\" replied De Winter, thoughtfully; \"I once spoke to\nyou of four men.\"\n\n\"What can be done with four?\"\n\n\"Four devoted, resolute men can do much, assure yourself, madame; and\nthose of whom I speak performed great things at one time.\"\n\n\"And where are these four men?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is what I do not know. It is twenty years since I saw them,\nand yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of them.\"\n\n\"And these men were your friends?\"\n\n\"One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me. I know not\nwhether he is still my friend, but since that time I have remained his.\"\n\n\"And these men are in France, my lord?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"Tell me their names; perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might\nbe able to aid you in finding them.\"\n\n\"One of them was called the Chevalier d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord, if I mistake not, the Chevalier d'Artagnan is lieutenant\nof royal guards; but take care, for I fear that this man is entirely\ndevoted to the cardinal.\"\n\n\"That would be a misfortune,\" said De Winter, \"and I shall begin to\nthink that we are really doomed.\"\n\n\"But the others,\" said the queen, who clung to this last hope as a\nshipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel. \"The others, my lord!\"\n\n\"The second--I heard his name by chance; for before fighting us, these\nfour gentlemen told us their names; the second was called the Comte de\nla Fere. As for the two others, I had so much the habit of calling them\nby nicknames that I have forgotten their real ones.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu, it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out,\"\nsaid the queen, \"since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so\nuseful to the king.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said De Winter, \"for they are the same men. Listen, madame,\nand recall your remembrances. Have you never heard that Queen Anne\nof Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a\nqueen?\"\n\n\"Yes, at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham; it had\nto do in some way with certain studs and diamonds.\"\n\n\"Well, it was that affair, madame; these men are the ones who saved\nher; and I smile with pity when I reflect that if the names of those\ngentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them,\nwho ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my lord, they must be found; but what can four men, or\nrather three men do--for I tell you, you must not count on Monsieur\nd'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"It will be one valiant sword the less, but there will remain still\nthree, without reckoning my own; now four devoted men around the king\nto protect him from his enemies, to be at his side in battle, to aid him\nwith counsel, to escort him in flight, are sufficient, not to make the\nking a conqueror, but to save him if conquered; and whatever Mazarin may\nsay, once on the shores of France your royal husband may find as many\nretreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm.\"\n\n\"Seek, then, my lord, seek these gentlemen; and if they will consent\nto go with you to England, I will give to each a duchy the day that we\nreascend the throne, besides as much gold as would pave Whitehall. Seek\nthem, my lord, and find them, I conjure you.\"\n\n\"I will search for them, madame,\" said De Winter \"and doubtless I shall\nfind them; but time fails me. Has your majesty forgotten that the king\nexpects your reply and awaits it in agony?\"\n\n\"Then indeed we are lost!\" cried the queen, in the fullness of a broken\nheart.\n\nAt this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared; then\nthe queen, with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of\nparents, repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the\nsubject.\n\nBut that act of self-control, effective as it was, did not escape the\neyes of the young princess. She stopped on the threshold, breathed a\nsigh, and addressing the queen:\n\n\"Why, then, do you always weep, mother, when I am away from you?\" she\nsaid.\n\nThe queen smiled, but instead of answering:\n\n\"See, De Winter,\" she said, \"I have at least gained one thing in being\nonly half a queen; and that is that my children call me 'mother' instead\nof 'madame.'\"\n\nThen turning toward her daughter:\n\n\"What do you want, Henrietta?\" she demanded.\n\n\"My mother,\" replied the young princess, \"a cavalier has just entered\nthe Louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty; he\narrives from the army and has, he says, a letter to remit to you, on the\npart of the Marechal de Grammont, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the queen to De Winter, \"he is one of my faithful adherents;\nbut do you not observe, my dear lord, that we are so poorly served that\nit is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper?\"\n\n\"Madame, have pity on me,\" exclaimed De Winter; \"you wring my heart!\"\n\n\"And who is this cavalier, Henrietta?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"I saw him from the window, madame; he is a young man that appears\nscarce sixteen years of age, and is called the Viscount de Bragelonne.\"\n\nThe queen, smiling, made a sign with her head; the young princess opened\nthe door and Raoul appeared on the threshold.\n\nAdvancing a few steps toward the queen, he knelt down.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the\nCount de Guiche, who told me he had the honor of being your servant;\nthis letter contains important news and the expression of his respect.\"\n\nAt the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of\nthe young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of\nseverity.\n\n\"You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont,\nHenrietta!\" said the queen.\n\n\"I thought so, madame,\" stammered the young girl.\n\n\"It is my fault, madame,\" said Raoul. \"I did announce myself, in truth,\nas coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont; but being wounded in\nthe right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche\nacted as his secretary.\"\n\n\"There has been fighting, then?\" asked the queen, motioning to Raoul to\nrise.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said the young man.\n\nAt this announcement of a battle having taken place, the princess opened\nher mouth as though to ask a question of interest; but her lips closed\nagain without articulating a word, while the color gradually faded from\nher cheeks.\n\nThe queen saw this, and doubtless her maternal heart translated the\nemotion, for addressing Raoul again:\n\n\"And no evil has happened to the young Count de Guiche?\" she asked; \"for\nnot only is he our servant, as you say, sir, but more--he is one of our\nfriends.\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied Raoul; \"on the contrary, he gained great glory\nand had the honor of being embraced by his highness, the prince, on the\nfield of battle.\"\n\nThe young princess clapped her hands; and then, ashamed of having been\nbetrayed into such a demonstration of joy, she half turned away and bent\nover a vase of roses, as if to inhale their odor.\n\n\"Let us see,\" said the queen, \"what the count says.\" And she opened the\nletter and read:\n\n\n\n\"Madame,--Being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself, by\nreason of a wound I have received in my right hand, I have commanded my\nson, the Count de Guiche, who, with his father, is equally your humble\nservant, to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of\nLens, and that this victory cannot fail to give great power to Cardinal\nMazarin and to the queen over the affairs of Europe. If her majesty will\nhave faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address\nat this moment, in favor of her august husband, the court of France. The\nVicomte de Bragelonne, who will have the honor of remitting this letter\nto your majesty, is the friend of my son, who owes to him his life; he\nis a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely, in case your\nmajesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me.\n\n\"I have the honor to be, with respect, etc.,\n\n\"Marechal de Grammont.\"\n\n\n\nAt the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to\nthe count, Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young\nprincess, and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite\ngratitude to the young man; he no longer doubted that the daughter of\nKing Charles I. loved his friend.\n\n\"The battle of Lens gained!\" said the queen; \"they are lucky here\nindeed; they can gain battles! Yes, the Marechal de Grammont is right;\nthis will change the aspect of French affairs, but I much fear it will\ndo nothing for English, even if it does not harm them. This is recent\nnews, sir,\" continued she, \"and I thank you for having made such haste\nto bring it to me; without this letter I should not have heard till\nto-morrow, perhaps after to-morrow--the last of all Paris.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Raoul, \"the Louvre is but the second palace this news has\nreached; it is as yet unknown to all, and I had sworn to the Count de\nGuiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace\nmy guardian.\"\n\n\"Your guardian! is he, too, a Bragelonne?\" asked Lord de Winter. \"I once\nknew a Bragelonne--is he still alive?\"\n\n\"No, sir, he is dead; and I believe it is from him my guardian, whose\nnear relation he was, inherited the estate from which I take my name.\"\n\n\"And your guardian, sir,\" asked the queen, who could not help feeling\nsome interest in the handsome young man before her, \"what is his name?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere, madame,\" replied the young man, bowing.\n\nDe Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a\nstart of joy.\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere!\" she cried. \"Have you not mentioned that name to\nme?\"\n\nAs for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright.\n\"The Comte de la Fere!\" he cried in his turn. \"Oh, sir, reply, I entreat\nyou--is not the Comte de la Fere a noble whom I remember, handsome and\nbrave, a musketeer under Louis XIII., who must be now about forty-seven\nor forty-eight years of age?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you are right in every particular!\"\n\n\"And who served under an assumed name?\"\n\n\"Under the name of Athos. Latterly I heard his friend, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan, give him that name.\"\n\n\"That is it, madame, that is the same. God be praised! And he is in\nParis?\" continued he, addressing Raoul; then turning to the queen: \"We\nmay still hope. Providence has declared for us, since I have found\nthis brave man again in so miraculous a manner. And, sir, where does he\nreside, pray?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud, Hotel du Grand Roi\nCharlemagne.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sir. Inform this dear friend that he may remain within, that I\nshall go and see him immediately.\"\n\n\"Sir, I obey with pleasure, if her majesty will permit me to depart.\"\n\n\"Go, Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" said the queen, \"and rest assured of our\naffection.\"\n\nRaoul bent respectfully before the two princesses, and bowing to De\nWinter, departed.\n\nThe queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low\nvoices, in order that the young princess should not overhear them;\nbut the precaution was needless: she was in deep converse with her own\nthoughts.\n\nThen, when De Winter rose to take leave:\n\n\"Listen, my lord,\" said the queen; \"I have preserved this diamond cross\nwhich came from my mother, and this order of St. Michael which came from\nmy husband. They are worth about fifty thousand pounds. I had sworn to\ndie of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges; but now that\nthis ornament may be useful to him or his defenders, everything must be\nsacrificed. Take them, and if you need money for your expedition, sell\nthem fearlessly, my lord. But should you find the means of retaining\nthem, remember, my lord, that I shall esteem you as having rendered the\ngreatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen; and in the day\nof my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be\nblessed by me and my children.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied De Winter, \"your majesty will be served by a man\ndevoted to you. I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place,\nnor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune\nwere left to us, but our estates are confiscated, our ready money is\nexhausted, and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess.\nIn an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere, and to-morrow\nyour majesty shall have a definite reply.\"\n\nThe queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter, who, kissing it\nrespectfully, went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large,\ndark and deserted apartments, brushing away tears which, blase as he\nwas by fifty years spent as a courtier, he could not withhold at the\nspectacle of royal distress so dignified, yet so intense.\n\n\n\n\n40. Uncle and Nephew.\n\n\n\nThe horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the\ndoor; he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully, looking behind\nhim from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the\nLouvre. It was then that he saw a horseman, as it were, detach himself\nfrom the wall and follow him at a little distance. In leaving the Palais\nRoyal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow.\n\n\"Tony,\" he said, motioning to his groom to approach.\n\n\"Here I am, my lord.\"\n\n\"Did you remark that man who is following us?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"I do not know, only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal,\nstopped at the Louvre to wait for you, and now leaves the Louvre with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Some spy of the cardinal,\" said De Winter to him, aside. \"Let us\npretend not to notice that he is watching us.\"\n\nAnd spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to\nhis hotel, situated near the Marais, for having for so long a time lived\nnear the Place Royale, Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near\nhis ancient dwelling.\n\nThe unknown spurred his horse to a gallop.\n\nDe Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment,\nintending to watch the spy; but as he was about to place his gloves and\nhat on a table, he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure\nwhich stood on the threshold of the room. He turned around and Mordaunt\nstood before him.\n\nThere was a moment of frozen silence between these two.\n\n\"Sir,\" said De Winter, \"I thought I had already made you aware that I am\nweary of this persecution; withdraw, then, or I shall call and have you\nturned out as you were in London. I am not your uncle, I know you not.\"\n\n\"My uncle,\" replied Mordaunt, with his harsh and bantering tone, \"you\nare mistaken; you will not have me turned out this time as you did in\nLondon--you dare not. As for denying that I am your nephew, you will\nthink twice about it, now that I have learned some things of which I was\nignorant a year ago.\"\n\n\"And how does it concern me what you have learned?\" said De Winter.\n\n\"Oh, it concerns you very closely, my uncle, I am sure, and you will\nsoon be of my opinion,\" added he, with a smile which sent a shudder\nthrough the veins of him he thus addressed. \"When I presented myself\nbefore you for the first time in London, it was to ask you what had\nbecome of my fortune; the second time it was to demand who had sullied\nmy name; and this time I come before you to ask a question far more\nterrible than any other, to say to you as God said to the first\nmurderer: 'Cain, what hast thou done to thy brother Abel?' My lord, what\nhave you done with your sister--your sister, who was my mother?\"\n\nDe Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes.\n\n\"Your mother?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, my mother,\" replied the young man, advancing into the\nroom until he was face to face with Lord de Winter, and crossing his\narms. \"I have asked the headsman of Bethune,\" he said, his voice hoarse\nand his face livid with passion and grief. \"And the headsman of Bethune\ngave me a reply.\"\n\nDe Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in\nvain attempted a reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the young man; \"all is now explained; with this key I\nopen the abyss. My mother inherited an estate from her husband, you have\nassassinated her; my name would have secured me the paternal estate,\nyou have deprived me of it; you have despoiled me of my fortune. I am\nno longer astonished that you knew me not. I am not surprised that you\nrefused to recognize me. When a man is a robber it is hard to call him\nnephew whom he has impoverished; when one is a murderer, to recognize\nthe man whom one has made an orphan.\"\n\nThese words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had\nanticipated. De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been; he\nrose, dignified and calm, restraining by the severity of his look the\nwild glance of the young man.\n\n\"You desire to fathom this horrible secret?\" said De Winter; \"well,\nthen, so be it. Know, then, what manner of woman it was for whom to-day\nyou call me to account. That woman had, in all probability, poisoned my\nbrother, and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me\nin my turn. I have proof of it. What say you to that?\"\n\n\"I say that she was my mother.\"\n\n\"She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man\nwho was, ere that, honest, good and pure. What say you to that crime, of\nwhich I have the proof?\"\n\n\"She was my mother.\"\n\n\"On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one\nof her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune.\nWill this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment--for of\nall this I have the proofs?\"\n\n\"She was my mother!\" cried the young man, who uttered these three\nsuccessive exclamations with constantly increasing force.\n\n\"At last, charged with murders, with debauchery, hated by every one\nand yet threatening still, like a panther thirsting for blood, she fell\nunder the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate, though they had\nnever done her the least injury; she met with judges whom her hideous\ncrimes had evoked; and that executioner you saw--that executioner\nwho you say told you everything--that executioner, if he told you\neverything, told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his\nbrother's shame and suicide. Depraved as a girl, adulterous as a wife,\nan unnatural sister, homicide, poisoner, execrated by all who knew\nher, by every nation that had been visited by her, she died accursed by\nHeaven and earth.\"\n\nA sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his\nlivid face became suffused with blood; he clenched his fists, sweat\ncovered his face, his hair, like Hamlet's, stood on end, and racked with\nfury he cried out:\n\n\"Silence, sir! she was my mother! Her crimes, I know them not; her\ndisorders, I know them not; her vices, I know them not. But this I know,\nthat I had a mother, that five men leagued against one woman, murdered\nher clandestinely by night--silently--like cowards. I know that you were\none of them, my uncle, and that you cried louder than the others: 'She\nmust die.' Therefore I warn you, and listen well to my words, that they\nmay be engraved upon your memory, never to be forgotten: this murder,\nwhich has robbed me of everything--this murder, which has deprived me of\nmy name--this murder, which has impoverished me--this murder, which has\nmade me corrupt, wicked, implacable--I shall summon you to account\nfor it first and then those who were your accomplices, when I discover\nthem!\"\n\nWith hatred in his eyes, foaming at his mouth, and his fist extended,\nMordaunt had advanced one more step, a threatening, terrible step,\ntoward De Winter. The latter put his hand to his sword, and said, with\nthe smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death:\n\n\"Would you assassinate me, sir? Then I shall recognize you as my nephew,\nfor you would be a worthy son of such a mother.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mordaunt, forcing his features and the muscles of his body\nto resume their usual places and be calm; \"no, I shall not kill you;\nat least not at this moment, for without you I could not discover the\nothers. But when I have found them, then tremble, sir. I stabbed to the\nheart the headsman of Bethune, without mercy or pity, and he was the\nleast guilty of you all.\"\n\nWith these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with\nsufficient calmness to pass unobserved; then upon the lowest landing\nplace he passed Tony, leaning over the balustrade, waiting only for a\ncall from his master to mount to his room.\n\nBut De Winter did not call; crushed, enfeebled, he remained standing and\nwith listening ear; then only when he had heard the step of the horse\ngoing away he fell back on a chair, saying:\n\n\"My God, I thank Thee that he knows me only.\"\n\n\n\n\n41. Paternal Affection.\n\n\n\nWhilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winter's, Athos,\nseated near his window, his elbow on the table and his head supported on\nhis hand, was listening intently to Raoul's account of the adventures he\nmet with on his journey and the details of the battle.\n\nListening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure, the fine,\nnoble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure; he inhaled the\ntones of that young voice, as harmonious music. He forgot all that was\ndark in the past and that was cloudy in the future. It almost seemed\nas if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes.\nAthos was happy--happy as he had never been before.\n\n\"And you assisted and took part in this great battle, Bragelonne!\" cried\nthe former musketeer.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And it was a fierce one?\"\n\n\"His highness the prince charged eleven times in person.\"\n\n\"He is a great commander, Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"He is a hero, sir. I did not lose sight of him for an instant. Oh! how\nfine it is to be called Conde and to be so worthy of such a name!\"\n\n\"He was calm and radiant, was he not?\"\n\n\"As calm as at parade, radiant as at a fete. When we went up to the\nenemy it was slowly; we were forbidden to draw first and we were\nmarching toward the Spaniards, who were on a height with lowered\nmuskets. When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned\naround to the soldiers: 'Comrades,' he said, 'you are about to suffer\na furious discharge; but after that you will make short work with those\nfellows.' There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could\nhave heard these words; then raising his sword, 'Sound trumpets!' he\ncried.\"\n\n\"Well, very good; you will do as much when the opportunity occurs, will\nyou, Raoul?\"\n\n\"I know not, sir, but I thought it really very fine and grand!\"\n\n\"Were you afraid, Raoul?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the young man naively; \"I felt a great chill at\nmy heart, and at the word 'fire,' which resounded in Spanish from the\nenemy's ranks, I closed my eyes and thought of you.\"\n\n\"In honest truth, Raoul?\" said Athos, pressing his hand.\n\n\"Yes, sir; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that\none might have imagined the infernal regions had opened. Those who were\nnot killed felt the heat of the flames. I opened my eyes, astonished to\nfind myself alive and even unhurt; a third of the squadron were lying on\nthe ground, wounded, dead or dying. At that moment I encountered the eye\nof the prince. I had but one thought and that was that he was observing\nme. I spurred on and found myself in the enemy's ranks.\"\n\n\"And the prince was pleased with you?\"\n\n\"He told me so, at least, sir, when he desired me to return to Paris\nwith Monsieur de Chatillon, who was charged to carry the news to the\nqueen and to bring the colors we had taken. 'Go,' said he; 'the enemy\nwill not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of\nyour service. Go and see those whom you love and who love you, and tell\nmy sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made\nme of you.' And I came, sir,\" added Raoul, gazing at the count with\na smile of real affection, \"for I thought you would be glad to see me\nagain.\"\n\nAthos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow, as\nhe would have done to a young daughter.\n\n\"And now, Raoul,\" said he, \"you are launched; you have dukes for\nfriends, a marshal of France for godfather, a prince of the blood as\ncommander, and on the day of your return you have been received by two\nqueens; it is not so bad for a novice.\"\n\n\"Oh sir,\" said Raoul, suddenly, \"you recall something, which, in my\nhaste to relate my exploits, I had forgotten; it is that there was with\nHer Majesty the Queen of England, a gentleman who, when I pronounced\nyour name, uttered a cry of surprise and joy; he said he was a friend of\nyours, asked your address, and is coming to see you.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"I did not venture to ask, sir; he spoke elegantly, although I thought\nfrom his accent he was an Englishman.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Athos, leaning down his head as if to remember who it could\nbe. Then, when he raised it again, he was struck by the presence of\na man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a\ncompassionate air.\n\n\"Lord de Winter!\" exclaimed the count.\n\n\"Athos, my friend!\"\n\nAnd the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other's arms;\nthen Athos, looking into his friend's face and taking him by both hands,\nsaid:\n\n\"What ails you, my lord? you appear as unhappy as I am the reverse.\"\n\n\"Yes, truly, dear friend; and I may even say the sight of you increases\nmy dismay.\"\n\nAnd De Winter glancing around him, Raoul quickly understood that the two\nfriends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly.\n\n\"Come, now that we are alone,\" said Athos, \"let us talk of yourself.\"\n\n\"Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves,\" replied De Winter. \"He\nis here.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Milady's son.\"\n\nAthos, again struck by this name, which seemed to pursue him like an\necho, hesitated for a moment, then slightly knitting his brows, he\ncalmly said:\n\n\"I know it, Grimaud met him between Bethune and Arras and then came here\nto warn me of his presence.\"\n\n\"Does Grimaud know him, then?\"\n\n\"No; but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him.\"\n\n\"The headsman of Bethune?\" exclaimed De Winter.\n\n\"You know about that?\" cried Athos, astonished.\n\n\"He has just left me,\" replied De Winter, \"after telling me all. Ah! my\nfriend! what a horrible scene! Why did we not destroy the child with the\nmother?\"\n\n\"What need you fear?\" said Athos, recovering from the instinctive fear\nhe had at first experienced, by the aid of reason; \"are we not men\naccustomed to defend ourselves? Is this young man an assassin by\nprofession--a murderer in cold blood? He has killed the executioner of\nBethune in an access of passion, but now his fury is assuaged.\"\n\nDe Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head.\n\n\"Do you not know the race?\" said he.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Athos, trying to smile in his turn. \"It must have lost its\nferocity in the second generation. Besides, my friend, Providence has\nwarned us, that we may be on our guard. All we can now do is to wait.\nLet us wait; and, as I said before, let us speak of yourself. What\nbrings you to Paris?\"\n\n\"Affairs of importance which you shall know later. But what is this that\nI hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England? Monsieur d'Artagnan sides\nwith Mazarin! Pardon my frankness, dear friend. I neither hate nor blame\nthe cardinal, and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me. But do\nyou happen to belong to him?\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" replied Athos, \"is in the service; he is a\nsoldier and obeys all constitutional authority. Monsieur d'Artagnan is\nnot rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to\nlive. Millionaires like yourself, my lord, are rare in France.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said De Winter, \"I am at this moment as poor as he is, if not\npoorer. But to return to our subject.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you wish to know if I am of Mazarin's party? No. Pardon my\nfrankness, too, my lord.\"\n\n\"I am obliged to you, count, for this pleasing intelligence! You make\nme young and happy again by it. Ah! so you are not a Mazarinist?\nDelightful! Indeed, you could not belong to him. But pardon me, are you\nfree? I mean to ask if you are married?\"\n\n\"Ah! as to that, no,\" replied Athos, laughing.\n\n\"Because that young man, so handsome, so elegant, so polished----\"\n\n\"Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his\nfather.\"\n\n\"Very well; you are always the same, Athos, great and generous. Are you\nstill friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis?\"\n\n\"Add Monsieur d'Artagnan, my lord. We still remain four friends devoted\nto each other; but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal\nor of fighting him, of being Mazarinists or Frondists, then we are only\ntwo.\"\n\n\"Is Monsieur Aramis with D'Artagnan?\" asked Lord de Winter.\n\n\"No,\" said Athos; \"Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my\nopinions.\"\n\n\"Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend?\nIs he much changed?\"\n\n\"He has become an abbe, that is all.\"\n\n\"You alarm me; his profession must have made him renounce any great\nundertakings.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Athos, smiling, \"he has never been so much a\nmusketeer as since he became an abbe, and you will find him a veritable\nsoldier.\"\n\n\"Could you engage to bring him to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock,\non the Pont du Louvre?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" exclaimed Athos, smiling, \"you have a duel in prospect.\"\n\n\"Yes, count, and a splendid duel, too; a duel in which I hope you will\ntake your part.\"\n\n\"Where are we to go, my lord?\"\n\n\"To Her Majesty the Queen of England, who has desired me to present you\nto her.\"\n\n\"This is an enigma,\" said Athos, \"but it matters not; since you know the\nsolution of it I ask no further. Will your lordship do me the honor to\nsup with me?\"\n\n\"Thanks, count, no,\" replied De Winter. \"I own to you that that young\nman's visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my\nsleep. What undertaking can have brought him to Paris? It was not to\nmeet me that he came, for he was ignorant of my journey. This young man\nterrifies me, my lord; there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition.\"\n\n\"What occupies him in England?\"\n\n\"He is one of Cromwell's most enthusiastic disciples.\"\n\n\"But what attached him to the cause? His father and mother were\nCatholics, I believe?\"\n\n\"His hatred of the king, who deprived him of his estates and forbade him\nto bear the name of De Winter.\"\n\n\"And what name does he now bear?\"\n\n\"Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"A Puritan, yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in France.\"\n\n\"Do you say as a monk?\"\n\n\"It was thus, and by mere accident--may God pardon me if I\nblaspheme--that he heard the confession of the executioner of Bethune.\"\n\n\"Then I understand it all! he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin, and\nthe queen guessed rightly; we have been forestalled. Everything is clear\nto me now. Adieu, count, till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But the night is dark,\" said Athos, perceiving that Lord de Winter\nseemed more uneasy than he wished to appear; \"and you have no servant.\"\n\n\"I have Tony, a safe if simple youth.\"\n\n\"Halloo, there, Grimaud, Olivain, and Blaisois! call the viscount and\ntake the musket with you.\"\n\nBlaisois was the tall youth, half groom, half peasant, whom we saw at\nthe Chateau de Bragelonne, whom Athos had christened by the name of his\nprovince.\n\n\"Viscount,\" said Athos to Raoul, as he entered, \"you will conduct my\nlord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him.\"\n\n\"Oh! count,\" said De Winter, \"for whom do you take me?\"\n\n\"For a stranger who does not know Paris,\" said Athos, \"and to whom the\nviscount will show the way.\"\n\nDe Winter shook him by the hand.\n\n\"Grimaud,\" said Athos, \"put yourself at the head of the troop and beware\nof the monk.\"\n\nGrimaud shuddered, and nodding, awaited the departure, regarding the\nbutt of his musket with silent eloquence. Then obeying the orders given\nhim by Athos, he headed the small procession, bearing the torch in one\nhand and the musket in the other, until it reached De Winter's inn,\nwhen pounding on the portal with his fist, he bowed to my lord and faced\nabout without a word.\n\nThe same order was followed in returning, nor did Grimaud's searching\nglance discover anything of a suspicious appearance, save a dark shadow,\nas it were, in ambuscade, at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the\nQuai. He fancied, also, that in going he had already observed the street\nwatcher who had attracted his attention. He pushed on toward him, but\nbefore he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley, into\nwhich Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it.\n\nThe next day, on awaking, the count perceived Raoul by his bedside.\nThe young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M.\nChapelain.\n\n\"Already up, Raoul?\" exclaimed the count.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Raoul, with slight hesitation; \"I did not sleep\nwell.\"\n\n\"You, Raoul, not sleep well! then you must have something on your mind!\"\nsaid Athos.\n\n\"Sir, you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you\nwhen I have only just arrived, but----\"\n\n\"Have you only two days of leave, Raoul?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sir, I have ten; nor is it to the camp I wish to go.\"\n\n\"Where, then?\" said Athos, smiling, \"if it be not a secret. You are now\nalmost a man, since you have made your first passage of arms, and have\nacquired the right to go where you will without consulting me.\"\n\n\"Never, sir,\" said Raoul, \"as long as I possess the happiness of having\nyou for a protector, shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself\nfrom a guardianship so valuable to me. I have, however, a wish to go and\npass a day at Blois. You look at me and you are going to laugh at me.\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary, I am not inclined to laugh,\" said Athos,\nsuppressing a sigh. \"You wish to see Blois again; it is but natural.\"\n\n\"Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?\" exclaimed\nRaoul, joyously.\n\n\"Certainly; and why should I regret what gives you pleasure?\"\n\n\"Oh! how kind you are,\" exclaimed the young man, pressing his guardian's\nhand; \"and I can set out immediately?\"\n\n\"When you like, Raoul.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Raoul, as he turned to leave the room, \"I have thought of\none thing, and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse, who was so kind\nto me and to whom I owe my introduction to the prince.\"\n\n\"And you ought to thank her, Raoul. Well, try the Hotel de Luynes,\nRaoul, and ask if the duchess can receive you. I am glad to see you\npay attention to the usages of the world. You must take Grimaud and\nOlivain.\"\n\n\"Both, sir?\" asked Raoul, astonished.\n\n\"Both.\"\n\nRaoul went out, and when Athos heard his young, joyous voice calling to\nGrimaud and Olivain, he sighed.\n\n\"It is very soon to leave me,\" he thought, \"but he follows the common\ncustom. Nature has made us thus; she makes the young look ever forward,\nnot behind. He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as\nhis affection grows for her?\"\n\nAnd Athos confessed to himself that, he was unprepared for so prompt\na departure; but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced\neverything else from the consideration of his guardian.\n\nEverything was ready at ten o'clock for the departure, and as Athos was\nwatching Raoul mount, a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevreuse. He\nwas charged to tell the Comte de la Fere, that she had learned of the\nreturn of her youthful protege, and also the manner he had conducted\nhimself on the field, and she added that she should be very glad to\noffer him her congratulations.\n\n\"Tell her grace,\" replied Athos, \"that the viscount has just mounted his\nhorse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes.\"\n\nThen, with renewed instructions to Grimaud, Athos signified to Raoul\nthat he could set out, and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps\nbetter that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment.\n\n\n\n\n42. Another Queen in Want of Help.\n\n\n\nAthos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter\nto Blaisois, the only serving-man whom he had left. Blaisois found Bazin\ndonning his beadle's gown, his services being required that day at Notre\nDame.\n\nAthos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself. Blaisois,\na tall, simple youth, who understood nothing but what he was expressly\ntold, asked, therefore for the Abbe d'Herblay, and in spite of Bazin's\nassurances that his master was not at home, he persisted in such a\nmanner as to put Bazin into a passion. Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical\nguise, was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all\nrisks, believing too, that the man with whom he had to do was endowed\nwith the virtues of his cloth, namely, patience and Christian charity.\n\nBut Bazin, still the servant of a musketeer, when once the blood mounted\nto his fat cheeks, seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois,\nsaying:\n\n\"You have insulted the church, my friend, you have insulted the church!\"\n\nAt this moment Aramis, aroused by this unusual disturbance, cautiously\nopened the door of his room; and Blaisois, looking reproachfully at the\nCerberus, drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis.\n\n\"From the Comte de la Fere,\" said Aramis. \"All right.\" And he retired\ninto his room without even asking the cause of so much noise.\n\nBlaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne\nand when Athos inquired if his commission was executed, he related his\nadventure.\n\n\"You foolish fellow!\" said Athos, laughing. \"And you did not tell him\nthat you came from me?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock Athos, with his habitual exactitude, was waiting on the\nPont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter.\n\nThey waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was\nnot coming to join them.\n\n\"Patience,\" said Athos, whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the\nRue du Bac, \"patience; I see an abbe cuffing a man, then bowing to a\nwoman; it must be Aramis.\"\n\nIt was indeed Aramis. Having run against a young shopkeeper who was\ngaping at the crows and who had splashed him, Aramis with one blow of\nhis fist had distanced him ten paces.\n\nAt this moment one of his penitents passed, and as she was young and\npretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile.\n\nA most affectionate greeting, as one can well believe took place between\nhim and Lord de Winter.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" inquired Aramis; \"are we going to fight,\nperchance? I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to\nprocure one.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lord de Winter, \"we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty\nthe Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" replied Aramis; then bending his face down to Athos's\near, \"what is the object of this visit?\" continued he.\n\n\"Nay, I know not; some evidence required from us, perhaps.\"\n\n\"May it not be about that cursed affair?\" asked Aramis, \"in which case I\ndo not greatly care to go, for it will be to pocket a lecture; and since\nit is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving\nthem myself.\"\n\n\"If it were so,\" answered Athos, \"we should not be taken there by Lord\nde Winter, for he would come in for his share; he was one of us.\"\n\n\"You're right; yes, let us go.\"\n\nOn arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first; indeed, there\nwas but one porter there to receive them at the gate.\n\nIt was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the\nhabitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to\npass unnoticed by Athos, Aramis, and even the Englishman. Large rooms,\ncompletely stripped of furniture, bare walls upon which, here and there,\nshone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect, windows\nwith broken panes (impossible to close), no carpets, neither guards\nnor servants: this is what first met the eyes of Athos, to which he,\ntouching his companion's elbow, directed his attention by his glances.\n\n\"Mazarin is better lodged,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Mazarin is almost king,\" answered Athos; \"Madame Henrietta is almost no\nlonger queen.\"\n\n\"If you would condescend to be clever, Athos,\" observed Aramis, \"I\nreally do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Voiture.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\nThe queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them, for at the first\nslight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself\nto the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Misfortune.\n\n\"Enter. You are welcome, gentlemen,\" she said.\n\nThe gentlemen entered and remained standing, but at a motion from the\nqueen they seated themselves. Athos was calm and grave, but Aramis was\nfurious; the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes\nexamined every new trace of poverty that presented itself.\n\n\"You are examining the luxury I enjoy,\" said the queen, glancing sadly\naround her.\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Aramis, \"I must ask your pardon, but I know not how to\nhide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry IV. is treated at\nthe court of France.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Aramis is not an officer?\" asked the queen of Lord de Winter.\n\n\"That gentleman is the Abbe d'Herblay,\" replied he.\n\nAramis blushed. \"Madame,\" he said, \"I am an abbe, it is true, but I am\nso against my will. I never had a vocation for the bands; my cassock is\nfastened by one button only, and I am always ready to become a musketeer\nonce more. This morning, being ignorant that I should have the honor of\nseeing your majesty, I encumbered myself with this dress, but you\nwill find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty's service, in\nwhatever way you may see fit to use me.\"\n\n\"The Abbe d'Herblay,\" resumed De Winter, \"is one of those gallant\nmusketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII., of whom\nI have spoken to you, madame.\" Then turning to Athos, he continued, \"And\nthis gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere, whose high reputation is\nso well known to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the queen, \"a few years ago I had around me ushers,\ntreasures, armies; and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied\nin my service. To-day, look around you, and it may astonish you, that in\norder to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only\nLord de Winter, the friend of twenty years, and you, gentlemen, whom I\nsee for the first time and whom I know but as my countrymen.\"\n\n\"It is enough,\" said Athos, bowing low, \"if the lives of three men can\npurchase yours, madame.\"\n\n\"I thank you, gentlemen. But hear me,\" continued she. \"I am not only\nthe most miserable of queens, but the most unhappy of mothers, the most\nwretched of wives. My children, two of them, at least, the Duke of York\nand the Princess Elizabeth, are far away from me, exposed to the blows\nof the ambitious and our foes; my husband, the king, is leading in\nEngland so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that\nhe seeks death as a thing to be desired. Hold! gentlemen, here is the\nletter conveyed to me by Lord de Winter. Read it.\"\n\nObeying the queen, Athos read aloud the letter which we have already\nseen, in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of\nFrance would be accorded him.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Athos, when he had closed the letter.\n\n\"Well,\" said the queen, \"it has been refused.\"\n\nThe two friends exchanged a smile of contempt.\n\n\"And now,\" said Athos, \"what is to be done? I have the honor to inquire\nfrom your majesty what you desire Monsieur d'Herblay and myself to do in\nyour service. We are ready.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir, you have a noble heart!\" exclaimed the queen, with a burst of\ngratitude; whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said,\n\"Did I not answer for them?\"\n\n\"But you, sir?\" said the queen to Aramis.\n\n\"I, madame,\" replied he, \"follow Monsieur de la Fere wherever he leads,\neven were it on to death, without demanding wherefore; but when it\nconcerns your majesty's service, then,\" added he, looking at the queen\nwith all the grace of former days, \"I precede the count.\"\n\n\"Well, then, gentlemen,\" said the queen, \"since it is thus, and since\nyou are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess\nwhom the whole world has abandoned, this is what is required to be done\nfor me. The king is alone with a few gentlemen, whom he fears to lose\nevery day; surrounded by the Scotch, whom he distrusts, although he\nbe himself a Scotchman. Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted,\nsirs. I ask much, too much, perhaps, for I have no title to request\nit. Go to England, join the king, be his friends, protectors, march to\nbattle at his side, and be near him in his house, where conspiracies,\nmore dangerous than the perils of war, are hatching every day. And in\nexchange for the sacrifice that you make, gentlemen, I promise--not to\nreward you, I believe that word would offend you--but to love you as a\nsister, to prefer you, next to my husband and my children, to every one.\nI swear it before Heaven.\"\n\nAnd the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Athos, \"when must we set out?\"\n\n\"You consent then?\" exclaimed the queen, joyfully.\n\n\"Yes, madame; only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in\nengaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit. We render\nservice to God, madame, in serving a prince so unfortunate, a queen so\nvirtuous. Madame, we are yours, body and soul.\"\n\n\"Oh, sirs,\" said the queen, moved even to tears, \"this is the first time\nfor five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope. God, who\ncan read my heart, all the gratitude I feel, will reward you! Save my\nhusband! Save the king, and although you care not for the price that is\nplaced upon a good action in this world, leave me the hope that we shall\nmeet again, when I may be able to thank you myself. In the meantime, I\nremain here. Have you anything to ask of me? From this moment I become\nyour friend, and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy\nmyself in yours.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Athos, \"I have only to ask your majesty's prayers.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Aramis, \"I am alone in the world and have only your\nmajesty to serve.\"\n\nThe queen held out her hand, which they kissed, and she said in a low\ntone to De Winter:\n\n\"If you need money, my lord, separate the jewels I have given you;\ndetach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew. You will receive for them\nfifty or sixty thousand francs; spend them if necessary, but let these\ngentlemen be treated as they deserve, that is to say, like kings.\"\n\nThe queen had two letters ready, one written by herself, the other\nby her daughter, the Princess Henrietta. Both were addressed to King\nCharles. She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis, so that\nshould they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to\nthe king; after which they withdrew.\n\nAt the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped.\n\n\"Not to arouse suspicions, gentlemen,\" said he, \"go your way and I will\ngo mine, and this evening at nine o'clock we will assemble again at the\nGate Saint Denis. We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can\ngo and afterward we can take the post. Once more, let me thank you, my\ngood friends, both in my own name and the queen's.\"\n\nThe three gentlemen then shook hands, Lord de Winter taking the Rue\nSaint Honore, and Athos and Aramis remaining together.\n\n\"Well,\" said Aramis, when they were alone, \"what do you think of this\nbusiness, my dear count?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" replied Athos, \"very bad.\"\n\n\"But you received it with enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle, my\ndear D'Herblay. Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the\naristocracy, but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of\nmonarchs. Let us, then, support monarchy, in order to support ourselves.\n\n\"We shall be murdered there,\" said Aramis. \"I hate the English--they are\ncoarse, like every nation that swills beer.\"\n\n\"Would it be better to remain here,\" said Athos, \"and take a turn in\nthe Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of\nMonsieur de Beaufort? I'faith, Aramis, believe me, there is little left\nto regret. We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes; the\nchoice is easy.\"\n\n\"It is true; but in everything, friend, one must always return to the\nsame question--a stupid one, I admit, but very necessary--have you any\nmoney?\"\n\n\"Something like a hundred pistoles, that my farmer sent to me the day\nbefore I left Bragelonne; but out of that sum I ought to leave fifty\nfor Raoul--a young man must live respectably. I have then about fifty\npistoles. And you?\"\n\n\"As for me, I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and\nemptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at home. Fortunately Lord\nde Winter is rich.\"\n\n\"Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment; Oliver Cromwell has annexed\nhis income resources.\"\n\n\"Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful.\"\n\n\"Now it is that I regret D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Let us entice them away.\"\n\n\"This secret, Aramis, does not belong to us; take my advice, then, and\nlet no one into our confidence. And moreover, in taking such a step we\nshould appear to be doubtful of ourselves. Let us regret their absence\nto ourselves for our own sakes, but not speak of it.\"\n\n\"You are right; but what are you going to do until this evening? I have\ntwo things to postpone.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\"\n\n\"First, a thrust with the coadjutor, whom I met last night at Madame de\nRambouillet's and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting me.\"\n\n\"Oh, fie--a quarrel between priests, a duel between allies!\"\n\n\"What can I do, friend? he is a bully and so am I; his cassock is a\nburden to him and I imagine I have had enough of mine; in fact, there is\nso much resemblance between us that I sometimes believe he is Aramis\nand I am the coadjutor. This kind of life fatigues and oppresses\nme; besides, he is a turbulent fellow, who will ruin our party. I am\nconvinced that if I gave him a box on the ear, such as I gave this\nmorning to the little citizen who splashed me, it would change the\nappearance of things.\"\n\n\"And I, my dear Aramis,\" quietly replied Athos, \"I think it would only\nchange Monsieur de Retz's appearance. Take my advice, leave things just\nas they are; besides, you are neither of you now your own masters; he\nbelongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of England. So, if the second\nmatter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important\nthan the first----\"\n\n\"Oh! that is of the first importance.\"\n\n\"Attend to it, then, at once.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is a thing that I can't perform at any time I choose.\nIt was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Athos smiling, \"midnight.\"\n\n\"About that time.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, those are things that bear postponement and you\nmust put it off, especially with so good an excuse to give on your\nreturn----\"\n\n\"Yes, if I return.\"\n\n\"If you do not return, how does it concern you? Be reasonable. Come, you\nare no longer twenty years old.\"\n\n\"To my great regret, mordieu! Ah, if I were but twenty years old!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"doubtless you would commit great follies! But now we\nmust part. I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write.\nCall for me at eight o'clock or shall I wait supper for you at seven?\"\n\n\"That will do very well,\" said Aramis. \"I have twenty visits to make and\nas many letters to write.\"\n\nThey then separated. Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome,\nleft his name at Madame de Chevreuse's and wrote the following letter to\nD'Artagnan:\n\n\n\n\"Dear Friend,--I am about to set off with Aramis on important business.\nI wished to make my adieux to you, but time does not permit. Remember\nthat I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still\ncherish.\n\n\"Raoul is gone to Blois and is ignorant of my departure; watch over him\nin my absence as much as you possibly can; and if by chance you receive\nno news of me three months hence, tell him to open a packet which he\nwill find addressed to him in my bronze casket at Blois, of which I send\nyou now the key.\n\n\"Embrace Porthos from Aramis and myself. Adieu, perhaps farewell.\"\n\n\n\nAt the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived; he was dressed as an officer and\nhad the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he\nwas more than ever ready to draw.\n\n\"By-the-bye,\" he said, \"I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart\nthus, without leaving a line for Porthos and D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"The thing is done, dear friend,\" said Athos; \"I foresaw that and have\nembraced them both from you and myself.\"\n\n\"You are a wonderful man, my dear count,\" said Aramis; \"you think of\neverything.\"\n\n\"Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?\"\n\n\"Quite; and now that I reflect about it, I am glad to leave Paris at\nthis moment.\"\n\n\"And so am I,\" replied Athos; \"my only regret is not having seen\nD'Artagnan; but the rascal is so cunning, he might have guessed our\nproject.\"\n\nWhen supper was over Blaisois entered. \"Sir,\" said he, \"here is Monsieur\nd'Artagnan's answer.\"\n\n\"But I did not tell you there would be an answer, stupid!\" said Athos.\n\n\"And I set off without waiting for one, but he called me back and gave\nme this;\" and he presented a little leather bag, plump and giving out a\ngolden jingle.\n\nAthos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note, written in\nthese terms:\n\n\"My dear Count,--When one travels, and especially for three months, one\nnever has a superfluity of money. Now, recalling former times of mutual\ndistress, I send you half my purse; it is money to obtain which I made\nMazarin sweat. Don't make a bad use of it, I entreat you.\n\n\"As to what you say about not seeing you again, I believe not a word of\nit; with such a heart as yours--and such a sword--one passes through the\nvalley of the shadow of death a dozen times, unscathed and unalarmed. Au\nrevoir, not farewell.\n\n\"It is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved him;\nnevertheless, believe that I heartily pray that I may not become to him\na father, however much I might be proud of such a son.\n\n\"Your\n\n\"D'Artagnan.\n\n\"P.S.--Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are\nequally for Aramis as for you--for you as Aramis.\"\n\n\n\nAthos smiled, and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear. D'Artagnan, who had\nloved him so tenderly, loved him still, although a Mazarinist.\n\n\"There are the fifty louis, i'faith,\" said Aramis, emptying the purse on\nthe table, all bearing the effigy of Louis XIII. \"Well, what shall you\ndo with this money, count? Shall you keep it or send it back?\"\n\n\"I shall keep it, Aramis, and even though I had no need of it I still\nshould keep it. What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted\ngenerously. Take twenty-five of them, Aramis, and give me the remaining\ntwenty-five.\"\n\n\"All right; I am glad to see you are of my opinion. There now, shall we\nstart?\"\n\n\"When you like; but have you no groom?\"\n\n\"No; that idiot Bazin had the folly to make himself verger, as you know,\nand therefore cannot leave Notre Dame.\n\n\"Very well, take Blaisois, with whom I know not what to do, since I\nalready have Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Aramis.\n\nAt this moment Grimaud appeared at the door. \"Ready,\" said he, with his\nusual curtness.\n\n\"Let us go, then,\" said Athos.\n\nThe two friends mounted, as did their servants. At the corner of the\nQuai they encountered Bazin, who was running breathlessly.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed he, \"thank Heaven I have arrived in time. Monsieur\nPorthos has just been to your house and has left this for you, saying\nthat the letter was important and must be given to you before you left.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Aramis, taking a purse which Bazin presented to him. \"What\nis this?\"\n\n\"Wait, your reverence, there is a letter.\"\n\n\"You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but\nchevalier I will break every bone in your body. Give me the letter.\"\n\n\"How can you read?\" asked Athos, \"it is as dark as a cold oven.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Bazin, striking a flint, and setting afire a twisted\nwax-light, with which he started the church candles. Thus illumined,\nAramis read the following epistle:\n\n\"My dear D'Herblay,--I learned from D'Artagnan who has embraced me on\nthe part of the Comte de la Fere and yourself, that you are setting out\non a journey which may perhaps last two or three months; as I know that\nyou do not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own\naccord. Here are two hundred pistoles, which you can dispose of as you\nwish and return to me when opportunity occurs. Do not fear that you put\nme to inconvenience; if I want money I can send for some to any of my\nchateaux; at Bracieux alone, I have twenty thousand francs in gold. So,\nif I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a\nlarger sum.\n\n\"I address you, because you know, that although I esteem him from my\nheart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere; but it is understood\nthat what I offer you I offer him at the same time.\n\n\"I am, as I trust you do not doubt, your devoted\n\n\"Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.\"\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Aramis, \"what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"I say, my dear D'Herblay, that it is almost sacrilege to distrust\nProvidence when one has such friends, and therefore we will divide the\npistoles from Porthos, as we divided the louis sent by D'Artagnan.\"\n\nThe division being made by the light of Bazin's taper, the two friends\ncontinued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De\nWinter at the Porte Saint Denis.\n\n\n\n\n43. In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best.\n\n\n\nThe three gentlemen took the road to Picardy, a road so well known to\nthem and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque\nadventures of their youth.\n\n\"If Mousqueton were with us,\" observed Athos, on reaching the spot\nwhere they had had a dispute with the paviers, \"how he would tremble at\npassing this! Do you remember, Aramis, that it was here he received that\nfamous bullet wound?\"\n\n\"By my faith, 'twould be excusable in him to tremble,\" replied Aramis,\n\"for even I feel a shudder at the recollection; hold, just above that\ntree is the little spot where I thought I was killed.\"\n\nIt was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past. Arriving before the\ninn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast, he\napproached Athos and said, showing him the airhole of the cellar:\n\n\"Sausages!\"\n\nAthos began to laugh, for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be\nas amusing as if some one had related it of another person.\n\nAt last, after traveling two days and a night, they arrived at Boulogne\ntoward the evening, favored by magnificent weather. Boulogne was a\nstrong position, then almost a deserted town, built entirely on the\nheights; what is now called the lower town did not then exist.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said De Winter, on reaching the gate of the town, \"let us\ndo here as at Paris--let us separate to avoid suspicion. I know an inn,\nlittle frequented, but of which the host is entirely devoted to me. I\nwill go there, where I expect to find letters, and you go to the first\ntavern in the town, to L'Epee du Grand Henri for instance, refresh\nyourselves, and in two hours be upon the jetty; our boat is waiting for\nus there.\"\n\nThe matter being thus decided, the two friends found, about two hundred\npaces further, the tavern indicated. Their horses were fed, but not\nunsaddled; the grooms supped, for it was already late, and their two\nmasters, impatient to return, appointed a place of meeting with them\non the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with\nany one. It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois\nalone--long enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud.\n\nAthos and Aramis walked down toward the port. From their dress, covered\nwith dust, and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man\naccustomed to travel is always recognizable, the two friends excited the\nattention of a few promenaders. There was more especially one upon whom\ntheir arrival had produced a decided impression. This man, whom they\nhad noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been\nremarked by others, was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty.\nFrom the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and\nseemed to burn with the wish to speak to them.\n\nOn reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat\nmade fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start.\n\n\"That is doubtless our boat,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Aramis, \"and the sloop out there making ready to sail\nmust be that which is to take us to our destination; now,\" continued he,\n\"if only De Winter does not keep us waiting. It is not at all amusing\nhere; there is not a single woman passing.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Athos, \"we are overheard.\"\n\nIn truth, the walker, who, during the observations of the two friends,\nhad passed and repassed behind them several times, stopped at the name\nof De Winter; but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this\nname, it might have been by chance he stood so still.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the man, who was young and pale, bowing with ease and\ncourtesy, \"pardon my curiosity, but I see you come from Paris, or at\nleast that you are strangers at Boulogne.\"\n\n\"We come from Paris, yes,\" replied Athos, with the same courtesy; \"what\nis there we can do for you?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the young man, \"will you be so good as to tell me if it be\ntrue that Cardinal Mazarin is no longer minister?\"\n\n\"That is a strange question,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"He is and he is not,\" replied Athos; \"that is to say, he is dismissed\nby one-half of France, but by intrigues and promises he makes the other\nhalf sustain him; you will perceive that this may last a long time.\"\n\n\"However, sir,\" said the stranger, \"he has neither fled nor is in\nprison?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not at this moment at least.\"\n\n\"Sirs, accept my thanks for your politeness,\" said the young man,\nretreating.\n\n\"What do you think of that interrogator?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of\ninformation.\"\n\n\"And you replied to him with that notion?\"\n\n\"Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise; he was polite to me and I\nwas so to him.\"\n\n\"But if he be a spy----\"\n\n\"What do you think a spy would be about here? We are not living in the\ntime of Cardinal Richelieu, who would have closed the ports on bare\nsuspicion.\"\n\n\"It matters not; you were wrong to reply to him as you did,\" continued\nAramis, following with his eyes the young man, now vanishing behind the\ncliffs.\n\n\"And you,\" said Athos, \"you forget that you committed a very different\nkind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winter's name. Did you not see\nthat at that name the young man stopped?\"\n\n\"More reason, then, when he spoke to you, for sending him about his\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"A quarrel?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?\"\n\n\"I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and\nwhen such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it. Besides, let\nme own something to you. I am anxious to see that young man nearer.\"\n\n\"And wherefore?\"\n\n\"Aramis, you will certainly laugh at me, you will say that I am\nalways repeating the same thing, you will call me the most timorous of\nvisionaries; but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man?\"\n\n\"In beauty or on the contrary?\" asked Aramis, laughing.\n\n\"In ugliness, in so far as a man can resemble a woman.\"\n\n\"Ah! Egad!\" cried Aramis, \"you set me thinking. No, in truth you are\nno visionary, my dear friend, and now I think of it--you--yes, i'faith,\nyou're right--those delicate, yet firm-set lips, those eyes which seem\nalways at the command of the intellect and never of the heart! Yes, it\nis one of Milady's bastards!\"\n\n\"You laugh Aramis.\"\n\n\"From habit, that is all. I swear to you, I like no better than yourself\nto meet that viper in my path.\"\n\n\"Ah! here is De Winter coming,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Good! one thing now is only awanting and that is, that our grooms\nshould not keep us waiting.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Athos. \"I see them about twenty paces behind my lord. I\nrecognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch. Tony\ncarries our muskets.\"\n\n\"Then we set sail to-night?\" asked Aramis, glancing toward the west,\nwhere the sun had left a single golden cloud, which, dipping into the\nocean, appeared by degrees to be extinguished.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Diable!\" resumed Aramis, \"I have little fancy for the sea by day, still\nless at night; the sounds of wind and wave, the frightful movements of\nthe vessel; I confess I prefer the convent of Noisy.\"\n\nAthos smiled sadly, for it was evident that he was thinking of other\nthings as he listened to his friend and moved toward De Winter.\n\n\"What ails our friend?\" said Aramis, \"he resembles one of Dante's\ndamned, whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at\ntheir heels. What the devil makes him glower thus behind him?\"\n\nWhen De Winter perceived them, in his turn he advanced toward them with\nsurprising rapidity.\n\n\"What is the matter, my lord?\" said Athos, \"and what puts you out of\nbreath thus?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied De Winter; \"nothing; and yet in passing the heights\nit seemed to me----\" and he again turned round.\n\nAthos glanced at Aramis.\n\n\"But let us go,\" continued De Winter; \"let us be off; the boat must be\nwaiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor--do you see it there? I\nwish I were on board already,\" and he looked back again.\n\n\"He has seen him,\" said Athos, in a low tone, to Aramis.\n\nThey had reached the ladder which led to the boat. De Winter made the\ngrooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend\nfirst and was about to follow them.\n\nAt this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to\nthe jetty, and hastening his steps, as if to reach the other side of the\nport, scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking. He fancied in\nthe darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him.\nAthos now descended the ladder in his turn, without losing sight of the\nyoung man. The latter, to make a short cut, had appeared on a sluice.\n\n\"He certainly bodes us no good,\" said Athos; \"but let us embark; once\nout at sea, let him come.\"\n\nAnd Athos sprang into the boat, which was immediately pushed off and\nwhich soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers.\n\nBut the young man had begun to follow, or rather to advance before the\nboat. She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty, surmounted\nby a beacon just lighted, and a rock which jutted out. They saw him in\nthe distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it\npassed.\n\n\"Ay, but,\" said Aramis, \"that young fellow is decidedly a spy.\"\n\n\"Which is the young man?\" asked De Winter, turning around.\n\n\"He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there; behold!\"\n\nDe Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramis's finger. The\nbeacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were\nabout to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and\ncrossed arms.\n\n\"It is he!\" exclaimed De Winter, seizing the arm of Athos; \"it is he! I\nthought I recognized him and I was not mistaken.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Milady's son,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"The monk!\" exclaimed Grimaud.\n\nThe young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that\none might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it.\n\n\"Yes, it is I, my uncle--I, the son of Milady--I, the monk--I, the\nsecretary and friend of Cromwell--I know you now, both you and your\ncompanions.\"\n\nIn that boat sat three men, unquestionably brave, whose courage no man\nwould have dared dispute; nevertheless, at that voice, that accent and\nthose gestures, they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins. As\nfor Grimaud, his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Aramis, \"that is the nephew, the monk, and the son of\nMilady, as he says himself.\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" murmured De Winter.\n\n\"Then wait,\" said Aramis; and with the terrible coolness which on\nimportant occasions he showed, he took one of the muskets from Tony,\nshouldered and aimed it at the young man, who stood, like the accusing\nangel, upon the rock.\n\n\"Fire!\" cried Grimaud, unconsciously.\n\nAthos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which\nwas about to be fired.\n\n\"The devil take you,\" said Aramis. \"I had him so well at the point of my\ngun I should have sent a ball into his breast.\"\n\n\"It is enough to have killed the mother,\" said Athos, hoarsely.\n\n\"The mother was a wretch, who struck at us all and at those dear to us.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the son has done us no harm.\"\n\nGrimaud, who had risen to watch the effect of the shot, fell back\nhopeless, wringing his hands.\n\nThe young man burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Ah, it is certainly you!\" he cried. \"I know you even better now.\"\n\nHis mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads,\ncarried by the breeze, until lost in the depths of the horizon. Aramis\nshuddered.\n\n\"Be calm,\" exclaimed Athos, \"for Heaven's sake! have we ceased to be\nmen?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Aramis, \"but that fellow is a fiend; and ask the uncle\nwhether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew.\"\n\nDe Winter only replied by a groan.\n\n\"It was all up with him,\" continued Aramis; \"ah I much fear that with\nall your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly.\"\n\nAthos took Lord de Winter's hand and tried to turn the conversation.\n\n\"When shall we land in England?\" he asked; but De Winter seemed not to\nhear his words and made no reply.\n\n\"Hold, Athos,\" said Aramis, \"perhaps there is yet time. See if he is\nstill in the same place.\"\n\nAthos turned around with an effort; the sight of the young man was\nevidently painful to him, and there he still was, in fact, on the rock,\nthe beacon shedding around him, as it were, a doubtful aureole.\n\n\"Decidedly, Aramis,\" said Athos, \"I think I was wrong not to let you\nfire.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" replied Aramis; \"you would make me weep, if such a\nthing were possible.\"\n\nAt this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few\nseconds later men, servants and baggage were aboard. The captain was\nonly waiting for his passengers; hardly had they put foot on deck ere\nher head was turned towards Hastings, where they were to disembark. At\nthis instant the three friends turned, in spite of themselves, a last\nlook on the rock, upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now\nstood out with a distinctness still. Then a voice reached them once\nmore, sending this threat: \"To our next meeting, sirs, in England.\"\n\n\n\n\n44. Te Deum for the Victory of Lens.\n\n\n\nThe bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she\nhad vainly sought to discover a reason, was occasioned by the battle of\nLens, announced by the prince's messenger, the Duc de Chatillon, who had\ntaken such a noble part in the engagement; he was, besides, charged to\nhang five and twenty flags, taken from the Lorraine party, as well as\nfrom the Spaniards, upon the arches of Notre Dame.\n\nSuch news was decisive; it destroyed, in favor of the court, the\nstruggle commenced with parliament. The motive given for all the taxes\nsummarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition, was\nthe necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope\nof beating the enemy. Now, since the affair of Nordlingen, they had\nexperienced nothing but reverses; the parliament had a plea for calling\nMazarin to account for imaginary victories, always promised, ever\ndeferred; but this time there really had been fighting, a triumph and a\ncomplete one. And this all knew so well that it was a double victory\nfor the court, a victory at home and abroad; so that even when the young\nking learned the news he exclaimed, \"Ah, gentlemen of the parliament, we\nshall see what you will say now!\" Upon which the queen had pressed the\nroyal child to her heart, whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in\nsuch harmony with her own. A council was called on the same evening, but\nnothing transpired of what had been decided on. It was only known that\non the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor\nof the victory of Lens.\n\nThe following Sunday, then, the Parisians arose with joy; at that period\na Te Deum was a grand affair; this kind of ceremony had not then been\nabused and it produced a great effect. The shops were deserted, houses\nclosed; every one wished to see the young king with his mother, and the\nfamous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be\ndeprived of his presence. Moreover, great liberty prevailed throughout\nthe immense crowd; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused, so\nto speak, of coming insurrection, as the thousand bells of all the Paris\nchurches rang out the Te Deum. The police belonging to the city being\nformed by the city itself, nothing threatening presented itself to\ndisturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs\nof slanderous lips.\n\nNevertheless, at eight o'clock in the morning the regiment of the\nqueen's guards, commanded by Guitant, under whom was his nephew\nComminges, marched publicly, preceded by drums and trumpets, filing\noff from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame, a manoeuvre which the\nParisians witnessed tranquilly, delighted as they were with military\nmusic and brilliant uniforms.\n\nFriquet had put on his Sunday clothes, under the pretext of having a\nswollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful\nof cherry kernels into one side of his mouth, and had procured a whole\nholiday from Bazin. On leaving Bazin, Friquet started off to the Palais\nRoyal, where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment\nof guards; and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it\nand hearing the music, he took his place at their head, beating the drum\non two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the\ntrumpet, which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a\nmanner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of\nimitative harmony.\n\nThis amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of\nNotre Dame, and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment; but when at\nlast the regiment separated, penetrated the heart of the city and\nplaced itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe, near the Rue\nCocatrix, in which Broussel lived, then Friquet remembered that he had\nnot had breakfast; and after thinking in which direction he had better\nturn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day, he\nreflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the\ncost of this repast.\n\nIn consequence he took to his heels, arrived breathlessly at the\ncouncillor's door, and knocked violently.\n\nHis mother, the councillor's old servant, opened it.\n\n\"What doest thou here, good-for-nothing?\" she said, \"and why art thou\nnot at Notre Dame?\"\n\n\"I have been there, mother,\" said Friquet, \"but I saw things happen of\nwhich Master Broussel ought to be warned, and so with Monsieur Bazin's\npermission--you know, mother, Monsieur Bazin, the verger--I came to\nspeak to Monsieur Broussel.\"\n\n\"And what hast thou to say, boy, to Monsieur Broussel?\"\n\n\"I wish to tell him,\" replied Friquet, screaming with all his might,\n\"that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way. And as I hear\neverywhere that at the court they are ill-disposed to him, I wish to\nwarn him, that he may be on his guard.\"\n\nBroussel heard the scream of the young oddity, and, enchanted with this\nexcess of zeal, came down to the first floor, for he was, in truth,\nworking in his room on the second.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"friend, what matters the regiment of guards to us, and\nart thou not mad to make such a disturbance? Knowest thou not that it\nis the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the\nregiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by?\"\n\nFriquet counterfeited surprise, and twisting his new cap around in his\nfingers, said:\n\n\"It is not astonishing for you to know it, Monsieur Broussel, who\nknows everything; but as for me, by holy truth, I did not know it and I\nthought I would give you good advice; you must not be angry with me for\nthat, Monsieur Broussel.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my boy, on the contrary, I am pleased with your zeal.\nDame Nanette, look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent\nto us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son,\nwith a crust of new bread.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir, thank you, Monsieur Broussel,\" said Friquet; \"I am\nso fond of apricots!\"\n\nBroussel then proceeded to his wife's room and asked for breakfast;\nit was nine o'clock. The councillor placed himself at the window; the\nstreet was completely deserted, but in the distance was heard, like\nthe noise of the tide rushing in, the deep hum of the populous waves\nincreasing now around Notre Dame.\n\nThis noise redoubled when D'Artagnan, with a company of musketeers,\nplaced himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the\nchurch. He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see\nthe ceremony; and Porthos, in full dress, mounted his finest horse,\ntaking the part of supernumerary musketeer, as D'Artagnan had so often\ndone formerly. The sergeant of this company, a veteran of the Spanish\nwars, had recognized Porthos, his old companion, and very soon all\nthose who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts\nconcerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Treville. Porthos had\nnot only been well received by the company, but he was moreover looked\non with great admiration.\n\nAt ten o'clock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the\nking, and then a movement, similar to that of trees in a stormy wind\nthat bend and writhe with agitated tops, ran though the multitude, which\nwas compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard. At last the\nking appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot. Ten other carriages\nfollowed, containing the ladies of honor, the officers of the royal\nhousehold, and the court.\n\n\"God save the king!\" was the cry in every direction; the young monarch\ngravely put his head out of the window, looked sufficiently grateful and\neven bowed; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed.\n\nJust as the court was settling down in the cathedral, a carriage,\nbearing the arms of Comminges, quitted the line of the court carriages\nand proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe, now\nentirely deserted. When it arrived there, four guards and a police\nofficer, who accompanied it, mounted into the heavy machine and closed\nthe shutters; then through an opening cautiously made, the policeman\nbegan to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix, as if he was waiting for\nsome one.\n\nAll the world was occupied with the ceremony, so that neither the\nchariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had\nbeen observed. Friquet, whose eye, ever on the alert, could alone have\ndiscovered them, had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of\na house in the square of Notre Dame. Thence he saw the king, the queen\nand Monsieur Mazarin, and heard the mass as well as if he had been on\nduty.\n\nToward the end of the service, the queen, seeing Comminges standing near\nher, waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before\nquitting the Louvre, said in a whisper:\n\n\"Go, Comminges, and may God aid you!\"\n\nComminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint\nChristophe. Friquet, seeing this fine officer thus walk away, followed\nby two guards, amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the\nmore gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted\nhis carriage.\n\nHardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue\nCocatrix when he said one word to the coachman, who at once put his\nvehicle into motion and drove up before Broussel's door. Comminges\nknocked at the door at the same moment, and Friquet was waiting behind\nComminges until the door should be opened.\n\n\"What dost thou there, rascal?\" asked Comminges.\n\n\"I want to go into Master Broussel's house, captain,\" replied Friquet,\nin that wheedling way the \"gamins\" of Paris know so well how to assume\nwhen necessary.\n\n\"And on what floor does he live?\" asked Comminges.\n\n\"In the whole house,\" said Friquet; \"the house belongs to him; he\noccupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to\ntake his meals; he must be at dinner now; it is noon.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Comminges.\n\nAt this moment the door was opened, and having questioned the servant\nthe officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner.\n\nBroussel was seated at the table with his family, having his wife\nopposite to him, his two daughters by his side, and his son,\nLouvieres, whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the\ncouncillor--an accident from which he had quite recovered--at the bottom\nof the table. The worthy man, restored to perfect health, was tasting\nthe fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to him.\n\nAt sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved, but seeing him\nbow politely he rose and bowed also. Still, in spite of this reciprocal\npoliteness, the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of\nuneasiness; Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the\nofficer to explain himself.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Comminges, \"I am the bearer of an order from the king.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" replied Broussel, \"what is this order?\" And he held\nout his hand.\n\n\"I am commissioned to seize your person, sir,\" said Comminges, in the\nsame tone and with the same politeness; \"and if you will believe me you\nhad better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and\nfollow me.\"\n\nA thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people, so peacefully\nassembled there, would not have produced a more appalling effect. It was\na horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the\nking. Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword, which stood against\na chair in a corner of the room; but a glance from the worthy Broussel,\nwho in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind, checked\nthis foolhardy action of despair. Madame Broussel, separated by the\nwidth of the table from her husband, burst into tears, and the young\ngirls clung to their father's arms.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" said Comminges, \"make haste; you must obey the king.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Broussel, \"I am in bad health and cannot give myself up a\nprisoner in this state; I must have time.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Comminges; \"the order is strict and must be put\ninto execution this instant.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Louvieres; \"sir, beware of driving us to despair.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried a shrill voice from the end of the room.\n\nComminges turned and saw Dame Nanette, her eyes flashing with anger and\na broom in her hand.\n\n\"My good Nanette, be quiet, I beseech you,\" said Broussel.\n\n\"Me! keep quiet while my master is being arrested! he, the support, the\nliberator, the father of the people! Ah! well, yes; you have to know me\nyet. Are you going?\" added she to Comminges.\n\nThe latter smiled.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" said he, addressing Broussel, \"silence that woman and\nfollow me.\"\n\n\"Silence me! me! me!\" said Nanette. \"Ah! yet one wants some one besides\nyou for that, my fine king's cockatoo! You shall see.\" And Dame Nanette\nsprang to the window, threw it open, and in such a piercing voice that\nit might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame:\n\n\"Help!\" she screamed, \"my master is being arrested; the Councillor\nBroussel is being arrested! Help!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Comminges, \"declare yourself at once; will you obey or do\nyou intend to rebel against the king?\"\n\n\"I obey, I obey, sir!\" cried Broussel, trying to disengage himself\nfrom the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son, who\nseemed determined to dispute authority.\n\n\"In that case,\" commanded Comminges, \"silence that old woman.\"\n\n\"Ah! old woman!\" screamed Nanette.\n\nAnd she began to shriek more loudly, clinging to the bars of the window:\n\n\"Help! help! for Master Broussel, who is arrested because he has\ndefended the people! Help!\"\n\nComminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged\nher from her post; but at that instant a treble voice, proceeding from a\nkind of entresol, was heard screeching:\n\n\"Murder! fire! assassins! Master Broussel is being killed! Master\nBroussel is being strangled.\"\n\nIt was Friquet's voice; and Dame Nanette, feeling herself supported,\nrecommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk.\n\nMany curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people\nattracted to the end of the street began to run, first men, then groups,\nand then a crowd of people; hearing cries and seeing a chariot they\ncould not understand it; but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the\ntop of the carriage.\n\n\"They want to arrest Master Broussel!\" he cried; \"the guards are in the\ncarriage and the officer is upstairs!\"\n\nThe crowd began to murmur and approached the house. The two guards who\nhad remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges; those who were\nin the chariot opened the doors and presented arms.\n\n\"Don't you see them?\" cried Friquet, \"don't you see? there they are!\"\n\nThe coachman turning around, gave Friquet a slash with his whip which\nmade him scream with pain.\n\n\"Ah! devil's coachman!\" cried Friquet, \"you're meddling too! Wait!\"\n\nAnd regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every\nprojectile he could lay hands on.\n\nThe tumult now began to increase; the street was not able to contain\nthe spectators who assembled from every direction; the crowd invaded\nthe space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear\nbetween them and the carriage. The soldiers, pushed back by these living\nwalls, were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels\nand the panels of the carriages. The cries which the police officer\nrepeated twenty times: \"In the king's name,\" were powerless against this\nformidable multitude--seemed, on the contrary, to exasperate it still\nmore; when, at the shout, \"In the name of the king,\" an officer ran up,\nand seeing the uniforms ill-treated, he sprang into the scuffle sword\nin hand, and brought unexpected help to the guards. This gentleman was\na young man, scarcely sixteen years of age, now white with anger.\nHe leaped from his charger, placed his back against the shaft of the\ncarriage, making a rampart of his horse, drew his pistols from their\nholsters and fastened them to his belt, and began to fight with the back\nsword, like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon.\n\nDuring ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay; at last Comminges\nappeared, pushing Broussel before him.\n\n\"Let us break the carriage!\" cried the people.\n\n\"In the king's name!\" cried Comminges.\n\n\"The first who advances is a dead man!\" cried Raoul, for it was in\nfact he, who, feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic\ncitizen, pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling\nback.\n\nComminges, so to speak, threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in\nafter him. At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through\nthe hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards. Comminges\nlooked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres\nappearing at the window of the second floor.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Comminges, \"you shall hear of this anon.\"\n\n\"And you of me, sir,\" said Louvieres; \"and we shall see then who can\nspeak the loudest.\"\n\nFriquet and Nanette continued to shout; the cries, the noise of the\nshot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening\neffects.\n\n\"Down with the officer! down with him!\" was the cry.\n\n\"One step nearer,\" said Comminges, putting down the sashes, that the\ninterior of the carriage might be well seen, and placing his sword on\nhis prisoner's breast, \"one step nearer, and I kill the prisoner; my\norders were to carry him off alive or dead. I will take him dead, that's\nall.\"\n\nA terrible cry was heard, and the wife and daughters of Broussel held\nup their hands in supplication to the people; the latter knew that this\nofficer, who was so pale, but who appeared so determined, would keep his\nword; they continued to threaten, but they began to disperse.\n\n\"Drive to the palace,\" said Comminges to the coachman, who was by then\nmore dead than alive.\n\nThe man whipped his animals, which cleared a way through the crowd;\nbut on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop; the carriage was\nupset, the horses carried off, stifled, mangled by the crowd. Raoul,\non foot, for he had not time to mount his horse again, tired, like the\nguards, of distributing blows with the flat of his sword, had recourse\nto its point. But this last and dreaded resource served only to\nexasperate the multitude. From time to time a shot from a musket or the\nblade of a rapier flashed among the crowd; projectiles continued to\nhail down from the windows and some shots were heard, the echo of which,\nthough they were probably fired in the air, made all hearts vibrate.\nVoices, unheard except on days of revolution, were distinguished; faces\nwere seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed. Cries of \"Death!\ndeath to the guards! to the Seine with the officer!\" were heard above\nall the noise, deafening as it was. Raoul, his hat in ribbons, his face\nbleeding, felt not only his strength but also his reason going; a\nred mist covered his sight, and through this mist he saw a hundred\nthreatening arms stretched over him, ready to seize upon him when he\nfell. The guards were unable to help any one--each one was occupied\nwith his self-preservation. All was over; carriages, horses, guards, and\nperhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds, when all at\nonce a voice well known to Raoul was heard, and suddenly a great sword\nglittered in the air; at the same time the crowd opened, upset, trodden\ndown, and an officer of the musketeers, striking and cutting right and\nleft, rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about\nto fall.\n\n\"God's blood!\" cried the officer, \"have they killed him? Woe to them if\nit be so!\"\n\nAnd he turned around, so stern with anger, strength and threat, that the\nmost excited rebels hustled back on one another, in order to escape, and\nsome of them even rolled into the Seine.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" murmured Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, 'sdeath! in person, and fortunately it seems for you, my young\nfriend. Come on, here, you others,\" he continued, rising in his\nstirrups, raising his sword, and addressing those musketeers who had not\nbeen able to follow his rapid onslaught. \"Come, sweep away all that for\nme! Shoulder muskets! Present arms! Aim----\"\n\nAt this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that\nD'Artagnan could not repress a burst of Homeric laughter.\n\n\"Thank you, D'Artagnan,\" said Comminges, showing half of his body\nthrough the window of the broken vehicle, \"thanks, my young friend; your\nname--that I may mention it to the queen.\"\n\nRaoul was about to reply when D'Artagnan bent down to his ear.\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said he, \"and let me answer. Do not lose time,\nComminges,\" he continued; \"get out of the carriage if you can and make\nanother draw up; be quick, or in five minutes the mob will be on us\nagain with swords and muskets and you will be killed. Hold! there's a\ncarriage coming over yonder.\"\n\nThen bending again to Raoul, he whispered: \"Above all things do not\ndivulge your name.\"\n\n\"That's right. I will go,\" said Comminges; \"and if they come back,\nfire!\"\n\n\"Not at all--not at all,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"let no one move. On the\ncontrary, one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to-morrow.\"\n\nComminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the\ncarriage, from which he made the people inside dismount, and brought\nthem to the vehicle which had upset. But when it was necessary to convey\nthe prisoner from one carriage to the other, the people, catching sight\nof him whom they called their liberator, uttered every imaginable cry\nand knotted themselves once more around the vehicle.\n\n\"Start, start!\" said D'Artagnan. \"There are ten men to accompany you.\nI will keep twenty to hold in check the mob; go, and lose not a moment.\nTen men for Monsieur de Comminges.\"\n\nAs the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than\nten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and\nadjacent streets. A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried D'Artagnan, driven to extremities, biting his\nmoustache; and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in\nfear. One man alone remained in his place, gun in hand.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated? Wait\nan instant.\" And he pointed his gun at D'Artagnan, who was riding toward\nhim at full speed. D'Artagnan bent down to his horse's neck, the young\nman fired, and the ball severed the feathers from the hat. The horse\nstarted, brushed against the imprudent man, who thought by his strength\nalone to stay the tempest, and he fell against the wall. D'Artagnan\npulled up his horse, and whilst his musketeers continued to charge, he\nreturned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" exclaimed Raoul, recognizing the young man as having seen him\nin the Rue Cocatrix, \"spare him! it is his son!\"\n\nD'Artagnan's arm dropped to his side. \"Ah, you are his son!\" he said;\n\"that is a different thing.\"\n\n\"Sir, I surrender,\" said Louvieres, presenting his unloaded musket to\nthe officer.\n\n\"Eh, no! do not surrender, egad! On the contrary, be off, and quickly.\nIf I take you, you will be hung!\"\n\nThe young man did not wait to be told twice, but passing under the\nhorse's head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud.\n\n\"I'faith!\" said D'Artagnan to Raoul, \"you were just in time to stay my\nhand. He was a dead man; and on my honor, if I had discovered that it\nwas his son, I should have regretted having killed him.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir!\" said Raoul, \"allow me, after thanking you for that poor\nfellow's life, to thank you on my own account. I too, sir, was almost\ndead when you arrived.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait, young man; do not fatigue yourself with speaking. We can\ntalk of it afterward.\"\n\nThen seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf\nto the Quai Saint Michael, he raised his sword for them to double their\nspeed. The musketeers trotted up, and at the same time the ten men whom\nD'Artagnan had given to Comminges appeared.\n\n\"Halloo!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"has something fresh happened?\"\n\n\"Eh, sir!\" replied the sergeant, \"their vehicle has broken down a second\ntime; it really must be doomed.\"\n\n\"They are bad managers,\" said D'Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders. \"When\na carriage is chosen, it ought to be strong. The carriage in which a\nBroussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men.\"\n\n\"What are your commands, lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Take the detachment and conduct him to his place.\"\n\n\"But you will be left alone?\"\n\n\"Certainly. So you suppose I have need of an escort? Go.\"\n\nThe musketeers set off and D'Artagnan was left alone with Raoul.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"are you in pain?\"\n\n\"Yes; my head is not only swimming but burning.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with this head?\" said D'Artagnan, raising the\nbattered hat. \"Ah! ah! a bruise.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I received a flower-pot upon my head.\"\n\n\"Brutes!\" said D'Artagnan. \"But were you not on horseback? you have\nspurs.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was\ntaken away. Here it is, I see.\"\n\nAt this very moment Friquet passed, mounted on Raoul's horse, waving his\nparti-colored cap and crying, \"Broussel! Broussel!\"\n\n\"Halloo! stop, rascal!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Bring hither that horse.\"\n\nFriquet heard perfectly, but he pretended not to do so and tried to\ncontinue his road. D'Artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue\nMaster Friquet, but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented\nhimself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it.\n\nFriquet had a quick eye and a fine ear. He saw D'Artagnan's movement,\nheard the sound of the click, and stopped at once.\n\n\"Ah! it is you, your honor,\" he said, advancing toward D'Artagnan; \"and\nI am truly pleased to meet you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little\nchorister of the Rue de la Calandre.\n\n\"Ah! 'tis thou, rascal!\" said he, \"come here: so thou hast changed thy\ntrade; thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy; thou hast become\na horse stealer?\"\n\n\"Ah, your honor, how can you say so?\" exclaimed Friquet. \"I was seeking\nthe gentleman to whom this horse belongs--an officer, brave and handsome\nas a youthful Caesar;\" then, pretending to see Raoul for the first time:\n\n\"Ah! but if I mistake not,\" continued he, \"here he is; you won't forget\nthe boy, sir.\"\n\nRaoul put his hand in his pocket.\n\n\"What are you about?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"To give ten francs to this honest fellow,\" replied Raoul, taking a\npistole from his pocket.\n\n\"Ten kicks on his back!\" said D'Artagnan; \"be off, you little villain,\nand forget not that I have your address.\"\n\nFriquet, who did not expect to be let off so cheaply, bounded off like\na gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine, and disappeared. Raoul mounted\nhis horse, and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne.\n\nD'Artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son.\n\nThey arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette.\n\nThe handsome Madeleine announced to D'Artagnan that Planchet had\nreturned, bringing Mousqueton with him, who had heroically borne the\nextraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit.\n\nD'Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned, but he had disappeared.\n\n\"Then bring some wine,\" said D'Artagnan. \"You are much pleased with\nyourself,\" said he to Raoul when they were alone, \"are you not?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" replied Raoul. \"It seems to me I did my duty. I defended\nthe king.\"\n\n\"And who told you to defend the king?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere himself.\"\n\n\"Yes, the king; but to-day you have not fought for the king, you have\nfought for Mazarin; which is not quite the same thing.\"\n\n\"But you yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh, for me; that is another matter. I obey my captain's orders. As for\nyou, your captain is the prince, understand that rightly; you have no\nother. But has one ever seen such a wild fellow,\" continued he, \"making\nhimself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel! Breathe not a word\nof that, or the Comte de la Fere will be furious.\"\n\n\"You think the count will be angry with me?\"\n\n\"Think it? I'm certain of it; were it not for that, I should thank you,\nfor you have worked for us. However, I scold you instead of him, and\nin his place; the storm will blow over more easily, believe me. And\nmoreover, my dear child,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"I am making use of the\nprivilege conceded to me by your guardian.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, sir,\" said Raoul.\n\nD'Artagnan rose, and taking a letter from his writing-desk, presented\nit to Raoul. The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his\neyes upon the paper.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu!\" he said, raising his fine eyes to D'Artagnan, moist with\ntears, \"the count has left Paris without seeing me?\"\n\n\"He left four days ago,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger,\nperhaps death.\"\n\n\"He--he--incur danger of death! No, be not anxious; he is traveling\non business and will return ere long. I hope you have no repugnance to\naccept me as your guardian in the interim.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Raoul, \"you are such a brave\ngentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you!\"\n\n\"Eh! Egad! love me too; I will not torment you much, but only on\ncondition that you become a Frondist, my young friend, and a hearty\nFrondist, too.\"\n\n\"But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse?\"\n\n\"I should say you could! and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville;\nand if the worthy Broussel were there, whom you so stupidly helped\narrest, I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him\non both cheeks.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I will obey you, although I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"It is unnecessary for you to understand. Hold,\" continued D'Artagnan,\nturning toward the door, which had just opened, \"here is Monsieur du\nVallon, who comes with his coat torn.\"\n\n\"Yes, but in exchange,\" said Porthos, covered with perspiration and\nsoiled by dust, \"in exchange, I have torn many skins. Those wretches\nwanted to take away my sword! Deuce take 'em, what a popular commotion!\"\ncontinued the giant, in his quiet manner; \"but I knocked down more than\ntwenty with the hilt of Balizarde. A draught of wine, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll answer for you,\" said the Gascon, filling Porthos's glass to\nthe brim; \"but when you have drunk, give me your opinion.\"\n\n\"Upon what?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Look here,\" resumed D'Artagnan; \"here is Monsieur de Bragelonne, who\ndetermined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had\ngreat difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comminges.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Porthos; \"and his guardian, what would he have said to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Do you hear?\" interrupted D'Artagnan; \"become a Frondist, my friend,\nbelong to the Fronde, and remember that I fill the count's place in\neverything;\" and he jingled his money.\n\n\"Will you come?\" said he to Porthos.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Porthos, filling a second glass of wine.\n\n\"To present our respects to the cardinal.\"\n\nPorthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he\nhad imbibed the first, took his beaver and followed D'Artagnan. As\nfor Raoul, he remained bewildered with what he had seen, having been\nforbidden by D'Artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over.\n\n\n\n\n45. The Beggar of St. Eustache.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal\nhe would give Comminges time to arrive before him, and consequently\nto make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he,\nD'Artagnan, and his friend had rendered to the queen's party in the\nmorning.\n\nThey were indeed admirably received by Mazarin, who paid them numerous\ncompliments, and announced that they were more than half on their way to\nobtain what they desired, namely, D'Artagnan his captaincy, Porthos his\nbarony.\n\nD'Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk, for\nhe knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform.\nBut, though he held the cardinal's promises as of little worth, he\naffected to be completely satisfied, for he was unwilling to discourage\nPorthos.\n\nWhilst the two friends were with the cardinal, the queen sent for him.\nMazarin, thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of\nhis two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen,\nmotioned them to follow him. D'Artagnan and Porthos pointed to their\ndusty and torn dresses, but the cardinal shook his head.\n\n\"Those costumes,\" he said, \"are of more worth than most of those which\nyou will see on the backs of the queen's courtiers; they are costumes of\nbattle.\"\n\nD'Artagnan and Porthos obeyed. The court of Anne of Austria was full\nof gayety and animation; for, after having gained a victory over the\nSpaniard, it had just gained another over the people. Broussel had been\nconducted out of Paris without further resistance, and was at this time\nin the prison of Saint Germain; while Blancmesnil, who was arrested\nat the same time, but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or\nnoise, was safe in the Castle of Vincennes.\n\nComminges was near the queen, who was questioning him upon the details\nof his expedition, and every one was listening to his account, when\nD'Artagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door, behind the cardinal.\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" said Comminges, hastening to D'Artagnan, \"here is one who\ncan tell you better than myself, for he was my protector. Without him\nI should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint\nCloud, for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the\nriver. Speak, D'Artagnan, speak.\"\n\nD'Artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen\nsince he had become lieutenant of the musketeers, but her majesty had\nnever once spoken to him.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" at last said Anne of Austria, \"you are silent, after\nrendering such a service?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I have nought to say, save that my life\nis ever at your majesty's service, and that I shall only be happy the\nday I lose it for you.\"\n\n\"I know that, sir; I have known that,\" said the queen, \"a long time;\ntherefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude\nand my esteem.\"\n\n\"Permit me, madame,\" said D'Artagnan, \"to reserve a portion for my\nfriend; like myself\" (he laid an emphasis on these words) \"an ancient\nmusketeer of the company of Treville; he has done wonders.\"\n\n\"His name?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"In the regiment,\" said D'Artagnan, \"he is called Porthos\" (the queen\nstarted), \"but his true name is the Chevalier du Vallon.\"\n\n\"De Bracieux de Pierrefonds,\" added Porthos.\n\n\"These names are too numerous for me to remember them all, and I will\ncontent myself with the first,\" said the queen, graciously. Porthos\nbowed. At this moment the coadjutor was announced; a cry of surprise ran\nthrough the royal assemblage. Although the coadjutor had preached that\nsame morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the\nFronde; and Mazarin, in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make\nhis nephew preach, had evidently had the intention of administering to\nMonsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving.\n\nThe fact was, in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event\nof the day. Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had\nnot gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him\nthe advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship\nwas but a stepping-stone. Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop\nin his uncle's place, and cardinal, like Mazarin; and the popular party\ncould with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal. He therefore\nhastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of\nLens, determined beforehand to act with or against the court, as his\ncongratulations were well or ill received.\n\nThe coadjutor possessed, perhaps, as much wit as all those put together\nwho were assembled at the court to laugh at him. His speech, therefore,\nwas so well turned, that in spite of the great wish felt by the\ncourtiers to laugh, they could find no point on which to vent their\nridicule. He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at\nher majesty's command.\n\nDuring the whole time he was speaking, the queen appeared to be well\npleased with the coadjutor's harangue; but terminating as it did with\nsuch a phrase, the only one which could be caught at by the jokers,\nAnne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites, which\nannounced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies.\nImmediately the wits of the court plunged into satire. Nogent-Beautin,\nthe fool of the court, exclaimed that \"the queen was very happy to have\nthe succor of religion at such a moment.\" This caused a universal burst\nof laughter. The Count de Villeroy said that \"he did not know how any\nfear could be entertained for a moment, when the court had, to defend\nitself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris, his holiness\nthe coadjutor, who by a signal could raise an army of curates, church\nporters and vergers.\"\n\nThe Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should\nappear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be\ndistinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat, as Henry IV. had been\ndistinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry.\n\nDuring this storm, Gondy, who had it in his power to make it most\nunpleasant for the jesters, remained calm and stern. The queen at last\nasked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just\nmade to her.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the coadjutor; \"I have to beg you to reflect\ntwice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom.\"\n\nThe queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced.\n\nThe coadjutor bowed and left the palace, casting upon the cardinal such\na glance as is best understood by mortal foes. That glance was so\nsharp that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin, who, reading in it a\ndeclaration of war, seized D'Artagnan by the arm and said:\n\n\"If occasion requires, monsieur, you will remember that man who has just\ngone out, will you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" he replied. Then, turning toward Porthos, \"The devil!\"\nsaid he, \"this has a bad look. I dislike these quarrels among men of the\nchurch.\"\n\nGondy withdrew, distributing benedictions on his way, and finding a\nmalicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate\nthemselves at his feet.\n\n\"Oh!\" he murmured, as he left the threshold of the palace: \"ungrateful\ncourt! faithless court! cowardly court! I will teach you how to laugh\nto-morrow--but in another manner.\"\n\nBut whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal,\nto increase the hilarity of the queen, Mazarin, a man of sense, and\nwhose fear, moreover, gave him foresight, lost no time in making idle\nand dangerous jokes; he went out after the coadjutor, settled his\naccount, locked up his gold, and had confidential workmen to contrive\nhiding places in his walls.\n\nOn his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come\nin after his departure and was waiting for him; he started with delight\nwhen, on demanding the name of this young man, he learned that it was\nLouvieres. He hastened to his cabinet. Broussel's son was there, still\nfurious, and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the\nking's officers. The only precaution he had taken in coming to the\narchbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend.\n\nThe coadjutor went to him and held out his hand. The young man gazed at\nhim as if he would have read the secret of his heart.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Louvieres,\" said the coadjutor, \"believe me, I am\ntruly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you.\"\n\n\"Is that true, and do you speak seriously?\" asked Louvieres.\n\n\"From the depth of my heart,\" said Gondy.\n\n\"In that case, my lord, the time for words has passed and the hour for\naction is at hand; my lord, in three days, if you wish it, my father\nwill be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal.\"\n\nThe coadjutor started.\n\n\"Oh! let us speak frankly,\" continued Louvieres, \"and act in a\nstraightforward manner. Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given, as\nyou have done for the last six months, out of pure Christian charity;\nthat would be too grand. You are ambitious--it is natural; you are a man\nof genius and you know your worth. As for me, I hate the court and have\nbut one desire at this moment--vengeance. Give us the clergy and the\npeople, of whom you can dispose, and I will bring you the citizens and\nthe parliament; with these four elements Paris is ours in a week; and\nbelieve me, monsieur coadjutor, the court will give from fear what it\nwill not give from good-will.\"\n\nIt was now the coadjutor's turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres.\n\n\"But, Monsieur Louvieres, are you aware that it is simply civil war you\nare proposing to me?\"\n\n\"You have been preparing long enough, my lord, for it to be welcome to\nyou now.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the coadjutor; \"you must be well aware that this\nrequires reflection.\"\n\n\"And how many hours of reflection do you ask?\"\n\n\"Twelve hours, sir; is it too long?\"\n\n\"It is now noon; at midnight I will be at your house.\"\n\n\"If I should not be in, wait for me.\"\n\n\"Good! at midnight, my lord.\"\n\n\"At midnight, my dear Monsieur Louvieres.\"\n\nWhen once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he\nhad any connection to his house. Two hours later, thirty officiating\nministers from the most populous, and consequently the most disturbed\nparishes of Paris had assembled there. Gondy related to them the insults\nhe had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin,\nthe Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie. The curates asked\nhim what was to be done.\n\n\"Simply this,\" said the coadjutor. \"You are the directors of all\nconsciences. Well, undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect\nand fear of kings; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant; and\nrepeat often and loudly, so that all may know it, that the misfortunes\nof France are caused by Mazarin, her lover and her destroyer; begin this\nwork to-day, this instant even, and in three days I shall expect the\nresult. For the rest, if any one of you have further or better counsel\nto expound, I will listen to him with the greatest pleasure.\"\n\nThree curates remained--those of St. Merri, St. Sulpice and St.\nEustache. The others withdrew.\n\n\"You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your\nbrothers?\" said Gondy.\n\n\"We hope so,\" answered the curates.\n\n\"Let us hear. Monsieur de St. Merri, you begin.\"\n\n\"My lord, I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Who and what is this man?\"\n\n\"A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards, who has great influence upon the\ncommerce of his quarter.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"He is named Planchet, who himself also caused a rising about six weeks\nago; but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared.\"\n\n\"And can you find him?\"\n\n\"I hope so. I think he has not been arrested, and as I am his wife's\nconfessor, if she knows where he is I shall know it too.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir, find this man, and when you have found him bring him to\nme.\"\n\n\"We will be with you at six o'clock, my lord.\"\n\n\"Go, my dear curate, and may God assist you!\"\n\n\"And you, sir?\" continued Gondy, turning to the curate of St. Sulpice.\n\n\"I, my lord,\" said the latter, \"I know a man who has rendered great\nservices to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader\nof revolt. Him I can place at your disposal; it is Count de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"I know him also, but unfortunately he is not in Paris.\"\n\n\"My lord, he has been for three days at the Rue Cassette.\"\n\n\"And wherefore has he not been to see me?\"\n\n\"He was told--my lord will pardon me----\"\n\n\"Certainly, speak.\"\n\n\"That your lordship was about to treat with the court.\"\n\nGondy bit his lips.\n\n\"They are mistaken; bring him here at eight o'clock, sir, and may Heaven\nbless you as I bless you!\"\n\n\"And now 'tis your turn,\" said the coadjutor, turning to the last that\nremained; \"have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen\nwho have left us?\"\n\n\"Better, my lord.\"\n\n\"Diable! think what a solemn engagement you are making; one has offered\na wealthy shopkeeper, the other a count; you are going, then, to offer a\nprince, are you?\"\n\n\"I offer you a beggar, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Gondy, reflecting, \"you are right, sir; some one who\ncould raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris;\nsome one who would know how to cry aloud to them, that all France might\nhear it, that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty.\"\n\n\"Exactly your man.\"\n\n\"Bravo! and the man?\"\n\n\"A plain and simple beggar, as I have said, my lord, who asks for alms,\nas he gives holy water; a practice he has carried on for six years on\nthe steps of St. Eustache.\"\n\n\"And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers?\"\n\n\"Are you aware, my lord, that mendacity is an organized body, a kind of\nassociation of those who have nothing against those who have everything;\nan association in which every one takes his share; one that elects a\nleader?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have heard it said,\" replied the coadjutor.\n\n\"Well, the man whom I offer you is a general syndic.\"\n\n\"And what do you know of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing, my lord, except that he is tormented with remorse.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"On the twenty-eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the\nrepose of the soul of one who died a violent death; yesterday I said\nthis mass again.\"\n\n\"And his name?\"\n\n\"Maillard; but I do not think it is his right one.\"\n\n\"And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Let us go and see your beggar, sir, and if he is such as you describe\nhim, you are right--it will be you who have discovered the true\ntreasure.\"\n\nGondy dressed himself as an officer, put on a felt cap with a red\nfeather, hung on a long sword, buckled spurs to his boots, wrapped\nhimself in an ample cloak and followed the curate.\n\nThe coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying\nbetween the archbishopric and the St. Eustache Church, watching\ncarefully to ascertain the popular feeling. The people were in an\nexcited mood, but, like a swarm of frightened bees, seemed not to know\nat what point to concentrate; and it was very evident that if leaders of\nthe people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle\nbuzzing.\n\nOn arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires, the curate pointed toward the\nsquare before the church.\n\n\"Stop!\" he said, \"there he is at his post.\"\n\nGondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a\nchair and leaning against one of the moldings; a little basin was near\nhim and he held a holy water brush in his hand.\n\n\"Is it by permission that he remains there?\" asked Gondy.\n\n\"No, my lord; these places are bought. I believe this man paid his\npredecessor a hundred pistoles for his.\"\n\n\"The rascal is rich, then?\"\n\n\"Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty-five\nand thirty thousand francs and sometimes more.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said Gondy, laughing; \"I was not aware my alms were so well\ninvested.\"\n\nIn the meantime they were advancing toward the square, and the moment\nthe coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the\nmendicant arose and proffered his brush.\n\nHe was a man between sixty-six and sixty-eight years of age, little,\nrather stout, with gray hair and light eyes. His countenance denoted the\nstruggle between two opposite principles--a wicked nature, subdued by\ndetermination, perhaps by repentance.\n\nHe started on seeing the cavalier with the curate. The latter and the\ncoadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the\nsign of the cross; the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat,\nwhich was on the ground.\n\n\"Maillard,\" began the curate, \"this gentleman and I have come to talk\nwith you a little.\"\n\n\"With me!\" said the mendicant; \"it is a great honor for a poor\ndistributor of holy water.\"\n\nThere was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite\ndisguise and which astonished the coadjutor.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the curate, apparently accustomed to this tone, \"yes,\nwe wish to know your opinion of the events of to-day and what you have\nheard said by people going in and out of the church.\"\n\nThe mendicant shook his head.\n\n\"These are melancholy doings, your reverence, which always fall again\nupon the poor. As to what is said, everybody is discontented, everybody\ncomplains, but 'everybody' means 'nobody.'\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, my good friend,\" said the coadjutor.\n\n\"I mean that all these cries, all these complaints, these curses,\nproduce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all; but the\nlightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Gondy, \"you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man;\nare you disposed to take a part in a little civil war, should we have\none, and put at the command of the leader, should we find one, your\npersonal influence and the influence you have acquired over your\ncomrades?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, provided this war were approved of by the church and would\nadvance the end I wish to attain--I mean, the remission of my sins.\"\n\n\"The war will not only be approved of, but directed by the church. As\nfor the remission of your sins, we have the archbishop of Paris, who has\nthe very greatest power at the court of Rome, and even the coadjutor,\nwho possesses some plenary indulgences; we will recommend you to him.\"\n\n\"Consider, Maillard,\" said the curate, \"that I have recommended you\nto this gentleman, who is a powerful lord, and that I have made myself\nresponsible for you.\"\n\n\"I know, monsieur le cure,\" said the beggar, \"that you have always been\nvery kind to me, and therefore I, in my turn, will be serviceable to\nyou.\"\n\n\"And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le\ncure told me it was just now?\"\n\n\"I think they have some esteem for me,\" said the mendicant with pride,\n\"and that not only will they obey me, but wherever I go they will follow\nme.\"\n\n\"And could you count on fifty resolute men, good, unemployed, but active\nsouls, brawlers, capable of bringing down the walls of the Palais Royal\nby crying, 'Down with Mazarin,' as fell those at Jericho?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the beggar, \"I can undertake things more difficult and\nmore important than that.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah,\" said Gondy, \"you will undertake, then, some night, to throw up\nsome ten barricades?\"\n\n\"I will undertake to throw up fifty, and when the day comes, to defend\nthem.\"\n\n\"I'faith!\" exclaimed Gondy, \"you speak with a certainty that gives me\npleasure; and since monsieur le cure can answer for you----\"\n\n\"I answer for him,\" said the curate.\n\n\"Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold; make all your\narrangements, and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening\nat ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"It must be on some elevated place, whence a given signal may be seen in\nevery part of Paris.\"\n\n\"Shall I give you a line for the vicar of St. Jacques de la Boucherie?\nhe will let you into the rooms in his tower,\" said the curate.\n\n\"Capital,\" answered the mendicant.\n\n\"Then,\" said the coadjutor, \"this evening, at ten o'clock, and if I am\npleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your\ndisposal.\"\n\nThe eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity, but he quickly\nsuppressed his emotion.\n\n\"This evening, sir,\" he replied, \"all will be ready.\"\n\n\n\n\n46. The Tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.\n\n\n\nAt a quarter to six o'clock, Monsieur de Gondy, having finished his\nbusiness, returned to the archiepiscopal palace.\n\nAt six o'clock the curate of St. Merri was announced.\n\nThe coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by\nanother man. The curate then entered, followed by Planchet.\n\n\"Your holiness,\" said the curate, \"here is the person of whom I had the\nhonor to speak to you.\"\n\nPlanchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses.\n\n\"And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people?\" asked Gondy.\n\n\"Most undoubtedly,\" said Planchet. \"I am a Frondist from my heart. You\nsee in me, such as I am, a person sentenced to be hung.\"\n\n\"And on what account?\"\n\n\"I rescued from the hands of Mazarin's police a noble lord whom they\nwere conducting back to the Bastile, where he had been for five years.\"\n\n\"Will you name him?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know him well, my lord--it is Count de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"Ah! really, yes,\" said the coadjutor, \"I have heard this affair\nmentioned. You raised the whole district, so they told me!\"\n\n\"Very nearly,\" replied Planchet, with a self-satisfied air.\n\n\"And your business is----\"\n\n\"That of a confectioner, in the Rue des Lombards.\"\n\n\"Explain to me how it happens that, following so peaceful a business,\nyou had such warlike inclinations.\"\n\n\"Why does my lord, belonging to the church, now receive me in the dress\nof an officer, with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots?\"\n\n\"Not badly answered, i'faith,\" said Gondy, laughing; \"but I have, you\nmust know, always had, in spite of my bands, warlike inclinations.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, before I became a confectioner I myself was three years\nsergeant in the Piedmontese regiment, and before I became sergeant I was\nfor eighteen months the servant of Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"The lieutenant of musketeers?\" asked Gondy.\n\n\"Himself, my lord.\"\n\n\"But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" whistled Planchet.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Nothing, my lord; Monsieur d'Artagnan belongs to the service; Monsieur\nd'Artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal, who pays him,\nas much as we make it ours, we citizens, to attack him, whom he robs.\"\n\n\"You are an intelligent fellow, my friend; can we count upon you?\"\n\n\"You may count upon me, my lord, provided you want to make a complete\nupheaval of the city.\"\n\n\"'Tis that exactly. How many men, think you, you could collect together\nto-night?\"\n\n\"Two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds.\"\n\n\"Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by\nto-morrow we shall have quite a powerful army. Are you disposed to obey\nCount de Rochefort?\"\n\n\"I would follow him to hell, and that is saying not a little, as I\nbelieve him entirely capable of the descent.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\"\n\n\"By what sign to-morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from\nfoes?\"\n\n\"Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat.\"\n\n\"Good! Give the watchword.\"\n\n\"Do you want money?\"\n\n\"Money never comes amiss at any time, my lord; if one has it not,\none must do without it; with it, matters go on much better and more\nrapidly.\"\n\nGondy went to a box and drew forth a bag.\n\n\"Here are five hundred pistoles,\" he said; \"and if the action goes off\nwell you may reckon upon a similar sum to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship,\" said\nPlanchet, putting the bag under his arm.\n\n\"That is right; I recommend the cardinal to your attention.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy, he is in good hands.\"\n\nPlanchet went out, the curate remaining for a moment.\n\n\"Are you satisfied, my lord?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes; he appears to be a resolute fellow.\"\n\n\"Well, he will do more than he has promised.\"\n\n\"He will do wonders then.\"\n\nThe curate rejoined Planchet, who was waiting for him on the stairs. Ten\nminutes later the curate of St. Sulpice was announced. As soon as the\ndoor of Gondy's study was opened a man rushed in. It was the Count de\nRochefort.\n\n\"'Tis you, then, my dear count,\" cried Gondy, offering his hand.\n\n\"You have made up your mind at last, my lord?\" said Rochefort.\n\n\"It has been made up a long time,\" said Gondy.\n\n\"Let us say no more on the subject; you tell me so, I believe you. Well,\nwe are going to give a ball to Mazarin.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"And when will the dance begin?\"\n\n\"The invitations are given for this evening,\" said the coadjutor, \"but\nthe violins will not begin to play until to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier\nd'Humieres has promised me whenever I need them.\"\n\n\"Upon fifty soldiers?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is making recruits and he will lend them to me; if any are\nmissing when the fete is over, I shall replace them.\"\n\n\"Good, my dear Rochefort; but that is not all. What have you done with\nMonsieur de Beaufort?\"\n\n\"He is in Vendome, where he will wait until I write to him to return to\nParis.\"\n\n\"Write to him; now's the time.\"\n\n\"You are sure of your enterprise?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he must make haste; for hardly will the people of Paris have\nrevolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them.\nIf he defers he will find the place of honor taken.\"\n\n\"Shall I send word to him as coming from you?\"\n\n\"Yes certainly.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell him that he can count on you?\"\n\n\"To the end.\"\n\n\"And you will leave the command to him?\"\n\n\"Of the war, yes, but in politics----\"\n\n\"You must know it is not his element.\"\n\n\"He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal's hat in my own fashion.\"\n\n\"You care about it, then, so much?\"\n\n\"Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me,\"\nsaid Gondy, \"I wish at least that the hat should be red.\"\n\n\"One must not dispute matters of taste and colors,\" said Rochefort,\nlaughing. \"I answer for his consent.\"\n\n\"How soon can he be here?\"\n\n\"In five days.\"\n\n\"Let him come and he will find a change, I will answer for it.\"\n\n\"Therefore, go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in\nreadiness.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For everything.\"\n\n\"Is there any signal for the general rally?\"\n\n\"A knot of straw in the hat.\"\n\n\"Very good. Adieu, my lord.\"\n\n\"Adieu, my dear Rochefort.\"\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur Mazarin, Monsieur Mazarin,\" said Rochefort, leading off\nhis curate, who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word\nduring the foregoing dialogue, \"you will see whether I am too old to be\na man of action.\"\n\nIt was half-past nine o'clock and the coadjutor required half an hour\nto go from the archbishop's palace to the tower of St. Jacques de la\nBoucherie. He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest\nwindows of the tower. \"Good,\" said he, \"our syndic is at his post.\"\n\nHe knocked and the door was opened. The vicar himself awaited him,\nconducted him to the top of the tower, and when there pointed to a\nlittle door, placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner\nof the wall, that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return,\nand went down again. Although the key was in the door the coadjutor\nknocked.\n\n\"Come in,\" said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant,\nwhom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed. He rose on the entrance of\nthe coadjutor, and at that moment ten o'clock struck.\n\n\"Well,\" said Gondy, \"have you kept your word with me?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" replied the mendicant.\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"You asked me for five hundred men, did you not? Well, I have ten\nthousand for you.\"\n\n\"You are not boasting?\"\n\n\"Do you wish for a proof?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThere were three candles alight, each of which burnt before a window,\none looking upon the city, the other upon the Palais Royal, and a third\nupon the Rue Saint Denis.\n\nThe man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after\nthe other.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the coadjutor.\n\n\"I have given the signal.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For the barricades. When you leave this you will behold my men at work.\nOnly take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain\nor your neck by falling in a hole.\"\n\n\"Good! there is your money, the same sum as that you have received\nalready. Now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink.\"\n\n\"For twenty years I have tasted nothing but water.\"\n\nThe man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor, who heard the\nsound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the coadjutor, \"you are avaricious, my good fellow.\"\n\nThe mendicant sighed and threw down the bag.\n\n\"Must I always be the same?\" said he, \"and shall I never succeed in\novercoming the old leaven? Oh, misery, oh, vanity!\"\n\n\"You take it, however.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I make hereby a vow in your presence, to employ all that\nremains to me in pious works.\"\n\nHis face was pale and drawn, like that of a man who had just undergone\nsome inward struggle.\n\n\"Singular man!\" muttered Gondy, taking his hat to go away; but on\nturning around he saw the beggar between him and the door. His first\nidea was that this man intended to do him some harm, but on the contrary\nhe saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped.\n\n\"Your blessing, your holiness, before you go, I beseech you!\" he cried.\n\n\"Your holiness!\" said Gondy; \"my friend, you take me for some one else.\"\n\n\"No, your holiness, I take you for what you are, that is to say, the\ncoadjutor; I recognized you at the first glance.\"\n\nGondy smiled. \"And you want my blessing?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I have need of it.\"\n\nThe mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility, such\nearnest repentance, that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his\nbenediction with all the unction of which he was capable.\n\n\"Now,\" said Gondy, \"there is a communion between us. I have blessed you\nand you are sacred to me. Come, have you committed some crime, pursued\nby human justice, from which I can protect you?\"\n\nThe beggar shook his head. \"The crime which I have committed, my lord,\nhas no call upon human justice, and you can only deliver me from it by\nblessing me frequently, as you have just done.\"\n\n\"Come, be candid,\" said the coadjutor, \"you have not all your life\nfollowed the trade which you do now?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. I have pursued it for six years only.\"\n\n\"And previously, where were you?\"\n\n\"In the Bastile.\"\n\n\"And before you went to the Bastile?\"\n\n\"I will tell you, my lord, on the day when you are willing to hear my\nconfession.\"\n\n\"Good! At whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself,\nremember that I shall be ready to give you absolution.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" said the mendicant in a hoarse voice. \"But I am\nnot yet ready to receive it.\"\n\n\"Very well. Adieu.\"\n\n\"Adieu, your holiness,\" said the mendicant, opening the door and bending\nlow before the prelate.\n\n\n\n\n47. The Riot.\n\n\n\nIt was about eleven o'clock at night. Gondy had not walked a hundred\nsteps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the\nstreets of Paris.\n\nThe whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings; silent shadows\nwere seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great\nwagons, whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole\nregiments of horsemen. These active beings flitted here and there like\nso many demons completing some unknown labor; these were the beggars\nof the Court of Miracles--the agents of the giver of holy water in the\nSquare of Saint Eustache, preparing barricades for the morrow.\n\nGondy gazed on these deeds of darkness, on these nocturnal laborers,\nwith a kind of fear; he asked himself, if, after having called forth\nthese foul creatures from their dens, he should have the power of making\nthem retire again. He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of\nthese beings happened to approach him. He reached the Rue Saint Honore\nand went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie; there the aspect\nchanged; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop;\ntheir doors seemed closed like their shutters, but they were only pushed\nto in such a manner as to open and allow the men, who seemed fearful of\nshowing what they carried, to enter, closing immediately. These men were\nshopkeepers, who had arms to lend to those who had none.\n\nOne individual went from door to door, bending under the weight of\nswords, guns, muskets and every kind of weapon, which he deposited as\nfast as he could. By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized\nPlanchet.\n\nThe coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la\nMonnaie; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or\ngray, according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie.\nThey were standing motionless, while single men passed from one group\nto another. All these cloaks, gray or black, were raised behind by the\npoint of a sword, or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket.\n\nOn reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a\nman approached him.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the man. \"I do not know you for one of us.\"\n\n\"Then it is because you do not know your friends, my dear Monsieur\nLouvieres,\" said the coadjutor, raising his hat.\n\nLouvieres recognized him and bowed.\n\nGondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle. There he\nsaw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls. They might be\nsaid to be a procession of ghosts, for they were all wrapped in white\ncloaks. When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be\nannihilated, one after the other, as if the earth had opened under their\nfeet. Gondy, edged into a corner, saw them vanish from the first until\nthe last but one. The last raised his eyes, to ascertain, doubtless,\nthat neither his companions nor himself had been watched, and, in spite\nof the darkness, he perceived Gondy. He walked straight up to him and\nplaced a pistol to his throat.\n\n\"Halloo! Monsieur de Rochefort,\" said Gondy, laughing, \"are you a boy to\nplay with firearms?\"\n\nRochefort recognized the voice.\n\n\"Ah, it is you, my lord!\" said he.\n\n\"The very same. What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the\nearth?\"\n\n\"My fifty recruits from the Chevalier d'Humieres, who are destined to\nenter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their\nequipment their white cloaks.\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\"\n\n\"To the house of one of my friends, a sculptor, only we enter by the\ntrap through which he lets down his marble.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Gondy, shaking Rochefort by the hand, who descended in\nhis turn and closed the trap after him.\n\nIt was now one o'clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned\nhome. He opened a window and leaned out to listen. A strange,\nincomprehensible, unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city;\none felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the\nstreets, now dark as ocean's most unfathomable caves. From time to time\na dull sound was heard, like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the\nsea; but nothing clear, nothing distinct, nothing intelligible; it was\nlike those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake.\n\nThe work of revolt continued the whole night thus. The next morning, on\nawaking, Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance. It was\nlike a besieged town. Armed men, shouldering muskets, watched over the\nbarricades with menacing looks; words of command, patrols, arrests,\nexecutions, even, were encountered at every step. Those bearing plumed\nhats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry, \"Long live Broussel!\"\n\"Down with Mazarin!\" and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony\nwas hooted at, spat upon and even beaten. They had not yet begun\nto slay, but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not\nwanting.\n\nThe barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais Royal. From the\nRue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie, from the Rue Saint\nThomas-du-Louvre to the Pont Neuf, from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte\nSaint Honore, there were more than ten thousand armed men; those who\nwere at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the\nregiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal, the gates of which\nwere closed behind them, a precaution which made their situation\nprecarious. Among these thousands moved, in bands numbering from one\nhundred to two hundred, pale and haggard men, clothed in rags, who\nbore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words: \"Behold the\nmisery of the people!\" Wherever these men passed, frenzied cries were\nheard; and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be\nheard in all directions.\n\nThe astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it\nwas announced to them that the city, which the previous evening they\nhad left entirely tranquil, had awakened to such feverish commotion; nor\nwould either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought\nto them, declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own\neyes and ears. Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they\nwere convinced.\n\nMazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace;\nbut he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet, trembling all over,\nlocked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds\non his fingers. As for the queen, furious, and left to her own guidance,\nshe went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as\nmany men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this\npleasantry.\n\nThe marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate\nat nothing; and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army\nofficers usually profess. He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted\nto go out by the Pont du Louvre, but there he met Rochefort and his\nfifty horsemen, attended by more than five hundred men. The marshal made\nno attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay. But at\nPont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois. This time the marshal\ncharged, but he was welcomed by musket shots, while stones fell like\nhail from all the windows. He left there three men.\n\nHe beat a retreat toward the market, but there he met Planchet with\nhis halberdiers; their halberds were leveled at him threateningly. He\nattempted to ride over those gray cloaks, but the gray cloaks held their\nground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore, leaving four\nof his guards dead on the field of battle.\n\nThe marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore, but there he was opposed\nby the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache. They were guarded,\nnot only by armed men, but even by women and children. Master Friquet,\nthe owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him, had\norganized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous\nracket.\n\nThe marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others\nand determined to break through it. He dismounted twenty men to make\na breach in the barricade, whilst he and others, remaining on their\nhorses, were to protect the assailants. The twenty men marched\nstraight toward the barrier, but from behind the beams, from among the\nwagon-wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade\nburst forth and at the same time Planchet's halberdiers appeared at the\ncorner of the Cemetery of the Innocents, and Louvieres's bourgeois at\nthe corner of the Rue de la Monnaie.\n\nThe Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires, but he was\nbrave and made up his mind to die where he was. He returned blow for\nblow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd. The guards,\nmore skillful, did greater execution; but the bourgeois, more numerous,\noverwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron. Men fell around\nhim as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida. Fontrailles, his\naide-de-camp, had an arm broken; his horse had received a bullet in\nhis neck and he had difficulty in controlling him, maddened by pain.\nIn short, he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a\nshudder in their veins, when suddenly, in the direction of the Rue de\nl'Arbre-Sec, the crowd opened, crying: \"Long live the coadjutor!\" and\nGondy, in surplice and cloak, appeared, moving tranquilly in the midst\nof the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left,\nas undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu.\n\nAll fell to their knees. The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet\nhim.\n\n\"Get me out of this, in Heaven's name!\" he said, \"or I shall leave my\ncarcass here and those of all my men.\"\n\nA great tumult arose, in the midst of which even the noise of thunder\ncould not have been heard. Gondy raised his hand and demanded silence.\nAll were still.\n\n\"My children,\" he said, \"this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie, as to\nwhose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself, on\nreturning to the Louvre, to demand of the queen, in your name, our\nBroussel's release. You pledge yourself to that, marshal?\" added Gondy,\nturning to La Meilleraie.\n\n\"Morbleu!\" cried the latter, \"I should say that I do pledge myself to\nit! I had no hope of getting off so easily.\"\n\n\"He gives you his word of honor,\" said Gondy.\n\nThe marshal raised his hand in token of assent.\n\n\"Long live the coadjutor!\" cried the crowd. Some voices even added:\n\"Long live the marshal!\" But all took up the cry in chorus: \"Down with\nMazarin!\"\n\nThe crowd gave place, the barricade was opened, and the marshal, with\nthe remnant of his company, retreated, preceded by Friquet and his\nbandits, some of them making a presence of beating drums and others\nimitating the sound of the trumpet. It was almost a triumphal\nprocession; only, behind the guards the barricades were closed again.\nThe marshal bit his fingers.\n\nIn the meantime, as we have said, Mazarin was in his closet, putting\nhis affairs in order. He called for D'Artagnan, but in the midst of such\ntumult he little expected to see him, D'Artagnan not being on service.\nIn about ten minutes D'Artagnan appeared at the door, followed by the\ninseparable Porthos.\n\n\"Ah, come in, come in, Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried the cardinal, \"and\nwelcome your friend too. But what is going on in this accursed Paris?\"\n\n\"What is going on, my lord? nothing good,\" replied D'Artagnan, shaking\nhis head. \"The town is in open revolt, and just now, as I was crossing\nthe Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon, who is here, and is your\nhumble servant, they wanted in spite of my uniform, or perhaps because\nof my uniform, to make us cry 'Long live Broussel!' and must I tell you,\nmy lord what they wished us to cry as well?\"\n\n\"Speak, speak.\"\n\n\"'Down with Mazarin!' I'faith, the treasonable word is out.\"\n\nMazarin smiled, but became very pale.\n\n\"And you did cry?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'faith, no,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I was not in voice; Monsieur du Vallon\nhas a cold and did not cry either. Then, my lord----\"\n\n\"Then what?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"Look at my hat and cloak.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his\nbeaver. As for Porthos's coat, a blow from a halberd had cut it open on\nthe flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two.\n\n\"Diavolo!\" said the cardinal, pensively gazing at the two friends with\nlively admiration; \"I should have cried, I should.\"\n\nAt this moment the tumult was heard nearer.\n\nMazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him. He had a great desire\nto go to the window, but he dared not.\n\n\"See what is going on, Monsieur D'Artagnan,\" said he.\n\nD'Artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure. \"Oho!\"\nsaid he, \"what is this? Marechal de la Meilleraie returning without\na hat--Fontrailles with his arm in a sling--wounded guards--horses\nbleeding; eh, then, what are the sentinels about? They are aiming--they\nare going to fire!\"\n\n\"They have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach\nthe Palais Royal!\" exclaimed Mazarin.\n\n\"But if they fire, all is lost!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"We have the gates.\"\n\n\"The gates! to hold for five minutes--the gates, they will be torn down,\ntwisted into iron wire, ground to powder! God's death, don't fire!\"\nscreamed D'Artagnan, throwing open the window.\n\nIn spite of this recommendation, which, owing to the noise, could\nscarcely have been heard, two or three musket shots resounded, succeeded\nby a terrible discharge. The balls might be heard peppering the facade\nof the Palais Royal, and one of them, passing under D'Artagnan's arm,\nentered and broke a mirror, in which Porthos was complacently admiring\nhimself.\n\n\"Alack! alack!\" cried the cardinal, \"a Venetian glass!\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, quietly shutting the window, \"it is not\nworth while weeping yet, for probably an hour hence there will not\nbe one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal, whether they be\nVenetian or Parisian.\"\n\n\"But what do you advise, then?\" asked Mazarin, trembling.\n\n\"Eh, egad, to give up Broussel as they demand! What the devil do\nyou want with a member of the parliament? He is of no earthly use to\nanybody.\"\n\n\"And you, Monsieur du Vallon, is that your advice? What would you do?\"\n\n\"I should give up Broussel,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Come, come with me, gentlemen!\" exclaimed Mazarin. \"I will go and\ndiscuss the matter with the queen.\"\n\nHe stopped at the end of the corridor and said:\n\n\"I can count upon you, gentlemen, can I not?\"\n\n\"We do not give ourselves twice over,\" said D'Artagnan; \"we have given\nourselves to you; command, we shall obey.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Mazarin; \"enter this cabinet and wait till I\ncome back.\"\n\nAnd turning off he entered the drawing-room by another door.\n\n\n\n\n48. The Riot becomes a Revolution.\n\n\n\nThe closet into which D'Artagnan and Porthos had been ushered was\nseparated from the drawing-room where the queen was by tapestried\ncurtains only, and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that\npassed in the adjoining room, whilst the aperture between the two\nhangings, small as it was, permitted them to see.\n\nThe queen was standing in the room, pale with anger; her self-control,\nhowever, was so great that it might have been imagined that she was\ncalm. Comminges, Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women\nagain were behind the men. The Chancellor Sequier, who twenty years\npreviously had persecuted her so ruthlessly, stood before her, relating\nhow his carriage had been smashed, how he had been pursued and had\nrushed into the Hotel d'O----, that the hotel was immediately invaded,\npillaged and devastated; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden\nbehind tapestry, in which he was secreted by an old woman, together with\nhis brother, the Bishop of Meaux. Then the danger was so imminent, the\nrioters came so near, uttering such threats, that the chancellor thought\nhis last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest,\nso as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered. Fortunately,\nhowever, he had not been taken; the people, believing that he had\nescaped by some back entrance, retired and left him at liberty to\nretreat. Then, disguised in he clothes of the Marquis d'O----, he had\nleft the hotel, stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards\nwho had been killed whilst defending the street door.\n\nDuring the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the\nqueen to listen.\n\n\"Well,\" said the queen, when the chancellor had finished speaking; \"what\ndo you think of it all?\"\n\n\"I think that matters look very gloomy, madame.\"\n\n\"But what step would you propose to me?\"\n\n\"I could propose one to your majesty, but I dare not.\"\n\n\"You may, you may, sir,\" said the queen with a bitter smile; \"you were\nnot so timid once.\"\n\nThe chancellor reddened and stammered some words.\n\n\"It is not a question of the past, but of the present,\" said the queen;\n\"you said you could give me advice--what is it?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the chancellor, hesitating, \"it would be to release\nBroussel.\"\n\nThe queen, although already pale, became visibly paler and her face was\ncontracted.\n\n\"Release Broussel!\" she cried, \"never!\"\n\nAt this moment steps were heard in the ante-room and without any\nannouncement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door.\n\n\"Ah, there you are, marechal,\" cried Anne of Austria joyfully. \"I trust\nyou have brought this rabble to reason.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied the marechal, \"I have left three men on the Pont Neuf,\nfour at the Halle, six at the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre-Sec and two\nat the door of your palace--fifteen in all. I have brought away ten\nor twelve wounded. I know not where I have left my hat, and in all\nprobability I should have been left with my hat, had the coadjutor not\narrived in time to rescue me.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said the queen, \"it would have much astonished me if that\nlow cur, with his distorted legs, had not been mixed up with all this.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said La Meilleraie, \"do not say too much against him before\nme, for the service he rendered me is still fresh.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the queen, \"be as grateful as you like, it does not\nimplicate me; you are here safe and sound, that is all I wished for; you\nare not only welcome, but welcome back.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; but I only came back on one condition--that I would\ntransmit to your majesty the will of the people.\"\n\n\"The will!\" exclaimed the queen, frowning. \"Oh! oh! monsieur marechal,\nyou must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken\nso strange a commission!\"\n\nThe irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the\nmarechal.\n\n\"Pardon, madame,\" he said, \"I am not a lawyer, I am a mere soldier,\nand probably, therefore, I do not quite comprehend the value of certain\nwords; I ought to have said the wishes, and not the will, of the\npeople. As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was\nafraid?\"\n\nThe queen smiled.\n\n\"Well, then, madame, yes, I did feel fear; and though I have been\nthrough twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and\nskirmishes, I own for the third time in my life I was afraid. Yes, and\nI would rather face your majesty, however threatening your smile, than\nface those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know\nnot whence, unless from deepest hell.\"\n\n(\"Bravo,\" said D'Artagnan in a whisper to Porthos; \"well answered.\")\n\n\"Well,\" said the queen, biting her lips, whilst her courtiers looked at\neach other with surprise, \"what is the desire of my people?\"\n\n\"That Broussel shall be given up to them, madame.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said the queen, \"never!\"\n\n\"Your majesty is mistress,\" said La Meilleraie, retreating a few steps.\n\n\"Where are you going, marechal?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"To give your majesty's reply to those who await it.\"\n\n\"Stay, marechal; I will not appear to parley with rebels.\"\n\n\"Madame, I have pledged my word, and unless you order me to be arrested\nI shall be forced to return.\"\n\nAnne of Austria's eyes shot glances of fire.\n\n\"Oh! that is no impediment, sir,\" said she; \"I have had greater men than\nyou arrested--Guitant!\"\n\nMazarin sprang forward.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"if I dared in my turn advise----\"\n\n\"Would it be to give up Broussel, sir? If so, you can spare yourself the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mazarin; \"although, perhaps, that counsel is as good as any\nother.\"\n\n\"Then what may it be?\"\n\n\"To call for monsieur le coadjuteur.\"\n\n\"The coadjutor!\" cried the queen, \"that dreadful mischief maker! It is\nhe who has raised all this revolt.\"\n\n\"The more reason,\" said Mazarin; \"if he has raised it he can put it\ndown.\"\n\n\"And hold, madame,\" suggested Comminges, who was near a window, out of\nwhich he could see; \"hold, the moment is a happy one, for there he is\nnow, giving his blessing in the square of the Palais Royal.\"\n\nThe queen sprang to the window.\n\n\"It is true,\" she said, \"the arch hypocrite--see!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Mazarin, \"that everybody kneels before him, although he\nbe but coadjutor, whilst I, were I in his place, though I am cardinal,\nshould be torn to pieces. I persist, then, madame, in my wish\" (he\nlaid an emphasis on the word), \"that your majesty should receive the\ncoadjutor.\"\n\n\"And wherefore do you not say, like the rest, your will?\" replied the\nqueen, in a low voice.\n\nMazarin bowed.\n\n\"Monsieur le marechal,\" said the queen, after a moment's reflection, \"go\nand find the coadjutor and bring him to me.\"\n\n\"And what shall I say to the people?\"\n\n\"That they must have patience,\" said Anne, \"as I have.\"\n\nThe fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal\nmade no reply; he bowed and went out.\n\n(D'Artagnan turned to Porthos. \"How will this end?\" he said.\n\n\"We shall soon see,\" said Porthos, in his tranquil way.)\n\nIn the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with\nhim in a subdued tone, whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner\noccupied by D'Artagnan and Porthos. Ere long the door opened and the\nmarechal entered, followed by the coadjutor.\n\n\"There, madame,\" he said, \"is Monsieur Gondy, who hastens to obey your\nmajesty's summons.\"\n\nThe queen advanced a few steps to meet him, and then stopped, cold,\nsevere, unmoved, with her lower lip scornfully protruded.\n\nGondy bowed respectfully.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the queen, \"what is your opinion of this riot?\"\n\n\"That it is no longer a riot, madame,\" he replied, \"but a revolt.\"\n\n\"The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel,\"\ncried Anne, unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor, whom she looked\nupon, and probably with reason, as the promoter of the tumult. \"Revolt!\nthus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and\nwho are, perhaps, the cause of it; but, wait, wait! the king's authority\nwill put all this to rights.\"\n\n\"Was it to tell me that, madame,\" coldly replied Gondy, \"that your\nmajesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence?\"\n\n\"No, my dear coadjutor,\" said Mazarin; \"it was to ask your advice in the\nunhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves.\"\n\n\"Is it true,\" asked Gondy, feigning astonishment, \"that her majesty\nsummoned me to ask for my opinion?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the queen, \"it is requested.\"\n\nThe coadjutor bowed.\n\n\"Your majesty wishes, then----\"\n\n\"You to say what you would do in her place,\" Mazarin hastened to reply.\n\nThe coadjutor looked at the queen, who replied by a sign in the\naffirmative.\n\n\"Were I in her majesty's place,\" said Gondy, coldly, \"I should not\nhesitate; I should release Broussel.\"\n\n\"And if I do not give him up, what think you will be the result?\"\nexclaimed the queen.\n\n\"I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned,\" put in the\nmarechal.\n\n\"It was not your opinion that I asked,\" said the queen, sharply, without\neven turning around.\n\n\"If it is I whom your majesty interrogates,\" replied the coadjutor\nin the same calm manner, \"I reply that I hold monsieur le marechal's\nopinion in every respect.\"\n\nThe color mounted to the queen's face; her fine blue eyes seemed to\nstart out of her head and her carmine lips, compared by all the poets of\nthe day to a pomegranate in flower, were trembling with anger. Mazarin\nhimself, who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this\ndisturbed household, was alarmed.\n\n\"Give up Broussel!\" she cried; \"fine counsel, indeed. Upon my word! one\ncan easily see it comes from a priest.\"\n\nGondy remained firm, and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his\nhead as the sarcasms of the evening before had done; but hatred and\nrevenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop. He\nlooked coldly at the queen, who nudged Mazarin to make him say something\nin his turn.\n\nMazarin, according to his custom, was thinking much and saying little.\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" said he, \"good advice, advice of a friend. I, too, would give\nup that good Monsieur Broussel, dead or alive, and all would be at an\nend.\"\n\n\"If you yield him dead, all will indeed be at an end, my lord, but quite\notherwise than you mean.\"\n\n\"Did I say 'dead or alive?'\" replied Mazarin. \"It was only a way of\nspeaking. You know I am not familiar with the French language, which\nyou, monsieur le coadjuteur, both speak and write so well.\"\n\n(\"This is a council of state,\" D'Artagnan remarked to Porthos; \"but we\nheld better ones at La Rochelle, with Athos and Aramis.\"\n\n\"At the Saint Gervais bastion,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"There and elsewhere.\")\n\nThe coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed, still with\nthe same tranquillity:\n\n\"Madame, if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it\nis doubtless because you have better counsels to follow. I know too well\nthe wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they\nwill leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution.\"\n\n\"Thus, then, it is your opinion,\" said Anne of Austria, with a sneer\nand biting her lips with rage, \"that yesterday's riot, which to-day is\nalready a rebellion, to-morrow may become a revolution?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied the coadjutor, gravely.\n\n\"But if I am to believe you, sir, the people seem to have thrown off all\nrestraint.\"\n\n\"It is a bad year for kings,\" said Gondy, shaking his head; \"look at\nEngland, madame.\"\n\n\"Yes; but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France,\" replied the\nqueen.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said Gondy; \"such men are like thunderbolts--one recognizes\nthem only when they have struck.\"\n\nEvery one shuddered and there was a moment of silence, during which the\nqueen pressed her hand to her side, evidently to still the beatings of\nher heart.\n\n(\"Porthos,\" murmured D'Artagnan, \"look well at that priest.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"I see him. What then?\"\n\n\"Well, he is a man.\"\n\nPorthos looked at D'Artagnan in astonishment. Evidently he did not\nunderstand his meaning.)\n\n\"Your majesty,\" continued the coadjutor, pitilessly, \"is about to take\nsuch measures as seem good to you, but I foresee that they will be\nviolent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters.\"\n\n\"In that case, you, monsieur le coadjuteur, who have such power\nover them and are at the same time friendly to us,\" said the queen,\nironically, \"will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be too late,\" said Gondy, still unmoved; \"perhaps I\nshall have lost all influence; while by giving up Broussel your majesty\nwill strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to\npunish severely any revival of the revolt.\"\n\n\"Have I not, then, that right?\" cried the queen.\n\n\"If you have it, use it,\" replied Gondy.\n\n(\"Peste!\" said D'Artagnan to Porthos. \"There is a man after my own\nheart. Oh! if he were minister and I were his D'Artagnan, instead of\nbelonging to that beast of a Mazarin, mordieu! what fine things we would\ndo together!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos.)\n\nThe queen made a sign for every one, except Mazarin, to quit the room;\nand Gondy bowed, as if to leave with the rest.\n\n\"Stay, sir,\" said Anne to him.\n\n\"Good,\" thought Gondy, \"she is going to yield.\"\n\n(\"She is going to have him killed,\" said D'Artagnan to Porthos, \"but at\nall events it shall not be by me. I swear to Heaven, on the contrary,\nthat if they fall upon him I will fall upon them.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" said Porthos.)\n\n\"Good,\" muttered Mazarin, sitting down, \"we shall soon see something\nstartling.\"\n\nThe queen's eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had\nclosed the door she turned away. It was evident that she was making\nunnatural efforts to subdue her anger; she fanned herself, smelled at\nher vinaigrette and walked up and down. Gondy, who began to feel uneasy,\nexamined the tapestry with his eyes, touched the coat of mail which he\nwore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle\nof a good Spanish dagger, which was hidden under his cloak, was well\nwithin reach.\n\n\"And now,\" at last said the queen, \"now that we are alone, repeat your\ncounsel, monsieur le coadjuteur.\"\n\n\"It is this, madame: that you should appear to have reflected, and\npublicly acknowledge an error, which constitutes the extra strength of a\nstrong government; release Broussel from prison and give him back to the\npeople.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne, \"to humble myself thus! Am I, or am I not, the queen?\nThis screaming mob, are they, or are they not, my subjects? Have I\nfriends? Have I guards? Ah! by Notre Dame! as Queen Catherine used to\nsay,\" continued she, excited by her own words, \"rather than give up this\ninfamous Broussel to them I will strangle him with my own hands!\"\n\nAnd she sprang toward Gondy, whom assuredly at that moment she hated\nmore than Broussel, with outstretched arms. The coadjutor remained\nimmovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed; only his glance\nflashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen.\n\n(\"He were a dead man\" said the Gascon, \"if there were still a Vitry at\nthe court and if Vitry entered at this moment; but for my part, before\nhe could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once; the cardinal\nwould be infinitely pleased with me.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Porthos; \"listen.\")\n\n\"Madame,\" cried the cardinal, seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back,\n\"Madame, what are you about?\"\n\nThen he added in Spanish, \"Anne, are you mad? You, a queen to quarrel\nlike a washerwoman! And do you not perceive that in the person of this\npriest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous\nto insult him at this moment, and if this priest wished it, in an hour\nyou would be without a crown? Come, then, on another occasion you can be\nfirm and strong; but to-day is not the proper time; to-day, flatter and\ncaress, or you are only a common woman.\"\n\n(At the first words of this address D'Artagnan had seized Porthos's arm,\nwhich he pressed with gradually increasing force. When Mazarin ceased\nspeaking he said to Porthos in a low tone:\n\n\"Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish, or I am a lost man and\nyou are also.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Porthos.)\n\nThis rough appeal, marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin\nwhen he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in\nspeaking French, was uttered with such impenetrable expression that\nGondy, clever physiognomist as he was, had no suspicion of its being\nmore than a simple warning to be more subdued.\n\nThe queen, on her part, thus chided, softened immediately and sat down,\nand in an almost weeping voice, letting her arms fall by her side, said:\n\n\"Pardon me, sir, and attribute this violence to what I suffer. A woman,\nand consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex, I am alarmed at\nthe idea of civil war; a queen, accustomed to be obeyed, I am excited at\nthe first opposition.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Gondy, bowing, \"your majesty is mistaken in qualifying\nmy sincere advice as opposition. Your majesty has none but submissive\nand respectful subjects. It is not the queen with whom the people are\ndispleased; they ask for Broussel and are only too happy, if you release\nhim to them, to live under your government.\"\n\nMazarin, who at the words, \"It is not the queen with whom the people are\ndispleased,\" had pricked up his ears, thinking that the coadjutor was\nabout to speak of the cries, \"Down with Mazarin,\" and pleased with\nGondy's suppression of this fact, he said with his sweetest voice and\nhis most gracious expression:\n\n\"Madame, credit the coadjutor, who is one of the most able politicians\nwe have; the first available cardinal's hat seems to belong already to\nhis noble brow.\"\n\n\"Ah! how much you have need of me, cunning rogue!\" thought Gondy.\n\n(\"And what will he promise us?\" said D'Artagnan. \"Peste, if he is giving\naway hats like that, Porthos, let us look out and both demand a regiment\nto-morrow. Corbleu! let the civil war last but one year and I will have\na constable's sword gilt for me.\"\n\n\"And for me?\" put in Porthos.\n\n\"For you? I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie,\nwho does not seem to be much in favor just now.\")\n\n\"And so, sir,\" said the queen, \"you are seriously afraid of a public\ntumult.\"\n\n\"Seriously,\" said Gondy, astonished at not having further advanced;\n\"I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause\nfearful destruction.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the queen, \"think that in such a case other embankments\nshould be raised to oppose it. Go; I will reflect.\"\n\nGondy looked at Mazarin, astonished, and Mazarin approached the queen\nto speak to her, but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the\nsquare of the Palais Royal.\n\nGondy smiled, the queen's color rose and Mazarin grew even paler.\n\n\"What is that again?\" he asked.\n\nAt this moment Comminges rushed into the room.\n\n\"Pardon, your majesty,\" he cried, \"but the people have dashed the\nsentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors; what are\nyour commands?\"\n\n\"Listen, madame,\" said Gondy.\n\nThe moaning of waves, the noise of thunder, the roaring of a volcano,\ncannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment.\n\n\"What are my commands?\" said the queen.\n\n\"Yes, for time presses.\"\n\n\"How many men have you about the Palais Royal?\"\n\n\"Six hundred.\"\n\n\"Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this\nmob for me.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" cried Mazarin, \"what are you about?\"\n\n\"Go!\" said the queen.\n\nComminges went out with a soldier's passive obedience.\n\nAt this moment a monstrous battering was heard. One of the gates began\nto yield.\n\n\"Oh! madame,\" cried Mazarin, \"you have ruined us all--the king, yourself\nand me.\"\n\nAt this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal, Anne became\nalarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges.\n\n\"It is too late,\" said Mazarin, tearing his hair, \"too late!\"\n\nThe gale had given way. Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob.\nD'Artagnan put his hand to his sword, motioning to Porthos to follow his\nexample.\n\n\"Save the queen!\" cried Mazarin to the coadjutor.\n\nGondy sprang to the window and threw it open; he recognized Louvieres at\nthe head of a troop of about three or four thousand men.\n\n\"Not a step further,\" he shouted, \"the queen is signing!\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"The truth, madame,\" said Mazarin, placing a pen and a paper before her,\n\"you must;\" then he added: \"Sign, Anne, I implore you--I command you.\"\n\nThe queen fell into a chair, took the pen and signed.\n\nThe people, kept back by Louvieres, had not made another step forward;\nbut the awful murmuring, which indicates an angry people, continued.\n\nThe queen had written, \"The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will\nset Councillor Broussel at liberty;\" and she had signed it.\n\nThe coadjutor, whose eyes devoured her slightest movements, seized the\npaper immediately the signature had been affixed to it, returned to the\nwindow and waved it in his hand.\n\n\"This is the order,\" he said.\n\nAll Paris seemed to shout with joy, and then the air resounded with the\ncries of \"Long live Broussel!\" \"Long live the coadjutor!\"\n\n\"Long live the queen!\" cried De Gondy; but the cries which replied to\nhis were poor and few, and perhaps he had but uttered it to make Anne of\nAustria sensible of her weakness.\n\n\"And now that you have obtained what you want, go,\" said she, \"Monsieur\nde Gondy.\"\n\n\"Whenever her majesty has need of me,\" replied the coadjutor, bowing,\n\"her majesty knows I am at her command.\"\n\n\"Ah, cursed priest!\" cried Anne, when he had retired, stretching out\nher arm to the scarcely closed door, \"one day I will make you drink the\ndregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to-day.\"\n\nMazarin wished to approach her. \"Leave me!\" she exclaimed; \"you are not\na man!\" and she went out of the room.\n\n\"It is you who are not a woman,\" muttered Mazarin.\n\nThen, after a moment of reverie, he remembered where he had left\nD'Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything. He\nknit his brows and went direct to the tapestry, which he pushed aside.\nThe closet was empty.\n\nAt the queen's last word, D'Artagnan had dragged Porthos into the\ngallery. Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends\nwalking up and down.\n\n\"Why did you leave the closet, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" asked the cardinal.\n\n\"Because,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"the queen desired every one to leave\nand I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the\nrest.\"\n\n\"And you have been here since----\"\n\n\"About a quarter of an hour,\" said D'Artagnan, motioning to Porthos not\nto contradict him.\n\nMazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that D'Artagnan had seen and\nheard everything; but he was pleased with his falsehood.\n\n\"Decidedly, Monsieur d'Artagnan, you are the man I have been seeking.\nYou may reckon upon me and so may your friend.\" Then bowing to the two\nmusketeers with his most gracious smile, he re-entered his closet more\ncalmly, for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though\nby enchantment.\n\n\n\n\n49. Misfortune refreshes the Memory.\n\n\n\nAnne of Austria returned to her oratory, furious.\n\n\"What!\" she cried, wringing her beautiful hands, \"What! the people have\nseen Monsieur de Conde, a prince of the blood royal, arrested by my\nmother-in-law, Maria de Medicis; they saw my mother-in-law, their former\nregent, expelled by the cardinal; they saw Monsieur de Vendome, that is\nto say, the son of Henry IV., a prisoner at Vincennes; and whilst these\ngreat personages were imprisoned, insulted and threatened, they said\nnothing; and now for a Broussel--good God! what, then, is to become of\nroyalty?\"\n\nThe queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question. The\npeople had made no demonstration for the princes, but they had risen\nfor Broussel; they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending\nBroussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves.\n\nDuring this time Mazarin walked up and down the study, glancing\nfrom time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror, starred in every\ndirection. \"Ah!\" he said, \"it is sad, I know well, to be forced to\nyield thus; but, pshaw! we shall have our revenge. What matters it about\nBroussel--it is a name, not a thing.\"\n\nMazarin, clever politician as he was, was for once mistaken; Broussel\nwas a thing, not a name.\n\nThe next morning, therefore, when Broussel made his entrance into Paris\nin a large carriage, having his son Louvieres at his side and Friquet\nbehind the vehicle, the people threw themselves in his way and cries of\n\"Long live Broussel!\" \"Long live our father!\" resounded from all parts\nand was death to Mazarin's ears; and the cardinal's spies brought bad\nnews from every direction, which greatly agitated the minister, but was\ncalmly received by the queen. The latter seemed to be maturing in her\nmind some great stroke, a fact which increased the uneasiness of the\ncardinal, who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination\nof Anne of Austria.\n\nThe coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king, queen,\nand cardinal, all three together. By his advice a decree from\nparliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the\nbarricades. They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms\nagain and one night to reconstruct the barricades.\n\nRochefort had returned to the Chevalier d'Humieres his fifty horsemen,\nless two, missing at roll call. But the chevalier was himself at heart a\nFrondist and would hear nothing said of compensation.\n\nThe mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache\nand was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with\nthe other. No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged\nwith others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of\nroyalty.\n\nLouvieres was proud and satisfied; he had taken revenge on Mazarin and\nhad aided in his father's deliverance from prison. His name had been\nmentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal. Laughingly he said to\nthe councillor, restored to his family:\n\n\"Do you think, father, that if now I should ask for a company the queen\nwould give it to me?\"\n\nD'Artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul, whom he\nhad great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot, and who wished\npositively to strike a blow for one party or the other. Raoul had\noffered some opposition at first; but D'Artagnan made use of the Comte\nde la Fere's name, and after paying a visit to Madame de Chevreuse,\nRaoul started to rejoin the army.\n\nRochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs. He had\nwritten to the Duc de Beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive,\nand he world find Paris tranquil. He went to the coadjutor to consult\nwith him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop\non the road, but Gondy reflected for a moment, and then said:\n\n\"Let him continue his journey.\"\n\n\"All is not then over?\" asked Rochefort.\n\n\"My dear count, we have only just begun.\"\n\n\"What induces you to think so?\"\n\n\"The knowledge that I have of the queen's heart; she will not rest\ncontented beaten.\"\n\n\"Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Come, let us see what you know.\"\n\n\"I know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the\narmy.\"\n\n\"Ah! ha!\" said Rochefort, \"you are right. We must let Monsieur de\nBeaufort come.\"\n\nIn fact, the evening after this conversation the report was circulated\nthat the Prince de Conde had arrived. It was a very simple, natural\ncircumstance and yet it created a profound sensation. It was said that\nMadame de Longueville, for whom the prince had more than a brother's\naffection and in whom he had confided, had been indiscreet. His\nconfidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen.\n\nEven on the night of the prince's return, some citizens, bolder than the\nrest, such as the sheriffs, captains and the quartermaster, went from\nhouse to house among their friends, saying:\n\n\"Why do we not take the king and place him in the Hotel de Ville? It is\na shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies, who will give him\nevil counsel; whereas, brought up by the coadjutor, for instance, he\nwould imbibe national principles and love his people.\"\n\nThat night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray\nand black cloaks, the patrols of armed shop-people, and the bands of\nmendicants reappeared.\n\nThe queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince, who\nhad entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o'clock\nin the morning.\n\nAt five o'clock Anne went to the cardinal's room. If she had not yet\ntaken any repose, he at least was already up. Six days had already\npassed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt; he was therefore\noccupied in revising his reply to Cromwell, when some one knocked\ngently at the door of communication with the queen's apartments. Anne\nof Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door. The cardinal\ntherefore rose to open it.\n\nThe queen was in a morning gown, but it became her still; for, like\nDiana of Poictiers and Ninon, Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege\nof remaining ever beautiful; nevertheless, this morning she looked\nhandsomer than usual, for her eyes had all the sparkle inward\nsatisfaction adds to expression.\n\n\"What is the matter, madame?\" said Mazarin, uneasily. \"You seem secretly\nelated.\"\n\n\"Yes, Giulio,\" she said, \"proud and happy; for I have found the means of\nstrangling this hydra.\"\n\n\"You are a great politician, my queen,\" said Mazarin; \"let us hear the\nmeans.\" And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a\nfolio of blank paper.\n\n\"You know,\" said the queen, \"that they want to take the king away from\nme?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes, and to hang me.\"\n\n\"They shall not have the king.\"\n\n\"Nor hang me.\"\n\n\"Listen. I want to carry off my son from them, with yourself. I wish\nthat this event, which on the day it is known will completely change the\naspect of affairs, should be accomplished without the knowledge of any\nothers but yourself, myself, and a third person.\"\n\n\"And who is this third person?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Prince.\"\n\n\"He has come, then, as they told me?\"\n\n\"Last evening.\"\n\n\"And you have seen him?\"\n\n\"He has just left me.\"\n\n\"And will he aid this project?\"\n\n\"The plan is his own.\"\n\n\"And Paris?\"\n\n\"He will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion.\"\n\n\"The plan is not wanting in grandeur; I see but one impediment.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Impossibility.\"\n\n\"A senseless word. Nothing is impossible.\"\n\n\"On paper.\"\n\n\"In execution. We have money?\"\n\n\"A little,\" said Mazarin, trembling, lest Anne should ask to draw upon\nhis purse.\n\n\"Troops?\"\n\n\"Five or six thousand men.\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Plenty.\"\n\n\"Then the thing is easy. Oh! do think of it, Giulio! Paris, this\nodious Paris, waking up one morning without queen or king, surrounded,\nbesieged, famished--having for its sole resource its stupid parliament\nand their coadjutor with crooked limbs!\"\n\n\"Charming! charming!\" said Mazarin. \"I can imagine the effect, I do not\nsee the means.\"\n\n\"I will find the means myself.\"\n\n\"You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring,\nimplacable?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, yes, war,\" said Anne of Austria. \"Yes, I will reduce this\nrebellious city to ashes. I will extinguish the fire with blood! I\nwill perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example.\nParis!; I--I detest, I loathe it!\"\n\n\"Very fine, Anne. You are now sanguinary; but take care. We are not in\nthe time of Malatesta and Castruccio Castracani. You will get yourself\ndecapitated, my beautiful queen, and that would be a pity.\"\n\n\"You laugh.\"\n\n\"Faintly. It is dangerous to go to war with a nation. Look at your\nbrother monarch, Charles I. He is badly off, very badly.\"\n\n\"We are in France, and I am Spanish.\"\n\n\"So much the worse; I had much rather you were French and myself also;\nthey would hate us both less.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, you consent?\"\n\n\"Yes, if the thing be possible.\"\n\n\"It is; it is I who tell you so; make preparations for departure.\"\n\n\"I! I am always prepared to go, only, as you know, I never do go, and\nperhaps shall go this time as little as before.\"\n\n\"In short, if I go, will you go too?\"\n\n\"I will try.\"\n\n\"You torment me, Giulio, with your fears; and what are you afraid of,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Of many things.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\nMazarin's face, smiling as it was, became clouded.\n\n\"Anne,\" said he, \"you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men\nat your ease, knowing that you can do it with impunity. You accuse me\nof fear; I have not so much as you have, since I do not fly as you do.\nAgainst whom do they cry out? is it against you or against myself? Whom\nwould they hang, yourself or me? Well, I can weather the storm--I, whom,\nnotwithstanding, you tax with fear--not with bravado, that is not my\nway; but I am firm. Imitate me. Make less hubbub and think more deeply.\nYou cry very loud, you end by doing nothing; you talk of flying----\"\n\nMazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen's hand led her to\nthe window.\n\n\"Look!\" he said.\n\n\"Well?\" said the queen, blinded by her obstinacy.\n\n\"Well, what do you see from this window? If I am not mistaken those are\ncitizens, helmeted and mailed, armed with good muskets, as in the time\nof the League, and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that\nthey will see you if you raise that curtain much; and now come to\nthe other side--what do you see? Creatures of the people, armed with\nhalberds, guarding your doors. You will see the same at every opening\nfrom this palace to which I should lead you. Your doors are guarded, the\nairholes of your cellars are guarded, and I could say to you, as that\ngood La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort, you must be either bird\nor mouse to get out.\"\n\n\"He did get out, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"Do you think of escaping in the same way?\"\n\n\"I am a prisoner, then?\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" said Mazarin, \"I have been proving it to you this last hour.\"\n\nAnd he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been\ninterrupted.\n\nAnne, trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation, left the room,\nshutting the door violently after her. Mazarin did not even turn around.\nWhen once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept;\nthen suddenly struck with an idea:\n\n\"I am saved!\" she exclaimed, rising; \"oh, yes! yes! I know a man who\nwill find the means of taking me from Paris, a man I have too long\nforgotten.\" Then falling into a reverie, she added, however, with an\nexpression of joy, \"Ungrateful woman that I am, for twenty years I have\nforgotten this man, whom I ought to have made a marechal of France. My\nmother-in-law expended gold, caresses, dignities on Concini, who ruined\nher; the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination: while\nI have left in obscurity, in poverty, the noble D'Artagnan, who saved\nme!\"\n\nAnd running to a table, on which were paper, pens and ink, she hastily\nbegan to write.\n\n\n\n\n50. The Interview.\n\n\n\nIt had been D'Artagnan's practice, ever since the riots, to sleep in the\nsame room as Porthos, and on this eventful morning he was still there,\nsleeping, and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and\nwas raining gold pieces into his hat, which he held out till it was\noverflowing with pistoles. As for Porthos, he dreamed that the panels of\nhis carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings\nhe had ordered to be painted on them. They were both aroused at seven\no'clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant, who brought a letter\nfor D'Artagnan.\n\n\"From whom?\" asked the Gascon.\n\n\"From the queen,\" replied the servant.\n\n\"Ho!\" said Porthos, raising himself in his bed; \"what does she say?\"\n\nD'Artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when\nthe door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly, whilst\nPorthos looked at him with starting eyes, not daring to ask a single\nquestion.\n\n\"Friend Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, handing the letter to him, \"this\ntime, at least, you are sure of your title of baron, and I of my\ncaptaincy. Read for yourself and judge.\"\n\nPorthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following\nwords:\n\n\"The queen wishes to speak to Monsieur d'Artagnan, who must follow the\nbearer.\"\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Porthos; \"I see nothing in that very extraordinary.\"\n\n\"But I see much that is very extraordinary in it,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\"It is evident, by their sending for me, that matters are becoming\ncomplicated. Just reflect a little what an agitation the queen's mind\nmust be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Sharpen your sword, baron, load your pistols, and give some corn to the\nhorses, for I will answer for it, something lightning-like will happen\nere to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But, stop; do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for\nus?\" suggested Porthos, incessantly thinking how his greatness must be\nirksome to inferior people.\n\n\"If it is a snare,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I shall scent it out, be\nassured. If Mazarin is an Italian, I am a Gascon.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan dressed himself in an instant.\n\nWhilst Porthos, still in bed, was hooking on his cloak for him, a second\nknock at the door was heard.\n\n\"Come in,\" exclaimed D'Artagnan; and another servant entered.\n\n\"From His Eminence, Cardinal Mazarin,\" presenting a letter.\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Porthos.\n\n\"A complicated affair,\" said Porthos; \"where will you begin?\"\n\n\"It is arranged capitally; his eminence expects me in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said D'Artagnan, turning to the servant, \"tell his eminence\nthat in half an hour I shall be at his command.\"\n\n\"It is very fortunate,\" resumed the Gascon, when the valet had retired,\n\"that he did not meet the other one.\"\n\n\"Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?\"\n\n\"I do not think it, I am certain of it.\"\n\n\"Quick, quick, D'Artagnan. Remember that the queen awaits you, and after\nthe queen, the cardinal, and after the cardinal, myself.\"\n\nD'Artagnan summoned Anne of Austria's servant and signified that he was\nready to follow him into the queen's presence.\n\nThe servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to\nthe left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu;\nthen they gained the private staircase and D'Artagnan was ushered into\nthe oratory. A certain emotion, for which he could not account, made\nthe lieutenant's heart beat: he had no longer the assurance of youth;\nexperience had taught him the importance of past events. Formerly he\nwould have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman;\nbut now it was a different thing; he answered her summons as an humble\nsoldier obeys an illustrious general.\n\nThe silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling\nof silk, and D'Artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by\na white hand, which, by its form, its color and its beauty he recognized\nas that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss. The\nqueen entered.\n\n\"It is you, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" she said, fixing a gaze full of\nmelancholy interest on the countenance of the officer, \"and I know you\nwell. Look at me well in your turn. I am the queen; do you recognize\nme?\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But are you no longer aware,\" continued Anne, giving that sweet\nexpression to her voice which she could do at will, \"that in former days\nthe queen had once need of a young, brave and devoted cavalier--that she\nfound this cavalier--and that, although he might have thought that she\nhad forgotten him, she had kept a place for him in the depths of her\nheart?\"\n\n\"No, madame, I was ignorant of that,\" said the musketeer.\n\n\"So much the worse, sir,\" said Anne of Austria; \"so much the worse, at\nleast for the queen, for to-day she has need of the same courage and the\nsame devotion.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"does the queen, surrounded as she is by\nsuch devoted servants, such wise counselors, men, in short, so great\nby merit or position--does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure\nsoldier?\"\n\nAnne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated\nby it. She had many a time felt humiliated by the self-sacrifice and\ndisinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman. She had allowed herself\nto be exceeded in generosity.\n\n\"All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded, Monsieur\nd'Artagnan, is doubtless true,\" said the queen, \"but I have confidence\nin you alone. I know that you belong to the cardinal, but belong to me\nas well, and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune. Come,\nwill you do to-day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for\nthe queen?\"\n\n\"I will do everything your majesty commands,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nThe queen reflected for a moment and then, seeing the cautious demeanor\nof the musketeer:\n\n\"Perhaps you like repose?\" she said.\n\n\"I do not know, for I have never had it, madame.\"\n\n\"Have you any friends?\"\n\n\"I had three, two of whom have left Paris, to go I know not where. One\nalone is left to me, but he is one of those known, I believe, to the\ncavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the queen; \"you and your friend are worth an army.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, madame?\"\n\n\"Return at five o'clock and I will tell you; but do not breathe to a\nliving soul, sir, the rendezvous which I give you.\"\n\n\"No, madame.\"\n\n\"Swear it upon the cross.\"\n\n\"Madame, I have never been false to my word; when I say I will not do a\nthing, I mean it.\"\n\nThe queen, although astonished at this language, to which she was not\naccustomed from her courtiers, argued from it a happy omen of the zeal\nwith which D'Artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her\nproject. It was one of the Gascon's artifices to hide his deep cunning\noccasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty.\n\n\"Has the queen any further commands for me now?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Anne of Austria, \"and you may retire until the time\nthat I mentioned to you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed and went out.\n\n\"Diable!\" he exclaimed when the door was shut, \"they seem to have the\ngreatest need of me just now.\"\n\nThen, as the half hour had already glided by, he crossed the gallery and\nknocked at the cardinal's door.\n\nBernouin introduced him.\n\n\"I come for your commands, my lord,\" he said.\n\nAnd according to his custom D'Artagnan glanced rapidly around and\nremarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him. But it was so\nplaced on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed.\n\n\"You come from the queen?\" said Mazarin, looking fixedly at D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I! my lord--who told you that?\"\n\n\"Nobody, but I know it.\"\n\n\"I regret infinitely to tell you, my lord, that you are mistaken,\"\nreplied the Gascon, impudently, firm to the promise he had just made to\nAnne of Austria.\n\n\"I opened the door of the ante-room myself and I saw you enter at the\nend of the corridor.\"\n\n\"Because I was shown up the private stairs.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I know not; it must have been a mistake.\"\n\nMazarin was aware that it was not easy to make D'Artagnan reveal\nanything he was desirous of hiding, so he gave up, for the time, the\ndiscovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing.\n\n\"Let us speak of my affairs,\" said Mazarin, \"since you will tell me\nnaught of yours. Are you fond of traveling?\"\n\n\"My life has been passed on the high road.\"\n\n\"Would anything retain you particularly in Paris?\"\n\n\"Nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris.\"\n\n\"Very well. Here is a letter, which must be taken to its address.\"\n\n\"To its address, my lord? But it has none.\"\n\nIn fact, the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank.\n\n\"I must tell you,\" resumed Mazarin, \"that it is in a double envelope.\"\n\n\"I understand; and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a\ncertain place?\"\n\n\"Just so, take it and go. You have a friend, Monsieur du Vallon, whom I\nlike much; let him accompany you.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said D'Artagnan to himself. \"He knows that we overheard his\nconversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from Paris.\"\n\n\"Do you hesitate?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"No, my lord, and I will set out at once. There is one thing only which\nI must request.\"\n\n\"What is it? Speak.\"\n\n\"That your eminence will go at once to the queen.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Merely to say these words: 'I am going to send Monsieur d'Artagnan away\nand I wish him to set out directly.'\"\n\n\"I told you,\" said Mazarin, \"that you had seen the queen.\"\n\n\"I had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some\nmistake.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of that?\"\n\n\"May I venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence?\"\n\n\"Very well; I will go. Wait here for me.\" And looking attentively around\nhim, to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets, Mazarin went\nout. Ten minutes elapsed, during which D'Artagnan made every effort to\nread through the first envelope what was written on the second. But he\ndid not succeed.\n\nMazarin returned, pale, and evidently thoughtful. He seated himself at\nhis desk and D'Artagnan proceeded to examine his face, as he had\njust examined the letter he held, but the envelope which covered his\ncountenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter.\n\n\"Ah!\" thought the Gascon; \"he looks displeased. Can it be with me? He\nmeditates. Is it about sending me to the Bastile? All very fine,\nmy lord, but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will\nstrangle you and become Frondist. I should be carried home in triumph\nlike Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus. It\nwould be exceedingly droll.\"\n\nThe Gascon, with his vivid imagination, had already seen the advantage\nto be derived from his situation. Mazarin gave, however, no order of the\nkind, but on the contrary began to be insinuating.\n\n\"You were right,\" he said, \"my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, and you cannot\nset out yet. I beg you to return me that dispatch.\"\n\nD'Artagnan obeyed, and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact.\n\n\"I shall want you this evening,\" he said \"Return in two hours.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I have an appointment in two hours which I\ncannot miss.\"\n\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" said Mazarin; \"it is the same.\"\n\n\"Good!\" thought D'Artagnan; \"I fancied it was so.\"\n\n\"Return, then, at five o'clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon\nwith you. Only, leave him in the ante-room, as I wish to speak to you\nalone.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed, and thought: \"Both at the same hour; both commands\nalike; both at the Palais Royal. Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred\nthousand francs for such a secret!\"\n\n\"You are thoughtful,\" said Mazarin, uneasily.\n\n\"Yes, I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not.\"\n\n\"Armed to the teeth!\" replied Mazarin.\n\n\"Very well, my lord; it shall be so.\"\n\nD'Artagnan saluted, went out and hastened to repeat to his friend\nMazarin's flattering promises, which gave Porthos an indescribable\nhappiness.\n\n\n\n\n51. The Flight.\n\n\n\nWhen D'Artagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five o'clock, it\npresented, in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town, a\nspectacle of the greatest rejoicing. Nor was that surprising. The queen\nhad restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore\nnothing to fear, since the people had nothing more just then to ask for.\nThe return, also, of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving\na grand banquet. The princes and princesses were invited and their\ncarriages had crowded the court since noon; then after dinner the queen\nwas to have a play in her apartment. Anne of Austria had never appeared\nmore brilliant than on that day--radiant with grace and wit. Mazarin\ndisappeared as they rose from table. He found D'Artagnan waiting for him\nalready at his post in the ante-room.\n\nThe cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led\nhim into his study.\n\n\"My dear M. d'Artagnan,\" said the minister, sitting down, \"I am about\nto give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an\nofficer.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said D'Artagnan, bowing, \"that you give it, my lord, without\nhesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of it.\"\n\n\"More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend; therefore I apply to\nyou. We are about to leave this evening,\" continued Mazarin. \"My dear\nM. d'Artagnan, the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands.\" He\npaused.\n\n\"Explain yourself, my lord, I am listening.\"\n\n\"The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to\nSaint Germain.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said D'Artagnan, \"that is to say, the queen wishes to leave\nParis.\"\n\n\"A woman's caprice--you understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand perfectly,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to\nreturn at five o'clock.\"\n\n\"Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would\nmention the appointment to no one?\" muttered D'Artagnan. \"Oh, women!\nwomen! whether queens or not, they are always the same.\"\n\n\"Do you disapprove of this journey, my dear M. d'Artagnan?\" asked\nMazarin, anxiously.\n\n\"I, my lord?\" said D'Artagnan; \"why should I?\"\n\n\"Because you shrug your shoulders.\"\n\n\"It is a way I have of speaking to myself. I neither approve nor\ndisapprove, my lord; I merely await your commands.\"\n\n\"Good; it is you, accordingly, that I have pitched upon to conduct the\nking and the queen to Saint Germain.\"\n\n\"Liar!\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You see, therefore,\" continued the cardinal, perceiving D'Artagnan's\ncomposure, \"that, as I have told you, the welfare of the state is placed\nin your hands.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, and I feel the whole responsibility of such a charge.\"\n\n\"You accept, however?\"\n\n\"I always accept.\"\n\n\"Do you think the thing possible?\"\n\n\"Everything is possible.\"\n\n\"Shall you be attacked on the road?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"And what will you do in that case?\"\n\n\"I shall pass through those who attack me.\"\n\n\"And suppose you cannot pass through them?\"\n\n\"So much the worse for them; I shall pass over them.\"\n\n\"And you will place the king and queen in safety also, at Saint\nGermain?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"On your life?\"\n\n\"On my life.\"\n\n\"You are a hero, my friend,\" said Mazarin, gazing at the musketeer with\nadmiration.\n\nD'Artagnan smiled.\n\n\"And I?\" asked Mazarin, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"How? and you, my lord?\"\n\n\"If I wish to leave?\"\n\n\"That would be much more difficult.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Your eminence might be recognized.\"\n\n\"Even under this disguise?\" asked Mazarin, raising a cloak which\ncovered an arm-chair, upon which lay a complete dress for an officer, of\npearl-gray and red, entirely embroidered with silver.\n\n\"If your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mazarin, breathing more freely.\n\n\"But it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you\ndeclared you should have done in our place--cry, 'Down with Mazarin!'\"\n\n\"I will: 'Down with Mazarin'\"\n\n\"In French, in good French, my lord, take care of your accent; they\nkilled six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian\nbadly. Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for\nthe Sicilian vespers.\"\n\n\"I will do my best.\"\n\n\"The streets are full of armed men,\" continued D'Artagnan. \"Are you sure\nthat no one is aware of the queen's project?\"\n\nMazarin reflected.\n\n\"This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor, my lord; the\nchance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything.\"\n\nMazarin shuddered, but he reflected that a man who had the least\nintention to betray would not warn first.\n\n\"And therefore,\" added he, quietly, \"I have not confidence in every one;\nthe proof of which is, that I have fixed upon you to escort me.\"\n\n\"Shall you not go with the queen?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mazarin.\n\n\"Then you will start after the queen?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mazarin again.\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan, who began to understand.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the cardinal. \"I have my plan. With the queen I double\nher risk; after the queen her departure would double mine; then, the\ncourt once safe, I might be forgotten. The great are often ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes, in spite of himself, on\nthe queen's diamond, which Mazarin wore on his finger. Mazarin followed\nthe direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside.\n\n\"I wish,\" he said, with his cunning smile, \"to prevent them from being\nungrateful to me.\"\n\n\"It is but Christian charity,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"not to lead one's\nneighbors into temptation.\"\n\n\"It is exactly for that reason,\" said Mazarin, \"that I wish to start\nbefore them.\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled--he was just the man to understand the astute Italian.\nMazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment.\n\n\"You will begin, therefore, by taking me first out of Paris, will you\nnot, my dear M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"A difficult commission, my lord,\" replied D'Artagnan, resuming his\nserious manner.\n\n\"But,\" said Mazarin, \"you did not make so many difficulties with regard\nto the king and queen.\"\n\n\"The king and the queen are my king and queen,\" replied the musketeer,\n\"my life is theirs and I must give it for them. If they ask it what have\nI to say?\"\n\n\"That is true,\" murmured Mazarin, in a low tone, \"but as thy life is not\nmine I suppose I must buy it, must I not?\" and sighing deeply he began\nto turn the hoop of his ring outside again. D'Artagnan smiled. These\ntwo men met at one point and that was, cunning; had they been actuated\nequally by courage, the one would have done great things for the other.\n\n\"But, also,\" said Mazarin, \"you must understand that if I ask this\nservice from you it is with the intention of being grateful.\"\n\n\"Is it still only an intention, your eminence?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Stay,\" said Mazarin, drawing the ring from his finger, \"my dear\nD'Artagnan, there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly, it is but\njust it should return to you; take it, I pray.\"\n\nD'Artagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting, and after looking to\nsee if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of\nits water, he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable\npleasure.\n\n\"I valued it much,\" said Mazarin, giving a last look at it;\n\"nevertheless, I give it to you with great pleasure.\"\n\n\"And I, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"accept it as it is given. Come, let\nus speak of your little affairs. You wish to leave before everybody and\nat what hour?\"\n\n\"At ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"And the queen, at what time is it her wish to start?\"\n\n\"At midnight.\"\n\n\"Then it is possible. I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond\nthe barriere, and can return for her.\"\n\n\"Capital; but how will you get me out of Paris?\"\n\n\"Oh! as to that, you must leave it to me.\"\n\n\"I give you absolute power, therefore; take as large an escort as you\nlike.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shook his head.\n\n\"It seems to me, however,\" said Mazarin, \"the safest method.\"\n\n\"Yes, for you, my lord, but not for the queen; you must leave it to me\nand give me the entire direction of the undertaking.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless----\"\n\n\"Or find some one else,\" continued D'Artagnan, turning his back.\n\n\"Oh!\" muttered Mazarin, \"I do believe he is going off with the diamond!\nM. d'Artagnan, my dear M. d'Artagnan,\" he called out in a coaxing voice,\n\"will you answer for everything?\"\n\n\"I will answer for nothing. I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us go--I must trust to you.\"\n\n\"It is very fortunate,\" said D'Artagnan to himself.\n\n\"You will be here at half-past nine.\"\n\n\"And I shall find your eminence ready?\"\n\n\"Certainly, quite ready.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is a settled thing; and now, my lord, will you obtain\nfor me an audience with the queen?\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"I wish to receive her majesty's commands from her own lips.\"\n\n\"She desired me to give them to you.\"\n\n\"She may have forgotten something.\"\n\n\"You really wish to see her?\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, my lord.\"\n\nMazarin hesitated for one instant, but D'Artagnan was firm.\n\n\"Come, then,\" said the minister; \"I will conduct you to her, but\nremember, not one word of our conversation.\"\n\n\"What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone, my lord,\" replied\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"Swear to be mute.\"\n\n\"I never swear, my lord, I say yes or no; and, as I am a gentleman, I\nkeep my word.\"\n\n\"Come, then, I see that I must trust unreservedly to you.\"\n\n\"Believe me, my lord, it will be your best plan.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Mazarin, conducting D'Artagnan into the queen's oratory and\ndesiring him to wait there. He did not wait long, for in five minutes\nthe queen entered in full gala costume. Thus dressed she scarcely\nappeared thirty-five years of age. She was still exceedingly handsome.\n\n\"It is you, Monsieur D'Artagnan,\" she said, smiling graciously; \"I thank\nyou for having insisted on seeing me.\"\n\n\"I ought to ask your majesty's pardon, but I wished to receive your\ncommands from your own mouth.\"\n\n\"Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you?\"\n\n\"With gratitude.\"\n\n\"Very well, be here at midnight.\"\n\n\"I will not fail.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" continued the queen, \"I know your\ndisinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a\nmoment, but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service\nas I forgot the first.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is free to forget or to remember, as it pleases you; and I\nknow not what you mean,\" said D'Artagnan, bowing.\n\n\"Go, sir,\" said the queen, with her most bewitching smile, \"go and\nreturn at midnight.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan retired, but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain\nthrough which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he\nremarked the tip of a velvet slipper.\n\n\"Good,\" thought he; \"Mazarin has been listening to discover whether\nI betrayed him. In truth, that Italian puppet does not deserve the\nservices of an honest man.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half-past nine\no'clock he entered the ante-room.\n\nHe found the cardinal dressed as an officer, and he looked very well in\nthat costume, which, as we have already said, he wore elegantly; only he\nwas very pale and trembled slightly.\n\n\"Quite alone?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon, are we not to enjoy his society?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my lord; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the\ngarden of the Palais Royal.\"\n\n\"And we start in his carriage, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"And with us no other escort but you two?\"\n\n\"Is it not enough? One of us would suffice.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal, \"your coolness\nstartles me.\"\n\n\"I should have thought, on the contrary, that it ought to have inspired\nyou with confidence.\"\n\n\"And Bernouin--do I not take him with me?\"\n\n\"There is no room for him, he will rejoin your eminence.\"\n\n\"Let us go,\" said Mazarin, \"since everything must be done as you wish.\"\n\n\"My lord, there is time to draw back,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and your\neminence is perfectly free.\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all,\" said Mazarin; \"let us be off.\"\n\nAnd so they descended the private stair, Mazarin leaning on the arm of\nD'Artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling. At last, after crossing\nthe courts of the Palais Royal, where there still remained some of the\nconveyances of late guests, they entered the garden and reached the\nlittle gate. Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from\nhis pocket, but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the\nkeyhole.\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said D'Artagnan, who when the gate was open deposited\nthe key in his pocket, reckoning upon returning by that gate.\n\nThe steps were already down and the door open. Mousqueton stood at the\ndoor and Porthos was inside the carriage.\n\n\"Mount, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan to Mazarin, who sprang into the\ncarriage without waiting for a second bidding. D'Artagnan followed him,\nand Mousqueton, having closed the door, mounted behind the carriage with\nmany groans. He had made some difficulties about going, under pretext\nthat he still suffered from his wound, but D'Artagnan had said to him:\n\n\"Remain if you like, my dear Monsieur Mouston, but I warn you that\nParis will be burnt down to-night;\" upon which Mousqueton had declared,\nwithout asking anything further, that he was ready to follow his master\nand Monsieur d'Artagnan to the end of the world.\n\nThe carriage started at a measured pace, without betraying by the\nslightest sign that it contained people in a hurry. The cardinal wiped\nhis forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him. On his left\nwas Porthos, whilst D'Artagnan was on his right; each guarded a door\nand served as a rampart to him on either side. Before him, on the front\nseat, lay two pairs of pistols--one in front of Porthos and the other of\nD'Artagnan. About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped\nthe carriage.\n\n\"Who goes?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Mazarin!\" replied D'Artagnan, bursting into a laugh. The cardinal's\nhair stood on end. But the joke appeared an excellent one to the\ncitizens, who, seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed, would\nnever have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence.\n\n\"A good journey to ye,\" they cried, allowing it to pass.\n\n\"Hem!\" said D'Artagnan, \"what does my lord think of that reply?\"\n\n\"Man of talent!\" cried Mazarin.\n\n\"In truth,\" said Porthos, \"I understand; but now----\"\n\nAbout the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a\nsecond patrol.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" inquired the captain of the patrol.\n\n\"Keep back, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan. And Mazarin buried himself so far\nbehind the two friends that he disappeared, completely hidden between\nthem.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" cried the same voice, impatiently whilst D'Artagnan\nperceived that they had rushed to the horses' heads. But putting his\nhead out of the carriage:\n\n\"Eh! Planchet,\" said he.\n\nThe chief approached, and it was indeed Planchet; D'Artagnan had\nrecognized the voice of his old servant.\n\n\"How, sir!\" said Planchet, \"is it you?\"\n\n\"Eh! mon Dieu! yes, my good friend, this worthy Porthos has just\nreceived a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint\nCloud.\"\n\n\"Oh! really,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"if you can still speak, say a word, my dear\nPorthos, to this good Planchet.\"\n\n\"Planchet, my friend,\" said Porthos, in a melancholy voice, \"I am very\nill; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh! good Heaven,\" said Planchet, \"what a misfortune! and how did it\nhappen?\"\n\n\"I will tell you all about it,\" replied Mousqueton.\n\nPorthos uttered a deep groan.\n\n\"Make way for us, Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan in a whisper to him, \"or he\nwill not arrive alive; the lungs are attacked, my friend.\"\n\nPlanchet shook his head with the air of a man who says, \"In that case\nthings look ill.\" Then he exclaimed, turning to his men:\n\n\"Let them pass; they are friends.\"\n\nThe carriage resumed its course, and Mazarin, who had held his breath,\nventured to breathe again.\n\n\"Bricconi!\" muttered he.\n\nA few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third\ntroop; this latter party was composed of ill-looking fellows, who\nresembled bandits more than anything else; they were the men of the\nbeggar of Saint Eustache.\n\n\"Attention, Porthos!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos placed his hand on the pistols.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"My lord, I think we are in bad company.\"\n\nA man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand. \"Qui\nvive?\" he asked.\n\n\"Eh, rascal!\" said D'Artagnan, \"do you not recognize his highness the\nprince's carriage?\"\n\n\"Prince or not,\" said the man, \"open. We are here to guard the gate, and\nno one whom we do not know shall pass.\"\n\n\"What is to be done?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Pardieu! pass,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But how?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"Through or over; coachman, gallop on.\"\n\nThe coachman raised his whip.\n\n\"Not a step further,\" said the man, who appeared to be the captain, \"or\nI will hamstring your horses.\"\n\n\"Peste!\" said Porthos, \"it would be a pity; animals which cost me a\nhundred pistoles each.\"\n\n\"I will pay you two hundred for them,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"Yes, but when once they are hamstrung, our necks will be strung next.\"\n\n\"If one of them comes to my side,\" asked Porthos, \"must I kill him?\"\n\n\"Yes, by a blow of your fist, if you can; we will not fire but at the\nlast extremity.\"\n\n\"I can do it,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Come and open, then!\" cried D'Artagnan to the man with the scythe,\ntaking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with\nthe handle. And as the man approached, D'Artagnan, in order to have\nmore freedom for his actions, leaned half out of the door; his eyes were\nfixed upon those of the mendicant, which were lighted up by a lantern.\nWithout doubt he recognized D'Artagnan, for he became deadly pale;\ndoubtless the musketeer knew him, for his hair stood up on his head.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" he cried, falling back a step; \"it is Monsieur\nd'Artagnan! let him pass.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was perhaps about to reply, when a blow, similar to that of a\nmallet falling on the head of an ox, was heard. The noise was caused by\nPorthos, who had just knocked down his man.\n\nD'Artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about\nfour paces off.\n\n\"'Sdeath!\" cried he to the coachman. \"Spur your horses! whip! get on!\"\n\nThe coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses; the\nnoble animals bounded forward; then cries of men who were knocked down\nwere heard; then a double concussion was felt, and two of the wheels\nseemed to pass over a round and flexible body. There was a moment's\nsilence, then the carriage cleared the gate.\n\n\"To Cours la Reine!\" cried D'Artagnan to the coachman; then turning to\nMazarin he said, \"Now, my lord, you can say five paters and five aves,\nin thanks to Heaven for your deliverance. You are safe--you are free.\"\n\nMazarin replied only by a groan; he could not believe in such a miracle.\nFive minutes later the carriage stopped, having reached Cours la Reine.\n\n\"Is my lord pleased with his escort?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Enchanted, monsieur,\" said Mazarin, venturing his head out of one of\nthe windows; \"and now do as much for the queen.\"\n\n\"It will not be so difficult,\" replied D'Artagnan, springing to the\nground. \"Monsieur du Vallon, I commend his eminence to your care.\"\n\n\"Be quite at ease,\" said Porthos, holding out his hand, which D'Artagnan\ntook and shook in his.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Porthos, as if in pain.\n\nD'Artagnan looked with surprise at his friend.\n\n\"What is the matter, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think I have sprained my wrist,' said Porthos.\n\n\"The devil! why, you strike like a blind or a deaf man.\"\n\n\"It was necessary; my man was going to fire a pistol at me; but you--how\ndid you get rid of yours?\"\n\n\"Oh, mine,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"was not a man.\"\n\n\"What was it then?\"\n\n\"It was an apparition.\"\n\n\"And----\"\n\n\"I charmed it away.\"\n\nWithout further explanation D'Artagnan took the pistols which were upon\nthe front seat, placed them in his belt, wrapped himself in his cloak,\nand not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had\nleft, he took his way toward the Richelieu gate.\n\n\n\n\n52. The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur.\n\n\n\nInstead of returning, then, by the Saint Honore gate, D'Artagnan,\nwho had time before him, walked around and re-entered by the Porte\nRichelieu. He was approached to be examined, and when it was discovered\nby his plumed hat and his laced coat, that he was an officer of the\nmusketeers, he was surrounded, with the intention of making him cry,\n\"Down with Mazarin!\" The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy\nat first; but when he discovered what it meant, he shouted it in such a\nvoice that even the most exacting were satisfied. He walked down the Rue\nRichelieu, meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn,\nfor to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be\nthought of, when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the\nhotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee.\n\nHe was struck by a sudden idea.\n\n\"Ah, pardieu!\" he exclaimed; \"that would be fair play.\"\n\nAnd approaching the carriage, he examined the arms on the panels and the\nlivery of the coachman on his box. This scrutiny was so much the more\neasy, the coachman being sound asleep.\n\n\"It is, in truth, monsieur le coadjuteur's carriage,\" said D'Artagnan;\n\"upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us.\"\n\nHe mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which\nwas attached to the coachman's little finger.\n\n\"To the Palais Royal,\" he called out.\n\nThe coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was\ndesired, never doubting but that the order had come from his master.\nThe porter at the palace was about to close the gates, but seeing such\na handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and\nthe carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch. It was\nthen only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle;\nhe fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back, and without\ndropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door. D'Artagnan,\nin his turn, sprang to the ground, and just at the moment when the\ncoachman, alarmed at not seeing his master, fell back a step, he seized\nhim by his collar with the left, whilst with the right hand he placed\nthe muzzle of a pistol at his breast.\n\n\"Pronounce one single word,\" muttered D'Artagnan, \"and you are a dead\nman.\"\n\nThe coachman perceived at once, by the expression of the man who thus\naddressed him, that he had fallen into a trap, and he remained with his\nmouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring.\n\nTwo musketeers were pacing the court, to whom D'Artagnan called by their\nnames.\n\n\"Monsieur de Belliere,\" said he to one of them, \"do me the favor to\ntake the reins from the hands of this worthy man, mount upon the box and\ndrive to the door of the private stair, and wait for me there; it is an\naffair of importance on the service of the king.\"\n\nThe musketeer, who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting\nwith regard to the service, obeyed without a word, although he thought\nthe order strange. Then turning toward the second musketeer, D'Artagnan\nsaid:\n\n\"Monsieur du Verger, help me to place this man in a place of safety.\"\n\nThe musketeer, thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some\nprince in disguise, bowed, and drawing his sword, signified that he was\nready. D'Artagnan mounted the staircase, followed by his prisoner,\nwho in his turn was followed by the soldier, and entered Mazarin's\nante-room. Bernouin was waiting there, impatient for news of his master.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"Everything goes on capitally, my dear Monsieur Bernouin, but here is a\nman whom I must beg you to put in a safe place.\"\n\n\"Where, then, sir?\"\n\n\"Where you like, provided that the place which you shall choose has iron\nshutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked.\"\n\n\"We have that, sir,\" replied Bernouin; and the poor coachman was\nconducted to a closet, the windows of which were barred and which looked\nvery much like a prison.\n\n\"And now, my good friend,\" said D'Artagnan to him, \"I must invite you to\ndeprive yourself, for my sake, of your hat and cloak.\"\n\nThe coachman, as we can well understand, made no resistance; in fact,\nhe was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and\nreeled like a drunken man; D'Artagnan deposited his clothes under the\narm of one of the valets.\n\n\"And now, Monsieur du Verger,\" he said, \"shut yourself up with this\nman until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door. The duty will be\ntolerably long and not very amusing, I know; but,\" added he, seriously,\n\"you understand, it is on the king's service.\"\n\n\"At your command, lieutenant,\" replied the musketeer, who saw the\nbusiness was a serious one.\n\n\"By-the-bye,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"should this man attempt to fly or\nto call out, pass your sword through his body.\"\n\nThe musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed\nto the letter, and D'Artagnan went out, followed by Bernouin. Midnight\nstruck.\n\n\"Lead me into the queen's oratory,\" said D'Artagnan, \"announce to her I\nam here, and put this parcel, with a well-loaded musket, under the seat\nof the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair.\"\n\nBernouin conducted D'Artagnan to the oratory, where he sat down\npensively. Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal. As we\nsaid before, by ten o'clock almost all the guests had dispersed; those\nwho were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were\neach severally desired to be from twelve o'clock to one at Cours la\nReine.\n\nAt ten o'clock Anne of Austria had entered the king's room. Monsieur had\njust retired, and the youthful Louis, remaining the last, was amusing\nhimself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle, a game which\ndelighted him much. Two royal pages were playing with him.\n\n\"Laporte,\" said the queen, \"it is time for his majesty to go to bed.\"\n\nThe king asked to remain up, having, he said, no wish to sleep; but the\nqueen was firm.\n\n\"Are you not going to-morrow morning at six o'clock, Louis, to bathe at\nConflans? I think you wished to do so of your own accord?\"\n\n\"You are right, madame,\" said the king, \"and I am ready to retire to my\nroom when you have kissed me. Laporte, give the light to Monsieur the\nChevalier de Coislin.\"\n\nThe queen touched with her lips the white, smooth brow the royal child\npresented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette.\n\n\"Go to sleep soon, Louis,\" said the queen, \"for you must be awakened\nvery early.\"\n\n\"I will do my best to obey you, madame,\" said the youthful king, \"but I\nhave no inclination to sleep.\"\n\n\"Laporte,\" said Anne of Austria, in an undertone, \"find some very dull\nbook to read to his majesty, but do not undress yourself.\"\n\nThe king went out, accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin, bearing\nthe candlestick, and then the queen returned to her own apartment. Her\nladies--that is to say Madame de Bregy, Mademoiselle de Beaumont, Madame\nde Motteville, and Socratine, her sister, so called on account of\nher sense--had just brought into her dressing-room the remains of the\ndinner, on which, according to her usual custom, she supped. The queen\nthen gave her orders, spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier\nwas to give to her on the day after the morrow, indicated the persons\nshe would admit to the honor of partaking of it, announced another visit\non the following day to Val-de-Grace, where she intended to pay her\ndevotions, and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her.\nWhen the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme\nfatigue and passed into her bedroom. Madame de Motteville, who was on\nespecial duty that evening, followed to aid and undress her. The queen\nthen began to read, and after conversing with her affectionately for a\nfew minutes, dismissed her.\n\nIt was at this moment D'Artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace, in\nthe coadjutor's carriage, and a few seconds later the carriages of the\nladies-in-waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them.\n\nA few minutes after twelve o'clock Bernouin knocked at the queen's\nbedroom door, having come by the cardinal's secret corridor. Anne of\nAustria opened the door to him herself. She was dressed, that is to say,\nin dishabille, wrapped in a long, warm dressing-gown.\n\n\"It is you, Bernouin,\" she said. \"Is Monsieur d'Artagnan there?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, in your oratory. He is waiting till your majesty is\nready.\"\n\n\"I am. Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king, and then pass on\nto the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to me.\"\n\nBernouin bowed and retired.\n\nThe queen entered her oratory, which was lighted by a single lamp of\nVenetian crystal, She saw D'Artagnan, who stood expecting her.\n\n\"Is it you?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And his eminence, the cardinal?\"\n\n\"Has got off without any accident. He is awaiting your majesty at Cours\nla Reine.\"\n\n\"But in what carriage do we start?\"\n\n\"I have provided for everything; a carriage below is waiting for your\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"Let us go to the king.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed and followed the queen. The young Louis was already\ndressed, with the exception of his shoes and doublet; he had allowed\nhimself to be dressed, in great astonishment, overwhelming Laporte with\nquestions, who replied only in these words, \"Sire, it is by the queen's\ncommands.\"\n\nThe bedclothes were thrown back, exposing the king's bed linen, which\nwas so worn that here and there holes could be seen. It was one of the\nresults of Mazarin's niggardliness.\n\nThe queen entered and D'Artagnan remained at the door. As soon as the\nchild perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her.\nAnne then motioned to D'Artagnan to approach, and he obeyed.\n\n\"My son,\" said Anne of Austria, pointing to the musketeer, calm,\nstanding uncovered, \"here is Monsieur d'Artagnan, who is as brave as one\nof those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women.\nRemember his name well and look at him well, that his face may not be\nforgotten, for this evening he is going to render us a great service.\"\n\nThe young king looked at the officer with his large-formed eye, and\nrepeated:\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"That is it, my son.\"\n\nThe young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the\nmusketeer; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" repeated Louis; \"very well, madame.\"\n\nAt this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were\napproaching.\n\n\"What is that?\" exclaimed the queen.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" replied D'Artagnan, straining both at the same time his quick\near and his intelligent glance, \"it is the murmur of the populace in\nrevolution.\"\n\n\"We must fly,\" said the queen.\n\n\"Your majesty has given me the control of this business; we had better\nwait and see what they want.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"I will answer for everything.\"\n\nNothing is so catching as confidence. The queen, full of energy and\ncourage, was quickly alive to these two virtues in others.\n\n\"Do as you like,\" she said, \"I rely upon you.\"\n\n\"Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Command, sir.\"\n\n\"What do the people want this time?\" demanded the king.\n\n\"We are about to ascertain, sire,\" replied D'Artagnan, as he rapidly\nleft the room.\n\nThe tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal\nentirely. Cries were heard from the interior, of which they could not\ncomprehend the sense. It was evident that there was clamor and sedition.\n\nThe king, half dressed, the queen and Laporte remained each in the\nsame state and almost in the same place, where they were listening and\nwaiting. Comminges, who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal, ran\nin. He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables, and he\nplaced them at the queen's disposal.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Anne of Austria, when D'Artagnan reappeared, \"what does it\nmean?\"\n\n\"It means, madame, that the report has spread that the queen has left\nthe Palais Royal, carrying off the king, and the people ask to have\nproof to the contrary, or threaten to demolish the Palais Royal.\"\n\n\"Oh, this time it is too much!\" exclaimed the queen, \"and I will prove\nto them I have not left.\"\n\nD'Artagnan saw from the expression of the queen's face that she was\nabout to issue some violent command. He approached her and said in a low\nvoice:\n\n\"Has your majesty still confidence in me?\"\n\nThis voice startled her. \"Yes, sir,\" she replied, \"every confidence;\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Will the queen deign to follow my advice?\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Let your majesty dismiss M. de Comminges and desire him to shut himself\nup with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables.\"\n\nComminges glanced at D'Artagnan with the envious look with which every\ncourtier sees a new favorite spring up.\n\n\"You hear, Comminges?\" said the queen.\n\nD'Artagnan went up to him; with his usual quickness he caught the\nanxious glance.\n\n\"Monsieur de Comminges,\" he said, \"pardon me; we both are servants of\nthe queen, are we not? It is my turn to be of use to her; do not envy me\nthis happiness.\"\n\nComminges bowed and left.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I have got one more enemy.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said the queen, addressing D'Artagnan, \"what is to be done?\nfor you hear that, instead of becoming calmer, the noise increases.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said D'Artagnan, \"the people want to see the king and they\nmust see him.\"\n\n\"What! must see him! Where--on the balcony?\"\n\n\"Not at all, madame, but here, sleeping in his bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" exclaimed Laporte, \"Monsieur d'Artagnan is right.\"\n\nThe queen became thoughtful and smiled, like a woman to whom duplicity\nis no stranger.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Monsieur Laporte,\" said D'Artagnan, \"go and announce to the people\nthrough the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five\nminutes they shall not only see the king, but they shall see him in bed;\nadd that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep\nsilence, so as not to awaken him.\"\n\n\"But not every one; a deputation of two or four people.\"\n\n\"Every one, madame.\"\n\n\"But reflect, they will keep us here till daybreak.\"\n\n\"It shall take but a quarter of an hour, I answer for everything,\nmadame; believe me, I know the people; they are like a great child, who\nonly wants humoring. Before the sleeping king they will be mute, gentle\nand timid as lambs.\"\n\n\"Go, Laporte,\" said the queen.\n\nThe young king approached his mother and said, \"Why do as these people\nask?\"\n\n\"It must be so, my son,\" said Anne of Austria.\n\n\"But if they say, 'it must be' to me, am I no longer king?\"\n\nThe queen remained silent.\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"will your majesty permit me to ask you a\nquestion?\"\n\nLouis XIV. turned around, astonished that any one should dare to address\nhim. But the queen pressed the child's hand.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" he said.\n\n\"Does your majesty remember, when playing in the park of Fontainebleau,\nor in the palace courts at Versailles, ever to have seen the sky grow\nsuddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, this noise of thunder, however much your majesty may have\nwished to continue playing, has said, 'go in, sire. You must do so.'\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice\nof God.\"\n\n\"Well then, sire,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"listen to the noise of the\npeople; you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder.\"\n\nIn truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the\nnight breeze; then all at once it ceased.\n\n\"Hold, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"they have just told the people that you\nare asleep; you see, you still are king.\"\n\nThe queen looked with surprise at this strange man, whose brilliant\ncourage made him the equal of the bravest, and who was, by his fine and\nquick intelligence, the equal of the most astute.\n\nLaporte entered.\n\n\"Well, Laporte?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"Madame,\" he replied, \"Monsieur d'Artagnan's prediction has been\naccomplished; they are calm, as if by enchantment. The doors are about\nto be opened and in five minutes they will be here.\"\n\n\"Laporte,\" said the queen, \"suppose you put one of your sons in the\nking's place; we might be off during the time.\"\n\n\"If your majesty desires it,\" said Laporte, \"my sons, like myself, are\nat the queen's service.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said D'Artagnan; \"should one of them know his majesty and\ndiscover but a substitute, all would be lost.\"\n\n\"You are right, sir, always right,\" said Anne of Austria. \"Laporte,\nplace the king in bed.\"\n\nLaporte placed the king, dressed as he was, in the bed and then covered\nhim as far as the shoulders with the sheet. The queen bent over him and\nkissed his brow.\n\n\"Pretend to sleep, Louis,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king, \"but I do not wish to be touched by any of those\nmen.\"\n\n\"Sire, I am here,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and I give you my word, that if a\nsingle man has the audacity, his life shall pay for it.\"\n\n\"And now what is to be done?\" asked the queen, \"for I hear them.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Laporte, go to them and again recommend silence. Madame, wait\nat the door, whilst I shall be at the head of the king's bed, ready to\ndie for him.\"\n\nLaporte went out; the queen remained standing near the hangings, whilst\nD'Artagnan glided behind the curtains.\n\nThen the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard, and\nthe queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her\nlips.\n\nOn seeing the queen, the men stopped short, respectfully.\n\n\"Enter, gentlemen, enter,\" said the queen.\n\nThere was then amongst that crowd a moment's hesitation, which looked\nlike shame. They had expected resistance, they had expected to be\nthwarted, to have to force the gates, to overturn the guards. The gates\nhad opened of themselves, and the king, ostensibly at least, had\nno other guard at his bed-head but his mother. The foremost of them\nstammered and attempted to fall back.\n\n\"Enter, gentlemen,\" said Laporte, \"since the queen desires you so to\ndo.\"\n\nThen one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to\nadvance on tiptoe. This example was imitated by the rest, until the room\nfilled silently, as if these men had been the humblest, most devoted\ncourtiers. Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to\nenter could be seen, all craning to their utmost height to try and see.\n\nD'Artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain, and\nin the very first man who entered he recognized Planchet.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the queen to him, thinking he was the leader of the band,\n\"you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to\nyou myself. Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance\nof people who wish to run away.\"\n\n\"No, certainly,\" replied Planchet, rather astonished at the unexpected\nhonor conferred upon him.\n\n\"You will say, then, to my good and faithful Parisians,\" continued Anne,\nwith a smile, the expression of which did not deceive D'Artagnan, \"that\nyou have seen the king in bed, asleep, and the queen also ready to\nretire.\"\n\n\"I shall tell them, madame, and those who accompany me will say the same\nthing; but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Anne of Austria.\n\n\"Will your majesty pardon me,\" said Planchet, \"but is it really the king\nwho is lying there?\"\n\nAnne of Austria started. \"If,\" she said, \"there is one among you who\nknows the king, let him approach and say whether it is really his\nmajesty lying there.\"\n\nA man wrapped in a cloak, in the folds of which his face was hidden,\napproached and leaned over the bed and looked.\n\nFor one second, D'Artagnan thought the man had some evil design and\nhe put his hand to his sword; but in the movement made by the man in\nstooping a portion of his face was uncovered and D'Artagnan recognized\nthe coadjutor.\n\n\"It is certainly the king,\" said the man, rising again. \"God bless his\nmajesty!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated the leader in a whisper, \"God bless his majesty!\" and\nall these men, who had entered enraged, passed from anger to pity and\nblessed the royal infant in their turn.\n\n\"Now,\" said Planchet, \"let us thank the queen. My friends, retire.\"\n\nThey all bowed, and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had\nentered. Planchet, who had been the first to enter, was the last to\nleave. The queen stopped him.\n\n\"What is your name, my friend?\" she said.\n\nPlanchet, much surprised at the inquiry, turned back.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the queen, \"I think myself as much honored to have\nreceived you this evening as if you had been a prince, and I wish to\nknow your name.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Planchet, \"to treat me as a prince. No, thank you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan trembled lest Planchet, seduced, like the crow in the fable,\nshould tell his name, and that the queen, knowing his name, would\ndiscover that Planchet had belonged to him.\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Planchet, respectfully, \"I am called Dulaurier, at\nyour service.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Monsieur Dulaurier,\" said the queen; \"and what is your\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"Madame, I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais.\"\n\n\"That is all I wished to know,\" said the queen. \"Much obliged to you,\nMonsieur Dulaurier. You will hear again from me.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" thought D'Artagnan, emerging from behind the curtain,\n\"decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool; it is evident he has been\nbrought up in a good school.\"\n\nThe different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another,\nwithout uttering a single word; the queen standing near the door,\nD'Artagnan half out of his hiding place, the king raised on his elbow,\nready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would\nindicate the return of the multitude, but instead of approaching, the\nnoise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away.\n\nThe queen breathed more freely. D'Artagnan wiped his damp forehead and\nthe king slid off his bed, saying, \"Let us go.\"\n\nAt this moment Laporte reappeared.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the queen\n\n\"Well, madame,\" replied the valet, \"I followed them as far as the gates.\nThey announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and\nthat the queen had spoken to them; and, in fact, they went away quite\nproud and happy.\"\n\n\"Oh, the miserable wretches!\" murmured the queen, \"they shall pay dearly\nfor their boldness, and it is I who promise this.\"\n\nThen turning to D'Artagnan, she said:\n\n\"Sir, you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever\nreceived. Continue, and say what we must do now.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Laporte,\" said D'Artagnan, \"finish dressing his majesty.\"\n\n\"We may go, then?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"Whenever your majesty pleases. You have only to descend by the private\nstairs and you will find me at the door.\"\n\n\"Go, sir,\" said the queen; \"I will follow you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the\nmusketeer on the box. D'Artagnan took out the parcel which he had\ndesired Bernouin to place under the seat. It may be remembered that it\nwas the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondy's coachman.\n\nHe placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head, whilst the\nmusketeer got off the box.\n\n\"Sir,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you will go and release your companion, who is\nguarding the coachman. You must mount your horse and proceed to the Rue\nTiquetonne, Hotel de la Chevrette, whence you will take my horse and\nthat of Monsieur du Vallon, which you must saddle and equip as if for\nwar, and then you will leave Paris, bringing them with you to Cours la\nReine. If, when you arrive at Cours la Reine, you find no one, you must\ngo on to Saint Germain. On the king's service.\"\n\nThe musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus\nreceived.\n\nD'Artagnan mounted the box, having a pair of pistols in his belt, a\nmusket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.\n\nThe queen appeared, and was followed by the king and the Duke d'Anjou,\nhis brother.\n\n\"Monsieur the coadjutor's carriage!\" she exclaimed, falling back.\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but get in fearlessly, for I myself\nwill drive you.\"\n\nThe queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage, and the\nking and monsieur took their places at her side.\n\n\"Come, Laporte,\" said the queen.\n\n\"How, madame!\" said the valet, \"in the same carriage as your majesties?\"\n\n\"It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening, but of the king's\nsafety. Get in, Laporte.\"\n\nLaporte obeyed.\n\n\"Pull down the blinds,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But will that not excite suspicion, sir?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"Your majesty's mind may be quite at ease,\" replied the officer; \"I have\nmy answer ready.\"\n\nThe blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue\nRichelieu. On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the\nhead of a dozen men, holding a lantern in his hand.\n\nD'Artagnan signed to them to draw near.\n\n\"Do you recognize the carriage?\" he asked the sergeant.\n\n\"No,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"Look at the arms.\"\n\nThe sergeant put the lantern near the panel.\n\n\"They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur,\" he said.\n\n\"Hush; he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee.\"\n\nThe sergeant began to laugh.\n\n\"Open the gate,\" he cried. \"I know who it is!\" Then putting his face to\nthe lowered blinds, he said:\n\n\"I wish you joy, my lord!\"\n\n\"Impudent fellow!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"you will get me turned off.\"\n\nThe gate groaned on its hinges, and D'Artagnan, seeing the way clear,\nwhipped his horses, who started at a canter, and five minutes later they\nhad rejoined the cardinal.\n\n\"Mousqueton!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"draw up the blinds of his majesty's\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"It is he!\" cried Porthos.\n\n\"Disguised as a coachman!\" exclaimed Mazarin.\n\n\"And driving the coadjutor's carriage!\" said the queen.\n\n\"Corpo di Dio! Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" said Mazarin, \"you are worth your\nweight in gold.\"\n\n\n\n\n53. How D'Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw, the one Two\nHundred and Nineteen, and the other Two Hundred and Fifteen Louis d'or.\n\n\n\nMazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain, but\nthe queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had\nappointed to meet her. However, she offered the cardinal Laporte's\nplace, which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other.\n\nIt was not without foundation that a report of the king's intention to\nleave Paris by night had been circulated. Ten or twelve persons had\nbeen in the secret since six o'clock, and howsoever great their prudence\nmight be, they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure\nwithout suspicion being generated. Besides, each individual had one or\ntwo others for whom he was interested; and as there could be no doubt\nbut that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible projects of\nvengeance, every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to\ntranspire; so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of\nlighted gunpowder along the streets.\n\nThe first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of\nthe Prince de Conde, with the princess and dowager princess. Both these\nladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know\nwhat it all was about. The second contained the Duke and Duchess of\nOrleans, the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbe de la Riviere; and\nthe third, the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti, brother and\nbrother-in-law of Conde. They all alighted and hastened to pay their\nrespects to the king and queen in their coach. The queen fixed her eyes\nupon the carriage they had left, and seeing that it was empty, she said:\n\n\"But where is Madame de Longueville?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, where is my sister?\" asked the prince.\n\n\"Madame de Longueville is ill,\" said the duke, \"and she desired me to\nexcuse her to your majesty.\"\n\nAnne gave a quick glance to Mazarin, who answered by an almost\nimperceptible shake of his head.\n\n\"What do you say of this?\" asked the queen.\n\n\"I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians,\" answered the cardinal.\n\n\"Why is she not come?\" asked the prince in a low voice, addressing his\nbrother.\n\n\"Silence,\" whispered the duke, \"she has her reasons.\"\n\n\"She will ruin us!\" returned the prince.\n\n\"She will save us,\" said Conti.\n\nCarriages now arrived in crowds; those of the Marechal de Villeroy,\nGuitant, Villequier and Comminges came into the line. The two musketeers\narrived in their turn, holding the horses of D'Artagnan and Porthos in\ntheir hands. These two instantly mounted, the coachman of the latter\nreplacing D'Artagnan on the coach-box of the royal coach. Mousqueton\ntook the place of the coachman, and drove standing, for reasons known to\nhimself, like Automedon of antiquity.\n\nThe queen, though occupied by a thousand details, tried to catch the\nGascon's eye; but he, with his wonted prudence, had mingled with the\ncrowd.\n\n\"Let us be the avant guard,\" said he to Porthos, \"and find good quarters\nat Saint Germain; nobody will think of us, and for my part I am greatly\nfatigued.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" replied Porthos, \"I am falling asleep, which is strange,\nconsidering we have not had any fighting; truly the Parisians are\nidiots.\"\n\n\"Or rather, we are very clever,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"And how is your wrist?\"\n\n\"Better; but do you think that we've got them this time?\"\n\n\"Got what?\"\n\n\"You your command, and I my title?\"\n\n\"I'faith! yes--I should expect so; besides, if they forget, I shall take\nthe liberty of reminding them.\"\n\n\"The queen's voice! she is speaking,\" said Porthos; \"I think she wants\nto ride on horseback.\"\n\n\"Oh, she would like it, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The cardinal won't allow it. Gentlemen,\" he said, addressing the two\nmusketeers, \"accompany the royal carriage, we are going forward to look\nfor lodgings.\"\n\nD'Artagnan started off for Saint Germain, followed by Porthos.\n\n\"We will go on, gentlemen,\" said the queen.\n\nAnd the royal carriage drove on, followed by the other coaches and about\nfifty horsemen.\n\nThey reached Saint German without any accident; on descending, the queen\nfound the prince awaiting her, bare-headed, to offer her his hand.\n\n\"What an awakening for the Parisians!\" said the queen, radiant.\n\n\"It is war,\" said the prince.\n\n\"Well, then, let it be war! Have we not on our side the conqueror of\nRocroy, of Nordlingen, of Lens?\"\n\nThe prince bowed low.\n\nIt was then three o'clock in the morning. The queen walked first, every\none followed her. About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her\nflight.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the queen, laughing, \"pray take up your abode in the\nchateau; it is large, and there will be no want of room for you all;\nbut, as we never thought of coming here, I am informed that there are,\nin all, only three beds in the whole establishment, one for the king,\none for me----\"\n\n\"And one for the cardinal,\" muttered the prince.\n\n\"Am I--am I, then, to sleep on the floor?\" asked Gaston d'Orleans, with\na forced smile.\n\n\"No, my prince,\" replied Mazarin, \"the third bed is intended for your\nhighness.\"\n\n\"But your eminence?\" replied the prince.\n\n\"I,\" answered Mazarin, \"I shall not sleep at all; I have work to do.\"\n\nGaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to\nsleep, without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and\ndaughter were to repose.\n\n\"Well, for my part, I shall go to bed,\" said D'Artagnan; \"come,\nPorthos.\"\n\nPorthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever\nhad in the wisdom of his friend. They walked from one end of the chateau\nto the other, Porthos looking with wondering eyes at D'Artagnan, who was\ncounting on his fingers.\n\n\"Four hundred, at a pistole each, four hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interposed Porthos, \"four hundred pistoles; but who is to make\nfour hundred pistoles?\"\n\n\"A pistole is not enough,\" said D'Artagnan, \"'tis worth a louis.\"\n\n\"What is worth a louis?\"\n\n\"Four hundred, at a louis each, make four hundred louis.\"\n\n\"Four hundred?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Yes, there are two hundred of them, and each of them will need two,\nwhich will make four hundred.\"\n\n\"But four hundred what?\"\n\n\"Listen!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\nBut as there were all kinds of people about, who were in a state of\nstupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court, he whispered in his\nfriend's ear.\n\n\"I understand,\" answered Porthos, \"I understand you perfectly, on my\nhonor; two hundred louis, each of us, would be making a pretty thing of\nit; but what will people say?\"\n\n\"Let them say what they will; besides, how will they know that we are\ndoing it?\"\n\n\"But who will distribute these things?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Isn't Mousqueton there?\"\n\n\"But he wears my livery; my livery will be known,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"He can turn his coat inside out.\"\n\n\"You are always in the right, my dear friend,\" cried Porthos; \"but where\nthe devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice?\"\n\nD'Artagnan smiled. The two friends turned down the first street they\ncame to. Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right, whilst\nD'Artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left.\n\n\"Some straw,\" they said.\n\n\"Sir, we don't keep any,\" was the reply of the people who opened the\ndoors; \"but please ask at the hay dealer's.\"\n\n\"Where is the hay dealer's?\"\n\n\"At the last large door in the street.\"\n\n\"Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw?\"\n\n\"Yes; there's the landlord of the Lamb, and Gros-Louis the farmer; they\nboth live in the Rue des Ursulines.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nD'Artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for\na hundred and fifty trusses of straw, which he obtained, at the rate of\nthree pistoles each. He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from\nhim two hundred trusses at the same price. Finally, Farmer Louis sold\nthem eighty trusses, making in all four hundred and thirty.\n\nThere was no more to be had in Saint Germain. This foraging did not\noccupy more than half an hour. Mousqueton, duly instructed, was put at\nthe head of this sudden and new business. He was cautioned not to let\na bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss, and they\nintrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis.\nD'Artagnan, taking with him three trusses of straw, returned to the\nchateau, where everybody, freezing with cold and more than half asleep,\nenvied the king, the queen, and the Duke of Orleans, on their camp beds.\nThe lieutenant's entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great\ndrawing-room; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of\ngeneral attention, but began to arrange, with so much cleverness, nicety\nand gayety, his straw bed, that the mouths of all these poor creatures,\nwho could not go to sleep, began to water.\n\n\"Straw!\" they all cried out, \"straw! where is there any to be found?\"\n\n\"I can show you,\" answered the Gascon.\n\nAnd he conducted them to Mousqueton, who freely distributed the trusses\nat the rate of a louis apiece. It was thought rather dear, but people\nwanted to sleep, and who would not give even two or three louis for a\nfew hours of sound sleep?\n\nD'Artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it, making it over\nabout a dozen times; and since he was supposed to have paid, like the\nothers, a louis for his truss of straw, he pocketed in that way thirty\nlouis in less than half an hour. At five o'clock in the morning the\nstraw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had.\n\nD'Artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his\nown use. He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden\nthem, and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton,\nwho, naively, and like the worthy steward that he was, handed them four\nhundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself.\n\nMousqueton, who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau,\nwondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner. D'Artagnan\nput the gold in his hat, and in going back to the chateau settled the\nreckoning with Porthos, each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen\nlouis.\n\nPorthos, however, found that he had no straw left for himself. He\nreturned to Mousqueton, but the steward had sold the last wisp. He then\nrepaired to D'Artagnan, who, thanks to his four trusses of straw, was in\nthe act of making up and tasting, by anticipation, the luxury of a bed\nso soft, so well stuffed at the head, so well covered at the foot, that\nit would have excited the envy of the king himself, if his majesty had\nnot been fast asleep in his own. D'Artagnan could on no account consent\nto pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos, but for a consideration of\nfour louis that the latter paid him for it, he consented that Porthos\nshould share his couch with him. He laid his sword at the head, his\npistols by his side, stretched his cloak over his feet, placed his felt\nhat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the\nstraw, which rustled under him. He was already enjoying the sweet dream\nengendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis, made in\na quarter of an hour, when a voice was heard at the door of the hall,\nwhich made him stir.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" it cried.\n\n\"Here!\" cried Porthos, \"here!\"\n\nPorthos foresaw that if D'Artagnan was called away he should remain the\nsole possessor of the bed. An officer approached.\n\n\"I am come to fetch you, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"His eminence sent me.\"\n\n\"Tell my lord that I'm going to sleep, and I advise him, as a friend, to\ndo the same.\"\n\n\"His eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed, and wants you\ninstantly.\"\n\n\"The devil take Mazarin, who does not know when to sleep at the proper\ntime. What does he want with me? Is it to make me a captain? In that\ncase I will forgive him.\"\n\nAnd the musketeer rose, grumbling, took his sword, hat, pistols,\nand cloak, and followed the officer, whilst Porthos, alone and sole\npossessor of the bed, endeavored to follow the good example of falling\nasleep, which his predecessor had set him.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the cardinal, on perceiving him, \"I have not\nforgotten with what zeal you have served me. I am going to prove to you\nthat I have not.\"\n\n\"Good,\" thought the Gascon, \"this is a promising beginning.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" he resumed, \"do you wish to become a captain?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"And your friend still longs to be made a baron?\"\n\n\"At this very moment, my lord, he no doubt dreams that he is one\nalready.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mazarin, taking from his portfolio the letter which he had\nalready shown D'Artagnan, \"take this dispatch and carry it to England.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at the envelope; there was no address on it.\n\n\"Am I not to know to whom to present it?\"\n\n\"You will know when you reach London; at London you may tear off the\nouter envelope.\"\n\n\"And what are my instructions?\"\n\n\"To obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed.\nYou must set out for Boulogne. At the Royal Arms of England you will\nfind a young gentleman named Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; and what am I to do with this young gentleman?\"\n\n\"Follow wherever he leads you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air.\n\n\"There are your instructions,\" said Mazarin; \"go!\"\n\n\"Go! 'tis easy to say so, but that requires money, and I haven't any.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Mazarin, \"so you have no money?\"\n\n\"None, my lord.\"\n\n\"But the diamond I gave you yesterday?\"\n\n\"I wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence.\"\n\nMazarin sighed.\n\n\"'Tis very dear living in England, my lord, especially as envoy\nextraordinary.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" replied Mazarin, \"the people there are very sedate, and their\nhabits, since the revolution, simple; but no matter.\"\n\nHe opened a drawer and took out a purse.\n\n\"What do you say to a thousand crowns?\"\n\nD'Artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner.\n\n\"I reply, my lord, 'tis but little, as certainly I shall not go alone.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. Monsieur du Vallon, that worthy gentleman, for, with the\nexception of yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, there's not a man in France\nthat I esteem and love so much as him----\"\n\n\"Then, my lord,\" replied D'Artagnan, pointing to the purse which Mazarin\nstill held, \"if you love and esteem him so much, you--understand me?\"\n\n\"Be it so! on his account I add two hundred crowns.\"\n\n\"Scoundrel!\" muttered D'Artagnan. \"But on our return,\" he said aloud,\n\"may we, that is, my friend and I, depend on having, he his barony, and\nI my promotion?\"\n\n\"On the honor of Mazarin.\"\n\n\"I should like another sort of oath better,\" said D'Artagnan to himself;\nthen aloud, \"May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen?\"\n\n\"Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly,\" replied Mazarin;\n\"go, pray, sir----\"\n\n\"One word more, my lord; if there's any fighting where I'm going, must I\nfight?\"\n\n\"You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed\nthe inclosed letter.\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" said D'Artagnan, holding out his hand to receive the money.\n\"I offer my best respects and services to you, my lord.\"\n\nD'Artagnan then, returning to the officer, said:\n\n\"Sir, have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to\nsay 'tis by his eminence's order, and that I shall await him at the\nstables.\"\n\nThe officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he\nhad some personal interest in the matter.\n\nPorthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"I come from the cardinal,\" said the officer.\n\n\"Heigho!\" said Porthos, opening his large eyes; \"what have you got to\nsay?\"\n\n\"That his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur\nd'Artagnan is waiting for you in the stables.\"\n\nPorthos sighed heavily, arose, took his hat, his pistols, and his cloak,\nand departed, casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped\nto sleep so well.\n\nNo sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in\nit, and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor, in\nhis turn, was snoring immoderately. It was very natural, he being the\nonly person in the whole assemblage, except the king, the queen, and the\nDuke of Orleans, who slept gratuitously.\n\n\n\n\n54. In which we hear Tidings of Aramis.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan went straight to the stables; day was just dawning. He found\nhis horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger, but to an empty\nmanger. He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the\nstable, where he saw a little straw, but in doing so he struck his\nfoot against a human body, which uttered a cry and arose on its knees,\nrubbing its eyes. It was Mousqueton, who, having no straw to lie upon,\nhad helped himself to that of the horses.\n\n\"Mousqueton,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"let us be off! Let us set off.\"\n\nMousqueton, recognizing the voice of his master's friend, got up\nsuddenly, and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated\nto himself illegally during the night.\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, picking up a louis and displaying it;\n\"here's a louis that smells confoundedly of straw.\"\n\nMousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him\nand said:\n\n\"Porthos would be angry, my dear Monsieur Mousqueton, but I pardon\nyou, only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke, so be\ngay--come along.\"\n\nMousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance, saddled the horses\nquickly and mounted his own without making faces over it.\n\nWhilst this went on, Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face,\nand was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost\nmerry.\n\n\"Ah, that's it!\" he cried, \"you have your promotion and I my barony.\"\n\n\"We are going to fetch our brevets,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and when we come\nback, Master Mazarin will sign them.\"\n\n\"And where are we going?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"To Paris first; I have affairs to settle.\"\n\nAnd they both set out for Paris.\n\nOn arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening\naspect of the capital. Around a broken-down carriage the people were\nuttering imprecations, whilst the persons who had attempted to escape\nwere made prisoners--that is to say, an old man and two women. On the\nother hand, as the two friends approached to enter, they showed them\nevery kind of civility, thinking them deserters from the royal party and\nwishing to bind them to their own.\n\n\"What is the king doing?\" they asked.\n\n\"He is asleep.\"\n\n\"And the Spanish woman?\"\n\n\"Dreaming.\"\n\n\"And the cursed Italian?\"\n\n\"He is awake, so keep on the watch, as they are gone away; it's for some\npurpose, rely on it. But as you are the strongest, after all,\" continued\nD'Artagnan, \"don't be furious with old men and women, and keep your\nwrath for more appropriate occasions.\"\n\nThe people listened to these words and let go the ladies, who thanked\nD'Artagnan with an eloquent look.\n\n\"Now! onward!\" cried the Gascon.\n\nAnd they continued their way, crossing the barricades, getting the\nchains about their legs, pushed about, questioning and questioned.\n\nIn the place of the Palais Royal D'Artagnan saw a sergeant, who was\ndrilling six or seven hundred citizens. It was Planchet, who brought\ninto play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont.\n\nIn passing before D'Artagnan he recognized his former master.\n\n\"Good-day, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Planchet proudly.\n\n\"Good-day, Monsieur Dulaurier,\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\nPlanchet stopped short, staring at D'Artagnan. The first row, seeing\ntheir sergeant stop, stopped in their turn, and so on to the very last.\n\n\"These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous,\" observed D'Artagnan to\nPorthos and went on his way.\n\nFive minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette, where\npretty Madeleine, the hostess, came to him.\n\n\"My dear Mistress Turquaine,\" said the Gascon, \"if you happen to have\nany money, lock it up quickly; if you happen to have any jewels, hide\nthem directly; if you happen to have any debtors, make them pay you, or\nany creditors, don't pay them.\"\n\n\"Why, prithee?\" asked Madeleine.\n\n\"Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Babylon, of\nwhich you have no doubt heard tell.\"\n\n\"And are you going to leave me at such a time?\"\n\n\"This very instant.\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\"\n\n\"Ah, if you could tell me that, you would be doing me a service.\"\n\n\"Ah, me! ah, me!\n\n\"Have you any letters for me?\" inquired D'Artagnan, wishing to signify\nto the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore\nshe had better spare him demonstrations of her grief.\n\n\"There's one just arrived,\" and she handed the letter to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"From Athos!\" cried D'Artagnan, recognizing the handwriting.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, \"let us hear what he says.\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:\n\n\n\n\"Dear D'Artagnan, dear Du Vallon, my good friends, perhaps this may be\nthe last time that you will ever hear from me. Aramis and I are very\nunhappy; but God, our courage, and the remembrance of our friendship\nsustain us. Think often of Raoul. I intrust to you certain papers which\nare at Blois; and in two months and a half, if you do not hear of us,\ntake possession of them.\n\n\"Embrace, with all your heart, the vicomte, for your devoted, friend,\n\n\"ATHOS.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe, by Heaven,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that I shall embrace him,\nsince he's upon our road; and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our\ndear Athos, from that very day he becomes my son.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Porthos, \"shall make him my sole heir.\"\n\n\"Let us see, what more does Athos say?\"\n\n\n\n\"Should you meet on your journey a certain Monsieur Mordaunt, distrust\nhim, in a letter I cannot say more.\"\n\n\n\n\"Monsieur Mordaunt!\" exclaimed the Gascon, surprised.\n\n\"Monsieur Mordaunt! 'tis well,\" said Porthos, \"we shall remember that;\nbut see, there is a postscript from Aramis.\"\n\n\"So there is,\" said D'Artagnan, and he read:\n\n\n\n\"We conceal the place where we are, dear friends, knowing your brotherly\naffection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Confound it,\" interrupted Porthos, with an explosion of passion which\nsent Mousqueton to the other end of the room; \"are they in danger of\ndying?\"\n\nD'Artagnan continued:\n\n\n\n\"Athos bequeaths to you Raoul, and I bequeath to you my revenge. If by\nany good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt, tell\nPorthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck. I dare not say\nmore in a letter.\n\n\"ARAMIS.\"\n\n\n\"If that is all, it is easily done,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" observed D'Artagnan, with a vexed look; \"it would be\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at\nBoulogne and with whom we cross to England.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go\nand join our friends?\" said Porthos, with a gesture fierce enough to\nhave frightened an army.\n\n\"I did think of it, but this letter has neither date nor postmark.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Porthos. And he began to wander about the room like a man\nbeside himself, gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the\nscabbard.\n\nAs to D'Artagnan, he remained standing like a man in consternation, with\nthe deepest affliction depicted on his face.\n\n\"Ah, this is not right; Athos insults us; he wishes to die alone; it is\nbad, bad, bad.\"\n\nMousqueton, witnessing this despair, melted into tears in a corner of\nthe room.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"all this leads to nothing. Let us go on. We\nwill embrace Raoul, and perhaps he will have news of Athos.\"\n\n\"Stop--an idea!\" cried Porthos; \"indeed, my dear D'Artagnan, I don't\nknow how you manage, but you are always full of ideas; let us go and\nembrace Raoul.\"\n\n\"Woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this\nmoment,\" said Mousqueton to himself; \"I wouldn't give a farthing for his\nlife.\"\n\nThey set out. On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis, the friends found a\nvast concourse of people. It was the Duc de Beaufort, who was coming\nfrom the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians,\nintoxicated with joy. With the duke's aid they already considered\nthemselves invincible.\n\nThe two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the\nprince, and so reached the Saint Denis gate.\n\n\"Is it true,\" said the guard to the two cavaliers, \"that the Duc de\nBeaufort has arrived in Paris?\"\n\n\"Nothing more certain; and the best proof of it is,\" said D'Artagnan,\n\"that he has dispatched us to meet the Duc de Vendome, his father, who\nis coming in his turn.\"\n\n\"Long live De Beaufort!\" cried the guards, and they drew back\nrespectfully to let the two friends pass. Once across the barriers these\ntwo knew neither fatigue nor fear. Their horses flew, and they never\nceased speaking of Athos and Aramis.\n\nThe camp had entered Saint Omer; the friends made a little detour and\nwent to the camp, and gave the army an exact account of the flight of\nthe king and queen. They found Raoul near his tent, reclining on a truss\nof hay, of which his horse stole some mouthfuls; the young man's eyes\nwere red and he seemed dejected. The Marechal de Grammont and the Comte\nde Guiche had returned to Paris and he was quite lonely. And as soon as\nhe saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms.\n\n\"Oh, is it you, dear friends? Did you come here to fetch me? Will you\ntake me away with you? Do you bring me tidings of my guardian?\"\n\n\"Have you not received any?\" said D'Artagnan to the youth.\n\n\"Alas! sir, no, and I do not know what has become of him; so that I am\nreally so unhappy that I weep.\"\n\nIn fact, tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nPorthos turned aside, in order not to show by his honest round face what\nwas passing in his mind.\n\n\"Deuce take it!\" cried D'Artagnan, more moved than he had been for\na long time, \"don't despair, my friend, if you have not received any\nletters from the count, we have received one.\"\n\n\"Oh, really!\" cried Raoul.\n\n\"And a comforting one, too,\" added D'Artagnan, seeing the delight that\nhis intelligence gave the young man.\n\n\"Have you it?\" asked Raoul\n\n\"Yes--that is, I had it,\" repined the Gascon, making believe to find it.\n\"Wait, it ought to be there in my pocket; it speaks of his return, does\nit not, Porthos?\"\n\nAll Gascon as he was, D'Artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that\nfalsehood.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Porthos, coughing.\n\n\"Eh, give it to me!\" said the young man.\n\n\"Eh! I read it a little while since. Can I have lost it? Ah! confound\nit! yes, my pocket has a hole in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Monsieur Raoul!\" said Mousqueton, \"the letter was very\nconsoling. These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy.\"\n\n\"But at any rate, you know where he is, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" asked\nRaoul, somewhat comforted.\n\n\"Ah! that's the thing!\" replied the Gascon. \"Undoubtedly I know it, but\nit is a mystery.\"\n\n\"Not to me, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, not to you, so I am going to tell you where he is.\"\n\nPorthos devoured D'Artagnan with wondering eyes.\n\n\"Where the devil shall I say that he is, so that he cannot try to rejoin\nhim?\" thought D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, where is he, sir?\" asked Raoul, in a soft and coaxing voice.\n\n\"He is at Constantinople.\"\n\n\"Among the Turks!\" exclaimed Raoul, alarmed. \"Good heavens! how can you\ntell me that?\"\n\n\"Does that alarm you?\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Pooh! what are the Turks to\nsuch men as the Comte de la Fere and the Abbe d'Herblay?\"\n\n\"Ah, his friend is with him?\" said Raoul. \"That comforts me a little.\"\n\n\"Has he wit or not--this demon D'Artagnan?\" said Porthos, astonished at\nhis friend's deception.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said D'Artagnan, wishing to change the conversation, \"here\nare fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier. I\nsuppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome.\"\n\n\"I have still twenty pistoles, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, take them; that makes seventy.\"\n\n\"And if you wish for more,\" said Porthos, putting his hand to his\npocket----\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Raoul, blushing; \"thank you a thousand times.\"\n\nAt this moment Olivain appeared. \"Apropos,\" said D'Artagnan, loud enough\nfor the servant to hear him, \"are you satisfied with Olivain?\"\n\n\"Yes, in some respects, tolerably well.\"\n\nOlivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent.\n\n\"What fault do you find with the fellow?\"\n\n\"He is a glutton.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" cried Olivain, reappearing at this accusation.\n\n\"And a little bit of a thief.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir! oh!\"\n\n\"And, more especially, a notorious coward.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! sir! you really vilify me!\" cried Olivain.\n\n\"The deuce!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Pray learn, Monsieur Olivain, that\npeople like us are not to be served by cowards. Rob your master, eat his\nsweetmeats, and drink his wine; but, by Jove! don't be a coward, or I\nshall cut off your ears. Look at Monsieur Mouston, see the honorable\nwounds he has received, observe how his habitual valor has given dignity\nto his countenance.\"\n\nMousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced D'Artagnan\nhad he dared; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the\nnext occasion that presented itself.\n\n\"Send away that fellow, Raoul,\" said the Gascon; \"for if he's a coward\nhe will disgrace thee some day.\"\n\n\"Monsieur says I am coward,\" cried Olivain, \"because he wanted the other\nday to fight a cornet in Grammont's regiment and I refused to accompany\nhim.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Olivain, a lackey ought never to disobey,\" said D'Artagnan,\nsternly; then taking him aside, he whispered to him: \"Thou hast done\nright; thy master was in the wrong; here's a crown for thee, but should\nhe ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for\nhim, I will cut out thy tongue. Remember that.\"\n\nOlivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket.\n\n\"And now, Raoul,\" said the Gascon, \"Monsieur du Vallon and I are going\naway as ambassadors, where, I know not; but should you want anything,\nwrite to Madame Turquaine, at La Chevrette, Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon\nher purse as on a banker--with economy; for it is not so well filled as\nthat of Monsieur d'Emery.\"\n\nAnd having, meantime, embraced his ward, he passed him into the robust\narms of Porthos, who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment\nsuspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"let us go.\"\n\nAnd they set out for Boulogne, where toward evening they arrived, their\nhorses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration.\n\nAt ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black,\nwho seemed waiting for some one, and who, from the moment he saw them\nenter the town, never took his eyes off them.\n\nD'Artagnan approached him, and seeing him stare so fixedly, said:\n\n\"Well, friend! I don't like people to quiz me!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the young man, \"do you not come from Paris, if you please?\"\n\nD'Artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said, in a softened tone.\n\n\"Are you not going to put up at the 'Arms of England'?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence, Cardinal\nMazarin?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In that case, I am the man you have to do with. I am M. Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought D'Artagnan, \"the man I am warned against by Athos.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought Porthos, \"the man Aramis wants me to strangle.\"\n\nThey both looked searchingly at the young man, who misunderstood the\nmeaning of that inquisition.\n\n\"Do you doubt my word?\" he said. \"In that case I can give you proofs.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and we place ourselves at your orders.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumed Mordaunt, \"we must set out without delay,\nto-day is the last day granted me by the cardinal. My ship is ready, and\nhad you not come I must have set off without you, for General Cromwell\nexpects my return impatiently.\"\n\n\"So!\" thought the lieutenant, \"'tis to General Cromwell that our\ndispatches are addressed.\"\n\n\"Have you no letter for him?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"I have one, the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London;\nbut since you tell me to whom it is addressed, 'tis useless to wait till\nthen.\"\n\nD'Artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter. It was directed to\n\"Monsieur Oliver Cromwell, General of the Army of the English Nation.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan; \"a singular commission.\"\n\n\"Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell?\" inquired Porthos.\n\n\"Formerly a brewer,\" replied the Gascon.\n\n\"Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer, as we did in\nstraw,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Come, come, gentlemen,\" said Mordaunt, impatiently, \"let us depart.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Porthos \"without supper? Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait\na little?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I?\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"Well, you,\" said Porthos, \"what then?\"\n\n\"I cannot wait.\"\n\n\"Oh! as to you, that is not my concern, and I shall sup either with or\nwithout your permission.\"\n\nThe young man's eyes kindled in secret, but he restrained himself.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you must excuse famished travelers.\nBesides, our supper can't delay you much. We will hasten on to the inn;\nyou will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor. We will take a bite\nand shall be there as soon as you are.\"\n\n\"Just as you please, gentlemen, provided we set sail,\" he said.\n\n\"The name of your ship?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"The Standard.\"\n\n\"Very well; in half an hour we shall be on board.\"\n\nAnd the friends, spurring on their horses, rode to the hotel, the \"Arms\nof England.\"\n\n\"What do you say of that young man?\" asked D'Artagnan, as they hurried\nalong.\n\n\"I say that he doesn't suit me at all,\" said Porthos, \"and that I feel a\nstrong itching to follow Aramis's advice.\"\n\n\"By no means, my dear Porthos; that man is a messenger of General\nCromwell; it would insure for us a poor reception, I imagine, should it\nbe announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Porthos, \"I have always noticed that Aramis gives\ngood advice.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" returned D'Artagnan, \"when our embassy is finished----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"If it brings us back to France----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see.\"\n\nAt that moment the two friends reached the hotel, \"Arms of England,\"\nwhere they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the\nport.\n\nThere they found a brig ready to set sail, upon the deck of which they\nrecognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently.\n\n\"It is singular,\" said D'Artagnan, whilst the boat was taking them to\nthe Standard, \"it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I\nmust have known, but who it was I cannot yet remember.\"\n\nA few minutes later they were on board, but the embarkation of the\nhorses was a longer matter than that of the men, and it was eight\no'clock before they raised anchor.\n\nThe young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread.\n\nPorthos, completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey\nof seventy leagues on horseback, retired to his cabin and went to sleep.\n\nD'Artagnan, overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt, walked with him upon\nthe deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk.\n\nMousqueton was seasick.\n\n\n\n\n55. The Scotchman.\n\n\n\nAnd now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably, not\ntoward London, where D'Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going,\nbut to Durham, whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter\nhe had received during his sojourn at Boulogne, and accompany us to the\nroyalist camp, on this side of the Tyne, near Newcastle.\n\nThere, placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland, but still\non English soil, the tents of a little army extended. It was midnight.\nSome Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch. The moon, which was\npartially obscured by heavy clouds, now and then lit up the muskets of\nthe sentinels, or silvered the walls, the roofs, and the spires of the\ntown that Charles I. had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops,\nwhilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming\nto some arrangement.\n\nAt one of the extremities of the camp, near an immense tent, in which\nthe Scottish officers were holding a kind of council, presided over by\nLord Leven, their commander, a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on\nthe turf, his right hand extended over his sword.\n\nAbout fifty paces off, another man, also appareled as a cavalier, was\ntalking to a Scotch sentinel, and, though a foreigner, he seemed to\nunderstand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad\nPerthshire dialect.\n\nAs the town clock of Newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke, and with\nall the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked\nattentively about him; perceiving that he was alone he rose and making\na little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the\nsentinel. The former had no doubt finished his questions, for a moment\nlater he said good-night and carelessly followed the same path taken by\nthe first cavalier.\n\nIn the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend?\" said he, in as pure French as has ever been\nuttered between Rouen and Tours.\n\n\"Well, my friend, there is not a moment to lose; we must let the king\nknow immediately.\"\n\n\"Why, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"It would take too long to tell you, besides, you will hear it all\ndirectly and the least word dropped here might ruin all. We must go and\nfind Lord Winter.\"\n\nThey both set off to the other end of the camp, but as it did not cover\nmore than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the\ntent they were looking for.\n\n\"Tony, is your master sleeping?\" said one of the two cavaliers to a\nservant who was lying in the outer compartment, which served as a kind\nof ante-room.\n\n\"No, monsieur le comte,\" answered the servant, \"I think not; or at least\nhe has not long been so, for he was pacing up and down for more than two\nhours after he left the king, and the sound of his footsteps has only\nceased during the last ten minutes. However, you may look and see,\"\nadded the lackey, raising the curtained entrance of the tent.\n\nLord Winter was seated near an aperture, arranged as a window to let in\nthe night air, his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon,\nintermittently veiled, as we before observed, by heavy clouds. The two\nfriends approached Winter, who, with his head on his hands, was gazing\nat the heavens; he did not hear them enter and remained in the same\nattitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder.\n\nHe turned around, recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to\nthem.\n\n\"Have you observed,\" said he to them, \"what a blood-red color the moon\nhas to-night?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Athos; \"I thought it looked much the same as usual.\"\n\n\"Look, again, chevalier,\" returned Lord Winter.\n\n\"I must own,\" said Aramis, \"I am like the Comte de la Fere--I can see\nnothing remarkable about it.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"in a position so precarious as ours we must\nexamine the earth and not the heavens. Have you studied our Scotch\ntroops and have you confidence in them?\"\n\n\"The Scotch?\" inquired Winter. \"What Scotch?\"\n\n\"Ours, egad!\" exclaimed Athos. \"Those in whom the king has\nconfided--Lord Leven's Highlanders.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Winter, then he paused; \"but tell me, can you not perceive\nthe russet tint which marks the heavens?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world,\" said Aramis and Athos at once.\n\n\"Tell me,\" continued Winter, always possessed by the same idea, \"is\nthere not a tradition in France that Henry IV., the evening before\nthe day he was assassinated, when he was playing at chess with M. de\nBassompiere, saw clots of blood upon the chessboard?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"and the marechal has often told me so himself.\"\n\n\"Then it was so,\" murmured Winter, \"and the next day Henry IV. was\nkilled.\"\n\n\"But what has this vision of Henry IV. to do with you, my lord?\"\ninquired Aramis.\n\n\"Nothing; and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things, when your\ncoming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of\nimportant news.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said Athos, \"I wish to speak to the king.\"\n\n\"To the king! but the king is asleep.\"\n\n\"I have something important to reveal to him.\"\n\n\"Can it not be put off till to-morrow?\"\n\n\"He must know it this moment, and perhaps it is already too late.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Lord Winter.\n\nLord Winter's tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee, a kind\nof corridor communicating between the two. This corridor was guarded,\nnot by a sentinel, but by a confidential servant, through whom, in\ncase of urgency, Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful\nsubject.\n\n\"These gentlemen are with me,\" said Winter.\n\nThe lackey bowed and let them pass. As he had said, on a camp bed,\ndressed in his black doublet, booted, unbelted, with his felt hat beside\nhim, lay the king, overcome by sleep and fatigue. They advanced, and\nAthos, who was the first to enter, gazed a moment in silence on that\npale and noble face, framed in its long and now untidy, matted hair, the\nblue veins showing through the transparent temples, his eyes seemingly\nswollen by tears.\n\nAthos sighed deeply; the sigh woke the king, so lightly did he sleep.\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, raising himself on his elbow, \"is it you, Comte de la\nFere?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news?\"\n\n\"Alas, sire,\" answered Athos, \"your majesty has guessed aright.\"\n\n\"It is bad news?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Never mind; the messenger is welcome. You never come to me without\nconferring pleasure. You whose devotion recognizes neither country\nnor misfortune, you who are sent to me by Henrietta; whatever news you\nbring, speak out.\"\n\n\"Sire, Cromwell has arrived this night at Newcastle.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the king, \"to fight?\"\n\n\"No, sire, but to buy your majesty.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said, sire, that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the\nScottish army.\"\n\n\"For unpaid wages; yes, I know it. For the last year my faithful\nHighlanders have fought for honor alone.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"Well, sir, though honor is a fine thing, they are tired of fighting\nfor it, and to-night they have sold you for two hundred thousand\npounds--that is to say, for half what is owing them.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried the king, \"the Scotch sell their king for two\nhundred thousand pounds! And who is the Judas who has concluded this\ninfamous bargain?\"\n\n\"Lord Leven.\"\n\n\"Are you certain of it, sir?\"\n\n\"I heard it with my own ears.\"\n\nThe king sighed deeply, as if his heart would break, and then buried his\nface in his hands.\n\n\"Oh! the Scotch,\" he exclaimed, \"the Scotch I called 'my faithful,' to\nwhom I trusted myself when I could have fled to Oxford! the Scotch, my\nbrothers! But are you well assured, sir?\"\n\n\"Lying behind the tent of Lord Leven, I raised it and saw all, heard\nall!\"\n\n\"And when is this to be consummated?\"\n\n\"To-day--this morning; so your majesty must perceive there is no time to\nlose!\"\n\n\"To do what? since you say I am sold.\"\n\n\"To cross the Tyne, reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose, who will\nnot sell you.\"\n\n\"And what shall I do in Scotland? A war of partisans, unworthy of a\nking.\"\n\n\"The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you, sire.\"\n\n\"No, no! I have fought too long; they have sold me, they shall give me\nup, and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, \"perhaps a king should act thus, but not a husband\nand a father. I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and\nof the children you have still in London, and I say to you, 'Live,\nsire,'--it is the will of Heaven.\"\n\nThe king raised himself, buckled on his belt, and passing his\nhandkerchief over his moist forehead, said:\n\n\"Well, what is to be done?\"\n\n\"Sire, have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly\nrely?\"\n\n\"Winter,\" said the king, \"do you believe in the fidelity of yours?\"\n\n\"Sire, they are but men, and men are become both weak and wicked. I\nwill not answer for them. I would confide my life to them, but I should\nhesitate ere I trusted them with your majesty's.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Athos, \"since you have not a regiment, we are three\ndevoted men. It is enough. Let your majesty mount on horseback and place\nyourself in the midst of us; we will cross the Tyne, reach Scotland, and\nyou will be saved.\"\n\n\"Is this your counsel also, Winter?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And yours, Monsieur d'Herblay?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"As you wish, then. Winter, give the necessary orders.\"\n\nWinter then left the tent; in the meantime the king finished his toilet.\nThe first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter\nre-entered it.\n\n\"All is ready, sire,\" said he.\n\n\"For us, also?\" inquired Athos.\n\n\"Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses, ready saddled.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" exclaimed Athos, \"let us not lose an instant, but set\noff.\"\n\n\"Come,\" added the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Aramis, \"will not your majesty acquaint some of your\nfriends of this?\"\n\n\"Friends!\" answered Charles, sadly, \"I have but three--one of twenty\nyears, who has never forgotten me, and two of a week's standing, whom I\nshall never forget. Come, gentlemen, come!\"\n\nThe king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him. It\nwas a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he\nwas very fond.\n\nThe horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, \"I was unjust; here is a creature that loves me.\nYou at least will be faithful to me, Arthur.\"\n\nThe horse, as if it understood these words, bent its red nostrils toward\nthe king's face, and parting his lips displayed all its teeth, as if\nwith pleasure.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the king, caressing it with his hand, \"yes, my Arthur,\nthou art a fond and faithful creature.\"\n\nAfter this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle, and\nturning to Athos, Aramis and Winter, said:\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, I am at your service.\"\n\nBut Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which\nbordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of\nthe camp.\n\n\"What is that line?\" cried Athos, whose vision was still rather obscured\nby the uncertain shades and demi-tints of daybreak. \"What is that line?\nI did not observe it yesterday.\"\n\n\"It must be the fog rising from the river,\" said the king.\n\n\"Sire, it is something more opaque than the fog.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Winter, \"it appears to me like a bar of red color.\"\n\n\"It is the enemy, who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are\nsurrounding us!\" exclaimed Athos.\n\n\"The enemy!\" cried the king.\n\n\"Yes, the enemy. It is too late. Stop a moment; does not that sunbeam\nyonder, just by the side of the town, glitter on the Ironsides?\"\n\nThis was the name given the cuirassiers, whom Cromwell had made his\nbody-guard.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, \"we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have\nbetrayed me or not.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" exclaimed Athos.\n\n\"To give them the order to charge, and run down these miserable rebels.\"\n\nAnd the king, putting spurs to his horse, set off to the tent of Lord\nLeven.\n\n\"Follow him,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Come!\" exclaimed Aramis.\n\n\"Is the king wounded?\" cried Lord Winter. \"I see spots of blood on the\nground.\" And he set off to follow the two friends.\n\nHe was stopped by Athos.\n\n\"Go and call out your regiment,\" said he; \"I can foresee that we shall\nhave need of it directly.\"\n\nWinter turned his horse and the two friends rode on. It had taken but\ntwo minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander; he\ndismounted and entered.\n\nThe general was there, surrounded by the more prominent chiefs.\n\n\"The king!\" they exclaimed, as all rose in bewilderment.\n\nCharles was indeed in the midst of them, his hat on his head, his brows\nbent, striking his boot with his riding whip.\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, the king in person, the king who has come to ask for\nsome account of what has happened.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, sire?\" exclaimed Lord Leven.\n\n\"It is this, sir,\" said the king, angrily, \"that General Cromwell has\nreached Newcastle; that you knew it and I was not informed of it; that\nthe enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the\nTyne against us; that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have\nbeen left unacquainted with it; that, by an infamous treaty you have\nsold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament. Of this treaty,\nat least, I have been warned. This is the matter, gentlemen; answer and\nexculpate yourselves, for I stand here to accuse you.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Lord Leven, with hesitation, \"sire, your majesty has been\ndeceived by false reports.\"\n\n\"My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and\nScotland; and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the\nclauses of the treaty debated.\"\n\nThe Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning\nbrows.\n\n\"Sire,\" murmured Lord Leven, crushed by shame, \"sire, we are ready to\ngive you every proof of our fidelity.\"\n\n\"I ask but one,\" said the king; \"put the army in battle array and face\nthe enemy.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, sire,\" said the earl.\n\n\"How, cannot be? What hinders it?\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the\nEnglish army.\"\n\n\"And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the\ntown, contrary to the agreement which kept it there. Now, I tell you,\nyou must pass with me through this army across to Scotland, and if\nyou refuse you may choose betwixt two names, which the contempt of all\nhonest men will brand you with--you are either cowards or traitors!\"\n\nThe eyes of the Scotch flashed fire; and, as often happens on such\noccasions, from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans\nadvanced upon the king.\n\n\"Yes,\" said they, \"we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from\nhim who for the last five-and-twenty years has sucked the blood and gold\nof Scotland and England. We have promised and we will keep our promise.\nCharles Stuart, you are our prisoner.\"\n\nAnd both extended their hands as if to seize the king, but before they\ncould touch him with the tips of their fingers, both had fallen, one\ndead, the other stunned.\n\nAramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had\nknocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol.\n\nThen, as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this\nunexpected rescue, which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they\nalready thought was their prisoner, Athos and Aramis dragged the king\nfrom the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured,\nand throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop\nto the royal tent.\n\nOn their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his\nregiment. The king motioned him to accompany them.\n\n\n\n\n56. The Avenger.\n\n\n\nThey all four entered the tent; they had no plan ready--they must think\nof one.\n\nThe king threw himself into an arm-chair. \"I am lost,\" said he.\n\n\"No, sire,\" replied Athos. \"You are only betrayed.\"\n\nThe king sighed deeply.\n\n\"Betrayed! yes betrayed by the Scotch, amongst whom I was born, whom I\nhave always loved better than the English. Oh, traitors that ye are!\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, \"this is not a moment for recrimination, but a time\nto show yourself a king and a gentleman. Up, sire! up! for you have here\nat least three men who will not betray you. Ah! if we had been five!\"\nmurmured Athos, thinking of D'Artagnan and Porthos.\n\n\"What do you say?\" inquired Charles, rising.\n\n\"I say, sire, that there is now but one way open. Lord Winter answers\nfor his regiment, or at least very nearly so--we will not split straws\nabout words--let him place himself at the head of his men, we will place\nourselves at the side of your majesty, and we will mow a swath through\nCromwell's army and reach Scotland.\"\n\n\"There is another method,\" said Aramis. \"Let one of us put on the\ndress and mount the king's horse. Whilst they pursue him the king might\nescape.\"\n\n\"It is good advice,\" said Athos, \"and if the king will do one of us the\nhonor we shall be truly grateful to him.\"\n\n\"What do you think of this counsel, Winter?\" asked the king, looking\nwith admiration at these two men, whose chief idea seemed to be how they\ncould take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him.\n\n\"I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed\nby Monsieur d'Herblay. I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly,\nfor we have not an instant to lose.\"\n\n\"But if I accept, it is death, or at least imprisonment, for him who\ntakes my place.\"\n\n\"He will have had the glory of having saved his king,\" cried Winter.\n\nThe king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes; undid the\nOrder of the Saint Esprit which he wore, to honor the two Frenchmen who\nwere with him, and passed it around Winter's neck, who received on his\nknees this striking proof of his sovereign's confidence and friendship.\n\n\"It is right,\" said Athos; \"he has served your majesty longer than we\nhave.\"\n\nThe king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Wait a moment, sir,\" said he; \"I have an order for each of you also.\"\n\nHe turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up, and took out\ntwo ribbons of the Order of the Garter.\n\n\"These cannot be for us,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Why not, sir?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"Such are for royalty, and we are simple commoners.\"\n\n\"Speak not of crowns. I shall not find amongst them such great hearts\nas yours. No, no, you do yourselves injustice; but I am here to do you\njustice. On your knees, count.\"\n\nAthos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right\nas usual, raised his sword, and instead of pronouncing the customary\nformula, \"I make you a knight. Be brave, faithful and loyal,\" he said,\n\"You are brave, faithful and loyal. I knight you, monsieur le comte.\"\n\nThen turning to Aramis, he said:\n\n\"It is now your turn, monsieur le chevalier.\"\n\nThe same ceremony recommenced, with the same words, whilst Winter\nunlaced his leather cuirass, that he might disguise himself like the\nking. Charles, having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos, embraced them\nboth.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Winter, who in this trying emergency felt all his strength\nand energy fire up, \"we are ready.\"\n\nThe king looked at the three gentlemen. \"Then we must fly!\" said he.\n\n\"Flying through an army, sire,\" said Athos, \"in all countries in the\nworld is called charging.\"\n\n\"Then I shall die, sword in hand,\" said Charles. \"Monsieur le comte,\nmonsieur le chevalier, if ever I am king----\"\n\n\"Sire, you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could\never aspire to, therefore gratitude is on our side. But we must not lose\ntime. We have already wasted too much.\"\n\nThe king again shook hands with all three, exchanged hats with Winter\nand went out.\n\nWinter's regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp. The\nking, followed by the three friends, turned his steps that way. The\nScotch camp seemed as if at last awakened; the soldiers had come out of\ntheir tents and taken up their station in battle array.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" said the king. \"Perhaps they are penitent and\npreparing to march.\"\n\n\"If they are penitent,\" said Athos, \"let them follow us.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said the king, \"what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Let us examine the enemy's army.\"\n\nAt the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same\nline which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning\nsun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle. The air was soft\nand clear, as it generally is at that early hour of the morning. The\nregiments, the standards, and even the colors of the horses and uniforms\nwere now clearly distinct.\n\nOn the summit of a rising ground, a little in advance of the enemy,\nappeared a short and heavy looking man; this man was surrounded by\nofficers. He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the\nking stood.\n\n\"Does this man know your majesty personally?\" inquired Aramis.\n\nCharles smiled.\n\n\"That man is Cromwell,\" said he.\n\n\"Then draw down your hat, sire, that he may not discover the\nsubstitution.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Athos, \"how much time we have lost.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said the king, \"give the word and let us start.\"\n\n\"Will you not give it, sire?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"No; I make you my lieutenant-general,\" said the king.\n\n\"Listen, then, Lord Winter. Proceed, sire, I beg. What we are going to\nsay does not concern your majesty.\"\n\nThe king, smiling, turned a few steps back.\n\n\"This is what I propose to do,\" said Athos. \"We will divide our\nregiments into two squadrons. You will put yourself at the head of the\nfirst. We and his majesty will lead the second. If no obstacle occurs\nwe will both charge together, force the enemy's line and throw ourselves\ninto the Tyne, which we must cross, either by fording or swimming; if,\non the contrary, any repulse should take place, you and your men must\nfight to the last man, whilst we and the king proceed on our road. Once\narrived at the brink of the river, should we even find them three ranks\ndeep, as long as you and your regiment do your duty, we will look to the\nrest.\"\n\n\"To horse!\" said Lord Winter.\n\n\"To horse!\" re-echoed Athos; \"everything is arranged and decided.\"\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" cried the king, \"forward! and rally to the old cry of\nFrance, 'Montjoy and St. Denis!' The war cry of England is too often in\nthe mouths of traitors.\"\n\nThey mounted--the king on Winter's horse and Winter on that of the king;\nthen Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron, and the\nking, with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left, at the head of the\nsecond.\n\nThe Scotch army stood motionless and silent, seized with shame at sight\nof these preparations.\n\nSome of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two.\n\n\"There,\" said the king, \"that consoles me; they are not all traitors.\"\n\nAt this moment Winter's voice was raised with the cry of \"Forward!\"\n\nThe first squadron moved off; the second followed, and descended from\nthe plateau. A regiment of cuirassiers, nearly equal as to numbers,\nissued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it.\n\nThe king pointed this out.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Athos, \"we foresaw this; and if Lord Winter's men but do\ntheir duty, we are saved, instead of lost.\"\n\nAt this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the\nhorses Winter's voice crying out:\n\n\"Sword in hand!\"\n\nAt these words every sword was drawn, and glittered in the air like\nlightning.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said the king in his turn, excited by this sight,\n\"come, gentlemen, sword in hand!\"\n\nBut Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the\nking's example.\n\n\"We are betrayed,\" said the king in a low voice.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Athos, \"perhaps they do not recognize your\nmajesty's voice, and await the order of their captain.\"\n\n\"Have they not heard that of their colonel? But look! look!\" cried the\nking, drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk, which threw it on its\nhaunches, and seizing the bridle of Athos's horse.\n\n\"Ah, cowards! traitors!\" screamed Lord Winter, whose voice they heard,\nwhilst his men, quitting their ranks, dispersed all over the plain.\n\nAbout fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of\nCromwell's cuirassiers.\n\n\"Let us go and die with them!\" said the king.\n\n\"Let us go,\" said Athos and Aramis.\n\n\"All faithful hearts with me!\" cried out Winter.\n\nThis voice was heard by the two friends, who set off, full gallop.\n\n\"No quarter!\" cried a voice in French, answering to that of Winter,\nwhich made them tremble.\n\nAs for Winter, at the sound of that voice he turned pale, and was, as it\nwere, petrified.\n\nIt was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse,\nwho was charging at the head of the English regiment, of which, in his\nardor, he was ten steps in advance.\n\n\"'Tis he!\" murmured Winter, his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to\nfall to his side.\n\n\"The king! the king!\" cried out several voices, deceived by the blue\nribbon and chestnut horse of Winter; \"take him alive.\"\n\n\"No! it is not the king!\" exclaimed the cavalier. \"Lord Winter, you are\nnot the king; you are my uncle.\"\n\nAt the same moment Mordaunt, for it was he, leveled his pistol at\nWinter; it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier,\nwho with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos,\nmurmuring: \"He is avenged!\"\n\n\"Think of my mother!\" shouted Mordaunt, as his horse plunged and darted\noff at full gallop.\n\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed Aramis, raising his pistol as he passed by him; but\nthe powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off.\n\nAt this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few\nmen who had held out, surrounding the two Frenchmen. Athos, after making\nsure that Lord Winter was really dead, let fall the corpse and said:\n\n\"Come, Aramis, now for the honor of France!\" and the two Englishmen who\nwere nearest to them fell, mortally wounded.\n\nAt the same moment a fearful \"hurrah!\" rent the air and thirty blades\nglittered about their heads.\n\nSuddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks, fell upon Athos, twined\narms of steel around him, and tearing his sword from him, said in his\near:\n\n\"Silence! yield--you yield to me, do you not?\"\n\nA giant had seized also Aramis's two wrists, who struggled in vain to\nrelease himself from this formidable grasp.\n\n\"D'Art----\" exclaimed Athos, whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with\nhis hand.\n\n\"I am your prisoner,\" said Aramis, giving up his sword to Porthos.\n\n\"Fire, fire!\" cried Mordaunt, returning to the group surrounding the two\nfriends.\n\n\"And wherefore fire?\" said the colonel; \"every one has yielded.\"\n\n\"It is the son of Milady,\" said Athos to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I recognize him.\"\n\n\"It is the monk,\" whispered Porthos to Aramis.\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\nAnd now the ranks began to open. D'Artagnan held the bridle of Athos's\nhorse and Porthos that of Aramis. Both of them attempted to lead his\nprisoner off the battle-field.\n\nThis movement revealed the spot where Winter's body had fallen. Mordaunt\nhad found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression\nof malignant hatred.\n\nAthos, though now cool and collected, put his hand to his belt, where\nhis loaded pistols yet remained.\n\n\"What are you about?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Let me kill him.\"\n\n\"We are all four lost, if by the least gesture you discover that you\nrecognize him.\"\n\nThen turning to the young man he exclaimed:\n\n\"A fine prize! a fine prize, friend Mordaunt; we have both myself and\nMonsieur du Vallon, taken two Knights of the Garter, nothing less.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mordaunt, looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes,\n\"these are Frenchmen, I imagine.\"\n\n\"I'faith, I don't know. Are you French, sir?\" said he to Athos.\n\n\"I am,\" replied the latter, gravely.\n\n\"Very well, my dear sir, you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman.\"\n\n\"But the king--where is the king?\" exclaimed Athos, anxiously.\n\nD'Artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner's hand, saying:\n\n\"Eh! the king? We have secured him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"through an infamous act of treason.\"\n\nPorthos pressed his friend's hand and said to him:\n\n\"Yes, sir, all is fair in war, stratagem as well as force; look yonder!\"\n\nAt this instant the squadron, that ought to have protected Charles's\nretreat, was advancing to meet the English regiments. The king, who was\nentirely surrounded, walked alone in a great empty space. He appeared\ncalm, but it was evidently not without a mighty effort. Drops of\nperspiration trickled down his face, and from time to time he put a\nhandkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it.\n\n\"Behold Nebuchadnezzar!\" exclaimed an old Puritan soldier, whose eyes\nflashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant.\n\n\"Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar?\" said Mordaunt, with a terrible smile;\n\"no, it is Charles the First, the king, the good King Charles, who\ndespoils his subjects to enrich himself.\"\n\nCharles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this, but\ndid not recognize him. Nevertheless, the calm religious dignity of his\ncountenance abashed Mordaunt.\n\n\"Bon jour, messieurs!\" said the king to the two gentlemen who were held\nby D'Artagnan and Porthos. \"The day has been unfortunate, but it is not\nyour fault, thank God! But where is my old friend Winter?\"\n\nThe two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence.\n\n\"In Strafford's company,\" said Mordaunt, tauntingly.\n\nCharles shuddered. The demon had known how to wound him. The remembrance\nof Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him, the shadow that\nhaunted him by day and night. The king looked around him. He saw a\ncorpse at his feet. It was Winter's. He uttered not a word, nor shed\na tear, but a deadly pallor spread over his face; he knelt down on the\nground, raised Winter's head, and unfastening the Order of the Saint\nEsprit, placed it on his own breast.\n\n\"Lord Winter is killed, then?\" inquired D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes on\nthe corpse.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"by his own nephew.\"\n\n\"Come, he was the first of us to go; peace be to him! he was an honest\nman,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Charles Stuart,\" said the colonel of the English regiment, approaching\nthe king, who had just put on the insignia of royalty, \"do you yield\nyourself a prisoner?\"\n\n\"Colonel Tomlison,\" said Charles, \"kings cannot yield; the man alone\nsubmits to force.\"\n\n\"Your sword.\"\n\nThe king drew his sword and broke it on his knee.\n\nAt this moment a horse without a rider, covered with foam, his nostrils\nextended and eyes all fire, galloped up, and recognizing his master,\nstopped and neighed with pleasure; it was Arthur.\n\nThe king smiled, patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the\nsaddle.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said he, \"conduct me where you will.\"\n\nTurning back again, he said, \"I thought I saw Winter move; if he still\nlives, by all you hold most sacred, do not abandon him.\"\n\n\"Never fear, King Charles,\" said Mordaunt, \"the bullet pierced his\nheart.\"\n\n\"Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos,\" said\nD'Artagnan to Athos and Aramis, \"that you recognize this man, for Milady\nis not dead; her soul lives in the body of this demon.\"\n\nThe detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive; but\non the road an aide-de-camp, from Cromwell, sent orders that Colonel\nTomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle.\n\nAt the same time couriers started in every direction over England\nand Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver\nCromwell.\n\n\n\n\n57. Oliver Cromwell.\n\n\n\n\"Have you been to the general?\" said Mordaunt to D'Artagnan and Porthos;\n\"you know he sent for you after the action.\"\n\n\"We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety,\" replied\nD'Artagnan. \"Do you know, sir, these gentlemen are each of them worth\nfifteen hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"Oh, be assured,\" said Mordaunt, looking at them with an expression he\nvainly endeavoured to soften, \"my soldiers will guard them, and guard\nthem well, I promise you.\"\n\n\"I shall take better care of them myself,\" answered D'Artagnan;\n\"besides, all they require is a good room, with sentinels, or their\nsimple parole that they will not attempt escape. I will go and see about\nthat, and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the\ngeneral and receiving his commands for his eminence.\"\n\n\"You think of starting at once, then?\" inquired Mordaunt.\n\n\"Our mission is ended, and there is nothing more to detain us now but\nthe good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent.\"\n\nThe young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant:\n\n\"You will follow these men and not lose sight of them; when you have\ndiscovered where they lodge, come and await me at the town gate.\"\n\nThe sergeant made a sign of comprehension.\n\nInstead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into\nthe town, Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence\nCromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent\npitched.\n\nCromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission; but\nthe sentinel, who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential\nfriends of the general, thought the order did not extend to the young\nman. Mordaunt, therefore, raised the canvas, and saw Cromwell seated\nbefore a table, his head buried in his hands, his back being turned.\n\nWhether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered, Cromwell did not move.\nMordaunt remained standing near the door. At last, after a few moments,\nCromwell raised his head, and, as if he divined that some one was there,\nturned slowly around.\n\n\"I said I wished to be alone,\" he exclaimed, on seeing the young man.\n\n\"They thought this order did not concern me, sir; nevertheless, if you\nwish it, I am ready to go.\"\n\n\"Ah! is it you, Mordaunt?\" said Cromwell, the cloud passing away from\nhis face; \"since you are here, it is well; you may remain.\"\n\n\"I come to congratulate you.\"\n\n\"To congratulate me--what for?\"\n\n\"On the capture of Charles Stuart. You are now master of England.\"\n\n\"I was much more really so two hours ago.\"\n\n\"How so, general?\"\n\n\"Because England had need of me to take the tyrant, and now the tyrant\nis taken. Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"What is his bearing?\"\n\nMordaunt hesitated; but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell\nthe truth.\n\n\"Calm and dignified,\" said he.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Some parting words to his friends.\"\n\n\"His friends!\" murmured Cromwell. \"Has he any friends?\" Then he added\naloud, \"Did he make any resistance?\"\n\n\"No, sir, with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted\nhim; he had no means of resistance.\"\n\n\"To whom did he give up his sword?\"\n\n\"He did not give it up; he broke it.\"\n\n\"He did well; but instead of breaking it, he might have used it to still\nmore advantage.\"\n\nThere was a momentary pause.\n\n\"I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was\nkilled,\" said Cromwell, staring very fixedly at Mordaunt.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"By whom?\" inquired Cromwell.\n\n\"By me.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Lord Winter.\"\n\n\"Your uncle?\" exclaimed Cromwell.\n\n\"My uncle,\" answered Mordaunt; \"but traitors to England are no longer\nmembers of my family.\"\n\nCromwell observed the young man a moment in silence, then, with that\nprofound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well:\n\n\"Mordaunt,\" he said, \"you are a terrible servant.\"\n\n\"When the Lord commands,\" said Mordaunt, \"His commands are not to be\ndisputed. Abraham raised the knife against Isaac, and Isaac was his\nson.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cromwell, \"but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be\naccomplished.\"\n\n\"I have looked around me,\" said Mordaunt, \"and I have seen neither goat\nnor kid caught among the bushes of the plain.\"\n\nCromwell bowed. \"You are strong among the strong, Mordaunt,\" he said;\n\"and the Frenchmen, how did they behave?\"\n\n\"Most fearlessly.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured Cromwell; \"the French fight well; and if my glass\nwas good and I mistake not, they were foremost in the fight.\"\n\n\"They were,\" replied Mordaunt.\n\n\"After you, however,\" said Cromwell.\n\n\"It was the fault of their horses, not theirs.\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"And the Scotch?\"\n\n\"They kept their word and never stirred,\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"Wretched men!\"\n\n\"Their officers wish to see you, sir.\"\n\n\"I have no time to see them. Are they paid?\"\n\n\"Yes, to-night.\"\n\n\"Let them be off and return to their own country, there to hide their\nshame, if its hills are high enough; I have nothing more to do with them\nnor they with me. And now go, Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Before I go,\" said Mordaunt, \"I have some questions and a favor to ask\nyou, sir.\"\n\n\"A favor from me?\"\n\nMordaunt bowed.\n\n\"I come to you, my leader, my head, my father, and I ask you, master,\nare you contented with me?\"\n\nCromwell looked at him with astonishment. The young man remained\nimmovable.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cromwell; \"you have done, since I knew you, not only your\nduty, but more than your duty; you have been a faithful friend, a\ncautious negotiator, a brave soldier.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, sir it was my idea, the Scotch treaty, for giving up\nthe king?\"\n\n\"Yes, the idea was yours. I had no such contempt for men before.\"\n\n\"Was I not a good ambassador in France?\"\n\n\"Yes, for Mazarin has granted what I desire.\"\n\n\"Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?\"\n\n\"Too ardently, perhaps; it is what I have just reproached you for. But\nwhat is the meaning of all these questions?\"\n\n\"To tell you, my lord, that the moment has now arrived when, with a\nsingle word, you may recompense all these services.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Oliver, with a slight curl of his lip, \"I forgot that every\nservice merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been\npaid.\"\n\n\"Sir, I can take my pay at this moment, to the full extent of my\nwishes.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"I have the payment under my hand; I almost possess it.\"\n\n\"What is it? Have they offered you money? Do you wish a step, or some\nplace in the government?\"\n\n\"Sir, will you grant me my request?\"\n\n\"Let us hear what it is, first.\"\n\n\"Sir, when you have told me to obey an order did I ever answer, 'Let me\nsee that order '?\"\n\n\"If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?\"\n\n\"When you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its\nfulfillment, have I ever replied, 'It is impossible'?\"\n\n\"But a request preferred with so much preparation----\"\n\n\"Ah, do not fear, sir,\" said Mordaunt, with apparent simplicity: \"it\nwill not ruin you.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Cromwell, \"I promise, as far as lies in my power, to\ngrant your request; proceed.\"\n\n\"Sir, two prisoners were taken this morning, will you let me have them?\"\n\n\"For their ransom? have they then offered a large one?\" inquired\nCromwell.\n\n\"On the contrary, I think they are poor, sir.\"\n\n\"They are friends of yours, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" exclaimed Mordaunt, \"they are friends, dear friends of mine,\nand I would lay down my life for them.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mordaunt,\" exclaimed Cromwell, pleased at having his opinion\nof the young man raised once more; \"I will give them to you; I will not\neven ask who they are; do as you like with them.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" exclaimed Mordaunt, \"thank you; my life is always at\nyour service, and should I lose it I should still owe you something;\nthank you; you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services.\"\n\nHe threw himself at the feet of Cromwell, and in spite of the efforts of\nthe Puritan general, who did not like this almost kingly homage, he took\nhis hand and kissed it.\n\n\"What!\" said Cromwell, arresting him for a moment as he arose; \"is there\nnothing more you wish? neither gold nor rank?\"\n\n\"You have given me all you can give me, and from to-day your debt is\npaid.\"\n\nAnd Mordaunt darted out of the general's tent, his heart beating and his\neyes sparkling with joy.\n\nCromwell gazed a moment after him.\n\n\"He has slain his uncle!\" he murmured. \"Alas! what are my servants?\nPossibly this one, who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing, has asked\nmore in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal\nthe bread of the poor. Nobody serves me for nothing. Charles, who is my\nprisoner, may still have friends, but I have none!\"\n\nAnd with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been\ninterrupted by Mordaunt.\n\n\n\n\n58. Jesus Seigneur.\n\n\n\nWhilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwell's tent, D'Artagnan and\nPorthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned\nto them as their dwelling at Newcastle.\n\nThe order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by\nD'Artagnan, who accordingly, by an expressive glance, warned Athos\nand Aramis to exercise extreme caution. The prisoners, therefore,\nhad remained silent as they marched along in company with their\nconquerors--which they could do with the less difficulty since each of\nthem had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts.\n\nIt would be impossible to describe Mousqueton's astonishment when from\nthe threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching, followed\nby a sergeant with a dozen men. He rubbed his eyes, doubting if he\nreally saw before him Athos and Aramis; and forced at last to yield to\nevidence, he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he\nencountered a glance from the eyes of Porthos, the repressive force of\nwhich he was not inclined to dispute.\n\nMousqueton remained glued to the door, awaiting the explanation of this\nstrange occurrence. What upset him completely was that the four friends\nseemed to have no acquaintance with one another.\n\nThe house to which D'Artagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was\nthe one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken\npossession on the previous evening. It was at the corner of two streets\nand had in the rear, bordering on the side street, stables and a sort\nof garden. The windows on the ground floor, according to a custom in\nprovincial villages, were barred, so that they strongly resembled the\nwindows of a prison.\n\nThe two friends made the prisoners enter the house first, whilst they\nstood at the door, desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the\nstable.\n\n\"Why don't we go in with them?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do,\" replied\nD'Artagnan.\n\nThe sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden.\n\nD'Artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that\nposition.\n\n\"We have had orders,\" answered the man, \"to help you in taking care of\nyour prisoners.\"\n\nThere could be no fault to find with this arrangement; on the contrary,\nit seemed to be a delicate attention, to be gratefully received;\nD'Artagnan, therefore, thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to\ndrink to General Cromwell's health.\n\nThe sergeant answered that Puritans never drank, and put the crown piece\nin his pocket.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, \"what a fearful day, my dear D'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"What! a fearful day, when to-day we find our friends?\"\n\n\"Yes; but under what circumstances?\"\n\n\"'Tis true that our position is an awkward one; but let us go in and see\nmore clearly what is to be done.\"\n\n\"Things look black enough,\" replied Porthos; \"I understand now why\nAramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" cried the Gascon; \"do not utter that name.\"\n\n\"But,\" argued Porthos, \"I speak French and they are all English.\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man\ncannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity.\n\nBut as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment, he\nmerely pushed him indoors, saying, \"Let us go in.\"\n\nThey found Athos in profound despondency; Aramis looked first at Porthos\nand then at D'Artagnan, without speaking, but the latter understood his\nmeaningful look.\n\n\"You want to know how we came here? 'Tis easily guessed. Mazarin sent us\nwith a letter to General Cromwell.\"\n\n\"But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt, whom I bade you\ndistrust?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"And whom I advised you to strangle, Porthos,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Mazarin again. Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin. Mazarin sent us to\nCromwell. There is a certain fatality in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right, D'Artagnan, a fatality that will separate and\nruin us! So, my dear Aramis, say no more about it and let us prepare to\nsubmit to destiny.\"\n\n\"Zounds! on the contrary, let us speak about it; for it was agreed among\nus, once for all, that we should always hold together, though engaged on\nopposing sides.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Athos, \"I now ask you, D'Artagnan, what side you are on?\nAh! behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you. Do you\nknow in what crime you are to-day engaged? In the capture of a king, his\ndegradation and his murder.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" cried Porthos, \"do you think so?\"\n\n\"You are exaggerating, Athos; we are not so far gone as that,\" replied\nthe lieutenant.\n\n\"Good heavens! we are on the very eve of it. I say, why is the king\ntaken prisoner? Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy\nhim as a slave. Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that\nCromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling? They\nwill kill him, you may be sure of it.\"\n\n\"I don't maintain the contrary,\" said D'Artagnan. \"But what's that to\nus? I am here because I am a soldier and have to obey orders--I have\ntaken an oath to obey, and I do obey; but you who have taken no such\noath, why are you here and what cause do you represent?\"\n\n\"That most sacred in the world,\" said Athos; \"the cause of misfortune,\nof religion, royalty. A friend, a wife, a daughter, have done us the\nhonor to call us to their aid. We have served them to the best of our\npoor means, and God will recompense the will, forgive the want of power.\nYou may see matters differently, D'Artagnan, and think otherwise. I will\nnot attempt to argue with you, but I blame you.\"\n\n\"Heyday!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"what matters it to me, after all, if\nCromwell, who's an Englishman, revolts against his king, who is a\nScotchman? I am myself a Frenchman. I have nothing to do with these\nthings--why hold me responsible?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Because all gentlemen are brothers, because you are a gentleman,\nbecause the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen,\nbecause the blind populace, ungrateful and brutal, always takes pleasure\nin pulling down what is above them. And you, you, D'Artagnan, a man\nsprung from the ancient nobility of France, bearing an honorable name,\ncarrying a good sword, have helped to give up a king to beersellers,\nshopkeepers, and wagoners. Ah! D'Artagnan! perhaps you have done\nyour duty as a soldier, but as a gentleman, I say that you are very\nculpable.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower, unable to reply and\nthoroughly uncomfortable; for when turned from the eyes of Athos he\nencountered those of Aramis.\n\n\"And you, Porthos,\" continued the count, as if in consideration for\nD'Artagnan's embarrassment, \"you, the best heart, the best friend, the\nbest soldier that I know--you, with a soul that makes you worthy of a\nbirth on the steps of a throne, and who, sooner or later, must receive\nyour reward from an intelligent king--you, my dear Porthos, you, a\ngentleman in manners, in tastes and in courage, you are as culpable as\nD'Artagnan.\"\n\nPorthos blushed, but with pleasure rather than with confusion; and yet,\nbowing his head, as if humiliated, he said:\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear count, I feel that you are right.\"\n\nAthos arose.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, stretching out his hand to D'Artagnan, \"come, don't\nbe sullen, my dear son, for I have said all this to you, if not in the\ntone, at least with the feelings of a father. It would have been easier\nto me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have\nuttered a word of all this.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, doubtless, Athos. But here it is: you have sentiments, the\ndevil knows what, such as every one can't entertain. Who could suppose\nthat a sensible man could leave his house, France, his ward--a charming\nyouth, for we saw him in the camp--to fly to the aid of a rotten,\nworm-eaten royalty, which is going to crumble one of these days like an\nold hovel. The sentiments you air are certainly fine, so fine that they\nare superhuman.\"\n\n\"However that may be, D'Artagnan,\" replied Athos, without falling into\nthe snare which his Gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to\nhis parental love, \"however that may be, you know in the bottom of\nyour heart that it is true; but I am wrong to dispute with my master.\nD'Artagnan, I am your prisoner--treat me as such.\"\n\n\"Ah! pardieu!\" said D'Artagnan, \"you know you will not be my prisoner\nvery long.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Aramis, \"they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of\nthe Philipghauts.\"\n\n\"And how were they treated?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Why,\" said Aramis, \"one-half were hanged and the other half were shot.\"\n\n\"Well, I,\" said D'Artagnan \"I answer that while there remains a drop of\nblood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot. Sang Diou! let\nthem come on! Besides--do you see that door, Athos?\"\n\n\"Yes; what then?\"\n\n\"Well, you can go out by that door whenever you please; for from this\nmoment you are free as the air.\"\n\n\"I recognize you there, my brave D'Artagnan,\" replied Athos; \"but you\nare no longer our masters. That door is guarded, D'Artagnan; you know\nthat.\"\n\n\"Very well, you will force it,\" said Porthos. \"There are only a dozen\nmen at the most.\"\n\n\"That would be nothing for us four; it is too much for us two. No,\ndivided as we now are, we must perish. See the fatal example: on the\nVendomois road, D'Artagnan, you so brave, and you, Porthos, so valiant\nand so strong--you were beaten; to-day Aramis and I are beaten in our\nturn. Now that never happened to us when we were four together. Let\nus die, then, as De Winter has died; as for me, I will fly only on\ncondition that we all fly together.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said D'Artagnan; \"we are under Mazarin's orders.\"\n\n\"I know it and I have nothing more to say; my arguments lead to nothing;\ndoubtless they are bad, since they have not determined minds so just as\nyours.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Aramis, \"had they taken effect it would be still better\nnot to compromise two excellent friends like D'Artagnan and Porthos. Be\nassured, gentlemen, we shall do you honor in our dying. As for myself,\nI shall be proud to face the bullets, or even the rope, in company with\nyou, Athos; for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to-day.\"\n\nD'Artagnan said nothing, but, after having gnawed the flower stalk, he\nbegan to bite his nails. At last:\n\n\"Do you imagine,\" he resumed, \"that they mean to kill you? And wherefore\nshould they do so? What interest have they in your death? Moreover, you\nare our prisoners.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" cried Aramis; \"knowest thou not, then, Mordaunt? I have but\nexchanged with him one look, yet that look convinced me that we were\ndoomed.\"\n\n\"The truth is, I'm very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised\nme,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Eh! I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\"Cap de Diou! if he troubles me too much I will crush him, the insect!\nDo not fly, then. It is useless; for I swear to you that you are as safe\nhere as you were twenty years, ago--you, Athos, in the Rue Ferou, and\nyou, Aramis, in the Rue de Vaugirard.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" cried Athos, extending his hand to one of the grated windows by\nwhich the room was lighted; \"you will soon know what to expect, for here\nhe is.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mordaunt.\"\n\nIn fact, looking at the place to which Athos pointed, D'Artagnan saw a\ncavalier coming toward the house at full gallop.\n\nIt was Mordaunt.\n\nD'Artagnan rushed out of the room.\n\nPorthos wanted to follow him.\n\n\"Stay,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and do not come till you hear me drum my\nfingers on the door.\"\n\nWhen Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw D'Artagnan on the\nthreshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there, with their\narms.\n\n\"Halloo!\" he cried, \"are the prisoners still there?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the sergeant, uncovering.\n\n\"'Tis well; order four men to conduct them to my lodging.\"\n\nFour men prepared to do so.\n\n\"What is it?\" said D'Artagnan, with that jeering manner which our\nreaders have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance.\n\"What is the matter, if you please?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"I have ordered the two prisoners we made this\nmorning to be conducted to my lodging.\"\n\n\"Wherefore, sir? Excuse curiosity, but I wish to be enlightened on the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Because these prisoners, sir, are at my disposal and I choose to\ndispose of them as I like.\"\n\n\"Allow me--allow me, sir,\" said D'Artagnan, \"to observe you are in\nerror. The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who\nonly saw them taken. You might have taken Lord Winter--who, 'tis said,\nwas your uncle--prisoner, but you preferred killing him; 'tis well; we,\nthat is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, could have killed our prisoners--we\npreferred taking them.\"\n\nMordaunt's very lips grew white with rage.\n\nD'Artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the\nguard's march upon the door. At the first beat Porthos rushed out and\nstood on the other side of the door.\n\nThis movement was observed by Mordaunt.\n\n\"Sir!\" he thus addressed D'Artagnan, \"your resistance is useless; these\nprisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron, Oliver\nCromwell.\"\n\nThese words struck D'Artagnan like a thunderbolt. The blood mounted\nto his temples, his eyes became dim; he saw from what fountainhead the\nferocious hopes of the young man arose, and he put his hand to the hilt\nof his sword.\n\nAs for Porthos, he looked inquiringly at D'Artagnan.\n\nThis look of Porthos's made the Gascon regret that he had summoned\nthe brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to\nrequire chiefly cunning.\n\n\"Violence,\" he said to himself, \"would spoil all; D'Artagnan, my friend,\nprove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger, but more\nsubtle than he is.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, making a low bow, \"why did you not begin by saying that,\nMonsieur Mordaunt? What! are you sent by General Oliver Cromwell, the\nmost illustrious captain of the age?\"\n\n\"I have this instant left him,\" replied Mordaunt, alighting, in order to\ngive his horse to a soldier to hold.\n\n\"Why did you not say so at once, my dear sir! all England is with\nCromwell; and since you ask for my prisoners, I bend, sir, to your\nwishes. They are yours; take them.\"\n\nMordaunt, delighted, advanced, Porthos looking at D'Artagnan with\nopen-mouthed astonishment. Then D'Artagnan trod on his foot and Porthos\nbegan to understand that this was merely acting.\n\nMordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and, with his hat in\nhand, prepared to pass by the two friends, motioning to the four men to\nfollow him.\n\n\"But, pardon,\" said D'Artagnan, with the most charming smile and putting\nhis hand on the young man's shoulder, \"if the illustrious General\nOliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour, he has, of\ncourse, made that act of donation in writing.\"\n\nMordaunt stopped short.\n\n\"He has given you some little writing for me--the least bit of paper\nwhich may show that you come in his name. Be pleased to give me\nthat scrap of paper so that I may justify, by a pretext at least, my\nabandoning my countrymen. Otherwise, you see, although I am sure that\nGeneral Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm, it would have a bad\nappearance.\"\n\nMordaunt recoiled; he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look\nat D'Artagnan, who responded by the most amiable expression that ever\ngraced a human countenance.\n\n\"When I tell you a thing, sir,\" said Mordaunt, \"you insult me by\ndoubting it.\"\n\n\"I!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"I doubt what you say! God keep me from it, my\ndear Monsieur Mordaunt! On the contrary, I take you to be a worthy and\naccomplished gentleman. And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to\nyou?\" continued D'Artagnan, with his frank expression.\n\n\"Speak out, sir,\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"Monsieur du Vallon, yonder, is rich and has forty thousand francs\nyearly, so he does not care about money. I do not speak for him, but for\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Well, sir? What more?\"\n\n\"Well--I--I'm not rich. In Gascony 'tis no dishonor, sir, nobody\nis rich; and Henry IV., of glorious memory, who was the king of the\nGascons, as His Majesty Philip IV. is the king of the Spaniards, never\nhad a penny in his pocket.\"\n\n\"Go on, sir, I see what you wish to get at; and if it is simply what I\nthink that stops you, I can obviate the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Ah, I knew well,\" said the Gascon, \"that you were a man of talent.\nWell, here's the case, here's where the saddle hurts me, as we French\nsay. I am an officer of fortune, nothing else; I have nothing but what\nmy sword brings me in--that is to say, more blows than banknotes. Now,\non taking prisoners, this morning, two Frenchmen, who seemed to me of\nhigh birth--in short, two knights of the Garter--I said to myself, my\nfortune is made. I say two, because in such circumstances, Monsieur du\nVallon, who is rich, always gives me his prisoners.\"\n\nMordaunt, completely deceived by the wordy civility of D'Artagnan,\nsmiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him, and\nsaid:\n\n\"I shall have the order signed directly, sir, and with it two thousand\npistoles; meanwhile, let me take these men away.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"what signifies a delay of half an hour? I am\na man of order, sir; let us do things in order.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Mordaunt, \"I could compel you; I command here.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" said D'Artagnan, \"I see that although we have had the honor\nof traveling in your company you do not know us. We are gentlemen; we\nare, both of us, able to kill you and your eight men--we two only. For\nHeaven's sake don't be obstinate, for when others are obstinate I am\nobstinate likewise, and then I become ferocious and headstrong, and\nthere's my friend, who is even more headstrong and ferocious than\nmyself. Besides, we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin, and at this\nmoment represent both the king and the cardinal, and are, therefore,\nas ambassadors, able to act with impunity, a thing that General Oliver\nCromwell, who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general, is\nquite the man to understand. Ask him then, for the written order. What\nwill that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt?\"\n\n\"Yes, the written order,\" said Porthos, who now began to comprehend what\nD'Artagnan was aiming at, \"we ask only for that.\"\n\nHowever inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence, he\nunderstood the reasons D'Artagnan had given him; besides, completely\nignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen, all\nhis uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the\nransom. He decided, therefore, not only to fetch the order, but the two\nthousand pistoles, at which he estimated the prisoners. He therefore\nmounted his horse and disappeared.\n\n\"Good!\" thought D'Artagnan; \"a quarter of an hour to go to the tent, a\nquarter of an hour to return; it is more than we need.\" Then turning,\nwithout the least change of countenance, to Porthos, he said, looking\nhim full in the face: \"Friend Porthos, listen to this; first, not\na syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard; it is\nunnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them.\"\n\n\"Very well; I understand.\"\n\n\"Go to the stable; you will find Mousqueton there; saddle your horses,\nput your pistols in your saddle-bags, take out the horses and lead them\nto the street below this, so that there will be nothing to do but mount\nthem; all the rest is my business.\"\n\nPorthos made no remark, but obeyed, with the sublime confidence he had\nin his friend.\n\n\"I go,\" he said, \"only, shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen\nare?\"\n\n\"No, it is not worth while.\"\n\n\"Well, do me the kindness to take my purse, which I left on the\nmantelpiece.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe then proceeded, with his usual calm gait, to the stable and went into\nthe very midst of the soldiery, who, foreigner as he was, could not help\nadmiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs.\n\nAt the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him.\n\nD'Artagnan, meantime, went into the house, whistling a tune which he had\nbegun before Porthos went away.\n\n\"My dear Athos, I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced.\nI am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter. As you say,\nMazarin is a knave. I have resolved to fly with you, not a word--be\nready. Your swords are in the corner; do not forget them, they are in\nmany circumstances very useful; there is Porthos's purse, too.\"\n\nHe put it into his pocket. The two friends were perfectly stupefied.\n\n\"Well, pray, is there anything to be so surprised at?\" he said. \"I was\nblind; Athos has made me see, that's all; come here.\"\n\nThe two friends went near him.\n\n\"Do you see that street? There are the horses. Go out by the door, turn\nto the right, jump into your saddles, all will be right; don't be uneasy\nat anything except mistaking the signal. That will be the signal when I\ncall out--Jesus Seigneur!\"\n\n\"But give us your word that you will come too, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos.\n\n\"I swear I will, by Heaven.\"\n\n\"'Tis settled,\" said Aramis; \"at the cry 'Jesus Seigneur' we go out,\nupset all that stands in our way, run to our horses, jump into our\nsaddles, spur them; is that all?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"See, Aramis, as I have told you, D'Artagnan is first amongst us all,\"\nsaid Athos.\n\n\"Very true,\" replied the Gascon, \"but I always run away from\ncompliments. Don't forget the signal: 'Jesus Seigneur!'\" and he went out\nas he came in, whistling the self-same air.\n\nThe soldiers were playing or sleeping; two of them were singing in a\ncorner, out of tune, the psalm: \"On the rivers of Babylon.\"\n\nD'Artagnan called the sergeant. \"My dear friend, General Cromwell has\nsent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me. Guard the prisoners well, I beg of\nyou.\"\n\nThe sergeant made a sign, as much as to say he did not understand\nFrench, and D'Artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and\ngestures. Then he went into the stable; he found the five horses\nsaddled, his own amongst the rest.\n\n\"Each of you take a horse by the bridle,\" he said to Porthos and\nMousqueton; \"turn to the left, so that Athos and Aramis may see you\nclearly from the window.\"\n\n\"They are coming, then?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\n\"You didn't forget my purse?\"\n\n\"No; be easy.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nPorthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to\ntheir post.\n\nThen D'Artagnan, being alone, struck a light and lighted a small bit of\ntinder, mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the\nsoldiers. There, caressing as he pretended, the animal with his hand,\nhe put this bit of burning tinder in his ear. It was necessary to be as\ngood a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme, for no sooner had the\nanimal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared\nand jumped as if he had been mad.\n\nThe soldiers, whom he was nearly trampling, ran away.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"stop--my horse has the staggers.\"\n\nIn an instant the horse's eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with\nfoam.\n\n\"Help!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"What! will you let me be killed? Jesus\nSeigneur!\"\n\nNo sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and\nAramis rushed out. The coast, owing to the Gascon's stratagem, was\nclear.\n\n\"The prisoners are escaping! the prisoners are escaping!\" cried the\nsergeant.\n\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried D'Artagnan, giving rein to his famous steed, who,\ndarting forth, overturned several men.\n\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried the soldiers, and ran for their arms.\n\nBut the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to\nthe nearest gate.\n\nIn the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois, who were\ncoming to find their masters. With one wave of his hand Athos made\nGrimaud, who followed the little troop, understand everything, and they\npassed on like a whirlwind, D'Artagnan still directing them from behind\nwith his voice.\n\nThey passed through the gate like apparitions, without the guards\nthinking of detaining them, and reached the open country.\n\nAll this time the soldiers were calling out, \"Stop! stop!\" and the\nsergeant, who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice, was\nalmost in a frenzy of despair. Whilst all this was going on, a cavalier\nin full gallop was seen approaching. It was Mordaunt with the order in\nhis hand.\n\n\"The prisoners!\" he exclaimed, jumping off his horse.\n\nThe sergeant had not the courage to reply; he showed him the open door,\nthe empty room. Mordaunt darted to the steps, understood all, uttered\na cry, as if his very heart was pierced, and fell fainting on the stone\nsteps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59. In which it is shown that under the most trying Circumstances noble\nNatures never lose their Courage, nor good Stomachs their Appetites.\n\n\n\nThe little troop, without looking behind them or exchanging a word, fled\nat a rapid gallop, fording a little stream, of which none of them knew\nthe name, and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be\nDurham. At last they came in sight of a small wood, and spurring their\nhorses afresh, rode in its direction.\n\nAs soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently\nthick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit\nthey drew up to hold a council together. The two grooms held the horses,\nthat they might take a little rest without being unsaddled, and Grimaud\nwas posted as sentinel.\n\n\"Come, first of all,\" said Athos to D'Artagnan, \"my friend, that I may\nshake hands with you--you, our rescuer--you, the true hero of us all.\"\n\n\"Athos is right--you have my adoration,\" said Aramis, in his turn\npressing his hand. \"To what are you not equal, with your superior\nintelligence, infallible eye, your arm of iron and your enterprising\nmind!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said the Gascon, \"that is all well, I accept for Porthos and\nmyself everything--thanks and compliments; we have plenty of time to\nspare.\"\n\nThe two friends, recalled by D'Artagnan to what was also due to Porthos,\npressed his hand in their turn.\n\n\"And now,\" said Athos, \"it is not our plan to run anywhere and like\nmadmen, but we must map up our campaign. What shall we do?\"\n\n\"What are we going to do, i'faith? It is not very difficult to say.\"\n\n\"Tell us, then, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"We are going to reach the nearest seaport, unite our little resources,\nhire a vessel and return to France. As for me I will give my last sou\nfor it. Life is the greatest treasure, and speaking candidly, ours hangs\nby a thread.\"\n\n\"What do you say to this, Du Vallon?\"\n\n\"I,\" said Porthos, \"I am entirely of D'Artagnan's opinion; this is a\n'beastly' country, this England.\"\n\n\"You are quite decided, then, to leave it?\" asked Athos of D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Egad! I don't see what is to keep me here.\"\n\nA glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.\n\n\"Go, then, my friends,\" said the former, sighing.\n\n\"How, go then?\" exclaimed D'Artagnan. \"Let us go, you mean?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" said Athos, \"you must leave us.\"\n\n\"Leave you!\" cried D'Artagnan, quite bewildered at this unexpected\nannouncement.\n\n\"Bah!\" said Porthos, \"why separate, since we are all together?\"\n\n\"Because you can and ought to return to France; your mission is\naccomplished, but ours is not.\"\n\n\"Your mission is not accomplished?\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, looking in\nastonishment at Athos.\n\n\"No, my friend,\" replied Athos, in his gentle but decided voice, \"we\ncame here to defend King Charles; we have but ill defended him--it\nremains for us to save him!\"\n\n\"To save the king?\" said D'Artagnan, looking at Aramis as he had looked\nat Athos.\n\nAramis contented himself by making a sign with his head.\n\nD'Artagnan's countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion;\nhe began to think he had to do with madmen.\n\n\"You cannot be speaking seriously, Athos!\" said he; \"the king is\nsurrounded by an army, which is conducting him to London. This army\nis commanded by a butcher, or the son of a butcher--it matters\nlittle--Colonel Harrison. His majesty, I can assure you, will be tried\non his arrival in London; I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver\nCromwell to know what to expect.\"\n\nA second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.\n\n\"And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the\nsentence into execution,\" continued D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?\" asked\nAthos.\n\n\"The penalty of death, I greatly fear; they have gone too far for him to\npardon them, and there is nothing left to them but one thing, and that\nis to kill him. Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he\ncame to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de\nVendome was imprisoned?\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"'Princes must be knocked on the head.'\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" said Athos.\n\n\"And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution, now that he has\ngot hold of the king?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am certain he will do so. But then that is all the\nmore reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened.\"\n\n\"Athos, you are becoming mad.\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" Athos gently replied, \"but De Winter sought us out\nin France and introduced us, Monsieur d'Herblay and myself, to Madame\nHenrietta. Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband.\nWe engaged our word; our word included everything. It was our strength,\nour intelligence, our life, in short, that we promised. It remains now\nfor us to keep our word. Is that your opinion, D'Herblay?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"we have promised.\"\n\n\"Then,\" continued Athos, \"we have another reason; it is this--listen: In\nFrance at this moment everything is poor and paltry. We have a king ten\nyears old, who doesn't yet know what he wants; we have a queen blinded\nby a belated passion; we have a minister who governs France as he would\ngovern a great farm--that is to say, intent only on turning out all the\ngold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention; we have\nprinces who set up a personal and egotistic opposition, who will draw\nfrom Mazarin's hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power\ngranted as bribes. I have served them without enthusiasm--God knows that\nI estimated them at their real value, and that they are not high in my\nesteem--but on principle. To-day I am engaged in a different affair.\nI have encountered misfortune in a high place, a royal misfortune, a\nEuropean misfortune; I attach myself to it. If we can succeed in saving\nthe king it will be good; if we die for him it will be grand.\"\n\n\"So you know beforehand you must perish!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"We fear so, and our only regret is to die so far from both of you.\"\n\n\"What will you do in a foreign land, an enemy's country?\"\n\n\"I traveled in England when I was young, I speak English like an\nEnglishman, and Aramis, too, knows something of the language. Ah! if we\nhad you, my friends! With you, D'Artagnan, with you, Porthos--all four\nreunited for the first time for twenty years--we would dare not only\nEngland, but the three kingdoms put together!\"\n\n\"And did you promise the queen,\" resumed D'Artagnan, petulantly, \"to\nstorm the Tower of London, to kill a hundred thousand soldiers, to fight\nvictoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man,\nand when that man is Cromwell? Do not exaggerate your duty. In Heaven's\nname, my dear Athos, do not make a useless sacrifice. When I see you\nmerely, you look like a reasonable being; when you speak, I seem to have\nto do with a madman. Come, Porthos, join me; say frankly, what do you\nthink of this business?\"\n\n\"Nothing good,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Come,\" continued D'Artagnan, who, irritated that instead of listening\nto him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts, \"you have never\nfound yourself the worse for my advice. Well, then, believe me, Athos,\nyour mission is ended, and ended nobly; return to France with us.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said Athos, \"our resolution is irrevocable.\"\n\n\"Then you have some other motive unknown to us?\"\n\nAthos smiled and D'Artagnan struck his hand together in anger and\nmuttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover; but to all\nthese reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm, sweet\nsmile and Aramis by nodding his head.\n\n\"Very well,\" cried D'Artagnan, at last, furious, \"very well, since\nyou wish it, let us leave our bones in this beggarly land, where it\nis always cold, where fine weather is a fog, fog is rain, and rain a\ndeluge; where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese;\nin truth, whether we die here or elsewhere matters little, since we must\ndie.\"\n\n\"Only reflect, my good fellow,\" said Athos, \"it is but dying rather\nsooner.\"\n\n\"Pooh! a little sooner or a little later, it isn't worth quarreling\nover.\"\n\n\"If I am astonished at anything,\" remarked Porthos, sententiously, \"it\nis that it has not already happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will happen, you may be sure,\" said D'Artagnan. \"So it is\nagreed, and if Porthos makes no objection----\"\n\n\"I,\" said Porthos, \"I will do whatever you please; and besides, I think\nwhat the Comte de la Fere said just now is very good.\"\n\n\"But your future career, D'Artagnan--your ambition, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Our future, our ambition!\" replied D'Artagnan, with feverish\nvolubility. \"Need we think of that since we are to save the king? The\nking saved--we shall assemble our friends together--we will head\nthe Puritans--reconquer England; we shall re-enter London--place him\nsecurely on his throne----\"\n\n\"And he will make us dukes and peers,\" said Porthos, whose eyes sparkled\nwith joy at this imaginary prospect.\n\n\"Or he will forget us,\" added D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Well, that has happened, friend Porthos. It seems to me that we once\nrendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which to-day\nwe are trying to perform for Charles I.; but, none the less, Anne of\nAustria has forgotten us for twenty years.\"\n\n\"Well, in spite of that, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, \"you are not sorry\nthat you were useful to her?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I admit even that in my darkest moments\nI find consolation in that remembrance.\"\n\n\"You see, then, D'Artagnan, though princes often are ungrateful, God\nnever is.\"\n\n\"Athos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I believe that were you to fall in with the\ndevil, you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with\nyou to Heaven.\"\n\n\"So, then?\" said Athos, offering his hand to D'Artagnan.\n\n\"'Tis settled,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"I find England a charming country,\nand I stay--but on one condition only.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I am not forced to learn English.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Athos, triumphantly, \"I swear to you, my friend, by\nthe God who hears us--I believe that there is a power watching over us,\nand that we shall all four see France again.\"\n\n\"So be it!\" said D'Artagnan, \"but I--I confess I have a contrary\nconviction.\"\n\n\"Our good D'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, \"represents among us the opposition\nin parliament, which always says no, and always does aye.\"\n\n\"But in the meantime saves the country,\" added Athos.\n\n\"Well, now that everything is decided,\" cried Porthos, rubbing his\nhands, \"suppose we think of dinner! It seems to me that in the most\ncritical positions of our lives we have always dined.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled\nmutton, and as a treat drink beer. What the devil did you come to such a\ncountry for, Athos? But I forgot,\" added the Gascon, smiling, \"pardon,\nI forgot you are no longer Athos; but never mind, let us hear your plan\nfor dinner, Porthos.\"\n\n\"My plan!\"\n\n\"Yes, have you a plan?\"\n\n\"No! I am hungry, that is all.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, if that is all, I am hungry, too; but it is not everything\nto be hungry, one must find something to eat, unless we browse on the\ngrass, like our horses----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Aramis, who was not quite so indifferent to the\ngood things of the earth as Athos, \"do you remember, when we were at\nParpaillot, the beautiful oysters that we ate?\"\n\n\"And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes,\" said Porthos, smacking his\nlips.\n\n\"But,\" suggested D'Artagnan, \"have we not our friend Mousqueton, who\nmanaged for us so well at Chantilly, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"we have Mousqueton, but since he has been steward,\nhe has become very heavy; never mind, let us call him, and to make sure\nthat he will reply agreeably----\n\n\"Here! Mouston,\" cried Porthos.\n\nMouston appeared, with a most piteous face.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear M. Mouston?\" asked D'Artagnan. \"Are you\nill?\"\n\n\"Sir, I am very hungry,\" replied Mouston.\n\n\"Well, it is just for that reason that we have called you, my good M.\nMouston. Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits,\nand some of those delicious partridges, of which you used to make\nfricassees at the hotel----? 'Faith, I do not remember the name of the\nhotel.\"\n\n\"At the hotel of----,\" said Porthos; \"by my faith--nor do I remember it\neither.\"\n\n\"It does not matter; and a few of those bottles of old Burgundy wine,\nwhich cured your master so quickly of his sprain!\"\n\n\"Alas! sir,\" said Mousqueton, \"I much fear that what you ask for are\nvery rare things in this detestable and barren country, and I think we\nshould do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little\nhouse we see on the fringe of the forest.\"\n\n\"How! is there a house in the neighborhood?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Mousqueton.\n\n\"Well, let us, as you say, go and ask a dinner from the master of\nthat house. What is your opinion, gentlemen, and does not M. Mouston's\nsuggestion appear to you full of sense?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Aramis, \"suppose the master is a Puritan?\"\n\n\"So much the better, mordioux!\" replied D'Artagnan; \"if he is a Puritan\nwe will inform him of the capture of the king, and in honor of the news\nhe will kill for us his fatted hens.\"\n\n\"But if he should be a cavalier?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us\nhis black fowls.\"\n\n\"You are very happy,\" exclaimed Athos, laughing, in spite of himself,\nat the sally of the irresistible Gascon; \"for you see the bright side of\neverything.\"\n\n\"What would you have?\" said D'Artagnan. \"I come from a land where there\nis not a cloud in the sky.\"\n\n\"It is not like this, then,\" said Porthos stretching out his hand to\nassure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not\nreally caused by a drop of rain.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said D'Artagnan, \"more reason why we should start on our\njourney. Halloo, Grimaud!\"\n\nGrimaud appeared.\n\n\"Well, Grimaud, my friend, have you seen anything?\" asked the Gascon.\n\n\"Nothing!\" replied Grimaud.\n\n\"Those idiots!\" cried Porthos, \"they have not even pursued us. Oh! if we\nhad been in their place!\"\n\n\"Yes, they are wrong,\" said D'Artagnan. \"I would willingly have said\ntwo words to Mordaunt in this little desert. It is an excellent spot for\nbringing down a man in proper style.\"\n\n\"I think, decidedly,\" observed Aramis, \"gentlemen, that the son hasn't\nhis mother's energy.\"\n\n\"What, my good fellow!\" replied Athos, \"wait awhile; we have scarcely\nleft him two hours ago--he does not know yet in what direction we came\nnor where we are. We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we\nput foot in France, if we are not poisoned or killed before then.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, let us dine,\" suggested Porthos.\n\n\"I'faith, yes,\" said Athos, \"for I am hungry.\"\n\n\"Look out for the black fowls!\" cried Aramis.\n\nAnd the four friends, guided by Mousqueton, took up the way toward the\nhouse, already almost restored to their former gayety; for they were\nnow, as Athos had said, all four once more united and of single mind.\n\n\n\n\n60. Respect to Fallen Majesty.\n\n\n\nAs our fugitives approached the house, they found the ground cut up, as\nif a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them. Before the door\nthe traces were yet more apparent; these horsemen, whoever they might\nbe, had halted there.\n\n\"Egad!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"it's quite clear that the king and his escort\nhave been by here.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Porthos; \"in that case they have eaten everything.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"they will have left a chicken, at least.\" He\ndismounted and knocked on the door. There was no response.\n\nHe pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Porthos.\n\n\"I can see nobody,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Aha!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Blood!\"\n\nAt this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered.\nD'Artagnan had already opened the door of the second room, and from\nthe expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some\nextraordinary object.\n\nThe three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the\nground, bathed in a pool of blood. It was evident that he had attempted\nto regain his bed, but had not had sufficient strength to do so.\n\nAthos, who imagined that he saw him move, was the first to go up to him.\n\n\"Well?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Well, if he is dead,\" said Athos, \"he has not been so long, for he is\nstill warm. But no, his heart is beating. Ho, there, my friend!\"\n\nThe wounded man heaved a sigh. D'Artagnan took some water in the hollow\nof his hand and threw it upon his face. The man opened his eyes, made an\neffort to raise his head, and fell back again. The wound was in the top\nof his skull and blood was flawing copiously.\n\nAramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash. Again\nthe wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these\nstrangers, who appeared to pity him.\n\n\"You are among friends,\" said Athos, in English; \"so cheer up, and tell\nus, if you have the strength to do so, what has happened?\"\n\n\"The king,\" muttered the wounded man, \"the king is a prisoner.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\" asked Aramis, in the same language.\n\nThe man made no reply.\n\n\"Make your mind easy,\" resumed Athos, \"we are all faithful servants of\nhis majesty.\"\n\n\"Is what you tell me true?\" asked the wounded man.\n\n\"On our honor as gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Then I may tell you all. I am brother to Parry, his majesty's lackey.\"\n\nAthos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter\nhad called the man they had found in the passage of the king's tent.\n\n\"We know him,\" said Athos, \"he never left the king.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is he. Well, he thought of me, when he saw the king was\ntaken, and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king's\nname that they would stop, as the king was hungry. They brought him into\nthis room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows. Parry knew this\nroom, as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle. He\nknew that there was a trap-door communicating with a cellar, from which\none could get into the orchard. He made a sign, which I understood, but\nthe king's guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard. I\nwent out as if to fetch wood, passed through the subterranean passage\ninto the cellar, and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door, pushed up\nthe board and beckoned to the king to follow me. Alas! he would not. But\nParry clasped his hands and implored him, and at last he agreed. I went\non first, fortunately. The king was a few steps behind me, when suddenly\nI saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow. I wanted to\ncry out to warn the king, but that very moment I felt a blow as if the\nhouse was falling on my head, and fell insensible. When I came to myself\nagain, I was stretched in the same place. I dragged myself as far as the\nyard. The king and his escort were no longer there. I spent perhaps an\nhour in coming from the yard to this place; then my strength gave out\nand I fainted again.\"\n\n\"And now how are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Very ill,\" replied the wounded man.\n\n\"Can we do anything for you?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Help to put me on the bed; I think I shall feel better there.\"\n\n\"Have you any one to depend on for assistance?\"\n\n\"My wife is at Durham and may return at any moment. But you--is there\nnothing that you want?\"\n\n\"We came here with the intention of asking for something to eat.\"\n\n\"Alas, they have taken everything; there isn't a morsel of bread in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"You hear, D'Artagnan?\" said Athos; \"we shall have to look elsewhere for\nour dinner.\"\n\n\"It is all one to me now,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I am no longer hungry.\"\n\n\"Faith! neither am I,\" said Porthos.\n\nThey carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound.\nIn the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion\nto make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon.\n\nIn the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room, where they\ntook counsel together.\n\n\"Now,\" said Aramis, \"we know how the matter stands. The king and his\nescort have gone this way; we had better take the opposite direction,\neh?\"\n\nAthos did not reply; he reflected.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"let us take the opposite direction; if we follow\nthe escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger. What a\nconfounded country this England is! This is the first time I have gone\nwithout my dinner for ten years, and it is generally my best meal.\"\n\n\"What do you think, D'Artagnan?\" asked Athos. \"Do you agree with\nAramis?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said D'Artagnan; \"I am precisely of the contrary opinion.\"\n\n\"What! you would follow the escort?\" exclaimed Porthos, in dismay.\n\n\"No, I would join the escort.\"\n\nAthos's eyes shone with joy.\n\n\"Join the escort!\" cried Aramis.\n\n\"Let D'Artagnan speak,\" said Athos; \"you know he always has wise advice\nto give.\"\n\n\"Clearly,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we must go where they will not look for us.\nNow, they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans; therefore,\nwith the Puritans we must go.\"\n\n\"Good, my friend, good!\" said Athos. \"It is excellent advice. I was\nabout to give it when you anticipated me.\"\n\n\"That, then, is your opinion?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Yes. They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for\nus at the ports; meanwhile we shall reach London with the king. Once in\nLondon we shall be hard to find--without considering,\" continued Athos,\nthrowing a glance at Aramis, \"the chances that may come to us on the\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"I understand.\"\n\n\"I, however, do not understand,\" said Porthos. \"But no matter; since it\nis at the same time the opinion of D'Artagnan and of Athos, it must be\nthe best.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Aramis, \"shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison?\"\n\n\"Egad!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"he's just the man I count upon. Colonel\nHarrison is one of our friends. We have met him twice at General\nCromwell's. He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin;\nhe will consider us as brothers. Besides, is he not a butcher's son?\nWell, then, Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow\nof the fist, and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns.\nThat will insure his confidence.\"\n\nAthos smiled. \"You are the best companion that I know, D'Artagnan,\" he\nsaid, offering his hand to the Gascon; \"and I am very happy in having\nfound you again, my dear son.\"\n\nThis was, as we have seen, the term which Athos applied to D'Artagnan in\nhis more expansive moods.\n\nAt this moment Grimaud came in. He had stanched the wound and the man\nwas better.\n\nThe four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any\nmessage for him to his brother.\n\n\"Tell him,\" answered the brave man, \"to let the king know that they have\nnot killed me outright. However insignificant I am, I am sure that his\nmajesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" said D'Artagnan, \"he will know all before night.\"\n\nThe little troop recommenced their march, and at the end of two hours\nperceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead.\n\n\"My dear friends,\" said D'Artagnan, \"give your swords to Monsieur\nMouston, who will return them to you at the proper time and place, and\ndo not forget you are our prisoners.\"\n\nIt was not long before they joined the escort. The king was riding in\nfront, surrounded by troopers, and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow\nof pleasure lighted his pale cheeks.\n\nD'Artagnan passed to the head of the column, and leaving his friends\nunder the guard of Porthos, went straight to Harrison, who recognized\nhim as having met him at Cromwell's and received him as politely as a\nman of his breeding and disposition could. It turned out as D'Artagnan\nhad foreseen. The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion.\n\nThey halted for the king to dine. This time, however, due precautions\nwere taken to prevent any attempt at escape. In the large room of the\nhotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers.\n\n\"Will you dine with me?\" asked Harrison of D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Gad, I should be very happy, but I have my companion, Monsieur du\nVallon, and the two prisoners, whom I cannot leave. Let us manage it\nbetter. Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you\nlike from yours.\"\n\n\"Good,\" answered Harrison.\n\nThe matter was arranged as D'Artagnan had suggested, and when he\nreturned he found the king already seated at his little table, where\nParry waited on him, Harrison and his officers sitting together at\nanother table, and, in a corner, places reserved for himself and his\ncompanions.\n\nThe table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round, and\nwhether by chance or coarse intention, Harrison sat with his back to the\nking.\n\nThe king saw the four gentlemen come in, but appeared to take no notice\nof them.\n\nThey sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody. The\nofficers, table and that of the king were opposite to them.\n\n\"I'faith, colonel,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we are very grateful for your\ngracious invitation; for without you we ran the risk of going without\ndinner, as we have without breakfast. My friend here, Monsieur du\nVallon, shares my gratitude, for he was particularly hungry.\"\n\n\"And I am so still,\" said Porthos bowing to Harrison.\n\n\"And how,\" said Harrison, laughing, \"did this serious calamity of going\nwithout breakfast happen to you?\"\n\n\"In a very simple manner, colonel,\" said D'Artagnan. \"I was in a\nhurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by. You can\nunderstand our disappointment when, arriving at a pretty little house\non the skirts of a wood, which at a distance had quite a gay appearance,\nwith its red roof and green shutters, we found nothing but a poor wretch\nbathed--Ah! colonel, pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck\nthat blow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harrison, laughing, and looking over at one of the officers\nseated at his table. \"When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing there's\nno need to go over the ground a second time.\"\n\n\"Ah! it was this gentleman?\" said D'Artagnan, bowing to the officer.\n\"I am sorry he does not speak French, that I might tender him my\ncompliments.\"\n\n\"I am ready to receive and return them, sir,\" said the officer, in\npretty good French, \"for I resided three years in Paris.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed\nthat you have nearly killed your man.\"\n\n\"Nearly? I thought I had quite,\" said Groslow.\n\n\"No. It was a very near thing, but he is not dead.\"\n\nAs he said this, D'Artagnan gave a glance at Parry, who was standing in\nfront of the king, to show him that the news was meant for him.\n\nThe king, too, who had listened in the greatest agony, now breathed\nagain.\n\n\"Hang it,\" said Groslow, \"I thought I had succeeded better. If it were\nnot so far from here to the house I would return and finish him.\"\n\n\"And you would do well, if you are afraid of his recovering; for you\nknow, if a wound in the head does not kill at once, it is cured in a\nweek.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan threw a second glance toward Parry, on whose face such an\nexpression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to\nhim, smiling.\n\nParry bent over his master's hand and kissed it respectfully.\n\n\"I've a great desire to drink the king's health,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Let me propose it, then,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Do,\" said Aramis.\n\nPorthos looked at D'Artagnan, quite amazed at the resources with which\nhis companion's Gascon sharpness continually supplied him. D'Artagnan\ntook up his camp tin cup, filled it with wine and arose.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"let us drink to him who presides at the repast.\nHere's to our colonel, and let him know that we are always at his\ncommands as far as London and farther.\"\n\nAnd as D'Artagnan, as he spoke, looked at Harrison, the colonel imagined\nthe toast was for himself. He arose and bowed to the four friends, whose\neyes were fixed on Charles, while Harrison emptied his glass without the\nslightest misgiving.\n\nThe king, in return, looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile\nfull of nobility and gratitude.\n\n\"Come, gentlemen,\" cried Harrison, regardless of his illustrious\ncaptive, \"let us be off.\"\n\n\"Where do we sleep, colonel?\"\n\n\"At Thirsk,\" replied Harrison.\n\n\"Parry,\" said the king, rising too, \"my horse; I desire to go to\nThirsk.\"\n\n\"Egad!\" said D'Artagnan to Athos, \"your king has thoroughly taken me,\nand I am quite at his service.\"\n\n\"If what you say is sincere,\" replied Athos, \"he will never reach\nLondon.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because before then we shall have carried him off.\"\n\n\"Well, this time, Athos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"upon my word, you are mad.\"\n\n\"Have you some plan in your head then?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Ay!\" said Porthos, \"the thing would not be impossible with a good\nplan.\"\n\n\"I have none,\" said Athos; \"but D'Artagnan will discover one.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded.\n\n\n\n\n61. D'Artagnan hits on a Plan.\n\n\n\nAs night closed in they arrived at Thirsk. The four friends appeared to\nbe entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions\ntaken for guarding the king. They withdrew to a private house, and as\nthey had reason every moment to fear for their safety, they occupied\nbut one room and provided an exit, which might be useful in case of\nan attack. The lackeys were sent to their several posts, except that\nGrimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway.\n\nD'Artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his\nusual loquacity. Porthos, who could never see anything that was not\nself-evident, talked to him as usual. He replied in monosyllables and\nAthos and Aramis looked significantly at one another.\n\nNext morning D'Artagnan was the first to rise. He had been down to the\nstables, already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary\norders for the day, whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and\nPorthos snoring.\n\nAt eight o'clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night\nbefore, except that D'Artagnan left his friends and began to renew the\nacquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow.\n\nGroslow, whom D'Artagnan's praises had greatly pleased, welcomed him\nwith a gracious smile.\n\n\"Really, sir,\" D'Artagnan said to him, \"I am pleased to find one with\nwhom to talk in my own poor tongue. My friend, Monsieur du Vallon, is\nof a very melancholy disposition, so much so, that one can scarcely\nget three words out of him all day. As for our two prisoners, you can\nimagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation.\"\n\n\"They are hot royalists,\" said Groslow.\n\n\"The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the\nStuart, for whom, I hope, you're preparing a pretty trial.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Groslow, \"that is just what we are taking him to London\nfor.\"\n\n\"And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?\"\n\n\"I should think not, indeed. You see he has a truly royal escort.\"\n\n\"Ay, there's no fear in the daytime; but at night?\"\n\n\"We redouble our precautions.\"\n\n\"And what method of surveillance do you employ?\"\n\n\"Eight men remain constantly in his room.\"\n\n\"The deuce, he is well guarded, then. But besides these eight men, you\ndoubtless place some guard outside?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Just think. What would you have two men without arms do against\neight armed men?\"\n\n\"Two men--how do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, the king and his lackey.\"\n\n\"Oh! then they allow the lackey to remain with him?\"\n\n\"Yes; Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented. Under pretense\nthat he's a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Really, captain,\" said D'Artagnan, determined to continue on the\nlaudatory tack on which he had commenced, \"the more I listen to you the\nmore surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak\nFrench. You have lived three years in Paris? May I ask what you were\ndoing there?\"\n\n\"My father, who is a merchant, placed me with his correspondent, who in\nturn sent his son to join our house in London.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased with Paris, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you are much in want of a revolution like our own--not against\nyour king, who is a mere child, but against that lazar of an Italian,\nthe queen's favorite.\"\n\n\"Ah! I am quite of your opinion, sir, and we should soon make an end\nof Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself, without\nprejudices, vigilant and incorruptible.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the officer, \"I thought you were in his service and that it\nwas he who sent you to General Cromwell.\"\n\n\"That is to say I am in the king's service, and that knowing he wanted\nto send some one to England, I solicited the appointment, so great was\nmy desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms.\nSo that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old\nEngland you see how we snapped up the proposition.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"On his right and left, sir. Ah! there's another brave and excellent\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Yes, very well. Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with\nhim.\"\n\n\"It appears, too, you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne.\"\n\n\"What would you have? I was like you, and had a king in keeping.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said Groslow; \"what king?\"\n\n\"Our own, to be sure, the little one--Louis XIV.\"\n\n\"And how long had you to take care of him?\"\n\n\"Three nights; and, by my troth, I shall always remember those three\nnights with a certain pleasure.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that my friends, officers in the guards and mousquetaires,\ncame to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting, drinking,\ndicing.\"\n\n\"Ah true,\" said the Englishman, with a sigh; \"you Frenchmen are born\nboon companions.\"\n\n\"And don't you play, too, when you are on guard?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"In that case you must be horribly bored, and have my sympathy.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror. It's\ntiresome work to keep awake a whole night.\"\n\n\"Yes, but with a jovial partner and dice, and guineas clinking on the\ncloth, the night passes like a dream. You don't like playing, then?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I do.\"\n\n\"Lansquenet, for instance?\"\n\n\"Devoted to it. I used to play almost every night in France.\"\n\n\"And since your return to England?\"\n\n\"I have not handled a card or dice-box.\"\n\n\"I sincerely pity you,\" said D'Artagnan, with an air of profound\ncompassion.\n\n\"Look here,\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"To-morrow I am on guard.\"\n\n\"In Stuart's room?\"\n\n\"Yes; come and pass the night with me.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Impossible! why so?\"\n\n\"I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night. Sometimes we don't go to\nbed at all!\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\n\"Why, he would be annoyed if I did not play with him.\"\n\n\"Does he play well?\"\n\n\"I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles, laughing all the\nwhile till the tears rolled down.\"\n\n\"Bring him with you, then.\"\n\n\"But how about our prisoners?\"\n\n\"Let your servants guard them.\"\n\n\"Yes, and give them a chance of escaping,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Why, one\nof them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta,\nof noble family. We have arranged the ransom of each of them--2,000 on\narriving in France. We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men\nwhom our lackeys know to be millionaires. It is true we plundered them a\nlittle when we took them, and I will even confess that it is their purse\nthat Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play. Still, they\nmay have concealed some precious stone, some valuable diamond; so that\nwe are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their\ntreasures. We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men, and\nwhile I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Groslow.\n\n\"You see, then, why I must decline your polite invitation, which is\nespecially attractive to me, because nothing is so wearisome as to play\nnight after night with the same person; the chances always balance and\nat the month's end nothing is gained or lost.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Groslow, sighing; \"there is something still more wearisome,\nand that is not to play at all.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But, come,\" resumed the Englishman, \"are these men of yours dangerous?\"\n\n\"In what respect?\"\n\n\"Are they capable of attempting violence?\"\n\nD'Artagnan burst out laughing at the idea.\n\n\"Jesus Dieu!\" he cried; \"one of them is trembling with fever, having\nfailed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours, and the other\nis a knight of Malta, as timid as a young girl; and for greater security\nwe have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Groslow, \"bring them with you.\"\n\n\"But really----\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I have eight men on guard, you know. Four of them can guard the king\nand the other four your prisoners. I'll manage it somehow, you will\nsee.\"\n\n\"But,\" said D'Artagnan, \"now I think of it--what is to prevent our\nbeginning to-night?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" said Groslow.\n\n\"Just so. Come to us this evening and to-morrow we'll return your\nvisit.\"\n\n\"Capital! This evening with you, to-morrow at Stuart's, the next day\nwith me.\"\n\n\"You see, that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life\nanywhere and everywhere,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, with Frenchmen, and Frenchmen like you.\"\n\n\"And Monsieur du Vallon,\" added the other. \"You will see what a fellow\nhe is; a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two doors. They employ\nhim because they are afraid of him. Ah, there he is calling me now.\nYou'll excuse me, I know.\"\n\nThey exchanged bows and D'Artagnan returned to his companions.\n\n\"What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog?\" exclaimed\nPorthos.\n\n\"My dear fellow, don't speak like that of Monsieur Groslow. He's one of\nmy most intimate friends.\"\n\n\"One of your friends!\" cried Porthos, \"this butcher of unarmed farmers!\"\n\n\"Hush! my dear Porthos. Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty, it's\ntrue, but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in him--he is\nconceited and stupid.\"\n\nPorthos opened his eyes in amazement; Athos and Aramis looked at one\nanother and smiled; they knew D'Artagnan, and knew that he did nothing\nwithout a purpose.\n\n\"But,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"you shall judge of him for yourself. He is\ncoming to play with us this evening.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said Porthos, his eyes glistening at the news. \"Is he rich?\"\n\n\"He's the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London.\"\n\n\"And knows lansquenet?\"\n\n\"Adores it.\"\n\n\"Basset?\"\n\n\"His mania.\"\n\n\"Biribi?\"\n\n\"Revels in it.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Porthos; \"we shall pass an agreeable evening.\"\n\n\"The more so, as it will be the prelude to a better.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"We invite him to play to-night; he has invited us in return to-morrow.\nBut wait. To-night we stop at Derby; and if there is a bottle of wine\nin the town let Mousqueton buy it. It will be well to prepare a light\nsupper, of which you, Athos and Aramis, are not to partake--Athos,\nbecause I told him you had a fever; Aramis, because you are a knight of\nMalta and won't mix with fellows like us. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"That's no doubt very fine,\" said Porthos; \"but deuce take me if I\nunderstand at all.\"\n\n\"Porthos, my friend, you know I am descended on the father's side from\nthe Prophets and on the mother's from the Sybils, and that I only speak\nin parables and riddles. Let those who have ears hear and those who have\neyes see; I can tell you nothing more at present.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, my friend,\" said Athos; \"I am sure that whatever you do is\nwell done.\"\n\n\"And you, Aramis, are you of that opinion?\"\n\n\"Entirely so, my dear D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said D'Artagnan; \"here indeed are true believers; it is\na pleasure to work miracles before them; they are not like that\nunbelieving Porthos, who must see and touch before he will believe.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Porthos, with an air of finesse, \"I am rather\nincredulous.\"\n\nD'Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder, and as they had\nreached the station where they were to breakfast, the conversation ended\nthere.\n\nAt five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon.\nBlaisois went with him.\n\nIn crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived\nBlaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house. It was there a\nlodging was prepared for them.\n\nAt the hour agreed upon Groslow came. D'Artagnan received him as he\nwould have done a friend of twenty years' standing. Porthos scanned him\nfrom head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the\nblow he had administered to Parry's brother, he was not nearly so\nstrong as himself. Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the\ndisgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality.\n\nIn short, Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception.\n\nAthos and Aramis kept themselves to their role. At midnight they\nwithdrew to their chamber, the door of which was left open on the\npretext of kindly consideration. Furthermore, D'Artagnan went with them,\nleaving Porthos at play with Groslow.\n\nPorthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow, and found him a more\nagreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be.\n\nAs to Groslow, he promised himself that on the following evening he\nwould recover from D'Artagnan what he had lost to Porthos, and on\nleaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment.\n\nThe next day was spent as usual. D'Artagnan went from Captain Groslow\nto Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends. To any one\nnot acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition; but to\nhis friends--to Athos and Aramis--was apparent a certain feverishness in\nhis gayety.\n\n\"What is he contriving?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Athos.\n\nPorthos said nothing, but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles\nhe had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed\nitself in his whole bearing.\n\nArrived at Ryston, D'Artagnan assembled his friends. His face had lost\nthe expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day.\nAthos pinched Aramis's hand.\n\n\"The moment is at hand,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned D'Artagnan, who had overheard him, \"to-night, gentlemen,\nwe rescue the king.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, \"this is no joke, I trust? It would quite cut\nme up.\"\n\n\"You are a very odd man, Athos,\" he replied, \"to doubt me thus. Where\nand when have you seen me trifle with a friend's heart and a king's\nlife? I have told you, and I repeat it, that to-night we rescue Charles\nI. You left it to me to discover the means and I have done so.\"\n\nPorthos looked at D'Artagnan with an expression of profound admiration.\nAramis smiled as one who hopes. Athos was pale, and trembled in every\nlimb.\n\n\"Speak,\" said Athos.\n\n\"We are invited,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"to pass the night with M.\nGroslow. But do you know where?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In the king's room.\"\n\n\"The king's room?\" cried Athos.\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, in the king's room. Groslow is on guard there this\nevening, and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him\ncompany.\"\n\n\"All four of us?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Pardieu! certainly, all four; we couldn't leave our prisoners, could\nwe?\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Tell us about it,\" said Athos, palpitating.\n\n\"We are going, then, we two with our swords, you with daggers. We four\nhave got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain. Monsieur\nPorthos, what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"I say it is easy enough,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"We dress the king in Groslow's clothes. Mousqueton, Grimaud and\nBlaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street. We\nmount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant.\"\n\nAthos placed his two hands on D'Artagnan's shoulders, and gazed at him\nwith his calm, sad smile.\n\n\"I declare, my friend,\" said he, \"that there is not a creature under\nthe sky who equals you in prowess and in courage. Whilst we thought you\nindifferent to our sorrows, which you couldn't share without crime, you\nalone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain. I\nrepeat it, D'Artagnan, you are the best one among us; I bless and love\nyou, my dear son.\"\n\n\"And to think that I couldn't find that out,\" said Porthos, scratching\nhis head; \"it is so simple.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Aramis, \"if I understand rightly we are to kill them all,\neh?\"\n\nAthos shuddered and turned pale.\n\n\"Mordioux!\" answered D'Artagnan, \"I believe we must. I confess I can\ndiscover no other safe and satisfactory way.\"\n\n\"Let us see,\" said Aramis, \"how are we to act?\"\n\n\"I have arranged two plans. Firstly, at a given signal, which shall\nbe the words 'At last,' you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the\nsoldier nearest to you. We, on our side, do the same. That will be four\nkilled. We shall then be matched, four against the remaining five. If\nthese five men give themselves up we gag them; if they resist, we kill\nthem. If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only\nPorthos and myself, why, then, we must resort to heroic measures and\neach give two strokes instead of one. It will take a little longer time\nand may make a greater disturbance, but you will be outside with swords\nand will rush in at the proper time.\"\n\n\"But if you yourselves should be struck?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Impossible!\" said D'Artagnan; \"those beer drinkers are too clumsy and\nawkward. Besides, you will strike at the throat, Porthos; it kills as\nquickly and prevents all outcry.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Porthos; \"it will be a nice little throat cutting.\"\n\n\"Horrible, horrible,\" exclaimed Athos.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said D'Artagnan; \"you would do as much, Mr. Humanity, in a\nbattle. But if you think the king's life is not worth what it must cost\nthere's an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am ill.\"\n\n\"No, you are right,\" said Athos.\n\nAt this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting\nfor them.\n\n\"Where?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar,\" replied the staunch\nPuritan.\n\n\"Good,\" replied Athos, whose blood mounted to his face at the insult\noffered to royalty; \"tell the captain we are coming.\"\n\nThe Puritan then went out. The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight\nhorses and to wait, keeping together and without dismounting, at the\ncorner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was\nlodged.\n\nIt was nine o'clock in the evening; the sentinels had been relieved at\neight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour. D'Artagnan and\nPorthos, armed with their swords, and Athos and Aramis, each carrying\na concealed poniard, approached the house which for the time being was\nCharles Stuart's prison. The two latter followed their captors in the\nhumble guise of captives, without arms.\n\n\"Od's bodikins,\" said Groslow, as the four friends entered, \"I had\nalmost given you up.\"\n\nD'Artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear:\n\n\"The fact is, we, that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, hesitated a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\nD'Artagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis.\n\n\"Aha,\" said Groslow; \"on account of political opinions? No matter. On\nthe contrary,\" he added, laughing, \"if they want to see their Stuart\nthey shall see him.\n\n\"Are we to pass the night in the king's room?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, but in the one next to it, and as the door will remain open it\ncomes to the same thing. Have you provided yourself with money? I assure\nyou I intend to play the devil's game to-night.\"\n\nD'Artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Groslow, and opened the door of the room. \"I will show\nyou the way,\" and he went in first.\n\nD'Artagnan turned to look at his friends. Porthos was perfectly\nindifferent; Athos, pale, but resolute; Aramis was wiping a slight\nmoisture from his brow.\n\nThe eight guards were at their posts. Four in the king's room, two at\nthe door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had\nentered. Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords; he felt it was\nno longer to be a butchery, but a fight, and he resumed his usual good\nhumor.\n\nCharles was perceived through the door, lying dressed upon his bed, at\nthe head of which Parry was seated, reading in a low voice a chapter\nfrom the Bible.\n\nA candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and\nresigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer, far less\ncalm.\n\nFrom time to time Parry stopped, thinking the king, whose eyes were\nclosed, was really asleep, but Charles would open his eyes and say with\na smile:\n\n\"Go on, my good Parry, I am listening.\"\n\nGroslow advanced to the door of the king's room, replaced on his head\nthe hat he had taken off to receive his guests, looked for a moment\ncontemptuously at this simple, yet touching scene, then turning to\nD'Artagnan, assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved.\n\n\"Capital!\" cried the Gascon, \"you would make a distinguished general.\"\n\n\"And do you think,\" asked Groslow, \"that Stuart will ever escape while I\nam on guard?\"\n\n\"No, to be sure,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"unless, forsooth, the sky rains\nfriends upon him.\"\n\nGroslow's face brightened.\n\nIt is impossible to say whether Charles, who kept his eyes constantly\nclosed, had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain, but the moment\nhe heard the clear tone of D'Artagnan's voice his eyelids rose, in spite\nof himself.\n\nParry, too, started and stopped reading.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" said the king; \"go on, my good Parry,\nunless you are tired.\"\n\nParry resumed his reading.\n\nOn a table in the next room were lighted candles, cards, two dice-boxes,\nand dice.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Groslow, \"I beg you will take your places. I will sit\nfacing Stuart, whom I like so much to see, especially where he now is,\nand you, Monsieur d'Artagnan, opposite to me.\"\n\nAthos turned red with rage. D'Artagnan frowned at him.\n\n\"That's it,\" said D'Artagnan; \"you, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, to\nthe right of Monsieur Groslow. You, Chevalier d'Herblay, to his left.\nDu Vallon next me. You'll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur\nGroslow.\"\n\nBy this arrangement D'Artagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and\nmake signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis.\n\nAt the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier d'Herblay, Charles opened\nhis eyes, and raising his noble head, in spite of himself, threw a\nglance at all the actors in the scene.\n\nAt that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read\nwith a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah:\n\n\"God said, 'Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants, whom I have\nsent unto you.'\"\n\nThe four friends exchanged glances. The words that Parry had read\nassured them that their presence was understood by the king and was\nassigned to its real motive. D'Artagnan's eyes sparkled with joy.\n\n\"You asked me just now if I was in funds,\" said D'Artagnan, placing some\ntwenty pistoles upon the table. \"Well, in my turn I advise you to keep a\nsharp lookout on your treasure, my dear Monsieur Groslow, for I can tell\nyou we shall not leave this without robbing you of it.\"\n\n\"Not without my defending it,\" said Groslow.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Fight, my dear captain, fight.\nYou know or you don't know, that that is what we ask of you.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Groslow, bursting with his usual coarse laugh, \"I know\nyou Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises.\"\n\nCharles had heard and understood it all. A slight color mounted to his\ncheeks. The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs, little by little,\nand under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which\ncovered him.\n\nAthos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying\nwith his clothes on.\n\nThe game began. The luck had turned, and Groslow, having won some\nhundred pistoles, was in the merriest possible humor.\n\nPorthos, who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before\nand thirty more besides, was very cross and questioned D'Artagnan with a\nnudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change\nthe game. Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly. But D'Artagnan\nremained impassible.\n\nIt struck ten. They heard the guard going its rounds.\n\n\"How many rounds do they make a night?\" asked D'Artagnan, drawing more\npistoles from his pocket.\n\n\"Five,\" answered Groslow, \"one every two hours.\"\n\nD'Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied\nto Porthos's nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive. Meanwhile, the\nsoldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king's room, attracted by\nthat love of play so powerful in all men, had stolen little by little\ntoward the table, and standing on tiptoe, lounged, watching the game,\nover the shoulders of D'Artagnan and Porthos. Those on the other side\nhad followed their example, thus favoring the views of the four friends,\nwho preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about\nthe chamber. The two sentinels at the door still had their swords\nunsheathed, but they were leaning on them while they watched the game.\n\nAthos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached. With\nhis white, aristocratic hands he played with the louis, bending and\nstraightening them again, as if they were made of pewter. Aramis, less\nself-controlled, fumbled continually with his hidden poniard. Porthos,\nimpatient at his continued losses, kept up a vigorous play with his\nknee.\n\nD'Artagnan turned, mechanically looking behind him, and between the\nfigures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles\nleaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a\nfervent prayer to God.\n\nD'Artagnan saw that the moment was come. He darted a preparatory glance\nat Athos and Aramis, who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so\nas to leave themselves more space for action. He gave Porthos a second\nnudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and\ntook care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn\nsmoothly from the scabbard.\n\n\"Hang it!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"another twenty pistoles lost. Really,\nCaptain Groslow, you are too much in fortune's way. This can't last,\"\nand he drew another twenty from his pocket. \"One more turn, captain;\ntwenty pistoles on one throw--only one, the last.\"\n\n\"Done for twenty,\" replied Groslow.\n\nAnd he turned up two cards as usual, a king for D'Artagnan and an ace\nfor himself.\n\n\"A king,\" said D'Artagnan; \"it's a good omen, Master Groslow--look out\nfor the king.\"\n\nAnd in spite of his extraordinary self-control there was a strange\nvibration in the Gascon's voice which made his partner start.\n\nGroslow began turning the cards one after another. If he turned up an\nace first he won; if a king he lost.\n\nHe turned up a king.\n\n\"At last!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\nAt this word Athos and Aramis jumped up. Porthos drew back a step.\nDaggers and swords were just about to shine, when suddenly the door was\nthrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway, accompanied by a man\nenveloped in a large cloak. Behind this man could be seen the glistening\nmuskets of half a dozen soldiers.\n\nGroslow jumped up, ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine,\ncards, and dice. But Harrison paid not the least attention to him, and\nentering the king's room, followed by his companion:\n\n\"Charles Stuart,\" said he, \"an order has come to conduct you to London\nwithout stopping day or night. Prepare yourself, then, to start at\nonce.\"\n\n\"And by whom is this order given?\" asked the king.\n\n\"By General Oliver Cromwell. And here is Mr. Mordaunt, who has brought\nit and is charged with its execution.\"\n\n\"Mordaunt!\" muttered the four friends, exchanging glances.\n\nD'Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried\nit in his huge pocket. Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him.\nAt this movement Mordaunt turned around, recognized them, and uttered an\nexclamation of savage delight.\n\n\"I'm afraid we are prisoners,\" whispered D'Artagnan to his friend.\n\n\"Not yet,\" replied Porthos.\n\n\"Colonel, colonel,\" cried Mordaunt, \"you are betrayed. These four\nFrenchmen have escaped from Newcastle, and no doubt want to carry off\nthe king. Arrest them.\"\n\n\"Ah! my young man,\" said D'Artagnan, drawing his sword, \"that is an\norder sooner given than executed. Fly, friends, fly!\" he added, whirling\nhis sword around him.\n\nThe next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the\nsoldiers who guarded it, before they had time to cock their muskets.\nAthos and Aramis followed him. Porthos brought up the rear, and before\nsoldiers, officers, or colonel had time to recover their surprise all\nfour were in the street.\n\n\"Fire!\" cried Mordaunt; \"fire upon them!\"\n\nThree or four shots were fired, but with no other result than to show\nthe four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound.\n\nThe horses were at the place fixed upon, and they leaped lightly into\ntheir saddles.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"and spur for your dear lives!\"\n\nThey galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning,\nnamely, in the direction toward Scotland. A few hundred yards beyond the\ntown D'Artagnan drew rein.\n\n\"Halt!\" he cried, \"this time we shall be pursued. We must let them leave\nthe village and ride after us on the northern road, and when they have\npassed we will take the opposite direction.\"\n\nThere was a stream close by and a bridge across it.\n\nD'Artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge. The others\nfollowed. Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of\nhorsemen. A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads.\n\n\n\n\n62. London.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance D'Artagnan\nremounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain, followed by\nhis three friends, directing their course, as well as they could guess,\ntoward London.\n\n\"This time,\" said D'Artagnan, when they were sufficiently distant to\nproceed at a trot, \"I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do\nthan to reach France. What do you say, Athos, to that proposition? Isn't\nit reasonable?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear friend,\" Athos replied, \"but you said a word the other day\nthat was more than reasonable--it was noble and generous. You said, 'Let\nus die here!' I recall to you that word.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Porthos, \"death is nothing: it isn't death that can disquiet\nus, since we don't know what it is. What troubles me is the idea of\ndefeat. As things are turning out, I foresee that we must give battle\nto London, to the provinces, to all England, and certainly in the end we\ncan't fail to be beaten.\"\n\n\"We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene,\" said\nAthos. \"Whatever happens, let us not leave England before the crisis.\nDon't you agree with me, Aramis?\"\n\n\"Entirely, my dear count. Then, too, I confess I should not be sorry to\ncome across Mordaunt again. It appears to me that we have an account to\nsettle with him, and that it is not our custom to leave a place without\npaying our debts, of this kind, at least.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's another thing,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and I should not mind\nwaiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in\nquestion. Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count; for I\nimagine, just now, that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle\nwith us. Athos, do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find\nwhite sheets, roast beef reasonably cooked, and wine which is not made\nof hops and gin?\"\n\n\"I think I know what you want,\" replied Athos. \"De Winter took us to\nthe house of a Spaniard, who, he said, had become naturalized as an\nEnglishman by the guineas of his new compatriots. What do you say to it,\nAramis?\"\n\n\"Why, the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me\nvery reasonable, and for my part I agree to it. We will invoke the\nremembrance of that poor De Winter, for whom he seemed to have a great\nregard; we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is\ngoing on; we will spend with him a guinea each per day; and I think that\nby taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed.\"\n\n\"You forget, Aramis, one precaution of considerable importance.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The precaution of changing our clothes.\"\n\n\"Changing our clothes!\" exclaimed Porthos. \"I don't see why; we are very\ncomfortable in those we wear.\"\n\n\"To prevent recognition,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Our clothes have a cut which\nwould proclaim the Frenchman at first sight. Now, I don't set sufficient\nstore on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for\nchange of scene to the Indies. I shall buy a chestnut-colored suit. I've\nremarked that your Puritans revel in that color.\"\n\n\"But can you find your man?\" said Aramis to Athos.\n\n\"Oh! to be sure, yes. He lives at the Bedford Tavern, Greenhall Street.\nBesides, I can find my way about the city with my eyes shut.\"\n\n\"I wish we were already there,\" said D'Artagnan; \"and my advice is that\nwe reach London before daybreak, even if we kill our horses.\"\n\n\"Come on, then,\" said Athos, \"for unless I am mistaken in my\ncalculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go.\"\n\nThe friends urged on their horses and arrived, in fact, at about five\no'clock in the morning. They were stopped and questioned at the gate\nby which they sought to enter the city, but Athos replied, in excellent\nEnglish, that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce\nto his colleague, Monsieur Bridge, the approach of the king. That\nreply led to several questions about the king's capture, and Athos\ngave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any\nsuspicions they vanished completely. The way was therefore opened to the\nfour friends with all sorts of Puritan congratulations.\n\nAthos was right. He went direct to the Bedford Tavern, and the host, who\nrecognized him, was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and\npromising company.\n\nThough it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a\ngreat bustle, owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king.\n\nThe plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted. The landlord\nsent out for every description of garment, as if he wanted to fit up his\nwardrobe. Athos chose a black coat, which gave him the appearance of\na respectable citizen. Aramis, not wishing to part with his sword,\nselected a dark-blue cloak of a military cut. Porthos was seduced by a\nwine-colored doublet and sea-green breeches. D'Artagnan, who had fixed\non his color beforehand, had only to select the shade, and looked in his\nchestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer.\n\n\"Now,\" said D'Artagnan, \"for the actual man. We must cut off our hair,\nthat the populace may not insult us. As we no longer wear the sword of\nthe gentleman we may as well have the head of the Puritan. This, as you\nknow, is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and\nthe Cavalier.\"\n\nAfter some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role\nof barber.\n\n\"We look hideous,\" said Athos.\n\n\"And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"My head feels actually cold,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"As for me, I feel anxious to preach a sermon,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Now,\" said Athos, \"that we cannot even recognize one another and have\ntherefore no fear of others recognizing us, let us go and see the king's\nentrance.\"\n\nThey had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the\nking's arrival. A carriage had been sent to meet him, and the gigantic\nPorthos, who stood a head above the entire rabble, soon announced that\nhe saw the royal equipage approaching. D'Artagnan raised himself on\ntiptoe, and as the carriage passed, saw Harrison at one window and\nMordaunt at the other.\n\nThe next day, Athos, leaning out of his window, which looked upon the\nmost populous part of the city, heard the Act of Parliament, which\nsummoned the ex-king, Charles I., to the bar, publicly cried.\n\n\"Parliament indeed!\" cried Athos. \"Parliament can never have passed such\nan act as that.\"\n\nAt this moment the landlord came in.\n\n\"Did parliament pass this act?\" Athos asked of him in English.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, the pure parliament.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'the pure parliament'? Are there, then, two\nparliaments?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" D'Artagnan interrupted, \"as I don't understand English\nand we all understand Spanish, have the kindness to speak to us in that\nlanguage, which, since it is your own, you must find pleasure in using\nwhen you have the chance.\"\n\n\"Ah! excellent!\" said Aramis.\n\nAs to Porthos, all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of\nthe breakfast table.\n\n\"You were asking, then?\" said the host in Spanish.\n\n\"I asked,\" said Athos, in the same language, \"if there are two\nparliaments, a pure and an impure?\"\n\n\"Why, how extraordinary!\" said Porthos, slowly raising his head and\nlooking at his friends with an air of astonishment, \"I understand\nEnglish, then! I understand what you say!\"\n\n\"That is because we are talking Spanish, my dear friend,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" said Porthos, \"I am sorry for that; it would have been\none language more.\"\n\n\"When I speak of the pure parliament,\" resumed the host, \"I mean the one\nwhich Colonel Bridge has weeded.\"\n\n\"Ah! really,\" said D'Artagnan, \"these people are very ingenious. When I\ngo back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal\nMazarin and the coadjutor. One of them will weed the parliament in the\nname of the court, and the other in the name of the people; and then\nthere won't be any parliament at all.\"\n\n\"And who is this Colonel Bridge?\" asked Aramis, \"and how does he go to\nwork to weed the parliament?\"\n\n\"Colonel Bridge,\" replied the Spaniard, \"is a retired wagoner, a man of\nmuch sense, who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team,\nnamely, that where there happened to be a stone on the road, it was much\neasier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it.\nNow, of two hundred and fifty-one members who composed the parliament,\nthere were one hundred and ninety-one who were in the way and might have\nupset his political wagon. He took them up, just as he formerly used to\ntake up the stones from the road, and threw them out of the house.\"\n\n\"Neat,\" remarked D'Artagnan. \"Very!\"\n\n\"And all these one hundred and ninety-one were Royalists?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Without doubt, senor; and you understand that they would have saved the\nking.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Porthos, with majestic common sense; \"they were in\nthe majority.\"\n\n\"And you think,\" said Aramis, \"he will consent to appear before such a\ntribunal?\"\n\n\"He will be forced to do so,\" smiled the Spaniard.\n\n\"Now, Athos!\" said D'Artagnan, \"do you begin to believe that it's a\nruined cause, and that what with your Harrisons, Joyces, Bridges and\nCromwells, we shall never get the upper hand?\"\n\n\"The king will be delivered at the tribunal,\" said Athos; \"the very\nsilence of his supporters indicates that they are at work.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"But,\" said Aramis, \"if they dare to condemn their king, it can only be\nto exile or imprisonment.\"\n\nD'Artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity.\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Athos, \"for we shall go to the sittings, I\npresume.\"\n\n\"You will not have long to wait,\" said the landlord; \"they begin\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said D'Artagnan; \"they began the day he was sold.\"\n\n\"And you know,\" said Aramis, \"that it was our friend Mordaunt who made,\nif not the bargain, at least the overtures.\"\n\n\"And you know,\" added D'Artagnan, \"that whenever I catch him I will kill\nhim, this Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" exclaimed Porthos.\n\n\"And I, too,\" added Aramis.\n\n\"Touching unanimity!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"which well becomes good\ncitizens like us. Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little\nfog.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"'twill be at least a little change from beer.\"\n\n\n\n\n63. The Trial.\n\n\n\nThe next morning King Charles I. was haled by a strong guard before the\nhigh court which was to judge him. All London was crowding to the doors\nof the house. The throng was terrific, and it was not till after much\npushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination.\nWhen they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already\noccupied; but being anxious not to be too conspicuous, all, with the\nexception of Porthos, who had a fancy to display his red doublet, were\nquite satisfied with their places, the more so as chance had brought\nthem to the centre of their row, so that they were exactly opposite the\narm-chair prepared for the royal prisoner.\n\nToward eleven o'clock the king entered the hall, surrounded by guards,\nbut wearing his head covered, and with a calm expression turned to every\nside with a look of complete assurance, as if he were there to\npreside at an assembly of submissive subjects, rather than to meet the\naccusations of a rebel court.\n\nThe judges, proud of having a monarch to humiliate, evidently prepared\nto enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves, and sent an officer\nto inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his\nhead.\n\nCharles, without replying a single word, turned his head in another\ndirection and pulled his felt hat over it. Then when the officer was\ngone he sat down in the arm-chair opposite the president and struck\nhis boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand. Parry, who\naccompanied him, stood behind him.\n\nD'Artagnan was looking at Athos, whose face betrayed all those emotions\nwhich the king, possessing more self-control, had banished from his own.\nThis agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos, frightened him.\n\n\"I hope,\" he whispered to him, \"that you will follow his majesty's\nexample and not get killed for your folly in this den.\"\n\n\"Set your mind at rest,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"Aha!\" continued D'Artagnan, \"it is clear that they are afraid of\nsomething or other; for look, the sentinels are being reinforced. They\nhad only halberds before, now they have muskets. The halberds were for\nthe audience in the rear; the muskets are for us.\"\n\n\"Thirty, forty, fifty, sixty-five men,\" said Porthos, counting the\nreinforcements.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Aramis, \"but you forget the officer.\"\n\nD'Artagnan grew pale with rage. He recognized Mordaunt, who with bare\nsword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the\nbenches.\n\n\"Do you think they have recognized us?\" said D'Artagnan. \"In that case I\nshould beat a retreat. I don't care to be shot in a box.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Aramis, \"he has not seen us. He sees no one but the king. Mon\nDieu! how he stares at him, the insolent dog! Does he hate his majesty\nas much as he does us?\"\n\n\"Pardi,\" answered Athos \"we only carried off his mother; the king has\nspoiled him of his name and property.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Aramis; \"but silence! the president is speaking to the\nking.\"\n\n\"Stuart,\" Bradshaw was saying, \"listen to the roll call of your judges\nand address to the court any observations you may have to make.\"\n\nThe king turned his head away, as if these words had not been intended\nfor him. Bradshaw waited, and as there was no reply there was a moment\nof silence.\n\nOut of the hundred and sixty-three members designated there were only\nseventy-three present, for the rest, fearful of taking part in such an\nact, had remained away.\n\nWhen the name of Colonel Fairfax was called, one of those brief but\nsolemn silences ensued, which announced the absence of the members who\nhad no wish to take a personal part in the trial.\n\n\"Colonel Fairfax,\" repeated Bradshaw.\n\n\"Fairfax,\" answered a laughing voice, the silvery tone of which betrayed\nit as that of a woman, \"is not such a fool as to be here.\"\n\nA loud laugh followed these words, pronounced with that boldness which\nwomen draw from their own weakness--a weakness which removes them beyond\nthe power of vengeance.\n\n\"It is a woman's voice,\" cried Aramis; \"faith, I would give a good deal\nif she is young and pretty.\" And he mounted on the bench to try and get\na sight of her.\n\n\"By my soul,\" said Aramis, \"she is charming. Look D'Artagnan; everybody\nis looking at her; and in spite of Bradshaw's gaze she has not turned\npale.\"\n\n\"It is Lady Fairfax herself,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Don't you remember,\nPorthos, we saw her at General Cromwell's?\"\n\nThe roll call continued.\n\n\"These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in\nsufficient force,\" said the Comte de la Fere.\n\n\"You don't know them. Athos, look at Mordaunt's smile. Is that the look\nof a man whose victim is likely to escape him? Ah, cursed basilisk, it\nwill be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look\nwith you.\"\n\n\"The king is really very handsome,\" said Porthos; \"and look, too, though\nhe is a prisoner, how carefully he is dressed. The feather in his hat is\nworth at least five-and-twenty pistoles. Look at it, Aramis.\"\n\nThe roll call finished, the president ordered them to read the act of\naccusation. Athos turned pale. A second time he was disappointed in his\nexpectation. Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to\ncontinue; the king then, was condemned in advance.\n\n\"I told you so, Athos,\" said D'Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders. \"Now\ntake your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is\ngoing to say about his sovereign, with full license and privilege.\"\n\nNever till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished\nkingly majesty.\n\nCharles listened with marked attention, passing over the insults, noting\nthe grievances, and, when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser\nturned executioner beforehand, replying with a smile of lofty scorn.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said D'Artagnan, \"if men are punished for imprudence and\ntriviality, this poor king deserves punishment. But it seems to me that\nthat which he is just now undergoing is hard enough.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" Aramis replied, \"the punishment should fall not on the\nking, but on his ministers; for the first article of the constitution\nis, 'The king can do no wrong.'\"\n\n\"As for me,\" thought Porthos, giving Mordaunt his whole attention, \"were\nit not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation I would leap down\nfrom the bench, reach Mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him; I\nwould then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched\nmusketeers who parody the musketeers of France. Meantime, D'Artagnan,\nwho is full of invention, would find some way to save the king. I must\nspeak to him about it.\"\n\nAs to Athos, his face aflame, his fists clinched, his lips bitten till\nthey bled, he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary\ninsult and that long enduring royal patience; the inflexible arm and\nsteadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by\nexcitement.\n\nAt this moment the accuser concluded with these words: \"The present\naccusation is preferred by us in the name of the English people.\"\n\nAt these words there was a murmur along the benches, and a second voice,\nnot that of a woman, but a man's, stout and furious, thundered behind\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"You lie!\" it cried. \"Nine-tenths of the English people are horrified at\nwhat you say.\"\n\nThis voice was that of Athos, who, standing up with outstretched hand\nand quite out of his mind, thus assailed the public accuser.\n\nKing, judges, spectators, all turned their eyes to the bench where\nthe four friends were seated. Mordaunt did the same and recognized the\ngentleman, around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing, pale and\nmenacing. His eyes glittered with delight. He had discovered those to\nwhose death he had devoted his life. A movement of fury called to his\nside some twenty of his musketeers, and pointing to the bench where his\nenemies were: \"Fire on that bench!\" he cried.\n\nBut with the rapidity of thought D'Artagnan seized Athos by the waist,\nand followed by Porthos with Aramis, leaped down from the benches,\nrushed into the passages, and flying down the staircase were lost in\nthe crowd without, while the muskets within were pointed on some three\nthousand spectators, whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the\nimpulse already given to bloodshed.\n\nCharles also had recognized the four Frenchmen. He put one hand on his\nheart to still its beating and the other over his eyes, that he might\nnot witness the slaying of his faithful friends.\n\nMordaunt, pale and trembling with anger, rushed from the hall sword in\nhand, followed by six pikemen, pushing, inquiring and panting in the\ncrowd; and then, having found nothing, returned.\n\nThe tumult was indescribable. More than half an hour passed before any\none could make himself heard. The judges were looking for a new outbreak\nfrom the benches. The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them, and\ndivided between fear and curiosity, remained noisy and excited.\n\nQuiet was at length restored.\n\n\"What have you to say in your defense?\" asked Bradshaw of the king.\n\nThen rising, with his head still covered, in the tone of a judge rather\nthan a prisoner, Charles began.\n\n\"Before questioning me,\" he said, \"reply to my question. I was free at\nNewcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses. Instead of\nperforming your part of this contract, as I performed mine, you bought\nme from the Scotch, cheaply, I know, and that does honor to the economic\ntalent of your government. But because you have paid the price of a\nslave, do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king? No. To answer\nyou would be to forget it. I shall only reply to you when you have\nsatisfied me of your right to question me. To answer you would be\nto acknowledge you as my judges, and I only acknowledge you as my\nexecutioners.\" And in the middle of a deathlike silence, Charles, calm,\nlofty, and with his head still covered, sat down again in his arm-chair.\n\n\"Why are not my Frenchmen here?\" he murmured proudly and turning his\neyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment; \"they would\nhave seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive, and\nof their tears when dead.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the president, seeing that Charles was determined to remain\nsilent, \"so be it. We will judge you in spite of your silence. You are\naccused of treason, of abuse of power, and murder. The evidence will\nsupport it. Go, and another sitting will accomplish what you have\npostponed in this.\"\n\nCharles rose and turned toward Parry, whom he saw pale and with his\ntemples dewed with moisture.\n\n\"Well, my dear Parry,\" said he, \"what is the matter, and what can affect\nyou in this manner?\"\n\n\"Oh, my king,\" said Parry, with tears in his eyes and in a tone of\nsupplication, \"do not look to the left as we leave the hall.\"\n\n\"And why, Parry?\"\n\n\"Do not look, I implore you, my king.\"\n\n\"But what is the matter? Speak,\" said Charles, attempting to look across\nthe hedge of guards which surrounded him.\n\n\"It is--but you will not look, will you?--it is because they have had\nthe axe, with which criminals are executed, brought and placed there on\nthe table. The sight is hideous.\"\n\n\"Fools,\" said Charles, \"do they take me for a coward, like themselves?\nYou have done well to warn me. Thank you, Parry.\"\n\nWhen the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall. As\nhe passed the table on which the axe was laid, he stopped, and turning\nwith a smile, said:\n\n\"Ah! the axe, an ingenious device, and well worthy of those who know not\nwhat a gentleman is; you frighten me not, executioner's axe,\" added he,\ntouching it with the cane which he held in his hand, \"and I strike you\nnow, waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return the blow.\"\n\nAnd shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on. When\nhe reached the door a stream of people, who had been disappointed in not\nbeing able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see\nhim come out, stood on each side, as he passed, many among them glaring\non him with threatening looks.\n\n\"How many people,\" thought he, \"and not one true friend.\"\n\nAnd as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind, a\nvoice beside him said:\n\n\"Respect to fallen majesty.\"\n\nThe king turned quickly around, with tears in his eyes and heart. It\nwas an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive\nbefore him without rendering him this final homage. But the next moment\nthe unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword-hilts,\nand among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Charles, \"that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling\nfault.\"\n\nHe continued his walk, but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces, when a\nfurious fellow, leaning between two soldiers, spat in the king's face,\nas once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of\nNazareth. Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together. The\ncrowd opened and closed again, undulating like a stormy sea, and the\nking imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the\nbright eyes of Athos.\n\nCharles wiped his face and said with a sad smile: \"Poor wretch, for half\na crown he would do as much to his own father.\"\n\nThe king was not mistaken. Athos and his friends, again mingling with\nthe throng, were taking a last look at the martyr king.\n\nWhen the soldier saluted Charles, Athos's heart bounded for joy; and\nthat unfortunate, on coming to himself, found ten guineas that the\nFrench gentleman had slipped into his pocket. But when the cowardly\ninsulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his\ndagger. But D'Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried,\n\"Wait!\"\n\nAthos stopped. D'Artagnan, leaning on Athos, made a sign to Porthos and\nAramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with\nthe bare arms, who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and\nreceiving the congratulations of several others.\n\nThe man took his way toward the city. The four friends followed him. The\nman, who had the appearance of being a butcher, descended a little steep\nand isolated street, looking on to the river, with two of his friends.\nArrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were\nfollowed, turned around, and looking insolently at the Frenchmen, passed\nsome jests from one to another.\n\n\"I don't know English, Athos,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but you know it and\nwill interpret for me.\"\n\nThen quickening their steps they passed the three men, but turned\nback immediately, and D'Artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and\ntouching him on the chest with the tip of his finger, said to Athos:\n\n\"Say this to him in English: 'You are a coward. You have insulted a\ndefenseless man. You have befouled the face of your king. You must\ndie.'\"\n\nAthos, pale as a ghost, repeated these words to the man, who, seeing\nthe bodeful preparations that were making, put himself in an attitude of\ndefense. Aramis, at this movement, drew his sword.\n\n\"No,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"no steel. Steel is for gentlemen.\"\n\nAnd seizing the butcher by the throat:\n\n\"Porthos,\" said he, \"kill this fellow for me with a single blow.\"\n\nPorthos raised his terrible fist, which whistled through the air like\na sling, and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the\ninsulter's skull and crushed it. The man fell like an ox beneath the\npoleaxe. His companions, horror-struck, could neither move nor cry out.\n\n\"Tell them this, Athos,\" resumed D'Artagnan; \"thus shall all die who\nforget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly\nrepresents the Lord.\"\n\nAthos repeated D'Artagnan's words.\n\nThe fellows looked at the body of their companion, swimming in blood,\nand then recovering voice and legs together, ran screaming off.\n\n\"Justice is done,\" said Porthos, wiping his forehead.\n\n\"And now,\" said D'Artagnan to Athos, \"entertain no further doubts about\nme; I undertake all that concerns the king.\"\n\n\n\n\n64. Whitehall.\n\n\n\nThe parliament condemned Charles to death, as might have been foreseen.\nPolitical judgments are generally vain formalities, for the same\npassions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation.\nSuch is the atrocious logic of revolutions.\n\nAlthough our friends were expecting that condemnation, it filled them\nwith grief. D'Artagnan, whose mind was never more fertile in resources\nthan in critical emergencies, swore again that he would try all\nconceivable means to prevent the denouement of the bloody tragedy. But\nby what means? As yet he could form no definite plan; all must depend on\ncircumstances. Meanwhile, it was necessary at all hazards, in order\nto gain time, to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the\nfollowing day--the day appointed by the judges. The only way of doing\nthat was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner. The\nheadsman out of the way, the sentence could not be executed. True, they\ncould send for the headsman of the nearest town, but at least a\nday would be gained, and a day might be sufficient for the rescue.\nD'Artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task.\n\nAnother thing, not less essential, was to warn Charles Stuart of the\nattempt to be made, so that he might assist his rescuers as much as\npossible, or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts. Aramis assumed\nthat perilous charge. Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might\nbe permitted to visit him. Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very\nevening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king\nand also of Cromwell's permission. Aramis determined to obtain from the\nbishop, through fear or by persuasion, consent that he should enter\nin the bishop's place, and clad in his sacerdotal robes, the prison at\nWhitehall.\n\nFinally, Athos undertook to provide, in any event, the means of leaving\nEngland--in case either of failure or of success.\n\nThe night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o'clock\nat the hotel, and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission.\n\nThe palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by\nthe fierce anxiety of Cromwell, who came and went or sent his generals\nor his agents continually. Alone in his usual room, lighted by two\ncandles, the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past\ngreatness, just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more\nmildly brilliant than of yore.\n\nParry had not quitted his master, and since his condemnation had not\nceased to weep. Charles, leaning on a table, was gazing at a medallion\nof his wife and daughter; he was waiting first for Juxon, then for\nmartyrdom.\n\nAt times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to\nhim from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal, like the\nforms that appear in dreams. In fact, he sometimes asked himself if all\nthat was happening to him was not a dream, or at least the delirium of\na fever. He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his\ntorpor and went as far as the window; he saw glittering below him the\nmuskets of the guards. He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was\nindeed awake and that his bloody dream was real.\n\nCharles returned in silence to his chair, rested his elbow on the table,\nbowed his head upon his hand and reflected.\n\n\"Alas!\" he said to himself, \"if I only had for a confessor one of those\nlights of the church, whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life,\nall the littlenesses of greatness, perhaps his utterance would overawe\nthe voice that wails within my soul. But I shall have a priest of vulgar\nmind, whose career and fortune I have ruined by my misfortune. He will\nspeak to me of God and death, as he has spoken to many another dying\nman, not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper,\nhis children to the cold contempt of public charity.\"\n\nAnd he raised the medallion to his lips.\n\nIt was a dull, foggy night. A neighboring church clock slowly struck\nthe hour. The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom\nshadows in the lofty room. These were the ancestors of Charles, standing\nback dimly in their tarnished frames.\n\nAn awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles. He buried his brow in\nhis hands and thought of the world, so beautiful when one is about\nto leave it; of the caresses of children, so pleasing and so sweet,\nespecially when one is parting from his children never to see them\nagain; then of his wife, the noble and courageous woman who had\nsustained him to the last moment. He drew from his breast the diamond\ncross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those\ngenerous Frenchmen; he kissed it, and then, as he reflected, that she\nwould never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the\ntomb, there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called\nforerunners of death.\n\nThen, in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs,\nwhither had come so many courtiers, the scene of so much flattering\nhomage, alone with a despairing servant, whose feeble soul could afford\nno support to his own, the king at last yielded to sorrow, and his\ncourage sank to a level with that feebleness, those shadows, and that\nwintry cold. That king, who was so grand, so sublime in the hour of\ndeath, meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips, now\nin that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and\nquivered on the gold embroidered cloth.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered,\nfollowed by two guards, to whom the king waved an imperious gesture. The\nguards retired; the room resumed its obscurity.\n\n\"Juxon!\" cried Charles, \"Juxon, thank you, my last friend; you come at a\nfitting moment.\"\n\nThe bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle-nook.\n\n\"Come, Parry,\" said the king, \"cease your tears.\"\n\n\"If it's Parry,\" said the bishop, \"I have nothing to fear; so allow me\nto salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am come.\"\n\nAt this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out, when Aramis\nplaced his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England.\n\n\"The chevalier!\" murmured Charles.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" interrupted Aramis, raising his voice, \"Bishop Juxon, the\nfaithful knight of Christ, obedient to your majesty's wishes.\"\n\nCharles clasped his hands, amazed and stupefied to find that these\nforeigners, without other motive than that which their conscience\nimposed on them, thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a\nking.\n\n\"You!\" he said, \"you! how did you penetrate hither? If they recognize\nyou, you are lost.\"\n\n\"Care not for me, sire; think only of yourself. You see, your friends\nare wakeful. I know not what we shall do yet, but four determined men\ncan do much. Meanwhile, do not be surprised at anything that happens;\nprepare yourself for every emergency.\"\n\nCharles shook his head.\n\n\"Do you know that I die to-morrow at ten o'clock?\"\n\n\"Something, your majesty, will happen between now and then to make the\nexecution impossible.\"\n\nThe king looked at Aramis with astonishment.\n\nAt this moment a strange noise, like the unloading of a cart, and\nfollowed by a cry of pain, was heard beneath the window.\n\n\"Do you hear?\" said the king.\n\n\"I hear,\" said Aramis, \"but I understand neither the noise nor the cry\nof pain.\"\n\n\"I know not who can have uttered the cry,\" said the king, \"but the noise\nis easily understood. Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this\nwindow? Well, these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks\nto build my scaffold. Some workmen must have fallen underneath them and\nbeen hurt.\"\n\nAramis shuddered in spite of himself.\n\n\"You see,\" said the king, \"that it is useless for you to resist. I am\ncondemned; leave me to my death.\"\n\n\"My king,\" said Aramis, \"they well may raise a scaffold, but they cannot\nmake an executioner.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the king.\n\n\"I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by\nforce or persuasion. The scaffold will be ready by to-morrow, but the\nheadsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"What then?\" said the king.\n\n\"To-morrow night we shall rescue you.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" cried the king, whose face was lighted up, in spite\nof himself, by a flash of joy.\n\n\"Oh! sir,\" cried Parry, \"may you and yours be blessed!\"\n\n\"How can it be?\" repeated the king. \"I must know, so that I may assist\nyou if there is any chance.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" continued Aramis, \"but the cleverest, the\nbravest, the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him, 'Tell\nthe king that to-morrow at ten o'clock at night, we shall carry him\noff.' He has said it and will do it.\"\n\n\"Tell me the name of that generous friend,\" said the king, \"that I may\ncherish for him an eternal gratitude, whether he succeeds or not.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan, sire, the same who had so nearly rescued you when Colonel\nHarrison made his untimely entrance.\"\n\n\"You are, indeed, wonderful men,\" said the king; \"if such things had\nbeen related to me I should not have believed them.\"\n\n\"Now, sire,\" resumed Aramis, \"listen to me. Do not forget for a single\ninstant that we are watching over your safety; observe the smallest\ngesture, the least bit of song, the least sign from any one near you;\nwatch everything, hear everything, interpret everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, chevalier!\" cried the king, \"what can I say to you? There is no\nword, though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart, that\ncan express my gratitude. If you succeed I do not say that you will save\na king; no, in presence of the scaffold as I am, royalty, I assure\nyou, is a very small affair; but you will save a husband to his wife, a\nfather to his children. Chevalier, take my hand; it is that of a friend\nwho will love you to his last sigh.\"\n\nAramis stooped to kiss the king's hand, but Charles clasped his and\npressed it to his heart.\n\nAt this moment a man entered, without even knocking at the door. Aramis\ntried to withdraw his hand, but the king still held it. The man was one\nof those Puritans, half preacher and half soldier, who swarmed around\nCromwell.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\" said the king.\n\n\"I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end?\"\nsaid the stranger.\n\n\"And what is it to you?\" replied the king; \"we are not of the same\nreligion.\"\n\n\"All men are brothers,\" said the Puritan. \"One of my brothers is about\nto die and I come to prepare him.\"\n\n\"Bear with him,\" whispered Aramis; \"it is doubtless some spy.\"\n\n\"After my reverend lord bishop,\" said the king to the man, \"I shall hear\nyou with pleasure, sir.\"\n\nThe man retired, but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an\nattention which did not escape the king.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said the king, when the door was closed, \"I believe you are\nright and that this man only came here with evil intentions. Take care\nthat no misfortune befalls you when you leave.\"\n\n\"I thank your majesty,\" said Aramis, \"but under these robes I have a\ncoat of mail, a pistol and a dagger.\"\n\n\"Go, then, sir, and God keep you!\"\n\nThe king accompanied him to the door, where Aramis pronounced his\nbenediction upon him, and passing through the ante-rooms, filled with\nsoldiers, jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop's palace.\nJuxon was waiting for him impatiently.\n\n\"Well?\" said he, on perceiving Aramis.\n\n\"Everything has succeeded as I expected; spies, guards, satellites, all\ntook me for you, and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless\nhim.\"\n\n\"May God protect you, my son; for your example has given me at the same\ntime hope and courage.\"\n\nAramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he\nmight again have recourse to him.\n\nHe had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he\nwas followed by a man, wrapped in a large cloak. He placed his hand\non his dagger and stopped. The man came straight toward him. It was\nPorthos.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" cried Aramis.\n\n\"You see, we had each our mission,\" said Porthos; \"mine was to guard you\nand I am doing so. Have you seen the king?\"\n\n\"Yes, and all goes well.\"\n\n\"We are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven.\"\n\nIt was then striking half-past ten by St. Paul's.\n\nArrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos entered.\n\n\"All's well,\" he cried, as he entered; \"I have hired a cedar wherry, as\nlight as a canoe, as easy on the wing as any swallow. It is waiting for\nus at Greenwich, opposite the Isle of Dogs, manned by a captain and four\nmen, who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at\nour disposition three successive nights. Once on board we drop down the\nThames and in two hours are on the open sea. In case I am killed,\nthe captain's name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning. A\nhandkerchief, tied at the four corners, is to be the signal.\"\n\nNext moment D'Artagnan entered.\n\n\"Empty your pockets,\" said he; \"I want a hundred pounds, and as for my\nown----\" and he emptied them inside out.\n\nThe sum was collected in a minute. D'Artagnan ran out and returned\ndirectly after.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"it's done. Ough! and not without a deal of trouble,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Has the executioner left London?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Ah, you see that plan was not sure enough; he might go out by one gate\nand return by another.\"\n\n\"Where is he, then?\"\n\n\"In the cellar.\"\n\n\"The cellar--what cellar?\"\n\n\"Our landlord's, to be sure. Mousqueton is propped against the door and\nhere's the key.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" said Aramis, \"how did you manage it?\"\n\n\"Like everything else, with money; but it cost me dear.\"\n\n\"How much?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Five hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"And where did you get so much money?\" said Athos. \"Had you, then, that\nsum?\"\n\n\"The queen's famous diamond,\" answered D'Artagnan, with a sigh.\n\n\"Ah, true,\" said Aramis. \"I recognized it on your finger.\"\n\n\"You bought it back, then, from Monsieur des Essarts?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Yes, but it was fated that I should not keep it.\"\n\n\"So, then, we are all right as regards the executioner,\" said Athos;\n\"but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant, his man, or\nwhatever you call him.\"\n\n\"And this one had his,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but, as good luck would have\nit, just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage, our friend\nwas brought home with a broken leg. In the excess of his zeal he had\naccompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king's\nwindow, and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Aramis, \"that accounts for the cry I heard.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but as he is a thoughtful young man he\npromised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already\nat the scaffold, and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom\nLowe, an assistant carpenter and friend of his, to go down to Whitehall,\nwith three of his friends. Here's the letter he sent by a messenger, for\nsixpence, who sold it to me for a guinea.\"\n\n\"And what on earth are you going to do with it?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Can't you guess, my dear Athos? You, who speak English like John\nBull himself, are Master Tom Lowe, we, your three companions. Do you\nunderstand it now?\"\n\nAthos uttered a cry of joy and admiration, ran to a closet and drew\nforth workmen's clothes, which the four friends immediately put on; they\nthen left the hotel, Athos carrying a saw, Porthos a vise, Aramis an axe\nand D'Artagnan a hammer and some nails.\n\nThe letter from the executioner's assistant satisfied the master\ncarpenter that those were the men he expected.\n\n\n\n\n65. The Workmen.\n\n\n\nToward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window. It arose\nfrom blows of hammer and hatchet, clinking of pincers and cranching of\nsaws.\n\nLying dressed upon his bed, the noise awoke him with a start and found a\ngloomy echo in his heart. He could not endure it, and sent Parry to ask\nthe sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb\nthe last slumber of one who had been their king. The sentinel was\nunwilling to leave his post, but allowed Parry to pass.\n\nArriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold, over which\nthey were nailing a covering of black serge. Raised to the height of\ntwenty feet, so as to be on a level with the window, it had two lower\nstories. Parry, odious as was this sight to him, sought for those among\nsome eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise; and fixed on\ntwo men, who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Parry, mounting the scaffold and standing beside\nthem, \"would you work a little more quietly? The king wishes to get a\nsleep.\"\n\nOne of the two, who was standing up, was of gigantic size and was\ndriving a pick with all his might into the wall, whilst the other,\nkneeling beside him, was collecting the pieces of stone. The face of the\nfirst was lost to Parry in the darkness; but as the second turned around\nand placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement.\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" said the workman aloud, in excellent English.\n\"Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he will sleep better\nto-morrow night.\"\n\nThese blunt words, so terrible if taken literally, were received by the\nother workmen with a roar of laughter. But Parry withdrew, thinking he\nwas dreaming.\n\nCharles was impatiently awaiting his return. At the moment he\nre-entered, the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the\nopening, curious as to what the king was doing. The king was lying on\nhis bed, resting on his elbow. Parry closed the door and approaching the\nking, his face radiant with joy:\n\n\"Sire,\" he said, in a low voice, \"do you know who these workmen are who\nare making so much noise?\"\n\n\"I? No; how would you have me know?\"\n\nParry bent his head and whispered to the king: \"It is the Comte de la\nFere and his friends.\"\n\n\"Raising my scaffold!\" cried the king, astounded.\n\n\"Yes, and at the same time making a hole in the wall.\"\n\nThe king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven; then leaping\ndown from his bed he went to the window, and pulling aside the curtain\ntried to distinguish the figures outside, but in vain.\n\nParry was not wrong. It was Athos he had recognized, and Porthos who was\nboring a hole through the wall.\n\nThis hole communicated with a kind of loft--the space between the floor\nof the king's room and the ceiling of the one below it. Their plan was\nto pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out\nfrom below a piece of the flooring of the king's room, so as to form a\nkind of trap-door.\n\nThrough this the king was to escape the next night, and, hidden by the\nblack covering of the scaffold, was to change his dress for that of a\nworkman, slip out with his deliverers, pass the sentinels, who would\nsuspect nothing, and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at\nGreenwich.\n\nDay gilded the tops of the houses. The aperture was finished and Athos\npassed through it, carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped\nin black cloth, and the tools with which he was to open a communication\nwith the king's room. He had only two hours' work to do to open\ncommunication with the king and, according to the calculations of\nthe four friends, they had the entire day before them, since, the\nexecutioner being absent, another must be sent for to Bristol.\n\nD'Artagnan returned to change his workman's clothes for his\nchestnut-colored suit, and Porthos to put on his red doublet. As for\nAramis, he went off to the bishop's palace to see if he could possibly\npass in with Juxon to the king's presence. All three agreed to meet at\nnoon in Whitehall Place to see how things went on.\n\nBefore leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where\nAthos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to\ngain another interview with the king.\n\n\"Adieu, then, and be of good courage,\" said Athos. \"Report to the king\nthe condition of affairs. Say to him that when he is alone it will help\nus if he will knock on the floor, for then I can continue my work in\nsafety. Try, Aramis, to keep near the king. Speak loud, very loud, for\nthey will be listening at the door. If there is a sentinel within the\napartment, kill him without hesitation. If there are two, let Parry kill\none and you the other. If there are three, let yourself be slain, but\nsave the king.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" said Aramis; \"I will take two poniards and give one to Parry.\nIs that all?\"\n\n\"Yes, go; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity.\nWhile you are fighting if there is a fight, he must flee. The trap once\nreplaced over his head, you being on the trap, dead or alive, they will\nneed at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped. In\nthose ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be\nsaved.\"\n\n\"Everything shall be done as you say, Athos. Your hand, for perhaps we\nshall not see each other again.\"\n\nAthos put his arm around Aramis's neck and embraced him.\n\n\"For you,\" he said. \"Now if I die, say to D'Artagnan that I love him as\na son, and embrace him for me. Embrace also our good and brave Porthos.\nAdieu.\"\n\n\"Adieu,\" said Aramis. \"I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I\nam sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world.\"\n\nAramis parted from Athos, went down from the scaffold in his turn and\ntook his way to the hotel, whistling the air of a song in praise of\nCromwell. He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good\nfire, drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken. Porthos\nwas cursing the infamous parliamentarians; D'Artagnan ate in silence,\nrevolving in his mind the most audacious plans.\n\nAramis related what had been agreed upon. D'Artagnan approved with a\nmovement of the head and Porthos with his voice.\n\n\"Bravo!\" he said; \"besides, we shall be there at the time of the flight.\nWhat with D'Artagnan, Grimaud and Mousqueton, we can manage to dispatch\neight of them. I say nothing about Blaisois, for he is only fit to hold\nthe horses. Two minutes a man makes four minutes. Mousqueton will lose\nanother, that's five; and in five minutes we shall have galloped a\nquarter of a league.\"\n\nAramis swallowed a hasty mouthful, gulped a glass of wine and changed\nhis clothes.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I'm off to the bishop's. Take care of the executioner,\nD'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"All right. Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the\ncellar door.\"\n\n\"Well, don't be inactive.\"\n\n\"Inactive, my dear fellow! Ask Porthos. I pass my life upon my legs.\"\n\nAramis again presented himself at the bishop's. Juxon consented the more\nreadily to take him with him, as he would require an assistant priest in\ncase the king should wish to communicate. Dressed as Aramis had been\nthe night before, the bishop got into his carriage, and the former, more\ndisguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon's dress, got\nin by his side. The carriage stopped at the door of the palace.\n\nIt was about nine o'clock in the morning.\n\nNothing was changed. The ante-rooms were still full of soldiers, the\npassages still lined by guards. The king was already sanguine, but\nwhen he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy. He embraced Juxon\nand pressed the hand of Aramis. The bishop affected to speak in a loud\nvoice, before every one, of their previous interview. The king replied\nthat the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit, and that\nhe desired another under the same conditions. Juxon turned to those\npresent and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the\nking. Every one withdrew. As soon as the door was closed:\n\n\"Sire,\" said Aramis, speaking rapidly, \"you are saved; the London\nexecutioner has vanished. His assistant broke his leg last night\nbeneath your majesty's window--the cry we heard was his--and there is no\nexecutioner nearer at hand than Bristol.\"\n\n\"But the Comte de la Fere?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Two feet below you; take the poker from the fireplace and strike three\ntimes on the floor. He will answer you.\"\n\nThe king did so, and the moment after, three muffled knocks, answering\nthe given signal, sounded beneath the floor.\n\n\"So,\" said Charles, \"he who knocks down there----\"\n\n\"Is the Comte de la Fere, sire,\" said Aramis. \"He is preparing a way\nfor your majesty to escape. Parry, for his part, will raise this slab of\nmarble and a passage will be opened.\"\n\n\"Oh, Juxon,\" said the king, seizing the bishop's two hands in his own,\n\"promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for\nthe other that you hear beneath your feet, and for two others also, who,\nwherever they may be, are on the watch for my safety.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Juxon, \"you shall be obeyed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly, when\nsuddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage. Aramis seized the\npoker and gave the signal to stop; the noise came nearer and nearer.\nIt was that of a number of men steadily approaching. The four men stood\nmotionless. All eyes were fixed on the door, which opened slowly and\nwith a kind of solemnity.\n\nA parliamentary officer, clothed in black and with a gravity that\naugured ill, entered, bowed to the king, and unfolding a parchment, read\nthe sentence, as is usually done to criminals before their execution.\n\n\"What is this?\" said Aramis to Juxon.\n\nJuxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis\nabout it.\n\n\"Then it is for to-day?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning?\"\n\n\"Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London\nexecutioner?\"\n\n\"The London executioner has disappeared, your majesty, but a man has\noffered his services instead. The execution will therefore only be\ndelayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal\naffairs.\"\n\nA slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles\nevinced, as he learned these tidings. But Aramis was livid. His heart\nceased beating, he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table. Charles\nperceived it and took his hand.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" said he, \"courage.\" Then he turned to the officer.\n\"Sir, I am ready. There is but little reason why I should delay you.\nFirstly, I wish to communicate; secondly, to embrace my children and bid\nthem farewell for the last time. Will this be permitted me?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the officer, and left the room.\n\nAramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud.\n\n\"Oh! my lord bishop,\" he cried, seizing Juxon's hands, \"where is\nProvidence? where is Providence?\"\n\n\"My son,\" replied the bishop, with firmness, \"you see Him not, because\nthe passions of the world conceal Him.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the king to Aramis, \"do not take it so to heart. You\nask what God is doing. God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom, and\nbelieve me, both will have their reward. Ascribe to men, then, what is\nhappening, and not to God. It is men who drive me to death; it is men\nwho make you weep.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" said Aramis, \"yes, you are right. It is men whom I should\nhold responsible, and I will hold them responsible.\"\n\n\"Be seated, Juxon,\" said the king, falling upon his knees. \"I have now\nto confess to you. Remain, sir,\" he added to Aramis, who had moved to\nleave the room. \"Remain, Parry. I have nothing to say that cannot be\nsaid before all.\"\n\nJuxon sat down, and the king, kneeling humbly before him, began his\nconfession.\n\n\n\n\n66. Remember!\n\n\n\nThe mob had already assembled when the confession terminated. The king's\nchildren next arrived--the Princess Charlotte, a beautiful, fair-haired\nchild, with tears in her eyes, and the Duke of Gloucester, a boy eight\nor nine years old, whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a\ngrowing pride. He had wept all night long, but would not show his grief\nbefore the people.\n\nCharles's heart melted within him at the sight of those two children,\nwhom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of\ndeath. He turned to brush away a tear, and then, summoning up all his\nfirmness, drew his daughter toward him, recommending her to be pious and\nresigned. Then he took the boy upon his knee.\n\n\"My son,\" he said to him, \"you saw a great number of people in the\nstreets as you came here. These men are going to behead your father.\nDo not forget that. Perhaps some day they will want to make you\nking, instead of the Prince of Wales, or the Duke of York, your elder\nbrothers. But you are not the king, my son, and can never be so while\nthey are alive. Swear to me, then, never to let them put a crown\nupon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown. For one\nday--listen, my son--one day, if you do so, they will doom you to\ndestruction, head and crown, too, and then you will not be able to die\nwith a calm conscience, as I die. Swear, my son.\"\n\nThe child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and\nsaid, \"I swear to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Henry,\" said Charles, \"call me your father.\"\n\n\"Father,\" replied the child, \"I swear to you that they shall kill me\nsooner than make me king.\"\n\n\"Good, my child. Now kiss me; and you, too, Charlotte. Never forget me.\"\n\n\"Oh! never, never!\" cried both the children, throwing their arms around\ntheir father's neck.\n\n\"Farewell,\" said Charles, \"farewell, my children. Take them away, Juxon;\ntheir tears will deprive me of the courage to die.\"\n\nJuxon led them away, and this time the doors were left open.\n\nMeanwhile, Athos, in his concealment, waited in vain the signal to\nrecommence his work. Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction. A\ndeathlike silence reigned in the room above. At last he determined to\ndiscover the cause of this stillness. He crept from his hole and stood,\nhidden by the black drapery, beneath the scaffold. Peeping out from the\ndrapery, he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the\nscaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like\nthe sea.\n\n\"What is the matter, then?\" he asked himself, trembling more than the\nwind-swayed cloth he was holding back. \"The people are hurrying on, the\nsoldiers under arms, and among the spectators I see D'Artagnan. What is\nhe waiting for? What is he looking at? Good God! have they allowed the\nheadsman to escape?\"\n\nSuddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square. The sound\nof heavy steps was heard above his head. The next moment the very planks\nof the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession,\nand the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the\nbottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing. At the same\nmoment a well-known voice above him pronounced these words:\n\n\"Colonel, I want to speak to the people.\"\n\nAthos shuddered from head to foot. It was the king speaking on the\nscaffold.\n\nIn fact, after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread, Charles,\nweary of waiting for death, had suddenly decided to go to meet it and\nhad given the signal for movement. Then the two wings of the window\nfacing the square had been thrown open, and the people had seen silently\nadvancing from the interior of the vast chamber, first, a masked man,\nwho, carrying an axe in his hand, was recognized as the executioner. He\napproached the block and laid his axe upon it. Behind him, pale indeed,\nbut marching with a firm step, was Charles Stuart, who advanced between\ntwo priests, followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside\nat the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their\nplaces on opposite sides of the scaffold.\n\nThe sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation. Every\none was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could\nbe who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the\npromised spectacle, when the people believed it had been postponed until\nthe following day. All gazed at him searchingly.\n\nBut they could discern nothing but a man of middle height, dressed in\nblack, apparently of a certain age, for the end of a gray beard peeped\nout from the bottom of the mask that hid his features.\n\nThe king's request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative\nsign, for in firm, sonorous accents, which vibrated in the depths of\nAthos's heart, the king began his speech, explaining his conduct and\ncounseling the welfare of the kingdom.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Athos to himself, \"is it indeed possible that I hear what I\nhear and that I see what I see? Is it possible that God has abandoned\nHis representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably? And I\nhave not seen him! I have not said adieu to him!\"\n\nA noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved\nupon the block.\n\n\"Do not touch the axe,\" said the king, and resumed his speech.\n\nAt the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the\npeople. Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent\nhim, he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon. Then\nhe drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds, which, like the\norder, had been the gift of Henrietta Maria.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he to the priest, \"I shall keep this cross in my hand till\nthe last moment. Take it from me when I am--dead.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" said a voice, which Athos recognized as that of Aramis.\n\nHe then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground. One by\none he undid the buttons of his doublet, took it off and deposited it by\nthe side of his hat. Then, as it was cold, he asked for his gown, which\nwas brought to him.\n\nAll the preparations were made with a frightful calmness. One would have\nthought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin.\n\n\"Will these be in your way?\" he said to the executioner, raising his\nlong locks; \"if so, they can be tied up.\"\n\nCharles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the\nmask of the unknown headsman. His calm, noble gaze forced the man\nto turn away his head. But after the searching look of the king he\nencountered the burning eyes of Aramis.\n\nThe king, seeing that he did not reply, repeated his question.\n\n\"It will do,\" replied the man, in a tremulous voice, \"if you separate\nthem across the neck.\"\n\nThe king parted his hair with his hands, and looking at the block he\nsaid:\n\n\"This block is very low, is there no other to be had?\"\n\n\"It is the usual block,\" answered the man in the mask.\n\n\"Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?\" asked the king.\n\n\"I hope so,\" was the reply. There was something so strange in these\nthree words that everybody, except the king, shuddered.\n\n\"I do not wish to be taken by surprise,\" added the king. \"I shall kneel\ndown to pray; do not strike then.\"\n\n\"When shall I strike?\"\n\n\"When I shall lay my head on the block and say 'Remember!' then strike\nboldly.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the king to those around him, \"I leave you to brave\nthe tempest; I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms.\nFarewell.\"\n\nHe looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head.\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"withdraw a little and let me say my prayer, I\nbeseech you. You, also, stand aside,\" he said to the masked man. \"It is\nonly for a moment and I know that I belong to you; but remember that you\nare not to strike till I give the signal.\"\n\nThen he knelt down, made the sign of the cross, and lowering his face\nto the planks, as if he would have kissed them, said in a low tone, in\nFrench, \"Comte de la Fere, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" he answered, trembling.\n\n\"Faithful friend, noble heart!\" said the king, \"I should not have been\nrescued. I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God; last of\nall I speak to you. To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have\nlost the throne and my children their inheritance. A million in gold\nremains; it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle Keep. You only know\nthat this money exists. Make use of it, then, whenever you think it will\nbe most useful, for my eldest son's welfare. And now, farewell.\"\n\n\"Farewell, saintly, martyred majesty,\" lisped Athos, chilled with\nterror.\n\nA moment's silence ensued and then, in a full, sonorous voice, the king\nexclaimed: \"Remember!\"\n\nHe had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold\nand where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow. He\nreeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a\ncrimson cataract.\n\nAthos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or\nstunned. At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the\nblood of the martyred king. Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he\nleaped down, crept from behind the drapery, glided between two horses,\nmingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn.\n\nHaving gained his room he raised his hand to his face, and observing\nthat his fingers were covered with the monarch's blood, fell down\ninsensible.\n\n\n\n\n67. The Man in the Mask.\n\n\n\nThe snow was falling thick and icy. Aramis was the next to come in and\nto discover Athos almost insensible. But at the first words he uttered\nthe comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk.\n\n\"Well,\" said Aramis, \"beaten by fate!\"\n\n\"Beaten!\" said Athos. \"Noble and unhappy king!\"\n\n\"Are you wounded?\" cried Aramis.\n\n\"No, this is his blood.\"\n\n\"Where were you, then?\"\n\n\"Where you left me--under the scaffold.\"\n\n\"Did you see it all?\"\n\n\"No, but I heard all. God preserve me from another such hour as I have\njust passed.\"\n\n\"Then you know that I did not leave him?\"\n\n\"I heard your voice up to the last moment.\"\n\n\"Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand; he\ndesired they should be returned to the queen.\"\n\n\"Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in,\" replied Athos, drawing\nfrom his pocket the one he had steeped in the king's blood.\n\n\"And what,\" he continued, \"has been done with the poor body?\"\n\n\"By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it. The doctors\nare embalming the corpse, and when it is ready it will be placed in a\nlighted chapel.\"\n\n\"Mockery,\" muttered Athos, savagely; \"royal honors to one whom they have\nmurdered!\"\n\n\"Well, cheer up!\" said a loud voice from the staircase, which Porthos\nhad just mounted. \"We are all mortal, my poor friends.\"\n\n\"You are late, my dear Porthos.\"\n\n\"Yes, there were some people on the way who delayed me. The wretches\nwere dancing. I took one of them by the throat and three-quarters\nthrottled him. Just then a patrol rode up. Luckily the man I had had\nmost to do with was some minutes before he could speak, so I took\nadvantage of his silence to walk off.\"\n\n\"Have you seen D'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him again.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Athos, satirically, \"I saw him. He was in the front row of\nthe crowd, admirably placed for seeing; and as on the whole the sight\nwas curious, he probably wished to stay to the end.\"\n\n\"Ah Comte de la Fere,\" said a calm voice, though hoarse with running,\n\"is it your habit to calumniate the absent?\"\n\nThis reproof stung Athos to the heart, but as the impression produced\nby seeing D'Artagnan foremost in a coarse, ferocious crowd had been very\nstrong, he contented himself with replying:\n\n\"I am not calumniating you, my friend. They were anxious about you here;\nI simply told them where you were. You didn't know King Charles; to you\nhe was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him.\"\n\nSo saying, he stretched out his hand, but the other pretended not to see\nit and he let it drop again slowly by his side.\n\n\"Ugh! I am tired,\" cried D'Artagnan, sitting down.\n\n\"Drink a glass of port,\" said Aramis; \"it will refresh you.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us drink,\" said Athos, anxious to make it up by hobnobbing\nwith D'Artagnan, \"let us drink and get away from this hateful country.\nThe felucca is waiting for us, you know; let us leave to-night, we have\nnothing more to do here.\"\n\n\"You are in a hurry, sir count,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"But what would you have us to do here, now that the king is dead?\"\n\n\"Go, sir count,\" replied D'Artagnan, carelessly; \"you see nothing\nto keep you a little longer in England? Well, for my part, I, a\nbloodthirsty ruffian, who can go and stand close to a scaffold, in order\nto have a better view of the king's execution--I remain.\"\n\nAthos turned pale. Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in\nhis heart.\n\n\"Ah! you remain in London?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Yes. And you?\"\n\n\"Hang it!\" said Porthos, a little perplexed between the two, \"I suppose,\nas I came with you, I must go away with you. I can't leave you alone in\nthis abominable country.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my worthy friend. So I have a little adventure to propose to\nyou when the count is gone. I want to find out who was the man in the\nmask, who so obligingly offered to cut the king's throat.\"\n\n\"A man in a mask?\" cried Athos. \"You did not let the executioner escape,\nthen?\"\n\n\"The executioner is still in the cellar, where, I presume, he has had an\ninterview with mine host's bottles. But you remind me. Mousqueton!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered a voice from the depths of the earth.\n\n\"Let out your prisoner. All is over.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Athos, \"who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand\nagainst his king?\"\n\n\"An amateur headsman,\" replied Aramis, \"who however, does not handle the\naxe amiss.\"\n\n\"Did you not see his face?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"He wore a mask.\"\n\n\"But you, Aramis, who were close to him?\"\n\n\"I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask.\"\n\n\"Then it must be a man of a certain age.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, \"that matters little. When one puts on a mask, it\nis not difficult to wear a beard under it.\"\n\n\"I am sorry I did not follow him,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Well, my dear Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that's the very thing it came\ninto my head to do.\"\n\nAthos understood all now.\n\n\"Pardon me, D'Artagnan,\" he said. \"I have distrusted God; I could the\nmore easily distrust you. Pardon me, my friend.\"\n\n\"We will see about that presently,\" said D'Artagnan, with a slight\nsmile.\n\n\"Well, then?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well, while I was watching--not the king, as monsieur le comte thinks,\nfor I know what it is to see a man led to death, and though I ought to\nbe accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill--while I was watching\nthe masked executioner, the idea came to me, as I said, to find out who\nhe was. Now, as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest\nand to depend on one another for assistance, as one calls his other hand\nto aid the first, I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was\nthere; for I had seen you, Aramis, with the king, and you, count, I\nknew would be under the scaffold, and for that reason I forgive you,\" he\nadded, offering Athos his hand, \"for you must have suffered much. I\nwas looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been\nbroken, but which, for better or worse, had been patched with plaster\nand with black silk. 'Humph!' thought I, 'that looks like my handiwork;\nI fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other.' And, in fact,\nit was that unfortunate Scotchman, Parry's brother, you know, on whom\nGroslow amused himself by trying his strength. Well, this man was making\nsigns to another at my left, and turning around I recognized the\nhonest Grimaud. 'Oh!' said I to him. Grimaud turned round with a jerk,\nrecognized me, and pointed to the man in the mask. 'Eh!' said he,\nwhich meant, 'Do you see him?' 'Parbleu!' I answered, and we perfectly\nunderstood one another. Well, everything was finished as you know. The\nmob dispersed. I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman, and we all\nthree retired into a corner of the square. I saw the executioner return\ninto the king's room, change his clothes, put on a black hat and a\nlarge cloak and disappear. Five minutes later he came down the grand\nstaircase.\"\n\n\"You followed him?\" cried Athos.\n\n\"I should think so, but not without difficulty. Every few minutes he\nturned around, and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves. I might have\ngone up to him and killed him. But I am not selfish, and I thought it\nmight console you all a little to have a share in the matter. So we\nfollowed him through the lowest streets in the city, and in half an\nhour's time he stopped before a little isolated house. Grimaud drew out\na pistol. 'Eh?' said he, showing it. I held back his arm. The man in the\nmask stopped before a low door and drew out a key; but before he placed\nit in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed. Grimaud\nand I got behind a tree, and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide\nhimself, threw himself on his face in the road. Next moment the door\nopened and the man disappeared.\"\n\n\"The scoundrel!\" said Aramis. \"While you have been returning hither he\nwill have escaped and we shall never find him.\"\n\n\"Come, now, Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you must be taking me for some\none else.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Athos, \"in your absence----\"\n\n\"Well, in my absence haven't I put in my place Grimaud and the\nScotchman? Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined\nthe house on all sides. At one of the doors, that by which he had\nentered, I placed our Scotchman, making a sign to him to follow the man\nwherever he might go, if he came out again. Then going around the house\nI placed Grimaud at the other exit, and here I am. Our game is beaten\nup. Now for the tally-ho.\"\n\nAthos threw himself into D'Artagnan's arms.\n\n\"Friend,\" he said, \"you have been too good in pardoning me; I was wrong,\na hundred times wrong. I ought to have known you better by this time;\nbut we are all possessed of a malignant spirit, which bids us doubt.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Porthos. \"Don't you think the executioner might be Master\nCromwell, who, to make sure of this affair, undertook it himself?\"\n\n\"Ah! just so. Cromwell is stout and short, and this man thin and lanky,\nrather tall than otherwise.\"\n\n\"Some condemned soldier, perhaps,\" suggested Athos, \"whom they have\npardoned at the price of regicide.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"it was not the measured step of a foot\nsoldier, nor was it the gait of a horseman. If I am not mistaken we have\nto do with a gentleman.\"\n\n\"A gentleman!\" exclaimed Athos. \"Impossible! It would be a dishonor to\nall the nobility.\"\n\n\"Fine sport, by Jove!\" cried Porthos, with a laugh that shook the\nwindows. \"Fine sport!\"\n\n\"Are you still bent on departure, Athos?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, I remain,\" replied Athos, with a threatening gesture that promised\nno good to whomsoever it was addressed.\n\n\"Swords, then!\" cried Aramis, \"swords! let us not lose a moment.\"\n\nThe four friends resumed their own clothes, girded on their swords,\nordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange\neverything for immediate departure, and wrapped in their large cloaks\nleft in search of their game.\n\nThe night was dark, snow was falling, the streets were silent and\ndeserted. D'Artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and\nnarrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in\nquestion. For a moment D'Artagnan thought that Parry's brother had\ndisappeared; but he was mistaken. The robust Scotchman, accustomed to\nthe snows of his native hills, had stretched himself against a post, and\nlike a fallen statue, insensible to the inclemency of the weather, had\nallowed the snow to cover him. He rose, however, as they approached.\n\n\"Come,\" said Athos, \"here's another good servant. Really, honest men are\nnot so scarce as I thought.\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman. I believe the\nfellow is here on his own account, for I have heard that these gentlemen\nborn beyond the Tweed are very vindictive. I should not like to be\nGroslow, if he meets him.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Athos, to the man, in English.\n\n\"No one has come out,\" he replied.\n\n\"Then, Porthos and Aramis, will you remain with this man while we go\naround to Grimaud?\"\n\nGrimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow,\nand as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle.\n\n\"Soho!\" cried Athos.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"Well, has anybody come out?\"\n\n\"No, but somebody has gone in.\"\n\n\"A man or a woman?\"\n\n\"A man.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said D'Artagnan, \"there are two of them, then!\"\n\n\"I wish there were four,\" said Athos; \"the two parties would then be\nequal.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there are four,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Other men may have entered before them and waited for them.\"\n\n\"We can find out,\" said Grimaud. At the same time he pointed to a\nwindow, through the shutters of which a faint light streamed.\n\n\"That is true,\" said D'Artagnan, \"let us call the others.\"\n\nThey returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\"Have you seen anything?\" they asked.\n\n\"No, but we are going to,\" replied D'Artagnan, pointing to Grimaud, who\nhad already climbed some five or six feet from the ground.\n\nAll four came up together. Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and\nsucceeded at last in catching hold of a hook, which served to keep one\nof the shutters back when opened. Then resting his foot on a small ledge\nhe made a sign to show all was right.\n\n\"Well?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\nGrimaud showed his closed hand, with two fingers spread out.\n\n\"Speak,\" said Athos; \"we cannot see your signs. How many are there?\"\n\n\"Two. One opposite to me, the other with his back to me.\"\n\n\"Good. And the man opposite to you is----\n\n\"The man I saw go in.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I thought I recognized him, and was not mistaken. Short and stout.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" they all asked together in a low tone.\n\n\"General Oliver Cromwell.\"\n\nThe four friends looked at one another.\n\n\"And the other?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Thin and lanky.\"\n\n\"The executioner,\" said D'Artagnan and Aramis at the same time.\n\n\"I can see nothing but his back,\" resumed Grimaud. \"But wait. He is\nmoving; and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to see. Ah----\"\n\nAnd as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a\ngroan.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" they all asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Grimaud, with his hair standing on end.\n\n\"The thin, spare man?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The executioner, in short?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is it?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"He--he--is----\" murmured Grimaud, pale as a ghost and seizing his\nmaster's hand.\n\n\"Who? He?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Mordaunt,\" replied Grimaud.\n\nD'Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy.\n\nAthos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow.\n\n\"Fatality!\" he muttered.\n\n\n\n\n68. Cromwell's House.\n\n\n\nIt was, in fact, Mordaunt whom D'Artagnan had followed, without knowing\nit. On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard,\nthen, mounting a staircase, had opened a door, and in a room lighted\nby a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a\ndesk.\n\nThis man was Cromwell.\n\nCromwell had two or three of these retreats in London, unknown except to\nthe most intimate of his friends. Mordaunt was among these.\n\n\"It is you, Mordaunt,\" he said. \"You are late.\"\n\n\"General, I wished to see the ceremony to the end, which delayed me.\"\n\n\"Ah! I scarcely thought you were so curious as that.\"\n\n\"I am always curious to see the downfall of your honor's enemies, and\nhe was not among the least of them. But you, general, were you not at\nWhitehall?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cromwell.\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Have you had any account of it?\"\n\n\"None. I have been here since the morning. I only know that there was a\nconspiracy to rescue the king.\"\n\n\"Ah, you knew that?\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"It matters little. Four men, disguised as workmen, were to get the king\nout of prison and take him to Greenwich, where a vessel was waiting.\"\n\n\"And knowing all that, your honor remained here, far from the city,\ntranquil and inactive.\"\n\n\"Tranquil, yes,\" replied Cromwell. \"But who told you I was inactive?\"\n\n\"But--if the plot had succeeded?\"\n\n\"I wished it to do so.\"\n\n\"I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles I. as a\nmisfortune necessary to the welfare of England.\"\n\n\"Yes, his death; but it would have been more seemly not upon the\nscaffold.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Mordaunt.\n\nCromwell smiled. \"Because it could have been said that I had had him\ncondemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity.\"\n\n\"But if he had escaped?\"\n\n\"Impossible; my precautions were taken.\"\n\n\"And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him?\"\n\n\"The four Frenchmen, of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband\nand two by Mazarin to me.\"\n\n\"And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done?\"\n\n\"It is possible. But he will not avow it.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because they failed.\"\n\n\"Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of\nfighting for Charles I. Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against\nEngland will your honor give me all four of them?\"\n\n\"Take them,\" said Cromwell.\n\nMordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity.\n\n\"Did the people shout at all?\" Cromwell asked.\n\n\"Very little, except 'Long live Cromwell!'\"\n\n\"Where were you placed?\"\n\nMordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general's face if this\nwas simply a useless question, or whether he knew everything. But\nhis piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of\nCromwell's.\n\n\"I was so situated as to hear and see everything,\" he answered.\n\nIt was now Cromwell's turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt, and Mordaunt to\nmake himself impenetrable.\n\n\"It appears,\" said Cromwell, \"that this improvised executioner did his\nduty remarkably well. The blow, so they tell me at least, was struck\nwith a master's hand.\"\n\nMordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed\naccount, and he was now quite convinced that the general had been\npresent at the execution, hidden behind some screen or curtain.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Mordaunt, with a calm voice and immovable countenance,\n\"a single blow sufficed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was some one in that occupation,\" said Cromwell.\n\n\"Do you think so, sir? He did not look like an executioner.\"\n\n\"And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that\nhorrible office?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Mordaunt, \"it might have been some personal enemy of the\nking, who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way.\nPerhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the\nfallen king, and who, learning that the king was about to flee and\nescape him, threw himself in the way, with a mask on his face and an axe\nin his hand, not as substitute for the executioner, but as an ambassador\nof Fate.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action?\"\n\n\"It is not for me to judge. It rests between his conscience and his\nGod.\"\n\n\"But if your honor knew this man?\"\n\n\"I neither know nor wish to know him. Provided Charles is dead, it is\nthe axe, not the man, we must thank.\"\n\n\"And yet, without the man, the king would have been rescued.\"\n\nCromwell smiled.\n\n\"They would have carried him to Greenwich,\" he said, \"and put him on\nboard a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold. Once out\nto sea, you are too good a politician not to understand the rest,\nMordaunt.\"\n\n\"Yes, they would have all been blown up.\"\n\n\"Just so. The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do.\nMen would have said that the king had escaped human justice and\nbeen overtaken by God's. You see now why I did not care to know your\ngentleman in the mask; for really, in spite of his excellent intentions,\nI could not thank him for what he has done.\"\n\nMordaunt bowed humbly. \"Sir,\" he said, \"you are a profound thinker and\nyour plan was sublime.\"\n\n\"Say absurd, since it has become useless. The only sublime ideas in\npolitics are those which bear fruit. So to-night, Mordaunt, go to\nGreenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca Lightning. Show him\na white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to\ndisembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal, unless, indeed----\"\n\n\"Unless?\" said Mordaunt, whose face was lighted by a savage joy as\nCromwell spoke:\n\n\"This skiff might be of use to you for personal projects.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord, my lord!\"\n\n\"That title,\" said Cromwell, laughing, \"is all very well here, but take\ncare a word like that does not escape your lips in public.\"\n\n\"But your honor will soon be called so generally.\"\n\n\"I hope so, at least,\" said Cromwell, rising and putting on his cloak.\n\n\"You are going, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Cromwell. \"I slept here last night and the night before, and\nyou know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mordaunt, \"your honor gives me my liberty for to-night?\"\n\n\"And even for all day to-morrow, if you want it. Since last evening,\" he\nadded, smiling, \"you have done enough in my service, and if you have any\npersonal matters to settle it is just that I should give you time.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; it will be well employed, I hope.\"\n\nCromwell turned as he was going.\n\n\"Are you armed?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have my sword.\"\n\n\"And no one waiting for you outside?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you had better come with me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, but the way by the subterranean passage would take too\nmuch time and I have none to lose.\"\n\nCromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well\nconcealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have\ndiscovered it. It closed after him with a spring. This door communicated\nwith a subterranean passage, leading under the street to a grotto in\nthe garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future\nProtector.\n\nIt was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated\ntogether.\n\nD'Artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise.\n\n\"Mordaunt,\" he cried. \"Ah! by Heaven! it is God Himself who sent us\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, \"let us break the door in and fall upon him.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"no noise. Now, Grimaud, you come here, climb\nup to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he\nis preparing to go out or go to bed. If he comes out we shall catch him.\nIf he stays in we will break in the window. It is easier and less noisy\nthan the door.\"\n\nGrimaud began to scale the wall again.\n\n\"Keep guard at the other door, Athos and Aramis. Porthos and I will stay\nhere.\"\n\nThe friends obeyed.\n\n\"He is alone,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"We did not see his companion come out.\"\n\n\"He may have gone by the other door.\"\n\n\"What is he doing?\"\n\n\"Putting on his cloak and gloves.\"\n\n\"He's ours,\" muttered D'Artagnan.\n\nPorthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard.\n\n\"Put it up again, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan. \"We must proceed in an\norderly manner.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Grimaud, \"he is coming out. He has put out the lamp, I can\nsee nothing now.\"\n\n\"Get down then and quickly.\"\n\nGrimaud leaped down. The snow deadened the noise of his fall.\n\n\"Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and\nclap their hands if they catch him. We will do the same.\"\n\nThe next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold,\nface to face with D'Artagnan. Porthos clapped his hands and the other\ntwo came running around. Mordaunt was livid, but he uttered no cry nor\ncalled for assistance. D'Artagnan quietly pushed him in again, and by\nthe light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward\none by one, keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunt's hands, who,\nhowever, knowing that it was useless, attempted no resistance. At\nlast they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before\nMordaunt had been talking to Cromwell.\n\nPorthos came up behind, and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit\nthat in the room. Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door\nbehind them.\n\n\"Oblige me by taking a seat,\" said D'Artagnan, pushing a chair toward\nMordaunt, who sat down, pale but calm. Aramis, Porthos and D'Artagnan\ndrew their chairs near him. Athos alone kept away and sat in the\nfurthest corner of the room, as if determined to be merely a spectator\nof the proceedings. He seemed to be quite overcome. Porthos rubbed his\nhands in feverish impatience. Aramis bit his lips till the blood came.\n\nD'Artagnan alone was calm, at least in appearance.\n\n\"Monsieur Mordaunt,\" he said, \"since, after running after one another\nso long, chance has at last brought us together, let us have a little\nconversation, if you please.\"\n\n\n\n\n69. Conversational.\n\n\n\nThough Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted\nthe stairs in such utter confusion, when once seated he recovered\nhimself, as it were, and prepared to seize any possible opportunity\nof escape. His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he\ninstinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand.\n\nD'Artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing.\nAramis muttered to himself, \"We shall hear nothing but the usual\ncommonplace things.\"\n\nPorthos sucked his mustache, muttering, \"A good deal of ceremony\nto-night about crushing an adder.\" Athos shrunk into his corner, pale\nand motionless as a bas-relief.\n\nThe silence, however, could not last forever. So D'Artagnan began:\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, with desperate politeness, \"it seems to me that you\nchange your costume almost as rapidly as I have seen the Italian mummers\ndo, whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he\ndoubtless took you to see during your travels in France.\"\n\nMordaunt did not reply.\n\n\"Just now,\" D'Artagnan continued, \"you were disguised--I mean to say,\nattired--as a murderer, and now----\"\n\n\"And now I look very much like a man who is going to be murdered.\"\n\n\"Oh! sir,\" said D'Artagnan, \"how can you talk like that when you are in\nthe company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side?\"\n\n\"No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and\ndaggers.\"\n\n\"Well, that is scarcely the question. I had the honor of asking you why\nyou altered your costume. The mask and beard became you very well, and\nas to the axe, I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this\nmoment. Why, then, have you laid it aside?\"\n\n\"Because, remembering the scene at Armentieres, I thought I should find\nfour axes for one, as I was to meet four executioners.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied D'Artagnan, in the calmest manner possible, \"you are\nvery young; I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks. What\ntook place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present\noccasion. We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword\nand fight us.\"\n\n\"Aha! It is a duel, then?\" cried Mordaunt, as if disposed to reply at\nonce to the provocation.\n\nPorthos rose, always ready for this kind of adventure.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Do not let us do things in a hurry. We\nwill arrange the matter rather better. Confess, Monsieur Mordaunt, that\nyou are anxious to kill some of us.\"\n\n\"All,\" replied Mordaunt.\n\n\"Then, my dear sir; I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind\nwishes and will be delighted to kill you also. Of course they will do so\nas honorable gentlemen, and the best proof I can furnish is this----\"\n\nSo saying, he threw his hat on the ground, pushed back his chair to the\nwall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace.\n\n\"At your service, sir,\" he continued. \"My sword is shorter than yours,\nit's true, but, bah! I think the arm will make up for the sword.\"\n\n\"Halt!\" cried Porthos coming forward. \"I begin, and without any\nrhetoric.\"\n\n\"Allow me, Porthos,\" said Aramis.\n\nAthos did not move. He might have been taken for a statue. Even his\nbreathing seemed to be arrested.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you shall have your turn. Monsieur\nMordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward. You can\nsee it in his eye. So pray keep your places, like Athos, whose calmness\nis entirely laudable. Besides, we will have no words about it. I have\nparticular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will\nbegin.\"\n\nPorthos and Aramis drew back, disappointed, and drawing his sword\nD'Artagnan turned to his adversary:\n\n\"Sir, I am waiting for you.\"\n\n\"And for my part, gentlemen, I admire you. You are disputing which shall\nfight me first, but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the\nmatter. I hate you all, but not equally. I hope to kill all four of you,\nbut I am more likely to kill the first than the second, the second than\nthe third, and the third than the last. I claim, then, the right to\nchoose my opponent. If you refuse this right you may kill me, but I\nshall not fight.\"\n\n\"It is but fair,\" said Porthos and Aramis, hoping he would choose one of\nthem.\n\nAthos and D'Artagnan said nothing, but their silence seemed to imply\nconsent.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Mordaunt, \"I choose for my adversary the man who,\nnot thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere, calls himself\nAthos.\"\n\nAthos sprang up, but after an instant of motionless silence he said, to\nthe astonishment of his friends, \"Monsieur Mordaunt, a duel between us\nis impossible. Submit this honour to somebody else.\" And he sat down.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mordaunt, with a sneer, \"there's one who is afraid.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, bounding toward him, \"who says that\nAthos is afraid?\"\n\n\"Let him have his say, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, with a smile of sadness\nand contempt.\n\n\"Is it your decision, Athos?\" resumed the Gascon.\n\n\"Irrevocably.\"\n\n\"You hear, sir,\" said D'Artagnan, turning to Mordaunt. \"The Comte de la\nFere will not do you the honor of fighting with you. Choose one of us to\nreplace the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"As long as I don't fight with him it is the same to me with whom I\nfight. Put your names into a hat and draw lots.\"\n\n\"A good idea,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"At least that will conciliate us all,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"I should never have thought of that,\" said Porthos, \"and yet it is very\nsimple.\"\n\n\"Come, Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan, \"write this for us in those neat little\ncharacters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this\ngentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\nMordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing. He stood with\nhis arms folded, apparently as calm as any man could be in such\ncircumstances. If he had not courage he had what is very like it,\nnamely, pride.\n\nAramis went to Cromwell's desk, tore off three bits of paper of equal\nsize, wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two\ncompanions, and presented them open to Mordaunt, who by a movement of\nhis head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis. He\nthen rolled them separately and put them in a hat, which he handed to\nMordaunt.\n\nMordaunt put his hand into the hat, took out one of the three papers and\ndisdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it.\n\n\"Ah! serpent,\" muttered D'Artagnan, \"I would give my chance of a\ncaptaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name.\"\n\nAramis opened the paper, and in a voice trembling with hate and\nvengeance read \"D'Artagnan.\"\n\nThe Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt:\n\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"you have no objection to make.\"\n\n\"None, whatever,\" replied the other, drawing his sword and resting the\npoint on his boot.\n\nThe moment that D'Artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his\nman would not escape him, he recovered his usual tranquillity. He turned\nup his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor,\nbut did not fail, however, to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him\nin a singular manner.\n\n\"Are you ready, sir?\" he said at last.\n\n\"I was waiting for you, sir,\" said Mordaunt, raising his head and\ncasting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the Gascon, \"take care of yourself, for I am not a\nbad hand at the rapier.\"\n\n\"Nor I either.\"\n\n\"So much the better; that sets my mind at rest. Defend yourself.\"\n\n\"One minute,\" said the young man. \"Give me your word, gentlemen, that\nyou will not attack me otherwise than one after the other.\"\n\n\"Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that, my little\nviper?\"\n\n\"No, but to set my mind at rest, as you observed just now.\"\n\n\"It is for something else than that, I imagine,\" muttered D'Artagnan,\nshaking his head doubtfully.\n\n\"On the honor of gentlemen,\" said Aramis and Porthos.\n\n\"In that case, gentlemen, have the kindness to retire into the corners,\nso as to give us ample room. We shall require it.\"\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we must not leave this person the\nslightest pretext for behaving badly, which, with all due respect, I\nfancy he is anxious still to do.\"\n\nThis new attack made no impression on Mordaunt. The space was cleared,\nthe two lamps placed on Cromwell's desk, in order that the combatants\nmight have as much light as possible; and the swords crossed.\n\nD'Artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent. He made\na rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt parried.\n\n\"Aha!\" he cried with a smile of satisfaction.\n\nAnd without losing a minute, thinking he saw an opening, he thrust his\nright in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that\nthe point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring.\n\nThis time it was Mordaunt who smiled.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you have a wicked smile. It must have been\nthe devil who taught it you, was it not?\"\n\nMordaunt replied by trying his opponent's weapon with an amount of\nstrength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently\nso feeble; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt\nhad just achieved, he succeeded in meeting his sword, which slid along\nhis own without touching his chest.\n\nMordaunt rapidly sprang back a step.\n\n\"Ah! you lose ground, you are turning? Well, as you please, I even gain\nsomething by it, for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours. You\nhave no idea what a false look you have, particularly when you are\nafraid. Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever\nshown you--a frank and honorable countenance.\"\n\nTo this flow of words, not perhaps in the best taste, but characteristic\nof D'Artagnan, whose principal object was to divert his opponent's\nattention, Mordaunt did not reply, but continuing to turn around he\nsucceeded in changing places with D'Artagnan.\n\nHe smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the\nGascon anxious.\n\n\"Come, come,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"we must finish with this,\" and in\nhis turn he pressed Mordaunt hard, who continued to lose ground, but\nevidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a\nmoment. However, as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go\non like that forever, Mordaunt's foot at last touched the wall, against\nwhich he rested his left hand.\n\n\"Ah, this time you cannot lose ground, my fine friend!\" exclaimed\nD'Artagnan. \"Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?\nNo. Well, then, you shall see it now.\"\n\nIn a second D'Artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt, all\nof which touched, but only pricked him. The three friends looked on,\npanting and astonished. At last D'Artagnan, having got up too close,\nstepped back to prepare a fourth thrust, but the moment when, after a\nfine, quick feint, he was attacking as sharply as lightning, the wall\nseemed to give way, Mordaunt disappeared through the opening, and\nD'Artagnan's blade, caught between the panels, shivered like a sword of\nglass. D'Artagnan sprang back; the wall had closed again.\n\nMordaunt, in fact, while defending himself, had manoeuvred so as to\nreach the secret door by which Cromwell had left, had felt for the knob\nwith his left hand, pressed it and disappeared.\n\nThe Gascon uttered a furious imprecation, which was answered by a wild\nlaugh on the other side of the iron panel.\n\n\"Help me, gentlemen,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"we must break in this door.\"\n\n\"It is the devil in person!\" said Aramis, hastening forward.\n\n\"He escapes us,\" growled Porthos, pushing his huge shoulder against the\nhinges, but in vain. \"'Sblood! he escapes us.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" muttered Athos.\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said D'Artagnan, wasting his strength in useless\nefforts. \"Zounds, I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around\nthe room. I thought he was up to something.\"\n\n\"It's a misfortune, to which his friend, the devil, treats us,\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"It's a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven,\" said Athos, evidently\nmuch relieved.\n\n\"Really!\" said D'Artagnan, abandoning the attempt to burst open the\npanel after several ineffectual attempts, \"Athos, I cannot imagine how\nyou can talk to us in that way. You cannot understand the position\nwe are in. In this kind of game, not to kill is to let one's self be\nkilled. This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron-sided\nbeasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place. Come, come, we\nmust be off. If we stay here five minutes more there's an end of us.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right.\"\n\n\"But where shall we go?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"To the hotel, to be sure, to get our baggage and horses; and from\nthere, if it please God, to France, where, at least, I understand the\narchitecture of the houses.\"\n\nSo, suiting the action to the word, D'Artagnan thrust the remnant of\nhis sword into its scabbard, picked up his hat and ran down the stairs,\nfollowed by the others.\n\n\n\n\n70. The Skiff \"Lightning.\"\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan had judged correctly; Mordaunt felt that he had no time to\nlose, and he lost none. He knew the rapidity of decision and action that\ncharacterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that.\nThis time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them.\n\nAfter closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the\nsubterranean passage, sheathing on the way his now useless sword, and\nthus reached the neighboring house, where he paused to examine himself\nand to take breath.\n\n\"Good!\" he said, \"nothing, almost nothing--scratches, nothing more; two\nin the arm and one in the breast. The wounds that I make are better than\nthat--witness the executioner of Bethune, my uncle and King Charles.\nNow, not a second to lose, for a second lost will perhaps save them.\nThey must die--die all together--killed at one stroke by the thunder\nof men in default of God's. They must disappear, broken, scattered,\nannihilated. I will run, then, till my legs no longer serve, till my\nheart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do.\"\n\nMordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks,\nabout a quarter of a league distant. He made that quarter of a league\nin four or five minutes. Arrived at the barracks he made himself known,\ntook the best horse in the stables, mounted and gained the high road. A\nquarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich.\n\n\"There is the port,\" he murmured. \"That dark point yonder is the Isle of\nDogs. Good! I am half an hour in advance of them, an hour, perhaps. Fool\nthat I was! I have almost killed myself by my needless haste. Now,\" he\nadded, rising in the stirrups and looking about him, \"which, I wonder,\nis the Lightning?\"\n\nAt this moment, as if in reply to his words, a man lying on a coil\nof cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him. Mordaunt drew a\nhandkerchief from his pocket, and tying a knot at each corner--the\nsignal agreed upon--waved it in the air and the man came up to him. He\nwas wrapped in a large rough cape, which concealed his form and partly\nhis face.\n\n\"Do you wish to go on the water, sir?\" said the sailor.\n\n\"Yes, just so. Along the Isle of Dogs.\"\n\n\"And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another. You\nwould like one that sails as rapidly as----\"\n\n\"Lightning,\" interrupted Mordaunt.\n\n\"Then mine is the boat you want, sir. I'm your man.\"\n\n\"I begin to think so, particularly if you have not forgotten a certain\nsignal.\"\n\n\"Here it is, sir,\" and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief,\ntied at each corner.\n\n\"Good, quite right!\" cried Mordaunt, springing off his horse. \"There's\nnot a moment to lose; now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct\nme to your vessel.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked the sailor, \"where are your companions? I thought there\nwere four of you.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, sir. I'm not the man you take me for; you are in Captain\nRogers's post, are you not? under orders from General Cromwell. Mine,\nalso, are from him!\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I recognize you; you are Captain Mordaunt.\"\n\nMordaunt was startled.\n\n\"Oh, fear nothing,\" said the skipper, showing his face. \"I am a friend.\"\n\n\"Captain Groslow!\" cried Mordaunt.\n\n\"Himself. The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval\nofficer and he gave me the command of this expedition. Is there anything\nnew in the wind?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I thought, perhaps, that the king's death----\"\n\n\"Has only hastened their flight; in ten minutes they will perhaps be\nhere.\"\n\n\"What have you come for, then?\"\n\n\"To embark with you.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! the general doubted my fidelity?\"\n\n\"No, but I wish to have a share in my revenge. Haven't you some one who\nwill relieve me of my horse?\"\n\nGroslow whistled and a sailor appeared.\n\n\"Patrick,\" said Groslow, \"take this horse to the stables of the nearest\ninn. If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an\nIrish gentleman.\"\n\nThe sailor departed without reply.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mordaunt, \"are you not afraid that they will recognize you?\"\n\n\"There is no danger, dressed as I am in this pilot coat, on a night as\ndark as this. Besides even you didn't recognize me; they will be much\nless likely to.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Mordaunt, \"and they will be far from thinking of\nyou. Everything is ready, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The cargo on board?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Five full casks?\"\n\n\"And fifty empty ones.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"We are carrying port wine to Anvers.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Now take me aboard and return to your post, for they will\nsoon be here.\"\n\n\"I am ready.\"\n\n\"It is important that none of your crew should see me.\"\n\n\"I have but one man on board, and I am as sure of him as I am of myself.\nBesides, he doesn't know you; like his mates he is ready to obey our\norders knowing nothing of our plan.\"\n\n\"Very well; let us go.\"\n\nThey then went down to the Thames. A boat was fastened to the shore by a\nchain fixed to a stake. Groslow jumped in, followed by Mordaunt, and in\nfive minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then\ncrowded the outskirts of London; and Mordaunt could discern the little\nvessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs. When they reached\nthe side of this felucca, Mordaunt, dexterous in his eagerness for\nvengeance, seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a\ncoolness and agility very rare among landsmen. He went with Groslow to\nthe captain's berth, a sort of temporary cabin of planks, for the chief\napartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers, who\nwere to be accommodated at the other end of the boat.\n\n\"They will have nothing to do, then at this end?\" said Mordaunt.\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"That's a capital arrangement. Return to Greenwich and bring them here.\nI shall hide myself in your cabin. You have a longboat?\"\n\n\"That in which we came.\"\n\n\"It appeared light and well constructed.\"\n\n\"Quite a canoe.\"\n\n\"Fasten it to the poop with a rope; put the oars into it, so that it may\nfollow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the\ncord. Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen; should\nthe night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something\nto console themselves with.\"\n\n\"Consider all this done. Do you wish to see the powder-room?\"\n\n\"No. When you return I will set the fuse myself, but be careful to\nconceal your face, so that you cannot be recognized by them.\"\n\n\"Never fear.\"\n\n\"There's ten o'clock striking at Greenwich.\"\n\nGroslow, then, having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the\nwatch with more than usual vigilance, went down into the longboat and\nsoon reached Greenwich. The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted,\nas he approached it; but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise\nof horses galloping upon the paved road.\n\nThese horsemen were our friends, or rather, an avant garde, composed of\nD'Artagnan and Athos. As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow\nstood they stopped, as if guessing that he was the man they wanted.\nAthos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner,\nwhilst D'Artagnan, ever cautious, remained on horseback, one hand upon\nhis pistol, leaning forward watchfully.\n\nOn seeing the appointed signal, Groslow, who had at first crept behind\none of the cannon planted on that spot, walked straight up to the\ngentlemen. He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have\nbeen impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark\nas to render precaution superfluous; nevertheless, the keen glance of\nAthos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them.\n\n\"What do you want with us?\" he asked of Groslow.\n\n\"I wish to inform you, my lord,\" replied Groslow, with an Irish accent,\nfeigned of course, \"that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will\nnot find him. He fell down this morning and broke his leg. But I'm his\ncousin; he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him,\nand in his place to conduct, wherever they wished to go, the gentlemen\nwho should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner, like that one\nwhich you hold and one which I have in my pocket.\"\n\nAnd he drew out the handkerchief.\n\n\"Was that all he said?\" inquired Athos.\n\n\"No, my lord; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed\nyou safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in France.\"\n\n\"What do you think of all this?\" said Athos, in a low tone to\nD'Artagnan, after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said\nin English.\n\n\"It seems a likely story to me.\"\n\n\"And to me, too.\"\n\n\"Besides, we can but blow out his brains if he proves false,\" said the\nGascon; \"and you, Athos, you know something of everything and can be our\ncaptain. I dare say you know how to navigate, should he fail us.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, you guess well. My father meant me for the navy and I\nhave some vague notions about navigation.\"\n\n\"You see!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\nThey then summoned their friends, who, with Blaisois, Mousqueton and\nGrimaud, promptly joined them, leaving Parry behind them, who was to\ntake back to London the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys,\nwhich had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him.\nThanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take\naway with them a sum of money which, if not large, was sufficient as a\nprovision against delays and accidents.\n\nParry parted from his friends regretfully; they had proposed his going\nwith them to France, but he had straightway declined.\n\n\"It is very simple,\" Mousqueton had said; \"he is thinking of Groslow.\"\n\nIt was Captain Groslow, the reader will remember, who had broken Parry's\nhead.\n\nD'Artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was\nhabitual with him. He found the wharf too completely deserted, the night\ntoo dark, the captain too accommodating. He had reported to Aramis what\nhad taken place, and Aramis, not less distrustful than he, had increased\nhis suspicions. A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed\nAthos of the Gascon's uneasiness.\n\n\"We have no time now for suspicions,\" said Athos. \"The boat is waiting\nfor us; come.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Aramis, \"what prevents our being distrustful and going\naboard at the same time? We can watch the skipper.\"\n\n\"And if he doesn't go straight I will crush him, that's all.\"\n\n\"Well said, Porthos,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Let us go, then. You first,\nMousqueton,\" and he stopped his friends, directing the valets to go\nfirst, in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat.\n\nThe three valets passed without accident. Athos followed them, then\nPorthos, then Aramis. D'Artagnan went last, still shaking his head.\n\n\"What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?\" said Porthos.\n\"Upon my word you would make Caesar afraid.\"\n\n\"The matter is,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"that I can see upon this pier\nneither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman.\"\n\n\"And you complain of that!\" said Porthos. \"Everything goes as if in\nflowery paths.\"\n\n\"Everything goes too well, Porthos. But no matter; we must trust in\nGod.\"\n\nAs soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the\ntiller and made a sign to one of the sailors, who, boat-hook in hand,\nbegan to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were\ninvolved. The other sailor had already seated himself on the port\nside and was ready to row. As soon as there was room for rowing, his\ncompanion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly.\n\n\"At last we are off!\" exclaimed Porthos.\n\n\"Alas,\" said Athos, \"we depart alone.\"\n\n\"Yes; but all four together and without a scratch; which is a\nconsolation.\"\n\n\"We are not yet at our destination,\" observed the prudent D'Artagnan;\n\"beware of misadventure.\"\n\n\"Ah, my friend!\" cried Porthos, \"like the crows, you always bring bad\nomens. Who could intercept us on such a night as this, pitch dark, when\none does not see more than twenty yards before one?\"\n\n\"Yes, but to-morrow morning----\"\n\n\"To-morrow we shall be at Boulogne.\"\n\n\"I hope so, with all my heart,\" said the Gascon, \"and I confess my\nweakness. Yes, Athos, you may laugh, but as long as we were within\ngunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a\nfrightful discharge of musketry which would crush us.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Porthos, with great wisdom, \"that was impossible, for they\nwould have killed the captain and the sailors.\"\n\n\"Bah! much Monsieur Mordaunt would care. You don't imagine he would\nconsider a little thing like that?\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Porthos, \"I am glad to hear D'Artagnan admit that he\nis afraid.\"\n\n\"I not only confess it, but am proud of it,\" returned the Gascon; \"I'm\nnot such a rhinoceros as you are. Oho! what's that?\"\n\n\"The Lightning,\" answered the captain, \"our felucca.\"\n\n\"So far, so good,\" laughed Athos.\n\nThey went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth\nprepared for them--a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for\nthe whole party; he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving\norders to some one.\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"pray how many men have you on board,\ncaptain?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Explain it, Athos.\"\n\nGroslow, on the question being interpreted, answered, \"Three, without\ncounting myself.\"\n\nD'Artagnan understood, for while replying the captain had raised three\nfingers. \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, \"I begin to be more at my ease, however,\nwhilst you settle yourselves, I shall make the round of the boat.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said Porthos, \"I will see to the supper.\"\n\n\"A very good idea, Porthos,\" said the Gascon. \"Athos lend me Grimaud,\nwho in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little\nEnglish, and can act as my interpreter.\"\n\n\"Go, Grimaud,\" said Athos.\n\nD'Artagnan, finding a lantern on the deck, took it up and with a pistol\nin his hand he said to the captain, in English, \"Come,\" (being, with the\nclassic English oath, the only English words he knew), and so saying he\ndescended to the lower deck.\n\nThis was divided into three compartments--one which was covered by the\nfloor of that room in which Athos, Porthos and Aramis were to pass the\nnight; the second was to serve as the sleeping-room for the servants,\nthe third, under the prow of the ship, was under the temporary cabin in\nwhich Mordaunt was concealed.\n\n\"Oho!\" cried D'Artagnan, as he went down the steps of the hatchway,\npreceded by the lantern, \"what a number of barrels! one would think one\nwas in the cave of Ali Baba. What is there in them?\" he added, putting\nhis lantern on one of the casks.\n\nThe captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again, but controlling\nhimself he answered:\n\n\"Port wine.\"\n\n\"Ah! port wine! 'tis a comfort,\" said the Gascon, \"since we shall not\ndie of thirst. Are they all full?\"\n\nGrimaud translated the question, and Groslow, who was wiping the\nperspiration from off his forehead, answered:\n\n\"Some full, others empty.\"\n\nD'Artagnan struck the barrels with his hand, and having ascertained that\nhe spoke the truth, pushed his lantern, greatly to the captain's alarm,\ninto the interstices between the barrels, and finding that there was\nnothing concealed in them:\n\n\"Come along,\" he said; and he went toward the door of the second\ncompartment.\n\n\"Stop!\" said the Englishman, \"I have the key of that door;\" and he\nopened the door, with a trembling hand, into the second compartment,\nwhere Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing supper.\n\nHere there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed\nrapidly to examine the third compartment.\n\nThis was the room appropriated to the sailors. Two or three hammocks\nhung upon the ceiling, a table and two benches composed the entire\nfurniture. D'Artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the\nwalls, and meeting nothing to suspect, regained by the hatchway the deck\nof the vessel.\n\n\"And this room?\" he asked, pointing to the captain's cabin.\n\n\"That's my room,\" replied Groslow.\n\n\"Open the door.\"\n\nThe captain obeyed. D'Artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held\nthe lantern, put his head in at the half opened door, and seeing that\nthe cabin was nothing better than a shed:\n\n\"Good,\" he said. \"If there is an army on board it is not here that it is\nhidden. Let us see what Porthos has found for supper.\" And thanking the\ncaptain, he regained the state cabin, where his friends were.\n\nPorthos had found nothing, and with him fatigue had prevailed over\nhunger. He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when\nD'Artagnan returned. Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their\neyes, which they half opened when their companion came in again.\n\n\"Well!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"All is well; we may sleep tranquilly.\"\n\nOn this assurance the two friends fell asleep; and D'Artagnan, who was\nvery weary, bade good-night to Grimaud and laid himself down in his\ncloak, with naked sword at his side, in such a manner that his body\nbarricaded the passage, and it should be impossible to enter the room\nwithout upsetting him.\n\n\n\n\n71. Port Wine.\n\n\n\nIn ten minutes the masters slept; not so the servants---hungry, and more\nthirsty than hungry.\n\nBlaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which\nconsisted of a plank and a valise. On a hanging table, which swung to\nand fro with the rolling of the vessel, were a pot of beer and three\nglasses.\n\n\"This cursed rolling!\" said Blaisois. \"I know it will serve me as it did\nwhen we came over.\"\n\n\"And to think,\" said Mousqueton, \"that we have nothing to fight\nseasickness with but barley bread and hop beer. Pah!\"\n\n\"But where is your wicker flask, Monsieur Mousqueton? Have you lost it?\"\nasked Blaisois.\n\n\"No,\" replied Mousqueton, \"Parry kept it. Those devilish Scotchmen are\nalways thirsty. And you, Grimaud,\" he said to his companion, who had\njust come in after his round with D'Artagnan, \"are you thirsty?\"\n\n\"As thirsty as a Scotchman!\" was Grimaud's laconic reply.\n\nAnd he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party, whose\nmoney he managed.\n\n\"Oh, lackadaisy! I'm beginning to feel queer!\" cried Blaisois.\n\n\"If that's the case,\" said Mousqueton, with a learned air, \"take some\nnourishment.\"\n\n\"Do you call that nourishment?\" said Blaisois, pointing to the barley\nbread and pot of beer upon the table.\n\n\"Blaisois,\" replied Mousqueton, \"remember that bread is the true\nnourishment of a Frenchman, who is not always able to get bread, ask\nGrimaud.\"\n\n\"Yes, but beer?\" asked Blaisois sharply, \"is that their true drink?\"\n\n\"As to that,\" answered Mousqueton, puzzled how to get out of the\ndifficulty, \"I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine\nis to the English.\"\n\n\"What! Monsieur Mousqueton! The English--do they dislike wine?\"\n\n\"They hate it.\"\n\n\"But I have seen them drink it.\"\n\n\"As a punishment. For example, an English prince died one day because\nthey had put him into a butt of Malmsey. I heard the Chevalier d'Herblay\nsay so.\"\n\n\"The fool!\" cried Blaisois, \"I wish I had been in his place.\"\n\n\"Thou canst be,\" said Grimaud, writing down his figures.\n\n\"How?\" asked Blaisois, \"I can? Explain yourself.\"\n\nGrimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole.\n\n\"Port,\" he said, extending his hand in the direction of the first\ncompartment examined by D'Artagnan and himself.\n\n\"Eh? eh? ah? Those barrels I saw through the door?\"\n\n\"Port!\" replied Grimaud, beginning a fresh sum.\n\n\"I have heard,\" said Blaisois, \"that port is a very good wine.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" exclaimed Mousqueton, smacking his lips. \"Excellent; there\nis port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux.\"\n\n\"Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle,\" said the honest\nBlaisois.\n\n\"Sell!\" cried Mousqueton, about whom there was a remnant of his ancient\nmarauding character left. \"One may well perceive, young man, that you\nare inexperienced. Why buy what one can take?\"\n\n\"Take!\" said Blaisois; \"covet the goods of your neighbor? That is\nforbidden, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Where forbidden?\" asked Mousqueton.\n\n\"In the commandments of God, or of the church, I don't know which. I\nonly know it says, 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods, nor yet\nhis wife.'\"\n\n\"That is a child's reason, Monsieur Blaisois,\" said Mousqueton in his\nmost patronizing manner. \"Yes, you talk like a child--I repeat the word.\nWhere have you read in the Scriptures, I ask you, that the English are\nyour neighbors?\"\n\n\"Where, that is true,\" said Blaisois; \"at least, I can't now recall it.\"\n\n\"A child's reason--I repeat it,\" continued Mousqueton. \"If you had been\nten years engaged in war, as Grimaud and I have been, my dear Blaisois,\nyou would know the difference there is between the goods of others and\nthe goods of enemies. Now an Englishman is an enemy; this port wine\nbelongs to the English, therefore it belongs to us.\"\n\n\"And our masters?\" asked Blaisois, stupefied by this harangue, delivered\nwith an air of profound sagacity, \"will they be of your opinion?\"\n\nMousqueton smiled disdainfully.\n\n\"I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose\nof these illustrious lords to say, 'Gentlemen, your servant, Mousqueton,\nis thirsty.' What does Monsieur Bracieux care, think you, whether I am\nthirsty or not?\"\n\n\"'Tis a very expensive wine,\" said Blaisois, shaking his head.\n\n\"Were it liquid gold, Monsieur Blaisois, our masters would not deny\nthemselves this wine. Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to\ndrink a tun of port wine, even if obliged to pay a pistole for every\ndrop.\" His manner became more and more lofty every instant; then he\narose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced\nmajestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was. \"Ah!\nlocked!\" he exclaimed; \"these devils of English, how suspicious they\nare!\"\n\n\"Locked!\" said Blaisois; \"ah! the deuce it is; unlucky, for my stomach\nis getting more and more upset.\"\n\n\"Locked!\" repeated Mousqueton.\n\n\"But,\" Blaisois ventured to say, \"I have heard you relate, Monsieur\nMousqueton, that once on a time, at Chantilly, you fed your master and\nyourself by taking partridges in a snare, carp with a line, and bottles\nwith a slipnoose.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was\nin bottles. I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move\nwith a pack-thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"No, but you can take out two or three boards of the partition,\"\nanswered Blaisois, \"and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet.\"\n\nMousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost, astonished to find\nin Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit.\n\n\"'Tis true,\" he said; \"but where can I get a chisel to take the planks\nout, a gimlet to pierce the cask?\"\n\n\"Trousers,\" said Grimaud, still squaring his accounts.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Mousqueton.\n\nGrimaud, in fact, was not only the accountant, but the armorer of\nthe party; and as he was a man full of forethought, these trousers,\ncarefully rolled up in his valise, contained every sort of tool for\nimmediate use.\n\nMousqueton, therefore, was soon provided with tools and he began his\ntask. In a few minutes he had extracted three boards. He tried to pass\nhis body through the aperture, but not being like the frog in the fable,\nwho thought he was larger than he really was, he found he must take out\nthree or four more before he could get through.\n\nHe sighed and set to work again.\n\nGrimaud had now finished his accounts. He arose and stood near\nMousqueton.\n\n\"I,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" said Mousqueton.\n\n\"I can pass.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Mousqueton, glancing at his friend's long and thin\nbody, \"you will pass easily.\"\n\n\"And he knows the full casks,\" said Blaisois, \"for he has already been\nin the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan. Let Monsieur Grimaud\ngo in, Monsieur Mouston.\"\n\n\"I could go in as well as Grimaud,\" said Mousqueton, a little piqued.\n\n\"Yes, but that would take too much time and I am thirsty. I am getting\nmore and more seasick.\"\n\n\"Go in, then, Grimaud,\" said Mousqueton, handing him the beer pot and\ngimlet.\n\n\"Rinse the glasses,\" said Grimaud. Then with a friendly gesture toward\nMousqueton, that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so\nbrilliantly begun by another, he glided like a serpent through the\nopening and disappeared.\n\nBlaisois was in a state of great excitement; he was in ecstasies. Of\nall the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the\nextraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated, this\nseemed without question to be the most wonderful.\n\n\"You are about to see,\" said Mousqueton, looking at Blaisois with\nan expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of\nquestioning, \"you are about to see, Blaisois, how we old soldiers drink\nwhen we are thirsty.\"\n\n\"My cloak,\" said Grimaud, from the bottom of the hold.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Blaisois.\n\n\"My cloak--stop up the aperture with it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Blaisois.\n\n\"Simpleton!\" exclaimed Mousqueton; \"suppose any one came into the room.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" cried Blaisois, with evident admiration; \"but it will be\ndark in the cellar.\"\n\n\"Grimaud always sees, dark or light, night as well as day,\" answered\nMousqueton.\n\n\"That is lucky,\" said Blaisois. \"As for me, when I have no candle I\ncan't take two steps without knocking against something.\"\n\n\"That's because you haven't served,\" said Mousqueton. \"Had you been in\nthe army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a\nclosed oven. But hark! I think some one is coming.\"\n\nMousqueton made, with a low whistling sound, the sign of alarm well\nknown to the lackeys in the days of their youth, resumed his place at\nthe table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example.\n\nBlaisois obeyed.\n\nThe door of their cabin was opened. Two men, wrapped in their cloaks,\nappeared.\n\n\"Oho!\" said they, \"not in bed at a quarter past eleven. That's against\nall rules. In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring.\"\n\nThese two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was\nsecreted; opened the door, entered and shut it after them.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Blaisois, \"he is lost!\"\n\n\"Grimaud's a cunning fellow,\" murmured Mousqueton.\n\nThey waited for ten minutes, during which time no noise was heard that\nmight indicate that Grimaud was discovered, and at the expiration of\nthat anxious interval the two men returned, closed the door after\nthem, and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and\nextinguish their lights, disappeared.\n\n\"Shall we obey?\" asked Blaisois. \"All this looks suspicious.\"\n\n\"They said a quarter of an hour. We still have five minutes,\" replied\nMousqueton.\n\n\"Suppose we warn the masters.\"\n\n\"Let's wait for Grimaud.\"\n\n\"But perhaps they have killed him.\"\n\n\"Grimaud would have cried out.\"\n\n\"You know he is almost dumb.\"\n\n\"We should have heard the blow, then.\"\n\n\"But if he doesn't return?\"\n\n\"Here he is.\"\n\nAt that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture\nand came in with his face livid, his eyes staring wide open with terror,\nso that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing, with a large\ncircle of white around them. He held in his hand a tankard full of a\ndark substance, and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp\nhe uttered this single monosyllable: \"Oh!\" with such an expression of\nextreme terror that Mousqueton started, alarmed, and Blaisois was near\nfainting from fright.\n\nBoth, however, cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard--it was full\nof gunpowder.\n\nConvinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of\nwine, Grimaud hastened to awake D'Artagnan, who had no sooner beheld him\nthan he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place. Imposing\nsilence, Grimaud put out the little night lamp, then knelt down and\npoured into the lieutenant's ear a recital melodramatic enough not to\nrequire play of feature to give it pith.\n\nThis was the gist of his strange story:\n\nThe first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment\nhe struck--it was empty. He passed on to another--it, also, was empty,\nbut the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it gave out,\nevidently full. At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make\na hole with his gimlet, when he found a spigot; he therefore placed his\ntankard under it and turned the spout; something, whatever it was the\ncask contained, fell silently into the tankard.\n\nWhilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the\ntankard contained before taking it to his companions, the door of the\ncellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a\ncloak, came and stood just before the hogshead, behind which Grimaud,\non hearing him come in, instantly crept. This was Groslow. He was\naccompanied by another man, who carried in his hand something long and\nflexible rolled up, resembling a washing line. His face was hidden under\nthe wide brim of his hat. Grimaud, thinking that they had come, as he\nhad, to try the port wine, effaced himself behind his cask and consoled\nhimself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not\na great one.\n\n\"Have you the wick?\" asked the one who carried the lantern.\n\n\"Here it is,\" answered the other.\n\nAt the voice of this last speaker, Grimaud started and felt a shudder\ncreeping through his very marrow. He rose gently, so that his head\nwas just above the round of the barrel, and under the large hat he\nrecognized the pale face of Mordaunt.\n\n\"How long will this fuse burn?\" asked this person.\n\n\"About five minutes,\" replied the captain.\n\nThat voice also was known to Grimaud. He looked from one to the other\nand after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow.\n\n\"Then tell the men to be in readiness--don't tell them why now. When the\nclock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men. Get down into\nthe longboat.\"\n\n\"That is, when I have lighted the match?\"\n\n\"I will undertake that. I wish to be sure of my revenge. Are the oars in\nthe boat?\"\n\n\"Everything is ready.\"\n\n\"'Tis well.\"\n\nMordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot,\nin order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the\nopposite end with the match.\n\nHe then arose.\n\n\"You hear me--at a quarter past midnight--in fact, in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"I understand all perfectly, sir,\" replied Groslow; \"but allow me to say\nthere is great danger in what you undertake; would it not be better to\nintrust one of the men to set fire to the train?\"\n\n\"My dear Groslow,\" answered Mordaunt, \"you know the French proverb,\n'Nothing one does not do one's self is ever well done.' I shall abide by\nthat rule.\"\n\nGrimaud had heard all this, if he had not understood it. But what he saw\nmade good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language. He\nhad seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers, had seen Mordaunt\nadjust the fuse; he had heard the proverb, which Mordaunt had given in\nFrench. Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held\nin his hand; and, instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois\nand Mousqueton, he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse\npowder.\n\nMordaunt went away with the captain. At the door he stopped to listen.\n\n\"Do you hear how they sleep?\" he asked.\n\nIn fact, Porthos could be heard snoring through the partition.\n\n\"'Tis God who gives them into our hands,\" answered Groslow.\n\n\"This time the devil himself shall not save them,\" rejoined Mordaunt.\n\nAnd they went out together.\n\n\n\n\n72. End of the Port Wine Mystery.\n\n\n\nGrimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was\nsatisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his\nforehead, \"how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty!\"\n\nHe made haste to pass out by the opening, still thinking himself in a\ndream; but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that\nhis dream was a fatal nightmare.\n\nIt may be imagined that D'Artagnan listened to these details with\nincreasing interest; before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise\nand putting his mouth to Aramis's ear, and at the same time touching him\non the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement:\n\n\"Chevalier,\" he said, \"get up and don't make the least noise.\"\n\nAramis awoke. D'Artagnan, pressing his hand, repeated his call. Aramis\nobeyed.\n\n\"Athos is near you,\" said D'Artagnan; \"warn him as I have warned you.\"\n\nAramis easily aroused Athos, whose sleep was light, like that of\nall persons of a finely organized constitution. But there was more\ndifficulty in arousing Porthos. He was beginning to ask full explanation\nof that breaking in on his sleep, which was very annoying to him, when\nD'Artagnan, instead of explaining, closed his mouth with his hand.\n\nThen our Gascon, extending his arms, drew to him the heads of his three\nfriends till they almost touched one another.\n\n\"Friends,\" he said, \"we must leave this craft at once or we are dead\nmen.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Athos, \"are you still afraid?\"\n\n\"Do you know who is captain of this vessel?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Captain Groslow.\"\n\nThe shudder of the three musketeers showed to D'Artagnan that his words\nbegan to make some impression on them.\n\n\"Groslow!\" said Aramis; \"the devil!\n\n\"Who is this Groslow?\" asked Porthos. \"I don't remember him.\"\n\n\"Groslow is the man who broke Parry's head and is now getting ready to\nbreak ours.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"And do you know who is his lieutenant?\"\n\n\"His lieutenant? There is none,\" said Athos. \"They don't have\nlieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind; he has\na lieutenant, and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt.\"\n\nThis time the musketeers did more than shudder--they almost cried out.\nThose invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence\nwhich that name had over them; the mere sound of it filled them with\nterror.\n\n\"What shall we do?\" said Athos.\n\n\"We must seize the felucca,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"And kill him,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"The felucca is mined,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Those casks which I took for\ncasks of port wine are filled with powder. When Mordaunt finds himself\ndiscovered he will destroy all, friends and foes; and on my word he\nwould be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell.\"\n\n\"You have some plan, then?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Have you confidence in me?\"\n\n\"Give your orders,\" said the three musketeers.\n\n\"Very well; come this way.\"\n\nD'Artagnan went toward a very small, low window, just large enough to\nlet a man through. He turned it gently on its hinges.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"is our road.\"\n\n\"The deuce! it is a very cold one, my dear friend,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Stay here, if you like, but I warn you 'twill be rather too warm\npresently.\"\n\n\"But we cannot swim to the shore.\"\n\n\"The longboat is yonder, lashed to the felucca. We will take possession\nof it and cut the cable. Come, my friends.\"\n\n\"A moment's delay,\" said Athos; \"our servants?\"\n\n\"Here we are!\" they cried.\n\nMeantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful\nsight which D'Artagnan, in raising the shutters, had disclosed to them\nthrough the narrow opening of the window.\n\nThose who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing\nmore solemn, more striking, than the raging sea, rolling, with its\ndeafening roar, its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry\nmoon.\n\n\"Gracious Heaven, we are hesitating!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"if we hesitate\nwhat will the servants do?\"\n\n\"I do not hesitate, you know,\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"Sir,\" interposed Blaisois, \"I warn you that I can only swim in rivers.\"\n\n\"And I not at all,\" said Mousqueton.\n\nBut D'Artagnan had now slipped through the window.\n\n\"You have decided, friend?\" said Athos.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Gascon answered; \"Athos! you, who are a perfect being, bid\nspirit triumph over body. Do you, Aramis, order the servants. Porthos,\nkill every one who stands in your way.\"\n\nAnd after pressing the hand of Athos, D'Artagnan chose a moment when\nthe ship rolled backward, so that he had only to plunge into the water,\nwhich was already up to his waist.\n\nAthos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves; the cable\nwhich tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of\nthe sea.\n\nD'Artagnan swam to it and held it, suspending himself by this rope, his\nhead alone out of water.\n\nIn one second Athos joined him.\n\nThen they saw, as the felucca turned, two other heads peeping, those of\nAramis and Grimaud.\n\n\"I am uneasy about Blaisois,\" said Athos; \"he can, he says, only swim in\nrivers.\"\n\n\"When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere. To the boat! to the\nboat!\"\n\n\"But Porthos, I do not see him.\"\n\n\"Porthos is coming--he swims like Leviathan.\"\n\nIn fact, Porthos did not appear; for a scene, half tragedy and half\ncomedy, had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois, who,\nfrightened by the noise of the sea, by the whistling of the wind, by the\nsight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them, shrank back\ninstead of going forward.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said Porthos; \"jump in.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" said Mousqueton, \"I can't swim; let me stay here.\"\n\n\"And me, too, monsieur,\" said Blaisois.\n\n\"I assure you, I shall be very much in the way in that little boat,\"\nsaid Mousqueton.\n\n\"And I know I shall drown before reaching it,\" continued Blaisois.\n\n\"Come along! I shall strangle you both if you don't get out,\" said\nPorthos at last, seizing Mousqueton by the throat. \"Forward, Blaisois!\"\n\nA groan, stifled by the grasp of Porthos, was all the reply of poor\nBlaisois, for the giant, taking him neck and heels, plunged him into the\nwater headforemost, pushing him out of the window as if he had been a\nplank.\n\n\"Now, Mousqueton,\" he said, \"I hope you don't mean to desert your\nmaster?\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" replied Mousqueton, his eyes filling with tears, \"why did you\nre-enter the army? We were all so happy in the Chateau de Pierrefonds!\"\n\nAnd without any other complaint, passive and obedient, either from true\ndevotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois, Mousqueton\nleaped into the sea headforemost. A sublime action, at all events, for\nMousqueton looked upon himself as dead. But Porthos was not a man to\nabandon an old servant, and when Mousqueton rose above the water, blind\nas a new-born puppy, he found he was supported by the large hand of\nPorthos and that he was thus enabled, without having occasion even to\nmove, to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton.\n\nIn a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions, who were already\nin the boat; but when, after they had all got in, it came to his turn,\nthere was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the\nboat he would upset the little vessel. Athos was the last to enter.\n\n\"Are you all here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah! have you your sword, Athos?\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Cut the cable, then.\"\n\nAthos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord. The felucca\nwent on, the boat continued stationary, rocked only by the swashing\nwaves.\n\n\"Come, Athos!\" said D'Artagnan, giving his hand to the count; \"you are\ngoing to see something curious,\" added the Gascon.\n\n\n\n\n73. Fatality.\n\n\n\nScarcely had D'Artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden\nnoise was heard resounding through the felucca, which had now become dim\nin the obscurity of the night.\n\n\"That, you may be sure,\" said the Gascon, \"means something.\"\n\nThey then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a\npole appear on the deck, defining the forms of shadows behind it.\n\nSuddenly a terrible cry, a cry of despair, was wafted through space; and\nas if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds, the veil which\nhid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the\nfelucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light.\n\nShadows ran, as if bewildered, to and fro on the vessel, and mournful\ncries accompanied these delirious walkers. In the midst of these screams\nthey saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand.\n\nThe agitated figures, apparently wild with terror, consisted of Groslow,\nwho at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors.\nMordaunt, after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the\nmusketeers were still asleep, had gone down into the cellar, convinced\nby their silence that they were all in a deep slumber. Then he had run\nto the train, impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge, and full of\nconfidence, as are those whom God blinds, he had set fire to the wick of\nnitre.\n\nAll this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck.\n\n\"Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us,\" said Groslow.\n\nOne of the sailors got down the side of the ship, seized the cable, and\ndrew it; it came without the least resistance.\n\n\"The cable is cut!\" he cried, \"no boat!\"\n\n\"How! no boat!\" exclaimed Groslow; \"it is impossible.\"\n\n\"'Tis true, however,\" answered the sailor; \"there's nothing in the wake\nof the ship; besides, here's the end of the cable.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Mordaunt, who, coming up out of the hatchway,\nrushed to the stern, waving his torch.\n\n\"Only that our enemies have escaped; they have cut the cord and gone off\nwith the boat.\"\n\nMordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door.\n\n\"Empty!\" he exclaimed; \"the infernal demons!\"\n\n\"We must pursue them,\" said Groslow, \"they can't be gone far, and we\nwill sink them, passing over them.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the fire,\" ejaculated Mordaunt; \"I have lighted it.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand devils!\" cried Groslow, rushing to the hatchway; \"perhaps\nthere is still time to save us.\"\n\nMordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh, threw his torch into the\nsea and plunged in after it. The instant Groslow put his foot upon the\nhatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano. A burst\nof flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred\ncannon; the air burned, ignited by flaming embers, then the frightful\nlightning disappeared, the brands sank, one after another, into the\nabyss, where they were extinguished, and save for a slight vibration\nin the air, after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that\nnothing had happened.\n\nOnly--the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and\nGroslow and his three sailors were consumed.\n\nThe four friends saw all this--not a single detail of this fearful scene\nescaped them. At one moment, bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant\nlight, which illumined the sea for the space of a league, they might\neach be seen, each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing\nthe awe which, even in their hearts of bronze, they could not help\nexperiencing. Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them--then,\nat last, the volcano was extinguished--then all was dark and still--the\nfloating bark and heaving ocean.\n\nThey sat silent and dejected.\n\n\"By Heaven!\" at last said Athos, the first to speak, \"by this time, I\nthink, all must be over.\"\n\n\"Here, my lords! save me! help!\" cried a voice, whose mournful accents,\nreaching the four friends, seemed to proceed from some phantom of the\nocean.\n\nAll looked around; Athos himself stared.\n\n\"'Tis he! it is his voice!\"\n\nAll still remained silent, the eyes of all were turned in the direction\nwhere the vessel had disappeared, endeavoring in vain to penetrate the\ndarkness. After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man, who\napproached them, swimming vigorously.\n\nAthos extended his arm toward him, pointing him out to his companions.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I see him well enough,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"He--again!\" cried Porthos, who was breathing like a blacksmith's\nbellows; \"why, he is made of iron.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" muttered Athos.\n\nAramis and D'Artagnan whispered to each other.\n\nMordaunt made several strokes more, and raising his arm in sign of\ndistress above the waves: \"Pity, pity on me, gentlemen, in Heaven's\nname! my strength is failing me; I am dying.\"\n\nThe voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the\nheart of Athos.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said D'Artagnan, \"monsters have only to complain to gain your\nsympathy. I believe he's swimming toward us. Does he think we are going\nto take him in? Row, Porthos, row.\" And setting the example he plowed\nhis oar into the sea; two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms\nfurther.\n\n\"Oh! you will not abandon me! You will not leave me to perish! You will\nnot be pitiless!\" cried Mordaunt.\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Porthos to Mordaunt, \"I think we have you now, my hero!\nand there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of\nhell.\"\n\n\"Oh! Porthos!\" murmured the Comte de la Fere.\n\n\"Oh, pray, for mercy's sake, don't fly from me. For pity's sake!\" cried\nthe young man, whose agony-drawn breath at times, when his head went\nunder water, under the wave, exhaled and made the icy waters bubble.\n\nD'Artagnan, however, who had consulted with Aramis, spoke to the poor\nwretch. \"Go away,\" he said; \"your repentance is too recent to inspire\nconfidence. See! the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still\nsmoking; and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared\nto that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed\nMonsieur Groslow and his companions.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" replied Mordaunt, in a tone of deep despair, \"my penitence is\nsincere. Gentlemen, I am young, scarcely twenty-three years old. I was\ndrawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother. You would\nhave done what I did.\"\n\nMordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat, for the\napproach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength.\n\n\"Alas!\" he said, \"I am then to die? You are going to kill the son, as\nyou killed the mother! Surely, if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon,\nI ought to be forgiven.\"\n\nThen, as if his strength failed him, he seemed unable to sustain himself\nabove the water and a wave passed over his head, which drowned his\nvoice.\n\n\"Oh! this is torture to me,\" cried Athos.\n\nMordaunt reappeared.\n\n\"For my part,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I say this must come to an end;\nmurderer, as you were, of your uncle! executioner, as you were, of King\nCharles! incendiary! I recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of\nthe sea; and if you come another fathom nearer, I'll stave your wicked\nhead in with this oar.\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan!\" cried Athos, \"my son, I entreat you; the\nwretch is dying, and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a\nhand to save him. I cannot resist doing so; he must live.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" replied D'Artagnan, \"why don't you give yourself up directly,\nfeet and hands bound, to that wretch? Ah! Comte de la Fere, you wish to\nperish by his hands! I, your son, as you call me--I will not let you!\"\n\n'Twas the first time D'Artagnan had ever refused a request from Athos.\n\nAramis calmly drew his sword, which he had carried between his teeth as\nhe swam.\n\n\"If he lays his hand on the boat's edge I will cut it off, regicide that\nhe is.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Porthos. \"Wait.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Throw myself in the water and strangle him.\"\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen!\" cried Athos, \"be men! be Christians! See! death is\ndepicted on his face! Ah! do not bring on me the horrors of remorse!\nGrant me this poor wretch's life. I will bless you--I----\"\n\n\"I am dying!\" cried Mordaunt, \"come to me! come to me!\"\n\nD'Artagnan began to be touched. The boat at this moment turned around,\nand the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos.\n\n\"Monsieur the Comte de la Fere,\" he cried, \"I supplicate you! pity me!\nI call on you--where are you? I see you no longer--I am dying--help me!\nhelp me!\"\n\n\"Here I am, sir!\" said Athos, leaning and stretching out his arm to\nMordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him;\n\"here I am, take my hand and jump into our boat.\"\n\nMordaunt made a last effort--rose--seized the hand thus extended to him\nand grasped it with the vehemence of despair.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Athos; \"put your other hand here.\" And he offered\nhim his shoulder as another stay and support, so that his head almost\ntouched that of Mordaunt; and these two mortal enemies were in as close\nan embrace as if they had been brothers.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said the count, \"you are safe--calm yourself.\"\n\n\"Ah! my mother,\" cried Mordaunt, with eyes on fire with a look of hate\nimpossible to paint, \"I can only offer thee one victim, but it shall at\nany rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen!\"\n\nAnd whilst D'Artagnan uttered a cry, Porthos raised the oar, and\nAramis sought a place to strike, a frightful shake given to the boat\nprecipitated Athos into the sea; whilst Mordaunt, with a shout of\ntriumph, grasped the neck of his victim, and in order to paralyze his\nmovements, twined arms and legs around the musketeer. For an instant,\nwithout an exclamation, without a cry for help, Athos tried to sustain\nhimself on the surface of the waters, but the weight dragged him down;\nhe disappeared by degrees; soon nothing was to be seen except his long,\nfloating hair; then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water,\nwhich, in its turn, was soon effaced, alone indicated the spot where\nthese two had sunk.\n\nMute with horror, the three friends had remained open-mouthed, their\neyes dilated, their arms extended like statues, and, motionless as they\nwere, the beating of their hearts was audible. Porthos was the first who\ncame to himself. He tore his hair.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"Athos! Athos! thou man of noble heart; woe is me! I\nhave let thee perish!\"\n\nAt this instant, in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the\nlight of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking\nmen was again obvious, and first were seen, rising above the waves, a\nwisp of hair, then a pale face with open eyes, yet, nevertheless, the\neyes of death; then a body, which, after rising of itself even to the\nwaist above the sea, turned gently on its back, according to the caprice\nof the waves, and floated.\n\nIn the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard, the gold hilt of\nwhich shone in the moonbeams.\n\n\"Mordaunt! Mordaunt!\" cried the three friends; \"'tis Mordaunt!\"\n\n\"But Athos!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.\n\nSuddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight\nand Grimaud uttered a shout of joy; every one turned around and beheld\nAthos, livid, his eyes dim and his hands trembling, supporting himself\non the edge of the boat. Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately\nand laid him in the boat, where directly Athos was warmed and\nreanimated, reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends, who\nwere intoxicated with joy.\n\n\"You are not hurt?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Athos; \"and he----\"\n\n\"Oh, he! now we may say at last, thank Heaven! he is really dead. Look!\"\nand D'Artagnan, obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed,\nshowed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back, which, sometimes\nsubmerged, sometimes rising, seemed still to pursue the four friends\nwith looks of insult and mortal hatred.\n\nAt last he sank. Athos had followed him with a glance in which the\ndeepest melancholy and pity were expressed.\n\n\"Bravo! Athos!\" cried Aramis, with an emotion very rare in him.\n\n\"A capital blow you gave!\" cried Porthos.\n\n\"I have a son. I wished to live,\" said Athos.\n\n\"In short,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this has been the will of God.\"\n\n\"It was not I who killed him,\" said Athos in a soft, low tone, \"'twas\ndestiny.\"\n\n\n\n\n74. How Mousqueton, after being very nearly roasted, had a Narrow Escape\nof being eaten.\n\n\n\nA deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful\nscene described.\n\nThe moon, which had shone for a short time, disappeared behind the\nclouds; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful\nin the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert, the ocean, and\nnothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the\ntops of the crested billows.\n\nPorthos was the first to speak.\n\n\"I have seen,\" he said, \"many dreadful things, but nothing that ever\nagitated me so much as what I have just witnessed. Nevertheless, even in\nmy present state of perturbation, I protest that I feel happy. I have\na hundred pounds' weight less upon my chest. I breathe more freely.\" In\nfact, Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his\npowerful lungs.\n\n\"For my part,\" observed Aramis, \"I cannot say the same as you do,\nPorthos. I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe\nmy eyes. I look around the boat, expecting every moment to see that poor\nwretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart.\"\n\n\"Oh! I feel easy,\" replied Porthos. \"The poniard was pointed at the\nsixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body. I do not reproach you,\nAthos, for what you have done. On the contrary, when one aims a blow\nthat is the regulation way to strike. So now, I breathe again--I am\nhappy!\"\n\n\"Don't be in haste to celebrate a victory, Porthos,\" interposed\nD'Artagnan; \"never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now\nencountering. Men may subdue men--they cannot overcome the elements. We\nare now on the sea, at night, without any pilot, in a frail bark; should\na blast of wind upset the boat we are lost.\"\n\nMousqueton heaved a deep sigh.\n\n\"You are ungrateful, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos; \"yes, ungrateful to\nProvidence, to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner.\nLet us sail before the wind, and unless it changes we shall be drifted\neither to Calais or Boulogne. Should our bark be upset we are five of us\ngood swimmers, able enough to turn it over again, or if not, to hold on\nby it. Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between\nDover and Calais take, 'tis impossible but that we should meet with a\nfisherman who will pick us up.\"\n\n\"But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the\nnorth?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Athos, \"would be quite another thing; and we should\nnevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Which implies that we may die of hunger,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"'Tis more than possible,\" answered the Comte de la Fere.\n\nMousqueton sighed again, more deeply than before.\n\n\"What is the matter? what ails you?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"I am cold, sir,\" said Mousqueton.\n\n\"Impossible! your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves\nit from the cold air.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, 'tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver.\"\n\n\"How is that, Mousqueton?\n\n\"Alas! your honor, in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a\nlot of books of travels.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"In these books, your honor, 'tis told how hungry voyagers, drifting out\nto sea, have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with----\"\n\n\"The fattest among them!\" cried D'Artagnan, unable in spite of the\ngravity of the occasion to help laughing.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Mousqueton; \"but permit me to say I see nothing\nlaughable in it. However,\" he added, turning to Porthos, \"I should not\nregret dying, sir, were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful\nto you.\"\n\n\"Mouston,\" replied Porthos, much affected, \"should we ever see my castle\nof Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants\nthe vineyard that surrounds the farm.\"\n\n\"And you should call it 'Devotion,'\" added Aramis; \"the vineyard of\nself-sacrifice, to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your\ndevotion to your master.\"\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said D'Artagnan, laughing, \"you could eat a piece of\nMouston, couldn't you, especially after two or three days of fasting?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Aramis, \"I should much prefer Blaisois; we haven't\nknown him so long.\"\n\nOne may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended\nchiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place,\nthe servants, with the exception of Grimaud, were not silent. Suddenly\nMousqueton uttered a cry of delight, taking from beneath one of the\nbenches a bottle of wine; and on looking more closely in the same place\nhe discovered a dozen similar bottles, bread, and a monster junk of\nsalted beef.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" he cried, passing the bottle to Porthos, \"we are saved--the\nbark is supplied with provisions.\"\n\nThis intelligence restored every one save Athos to gayety.\n\n\"Zounds!\" exclaimed Porthos, \"'tis astonishing how empty violent\nagitation makes the stomach.\"\n\nAnd he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of\nthe bread and meat.\n\n\"Now,\" said Athos, \"sleep, or try to sleep, my friends, and I will\nwatch.\"\n\nIn a few moments, notwithstanding their wet clothes, the icy blast that\nblew and the previous scene of terror, these hardy adventurers, with\ntheir iron frames, inured to every hardship, threw themselves down,\nintending to profit by the advice of Athos, who sat at the helm,\npensively wakeful, guiding the little bark the way it was to go, his\neyes fixed on the heavens, as if he sought to verify not only the road\nto France, but the benign aspect of protecting Providence. After some\nhours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos.\n\nDawn was shedding its pallid, placid glimmer on the purple ocean, when\nat the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass,\nabove which gleamed a triangular sail; then masters and servants joined\nin a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save.\n\n\"A bark!\" all cried together.\n\nIt was, in fact, a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all\naboard. Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain, and at nine\no'clock in the morning, having a fair wind, our Frenchmen set foot on\ntheir native land.\n\n\"Egad! how strong one feels here!\" said Porthos, almost burying his\nlarge feet in the sands. \"Zounds! I could defy a nation!\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Porthos,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we are observed.\"\n\n\"We are admired, i'faith,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"These people who are looking at us are only merchants,\" said Athos,\n\"and are looking more at the cargo than at us.\"\n\n\"I shall not trust to that,\" said the lieutenant, \"and I shall make for\nthe Dunes* as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\n*Sandy hills about Dunkirk, from which it derives its name.\n\n\n\nThe party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks\nof sand unobserved. Here, after a short conference, they proposed to\nseparate.\n\n\"And why separate?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Because,\" answered the Gascon, \"we were sent, Porthos and I, by\nCardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell; instead of fighting for Cromwell\nwe have served Charles I.--not the same thing by any means. In returning\nwith the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur d'Herblay our crime would be\nconfirmed. We have circumvented Cromwell, Mordaunt, and the sea, but we\nshall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Mazarin.\"\n\n\"You forget,\" replied Athos, \"that we consider ourselves your prisoners\nand not free from the engagement we entered into.\"\n\n\"Truly, Athos,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"I am vexed that such a man\nas you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of.\nChevalier,\" he continued, addressing Aramis, who, leaning proudly on his\nsword, seemed to agree with his companion, \"Chevalier, Porthos and I run\nno risk; besides, should any ill-luck happen to two of us, will it not\nbe much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who\nmay be apprehended? Besides, who knows whether, divided, we may not\nobtain a pardon--you from the queen, we from Mazarin--which, were we all\nfour together, would never be granted. Come, Athos and Aramis, go to the\nright; Porthos, come with me to the left; these gentlemen should file\noff into Normandy, whilst we, by the nearest road, reach Paris.\"\n\nHe then gave his friends minute directions as to their route.\n\n\"Ah! my dear friend,\" exclaimed Athos, \"how I should admire the\nresources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart.\"\n\nAnd he gave him his hand.\n\n\"Isn't this fox a genius, Athos?\" asked the Gascon. \"No! he knows how to\ncrunch fowls, to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or\nby night, that's all. Well, is all said?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Then let's count our money and divide it. Ah! hurrah! there's the sun!\nA merry morning to you, Sunshine. 'Tis a long time since I saw thee!\"\n\n\"Come, come, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos, \"do not affect to be\nstrong-minded; there are tears in your eyes. Let us be open with each\nother and sincere.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the Gascon, \"do you think, Athos, we can take leave,\ncalmly, of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and\nAramis?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Athos; \"embrace me, my son.\"\n\n\"Zounds!\" said Porthos, sobbing, \"I believe I'm crying; but how foolish\nall this is!\"\n\nThen they embraced. At that moment their fraternal bond of union was\ncloser than ever, and when they parted, each to take the route agreed\non, they turned back to utter affectionate expressions, which the echoes\nof the Dunes repeated. At last they lost sight of each other.\n\n\"Sacrebleu! D'Artagnan,\" said Porthos, \"I must out with it at once, for\nI can't keep to myself anything I have against you; I haven't been able\nto recognize you in this matter.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said D'Artagnan, with his wise smile.\n\n\"Because if, as you say, Athos and Aramis are in real danger, this is\nnot the time to abandon them. For my part, I confess to you that I was\nall ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them, in spite of\nall the Mazarins in the world.\"\n\n\"You would be right, Porthos, but for one thing, which may change the\ncurrent of your ideas; and that is, that it is not those gentlemen who\nare in the greatest danger, it is ourselves; it is not to abandon them\nthat we have separated, but to avoid compromising them.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Porthos, opening his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes, no doubt. If they are arrested they will only be put in the\nBastile; if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Greve.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said Porthos, \"there is quite a gap between that fate and the\nbaronial coronet you promised me, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Bah! perhaps not so great as you think, Porthos; you know the proverb,\n'All roads lead to Rome.'\"\n\n\"But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and\nAramis?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by Queen\nHenrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by Mazarin; because,\ngoing hence as emissaries to Cromwell, we became partisans of King\nCharles; because, instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by\nthose fellows called Mazarin, Cromwell, Joyce, Bridge, Fairfax, etc., we\nvery nearly succeeded in saving it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word that is true,\" said Porthos; \"but how can you suppose,\nmy dear friend, that in the midst of his great preoccupations General\nCromwell has had time to think----\"\n\n\"Cromwell thinks of everything; Cromwell has time for everything; and\nbelieve me, dear friend, we ought not to lose our time--it is precious.\nWe shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin, and then----\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Porthos; \"what can we say to Mazarin?\"\n\n\"Leave that to me--I have my plan. He laughs best who laughs last.\nCromwell is mighty, Mazarin is tricky, but I would rather have to do\nwith them than with the late Monsieur Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Porthos, \"it is very pleasant to be able to say 'the late\nMonsieur Mordaunt.'\"\n\n\"My faith, yes,\" said D'Artagnan. \"But we must be going.\"\n\nThe two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris,\nfollowed by Mousqueton, who, after being too cold all night, at the end\nof a quarter of an hour found himself too warm.\n\n\n\n\n75. The Return.\n\n\n\nDuring the six weeks that Athos and Aramis had been absent from France,\nthe Parisians, finding themselves one morning without either queen or\nking, were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted, and the absence of\nMazarin, a thing so long desired, did not compensate for that of the two\naugust fugitives.\n\nThe first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint\nGermain, was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake\nin the night and find themselves alone. A deputation was therefore\nsent to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris; but she not only\ndeclined to receive the deputies, but sent an intimation by Chancellor\nSeguier, implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before\nher majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of\nthe quarrel, Paris would be besieged the very next day.\n\nThis threatening answer, unluckily for the court, produced quite a\ndifferent effect to that which was intended. It wounded the pride of the\nparliament, which, supported by the citizens, replied by declaring that\nCardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent; denounced him as\nthe enemy both of the king and the state, and ordered him to retire\nfrom the court that same day and from France within a week afterward;\nenjoining, in case of disobedience on his part, all the subjects of the\nking to pursue and take him.\n\nMazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the\nlaw, preparations on both sides were commenced--by the queen, to attack\nParis, by the citizens, to defend it. The latter were occupied in\nbreaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets, when,\nheaded by the coadjutor, appeared the Prince de Conti (the brother of\nthe Prince de Conde) and the Duc de Longueville, his brother-in-law.\nThis unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of\nJanuary and the Prince of Conti was named, but not until after a stormy\ndiscussion, generalissimo of the army of the king, out of Paris.\n\nAs for the Duc de Beaufort, he arrived from Vendome, according to the\nannals of the day, bringing with him his high bearing and his long and\nbeautiful hair, qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the\nmarketplaces.\n\nThe Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic\nof the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to\ndisguise themselves as soldiers. On the nineteenth the impromptu army\nhad attempted a sortie, more to assure itself and others of its actual\nexistence than with any more serious intention. They carried a banner,\non which could be read this strange device: \"We are seeking our king.\"\n\nThe next following days were occupied in trivial movements which\nresulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the\nburning of two or three houses.\n\nThat was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of\nFebruary. On the first day of that month our four companions had landed\nat Boulogne, and, in two parties, had set out for Paris. Toward the\nend of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre,\nwhich place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts, fearing that\nthey might encounter some troop from the queen's army.\n\nIt was against his will that Athos took these precautions, but\nAramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be\nimprudent, that they had been charged by King Charles with a supreme and\nsacred mission, which, received at the foot of the scaffold, could\nbe accomplished only at the feet of Queen Henrietta. Upon that, Athos\nyielded.\n\nOn reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms. The sentinel\nat the gate refused even to let them pass, and called his sergeant.\n\nThe sergeant, with the air of importance which such people assume when\nthey are clad with military dignity, said:\n\n\"Who are you, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Two gentlemen.\"\n\n\"And where do you come from?\"\n\n\"From London.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do in Paris?\"\n\n\"We are going with a mission to Her Majesty, the Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Ah, every one seems to be going to see the queen of England. We\nhave already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under\nexamination, who are on their way to her majesty. Where are your\npassports?\"\n\n\"We have none; we left England, ignorant of the state of politics here,\nhaving left Paris before the departure of the king.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the sergeant, with a cunning smile, \"you are Mazarinists, who\nare sent as spies.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" here Athos spoke, \"rest assured, if we were\nMazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport.\nIn your situation distrust those who are well provided with every\nformality.\"\n\n\"Enter the guardroom,\" said the sergeant; \"we will lay your case before\nthe commandant of the post.\"\n\nThe guardroom was filled with citizens and common people, some playing,\nsome drinking, some talking. In a corner, almost hidden from view, were\nthree gentlemen, who had preceded Athos and Aramis, and an officer was\nexamining their passports. The first impulse of these three, and of\nthose who last entered, was to cast an inquiring glance at each\nother. The first arrivals wore long cloaks, in whose drapery they\nwere carefully enveloped; one of them, shorter than the rest, remained\npertinaciously in the background.\n\nWhen the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability\nhe was bringing in two Mazarinists, it appeared to be the unanimous\nopinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass.\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Athos; \"yet it is probable, on the contrary, that we\nshall enter, because we seem to have to do with sensible people. There\nseems to be only one thing to do, which is, to send our names to Her\nMajesty the Queen of England, and if she engages to answer for us I\npresume we shall be allowed to enter.\"\n\nOn hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more\nattentive than ever to what was going on, wrapping his cloak around him\nmore carefully than before.\n\n\"Merciful goodness!\" whispered Aramis to Athos, \"did you see?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He looked to me--but 'tis impossible.\"\n\nAt this instant the sergeant, who had been for his orders, returned, and\npointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks, said:\n\n\"The passports are in order; let these three gentlemen pass.\"\n\nThe three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this\npermission.\n\nAramis looked after them, and as the last of them passed close to him he\npressed the hand of Athos.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my friend?\" asked the latter.\n\n\"I have--doubtless I am dreaming; tell me, sir,\" he said to the\nsergeant, \"do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out?\"\n\n\"Only by their passports; they are three Frondists, who are gone to\nrejoin the Duc de Longueville.\"\n\n\"'Tis strange,\" said Aramis, almost involuntarily; \"I fancied that I\nrecognized Mazarin himself.\"\n\nThe sergeant burst into a fit of laughter.\n\n\"He!\" he cried; \"he venture himself amongst us, to be hung! Not so\nfoolish as all that.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" muttered Athos, \"I may be mistaken, I haven't the unerring eye of\nD'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Who is speaking of Monsieur D'Artagnan?\" asked an officer who appeared\nat that moment upon the threshold of the room.\n\n\"What!\" cried Aramis and Athos, \"what! Planchet!\"\n\n\"Planchet,\" added Grimaud; \"Planchet, with a gorget, indeed!\"\n\n\"Ah, gentlemen!\" cried Planchet, \"so you are back again in Paris. Oh,\nhow happy you make us! no doubt you come to join the princes!\"\n\n\"As thou seest, Planchet,\" said Aramis, whilst Athos smiled on seeing\nwhat important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade\nof Mousqueton, Bazin and Grimaud.\n\n\"And Monsieur d'Artagnan, of whom you spoke just now, Monsieur\nd'Herblay; may I ask if you have any news of him?\"\n\n\"We parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he\nhas reached Paris before us.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I am sure he hasn't yet arrived. But then he may have stopped\nat Saint Germain.\"\n\n\"I don't think so; we appointed to meet at La Chevrette.\"\n\n\"I was there this very day.\"\n\n\"And had the pretty Madeleine no news?\" asked Aramis, smiling.\n\n\"No, sir, and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Aramis, \"there is no time lost and we made our journey\nquickly. Permit me, then, my dear Athos, without inquiring further about\nour friend, to pay my respects to M. Planchet.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur le chevalier,\" said Planchet, bowing.\n\n\"Lieutenant?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"Lieutenant, with a promise of becoming captain.\"\n\n\"'Tis capital; and pray, how did you acquire all these honors?\"\n\n\"In the first place, gentlemen, you know that I was the means of\nMonsieur de Rochefort's escape; well, I was very near being hung by\nMazarin and that made me more popular than ever.\"\n\n\"So, owing to your popularity----\"\n\n\"No; thanks to something better. You know, gentlemen, that I served the\nPiedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens, who began to\nmarch, some with the right foot, others with the left, I succeeded,\nI did, in making them all begin with the same foot, and I was made\nlieutenant on the spot.\"\n\n\"So I presume,\" said Athos, \"that you have a large number of the nobles\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Certainly. There are the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Longueville, the\nDuc de Beaufort, the Duc de Bouillon, the Marechal de la Mothe, the\nMarquis de Sevigne, and I don't know who, for my part.\"\n\n\"And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne?\" inquired Athos, in a tremulous\nvoice. \"D'Artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care, in\nparting.\"\n\n\"Yes, count; nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant since.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Athos in a tone of delight, \"he is well? no accident has\nhappened to him?\"\n\n\"None, sir.\"\n\n\"And he lives?\"\n\n\"Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlemagne.\"\n\n\"And passes his time?\"\n\n\"Sometimes with the queen of England, sometimes with Madame de\nChevreuse. He and the Count de Guiche are like each other's shadows.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Planchet, thanks!\" cried Athos, extending his hand to the\nlieutenant.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" Planchet only touched the tips of the count's fingers.\n\n\"Well, what are you doing, count--to a former lackey?\n\n\"My friend,\" said Athos, \"he has given me news of Raoul.\"\n\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" said Planchet, who had not heard what they were\nsaying, \"what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Re-enter Paris, if you will let us, my good Planchet.\"\n\n\"Let you, sir? Now, as ever, I am nothing but your servant.\" Then\nturning to his men:\n\n\"Allow these gentlemen to pass,\" he said; \"they are friends of the Duc\nde Beaufort.\"\n\n\"Long live the Duc de Beaufort!\" cried the sentinels.\n\nThe sergeant drew near to Planchet.\n\n\"What! without passports?\" he murmured.\n\n\"Without passports,\" said Planchet.\n\n\"Take notice, captain,\" he continued, giving Planchet his expected\ntitle, \"take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from\nhere told me privately to distrust these gentlemen.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Planchet, with dignity, \"I know them and I answer for\nthem.\"\n\nAs he said this, he pressed Grimaud's hand, who seemed honored by the\ndistinction.\n\n\"Farewell till we meet again,\" said Aramis, as they took leave of\nPlanchet; \"if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Planchet, \"I am in all things at your service.\"\n\n\"That fellow is no fool,\" said Aramis, as he got on his horse.\n\n\"How should he be?\" replied Athos, whilst mounting also, \"seeing he was\nused so long to brush your hats.\"\n\n\n\n\n76. The Ambassadors.\n\n\n\nThe two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg, but on\narriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris\nhad become rivers, and the open places lakes; after the great rains\nwhich fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river\ninundated half the capital. The two gentlemen were obliged, therefore,\nto get off their horses and take a boat; and in that strange manner they\napproached the Louvre.\n\nNight had closed in, and Paris, seen thus, by the light of lanterns\nflickering on the pools of water, crowded with ferry-boats of every\nkind, including those that glittered with the armed patrols, with the\nwatchword, passing from post to post--Paris presented such an aspect\nas to strongly seize the senses of Aramis, a man most susceptible to\nwarlike impressions.\n\nThey reached the queen's apartments, but were compelled to stop in the\nante-chamber, since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to\ngentlemen bringing her news from England.\n\n\"We, too,\" said Athos, to the footman who had given him that answer,\n\"not only bring news from England, but have just come from there.\"\n\n\"What? then, are your names, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d'Herblay,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Ah! in that case, gentlemen,\" said the footman, on hearing the names\nwhich the queen had so often pronounced with hope, \"in that case it is\nanother thing, and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping\nyou here a moment. Please follow me,\" and he went on before, followed by\nAthos and Aramis.\n\nOn arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he\nmade a sign for them to wait and opening the door:\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"I hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying\nyour orders, when you learn that the gentlemen I have come to announce\nare the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d'Herblay.\"\n\nOn hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy, which the two\ngentlemen heard.\n\n\"Poor queen!\" murmured Athos.\n\n\"Oh, let them come in! let them come in,\" cried the young princess,\nbounding to the door.\n\nThe poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought\nby her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons\nand her other daughter.\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen,\" repeated the princess, opening the door herself.\n\nThe queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or\nthree gentlemen, and among them the Duc de Chatillon, the brother of the\nnobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of\nMadame de Longueville, on the Place Royale. All these gentlemen had been\nnoticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse, and when the two friends\nwere announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone.\n\"Well, sirs!\" cried the queen, on perceiving the two friends, \"you\nhave come, faithful friends! But the royal couriers have been more\nexpeditious than you, and here are Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de\nChatillon, who bring me from Her Majesty the Queen Anne of Austria, the\nvery latest intelligence.\"\n\nAramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness, even the gayety of the\nqueen's manner.\n\n\"Go on with your recital, sirs,\" said the queen, turning to the Duc de\nChatillon. \"You said that His Majesty, King Charles, my august consort,\nhad been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects!\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" Chatillon stammered out.\n\nAthos and Aramis were more and more astonished.\n\n\"And that being conducted to the scaffold,\" resumed the queen--\"oh, my\nlord! oh, my king!--and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved\nby an indignant people.\"\n\n\"Just so madame,\" replied Chatillon, in so low a voice that though\nthe two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this\naffirmation.\n\nThe queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude, whilst her\ndaughter threw her arms around her mother's neck and kissed her--her own\neyes streaming with tears.\n\n\"Now, madame, nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful\nhomage,\" said Chatillon, who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern\ngaze of Athos.\n\n\"One moment, yes,\" answered the queen. \"One moment--I beg--for here\nare the Chevalier d'Herblay and the Comte de la Fere, just arrived from\nLondon, and they can give you, as eye-witnesses, such details as you\ncan convey to the queen, my royal sister. Speak, gentlemen, speak--I am\nlistening; conceal nothing, gloss over nothing. Since his majesty still\nlives, since the honor of the throne is safe, everything else is a\nmatter of indifference to me.\"\n\nAthos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart.\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed the queen, who remarked this movement and his\npaleness. \"Speak, sir! I beg you to do so.\"\n\n\"I beg you to excuse me, madame; I wish to add nothing to the recital\nof these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps\nbeen mistaken.\"\n\n\"Mistaken!\" cried the queen, almost suffocated by emotion; \"mistaken!\nwhat has happened, then?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos, \"if we are mistaken\nthe error has originated with the queen. I do not suppose you will\nhave the presumption to set it to rights--that would be to accuse Her\nMajesty, Queen Anne, of falsehood.\"\n\n\"With the queen, sir?\" replied Athos, in his calm, vibrating voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Flamarens, lowering his eyes.\n\nAthos sighed deeply.\n\n\"Or rather, sir,\" said Aramis, with his peculiar irritating politeness,\n\"the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the\nguardroom; for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not mistaken, we saw\nyou in the company of a third gentleman.\"\n\nChatillon and Flamarens started.\n\n\"Explain yourself, count!\" cried the queen, whose anxiety grew greater\nevery moment. \"On your brow I read despair--your lips falter ere you\nannounce some terrible tidings--your hands tremble. Oh, my God! my God!\nwhat has happened?\"\n\n\"Lord!\" ejaculated the young princess, falling on her knees, \"have mercy\non us!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Chatillon, \"if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you\nto announce them to the queen.\"\n\nAramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, with compressed lips and flashing eyes, \"you have not\nthe presumption to instruct the Comte de la Fere and myself what we\nought to say here?\"\n\nDuring this brief altercation Athos, with his hands on his heart, his\nhead bent low, approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow\nsaid:\n\n\"Madame, princes--who by nature are above other men--receive from Heaven\ncourage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank, for\ntheir hearts are elevated as their fortunes. We ought not, therefore, I\nthink, to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should\nact toward a woman of our lowlier condition. Queen, destined as you are\nto endure every sorrow on this earth, hear the result of our unhappy\nmission.\"\n\nAthos, kneeling down before the queen, trembling and very cold, drew\nfrom his bosom, inclosed in the same case, the order set in diamonds\nwhich the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which\nCharles I. before his death had placed in the hands of Aramis. Since the\nmoment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted\nwith them.\n\nHe opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent\nanguish.\n\nThe queen stretched out her hand, seized the ring, pressed it\nconvulsively to her lips--and without being able to breathe a sigh, to\ngive vent to a sob, she extended her arms, became deadly pale, and fell\nsenseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter.\n\nAthos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising, with a\ndignity that made a deep impression on those around:\n\n\"I, the Comte de la Fere, a gentleman who has never deceived any human\nbeing, swear before God and before this unhappy queen, that all that was\npossible to save the king of England was done whilst we were on English\nground. Now, chevalier,\" he added, turning to Aramis, \"let us go. Our\nduty is fulfilled.\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" said Aramis; \"we have still a word to say to these\ngentlemen.\"\n\nAnd turning to Chatillon: \"Sir, be so good as not to go away without\ngiving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the\nqueen.\"\n\nChatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out, stopping at\nthe window of a gallery on the ground floor.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Aramis, \"you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most\nextraordinary manner. That would not be endurable in any case, and\nis still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the\nmessage of a liar.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" cried De Chatillon.\n\n\"What have you done with Monsieur de Bruy? Has he by any possibility\ngone to change his face which was too like that of Monsieur de Mazarin?\nThere is an abundance of Italian masks at the Palais Royal, from\nharlequin even to pantaloon.\"\n\n\"Chevalier! chevalier!\" said Athos.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" said Aramis impatiently. \"You know well that I don't\nlike to leave things half finished.\"\n\n\"Conclude, then, sir,\" answered De Chatillon, with as much hauteur as\nAramis.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" resumed Aramis, \"any one but the Comte de la Fere and\nmyself would have had you arrested--for we have friends in Paris--but\nwe are contented with another course. Come and converse with us for just\nfive minutes, sword in hand, upon this deserted terrace.\"\n\n\"One moment, gentlemen,\" cried Flamarens. \"I know well that the\nproposition is tempting, but at present it is impossible to accept it.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Aramis, in his tone of raillery. \"Is it Mazarin's\nproximity that makes you so prudent?\"\n\n\"Oh, you hear that, Flamarens!\" said Chatillon. \"Not to reply would be a\nblot on my name and my honor.\"\n\n\"That is my opinion,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"You will not reply, however, and these gentlemen, I am sure, will\npresently be of my opinion.\"\n\nAramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence.\n\nChatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword.\n\n\"Willingly,\" replied De Chatillon.\n\n\"Duke,\" said Flamarens, \"you forget that to-morrow you are to command an\nexpedition of the greatest importance, projected by the prince, assented\nto by the queen. Until to-morrow evening you are not at your own\ndisposal.\"\n\n\"Let it be then the day after to-morrow,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"To-morrow, rather,\" said De Chatillon, \"if you will take the trouble of\ncoming so far as the gates of Charenton.\"\n\n\"How can you doubt it, sir? For the pleasure of a meeting with you I\nwould go to the end of the world.\"\n\n\"Very well, to-morrow, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall rely on it. Are you going to rejoin your cardinal? Swear first,\non your honor, not to inform him of our return.\"\n\n\"Conditions?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is for victors to make conditions, and you are not yet\nvictors, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Then let us draw on the spot. It is all one to us--to us who do not\ncommand to-morrow's expedition.\"\n\nChatillon and Flamarens looked at each other. There was such irony\nin the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great\ndifficulty in bridling his anger, but at a word from Flamarens he\nrestrained himself and contented himself with saying:\n\n\"You promise, sir--that's agreed--that I shall find you to-morrow at\nCharenton?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be afraid, sir,\" replied Aramis; and the two gentlemen\nshortly afterward left the Louvre.\n\n\"For what reason is all this fume and fury?\" asked Athos. \"What have\nthey done to you?\"\n\n\"They--did you not see what they did?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in England. Now,\nif they believed us, they laughed in order to insult us; if they did not\nbelieve it they insulted us all the more. However, I'm glad not to\nfight them until to-morrow. I hope we shall have something better to do\nto-night than to draw the sword.\"\n\n\"What have we to do?\"\n\n\"Egad! to take Mazarin.\"\n\nAthos curled his lip with disdain.\n\n\"These undertakings do not suit me, as you know, Aramis.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it is taking people unawares.\"\n\n\"Really, Athos, you would make a singular general. You would fight only\nby broad daylight, warn your foe before an attack, and never attempt\nanything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the\ndarkness.\"\n\nAthos smiled.\n\n\"You know one cannot change his nature,\" he said. \"Besides, do you know\nwhat is our situation, and whether Mazarin's arrest wouldn't be rather\nan encumbrance than an advantage?\"\n\n\"Say at once you disapprove of my proposal.\"\n\n\"I think you ought to do nothing, since you exacted a promise from these\ngentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in France.\"\n\n\"I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free. Come,\ncome.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon, and to tell\nthem about this.\"\n\n\"Yes, but on one condition--that we begin by the coadjutor. He is a\npriest, learned in cases of conscience, and we will tell him ours.\"\n\nIt was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon,\nas his house came first; but first of all Athos begged that he might go\nto the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne, to see Raoul.\n\nThey re-entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence\nproceeded to the Halles; and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois, they went\non foot to the Rue Guenegaud.\n\nBut Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne. He had received\na message from the prince, to whom he had hastened with Olivain the\ninstant he had received it.\n\n\n\n\n77. The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo.\n\n\n\nThe night was dark, but still the town resounded with those noises that\ndisclose a city in a state of siege. Athos and Aramis did not proceed\na hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the\nbarricades, who demanded the watchword; and on their saying that they\nwere going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide\nwas given them under pretext of conducting them, but in fact as a spy\nover their movements.\n\nOn arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of\nthree cavaliers, who seemed to know every possible password; for they\nwalked without either guide or escort, and on arriving at the barricades\nhad nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them, who instantly\nlet them pass with evident deference, due probably to their high birth.\n\nOn seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Aramis, \"do you see, count?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be?\"\n\n\"What do you think, Aramis?\"\n\n\"Why, they are our men.\"\n\n\"You are not mistaken; I recognize Monsieur de Flamarens.\"\n\n\"And I, Monsieur de Chatillon.\"\n\n\"As to the cavalier in the brown cloak----\"\n\n\"It is the cardinal.\"\n\n\"In person.\"\n\n\"How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon?\"\n\nAthos smiled, but did not reply. Five minutes afterward they knocked at\nthe prince's door.\n\nThis door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed\nin the courtyard, ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Conti's\nlieutenant.\n\nMonsieur de Bouillon had the gout, but notwithstanding his illness,\nwhich had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month---that\nis, since Paris had been besieged--he was ready to receive the Comte de\nla Fere and the Chevalier d'Herblay.\n\nHe was in bed, but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war.\nEverywhere were swords, pistols, cuirasses, and arquebuses, and it was\nplain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would\ngive a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel.\nMeanwhile, to his great regret, as he said, he was obliged to keep his\nbed.\n\n\"Ah, gentlemen,\" he cried, as the two friends entered, \"you are very\nhappy! you can ride, you can go and come and fight for the cause of\nthe people. But I, as you see, am nailed to my bed--ah! this demon,\ngout--this demon, gout!\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"we are just arrived from England and our first\nconcern is to inquire after your health.\"\n\n\"Thanks, gentlemen, thanks! As you see, my health is but indifferent.\nBut you come from England. And King Charles is well, as I have just\nheard?\"\n\n\"He is dead, my lord!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the duke, too much astonished to believe it true.\n\n\"Dead on the scaffold; condemned by parliament.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"And executed in our presence.\"\n\n\"What, then, has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Flamarens?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has just gone out.\"\n\nAthos smiled. \"With two companions?\" he said.\n\n\"With two companions, yes,\" replied the duke. Then he added with a\ncertain uneasiness, \"Did you meet them?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I think so--in the street,\" said Athos; and he looked\nsmilingly at Aramis, who looked at him with an expression of surprise.\n\n\"The devil take this gout!\" cried Monsieur de Bouillon, evidently ill at\nease.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"we admire your devotion to the cause you have\nespoused, in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill, in so much\npain.\"\n\n\"One must,\" replied Monsieur de Bouillon, \"sacrifice one's comfort to\nthe public good; but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted. My\nspirit is willing, my head is clear, but this demon, the gout, o'ercrows\nme. I confess, if the court would do justice to my claims and give the\nhead of my house the title of prince, and if my brother De Turenne were\nreinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the\ncourt and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might.\"\n\n\"You are perfectly right, my lord.\"\n\n\"You think so? At this very moment the court is making overtures to me;\nhitherto I have repulsed them; but since such men as you assure me that\nI am wrong in doing so, I've a good mind to follow your advice and to\naccept a proposition made to me by the Duc de Chatillon just now.\"\n\n\"Accept it, my lord, accept it,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Faith! yes. I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsed--but\nthere will be a conference to-morrow and we shall see.\"\n\nThe two friends saluted the duke.\n\n\"Go, gentlemen,\" he said; \"you must be much fatigued after your voyage.\nPoor King Charles! But, after all, he was somewhat to blame in all that\nbusiness and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France\nhas no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh! as to that,\" said Aramis, \"we are witnesses. Mazarin\nespecially----\"\n\n\"Yes, do you know, I am very glad to hear you give that testimony; the\ncardinal has some good in him, and if he were not a foreigner--well, he\nwould be more justly estimated. Oh! the devil take this gout!\"\n\nAthos and Aramis took their leave, but even in the ante-chamber they\ncould still hear the duke's cries; he was evidently suffering the\ntortures of the damned.\n\nWhen they reached the street, Aramis said:\n\n\"Well, Athos, what do you think?\"\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"Pardieu! of Monsieur de Bouillon.\"\n\n\"My friend, I think that he is much troubled with gout.\"\n\n\"You noticed that I didn't breathe a word as to the purpose of our\nvisit?\"\n\n\"You did well; you would have caused him an access of his disease. Let\nus go to Monsieur de Beaufort.\"\n\nThe two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome. It was ten o'clock when\nthey arrived. The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the\nHotel de Bouillon, and presented as warlike an appearance. There were\nsentinels, a guard in the court, stacks of arms, and horses saddled.\nTwo horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give\nplace to them.\n\n\"Ah! ah! gentlemen,\" said Aramis, \"decidedly it is a night for meetings.\nWe shall be very unfortunate if, after meeting so often this evening, we\nshould not succeed in meeting to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that, sir,\" replied Chatillon (for it was he who, with\nFlamarens, was leaving the Duc de Beaufort), \"you may be assured; for if\nwe meet by night without seeking each other, much more shall we meet by\nday when wishing it.\"\n\n\"I hope that is true,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"As for me, I am sure of it,\" said the duke.\n\nDe Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and\nAramis dismounted.\n\nHardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and\nrid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them, and after\nlooking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung\nin the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran\nto embrace them.\n\n\"Comte de la Fere!\" the man cried out; \"Chevalier d'Herblay! How does it\nhappen that you are in Paris?\"\n\n\"Rochefort!\" cried the two friends.\n\n\"Yes! we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois, as you know,\nand we are going to give Mazarin something to do. You are still with us,\nI presume?\"\n\n\"More than ever. And the duke?\"\n\n\"Furious against the cardinal. You know his success--our dear duke? He\nis really king of Paris; he can't go out without being mobbed by his\nadmirers.\"\n\n\"Ah! so much the better! Can we have the honor of seeing his highness?\"\n\n\"I shall be proud to present you,\" and Rochefort walked on. Every door\nwas opened to him. Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper, but he rose\nquickly on hearing the two friends announced.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"by Jove! you're welcome, sirs. You are coming to sup\nwith me, are you not? Boisgoli, tell Noirmont that I have two guests.\nYou know Noirmont, do you not? The successor of Father Marteau who makes\nthe excellent pies you know of. Boisgoli, let him send one of his best,\nbut not such a one as he made for La Ramee. Thank God! we don't want\neither rope ladders or gag-pears now.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"do not let us disturb you. We came merely to\ninquire after your health and to take your orders.\"\n\n\"As to my health, since it has stood five years of prison, with Monsieur\nde Chavigny to boot, 'tis excellent! As to my orders, since every one\ngives his own commands in our party, I shall end, if this goes on, by\ngiving none at all.\"\n\n\"In short, my lord,\" said Athos, glancing at Aramis, \"your highness is\ndiscontented with your party?\"\n\n\"Discontented, sir! say my highness is furious! To such a degree, I\nassure you, though I would not say so to others, that if the queen,\nacknowledging the injuries she has done me, would recall my mother and\ngive me the reversion of the admiralty, which belonged to my father and\nwas promised me at his death, well! it would not be long before I should\nbe training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in France than\nthe Cardinal Mazarin!\"\n\nAt this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but\na smile; and had they not known it for a fact, this would have told them\nthat De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Athos, \"we are satisfied; we came here only to express\nour loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship's service and his\nmost faithful servants.\"\n\n\"My most faithful friends, gentlemen, my most faithful friends; you have\nproved it. And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to\nyou, I hope, that I remain your friend, as well as that of--what the\ndevil are their names--D'Artagnan and Porthos?\"\n\n\"D'Artagnan and Porthos.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. You understand, then, Comte de la Fere, you understand,\nChevalier d'Herblay, that I am altogether and always at your service.\"\n\nAthos and Aramis bowed and went out.\n\n\"My dear Athos,\" cried Aramis, \"I think you consented to accompany me\nonly to give me a lesson--God forgive me!\"\n\n\"Wait a little, Aramis; it will be time for you to perceive my motive\nwhen we have paid our visit to the coadjutor.\"\n\n\"Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace,\" said Aramis.\n\nThey directed their horses to the city. On arriving at the cradle from\nwhich Paris sprang they found it inundated with water, and it was again\nnecessary to take a boat. The palace rose from the bosom of the water,\nand to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one's\nself not in Paris, but in Venice. Some of these boats were dark and\nmysterious, others noisy and lighted up with torches. The friends slid\nin through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn. The\npalace was surrounded with water, but a kind of staircase had been\nfixed to the lower walls; and the only difference was, that instead of\nentering by the doors, people entered by the windows.\n\nThus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the ante-chamber,\nwhere about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Aramis to Athos, \"does the coadjutor intend to\nindulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his\nante-chamber?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, we must take people as we find them. The coadjutor is\nat this moment one of the seven kings of Paris, and has a court. Let us\nsend in our names, and if he does not send us a suitable message we\nwill leave him to his own affairs or those of France. Let us call one of\nthese lackeys, with a demi-pistole in the left hand.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" cried Aramis. \"Ah! if I'm not mistaken here's Bazin. Come\nhere, fellow.\"\n\nBazin, who was crossing the ante-chamber majestically in his clerical\ndress, turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus\naddressed him; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and\nexpressed delight at seeing them.\n\n\"A truce to compliments,\" said Aramis; \"we want to see the coadjutor,\nand instantly, as we are in haste.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir--it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to\nwait in the ante-chamber, only just now he has a secret conference with\nMonsieur de Bruy.\"\n\n\"De Bruy!\" cried the friends, \"'tis then useless our seeing monsieur the\ncoadjutor this evening,\" said Aramis, \"so we give it up.\"\n\nAnd they hastened to quit the palace, followed by Bazin, who was lavish\nof bows and compliments.\n\n\"Well,\" said Athos, when Aramis and he were in the boat again, \"are you\nbeginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all\nthese people in arresting Mazarin?\"\n\n\"You are wisdom incarnate, Athos,\" Aramis replied.\n\nWhat had especially been observed by the two friends was the little\ninterest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which\nhad occurred in England, which they thought should have arrested the\nattention of all Europe.\n\nIn fact, aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the\ncorner of the Louvre, no one appeared to be aware that Charles I. had\never lived and that he had perished on the scaffold.\n\nThe two friends made an appointment for ten o'clock on the following\nday; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door\nof the hotel, Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make\nand left Athos to enter alone.\n\nAt ten o'clock the next day they met again. Athos had been out since six\no'clock.\n\n\"Well, have you any news?\" Athos asked.\n\n\"Nothing. No one has seen D'Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared. Have\nyou anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Athos, \"this delay is not natural; they took the\nshortest route and should have arrived before we did.\"\n\n\"Add to that D'Artagnan's rapidity in action and that he is not the man\nto lose an hour, knowing that we were expecting him.\"\n\n\"He expected, you will remember, to be here on the fifth.\"\n\n\"And here we are at the ninth. This evening the margin of possible delay\nexpires.\"\n\n\"What do you think should be done,\" asked Athos, \"if we have no news of\nthem to-night?\"\n\n\"Pardieu! we must go and look for them.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Athos.\n\n\"But Raoul?\" said Aramis.\n\nA light cloud passed over the count's face.\n\n\"Raoul gives me much uneasiness,\" he said. \"He received yesterday a\nmessage from the Prince de Conde; he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and\nhas not returned.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse?\"\n\n\"She was not at home. And you, Aramis, you were going, I think, to visit\nMadame de Longueville.\"\n\n\"I did go there.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"She was no longer there, but she had left her new address.\"\n\n\"Where was she?\"\n\n\"Guess; I give you a thousand chances.\"\n\n\"How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists\nwas at midnight? for I presume it was when you left me that you went to\nvisit her.\"\n\n\"At the Hotel de Ville, my dear fellow.\"\n\n\"What! at the Hotel de Ville? Has she, then, been appointed provost of\nmerchants?\"\n\n\"No; but she has become queen of Paris, ad interim, and since she could\nnot venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the\nTuileries, she is installed at the Hotel de Ville, where she is on the\npoint of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke.\"\n\n\"You didn't tell me of that, Aramis.\"\n\n\"Really? It was my forgetfulness then; pardon me.\"\n\n\"Now,\" asked Athos, \"what are we to do with ourselves till evening? Here\nwe are without occupation, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"You forget, my friend, that we have work cut out for us in the\ndirection of Charenton; I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon, whom I've\nhated for a long time, there.\"\n\n\"Why have you hated him?\"\n\n\"Because he is the brother of Coligny.\"\n\n\"Ah, true! he who presumed to be a rival of yours, for which he was\nseverely punished; that ought to satisfy you.\"\n\n\"'Yes, but it does not; I am rancorous--the only stigma that proves me\nto be a churchman. Do you understand? You understand that you are in no\nway obliged to go with me.\"\n\n\"Come, now,\" said Athos, \"you are joking.\"\n\n\"In that case, my dear friend, if you are resolved to accompany me there\nis no time to lose; the drum beats; I observed cannon on the road; I\nsaw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville;\ncertainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton, as the Duc de\nChatillon said.\"\n\n\"I supposed,\" said Athos, \"that last night's conferences would modify\nthose warlike arrangements.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but they will fight, none the less, if only to mask the\nconferences.\"\n\n\"Poor creatures!\" said Athos, \"who are going to be killed, in order that\nMonsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him, that\nthe reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort, and\nthat the coadjutor may be made a cardinal.\"\n\n\"Come, come, dear Athos, confess that you would not be so philosophical\nif your Raoul were to be involved in this affair.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you speak the truth, Aramis.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go, then, where the fighting is, for that is the most\nlikely place to meet with D'Artagnan, Porthos, and possibly even Raoul.\nStop, there are a fine body of citizens passing; quite attractive, by\nJupiter! and their captain--see! he has the true military style.\"\n\n\"What, ho!\" said Grimaud.\n\n\"What?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Planchet, sir.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant yesterday,\" said Aramis, \"captain to-day, colonel,\ndoubtless, to-morrow; in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Question him about the fight,\" said Athos.\n\nPlanchet, prouder than ever of his new duties, deigned to explain to the\ntwo gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place\nRoyale with two hundred men, forming the rear of the army of Paris, and\nto march on Charenton when necessary.\n\n\"This day will be a warm one,\" said Planchet, in a warlike tone.\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Aramis, \"but it is far from here to the enemy.\"\n\n\"Sir, the distance will be diminished,\" said a subordinate.\n\nAramis saluted, then turning toward Athos:\n\n\"I don't care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people,\" he\nsaid. \"Shall we go forward? We shall see better what is going on.\"\n\n\"And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to\nlook for you. Come, then, my friend, we will go forward.\"\n\n\"Haven't you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own\naccount?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Athos, \"I have made a resolution never to draw my\nsword save when it is absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"And how long ago was that?\"\n\n\"When I last drew my poniard.\"\n\n\"Ah! Good! another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt. Well, my friend,\nnothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having\nkilled that fellow.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Athos, putting a finger on his lips, with the sad smile\npeculiar to him; \"let us talk no more of Mordaunt--it will bring bad\nluck.\" And Athos set forward toward Charenton, followed closely by\nAramis.\n\n\n\n\n78. The Battle of Charenton.\n\n\n\nAs Athos and Aramis proceeded, and passed different companies on the\nroad, they became aware that they were arriving near the field of\nbattle.\n\n\"Ah! my friend!\" cried Athos, suddenly, \"where have you brought us?\nI fancy I perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal\narmy; is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming toward us with his\nbrigadiers?\"\n\n\"Good-day, sirs,\" said the duke, advancing; \"you are puzzled by what you\nsee here, but one word will explain everything. There is now a truce and\na conference. The prince, Monsieur de Retz, the Duc de Beaufort, the Duc\nde Bouillon, are talking over public affairs. Now one of two things must\nhappen: either matters will not be arranged, or they will be arranged,\nin which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still\nmeet again.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Aramis, \"you speak to the point. Allow me to ask you a\nquestion: Where are the plenipotentiaries?\"\n\n\"At Charenton, in the second house on the right on entering from the\ndirection of Paris.\"\n\n\"And was this conference arranged beforehand?\"\n\n\"No, gentlemen, it seems to be the result of certain propositions which\nMazarin made last night to the Parisians.\"\n\nAthos and Aramis exchanged smiles; for they well knew what those\npropositions were, to whom they had been made and who had made them.\n\n\"And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are,\" asked Athos,\n\"belongs to----\"\n\n\"To Monsieur de Chanleu, who commands your troops at Charenton. I say\nyour troops, for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs?\"\n\n\"Yes, almost,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"We are for the king and the princes,\" added Athos.\n\n\"We must understand each other,\" said the duke. \"The king is with us and\nhis generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Conde, although\nI must add 'tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one\nbelongs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Athos, \"but his right place is in our ranks, with the\nPrince de Conti, De Beaufort, D'Elbeuf, and De Bouillon; but, sir,\nsupposing that the conference is broken off--are you going to try to\ntake Charenton?\"\n\n\"Such are my orders.\"\n\n\"Sir, since you command the cavalry----\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I am commander-in-chief.\"\n\n\"So much the better. You must know all your officers--I mean those more\ndistinguished.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, very nearly.\"\n\n\"Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the Chevalier\nd'Artagnan, lieutenant in the musketeers?\"\n\n\"No, sir, he is not with us; he left Paris more than six weeks ago and\nis believed to have gone on a mission to England.\"\n\n\"I knew that, but I supposed he had returned.\"\n\n\"No, sir; no one has seen him. I can answer positively on that point,\nfor the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon, the\nsubstitute for Monsieur d'Artagnan, still holds his place.\"\n\nThe two friends looked at each other.\n\n\"You see,\" said Athos.\n\n\"It is strange,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on\nthe way.\"\n\n\"If we have no news of them this evening, to-morrow we must start.\"\n\nAthos nodded affirmatively, then turning:\n\n\"And Monsieur de Bragelonne, a young man fifteen years of age, attached\nto the Prince de Conde--has he the honor of being known to you?\"\ndiffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were\nhis paternal feelings.\n\n\"Yes, surely, he came with the prince; a charming young man; he is one\nof your friends then, monsieur le comte?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Athos, agitated; \"so much so that I wish to see him\nif possible.\"\n\n\"Quite possible, sir; do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct\nyou to headquarters.\"\n\n\"Halloo, there!\" cried Aramis, turning around; \"what a noise behind us!\"\n\n\"A body of cavaliers is coming toward us,\" said Chatillon.\n\n\"I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat.\"\n\n\"And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers.\"\n\n\"They are coming, full gallop; the prince is with them--ah! he is\nleaving them!\"\n\n\"They are beating the rappel!\" cried Chatillon; \"we must discover what\nis going on.\"\n\nIn fact, they saw the soldiers running to their arms; the trumpets\nsounded; the drums beat; the Duc de Beaufort drew his sword. On his side\nthe prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army,\nmingling momentarily with the Parisian troops, ran to him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Chatillon, \"the truce is broken, that is evident;\nthey are going to fight; go, then, into Charenton, for I shall begin in\na short time--there's a signal from the prince!\"\n\nThe cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the\nprince.\n\n\"Farewell, till the next time we meet,\" cried Chatillon, and he set off,\nfull gallop.\n\nAthos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the\nDuc de Beaufort. As to the Duc de Bouillon, he had such a fit of gout\nas obliged him to return to Paris in a litter; but his place was well\nfilled by the Duc d'Elbeuf and his four sons, ranged around him like a\nstaff. Meantime, between Charenton and the royal army was left a space\nwhich looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried the coadjutor, tightening his sash, which he\nwore, after the fashion of the ancient military prelates, over his\narchiepiscopal simar, \"there's the enemy approaching. Let us save them\nhalf of their journey.\"\n\nAnd without caring whether he were followed or not he set off; his\nregiment, which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth, from the name\nof his archbishopric, darted after him and began the fight. Monsieur de\nBeaufort sent his cavalry, toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu, who\ndefended the place, was ready to resist an assault, or if the enemy were\nrepulsed, to attempt a sortie.\n\nThe battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles\nof valor. His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was\ndelighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard, no matter for\nwhom or against whom.\n\nChanleu, whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment, thought\nthat the moment was come to pursue it; but it was reformed and led again\nto the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in person. This charge was so\nfierce, so skillfully conducted, that Chanleu was almost surrounded. He\ncommanded a retreat, which began, step by step, foot by foot; unhappily,\nin an instant he fell, mortally wounded. De Chatillon saw him fall and\nannounced it in a loud voice to his men, which raised their spirits and\ncompletely disheartened their enemies, so that every man thought only of\nhis own safety and tried to gain the trenches, where the coadjutor was\ntrying to reform his disorganized regiment.\n\nSuddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal\ntroops, who were entering, pele-mele, the intrenchments with the\nfugitives. Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons;\nAramis with sword and pistol in his hands, Athos with his sword in his\nscabbard, his pistol in his saddle-bags; calm and cool as if on the\nparade, except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he\nsaw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the\nobstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the\nprinces. Aramis, on the contrary, struck right and left and was almost\ndelirious with excitement. His bright eyes kindled, and his mouth, so\nfinely formed, assumed a wicked smile; every blow he aimed was sure, and\nhis pistol finished the deed--annihilated the wounded wretch who tried\nto rise again.\n\nOn the opposite side two cavaliers, one covered with a gilt cuirass, the\nother wearing simply a buff doublet, from which fell the sleeves of a\nvest of blue velvet, charged in front. The cavalier in the gilt cuirass\nfell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted\nskill.\n\n\"Ah! 'tis you, Monsieur de Chatillon,\" cried the chevalier; \"welcome to\nyou--I expected you.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not made you wait too long, sir,\" said the duke; \"at all\nevents, here I am.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Chatillon,\" cried Aramis, taking from his saddle-bags a\nsecond pistol, \"I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a\ndead man.\"\n\n\"Thank God, sir, they are not!\"\n\nAnd the duke, pointing his pistol at Aramis, fired. But Aramis bent his\nhead the instant he saw the duke's finger press the trigger and the ball\npassed without touching him.\n\n\"Oh! you've missed me,\" cried Aramis, \"but I swear to Heaven! I will not\nmiss you.\"\n\n\"If I give you time!\" cried the duke, spurring on his horse and rushing\nupon him with his drawn sword.\n\nAramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on\nsuch occasions, and Athos, who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis\nwith the rapidity of lightning, was just going to cry out, \"Fire! fire,\nthen!\" when the shot was fired. De Chatillon opened his arms and fell\nback on the crupper of his horse.\n\nThe ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass.\n\n\"I am a dead man,\" he said, and fell from his horse to the ground.\n\n\"I told you this, I am now grieved I have kept my word. Can I be of any\nuse to you?\"\n\nChatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount\nwhen he received a violent shock; 'twas a thrust from a sword, but his\ncuirass turned aside the blow.\n\nHe turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist, when he\nstarted back, exclaiming, \"Raoul!\"\n\n\"Raoul?\" cried Athos.\n\nThe young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father\nand the Chevalier d'Herblay; two officers in the Parisian forces rushed\nat that instant on Raoul, but Aramis protected him with his sword.\n\n\"My prisoner!\" he cried.\n\nAthos took his son's horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the\nmelee.\n\nAt this crisis of the battle, the prince, who had been seconding De\nChatillon in the second line, appeared in the midst of the fight; his\neagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero.\n\nOn seeing him, the regiment of Corinth, which the coadjutor had not been\nable to reorganize in spite of all his efforts, threw itself into the\nmidst of the Parisian forces, put them into confusion and re-entered\nCharenton flying. The coadjutor, dragged along with his fugitive forces,\npassed near the group formed by Athos, Raoul and Aramis. Aramis could\nnot in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor's misfortune,\nand was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct, when Athos\nstopped him.\n\n\"On, on!\" he cried, \"this is no moment for compliments; or rather, back,\nfor the battle seems to be lost by the Frondeurs.\"\n\n\"It is a matter of indifference to me,\" said Aramis; \"I came here only\nto meet De Chatillon; I have met him, I am contented; 'tis something to\nhave met De Chatillon in a duel!\"\n\n\"And besides, we have a prisoner,\" said Athos, pointing to Raoul.\n\nThe three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop.\n\n\"What were you doing in the battle, my friend?\" inquired Athos of the\nyouth; \"'twas not your right place, I think, as you were not equipped\nfor an engagement!\"\n\n\"I had no intention of fighting to-day, sir; I was charged, indeed,\nwith a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil, when, seeing\nMonsieur de Chatillon charge, an invincible desire possessed me to\ncharge at his side. It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the\nParisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"What! you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the\nchevalier?\"\n\n\"I did not recognize the chevalier in armor, sir!\" said Raoul, blushing;\n\"though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the compliment, my young friend,\" replied Aramis, \"we can\nsee from whom you learned courtesy. Then you were going to Rueil?\"\n\n\"Yes! I have a despatch from the prince to his eminence.\"\n\n\"You must still deliver it,\" said Athos.\n\n\"No false generosity, count! the fate of our friends, to say nothing of\nour own, is perhaps in that very despatch.\"\n\n\"This young man must not, however, fail in his duty,\" said Athos.\n\n\"In the first place, count, this youth is our prisoner; you seem to\nforget that. What I propose to do is fair in war; the vanquished must\nnot be dainty in the choice of means. Give me the despatch, Raoul.\"\n\nThe young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his\neyes a rule of conduct.\n\n\"Give him the despatch, Raoul! you are the chevalier's prisoner.\"\n\nRaoul gave it up reluctantly; Aramis instantly seized and read it.\n\n\"You,\" he said, \"you, who are so trusting, read and reflect that there\nis something in this letter important for us to see.\"\n\nAthos took the letter, frowning, but an idea that he should find\nsomething in this letter about D'Artagnan conquered his unwillingness to\nread it.\n\n\"My lord, I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to\nreinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges, the ten men you demand.\nThey are good soldiers, fit to confront the two violent adversaries\nwhose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Athos.\n\n\"Well,\" said Aramis, \"what think you about these two enemies whom it\nrequires, besides Comminges's troop, ten good soldiers to confront; are\nthey not as like as two drops of water to D'Artagnan and Porthos?\"\n\n\"We'll search Paris all day long,\" said Athos, \"and if we have no news\nthis evening we will return to the road to Picardy; and I feel no doubt\nthat, thanks to D'Artagnan's ready invention, we shall then find some\nclew which will solve our doubts.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has\nyet heard from his former master.\"\n\n\"That poor Planchet! You speak of him very much at your ease, Aramis; he\nhas probably been killed. All those fighting citizens went out to battle\nand they have been massacred.\"\n\nIt was, then, with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet, who\nalone could give them information, was alive or dead, that the friends\nreturned to the Place Royale; to their great surprise they found the\ncitizens still encamped there, drinking and bantering each other,\nalthough, doubtless, mourned by their families, who thought they were at\nCharenton in the thickest of the fighting.\n\nAthos and Aramis again questioned Planchet, but he had seen nothing of\nD'Artagnan; they wished to take Planchet with them, but he could not\nleave his troop, who at five o'clock returned home, saying that they\nwere returning from the battle, whereas they had never lost sight of the\nbronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII.\n\n\n\n\n79. The Road to Picardy.\n\n\n\nOn leaving Paris, Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be\nencountering great danger; but we know that for men like these there\ncould be no question of danger. Besides, they felt that the denouement\nof this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single\neffort to make.\n\nBesides, there was no tranquillity in Paris itself. Provisions began to\nfail, and whenever one of the Prince de Conti's generals wished to gain\nmore influence he got up a little popular tumult, which he put down\nagain, and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues.\n\nIn one of these risings, the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and\nlibrary of Mazarin, in order to give the populace, as he put\nit, something to gnaw at. Athos and Aramis left Paris after this\ncoup-d'etat, which took place on the very evening of the day in which\nthe Parisians had been beaten at Charenton.\n\nThey quitted Paris, beholding it abandoned to extreme want, bordering\non famine; agitated by fear, torn by faction. Parisians and Frondeurs\nas they were, the two friends expected to find the same misery, the\nsame fears, the same intrigue in the enemy's camp; but what was their\nsurprise, after passing Saint Denis, to hear that at Saint Germain\npeople were singing and laughing, and leading generally cheerful lives.\nThe two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the\nMazarinists scattered about the Isle of France, and also to escape the\nFrondeurs, who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed\nto conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville, in order that he might\nascertain whether they were friends or foes. Having escaped these\ndangers, they returned by the main road to Boulogne, at Abbeville, and\nfollowed it step by step, examining every track.\n\nNevertheless, they were still in a state of uncertainty. Several inns\nwere visited by them, several innkeepers questioned, without a single\nclew being given to guide their inquiries, when at Montreuil Athos felt\nupon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers.\nHe turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the\nwood with a knife:\n\n\"Port.... D'Art.... 2d February.\"\n\n\"This is capital!\" said Athos to Aramis, \"we were to have slept\nhere, but we cannot--we must push on.\" They rode forward and reached\nAbbeville. There the great number of inns puzzled them; they could not\ngo to all; how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking\nhad stayed?\n\n\"Trust me,\" said Aramis, \"do not expect to find anything in Abbeville.\nIf we had only been looking for Porthos, Porthos would have stationed\nhimself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him.\nBut D'Artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses. Porthos would have found it\nvery difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger; he has\ngone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere\nelse.\"\n\nThey continued their route. It had now become a weary and almost\nhopeless task, and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor,\nfriendship and gratitude, implanted in their hearts, our two travelers\nwould have given up many a time their rides over the sand, their\ninterrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces.\n\nThey proceeded thus to Peronne.\n\nAthos began to despair. His noble nature felt that their ignorance was\na sort of reflection upon them. They had not looked carefully enough for\ntheir lost friends. They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their\ninquiries. They were willing and ready to retrace their steps, when, in\ncrossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town, upon a white\nwall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart,\nAthos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk, which represented,\nwith the awkwardness of a first attempt, two cavaliers riding furiously;\none of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words:\n\"They are following us.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Athos, \"here it is, as clear as day; pursued as he was,\nD'Artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed\nvery closely, which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in\nescaping.\"\n\nAramis shook his head.\n\n\"Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken\nof.\"\n\n\"You are right, Aramis, let us travel on.\"\n\nTo describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be\nimpossible. Uneasiness took possession of the tender, constant heart of\nAthos, and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis.\nThey galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers\non the wall. All at once, in a narrow pass, they perceived that the road\nwas partially barricaded by an enormous stone. It had evidently been\nrolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength.\n\nAramis stopped.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, looking at the stone, \"this is the work of either\nHercules or Porthos. Let us get down, count, and examine this rock.\"\n\nThey both alighted. The stone had been brought with the evident\nintention of barricading the road, but some one having perceived the\nobstacle had partially turned it aside.\n\nWith the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in\nturning the stone over. Upon the side next the ground were scratched the\nfollowing words:\n\n\n\n\"Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us. If we reach Compiegne we\nshall stop at the Peacock. It is kept by a friend of ours.\"\n\n\n\n\"At last we have something definite,\" said Athos; \"let us go to the\nPeacock.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Aramis, \"but if we are to get there we must rest our\nhorses, for they are almost broken-winded.\"\n\nAramis was right; they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse\nswallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine; they gave them three\nhours' rest and then set off again. The men themselves were almost dead\nwith fatigue, but hope supported them.\n\nIn six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock. The\nhost proved to be a worthy man, as bald as a Chinaman. They asked him\nif some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were\npursued by dragoons; without answering he went out and brought in the\nblade of a rapier.\n\n\"Do you know that?\" he asked.\n\nAthos merely glanced at it.\n\n\"'Tis D'Artagnan's sword,\" he said.\n\n\"Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?\" asked the\nhost.\n\n\"To the smaller.\"\n\n\"I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Well, what has happened to them?\"\n\n\"They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons, who rode into the\ncourtyard before they had time to close the gate.\"\n\n\"Eight!\" said Aramis; \"it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos\nand D'Artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight\nmen.\"\n\n\"The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by\ntwenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the king's service, who\nare in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by\nnumbers.\"\n\n\"Arrested, were they?\" inquired Athos; \"is it known why?\"\n\n\"No, sir, they were carried off instantly, and had not even time to tell\nme why; but as soon as they were gone I found this broken sword-blade,\nas I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones.\"\n\n\"'Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Where were they taken?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Toward the town of Louvres,\" was the reply.\n\nThe two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne\nwith the horses, resolved to take post horses; and having snatched a\nhasty dinner they continued their journey to Louvres. Here they found\nonly one inn, in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its\nreputation to our time and which is still made in that town.\n\n\"Let us alight here,\" said Athos. \"D'Artagnan will not have let slip an\nopportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur, and at the same time\nleaving some trace of himself.\"\n\nThey went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur, at the\ncounter--as their friends must have done before them. The counter was\ncovered with a plate of pewter; upon this plate was written with the\npoint of a large pin: \"Rueil... D..\"\n\n\"They went to Rueil,\" cried Aramis.\n\n\"Let us go to Rueil,\" said Athos.\n\n\"It is to throw ourselves into the wolf's jaws,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of D'Artagnan I should\nhave followed him even into the inside of the whale itself; and you\nwould have done the same, Aramis.\"\n\n\"Certainly--but you make me out better than I am, dear count. Had I been\nalone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution. But\nwhere you go, I go.\"\n\nThey then set off for Rueil. Here the deputies of the parliament had\njust arrived, in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were\nto last three weeks, and produced eventually that shameful peace, at\nthe conclusion of which the prince was arrested. Rueil was crowded with\nadvocates, presidents and councillors, who came from the Parisians, and,\non the side of the court, with officers and guards; it was therefore\neasy, in the midst of this confusion, to remain as unobserved as any one\nmight wish; besides, the conferences implied a truce, and to arrest two\ngentlemen, even Frondeurs, at this time, would have been an attack on\nthe rights of the people.\n\nThe two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was\noccupied with the same thought that tormented them. They expected to\nhear some mention made of D'Artagnan or of Porthos, but every one was\nengrossed by articles and reforms. It was the advice of Athos to go\nstraight to the minister.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Aramis, \"take care; our safety lies in our obscurity.\nIf we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our\nfriends in some deep ditch, from which the devil himself could not\ntake us out. Let us try not to find them out by accident, but from our\nnotions. Arrested at Compiegne, they have been carried to Rueil; at\nRueil they have been questioned by the cardinal, who has either kept\nthem near him or sent them to Saint Germain. As to the Bastile, they are\nnot there, though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs. They are\nnot dead, for the death of D'Artagnan would make a sensation. As for\nPorthos, I believe him to be eternal, like God, although less patient.\nDo not let us despond, but wait at Rueil, for my conviction is that they\nare at Rueil. But what ails you? You are pale.\"\n\n\"It is this,\" answered Athos, with a trembling voice.\n\n\"I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some\nhorrible 'oubliettes' constructed.\"\n\n\"Oh! never fear,\" said Aramis. \"Richelieu was a gentleman, our equal\nin birth, our superior in position. He could, like the king, touch the\ngreatest of us on the head, and touching them make such heads shake on\ntheir shoulders. But Mazarin is a low-born rogue, who can at the most\ntake us by the collar, like an archer. Be calm--for I am sure that\nD'Artagnan and Porthos are at Rueil, alive and well.\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed Athos, \"I recur to my first proposal. I know no better\nmeans than to act with candor. I shall seek, not Mazarin, but the queen,\nand say to her, 'Madame, restore to us your two servants and our two\nfriends.'\"\n\nAramis shook his head.\n\n\"'Tis a last resource, but let us not employ it till it is imperatively\ncalled for; let us rather persevere in our researches.\"\n\nThey continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who\nhad formed one of the guard which had escorted D'Artagnan to Rueil.\n\nAthos, however, perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the\nqueen.\n\n\"In order to see the queen,\" said Aramis, \"we must first see the\ncardinal; and when we have seen the cardinal--remember what I tell you,\nAthos--we shall be reunited to our friends, but not in the way you wish.\nNow, that way of joining them is not very attractive to me, I confess.\nLet us act in freedom, that we may act well and quickly.\"\n\n\"I shall go,\" he said, \"to the queen.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" answered Aramis, \"pray tell me a day or two beforehand,\nthat I may take that opportunity of going to Paris.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"Zounds! how do I know? perhaps to Madame de Longueville. She is\nall-powerful yonder; she will help me. But send me word should you be\narrested, for then I will return directly.\"\n\n\"Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Should we, by being arrested, be all four together again, we should\nnot, I am not sure, be twenty-four hours in prison without getting\nfree.\"\n\n\"My friend, since I killed Chatillon, adored of the ladies of Saint\nGermain, I am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly. The\nqueen is likely to follow Mazarin's counsels and to have me tried.\"\n\n\"Do you think she loves this Italian so much as they say she does?\"\n\n\"Did she not love an Englishman?\"\n\n\"My friend, she is a woman.\"\n\n\"No, no, you are deceived--she is a queen.\"\n\n\"Dear friend, I shall sacrifice myself and go and see Anne of Austria.\"\n\n\"Adieu, Athos, I am going to raise an army.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"To come back and besiege Rueil.\"\n\n\"Where shall we meet again?\"\n\n\"At the foot of the cardinal's gallows.\"\n\nThe two friends departed--Aramis to return to Paris, Athos to take\nmeasures preparatory to an interview with the queen.\n\n\n\n\n80. The Gratitude of Anne of Austria.\n\n\n\nAthos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an\naudience of Anne of Austria. It was granted, and was to take place after\nher morning's \"levee,\" at which, in accordance with his rights of birth,\nhe was entitled to be present. A vast crowd filled the apartments of\nSaint Germain. Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court; but\nthis crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility, while the\nPrince de Conti, the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around\nthem the first nobility of France.\n\nThe greatest possible gayety prevailed at court. The particular\ncharacteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired\nduring its continuance. The court made songs on the Parisians and the\nParisians on the court; and the casualties, though not mortal, were\npainful, as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule.\n\nIn the midst of this seeming hilarity, nevertheless, people's minds were\nuneasy. Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen?\nWas he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there? Every\none hoped so, so that the minister felt that all around him, beneath the\nhomage of the courtiers, lay a fund of hatred, ill disguised by fear and\ninterest. He felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do.\n\nConde himself, whilst fighting for him, lost no opportunity of\nridiculing, of humbling him. The queen, on whom he threw himself as sole\nsupport, seemed to him now not much to be relied upon.\n\nWhen the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged\nto stay until the queen, who was waited upon by a new deputation from\nParis, had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner\nof receiving them. All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the\nday; Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to\nspeak of his friends--poor atoms, lost in that raging whirlwind.\n\nBut Athos was a man of inflexible determination; he firmly adhered to a\npurpose once formed, when it seemed to him to spring from conscience\nand to be prompted by a sense of duty. He insisted on being introduced,\nsaying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti, or\nMonsieur de Beaufort, or Monsieur de Bouillon, or Monsieur d'Elbeuf, or\nthe coadjutor, or Madame de Longueville, or Broussel, or the Parliament,\nand although he had come on his own private account, he nevertheless had\nthings to say to her majesty of the utmost importance.\n\nThe conference being finished, the queen summoned him to her cabinet.\n\nAthos was introduced and announced by name. It was a name that too often\nresounded in her majesty's ears and too often vibrated in her heart for\nAnne of Austria not to recognize it; yet she remained impassive, looking\nat him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are\nqueens, either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth.\n\n\"It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?\" asked Anne\nof Austria, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Yes, madame, another service,\" said Athos, shocked that the queen did\nnot seem to recognize him.\n\nAthos had a noble heart, and made, therefore, but a poor courtier.\n\nAnne frowned. Mazarin, who was sitting at a table folding up papers, as\nif he had only been a secretary of state, looked up.\n\n\"Speak,\" said the queen.\n\nMazarin turned again to his papers.\n\n\"Madame,\" resumed Athos, \"two of my friends, named D'Artagnan\nand Monsieur du Vallon, sent to England by the cardinal, suddenly\ndisappeared when they set foot on the shores of France; no one knows\nwhat has become of them.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said the queen.\n\n\"I address myself, therefore, first to the benevolence of your majesty,\nthat I may know what has become of my friends, reserving to myself, if\nnecessary, the right of appealing hereafter to your justice.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Anne, with a degree of haughtiness which to certain\npersons became impertinence, \"this is the reason that you trouble me in\nthe midst of so many absorbing concerns! an affair for the police! Well,\nsir, you ought to know that we no longer have a police, since we are no\nlonger at Paris.\"\n\n\"I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know\nwhere my friends are, but that if you will deign to interrogate the\ncardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own\nrecollections.\"\n\n\"But, God forgive me!\" cried Anne, with that disdainful curl of the lips\npeculiar to her, \"I believe that you are yourself interrogating.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, here I have a right to do so, for it concerns Monsieur\nd'Artagnan---d'Artagnan,\" he repeated, in such a manner as to bow the\nregal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman.\n\nThe cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of\nAnne.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"I can tell you what is at present unknown to her\nmajesty. These individuals are under arrest. They disobeyed orders.\"\n\n\"I beg of your majesty, then,\" said Athos, calmly and not replying to\nMazarin, \"to quash these arrests of Messieurs d'Artagnan and du Vallon.\"\n\n\"What you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern\nme,\" said the queen.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service\nof your majesty was concerned,\" said Athos, bowing with great dignity.\nHe was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him.\n\n\"You, too, have been in England, sir?\" he said, making a sign to the\nqueen, who was evidently going to issue a severe order.\n\n\"I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I. Poor king! culpable, at\nthe most, of weakness, how cruelly punished by his subjects! Thrones are\nat this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to\nserve the interests of princes. This is the second time that Monsieur\nd'Artagnan has been in England. He went the first time to save the honor\nof a great queen; the second, to avert the death of a great king.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Anne to Mazarin, with an accent from which daily habits of\ndissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression, \"see if we\ncan do something for these gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I wish to do, madame, all that your majesty pleases.\"\n\n\"Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests; that is your name, is it not,\nsir?\"\n\n\"I have another name, madame--I am called Athos.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Mazarin, with a smile, \"you may rest easy; your wishes\nshall be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"You hear, sir?\" said the queen.\n\n\"Yes, madame, I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty.\nMay I not go and see my friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you shall see them. But, apropos, you belong to the Fronde,\ndo you not?\"\n\n\"Madame, I serve the king.\"\n\n\"Yes, in your own way.\"\n\n\"My way is the way of all gentlemen, and I know only one way,\" answered\nAthos, haughtily.\n\n\"Go, sir, then,\" said the queen; \"you have obtained what you wish and we\nknow all we desire to know.\"\n\nScarcely, however, had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to\nMazarin:\n\n\"Cardinal, desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves\nthe court.\"\n\n\"Your majesty,\" answered Mazarin, \"desires me to do only what I was\ngoing to ask you to let me do. These bravoes who resuscitate in our\nepoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome; since there are\ntwo of them already there, let us add a third.\"\n\nAthos was not altogether the queen's dupe, but he was not a man to run\naway on suspicion--above all, when distinctly told that he should see\nhis friends again. He waited, then, in the ante-chamber with impatience,\ntill he should be conducted to them.\n\nHe walked to the window and looked into the court. He saw the deputation\nfrom the Parisians enter it; they were coming to assign the definitive\nplace for the conference and to make their bow to the queen. A very\nimposing escort awaited them without the gates.\n\nAthos was looking on attentively, when some one touched him softly on\nthe shoulder.\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur de Comminges,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, count, and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to\naccept my excuses.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Be so good as to give me up your sword, count.\"\n\nAthos smiled and opened the window.\n\n\"Aramis!\" he cried.\n\nA gentleman turned around. Athos fancied he had seen him among the\ncrowd. It was Aramis. He bowed with great friendship to the count.\n\n\"Aramis,\" cried Athos, \"I am arrested.\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Aramis, calmly.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Athos, turning to Comminges and giving him politely his\nsword by the hilt, \"here is my sword; have the kindness to keep it\nsafely for me until I quit my prison. I prize it--it was given to\nmy ancestor by King Francis I. In his time they armed gentlemen, not\ndisarmed them. Now, whither do you conduct me?\"\n\n\"Into my room first,\" replied Comminges; \"the queen will ultimately\ndecide your place of domicile.\"\n\nAthos followed Comminges without saying a single word.\n\n\n\n\n81. Cardinal Mazarin as King.\n\n\n\nThe arrest produced no sensation, indeed was almost unknown, and\nscarcely interrupted the course of events. To the deputation it was\nformally announced that the queen would receive it.\n\nAccordingly, it was admitted to the presence of Anne, who, silent and\nlofty as ever, listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies;\nbut when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say, so\ncalm remained her face, whether or no she had heard them.\n\nOn the other hand, Mazarin, present at that audience, heard very well\nwhat those deputies demanded. It was purely and simply his removal, in\nterms clear and precise.\n\nThe discourse being finished, the queen remained silent.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mazarin, \"I join with you in supplicating the queen to\nput an end to the miseries of her subjects. I have done all in my power\nto ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public, you say, is that\nthey proceed from me, an unhappy foreigner, who has been unable to\nplease the French. Alas! I have never been understood, and no wonder. I\nsucceeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre\nof France. The memory of Richelieu annihilates me. In vain--were I an\nambitious man--should I struggle against such remembrances as he has\nleft; but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you. I own\nmyself conquered. I shall obey the wishes of the people. If Paris has\ninjuries to complain of, who has not some wrongs to be redressed? Paris\nhas been sufficiently punished; enough blood has flowed, enough misery\nhas humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice. 'Tis not for me,\na private individual, to disunite a queen from her kingdom. Since you\ndemand my resignation, I retire.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Aramis, in his neighbor's ear, \"the conferences are over.\nThere is nothing to do but to send Monsieur Mazarin to the most distant\nfrontier and to take care that he does not return even by that, nor any\nother entrance into France.\"\n\n\"One instant, sir,\" said the man in a gown, whom he addressed; \"a plague\non't! how fast you go! one may soon see that you're a soldier. There's\nthe article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and\nset to rights.\"\n\n\"Chancellor,\" said the queen, turning to Seguier, our old acquaintance,\n\"you will open the conferences. They can take place at Rueil. The\ncardinal has said several things which have agitated me, therefore I\nwill not speak more fully now. As to his going or staying, I feel too\nmuch gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions;\nhe shall do what he wishes to do.\"\n\nA transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime\nminister; he looked at the queen with anxiety. Her face was so\npassionless, that he, as every one else present, was incapable of\nreading her thoughts.\n\n\"But,\" added the queen, \"in awaiting the cardinal's decision let there\nbe, if you please, a reference to the king only.\"\n\nThe deputies bowed and left the room.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the queen, when the last of them had quitted the\napartment, \"you would yield to these limbs of the law--these advocates?\"\n\n\"To promote your majesty's welfare, madame,\" replied Mazarin, fixing his\npenetrating eyes on the queen, \"there is no sacrifice that I would not\nmake.\"\n\nAnne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual\nwith her. A recollection of Athos came into her mind. His fearless\ndeportment, his words, so firm, yet dignified, the shades which by one\nword he had evoked, recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of\npoetry and romance, youth, beauty, the eclat of love at twenty years\nof age, the bloody death of Buckingham, the only man whom she had ever\nreally loved, and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved\nher from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king.\n\nMazarin looked at her, and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed\nfrom the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts, he\nread her thoughts in her countenance, as one sees in a transparent lake\nclouds pass--reflections, like thoughts, of the heavens.\n\n\"Must we, then,\" asked Anne of Austria, \"yield to the storm, buy peace,\nand patiently and piously await better times?\"\n\nMazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech, which showed that she had\ntaken the minister's proposal seriously.\n\nAnne's head was bent down--she had not seen the Italian's smile; but\nfinding that her question elicited no reply she looked up.\n\n\"Well, you do not answer, cardinal, what do you think about it?\"\n\n\"I am thinking, madame, of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman,\nwhom you have caused to be arrested, to the Duke of Buckingham--to him\nwhom you allowed to be assassinated--to the Duchess de Chevreuse, whom\nyou suffered to be exiled--to the Duc de Beaufort, whom you imprisoned;\nbut if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the\nrelation in which I stand to you.\"\n\nAnne drew up, as she always did, when anything touched her pride. She\nblushed, and that she might not answer, clasped her beautiful hands till\nher sharp nails almost pierced them.\n\n\"That man has sagacity, honor and wit, not to mention likewise that he\nis a man of undoubted resolution. You know something about him, do you\nnot, madame? I shall tell him, therefore, and in doing so I shall confer\na personal favor on him, how he is mistaken in regard to me. What\nis proposed to me would be, in fact, almost an abdication, and an\nabdication requires reflection.\"\n\n\"An abdication?\" repeated Anne; \"I thought, sir, that it was kings alone\nwho abdicated!\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mazarin, \"and am I not almost a king--king, indeed, of\nFrance? Thrown over the foot of the royal bed, my simar, madame, looks\nnot unlike the mantle worn by kings.\"\n\nThis was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more\nfrequently than any other, and one that bowed her head with shame. Queen\nElizabeth and Catherine II. of Russia are the only two monarchs of their\nset on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers. Anne of\nAustria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the\ncardinal--his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain\ngrandeur.\n\n\"Sir,\" she replied, \"did I not say, and did you not hear me say to those\npeople, that you should do as you pleased?\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Mazarin, \"I think it must please me best to remain;\nnot only on account of my own interest, but for your safety.\"\n\n\"Remain, then, sir; nothing can be more agreeable to me; only do not\nallow me to be insulted.\"\n\n\"You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which\nthey stated them? Patience! They have selected a field of battle on\nwhich I am an abler general than they--that of a conference. No, we\nshall beat them by merely temporizing. They want food already. They will\nbe ten times worse off in a week.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! Good heavens! I know it will end in that way; but it is not\nthey who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches, but----\"\n\n\"I understand; you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually\nrevived by these three gentlemen. However, we have them safe in prison,\nand they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison\nas long as we find it convenient. One only is still not in our power and\nbraves us. But, devil take him! we shall soon succeed in sending him\nto join his boon companions. We have accomplished more difficult things\nthan that. In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil,\nnear me, under my own eyes, within reach of my hand, the two most\nintractable ones. To-day the third will be there also.\"\n\n\"As long as they are in prison all will be well,\" said Anne, \"but one of\nthese days they will get out.\"\n\n\"Yes, if your majesty releases them.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Anne, following the train of her own thoughts on such\noccasions, \"one regrets Paris!\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"On account of the Bastile, sir, which is so strong and so secure.\"\n\n\"Madame, these conferences will bring us peace; when we have peace we\nshall regain Paris; with Paris, the Bastile, and our four bullies shall\nrot therein.\"\n\nAnne frowned slightly when Mazarin, in taking leave, kissed her hand.\n\nMazarin, after this half humble, half gallant attention, went away. Anne\nfollowed him with her eyes, and as he withdrew, at every step he took, a\ndisdainful smile was seen playing, then gradually burst upon her lips.\n\n\"I once,\" she said, \"despised the love of a cardinal who never said 'I\nshall do,' but, 'I have done so and so.' That man knew of retreats\nmore secure than Rueil, darker and more silent even than the Bastile.\nDegenerate world!\"\n\n\n\n\n82. Precautions.\n\n\n\nAfter quitting Anne, Mazarin took the road to Rueil, where he usually\nresided; in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous\nfollowers and often disguised himself. In military dress he was, indeed,\nas we have stated, a very handsome man.\n\nIn the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach,\nand reached the Seine at Chatou. The prince had supplied him with fifty\nlight horse, not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how\nreadily the queen's generals dispersed their troops and to prove that\nthey might be safely scattered at pleasure. Athos, on horseback, without\nhis sword and kept in sight by Comminges, followed the cardinal in\nsilence. Grimaud, finding that his master had been arrested, fell back\ninto the ranks near Aramis, without saying a word and as if nothing had\nhappened.\n\nGrimaud had, indeed, during twenty-two years of service, seen his master\nextricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than\nAthos's imminent death was likely to make him uneasy.\n\nAt the branching off of the road toward Paris, Aramis, who had followed\nin the cardinal's suite, turned back. Mazarin went to the right hand and\nAramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue.\nAthos, at the same moment, moved by a similar impulse, looked back also.\nThe two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis\nput his finger to his hat, as if to bow, Athos alone comprehending by\nthat signal that he had some project in his head.\n\nTen minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which\nhis predecessor had built for him at Rueil; as he alighted, Comminges\napproached him.\n\n\"My lord,\" he asked, \"where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la\nFere to be lodged?\"\n\n\"In the pavilion of the orangery, of course, in front of the pavilion\nwhere the guard is. I wish every respect to be shown the count, although\nhe is the prisoner of her majesty the queen.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" answered Comminges, \"he begs to be taken to the place where\nMonsieur d'Artagnan is confined--that is, in the hunting lodge, opposite\nthe orangery.\"\n\nMazarin thought for an instant.\n\nComminges saw that he was undecided.\n\n\"'Tis a very strong post,\" he resumed, \"and we have forty good men,\ntried soldiers, having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in\nthe Fronde.\"\n\n\"If we put these three men together, Monsieur Comminges,\" said Mazarin,\n\"we must double the guard, and we are not rich enough in fighting men to\ncommit such acts of prodigality.\"\n\nComminges smiled; Mazarin read and construed that smile.\n\n\"You do not know these men, Monsieur Comminges, but I know them, first\npersonally, also by hearsay. I sent them to carry aid to King Charles\nand they performed prodigies to save him; had it not been for an adverse\ndestiny, that beloved monarch would this day have been among us.\"\n\n\"But since they served your eminence so well, why are they, my lord\ncardinal, in prison?\"\n\n\"In prison?\" said Mazarin, \"and when has Rueil been a prison?\"\n\n\"Ever since there were prisoners in it,\" answered Comminges.\n\n\"These gentlemen, Comminges, are not prisoners,\" returned Mazarin, with\nhis ironical smile, \"only guests; but guests so precious that I have put\na grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors, that\nthey may not refuse to continue my visitors. So much do I esteem\nthem that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit, that I may\nconverse with him tete-a-tete, and that we may not be disturbed at our\ninterview you must conduct him, as I said before, to the pavilion of the\norangery; that, you know, is my daily promenade. Well, while taking my\nwalk I will call on him and we will talk. Although he professes to be my\nenemy I have sympathy for him, and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall\narrange matters.\"\n\nComminges bowed, and returned to Athos, who was awaiting with apparent\ncalmness, but with real anxiety, the result of the interview.\n\n\"Well?\" he said to the lieutenant.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Comminges, \"it seems that it is impossible.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Comminges,\" said Athos, \"I have been a soldier all my\nlife and I know the force of orders; but outside your orders there is a\nservice you can render me.\"\n\n\"I will do it with all my heart,\" said Comminges; \"for I know who you\nare and what service you once performed for her majesty; I know, too,\nhow dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid\nwhen that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested. I am entirely at your\nservice, except only for my orders.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any\ndegree.\"\n\n\"If it should even compromise me a little,\" said Monsieur de Comminges,\nwith a smile, \"still make your demand. I don't like Mazarin any better\nthan you do. I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the\nservice of the cardinal; but I serve the one with joy and the other\nagainst my will. Speak, then, I beg of you; I wait and listen.\"\n\n\"Since there is no harm,\" said Athos, \"in my knowing that D'Artagnan is\nhere, I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am here.\"\n\n\"I have received no orders on that point.\"\n\n\"Well, then, do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him\nthat I am his neighbor. Tell him also what you have just told me--that\nMazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make\nme a visit, and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor\nhe proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our\ncaptivity.\"\n\n\"Which cannot last,\" interrupted Comminges; \"the cardinal said so; there\nis no prison here.\"\n\n\"But there are oubliettes!\" replied Athos, smiling.\n\n\"Oh! that's a different thing; yes, I know there are traditions of that\nsort,\" said Comminges. \"It was in the time of the other cardinal, who\nwas a great nobleman; but our Mazarin--impossible! an Italian adventurer\nwould not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves. Oubliettes\nare employed as a means of kingly vengeance, and a low-born fellow such\nas he is would not have recourse to them. Your arrest is known, that of\nyour friends will soon be known; and all the nobility of France would\ndemand an explanation of your disappearance. No, no, be easy on that\nscore. I will, however, inform Monsieur d'Artagnan of your arrival\nhere.\"\n\nComminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a\npavilion, at the end of the orangery. They passed through a courtyard as\nthey went, full of soldiers and courtiers. In the centre of this court,\nin the form of a horseshoe, were the buildings occupied by Mazarin, and\nat each wing the pavilion (or smaller building), where D'Artagnan was\nconfined, and that, level with the orangery, where Athos was to be. From\nthe ends of these two wings extended the park.\n\nAthos, when he reached his appointed room, observed through the gratings\nof his window, walls and roofs; and was told, on inquiry, by Comminges,\nthat he was looking on the back of the pavilion where D'Artagnan was\nconfined.\n\n\"Yes, 'tis too true,\" said Comminges, \"'tis almost a prison; but what a\nsingular fancy this is of yours, count--you, who are the very flower of\nour nobility--to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts,\nthe Frondists! Really, count, if ever I thought that I had a friend in\nthe ranks of the royal army, it was you. A Frondeur! you, the Comte de\nla Fere, on the side of Broussel, Blancmesnil and Viole! For shame! you,\na Frondeur!\"\n\n\"On my word of honor,\" said Athos, \"one must be either a Mazarinist or a\nFrondeur. For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears, and\nI chose the latter; at any rate, it is a French word. And now, I am a\nFrondeur--not of Broussel's party, nor of Blancmesnil's, nor am I with\nViole; but with the Duc de Beaufort, the Ducs de Bouillon and d'Elbeuf;\nwith princes, not with presidents, councillors and low-born lawyers.\nBesides, what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the\ncardinal! Look at that wall--without a single window--which tells you\nfine things about Mazarin's gratitude!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied De Comminges, \"more especially if it could reveal how\nMonsieur d'Artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him.\"\n\n\"Poor D'Artagnan'\" said Athos, with the charming melancholy that was one\nof the traits of his character, \"so brave, so good, so terrible to the\nenemies of those he loves. You have two unruly prisoners there, sir.\"\n\n\"Unruly,\" Comminges smiled; \"you wish to terrify me, I suppose. When\nhe came here, Monsieur D'Artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and\ninferior officers, in order, I suppose, to have his sword back. That\nmood lasted some time; but now he's as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon\nsongs, which make one die of laughing.\"\n\n\"And Du Vallon?\" asked Athos.\n\n\"Ah, he's quite another sort of person--a formidable gentleman, indeed.\nThe first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his\nshoulder; and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as\nSamson left Gaza. But his temper cooled down, like his friend's; he not\nonly gets used to his captivity, but jokes about it.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Do you think anything else was to be expected of them?\" asked\nComminges, who, putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners\nand what the Comte de la Fere had said, began to feel a degree of\nuneasiness.\n\nAthos, on the other hand, reflected that this recent gentleness of\nhis friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by D'Artagnan.\nUnwilling to injure them by praising them too highly, he replied: \"They?\nThey are two hotheads--the one a Gascon, the other from Picardy; both\nare easily excited, but they quiet down immediately. You have had a\nproof of that in what you have just related to me.\"\n\nThis, too, was the opinion of Comminges, who withdrew somewhat\nreassured. Athos remained alone in the vast chamber, where, according to\nthe cardinal's directions, he was treated with all the courtesy due to\na nobleman. He awaited Mazarin's promised visit to get some light on his\npresent situation.\n\n\n\n\n83. Strength and Sagacity.\n\n\n\nNow let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge. At the extremity of\nthe courtyard, where, close to a portico formed of Ionic columns, were\nthe dog kennels, rose an oblong building, the pavilion of the orangery,\na half circle, inclosing the court of honor. It was in this pavilion, on\nthe ground floor, that D'Artagnan and Porthos were confined, suffering\ninterminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each\ndifferent temperament.\n\nD'Artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger; with dilated eyes,\ngrowling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard\nof servant's offices.\n\nPorthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished.\n\nThe one seemed to be deprived of reason, yet he was meditating. The\nother seemed to meditate, yet he was more than half asleep. But his\nsleep was a nightmare, which might be guessed by the incoherent manner\nin which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted.\n\n\"Look,\" said D'Artagnan, \"day is declining. It must be nearly four\no'clock. We have been in this place nearly eighty-three hours.\"\n\n\"Hem!\" muttered Porthos, with a kind of pretense of answering.\n\n\"Did you hear, eternal sleeper?\" cried D'Artagnan, irritated that any\none could doze during the day, when he had the greatest difficulty in\nsleeping during the night.\n\n\"What?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I say we have been here eighty-three hours.\"\n\n\"'Tis your fault,\" answered Porthos.\n\n\"How, my fault?\"\n\n\"Yes, I offered you escape.\"\n\n\"By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Porthos, men like us can't go out from here purely and simply.\"\n\n\"Faith!\" said Porthos, \"as for me, I could go out with that purity and\nthat simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much.\"\n\nD'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"And besides,\" he said, \"going out of this chamber isn't all.\"\n\n\"Dear friend,\" said Porthos, \"you appear to be in a somewhat better\nhumor to-day than you were yesterday. Explain to me why going out of\nthis chamber isn't everything.\"\n\n\"Because, having neither arms nor password, we shouldn't take fifty\nsteps in the court without knocking against a sentinel.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Porthos, \"we will kill the sentinel and we shall have\nhis arms.\"\n\n\"Yes, but before we can kill him--and he will be hard to kill, that\nSwiss--he will shriek out and the whole picket will come, and we shall\nbe taken like foxes, we, who are lions, and thrown into some dungeon,\nwhere we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful\ngray sky of Rueil, which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the\nmoon is like the sun. Lack-a-day! if we only had some one to instruct\nus about the physical and moral topography of this castle. Ah! when one\nthinks that for twenty years, during which time I did not know what to\ndo with myself, it never occurred to me to come to study Rueil.\"\n\n\"What difference does that make?\" said Porthos. \"We shall go out all the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Do you know, my dear fellow, why master pastrycooks never work with\ntheir hands?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Porthos, \"but I should be glad to be informed.\"\n\n\"It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of\ntheir tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Why, then they would be laughed at, and a master pastrycook must never\nbe laughed at.\"\n\n\"And what have master pastrycooks to do with us?\"\n\n\"We ought, in our adventures, never to be defeated or give any one a\nchance to laugh at us. In England, lately, we failed, we were beaten,\nand that is a blemish on our reputation.\"\n\n\"By whom, then, were we beaten?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"By Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we have drowned Monsieur Mordaunt.\"\n\n\"That is true, and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of\nposterity, if posterity ever looks at us. But listen, Porthos: though\nMonsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised, Mazarin is not less\nstrong than he, and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him. We\nmust, therefore, watch and play a close game; for,\" he added with a\nsigh, \"we two are equal, perhaps, to eight others; but we are not equal\nto the four that you know of.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Porthos, echoing D'Artagnan's sigh.\n\n\"Well, Porthos, follow my examples; walk back and forth till some news\nof our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea. But\ndon't sleep as you do all the time; nothing dulls the intellect like\nsleep. As to what may lie before us, it is perhaps less serious than\nwe at first thought. I don't believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks\nof cutting off our heads, for heads are not taken off without previous\ntrial; a trial would make a noise, and a noise would get the attention\nof our friends, who would check the operations of Monsieur de Mazarin.\"\n\n\"How well you reason!\" said Porthos, admiringly.\n\n\"Well, yes, pretty well,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"and besides, you see,\nif they put us on trial, if they cut off our heads, they must meanwhile\neither keep us here or transfer us elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is inevitable,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Well, it is impossible but that Master Aramis, that keen-scented\nbloodhound, and Athos, that wise and prudent nobleman, will discover our\nretreat. Then, believe me, it will be time to act.\"\n\n\"Yes, we will wait. We can wait the more contentedly, that it is not\nabsolutely bad here, but for one thing, at least.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Did you observe, D'Artagnan, that three days running they have brought\nus braised mutton?\"\n\n\"No; but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it, so never\nmind.\"\n\n\"And then I feel the loss of my house, 'tis a long time since I visited\nmy castles.\"\n\n\"Forget them for a time; we shall return to them, unless Mazarin razes\nthem to the ground.\"\n\n\"Do you think that likely?\"\n\n\"No, the other cardinal would have done so, but this one is too mean a\nfellow to risk it.\"\n\n\"You reconcile me, D'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Well, then, assume a cheerful manner, as I do; we must joke with the\nguards, we must gain the good-will of the soldiers, since we can't\ncorrupt them. Try, Porthos, to please them more than you are wont to do\nwhen they are under our windows. Thus far you have done nothing but show\nthem your fist; and the more respectable your fist is, Porthos, the\nless attractive it is. Ah, I would give much to have five hundred louis,\nonly.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Porthos, unwilling to be behind D'Artagnan in\ngenerosity; \"I would give as much as a hundred pistoles.\"\n\nThe two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when\nComminges entered, preceded by a sergeant and two men, who brought\nsupper in a basket with two handles, filled with basins and plates.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Porthos, \"mutton again?\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur de Comminges,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you will find that\nmy friend, Monsieur du Vallon, will go to the most fatal lengths if\nCardinal Mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat; mutton\nevery day.\"\n\n\"I declare,\" said Porthos, \"I shall eat nothing if they do not take it\naway.\"\n\n\"Remove the mutton,\" cried Comminges; \"I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup\nwell, more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his\nappetite.\"\n\n\"Is Mazarin dead?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"No; I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well.\"\n\n\"So much the worse,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"What is that news?\" asked D'Artagnan. \"News in prison is a fruit\nso rare that I trust, Monsieur de Comminges, you will excuse my\nimpatience--the more eager since you have given us to understand that\nthe news is good.\"\n\n\"Should you be glad to hear that the Comte de la Fere is well?\" asked De\nComminges.\n\nD'Artagnan's penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost.\n\n\"Glad!\" he cried; \"I should be more than glad! Happy--beyond measure!\"\n\n\"Well, I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that\nhe is in good health.\"\n\nD'Artagnan almost leaped with joy. A quick glance conveyed his thought\nto Porthos: \"If Athos knows where we are, if he opens communication with\nus, before long Athos will act.\"\n\nPorthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances, but\nnow since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea, he\nunderstood.\n\n\"Do you say,\" asked the Gascon, timidly, \"that the Comte de la Fere\nhas commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and\nmyself?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you have seen him?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have.\"\n\n\"Where? if I may ask without indiscretion.\"\n\n\"Near here,\" replied De Comminges, smiling; \"so near that if the windows\nwhich look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from\nwhere you are.\"\n\n\"He is wandering about the environs of the castle,\" thought D'Artagnan.\nThen he said aloud:\n\n\"You met him, I dare say, in the park--hunting, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No; nearer, nearer still. Look, behind this wall,\" said De Comminges,\nknocking against the wall.\n\n\"Behind this wall? What is there, then, behind this wall? I was brought\nhere by night, so devil take me if I know where I am.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Comminges, \"suppose one thing.\"\n\n\"I will suppose anything you please.\"\n\n\"Suppose there were a window in this wall.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at his.\"\n\n\"The count, then, is in the chateau?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For what reason?\"\n\n\"The same as yourself.\"\n\n\"Athos--a prisoner?\"\n\n\"You know well,\" replied De Comminges, \"that there are no prisoners at\nRueil, because there is no prison.\"\n\n\"Don't let us play upon words, sir. Athos has been arrested.\"\n\n\"Yesterday, at Saint Germain, as he came out from the presence of the\nqueen.\"\n\nThe arms of D'Artagnan fell powerless by his side. One might have\nsupposed him thunderstruck; a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark\nskin, but disappeared immediately.\n\n\"A prisoner?\" he reiterated.\n\n\"A prisoner,\" repeated Porthos, quite dejected.\n\nSuddenly D'Artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which\nscarcely even Porthos observed; but it died away and he appeared more\nsorrowful than before.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Comminges, who, since D'Artagnan, on the day of\nBroussel's arrest, had saved him from the hands of the Parisians, had\nentertained a real affection for him, \"don't be unhappy; I never thought\nof bringing you bad news. Laugh at the chance which has brought your\nfriend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon, instead of being in the\ndepths of despair about it.\"\n\nBut D'Artagnan was still in a desponding mood.\n\n\"And how did he look?\" asked Porthos, who, perceiving that D'Artagnan\nhad allowed the conversation to drop, profited by it to put in a word or\ntwo.\n\n\"Very well, indeed, sir,\" replied Comminges; \"at first, like you, he\nseemed distressed; but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay\nhim a visit this very evening----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"the cardinal is about to visit the Comte de la\nFere?\"\n\n\"Yes; and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage\nof this visit to plead for you and for himself.\"\n\n\"Ah! our dear count!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"A fine thing, indeed!\" grunted Porthos. \"A great favor! Zounds!\nMonsieur the Comte de la Fere, whose family is allied to the Montmorency\nand the Rohan, is easily the equal of Monsieur de Mazarin.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said D'Artagnan, in his most wheedling tone. \"On\nreflection, my dear Du Vallon, it is a great honor for the Comte de la\nFere, and gives good reason to hope. In fact, it seems to me so great\nan honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"What? I am mistaken?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere, but\nthe Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Comminges, who made a point of having the facts\nappear exactly as they were, \"I clearly understood what the cardinal\nsaid to me. He will come and visit the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\nD'Artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether\nPorthos understood the importance of that visit, but Porthos did not\neven look toward him.\n\n\"It is, then, the cardinal's custom to walk in his orangery?\" asked\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"Every evening he shuts himself in there. That, it seems, is where he\nmeditates on state affairs.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I begin to believe that Monsieur de la\nFere will receive the visit of his eminence; he will, of course, have an\nescort.\"\n\n\"Yes--two soldiers.\"\n\n\"And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?\"\n\n\"The soldiers are Swiss, who understand only German. Besides, according\nto all probability they will wait at the door.\"\n\nD'Artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from\nbeing too expressive.\n\n\"Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la\nFere,\" said D'Artagnan; \"for the count must be furious.\"\n\nComminges began to laugh. \"Oh, oh! why, really, one would say that you\nfour were anthropaphagi! The count is an affable man; besides, he is\nunarmed; at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him\nwould run to his assistance.\"\n\n\"Two soldiers,\" said D'Artagnan, seeming to remember something, \"two\nsoldiers, yes; that, then, is why I hear two men called every evening\nand see them walking sometimes for half an hour, under my window.\"\n\n\"That is it; they are waiting for the cardinal, or rather for Bernouin,\nwho comes to call them when the cardinal goes out.\"\n\n\"Fine-looking men, upon my word!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"They belong to the regiment that was at Lens, which the prince assigned\nto the cardinal.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, as if to sum up in a word all that\nconversation, \"if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur\nde la Fere our liberty.\"\n\n\"I wish it with all my heart,\" said Comminges.\n\n\"Then, if he should forget that visit, you would find no inconvenience\nin reminding him of it?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Ah, that gives me more confidence.\"\n\nThis skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime\nmanoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascon's soul.\n\n\"Now,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I've one last favor to ask of you, Monsieur de\nComminges.\"\n\n\"At your service, sir.\"\n\n\"You will see the count again?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same\nfavor that he will have obtained?\"\n\n\"You want the cardinal to come here?\"\n\n\"No; I know my place and am not so presumptuous. Let his eminence do me\nthe honor to give me a hearing; that is all I want.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" muttered Porthos, shaking his head, \"never should I have thought\nthis of him! How misfortune humbles a man!\"\n\n\"I promise you it shall be done,\" answered De Comminges.\n\n\"Tell the count that I am well; that you found me sad, but resigned.\"\n\n\"I am pleased, sir, to hear that.\"\n\n\"And the same, also, for Monsieur du Vallon----\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" cried Porthos; \"I am not by any means resigned.\"\n\n\"But you will be resigned, my friend.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"He will become so, monsieur; I know him better than he knows himself.\nBe silent, dear Du Vallon, and resign yourself.\"\n\n\"Adieu, gentlemen,\" said De Comminges; \"sleep well!\"\n\n\"We will try.\"\n\nDe Comminges went away, D'Artagnan remaining apparently in the same\nattitude of humble resignation; but scarcely had he departed when he\nturned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be\ndoubted.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Porthos; \"what's the matter now? Have you gone mad, my dear\nfriend?\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" returned D'Artagnan; \"we are saved!\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" answered Porthos. \"I think we are all taken\nprisoners, except Aramis, and that our chances of getting out are\nlessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarin's mousetrap.\"\n\n\"Which is far too strong for two of us, but not strong enough for three\nof us,\" returned D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Never mind; let's sit down to table and take something to strengthen us\nfor the night.\"\n\n\"What are we to do, then, to-night?\"\n\n\"To travel--perhaps.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"Sit down, dear friend, to table. When one is eating, ideas flow easily.\nAfter supper, when they are perfected, I will communicate my plans to\nyou.\"\n\nSo Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an\nappetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him\nby D'Artagnan's inventive imagination.\n\n\n\n\n84. Strength and Sagacity--Continued.\n\n\n\nSupper was eaten in silence, but not in sadness; for from time to time\none of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of\ngood-humor illumined the face of D'Artagnan. Not a scintilla of these\nwas lost on Porthos; and at every one he uttered an exclamation which\nbetrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which\npossessed his brain.\n\nAt dessert D'Artagnan reposed in his chair, crossed one leg over the\nother and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease.\n\nPorthos rested his chin on his hands, placed his elbows on the table and\nlooked at D'Artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to\nthat colossus an admirable appearance of good-fellowship.\n\n\"Well?\" said D'Artagnan, at last.\n\n\"Well!\" repeated Porthos.\n\n\"You were saying, my dear friend----\"\n\n\"No; I said nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes; you were saying you wished to leave this place.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! the will was never wanting.\"\n\n\"To get away you would not mind, you added, knocking down a door or a\nwall.\"\n\n\"'Tis true--I said so, and I say it again.\"\n\n\"And I answered you, Porthos, that it was not a good plan; that we\ncouldn't go a hundred steps without being recaptured, because we were\nwithout clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves.\"\n\n\"That is true; we should need clothes and arms.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said D'Artagnan, rising, \"we have them, friend Porthos, and even\nsomething better.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Porthos, looking around.\n\n\"Useless to look; everything will come to us when wanted. At about what\ntime did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday?\"\n\n\"An hour after sunset.\"\n\n\"If they go out to-day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor,\nthen, of seeing them in half an hour?\"\n\n\"In a quarter of an hour at most.\"\n\n\"Your arm is still strong enough, is it not, Porthos?\"\n\nPorthos unbuttoned his sleeve, raised his shirt and looked complacently\non his strong arm, as large as the leg of any ordinary man.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said he, \"I believe so.\"\n\n\"So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and\nyonder shovel into a corkscrew?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" And the giant took up these two articles, and without any\napparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his\ncompanion.\n\n\"There!\" he cried.\n\n\"Capital!\" exclaimed the Gascon. \"Really, Porthos, you are a gifted\nindividual!\"\n\n\"I have heard speak,\" said Porthos, \"of a certain Milo of Crotona, who\nperformed wonderful feats, such as binding his forehead with a cord and\nbursting it--of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it\nhome on his shoulders, et cetera. I used to learn all these feat by\nheart yonder, down at Pierrefonds, and I have done all that he did\nexcept breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples.\"\n\n\"Because your strength is not in your head, Porthos,\" said his friend.\n\n\"No; it is in my arms and shoulders,\" answered Porthos with gratified\nnaivete.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend, let us approach the window and there you can\nmatch your strength against that of an iron bar.\"\n\nPorthos went to the window, took a bar in his hands, clung to it and\nbent it like a bow; so that the two ends came out of the sockets of\nstone in which for thirty years they had been fixed.\n\n\"Well! friend, the cardinal, although such a genius, could never have\ndone that.\"\n\n\"Shall I take out any more of them?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"No; that is sufficient; a man can pass through that.\"\n\nPorthos tried, and passed the upper portion of his body through.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Now pass your arm through this opening.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You will know presently--pass it.\"\n\nPorthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the\nopening.\n\n\"Admirable!\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"The scheme goes forward, it seems.\"\n\n\"On wheels, dear friend.\"\n\n\"Good! What shall I do now?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"It is finished, then?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\n\"I should like to understand,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Listen, my dear friend; in two words you will know all. The door of the\nguardhouse opens, as you see.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see.\"\n\n\"They are about to send into our court, which Monsieur de Mazarin\ncrosses on his way to the orangery, the two guards who attend him.\"\n\n\"There they are, coming out.\"\n\n\"If only they close the guardhouse door! Good! They close it.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"Silence! They may hear us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand it at all.\"\n\n\"As you execute you will understand.\"\n\n\"And yet I should have preferred----\"\n\n\"You will have the pleasure of the surprise.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is true.\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nPorthos remained silent and motionless.\n\nIn fact, the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was,\nrubbing their hands, for it was cold, it being the month of February.\n\nAt this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the\nsoldiers was summoned away.\n\n\"Now,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I am going to call this soldier and talk\nto him. Don't lose a word of what I'm going to say to you, Porthos.\nEverything lies in the execution.\"\n\n\"Good, the execution of plots is my forte.\"\n\n\"I know it well. I depend on you. Look, I shall turn to the left, so\nthat the soldier will be at your right, as soon as he mounts on the\nbench to talk to us.\"\n\n\"But supposing he doesn't mount?\"\n\n\"He will; rely upon it. As soon as you see him get up, stretch out your\narm and seize him by the neck. Then, raising him up as Tobit raised\nthe fish by the gills, you must pull him into the room, taking care to\nsqueeze him so tight that he can't cry out.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Porthos. \"Suppose I happen to strangle him?\"\n\n\"To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world; but you\nwill not do so, I hope. Lay him down here; we'll gag him and tie him--no\nmatter where--somewhere. So we shall get from him one uniform and a\nsword.\"\n\n\"Marvelous!\" exclaimed Porthos, looking at the Gascon with the most\nprofound admiration.\n\n\"Pooh!\" replied D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos, recollecting himself, \"but one uniform and one\nsword will not suffice for two.\"\n\n\"Well; but there's his comrade.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Therefore, when I cough, stretch out your arm.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nThe two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed, Porthos being\ncompletely hidden in an angle of the window.\n\n\"Good-evening, comrade,\" said D'Artagnan in his most fascinating voice\nand manner.\n\n\"Good-evening, sir,\" answered the soldier, in a strong provincial\naccent.\n\n\"'Tis not too warm to walk,\" resumed D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?\"\n\n\"A glass of wine will be extremely welcome.\"\n\n\"The fish bites--the fish bites!\" whispered the Gascon to Porthos.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"A bottle, perhaps?\"\n\n\"A whole bottle? Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"A whole bottle, if you will drink my health.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered the soldier.\n\n\"Come, then, and take it, friend,\" said the Gascon.\n\n\"With all my heart. How convenient that there's a bench here. Egad! one\nwould think it had been placed here on purpose.\"\n\n\"Get on it; that's it, friend.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan coughed.\n\nThat instant the arm of Porthos fell. His hand of iron grasped, quick as\nlightning, firm as a pair of blacksmith's pincers, the soldier's throat.\nHe raised him, almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture,\nat the risk of flaying him in the passage. He then laid him down on the\nfloor, where D'Artagnan, after giving him just time enough to draw his\nbreath, gagged him with his long scarf; and the moment he had done so\nbegan to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had\nlearned his business on the field of battle. Then the soldier, gagged\nand bound, was placed upon the hearth, the fire of which had been\npreviously extinguished by the two friends.\n\n\"Here's a sword and a dress,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"I take them,\" said D'Artagnan, \"for myself. If you want another uniform\nand sword you must play the same trick over again. Stop! I see the other\nsoldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us.\"\n\n\"I think,\" replied Porthos, \"it would be imprudent to attempt the same\nmanoeuvre again; it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same\nway, and a failure would be ruinous. No; I will go down, seize the man\nunawares and bring him to you ready gagged.\"\n\n\"That is better,\" said the Gascon.\n\n\"Be ready,\" said Porthos, as he slipped through the opening.\n\nHe did as he said. Porthos seized his opportunity, caught the next\nsoldier by his neck, gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the\nbars into the room, and entered after him. Then they undressed him as\nthey had done the first, laid him on their bed and bound him with the\nstraps which composed the bed--the bedstead being of oak. This operation\nproved as great a success as the first.\n\n\"There,\" said D'Artagnan, \"this is capital! Now let me try on the dress\nof yonder chap. Porthos, I doubt if you can wear it; but should it be\ntoo tight, never mind, you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the\nred feathers.\"\n\nIt happened, however, that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic\nproportions, so, save that some few of the seams split, his uniform\nfitted Porthos perfectly.\n\nThey then dressed themselves.\n\n\"'Tis done!\" they both exclaimed at once. \"As to you, comrades,\" they\nsaid to the men, \"nothing will happen to you if you are discreet; but if\nyou stir you are dead men.\"\n\nThe soldiers were complaisant; they had found the grasp of Porthos\npretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it.\n\n\"Now,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you wouldn't be sorry to understand the plot,\nwould you, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Well, no, not very.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we shall go down into the court.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We shall take the place of those two fellows.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"We will walk back and forth.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea, for it isn't warm.\"\n\n\"In a moment the valet-de-chambre will call the guard, as he did\nyesterday and the day before.\"\n\n\"And we shall answer?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary, we shall not answer.\"\n\n\"As you please; I don't insist on answering.\"\n\n\"We will not answer, then; we will simply settle our hats on our heads\nand we will escort his eminence.\"\n\n\"Where shall we escort him?\"\n\n\"Where he is going--to visit Athos. Do you think Athos will be sorry to\nsee us?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Porthos, \"oh! I understand.\"\n\n\"Wait a little, Porthos, before crying out; for, on my word, you haven't\nreached the end,\" said the Gascon, in a jesting tone.\n\n\"What is to happen?\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Follow me,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"The man who lives to see shall see.\"\n\nAnd slipping through the aperture, he alighted in the court. Porthos\nfollowed him by the same road, but with more difficulty and less\ndiligence. They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear, as they\nlay bound in the chamber.\n\nScarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and\nthe voice of the valet-de-chambre called out:\n\n\"Make ready!\"\n\nAt the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out:\n\n\"La Bruyere and Du Barthois! March!\"\n\n\"It seems that I am named La Bruyere,\" remarked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"And I, Du Barthois,\" added Porthos.\n\n\"Where are you?\" asked the valet-de-chambre, whose eyes, dazzled by the\nlight, could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom.\n\n\"Here we are,\" said the Gascon.\n\n\"What say you to that, Monsieur du Vallon?\" he added in a low tone to\nPorthos.\n\n\"If it but lasts, most capital,\" responded Porthos.\n\nThese two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the\nvalet-de-chambre, who opened the door of the vestibule, then another\nwhich seemed to be that of a waiting-room, and showing them two stools:\n\n\"Your orders are very simple,\" he said; \"don't allow anybody, except\none person, to enter here. Do you hear--not a single creature! Obey that\nperson implicitly. On your return you cannot make a mistake. You have\nonly to wait here till I release you.\"\n\nD'Artagnan was known to this valet-de-chambre, who was no other than\nBernouin, and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the\nGascon a dozen times to the cardinal. The Gascon, therefore, instead of\nanswering, growled out \"Ja! Ja!\" in the most German and the least Gascon\naccent possible.\n\nAs for Porthos, on whom D'Artagnan had impressed the necessity of\nabsolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme\nof his friend, which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos, he was\nsimply mute. All that he was allowed to say, in case of emergencies, was\nthe proverbial Der Teufel!\n\nBernouin shut the door and went away. When Porthos heard the key turn\nin the lock he began to be alarmed, lest they should only have exchanged\none prison for another.\n\n\"Porthos, my friend,\" said D'Artagnan, \"don't distrust Providence! Let\nme meditate and consider.\"\n\n\"Meditate and consider as much as you like,\" replied Porthos, who was\nnow quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn.\n\n\"We have walked eight paces,\" whispered D'Artagnan, \"and gone up\nsix steps, so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the\norangery. The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off, only the doors are\nlocked.\"\n\n\"That is a slight difficulty,\" said Porthos, \"and a good push with the\nshoulders----\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Porthos my friend, reserve your feats of strength, or\nthey will not have, when needed, the honor they deserve. Have you not\nheard that some one is coming here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that some one will open the doors.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, if that some one recognizes us, if that some one\ncries out, we are lost; for you don't propose, I imagine, that I shall\nkill that man of the church. That might do if we were dealing with\nEnglishmen or Germans.\"\n\n\"Oh, may God keep me from it, and you, too!\" said D'Artagnan. \"The young\nking would, perhaps, show us some gratitude; but the queen would never\nforgive us, and it is she whom we have to consider. And then, besides,\nthe useless blood! never! no, never! I have my plan; let me carry it out\nand we shall laugh.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Porthos; \"I feel some need of it.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said D'Artagnan; \"the some one is coming.\"\n\nThe sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule. The hinges of the\ndoor creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier, wrapped in\na brown cloak, with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled\ndown over his eyes.\n\nPorthos effaced himself against the wall, but he could not render\nhimself invisible; and the man in the cloak said to him, giving him his\nlantern:\n\n\"Light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling.\"\n\nThen addressing D'Artagnan:\n\n\"You know the watchword?\" he said.\n\n\"Ja!\" replied the Gascon, determined to confine himself to this specimen\nof the German tongue.\n\n\"Tedesco!\" answered the cavalier; \"va bene.\"\n\nAnd advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in, he\nopened it and disappeared behind it, shutting it as he went.\n\n\"Now,\" asked Porthos, \"what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Now we shall make use of your shoulder, friend Porthos, if this door\nproves to be locked. Everything in its proper time, and all comes right\nto those who know how to wait patiently. But first barricade the first\ndoor well; then we will follow yonder cavalier.\"\n\nThe two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door\nwith all the furniture in the room, as not only to make the passage\nimpassable, but so to block the door that by no means could it open\ninward.\n\n\"There!\" said D'Artagnan, \"we can't be overtaken. Come! forward!\"\n\n\n\n\n85. The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin.\n\n\n\nAt first, on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed,\nD'Artagnan tried in vain to open it, but on the powerful shoulder of\nPorthos being applied to one of the panels, which gave way, D'Artagnan\nintroduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the\nlock. The bolt gave way and the door opened.\n\n\"As I told you, everything can be attained, Porthos, women and doors, by\nproceeding with gentleness.\"\n\n\"You're a great moralist, and that's the fact,\" said Porthos.\n\nThey entered; behind a glass window, by the light of the cardinal's\nlantern, which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery,\nthey saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil, in\nlong lines, forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys.\n\n\"No cardinal!\" said D'Artagnan, \"but only his lantern; where the devil,\nthen, is he?\"\n\nExploring, however, one of the side wings of the gallery, after making a\nsign to Porthos to explore the other, he saw, all at once, at his left,\na tub containing an orange tree, which had been pushed out of its place\nand in its place an open aperture.\n\nTen men would have found difficulty in moving that tub, but by some\nmechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it\nrested.\n\nD'Artagnan, as we have said, perceived a hole in that place and in this\nhole the steps of a winding staircase.\n\nHe called Porthos to look at it.\n\n\"Were our object money only,\" he said, \"we should be rich directly.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Don't you understand, Porthos? At the bottom of that staircase lies,\nprobably, the cardinal's treasury of which folk tell such wonders, and\nwe should only have to descend, empty a chest, shut the cardinal up in\nit, double lock it, go away, carrying off as much gold as we could, put\nback this orange-tree over the place, and no one in the world would ever\nask us where our fortune came from--not even the cardinal.\"\n\n\"It would be a happy hit for clowns to make, but as it seems to be\nunworthy of two gentlemen----\" said Porthos.\n\n\"So I think; and therefore I said, 'Were our object money only;' but we\nwant something else,\" replied the Gascon.\n\nAt the same moment, whilst D'Artagnan was leaning over the aperture\nto listen, a metallic sound, as if some one was moving a bag of gold,\nstruck on his ear; he started; instantly afterward a door opened and a\nlight played upon the staircase.\n\nMazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that\nhe was walking about, but he had with him a waxlight, to help him to\nexplore his mysterious strong box.\n\n\"Faith,\" he said, in Italian, as he was reascending the steps\nand looking at a bag of reals, \"faith, there's enough to pay five\ncouncillors of parliament, and two generals in Paris. I am a great\ncaptain--that I am! but I make war in my own way.\"\n\nThe two friends were crouching down, meantime, behind a tub in the side\nalley.\n\nMazarin came within three steps of D'Artagnan and pushed a spring in the\nwall; the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place.\n\nThen the cardinal put out the waxlight, slipped it into his pocket, and\ntaking up the lantern: \"Now,\" he said, \"for Monsieur de la Fere.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"'tis our road likewise; we will go\ntogether.\"\n\nAll three set off on their walk, Mazarin taking the middle alley and the\nfriends the side ones.\n\nThe cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being\nfollowed; the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound\nof footsteps.\n\nHe then turned to the left, down a corridor which had escaped the\nattention of the two friends, but as he opened the door he paused, as if\nin thought.\n\n\"Ah! Diavolo!\" he exclaimed, \"I forgot the recommendation of De\nComminges, who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door, in\norder not to put myself at the mercy of that four-headed combination\nof devils.\" And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his\nsteps.\n\n\"Do not give yourself the trouble, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, with his\nright foot forward, his beaver in his hand, a smile on his face, \"we\nhave followed your eminence step by step and here we are.\"\n\n\"Yes--here we are,\" said Porthos.\n\nAnd he made the same friendly salute as D'Artagnan.\n\nMazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare, recognized them,\nand let drop his lantern, uttering a cry of terror.\n\nD'Artagnan picked it up; by good luck it had not been extinguished.\n\n\"Oh, what imprudence, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan; \"'tis not good to\nbe about just here without a light. Your eminence might knock against\nsomething, or fall into a hole.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" muttered Mazarin, unable to recover from his\nastonishment.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is I. I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du\nVallon, that excellent friend of mine, in whom your eminence had the\nkindness to interest yourself formerly.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos, who\nnow began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole\nundertaking.\n\n\"You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere?\" said D'Artagnan. \"Don't\nlet us disarrange your eminence. Be so good as to show us the way and we\nwill follow you.\"\n\nMazarin was by degrees recovering his senses.\n\n\"Have you been long in the orangery?\" he asked in a trembling voice,\nremembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury.\n\nPorthos opened his mouth to reply; D'Artagnan made him a sign, and his\nmouth, remaining silent, gradually closed.\n\n\"This moment come, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nMazarin breathed again. His fears were now no longer for his hoard, but\nfor himself. A sort of smile played on his lips.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"you have me in a snare, gentlemen. I confess myself\nconquered. You wish to ask for liberty, and--I give it you.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord!\" answered D'Artagnan, \"you are too good; as to our\nliberty, we have that; we want to ask something else of you.\"\n\n\"You have your liberty?\" repeated Mazarin, in terror.\n\n\"Certainly; and on the other hand, my lord, you have lost it, and now,\nin accordance with the law of war, sir, you must buy it back again.\"\n\nMazarin felt a shiver run through him--a chill even to his heart's core.\nHis piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon\nand the unchanging countenance of Porthos. Both were in shadow and the\nSybil of Cuma herself could not have read them.\n\n\"To purchase back my liberty?\" said the cardinal.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"And how much will that cost me, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Zounds, my lord, I don't know yet. We must ask the Comte de la Fere the\nquestion. Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the\ncount's room, and in ten minutes all will be settled.\"\n\nMazarin started.\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"your eminence sees that we wish to act with\nall formality and due respect; but I must warn you that we have no time\nto lose; open the door then, my lord, and be so good as to remember,\nonce for all, that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest\ncry for help, our position being very critical indeed, you must not be\nangry with us if we go to extremities.\"\n\n\"Be assured,\" answered Mazarin, \"that I shall attempt nothing; I give\nyou my word of honor.\"\n\nD'Artagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness; then\nturning to Mazarin:\n\n\"Now, my lord, let us enter, if you please.\"\n\n\n\n\n86. Conferences.\n\n\n\nMazarin turned the lock of a double door, on the threshold of which they\nfound Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the\nnotice Comminges had given him.\n\nOn perceiving Mazarin he bowed.\n\n\"Your eminence,\" he said, \"might have dispensed with your attendants;\nthe honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it.\"\n\n\"And so, my dear count,\" said D'Artagnan, \"his eminence didn't actually\ninsist on our attending him; it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted,\nand even in a manner somewhat impolite, perhaps, so great was our\nlonging to see you.\"\n\nAt that voice, that mocking tone, and that familiar gesture, accenting\nvoice and tone, Athos made a bound of surprise.\n\n\"D'Artagnan! Porthos!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"My very self, dear friend.\"\n\n\"Me, also!\" repeated Porthos.\n\n\"What means this?\" asked the count.\n\n\"It means,\" replied Mazarin, trying to smile and biting his lips in\nthe attempt, \"that our parts are changed, and that instead of these\ngentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs; but, gentlemen, I warn you,\nunless you kill me, your victory will be of very short duration; people\nwill come to the rescue.\"\n\n\"Ah! my lord!\" cried the Gascon, \"don't threaten! 'tis a bad example.\nWe are so good and gentle to your eminence. Come, let us put aside all\nrancor and talk pleasantly.\"\n\n\"There's nothing I wish more,\" replied Mazarin. \"But don't think\nyourselves in a better position than you are. In ensnaring me you have\nfallen into the trap yourselves. How are you to get away from here?\nremember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors. Now, I am\ngoing to show you how sincere I am.\"\n\n\"Good,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"we must look about us; he's going to play\nus a trick.\"\n\n\"I offered you your liberty,\" continued the minister; \"will you take it?\nBefore an hour has passed you will be discovered, arrested, obliged to\nkill me, which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you.\"\n\n\"He is right,\" thought Athos.\n\nAnd, like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none\nbut noble thoughts, this feeling was expressed in his eyes.\n\n\"And therefore,\" said D'Artagnan, to clip the hope which Athos's tacit\nadhesion had imparted to Mazarin, \"we shall not proceed to that violence\nsave in the last extremity.\"\n\n\"If on the contrary,\" resumed Mazarin, \"you accept your liberty----\"\n\n\"Why you, my lord, might take it away from us in less than five minutes\nafterward; and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it\naway from us.\"\n\n\"No--on the faith of a cardinal. You do not believe me?\"\n\n\"My lord, I never believe cardinals who are not priests.\"\n\n\"Well, on the faith of a minister.\"\n\n\"You are no longer a minister, my lord; you are a prisoner.\"\n\n\"Then, on the honor of a Mazarin, as I am and ever shall be, I hope,\"\nsaid the cardinal.\n\n\"Hem,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not\nmuch religion when his oaths were in question. I fear he may have been\nan ancestor of your eminence.\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan, you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on\nbad terms with you.\"\n\n\"My lord, let us come to terms; I ask nothing better.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mazarin, \"if I place you in security, in a manner\nevident, palpable----\"\n\n\"Ah! that is another thing,\" said Porthos.\n\n\"Let us see,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Let us see,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"In the first place, do you accept?\" asked the cardinal.\n\n\"Unfold your plan, my lord, and we will see.\"\n\n\"Take notice that you are shut up--captured.\"\n\n\"You well know, my lord, that there always remains to us a last\nresource.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That of dying together.\"\n\nMazarin shuddered.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said; \"at the end of yonder corridor is a door, of which\nI have the key, it leads into the park. Go, and take this key with you;\nyou are active, vigorous, and you have arms. At a hundred steps, on\nturning to the left, you will find the wall of the park; get over it,\nand in three leaps you will be on the road and free.\"\n\n\"Ah! by Jove, my lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you have well said, but these\nare only words. Where is the key you speak of?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord! You will conduct us yourself, then, to that door?\"\n\n\"Very willingly, if it be necessary to reassure you,\" answered the\nminister, and Mazarin, who was delighted to get off so cheaply, led the\nway, in high spirits, to the corridor and opened the door.\n\nIt led into the park, as the three fugitives perceived by the night\nbreeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their\nfaces.\n\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed the Gascon, \"'tis a dreadful night, my lord.\nWe don't know the locality, and shall never find the wall. Since your\neminence has come so far, come a few steps further; conduct us, my lord,\nto the wall.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" replied the cardinal; and walking in a straight line he\nwent to the wall, at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same\ninstant.\n\n\"Are you satisfied, gentlemen?\" asked Mazarin.\n\n\"I think so, indeed; we should be hard to please if we were not. Deuce\ntake it! three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church! Ah!\napropos, my lord! you remarked that we were all active, vigorous and\narmed.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are\narmed. The count is not; and should we meet with one of your patrol we\nmust defend ourselves.\"\n\n\"'Tis true.\"\n\n\"Where can we find another sword?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, \"will lend his, which is of no use to him,\nto the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said the cardinal; \"I will even ask the count to keep it\nfor my sake.\"\n\n\"I promise you, my lord, never to part with it,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"Well, well,\" cried D'Artagnan, \"this reconciliation is truly touching;\nhave you not tears in your eyes, Porthos?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Porthos; \"but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind\nthat makes me weep; I think it is the wind.\"\n\n\"Now climb up, Athos, quickly,\" said D'Artagnan. Athos, assisted by\nPorthos, who lifted him up like a feather, arrived at the top.\n\n\"Now, jump down, Athos.\"\n\nAthos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall.\n\n\"Are you on the ground?\" asked D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Without accident?\"\n\n\"Perfectly safe and sound.\"\n\n\"Porthos, whilst I get up, watch the cardinal. No, I don't want your\nhelp, watch the cardinal.\"\n\n\"I am watching,\" said Porthos. \"Well?\"\n\n\"You are right; it is more difficult than I thought. Lend me your\nback--but don't let the cardinal go.\"\n\nPorthos lent him his back and D'Artagnan was soon on the summit of the\nwall, where he seated himself.\n\nMazarin pretended to laugh.\n\n\"Are you there?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Yes, my friend; and now----\"\n\n\"Now, what?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"Now give me the cardinal up here; if he makes any noise stifle him.\"\n\nMazarin wished to call out, but Porthos held him tight and passed him\nto D'Artagnan, who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him;\nthen in a menacing tone, he said:\n\n\"Sir! jump directly down, close to Monsieur de la Fere, or, on the honor\nof a gentleman, I'll kill you!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, monsieur,\" cried Mazarin, \"you are breaking your word to me!\"\n\n\"I--did I promise you anything, my lord?\"\n\nMazarin groaned.\n\n\"You are free,\" he said, \"through me; your liberty was my ransom.\"\n\n\"Agreed; but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the\ngallery, to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall,\nwhich causes a tub to turn, revealing a staircase--must not one speak of\nthat a little, my lord?\"\n\n\"Diavolo!\" cried Mazarin, almost choked, and clasping his hands; \"I am a\nlost and ruined man!\"\n\nBut without listening to his protestations of alarm, D'Artagnan slipped\nhim gently down into the arms of Athos, who stood immovable at the\nbottom of the wall.\n\nPorthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall, and by the aid\nof his friend's hand gained the summit.\n\n\"I didn't understand it all,\" he said, \"but I understand now; how droll\nit is!\"\n\n\"You think so? so much the better; but that it may prove laughter-worthy\neven to the end, let us not lose time.\" And he jumped off the wall.\n\nPorthos did the same.\n\n\"Attend to monsieur le cardinal, gentlemen,\" said D'Artagnan; \"for\nmyself, I will reconnoitre.\"\n\nThe Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"which way do we go? Think well of your reply, for\nshould your eminence be mistaken, there might ensue most grave results\nfor all of us.\"\n\n\"Along the wall, sir,\" said Mazarin, \"there will be no danger of losing\nyourselves.\"\n\nThe three friends hastened on, but in a short time were obliged to\nslacken the pace. The cardinal could not keep up with them, though with\nevery wish to do so.\n\nSuddenly D'Artagnan touched something warm, which moved.\n\n\"Stop! a horse!\" he cried; \"I have found a horse!\"\n\n\"And I, likewise,\" said Athos.\n\n\"I, too,\" said Porthos, who, faithful to the instructions, still held\nthe cardinal's arm.\n\n\"There's luck, my lord! just as you were complaining of being tired and\nobliged to walk.\"\n\nBut as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and\nthese words were pronounced:\n\n\"Touch it not!\"\n\n\"Grimaud!\" he cried; \"Grimaud! what art thou about? Why, thou art posted\nhere by Heaven!\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the honest servant, \"it was Monsieur Aramis who posted\nme here to take care of the horses.\"\n\n\"Is Aramis here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he has been here since yesterday.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"On the watch----\"\n\n\"What! Aramis here?\" cried Athos.\n\n\"At the lesser gate of the castle; he's posted there.\"\n\n\"Are you a large party?\"\n\n\"Sixty.\"\n\n\"Let him know.\"\n\n\"This moment, sir.\"\n\nAnd believing that no one could execute the commission better than\nhimself, Grimaud set off at full speed; whilst, enchanted at being all\ntogether again, the friends awaited his return.\n\nThere was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal\nMazarin.\n\n\n\n\n87. In which we begin to think that Porthos will be at last a Baron, and\nD'Artagnan a Captain.\n\n\n\nAt the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived, accompanied by Grimaud\nand eight or ten followers. He was excessively delighted and threw\nhimself into his friends' arms.\n\n\"You are free, my brothers! free without my aid! and I shall have\nsucceeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts.\"\n\n\"Do not be unhappy, dear friend, on that account; if you have done\nnothing as yet, you will do something soon,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"I had well concerted my plans,\" pursued Aramis; \"the coadjutor gave\nme sixty men; twenty guard the walls of the park, twenty the road from\nRueil to Saint Germain, twenty are dispersed in the woods. Thus I was\nable, thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces, to intercept two\ncouriers from Mazarin to the queen.\"\n\nMazarin listened intently.\n\n\"But,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I trust that you honorably sent them back to\nmonsieur le cardinal!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Aramis, \"toward him I should be very likely to practice\nsuch delicacy of sentiment! In one of the despatches the cardinal\ndeclares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty\nhas no more money. In the other he announces that he is about to\ntransport his prisoners to Melun, since Rueil seemed to him not\nsufficiently secure. You can understand, dear friend, with what hope I\nwas inspired by that last letter. I placed myself in ambuscade with\nmy sixty men; I encircled the castle; the riding horses I entrusted\nto Grimaud and I awaited your coming out, which I did not expect till\nto-morrow, and I didn't hope to free you without a skirmish. You are\nfree to-night, without fighting; so much the better! How did you manage\nto escape that scoundrel Mazarin? You must have much reason to complain\nof him.\"\n\n\"Not very much,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Really!\"\n\n\"I might even say that we have some reason to praise him.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Yes, really; it is owing to him that we are free.\"\n\n\"Owing to him?\"\n\n\"Yes, he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin, his\nvalet-de-chambre, and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de\nla Fere. Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it. He even went\nso far as to show us the way out; he led us to the park wall, which we\nclimbed over without accident, and then we fell in with Grimaud.\"\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Aramis, \"this will reconcile me to him; but I wish he\nwere here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so\nnoble an act.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said D'Artagnan, no longer able to contain himself, \"allow me\nto introduce to you the Chevalier d'Herblay, who wishes--as you may have\nheard--to offer his congratulations to your eminence.\"\n\nAnd he retired, discovering Mazarin, who was in great confusion, to the\nastonished gaze of Aramis.\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" exclaimed the latter, \"the cardinal! a glorious prize! Halloo!\nhalloo! friends! to horse! to horse!\"\n\nSeveral horsemen ran quickly to him.\n\n\"Zounds!\" cried Aramis, \"I may have done some good; so, my lord, deign\nto receive my most respectful homage! I will lay a wager that 'twas\nthat Saint Christopher, Porthos, who performed this feat! Apropos!\nI forgot----\" and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the\nhorsemen.\n\n\"I think it will be wise to set off,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes; but I am expecting some one, a friend of Athos.\"\n\n\"A friend!\" exclaimed the count.\n\n\"And here he comes, by Jupiter! galloping through the bushes.\"\n\n\"The count! the count!\" cried a young voice that made Athos start.\n\n\"Raoul! Raoul!\" he ejaculated.\n\nFor one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect--he threw\nhimself on his father's neck.\n\n\"Look, my lord cardinal,\" said Aramis, \"would it not have been a pity\nto have separated men who love each other as we love? Gentlemen,\" he\ncontinued, addressing the cavaliers, who became more and more numerous\nevery instant; \"gentlemen, encircle his eminence, that you may show him\nthe greater honor. He will, indeed give us the favor of his company;\nyou will, I hope, be grateful for it; Porthos, do not lose sight of his\neminence.\"\n\nAramis then joined Athos and D'Artagnan, who were consulting together.\n\n\"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, after a conference of five minutes' duration,\n\"let us begin our journey.\"\n\n\"Where are we to go?\" asked Porthos.\n\n\"To your house, dear Porthos, at Pierrefonds; your fine chateau is\nworthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence; it is,\nlikewise, well situated--neither too near Paris, nor too far from it;\nwe can establish a communication between it and the capital with great\nfacility. Come, my lord, you shall be treated like a prince, as you\nare.\"\n\n\"A fallen prince!\" exclaimed Mazarin, piteously.\n\n\"The chances of war,\" said Athos, \"are many, but be assured we shall\ntake no improper advantage of them.\"\n\n\"No, but we shall make use of them,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nThe rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling\nwith the wonderful rapidity of former days. Mazarin, still sombre and\npensive, permitted himself to be dragged along in this way; it looked a\nrace of phantoms. At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing\nrein; half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down.\n\n\"Horses, nowadays, are not what they were formerly,\" observed Porthos;\n\"everything degenerates.\"\n\n\"I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin,\" said Aramis. \"He is to bring us five\nfresh horses--one for his eminence, four for us. We, at least, must keep\nclose to monseigneur; the rest of the start will rejoin us later. Once\nbeyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to fear.\"\n\nGrimaud, in fact, brought back five horses. The nobleman to whom he\napplied, being a friend of Porthos, was very ready, not to sell them, as\nwas proposed, but to lend them. Ten minutes later the escort stopped at\nErmenonville, but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor,\nguarding Mazarin carefully. At noon they rode into the avenue of\nPierrefonds.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mousqueton, who had ridden by the side of D'Artagnan without\nspeaking a word on the journey, \"you may think what you will, sir, but I\ncan breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds;\"\nand he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the\narrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends.\n\n\"We are four of us,\" said D'Artagnan; \"we must relieve each other in\nmounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a\ntime. Athos is going to examine the castle, which it will be necessary\nto render impregnable in case of siege; Porthos will see to the\nprovisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison. That is to say,\nAthos will be chief engineer, Porthos purveyor-in-general, and Aramis\ngovernor of the fortress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, when he was in his room, \"you do not expect, I\npresume, to keep me here a long time incognito?\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the Gascon; \"on the contrary, we think of\nannouncing very soon that we have you here.\"\n\n\"Then you will be besieged.\"\n\n\"We expect it.\"\n\n\"And what shall you do?\"\n\n\"Defend ourselves. Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell\nyou a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais, which we four, with\nour four lackeys and twelve dead men, held out against a whole army.\"\n\n\"Such feats, sir, are done once--and never repeated.\"\n\n\"However, nowadays there's no need of so much heroism. To-morrow the\narmy of Paris will be summoned, the day after it will be here! The field\nof battle, instead, therefore, of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton,\nwill be near Compiegne or Villars-Cotterets.\"\n\n\"The prince will vanquish you, as he has always done.\"\n\n\"'Tis possible; my lord; but before an engagement ensues we shall move\nyour eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon, who\nhas three. We will not expose your eminence to the chances of war.\"\n\n\"Come,\" answered Mazarin, \"I see it will be necessary for me to\ncapitulate.\"\n\n\"Before a siege?\"\n\n\"Yes; the conditions will be better than afterward.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord! as to conditions, you would soon see how moderate and\nreasonable we are!\"\n\n\"Come, now, what are your conditions?\"\n\n\"Rest yourself first, my lord, and we--we will reflect.\"\n\n\"I do not need rest, gentlemen; I need to know whether I am among\nenemies or friends.\"\n\n\"Friends, my lord! friends!\"\n\n\"Well, then, tell me at once what you want, that I may see if any\narrangement be possible. Speak, Comte de la Fere!\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Athos, \"for myself I have nothing to demand. For\nFrance, were I to specify my wishes, I should have too much. I beg you\nto excuse me and propose to the chevalier.\"\n\nAnd Athos, bowing, retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece,\na spectator of the scene.\n\n\"Speak, then, chevalier!\" said the cardinal. \"What do you want? Nothing\nambiguous, if you please. Be clear, short and precise.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" replied Aramis, \"I have in my pocket the very programme\nof the conditions which the deputation--of which I formed one--went\nyesterday to Saint Germain to impose on you. Let us consider first the\nancient rights. The demands in that programme must be granted.\"\n\n\"We were almost agreed on those,\" replied Mazarin; \"let us pass on to\nprivate and personal stipulations.\"\n\n\"You suppose, then, that there are some?\" said Aramis, smiling.\n\n\"I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as\nMonsieur de la Fere,\" replied the cardinal, bowing to Athos.\n\n\"My lord, you are right, and I am glad to see that you do justice to\nthe count at last. The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly\npassions. He is a proud soul--he is a man by himself! You are right--he\nis worth us all, and we avow it to you!\"\n\n\"Aramis,\" said Athos, \"are you jesting?\"\n\n\"No, no, dear friend; I state only what we all know. You are right;\nit is not you alone this matter concerns, but my lord and his unworthy\nservant, myself.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what do you require besides the general conditions before\nrecited?\"\n\n\"I require, my lord, that Normandy should be given to Madame de\nLongueville, with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution. I\nrequire that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child\nshe has just borne; and that my lord, after having been present at the\nchristening, should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the\nPope.\"\n\n\"That is, you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions, to quit\nFrance and be an exile.\"\n\n\"I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity, allowing\nme then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my\nfriends.\"\n\nMazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable, and then turned to\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"And you, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"I, my lord,\" answered the Gascon, \"I differ from Monsieur d'Herblay\nentirely as to the last point, though I agree with him on the first.\nFar from wishing my lord to quit Paris, I hope he will stay there and\ncontinue to be prime minister, as he is a great statesman. I shall\ntry also to help him to down the Fronde, but on one condition--that he\nsometimes remembers the king's faithful servants and gives the first\nvacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name. And you,\nMonsieur du Vallon----\"\n\n\"Yes, you, sir! Speak, if you please,\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"As for me,\" answered Porthos, \"I wish my lord cardinal, in order to do\nhonor to my house, which gives him an asylum, would in remembrance of\nthis adventure erect my estate into a barony, with a promise to confer\nthat order on one of my particular friends, whenever his majesty next\ncreates peers.\"\n\n\"You know, sir, that before receiving the order one must submit proofs.\"\n\n\"My friends will submit them. Besides, should it be necessary,\nmonseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided.\"\n\nMazarin bit his lips; the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly:\n\n\"All this appears to me to be ill conceived, disjointed, gentlemen; for\nif I satisfy some I shall displease others. If I stay in Paris I cannot\ngo to Rome; if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister;\nand it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur\nd'Artagnan a captain and Monsieur du Vallon a baron.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Aramis, \"so, as I am in a minority, I withdraw\nmy proposition, so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and\nmonseigneur's resignation.\"\n\n\"I am to remain minister, then?\" said Mazarin.\n\n\"You remain minister; that is understood,\" said D'Artagnan; \"France\nneeds you.\"\n\n\"And I desist from my pretensions,\" said Aramis. \"His eminence will\ncontinue to be prime minister and her majesty's favorite, if he will\ngrant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for ourselves.\"\n\n\"Occupy yourselves with your own affairs, gentlemen, and let France\nsettle matters as she will with me,\" resumed Mazarin.\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" replied Aramis. \"The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your\neminence must sign it before us, promising at the same time to obtain\nthe queen's consent to it.\"\n\n\"I can answer only for myself,\" said Mazarin. \"I cannot answer for the\nqueen. Suppose her majesty refuses?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, \"monseigneur knows very well that her majesty\nrefuses him nothing.\"\n\n\"Here, monseigneur,\" said Aramis, \"is the treaty proposed by the\ndeputation of Frondeurs. Will your eminence please read and examine?\"\n\n\"I am acquainted with it.\"\n\n\"Sign it, then.\"\n\n\"Reflect, gentlemen, that a signature given under circumstances like the\npresent might be regarded as extorted by violence.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given.\"\n\n\"Suppose I refuse?\"\n\n\"Then,\" said D'Artagnan, \"your eminence must expect the consequences of\na refusal.\"\n\n\"Would you dare to touch a cardinal?\"\n\n\"You have dared, my lord, to imprison her majesty's musketeers.\"\n\n\"The queen will revenge me, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I do not think so, although inclination might lead her to do so, but we\nshall take your eminence to Paris, and the Parisians will defend us.\"\n\n\"How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain,\"\nsaid Aramis. \"How they must be asking, 'Where is the cardinal?' 'What\nhas become of the minister?' 'Where has the favorite gone?' How they\nmust be looking for monseigneur in all corners! What comments must be\nmade; and if the Fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared, how the\nFronde must triumph!\"\n\n\"It is frightful,\" murmured Mazarin.\n\n\"Sign the treaty, then, monseigneur,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it?\"\n\n\"Ah! nonsense!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"I can manage so that her majesty will\nreceive me well; I know an excellent method.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the\nfinances are exhausted.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Mazarin, turning pale.\n\n\"When I see her majesty embarrassed, I shall conduct her to Rueil, make\nher enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box.\"\n\n\"Enough, sir,\" muttered the cardinal, \"you have said enough; where is\nthe treaty?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" replied Aramis. \"Sign, my lord,\" and he gave him a pen.\n\nMazarin arose, walked some moments, thoughtful, but not dejected.\n\n\"And when I have signed,\" he said, \"what is to be my guarantee?\"\n\n\"My word of honor, sir,\" said Athos.\n\nMazarin started, turned toward the Comte de la Fere, and looking for an\ninstant at that grand and honest countenance, took the pen.\n\n\"It is sufficient, count,\" he said, and signed the treaty.\n\n\"And now, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" he said, \"prepare to set off for Saint\nGermain and take a letter from me to the queen.\"\n\n\n\n\n88. Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword.\n\n\n\nD'Artagnan knew his part well; he was aware that opportunity has a\nforelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go\nby him without seizing it. He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner\nof traveling, by sending relays of horses to Chantilly, so that he might\nbe in Paris in five or six hours. But before setting out he reflected\nthat for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular\npredicament, since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving\ncertainty behind him.\n\n\"In fact,\" he said, as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous\nmission, \"Athos, for generosity, is a hero of romance; Porthos has\nan excellent disposition, but is easily influenced; Aramis has a\nhieroglyphic countenance, always illegible. What will come out of\nthose three elements when I am no longer present to combine them?\nThe deliverance of the cardinal, perhaps. Now, the deliverance of the\ncardinal would be the ruin of our hopes; and our hopes are thus far the\nonly recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of\nHercules were pygmean.\"\n\nHe went to find Aramis.\n\n\"You, my dear Chevalier d'Herblay,\" he said, \"are the Fronde incarnate.\nMistrust Athos, therefore, who will not prosecute the affairs of any\none, even his own. Mistrust Porthos, especially, who, to please the\ncount whom he regards as God on earth, will assist him in contriving\nMazarin's escape, if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric.\"\n\nAramis smiled; his smile was at once cunning and resolute.\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" he said; \"I have my conditions to impose. My private\nambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side.\"\n\n\"Good!\" thought D'Artagnan: \"in this direction I am satisfied.\" He\npressed Aramis's hand and went in search of Porthos.\n\n\"Friend,\" he said, \"you have worked so hard with me toward building up\nour fortune, that, at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of\nour labours, it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow\nyourself to be controlled by Aramis, whose cunning you know--a cunning\nwhich, we may say between ourselves, is not always without egotism;\nor by Athos, a noble and disinterested man, but blase, who, desiring\nnothing further for himself, doesn't sympathize with the desires of\nothers. What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to\nyou to let Mazarin go?\"\n\n\"Why, I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him\noff so easily.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Porthos! and you would be right, my friend; for in losing him\nyou would lose your barony, which you have in your grasp, to say nothing\nof the fact that, were he once out of this, Mazarin would have you\nhanged.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Then I would kill him rather than let him go.\"\n\n\"And you would act rightly. There is no question, you understand,\nprovided we secure our own interests, of securing those of the\nFrondeurs; who, besides, don't understand political matters as we old\nsoldiers do.\"\n\n\"Never fear, dear friend,\" said Porthos. \"I shall see you through the\nwindow as you mount your horse; I shall follow you with my eyes as long\nas you are in sight; then I shall place myself at the cardinal's door--a\ndoor with glass windows. I shall see everything, and at the least\nsuspicious sign I shall begin to exterminate.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" thought D'Artagnan; \"on this side I think the cardinal will be\nwell guarded.\" He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went\nin search of Athos.\n\n\"My dear Athos,\" he said, \"I am going away. I have only one thing to\nsay to you. You know Anne of Austria; the captivity of Mazarin alone\nguarantees my life; if you let him go I am a dead man.\"\n\n\"I needed nothing less than that consideration, my dear D'Artagnan, to\npersuade myself to adopt the role of jailer. I give you my word that you\nwill find the cardinal where you leave him.\"\n\n\"This reassures me more than all the royal signatures,\" thought\nD'Artagnan. \"Now that I have the word of Athos I can set out.\"\n\nD'Artagnan started alone on his journey, without other escort than his\nsword, and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission\nto the queen's presence. Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at\nSaint Germain.\n\nThe disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known. Anne of\nAustria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one.\nIn the chamber of D'Artagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found\nbound and gagged. On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they\ncould, of course, tell nothing but what they knew--that they had been\nseized, stripped and bound. But as to what had been done by Porthos and\nD'Artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the\nchateau.\n\nBernouin alone knew a little more than the others. Bernouin, seeing that\nhis master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight, had\nmade an examination of the orangery. The first door, barricaded\nwith furniture, had aroused in him certain suspicions, but without\ncommunicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way\ninto the midst of all that confusion. Then he came to the corridor,\nall the doors of which he found open; so, too, was the door of Athos's\nchamber and that of the park. From the latter point it was easy to\nfollow tracks on the snow. He saw that these tracks tended toward the\nwall; on the other side he found similar tracks, then footprints of\nhorses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in\nthe direction of Enghien. He could no longer cherish any doubt that\nthe cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners, since the\nprisoners had disappeared at the same time; and he had hastened to Saint\nGermain to warn the queen of that disappearance.\n\nAnne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to\nno one except the Prince de Conde, who had sent five or six hundred\nhorsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any\nsuspicious person who was going away from Rueil, in whatsoever direction\nit might be.\n\nNow, since D'Artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen, since he\nwas alone, since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to\nSaint Germain, no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not\nobstructed in any way.\n\nOn entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen\nby our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person, who, standing on the\nthreshold, awaited news of his vanished master.\n\nAt the sight of D'Artagnan, who entered the courtyard on horseback,\nBernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken. But D'Artagnan\nmade a friendly sign to him with his head, dismounted, and throwing his\nbridle to a lackey who was passing, he approached the valet-de-chambre\nwith a smile on his lips.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried the latter, like a man who has the\nnightmare and talks in his sleep, \"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\"\n\n\"Himself, Monsieur Bernouin.\"\n\n\"And why have you come here?\"\n\n\"To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarin--the freshest news there is.\"\n\n\"What has become of him, then?\"\n\n\"He is as well as you and I.\"\n\n\"Nothing bad has happened to him, then?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing. He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de\nFrance, and begged us--the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallon--to\naccompany him. We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of\nthat sort. We set out last evening and here we are.\"\n\n\"Here you are.\"\n\n\"His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty, something\nsecret and private--a mission that could be confided only to a sure\nman--and so has sent me to Saint Germain. And therefore, my dear\nMonsieur Bernouin, if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your\nmaster, announce to her majesty that I have come, and tell her with what\npurpose.\"\n\nWhether he spoke seriously or in jest, since it was evident that under\nexisting circumstances D'Artagnan was the only man who could relieve the\nqueen's uneasiness, Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her\nthis strange embassy; and as he had foreseen, the queen gave orders to\nintroduce Monsieur d'Artagnan at once.\n\nD'Artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect,\nand having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal's letter\n\nIt was, however, merely a letter of introduction. The queen read it,\nrecognized the writing, and, since there were no details in it of what\nhad occurred, asked for particulars. D'Artagnan related everything with\nthat simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions.\nThe queen, as he went on, looked at him with increasing astonishment.\nShe could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and\nstill less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose\ninterest and almost duty it was to punish him.\n\n\"How, sir!\" she cried, as D'Artagnan finished, \"you dare to tell me the\ndetails of your crime--to give me an account of your treason!\"\n\n\"Pardon, madame, but I think that either I have expressed myself badly\nor your majesty has imperfectly understood me. There is here no question\nof crime or treason. Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison, Monsieur du\nVallon and myself, because we could not believe that he had sent us to\nEngland to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I.,\nbrother-in-law of the late king, your husband, the consort of Madame\nHenrietta, your sister and your guest, and because we did all that we\ncould do to save the life of the royal martyr. We were then convinced,\nmy friend and I, that there was some error of which we were the\nvictims, and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and\nourselves. Now, that an explanation may bear fruit, it is necessary that\nit should be quietly conducted, far from noise and interruption. We have\ntherefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend's chateau and\nthere we have come to an understanding. Well, madame, it proved to be\nas we had supposed; there was a mistake. Monsieur de Mazarin had thought\nthat we had rendered service to General Cromwell, instead of King\nCharles, which would have been a disgrace, rebounding from us to him,\nand from him to your majesty--a dishonor which would have tainted the\nroyalty of your illustrious son. We were able to prove the contrary, and\nthat proof we are ready to give to your majesty, calling in support of\nit the august widow weeping in the Louvre, where your royal munificence\nhas provided for her a home. That proof satisfied him so completely\nthat, as a sign of satisfaction, he has sent me, as your majesty may\nsee, to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen\nunjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted.\"\n\n\"I listen to you, and I wonder at you, sir,\" said the queen. \"In fact, I\nhave rarely seen such excess of impudence.\"\n\n\"Your majesty, on your side,\" said D'Artagnan, \"is as much mistaken as\nto our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always been.\"\n\n\"You are in error, sir,\" answered the queen. \"I am so little mistaken\nthat in ten minutes you shall be arrested, and in an hour I shall set\noff at the head of my army to release my minister.\"\n\n\"I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence,\nfirst, because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous\nresults. Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be\ndead; and indeed, so convinced is he of this, that he entreated me,\nshould I find your majesty disposed to act in this way, to do all I\ncould to induce you to change your resolution.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will content myself with arresting you!\"\n\n\"Madame, the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen, and should\nI not have returned by to-morrow, at a certain hour the next day the\ncardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the parliament.\"\n\n\"It is evident, sir, that your position has kept you out of relation\nto men and affairs; otherwise you would know that since we left Paris\nmonsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times; that he has\nthere met De Beaufort, De Bouillon, the coadjutor and D'Elbeuf and that\nnot one of them had any desire to arrest him.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, madame, I know all that. And therefore my friends will\nconduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort, nor to De Bouillon,\nnor to the coadjutor, nor to D'Elbeuf. These gentlemen wage war on\nprivate account, and in buying them up, by granting them what they\nwished, monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain. He will be\ndelivered to the parliament, members of which can, of course, be bought,\nbut even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body.\"\n\n\"I think,\" returned Anne of Austria, fixing upon him a glance, which in\nany woman's face would have expressed disdain, but in a queen's, spread\nterror to those she looked upon, \"nay, I perceive you dare to threaten\nthe mother of your sovereign.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I threaten simply and solely because I\nam obliged to do so. Believe me, madame, as true a thing as it is that a\nheart beats in this bosom--a heart devoted to you--believe that you\nhave been the idol of our lives; that we have, as you well know--good\nHeaven!--risked our lives twenty times for your majesty. Have you,\nthen, madame, no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have\nvegetated in obscurity, without betraying in a single sigh the solemn\nand sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you? Look at\nme, madame--at me, whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly.\nWhat am I? A poor officer, without fortune, without protection, without\na future, unless the eye of my queen, which I have sought so long, rests\non me for a moment. Look at the Comte de la Fere, a type of nobility,\na flower of chivalry. He has taken part against his queen, or rather,\nagainst her minister. He has not been unreasonably exacting, it seems to\nme. Look at Monsieur du Vallon, that faithful soul, that arm of steel,\nwho for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make\nhim in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage. Consider, in short,\nyour people who love you and who yet are famished, who have no other\nwish than to bless you, and who, nevertheless--no, I am wrong, your\nsubjects, madame, will never curse you; say one word to them and\nall will be ended--peace succeed war, joy tears, and happiness to\nmisfortune!\"\n\nAnne of Austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of\nD'Artagnan, which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling.\n\n\"Why did you not say all this before you took action, sir?\" she said.\n\n\"Because, madame, it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of\nwhich you doubted---that is, that we still possess amongst us some valor\nand are worthy of some consideration at your hands.\"\n\n\"And that valor would shrink from no undertaking, according to what I\nsee.\"\n\n\"It has hesitated at nothing in the past; why, then, should it be less\ndaring in the future?\"\n\n\"Then, in case of my refusal, this valor, should a struggle occur,\nwill even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court, to\ndeliver me into the hands of the Fronde, as you propose to deliver my\nminister?\"\n\n\"We have not thought about it yet, madame,\" answered D'Artagnan, with\nthat Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete; \"but\nif we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly.\"\n\n\"I ought,\" muttered Anne to herself, \"by this time to remember that\nthese men are giants.\"\n\n\"Alas, madame!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"this proves to me that not till\nto-day has your majesty had a just idea of us.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Anne; \"but that idea, if at last I have it----\"\n\n\"Your majesty will do us justice. In doing us justice you will no longer\ntreat us as men of vulgar stamp. You will see in me an ambassador worthy\nof the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign.\"\n\n\"Where is the treaty?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\nAnne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that D'Artagnan presented\nto her.\n\n\"I do not see here,\" she said, \"anything but general conditions; the\ninterests of the Prince de Conti or of the Ducs de Beaufort, de Bouillon\nand d'Elbeuf and of the coadjutor, are herein consulted; but with regard\nto yours?\"\n\n\"We do ourselves justice, madame, even in assuming the high position\nthat we have. We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great\nnames.\"\n\n\"But you, I presume, have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce?\"\n\n\"I believe you, madame, to be a great and powerful queen, and that it\nwill be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense\nthe arms which will bring back his eminence to Saint Germain.\"\n\n\"It is my intention so to do; come, let us hear you. Speak.\"\n\n\"He who has negotiated these matters (forgive me if I begin by speaking\nof myself, but I must claim that importance which has been given to me,\nnot assumed by me) he who has arranged matters for the return of the\ncardinal, ought, it appears to me, in order that his reward may not\nbe unworthy of your majesty, to be made commandant of the guards--an\nappointment something like that of captain of the musketeers.\"\n\n\"'Tis the appointment Monsieur de Treville held, you ask of me.\"\n\n\"The place, madame, is vacant, and although 'tis a year since Monsieur\nde Treville has left it, it has not been filled.\"\n\n\"But it is one of the principal military appointments in the king's\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Treville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family,\nlike me, madame; he occupied that post for twenty years.\"\n\n\"You have an answer ready for everything,\" replied the queen, and she\ntook from her bureau a document, which she filled up and signed.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, madame,\" said D'Artagnan, taking the document and bowing,\n\"this is a noble reward; but everything in the world is unstable, and\nthe man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose\nthis office to-morrow.\"\n\n\"What more do you want?\" asked the queen, coloring, as she found that\nshe had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own.\n\n\"A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers, to\nbe paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your\nmajesty.\"\n\nAnne hesitated.\n\n\"To think of the Parisians,\" soliloquized D'Artagnan, \"offering only the\nother day, by an edict of the parliament, six hundred thousand francs\nto any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them, dead or\nalive--if alive, in order to hang him; if dead, to deny him the rites of\nChristian burial!\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Anne, \"'tis reasonable, since you only ask from a queen the\nsixth of what the parliament has proposed;\" and she signed an order for\na hundred thousand francs.\n\n\"Now, then,\" she said, \"what next?\"\n\n\"Madame, my friend Du Vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in\nthe way of fortune to desire; but I think I remember that there was\na question between him and Monsieur Mazarin as to making his estate a\nbarony. Nay, it must have been a promise.\"\n\n\"A country clown,\" said Anne of Austria, \"people will laugh.\"\n\n\"Let them,\" answered D'Artagnan. \"But I am sure of one thing--that those\nwho laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time.\"\n\n\"Here goes the barony.\" said the queen; she signed a patent.\n\n\"Now there remains the chevalier, or the Abbe d'Herblay, as your majesty\npleases.\"\n\n\"Does he wish to be a bishop?\"\n\n\"No, madame, something easier to grant.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of\nMadame de Longueville.\"\n\nThe queen smiled.\n\n\"Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood, madame,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the queen; \"but his son?\"\n\n\"His son, madame, must be, since the husband of the son's mother is.\"\n\n\"And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville?\"\n\n\"No, madame, for I presume that the king, standing godfather to him,\ncould do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs,\ngiving his father, also, the government of Normandy.\"\n\n\"As to the government of Normandy,\" replied the queen, \"I think I can\npromise; but with regard to the present, the cardinal is always telling\nme there is no more money in the royal coffers.\"\n\n\"We shall search for some, madame, and I think we can find a little, and\nif your majesty approves, we will seek for some together.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"What next, madame?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"Haven't you, then, a fourth companion?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, the Comte de la Fere.\"\n\n\"What does he ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"There is in the world, then, one man who, having the power to ask,\nasks--nothing!\"\n\n\"There is the Comte de la Fere, madame. The Comte de la Fere is not a\nman.\"\n\n\"What is he, then?\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere is a demi-god.\"\n\n\"Has he not a son, a young man, a relative, a nephew, of whom Comminges\nspoke to me as being a brave boy, and who, with Monsieur de Chatillon,\nbrought the standards from Lens?\"\n\n\"He has, as your majesty has said, a ward, who is called the Vicomte de\nBragelonne.\"\n\n\"If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his\nguardian say?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he would accept.\"\n\n\"Perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes, if your majesty herself should beg him to accept.\"\n\n\"He must be indeed a strange man. Well, we will reflect and perhaps we\nwill beg him. Are you satisfied, sir?\"\n\n\"There is one thing the queen has not signed--her assent to the treaty.\"\n\n\"Of what use to-day? I will sign it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to-day she will not\nhave time to sign to-morrow. Consent, then, I beg you, madame, to write\nat the bottom of this schedule, which has been drawn up by Mazarin, as\nyou see:\n\n\"'I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Parisians.'\"\n\nAnne was caught, she could not draw back--she signed; but scarcely had\nshe done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep.\n\nD'Artagnan started on seeing these tears. Since that period of history\nqueens have shed tears, like other women.\n\nThe Gascon shook his head, these tears from royalty melted his heart.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, kneeling, \"look upon the unhappy man at your feet. He\nbegs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be\npossible to him. He has faith in himself; he has faith in his friends;\nhe wishes also to have faith in his queen. And in proof that he fears\nnothing, that he counts on nothing, he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin\nto your majesty without conditions. Behold, madame! here are the august\nsignatures of your majesty's hand; if you think you are right in giving\nthem to me, you shall do so, but from this very moment you are free from\nany obligation to keep them.\"\n\nAnd D'Artagnan, full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity, placed in\nAnne's hands, in a bundle, the papers that he had one by one won from\nher with so much difficulty.\n\nThere are moments--for if everything is not good, everything in this\nworld is not bad--in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is\nsoftened by the tears of strong emotion, heart-arraigning sentiment: one\nof these momentary impulses actuated Anne. D'Artagnan, when he gave\nway to his own feelings--which were in accordance with those of the\nqueen--had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could\nhave attempted. He was therefore instantly recompensed, either for his\naddress or for his sensibility, whichever it might be termed.\n\n\"You were right, sir,\" said Anne. \"I misunderstood you. There are the\nacts signed; I deliver them to you without compulsion. Go and bring me\nback the cardinal as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" faltered D'Artagnan, \"'tis twenty years ago--I have a good\nmemory--since I had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the Hotel de\nVille, of kissing one of those lovely hands.\"\n\n\"There is the other,\" replied the queen; \"and that the left hand should\nnot be less liberal than the right,\" she drew from her finger a diamond\nsimilar to the one formerly given to him, \"take and keep this ring in\nremembrance of me.\n\n\"Madame,\" said D'Artagnan, rising, \"I have only one thing more to wish,\nwhich is, that the next thing you ask from me, shall be--my life.\"\n\nAnd with this conclusion--a way peculiar to himself--he rose and left\nthe room.\n\n\"I never rightly understood those men,\" said the queen, as she watched\nhim retiring from her presence; \"and it is now too late, for in a year\nthe king will be of age.\"\n\nIn twenty-four hours D'Artagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the\nqueen; and the one received his commission, the other his patent of\nnobility.\n\nOn the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed, and it was everywhere\nannounced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order\nto draw it up with the greatest care.\n\nHere is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty:\n\nMonsieur de Conti received Damvilliers, and having made his proofs as\ngeneral, he succeeded in remaining a soldier, instead of being made\ncardinal. Moreover, something had been said of a marriage with Mazarin's\nniece. The idea was welcomed by the prince, to whom it was of little\nimportance whom he married, so long as he married some one.\n\nThe Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court, receiving ample\nreparation for the wrongs he had suffered, and all the honor due to his\nrank. Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape. He\nreceived also the office of admiral, which had been held by his\nfather, the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles,\ndemolished by the Parliament of Bretagne.\n\nThe Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his\nprincipality of Sedan, and the title of prince, granted to him and to\nthose belonging to his house.\n\nThe Duc de Longueville gained the government of Pont-de-l'Arche, five\nhundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son\nheld at the baptismal font by the young king and Henrietta of England.\n\nAramis stipulated that Bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that\nPlanchet should furnish the christening sugar plums.\n\nThe Duc d'Elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife, one\nhundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty-five thousand for\neach of the three others.\n\nThe coadjutor alone obtained nothing. They promised, indeed, to\nnegotiate with the pope for a cardinal's hat for him; but he knew how\nlittle reliance should be placed on such promises, made by the queen and\nMazarin. Quite contrary to the lot of Monsieur de Conti, unable to be\ncardinal, he was obliged to remain a soldier.\n\nAnd therefore, when all Paris was rejoicing in the expected return of\nthe king, appointed for the next day, Gondy alone, in the midst of the\ngeneral happiness, was dissatisfied; he sent for the two men whom he\nwas wont to summon when in especially bad humor. Those two men were the\nCount de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache. They came with\ntheir usual promptness, and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the\nnight.\n\n\n\n\n89. In which it is shown that it is sometimes more difficult for Kings\nto return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms, than to make an Exit.\n\n\n\nWhilst D'Artagnan and Porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to\nSaint Germain, Athos and Aramis returned to Paris.\n\nEach had his own particular visit to make.\n\nAramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville, where Madame de Longueville was\nsojourning. The duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace. War\nhad made her a queen; peace brought her abdication. She declared that\nshe would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war.\n\nBut when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light--that\nis to say, with all its advantages; when he had pointed out to her,\nin exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris, the\nviceroyalty of Font-de-l'Arche, in other words, of all Normandy; when\nhe had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the\ncardinal; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her\nby the king in holding her child at the baptismal font, Madame de\nLongueville contended no longer, except as is the custom with pretty\nwomen to contend, and defended herself only to surrender at last.\n\nAramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and\nwas unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her\nconversion.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"you have wished to conquer the prince your\nbrother--that is to say, the greatest captain of the age; and when women\nof genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it. You have\nsucceeded; the prince is beaten, since he can no longer fight. Now\nattach him to our party. Withdraw him gently from the queen, whom he\ndoes not like, from Mazarin, whom he despises. The Fronde is a comedy,\nof which the first act only is played. Let us wait for a denouement--for\nthe day when the prince, thanks to you, shall have turned against the\ncourt.\"\n\nMadame de Longueville was persuaded. This Frondist duchess trusted so\nconfidently to the power of her fine eyes, that she could not doubt\ntheir influence even over Monsieur de Conde; and the chronicles of the\ntime aver that her confidence was justified.\n\nAthos, on quitting Aramis, went to Madame de Chevreuse. Here was another\nfrondeuse to persuade, and she was even less open to conviction than her\nyounger rival. There had been no stipulation in her favor. Monsieur\nde Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province, and if the\nqueen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson\nor granddaughter. At the first announcement of peace Madame de Chevreuse\nfrowned, and in spite of all the logic of Athos to show her that a\nprolonged war would have been impracticable, contended in favor of\nhostilities.\n\n\"My fair friend,\" said Athos, \"allow me to tell you that everybody is\ntired of war. You will get yourself exiled, as you did in the time of\nLouis XIII. Believe me, we have passed the time of success in intrigue,\nand your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting Paris,\nwhere there will always be two queens as long as you are there.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the duchess, \"I cannot make war alone, but I can avenge\nmyself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite-on the honor\nof a duchess, I will avenge myself.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Athos, \"do not injure the Vicomte de Bragelonne--do\nnot ruin his prospects. Alas! excuse my weakness! There are moments when\na man grows young again in his children.\"\n\nThe duchess smiled, half tenderly, half ironically.\n\n\"Count,\" she said, \"you are, I fear, gained over to the court. I suppose\nyou have a blue ribbon in your pocket?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; I have that of the Garter, which King Charles I. gave me\nsome days before he died.\"\n\n\"Come, I am growing an old woman!\" said the duchess, pensively.\n\nAthos took her hand and kissed it. She sighed, as she looked at him.\n\n\"Count,\" she said, \"Bragelonne must be a charming place. You are a man\nof taste. You have water--woods--flowers there?\"\n\nShe sighed again and leaned her charming head, gracefully reclined, on\nher hand, still beautiful in form and color.\n\n\"Madame!\" exclaimed Athos, \"what were you saying just now about growing\nold? Never have I seen you look so young, so beautiful!\"\n\nThe duchess shook her head.\n\n\"Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris?\" she inquired.\n\n\"What think you of it?\" inquired Athos.\n\n\"Leave him with me,\" replied the duchess.\n\n\"No, madame; if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus, I, at least,\nremember it.\"\n\n\"Really, sir, you are delightful, and I should like to spend a month at\nBragelonne.\"\n\n\"Are you not afraid of making people envious of me, duchess?\" replied\nAthos.\n\n\"No, I shall go incognito, count, under the name of Marie Michon.\"\n\n\"You are adorable, madame.\"\n\n\"But do not keep Raoul with you.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he is in love.\"\n\n\"He! he is quite a child!\"\n\n\"And 'tis a child he loves.\"\n\nAthos became thoughtful.\n\n\"You are right, duchess. This singular passion for a child of seven may\nsome day make him very unhappy. There is to be war in Flanders. He shall\ngo thither.\"\n\n\"And at his return you will send him to me. I will arm him against\nlove.\"\n\n\"Alas, madame!\" exclaimed Athos, \"to-day love is like war--the\nbreastplate is becoming useless.\"\n\nRaoul entered at this moment; he came to announce that the solemn\nentrance of the king, queen, and her ministers was to take place on the\nensuing day.\n\nThe next day, in fact, at daybreak, the court made preparations to quit\nSaint Germain.\n\nMeanwhile, the queen every hour had been sending for D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I hear,\" she said, \"that Paris is not quiet. I am afraid for the king's\nsafety; place yourself close to the coach door on the right.\"\n\n\"Reassure yourself, madame, I will answer for the king's safety.\"\n\nAs he left the queen's presence Bernouin summoned him to the cardinal.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mazarin to him \"an emeute is spoken of in Paris. I shall be\non the king's left and as I am the chief person threatened, remain at\nthe coach door to the left.\"\n\n\"Your eminence may be perfectly easy,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"they will\nnot touch a hair of your head.\"\n\n\"Deuce take it!\" he thought to himself, \"how can I take care of both?\nAh! plague on't, I will guard the king and Porthos shall guard the\ncardinal.\"\n\nThis arrangement pleased every one. The queen had confidence in the\ncourage of D'Artagnan, which she knew, and the cardinal in the strength\nof Porthos, which he had experienced.\n\nThe royal procession set out for Paris. Guitant and Comminges, at the\nhead of the guards, marched first; then came the royal carriage, with\nD'Artagnan on one side, Porthos on the other; then the musketeers, for\ntwo and twenty years staunch friends of D'Artagnan. During twenty he had\nbeen lieutenant, their captain since the night before.\n\nThe cortege proceeded to Notre Dame, where a Te Deum was chanted. All\nParis were in the streets. The Swiss were drawn up along the road, but\nas the road was long, they were placed at six or eight feet distant\nfrom each other and one deep only. This force was therefore wholly\ninsufficient, and from time to time the line was broken through by the\npeople and was formed again with difficulty. Whenever this occurred,\nalthough it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king\nand queen, Anne looked at D'Artagnan anxiously.\n\nMazarin, who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry \"Long\nlive Mazarin,\" and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations\nbought at twenty pistoles each, kept one eye on Porthos; but that\ngigantic body-guard replied to the look with his great bass voice, \"Be\ntranquil, my lord,\" and Mazarin became more and more composed.\n\nAt the Palais Royal, the crowd, which had flowed in from the adjacent\nstreet was still greater; like an impetuous mob, a wave of human beings\ncame to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint\nHonore.\n\nWhen the procession reached the palace, loud cries of \"Long live their\nmajesties!\" resounded. Mazarin leaned out of the window. One or two\nshouts of \"Long live the cardinal\" saluted his shadow; but instantly\nhisses and yells stifled them remorselessly. Mazarin turned pale and\nshrank back in the coach.\n\n\"Low-born fellows!\" ejaculated Porthos.\n\nD'Artagnan said nothing, but twirled his mustache with a peculiar\ngesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake.\n\nAnne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young king's ear:\n\n\"Say something gracious to Monsieur d'Artagnan, my son.\"\n\nThe young king leaned toward the door.\n\n\"I have not said good-morning to you, Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" he said;\n\"nevertheless, I have remarked you. It was you who were behind my\nbed-curtains that night the Parisians wished to see me asleep.\"\n\n\"And if the king permits me,\" returned the Gascon, \"I shall be near him\nalways when there is danger to be encountered.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mazarin to Porthos, \"what would you do if the crowd fell\nupon us?\"\n\n\"Kill as many as I could, my lord.\"\n\n\"Hem! brave as you are and strong as you are, you could not kill them\nall.\"\n\n\"'Tis true,\" answered Porthos, rising on his saddle, in order that he\nmight appraise the immense crowd, \"there are a lot of them.\"\n\n\"I think I should like the other fellow better than this one,\" said\nMazarin to himself, and he threw himself back in his carriage.\n\nThe queen and her minister, more especially the latter, had reason to\nfeel anxious. The crowd, whilst preserving an appearance of respect and\neven of affection for the king and queen regent, began to be tumultuous.\nReports were whispered about, like certain sounds which announce, as\nthey whistle from wave to wave, the coming storm--and when they pass\nathwart a multitude, presage an emeute.\n\nD'Artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible\nto the crowd, but very easily understood by that chosen regiment, the\nflower of the army.\n\nThe ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to\nman.\n\nAt the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to stop.\nComminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen's carriage.\nAnne questioned D'Artagnan by a look. He answered in the same language.\n\n\"Proceed,\" she said.\n\nComminges returned to his post. An effort was made and the living\nbarrier was violently broken through.\n\nSome complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the\nking as well as the minister.\n\n\"Onward!\" cried D'Artagnan, in a loud voice.\n\n\"Onward!\" cried Porthos.\n\nBut as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to\nburst out, all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded\nsimultaneously. Cries of \"Down with Mazarin!\" \"Death to the cardinal!\"\nresounded on all sides.\n\nAt the same time through the streets of Grenelle, Saint Honore, and Du\nCoq, a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards\nand came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthos's horse and\nthat of D'Artagnan.\n\nThis new eruption was more dangerous than the others, being composed of\narmed men. It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those\nwho had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot, but a\nconcerted organized attack.\n\nEach of these mobs was led by a chief, one of whom appeared to belong,\nnot to the people, but to the honorable corporation of mendicants, and\nthe other, notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people, might\neasily be discerned to be a gentleman. Both were evidently stimulated by\nthe same impulse.\n\nThere was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage.\nMyriads of hoarse cries, forming one vast uproar, were heard, mingled\nwith guns firing.\n\n\"Ho! Musketeers!\" cried D'Artagnan.\n\nThe escort divided into two files. One of them passed around to the\nright of the carriage, the other to the left. One went to support\nD'Artagnan, the other Porthos. Then came a skirmish, the more terrible\nbecause it had no definite object; the more melancholy, because those\nengaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting. Like all popular\nmovements, the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable. The\nmusketeers, few in number, not being able, in the midst of this crowd,\nto make their horses wheel around, began to give way. D'Artagnan offered\nto lower the blinds of the royal carriage, but the young king stretched\nout his arm, saying:\n\n\"No, sir! I wish to see everything.\"\n\n\"If your majesty wishes to look out--well, then, look!\" replied\nD'Artagnan. And turning with that fury which made him so formidable, he\nrushed toward the chief of the insurgents, a man who, with a huge sword\nin his hand, was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the\nmusketeers.\n\n\"Make room!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Zounds! give way!\"\n\nAt these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head, but it\nwas too late. The blow was sped by D'Artagnan; the rapier had pierced\nhis bosom.\n\n\"Ah! confound it!\" cried the Gascon, trying in vain, too late, to\nretract the thrust. \"What the devil are you doing here, count?\"\n\n\"Accomplishing my destiny,\" replied Rochefort, falling on one knee. \"I\nhave already got up again after three stabs from you, I shall never rise\nafter this fourth.\"\n\n\"Count!\" said D'Artagnan, with some degree of emotion, \"I struck without\nknowing that it was you. I am sorry, if you die, that you should die\nwith sentiments of hatred toward me.\"\n\nRochefort extended his hand to D'Artagnan, who took it. The count wished\nto speak, but a gush of blood stifled him. He stiffened in the last\nconvulsions of death and expired.\n\n\"Back, people!\" cried D'Artagnan, \"your leader is dead; you have no\nlonger any business here.\"\n\nIndeed, as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack, the\ncrowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall.\nD'Artagnan charged, with a party of musketeers, up the Rue du Coq, and\nthe portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke, dispersing\nnear the Place Saint Germain-l'Auxerrois and taking the direction of the\nquays.\n\nD'Artagnan returned to help Porthos, if Porthos needed help; but\nPorthos, for his part, had done his work as conscientiously as\nD'Artagnan. The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right,\nand they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin, less heroic than\nthe king, had taken the precaution to lower.\n\nPorthos looked very melancholy.\n\n\"What a devil of a face you have, Porthos! and what a strange air for a\nvictor!\"\n\n\"But you,\" answered Porthos, \"seem to me agitated.\"\n\n\"There's a reason! Zounds! I have just killed an old friend.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Porthos, \"who?\"\n\n\"That poor Count de Rochefort.\"\n\n\"Well! exactly like me! I have just killed a man whose face is not\nunknown to me. Unluckily, I hit him on the head and immediately his face\nwas covered with blood.\"\n\n\"And he said nothing as he died?\"\n\n\"Yes; he exclaimed, 'Oh!'\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" answered D'Artagnan, laughing, \"if he only said that, it\ndid not enlighten you much.\"\n\n\"Well, sir!\" cried the queen.\n\n\"Madame, the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your\nroad.\"\n\nIn fact, the procession arrived, in safety at Notre Dame, at the front\ngate of which all the clergy, with the coadjutor at their head, awaited\nthe king, the queen and the minister, for whose happy return they\nchanted a Te Deum.\n\nAs the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great\nexcitement, ran to the sacristy, dressed himself quickly in the choir\nrobes, and cleaving, thanks to that uniform, the crowd that filled\nthe temple, approached Bazin, who, clad in his blue robe, was standing\ngravely in his place at the entrance to the choir.\n\nBazin felt some one pulling his sleeve. He lowered to earth his eyes,\nbeatifically raised to Heaven, and recognized Friquet.\n\n\"Well, you rascal, what is it? How do you dare to disturb me in the\nexercise of my functions?\" asked the beadle.\n\n\"Monsieur Bazin,\" said Friquet, \"Monsieur Maillard--you know who he is,\nhe gives holy water at Saint Eustache----\"\n\n\"Well, go on.\"\n\n\"Well, he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head. That\ngreat giant who was there gave it to him.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Bazin, \"he must be pretty sick.\"\n\n\"So sick that he is dying, and he wants to confess to the coadjutor,\nwho, they say, has power to remit great sins.\"\n\n\"And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him?\"\n\n\"To be sure; the coadjutor has promised.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Maillard himself.\"\n\n\"You have seen him, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I was there when he fell.\"\n\n\"What were you doing there?\"\n\n\"I was shouting, 'Down with Mazarin!' 'Death to the cardinal!' 'The\nItalian to the gallows!' Isn't that what you would have me shout?\"\n\n\"Be quiet, you rascal!\" said Bazin, looking uneasily around.\n\n\"So that he told me, that poor Monsieur Maillard, 'Go find the\ncoadjutor, Friquet, and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir.'\nSay, then, Father Bazin--the heir of Monsieur Maillard, the giver of\nholy water at Saint Eustache! Hey! I shall have nothing to do but to\nfold my arms! All the same, I should like to do him that service--what\ndo you say to it?\"\n\n\"I will tell the coadjutor,\" said Bazin.\n\nIn fact, he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke\nto him privately a few words, to which the latter responded by an\naffirmative sign. He then returned with the same slow step and said:\n\n\"Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient. Monseigneur will be\nwith him in an hour.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Friquet, \"my fortune is made.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said Bazin, \"where was he carried?\"\n\n\"To the tower Saint Jacques la Boucherie;\" and delighted with the\nsuccess of his embassy, Friquet started off at the top of his speed.\n\nWhen the Te Deum was over, the coadjutor, without stopping to change\nhis priestly dress, took his way toward that old tower which he knew\nso well. He arrived in time. Though sinking from moment to moment, the\nwounded man was not yet dead. The door was opened to the coadjutor of\nthe room in which the mendicant was suffering.\n\nA moment later Friquet went out, carrying in his hand a large leather\nbag; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great\nastonishment found it full of gold. The mendicant had kept his word and\nmade Friquet his heir.\n\n\"Ah! Mother Nanette!\" cried Friquet, suffocating; \"ah! Mother Nanette!\"\n\nHe could say no more; but though he hadn't strength to speak he had\nenough for action. He rushed headlong to the street, and like the Greek\nfrom Marathon who fell in the square at Athens, with his laurel in his\nhand, Friquet reached Councillor Broussel's threshold, and then fell\nexhausted, scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather\nbag.\n\nMother Nanette began by picking up the louis; then she picked up\nFriquet.\n\nIn the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal.\n\n\"That Monsieur d'Artagnan is a very brave man, mother,\" said the young\nking.\n\n\"Yes, my son; and he rendered very important services to your father.\nTreat him kindly, therefore, in the future.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" said the young king to D'Artagnan, on descending from the\ncarriage, \"the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to-day--you\nand your friend the Baron du Vallon.\"\n\nThat was a great honor for D'Artagnan and for Porthos. Porthos was\ndelighted; and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied.\n\n\"What was the matter with you, baron?\" D'Artagnan said to him as they\ndescended the staircase of the Palais Royal. \"You seemed at dinner to be\nanxious about something.\"\n\n\"I was trying,\" said Porthos, \"to recall where I had seen that mendicant\nwhom I must have killed.\"\n\n\"And you couldn't remember?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, search, my friend, search; and when you have found, you will tell\nme, will you not?\"\n\n\"Pardieu!\" said Porthos.\n\n\n\n\n90. Conclusion.\n\n\n\nOn going home, the two friends found a letter from Athos, who desired\nthem to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day.\n\nThe friends went to bed early, but neither of them slept. When we arrive\nat the summit of our wishes, success has usually the power to drive away\nsleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes.\n\nThe next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him\nand Aramis in traveling costume.\n\n\"What!\" cried Porthos, \"are we all going away, then? I, so, have made my\npreparations this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens! yes,\" said Aramis. \"There's nothing to do in Paris now\nthere's no Fronde. The Duchess de Longueville has invited me to pass\na few days in Normandy, and has deputed me, while her son is being\nbaptized, to go and prepare her residence at Rouen; after which,\nif nothing new occurs, I shall go and bury myself in my convent at\nNoisy-le-Sec.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Athos, \"am returning to Bragelonne. You know, dear\nD'Artagnan, I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman.\nRaoul has no fortune other than I possess, poor child! and I must take\ncare of it for him, since I only lend him my name.\"\n\n\"And Raoul--what shall you do with him?\"\n\n\"I leave him with you, my friend. War has broken out in Flanders. You\nshall take him with you there. I am afraid that remaining at Blois would\nbe dangerous to his youthful mind. Take him and teach him to be as brave\nand loyal as you are yourself.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"though I shall not have you, Athos, at all\nevents I shall have that dear fair-haired head by me; and though he's\nbut a boy, yet, since your soul lives again in him, dear Athos, I shall\nalways fancy that you are near me, sustaining and encouraging me.\"\n\nThe four friends embraced with tears in their eyes.\n\nThen they departed, without knowing whether they would ever see each\nother again.\n\nD'Artagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos, still possessed\nby the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed. On arriving\nat the Hotel de la Chevrette they found the baron's equipage all really\nand Mousqueton on his saddle.\n\n\"Come, D'Artagnan,\" said Porthos, \"bid adieu to your sword and go\nwith me to Pierrefonds, to Bracieux, or to Du Vallon. We will grow old\ntogether and talk of our companions.\"\n\n\"No!\" replied D'Artagnan, \"deuce take it, the campaign is going to\nbegin; I wish to be there, I expect to get something by it.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to get?\"\n\n\"Why, I expect to be made Marechal of France!\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" cried Porthos, who was not completely taken in by D'Artagnan's\nGasconades.\n\n\"Come my brother, go with me,\" added D'Artagnan, \"and I will see that\nyou are made a duke!\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Porthos, \"Mouston has no desire to fight; besides, they\nhave erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony, which will kill\nmy neighbors with envy.\"\n\n\"To that I can say nothing,\" returned D'Artagnan, who knew the vanity of\nthe new baron. \"Then, here's to our next merry meeting!\"\n\n\"Adieu, dear captain,\" said Porthos, \"I shall always be happy to welcome\nyou to my barony.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, when the campaign is over,\" replied the Gascon.\n\n\"His honor's equipage is waiting,\" said Mousqueton.\n\nThe two friends, after a cordial pressure of the hands, separated.\nD'Artagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a\nmournful gaze, when the baron, after walking scarcely more than twenty\npaces, returned--stood still--struck his forehead with his finger and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"I recollect!\"\n\n\"What?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Who the beggar was that I killed.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed! and who was he?\"\n\n\"'Twas that low fellow, Bonacieux.\"\n\nAnd Porthos, enchanted at having relieved his mind, rejoined Mousqueton\nand they disappeared around an angle of the street. D'Artagnan stood for\nan instant, mute, pensive and motionless; then, as he went in, he saw\nthe fair Madeleine, his hostess, standing on the threshold.\n\n\"Madeleine,\" said the Gascon, \"give me your apartment on the first\nfloor; now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an\nappearance; nevertheless, reserve my old room on the fifth story for me;\none never knows what may happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Twenty Years After, by Alexandre Dumas, Pere\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TWENTY YEARS AFTER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1259.txt or 1259.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/5/1259/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
