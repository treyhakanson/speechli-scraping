THE QUEEN'S GOOD-BY\n\nA man who has lived in the world, marking how every act, although\nin itself perhaps light and insignificant, may become the source of\nconsequences that spread far and wide, and flow for years or centuries,\ncould scarcely feel secure in reckoning that with the death of the\nDuke of Strelsau and the restoration of King Rudolf to liberty and his\nthrone, there would end, for good and all, the troubles born of Black\nMichael's daring conspiracy. The stakes had been high, the struggle\nkeen; the edge of passion had been sharpened, and the seeds of enmity\nsown. Yet Michael, having struck for the crown, had paid for the blow\nwith his life: should there not then be an end? Michael was dead,\nthe Princess her cousin's wife, the story in safe keeping, and Mr.\nRassendyll's face seen no more in Ruritania. Should there not then be an\nend? So said I to my friend the Constable of Zenda, as we talked by the\nbedside of Marshal Strakencz. The old man, already nearing the death\nthat soon after robbed us of his aid and counsel, bowed his head in\nassent: in the aged and ailing the love of peace breeds hope of it. But\nColonel Sapt tugged at his gray moustache, and twisted his black cigar\nin his mouth, saying, \"You're very sanguine, friend Fritz. But is Rupert\nof Hentzau dead? I had not heard it.\"\n\nWell said, and like old Sapt! Yet the man is little without the\nopportunity, and Rupert by himself could hardly have troubled our\nrepose. Hampered by his own guilt, he dared not set his foot in the\nkingdom from which by rare good luck he had escaped, but wandered to and\nfro over Europe, making a living by his wits, and, as some said, adding\nto his resources by gallantries for which he did not refuse substantial\nrecompense. But he kept himself constantly before our eyes, and never\nceased to contrive how he might gain permission to return and enjoy the\nestates to which his uncle's death had entitled him. The chief agent\nthrough whom he had the effrontery to approach the king was his\nrelative, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, a young man of high rank and\ngreat wealth who was devoted to Rupert. The count fulfilled his mission\nwell: acknowledging Rupert's heavy offences, he put forward in his\nbehalf the pleas of youth and of the predominant influence which Duke\nMichael had exercised over his adherent, and promised, in words so\nsignificant as to betray Rupert's own dictation, a future fidelity no\nless discreet than hearty. \"Give me my price and I'll hold my tongue,\"\nseemed to come in Rupert's off-hand accents through his cousin's\ndeferential lips. As may be supposed, however, the king and those who\nadvised him in the matter, knowing too well the manner of man the\nCount of Hentzau was, were not inclined to give ear to his ambassador's\nprayer. We kept firm hold on Master Rupert's revenues, and as good watch\nas we could on his movements; for we were most firmly determined that\nhe should never return to Ruritania. Perhaps we might have obtained his\nextradition and hanged him on the score of his crimes; but in these days\nevery rogue who deserves no better than to be strung up to the nearest\ntree must have what they call a fair trial; and we feared that, if\nRupert were handed over to our police and arraigned before the courts\nat Strelsau, the secret which we guarded so sedulously would become the\ngossip of all the city, ay, and of all Europe. So Rupert went unpunished\nexcept by banishment and the impounding of his rents.\n\nYet Sapt was in the right about him. Helpless as he seemed, he did\nnot for an instant abandon the contest. He lived in the faith that his\nchance would come, and from day to day was ready for its coming. He\nschemed against us as we schemed to protect ourselves from him; if\nwe watched him, he kept his eye on us. His ascendency over\nLuzau-Rischenheim grew markedly greater after a visit which his cousin\npaid to him in Paris. From this time the young count began to supply\nhim with resources. Thus armed, he gathered instruments round him and\norganized a system of espionage that carried to his ears all our actions\nand the whole position of affairs at court. He knew, far more accurately\nthan anyone else outside the royal circle, the measures taken for the\ngovernment of the kingdom and the considerations that dictated the royal\npolicy. More than this, he possessed himself of every detail concerning\nthe king's health, although the utmost reticence was observed on\nthis subject. Had his discoveries stopped there, they would have been\nvexatious and disquieting, but perhaps of little serious harm. They\nwent further. Set on the track by his acquaintance with what had passed\nduring Mr. Rassendyll's tenure of the throne, he penetrated the secret\nwhich had been kept successfully from the king himself. In the knowledge\nof it he found the opportunity for which he had waited; in its bold use\nhe discerned his chance. I cannot say whether he were influenced more\nstrongly by his desire to reestablish his position in the kingdom or\nby the grudge he bore against Mr. Rassendyll. He loved power and money;\ndearly he loved revenge also. No doubt both motives worked together, and\nhe was rejoiced to find that the weapon put into his hand had a double\nedge; with one he hoped to cut his own path clear; with the other, to\nwound the man he hated through the woman whom that man loved. In fine,\nthe Count of Hentzau, shrewdly discerning the feeling that existed\nbetween the queen and Rudolf Rassendyll, set his spies to work, and\nwas rewarded by discovering the object of my yearly meetings with Mr.\nRassendyll. At least he conjectured the nature of my errand; this was\nenough for him. Head and hand were soon busy in turning the knowledge to\naccount; scruples of the heart never stood in Rupert's way.\n\nThe marriage which had set all Ruritania on fire with joy and formed\nin the people's eyes the visible triumph over Black Michael and his\nfellow-conspirators was now three years old. For three years the\nPrincess Flavia had been queen. I am come by now to the age when a man\nshould look out on life with an eye undimmed by the mists of passion.\nMy love-making days are over; yet there is nothing for which I am more\nthankful to Almighty God than the gift of my wife's love. In storm it\nhas been my anchor, and in clear skies my star. But we common folk are\nfree to follow our hearts; am I an old fool for saying that he is a fool\nwho follows anything else? Our liberty is not for princes. We need wait\nfor no future world to balance the luck of men; even here there is an\nequipoise. From the highly placed a price is exacted for their state,\ntheir wealth, and their honors, as heavy as these are great; to the\npoor, what is to us mean and of no sweetness may appear decked in the\nrobes of pleasure and delight. Well, if it were not so, who could sleep\nat nights? The burden laid on Queen Flavia I knew, and know, so well as\na man can know it. I think it needs a woman to know it fully; for even\nnow my wife's eyes fill with tears when we speak of it. Yet she bore it,\nand if she failed in anything, I wonder that it was in so little. For\nit was not only that she had never loved the king and had loved another\nwith all her heart. The king's health, shattered by the horror and\nrigors of his imprisonment in the castle of Zenda, soon broke utterly.\nHe lived, indeed; nay, he shot and hunted, and kept in his hand some\nmeasure, at least, of government. But always from the day of his release\nhe was a fretful invalid, different utterly from the gay and jovial\nprince whom Michael's villains had caught in the shooting lodge. There\nwas worse than this. As time went on, the first impulse of gratitude and\nadmiration that he had felt towards Mr. Rassendyll died away. He came to\nbrood more and more on what had passed while he was a prisoner; he was\npossessed not only by a haunting dread of Rupert of Hentzau, at whose\nhands he had suffered so greatly, but also by a morbid, half mad\njealousy of Mr. Rassendyll. Rudolf had played the hero while he lay\nhelpless. Rudolf's were the exploits for which his own people cheered\nhim in his own capital. Rudolf's were the laurels that crowned his\nimpatient brow. He had enough nobility to resent his borrowed credit,\nwithout the fortitude to endure it manfully. And the hateful comparison\nstruck him nearer home. Sapt would tell him bluntly that Rudolf did this\nor that, set this precedent or that, laid down this or the other policy,\nand that the king could do no better than follow in Rudolf's steps. Mr.\nRassendyll's name seldom passed his wife's lips, but when she spoke of\nhim it was as one speaks of a great man who is dead, belittling all\nthe living by the shadow of his name. I do not believe that the king\ndiscerned that truth which his wife spent her days in hiding from him;\nyet he was uneasy if Rudolf's name were mentioned by Sapt or myself, and\nfrom the queen's mouth he could not bear it. I have seen him fall into\nfits of passion on the mere sound of it; for he lost control of himself\non what seemed slight provocation.\n\nMoved by this disquieting jealousy, he sought continually to exact from\nthe queen proofs of love and care beyond what most husbands can boast\nof, or, in my humble judgment, make good their right to, always asking\nof her what in his heart he feared was not hers to give. Much she did\nin pity and in duty; but in some moments, being but human and herself a\nwoman of high temper, she failed; then the slight rebuff or involuntary\ncoldness was magnified by a sick man's fancy into great offence or\nstudied insult, and nothing that she could do would atone for it. Thus\nthey, who had never in truth come together, drifted yet further apart;\nhe was alone in his sickness and suspicion, she in her sorrows and\nher memories. There was no child to bridge the gulf between them, and\nalthough she was his queen and his wife, she grew almost a stranger to\nhim. So he seemed to will that it should be.\n\nThus, worse than widowed, she lived for three years; and once only in\neach year she sent three words to the man she loved, and received from\nhim three words in answer. Then her strength failed her. A pitiful scene\nhad occurred in which the king peevishly upbraided her in regard to some\ntrivial matter--the occasion escapes my memory--speaking to her before\nothers words that even alone she could not have listened to with\ndignity. I was there, and Sapt; the colonel's small eyes had gleamed in\nanger. \"I should like to shut his mouth for him,\" I heard him mutter,\nfor the king's waywardness had well-nigh worn out even his devotion. The\nthing, of which I will say no more, happened a day or two before I\nwas to set out to meet Mr. Rassendyll. I was to seek him this time at\nWintenberg, for I had been recognized the year before at Dresden;\nand Wintenberg, being a smaller place and less in the way of chance\nvisitors, was deemed safer. I remember well how she was when she called\nme into her own room, a few hours after she had left the king. She stood\nby the table; the box was on it, and I knew well that the red rose and\nthe message were within. But there was more to-day. Without preface she\nbroke into the subject of my errand.\n\n\"I must write to him,\" she said. \"I can't bear it, I must write. My dear\nfriend Fritz, you will carry it safely for me, won't you? And he must\nwrite to me. And you'll bring that safely, won't you? Ah, Fritz, I know\nI'm wrong, but I'm starved, starved, starved! And it's for the last\ntime. For I know now that if I send anything, I must send more. So after\nthis time I won't send at all. But I must say good-by to him; I must\nhave his good-by to carry me through my life. This once, then, Fritz, do\nit for me.\"\n\nThe tears rolled down her cheeks, which to-day were flushed out of their\npaleness to a stormy red; her eyes defied me even while they pleaded. I\nbent my head and kissed her hand.\n\n\"With God's help I'll carry it safely and bring his safely, my queen,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"And tell me how he looks. Look at him closely, Fritz. See if he is well\nand seems strong. Oh, and make him merry and happy! Bring that smile to\nhis lips, Fritz, and the merry twinkle to his eyes. When you speak of\nme, see if he--if he looks as if he still loved me.\" But then she broke\noff, crying, \"But don't tell him I said that. He'd be grieved if I\ndoubted his love. I don't doubt it; I don't, indeed; but still tell me\nhow he looks when you speak of me, won't you, Fritz? See, here's the\nletter.\"\n\nTaking it from her bosom, she kissed it before she gave it to me. Then\nshe added a thousand cautions, how I was to carry her letter, how I was\nto go and how return, and how I was to run no danger, because my wife\nHelga loved me as well as she would have loved her husband had Heaven\nbeen kinder. \"At least, almost as I should, Fritz,\" she said, now\nbetween smiles and tears. She would not believe that any woman could\nlove as she loved.\n\nI left the queen and went to prepare for my journey. I used to take only\none servant with me, and I had chosen a different man each year. None\nof them had known that I met Mr. Rassendyll, but supposed that I was\nengaged on the private business which I made my pretext for obtaining\nleave of absence from the king. This time I had determined to take with\nme a Swiss youth who had entered my service only a few weeks before.\nHis name was Bauer; he seemed a stolid, somewhat stupid fellow, but as\nhonest as the day and very obliging.\n\nHe had come to me well recommended, and I had not hesitated to engage\nhim. I chose him for my companion now, chiefly because he was a\nforeigner and therefore less likely to gossip with the other servants\nwhen we returned. I do not pretend to much cleverness, but I confess\nthat it vexes me to remember how that stout, guileless-looking youth\nmade a fool of me. For Rupert knew that I had met Mr. Rassendyll the\nyear before at Dresden; Rupert was keeping a watchful eye on all that\npassed in Strelsau; Rupert had procured the fellow his fine testimonials\nand sent him to me, in the hope that he would chance on something of\nadvantage to his employer. My resolve to take him to Wintenberg may\nhave been hoped for, but could scarcely have been counted on; it was the\nadded luck that waits so often on the plans of a clever schemer.\n\nGoing to take leave of the king, I found him huddled over the fire.\nThe day was not cold, but the damp chill of his dungeon seemed to have\npenetrated to the very core of his bones. He was annoyed at my going,\nand questioned me peevishly about the business that occasioned my\njourney. I parried his curiosity as I best could, but did not succeed\nin appeasing his ill-humor. Half ashamed of his recent outburst,\nhalf-anxious to justify it to himself, he cried fretfully:\n\n\"Business! Yes, any business is a good enough excuse for leaving me! By\nHeaven, I wonder if a king was ever served so badly as I am! Why did you\ntrouble to get me out of Zenda? Nobody wants me, nobody cares whether I\nlive or die.\"\n\nTo reason with such a mood was impossible. I could only assure him that\nI would hasten my return by all possible means.\n\n\"Yes, pray do,\" said he. \"I want somebody to look after me. Who knows\nwhat that villain Rupert may attempt against me? And I can't defend\nmyself can I? I'm not Rudolf Rassendyll, am I?\"\n\nThus, with a mixture of plaintiveness and malice, he scolded me. At last\nI stood silent, waiting till he should be pleased to dismiss me. At any\nrate I was thankful that he entertained no suspicion as to my errand.\nHad I spoken a word of Mr. Rassendyll he would not have let me go. He\nhad fallen foul of me before on learning that I was in communication\nwith Rudolf; so completely had jealousy destroyed gratitude in his\nbreast. If he had known what I carried, I do not think that he could\nhave hated his preserver more. Very likely some such feeling was natural\nenough; it was none the less painful to perceive.\n\nOn leaving the king's presence, I sought out the Constable of Zenda. He\nknew my errand; and, sitting down beside him, I told him of the letter\nI carried, and arranged how to apprise him of my fortune surely and\nquickly. He was not in a good humor that day: the king had ruffled him\nalso, and Colonel Sapt had no great reserve of patience.\n\n\"If we haven't cut one another's throats before then, we shall all be at\nZenda by the time you arrive at Wintenberg,\" he said. \"The court moves\nthere to-morrow, and I shall be there as long as the king is.\"\n\nHe paused, and then added: \"Destroy the letter if there's any danger.\"\n\nI nodded my head.\n\n\"And destroy yourself with it, if there's the only way,\" he went on with\na surly smile. \"Heaven knows why she must send such a silly message at\nall; but since she must, she'd better have sent me with it.\"\n\nI knew that Sapt was in the way of jeering at all sentiment, and I\ntook no notice of the terms that he applied to the queen's farewell. I\ncontented myself with answering the last part of what he said.\n\n\"No, it's better you should be here,\" I urged. \"For if I should lose the\nletter--though there's little chance of it--you could prevent it from\ncoming to the king.\"\n\n\"I could try,\" he grinned. \"But on my life, to run the chance for a\nletter's sake! A letter's a poor thing to risk the peace of a kingdom\nfor.\"\n\n\"Unhappily,\" said I, \"it's the only thing that a messenger can well\ncarry.\"\n\n\"Off with you, then,\" grumbled the colonel. \"Tell Rassendyll from me\nthat he did well. But tell him to do something more. Let 'em say good-by\nand have done with it. Good God, is he going to waste all his life\nthinking of a woman he never sees?\" Sapt's air was full of indignation.\n\n\"What more is he to do?\" I asked. \"Isn't his work here done?\"\n\n\"Ay, it's done. Perhaps it's done,\" he answered. \"At least he has given\nus back our good king.\"\n\nTo lay on the king the full blame for what he was would have been rank\ninjustice. Sapt was not guilty of it, but his disappointment was bitter\nthat all our efforts had secured no better ruler for Ruritania. Sapt\ncould serve, but he liked his master to be a man.\n\n\"Ay, I'm afraid the lad's work here is done,\" he said, as I shook him\nby the hand. Then a sudden light came in his eyes. \"Perhaps not,\" he\nmuttered. \"Who knows?\"\n\nA man need not, I hope, be deemed uxorious for liking a quiet dinner\nalone with his wife before he starts on a long journey. Such, at least,\nwas my fancy; and I was annoyed to find that Helga's cousin, Anton von\nStrofzin, had invited himself to share our meal and our farewell. He\nconversed with his usual airy emptiness on all the topics that were\nsupplying Strelsau with gossip. There were rumors that the king was\nill; that the queen was angry at being carried off to Zenda; that the\narchbishop meant to preach against low dresses; that the chancellor was\nto be dismissed; that his daughter was to be married; and so forth.\nI heard without listening. But the last bit of his budget caught my\nwandering attention.\n\n\"They were betting at the club,\" said Anton, \"that Rupert of Hentzau\nwould be recalled. Have you heard anything about it, Fritz?\"\n\nIf I had known anything, it is needless to say that I should not have\nconfided it to Anton. But the suggested step was so utterly at variance\nwith the king's intentions that I made no difficulty about contradicting\nthe report with an authoritative air. Anton heard me with a judicial\nwrinkle on his smooth brow.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said he, \"and I dare say you're bound to say so.\nAll I know is that Rischenheim dropped a hint to Colonel Markel a day or\ntwo ago.\"\n\n\"Rischenheim believes what he hopes,\" said I.\n\n\"And where's he gone?\" cried Anton, exultantly. \"Why has he suddenly\nleft Strelsau? I tell you he's gone to meet Rupert, and I'll bet you\nwhat you like he carries some proposal. Ah, you don't know everything,\nFritz, my boy?\"\n\nIt was indeed true that I did not know everything. I made haste to admit\nas much. \"I didn't even know that the count was gone, much less why he's\ngone,\" said I.\n\n\"You see?\" exclaimed Anton. And he added, patronizingly, \"You should\nkeep your ears open, my boy; then you might be worth what the king pays\nyou.\"\n\n\"No less, I trust,\" said I, \"for he pays me nothing.\" Indeed, at this\ntime I held no office save the honorary position of chamberlain to\nHer Majesty. Any advice the king needed from me was asked and given\nunofficially.\n\nAnton went off, persuaded that he had scored a point against me. I could\nnot see where. It was possible that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim had\ngone to meet his cousin, equally possible that no such business claimed\nhis care. At any rate, the matter was not for me. I had a more pressing\naffair in hand. Dismissing the whole thing from my mind, I bade the\nbutler tell Bauer to go forward with my luggage and to let my carriage\nbe at the door in good time. Helga had busied herself, since our guest's\ndeparture, in preparing small comforts for my journey; now she came\nto me to say good-by. Although she tried to hide all signs of it, I\ndetected an uneasiness in her manner. She did not like these errands of\nmine, imagining dangers and risks of which I saw no likelihood. I would\nnot give in to her mood, and, as I kissed her, I bade her expect me back\nin a few days' time. Not even to her did I speak of the new and more\ndangerous burden that I carried, although I was aware that she enjoyed a\nfull measure of the queen's confidence.\n\n\"My love to King Rudolf, the real King Rudolf,\" said she. \"Though you\ncarry what will make him think little of my love.\"\n\n\"I have no desire he should think too much of it, sweet,\" said I. She\ncaught me by the hands, and looked up in my face.\n\n\"What a friend you are, aren't you, Fritz?\" said she. \"You worship Mr.\nRassendyll. I know you think I should worship him too, if he asked me.\nWell, I shouldn't. I am foolish enough to have my own idol.\" All my\nmodesty did not let me doubt who her idol might be. Suddenly she drew\nnear to me and whispered in my ear. I think that our own happiness\nbrought to her a sudden keen sympathy with her mistress.\n\n\"Make him send her a loving message, Fritz,\" she whispered. \"Something\nthat will comfort her. Her idol can't be with her as mine is with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, he'll send something to comfort her,\" I answered. \"And God keep\nyou, my dear.\"\n\nFor he would surely send an answer to the letter that I carried, and\nthat answer I was sworn to bring safely to her. So I set out in good\nheart, bearing in the pocket of my coat the little box and the queen's\ngood-by. And, as Colonel Sapt said to me, both I would destroy, if need\nwere--ay, and myself with them. A man did not serve Queen Flavia with\ndivided mind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A STATION WITHOUT A CAB\n\nThe arrangements for my meeting with Mr. Rassendyll had been carefully\nmade by correspondence before he left England. He was to be at the\nGolden Lion Hotel at eleven o'clock on the night of the 15th of October.\nI reckoned to arrive in the town between eight and nine on the same\nevening, to proceed to another hotel, and, on pretence of taking a\nstroll, slip out and call on him at the appointed hour. I should then\nfulfil my commission, take his answer, and enjoy the rare pleasure of\na long talk with him. Early the next morning he would have left\nWintenberg, and I should be on my way back to Strelsau. I knew that he\nwould not fail to keep his appointment, and I was perfectly confident of\nbeing able to carry out the programme punctually; I had, however, taken\nthe precaution of obtaining a week's leave of absence, in case any\nunforeseen accident should delay my return. Conscious of having done\nall I could to guard against misunderstanding or mishap, I got into the\ntrain in a tolerably peaceful frame of mind. The box was in my inner\npocket, the letter in a portemonnaie. I could feel them both with my\nhand. I was not in uniform, but I took my revolver. Although I had no\nreason to anticipate any difficulties, I did not forget that what I\ncarried must be protected at all hazards and all costs.\n\nThe weary night journey wore itself away. Bauer came to me in the\nmorning, performed his small services, repacked my hand-bag, procured\nme some coffee, and left me. It was then about eight o'clock; we had\narrived at a station of some importance and were not to stop again till\nmid-day. I saw Bauer enter the second-class compartment in which he\nwas traveling, and settled down in my own coupe. I think it was at this\nmoment that the thought of Rischenheim came again into my head, and I\nfound myself wondering why he clung to the hopeless idea of compassing\nRupert's return and what business had taken him from Strelsau. But I\nmade little of the matter, and, drowsy from a broken night's rest, soon\nfell into a doze. I was alone in the carriage and could sleep without\nfear or danger. I was awakened by our noontide halt. Here I saw Bauer\nagain. After taking a basin of soup, I went to the telegraph bureau to\nsend a message to my wife; the receipt of it would not merely set her\nmind at case, but would also ensure word of my safe progress reaching\nthe queen. As I entered the bureau I met Bauer coming out of it. He\nseemed rather startled at our encounter, but told me readily enough\nthat he had been telegraphing for rooms at Wintenberg, a very needless\nprecaution, since there was no danger of the hotel being full. In fact\nI was annoyed, as I especially wished to avoid calling attention to my\narrival. However, the mischief was done, and to rebuke my servant might\nhave aggravated it by setting his wits at work to find out my motive for\nsecrecy. So I said nothing, but passed by him with a nod. When the whole\ncircumstances came to light, I had reason to suppose that besides\nhis message to the inn-keeper, Bauer sent one of a character and to a\nquarter unsuspected by me.\n\nWe stopped once again before reaching Wintenberg. I put my head out of\nthe window to look about me, and saw Bauer standing near the luggage\nvan. He ran to me eagerly, asking whether I required anything. I told\nhim \"nothing\"; but instead of going away, he began to talk to me.\nGrowing weary of him, I returned to my seat and waited impatiently for\nthe train to go on. There was a further delay of five minutes, and then\nwe started.\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" I exclaimed, leaning back comfortably in my seat and\ntaking a cigar from my case.\n\nBut in a moment the cigar rolled unheeded on to the floor, as I sprang\neagerly to my feet and darted to the window. For just as we were\nclearing the station, I saw being carried past the carriage, on the\nshoulders of a porter, a bag which looked very much like mine. Bauer\nhad been in charge of my bag, and it had been put in the van under his\ndirections. It seemed unlikely that it should be taken out now by any\nmistake. Yet the bag I saw was very like the bag I owned. But I was not\nsure, and could have done nothing had I been sure. We were not to stop\nagain before Wintenberg, and, with my luggage or without it, I myself\nmust be in the town that evening.\n\nWe arrived punctual to our appointed time. I sat in the carriage a\nmoment or two, expecting Bauer to open the door and relieve me of my\nsmall baggage. He did not come, so I got out. It seemed that I had few\nfellow-passengers, and these were quickly disappearing on foot or in\ncarriages and carts that waited outside the station. I stood looking for\nmy servant and my luggage. The evening was mild; I was encumbered with\nmy hand-bag and a heavy fur coat. There were no signs either of Bauer or\nof baggage. I stayed where I was for five or six minutes. The guard of\nthe train had disappeared, but presently I observed the station-master;\nhe seemed to be taking a last glance round the premises. Going up to him\nI asked whether he had seen my servant; he could give me no news of\nhim. I had no luggage ticket, for mine had been in Bauer's hands; but I\nprevailed on him to allow me to look at the baggage which had arrived;\nmy property was not among it. The station-master was inclined, I think,\nto be a little skeptical as to the existence both of bag and of\nservant. His only suggestion was that the man must have been left behind\naccidentally. I pointed out that in this case he would not have had\nthe bag with him, but that it would have come on in the train. The\nstation-master admitted the force of my argument; he shrugged his\nshoulders and spread his hands out; he was evidently at the end of his\nresources.\n\nNow, for the first time and with sudden force, a doubt of Bauer's\nfidelity thrust itself into my mind. I remembered how little I knew of\nthe fellow and how great my charge was. Three rapid movements of my\nhand assured me that letter, box, and revolver were in their respective\nplaces. If Bauer had gone hunting in the bag, he had drawn a blank. The\nstation-master noticed nothing; he was stating at the dim gas lamp that\nhung from the roof. I turned to him.\n\n\"Well, tell him when he comes--\" I began.\n\n\"He won't come to-night, now,\" interrupted the stationmaster, none too\npolitely. \"No other train arrives to-night.\"\n\n\"Tell him when he does come to follow me at once to the Wintenbergerhof.\nI'm going there immediately.\" For time was short, and I did not wish to\nkeep Mr. Rassendyll waiting. Besides, in my new-born nervousness, I was\nanxious to accomplish my errand as soon as might be. What had become\nof Bauer? The thought returned, and now with it another, that seemed\nto connect itself in some subtle way with my present position: why and\nwhither had the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim set out from Strelsau a day\nbefore I started on my journey to Wintenberg?\n\n\"If he comes I'll tell him,\" said the station-master, and as he spoke he\nlooked round the yard.\n\nThere was not a cab to be seen! I knew that the station lay on the\nextreme outskirts of the town, for I had passed through Wintenberg on\nmy wedding journey, nearly three years before. The trouble involved in\nwalking, and the further waste of time, put the cap on my irritation.\n\n\"Why don't you have enough cabs?\" I asked angrily.\n\n\"There are plenty generally, sir,\" he answered more civilly, with an\napologetic air. \"There would be to-night but for an accident.\"\n\nAnother accident! This expedition of mine seemed doomed to be the sport\nof chance.\n\n\"Just before your train arrived,\" he continued, \"a local came in. As\na rule, hardly anybody comes by it, but to-night a number of men--oh,\ntwenty or five-and-twenty, I should think--got out. I collected their\ntickets myself, and they all came from the first station on the line.\nWell, that's not so strange, for there's a good beer-garden there. But,\ncuriously enough, every one of them hired a separate cab and drove off,\nlaughing and shouting to one another as they went. That's how it happens\nthat there were only one or two cabs left when your train came in, and\nthey were snapped up at once.\"\n\nTaken alone, this occurrence was nothing; but I asked myself whether the\nconspiracy that had robbed me of my servant had deprived me of a vehicle\nalso.\n\n\"What sort of men were they?\" I asked.\n\n\"All sorts of men, sir,\" answered the station-master, \"but most of them\nwere shabby-looking fellows. I wondered where some of them had got the\nmoney for their ride.\"\n\nThe vague feeling of uneasiness which had already attacked me grew\nstronger. Although I fought against it, calling myself an old woman\nand a coward, I must confess to an impulse which almost made me beg\nthe station-master's company on my walk; but, besides being ashamed\nto exhibit a timidity apparently groundless, I was reluctant to draw\nattention to myself in any way. I would not for the world have it\nsupposed that I carried anything of value.\n\n\"Well, there's no help for it,\" said I, and, buttoning my heavy coat\nabout me, I took my hand-bag and stick in one hand, and asked my way\nto the hotel. My misfortunes had broken down the station-master's\nindifference, and he directed me in a sympathetic tone.\n\n\"Straight along the road, sir,\" said he, \"between the poplars, for hard\non half a mile; then the houses begin, and your hotel is in the first\nsquare you come to, on the right.\"\n\nI thanked him curtly (for I had not quite forgiven him his earlier\nincivility), and started on my walk, weighed down by my big coat and\nthe handbag. When I left the lighted station yard I realized that the\nevening had fallen very dark, and the shade of the tall lank trees\nintensified the gloom. I could hardly see my way, and went timidly, with\nfrequent stumbles over the uneven stones of the road. The lamps were\ndim, few, and widely separated; so far as company was concerned, I might\nhave been a thousand miles from an inhabited house. In spite of myself,\nthe thought of danger persistently assailed my mind. I began to review\nevery circumstance of my journey, twisting the trivial into some ominous\nshape, magnifying the significance of everything which might justly\nseem suspicious, studying in the light of my new apprehensions every\nexpression of Bauer's face and every word that had fallen from his lips.\nI could not persuade myself into security. I carried the queen's letter,\nand--well, I would have given much to have old Sapt or Rudolf Rassendyll\nby my side.\n\nNow, when a man suspects danger, let him not spend his time in asking\nwhether there be really danger or in upbraiding himself for timidity,\nbut let him face his cowardice, and act as though the danger were real.\nIf I had followed that rule and kept my eyes about me, scanning the\nsides of the road and the ground in front of my feet, instead of losing\nmyself in a maze of reflection, I might have had time to avoid the trap,\nor at least to get my hand to my revolver and make a fight for it; or,\nindeed, in the last resort, to destroy what I carried before harm came\nto it. But my mind was preoccupied, and the whole thing seemed to happen\nin a minute. At the very moment that I had declared to myself the vanity\nof my fears and determined to be resolute in banishing them, I heard\nvoices--a low, strained whispering; I saw two or three figures in the\nshadow of the poplars by the wayside. An instant later, a dart was made\nat me. While I could fly I would not fight; with a sudden forward plunge\nI eluded the men who rushed at me, and started at a run towards the\nlights of the town and the shapes of the houses, now distant about a\nquarter of a mile. Perhaps I ran twenty yards, perhaps fifty; I do not\nknow. I heard the steps behind me, quick as my own. Then I fell headlong\non the road--tripped up! I understood. They had stretched a rope across\nmy path; as I fell a man bounded up from either side, and I found the\nrope slack under my body. There I lay on my face; a man knelt on me,\nothers held either hand; my face was pressed into the mud of the road,\nand I was like to have been stifled; my hand-bag had whizzed away from\nme. Then a voice said:\n\n\"Turn him over.\"\n\nI knew the voice; it was a confirmation of the fears which I had lately\nbeen at such pains to banish. It justified the forecast of Anton von\nStrofzin, and explained the wager of the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim--for\nit was Rischenheim's voice.\n\nThey caught hold of me and began to turn me on my back. Here I saw a\nchance, and with a great heave of my body I flung them from me. For a\nshort instant I was free; my impetuous attack seemed to have startled\nthe enemy; I gathered myself up on my knees. But my advantage was not to\nlast long. Another man, whom I had not seen, sprang suddenly on me like\na bullet from a catapult. His fierce onset overthrew me; I was stretched\non the ground again, on my back now, and my throat was clutched\nviciously in strong fingers. At the same moment my arms were again\nseized and pinned. The face of the man on my chest bent down towards\nmine, and through the darkness I discerned the features of Rupert of\nHentzau. He was panting with the sudden exertion and the intense force\nwith which he held me, but he was smiling also; and when he saw by\nmy eyes that I knew him, he laughed softly in triumph. Then came\nRischenheim's voice again.\n\n\"Where's the bag he carried? It may be in the bag.\"\n\n\"You fool, he'll have it about him,\" said Rupert, scornfully. \"Hold him\nfast while I search.\"\n\nOn either side my hands were still pinned fast. Rupert's left hand did\nnot leave my throat, but his free right hand began to dart about\nme, feeling, probing, and rummaging. I lay quite helpless and in the\nbitterness of great consternation. Rupert found my revolver, drew it out\nwith a gibe, and handed it to Rischenheim, who was now standing beside\nhim. Then he felt the box, he drew it out, his eyes sparkled. He set\nhis knee hard on my chest, so that I could scarcely breathe; then he\nventured to loose my throat, and tore the box open eagerly.\n\n\"Bring a light here,\" he cried. Another ruffian came with a\ndark-lantern, whose glow he turned on the box. Rupert opened it, and\nwhen he saw what was inside, he laughed again, and stowed it away in his\npocket.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" urged Rischenheim. \"We've got what we wanted, and\nsomebody may come at any moment.\"\n\nA brief hope comforted me. The loss of the box was a calamity, but I\nwould pardon fortune if only the letter escaped capture. Rupert might\nhave suspected that I carried some such token as the box, but he could\nnot know of the letter. Would he listen to Rischenheim? No. The Count of\nHentzau did things thoroughly.\n\n\"We may as well overhaul him a bit more,\" said he, and resumed his\nsearch. My hope vanished, for now he was bound to come upon the letter.\n\nAnother instant brought him to it. He snatched the pocketbook, and,\nmotioning impatiently to the man to hold the lantern nearer, he began to\nexamine the contents. I remember well the look of his face as the fierce\nwhite light threw it up against the darkness in its clear pallor and\nhigh-bred comeliness, with its curling lips and scornful eyes. He had\nthe letter now, and a gleam of joy danced in his eyes as he tore it\nopen. A hasty glance showed him what his prize was; then, coolly and\ndeliberately he settled himself to read, regarding neither Rischenheim's\nnervous hurry nor my desperate, angry glance that glared up at him. He\nread leisurely, as though he had been in an armchair in his own house;\nthe lips smiled and curled as he read the last words that the queen had\nwritten to her lover. He had indeed come on more than he thought.\n\nRischenheim laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Quick, Rupert, quick,\" he urged again, in a voice full of agitation.\n\n\"Let me alone, man. I haven't read anything so amusing for a long\nwhile,\" answered Rupert. Then he burst into a laugh, crying, \"Look,\nlook!\" and pointing to the foot of the last page of the letter. I was\nmad with anger; my fury gave me new strength. In his enjoyment of what\nhe read Rupert had grown careless; his knee pressed more lightly on me,\nand as he showed Rischenheim the passage in the letter that caused him\nso much amusement he turned his head away for an instant. My chance\nhad come. With a sudden movement I displaced him, and with a desperate\nwrench I freed my right hand. Darting it out, I snatched at the letter.\nRupert, alarmed for his treasure, sprang back and off me. I also sprang\nup on my feet, hurling away the fellow who had gripped my other hand.\nFor a moment I stood facing Rupert; then I darted on him. He was too\nquick for me; he dodged behind the man with the lantern and hurled the\nfellow forward against me. The lantern fell on the ground.\n\n\"Give me your stick!\" I heard Rupert say. \"Where is it? That's right!\"\n\nThen came Rischenheim's voice again, imploring and timid:\n\n\"Rupert, you promised not to kill him.\"\n\nThe only answer was a short, fierce laugh. I hurled away the man who had\nbeen thrust into my arms and sprang forward. I saw Rupert of Hentzau;\nhis hand was raised above his head and held a stout club. I do not\nknow what followed; there came--all in a confused blur of instant\nsequence--an oath from Rupert, a rush from me, a scuffle, as though some\none sought to hold him back; then he was on me; I felt a great thud on\nmy forehead, and I felt nothing more. Again I was on my back, with a\nterrible pain in my head, and a dull, dreamy consciousness of a knot of\nmen standing over me, talking eagerly to one another.\n\nI could not hear what they were saying; I had no great desire to hear. I\nfancied, somehow, that they were talking about me; they looked at me and\nmoved their hands towards me now and again. I heard Rupert's laugh, and\nsaw his club poised over me; then Rischenheim caught him by the wrist. I\nknow now that Rischenheim was reminding his cousin that he had promised\nnot to kill me, that Rupert's oath did not weigh a straw in the scales,\nbut that he was held back only by a doubt whether I alive or my dead\nbody would be more inconvenient to dispose of. Yet then I did not\nunderstand, but lay there listless. And presently the talking forms\nseemed to cease their talking; they grew blurred and dim, running into\none another, and all mingling together to form one great shapeless\ncreature that seemed to murmur and gibber over me, some such monster\nas a man sees in his dreams. I hated to see it, and closed my eyes; its\nmurmurings and gibberings haunted my ears for awhile, making me restless\nand unhappy; then they died away. Their going made me happy; I sighed in\ncontentment; and everything became as though it were not.\n\nYet I had one more vision, breaking suddenly across my unconsciousness.\nA bold, rich voice rang out, \"By God, I will!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried another. Then, \"What's that?\" There was a rush of feet,\nthe cries of men who met in anger or excitement, the crack of a shot and\nof another quickly following, oaths, and scuffling. Then came the sound\nof feet flying. I could not make it out; I grew weary with the puzzle of\nit. Would they not be quiet? Quiet was what I wanted. At last they grew\nquiet; I closed my eyes again. The pain was less now; they were quiet; I\ncould sleep.\n\nWhen a man looks back on the past, reviewing in his mind the chances\nFortune has given and the calls she has made, he always torments himself\nby thinking that he could have done other and better than in fact he\ndid. Even now I lie awake at night sometimes, making clever plans by\nwhich I could have thwarted Rupert's schemes. In these musings I am very\nacute; Anton von Strofzin's idle talk furnishes me with many a clue,\nand I draw inferences sure and swift as a detective in the story books.\nBauer is my tool, I am not his. I lay Rischenheim by the heels, send\nRupert howling off with a ball in his arm, and carry my precious burden\nin triumph to Mr. Rassendyll. By the time I have played the whole game I\nam indeed proud of myself. Yet in truth--in daylight truth--I fear that,\nunless Heaven sent me a fresh set of brains, I should be caught in much\nthe same way again. Though not by that fellow Bauer, I swear! Well,\nthere it was. They had made a fool of me. I lay on the road with a\nbloody head, and Rupert of Hentzau had the queen's letter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. AGAIN TO ZENDA\n\nBy Heaven's care, or--since a man may be over-apt to arrogate to himself\ngreat share of such attention--by good luck, I had not to trust for my\nlife to the slender thread of an oath sworn by Rupert of Hentzau. The\nvisions of my dazed brain were transmutations of reality; the scuffle,\nthe rush, the retreat were not all dream.\n\nThere is an honest fellow now living in Wintenberg comfortably and at\nhis ease by reason that his wagon chanced to come lumbering along with\nthree or four stout lads in it at the moment when Rupert was meditating\na second and murderous blow. Seeing the group of us, the good carrier\nand his lads leapt down and rushed on my assailants. One of the thieves,\nthey said, was for fighting it out--I could guess who that was--and\ncalled on the rest to stand; but they, more prudent, laid hands on him,\nand, in spite of his oaths, hustled him off along the road towards\nthe station. Open country lay there and the promise of safety. My new\nfriends set off in pursuit; but a couple of revolver shots, heard by me,\nbut not understood, awoke their caution. Good Samaritans, but not men\nof war, they returned to where I lay senseless on the ground,\ncongratulating themselves and me that an enemy so well armed should\nrun and not stand his ground. They forced a drink of rough wine down my\nthroat, and in a minute or two I opened my eyes. They were for carrying\nme to a hospital; I would have none of it. As soon as things grew clear\nto me again and I knew where I was, I did nothing but repeat in urgent\ntones, \"The Golden Lion, The Golden Lion! Twenty crowns to carry me to\nthe Golden Lion.\"\n\nPerceiving that I knew my own business and where I wished to go, one\npicked up my hand-bag and the rest hoisted me into their wagon and set\nout for the hotel where Rudolf Rassendyll was. The one thought my broken\nhead held was to get to him as soon as might be and tell him how I had\nbeen fool enough to let myself be robbed of the queen's letter.\n\nHe was there. He stood on the threshold of the inn, waiting for me, as\nit seemed, although it was not yet the hour of my appointment. As they\ndrew me up to the door, I saw his tall, straight figure and his red hair\nby the light of the hall lamps. By Heaven, I felt as a lost child must\non sight of his mother! I stretched out my hand to him, over the side of\nthe wagon, murmuring, \"I've lost it.\"\n\nHe started at the words, and sprang forward to me. Then he turned\nquickly to the carrier.\n\n\"This gentleman is my friend,\" he said. \"Give him to me. I'll speak to\nyou later.\" He waited while I was lifted down from the wagon into\nthe arms that he held ready for me, and himself carried me across the\nthreshold. I was quite clear in the head by now and understood all that\npassed. There were one or two people in the hall, but Mr. Rassendyll\ntook no heed of them. He bore me quickly upstairs and into his\nsitting-room. There he set me down in an arm-chair, and stood opposite\nto me. He was smiling, but anxiety was awake in his eyes.\n\n\"I've lost it,\" I said again, looking up at him pitifully enough.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said he, nodding. \"Will you wait, or can you tell\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes, but give me some brandy,\" said I.\n\nRudolf gave me a little brandy mixed in a great deal of water, and then\nI made shift to tell him. Though faint, I was not confused, and I gave\nmy story in brief, hurried, yet sufficient words. He made no sign till I\nmentioned the letter. Then his face changed.\n\n\"A letter, too?\" he exclaimed, in a strange mixture of increased\napprehension and unlooked-for joy.\n\n\"Yes, a letter, too; she wrote a letter, and I carried that as well as\nthe box. I've lost them both, Rudolf. God help me, I've lost them both!\nRupert has the letter too!\" I think I must have been weak and unmanned\nfrom the blow I had received, for my composure broke down here. Rudolf\nstepped up to me and wrung me by the hand. I mastered myself again and\nlooked in his face as he stood in thought, his hand caressing the strong\ncurve of his clean-shaven chin. Now that I was with him again it seemed\nas though I had never lost him; as though we were still together in\nStrelsau or at Tarlenheim, planning how to hoodwink Black Michael,\nsend Rupert of Hentzau to his own place, and bring the king back to his\nthrone. For Mr. Rassendyll, as he stood before me now, was changed in\nnothing since our last meeting, nor indeed since he reigned in Strelsau,\nsave that a few flecks of gray spotted his hair.\n\nMy battered head ached most consumedly. Mr. Rassendyll rang the bell\ntwice, and a short, thickset man of middle age appeared; he wore a suit\nof tweed, and had the air of smartness and respectability which marks\nEnglish servants.\n\n\"James,\" said Rudolf, \"this gentleman has hurt his head. Look after it.\"\n\nJames went out. In a few minutes he was back, with water, basin, towels,\nand bandages. Bending over me, he began to wash and tend my wound very\ndeftly. Rudolf was walking up and down.\n\n\"Done the head, James?\" he asked, after a few moments.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the servant, gathering together his appliances.\n\n\"Telegraph forms, then.\"\n\nJames went out, and was back with the forms in an instant.\n\n\"Be ready when I ring,\" said Rudolf. And he added, turning to me, \"Any\neasier, Fritz?\"\n\n\"I can listen to you now,\" I said.\n\n\"I see their game,\" said he. \"One or other of them, Rupert or this\nRischenheim, will try to get to the king with the letter.\"\n\nI sprang to my feet.\n\n\"They mustn't,\" I cried, and I reeled back into my chair, with a feeling\nas if a red-hot poker were being run through my head.\n\n\"Much you can do to stop 'em, old fellow,\" smiled Rudolf, pausing to\npress my hand as he went by. \"They won't trust the post, you know. One\nwill go. Now which?\" He stood facing me with a thoughtful frown on his\nface.\n\nI did not know, but I thought that Rischenheim would go. It was a great\nrisk for Rupert to trust himself in the kingdom, and he knew that the\nking would not easily be persuaded to receive him, however startling\nmight be the business he professed as his errand. On the other hand,\nnothing was known against Rischenheim, while his rank would secure, and\nindeed entitle, him to an early audience. Therefore I concluded that\nRischenheim would go with the letter, or, if Rupert would not let that\nout of his possession, with the news of the letter.\n\n\"Or a copy,\" suggested Rassendyll. \"Well, Rischenheim or Rupert will be\non his way by to-morrow morning, or is on his way to-night.\"\n\nAgain I tried to rise, for I was on fire to prevent the fatal\nconsequences of my stupidity. Rudolf thrust me back in my chair, saying,\n\"No, no.\" Then he sat down at the table and took up the telegraph forms.\n\n\"You and Sapt arranged a cipher, I suppose?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. You write the message, and I'll put it into the cipher.\"\n\n\"This is what I've written: 'Document lost. Let nobody see him if\npossible. Wire who asks.' I don't like to make it plainer: most ciphers\ncan be read, you know.\"\n\n\"Not ours,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, but will that do?\" asked Rudolf, with an unconvinced smile.\n\n\"Yes, I think he'll understand it.\" And I wrote it again in the cipher;\nit was as much as I could do to hold the pen.\n\nThe bell was rung again, and James appeared in an instant.\n\n\"Send this,\" said Rudolf.\n\n\"The offices will be shut, sir.\"\n\n\"James, James!\"\n\n\"Very good, sir; but it may take an hour to get one open.\"\n\n\"I'll give you half an hour. Have you money?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And now,\" added Rudolf, turning to me, \"you'd better go to bed.\"\n\nI do not recollect what I answered, for my faintness came upon me again,\nand I remember only that Rudolf himself helped me into his own bed. I\nslept, but I do not think he so much as lay down on the sofa; chancing\nto awake once or twice, I heard him pacing about. But towards morning\nI slept heavily, and I did not know what he was doing then. At eight\no'clock James entered and roused me. He said that a doctor was to be at\nthe hotel in half an hour, but that Mr. Rassendyll would like to see me\nfor a few minutes if I felt equal to business. I begged James to summon\nhis master at once. Whether I were equal or unequal, the business had to\nbe done.\n\nRudolf came, calm and serene. Danger and the need for exertion acted on\nhim like a draught of good wine on a seasoned drinker. He was not only\nhimself, but more than himself: his excellences enhanced, the indolence\nthat marred him in quiet hours sloughed off. But to-day there was\nsomething more; I can only describe it as a kind of radiance. I have\nseen it on the faces of young sparks when the lady they love comes\nthrough the ball-room door, and I have seen it glow more softly in\na girl's eyes when some fellow who seemed to me nothing out of the\nordinary asked her for a dance. That strange gleam was on Rudolf's face\nas he stood by my bedside. I dare say it used to be on mine when I went\ncourting.\n\n\"Fritz, old friend,\" said he, \"there's an answer from Sapt. I'll lay the\ntelegraph offices were stirred in Zenda as well as James stirred them\nhere in Wintenberg! And what do you think? Rischenheim asked for an\naudience before he left Strelsau.\"\n\nI raised myself on my elbow in the bed.\n\n\"You understand?\" he went on. \"He left on Monday. To-day's Wednesday.\nThe king has granted him an audience at four on Friday. Well, then--\"\n\n\"They counted on success,\" I cried, \"and Rischenheim takes the letter!\"\n\n\"A copy, if I know Rupert of Hentzau. Yes, it was well laid. I like the\nmen taking all the cabs! How much ahead had they, now.\"\n\nI did not know that, though I had no more doubt than he that Rupert's\nhand was in the business.\n\n\"Well,\" he continued, \"I am going to wire to Sapt to put Rischenheim\noff for twelve hours if he can; failing that, to get the king away from\nZenda.\"\n\n\"But Rischenheim must have his audience sooner or later,\" I objected.\n\n\"Sooner or later--there's the world's difference between them!\" cried\nRudolf Rassendyll. He sat down on the bed by me, and went on in quick,\ndecisive words: \"You can't move for a day or two. Send my message to\nSapt. Tell him to keep you informed of what happens. As soon as you can\ntravel, go to Strelsau, and let Sapt know directly you arrive. We shall\nwant your help.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do?\" I cried, staring at him.\n\nHe looked at me for a moment, and his face was crossed by conflicting\nfeelings. I saw resolve there, obstinacy, and the scorn of danger; fun,\ntoo, and merriment; and, lastly, the same radiance I spoke of. He had\nbeen smoking a cigarette; now he threw the end of it into the grate and\nrose from the bed where he had been sitting.\n\n\"I'm going to Zenda,\" said he.\n\n\"To Zenda!\" I cried, amazed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rudolf. \"I'm going again to Zenda, Fritz, old fellow. By\nheaven, I knew it would come, and now it has come!\"\n\n\"But to do what?\"\n\n\"I shall overtake Rischenheim or be hot on his heels. If he gets there\nfirst, Sapt will keep him waiting till I come; and if I come, he shall\nnever see the king. Yes, if I come in time--\" He broke into a sudden\nlaugh. \"What!\" he cried, \"have I lost my likeness? Can't I still play\nthe king? Yes, if I come in time, Rischenheim shall have his audience\nof the king of Zenda, and the king will be very gracious to him, and the\nking will take his copy of the letter from him! Oh, Rischenheim shall\nhave an audience of King Rudolf in the castle of Zenda, never fear!\"\n\nHe stood, looking to see how I received his plan; but amazed at the\nboldness of it, I could only lie back and gasp.\n\nRudolf's excitement left him as suddenly as it had come; he was again\nthe cool, shrewd, nonchalant Englishman, as, lighting another cigarette,\nhe proceeded:\n\n\"You see, there are two of them, Rupert and Rischenheim. Now you can't\nmove for a day or two, that's certain. But there must be two of us there\nin Ruritania. Rischenheim is to try first; but if he fails, Rupert will\nrisk everything and break through to the king's presence. Give him five\nminutes with the king, and the mischief's done! Very well, then; Sapt\nmust keep Rupert at bay while I tackle Rischenheim. As soon as you can\nmove, go to Strelsau, and let Sapt know where you are.\"\n\n\"But if you're seen, if you're found out?\"\n\n\"Better I than the queen's letter,\" said he. Then he laid his hand on\nmy arm and said, quite quietly, \"If the letter gets to the king, I and I\nonly can do what must be done.\"\n\nI did not know what he meant; perhaps it was that he would carry off the\nqueen sooner than leave her alone after her letter was known; but there\nwas another possible meaning that I, a loyal subject, dared not inquire\ninto. Yet I made no answer, for I was above all and first of all the\nqueen's servant. Still I cannot believe that he meant harm to the king.\n\n\"Come, Fritz,\" he cried, \"don't look so glum. This is not so great an\naffair as the other, and we brought that through safe.\" I suppose I\nstill looked doubtful, for he added, with a sort of impatience, \"Well,\nI'm going, anyhow. Heavens, man, am I to sit here while that letter is\ncarried to the king?\"\n\nI understood his feeling, and knew that he held life a light thing\ncompared with the recovery of Queen Flavia's letter. I ceased to urge\nhim. When I assented to his wishes, every shadow vanished from his\nface, and he began to discuss the details of the plan with business-like\nbrevity.\n\n\"I shall leave James with you,\" said Rudolf. \"He'll be very useful, and\nyou can rely on him absolutely. Any message that you dare trust to no\nother conveyance, give to him; he'll carry it. He can shoot, too.\" He\nrose as he spoke. \"I'll look in before I start,\" he added, \"and hear\nwhat the doctor says about you.\"\n\nI lay there, thinking, as men sick and weary in body will, of the\ndangers and the desperate nature of the risk, rather than of the hope\nwhich its boldness would have inspired in a healthy, active brain.\nI distrusted the rapid inference that Rudolf had drawn from Sapt's\ntelegram, telling myself that it was based on too slender a foundation.\nWell, there I was wrong, and I am glad now to pay that tribute to his\ndiscernment. The first steps of Rupert's scheme were laid as Rudolf had\nconjectured: Rischenheim had started, even while I lay there, for Zenda,\ncarrying on his person a copy of the queen's farewell letter and armed\nfor his enterprise by his right of audience with the king. So far we\nwere right, then; for the rest we were in darkness, not knowing or being\nable even to guess where Rupert would choose to await the result of the\nfirst cast, or what precautions he had taken against the failure of his\nenvoy. But although in total obscurity as to his future plans, I traced\nhis past actions, and subsequent knowledge has shown that I was right.\nBauer was the tool; a couple of florins apiece had hired the fellows\nwho, conceiving that they were playing a part in some practical joke,\nhad taken all the cabs at the station. Rupert had reckoned that I should\nlinger looking for my servant and luggage, and thus miss my last chance\nof a vehicle. If, however, I had obtained one, the attack would still\nhave been made, although, of course, under much greater difficulties.\nFinally--and of this at the time I knew nothing--had I evaded them\nand got safe to port with my cargo, the plot would have been changed.\nRupert's attention would then have been diverted from me to Rudolf;\ncounting on love overcoming prudence, he reckoned that Mr. Rassendyll\nwould not at once destroy what the queen sent, and had arranged to track\nhis steps from Wintenberg till an opportunity offered of robbing him of\nhis treasure. The scheme, as I know it, was full of audacious cunning,\nand required large resources--the former Rupert himself supplied;\nfor the second he was indebted to his cousin and slave, the Count of\nLuzau-Rischenheim.\n\nMy meditations were interrupted by the arrival of the doctor. He hummed\nand ha'd over me, but to my surprise asked me no questions as to the\ncause of my misfortune, and did not, as I had feared, suggest that his\nefforts should be seconded by those of the police. On the contrary, he\nappeared, from an unobtrusive hint or two, to be anxious that I should\nknow that his discretion could be trusted.\n\n\"You must not think of moving for a couple of days,\" he said; \"but then,\nI think we can get you away without danger and quite quietly.\"\n\nI thanked him; he promised to look in again; I murmured something about\nhis fee.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, that is all settled,\" he said. \"Your friend Herr Schmidt\nhas seen to it, and, my dear sir, most liberally.\"\n\nHe was hardly gone when 'my friend Herr Schmidt'--alias Rudolf\nRassendyll--was back. He laughed a little when I told him how discreet\nthe doctor had been.\n\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"he thinks you've been very indiscreet. I was\nobliged, my dear Fritz, to take some liberties with your character.\nHowever, it's odds against the matter coming to your wife's ears.\"\n\n\"But couldn't we have laid the others by the heels?\"\n\n\"With the letter on Rupert? My dear fellow, you're very ill.\"\n\nI laughed at myself, and forgave Rudolf his trick, though I think that\nhe might have made my fictitious inamorata something more than a baker's\nwife. It would have cost no more to make her a countess, and the doctor\nwould have looked with more respect on me. However, Rudolf had said that\nthe baker broke my head with his rolling-pin, and thus the story rests\nin the doctor's mind to this day.\n\n\"Well, I'm off,\" said Rudolf.\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"Why, to that same little station where two good friends parted from me\nonce before. Fritz, where's Rupert gone?\"\n\n\"I wish we knew.\"\n\n\"I lay he won't be far off.\"\n\n\"Are you armed?\"\n\n\"The six-shooter. Well, yes, since you press me, a knife, too; but only\nif he uses one. You'll let Sapt know when you come?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I come the moment I can stand?\"\n\n\"As if you need tell me that, old fellow!\"\n\n\"Where do you go from the station?\"\n\n\"To Zenda, through the forest,\" he answered. \"I shall reach the station\nabout nine to-morrow night, Thursday. Unless Rischenheim has got the\naudience sooner than was arranged, I shall be in time.\"\n\n\"How will you get hold of Sapt?\"\n\n\"We must leave something to the minute.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Rudolf.\"\n\n\"The king sha'n't have the letter, Fritz.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence as we shook hands. Then that soft yet\nbright look came in his eyes again. He looked down at me, and caught me\nregarding him with a smile that I know was not unkind.\n\n\"I never thought I should see her again,\" he said. \"I think I shall now,\nFritz. To have a turn with that boy and to see her again--it's worth\nsomething.\"\n\n\"How will you see her?\"\n\nRudolf laughed, and I laughed too. He caught my hand again. I think that\nhe was anxious to infect me with his gayety and confidence. But I could\nnot answer to the appeal of his eyes. There was a motive in him that\nfound no place in me--a great longing, the prospect or hope of whose\nsudden fulfilment dwarfed danger and banished despair. He saw that I\ndetected its presence in him and perceived how it filled his mind.\n\n\"But the letter comes before all,\" said he. \"I expected to die without\nseeing her; I will die without seeing her, if I must, to save the\nletter.\"\n\n\"I know you will,\" said I.\n\nHe pressed my hand again. As he turned away, James came with his\nnoiseless, quick step into the room.\n\n\"The carriage is at the door, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"Look after the count, James,\" said Rudolf. \"Don't leave him till he\nsends you away.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\nI raised myself in bed.\n\n\"Here's luck,\" I cried, catching up the lemonade James had brought me,\nand taking a gulp of it.\n\n\"Please God,\" said Rudolf, with a shrug.\n\nAnd he was gone to his work and his reward--to save the queen's letter\nand to see the queen's face. Thus he went a second time to Zenda.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. AN EDDY ON THE MOAT\n\nOn the evening of Thursday, the sixteenth of October, the Constable of\nZenda was very much out of humor; he has since confessed as much. To\nrisk the peace of a palace for the sake of a lover's greeting had never\nbeen wisdom to his mind, and he had been sorely impatient with \"that\nfool Fritz's\" yearly pilgrimage. The letter of farewell had been an\nadded folly, pregnant with chances of disaster. Now disaster, or the\ndanger of it, had come. The curt, mysterious telegram from Wintenberg,\nwhich told him so little, at least told him that. It ordered him--and he\ndid not know even whose the order was--to delay Rischenheim's audience,\nor, if he could not, to get the king away from Zenda: why he was to act\nthus was not disclosed to him. But he knew as well as I that Rischenheim\nwas completely in Rupert's hands, and he could not fail to guess that\nsomething had gone wrong at Wintenberg, and that Rischenheim came to\ntell the king some news that the king must not hear. His task sounded\nsimple, but it was not easy; for he did not know where Rischenheim was,\nand so could not prevent his coming; besides, the king had been very\npleased to learn of the count's approaching visit, since he desired to\ntalk with him on the subject of a certain breed of dogs, which the count\nbred with great, his Majesty with only indifferent success; therefore\nhe had declared that nothing should interfere with his reception of\nRischenheim. In vain Sapt told him that a large boar had been seen in\nthe forest, and that a fine day's sport might be expected if he would\nhunt next day. \"I shouldn't be back in time to see Rischenheim,\" said\nthe king.\n\n\"Your Majesty would be back by nightfall,\" suggested Sapt.\n\n\"I should be too tired to talk to him, and I've a great deal to\ndiscuss.\"\n\n\"You could sleep at the hunting-lodge, sire, and ride back to receive\nthe count next morning.\"\n\n\"I'm anxious to see him as soon as may be.\" Then he looked up at Sapt\nwith a sick man's quick suspicion. \"Why shouldn't I see him?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's a pity to miss the boar, sire,\" was all Sapt's plea. The king made\nlight of it.\n\n\"Curse the boar!\" said he. \"I want to know how he gets the dogs' coats\nso fine.\"\n\nAs the king spoke a servant entered, carrying a telegram for Sapt. The\ncolonel took it and put it in his pocket.\n\n\"Read it,\" said the king. He had dined and was about to go to bed, it\nbeing nearly ten o'clock.\n\n\"It will keep, sire,\" answered Sapt, who did not know but that it might\nbe from Wintenberg.\n\n\"Read it,\" insisted the king testily. \"It may be from Rischenheim.\nPerhaps he can get here sooner. I should like to know about those dogs.\nRead it, I beg.\"\n\nSapt could do nothing but read it. He had taken to spectacles lately,\nand he spent a long while adjusting them and thinking what he should\ndo if the message were not fit for the king's ear. \"Be quick, man, be\nquick!\" urged the irritable king.\n\nSapt had got the envelope open at last, and relief, mingled with\nperplexity, showed in his face.\n\n\"Your Majesty guessed wonderfully well. Rischenheim can be here at eight\nto-morrow morning,\" he said, looking up.\n\n\"Capital!\" cried the king. \"He shall breakfast with me at nine, and I'll\nhave a ride after the boar when we've done our business. Now are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sire,\" said Sapt, biting his moustache.\n\nThe king rose with a yawn, and bade the colonel good-night. \"He must\nhave some trick I don't know with those dogs,\" he remarked, as he went\nout. And \"Damn the dogs!\" cried Colonel Sapt the moment that the door\nwas shut behind his Majesty.\n\nBut the colonel was not a man to accept defeat easily. The audience that\nhe had been instructed to postpone was advanced; the king, whom he\nhad been told to get away from Zenda, would not go till he had seen\nRischenheim. Still there are many ways of preventing a meeting. Some\nare by fraud; these it is no injustice to Sapt to say that he had tried;\nsome are by force, and the colonel was being driven to the conclusion\nthat one of these must be his resort.\n\n\"Though the king,\" he mused, with a grin, \"will be furious if anything\nhappens to Rischenheim before he's told him about the dogs.\"\n\nYet he fell to racking his brains to find a means by which the count\nmight be rendered incapable of performing the service so desired by the\nking and of carrying out his own purpose in seeking an audience. Nothing\nsave assassination suggested itself to the constable; a quarrel and a\nduel offered no security; and Sapt was not Black Michael, and had no\nband of ruffians to join him in an apparently unprovoked kidnapping of a\ndistinguished nobleman.\n\n\"I can think of nothing,\" muttered Sapt, rising from his chair and\nmoving across towards the window in search of the fresh air that a man\nso often thinks will give him a fresh idea. He was in his own quarters,\nthat room of the new chateau which opens on to the moat immediately to\nthe right of the drawbridge as you face the old castle; it was the room\nwhich Duke Michael had occupied, and almost opposite to the spot where\nthe great pipe had connected the window of the king's dungeon with the\nwaters of the moat. The bridge was down now, for peaceful days had come\nto Zenda; the pipe was gone, and the dungeon's window, though still\nbarred, was uncovered. The night was clear and fine, and the still water\ngleamed fitfully as the moon, half-full, escaped from or was hidden by\npassing clouds. Sapt stood staring out gloomily, beating his knuckles on\nthe stone sill. The fresh air was there, but the fresh idea tarried.\n\nSuddenly the constable bent forward, craning his head out and down, far\nas he could stretch it, towards the water. What he had seen, or seemed\ndimly to see, is a sight common enough on the surface of water--large\ncircular eddies, widening from a centre; a stone thrown in makes them,\nor a fish on the rise. But Sapt had thrown no stone, and the fish in the\nmoat were few and not rising then. The light was behind Sapt, and threw\nhis figure into bold relief. The royal apartments looked out the other\nway; there were no lights in the windows this side the bridge, although\nbeyond it the guards' lodgings and the servants' offices still showed a\nlight here and there. Sapt waited till the eddies ceased. Then he heard\nthe faintest sound, as of a large body let very gently into the water; a\nmoment later, from the moat right below him, a man's head emerged.\n\n\"Sapt!\" said a voice, low but distinct.\n\nThe old colonel started, and, resting both hands on the sill, bent\nfurther out, till he seemed in danger of overbalancing.\n\n\"Quick--to the ledge on the other side. You know,\" said the voice, and\nthe head turned; with quick, quiet strokes the man crossed the moat till\nhe was hidden in the triangle of deep shade formed by the meeting of\nthe drawbridge and the old castle wall. Sapt watched him go, almost\nstupefied by the sudden wonder of hearing that voice come to him out of\nthe stillness of the night. For the king was abed; and who spoke in that\nvoice save the king and one other?\n\nThen, with a curse at himself for his delay, he turned and walked\nquickly across the room. Opening the door, he found himself in the\npassage. But here he ran right into the arms of young Bernenstein, the\nofficer of the guard, who was going his rounds. Sapt knew and trusted\nhim, for he had been with us all through the siege of Zenda, when\nMichael kept the king a prisoner, and he bore marks given him by Rupert\nof Hentzau's ruffians. He now held a commission as lieutenant in the\ncuirassiers of the King's Guard.\n\nHe noticed Sapt's bearing, for he cried out in a low voice, \"Anything\nwrong, sir?\"\n\n\"Bernenstein, my boy, the castle's all right about here. Go round to the\nfront, and, hang you, stay there,\" said Sapt.\n\nThe officer stared, as well he might. Sapt caught him by the arm.\n\n\"No, stay here. See, stand by the door there that leads to the royal\napartments. Stand there, and let nobody pass. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And whatever you hear, don't look round.\"\n\nBernenstein's bewilderment grew greater; but Sapt was constable, and on\nSapt's shoulders lay the responsibility for the safety of Zenda and all\nin it.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said, with a submissive shrug, and he drew his\nsword and stood by the door; he could obey, although he could not\nunderstand.\n\nSapt ran on. Opening the gate that led to the bridge, he sped across.\nThen, stepping on one side and turning his face to the wall, he\ndescended the steps that gave foothold down to the ledge running six or\neight inches above the water. He also was now in the triangle of deep\ndarkness, yet he knew that a man was there, who stood straight and tall,\nrising above his own height. And he felt his hand caught in a sudden\ngrip. Rudolf Rassendyll was there, in his wet drawers and socks.\n\n\"Is it you?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Rudolf; \"I swam round from the other side and got here.\nThen I threw in a bit of mortar, but I wasn't sure I'd roused you, and\nI didn't dare shout, so I followed it myself. Lay hold of me a minute\nwhile I get on my breeches: I didn't want to get wet, so I carried my\nclothes in a bundle. Hold me tight, it's slippery.\"\n\n\"In God's name what brings you here?\" whispered Sapt, catching Rudolf by\nthe arm as he was directed.\n\n\"The queen's service. When does Rischenheim come?\"\n\n\"To-morrow at eight.\"\n\n\"The deuce! That's earlier than I thought. And the king?\"\n\n\"Is here and determined to see him. It's impossible to move him from\nit.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence; Rudolf drew his shirt over his head and\ntucked it into his trousers. \"Give me the jacket and waistcoat,\" he\nsaid. \"I feel deuced damp underneath, though.\"\n\n\"You'll soon get dry,\" grinned Sapt. \"You'll be kept moving, you see.\"\n\n\"I've lost my hat.\"\n\n\"Seems to me you've lost your head too.\"\n\n\"You'll find me both, eh, Sapt?\"\n\n\"As good as your own, anyhow,\" growled the constable.\n\n\"Now the boots, and I'm ready.\" Then he asked quickly, \"Has the king\nseen or heard from Rischenheim?\"\n\n\"Neither, except through me.\"\n\n\"Then why is he so set on seeing him?\"\n\n\"To find out what gives dogs smooth coats.\"\n\n\"You're serious? Hang you, I can't see your face.\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"All's well, then. Has he got a beard now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Confound him! Can't you take me anywhere to talk?\"\n\n\"What the deuce are you here at all for?\"\n\n\"To meet Rischenheim.\"\n\n\"To meet--?\"\n\n\"Yes. Sapt, he's got a copy of the queen's letter.\"\n\nSapt twirled his moustache.\n\n\"I've always said as much,\" he remarked in tones of satisfaction. He\nneed not have said it; he would have been more than human not to think\nit.\n\n\"Where can you take me to?\" asked Rudolf impatiently.\n\n\"Any room with a door and a lock to it,\" answered old Sapt. \"I command\nhere, and when I say 'Stay out'--well, they don't come in.\"\n\n\"Not the king?\"\n\n\"The king is in bed. Come along,\" and the constable set his toe on the\nlowest step.\n\n\"Is there nobody about?\" asked Rudolf, catching his arm.\n\n\"Bernenstein; but he will keep his back toward us.\"\n\n\"Your discipline is still good, then, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Pretty well for these days, your Majesty,\" grunted Sapt, as he reached\nthe level of the bridge.\n\nHaving crossed, they entered the chateau. The passage was empty,\nsave for Bernenstein, whose broad back barred the way from the royal\napartments.\n\n\"In here,\" whispered Sapt, laying his hand on the door of the room\nwhence he had come.\n\n\"All right,\" answered Rudolf. Bernenstein's hand twitched, but he did\nnot look round. There was discipline in the castle of Zenda.\n\nBut as Sapt was half-way through the door and Rudolf about to follow\nhim, the other door, that which Bernenstein guarded, was softly yet\nswiftly opened. Bernenstein's sword was in rest in an instant. A\nmuttered oath from Sapt and Rudolf's quick snatch at his breath greeted\nthe interruption. Bernenstein did not look round, but his sword fell to\nhis side. In the doorway stood Queen Flavia, all in white; and now\nher face turned white as her dress. For her eyes had fallen on Rudolf\nRassendyll. For a moment the four stood thus; then Rudolf passed Sapt,\nthrust Bernenstein's brawny shoulders (the young man had not looked\nround) out of the way, and, falling on his knee before the queen, seized\nher hand and kissed it. Bernenstein could see now without looking round,\nand if astonishment could kill, he would have been a dead man that\ninstant. He fairly reeled and leant against the wall, his mouth hanging\nopen. For the king was in bed, and had a beard; yet there was the king,\nfully dressed and clean shaven, and he was kissing the queen's hand,\nwhile she gazed down on him in a struggle between amazement, fright, and\njoy. A soldier should be prepared for anything, but I cannot be hard on\nyoung Bernenstein's bewilderment.\n\nYet there was in truth nothing strange in the queen seeking to see old\nSapt that night, nor in her guessing where he would most probably be\nfound. For she had asked him three times whether news had come from\nWintenberg and each time he had put her off with excuses. Quick to\nforbode evil, and conscious of the pledge to fortune that she had given\nin her letter, she had determined to know from him whether there were\nreally cause for alarm, and had stolen, undetected, from her apartments\nto seek him. What filled her at once with unbearable apprehension and\nincredulous joy was to find Rudolf present in actual flesh and blood,\nno longer in sad longing dreams or visions, and to feel his live lips on\nher hand.\n\nLovers count neither time nor danger; but Sapt counted both, and no\nmore than a moment had passed before, with eager imperative gestures, he\nbeckoned them to enter the room. The queen obeyed, and Rudolf followed\nher.\n\n\"Let nobody in, and don't say a word to anybody,\" whispered Sapt, as\nhe entered, leaving Bernenstein outside. The young man was half-dazed\nstill, but he had sense to read the expression in the constable's eyes\nand to learn from it that he must give his life sooner than let the door\nbe opened. So with drawn sword he stood on guard.\n\nIt was eleven o'clock when the queen came, and midnight had struck from\nthe great clock of the castle before the door opened again and Sapt came\nout. His sword was not drawn, but he had his revolver in his hand.\nHe shut the door silently after him and began at once to talk in low,\nearnest, quick tones to Bernenstein. Bernenstein listened intently and\nwithout interrupting. Sapt's story ran on for eight or nine minutes.\nThen he paused, before asking:\n\n\"You understand now?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is wonderful,\" said the young man, drawing in his breath.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Sapt. \"Nothing is wonderful: some things are unusual.\"\n\nBernenstein was not convinced, and shrugged his shoulders in protest.\n\n\"Well?\" said the constable, with a quick glance at him.\n\n\"I would die for the queen, sir,\" he answered, clicking his heels\ntogether as though on parade.\n\n\"Good,\" said Sapt. \"Then listen,\" and he began again to talk.\nBernenstein nodded from time to time. \"You'll meet him at the gate,\"\nsaid the constable, \"and bring him straight here. He's not to go\nanywhere else, you understand me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Colonel,\" smiled young Bernenstein.\n\n\"The king will be in this room--the king. You know who is the king?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Colonel.\"\n\n\"And when the interview is ended, and we go to breakfast--\"\n\n\"I know who will be the king then. Yes, Colonel.\"\n\n\"Good. But we do him no harm unless--\"\n\n\"It is necessary.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nSapt turned away with a little sigh. Bernenstein was an apt pupil, but\nthe colonel was exhausted by so much explanation. He knocked softly at\nthe door of the room. The queen's voice bade him enter, and he passed\nin. Bernenstein was left alone again in the passage, pondering over what\nhe had heard and rehearsing the part that it now fell to him to play. As\nhe thought he may well have raised his head proudly. The service seemed\nso great and the honor so high, that he almost wished he could die in\nthe performing of his role. It would be a finer death than his soldier's\ndreams had dared to picture.\n\nAt one o'clock Colonel Sapt came out. \"Go to bed till six,\" said he to\nBernenstein.\n\n\"I'm not sleepy.\"\n\n\"No, but you will be at eight if you don't sleep now.\"\n\n\"Is the queen coming out, Colonel?\"\n\n\"In a minute, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"I should like to kiss her hand.\"\n\n\"Well, if you think it worth waiting a quarter of an hour for!\" said\nSapt, with a slight smile.\n\n\"You said a minute, sir.\"\n\n\"So did she,\" answered the constable.\n\nNevertheless it was a quarter of an hour before Rudolf Rassendyll opened\nthe door and the queen appeared on the threshold. She was very pale,\nand she had been crying, but her eyes were happy and her air firm. The\nmoment he saw her, young Bernenstein fell on his knee and raised her\nhand to his lips.\n\n\"To the death, madame,\" said he, in a trembling voice.\n\n\"I knew it, sir,\" she answered graciously. Then she looked round on the\nthree of them. \"Gentlemen,\" said she, \"my servants and dear friends,\nwith you, and with Fritz who lies wounded in Wintenberg, rest my honor\nand my life; for I will not live if the letter reaches the king.\"\n\n\"The king shall not have it, madame,\" said Colonel Sapt. He took\nher hand in his and patted it with a clumsy gentleness; smiling, she\nextended it again to young Bernenstein, in mark of her favor. They two\nthen stood at the salute, while Rudolf walked with her to the end of the\npassage. There for a moment she and he stood together; the others turned\ntheir eyes away and thus did not see her suddenly stoop and cover his\nhand with her kisses. He tried to draw it away, not thinking it fit that\nshe should kiss his hand, but she seemed as though she could not let\nit go. Yet at last, still with her eyes on his, she passed backwards\nthrough the door, and he shut it after her.\n\n\"Now to business,\" said Colonel Sapt dryly; and Rudolf laughed a little.\n\nRudolf passed into the room. Sapt went to the king's apartments, and\nasked the physician whether his Majesty were sleeping well. Receiving\nreassuring news of the royal slumbers, he proceeded to the quarters\nof the king's body-servant, knocked up the sleepy wretch, and ordered\nbreakfast for the king and the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim at nine\no'clock precisely, in the morning-room that looked out over the avenue\nleading to the entrance to the new chateau. This done, he returned to\nthe room where Rudolf was, carried a chair into the passage, bade Rudolf\nlock the door, sat down, revolver in hand, and himself went to sleep.\nYoung Bernenstein was in bed just now, taken faint, and the constable\nhimself was acting as his substitute; that was to be the story, if a\nstory were needed. Thus the hours from two to six passed that morning in\nthe castle of Zenda.\n\nAt six the constable awoke and knocked at the door; Rudolf Rassendyll\nopened it.\n\n\"Slept well?\" asked Sapt.\n\n\"Not a wink,\" answered Rudolf cheerfully.\n\n\"I thought you had more nerve.\"\n\n\"It wasn't want of nerve that kept me awake,\" said Mr. Rassendyll.\n\nSapt, with a pitying shrug, looked round. The curtains of the window\nwere half-drawn. The table was moved near to the wall, and the arm-chair\nby it was well in shadow, being quite close to the curtains.\n\n\"There's plenty of room for you behind,\" said Rudolf; \"And when\nRischenheim is seated in his chair opposite to mine, you can put your\nbarrel against his head by just stretching out your hand. And of course\nI can do the same.\"\n\n\"Yes, it looks well enough,\" said Sapt, with an approving nod. \"What\nabout the beard?\"\n\n\"Bernenstein is to tell him you've shaved this morning.\"\n\n\"Will he believe that?\"\n\n\"Why not? For his own sake he'd better believe everything.\"\n\n\"And if we have to kill him?\"\n\n\"We must run for it. The king would be furious.\"\n\n\"He's fond of him?\"\n\n\"You forget. He wants to know about the dogs.\"\n\n\"True. You'll be in your place in time?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nRudolf Rassendyll took a turn up and down the room. It was easy to see\nthat the events of the night had disturbed him. Sapt's thoughts were\nrunning in a different channel.\n\n\"When we've done with this fellow, we must find Rupert,\" said he.\n\nRudolf started.\n\n\"Rupert? Rupert? True; I forgot. Of course we must,\" said he confusedly.\n\nSapt looked scornful; he knew that his companion's mind had been\noccupied with the queen. But his remarks--if he had meditated any--were\ninterrupted by the clock striking seven.\n\n\"He'll be here in an hour,\" said he.\n\n\"We're ready for him,\" answered Rudolf Rassendyll. With the thought of\naction his eyes grew bright and his brow smooth again. He and old Sapt\nlooked at one another, and they both smiled.\n\n\"Like old times, isn't it, Sapt?\"\n\n\"Aye, sire, like the reign of good King Rudolf.\"\n\nThus they made ready for the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, while my cursed\nwound held me a prisoner at Wintenberg. It is still a sorrow to me that\nI know what passed that morning only by report, and had not the honor\nof bearing a part in it. Still, her Majesty did not forget me, but\nremembered that I would have taken my share, had fortune allowed. Indeed\nI would most eagerly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. AN AUDIENCE OF THE KING\n\nHaving come thus far in the story that I set out to tell, I have half a\nmind to lay down my pen, and leave untold how from the moment that Mr.\nRassendyll came again to Zenda a fury of chance seemed to catch us all\nin a whirlwind, carrying us whither we would not, and ever driving us\nonwards to fresh enterprises, breathing into us a recklessness that\nstood at no obstacle, and a devotion to the queen and to the man she\nloved that swept away all other feeling. The ancients held there to be a\nfate which would have its fill, though women wept and men died, and\nnone could tell whose was the guilt nor who fell innocent. Thus did they\nblindly wrong God's providence. Yet, save that we are taught to believe\nthat all is ruled, we are as blind as they, and are still left wondering\nwhy all that is true and generous and love's own fruit must turn so\noften to woe and shame, exacting tears and blood. For myself I would\nleave the thing untold, lest a word of it should seem to stain her whom\nI serve; it is by her own command I write, that all may one day, in\ntime's fullness, be truly known, and those condemn who are without sin,\nwhile they pity whose own hearts have fought the equal fight. So much\nfor her and him; for us less needs be said. It was not ours to weigh her\nactions; we served her; him we had served. She was our queen; we bore\nHeaven a grudge that he was not our king. The worst of what befell was\nnot of our own planning, no, nor of our hoping. It came a thunderbolt\nfrom the hand of Rupert, flung carelessly between a curse and a\nlaugh; its coming entangled us more tightly in the net of circumstances.\nThen there arose in us that strange and overpowering desire of which I\nmust tell later, filling us with a zeal to accomplish our purpose, and\nto force Mr. Rassendyll himself into the way we chose. Led by this star,\nwe pressed on through the darkness, until at length the deeper darkness\nfell that stayed our steps. We also stand for judgment, even as she and\nhe. So I will write; but I will write plainly and briefly, setting down\nwhat I must, and no more, yet seeking to give truly the picture of that\ntime, and to preserve as long as may be the portrait of the man whose\nlike I have not known. Yet the fear is always upon me that, failing to\nshow him as he was, I may fail also in gaining an understanding of how\nhe wrought on us, one and all, till his cause became in all things\nthe right, and to seat him where he should be our highest duty and our\nnearest wish. For he said little, and that straight to the purpose;\nno high-flown words of his live in my memory. And he asked nothing for\nhimself. Yet his speech and his eyes went straight to men's hearts and\nwomen's, so that they held their lives in an eager attendance on his\nbidding. Do I rave? Then Sapt was a raver too, for Sapt was foremost in\nthe business.\n\nAt ten minutes to eight o'clock, young Bernenstein, very admirably\nand smartly accoutred, took his stand outside the main entrance of\nthe castle. He wore a confident air that became almost a swagger as he\nstrolled to and fro past the motionless sentries. He had not long to\nwait. On the stroke of eight a gentleman, well-horsed but entirely\nunattended, rode up the carriage drive. Bernenstein, crying \"Ah, it is\nthe count!\" ran to meet him. Rischenheim dismounted, holding out his\nhand to the young officer.\n\n\"My dear Bernenstein!\" said he, for they were acquainted with one\nanother.\n\n\"You're punctual, my dear Rischenheim, and it's lucky, for the king\nawaits you most impatiently.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect to find him up so soon,\" remarked Rischenheim.\n\n\"Up! He's been up these two hours. Indeed we've had the devil of a\ntime of it. Treat him carefully, my dear Count; he's in one of his\ntroublesome humors. For example--but I mustn't keep you waiting. Pray\nfollow me.\"\n\n\"No, but pray tell me. Otherwise I might say something unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Well, he woke at six; and when the barber came to trim his beard there\nwere--imagine it, Count!--no less than seven gray hairs.\" The king fell\ninto a passion. \"Take it off!\" he said. \"Take it off. I won't have\na gray beard! Take it off!' Well what would you? A man is free to be\nshaved if he chooses, so much more a king. So it's taken off.\"\n\n\"His beard!\"\n\n\"His beard, my dear Count.\" Then, after thanking Heaven it was gone,\nand declaring he looked ten years younger, he cried, \"The Count\nof Luzau-Rischenheim breakfasts with me to-day: what is there for\nbreakfast?\" And he had the chef out his of bed and--\"But, by heavens,\nI shall get into trouble if I stop here chattering. He's waiting most\neagerly for you. Come along.\" And Bernenstein, passing his arm through\nthe count's, walked him rapidly into the castle.\n\nThe Count of Luzau-Rischenheim was a young man; he was no more versed\nin affairs of this kind than Bernenstein, and it cannot be said that he\nshowed so much aptitude for them. He was decidedly pale this morning;\nhis manner was uneasy, and his hands trembled. He did not lack courage,\nbut that rarer virtue, coolness; and the importance--or perhaps the\nshame--of his mission upset the balance of his nerves. Hardly noting\nwhere he went, he allowed Bernenstein to lead him quickly and directly\ntowards the room where Rudolf Rassendyll was, not doubting that he was\nbeing conducted to the king's presence.\n\n\"Breakfast is ordered for nine,\" said Bernenstein, \"but he wants to see\nyou before. He has something important to say; and you perhaps have the\nsame?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, no. A small matter; but--er--of a private nature.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so. Oh, I don't ask any questions, my dear Count.\"\n\n\"Shall I find the king alone?\" asked Rischenheim nervously.\n\n\"I don't think you'll find anybody with him; no, nobody, I think,\"\nanswered Bernenstein, with a grave and reassuring air.\n\nThey arrived now at the door. Here Bernenstein paused.\n\n\"I am ordered to wait outside till his Majesty summons me,\" he said in\na low voice, as though he feared that the irritable king would hear him.\n\"I'll open the door and announce you. Pray keep him in a good temper,\nfor all our sakes.\" And he flung the door open, saying, \"Sire, the Count\nof Luzau-Rischenheim has the honor to wait on your Majesty.\" With this\nhe shut the door promptly, and stood against it. Nor did he move, save\nonce, and then only to take out his revolver and carefully inspect it.\n\nThe count advanced, bowing low, and striving to conceal a visible\nagitation. He saw the king in his arm-chair; the king wore a suit of\nbrown tweeds (none the better for being crushed into a bundle the night\nbefore); his face was in deep shadow, but Rischenheim perceived that the\nbeard was indeed gone. The king held out his hand to Rischenheim, and\nmotioned him to sit in a chair just opposite to him and within a foot of\nthe window-curtains.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see you, my lord,\" said the king.\n\nRischenheim looked up. Rudolf's voice had once been so like the king's\nthat no man could tell the difference, but in the last year or two the\nking's had grown weaker, and Rischenheim seemed to be struck by the\nvigor of the tones in which he was addressed. As he looked up, there was\na slight movement in the curtains by him; it died away when the count\ngave no further signs of suspicion, but Rudolf had noticed his surprise:\nthe voice, when it next spoke, was subdued.\n\n\"Most delighted,\" pursued Mr. Rassendyll. \"For I am pestered beyond\nendurance about those dogs. I can't get the coats right, I've tried\neverything, but they won't come as I wish. Now, yours are magnificent.\"\n\n\"You are very good, sire. But I ventured to ask an audience in order\nto--\"\n\n\"Positively you must tell me about the dogs. And before Sapt comes, for\nI want nobody to hear but myself.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty expects Colonel Sapt?\"\n\n\"In about twenty minutes,\" said the king, with a glance at the clock on\nthe mantelpiece.\n\nAt this Rischenheim became all on fire to get his errand done before\nSapt appeared.\n\n\"The coats of your dogs,\" pursued the king, \"grow so beautifully--\"\n\n\"A thousand pardons, sire, but--\"\n\n\"Long and silky, that I despair of--\"\n\n\"I have a most urgent and important matter,\" persisted Rischenheim in\nagony.\n\nRudolf threw himself back in his chair with a peevish air. \"Well, if you\nmust, you must. What is this great affair, Count? Let us have it over,\nand then you can tell me about the dogs.\"\n\nRischenheim looked round the room. There was nobody; the curtains were\nstill; the king's left hand caressed his beardless chin; the right was\nhidden from his visitor by the small table that stood between them.\n\n\"Sire, my cousin, the Count of Hentzau, has entrusted me with a\nmessage.\"\n\nRudolf suddenly assumed a stern air.\n\n\"I can hold no communication, directly or indirectly, with the Count of\nHentzau,\" said he.\n\n\"Pardon me, sire, pardon me. A document has come into the count's hands\nwhich is of vital importance to your Majesty.\"\n\n\"The Count of Hentzau, my lord, has incurred my heaviest displeasure.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is in the hopes of atoning for his offences that he has sent\nme here to-day. There is a conspiracy against your Majesty's honor.\"\n\n\"By whom, my lord?\" asked Rudolf, in cold and doubting tones.\n\n\"By those who are very near your Majesty's person and very high in your\nMajesty's love.\"\n\n\"Name them.\"\n\n\"Sire, I dare not. You would not believe me. But your Majesty will\nbelieve written evidence.\"\n\n\"Show it me, and quickly. We may be interrupted.\"\n\n\"Sire, I have a copy--\"\n\n\"Oh, a copy, my lord?\" sneered Rudolf.\n\n\"My cousin has the original, and will forward it at your Majesty's\ncommand. A copy of a letter of her Majesty's--\"\n\n\"Of the queen's?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. It is addressed to--\" Rischenheim paused.\n\n\"Well, my lord, to whom?\"\n\n\"To a Mr. Rudolf Rassendyll.\"\n\nNow Rudolf played his part well. He did not feign indifference, but\nallowed his voice to tremble with emotion as he stretched out his hand\nand said in a hoarse whisper, \"Give it me, give it me.\"\n\nRischenheim's eyes sparkled. His shot had told: the king's attention was\nhis; the coats of the dogs were forgotten. Plainly he had stirred the\nsuspicions and jealousy of the king.\n\n\"My cousin,\" he continued, \"conceives it his duty to lay the letter\nbefore your Majesty. He obtained it--\"\n\n\"A curse on how he got it! Give it me!\"\n\nRischenheim unbuttoned his coat, then his waistcoat. The head of a\nrevolver showed in a belt round his waist. He undid the flap of a pocket\nin the lining of his waistcoat, and he began to draw out a sheet of\npaper.\n\nBut Rudolf, great as his powers of self-control were, was but human.\nWhen he saw the paper, he leant forward, half rising from his chair. As\na result, his face came beyond the shadow of the curtain, and the full\nmorning light beat on it. As Rischenheim took the paper out, he\nlooked up. He saw the face that glared so eagerly at him; his eyes met\nRassendyll's: a sudden suspicion seized him, for the face, though the\nking's face in every feature, bore a stern resolution and witnessed a\nvigor that were not the king's. In that instant the truth, or a hint of\nit, flashed across his mind. He gave a half-articulate cry; in one hand\nhe crumpled up the paper, the other flew to his revolver. But he was\ntoo late. Rudolf's left hand encircled his hand and the paper in an iron\ngrip; Rudolf's revolver was on his temple; and an arm was stretched out\nfrom behind the curtain, holding another barrel full before his eyes,\nwhile a dry voice said, \"You'd best take it quietly.\" Then Sapt stepped\nout.\n\nRischenheim had no words to meet the sudden transformation of the\ninterview. He seemed to be able to do nothing but stare at Rudolf\nRassendyll. Sapt wasted no time. He snatched the count's revolver and\nstowed it in his own pocket.\n\n\"Now take the paper,\" said he to Rudolf, and his barrel held Rischenheim\nmotionless while Rudolf wrenched the precious document from his fingers.\n\"Look if it's the right one. No, don't read it through; just look. Is it\nright? That's good. Now put your revolver to his head again. I'm going\nto search him. Stand up, sir.\"\n\nThey compelled the count to stand up, and Sapt subjected him to a search\nthat made the concealment of another copy, or of any other document,\nimpossible. Then they let him sit down again. His eyes seemed fascinated\nby Rudolf Rassendyll.\n\n\"Yet you've seen me before, I think,\" smiled Rudolf. \"I seem to remember\nyou as a boy in Strelsau when I was there. Now tell us, sir, where\ndid you leave this cousin of yours?\" For the plan was to find out from\nRischenheim where Rupert was, and to set off in pursuit of Rupert as\nsoon as they had disposed of Rischenheim.\n\nBut even as Rudolf spoke there was a violent knock at the door. Rudolf\nsprang to open it. Sapt and his revolver kept their places. Bernenstein\nwas on the threshold, open-mouthed.\n\n\"The king's servant has just gone by. He's looking for Colonel Sapt.\nThe King has been walking in the drive, and learnt from a sentry of\nRischenheim's arrival. I told the man that you had taken the count for a\nstroll round the castle, and I did not know where you were. He says that\nthe king may come himself at any moment.\"\n\nSapt considered for one short instant; then he was back by the\nprisoner's side.\n\n\"We must talk again later on,\" he said, in low quick tones. \"Now you're\ngoing to breakfast with the king. I shall be there, and Bernenstein.\nRemember, not a word of your errand, not a word of this gentleman! At\na word, a sign, a hint, a gesture, a motion, as God lives, I'll put a\nbullet through your head, and a thousand kings sha'n't stop me. Rudolf,\nget behind the curtain. If there's an alarm you must jump through the\nwindow into the moat and swim for it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Rudolf Rassendyll. \"I can read my letter there.\"\n\n\"Burn it, you fool.\"\n\n\"When I've read it I'll eat it, if you like, but not before.\"\n\nBernenstein looked in again. \"Quick, quick! The man will be back,\" he\nwhispered.\n\n\"Bernenstein, did you hear what I said to the count?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard.\"\n\n\"Then you know your part. Now, gentlemen, to the king.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said an angry voice outside, \"I wondered how long I was to be\nkept waiting.\"\n\nRudolf Rassendyll skipped behind the curtain. Sapt's revolver slipped\ninto a handy pocket. Rischenheim stood with arms dangling by his side\nand his waistcoat half unbuttoned. Young Bernenstein was bowing low on\nthe threshold, and protesting that the king's servant had but just gone,\nand that they were on the point of waiting on his Majesty. Then the king\nwalked in, pale and full-bearded.\n\n\"Ah, Count,\" said he, \"I'm glad to see you. If they had told me you\nwere here, you shouldn't have waited a minute. You're very dark in here,\nSapt. Why don't you draw back the curtains?\" and the king moved towards\nthe curtain behind which Rudolf was.\n\n\"Allow me, sire,\" cried Sapt, darting past him and laying a hand on the\ncurtain.\n\nA malicious gleam of pleasure shot into Rischenheim's eyes. \"In truth,\nsire,\" continued the constable, his hand on the curtain, \"we were so\ninterested in what the count was saying about his dogs--\"\n\n\"By heaven, I forgot!\" cried the king. \"Yes, yes, the dogs. Now tell me,\nCount--\"\n\n\"Your pardon, sire,\" put in young Bernenstein, \"but breakfast waits.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Well, then, we'll have them together--breakfast and the\ndogs. Come along, Count.\" The king passed his arm through Rischenheim's,\nadding to Bernenstein, \"Lead the way, Lieutenant; and you, Colonel, come\nwith us.\"\n\nThey went out. Sapt stopped and locked the door behind him. \"Why do you\nlock the door, Colonel?\" asked the king.\n\n\"There are some papers in my drawer there, sire.\"\n\n\"But why not lock the drawer?\n\n\"I have lost the key, sire, like the fool I am,\" said the colonel.\n\nThe Count of Luzau-Rischenheim did not make a very good breakfast. He\nsat opposite to the king. Colonel Sapt placed himself at the back of the\nking's chair, and Rischenheim saw the muzzle of a revolver resting on\nthe top of the chair just behind his Majesty's right ear. Bernenstein\nstood in soldierly rigidity by the door; Rischenheim looked round at him\nonce and met a most significant gaze.\n\n\"You're eating nothing,\" said the king. \"I hope you're not indisposed?\"\n\n\"I am a little upset, sire,\" stammered Rischenheim, and truly enough.\n\n\"Well, tell me about the dogs--while I eat, for I'm hungry.\"\n\nRischenheim began to disclose his secret. His statement was decidedly\nwanting in clearness. The king grew impatient.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said he testily, and he pushed his chair back so\nquickly that Sapt skipped away, and hid the revolver behind his back.\n\n\"Sire--\" cried Rischenheim, half rising. A cough from Lieutenant von\nBernenstein interrupted him.\n\n\"Tell it me all over again,\" said the king. Rischenheim did as he was\nbid.\n\n\"Ah, I understand a little better now. Do you see, Sapt?\" and he turned\nhis head round towards the constable. Sapt had just time to whisk the\nrevolver away. The count lent forward towards the king. Lieutenant von\nBernenstein coughed. The count sank back again.\n\n\"Perfectly, sire,\" said Colonel Sapt. \"I understand all the count wishes\nto convey to your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Well, I understand about half,\" said the king with a laugh. \"But\nperhaps that'll be enough.\"\n\n\"I think quite enough, sire,\" answered Sapt with a smile. The important\nmatter of the dogs being thus disposed of, the king recollected that the\ncount had asked for an audience on a matter of business.\n\n\"Now, what did you wish to say to me?\" he asked, with a weary air. The\ndogs had been more interesting.\n\nRischenheim looked at Sapt. The revolver was in its place; Bernenstein\ncoughed again. Yet he saw a chance.\n\n\"Your pardon, sire,\" said he, \"but we are not alone.\"\n\nThe king lifted his eyebrows.\n\n\"Is the business so private?\" he asked.\n\n\"I should prefer to tell it to your Majesty alone,\" pleaded the count.\n\nNow Sapt was resolved not to leave Rischenheim alone with the king, for,\nalthough the count, being robbed of his evidence could do little harm\nconcerning the letter, he would doubtless tell the king that Rudolf\nRassendyll was in the castle. He leant now over the king's shoulder, and\nsaid with a sneer:\n\n\"Messages from Rupert of Hentzau are too exalted matters for my poor\nears, it seems.\"\n\nThe king flushed red.\n\n\"Is that your business, my lord?\" he asked Rischenheim sternly.\n\n\"Your Majesty does not know what my cousin--\"\n\n\"It is the old plea?\" interrupted the king. \"He wants to come back? Is\nthat all, or is there anything else?\"\n\nA moment's silence followed the king's words. Sapt looked full at\nRischenheim, and smiled as he slightly raised his right hand and showed\nthe revolver. Bernenstein coughed twice. Rischenheim sat twisting his\nfingers. He understood that, cost what it might, they would not let him\ndeclare his errand to the king or betray Mr. Rassendyll's presence. He\ncleared his throat and opened his mouth as if to speak, but still he\nremained silent.\n\n\"Well, my lord, is it the old story or something new,\" asked the king\nimpatiently.\n\nAgain Rischenheim sat silent.\n\n\"Are you dumb, my lord?\" cried the king most impatiently.\n\n\"It--it is only what you call the old story, sire.\"\n\n\"Then let me say that you have treated me very badly in obtaining\nan audience of me for any such purpose,\" said the king. \"You knew my\ndecision, and your cousin knows it.\" Thus speaking, the king rose;\nSapt's revolver slid into his pocket; but Lieutenant von Bernenstein\ndrew his sword and stood at the salute; he also coughed.\n\n\"My dear Rischenheim,\" pursued the king more kindly, \"I can allow for\nyour natural affection. But, believe me, in this case it misleads you.\nDo me the favor not to open this subject again to me.\"\n\nRischenheim, humiliated and angry, could do nothing but bow in\nacknowledgment of the king's rebuke.\n\n\"Colonel Sapt, see that the count is well entertained. My horse should\nbe at the door by now. Farewell, Count. Bernenstein, give me your arm.\"\n\nBernenstein shot a rapid glance at the constable. Sapt nodded\nreassuringly. Bernenstein sheathed his sword and gave his arm to the\nking. They passed through the door, and Bernenstein closed it with a\nbackward push of his hand. But at this moment Rischenheim, goaded to\nfury and desperate at the trick played on him--seeing, moreover, that\nhe had now only one man to deal with--made a sudden rush at the door.\nHe reached it, and his hand was on the door-knob. But Sapt was upon him,\nand Sapt's revolver was at his ear.\n\nIn the passage the king stopped.\n\n\"What are they doing in there?\" he asked, hearing the noise of the quick\nmovements.\n\n\"I don't know, sire,\" said Bernenstein, and he took a step forward.\n\n\"No, stop a minute, Lieutenant; you're pulling me along!\"\n\n\"A thousand pardons, sire.\"\n\n\"I hear nothing more now.\" And there was nothing to hear, for the two\nnow stood dead silent inside the door.\n\n\"Nor I, sire. Will your Majesty go on?\" And Bernenstein took another\nstep.\n\n\"You're determined I shall,\" said the king with a laugh, and he let the\nyoung officer lead him away.\n\nInside the room, Rischenheim stood with his back against the door.\nHe was panting for breath, and his face was flushed and working with\nexcitement. Opposite to him stood Sapt, revolver in hand.\n\n\"Till you get to heaven, my lord,\" said the constable, \"you'll never be\nnearer to it than you were in that moment. If you had opened the door,\nI'd have shot you through the head.\"\n\nAs he spoke there came a knock at the door.\n\n\"Open it,\" he said brusquely to Rischenheim. With a muttered curse the\ncount obeyed him. A servant stood outside with a telegram on a salver.\n\n\"Take it,\" whispered Sapt, and Rischenheim put out his hand.\n\n\"Your pardon, my lord, but this has arrived for you,\" said the man\nrespectfully.\n\n\"Take it,\" whispered Sapt again.\n\n\"Give it me,\" muttered Rischenheim confusedly; and he took the envelope.\n\nThe servant bowed and shut the door.\n\n\"Open it,\" commanded Sapt.\n\n\"God's curse on you!\" cried Rischenheim in a voice that choked with\npassion.\n\n\"Eh? Oh, you can have no secrets from so good a friend as I am, my lord.\nBe quick and open it.\"\n\nThe count began to open it.\n\n\"If you tear it up, or crumple it, I'll shoot you,\" said Sapt quietly.\n\"You know you can trust my word. Now read it.\"\n\n\"By God, I won't read it.\"\n\n\"Read it, I tell you, or say your prayers.\"\n\nThe muzzle was within a foot of his head. He unfolded the telegram. Then\nhe looked at Sapt. \"Read,\" said the constable.\n\n\"I don't understand what it means,\" grumbled Rischenheim.\n\n\"Possibly I may be able to help you.\"\n\n\"It's nothing but--\"\n\n\"Read, my lord, read!\"\n\nThen he read, and this was the telegram: \"Holf, 19 Konigstrasse.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks, my lord. And--the place it's despatched from?\"\n\n\"Strelsau.\"\n\n\"Just turn it so that I can see. Oh, I don't doubt you, but seeing is\nbelieving. Ah, thanks. It's as you say. You're puzzled what it means,\nCount?\"\n\n\"I don't know at all what it means!\"\n\n\"How strange! Because I can guess so well.\"\n\n\"You are very acute, sir.\"\n\n\"It seems to me a simple thing to guess, my lord.\"\n\n\"And pray,\" said Rischenheim, endeavoring to assume an easy and\nsarcastic air, \"what does your wisdom tell you that the message means?\"\n\n\"I think, my lord, that the message is an address.\"\n\n\"An address! I never thought of that. But I know no Holf.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's Holf's address.\"\n\n\"Whose, then?\" asked Rischenheim, biting his nail, and looking furtively\nat the constable.\n\n\"Why,\" said Sapt, \"the present address of Count Rupert of Hentzau.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he fixed his eyes on the eyes of Rischenheim. He gave a\nshort, sharp laugh, then put his revolver in his pocket and bowed to the\ncount.\n\n\"In truth, you are very convenient, my dear Count,\" said he.\n\n            *    *    *    *    *\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE TASK OF THE QUEEN'S SERVANTS\n\nTHE doctor who attended me at Wintenberg was not only discreet, but also\nindulgent; perhaps he had the sense to see that little benefit would\ncome to a sick man from fretting in helplessness on his back, when he\nwas on fire to be afoot. I fear he thought the baker's rolling-pin was\nin my mind, but at any rate I extorted a consent from him, and was on\nmy way home from Wintenberg not much more than twelve hours after Rudolf\nRassendyll left me. Thus I arrived at my own house in Strelsau on the\nsame Friday morning that witnessed the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim's\ntwo-fold interview with the king at the Castle of Zenda. The moment I\nhad arrived, I sent James, whose assistance had been, and continued\nto be, in all respects most valuable, to despatch a message to the\nconstable, acquainting him with my whereabouts, and putting myself\nentirely at his disposal. Sapt received this message while a council of\nwar was being held, and the information it gave aided not a little in\nthe arrangements that the constable and Rudolf Rassendyll made. What\nthese were I must now relate, although, I fear, at the risk of some\ntediousness.\n\nYet that council of war in Zenda was held under no common circumstances.\nCowed as Rischenheim appeared, they dared not let him out of their\nsight. Rudolf could not leave the room into which Sapt had locked him;\nthe king's absence was to be short, and before he came again Rudolf must\nbe gone, Rischenheim safely disposed of, and measures taken against the\noriginal letter reaching the hands for which the intercepted copy had\nbeen destined. The room was a large one. In the corner farthest from\nthe door sat Rischenheim, disarmed, dispirited, to all seeming ready to\nthrow up his dangerous game and acquiesce in any terms presented to him.\nJust inside the door, guarding it, if need should be, with their lives,\nwere the other three, Bernenstein merry and triumphant, Sapt blunt and\ncool, Rudolf calm and clear-headed. The queen awaited the result of\ntheir deliberations in her apartments, ready to act as they directed,\nbut determined to see Rudolf before he left the castle. They conversed\ntogether in low tones. Presently Sapt took paper and wrote. This first\nmessage was to me, and it bade me come to Zenda that afternoon; another\nhead and another pair of hands were sadly needed. Then followed more\ndeliberation; Rudolf took up the talking now, for his was the bold plan\non which they consulted. Sapt twirled his moustache, smiling doubtfully.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured young Bernenstein, his eyes alight with excitement.\n\n\"It's dangerous, but the best thing,\" said Rudolf, carefully sinking\nhis voice yet lower, lest the prisoner should catch the lightest word\nof what he said. \"It involves my staying here till the evening. Is that\npossible?\"\n\n\"No; but you can leave here and hide in the forest till I join you,\"\nsaid Sapt.\n\n\"Till we join you,\" corrected Bernenstein eagerly.\n\n\"No,\" said the constable, \"you must look after our friend here. Come,\nLieutenant, it's all in the queen's service.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Rudolf with a smile, \"neither the colonel nor I would\nlet you have a chance at Rupert. He's our game, isn't he, Sapt?\"\n\nThe colonel nodded. Rudolf in his turn took paper, and here is the\nmessage that he wrote:\n\n\"Holf, 19, Konigstrasse, Strelsau.--All well. He has what I had, but\nwishes to see what you have. He and I will be at the hunting-lodge\nat ten this evening. Bring it and meet us. The business is\nunsuspected.--R.\"\n\nRudolf threw the paper across to Sapt; Bernenstein leant over the\nconstable's shoulder and read it eagerly.\n\n\"I doubt if it would bring me,\" grinned old Sapt, throwing the paper\ndown.\n\n\"It'll bring Rupert to Hentzau. Why not? He'll know that the king will\nwish to meet him unknown to the queen, and also unknown to you, Sapt,\nsince you were my friend: what place more likely for the king to choose\nthan his hunting-lodge, where he is accustomed to go when he wishes to\nbe alone? The message will bring him, depend on it. Why, man, Rupert\nwould come even if he suspected; and why should he suspect?\"\n\n\"They may have a cipher, he and Rischenheim,\" objected Sapt.\n\n\"No, or Rupert would have sent the address in it,\" retorted Rudolf\nquickly.\n\n\"Then--when he comes?\" asked Bernenstein.\n\n\"He finds such a king as Rischenheim found, and Sapt, here, at his\nelbow.\"\n\n\"But he'll know you,\" objected Bernenstein.\n\n\"Ay, I think he'll know me,\" said Rudolf with a smile. \"Meanwhile we\nsend for Fritz to come here and look after the king.\"\n\n\"And Rischenheim?\"\n\n\"That's your share, Lieutenant. Sapt, is any one at Tarlenheim?\"\n\n\"No. Count Stanislas has put it at Fritz's disposal.\"\n\n\"Good; then Fritz's two friends, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim and\nLieutenant von Bernenstein, will ride over there to-day. The constable\nof Zenda will give the lieutenant twenty-four hours' leave of absence,\nand the two gentlemen will pass the day and sleep at the chateau. They\nwill pass the day side by side, Bernenstein, not losing sight of one\nanother for an instant, and they will pass the night in the same room.\nAnd one of them will not close his eyes nor take his hand off the butt\nof his revolver.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" said young Bernenstein.\n\n\"If he tries to escape or give any alarm, shoot him through the head,\nride to the frontier, get to safe hiding, and, if you can, let us know.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bernenstein simply. Sapt had chosen well, and the young\nofficer made nothing of the peril and ruin that her Majesty's service\nmight ask of him.\n\nA restless movement and a weary sigh from Rischenheim attracted their\nattention. He had strained his ears to listen till his head ached, but\nthe talkers had been careful, and he had heard nothing that threw light\non their deliberations. He had now given up his vain attempt, and sat in\nlistless inattention, sunk in an apathy.\n\n\"I don't think he'll give you much trouble,\" whispered Sapt to\nBernenstein, with a jerk of his thumb towards the captive.\n\n\"Act as if he were likely to give you much,\" urged Rudolf, laying his\nhand on the lieutenant's arm.\n\n\"Yes, that's a wise man's advice,\" nodded the constable approvingly. \"We\nwere well governed, Lieutenant, when this Rudolf was king.\"\n\n\"Wasn't I also his loyal subject?\" asked young Bernenstein.\n\n\"Yes, wounded in my service,\" added Rudolf; for he remembered how\nthe boy--he was little more then--had been fired upon in the park of\nTarlenheim, being taken for Mr. Rassendyll himself.\n\nThus their plans were laid. If they could defeat Rupert, they would have\nRischenheim at their mercy. If they could keep Rischenheim out of the\nway while they used his name in their trick, they had a strong chance of\ndeluding and killing Rupert. Yes, of killing him; for that and nothing\nless was their purpose, as the constable of Zenda himself has told me.\n\n\"We would have stood on no ceremony,\" he said. \"The queen's honor was at\nstake, and the fellow himself an assassin.\"\n\nBernenstein rose and went out. He was gone about half an hour, being\nemployed in despatching the telegrams to Strelsau. Rudolf and Sapt used\nthe interval to explain to Rischenheim what they proposed to do with\nhim. They asked no pledge, and he offered none. He heard what they\nsaid with a dulled uninterested air. When asked if he would go without\nresistance, he laughed a bitter laugh. \"How can I resist?\" he asked. \"I\nshould have a bullet through my head.\"\n\n\"Why, without doubt,\" said Colonel Sapt. \"My lord, you are very\nsensible.\"\n\n\"Let me advise you, my lord,\" said Rudolf, looking down on him kindly\nenough, \"if you come safe through this affair, to add honor to your\nprudence, and chivalry to your honor. There is still time for you to\nbecome a gentleman.\"\n\nHe turned away, followed by a glance of anger from the count and a\ngrating chuckle from old Sapt.\n\nA few moments later Bernenstein returned. His errand was done, and\nhorses for himself and Rischenheim were at the gate of the castle. After\na few final words and clasp of the hand from Rudolf, the lieutenant\nmotioned to his prisoner to accompany him, and they two walked out\ntogether, being to all appearance willing companions and in perfect\nfriendliness with one another. The queen herself watched them go from\nthe windows of her apartment, and noticed that Bernenstein rode half a\npace behind, and that his free hand rested on the revolver by his side.\n\nIt was now well on in the morning, and the risk of Rudolf's sojourn in\nthe castle grew greater with every moment. Yet he was resolved to\nsee the queen before he went. This interview presented no great\ndifficulties, since her Majesty was in the habit of coming to the\nconstable's room to take his advice or to consult with him. The hardest\ntask was to contrive afterwards a free and unnoticed escape for Mr.\nRassendyll. To meet this necessity, the constable issued orders that\nthe company of guards which garrisoned the castle should parade at\none o'clock in the park, and that the servants should all, after their\ndinner, be granted permission to watch the manoeuvres. By this means he\ncounted on drawing off any curious eyes and allowing Rudolf to reach the\nforest unobserved. They appointed a rendezvous in a handy and sheltered\nspot; the one thing which they were compelled to trust to fortune was\nRudolf's success in evading chance encounters while he waited. Mr.\nRassendyll himself was confident of his ability to conceal his presence,\nor, if need were, so to hide his face that no strange tale of the king\nbeing seen wandering, alone and beardless, should reach the ears of the\ncastle or the town.\n\nWhile Sapt was making his arrangements, Queen Flavia came to the room\nwhere Rudolf Rassendyll was. It was then nearing twelve, and young\nBernenstein had been gone half an hour. Sapt attended her to the door,\nset a sentry at the end of the passage with orders that her Majesty\nshould on no pretence be disturbed, promised her very audibly to return\nas soon as he possibly could, and respectfully closed the door after\nshe had entered. The constable was well aware of the value in a secret\nbusiness of doing openly all that can safely be done with openness.\n\nAll of what passed at that interview I do not know, but a part Queen\nFlavia herself told to me, or rather to Helga, my wife; for although it\nwas meant to reach my ear, yet to me, a man, she would not disclose it\ndirectly. First she learnt from Mr. Rassendyll the plans that had been\nmade, and, although she trembled at the danger that he must run in\nmeeting Rupert of Hentzau, she had such love of him and such a trust in\nhis powers that she seemed to doubt little of his success. But she began\nto reproach herself for having brought him into this peril by writing\nher letter. At this he took from his pocket the copy that Rischenheim\nhad carried. He had found time to read it, and now before her eyes he\nkissed it.\n\n\"Had I as many lives as there are words, my queen,\" he said softly, \"for\neach word I would gladly give a life.\"\n\n\"Ah, Rudolf, but you've only one life, and that more mine than yours.\nDid you think we should ever meet again?\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said he; and now they were standing opposite one\nanother.\n\n\"But I knew,\" she said, her eyes shining brightly; \"I knew always that\nwe should meet once more. Not how, nor where, but just that we should.\nSo I lived, Rudolf.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I lived through it all.\"\n\nHe pressed her hand, knowing what that phrase meant and must mean for\nher.\n\n\"Will it last forever?\" she asked, suddenly gripping his hand tightly.\nBut a moment later she went on: \"No, no, I mustn't make you unhappy,\nRudolf. I'm half glad I wrote the letter, and half glad they stole\nit. It's so sweet to have you fighting for me, for me only this time,\nRudolf--not for the king, for me!\"\n\n\"Sweet indeed, my dearest lady. Don't be afraid: we shall win.\"\n\n\"You will win, yes. And then you'll go?\" And, dropping his hand, she\ncovered her face with hers.\n\n\"I mustn't kiss your face,\" said he, \"but your hands I may kiss,\" and he\nkissed her hands as they were pressed against her face.\n\n\"You wear my ring,\" she murmured through her fingers, \"always?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" he said, with a little laugh of wonder at her question.\n\n\"And there is--no one else?\"\n\n\"My queen!\" said he, laughing again.\n\n\"No, I knew really, Rudolf, I knew really,\" and now her hands flew out\ntowards him, imploring his pardon. Then she began to speak quickly:\n\"Rudolf, last night I had a dream about you, a strange dream. I seemed\nto be in Strelsau, and all the people were talking about the king. It\nwas you they meant; you were the king. At last you were the king, and I\nwas your queen. But I could see you only very dimly; you were somewhere,\nbut I could not make out where; just sometimes your face came. Then I\ntried to tell you that you were king--yes, and Colonel Sapt and Fritz\ntried to tell you; the people, too, called out that you were king. What\ndid it mean? But your face, when I saw it, was unmoved, and very pale,\nand you seemed not to hear what we said, not even what I said. It almost\nseemed as if you were dead, and yet king. Ah, you mustn't die, even to\nbe king,\" and she laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Sweetheart,\" said he gently, \"in dreams desires and fears blend in\nstrange visions, so I seemed to you to be both a king and a dead man;\nbut I'm not a king, and I am a very healthy fellow. Yet a thousand\nthanks to my dearest queen for dreaming of me.\"\n\n\"No, but what could it mean?\" she asked again.\n\n\"What does it mean when I dream always of you, except that I always love\nyou?\"\n\n\"Was it only that?\" she said, still unconvinced.\n\nWhat more passed between them I do not know. I think that the queen told\nmy wife more, but women will sometimes keep women's secrets even from\ntheir husbands; though they love us, yet we are always in some sort the\ncommon enemy, against whom they join hands. Well, I would not look too\nfar into such secrets, for to know must be, I suppose, to blame, and who\nis himself so blameless that in such a case he would be free with his\ncensures?\n\nYet much cannot have passed, for almost close on their talk about the\ndream came Colonel Sapt, saying that the guards were in line, and all\nthe women streamed out to watch them, while the men followed, lest the\ngay uniforms should make them forgotten. Certainly a quiet fell over\nthe old castle, that only the constable's curt tones broke, as he bade\nRudolf come by the back way to the stables and mount his horse.\n\n\"There's no time to lose,\" said Sapt, and his eye seemed to grudge the\nqueen even one more word with the man she loved.\n\nBut Rudolf was not to be hurried into leaving her in such a fashion. He\nclapped the constable on the shoulder, laughing, and bidding him think\nof what he would for a moment; then he went again to the queen and would\nhave knelt before her, but that she would not suffer, and they stood\nwith hands locked. Then suddenly she drew him to her and kissed his\nforehead, saying: \"God go with you, Rudolf my knight.\"\n\nThus she turned away, letting him go. He walked towards the door; but a\nsound arrested his steps, and he waited in the middle of the room, his\neyes on the door. Old Sapt flew to the threshold, his sword half-way out\nof its sheath. There was a step coming down the passage, and the feet\nstopped outside the door.\n\n\"Is it the king?\" whispered Rudolf.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Sapt.\n\n\"No, it's not the king,\" came in unhesitating certainty from Queen\nFlavia.\n\nThey waited: a low knock sounded on the door. Still for a moment they\nwaited. The knock was repeated urgently.\n\n\"We must open,\" said Sapt. \"Behind the curtain with you, Rudolf.\"\n\nThe queen sat down, and Sapt piled a heap of papers before her, that it\nmight seem as though he and she transacted business. But his precautions\nwere interrupted by a hoarse, eager, low cry from outside, \"Quick! in\nGod's name, quick!\"\n\nThey knew the voice for Bernenstein's. The queen sprang up, Rudolf came\nout, Sapt turned the key. The lieutenant entered, hurried, breathless,\npale.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Sapt.\n\n\"He has got away?\" cried Rudolf, guessing in a moment the misfortune\nthat had brought Bernenstein back.\n\n\"Yes, he's got away. Just as we left the town and reached the open road\ntowards Tarlenheim, he said, 'Are we going to walk all the way? I was\nnot loath to go quicker, and we broke into a trot. But I--ah, what a\npestilent fool I am!\"\n\n\"Never mind that--go on.\"\n\n\"Why, I was thinking of him and my task, and having a bullet ready for\nhim, and--\"\n\n\"Of everything except your horse?\" guessed Sapt, with a grim smile.\n\n\"Yes; and the horse pecked and stumbled, and I fell forward on his neck.\nI put out my arm to recover myself, and--I jerked my revolver on to the\nground.\"\n\n\"And he saw?\"\n\n\"He saw, curse him. For a second he waited; then he smiled, and turned,\nand dug his spurs in and was off, straight across country towards\nStrelsau. Well, I was off my horse in a moment, and I fired three times\nafter him.\"\n\n\"You hit?\" asked Rudolf.\n\n\"I think so. He shifted the reins from one hand to the other and wrung\nhis arm. I mounted and made after him, but his horse was better than\nmine and he gained ground. We began to meet people, too, and I didn't\ndare to fire again. So I left him and rode here to tell you. Never\nemploy me again, Constable, so long as you live,\" and the young man's\nface was twisted with misery and shame, as, forgetting the queen's\npresence, he sank despondently into a chair.\n\nSapt took no notice of his self-reproaches. But Rudolf went and laid a\nhand on his shoulder.\n\n\"It was an accident,\" he said. \"No blame to you.\"\n\nThe queen rose and walked towards him; Bernenstein sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"it is not success but effort that should gain thanks,\"\nand she held out her hand.\n\nWell, he was young; I do not laugh at the sob that escaped his lips as\nhe turned his head.\n\n\"Let me try something else!\" he implored.\n\n\"Mr. Rassendyll,\" said the queen, \"you'll do my pleasure by employing\nthis gentleman in my further service. I am already deep in his debt, and\nwould be deeper.\" There was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Well, but what's to be done?\" asked Colonel Sapt. \"He's gone to\nStrelsau.\"\n\n\"He'll stop Rupert,\" mused Mr. Rassendyll. \"He may or he mayn't.\"\n\n\"It's odds that he will.\"\n\n\"We must provide for both.\"\n\nSapt and Rudolf looked at one another.\n\n\"You must be here!\" asked Rudolf of the constable. \"Well, I'll go to\nStrelsau.\" His smile broke out. \"That is, if Bernenstein'll lend me a\nhat.\"\n\nThe queen made no sound; but she came and laid her hand on his arm. He\nlooked at her, smiling still.\n\n\"Yes, I'll go to Strelsau,\" said he, \"and I'll find Rupert, ay, and\nRischenheim too, if they're in the city.\"\n\n\"Take me with you,\" cried Bernenstein eagerly.\n\nRudolf glanced at Sapt. The constable shook his head. Bernenstein's face\nfell.\n\n\"It's not that, boy,\" said old Sapt, half in kindness, half in\nimpatience. \"We want you here. Suppose Rupert comes here with\nRischenheim!\"\n\nThe idea was new, but the event was by no means unlikely.\n\n\"But you'll be here, Constable,\" urged Bernenstein, \"and Fritz von\nTarlenheim will arrive in an hour.\"\n\n\"Ay, young man,\" said Sapt, nodding his head; \"but when I fight Rupert\nof Hentzau, I like to have a man to spare,\" and he grinned broadly, being\nno whit afraid of what Bernenstein might think of his courage. \"Now go\nand get him a hat,\" he added, and the lieutenant ran off on the errand.\n\nBut the queen cried:\n\n\"Are you sending Rudolf alone, then--alone against two?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, if I may command the campaign,\" said Sapt. \"I take it he\nshould be equal to the task.\"\n\nHe could not know the feelings of the queen's heart. She dashed her hand\nacross her eyes, and turned in mute entreaty to Rudolf Rassendyll.\n\n\"I must go,\" he said softly. \"We can't spare Bernenstein, and I mustn't\nstay here.\"\n\nShe said no more. Rudolf walked across to Sapt.\n\n\"Take me to the stables. Is the horse good? I daren't take the train.\nAh, here's the lieutenant and the hat.\"\n\n\"The horse'll get you there to-night,\" said Sapt. \"Come along.\nBernenstein, stay with the queen.\"\n\nAt the threshold Rudolf paused, and, turning his head, glanced once\nat Queen Flavia, who stood still as a statue, watching him go. Then\nhe followed the constable, who brought him where the horse was. Sapt's\ndevices for securing freedom from observation had served well, and\nRudolf mounted unmolested.\n\n\"The hat doesn't fit very well,\" said Rudolf.\n\n\"Like a crown better, eh?\" suggested the colonel.\n\nRudolf laughed as he asked, \"Well, what are my orders?\"\n\n\"Ride round by the moat to the road at the back; then through the forest\nto Hofbau; you know your way after that. You mustn't reach Strelsau till\nit's dark. Then, if you want a shelter--\"\n\n\"To Fritz von Tarlenheim's, yes! From there I shall go straight to the\naddress.\"\n\n\"Ay. And--Rudolf!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Make an end of him this time.\"\n\n\"Please God. But if he goes to the lodge? He will, unless Rischenheim\nstops him.\"\n\n\"I'll be there in case--but I think Rischenheim will stop him.\"\n\n\"If he comes here?\"\n\n\"Young Bernenstein will die before he suffers him to reach the king.\"\n\n\"Sapt!\"\n\n\"Ay?\"\n\n\"Be kind to her.\"\n\n\"Bless the man, yes!\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\n\"And good luck.\"\n\nAt a swift canter Rudolf darted round the drive that led from the\nstables, by the moat, to the old forest road behind; five minutes\nbrought him within the shelter of the trees, and he rode on confidently,\nmeeting nobody, save here and there a yokel, who, seeing a man ride hard\nwith his head averted, took no more notice of him than to wish that he\nhimself could ride abroad instead of being bound to work. Thus Rudolf\nRassendyll set out again for the walls of Strelsau, through the forest\nof Zenda. And ahead of him, with an hour's start, galloped the Count of\nLuzau-Rischenheim, again a man, and a man with resolution, resentment,\nand revenge in his heart.\n\nThe game was afoot now; who could tell the issue of it?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE MESSAGE OF SIMON THE HUNTSMAN\n\nI RECEIVED the telegram sent to me by the Constable of Zenda at my own\nhouse in Strelsau about one o'clock. It is needless to say that I\nmade immediate preparations to obey his summons. My wife indeed\nprotested--and I must admit with some show of reason--that I was unfit\nto endure further fatigues, and that my bed was the only proper place\nfor me. I could not listen; and James, Mr. Rassendyll's servant, being\ninformed of the summons, was at my elbow with a card of the trains from\nStrelsau to Zenda, without waiting for any order from me. I had talked\nto this man in the course of our journey, and discovered that he had\nbeen in the service of Lord Topham, formerly British Ambassador to the\nCourt of Ruritania. How far he was acquainted with the secrets of his\npresent master, I did not know, but his familiarity with the city\nand the country made him of great use to me. We discovered, to our\nannoyance, that no train left till four o'clock, and then only a slow\none; the result was that we could not arrive at the castle till past\nsix o'clock. This hour was not absolutely too late, but I was of course\neager to be on the scene of action as early as possible.\n\n\"You'd better see if you can get a special, my lord,\" James suggested;\n\"I'll run on to the station and arrange about it.\"\n\nI agreed. Since I was known to be often employed in the king's service,\nI could take a special train without exciting remark. James set out, and\nabout a quarter of an hour later I got into my carriage to drive to the\nstation. Just as the horses were about to start, however, the butler\napproached me.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my lord,\" said he, \"but Bauer didn't return with\nyour lordship. Is he coming back?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I. \"Bauer was grossly impertinent on the journey, and I\ndismissed him.\"\n\n\"Those foreign men are never to be trusted, my lord. And your lordship's\nbag?\"\n\n\"What, hasn't it come?\" I cried. \"I told him to send it.\"\n\n\"It's not arrived, my lord.\"\n\n\"Can the rogue have stolen it?\" I exclaimed indignantly.\n\n\"If your lordship wishes it, I will mention the matter to the police.\"\n\nI appeared to consider this proposal.\n\n\"Wait till I come back,\" I ended by saying. \"The bag may come, and I\nhave no reason to doubt the fellow's honesty.\"\n\nThis, I thought, would be the end of my connection with Master Bauer. He\nhad served Rupert's turn, and would now disappear from the scene. Indeed\nit may be that Rupert would have liked to dispense with further aid from\nhim; but he had few whom he could trust, and was compelled to employ\nthose few more than once. At any rate he had not done with Bauer, and I\nvery soon received proof of the fact. My house is a couple of miles from\nthe station, and we have to pass through a considerable part of the old\ntown, where the streets are narrow and tortuous and progress necessarily\nslow. We had just entered the Konigstrasse (and it must be remembered\nthat I had at that time no reason for attaching any special significance\nto this locality), and were waiting impatiently for a heavy dray to\nmove out of our path, when my coachman, who had overheard the butler's\nconversation with me, leant down from his box with an air of lively\nexcitement.\n\n\"My lord,\" he cried, \"there's Bauer--there, passing the butcher's shop!\"\n\nI sprang up in the carriage; the man's back was towards me, and he was\nthreading his way through the people with a quick, stealthy tread. I\nbelieve he must have seen me, and was slinking away as fast as he could.\nI was not sure of him, but the coachman banished my doubt by saying,\n\"It's Bauer--it's certainly Bauer, my lord.\"\n\nI hardly stayed to form a resolution. If I could catch this fellow or\neven see where he went, a most important clue as to Rupert's doings\nand whereabouts might be put into my hand. I leapt out of the carriage,\nbidding the man wait, and at once started in pursuit of my former\nservant. I heard the coachman laugh: he thought, no doubt, that anxiety\nfor the missing bag inspired such eager haste.\n\nThe numbers of the houses in the Konigstrasse begin, as anybody familiar\nwith Strelsau will remember, at the end adjoining the station. The\nstreet being a long one, intersecting almost the entire length of the\nold town, I was, when I set out after Bauer, opposite number 300 or\nthereabouts, and distant nearly three-quarters of a mile from that\nimportant number nineteen, towards which Bauer was hurrying like a\nrabbit to its burrow. I knew nothing and thought nothing of where he\nwas going; to me nineteen was no more than eighteen or twenty; my only\ndesire was to overtake him. I had no clear idea of what I meant to do\nwhen I caught him, but I had some hazy notion of intimidating him into\ngiving up his secret by the threat of an accusation of theft. In fact,\nhe had stolen my bag. After him I went; and he knew that I was after\nhim. I saw him turn his face over his shoulder, and then bustle on\nfaster. Neither of us, pursued or pursuer, dared quite to run; as it\nwas, our eager strides and our carelessness of collisions created more\nthan enough attention. But I had one advantage. Most folk in Strelsau\nknew me, and many got out of my way who were by no means inclined to pay\na like civility to Bauer. Thus I began to gain on him, in spite of his\nhaste; I had started fifty yards behind, but as we neared the end of the\nstreet and saw the station ahead of us, not more than twenty separated\nme from him. Then an annoying thing happened. I ran full into a stout\nold gentleman; Bauer had run into him before, and he was standing, as\npeople will, staring in resentful astonishment at his first assailant's\nretreating figure. The second collision immensely increased his\nvexation; for me it had yet worse consequences; for when I disentangled\nmyself, Bauer was gone! There was not a sign of him; I looked up: the\nnumber of the house above me was twenty-three; but the door was shut.\nI walked on a few paces, past twenty-two, past twenty-one--and up to\nnineteen. Nineteen was an old house, with a dirty, dilapidated front and\nan air almost dissipated. It was a shop where provisions of the cheaper\nsort were on view in the window, things that one has never eaten but has\nheard of people eating. The shop-door stood open, but there was nothing\nto connect Bauer with the house. Muttering an oath in my exasperation, I\nwas about to pass on, when an old woman put her head out of the door and\nlooked round. I was full in front of her. I am sure that the old woman\nstarted slightly, and I think that I did. For I knew her and she knew\nme. She was old Mother Holf, one of whose sons, Johann, had betrayed to\nus the secret of the dungeon at Zenda, while the other had died by Mr.\nRassendyll's hand by the side of the great pipe that masked the king's\nwindow. Her presence might mean nothing, yet it seemed at once to\nconnect the house with the secret of the past and the crisis of the\npresent.\n\nShe recovered herself in a moment, and curtseyed to me.\n\n\"Ah, Mother Holf,\" said I, \"how long is it since you set up shop in\nStrelsau?\"\n\n\"About six months, my lord,\" she answered, with a composed air and arms\nakimbo.\n\n\"I have not come across you before,\" said I, looking keenly at her.\n\n\"Such a poor little shop as mine would not be likely to secure your\nlordship's patronage,\" she answered, in a humility that seemed only half\ngenuine.\n\nI looked up at the windows. They were all closed and had their wooden\nlattices shut. The house was devoid of any signs of life.\n\n\"You've a good house here, mother, though it wants a splash of paint,\"\nsaid I. \"Do you live all alone in it with your daughter?\" For Max was\ndead and Johann abroad, and the old woman had, as far as I knew, no\nother children.\n\n\"Sometimes; sometimes not,\" said she. \"I let lodgings to single men when\nI can.\"\n\n\"Full now?\"\n\n\"Not a soul, worse luck, my lord.\" Then I shot an arrow at a venture.\n\n\"The man who came in just now, then, was he only a customer?\"\n\n\"I wish a customer had come in, but there has been nobody,\" she replied\nin surprised tones.\n\nI looked full in her eyes; she met mine with a blinking\nimperturbability. There is no face so inscrutable as a clever old\nwoman's when she is on her guard. And her fat body barred the entrance;\nI could not so much as see inside, while the window, choked full with\npigs' trotters and such-like dainties, helped me very little. If the fox\nwere there, he had got to earth and I could not dig him out.\n\nAt this moment I saw James approaching hurriedly. He was looking up\nthe street, no doubt seeking my carriage and chafing at its delay. An\ninstant later he saw me.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"your train will be ready in five minutes; if it\ndoesn't start then, the line must be closed for another half-hour.\"\n\nI perceived a faint smile on the old woman's face. I was sure then that\nI was on the track of Bauer, and probably of more than Bauer. But my\nfirst duty was to obey orders and get to Zenda. Besides, I could not\nforce my way in, there in open daylight, without a scandal that\nwould have set all the long ears in Strelsau aprick. I turned away\nreluctantly. I did not even know for certain that Bauer was within, and\nthus had no information of value to carry with me.\n\n\"If your lordship would kindly recommend me--\" said the old hag.\n\n\"Yes, I'll recommend you,\" said I. \"I'll recommend you to be careful\nwhom you take for lodgers. There are queer fish about, mother.\"\n\n\"I take the money beforehand,\" she retorted with a grin; and I was as\nsure that she was in the plot as of my own existence.\n\nThere was nothing to be done; James's face urged me towards the station.\nI turned away. But at this instant a loud, merry laugh sounded from\ninside the house. I started, and this time violently. The old woman's\nbrow contracted in a frown, and her lips twitched for a moment; then\nher face regained its composure; but I knew the laugh, and she must\nhave guessed that I knew it. Instantly I tried to appear as though I had\nnoticed nothing. I nodded to her carelessly, and bidding James follow\nme, set out for the station. But as we reached the platform, I laid my\nhand on his shoulder, saying:\n\n\"The Count of Hentzau is in that house, James.\"\n\nHe looked at me without surprise; he was as hard to stir to wonder as\nold Sapt himself.\n\n\"Indeed, sir. Shall I stay and watch?\"\n\n\"No, come with me,\" I answered. To tell the truth, I thought that to\nleave him alone in Strelsau to watch that house was in all likelihood\nto sign his death warrant, and I shrank from imposing the duty on him.\nRudolf might send him if he would; I dared not. So we got into our\ntrain, and I suppose that my coachman, when he had looked long enough\nfor me, went home. I forgot to ask him afterwards. Very likely he\nthought it a fine joke to see his master hunting a truant servant and\na truant bag through the streets in broad daylight. Had he known the\ntruth, he would have been as interested, though, maybe, less amused.\n\nI arrived at the town of Zenda at half-past three, and was in the castle\nbefore four. I may pass over the most kind and gracious words with which\nthe queen received me. Every sight of her face and every sound of her\nvoice bound a man closer to her service, and now she made me feel that\nI was a poor fellow to have lost her letter and yet to be alive. But she\nwould hear nothing of such talk, choosing rather to praise the little I\nhad done than to blame the great thing in which I had failed. Dismissed\nfrom her presence, I flew open-mouthed to Sapt. I found him in his room\nwith Bernenstein, and had the satisfaction of learning that my news of\nRupert's whereabouts was confirmed by his information. I was also made\nacquainted with all that had been done, even as I have already related\nit, from the first successful trick played on Rischenheim to the moment\nof his unfortunate escape. But my face grew long and apprehensive when I\nheard that Rudolf Rassendyll had gone alone to Strelsau to put his head\nin that lion's mouth in the Konigstrasse.\n\n\"There will be three of them there--Rupert, Rischenheim, and my rascal\nBauer,\" said I.\n\n\"As to Rupert, we don't know,\" Sapt reminded me. \"He'll be there if\nRischenheim arrives in time to tell him the truth. But we have also to\nbe ready for him here, and at the hunting lodge. Well, we're ready for\nhim wherever he is: Rudolf will be in Strelsau, you and I will ride to\nthe lodge, and Bernenstein will be here with the queen.\"\n\n\"Only one here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ay, but a good one,\" said the constable, clapping Bernenstein on the\nshoulder. \"We sha'n't be gone above four hours, and those while the king\nis safe in his bed. Bernenstein has only to refuse access to him, and\nstand to that with his life till we come back. You're equal to that, eh,\nLieutenant?\"\n\nI am, by nature, a cautious man, and prone to look at the dark side of\nevery prospect and the risks of every enterprise; but I could not\nsee what better dispositions were possible against the attack that\nthreatened us. Yet I was sorely uneasy concerning Mr. Rassendyll.\n\nNow, after all our stir and runnings to and fro, came an hour or two of\npeace. We employed the time in having a good meal, and it was past five\nwhen, our repast finished, we sat back in our chairs enjoying cigars.\nJames had waited on us, quietly usurping the office of the constable's\nown servant, and thus we had been able to talk freely. The man's calm\nconfidence in his master and his master's fortune also went far to\ncomfort me.\n\n\"The king should be back soon,\" said Sapt at last, with a glance at his\nbig, old-fashioned silver watch. \"Thank God, he'll be too tired to sit\nup long. We shall be free by nine o'clock, Fritz. I wish young Rupert\nwould come to the lodge!\" And the colonel's face expressed a lively\npleasure at the idea.\n\nSix o'clock struck, and the king did not appear. A few moments later, a\nmessage came from the queen, requesting our presence on the terrace in\nfront of the chateau. The place commanded a view of the road by which\nthe king would ride back, and we found the queen walking restlessly up\nand down, considerably disquieted by the lateness of his return. In such\na position as ours, every unusual or unforeseen incident magnifies its\npossible meaning, and invests itself with a sinister importance which\nwould at ordinary times seem absurd. We three shared the queen's\nfeelings, and forgetting the many chances of the chase, any one of which\nwould amply account for the king's delay, fell to speculating on remote\npossibilities of disaster. He might have met Rischenheim--though\nthey had ridden in opposite directions; Rupert might have intercepted\nhim--though no means could have brought Rupert to the forest so early.\nOur fears defeated common sense, and our conjectures outran possibility.\nSapt was the first to recover from this foolish mood, and he rated us\nsoundly, not sparing even the queen herself. With a laugh we regained\nsome of our equanimity, and felt rather ashamed of our weakness.\n\n\"Still it's strange that he doesn't come,\" murmured the queen, shading\nher eyes with her hand, and looking along the road to where the dark\nmasses of the forest trees bounded our view. It was already dusk, but\nnot so dark but that we could have seen the king's party as soon as it\ncame into the open.\n\nIf the king's delay seemed strange at six, it was stranger at seven, and\nby eight most strange. We had long since ceased to talk lightly; by now\nwe had lapsed into silence. Sapt's scoldings had died away. The queen,\nwrapped in her furs (for it was very cold), sat sometimes on a seat, but\noftener paced restlessly to and fro. Evening had fallen. We did not know\nwhat to do, nor even whether we ought to do anything. Sapt would not own\nto sharing our worst apprehensions, but his gloomy silence in face of\nour surmises witnessed that he was in his heart as disturbed as we were.\nFor my part I had come to the end of my endurance, and I cried, \"For\nGod's sake, let's act! Shall I go and seek him?\"\n\n\"A needle in a bundle of hay,\" said Sapt with a shrug.\n\nBut at this instant my ear caught the sound of horses cantering on the\nroad from the forest; at the same moment Bernenstein cried, \"Here they\ncome!\" The queen paused, and we gathered round her. The horse-hoofs came\nnearer. Now we made out the figures of three men: they were the king's\nhuntsmen, and they rode along merrily, singing a hunting chorus. The\nsound of it brought relief to us; so far at least there was no disaster.\nBut why was not the king with them?\n\n\"The king is probably tired, and is following more slowly, madam,\"\nsuggested Bernenstein.\n\nThis explanation seemed very probable, and the lieutenant and I, as\nready to be hopeful on slight grounds as fearful on small provocation,\njoyfully accepted it. Sapt, less easily turned to either mood, said,\n\"Ay, but let us hear,\" and raising his voice, called to the huntsmen,\nwho had now arrived in the avenue. One of them, the king's chief\nhuntsman Simon, gorgeous in his uniform of green and gold, came\nswaggering along, and bowed low to the queen.\n\n\"Well, Simon, where is the king?\" she asked, trying to smile.\n\n\"The king, madam, has sent a message by me to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Pray, deliver it to me, Simon.\"\n\n\"I will, madam. The king has enjoyed fine sport; and, indeed, madam, if\nI may say so for myself, a better run.--\"\n\n\"You may say, friend Simon,\" interrupted the constable, tapping him\non the shoulder, \"anything you like for yourself, but, as a matter of\netiquette, the king's message should come first.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, Constable,\" said Simon. \"You're always so down on a man, aren't\nyou? Well, then, madam, the king has enjoyed fine sport. For we started\na boar at eleven, and--\"\n\n\"Is this the king's message, Simon?\" asked the queen, smiling in genuine\namusement, but impatiently.\n\n\"Why, no, madam, not precisely his majesty's message.\"\n\n\"Then get to it, man, in Heaven's name,\" growled Sapt testily. For here\nwere we four (the queen, too, one of us!) on tenterhooks, while the fool\nboasted about the sport that he had shown the king. For every boar in\nthe forest Simon took as much credit as though he, and not Almighty God,\nhad made the animal. It is the way with such fellows.\n\nSimon became a little confused under the combined influence of his own\nseductive memories and Sapt's brusque exhortations.\n\n\"As I was saying, madam,\" he resumed, \"the boar led us a long way, but\nat last the hounds pulled him down, and his majesty himself gave the\ncoup de grace. Well, then it was very late.\"\n\n\"It's no earlier now,\" grumbled the constable.\n\n\"And the king, although indeed, madam, his majesty was so gracious as\nto say that no huntsman whom his majesty had ever had, had given his\nmajesty--\"\n\n\"God help us!\" groaned the constable.\n\nSimon shot an apprehensive apologetic glance at Colonel Sapt. The\nconstable was frowning ferociously. In spite of the serious matters in\nhand I could not forbear a smile, while young Bernenstein broke into an\naudible laugh, which he tried to smother with his hand.\n\n\"Yes, the king was very tired, Simon?\" said the queen, at once\nencouraging him and bringing him back to the point with a woman's skill.\n\n\"Yes, madam, the king was very tired; and as we chanced to kill near the\nhunting-lodge--\"\n\nI do not know whether Simon noticed any change in the manner of his\naudience. But the queen looked up with parted lips, and I believe that\nwe three all drew a step nearer him. Sapt did not interrupt this time.\n\n\"Yes, madam, the king was very tired, and as we chanced to kill near the\nhunting-lodge, the king bade us carry our quarry there, and come back\nto dress it to-morrow; so we obeyed, and here we are--that is, except\nHerbert, my brother, who stayed with the king by his majesty's orders.\nBecause, madam, Herbert is a handy fellow, and my good mother taught him\nto cook a steak and--\"\n\n\"Stayed where with the king?\" roared Sapt.\n\n\"Why, at the hunting-lodge, Constable. The king stays there to-night,\nand will ride back tomorrow morning with Herbert. That, madam, is the\nking's message.\"\n\nWe had come to it at last, and it was something to come to. Simon gazed\nfrom face to face. I saw him, and I understood at once that our feelings\nmust be speaking too plainly. So I took on myself to dismiss him,\nsaying:\n\n\"Thanks, Simon, thanks: we understand.\"\n\nHe bowed to the queen; she roused herself, and added her thanks to mine.\nSimon withdrew, looking still a little puzzled.\n\nAfter we were left alone, there was a moment's silence. Then I said:\n\n\"Suppose Rupert--\"\n\nThe Constable of Zenda broke in with a short laugh.\n\n\"On my life,\" said he, \"how things fall out! We say he will go to the\nhunting-lodge, and--he goes!\"\n\n\"If Rupert goes--if Rischenheim doesn't stop him!\" I urged again.\n\nThe queen rose from her seat and stretched out her hands towards us.\n\n\"Gentlemen, my letter!\" said she.\n\nSapt wasted no time.\n\n\"Bernenstein,\" said he, \"you stay here as we arranged. Nothing is\naltered. Horses for Fritz and myself in five minutes.\"\n\nBernenstein turned and shot like an arrow along the terrace towards the\nstables.\n\n\"Nothing is altered, madam,\" said Sapt, \"except that we must be there\nbefore Count Rupert.\"\n\nI looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes past nine. Simon's cursed\nchatter had lost a quarter of an hour. I opened my lips to speak. A\nglance from Sapt's eyes told me that he discerned what I was about to\nsay. I was silent.\n\n\"You'll be in time?\" asked the queen, with clasped hands and frightened\neyes.\n\n\"Assuredly, madam,\" returned Sapt with a bow.\n\n\"You won't let him reach the king?\"\n\n\"Why, no, madam,\" said Sapt with a smile.\n\n\"From my heart, gentlemen,\" she said in a trembling voice, \"from my\nheart--\"\n\n\"Here are the horses,\" cried Sapt. He snatched her hand, brushed it\nwith his grizzly moustache, and--well, I am not sure I heard, and I can\nhardly believe what I think I heard. But I will set it down for what it\nis worth. I think he said, \"Bless your sweet face, we'll do it.\" At any\nrate she drew back with a little cry of surprise, and I saw the tears\nstanding in her eyes. I kissed her hand also; then we mounted, and\nwe started, and we rode, as if the devil were behind us, for the\nhunting-lodge.\n\nBut I turned once to watch her standing on the terrace, with young\nBernenstein's tall figure beside her.\n\n\"Can we be in time?\" said I. It was what I had meant to say before.\n\n\"I think not, but, by God, we'll try,\" said Colonel Sapt. And I knew why\nhe had not let me speak.\n\nSuddenly there was a sound behind us of a horse at the gallop. Our heads\nflew round in the ready apprehension of men on a perilous errand. The\nhoofs drew near, for the unknown rode with reckless haste.\n\n\"We had best see what it is,\" said the constable, pulling up.\n\nA second more, and the horseman was beside us. Sapt swore an oath, half\nin amusement, half in vexation.\n\n\"Why, is it you, James?\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Rudolf Rassendyll's servant.\n\n\"What the devil do you want?\" asked Sapt.\n\n\"I came to attend on the Count von Tarlenheim, sir.\"\n\n\"I did not give you any orders, James.\"\n\n\"No, sir. But Mr. Rassendyll told me not to leave you, unless you sent\nme away. So I made haste to follow you.\"\n\nThen Sapt cried: \"Deuce take it, what horse is that?\"\n\n\"The best in the stables, so far as I could see, sir. I was afraid of\nnot overtaking you.\"\n\nSapt tugged his moustaches, scowled, but finally laughed.\n\n\"Much obliged for your compliment,\" said he. \"The horse is mine.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\" said James with respectful interest.\n\nFor a moment we were all silent. Then Sapt laughed again.\n\n\"Forward!\" said he, and the three of us dashed into the forest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE TEMPER OF BORIS THE HOUND\n\nLooking back now, in the light of the information I have gathered, I am\nable to trace very clearly, and almost hour by hour, the events of this\nday, and to understand how chance, laying hold of our cunning plan and\nmocking our wiliness, twisted and turned our device to a predetermined\nbut undreamt-of issue, of which we were most guiltless in thought or\nintent. Had the king not gone to the hunting-lodge, our design would\nhave found the fulfilment we looked for; had Rischenheim succeeded in\nwarning Rupert of Hentzau, we should have stood where we were. Fate\nor fortune would have it otherwise. The king, being weary, went to the\nlodge, and Rischenheim failed in warning his cousin. It was a narrow\nfailure, for Rupert, as his laugh told me, was in the house in the\nKonigstrasse when I set out from Strelsau, and Rischenheim arrived there\nat half past four. He had taken the train at a roadside station, and\nthus easily outstripped Mr. Rassendyll, who, not daring to show his\nface, was forced to ride all the way and enter the city under cover of\nnight. But Rischenheim had not dared to send a warning, for he knew\nthat we were in possession of the address and did not know what steps\nwe might have taken to intercept messages. Therefore he was obliged to\ncarry the news himself; when he came his man was gone. Indeed Rupert\nmust have left the house almost immediately after I was safe away from\nthe city. He was determined to be in good time for his appointment;\nhis only enemies were not in Strelsau; there was no warrant on which he\ncould be apprehended; and, although his connection with Black Michael\nwas a matter of popular gossip, he felt himself safe from arrest by\nvirtue of the secret that protected him. Accordingly he walked out\nof the house, went to the station, took his ticket to Hofbau, and,\ntraveling by the four o'clock train, reached his destination about\nhalf-past five. He must have passed the train in which Rischenheim\ntraveled; the first news the latter had of his departure was from a\nporter at the station, who, having recognized the Count of Hentzau,\nventured to congratulate Rischenheim on his cousin's return. Rischenheim\nmade no answer, but hurried in great agitation to the house in the\nKonigstrasse, where the old woman Holf confirmed the tidings. Then he\npassed through a period of great irresolution. Loyalty to Rupert urged\nthat he should follow him and share the perils into which his cousin was\nhastening. But caution whispered that he was not irrevocably committed,\nthat nothing overt yet connected him with Rupert's schemes, and that we\nwho knew the truth should be well content to purchase his silence as to\nthe trick we had played by granting him immunity. His fears won the day,\nand, like the irresolute man he was, he determined to wait in Strelsau\ntill he heard the issue of the meeting at the lodge. If Rupert were\ndisposed of there, he had something to offer us in return for peace; if\nhis cousin escaped, he would be in the Konigstrasse, prepared to second\nthe further plans of the desperate adventurer. In any event his skin was\nsafe, and I presume to think that this weighed a little with him; for\nexcuse he had the wound which Bernenstein had given him, and which\nrendered his right arm entirely useless; had he gone then, he would have\nbeen a most inefficient ally.\n\nOf all this we, as we rode through the forest, knew nothing. We might\nguess, conjecture, hope, or fear; but our certain knowledge stopped with\nRischenheim's start for the capital and Rupert's presence there at three\no'clock. The pair might have met or might have missed. We had to act\nas though they had missed and Rupert were gone to meet the king. But we\nwere late. The consciousness of that pressed upon us, although we evaded\nfurther mention of it; it made us spur and drive our horses as quickly,\nay, and a little more quickly, than safety allowed. Once James's horse\nstumbled in the darkness and its rider was thrown; more than once a low\nbough hanging over the path nearly swept me, dead or stunned, from my\nseat. Sapt paid no attention to these mishaps or threatened mishaps. He\nhad taken the lead, and, sitting well down in his saddle, rode ahead,\nturning neither to right nor left, never slackening his pace, sparing\nneither himself nor his beast. James and I were side by side behind him.\nWe rode in silence, finding nothing to say to one another. My mind was\nfull of a picture--the picture of Rupert with his easy smile handing to\nthe king the queen's letter. For the hour of the rendezvous was past.\nIf that image had been translated into reality, what must we do? To kill\nRupert would satisfy revenge, but of what other avail would it be when\nthe king had read the letter? I am ashamed to say that I found myself\ngirding at Mr. Rassendyll for happening on a plan which the course\nof events had turned into a trap for ourselves and not for Rupert of\nHentzau.\n\nSuddenly Sapt, turning his head for the first time, pointed in front\nof him. The lodge was before us; we saw it looming dimly a quarter of\na mile off. Sapt reined in his horse, and we followed his example. All\ndismounted, we tied our horses to trees and went forward at a quick,\nsilent walk. Our idea was that Sapt should enter on pretext of having\nbeen sent by the queen to attend to her husband's comfort and arrange\nfor his return without further fatigue next day. If Rupert had come and\ngone, the king's demeanor would probably betray the fact; if he had not\nyet come, I and James, patrolling outside, would bar his passage. There\nwas a third possibility; he might be even now with the king. Our course\nin such a case we left unsettled; so far as I had any plan, it was to\nkill Rupert and to convince the king that the letter was a forgery--a\ndesperate hope, so desperate that we turned our eyes away from the\npossibility which would make it our only resource.\n\nWe were now very near the hunting-lodge, being about forty yards from\nthe front of it. All at once Sapt threw himself on his stomach on the\nground.\n\n\"Give me a match,\" he whispered.\n\nJames struck a light, and, the night being still, the flame burnt\nbrightly: it showed us the mark of a horse's hoof, apparently quite\nfresh, and leading away from the lodge. We rose and went on, following\nthe tracks by the aid of more matches till we reached a tree twenty\nyards from the door. Here the hoof marks ceased; but beyond there was\na double track of human feet in the soft black earth; a man had gone\nthence to the house and returned from the house thither. On the right of\nthe tree were more hoof-marks, leading up to it and then ceasing. A man\nhad ridden up from the right, dismounted, gone on foot to the house,\nreturned to the tree, remounted, and ridden away along the track by\nwhich we had approached.\n\n\"It may be somebody else,\" said I; but I do not think that we any of\nus doubted in our hearts that the tracks were made by the coming of\nHentzau. Then the king had the letter; the mischief was done. We were\ntoo late.\n\nYet we did not hesitate. Since disaster had come, it must be faced. Mr.\nRassendyll's servant and I followed the constable of Zenda up to\nthe door, or within a few feet of it. Here Sapt, who was in uniform,\nloosened his sword in its sheath; James and I looked to our revolvers.\nThere were no lights visible in the lodge; the door was shut; everything\nwas still. Sapt knocked softly with his knuckles, but there was no\nanswer from within. He laid hold of the handle and turned it; the door\nopened, and the passage lay dark and apparently empty before us.\n\n\"You stay here, as we arranged,\" whispered the colonel. \"Give me the\nmatches, and I'll go in.\"\n\nJames handed him the box of matches, and he crossed the threshold. For a\nyard or two we saw him plainly, then his figure grew dim and indistinct.\nI heard nothing except my own hard breathing. But in a moment there was\nanother sound--a muffled exclamation, and a noise of a man stumbling;\na sword, too, clattered on the stones of the passage. We looked at one\nanother; the noise did not produce any answering stir in the house; then\ncame the sharp little explosion of a match struck on its box; next we\nheard Sapt raising himself, his scabbard scraping along the stones; his\nfootsteps came towards us, and in a second he appeared at the door.\n\n\"What was it?\" I whispered.\n\n\"I fell,\" said Sapt.\n\n\"Over what?\"\n\n\"Come and see. James, stay here.\"\n\nI followed the constable for the distance of eight or ten feet along the\npassage.\n\n\"Isn't there a lamp anywhere?\" I asked.\n\n\"We can see enough with a match,\" he answered. \"Here, this is what I\nfell over.\"\n\nEven before the match was struck I saw a dark body lying across the\npassage.\n\n\"A dead man?\" I guessed instantly.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Sapt, striking a light: \"a dead dog, Fritz.\" An\nexclamation of wonder escaped me as I fell on my knees. At the same\ninstant Sapt muttered, \"Ay, there's a lamp,\" and, stretching up his hand\nto a little oil lamp that stood on a bracket, he lit it, took it down,\nand held it over the body. It served to give a fair, though unsteady,\nlight, and enabled us to see what lay in the passage.\n\n\"It's Boris, the boar-hound,\" said I, still in a whisper, although there\nwas no sign of any listeners.\n\nI knew the dog well; he was the king's favorite, and always accompanied\nhim when he went hunting. He was obedient to every word of the king's,\nbut of a rather uncertain temper towards the rest of the world. However,\nde mortuis nil nisi bonum; there he lay dead in the passage. Sapt put\nhis hand on the beast's head. There was a bullet-hole right through his\nforehead. I nodded, and in my turn pointed to the dog's right shoulder,\nwhich was shattered by another ball.\n\n\"And see here,\" said the constable. \"Have a pull at this.\"\n\nI looked where his hand now was. In the dog's mouth was a piece of gray\ncloth, and on the piece of gray cloth was a horn coat-button. I took\nhold of the cloth and pulled. Boris held on even in death. Sapt drew his\nsword, and, inserting the point of it between the dog's teeth, parted\nthem enough for me to draw out the piece of cloth.\n\n\"You'd better put it in your pocket,\" said the constable. \"Now come\nalong;\" and, holding the lamp in one hand and his sword (which he did\nnot resheathe) in the other, he stepped over the body of the boar-hound,\nand I followed him.\n\nWe were now in front of the door of the room where Rudolf Rassendyll had\nsupped with us on the day of his first coming to Ruritania, and whence\nhe had set out to be crowned in Strelsau. On the right of it was the\nroom where the king slept, and farther along in the same direction the\nkitchen and the cellars. The officer or officers in attendance on the\nking used to sleep on the other side of the dining-room.\n\n\"We must explore, I suppose,\" said Sapt. In spite of his outward\ncalmness, I caught in his voice the ring of excitement rising and\nill-repressed. But at this moment we heard from the passage on our left\n(as we faced the door) a low moan, and then a dragging sound, as if a\nman were crawling along the floor, painfully trailing his limbs after\nhim. Sapt held the lamp in that direction, and we saw Herbert the\nforester, pale-faced and wide-eyed, raised from the ground on his two\nhands, while his legs stretched behind him and his stomach rested on the\nflags.\n\n\"Who is it?\" he said in a faint voice.\n\n\"Why, man, you know us,\" said the constable, stepping up to him. \"What's\nhappened here?\"\n\nThe poor fellow was very faint, and, I think, wandered a little in his\nbrain.\n\n\"I've got it, sir,\" he murmured; \"I've got it, fair and straight. No\nmore hunting for me, sir. I've got it here in the stomach. Oh, my God!\"\nHe let his head fall with a thud on the floor.\n\nI ran and raised him. Kneeling on one knee, I propped his head against\nmy leg.\n\n\"Tell us about it,\" commanded Sapt in a curt, crisp voice while I got\nthe man into the easiest position that I could contrive.\n\nIn slow, struggling tones he began his story, repeating here, omitting\nthere, often confusing the order of his narrative, oftener still\narresting it while he waited for fresh strength. Yet we were not\nimpatient, but heard without a thought of time. I looked round once at\na sound, and found that James, anxious about us, had stolen along the\npassage and joined us. Sapt took no notice of him, nor of anything save\nthe words that dropped in irregular utterance from the stricken man's\nlips. Here is the story, a strange instance of the turning of a great\nevent on a small cause.\n\nThe king had eaten a little supper, and, having gone to his bedroom,\nhad stretched himself on the bed and fallen asleep without undressing.\nHerbert was clearing the dining-table and performing similar duties,\nwhen suddenly (thus he told it) he found a man standing beside him.\nHe did not know (he was new to the king's service) who the unexpected\nvisitor was, but he was of middle height, dark, handsome, and \"looked a\ngentleman all over.\" He was dressed in a shooting-tunic, and a revolver\nwas thrust through the belt of it. One hand rested on the belt, while\nthe other held a small square box.\n\n\"Tell the king I am here. He expects me,\" said the stranger. Herbert,\nalarmed at the suddenness and silence of the stranger's approach, and\nguiltily conscious of having left the door unbolted, drew back. He was\nunarmed, but, being a stout fellow, was prepared to defend his master\nas best he could. Rupert--beyond doubt it was Rupert--laughed lightly,\nsaying again, \"Man, he expects me. Go and tell him,\" and sat himself on\nthe table, swinging his leg. Herbert, influenced by the visitor's air of\ncommand, began to retreat towards the bedroom, keeping his face towards\nRupert.\n\n\"If the king asks more, tell him I have the packet and the letter,\" said\nRupert. The man bowed and passed into the bedroom. The king was asleep;\nwhen roused he seemed to know nothing of letter or packet, and to\nexpect no visitor. Herbert's ready fears revived; he whispered that the\nstranger carried a revolver. Whatever the king's faults might be--and\nGod forbid that I should speak hardly of him whom fate used so\nhardly--he was no coward. He sprang from his bed; at the same moment\nthe great boar-hound uncoiled himself and came from beneath, yawning and\nfawning. But in an instant the beast caught the scent of a stranger: his\nears pricked and he gave a low growl, as he looked up in his master's\nface. Then Rupert of Hentzau, weary perhaps of waiting, perhaps only\ndoubtful whether his message would be properly delivered, appeared in\nthe doorway.\n\nThe king was unarmed, and Herbert in no better plight; their hunting\nweapons were in the adjoining room, and Rupert seemed to bar the way.\nI have said that the king was no coward, yet I think, that the sight of\nRupert, bringing back the memory of his torments in the dungeon, half\ncowed him; for he shrank back crying, \"You!\" The hound, in subtle\nunderstanding of his master's movement, growled angrily.\n\n\"You expected me, sire?\" said Rupert with a bow; but he smiled. I know\nthat the sight of the king's alarm pleased him. To inspire terror was\nhis delight, and it does not come to every man to strike fear into the\nheart of a king and an Elphberg. It had come more than once to Rupert of\nHentzau.\n\n\"No,\" muttered the king. Then, recovering his composure a little, he\nsaid angrily, \"How dare you come here?\"\n\n\"You didn't expect me?\" cried Rupert, and in an instant the thought of a\ntrap seemed to flash across his alert mind. He drew the revolver halfway\nfrom his belt, probably in a scarcely conscious movement, born of the\ndesire to assure himself of its presence. With a cry of alarm Herbert\nflung himself before the king, who sank back on the bed. Rupert,\npuzzled, vexed, yet half-amused (for he smiled still, the man said),\ntook a step forward, crying out something about Rischenheim--what,\nHerbert could not tell us.\n\n\"Keep back,\" exclaimed the king. \"Keep back.\"\n\nRupert paused; then, as though with a sudden thought, he held up the box\nthat was in his left hand, saying:\n\n'\"Well, look at this sire, and we'll talk afterwards,\" and he stretched\nout his hand with the box in it.\n\nNow the king stood on a razor's edge, for the king whispered to Herbert,\n\"What is it? Go and take it.\"\n\nBut Herbert hesitated, fearing to leave the king, whom his body now\nprotected as though with a shield. Rupert's impatience overcame him:\nif there were a trap, every moment's delay doubled his danger. With a\nscornful laugh he exclaimed, \"Catch it, then, if you're afraid to come\nfor it,\" and he flung the packet to Herbert or the king, or which of\nthem might chance to catch it.\n\nThis insolence had a strange result. In an instant, with a fierce growl\nand a mighty bound, Boris was at the stranger's throat. Rupert had not\nseen or had not heeded the dog. A startled oath rang out from him. He\nsnatched the revolver from his belt and fired at his assailant. This\nshot must have broken the beast's shoulder, but it only half arrested\nhis spring. His great weight was still hurled on Rupert's chest, and\nbore him back on his knee. The packet that he had flung lay unheeded.\nThe king, wild with alarm and furious with anger at his favorite's fate,\njumped up and ran past Rupert into the next room. Herbert followed;\neven as they went Rupert flung the wounded, weakened beast from him\nand darted to the doorway. He found himself facing Herbert, who held\na boar-spear, and the king, who had a double-barreled hunting-gun.\nHe raised his left hand, Herbert said--no doubt he still asked a\nhearing--but the king leveled his weapon. With a spring Rupert gained\nthe shelter of the door, the bullet sped by him, and buried itself\nin the wall of the room. Then Herbert was at him with the boar-spear.\nExplanations must wait now: it was life or death; without hesitation\nRupert fired at Herbert, bringing him to the ground with a mortal wound.\nThe king's gun was at his shoulder again.\n\n\"You damned fool!\" roared Rupert, \"if you must have it, take it,\" and\ngun and revolver rang out at the same moment. But Rupert--never did his\nnerve fail him--hit, the king missed; Herbert saw the count stand for\nan instant with his smoking barrel in his hand, looking at the king,\nwho lay on the ground. Then Rupert walked towards the door. I wish I\nhad seen his face then! Did he frown or smile? Was triumph or chagrin\nuppermost? Remorse? Not he!\n\nHe reached the door and passed through. That was the last Herbert saw of\nhim; but the fourth actor in the drama, the wordless player whose part\nhad been so momentous, took the stage. Limping along, now whining in\nsharp agony, now growling in fierce anger, with blood flowing but hair\nbristling, the hound Boris dragged himself across the room, through the\ndoor, after Rupert of Hentzau. Herbert listened, raising his head from\nthe ground. There was a growl, an oath, the sound of the scuffle. Rupert\nmust have turned in time to receive the dog's spring. The beast, maimed\nand crippled by his shattered shoulder, did not reach his enemy's face,\nbut his teeth tore away the bit of cloth that we had found held in the\nvise of his jaws. Then came another shot, a laugh, retreating steps,\nand a door slammed. With that last sound Herbert woke to the fact of the\ncount's escape; with weary efforts he dragged himself into the passage.\nThe idea that he could go on if he got a drink of brandy turned him in\nthe direction of the cellar. But his strength failed, and he sank down\nwhere we found him, not knowing whether the king were dead or still\nalive, and unable even to make his way back to the room where his master\nlay stretched on the ground.\n\nI had listened to the story, bound as though by a spell. Halfway\nthrough, James's hand had crept to my arm and rested there; when Herbert\nfinished I heard the little man licking his lips, again and again\nslapping his tongue against them. Then I looked at Sapt. He was as pale\nas a ghost, and the lines on his face seemed to have grown deeper.\nHe glanced up, and met my regard. Neither of us spoke; we exchanged\nthoughts with our eyes. \"This is our work,\" we said to one another. \"It\nwas our trap, these are our victims.\" I cannot even now think of that\nhour, for by our act the king lay dead.\n\nBut was he dead? I seized Sapt by the arm. His glance questioned me.\n\n\"The king,\" I whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"Yes, the king,\" he returned.\n\nFacing round, we walked to the door of the dining-room. Here I turned\nsuddenly faint, and clutched at the constable. He held me up, and pushed\nthe door wide open. The smell of powder was in the room; it seemed as\nif the smoke hung about, curling in dim coils round the chandelier which\ngave a subdued light. James had the lamp now, and followed us with it.\nBut the king was not there. A sudden hope filled me. He had not been\nkilled then! I regained strength, and darted across towards the inside\nroom. Here too the light was dim, and I turned to beckon for the lamp.\nSapt and James came together, and stood peering over my shoulder in the\ndoorway.\n\nThe king lay prone on the floor, face downwards, near the bed. He had\ncrawled there, seeking for some place to rest, as we supposed. He did\nnot move. We watched him for a moment; the silence seemed deeper\nthan silence could be. At last, moved by a common impulse, we stepped\nforward, but timidly, as though we approached the throne of Death\nhimself. I was the first to kneel by the king and raise his head. Blood\nhad flowed from his lips, but it had ceased to flow now. He was dead.\n\nI felt Sapt's hand on my shoulder. Looking up, I saw his other hand\nstretched out towards the ground. I turned my eyes where he pointed.\nThere, in the king's hand, stained with the king'sblood, was the box\nthat I had carried to Wintenberg and Rupert of Hentzau had brought to\nthe lodge that night. It was not rest, but the box that the dying king\nhad sought in his last moment. I bent, and lifting his hand unclasped\nthe fingers, still limp and warm.\n\nSapt bent down with sudden eagerness. \"Is it open?\" he whispered.\n\nThe string was round it; the sealing-wax was unbroken. The secret\nhad outlived the king, and he had gone to his death unknowing. All\nat once--I cannot tell why--I put my hand over my eyes; I found my\neyelashes were wet.\n\n\"Is it open?\" asked Sapt again, for in the dim light he could not see.\n\n\"No,\" I answered.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said he. And, for Sapt's, the voice was soft.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE KING IN THE HUNTING LODGE\n\nTHE moment with its shock and tumult of feeling brings one judgment,\nlater reflection another. Among the sins of Rupert of Hentzau I do not\nassign the first and greatest place to his killing of the king. It was,\nindeed, the act of a reckless man who stood at nothing and held nothing\nsacred; but when I consider Herbert's story, and trace how the deed came\nto be done and the impulsion of circumstances that led to it, it seems\nto have been in some sort thrust upon him by the same perverse fate that\ndogged our steps. He had meant the king no harm--indeed it may be argued\nthat, from whatever motive, he had sought to serve him--and save under\nthe sudden stress of self-defense he had done him none. The king's\nunlooked-for ignorance of his errand, Herbert's honest hasty zeal, the\ntemper of Boris the hound, had forced on him an act unmeditated and\nutterly against his interest. His whole guilt lay in preferring the\nking's death to his own--a crime perhaps in most men, but hardly\ndeserving a place in Rupert's catalogue. All this I can admit now, but\non that night, with the dead body lying there before us, with the story\npiteously told by Herbert's faltering voice fresh in our ears, it was\nhard to allow any such extenuation. Our hearts cried out for vengeance,\nalthough we ourselves served the king no more. Nay, it may well be that\nwe hoped to stifle some reproach of our own consciences by a louder\nclamor against another's sin, or longed to offer some belated empty\natonement to our dead master by executing swift justice on the man who\nhad killed him. I cannot tell fully what the others felt, but in me at\nleast the dominant impulse was to waste not a moment in proclaiming the\ncrime and raising the whole country in pursuit of Rupert, so that every\nman in Ruritania should quit his work, his pleasure, or his bed, and\nmake it his concern to take the Count of Hentzau, alive or dead. I\nremember that I walked over to where Sapt was sitting, and caught him by\nthe arm, saying:\n\n\"We must raise the alarm. If you'll go to Zenda, I'll start for\nStrelsau.\"\n\n\"The alarm?\" said he, looking up at me and tugging his moustache.\n\n\"Yes: when the news is known, every man in the kingdom will be on the\nlookout for him, and he can't escape.\"\n\n\"So that he'd be taken?\" asked the constable.\n\n\"Yes, to a certainty,\" I cried, hot in excitement and emotion. Sapt\nglanced across at Mr. Rassendyll's servant. James had, with my help,\nraised the king's body on to the bed, and had aided the wounded\nforester to reach a couch. He stood now near the constable, in his\nusual unobtrusive readiness. He did not speak, but I saw a look of\nunderstanding in his eyes as he nodded his head to Colonel Sapt. They\nwere well matched, that pair, hard to move, hard to shake, not to be\nturned from the purpose in their minds and the matter that lay to their\nhands.\n\n\"Yes, he'd probably be taken or killed,\" said Sapt.\n\n\"Then let's do it!\" I cried.\n\n\"With the queen's letter on him,\" said Colonel Sapt.\n\nI had forgotten.\n\n\"We have the box, he has the letter still,\" said Sapt.\n\nI could have laughed even at that moment. He had left the box (whether\nfrom haste or heedlessness or malice, we could not tell), but the letter\nwas on him. Taken alive, he would use that powerful weapon to save his\nlife or satisfy his anger; if it were found on his body, its evidence\nwould speak loud and clear to all the world. Again he was protected by\nhis crime: while he had the letter, he must be kept inviolate from all\nattack except at our own hands. We desired his death, but we must be\nhis body-guard and die in his defense rather than let any other but\nourselves come at him. No open means must be used, and no allies sought.\nAll this rushed to my mind at Sapt's words, and I saw what the constable\nand James had never forgotten. But what to do I could not see. For the\nKing of Ruritania lay dead.\n\nAn hour or more had passed since our discovery, and it was now close on\nmidnight. Had all gone well we ought by this time to have been far on\nour road back to the castle; by this time Rupert must be miles away from\nwhere he had killed the king; already Mr. Rassendyll would be seeking\nhis enemy in Strelsau.\n\n\"But what are we to do about--about that, then?\" I asked, pointing with\nmy finger through the doorway towards the bed.\n\nSapt gave a last tug at his moustache, then crossed his hands on the\nhilt of the sword between his knees, and leant forward in his chair.\n\n\"Nothing, he said,\" looking at my face. \"Until we have the letter,\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But it's impossible!\" I cried.\n\n\"Why, no, Fritz,\" he answered thoughtfully. \"It's not possible yet; it\nmay become so. But if we can catch Rupert in the next day, or even in\nthe next two days, it's not impossible. Only let me have the letter,\nand I'll account for the concealment. What? Is the fact that crimes are\nknown never concealed, for fear of putting the criminal on his guard?\"\n\n\"You'll be able to make a story, sir,\" James put in, with a grave but\nreassuring air.\n\n\"Yes, James, I shall be able to make a story, or your master will make\none for me. But, by God, story or no story, the letter mustn't be found.\nLet them say we killed him ourselves if they like, but--\"\n\nI seized his hand and gripped it.\n\n\"You don't doubt I'm with you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not for a moment, Fritz,\" he answered.\n\n\"Then how can we do it?\"\n\nWe drew nearer together; Sapt and I sat, while James leant over Sapt's\nchair.\n\nThe oil in the lamp was almost exhausted, and the light burnt very dim.\nNow and again poor Herbert, for whom our skill could do nothing, gave a\nslight moan. I am ashamed to remember how little we thought of him, but\ngreat schemes make the actors in them careless of humanity; the life\nof a man goes for nothing against a point in the game. Except for his\ngroans--and they grew fainter and less frequent--our voices alone broke\nthe silence of the little lodge.\n\n\"The queen must know,\" said Sapt. \"Let her stay at Zenda and give\nout that the king is at the lodge for a day or two longer. Then you,\nFritz--for you must ride to the castle at once--and Bernenstein must get\nto Strelsau as quick as you can, and find Rudolf Rassendyll. You three\nought to be able to track young Rupert down and get the letter from him.\nIf he's not in the city, you must catch Rischenheim, and force him\nto say where he is; we know Rischenheim can be persuaded. If Rupert's\nthere, I need give no advice either to you or to Rudolf.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"James and I stay here. If any one comes whom we can keep out, the king\nis ill. If rumors get about, and great folk come, why, they must enter.\"\n\n\"But the body?\"\n\n\"This morning, when you're gone, we shall make a temporary grave. I dare\nsay two,\" and he jerked his thumb towards poor Herbert.\n\n\"Or even,\" he added, with his grim smile, \"three--for our friend Boris,\ntoo, must be out of sight.\"\n\n\"You'll bury the king?\"\n\n\"Not so deep but that we can take him out again, poor fellow. Well,\nFritz, have you a better plan?\"\n\nI had no plan, and I was not in love with Sapt's plan. Yet it offered\nus four and twenty hours. For that time, at least, it seemed as if the\nsecret could be kept. Beyond that we could hardly hope for success;\nafter that we must produce the king; dead or alive, the king must be\nseen. Yet it might be that before the respite ran out Rupert would\nbe ours. In fine, what else could be chosen? For now a greater peril\nthreatened than that against which we had at the first sought to guard.\nThen the worst we feared was that the letter should come to the king's\nhands. That could never be. But it would be a worse thing if it were\nfound on Rupert, and all the kingdom, nay, all Europe, know that it\nwas written in the hand of her who was now, in her own right, Queen of\nRuritania. To save her from that, no chance was too desperate, no scheme\ntoo perilous; yes, if, as Sapt said, we ourselves were held to answer\nfor the king's death, still we must go on. I, through whose negligence\nthe whole train of disaster had been laid, was the last man to hesitate.\nIn all honesty, I held my life due and forfeit, should it be demanded of\nme--my life and, before the world, my honor.\n\nSo the plan was made. A grave was to be dug ready for the king; if need\narose, his body should be laid in it, and the place chosen was under the\nfloor of the wine-cellar. When death came to poor Herbert, he could lie\nin the yard behind the house; for Boris they meditated a resting-place\nunder the tree where our horses were tethered. There was nothing to\nkeep me, and I rose; but as I rose, I heard the forester's voice call\nplaintively for me. The unlucky fellow knew me well, and now cried to\nme to sit by him. I think Sapt wanted me to leave him, but I could not\nrefuse his last request, even though it consumed some precious minutes.\nHe was very near his end, and, sitting by him, I did my best to soothe\nhis passing. His fortitude was good to see, and I believe that we all\nat last found new courage for our enterprise from seeing how this humble\nman met death. At least even the constable ceased to show impatience,\nand let me stay till I could close the sufferer's eyes.\n\nBut thus time went, and it was nearly five in the morning before I bade\nthem farewell and mounted my horse. They took theirs and led them away\nto the stables behind the lodge; I waved my hand and galloped off on my\nreturn to the castle. Day was dawning, and the air was fresh and pure.\nThe new light brought new hope; fears seemed to vanish before it; my\nnerves were strung to effort and to confidence. My horse moved freely\nunder me and carried me easily along the grassy avenues. It was hard\nthen to be utterly despondent, hard to doubt skill of brain, strength of\nhand, or fortune's favor.\n\nThe castle came in sight, and I hailed it with a glad cry that echoed\namong the trees. But a moment later I gave an exclamation of surprise,\nand raised myself a little from the saddle while I gazed earnestly at\nthe summit of the keep. The flag staff was naked; the royal standard\nthat had flapped in the wind last night was gone. But by immemorial\ncustom the flag flew on the keep when the king or the queen was at the\ncastle. It would fly for Rudolf V. no more; but why did it not proclaim\nand honor the presence of Queen Flavia? I sat down in my saddle and\nspurred my horse to the top of his speed. We had been buffeted by fate\nsorely, but now I feared yet another blow.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour more I was at the door. A servant ran out, and\nI dismounted leisurely and easily. Pulling off my gloves, I dusted my\nboots with them, turned to the stableman and bade him look to the horse,\nand then said to the footman:\n\n\"As soon as the queen is dressed, find out if she can see me. I have a\nmessage from his Majesty.\"\n\nThe fellow looked a little puzzled, but at this moment Hermann, the\nking's major-domo, came to the door.\n\n\"Isn't the constable with you, my lord?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, the constable remains at the lodge with the king,\" said I\ncarelessly, though I was very far from careless. \"I have a message for\nher Majesty, Hermann. Find out from some of the women when she will\nreceive me.\"\n\n\"The queen's not here,\" said he. \"Indeed we've had a lively time, my\nlord. At five o'clock she came out, ready dressed, from her room, sent\nfor Lieutenant von Bernenstein, and announced that she was about to set\nout from the castle. As you know, the mail train passes here at six.\"\nHermann took out his watch. \"Yes, the queen must just have left the\nstation.\"\n\n\"Where for?\" I asked, with a shrug for the woman's whim. \"Why, for\nStrelsau. She gave no reasons for going, and took with her only one\nlady, Lieutenant von Bernenstein being in attendance. It was a bustle,\nif you like, with everybody to be roused and got out of bed, and a\ncarriage to be made ready, and messages to go to the station, and--\"\n\n\"She gave no reasons?\"\n\n\"None, my lord. She left with me a letter to the constable, which she\nordered me to give to his own hands as soon as he arrived at the castle.\nShe said it contained a message of importance, which the constable was\nto convey to the king, and that it must be intrusted to nobody except\nColonel Sapt himself. I wonder, my lord, that you didn't notice that the\nflag was hauled down.\"\n\n\"Tut, man, I wasn't staring at the keep. Give me the letter.\" For I saw\nthat the clue to this fresh puzzle must lie under the cover of Sapt's\nletter. That letter I must myself carry to Sapt, and without loss of\ntime.\n\n\"Give you the letter, my lord? But, pardon me, you're not the\nconstable.\" He laughed a little.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said I, mustering a smile. \"It's true that I'm not the\nconstable, but I'm going to the constable. I had the king's orders to\nrejoin him as soon as I had seen the queen, and since her Majesty isn't\nhere, I shall return to the lodge directly a fresh horse can be saddled\nfor me. And the constable's at the lodge. Come, the letter!\"\n\n\"I can't give it you, my lord. Her Majesty's orders were positive.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! If she had known I should come and not the constable, she\nwould have told me to carry it to him.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, my lord: her orders were plain, and she\ndoesn't like being disobeyed.\"\n\nThe stableman had led the horse away, the footman had disappeared,\nHermann and I were alone. \"Give me the letter,\" I said; and I know that\nmy self-control failed, and eagerness was plain in my voice. Plain it\nwas, and Hermann took alarm. He started back, clapping his hand to the\nbreast of his laced coat. The gesture betrayed where the letter was; I\nwas past prudence; I sprang on him and wrenched his hand away, catching\nhim by the throat with my other hand. Diving into his pocket, I got the\nletter. Then I suddenly loosed hold of him, for his eyes were starting\nout of his head. I took out a couple of gold pieces and gave them to\nhim.\n\n\"It's urgent, you fool,\" said I. \"Hold your tongue about it.\" And\nwithout waiting to study his amazed red face, I turned and ran towards\nthe stable. In five minutes I was on a fresh horse, in six I was clear\nof the castle, heading back fast as I could go for the hunting-lodge.\nEven now Hermann remembers the grip I gave him--though doubtless he has\nlong spent the pieces of gold.\n\nWhen I reached the end of this second journey, I came in for the\nobsequies of Boris. James was just patting the ground under the tree\nwith a mattock when I rode up; Sapt was standing by, smoking his pipe.\nThe boots of both were stained and sticky with mud. I flung myself from\nmy saddle and blurted out my news. The constable snatched at his letter\nwith an oath; James leveled the ground with careful accuracy; I do\nnot remember doing anything except wiping my forehead and feeling very\nhungry.\n\n\"Good Lord, she's gone after him!\" said Sapt, as he read. Then he handed\nme the letter.\n\nI will not set out what the queen wrote. The purport seemed to us, who\ndid not share her feelings, pathetic indeed and moving, but in the end\n(to speak plainly) folly. She had tried to endure her sojourn at Zenda,\nshe said; but it drove her mad. She could not rest; she did not know how\nwe fared, nor how those in Strelsau; for hours she had lain awake; then\nat last falling asleep, she had dreamt.\n\n\"I had had the same dream before. Now it came again. I saw him so plain.\nHe seemed to me to be king, and to be called king. But he did not answer\nnor move. He seemed dead; and I could not rest.\" So she wrote, ever\nexcusing herself, ever repeating how something drew her to Strelsau,\ntelling her that she must go if she would see \"him whom you know,\" alive\nagain. \"And I must see him--ah, I must see him! If the king has had the\nletter, I am ruined already. If he has not, tell him what you will or\nwhat you can contrive. I must go. It came a second time, and all so\nplain. I saw him; I tell you I saw him. Ah, I must see him again. I\nswear that I will only see him once. He's in danger--I know he's in\ndanger; or what does the dream mean? Bernenstein will go with me, and I\nshall see him. Do, do forgive me: I can't stay, the dream was so plain.\"\nThus she ended, seeming, poor lady, half frantic with the visions that\nher own troubled brain and desolate heart had conjured up to torment\nher. I did not know that she had before told Mr. Rassendyll himself of\nthis strange dream; though I lay small store by such matters, believing\nthat we ourselves make our dreams, fashioning out of the fears and\nhopes of to-day what seems to come by night in the guise of a mysterious\nrevelation. Yet there are some things that a man cannot understand, and\nI do not profess to measure with my mind the ways of God.\n\nHowever, not why the queen went, but that she had gone, concerned us. We\nhad returned to the house now, and James, remembering that men must eat\nthough kings die, was getting us some breakfast. In fact, I had great\nneed of food, being utterly worn out; and they, after their labors, were\nhardly less weary. As we ate, we talked; and it was plain to us that I\nalso must go to Strelsau. There, in the city, the drama must be played\nout. There was Rudolf, there Rischenheim, there in all likelihood Rupert\nof Hentzau, there now the queen. And of these Rupert alone, or perhaps\nRischenheim also, knew that the king was dead, and how the issue of last\nnight had shaped itself under the compelling hand of wayward fortune.\nThe king lay in peace on his bed, his grave was dug; Sapt and James held\nthe secret with solemn faith and ready lives. To Strelsau I must go\nto tell the queen that she was widowed, and to aim the stroke at young\nRupert's heart.\n\nAt nine in the morning I started from the lodge. I was bound to ride to\nHofbau and there wait for a train which would carry me to the capital.\nFrom Hofbau I could send a message, but the message must announce only\nmy own coming, not the news I carried. To Sapt, thanks to the cipher, I\ncould send word at any time, and he bade me ask Mr. Rassendyll whether\nhe should come to our aid, or stay where he was.\n\n\"A day must decide the whole thing,\" he said. \"We can't conceal the\nking's death long. For God's sake, Fritz, make an end of that young\nvillain, and get the letter.\"\n\nSo, wasting no time in farewells, I set out. By ten o'clock I was at\nHofbau, for I rode furiously. From there I sent to Bernenstein at the\npalace word of my coming. But there I was delayed. There was no train\nfor an hour.\n\n\"I'll ride,\" I cried to myself, only to remember the next moment that,\nif I rode, I should come to my journey's end much later. There was\nnothing for it but to wait, and it may be imagined in what mood I\nwaited. Every minute seemed an hour, and I know not to this day how\nthe hour wore itself away. I ate, I drank, I smoked, I walked, sat, and\nstood. The stationmaster knew me, and thought I had gone mad, till I\ntold him that I carried most important despatches from the king, and\nthat the delay imperiled great interests. Then he became sympathetic;\nbut what could he do? No special train was to be had at a roadside\nstation: I must wait; and wait, somehow, and without blowing my brains\nout, I did.\n\nAt last I was in the train; now indeed we moved, and I came nearer.\nAn hour's run brought me in sight of the city. Then, to my unutterable\nwrath, we were stopped, and waited motionless twenty minutes or half an\nhour. At last we started again; had we not, I should have jumped out\nand run, for to sit longer would have driven me mad. Now we entered the\nstation. With a great effort I calmed myself. I lolled back in my seat;\nwhen we stopped I sat there till a porter opened the door. In lazy\nleisureliness I bade him get me a cab, and followed him across the\nstation. He held the door for me, and, giving him his douceur, I set my\nfoot on the step.\n\n\"Tell him to drive to the palace,\" said I, \"and be quick. I'm late\nalready, thanks to this cursed train.\"\n\n\"The old mare'll soon take you there, sir,\" said the driver. I jumped\nin. But at this moment I saw a man on the platform beckoning with his\nhand and hastening towards me. The cabman also saw him and waited. I\ndared not tell him to drive on, for I feared to betray any undue haste,\nand it would have looked strange not to spare a moment to my wife's\ncousin, Anton von Strofzin. He came up, holding out his hand delicately\ngloved in pearl-gray kid, for young Anton was a leader of the Strelsau\ndandies.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Fritz!\" said he. \"I am glad I hold no appointment at court.\nHow dreadfully active you all are! I thought you were settled at Zenda\nfor a month?\"\n\n\"The queen changed her mind suddenly,\" said I, smiling. \"Ladies do, as\nyou know well, you who know all about them.\"\n\nMy compliment, or insinuation, produced a pleased smile and a gallant\ntwirling of his moustache.\n\n\"Well, I thought you'd be here soon,\" he said, \"but I didn't know that\nthe queen had come.\"\n\n\"You didn't? Then why did you look for me?\"\n\nHe opened his eyes a little in languid, elegant surprise. \"Oh, I\nsupposed you'd be on duty, or something, and have to come. Aren't you in\nattendance?\"\n\n\"On the queen? No, not just now.\"\n\n\"But on the king?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said I, and I leaned forward. \"At least I'm engaged now on\nthe king's business.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said he. \"So I thought you'd come, as soon as I heard that\nthe king was here.\"\n\nIt may be that I ought to have preserved my composure. But I am not Sapt\nnor Rudolf Rassendyll.\n\n\"The king here?\" I gasped, clutching him by the arm.\n\n\"Of course. You didn't know? Yes, he's in town.\"\n\nBut I heeded him no more. For a moment I could not speak, then I cried\nto the cabman:\n\n\"To the palace. And drive like the devil!\"\n\nWe shot away, leaving Anton open-mouthed in wonder. For me, I sank back\non the cushions, fairly aghast. The king lay dead in the hunting-lodge,\nbut the king was in his capital!\n\nOf course, the truth soon flashed through my mind, but it brought no\ncomfort. Rudolf Rassendyll was in Strelsau. He had been seen by somebody\nand taken for the king. But comfort? What comfort was there, now that\nthe king was dead and could never come to the rescue of his counterfeit?\n\nIn fact, the truth was worse than I conceived. Had I known it all, I\nmight well have yielded to despair. For not by the chance, uncertain\nsight of a passer-by, not by mere rumor which might have been sturdily\ndenied, not by the evidence of one only or of two, was the king's\npresence in the city known. That day, by the witness of a crowd of\npeople, by his own claim and his own voice, ay, and by the assent of\nthe queen herself, Mr. Rassendyll was taken to be the king in Strelsau,\nwhile neither he nor Queen Flavia knew that the king was dead. I must\nnow relate the strange and perverse succession of events which forced\nthem to employ a resource so dangerous and face a peril so immense. Yet,\ngreat and perilous as they knew the risk to be even when they dared\nit, in the light of what they did not know it was more fearful and more\nfatal still.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE KING IN STRELSAU\n\nMR. RASSENDYLL reached Strelsau from Zenda without accident about nine\no'clock in the evening of the same day as that which witnessed the\ntragedy of the hunting-lodge. He could have arrived sooner, but prudence\ndid not allow him to enter the populous suburbs of the town till the\ndarkness guarded him from notice. The gates of the city were no longer\nshut at sunset, as they had used to be in the days when Duke Michael\nwas governor, and Rudolf passed them without difficulty. Fortunately the\nnight, fine where we were, was wet and stormy at Strelsau; thus there\nwere few people in the streets, and he was able to gain the door of my\nhouse still unremarked. Here, of course, a danger presented itself.\nNone of my servants were in the secret; only my wife, in whom the queen\nherself had confided, knew Rudolf, and she did not expect to see him,\nsince she was ignorant of the recent course of events. Rudolf was quite\nalive to the peril, and regretted the absence of his faithful attendant,\nwho could have cleared the way for him. The pouring rain gave him an\nexcuse for twisting a scarf about his face and pulling his coat-collar\nup to his ears, while the gusts of wind made the cramming of his hat low\ndown over his eyes no more than a natural precaution against its loss.\nThus masked from curious eyes, he drew rein before my door, and, having\ndismounted, rang the bell. When the butler came a strange hoarse voice,\nhalf-stifled by folds of scarf, asked for the countess, alleging for\npretext a message from myself. The man hesitated, as well he might, to\nleave the stranger alone with the door open and the contents of the hall\nat his mercy. Murmuring an apology in case his visitor should prove to\nbe a gentleman, he shut the door and went in search of his mistress. His\ndescription of the untimely caller at once roused my wife's quick wit;\nshe had heard from me how Rudolf had ridden once from Strelsau to the\nhunting-lodge with muffled face; a very tall man with his face wrapped\nin a scarf and his hat over his eyes, who came with a private message,\nsuggested to her at least a possibility of Mr. Rassendyll's arrival.\nHelga will never admit that she is clever, yet I find she discovers from\nme what she wants to know, and I suspect hides successfully the small\nmatters of which she in her wifely discretion deems I had best remain\nignorant. Being able thus to manage me, she was equal to coping with the\nbutler. She laid aside her embroidery most composedly.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said, \"I know the gentleman. Surely you haven't left him\nout in the rain?\" She was anxious lest Rudolf's features should have\nbeen exposed too long to the light of the hall-lamps.\n\nThe butler stammered an apology, explaining his fears for our goods and\nthe impossibility of distinguishing social rank on a dark night. Helga\ncut him short with an impatient gesture, crying, \"How stupid of you!\"\nand herself ran quickly down and opened the door--a little way only,\nthough. The first sight of Mr. Rassendyll confirmed her suspicions; in a\nmoment, she said, she knew his eyes.\n\n\"It is you, then?\" she cried. \"And my foolish servant has left you in\nthe rain! Pray come in. Oh, but your horse!\" She turned to the penitent\nbutler, who had followed her downstairs. \"Take the baron's horse round\nto the stables,\" she said.\n\n\"I will send some one at once, my lady.\"\n\n\"No, no, take it yourself--take it at once. I'll look after the baron.\"\n\nReluctantly and ruefully the fat fellow stepped out into the storm.\nRudolf drew back and let him pass, then he entered quickly, to find\nhimself alone with Helga in the hall. With a finger on her lips, she led\nhim swiftly into a small sitting-room on the ground floor, which I used\nas a sort of office or place of business. It looked out on the street,\nand the rain could be heard driving against the broad panes of the\nwindow. Rudolf turned to her with a smile, and, bowing, kissed her hand.\n\n\"The baron what, my dear countess?\" he inquired.\n\n\"He won't ask,\" said she with a shrug. \"Do tell me what brings you here,\nand what has happened.\"\n\nHe told her very briefly all he knew. She hid bravely her alarm at\nhearing that I might perhaps meet Rupert at the lodge, and at once\nlistened to what Rudolf wanted of her.\n\n\"Can I get out of the house, and, if need be, back again unnoticed?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"The door is locked at night, and only Fritz and the butler have keys.\"\n\nMr. Rassendyll's eye traveled to the window of the room.\n\n\"I haven't grown so fat that I can't get through there,\" said he. \"So\nwe'd better not trouble the butler. He'd talk, you know.\"\n\n\"I will sit here all night and keep everybody from the room.\"\n\n\"I may come back pursued if I bungle my work and an alarm is raised.\"\n\n\"Your work?\" she asked, shrinking back a little.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"Don't ask what it is, Countess. It is in the queen's\nservice.\"\n\n\"For the queen I will do anything and everything, as Fritz would.\"\n\nHe took her hand and pressed it in a friendly, encouraging way.\n\n\"Then I may issue my orders?\" he asked, smiling.\n\n\"They shall be obeyed.\"\n\n\"Then a dry cloak, a little supper, and this room to myself, except for\nyou.\"\n\nAs he spoke the butler turned the handle of the door. My wife flew\nacross the room, opened the door, and, while Rudolf turned his back,\ndirected the man to bring some cold meat, or whatever could be ready\nwith as little delay as possible.\n\n\"Now come with me,\" she said to Rudolf, directly the servant was gone.\n\nShe took him to my dressing-room, where he got dry clothes; then she saw\nthe supper laid, ordered a bedroom to be prepared, told the butler that\nshe had business with the baron and that he need not sit up if she were\nlater than eleven, dismissed him, and went to tell Rudolf that the\ncoast was clear for his return to the sitting-room. He came, expressing\nadmiration for her courage and address; I take leave to think that\nshe deserved his compliments. He made a hasty supper; then they talked\ntogether, Rudolf smoking his cigar. Eleven came and went. It was not\nyet time. My wife opened the door and looked out. The hall was dark, the\ndoor locked and its key in the hands of the butler. She closed the door\nagain and softly locked it. As the clock struck twelve Rudolf rose and\nturned the lamp very low. Then he unfastened the shutters noiselessly,\nraised the window and looked out.\n\n\"Shut them again when I'm gone,\" he whispered. \"If I come back, I'll\nknock like this, and you'll open for me.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, be careful,\" she murmured, catching at his hand.\n\nHe nodded reassuringly, and crossing his leg over the windowsill, sat\nthere for a moment listening. The storm was as fierce as ever, and the\nstreet was deserted. He let himself down on to the pavement, his face\nagain wrapped up. She watched his tall figure stride quickly along\ntill a turn of the road hid it. Then, having closed the window and the\nshutters again, she sat down to keep her watch, praying for him, for me,\nand for her dear mistress the queen. For she knew that perilous work\nwas afoot that night, and did not know whom it might threaten or whom\ndestroy.\n\nFrom the moment that Mr. Rassendyll thus left my house at midnight on\nhis search for Rupert of Hentzau, every hour and almost every moment\nbrought its incident in the swiftly moving drama which decided the\nissues of our fortune. What we were doing has been told; by now Rupert\nhimself was on his way back to the city, and the queen was meditating,\nin her restless vigil, on the resolve that in a few hours was to bring\nher also to Strelsau. Even in the dead of night both sides were active.\nFor, plan cautiously and skillfully as he might, Rudolf fought with an\nantagonist who lost no chances, and who had found an apt and useful tool\nin that same Bauer, a rascal, and a cunning rascal, if ever one were\nbred in the world. From the beginning even to the end our error lay in\ntaking too little count of this fellow, and dear was the price we paid.\n\nBoth to my wife and to Rudolf himself the street had seemed empty of\nevery living being when she watched and he set out. Yet everything had\nbeen seen, from his first arrival to the moment when she closed the\nwindow after him. At either end of my house there runs out a projection,\nformed by the bay windows of the principal drawing-room and of the\ndining room respectively. These projecting walls form shadows, and in\nthe shade of one of them--of which I do not know, nor is it of moment--a\nman watched all that passed; had he been anywhere else, Rudolf must have\nseen him. If we had not been too engrossed in playing our own hands,\nit would doubtless have struck us as probable that Rupert would direct\nRischenheim and Bauer to keep an eye on my house during his absence;\nfor it was there that any of us who found our way to the city would\nnaturally resort in the first instance. As a fact, he had not omitted\nthis precaution. The night was so dark that the spy, who had seen\nthe king but once and never Mr. Rassendyll, did not recognize who the\nvisitor was, but he rightly conceived that he should serve his employer\nby tracking the steps of the tall man who made so mysterious an arrival\nand so surreptitious a departure from the suspected house. Accordingly,\nas Rudolf turned the corner and Helena closed the window, a short,\nthickset figure started cautiously out of the projecting shadow, and\nfollowed in Rudolf's wake through the storm. The pair, tracker and\ntracked, met nobody, save here and there a police constable keeping\na most unwilling beat. Even such were few, and for the most part more\nintent on sheltering in the lee of a friendly wall and thereby keeping a\ndry stitch or two on them than on taking note of passers-by. On the pair\nwent. Now Rudolf turned into the Konigstrasse. As he did so, Bauer, who\nmust have been nearly a hundred yards behind (for he could not start\ntill the shutters were closed) quickened his pace and reduced the\ninterval between them to about seventy yards. This he might well have\nthought a safe distance on a night so wild, when the rush of wind and\nthe pelt of the rain joined to hide the sound of footsteps.\n\nBut Bauer reasoned as a townsman, and Rudolf Rassendyll had the quick\near of a man bred in the country and trained to the woodland. All at\nonce there was a jerk of his head; I know so well the motion which\nmarked awakened attention in him. He did not pause nor break his stride:\nto do either would have been to betray his suspicions to his follower;\nbut he crossed the road to the opposite side to that where No. 19 was\nsituated, and slackened his pace a little, so that there was a longer\ninterval between his own footfalls. The steps behind him grew slower,\neven as his did; their sound came no nearer: the follower would not\novertake. Now, a man who loiters on such a night, just because another\nhead of him is fool enough to loiter, has a reason for his action other\nthan what can at first sight be detected. So thought Rudolf Rassendyll,\nand his brain was busied with finding it out.\n\nThen an idea seized him, and, forgetting the precautions that had\nhitherto served so well, he came to a sudden stop on the pavement,\nengrossed in deep thought. Was the man who dogged his steps Rupert\nhimself? It would be like Rupert to track him, like Rupert to conceive\nsuch an attack, like Rupert to be ready either for a fearless assault\nfrom the front or a shameless shot from behind, and indifferent utterly\nwhich chance offered, so it threw him one of them. Mr. Rassendyll asked\nno better than to meet his enemy thus in the open. They could fight a\nfair fight, and if he fell the lamp would be caught up and carried on by\nSapt's hand or mine; if he got the better of Rupert, the letter would\nbe his; a moment would destroy it and give safety to the queen. I do not\nsuppose that he spent time in thinking how he should escape arrest at\nthe hands of the police whom the fracas would probably rouse; if he did,\nhe may well have reckoned on declaring plainly who he was, of laughing\nat their surprise over a chance likeness to the king, and of trusting to\nus to smuggle him beyond the arm of the law. What mattered all that, so\nthat there was a moment in which to destroy the letter? At any rate he\nturned full round and began to walk straight towards Bauer, his hand\nresting on the revolver in the pocket of his coat.\n\nBauer saw him coming, and must have known that he was suspected or\ndetected. At once the cunning fellow slouched his head between his\nshoulders, and set out along the street at a quick shuffle, whistling as\nhe went. Rudolf stood still now in the middle of the road, wondering\nwho the man was: whether Rupert, purposely disguising his gait, or\na confederate, or, after all, some person innocent of our secret\nand indifferent to our schemes. On came Bauer, softly, whistling and\nslushing his feet carelessly through the liquid mud. Now he was nearly\nopposite where Mr. Rassendyll stood. Rudolf was well-nigh convinced that\nthe man had been on his track: he would make certainty surer. The bold\ngame was always his choice and his delight; this trait he shared\nwith Rupert of Hentzau, and hence arose, I think, the strange secret\ninclination he had for his unscrupulous opponent. Now he walked suddenly\nacross to Bauer, and spoke to him in his natural voice, at the same time\nremoving the scarf partly, but not altogether, from his face.\n\n\"You're out late, my friend, for a night like this.\"\n\nBauer, startled though he was by the unexpected challenge, had his wits\nabout him. Whether he identified Rudolf at once, I do not know; I think\nthat he must at least have suspected the truth.\n\n\"A lad that has no home to go to must needs be out both late and early,\nsir,\" said he, arresting his shuffling steps, and looking up with that\nhonest stolid air which had made a fool of me.\n\nI had described him very minutely to Mr. Rassendyll; if Bauer knew or\nguessed who his challenger was, Mr. Rassendyll was as well equipped for\nthe encounter.\n\n\"No home to go to!\" cried Rudolf in a pitying tone. \"How's that? But\nanyhow, Heaven forbid that you or any man should walk the streets a\nnight like this. Come, I'll give you a bed. Come with me, and I'll find\nyou good shelter, my boy.\"\n\nBauer shrank away. He did not see the meaning of this stroke, and\nhis eye, traveling up the street, showed that his thoughts had turned\ntowards flight. Rudolf gave no time for putting any such notion into\neffect. Maintaining his air of genial compassion, he passed his left arm\nthrough Bauer's right, saying:\n\n\"I'm a Christian man, and a bed you shall have this night, my lad, as\nsure as I'm alive. Come along with me. The devil, it's not weather for\nstanding still!\"\n\nThe carrying of arms in Strelsau was forbidden. Bauer had no wish to get\ninto trouble with the police, and, moreover, he had intended nothing\nbut a reconnaissance; he was therefore without any weapon, and he was a\nchild in Rudolf's grasp. He had no alternative but to obey the\nsuasion of Mr. Rassendyll's arm, and they two began to walk down the\nKonigstrasse. Bauer's whistle had died away, not to return; but from\ntime to time Rudolf hummed softly a cheerful tune, his fingers beating\ntime on Bauer's captive arm. Presently they crossed the road. Bauer's\nlagging steps indicated that he took no pleasure in the change of side,\nbut he could not resist.\n\n\"Ay, you shall go where I am going, my lad,\" said Rudolf encouragingly;\nand he laughed a little as he looked down at the fellow's face.\n\nAlong they went; soon they came to the small numbers at the station end\nof the Konigstrasse. Rudolf began to peer up at the shop fronts.\n\n\"It's cursed dark,\" said he. \"Pray, lad, can you make out which is\nnineteen?\"\n\nThe moment he had spoken the smile broadened on his face. The shot had\ngone home. Bauer was a clever scoundrel, but his nerves were not under\nperfect control, and his arm had quivered under Rudolf's.\n\n\"Nineteen, sir?\" he stammered.\n\n\"Ay, nineteen. That's where we're bound for, you and I. There I hope we\nshall find--what we want.\"\n\nBauer seemed bewildered: no doubt he was at a loss how either to\nunderstand or to parry the bold attack.\n\n\"Ah, this looks like it,\" said Rudolf, in a tone of great satisfaction,\nas they came to old Mother Holf's little shop. \"Isn't that a one and\na nine over the door, my lad? Ah, and Holf! Yes, that's the name. Pray\nring the bell. My hands are occupied.\"\n\nRudolf's hands were indeed occupied; one held Bauer's arm, now no longer\nwith a friendly pressure, but with a grip of iron; in the other the\ncaptive saw the revolver that had till now lain hidden.\n\n\"You see?\" asked Rudolf pleasantly. \"You must ring for me, mustn't you?\nIt would startle them if I roused them with a shot.\" A motion of the\nbarrel told Bauer the direction which the shot would take.\n\n\"There's no bell,\" said Bauer sullenly.\n\n\"Ah, then you knock?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"In any particular way, my friend?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" growled Bauer.\n\n\"Nor I. Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"No, I know nothing of it.\"\n\n\"Well, we must try. You knock, and--Listen, my lad. You must guess\nright. You understand?\"\n\n\"How can I guess?\" asked Bauer, in an attempt at bluster.\n\n\"Indeed, I don't know,\" smiled Rudolf. \"But I hate waiting, and if the\ndoor is not open in two minutes, I shall arouse the good folk with a\nshot. You see? You quite see, don't you?\" Again the barrel's motion\npointed and explained Mr. Rassendyll's meaning.\n\nUnder this powerful persuasion Bauer yielded. He lifted his hand and\nknocked on the door with his knuckles, first loudly, then very softly,\nthe gentler stroke being repeated five times in rapid succession.\nClearly he was expected, for without any sound of approaching feet the\nchain was unfastened with a subdued rattle. Then came the noise of the\nbolt being cautiously worked back into its socket. As it shot home a\nchink of the door opened. At the same moment Rudolf's hand slipped from\nBauer's arm. With a swift movement he caught the fellow by the nape of\nthe neck and flung him violently forward into the roadway, where, losing\nhis footing, he fell sprawling face downwards in the mud. Rudolf threw\nhimself against the door: it yielded, he was inside, and in an instant\nhe had shut the door and driven the bolt home again, leaving Bauer in\nthe gutter outside. Then he turned, with his hand on the butt of his\nrevolver. I know that he hoped to find Rupert of Hentzau's face within a\nfoot of his.\n\nNeither Rupert nor Rischenheim, nor even the old woman fronted him: a\ntall, handsome, dark girl faced him, holding an oil-lamp in her hand.\nHe did not know her, but I could have told him that she was old Mother\nHolf's youngest child, Rosa, for I had often seen her as I rode through\nthe town of Zenda with the king, before the old lady moved her dwelling\nto Strelsau. Indeed the girl had seemed to haunt the king's foot-steps,\nand he had himself joked on her obvious efforts to attract his\nattention, and the languishing glances of her great black eyes. But it\nis the lot of prominent personages to inspire these strange passions,\nand the king had spent as little thought on her as on any of the\nromantic girls who found a naughty delight in half-fanciful devotion to\nhim--devotion starting, in many cases, by an irony of which the king\nwas happily unconscious, from the brave figure that he made at his\ncoronation and his picturesque daring in the affair of Black Michael.\nThe worshipers never came near enough to perceive the alteration in\ntheir idol.\n\nThe half then, at least, of Rosa's attachment was justly due to the man\nwho now stood opposite to her, looking at her with surprise by the murky\nlight of the strong-smelling oil-lamp. The lamp shook and almost fell\nfrom her hand when she saw him; for the scarf had slid away, and his\nfeatures were exposed to full view. Fright, delight, and excitement vied\nwith one another in her eyes.\n\n\"The king!\" she whispered in amazement. \"No, but--\" And she searched his\nface wonderingly.\n\n\"Is it the beard you miss?\" asked Rudolf, fingering his chin. \"Mayn't\nkings shave when they please, as well as other men?\" Her face still\nexpressed bewilderment, and still a lingering doubt. He bent towards\nher, whispering:\n\n\"Perhaps I wasn't over-anxious to be known at once.\"\n\nShe flushed with pleasure at the confidence he seemed to put in her.\n\n\"I should know you anywhere,\" she whispered, with a glance of the great\nblack eyes. \"Anywhere, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Then you'll help me, perhaps?\"\n\n\"With my life.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear young lady, merely with a little information. Whose\nhome is this?\"\n\n\"My mother's.\"\n\n\"Ah! She takes lodgers?\"\n\nThe girl appeared vexed at his cautious approaches. \"Tell me what you\nwant to know,\" she said simply.\n\n\"Then who's here?\"\n\n\"My lord the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim.\"\n\n\"And what's he doing?\"\n\n\"He's lying on the bed moaning and swearing, because his wounded arm\ngives him pain.\"\n\n\"And is nobody else here?\"\n\nShe looked round warily, and sank her voice to a whisper as she\nanswered:\n\n\"No, not now--nobody else.\"\n\n\"I was seeking a friend of mine,\" said Rudolf. \"I want to see him alone.\nIt's not easy for a king to see people alone.\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"Well, you know whom I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes. No, he's gone; but he's gone to find you.\"\n\n\"To find me! Plague take it! How do you know that, my pretty lady?\"\n\n\"Bauer told me.\"\n\n\"Ah, Bauer! And who's Bauer?\"\n\n\"The man who knocked. Why did you shut him out?\"\n\n\"To be alone with you, to be sure. So Bauer tells you his master's\nsecrets?\"\n\nShe acknowledged his raillery with a coquettish laugh. It was not amiss\nfor the king to see that she had her admirers.\n\n\"Well, and where has this foolish count gone to meet me?\" asked Rudolf\nlightly.\n\n\"You haven't seen him?\"\n\n\"No; I came straight from the Castle of Zenda.\"\n\n\"But,\" she cried, \"he expected to find you at the hunting lodge. Ah, but\nnow I recollect! The Count of Rischenheim was greatly vexed to find, on\nhis return, that his cousin was gone.\"\n\n\"Ah, he was gone! Now I see! Rischenheim brought a message from me to\nCount Rupert.\"\n\n\"And they missed one another, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly, my dear young lady. Very vexatious it is, upon my word!\" In\nthis remark, at least, Rudolf spoke no more and no other than he felt.\n\"But when do you expect the Count of Hentzau?\" he pursued.\n\n\"Early in the morning, your Majesty--at seven or eight.\"\n\nRudolf came nearer to her, and took a couple of gold coins from his\npocket.\n\n\"I don't want money, your Majesty,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Oh, make a hole in them and hang them round your neck.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes: yes, give them to me,\" she cried, holding out her hand\neagerly.\n\n\"You'll earn them?\" he asked, playfully holding them out of her reach.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By being ready to open to me when I come at eleven and knock as Bauer\nknocked.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll be there.\"\n\n\"And by telling nobody that I've been here to-night. Will you promise me\nthat?\"\n\n\"Not my mother?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim?\"\n\n\"Him least of all. You must tell nobody. My business is very private,\nand Rischenheim doesn't know it.\"\n\n\"I'll do all you tell me. But--but Bauer knows.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Rudolf. \"Bauer knows. Well, we'll see about Bauer.\"\n\nAs he spoke he turned towards the door. Suddenly the girl bent, snatched\nat his hand and kissed it.\n\n\"I would die for you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said he gently. I believe he was loath to make profit,\neven in the queen's service, of her poor foolish love. He laid his hand\non the door, but paused a moment to say:\n\n\"If Bauer comes, you have told me nothing. Mind, nothing! I threatened\nyou, but you told me nothing.\"\n\n\"He'll tell them you have been here.\"\n\n\"That can't be helped; at least they won't know when I shall arrive\nagain. Good-night.\"\n\nRudolf opened the door and slipped through, closing it hastily behind\nhim. If Bauer got back to the house, his visit must be known; but if\nhe could intercept Bauer, the girl's silence was assured. He stood just\noutside, listening intently and searching the darkness with eager eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. WHAT THE CHANCELLOR'S WIFE SAW\n\nTHE night, so precious in its silence, solitude, and darkness, was\nwaning fast; soon the first dim approaches of day would be visible; soon\nthe streets would become alive and people be about. Before then Rudolf\nRassendyll, the man who bore a face that he dared not show in open day,\nmust be under cover; else men would say that the king was in Strelsau,\nand the news would flash in a few hours through the kingdom and (so\nRudolf feared) reach even those ears which we knew to be shut to all\nearthly sounds. But there was still some time at Mr. Rassendyll's\ndisposal, and he could not spend it better than in pursuing his fight\nwith Bauer. Taking a leaf out of the rascal's own book, he drew himself\nback into the shadow of the house walls and prepared to wait. At the\nworst he could keep the fellow from communicating with Rischenheim for\na little longer, but his hope was that Bauer would steal back after\na while and reconnoitre with a view to discovering how matters stood,\nwhether the unwelcome visitor had taken his departure and the way to\nRischenheim were open. Wrapping his scarf closely round his face, Rudolf\nwaited, patiently enduring the tedium as he best might, drenched by\nthe rain, which fell steadily, and very imperfectly sheltered from the\nbuffeting of the wind. Minutes went by; there were no signs of Bauer\nnor of anybody else in the silent street. Yet Rudolf did not venture to\nleave his post; Bauer would seize the opportunity to slip in; perhaps\nBauer had seen him come out, and was in his turn waiting till the coast\nshould be clear; or, again, perhaps the useful spy had gone off\nto intercept Rupert of Hentzau, and warn him of the danger in the\nKonigstrasse. Ignorant of the truth and compelled to accept all these\nchances, Rudolf waited, still watching the distant beginnings of dawning\nday, which must soon drive him to his hiding-place again. Meanwhile my\npoor wife waited also, a prey to every fear that a woman's sensitive\nmind can imagine and feed upon.\n\nRudolf turned his head this way and that, seeking always the darker\nblot of shadow that would mean a human being. For a while his search was\nvain, but presently he found what he looked for--ay, and even more. On\nthe same side of the street, to his left hand, from the direction of\nthe station, not one, but three blurred shapes moved up the street.\nThey came stealthily, yet quickly; with caution, but without pause or\nhesitation. Rudolf, scenting danger, flattened himself close against the\nwall and felt for his revolver. Very likely they were only early workers\nor late revelers, but he was ready for something else; he had not\nyet sighted Bauer, and action was to be looked for from the man. By\ninfinitely gradual sidelong slitherings he moved a few paces from the\ndoor of Mother Holf's house, and stood six feet perhaps, or eight, on\nthe right-hand side of it. The three came on. He strained his eyes in\nthe effort to discern their features. In that dim light certainty was\nimpossible, but the one in the middle might well be Bauer: the height,\nthe walk, and the make were much what Bauer's were. If it were Bauer,\nthen Bauer had friends, and Bauer and his friends seemed to be stalking\nsome game. Always most carefully and gradually Rudolf edged yet farther\nfrom the little shop. At a distance of some five yards he halted\nfinally, drew out his revolver, covered the man whom he took to be\nBauer, and thus waited his fortune and his chance.\n\nNow, it was plain that Bauer--for Bauer it was--would look for one of\ntwo things: what he hoped was to find Rudolf still in the house, what he\nfeared was to be told that Rudolf, having fulfilled the unknown purpose\nof his visit, was gone whole and sound. If the latter tidings met him,\nthese two good friends of his whom he had enlisted for his reinforcement\nwere to have five crowns each and go home in peace; if the former, they\nwere to do their work and make ten crowns. Years after, one of them told\nme the whole story without shame or reserve. What their work was, the\nheavy bludgeons they carried and the long knife that one of them had\nlent to Bauer showed pretty clearly.\n\nBut neither to Bauer nor to them did it occur that their quarry might be\ncrouching near, hunting as well as hunted. Not that the pair of ruffians\nwho had been thus hired would have hesitated for that thought, as I\nimagine. For it is strange, yet certain, that the zenith of courage\nand the acme of villainy can alike be bought for the price of a lady's\nglove. Among such outcasts as those from whom Bauer drew his recruits\nthe murder of a man is held serious only when the police are by, and\ndeath at the hands of him they seek to kill is no more than an every-day\nrisk of their employment.\n\n\"Here's the house,\" whispered Bauer, stopping at the door. \"Now, I'll\nknock, and you stand by to knock him on the head if he runs out. He's\ngot a six-shooter, so lose no time.\"\n\n\"He'll only fire it in heaven,\" growled a hoarse, guttural voice that\nended in a chuckle.\n\n\"But if he's gone?\" objected the other auxiliary.\n\n\"Then I know where he's gone,\" answered Bauer. \"Are you ready?\"\n\nA ruffian stood on either side of the door with uplifted bludgeon. Bauer\nraised his hand to knock.\n\nRudolf knew that Rischenheim was within, and he feared that Bauer,\nhearing that the stranger had gone, would take the opportunity of\ntelling the count of his visit. The count would, in his turn, warn\nRupert of Hentzau, and the work of catching the ringleader would all\nfall to be done again. At no time did Mr. Rassendyll take count of odds\nagainst him, but in this instance he may well have thought himself, with\nhis revolver, a match for the three ruffians. At any rate, before Bauer\nhad time to give the signal, he sprang out suddenly from the wall and\ndarted at the fellow. His onset was so sudden that the other two fell\nback a pace; Rudolf caught Bauer fairly by the throat. I do not suppose\nthat he meant to strangle him, but the anger, long stored in his heart,\nfound vent in the fierce grip of his fingers. It is certain that\nBauer thought his time was come, unless he struck a blow for himself.\nInstantly he raised his hand and thrust fiercely at Rudolf with his long\nknife. Mr. Rassendyll would have been a dead man, had he not loosed his\nhold and sprung lightly away. But Bauer sprang at him again, thrusting\nwith the knife, and crying to his associates,\n\n\"Club him, you fools, club him!\"\n\nThus exhorted, one jumped forward. The moment for hesitation had gone.\nIn spite of the noise of wind and pelting rain, the sound of a shot\nrisked much; but not to fire was death. Rudolf fired full at Bauer: the\nfellow saw his intention and tried to leap behind one of his companions;\nhe was just too late, and fell with a groan to the ground.\n\nAgain the other ruffians shrank back, appalled by the sudden ruthless\ndecision of the act. Mr. Rassendyll laughed. A half smothered yet\nuncontrolled oath broke from one of them. \"By God!\" he whispered\nhoarsely, gazing at Rudolf's face and letting his arm fall to his side.\n\"My God!\" he said then, and his mouth hung open. Again Rudolf laughed at\nhis terrified stare.\n\n\"A bigger job than you fancied, is it?\" he asked, pushing his scarf well\naway from his chin.\n\nThe man gaped at him; the other's eyes asked wondering questions, but\nneither did he attempt to resume the attack. The first at last found\nvoice, and he said, \"Well, it'd be damned cheap at ten crowns, and\nthat's the living truth.\"\n\nHis friend--or confederate rather, for such men have no friends--looked\non, still amazed.\n\n\"Take up that fellow by his head and his heels,\" ordered Rudolf.\n\"Quickly! I suppose you don't want the police to find us here with him,\ndo you? Well, no more do I. Lift him up.\"\n\nAs he spoke Rudolf turned to knock at the door of No. 19. But even as he\ndid so Bauer groaned. Dead perhaps he ought to have been, but it seems\nto me that fate is always ready to take the cream and leave the scum.\nHis leap aside had served him well, after all: he had nearly escaped\nscot free. As it was, the bullet, almost missing his head altogether,\nhad just glanced on his temple as it passed; its impact had stunned, but\nnot killed. Friend Bauer was in unusual luck that night; I wouldn't have\ntaken a hundred to one about his chance of life. Rupert arrested his\nhand. It would not do to leave Bauer at the house, if Bauer were likely\nto regain speech. He stood for a moment, considering what to do, but in\nan instant the thoughts that he tried to gather were scattered again.\n\n\"The patrol! the patrol!\" hoarsely whispered the fellow who had not yet\nspoken. There was a sound of the hoofs of horses. Down the street\nfrom the station end there appeared two mounted men. Without a second\nmoment's hesitation the two rascals dropped their friend Bauer with a\nthud on the ground; one ran at his full speed across the street, the\nother bolted no less quickly up the Konigstrasse. Neither could afford\nto meet the constables; and who could say what story this red-haired\ngentleman might tell, ay, or what powers he might command?\n\nBut, in truth, Rudolf gave no thought to either his story or his powers.\nIf he were caught, the best he could hope would be to lie in the lockup\nwhile Rupert played his game unmolested. The device that he had employed\nagainst the amazed ruffians could be used against lawful authority only\nas a last and desperate resort. While he could run, run he would. In an\ninstant he also took to his heels, following the fellow who had darted\nup the Konigstrasse. But before he had gone very far, coming to a narrow\nturning, he shot down it; then he paused for a moment to listen.\n\nThe patrol had seen the sudden dispersal of the group, and, struck with\nnatural suspicion, quickened pace. A few minutes brought them where\nBauer was. They jumped from their horses and ran to him. He was\nunconscious, and could, of course, give them no account of how he came\nto be in his present state. The fronts of all the houses were dark, the\ndoors shut; there was nothing to connect the man stretched on the ground\nwith either No. 19 or any other dwelling. Moreover, the constables were\nnot sure that the sufferer was himself a meritorious object, for his\nhand still held a long, ugly knife. They were perplexed: they were but\ntwo; there was a wounded man to look after; there were three men to\npursue, and the three had fled in three separate directions. They looked\nup at No. 19; No. 19 remained dark, quiet, absolutely indifferent. The\nfugitives were out of sight. Rudolf Rassendyll, hearing nothing, had\nstarted again on his way. But a minute later he heard a shrill whistle.\nThe patrol were summoning assistance; the man must be carried to the\nstation, and a report made; but other constables might be warned of what\nhad happened, and despatched in pursuit of the culprits. Rudolf heard\nmore than one answering whistle; he broke into a run, looking for a\nturning on the left that would take him back into the direction of my\nhouse, but he found none. The narrow street twisted and curved in the\nbewildering way that characterizes the old parts of the town. Rudolf\nhad spent some time once in Strelsau; but a king learns little of back\nstreets, and he was soon fairly puzzled as to his whereabouts. Day was\ndawning, and he began to meet people here and there. He dared run no\nmore, even had his breath lasted him; winding the scarf about his face,\nand cramming his hat over his forehead again, he fell into an easy walk,\nwondering whether he could venture to ask his way, relieved to find no\nsigns that he was being pursued, trying to persuade himself that Bauer,\nthough not dead, was at least incapable of embarrassing disclosures;\nabove all, conscious of the danger of his tell-tale face, and of the\nnecessity of finding some shelter before the city was all stirring and\nawake.\n\nAt this moment he heard horses' hoofs behind him. He was now at the\nend of the street, where it opened on the square in which the barracks\nstand. He knew his bearings now, and, had he not been interrupted,\ncould have been back to safe shelter in my house in twenty minutes. But,\nlooking back, he saw the figure of a mounted constable just coming into\nsight behind him. The man seemed to see Rudolf, for he broke into a\nquick trot. Mr. Rassendyll's position was critical; this fact alone\naccounts for the dangerous step into which he allowed himself to\nbe forced. Here he was, a man unable to give account of himself, of\nremarkable appearance, and carrying a revolver, of which one barrel was\ndischarged. And there was Bauer, a wounded man, shot by somebody with\na revolver, a quarter of an hour before. Even to be questioned was\ndangerous; to be detained meant ruin to the great business that engaged\nhis energies. For all he knew, the patrol had actually sighted him as\nhe ran. His fears were not vain; for the constable raised his voice,\ncrying, \"Hi, sir--you there--stop a minute!\"\n\nResistance was the one thing worse than to yield. Wit, and not force,\nmust find escape this time. Rudolf stopped, looking round again with a\nsurprised air. Then he drew himself up with an assumption of dignity,\nand waited for the constable. If that last card must be played, he would\nwin the hand with it.\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" he asked coldly, when the man was a few yards\nfrom him; and, as he spoke, he withdrew the scarf almost entirely\nfrom his features, keeping it only over his chin. \"You call very\nperemptorily,\" he continued, staring contemptuously. \"What's your\nbusiness with me?\"\n\nWith a violent start, the sergeant--for such the star on his collar and\nthe lace on his cuff proclaimed him--leant forward in the saddle to look\nat the man whom he had hailed. Rudolf said nothing and did not move.\nThe man's eyes studied his face intently. Then he sat bolt upright and\nsaluted, his face dyed to a deep red in his sudden confusion.\n\n\"And why do you salute me now?\" asked Rudolf in a mocking tone. \"First\nyou hunt me, then you salute me. By Heaven, I don't know why you put\nyourself out at all about me!\"\n\n\"I--I--\" the fellow stuttered. Then trying a fresh start, he stammered,\n\"Your Majesty, I didn't know--I didn't suppose--\"\n\nRudolf stepped towards him with a quick, decisive tread.\n\n\"And why do you call me 'Your Majesty'?\" he asked, still mockingly.\n\n\"It--it--isn't it your Majesty?\"\n\nRudolf was close by him now, his hand on the horse's neck.\n\nHe looked up into the sergeant's face with steady eyes, saying:\n\n\"You make a mistake, my friend. I am not the king.\"\n\n\"You are not--?\" stuttered the bewildered fellow.\n\n\"By no means. And, sergeant--?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Sir, you mean.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"A zealous officer, sergeant, can make no greater mistake than to\ntake for the king a gentleman who is not the king. It might injure his\nprospects, since the king, not being here, mightn't wish to have it\nsupposed that he was here. Do you follow me, sergeant?\"\n\nThe man said nothing, but stared hard. After a moment Rudolf continued:\n\n\"In such a case,\" said he, \"a discreet officer would not trouble the\ngentleman any more, and would be very careful not to mention that he\nhad made such a silly mistake. Indeed, if questioned, he would answer\nwithout hesitation that he hadn't seen anybody even like the king, much\nless the king himself.\"\n\nA doubtful, puzzled little smile spread under the sergeant's moustache.\n\n\"You see, the king is not even in Strelsau,\" said Rudolf.\n\n\"Not in Strelsau, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, no, he's at Zenda.\"\n\n\"Ah! At Zenda, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It is therefore impossible--physically impossible--that he\nshould be here.\"\n\nThe fellow was convinced that he understood now.\n\n\"It's certainly impossible, sir,\" said he, smiling more broadly.\n\n\"Absolutely. And therefore impossible also that you should have seen\nhim.\" With this Rudolf took a gold piece from his pocket and handed it\nto the sergeant. The fellow took it with something like a wink.\n\n\"As for you, you've searched here and found nobody,\" concluded Mr.\nRassendyll. \"So hadn't you better at once search somewhere else?\n\n\"Without doubt, sir,\" said the sergeant, and with the most deferential\nsalute, and another confidential smile, he turned and rode back by the\nway he had come. No doubt he wished that he could meet a gentleman who\nwas--not the king--every morning of his life. It hardly need be said\nthat all idea of connecting the gentleman with the crime committed in\nthe Konigstrasse had vanished from his mind. Thus Rudolf won freedom\nfrom the man's interference, but at a dangerous cost--how dangerous he\ndid not know. It was indeed most impossible that the king could be in\nStrelsau.\n\nHe lost no time now in turning his steps towards his refuge. It was past\nfive o'clock, day came quickly, and the streets began to be peopled\nby men and women on their way to open stalls or to buy in the market.\nRudolf crossed the square at a rapid walk, for he was afraid of the\nsoldiers who were gathering for early duty opposite to the barracks.\nFortunately he passed by them unobserved, and gained the comparative\nseclusion of the street in which my house stands, without encountering\nany further difficulties. In truth, he was almost in safety; but bad\nluck was now to have its turn. When Mr. Rassendyll was no more than\nfifty yards from my door, a carriage suddenly drove up and stopped a few\npaces in front of him. The footman sprang down and opened the door. Two\nladies got out; they were dressed in evening costume, and were returning\nfrom a ball. One was middle-aged, the other young and rather pretty.\nThey stood for a moment on the pavement, the younger saying:\n\n\"Isn't it pleasant, mother? I wish I could always be up at five\no'clock.\"\n\n\"My dear, you wouldn't like it for long,\" answered the elder. \"It's very\nnice for a change, but--\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly. Her eye had fallen on Rudolf Rassendyll. He knew\nher: she was no less a person than the wife of Helsing the chancellor;\nhis was the house at which the carriage had stopped. The trick that had\nserved with the sergeant of police would not do now. She knew the king\ntoo well to believe that she could be mistaken about him; she was too\nmuch of a busybody to be content to pretend that she was mistaken.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" she whispered loudly, and, catching her daughter's arm,\nshe murmured, \"Heavens, my dear, it's the king!\"\n\nRudolf was caught. Not only the ladies, but their servants were looking\nat him.\n\nFlight was impossible. He walked by them. The ladies curtseyed, the\nservants bowed bare-headed. Rudolf touched his hat and bowed slightly in\nreturn. He walked straight on towards my house; they were watching him,\nand he knew it. Most heartily did he curse the untimely hours to which\nfolks keep up their dancing, but he thought that a visit to my house\nwould afford as plausible an excuse for his presence as any other. So\nhe went on, surveyed by the wondering ladies, and by the servants who,\nsmothering smiles, asked one another what brought his Majesty abroad in\nsuch a plight (for Rudolf's clothes were soaked and his boots muddy), at\nsuch an hour--and that in Strelsau, when all the world thought he was at\nZenda.\n\nRudolf reached my house. Knowing that he was watched he had abandoned\nall intention of giving the signal agreed on between my wife and himself\nand of making his way in through the window. Such a sight would indeed\nhave given the excellent Baroness von Helsing matter for gossip! It\nwas better to let every servant in my house see his open entrance. But,\nalas, virtue itself sometimes leads to ruin. My dearest Helga, sleepless\nand watchful in the interest of her mistress, was even now behind the\nshutter, listening with all her ears and peering through the chinks.\nNo sooner did Rudolf's footsteps become audible than she cautiously\nunfastened the shutter, opened the window, put her pretty head out, and\ncalled softly: \"All's safe! Come in!\"\n\nThe mischief was done then, for the faces of Helsing's wife and\ndaughter, ay, and the faces of Helsing's servants, were intent on this\nmost strange spectacle. Rudolf, turning his head over his shoulder, saw\nthem; a moment later poor Helga saw them also. Innocent and untrained\nin controlling her feelings, she gave a shrill little cry of dismay, and\nhastily drew back. Rudolf looked round again. The ladies had retreated\nto the cover of the porch, but he still saw their eager faces peering\nfrom between the pillars that supported it.\n\n\"I may as well go in now,\" said Rudolf, and in he sprang. There was\na merry smile on his face as he ran forward to meet Helga, who leant\nagainst the table, pale and agitated.\n\n\"They saw you?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said he. Then his sense of amusement conquered everything\nelse, and he sat down in a chair, laughing.\n\n\"I'd give my life,\" said he, \"to hear the story that the chancellor will\nbe waked up to hear in a minute or two from now!\"\n\nBut a moment's thought made him grave again. For whether he were the\nking or Rudolf Rassendyll, he knew that my wife's name was in equal\nperil. Knowing this, he stood at nothing to serve her. He turned to her\nand spoke quickly.\n\n\"You must rouse one of the servants at once. Send him round to the\nchancellor's and tell the chancellor to come here directly. No, write a\nnote. Say the king has come by appointment to see Fritz on some private\nbusiness, but that Fritz has not kept the appointment, and that the king\nmust now see the chancellor at once. Say there's not a moment to lose.\"\n\nShe was looking at him with wondering eyes.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" he said, \"if I can impose on Helsing, I may stop those\nwomen's tongues? If nothing's done, how long do you suppose it'll be\nbefore all Strelsau knows that Fritz von Tarlenheim's wife let the king\nin at the window at five o'clock in the morning?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" murmured poor Helga in bewilderment.\n\n\"No, my dear lady, but for Heaven's sake do what I ask of you. It's the\nonly chance now.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" she said, and sat down to write.\n\nThus it was that, hard on the marvelous tidings which, as I conjecture,\nthe Baroness von Helsing poured into her husband's drowsy ears, came an\nimperative summons that the chancellor should wait on the king at the\nhouse of Fritz von Tarlenheim.\n\nTruly we had tempted fate too far by bringing Rudolf Rassendyll again to\nStrelsau.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. BEFORE THEM ALL!\n\nGREAT as was the risk and immense as were the difficulties created by\nthe course which Mr. Rassendyll adopted, I cannot doubt that he acted\nfor the best in the light of the information which he possessed. His\nplan was to disclose himself in the character of the king to Helsing,\nto bind him to secrecy, and make him impose the same obligation on his\nwife, daughter, and servants. The chancellor was to be quieted with the\nexcuse of urgent business, and conciliated by a promise that he should\nknow its nature in the course of a few hours; meanwhile an appeal to his\nloyalty must suffice to insure obedience. If all went well in the day\nthat had now dawned, by the evening of it the letter would be destroyed,\nthe queen's peril past, and Rudolf once more far away from Strelsau.\nThen enough of the truth--no more--must be disclosed. Helsing would be\ntold the story of Rudolf Rassendyll and persuaded to hold his tongue\nabout the harum-scarum Englishman (we are ready to believe much of\nan Englishman) having been audacious enough again to play the king in\nStrelsau. The old chancellor was a very good fellow, and I do not think\nthat Rudolf did wrong in relying upon him. Where he miscalculated was,\nof course, just where he was ignorant. The whole of what the queen's\nfriends, ay, and the queen herself, did in Strelsau, became useless and\nmischievous by reason of the king's death; their action must have been\nutterly different, had they been aware of that catastrophe; but their\nwisdom must be judged only according to their knowledge.\n\nIn the first place, the chancellor himself showed much good sense. Even\nbefore he obeyed the king's summons he sent for the two servants and\ncharged them, on pain of instant dismissal and worse things to follow,\nto say nothing of what they had seen. His commands to his wife and\ndaughter were more polite, doubtless, but no less peremptory. He may\nwell have supposed that the king's business was private as well as\nimportant when it led his Majesty to be roaming the streets of Strelsau\nat a moment when he was supposed to be at the Castle of Zenda, and to\nenter a friend's house by the window at such untimely hours. The mere\nfacts were eloquent of secrecy. Moreover, the king had shaved his\nbeard--the ladies were sure of it--and this, again, though it might be\nmerely an accidental coincidence, was also capable of signifying a very\nurgent desire to be unknown. So the chancellor, having given his orders,\nand being himself aflame with the liveliest curiosity, lost no time in\nobeying the king's commands, and arrived at my house before six o'clock.\n\nWhen the visitor was announced Rudolf was upstairs, having a bath and\nsome breakfast. Helga had learnt her lesson well enough to entertain the\nvisitor until Rudolf appeared. She was full of apologies for my absence,\nprotesting that she could in no way explain it; neither could she so\nmuch as conjecture what was the king's business with her husband. She\nplayed the dutiful wife whose virtue was obedience, whose greatest sin\nwould be an indiscreet prying into what it was not her part to know.\n\n\"I know no more,\" she said, \"than that Fritz wrote to me to expect the\nking and him at about five o'clock, and to be ready to let them in by\nthe window, as the king did not wish the servants to be aware of his\npresence.\"\n\nThe king came and greeted Helsing most graciously. The tragedy and\ncomedy of these busy days were strangely mingled; even now I can hardly\nhelp smiling when I picture Rudolf, with grave lips, but that distant\ntwinkle in his eye (I swear he enjoyed the sport), sitting down by the\nold chancellor in the darkest corner of the room, covering him with\nflattery, hinting at most strange things, deploring a secret obstacle to\nimmediate confidence, promising that to-morrow, at latest, he would seek\nthe advice of the wisest and most tried of his counselors, appealing\nto the chancellor's loyalty to trust him till then. Helsing, blinking\nthrough his spectacles, followed with devout attention the long\nnarrative that told nothing, and the urgent exhortation that masked a\ntrick. His accents were almost broken with emotion as he put himself\nabsolutely at the king's disposal, and declared that he could answer for\nthe discretion of his family and household as completely as for his own.\n\n\"Then you're a very lucky man, my dear chancellor,\" said Rudolf, with\na sigh which seemed to hint that the king in his palace was not so\nfortunate. Helsing was immensely pleased. He was all agog to go and tell\nhis wife how entirely the king trusted to her honor and silence.\n\nThere was nothing that Rudolf more desired than to be relieved of\nthe excellent old fellow's presence; but, well aware of the supreme\nimportance of keeping him in a good temper, he would not hear of his\ndeparture for a few minutes.\n\n\"At any rate, the ladies won't talk till after breakfast, and since they\ngot home only at five o'clock they won't breakfast yet awhile,\" said he.\n\nSo he made Helsing sit down, and talked to him. Rudolf had not failed to\nnotice that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim had been a little surprised\nat the sound of his voice; in this conversation he studiously kept his\ntones low, affecting a certain weakness and huskiness such as he had\ndetected in the king's utterances, as he listened behind the curtain\nin Sapt's room at the castle. The part was played as completely and\ntriumphantly as in the old days when he ran the gauntlet of every eye in\nStrelsau. Yet if he had not taken such pains to conciliate old Helsing,\nbut had let him depart, he might not have found himself driven to a\ngreater and even more hazardous deception.\n\nThey were conversing together alone. My wife had been prevailed on by\nRudolf to lie down in her room for an hour. Sorely needing rest, she\nhad obeyed him, having first given strict orders that no member of the\nhousehold should enter the room where the two were except on an express\nsummons. Fearing suspicion, she and Rudolf had agreed that it was better\nto rely on these injunctions than to lock the door again as they had the\nnight before.\n\nBut while these things passed at my house, the queen and Bernenstein\nwere on their way to Strelsau. Perhaps, had Sapt been at Zenda, his\npowerful influence might have availed to check the impulsive expedition;\nBernenstein had no such authority, and could only obey the queen's\nperemptory orders and pathetic prayers. Ever since Rudolf Rassendyll\nleft her, three years before, she had lived in stern self-repression,\nnever her true self, never for a moment able to be or to do what every\nhour her heart urged on her. How are these things done? I doubt if a\nman lives who could do them; but women live who do them. Now his sudden\ncoming, and the train of stirring events that accompanied it, his danger\nand hers, his words and her enjoyment of his presence, had all worked\ntogether to shatter her self-control; and the strange dream, heightening\nthe emotion which was its own cause, left her with no conscious desire\nsave to be near Mr. Rassendyll, and scarcely with a fear except for his\nsafety. As they journeyed her talk was all of his peril, never of the\ndisaster which threatened herself, and which we were all striving\nwith might and main to avert from her head. She traveled alone with\nBernenstein, getting rid of the lady who attended her by some careless\npretext, and she urged on him continually to bring her as speedily as\nmight be to Mr. Rassendyll. I cannot find much blame for her. Rudolf\nstood for all the joy in her life, and Rudolf had gone to fight with the\nCount of Hentzau. What wonder that she saw him, as it were, dead? Yet\nstill she would have it that, in his seeming death, all men hailed him\nfor their king. Well, it was her love that crowned him.\n\nAs they reached the city, she grew more composed, being persuaded by\nBernenstein that nothing in her bearing must rouse suspicion. Yet she\nwas none the less resolved to seek Mr. Rassendyll at once. In truth, she\nfeared even then to find him dead, so strong was the hold of her\ndream on her; until she knew that he was alive she could not rest.\nBernenstein, fearful that the strain would kill her, or rob her of\nreason, promised everything; and declared, with a confidence which he\ndid not feel, that beyond doubt Mr. Rassendyll was alive and well.\n\n\"But where--where?\" she cried eagerly, with clasped hands.\n\n\"We're most likely, madam, to find him at Fritz von Tarlenheim's,\"\nanswered the lieutenant. \"He would wait there till the time came to\nattack Rupert, or, if the thing is over, he will have returned there.\"\n\n\"Then let us drive there at once,\" she urged.\n\nBernenstein, however, persuaded her to go to the palace first and let it\nbe known there that she was going to pay a visit to my wife. She arrived\nat the palace at eight o'clock, took a cup of chocolate, and then\nordered her carriage. Bernenstein alone accompanied her when she set out\nfor my house about nine. He was, by now, hardly less agitated than the\nqueen herself.\n\nIn her entire preoccupation with Mr. Rassendyll, she gave little thought\nto what might have happened at the hunting lodge; but Bernenstein drew\ngloomy auguries from the failure of Sapt and myself to return at the\nproper time. Either evil had befallen us, or the letter had reached the\nking before we arrived at the lodge; the probabilities seemed to him to\nbe confined to these alternatives. Yet when he spoke in this strain to\nthe queen, he could get from her nothing except, \"If we can find Mr.\nRassendyll, he will tell us what to do.\"\n\nThus, then, a little after nine in the morning the queen's carriage\ndrove up to my door. The ladies of the chancellor's family had enjoyed a\nvery short night's rest, for their heads came bobbing out of window the\nmoment the wheels were heard; many people were about now, and the crown\non the panels attracted the usual small crowd of loiterers. Bernenstein\nsprang out and gave his hand to the queen. With a hasty slight bow to\nthe onlookers, she hastened up the two or three steps of the porch,\nand with her own hand rang the bell. Inside, the carriage had just been\nobserved. My wife's waiting-maid ran hastily to her mistress; Helga was\nlying on her bed; she rose at once, and after a few moments of necessary\npreparations (or such preparations as seem to ladies necessary, however\ngreat the need of haste may be) hurried downstairs to receive her\nMajesty--and to warn her Majesty. She was too late. The door was already\nopen. The butler and the footman both had run to it, and thrown it open\nfor the queen. As Helga reached the foot of the stairs, her Majesty was\njust entering the room where Rudolf was, the servants attending her, and\nBernenstein standing behind, his helmet in his hand.\n\nRudolf and the chancellor had been continuing their conversation. To\navoid the observations of passers-by (for the interior of the room is\neasy to see from the street), the blind had been drawn down, and the\nroom was in deep shadow. They had heard the wheels, but neither of them\ndreamt that the visitor could be the queen. It was an utter surprise to\nthem when, without their orders, the door was suddenly flung open. The\nchancellor, slow of movement, and not, if I may say it, over-quick of\nbrain, sat in his corner for half a minute or more before he rose to his\nfeet. On the other hand, Rudolf Rassendyll was the best part of the way\nacross the room in an instant. Helga was at the door now, and she thrust\nher head round young Bernenstein's broad shoulders. Thus she saw\nwhat happened. The queen, forgetting the servants, and not observing\nHelsing--seeming indeed to stay for nothing, and to think of nothing,\nbut to have her thoughts and heart filled with the sight of the man she\nloved and the knowledge of his safety--met him as he ran towards her,\nand, before Helga, or Bernenstein, or Rudolf himself, could stay her or\nconceive what she was about to do, caught both his hands in hers with an\nintense grasp, crying:\n\n\"Rudolf, you're safe! Thank God, oh, thank God!\" and she carried his\nhands to her lips and kissed them passionately.\n\nA moment of absolute silence followed, dictated in the servants by\ndecorum, in the chancellor by consideration, in Helga and Bernenstein\nby utter consternation. Rudolf himself also was silent, but whether\nfrom bewilderment or an emotion answering to hers, I know not. Either it\nmight well be. The stillness struck her. She looked up in his eyes; she\nlooked round the room and saw Helsing, now bowing profoundly from the\ncorner; she turned her head with a sudden frightened jerk, and glanced\nat my motionless deferential servants. Then it came upon her what she\nhad done. She gave a quick gasp for breath, and her face, always pale,\nwent white as marble. Her features set in a strange stiffness, and\nsuddenly she reeled where she stood, and fell forward. Only Rudolf's\nhand bore her up. Thus for a moment, too short to reckon, they stood.\nThen he, a smile of great love and pity coming on his lips, drew her\nto him, and passing his arm about her waist, thus supported her. Then,\nsmiling still, he looked down on her, and said in a low tone, yet\ndistinct enough for all to hear:\n\n\"All is well, dearest.\"\n\nMy wife gripped Bernenstein's arm, and he turned to find her pale-faced\ntoo, with quivering lips and shining eyes. But the eyes had a message,\nand an urgent one, for him. He read it; he knew that it bade him second\nwhat Rudolf Rassendyll had done. He came forward and approached Rudolf;\nthen he fell on one knee, and kissed Rudolf's left hand that was\nextended to him.\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you, Lieutenant von Bernenstein,\" said Rudolf\nRassendyll.\n\nFor a moment the thing was done, ruin averted, and safety secured.\nEverything had been at stake; that there was such a man as Rudolf\nRassendyll might have been disclosed; that he had once filled the king's\nthrone was a high secret which they were prepared to trust to Helsing\nunder stress of necessity; but there remained something which must be\nhidden at all costs, and which the queen's passionate exclamation had\nthreatened to expose. There was a Rudolf Rassendyll, and he had been\nking; but, more than all this, the queen loved him and he the queen.\nThat could be told to none, not even to Helsing; for Helsing, though he\nwould not gossip to the town, would yet hold himself bound to carry\nthe matter to the king. So Rudolf chose to take any future difficulties\nrather than that present and certain disaster. Sooner than entail it on\nher he loved, he claimed for himself the place of her husband and the\nname of king. And she, clutching at the only chance that her act left,\nwas content to have it so. It may be that for an instant her weary,\ntortured brain found sweet rest in the dim dream that so it was, for\nshe let her head lie there on his breast and her eyes closed, her face\nlooking very peaceful, and a soft little sigh escaping in pleasure from\nher lips.\n\nBut every moment bore its peril and exacted its effort. Rudolf led the\nqueen to a couch, and then briefly charged the servants not to speak of\nhis presence for a few hours. As they had no doubt perceived, said he,\nfrom the queen's agitation, important business was on foot; it demanded\nhis presence in Strelsau, but required also that his presence should not\nbe known. A short time would free them from the obligation which he now\nasked of their loyalty. When they had withdrawn, bowing obedience, he\nturned to Helsing, pressed his hand warmly, reiterated his request for\nsilence, and said that he would summon the chancellor to his presence\nagain later in the day, either where he was or at the palace. Then he\nbade all withdraw and leave him alone for a little with the queen. He\nwas obeyed; but Helsing had hardly left the house when Rudolf called\nBernenstein back, and with him my wife. Helga hastened to the queen, who\nwas still sorely agitated; Rudolf drew Bernenstein aside, and exchanged\nwith him all their news. Mr. Rassendyll was much disturbed at finding\nthat no tidings had come from Colonel Sapt and myself, but his\napprehension was greatly increased on learning the untoward accident by\nwhich the king himself had been at the lodge the night before. Indeed,\nhe was utterly in the dark; where the king was, where Rupert, where we\nwere, he did not know. And he was here in Strelsau, known as the king to\nhalf a dozen people or more, protected only by their promises, liable at\nany moment to be exposed by the coming of the king himself, or even by a\nmessage from him.\n\nYet, in face of all perplexities, perhaps even the more because of the\ndarkness in which he was enveloped, Rudolf held firm to his purpose.\nThere were two things that seemed plain. If Rupert had escaped the trap\nand was still alive with the letter on him, Rupert must be found; here\nwas the first task. That accomplished, there remained for Rudolf himself\nnothing save to disappear as quietly and secretly as he had come,\ntrusting that his presence could be concealed from the man whose name\nhe had usurped. Nay, if need were, the king must be told that Rudolf\nRassendyll had played a trick on the chancellor, and, having enjoyed his\npleasure, was gone again. Everything could, in the last resort, be told,\nsave that which touched the queen's honor.\n\nAt this moment the message which I despatched from the station at Hofbau\nreached my house. There was a knock at the door. Bernenstein opened it\nand took the telegram, which was addressed to my wife. I had written all\nthat I dared to trust to such a means of communication, and here it is:\n\n\"I am coming to Strelsau. The king will not leave the lodge to-day. The\ncount came, but left before we arrived. I do not know whether he has\ngone to Strelsau. He gave no news to the king.\"\n\n\"Then they didn't get him!\" cried Bernenstein in deep disappointment.\n\n\"No, but he gave no news to the king,\" said Rudolf triumphantly.\n\nThey were all standing now round the queen, who sat on the couch. She\nseemed very faint and weary, but at peace. It was enough for her that\nRudolf fought and planned for her.\n\n\"And see this,\" Rudolf went on. \"'The king will not leave the lodge\nto-day.' Thank God, then, we have to-day!\"\n\n\"Yes, but where's Rupert?\"\n\n\"We shall know in an hour, if he's in Strelsau,\" and Mr. Rassendyll\nlooked as though it would please him well to find Rupert in Strelsau.\n\"Yes, I must seek him. I shall stand at nothing to find him. If I can\nonly get to him as the king, then I'll be the king. We have to-day!\"\n\nMy message put them in heart again, although it left so much still\nunexplained. Rudolf turned to the queen.\n\n\"Courage, my queen,\" said he. \"A few hours now will see an end of all\nour dangers.\"\n\n\"And then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Then you'll be safe and at rest,\" said he, bending over her and\nspeaking softly. \"And I shall be proud in the knowledge of having saved\nyou.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I must go,\" Helga heard him whisper as he bent lower still, and she and\nBernenstein moved away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A KING UP HIS SLEEVE\n\nThe tall handsome girl was taking down the shutters from the shop front\nat No. 19 in the Konigstrasse. She went about her work languidly enough,\nbut there was a tinge of dusky red on her cheeks and her eyes were\nbrightened by some suppressed excitement. Old Mother Holf, leaning\nagainst the counter, was grumbling angrily because Bauer did not come.\nNow it was not likely that Bauer would come just yet, for he was still\nin the infirmary attached to the police-cells, where a couple of doctors\nwere very busy setting him on his legs again. The old woman knew nothing\nof this, but only that he had gone the night before to reconnoitre;\nwhere he was to play the spy she did not know, on whom perhaps she\nguessed.\n\n\"You're sure he never came back?\" she asked her daughter.\n\n\"He never came back that I saw,\" answered the girl. \"And I was on the\nwatch with my lamp here in the shop till it grew light.\"\n\n\"He's twelve hours gone now, and never a message! Ay, and Count Rupert\nshould be here soon, and he'll be in a fine taking if Bauer's not back.\"\n\nThe girl made no answer; she had finished her task and stood in the\ndoorway, looking out on the street. It was past eight, and many people\nwere about, still for the most part humble folk; the more comfortably\nplaced would not be moving for an hour or two yet. In the road the\ntraffic consisted chiefly of country carts and wagons, bringing in\nproduce for the day's victualling of the great city. The girl watched\nthe stream, but her thoughts were occupied with the stately gentleman\nwho had come to her by night and asked a service of her. She had heard\nthe revolver shot outside; as it sounded she had blown out her lamp, and\nthere behind the door in the dark had heard the swiftly retreating feet\nof the fugitives and, a little later, the arrival of the patrol. Well,\nthe patrol would not dare to touch the king; as for Bauer, let him be\nalive or dead: what cared she, who was the king's servant, able to help\nthe king against his enemies? If Bauer were the king's enemy, right glad\nwould she be to hear that the rogue was dead. How finely the king had\ncaught him by the neck and thrown him out! She laughed to think how\nlittle her mother knew the company she had kept that night.\n\nThe row of country carts moved slowly by. One or two stopped before the\nshop, and the carters offered vegetables for sale. The old woman would\nhave nothing to say to them, but waved them on irritably. Three had thus\nstopped and again proceeded, and an impatient grumble broke from the old\nlady as a fourth, a covered wagon, drew up before the door.\n\n\"We don't want anything: go on, go on with you!\" she cried shrilly.\n\nThe carter got down from his seat without heeding her, and walked round\nto the back.\n\n\"Here you are, sir,\" he cried. \"Nineteen, Konigstrasse.\"\n\nA yawn was heard, and the long sigh a man gives as he stretches himself\nin the mingled luxury and pain of an awakening after sound refreshing\nsleep.\n\n\"All right; I'll get down,\" came in answer from inside.\n\n\"Ah, it's the count!\" said the old lady to her daughter in satisfied\ntones. \"What will he say, though, about that rogue Bauer?\"\n\nRupert of Hentzau put his head out from under the wagon-tilt, looked up\nand down the street, gave the carter a couple of crowns, leapt down, and\nran lightly across the pavement into the little shop. The wagon moved\non.\n\n\"A lucky thing I met him,\" said Rupert cheerily. \"The wagon hid me very\nwell; and handsome as my face is, I can't let Strelsau enjoy too much of\nit just now. Well, mother, what cheer? And you, my pretty, how goes it\nwith you?\" He carelessly brushed the girl's cheek with the glove that\nhe had drawn off. \"Faith, though, I beg your pardon.\" he added a moment\nlater, \"the glove's not clean enough for that,\" and he looked at his\nbuff glove, which was stained with patches of dull rusty brown.\n\n\"It's all as when you left, Count Rupert,\" said Mother Holf, \"except\nthat that rascal Bauer went out last night--\"\n\n\"That's right enough. But hasn't he returned?\"\n\n\"No, not yet.\"\n\n\"Hum. No signs of--anybody else?\" His look defined the vague question.\n\nThe old woman shook her head. The girl turned away to hide a smile.\n\"Anybody else\" meant the king, so she suspected. Well, they should hear\nnothing from her. The king himself had charged her to be silent.\n\n\"But Rischenheim has come, I suppose?\" pursued Rupert.\n\n\"Oh, yes; he came, my lord, soon after you went. He wears his arm in a\nsling.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Rupert in sudden excitement. \"As I guessed! The devil! If\nonly I could do everything myself, and not have to trust to fools and\nbunglers! Where's the count?\"\n\n\"Why, in the attic. You know the way.\"\n\n\"True. But I want some breakfast, mother.\"\n\n\"Rosa shall serve you at once, my lord.\"\n\nThe girl followed Rupert up the narrow crazy staircase of the tall old\nhouse. They passed three floors, all uninhabited; a last steep flight\nthat brought them right under the deep arched roof. Rupert opened a door\nthat stood at the top of the stairs, and, followed still by Rosa with\nher mysterious happy smile, entered a long narrow room. The ceiling,\nhigh in the centre, sloped rapidly down on either side, so that at door\nand window it was little more than six feet above the floor. There was\nan oak table and a few chairs; a couple of iron bedsteads stood by the\nwall near the window. One was empty; the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim lay\non the other, fully dressed, his right arm supported in a sling of black\nsilk. Rupert paused on the threshold, smiling at his cousin; the girl\npassed on to a high press or cupboard, and, opening it, took out plates,\nglasses, and the other furniture of the table. Rischenheim sprang up and\nran across the room.\n\n\"What news?\" he cried eagerly. \"You escaped them, Rupert?\"\n\n\"It appears so,\" said Rupert airily; and, advancing into the room, he\nthrew himself into a chair, tossing his hat on to the table.\n\n\"It appears that I escaped, although some fool's stupidity nearly made\nan end of me.\" Rischenheim flushed.\n\n\"I'll tell you about that directly,\" he said, glancing at the girl who\nhad put some cold meat and a bottle of wine on the table, and was\nnow completing the preparations for Rupert's meal in a very leisurely\nfashion.\n\n\"Had I nothing to do but to look at pretty faces--which, by Heaven,\nI wish heartily were the case--I would beg you to stay,\" said Rupert,\nrising and making her a profound bow.\n\n\"I've no wish to hear what doesn't concern me,\" she retorted scornfully.\n\n\"What a rare and blessed disposition!\" said he, holding the door for her\nand bowing again.\n\n\"I know what I know,\" she cried to him triumphantly from the landing.\n\"Maybe you'd give something to know it too, Count Rupert!\"\n\n\"It's very likely, for, by Heaven, girls know wonderful things!\" smiled\nRupert; but he shut the door and came quickly back to the table, now\nfrowning again. \"Come, tell me, how did they make a fool of you, or why\ndid you make a fool of me, cousin?\"\n\nWhile Rischenheim related how he had been trapped and tricked at the\nCastle of Zenda, Rupert of Hentzau made a very good breakfast. He\noffered no interruption and no comments, but when Rudolf Rassendyll came\ninto the story he looked up for an instant with a quick jerk of his head\nand a sudden light in his eyes. The end of Rischenheim's narrative found\nhim tolerant and smiling again.\n\n\"Ah, well, the snare was cleverly set,\" he said. \"I don't wonder you\nfell into it.\"\n\n\"And now you? What happened to you?\" asked Rischenheim eagerly.\n\n\"I? Why, having your message which was not your message, I obeyed your\ndirections which were not your directions.\"\n\n\"You went to the lodge?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And you found Sapt there?--Anybody else?\"\n\n\"Why, not Sapt at all.\"\n\n\"Not Sapt? But surely they laid a trap for you?\"\n\n\"Very possibly, but the jaws didn't bite.\" Rupert crossed his legs and\nlit a cigarette.\n\n\"But what did you find?\"\n\n\"I? I found the king's forester, and the king's boar-hound, and--well, I\nfound the king himself, too.\"\n\n\"The king at the lodge?\"\n\n\"You weren't so wrong as you thought, were you?\"\n\n\"But surely Sapt, or Bernenstein, or some one was with him?\"\n\n\"As I tell you, his forester and his boar-hound. No other man or beast,\non my honor.\"\n\n\"Then you gave him the letter?\" cried Rischenheim, trembling with\nexcitement.\n\n\"Alas, no, my dear cousin. I threw the box at him, but I don't think he\nhad time to open it. We didn't get to that stage of the conversation at\nwhich I had intended to produce the letter.\"\n\n\"But why not--why not?\"\n\nRupert rose to his feet, and, coming just opposite to where Rischenheim\nsat, balanced himself on his heels, and looked down at his cousin,\nblowing the ash from his cigarette and smiling pleasantly.\n\n\"Have you noticed,\" he asked, \"that my coat's torn?\"\n\n\"I see it is.\"\n\n\"Yes. The boar-hound tried to bite me, cousin. And the forester would\nhave stabbed me. And--well, the king wanted to shoot me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! For God's sake, what happened?\"\n\n\"Well, they none of them did what they wanted. That's what happened,\ndear cousin.\"\n\nRischenheim was staring at him now with wide-opened eyes. Rupert smiled\ndown on him composedly.\n\n\"Because, you see,\" he added, \"Heaven helped me. So that, my dear\ncousin, the dog will bite no more, and the forester will stab no more.\nSurely the country is well rid of them?\"\n\nA silence followed. Then Rischenheim, leaning forward, said in a low\nwhisper, as though afraid to hear his own question:\n\n\"And the king?\"\n\n\"The king? Well, the king will shoot no more.\"\n\nFor a moment Rischenheim, still leaning forward, gazed at his cousin.\nThen he sank slowly back into his chair.\n\n\"My God!\" he murmured: \"my God!\"\n\n\"The king was a fool,\" said Rupert. \"Come, I'll tell you a little more\nabout it.\" He drew a chair up and seated himself in it.\n\nWhile he talked Rischenheim seemed hardly to listen. The story gained in\neffect from the contrast of Rupert's airy telling; his companion's pale\nface and twitching hands tickled his fancy to more shameless jesting.\nBut when he had finished, he gave a pull to his small smartly-curled\nmoustache and said with a sudden gravity:\n\n\"After all, though, it's a serious matter.\"\n\nRischenheim was appalled at the issue. His cousin's influence had been\nstrong enough to lead him into the affair of the letter; he was aghast\nto think how Rupert's reckless dare-deviltry had led on from stage to\nstage till the death of a king seemed but an incident in his schemes. He\nsprang suddenly to his feet, crying:\n\n\"But we must fly--we must fly!\"\n\n\"No, we needn't fly. Perhaps we'd better go, but we needn't fly.\"\n\n\"But when it becomes known?\" He broke off and then cried:\n\n\"Why did you tell me? Why did you come back here?\"\n\n\"Well, I told you because it was interesting, and I came back here\nbecause I had no money to go elsewhere.\"\n\n\"I would have sent money.\"\n\n\"I find that I get more when I ask in person. Besides, is everything\nfinished?\"\n\n\"I'll have no more to do with it.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear cousin, you despond too soon. The good king has unhappily\ngone from us, but we still have our dear queen. We have also, by the\nkindness of Heaven, our dear queen's letter.\"\n\n\"I'll have no more to do with it.\"\n\n\"Your neck feeling--?\" Rupert delicately imitated the putting of a noose\nabout a man's throat.\n\nRischenheim rose suddenly and flung the window open wide.\n\n\"I'm suffocated,\" he muttered with a sullen frown, avoiding Rupert's\neyes.\n\n\"Where's Rudolf Rassendyll?\" asked Rupert. \"Have you heard of him?\"\n\n\"No, I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"We must find that out, I think.\"\n\nRischenheim turned abruptly on him.\n\n\"I had no hand in this thing,\" he said, \"and I'll have no more to do\nwith it. I was not there. What did I know of the king being there? I'm\nnot guilty of it: on my soul, I know nothing of it.\"\n\n\"That's all very true,\" nodded Rupert.\n\n\"Rupert,\" cried he, \"let me go, let me alone. If you want money, I'll\ngive it to you. For God's sake take it, and get out of Strelsau!\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed to beg, my dear cousin, but in fact I want a little money\nuntil I can contrive to realize my valuable property. Is it safe, I\nwonder? Ah, yes, here it is.\"\n\nHe drew from his inner pocket the queen's letter. \"Now if the king\nhadn't been a fool!\" he murmured regretfully, as he regarded it.\n\nThen he walked across to the window and looked out; he could not himself\nbe seen from the street, and nobody was visible at the windows opposite.\nMen and women passed to and fro on their daily labors or pleasures;\nthere was no unusual stir in the city. Looking over the roofs, Rupert\ncould see the royal standard floating in the wind over the palace and\nthe barracks. He took out his watch; Rischenheim imitated his action; it\nwas ten minutes to ten.\n\n\"Rischenheim,\" he called, \"come here a moment. Here--look out.\"\n\nRischenheim obeyed, and Rupert let him look for a minute or two before\nspeaking again.\n\n\"Do you see anything remarkable?\" he asked then.\n\n\"No, nothing,\" answered Rischenheim, still curt and sullen in his\nfright.\n\n\"Well, no more do I. And that's very odd. For don't you think that Sapt\nor some other of her Majesty's friends must have gone to the lodge last\nnight?\"\n\n\"They meant to, I swear,\" said Rischenheim with sudden attention.\n\n\"Then they would have found the king. There's a telegraph wire at\nHofbau, only a few miles away. And it's ten o'clock. My cousin, why\nisn't Strelsau mourning for our lamented king? Why aren't the flags at\nhalf-mast? I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"No,\" murmured Rischenheim, his eyes now fixed on his cousin's face.\n\nRupert broke into a smile and tapped his teeth with his fingers.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he meditatively, \"if that old player Sapt has got a\nking up his sleeve again! If that were so--\" He stopped and seemed to\nfall into deep thought. Rischenheim did not interrupt him, but stood\nlooking now at him, now out of the window. Still there was no stir in\nthe streets, and still the standards floated at the summit of the flag\nstaffs. The king's death was not yet known in Strelsau.\n\n\"Where's Bauer?\" asked Rupert suddenly. \"Where the plague can Bauer be?\nHe was my eyes. Here we are, cooped up, and I don't know what's going\non.\"\n\n\"I don't know where he is. Something must have happened to him.\"\n\n\"Of course, my wise cousin. But what?\"\n\nRupert began to pace up and down the room, smoking another cigarette at\na great pace. Rischenheim sat down by the table, resting his head on\nhis hand. He was wearied out by strain and excitement, his wounded arm\npained him greatly, and he was full of horror and remorse at the event\nwhich happened unknown to him the night before.\n\n\"I wish I was quit of it,\" he moaned at last. Rupert stopped before him.\n\n\"You repent of your misdeeds?\" he asked. \"Well, then, you shall be\nallowed to repent. Nay, you shall go and tell the king that you repent.\nRischenheim, I must know what they are doing. You must go and ask an\naudience of the king.\"\n\n\"But the king is--\"\n\n\"We shall know that better when you've asked for your audience. See\nhere.\"\n\nRupert sat down by his cousin and instructed him in his task. This was\nno other than to discover whether there were a king in Strelsau, or\nwhether the only king lay dead in the hunting lodge. If there were no\nattempt being made to conceal the king's death, Rupert's plan was to\nseek safety in flight. He did not abandon his designs: from the secure\nvantage of foreign soil he would hold the queen's letter over her head,\nand by the threat of publishing it insure at once immunity for himself\nand almost any further terms which he chose to exact from her. If, on\nthe other hand, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim found a king in Strelsau,\nif the royal standards continued to wave at the summit of their flag\nstaffs, and Strelsau knew nothing of the dead man in the lodge, then\nRupert had laid his hand on another secret; for he knew who the king in\nStrelsau must be. Starting from this point, his audacious mind darted\nforward to new and bolder schemes. He could offer again to Rudolf\nRassendyll what he had offered once before, three years ago--a\npartnership in crime and the profits of crime--or if this advance were\nrefused, then he declared that he would himself descend openly into the\nstreets of Strelsau and proclaim the death of the king from the steps of\nthe cathedral.\n\n\"Who can tell,\" he cried, springing up, enraptured and merry with the\ninspiration of his plan, \"who can tell whether Sapt or I came first to\nthe lodge? Who found the king alive, Sapt or I? Who left him dead, Sapt\nor I? Who had most interest in killing him--I, who only sought to make\nhim aware of what touched his honor, or Sapt, who was and is hand and\nglove with the man that now robs him of his name and usurps his place\nwhile his body is still warm? Ah, they haven't done with Rupert of\nHentzau yet!\"\n\nHe stopped, looking down on his companion. Rischenheim's fingers still\ntwitched nervously and his cheeks were pale. But now his face was alight\nwith interest and eagerness. Again the fascination of Rupert's audacity\nand the infection of his courage caught on his kinsman's weaker nature,\nand inspired him to a temporary emulation of the will that dominated\nhim.\n\n\"You see,\" pursued Rupert, \"it's not likely that they'll do you any\nharm.\"\n\n\"I'll risk anything.\"\n\n\"Most gallant gentleman! At the worst they'll only keep you a prisoner.\nWell, if you're not back in a couple of hours, I shall draw my\nconclusions. I shall know that there's a king in Strelsau.\"\n\n\"But where shall I look for the king?\"\n\n\"Why, first in the palace, and secondly at Fritz von Tarlenheim's. I\nexpect you'll find him at Fritz's, though.\"\n\n\"Shall I go there first, then?\"\n\n\"No. That would be seeming to know too much.\"\n\n\"You'll wait here?\"\n\n\"Certainly, cousin--unless I see cause to move, you know.\"\n\n\"And I shall find you on my return?\"\n\n\"Me, or directions from me. By the way, bring money too. There's never\nany harm in having a full pocket. I wonder what the devil does without a\nbreeches-pocket?\"\n\nRischenheim let that curious speculation alone, although he remembered\nthe whimsical air with which Rupert delivered it. He was now on fire to\nbe gone, his ill-balanced brain leaping from the depths of despondency\nto the certainty of brilliant success, and not heeding the gulf of\ndanger that it surpassed in buoyant fancy.\n\n\"We shall have them in a corner, Rupert,\" he cried.\n\n\"Ay, perhaps. But wild beasts in a corner bite hard.\"\n\n\"I wish my arm were well!\"\n\n\"You'll be safer with it wounded,\" said Rupert with a smile.\n\n\"By God, Rupert, I can defend myself.\"\n\n\"True, true; but it's your brain I want now, cousin.\"\n\n\"You shall see that I have something in me.\"\n\n\"If it please God, dear cousin.\"\n\nWith every mocking encouragement and every careless taunt Rischenheim's\nresolve to prove himself a man grew stronger. He snatched up a revolver\nthat lay on the mantelpiece and put it in his pocket.\n\n\"Don't fire, if you can help it,\" advised Rupert. Rischenheim's answer\nwas to make for the door at a great speed. Rupert watched him go, and\nthen returned to the window. The last his cousin saw was his figure\nstanding straight and lithe against the light, while he looked out\non the city. Still there was no stir in the streets, still the royal\nstandard floated at the top of the flag staffs.\n\nRischenheim plunged down the stairs: his feet were too slow for his\neagerness. At the bottom he found the girl Rosa sweeping the passage\nwith great apparent diligence.\n\n\"You're going out, my lord?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why, yes; I have business. Pray stand on one side, this passage is so\ncursedly narrow.\"\n\nRosa showed no haste in moving.\n\n\"And the Count Rupert, is he going out also?\" she asked.\n\n\"You see he's not with me. He'll wait.\" Rischenheim broke off and asked\nangrily: \"What business is it of yours, girl? Get out of the way!\"\n\nShe moved aside now, making him no answer. He rushed past; she looked\nafter him with a smile of triumph. Then she fell again to her sweeping.\nThe king had bidden her be ready at eleven. It was half-past ten. Soon\nthe king would have need of her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE NEWS COMES TO STRELSAU\n\nON leaving No. 19, Rischenheim walked swiftly some little way up the\nKonigstrasse and then hailed a cab. He had hardly raised his hand when\nhe heard his name called, and, looking round, saw Anton von Strofzin's\nsmart phaeton pulling up beside him. Anton was driving, and on the other\nseat was a large nosegay of choice flowers.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" cried Anton, leaning forward with a gay smile.\n\n\"Well, where are you? To a lady's, I presume, from your bouquet there,\"\nanswered Rischenheim as lightly as he could.\n\n\"The little bunch of flowers,\" simpered young Anton, \"is a cousinly\noffering to Helga von Tarlenheim, and I'm going to present it. Can I\ngive you a lift anywhere?\"'\n\nAlthough Rischenheim had intended to go first to the palace, Anton's\noffer seemed to give him a good excuse for drawing the more likely\ncovert first.\n\n\"I was going to the palace to find out where the king is. I want to see\nhim, if he'll give me a minute or two,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I'll drive you there afterwards. Jump up. That your cab? Here you are,\ncabman,\" and flinging the cabman a crown, he displaced the bouquet and\nmade room for Rischenheim beside him.\n\nAnton's horses, of which he was not a little proud, made short work of\nthe distance to my home. The phaeton rattled up to the door and both\nyoung men got out. The moment of their arrival found the chancellor just\nleaving to return to his own home. Helsing knew them both, and stopped\nto rally Anton on the matter of his bouquet. Anton was famous for his\nbouquets, which he distributed widely among the ladies of Strelsau.\n\n\"I hoped it was for my daughter,\" said the chancellor slyly. \"For I love\nflowers, and my wife has ceased to provide me with them; moreover, I've\nceased to provide her with them, so, but for my daughter, we should have\nnone.\"\n\nAnton answered his chaff, promising a bouquet for the young lady the\nnext day, but declaring that he could not disappoint his cousin. He\nwas interrupted by Rischenheim, who, looking round on the group of\nbystanders, now grown numerous, exclaimed: \"What's going on here, my\ndear chancellor? What are all these people hanging about here for? Ah,\nthat's a royal carriage!\"\n\n\"The queen's with the countess,\" answered Helsing. \"The people are\nwaiting to see her come out.\"\n\n\"She's always worth seeing,\" Anton pronounced, sticking his glass in his\neye.\n\n\"And you've been to visit her?\" pursued Rischenheim.\n\n\"Why, yes. I--I went to pay my respects, my dear Rischenheim.\"\n\n\"An early visit!\"\n\n\"It was more or less on business.\"\n\n\"Ah, I have business also, and very important business. But it's with\nthe king.\"\n\n\"I won't keep you a moment, Rischenheim,\" called Anton, as, bouquet in\nhand, he knocked at the door.\n\n\"With the king?\" said Helsing. \"Ah, yes, but the king--\"\n\n\"I'm on my way to the palace to find out where he is. If I can't see\nhim, I must write at once. My business is very urgent.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my dear count, indeed! Dear me! Urgent, you say?\"\n\n\"But perhaps you can help me. Is he at Zenda?\"\n\nThe chancellor was becoming very embarrassed; Anton had disappeared into\nthe house; Rischenheim buttonholed him resolutely.\n\n\"At Zenda? Well, now, I don't--Excuse me, but what's your business?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, my dear chancellor; it's a secret.\"\n\n\"I have the king's confidence.\"\n\n\"Then you'll be indifferent to not enjoying mine,\" smiled Rischenheim.\n\n\"I perceive that your arm is hurt,\" observed the chancellor, seeking a\ndiversion.\n\n\"Between ourselves, that has something to do with my business. Well, I\nmust go to the palace. Or--stay--would her Majesty condescend to help\nme? I think I'll risk a request. She can but refuse,\" and so saying\nRischenheim approached the door.\n\n\"Oh, my friend, I wouldn't do that,\" cried Helsing, darting after him.\n\"The queen is--well, very much engaged. She won't like to be troubled.\"\n\nRischenheim took no notice of him, but knocked loudly. The door was\nopened, and he told the butler to carry his name to the queen and beg a\nmoment's speech with her. Helsing stood in perplexity on the step. The\ncrowd was delighted with the coming of these great folk and showed no\nsign of dispersing. Anton von Strofzin did not reappear. Rischenheim\nedged himself inside the doorway and stood on the threshold of the hall.\nThere he heard voices proceeding from the sitting-room on the left. He\nrecognized the queen's, my wife's, and Anton's. Then came the butler's,\nsaying, \"I will inform the count of your Majesty's wishes.\"\n\nThe door of the room opened; the butler appeared, and immediately behind\nhim Anton von Strofzin and Bernenstein. Bernenstein had the young fellow\nby the arm, and hurried him through the hall. They passed the butler,\nwho made way for them, and came to where Rischenheim stood.\n\n\"We meet again,\" said Rischenheim with a bow.\n\nThe chancellor rubbed his hands in nervous perturbation. The butler\nstepped up and delivered his message: the queen regretted her inability\nto receive the count. Rischenheim nodded, and, standing so that the door\ncould not be shut, asked Bernenstein whether he knew where the king was.\n\nNow Bernenstein was most anxious to get the pair of them away and the\ndoor shut, but he dared show no eagerness.\n\n\"Do you want another interview with the king already?\" he asked with a\nsmile. \"The last was so pleasant, then?\"\n\nRischenheim took no notice of the taunt, but observed sarcastically:\n\"There's a strange difficulty in finding our good king. The chancellor\nhere doesn't know where he is, or at least he won't answer my\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Possibly the king has his reasons for not wishing to be disturbed,\"\nsuggested Bernenstein.\n\n\"It's very possible,\" retorted Rischenheim significantly.\n\n\"Meanwhile, my dear count, I shall take it as a personal favor if you'll\nmove out of the doorway.\"\n\n\"Do I incommode you by standing here?\" answered the count.\n\n\"Infinitely, my lord,\" answered Bernenstein stiffly.\n\n\"Hallo, Bernenstein, what's the matter?\" cried Anton, seeing that their\ntones and glances had grown angry. The crowd also had noticed the raised\nvoices and hostile manner of the disputants, and began to gather round\nin a more compact group.\n\nSuddenly a voice came from inside the hall: it was distinct and loud,\nyet not without a touch of huskiness. The sound of it hushed the rising\nquarrel and silenced the crowd into expectant stillness. Bernenstein\nlooked aghast, Rischenheim nervous yet triumphant, Anton amused and\ngratified.\n\n\"The king!\" he cried, and burst into a laugh. \"You've drawn him,\nRischenheim!\"\n\nThe crowd heard his boyish exclamation and raised a cheer. Helsing\nturned, as though to rebuke them. Had not the king himself desired\nsecrecy? Yes, but he who spoke as the king chose any risk sooner than\nlet Rischenheim go back and warn Rupert of his presence.\n\n\"Is that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim?\" called Rudolf from within. \"If\nso, let him enter and then shut the door.\"\n\nThere was something in his tone that alarmed Rischenheim. He started\nback on the step. But Bernenstein caught him by the arm.\n\n\"Since you wish to come in, come in,\" he said with a grim smile.\n\nRischenheim looked round, as though he meditated flight. The next\nmoment Bernenstein was thrust aside. For one short instant a tall figure\nappeared in the doorway; the crowd had but a glimpse, yet they cheered\nagain. Rischenheim's hand was clasped in a firm grip; he passed\nunwillingly but helplessly through the door. Bernenstein followed; the\ndoor was shut. Anton faced round on Helsing, a scornful twist on his\nlips.\n\n\"There was a deuced lot of mystery about nothing,\" said he. \"Why\ncouldn't you say he was there?\" And without waiting for an answer from\nthe outraged and bewildered chancellor he swung down the steps and\nclimbed into his phaeton.\n\nThe people round were chatting noisily, delighted to have caught a\nglimpse of the king, speculating what brought him and the queen to my\nhouse, and hoping that they would soon come out and get into the royal\ncarriage that still stood waiting.\n\nHad they been able to see inside the door, their emotion would have been\nstirred to a keener pitch. Rudolf himself caught Rischenheim by the arm,\nand without a moment's delay led him towards the back of the house. They\nwent along a passage and reached a small room that looked out on the\ngarden. Rudolf had known my house in old days, and did not forget its\nresources.\n\n\"Shut the door, Bernenstein,\" said Rudolf. Then he turned to\nRischenheim. \"My lord,\" he said, \"I suppose you came to find out\nsomething. Do you know it now?\"\n\nRischenheim plucked up courage to answer him.\n\n\"Yes, I know now that I have to deal with an impostor,\" said he\ndefiantly.\n\n\"Precisely. And impostors can't afford to be exposed.\" Rischenheim's\ncheek turned rather pale. Rudolf faced him, and Bernenstein guarded the\ndoor. He was absolutely at their mercy; and he knew their secret. Did\nthey know his--the news that Rupert of Hentzau had brought?\n\n\"Listen,\" said Rudolf. \"For a few hours to-day I am king in Strelsau. In\nthose few hours I have an account to settle with your cousin: something\nthat he has, I must have. I'm going now to seek him, and while I seek\nhim you will stay here with Bernenstein. Perhaps I shall fail, perhaps\nI shall succeed. Whether I succeed or fail, by to-night I shall be far\nfrom Strelsau, and the king's place will be free for him again.\"\n\nRischenheim gave a slight start, and a look of triumph spread over his\nface. They did not know that the king was dead.\n\nRudolf came nearer to him, fixing his eyes steadily on his prisoner's\nface.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he continued, \"why you are in this business, my lord.\nYour cousin's motives I know well. But I wonder that they seemed to you\ngreat enough to justify the ruin of an unhappy lady who is your queen.\nBe assured that I will die sooner than let that letter reach the king's\nhand.\"\n\nRischenheim made him no answer.\n\n\"Are you armed?\" asked Rudolf.\n\nRischenheim sullenly flung his revolver on the table. Bernenstein came\nforward and took it.\n\n\"Keep him here, Bernenstein. When I return I'll tell you what more to\ndo. If I don't return, Fritz will be here soon, and you and he must make\nyour own plans.\"\n\n\"He sha'n't give me the slip a second time,\" said Bernenstein.\n\n\"We hold ourselves free,\" said Rudolf to Rischenheim, \"to do what we\nplease with you, my lord. But I have no wish to cause your death, unless\nit be necessary. You will be wise to wait till your cousin's fate is\ndecided before you attempt any further steps against us.\" And with a\nslight bow he left the prisoner in Bernenstein's charge, and went back\nto the room where the queen awaited him. Helga was with her. The queen\nsprang up to meet him.\n\n\"I mustn't lose a moment,\" he said. \"All that crowd of people know now\nthat the king is here. The news will filter through the town in no time.\nWe must send word to Sapt to keep it from the king's ears at all costs:\nI must go and do my work, and then disappear.\"\n\nThe queen stood facing him. Her eyes seemed to devour his face; but she\nsaid only: \"Yes, it must be so.\"\n\n\"You must return to the palace as soon as I am gone. I shall send out\nand ask the people to disperse, and then I must be off.\"\n\n\"To seek Rupert of Hentzau?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe struggled for a moment with the contending feelings that filled her\nheart. Then she came to him and seized hold of his hand.\n\n\"Don't go,\" she said in low trembling tones. \"Don't go, Rudolf. He'll\nkill you. Never mind the letter. Don't go: I had rather a thousand times\nthat the king had it than that you should.... Oh, my dear, don't go!\"\n\n\"I must go,\" he said softly.\n\nAgain she began to implore him, but he would not yield. Helga moved\ntowards the door, but Rudolf stopped her.\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"you must stay with her; you must go to the palace with\nher.\"\n\nEven as he spoke they heard the wheels of a carriage driven quickly to\nthe door. By now I had met Anton von Strofzin and heard from him that\nthe king was at my house. As I dashed up the news was confirmed by the\ncomments and jokes of the crowd.\n\n\"Ah, he's in a hurry,\" they said. \"He's kept the king waiting. He'll get\na wigging.\"\n\nAs may be supposed, I paid little heed to them. I sprang out and ran up\nthe steps to the door. I saw my wife's face at the window: she herself\nran to the door and opened it for me.\n\n\"Good God,\" I whispered, \"do all these people know he's here, and take\nhim for the king?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"We couldn't help it. He showed himself at the door.\"\n\nIt was worse than I dreamt: not two or three people, but all that crowd\nwere victims of the mistake; all of them had heard that the king was in\nStrelsau--ay, and had seen him.\n\n\"Where is he? Where is he?\" I asked, and followed her hastily to the\nroom.\n\nThe queen and Rudolf were standing side by side. What I have told from\nHelga's description had just passed between them. Rudolf ran to meet me.\n\n\"Is all well?\" he asked eagerly.\n\nI forgot the queen's presence and paid no sign of respect to her. I\ncaught Rudolf by the arm and cried to him: \"Do they take you for the\nking?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Heavens, man, don't look so white! We shall manage it.\nI can be gone by to-night.\"\n\n\"Gone? How will that help, since they believe you to be the king?\"\n\n\"You can keep it from the king,\" he urged. \"I couldn't help it. I can\nsettle with Rupert and disappear.\"\n\nThe three were standing round me, surprised at my great and terrible\nagitation. Looking back now, I wonder that I could speak to them at all.\n\nRudolf tried again to reassure me. He little knew the cause of what he\nsaw.\n\n\"It won't take long to settle affairs with Rupert,\" said he. \"And we\nmust have the letter, or it will get to the king after all.\"\n\n\"The king will never see the letter,\" I blurted out, as I sank back in a\nchair.\n\nThey said nothing. I looked round on their faces. I had a strange\nfeeling of helplessness, and seemed to be able to do nothing but throw\nthe truth at them in blunt plainness. Let them make what they could of\nit, I could make nothing.\n\n\"The king will never see the letter,\" I repeated. \"Rupert himself has\ninsured that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? You've not met Rupert? You've not got the letter?\"\n\n\"No, no; but the king can never read it.\"\n\nThen Rudolf seized me by the shoulder and fairly shook me; indeed I must\nhave seemed like a man in a dream or a torpor.\n\n\"Why not, man; why not?\" he asked in urgent low tones. Again I looked\nat them, but somehow this time my eyes were attracted and held by the\nqueen's face. I believe that she was the first to catch a hint of the\ntidings I brought. Her lips were parted, and her gaze eagerly strained\nupon me. I rubbed my hand across my forehead, and, looking up stupidly\nat her, I said:\n\n\"He never can see the letter. He's dead.\"\n\nThere was a little scream from Helga; Rudolf neither spoke nor moved;\nthe queen continued to gaze at me in motionless wonder and horror.\n\n\"Rupert killed him,\" said I. \"The boar-hound attacked Rupert; then\nHerbert and the king attacked him; and he killed them all. Yes, the king\nis dead. He's dead.\"\n\nNow none spoke. The queen's eyes never left my face. \"Yes, he's dead.\"\nsaid I; and I watched her eyes still. For a long while (or long\nit seemed) they were on my face; at last, as though drawn by some\nirresistible force, they turned away. I followed the new line they took.\nShe looked at Rudolf Rassendyll, and he at her. Helga had taken out her\nhandkerchief, and, utterly upset by the horror and shock, was lying back\nin a low chair, sobbing half-hysterically; I saw the swift look that\npassed from the queen to her lover, carrying in it grief, remorse, and\nmost unwilling joy. He did not speak to her, but put out his hand and\ntook hers. She drew it away almost sharply, and covered her face with\nboth hands.\n\nRudolf turned to me. \"When was it?\"\n\n\"Last night.\"\n\n\"And the.... He's at the lodge?\"\n\n\"Yes, with Sapt and James.\"\n\nI was recovering my senses and my coolness.\n\n\"Nobody knows yet,\" I said. \"We were afraid you might be taken for him\nby somebody. But, my God, Rudolf, what's to be done now?\"\n\nMr. Rassendyll's lips were set firm and tight. He frowned slightly, and\nhis blue eyes wore a curious entranced expression. He seemed to me to be\nforgetful of everything, even of us who were with him, in some one idea\nthat possessed him. The queen herself came nearer to him and lightly\ntouched his arm with her hand. He started as though surprised, then fell\nagain into his reverie.\n\n\"What's to be done, Rudolf?\" I asked again.\n\n\"I'm going to kill Rupert of Hentzau,\" he said. \"The rest we'll talk of\nafterwards.\"\n\nHe walked rapidly across the room and rang the bell. \"Clear those people\naway,\" he ordered. \"Tell them that I want to be quiet. Then send a\nclosed carriage round for me. Don't be more than ten minutes.\"\n\nThe servant received his peremptory orders with a low bow, and left us.\nThe queen, who had been all this time outwardly calm and composed,\nnow fell into a great agitation, which even the consciousness of our\npresence could not enable her to hide.\n\n\"Rudolf, must you go? Since--since this has happened--\"\n\n\"Hush, my dearest lady,\" he whispered. Then he went on more loudly,\n\"I won't quit Ruritania a second time leaving Rupert of Hentzau\nalive. Fritz, send word to Sapt that the king is in Strelsau--he will\nunderstand--and that instructions from the king will follow by midday.\nWhen I have killed Rupert, I shall visit the lodge on my way to the\nfrontier.\"\n\nHe turned to go, but the queen, following, detained him for a minute.\n\n\"You'll come and see me before you go?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"But I ought not,\" said he, his resolute eyes suddenly softening in a\nmarvelous fashion.\n\n\"You will?\"\n\n\"Yes, my queen.\"\n\nThen I sprang up, for a sudden dread laid hold on me.\n\n\"Heavens, man,\" I cried, \"what if he kills you--there in the\nKonigstrasse?\"\n\nRudolf turned to me; there was a look of surprise on his face. \"He won't\nkill me,\" he answered.\n\nThe queen, looking still in Rudolf's face, and forgetful now, as it\nseemed, of the dream that had so terrified her, took no notice of what I\nsaid, but urged again: \"You'll come, Rudolf?\"\n\n\"Yes, once, my queen,\" and with a last kiss of her hand he was gone.\n\nThe queen stood for yet another moment where she was, still and almost\nrigid. Then suddenly she walked or stumbled to where my wife sat, and,\nflinging herself on her knees, hid her face in Helga's lap; I heard her\nsobs break out fast and tumultuously. Helga looked up at me, the tears\nstreaming down her cheeks. I turned and went out. Perhaps Helga could\ncomfort her; I prayed that God in His pity might send her comfort,\nalthough she for her sin's sake dared not ask it of Him. Poor soul! I\nhope there may be nothing worse scored to my account.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. A PASTIME FOR COLONEL SAPT\n\nTHE Constable of Zenda and James, Mr. Rassendyll's servant, sat at\nbreakfast in the hunting-lodge. They were in the small room which was\nordinarily used as the bedroom of the gentleman in attendance on the\nking: they chose it now because it commanded a view of the approach. The\ndoor of the house was securely fastened; they were prepared to refuse\nadmission; in case refusal was impossible, the preparations for\nconcealing the king's body and that of his huntsman Herbert were\ncomplete. Inquirers would be told that the king had ridden out with his\nhuntsman at daybreak, promising to return in the evening but not stating\nwhere he was going; Sapt was under orders to await his return, and James\nwas expecting instructions from his master the Count of Tarlenheim.\nThus armed against discovery, they looked for news from me which should\ndetermine their future action.\n\nMeanwhile there was an interval of enforced idleness. Sapt, his meal\nfinished, puffed away at his great pipe; James, after much pressure, had\nconsented to light a small black clay, and sat at his ease with his\nlegs stretched before him. His brows were knit, and a curious half-smile\nplayed about his mouth.\n\n\"What may you be thinking about, friend James?\" asked the constable\nbetween two puffs. He had taken a fancy to the alert, ready little\nfellow.\n\nJames smoked for a moment, and then took his pipe from his mouth.\n\n\"I was thinking, sir, that since the king is dead--\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"The king is no doubt dead, poor fellow,\" said Sapt, nodding.\n\n\"That since he's certainly dead, and since my master, Mr. Rassendyll, is\nalive--\"\n\n\"So far as we know, James,\" Sapt reminded him.\n\n\"Why, yes, sir, so far as we know. Since, then, Mr. Rassendyll is alive\nand the king is dead, I was thinking that it was a great pity, sir, that\nmy master can't take his place and be king.\" James looked across at the\nconstable with an air of a man who offers a respectful suggestion.\n\n\"A remarkable thought, James,\" observed the constable with a grin.\n\n\"You don't agree with me, sir?\" asked James deprecatingly.\n\n\"I don't say that it isn't a pity, for Rudolf makes a good king. But you\nsee it's impossible, isn't it?\"\n\nJames nursed his knee between his hands, and his pipe, which he had\nreplaced, stuck out of one corner of his mouth.\n\n\"When you say impossible, sir,\" he remarked deferentially, \"I venture to\ndiffer from you.\"\n\n\"You do? Come, we're at leisure. Let's hear how it would be possible.\"\n\n\"My master is in Strelsau, sir,\" began James.\n\n\"Well, most likely.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it, sir. If he's been there, he will be taken for the\nking.\"\n\n\"That has happened before, and no doubt may happen again, unless--\"\n\n\"Why, of course, sir, unless the king's body should be discovered.\"\n\n\"That's what I was about to say, James.\"\n\nJames kept silence for a few minutes. Then he observed, \"It will be very\nawkward to explain how the king was killed.\"\n\n\"The story will need good telling,\" admitted Sapt.\n\n\"And it will be difficult to make it appear that the king was killed in\nStrelsau; yet if my master should chance to be killed in Strelsau--\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid, James! On all grounds, Heaven forbid!\"\n\n\"Even if my master is not killed, it will be difficult for us to get the\nking killed at the right time, and by means that will seem plausible.\"\n\nSapt seemed to fall into the humor of the speculation. \"That's all very\ntrue. But if Mr. Rassendyll is to be king, it will be both awkward\nand difficult to dispose of the king's body and of this poor fellow\nHerbert,\" said he, sucking at his pipe.\n\nAgain James paused for a little while before he remarked: \"I am, of\ncourse, sir, only discussing the matter by way of passing the time. It\nwould probably be wrong to carry any such plan into effect.\"\n\n\"It might be, but let us discuss it--to pass the time,\" said Sapt; and\nhe leant forward, looking into the servant's quiet, shrewd face.\n\n\"Well, then, sir, since it amuses you, let us say that the king came\nto the lodge last night, and was joined there by his friend Mr.\nRassendyll.\"\n\n\"And did I come too?\"\n\n\"You, sir, came also, in attendance on the king.\"\n\n\"Well, and you, James? You came. How came you?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, by the Count of Tarlenheim's orders, to wait on Mr.\nRassendyll, the king's friend. Now, the king, sir... This is my story,\nyou know, sir, only my story.\"\n\n\"Your story interests me. Go on with it.\"\n\n\"The king went out very early this morning, sir.\"\n\n\"That would be on private business?\"\n\n\"So we should have understood. But Mr. Rassendyll, Herbert, and\nourselves remained here.\"\n\n\"Had the Count of Hentzau been?\"\n\n\"Not to our knowledge, sir. But we were all tired and slept very\nsoundly.\"\n\n\"Now did we?\" said the constable, with a grim smile.\n\n\"In fact, sir, we were all overcome with fatigue--Mr. Rassendyll like\nthe rest--and full morning found us still in our beds. There we should\nbe to this moment, sir, had we not been suddenly aroused in a startling\nand fearful manner.\"\n\n\"You should write story books, James. Now what was this fearful manner\nin which we were aroused?\"\n\nJames laid down his pipe, and, resting his hands on his knees, continued\nhis story.\n\n\"This lodge, sir, this wooden lodge--for the lodge is all of wood, sir,\nwithout and within.\"\n\n\"This lodge is undoubtedly of wood, James, and, as you say, both inside\nand out.\"\n\n\"And since it is, sir, it would be mighty careless to leave a candle\nburning where the oil and firewood are stored.\"\n\n\"Most criminal!\"\n\n\"But hard words don't hurt dead men; and you see, sir, poor Herbert is\ndead.\"\n\n\"It is true. He wouldn't feel aggrieved.\"\n\n\"But we, sir, you and I, awaking--\"\n\n\"Aren't the others to awake, James?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I should pray that they had never awaked. For you and I,\nwaking first, would find the lodge a mass of flames. We should have to\nrun for our lives.\"\n\n\"What! Should we make no effort to rouse the others?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, we should do all that men could do; we should even risk\ndeath by suffocation.\"\n\n\"But we should fail, in spite of our heroism, should we?\"\n\n\"Alas, sir, in spite of all our efforts we should fail. The flames would\nenvelop the lodge in one blaze; before help could come, the lodge would\nbe in ruins, and my unhappy master and poor Herbert would be consumed to\nashes.\"\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\n\"They would, at least, sir, be entirely unrecognizable.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Beyond doubt, if the oil and the firewood and the candle were placed to\nthe best advantage.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. And there would be an end of Rudolf Rassendyll?\"\n\n\"Sir, I should myself carry the tidings to his family.\"\n\n\"Whereas the King of Ruritania--\"\n\n\"Would enjoy a long and prosperous reign, God willing, sir.\"\n\n\"And the Queen of Ruritania, James?\"\n\n\"Do not misunderstand me, sir. They could be secretly married. I should\nsay re-married.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, re-married.\"\n\n\"By a trustworthy priest.\"\n\n\"You mean by an untrustworthy priest?\"\n\n\"It's the same thing, sir, from a different point of view.\" For the\nfirst time James smiled a thoughtful smile.\n\nSapt in his turn laid down his pipe now, and was tugging at his\nmoustache. There was a smile on his lips too, and his eyes looked hard\ninto James's. The little man met his glance composedly.\n\n\"It's an ingenious fancy, this of yours, James,\" the constable remarked.\n\"What, though, if your master's killed too? That's quite possible. Count\nRupert's a man to be reckoned with.\"\n\n\"If my master is killed, sir, he must be buried,\" answered James.\n\n\"In Strelsau?\" came in quick question from Sapt.\n\n\"He won't mind where, sir.\"\n\n\"True, he won't mind, and we needn't mind for him.\"\n\n\"Why, no, sir. But to carry a body secretly from here to Strelsau--\"\n\n\"Yes, that is, as we agreed at the first, difficult. Well, it's a pretty\nstory, but--your master wouldn't approve of it. Supposing he were not\nkilled, I mean.\"\n\n\"It's a waste of time, sir, disapproving of what's done: he might think\nthe story better than the truth, although it's not a good story.\"\n\nThe two men's eyes met again in a long glance.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" asked Sapt, suddenly.\n\n\"London, sir, originally.\"\n\n\"They make good stories there?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and act them sometimes.\"\n\nThe instant he had spoken, James sprang to his feet and pointed out of\nthe window.\n\nA man on horseback was cantering towards the lodge. Exchanging one\nquick look, both hastened to the door, and, advancing some twenty yards,\nwaited under the tree on the spot where Boris lay buried.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Sapt, \"you forgot the dog.\" And he pointed to the\nground.\n\n\"The affectionate beast will be in his master's room and die there,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Eh, but he must rise again first!\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. That won't be a long matter.\"\n\nSapt was still smiling in grim amusement when the messenger came up and,\nleaning from his home, handed him a telegram.\n\n\"Special and urgent, sir,\" said he.\n\nSapt tore it open and read. It was the message that I sent in obedience\nto Mr. Rassendyll's orders. He would not trust my cipher, but, indeed,\nnone was necessary. Sapt would understand the message, although it said\nsimply, \"The king is in Strelsau. Wait orders at the lodge. Business\nhere in progress, but not finished. Will wire again.\"\n\nSapt handed it to James, who took it with a respectful little bow. James\nread it with attention, and returned it with another bow.\n\n\"I'll attend to what it says, sir,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sapt. \"Thanks, my man,\" he added to the messenger. \"Here's\na crown for you. If any other message comes for me and you bring it in\ngood time, you shall have another.\"\n\n\"You shall have it quick as a horse can bring it from the station, sir.\"\n\n\"The king's business won't bear delay, you know,\" nodded Sapt.\n\n\"You sha'n't have to wait, sir,\" and, with a parting salute, the fellow\nturned his horse and trotted away.\n\n\"You see,\" remarked Sapt, \"that your story is quite imaginary. For\nthat fellow can see for himself that the lodge was not burnt down last\nnight.\"\n\n\"That's true; but, excuse me, sir--\"\n\n\"Pray go on, James. I've told you that I'm interested.\"\n\n\"He can't see that it won't be burnt down to-night. A fire, sir, is a\nthing that may happen any night.\"\n\nThen old Sapt suddenly burst into a roar, half-speech, half laughter.\n\n\"By God, what a thing!\" he roared; and James smiled complacently.\n\n\"There's a fate about it,\" said the constable. \"There's a strange fate\nabout it. The man was born to it. We'd have done it before if Michael\nhad throttled the king in that cellar, as I thought he would. Yes, by\nheavens, we'd have done it! Why, we wanted it! God forgive us, in our\nhearts both Fritz and I wanted it. But Rudolf would have the king out.\nHe would have him out, though he lost a throne--and what he wanted\nmore--by it. But he would have him out. So he thwarted the fate. But\nit's not to be thwarted. Young Rupert may think this new affair is his\ndoing. No, it's the fate using him. The fate brought Rudolf here again,\nthe fate will have him king. Well, you stare at me. Do you think I'm\nmad, Mr. Valet?\"\n\n\"I think, sir, that you talk very good sense, if I may say so,\" answered\nJames.\n\n\"Sense?\" echoed Sapt with a chuckle. \"I don't know about that. But the\nfate's there, depend on it!\"\n\nThe two were back in their little room now, past the door that hid the\nbodies of the king and his huntsman. James stood by the table, old Sapt\nroamed up and down, tugging his moustache, and now and again sawing the\nair with his sturdy hairy hand.\n\n\"I daren't do it,\" he muttered: \"I daren't do it. It's a thing a man\ncan't set his hand to of his own will. But the fate'll do it--the\nfate'll do it. The fate'll force it on us.\"\n\n\"Then we'd best be ready, sir,\" suggested James quietly. Sapt turned on\nhim quickly, almost fiercely.\n\n\"They used to call me a cool hand,\" said he. \"By Jove, what are you?\"\n\n\"There's no harm in being ready, sir,\" said James, the servant.\n\nSapt came to him and caught hold of his shoulders. \"Ready?\" he asked in\na gruff whisper.\n\n\"The oil, the firewood, the light,\" said James.\n\n\"Where, man, where? Do you mean, by the bodies?\"\n\n\"Not where the bodies are now. Each must be in the proper place.\"\n\n\"We must move them then?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. And the dog too.\"\n\nSapt almost glared at him; then he burst into a laugh.\n\n\"So be it,\" he said. \"You take command. Yes, we'll be ready. The fate\ndrives.\"\n\nThen and there they set about what they had to do. It seemed indeed as\nthough some strange influence were dominating Sapt; he went about the\nwork like a man who is hardly awake. They placed the bodies each where\nthe living man would be by night--the king in the guest-room, the\nhuntsman in the sort of cupboard where the honest fellow had been wont\nto lie. They dug up the buried dog, Sapt chuckling convulsively, James\ngrave as the mute whose grim doings he seemed to travesty: they carried\nthe shot-pierced, earth-grimed thing in, and laid it in the king's room.\nThen they made their piles of wood, pouring the store of oil over them,\nand setting bottles of spirit near, that the flames having cracked the\nbottles, might gain fresh fuel. To Sapt it seemed now as if they played\nsome foolish game that was to end with the playing, now as if they\nobeyed some mysterious power which kept its great purpose hidden from\nits instruments. Mr. Rassendyll's servant moved and arranged and ordered\nall as deftly as he folded his master's clothes or stropped his master's\nrazor. Old Sapt stopped him once as he went by.\n\n\"Don't think me a mad fool, because I talk of the fate,\" he said, almost\nanxiously.\n\n\"Not I, sir,\" answered James, \"I know nothing of that. But I like to be\nready.\"\n\n\"It would be a thing!\" muttered Sapt.\n\nThe mockery, real or assumed, in which they had begun their work, had\nvanished now. If they were not serious, they played at seriousness. If\nthey entertained no intention such as their acts seemed to indicate,\nthey could no longer deny that they had cherished a hope. They shrank,\nor at least Sapt shrank, from setting such a ball rolling; but they\nlonged for the fate that would give it a kick, and they made smooth the\nincline down which it, when thus impelled, was to run. When they had\nfinished their task and sat down again opposite to one another in the\nlittle front room, the whole scheme was ready, the preparations were\nmade, all was in train; they waited only for that impulse from chance or\nfate which was to turn the servant's story into reality and action.\nAnd when the thing was done, Sapt's coolness, so rarely upset, yet so\ncompletely beaten by the force of that wild idea, came back to him. He\nlit his pipe again and lay back in his chair, puffing freely, with a\nmeditative look on his face.\n\n\"It's two o'clock, sir,\" said James. \"Something should have happened\nbefore now in Strelsau.\"\n\n\"Ah, but what?\" asked the constable.\n\nSuddenly breaking on their ears came a loud knock at the door. Absorbed\nin their own thoughts, they had not noticed two men riding up to the\nlodge. The visitors wore the green and gold of the king's huntsmen;\nthe one who had knocked was Simon, the chief huntsman, and brother of\nHerbert, who lay dead in the little room inside.\n\n\"Rather dangerous!\" muttered the Constable of Zenda as he hurried to the\ndoor, James following him.\n\nSimon was astonished when Sapt opened the door.\n\n\"Beg pardon, Constable, but I want to see Herbert. Can I go in?\" And he\njumped down from his horse, throwing the reins to his companion.\n\n\"What's the good of your going in?\" asked Sapt. \"Herbert's not here.\"\n\n\"Not here? Then where is he?\"\n\n\"Why, he went with the king this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, he went with the king, sir? Then he's in Strelsau, I suppose?\"\n\n\"If you know that, Simon, you're wiser than I am.\"\n\n\"But the king is in Strelsau, sir.\"\n\n\"The deuce he is! He said nothing of going to Strelsau. He rose early\nand rode off with Herbert, merely saying they would be back to-night.\"\n\n\"He went to Strelsau, sir. I am just from Zenda, and his Majesty is\nknown to have been in town with the queen. They were both at Count\nFritz's.\"\n\n\"I'm much interested to hear it. But didn't the telegram say where\nHerbert was?\"\n\nSimon laughed.\n\n\"Herbert's not a king, you see,\" he said. \"Well, I'll come again\nto-morrow morning, for I must see him soon. He'll be back by then, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, Simon, your brother will be here to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Or what's left of him after such a two-days of work,\" suggested Simon\njocularly.\n\n\"Why, yes, precisely,\" said Sapt, biting his moustache and darting one\nswift glance at James. \"Or what's left of him, as you say.\"\n\n\"And I'll bring a cart and carry the boar down to the castle at the same\ntime, sir. At least, I suppose you haven't eaten it all?\"\n\nSapt laughed; Simon was gratified at the tribute, and laughed even more\nheartily himself.\n\n\"We haven't even cooked it yet,\" said Sapt, \"but I won't answer for it\nthat we sha'n't have by to-morrow.\"\n\n\"All right, sir; I'll be here. By the way, there's another bit of news\ncome on the wires. They say Count Rupert of Hentzau has been seen in the\ncity.\"\n\n\"Rupert of Hentzau? Oh, pooh! Nonsense, my good Simon. He daren't show\nhis face there for his life.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it may be no nonsense. Perhaps that's what took the king to\nStrelsau.\"\n\n\"It's enough to take him if it's true,\" admitted Sapt.\n\n\"Well, good day, sir.\"\n\n\"Good day, Simon.\"\n\nThe two huntsmen rode off. James watched them for a little while.\n\n\"The king,\" he said then, \"is known to be in Strelsau; and now Count\nRupert is known to be in Strelsau. How is Count Rupert to have killed\nthe king here in the forest of Zenda, sir?\"\n\nSapt looked at him almost apprehensively.\n\n\"How is the king's body to come to the forest of Zenda?\" asked James.\n\"Or how is the king's body to go to the city of Strelsau?\"\n\n\"Stop your damned riddles!\" roared Sapt. \"Man, are you bent on driving\nme into it?\"\n\nThe servant came near to him, and laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You went into as great a thing once before, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"It was to save the king.\"\n\n\"And this is to save the queen and yourself. For if we don't do it, the\ntruth about my master must be known.\"\n\nSapt made him no answer. They sat down again in silence.\n\nThere they sat, sometimes smoking, never speaking, while the tedious\nafternoon wore away, and the shadows from the trees of the forest\nlengthened. They did not think of eating or drinking; they did not move,\nsave when James rose and lit a little fire of brushwood in the grate.\nIt grew dusk and again James moved to light the lamp. It was hard on six\no'clock, and still no news came from Strelsau.\n\nThen there was the sound of a horse's hoofs. The two rushed to the\ndoor, beyond it, and far along the grassy road that gave approach to the\nhunting-lodge. They forgot to guard the secret and the door gaped open\nbehind them. Sapt ran as he had not run for many a day, and outstripped\nhis companion. There was a message from Strelsau!\n\nThe constable, without a word of greeting, snatched the envelope\nfrom the hand of the messenger and tore it open. He read it hastily,\nmuttering under his breath \"Good God!\" Then he turned suddenly round and\nbegan to walk quickly back to James, who, seeing himself beaten in the\nrace, had dropped to a walk. But the messenger had his cares as well as\nthe constable. If the constable's thoughts were on a crown, so were his.\nHe called out in indignant protest:\n\n\"I have never drawn rein since Hofbau, sir. Am I not to have my crown?\"\n\nSapt stopped, turned, and retraced his steps. He took a crown from his\npocket. As he looked up in giving it, there was a queer smile on his\nbroad, weather-beaten face.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said, \"every man that deserves a crown shall have one, if I can\ngive it him.\"\n\nThen he turned again to James, who had now come up, and laid his hand on\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"Come along, my king-maker,\" said he.\n\nJames looked in his face for a moment. The constable's eyes met his; and\nthe constable nodded.\n\nSo they turned to the lodge where the dead king and his huntsman lay.\nVerily the fate drove.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A CROWD IN THE KONIGSTRASSE\n\nThe project that had taken shape in the thoughts of Mr. Rassendyll's\nservant, and had inflamed Sapt's daring mind as the dropping of a spark\nkindles dry shavings, had suggested itself vaguely to more than one of\nus in Strelsau. We did not indeed coolly face and plan it, as the little\nservant had, nor seize on it at once with an eagerness to be convinced\nof its necessity, like the Constable of Zenda; but it was there in my\nmind, sometimes figuring as a dread, sometimes as a hope, now seeming\nthe one thing to be avoided, again the only resource against a more\ndisastrous issue. I knew that it was in Bernenstein's thoughts no less\nthan in my own; for neither of us had been able to form any reasonable\nscheme by which the living king, whom half Strelsau now knew to be in\nthe city, could be spirited away, and the dead king set in his place.\nThe change could take place, as it seemed, only in one way and at one\ncost: the truth, or the better part of it, must be told, and every\ntongue set wagging with gossip and guesses concerning Rudolf Rassendyll\nand his relations with the queen. Who that knows what men and women are\nwould not have shrunk from that alternative? To adopt it was to expose\nthe queen to all or nearly all the peril she had run by the loss of\nthe letter. We indeed assumed, influenced by Rudolf's unhesitating\nself-confidence, that the letter would be won back, and the mouth of\nRupert of Hentzau shut; but enough would remain to furnish material\nfor eager talk and for conjectures unrestrained by respect or charity.\nTherefore, alive as we were to its difficulties and its unending risks,\nwe yet conceived of the thing as possible, had it in our hearts, and\nhinted it to one another--my wife to me, I to Bernenstein, and he\nto me--in quick glances and half uttered sentences that declared its\npresence while shunning the open confession of it. For the queen herself\nI cannot speak. Her thoughts, as I judged them, were bounded by the\nlonging to see Mr. Rassendyll again, and dwelt on the visit that he\npromised as the horizon of hope. To Rudolf we had dared to disclose\nnothing of the part our imaginations set him to play: if he were to\naccept it, the acceptance would be of his own act, because the fate that\nold Sapt talked of drove him, and on no persuasion of ours. As he\nhad said, he left the rest, and had centered all his efforts on the\nimmediate task which fell to his hand to perform, the task that was\nto be accomplished at the dingy old house in the Konigstrasse. We were\nindeed awake to the fact that even Rupert's death would not make\nthe secret safe. Rischenheim, although for the moment a prisoner and\nhelpless, was alive and could not be mewed up for ever; Bauer was we\nknew not where, free to act and free to talk. Yet in our hearts we\nfeared none but Rupert, and the doubt was not whether we could do the\nthing so much as whether we should. For in moments of excitement and\nintense feeling a man makes light of obstacles which look large enough\nas he turns reflective eyes on them in the quiet of after-days.\n\nA message in the king's name had persuaded the best part of the idle\ncrowd to disperse reluctantly. Rudolf himself had entered one of my\ncarriages and driven off. He started not towards the Konigstrasse, but\nin the opposite direction: I supposed that he meant to approach his\ndestination by a circuitous way, hoping to gain it without attracting\nnotice. The queen's carriage was still before my door, for it had been\narranged that she was to proceed to the palace and there await tidings.\nMy wife and I were to accompany her; and I went to her now, where she\nsat alone, and asked if it were her pleasure to start at once. I found\nher thoughtful but calm. She listened to me; then, rising, she said,\n\"Yes, I will go.\" But then she asked suddenly, \"Where is the Count of\nLuzau-Rischenheim?\"\n\nI told her how Bernenstein kept guard over the count in the room at the\nback of the house. She seemed to consider for a moment, then she said:\n\n\"I will see him. Go and bring him to me. You must be here while I talk\nto him, but nobody else.\"\n\nI did not know what she intended, but I saw no reason to oppose her\nwishes, and I was glad to find for her any means of employing this time\nof suspense. I obeyed her commands and brought Rischenheim to her. He\nfollowed me slowly and reluctantly; his unstable mind had again jumped\nfrom rashness to despondency: he was pale and uneasy, and, when he found\nhimself in her presence, the bravado of his bearing, maintained before\nBernenstein, gave place to a shamefaced sullenness. He could not meet\nthe grave eyes that she fixed on him.\n\nI withdrew to the farther end of the room; but it was small, and I heard\nall that passed. I had my revolver ready to cover Rischenheim in case\nhe should be moved to make a dash for liberty. But he was past\nthat: Rupert's presence was a tonic that nerved him to effort and to\nconfidence, but the force of the last dose was gone and the man was sunk\nagain to his natural irresolution.\n\n\"My lord,\" she began gently, motioning him to sit, \"I have desired to\nspeak with you, because I do not wish a gentleman of your rank to think\ntoo much evil of his queen. Heaven has willed that my secret should be\nto you no secret, and therefore I may speak plainly. You may say my own\nshame should silence me; I speak to lessen my shame in your eyes, if I\ncan.\"\n\nRischenheim looked up with a dull gaze, not understanding her mood. He\nhad expected reproaches, and met low-voiced apology.\n\n\"And yet,\" she went on, \"it is because of me that the king lies dead\nnow; and a faithful humble fellow also, caught in the net of my unhappy\nfortunes, has given his life for me, though he didn't know it. Even\nwhile we speak, it may be that a gentleman, not too old yet to learn\nnobility, may be killed in my quarrel; while another, whom I alone of\nall that know him may not praise, carries his life lightly in his hand\nfor me. And to you, my lord, I have done the wrong of dressing a harsh\ndeed in some cloak of excuse, making you seem to serve the king in\nworking my punishment.\"\n\nRischenheim's eyes fell to the ground, and he twisted his hands\nnervously in and out, the one about the other. I took my hand from my\nrevolver: he would not move now.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she went on, now almost dreamily, and as though she\nspoke more to herself than to him, or had even forgotten his presence,\n\"what end in Heaven's counsel my great unhappiness has served. Perhaps\nI, who have place above most women, must also be tried above most;\nand in that trial I have failed. Yet, when I weigh my misery and my\ntemptation, to my human eyes it seems that I have not failed greatly.\nMy heart is not yet humbled, God's work not yet done. But the guilt of\nblood is on my soul--even the face of my dear love I can see now only\nthrough its scarlet mist; so that if what seemed my perfect joy were now\ngranted me, it would come spoilt and stained and blotched.\"\n\nShe paused, fixing her eyes on him again; but he neither spoke nor\nmoved.\n\n\"You knew my sin,\" she said, \"the sin so great in my heart; and you knew\nhow little my acts yielded to it. Did you think, my lord, that the\nsin had no punishment, that you took it in hand to add shame to my\nsuffering? Was Heaven so kind that men must temper its indulgence by\ntheir severity? Yet I know that because I was wrong, you, being wrong,\nmight seem to yourself not wrong, and in aiding your kinsman might plead\nthat you served the king's honor. Thus, my lord, I was the cause in you\nof a deed that your heart could not welcome nor your honor praise. I\nthank God that you have come to no more hurt by it.\"\n\nRischenheim began to mutter in a low thick voice, his eyes still cast\ndown: \"Rupert persuaded me. He said the king would be very grateful,\nand--would give me--\" His voice died away, and he sat silent again,\ntwisting his hands.\n\n\"I know--I know,\" she said. \"But you wouldn't have listened to such\npersuasions if my fault hadn't blinded your eyes.\"\n\nShe turned suddenly to me, who had been standing all the while aloof,\nand stretched out her hands towards me, her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Yet,\" said she, \"your wife knows, and still loves me, Fritz.\"\n\n\"She should be no wife of mine, if she didn't,\" I cried. \"For I and all\nof mine ask no better than to die for your Majesty.\"\n\n\"She knows, and yet she loves me,\" repeated the queen. I loved to see\nthat she seemed to find comfort in Helga's love. It is women to whom\nwomen turn, and women whom women fear.\n\n\"But Helga writes no letters,\" said the queen.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said I, and I smiled a grim smile. Well, Rudolf Rassendyll\nhad never wooed my wife.\n\nShe rose, saying: \"Come, let us go to the palace.\"\n\nAs she rose, Rischenheim made a quick impulsive step towards her.\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" said she, turning towards him, \"will you also go with\nme?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant von Bernenstein will take care--\" I began. But I stopped.\nThe slightest gesture of her hand silenced me.\n\n\"Will you go with me?\" she asked Rischenheim again.\n\n\"Madam,\" he stammered, \"Madam--\"\n\nShe waited. I waited also, although I had no great patience with him.\nSuddenly he fell on his knee, but he did not venture to take her hand.\nOf her own accord she came and stretched it out to him, saying sadly:\n\"Ah, that by forgiving I could win forgiveness!\"\n\nRischenheim caught at her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"It was not I,\" I heard him mutter. \"Rupert set me on, and I couldn't\nstand out against him.\"\n\n\"Will you go with me to the palace?\" she asked, drawing her hand away,\nbut smiling.\n\n\"The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim,\" I made bold to observe, \"knows some\nthings that most people do not know, madam.\" She turned on me with\ndignity, almost with displeasure.\n\n\"The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim may be trusted to be silent,\" she said.\n\"We ask him to do nothing against his cousin. We ask only his silence.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said I, braving her anger, \"but what security shall we have?\"\n\n\"His word of honor, my lord.\" I knew that a rebuke to my presumption lay\nin her calling me \"my lord,\" for, save on formal occasions, she always\nused to call me Fritz.\n\n\"His word of honor!\" I grumbled. \"In truth, madam--\"\n\n\"He's right,\" said Rischenheim; \"he's right.\"\n\n\"No, he's wrong,\" said the queen, smiling. \"The count will keep his\nword, given to me.\"\n\nRischenheim looked at her and seemed about to address her, but then he\nturned to me, and said in a low tone:\n\n\"By Heaven, I will, Tarlenheim. I'll serve her in everything--\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said she most graciously, and yet very sadly, \"you lighten\nthe burden on me no less by your help than because I no longer feel your\nhonor stained through me. Come, we will go to the palace.\" And she went\nto him, saying, \"We will go together.\"\n\nThere was nothing for it but to trust him. I knew that I could not turn\nher.\n\n\"Then I'll see if the carriage is ready,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, do, Fritz,\" said the queen. But as I passed she stopped me for a\nmoment, saying in a whisper, \"Show that you trust him.\"\n\nI went and held out my hand to him. He took and pressed it.\n\n\"On my honor,\" he said.\n\nThen I went out and found Bernenstein sitting on a bench in the hall.\nThe lieutenant was a diligent and watchful young man; he appeared to be\nexamining his revolver with sedulous care.\n\n\"You can put that away,\" said I rather peevishly--I had not fancied\nshaking hands with Rischenheim. \"He's not a prisoner any longer. He's\none of us now.\"\n\n\"The deuce he is!\" cried Bernenstein, springing to his feet.\n\nI told him briefly what had happened, and how the queen had won Rupert's\ninstrument to be her servant.\n\n\"I suppose he'll stick to it,\" I ended; and I thought he would, though I\nwas not eager for his help.\n\nA light gleamed in Bernenstein's eyes, and I felt a tremble in the hand\nthat he laid on my shoulder.\n\n\"Then there's only Bauer now,\" he whispered. \"If Rischenheim's with us,\nonly Bauer!\"\n\nI knew very well what he meant. With Rischenheim silent, Bauer was the\nonly man, save Rupert himself, who knew the truth, the only man who\nthreatened that great scheme which more and more filled our thoughts and\ngrew upon us with an increasing force of attraction as every obstacle\nto it seemed to be cleared out of the way. But I would not look at\nBernenstein, fearing to acknowledge even with my eyes how my mind jumped\nwith his. He was bolder, or less scrupulous--which you will.\n\n\"Yes, if we can shut Bauer's mouth.\" he went on.\n\n\"The queen's waiting for the carriage,\" I interrupted snappishly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, of course, the carriage,\" and he twisted me round till I\nwas forced to look him in the face. Then he smiled, and even laughed a\nlittle.\n\n\"Only Bauer now!\" said he.\n\n\"And Rupert,\" I remarked sourly.\n\n\"Oh, Rupert's dead bones by now,\" he chuckled, and with that he went out\nof the hall door and announced the queen's approach to her servants.\nIt must be said for young Bernenstein that he was a cheerful\nfellow-conspirator. His equanimity almost matched Rudolf's own; I could\nnot rival it myself.\n\nI drove to the palace with the queen and my wife, the other two\nfollowing in a second carriage. I do not know what they said to one\nanother on the way, but Bernenstein was civil enough to his companion\nwhen I rejoined them. With us my wife was the principal speaker: she\nfilled up, from what Rudolf had told her, the gaps in our knowledge of\nhow he had spent his night in Strelsau, and by the time we arrived we\nwere fully informed in every detail. The queen said little. The impulse\nwhich had dictated her appeal to Rischenheim and carried her through\nit seemed to have died away; she had become again subject to fears and\napprehension. I saw her uneasiness when she suddenly put out her hand\nand touched mine, whispering:\n\n\"He must be at the house by now.\"\n\nOur way did not lie by the house, and we came to the palace without any\nnews of our absent chief (so I call him--as such we all, from the queen\nherself, then regarded him). She did not speak of him again; but her\neyes seemed to follow me about as though she were silently asking some\nservice of me; what it was I could not understand. Bernenstein had\ndisappeared, and the repentant count with him: knowing they were\ntogether, I was in no uneasiness; Bernenstein would see that his\ncompanion contrived no treachery. But I was puzzled by the queen's tacit\nappeal. And I was myself on fire for news from the Konigstrasse. It was\nnow two hours since Rudolf Rassendyll had left us, and no word had come\nof him or from him. At last I could bear it no longer. The queen was\nsitting with her hand in my wife's; I had been seated on the other side\nof the room, for I thought that they might wish to talk to one another;\nyet I had not seen them exchange a word. I rose abruptly and crossed the\nroom to where they were.\n\n\"Have you need of my presence, madam, or have I your permission to be\naway for a time?\" I asked.\n\n\"Where do you wish to go, Fritz?\" the queen asked with a little start,\nas though I had come suddenly across her thoughts.\n\n\"To the Konigstrasse,\" said I.\n\nTo my surprise she rose and caught my hand.\n\n\"God bless you, Fritz!\" she cried. \"I don't think I could have endured\nit longer. But I wouldn't ask you to go. But go, my dear friend, go and\nbring me news of him. Oh, Fritz, I seem to dream that dream again!\"\n\nMy wife looked up at me with a brave smile and a trembling lip.\n\n\"Shall you go into the house, Fritz?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not unless I see need, sweetheart,\" said I.\n\nShe came and kissed me. \"Go, if you are wanted,\" she said. And she tried\nto smile at the queen, as though she risked me willingly.\n\n\"I could have been such a wife, Fritz,\" whispered the queen. \"Yes, I\ncould.\"\n\nI had nothing to say; at the moment I might not have been able to say it\nif I had. There is something in the helpless courage of women that makes\nme feel soft. We can work and fight; they sit and wait. Yet they do\nnot flinch. Now I know that if I had to sit and think about the thing I\nshould turn cur.\n\nWell, I went, leaving them there together. I put on plain clothes\ninstead of my uniform, and dropped my revolver into the pocket of\nmy coat. Thus prepared, I slipped out and made my way on foot to the\nKonigstrasse.\n\nIt was now long past midday, but many folks were at their dinner and the\nstreets were not full. Two or three people recognized me, but I passed\nby almost unnoticed. There was no sign of stir or excitement, and the\nflags still floated high in the wind. Sapt had kept his secret; the men\nof Strelsau thought still that their king lived and was among them. I\nfeared that Rudolf's coming would have been seen, and expected to find a\ncrowd of people near the house. But when I reached it there were no more\nthan ten or a dozen idle fellows lounging about. I began to stroll up\nand down with as careless an air as I could assume.\n\nSoon, however, there was a change. The workmen and business folk,\ntheir meal finished, began to come out of their houses and from the\nrestaurants. The loafers before No. 19 spoke to many of them. Some said,\n\"Indeed?\" shook their heads, smiled and passed on: they had no time to\nwaste in staring at the king. But many waited; lighting their cigars or\ncigarettes or pipes, they stood gossiping with one another, looking at\ntheir watches now and again, lest they should overstay their leisure.\nThus the assembly grew to the number of a couple of hundred. I ceased my\nwalk, for the pavement was too crowded, and hung on the outskirts of the\nthrong. As I loitered there, a cigar in my mouth, I felt a hand on my\nshoulder. Turning round, I saw the lieutenant. He was in uniform. By his\nside was Rischenheim.\n\n\"You're here too, are you?\" said I. \"Well, nothing seems to be\nhappening, does it?\"\n\nFor No. 19 showed no sign of life. The shutters were up, the door\nclosed; the little shop was not open for business that day.\n\nBernenstein shook his head with a smile. His companion took no heed of\nmy remark; he was evidently in a state of great agitation, and his eyes\nnever left the door of the house. I was about to address him, when my\nattention was abruptly and completely diverted by a glimpse of a head,\ncaught across the shoulders of the bystanders.\n\nThe fellow whom I saw wore a brown wide-awake hat. The hat was pulled\ndown low over his forehead, but nevertheless beneath its rim there\nappeared a white bandage running round his head. I could not see the\nface, but the bullet-shaped skull was very familiar to me. I was sure\nfrom the first moment that the bandaged man was Bauer. Saying nothing\nto Bernenstein, I began to steal round outside the crowd. As I went, I\nheard somebody saying that it was all nonsense; the king was not there:\nwhat should the king do in such a house? The answer was a reference\nto one of the first loungers; he replied that he did not know what the\ndevil the king did there, but that the king or his double had certainly\ngone in, and had as certainly not yet come out again. I wished I could\nhave made myself known to them and persuaded them to go away; but my\npresence would have outweighed my declarations, and been taken as a\nsure sign that the king was in the house. So I kept on the outskirts and\nworked my way unobtrusively towards the bandaged head. Evidently Bauer's\nhurt had not been so serious as to prevent him leaving the infirmary to\nwhich the police had carried him: he was come now to await, even as\nI was awaiting, the issue of Rudolf's visit to the house in the\nKonigstrasse.\n\nHe had not seen me, for he was looking at No. 19 as intently as\nRischenheim. Apparently neither had caught sight of the other, or\nRischenheim would have shown some embarrassment, Bauer some excitement.\nI wormed my way quickly towards my former servant. My mind was full\nof the idea of getting hold of him. I could not forget Bernenstein's\nremark, \"Only Bauer now!\" If I could secure Bauer we were safe. Safe in\nwhat? I did not answer to myself, but the old idea was working in me.\nSafe in our secret and safe in our plan--in the plan on which we all, we\nhere in the city, and those two at the hunting-lodge, had set our minds!\nBauer's death, Bauer's capture, Bauer's silence, however procured, would\nclear the greatest hindrance from its way.\n\nBauer stared intently at the house; I crept cautiously up behind him.\nHis hand was in his trousers' pocket; where the curve of the elbow came\nthere with a space between arm and body. I slipped in my left arm and\nhooked it firmly inside his. He turned round and saw me.\n\n\"Thus we meet again, Bauer,\" said I.\n\nHe was for a moment flabbergasted, and stared stupidly at me.\n\n\"Are you also hoping to see the king?\" I asked.\n\nHe began to recover himself. A slow, cunning smile spread over his face.\n\n\"The king?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, he's in Strelsau, isn't he? Who gave you the wound on your head?\"\n\nBauer moved his arm as though he meant to withdraw it from my grasp. He\nfound himself tightly held.\n\n\"Where's that bag of mine?\" I asked.\n\nI do not know what he would have answered, for at this instant there\ncame a sound from behind the closed door of the house. It was as if some\none ran rapidly and eagerly towards the door. Then came an oath in a\nshrill voice, a woman's voice, but harsh and rough. It was answered by\nan angry cry in a girl's intonation. Full of eagerness, I drew my arm\nfrom Bauer's and sprang forward. I heard a chuckle from him and turned\nround, to see his bandaged head retreating rapidly down the street. I\nhad no time to look to him, for now I saw two men, shoulder to shoulder,\nmaking their way through the crowd, regardless of any one in their\nway, and paying no attention to abuse or remonstrances. They were the\nlieutenant and Rischenheim. Without a moment's hesitation I set myself\nto push and battle a way through, thinking to join them in front. On\nthey went, and on I went. All gave place before us in surly reluctance\nor frightened willingness. We three were together in the first rank of\nthe crowd when the door of the house was flung open, and a girl ran\nout. Her hair was disordered, her face pale, and her eyes full of alarm.\nThere she stood on the doorstep, facing the crowd, which in an instant\ngrew as if by magic to three times its former size, and, little knowing\nwhat she did, she cried in the eager accents of sheer terror:\n\n\"Help, help! The king! The king!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. YOUNG RUPERT AND THE PLAY-ACTOR\n\nThere rises often before my mind the picture of young Rupert, standing\nwhere Rischenheim left him, awaiting the return of his messenger and\nwatching for some sign that should declare to Strelsau the death of its\nking which his own hand had wrought. His image is one that memory holds\nclear and distinct, though time may blur the shape of greater and better\nmen, and the position in which he was that morning gives play enough to\nthe imagination. Save for Rischenheim, a broken reed, and Bauer, who\nwas gone, none knew where, he stood alone against a kingdom which he had\nrobbed of its head, and a band of resolute men who would know no rest\nand no security so long as he lived. For protection he had only a quick\nbrain, his courage, and his secret. Yet he could not fly--he was\nwithout resources till his cousin furnished them--and at any moment his\nopponents might find themselves able to declare the king's death and\nraise the city in hue and cry after him. Such men do not repent; but it\nmay be that he regretted the enterprise which had led him on so far and\nforced on him a deed so momentous; yet to those who knew him it seems\nmore likely that the smile broadened on his firm full lips as he looked\ndown on the unconscious city. Well, I daresay he would have been too\nmuch for me, but I wish I had been the man to find him there. He would\nnot have had it so; for I believe that he asked no better than to cross\nswords again with Rudolf Rassendyll and set his fortunes on the issue.\n\nDown below, the old woman was cooking a stew for her dinner, now and\nthen grumbling to herself that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim was so\nlong away, and Bauer, the rascal, drunk in some pot-house. The kitchen\ndoor stood open, and through it could be seen the girl Rosa, busily\nscrubbing the tiled floor; her color was high and her eyes bright; from\ntime to time she paused in her task, and, raising her head, seemed to\nlisten. The time at which the king needed her was past, but the king had\nnot come. How little the old woman knew for whom she listened! All\nher talk had been of Bauer--why Bauer did not come and what could have\nbefallen him. It was grand to hold the king's secret for him, and she\nwould hold it with her life; for he had been kind and gracious to\nher, and he was her man of all the men in Strelsau. Bauer was a stumpy\nfellow; the Count of Hentzau was handsome, handsome as the devil; but\nthe king was her man. And the king had trusted her; she would die before\nhurt should come to him.\n\nThere were wheels in the street--quick-rolling wheels. They seemed to\nstop a few doors away, then to roll on again past the house. The girl's\nhead was raised; the old woman, engrossed in her stewing, took no heed.\nThe girl's straining ear caught a rapid step outside. Then it came--the\nknock, the sharp knock followed by five light ones. The old woman heard\nnow: dropping her spoon into the pot, she lifted the mess off the fire\nand turned round, saying: \"There's the rogue at last! Open the door for\nhim, Rosa.\"\n\nBefore she spoke Rosa had darted down the passage. The door opened and\nshut again. The old woman waddled to the threshold of the kitchen.\nThe passage and the shop were dark behind the closed shutters, but the\nfigure by the girl's side was taller than Bauer's.\n\n\"Who's there?\" cried Mother Holf sharply. \"The shop's shut to-day: you\ncan't come in.\"\n\n\"But I am in,\" came the answer, and Rudolf stepped towards her. The\ngirl followed a pace behind, her hands clasped and her eyes alight with\nexcitement. \"Don't you know me?\" asked Rudolf, standing opposite the old\nwoman and smiling down on her.\n\nThere, in the dim light of the low-roofed passage, Mother Holf was\nfairly puzzled. She knew the story of Mr. Rassendyll; she knew that he\nwas again in Ruritania, it was no surprise to her that he should be in\nStrelsau; but she did not know that Rupert had killed the king, and\nshe had not seen the king close at hand since his illness and his beard\nimpaired what had been a perfect likeness. In fine, she could not tell\nwhether it were indeed the king who spoke to her or his counterfeit.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, curt and blunt in her confusion. The girl\nbroke in with an amused laugh.\n\n\"Why, it's the--\" She paused. Perhaps the king's identity was a secret.\n\nRudolf nodded to her. \"Tell her who I am,\" said he.\n\n\"Why, mother, it's the king,\" whispered Rosa, laughing and blushing.\n\"The king, mother.\"\n\n\"Ay, if the king's alive, I'm the king,\" said Rudolf. I suppose he\nwanted to find out how much the old woman knew.\n\nShe made no answer, but stared up at his face. In her bewilderment she\nforgot to ask how he had learnt the signal that gained him admission.\n\n\"I've come to see the Count of Hentzau,\" Rudolf continued. \"Take me to\nhim at once.\"\n\nThe old woman was across his path in a moment, all defiant, arms akimbo.\n\n\"Nobody can see the count. He's not here,\" she blurted out.\n\n\"What, can't the king see him? Not even the king?\"\n\n\"King!\" she cried, peering at him. \"Are you the king?\"\n\nRosa burst out laughing.\n\n\"Mother, you must have seen the king a hundred times,\" she laughed.\n\n\"The king, or his ghost--what does it matter?\" said Rudolf lightly.\n\nThe old woman drew back with an appearance of sudden alarm.\n\n\"His ghost? Is he?\"\n\n\"His ghost!\" rang out in the girl's merry laugh. \"Why, here's the king\nhimself, mother. You don't look much like a ghost, sir.\"\n\nMother Holf's face was livid now, and her eyes staring fixedly. Perhaps\nit shot into her brain that something had happened to the king, and that\nthis man had come because of it--this man who was indeed the image,\nand might have been the spirit, of the king. She leant against the\ndoor post, her broad bosom heaving under her scanty stuff gown. Yet\nstill--was it not the king?\n\n\"God help us!\" she muttered in fear and bewilderment.\n\n\"He helps us, never fear,\" said Rudolf Rassendyll. \"Where is Count\nRupert?\"\n\nThe girl had caught alarm from her mother's agitation. \"He's upstairs\nin the attic at the top of the house, sir,\" she whispered in frightened\ntones, with a glance that fled from her mother's terrified face to\nRudolf's set eyes and steady smile.\n\nWhat she said was enough for him. He slipped by the old woman and began\nto mount the stairs.\n\nThe two watched him, Mother Holf as though fascinated, the girl alarmed\nbut still triumphant: she had done what the king bade her. Rudolf turned\nthe corner of the first landing and disappeared from their sight. The\nold woman, swearing and muttering, stumbled back into her kitchen, set\nher stew on the fire, and began to stir it, her eyes set on the flames\nand careless of the pot. The girl watched her mother for a moment,\nwondering how she could think of the stew, not guessing that she turned\nthe spoon without a thought of what she did; then she began to crawl,\nquickly but noiselessly, up the staircase in the track of Rudolf\nRassendyll. She looked back once: the old woman stirred with a\nmonotonous circular movement of her fat arm. Rosa, bent half-double,\nskimmed upstairs, till she came in sight of the king whom she was so\nproud to serve. He was on the top landing now, outside the door of a\nlarge attic where Rupert of Hentzau was lodged. She saw him lay his hand\non the latch of the door; his other hand rested in the pocket of his\ncoat. From the room no sound came; Rupert may have heard the step\noutside and stood motionless to listen. Rudolf opened the door and\nwalked in. The girl darted breathlessly up the remaining steps, and,\ncoming to the door, just as it swung back on the latch, crouched down\nby it, listening to what passed within, catching glimpses of forms and\nmovements through the chinks of the crazy hinge and the crevices where\nthe wood of the panel sprung and left a narrow eye hole for her absorbed\ngazing.\n\nRupert of Hentzau had no thought of ghosts; the men he killed lay still\nwhere they fell, and slept where they were buried. And he had no\nwonder at the sight of Rudolf Rassendyll. It told him no more than that\nRischenheim's errand had fallen out ill, at which he was not surprised,\nand that his old enemy was again in his path, at which (as I verily\nbelieve) he was more glad than sorry. As Rudolf entered, he had been\nhalf-way between window and table; he came forward to the table now, and\nstood leaning the points of two fingers on the unpolished dirty-white\ndeal.\n\n\"Ah, the play-actor!\" said he, with a gleam of his teeth and a toss of\nhis curls, while his second hand, like Mr. Rassendyll's, rested in the\npocket of his coat.\n\nMr. Rassendyll himself has confessed that in old days it went against\nthe grain with him when Rupert called him a play-actor. He was a little\nolder now, and his temper more difficult to stir.\n\n\"Yes, the play-actor,\" he answered, smiling. \"With a shorter part this\ntime, though.\"\n\n\"What part to-day? Isn't it the old one, the king with a pasteboard\ncrown?\" asked Rupert, sitting down on the table. \"Faith, we shall do\nhandsomely in Ruritania: you have a pasteboard crown, and I (humble man\nthough I am) have given the other one a heavenly crown. What a brave\nshow! But perhaps I tell you news?\"\n\n\"No, I know what you've done.\"\n\n\"I take no credit. It was more the dog's doing than mine,\" said Rupert\ncarelessly. \"However, there it is, and dead he is, and there's an end of\nit. What's your business, play-actor?\"\n\nAt the repetition of this last word, to her so mysterious, the girl\noutside pressed her eyes more eagerly to the chink and strained her ears\nto listen more sedulously. And what did the count mean by the \"other\none\" and \"a heavenly crown\"?\n\n\"Why not call me king?\" asked Rudolf.\n\n\"They call you that in Strelsau?\"\n\n\"Those that know I'm here.\"\n\n\"And they are--?\"\n\n\"Some few score.\"\n\n\"And thus,\" said Rupert, waving an arm towards the window, \"the town is\nquiet and the flags fly?\"\n\n\"You've been waiting to see them lowered?\"\n\n\"A man likes to have some notice taken of what he has done,\" Rupert\ncomplained. \"However, I can get them lowered when I will.\"\n\n\"By telling your news? Would that be good for yourself?\"\n\n\"Forgive me--not that way. Since the king has two lives, it is but in\nnature that he should have two deaths.\"\n\n\"And when he has undergone the second?\"\n\n\"I shall live at peace, my friend, on a certain source of income that I\npossess.\" He tapped his breast-pocket with a slight, defiant laugh. \"In\nthese days,\" said he, \"even queens must be careful about their letters.\nWe live in moral times.\"\n\n\"You don't share the responsibility for it,\" said Rudolf, smiling.\n\n\"I make my little protest. But what's your business, play-actor? For I\nthink you're rather tiresome.\"\n\nRudolf grew grave. He advanced towards the table, and spoke in low,\nserious tones.\n\n\"My lord, you're alone in this matter now. Rischenheim is a prisoner;\nyour rogue Bauer I encountered last night and broke his head.\"\n\n\"Ah, you did?\"\n\n\"You have what you know of in your hands. If you yield, on my honor I\nwill save your life.\"\n\n\"You don't desire my blood, then, most forgiving play-actor?\"\n\n\"So much, that I daren't fail to offer you life,\" answered Rudolf\nRassendyll. \"Come, sir, your plan has failed: give up the letter.\"\n\nRupert looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"You'll see me safe off if I give it you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'll prevent your death. Yes, and I'll see you safe.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"To a fortress, where a trustworthy gentleman will guard you.\"\n\n\"For how long, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"I hope for many years, my dear Count.\"\n\n\"In fact, I suppose, as long as--?\"\n\n\"Heaven leaves you to the world, Count. It's impossible to set you\nfree.\"\n\n\"That's the offer, then?\"\n\n\"The extreme limit of indulgence,\" answered Rudolf. Rupert burst into\na laugh, half of defiance, yet touched with the ring of true amusement.\nThen he lit a cigarette and sat puffing and smiling.\n\n\"I should wrong you by straining your kindness so far,\" said he; and in\nwanton insolence, seeking again to show Mr. Rassendyll the mean esteem\nin which he held him, and the weariness his presence was, he raised his\narms and stretched them above his head, as a man does in the fatigue of\ntedium. \"Heigho!\" he yawned.\n\nBut he had overshot the mark this time. With a sudden swift bound Rudolf\nwas upon him; his hands gripped Rupert's wrists, and with his greater\nstrength he bent back the count's pliant body till trunk and head lay\nflat on the table. Neither man spoke; their eyes met; each heard the\nother's breathing and felt the vapor of it on his face. The girl outside\nhad seen the movement of Rudolf's figure, but her cranny did not serve\nher to show her the two where they were now; she knelt on her knees in\nignorant suspense. Slowly and with a patient force Rudolf began to work\nhis enemy's arms towards one another. Rupert had read his design in his\neyes and resisted with tense muscles. It seemed as though his arms must\ncrack; but at last they moved. Inch by inch they were driven closer; now\nthe elbows almost touched; now the wrists joined in reluctant contact.\nThe sweat broke out on the count's brow, and stood in large drops on\nRudolf's. Now the wrists were side by side, and slowly the long sinewy\nfingers of Rudolf's right hand, that held one wrist already in their\nvise, began to creep round the other. The grip seemed to have half\nnumbed Rupert's arms, and his struggles grew fainter. Round both wrists\nthe sinewy fingers climbed and coiled; gradually and timidly the grasp\nof the other hand was relaxed and withdrawn. Would the one hold both?\nWith a great spasm of effort Rupert put it to the proof.\n\nThe smile that bent Mr. Rassendyll's lips gave the answer. He could hold\nboth, with one hand he could hold both: not for long, no, but for an\ninstant. And then, in the instant, his left hand, free at last, shot to\nthe breast of the count's coat. It was the same that he had worn at\nthe hunting-lodge, and was ragged and torn from the boar-hound's teeth.\nRudolf tore it further open, and his hand dashed in.\n\n\"God's curse on you!\" snarled Rupert of Hentzau.\n\nBut Mr. Rassendyll still smiled. Then he drew out a letter. A glance\nat it showed him the queen's seal. As he glanced Rupert made another\neffort. The one hand, wearied out, gave way, and Mr. Rassendyll had no\nmore than time to spring away, holding his prize. The next moment he had\nhis revolver in his hand--none too soon, for Rupert of Hentzau's barrel\nfaced him, and they stood thus, opposite to one another, with no more\nthan three or four feet between the mouths of their weapons.\n\nThere is, indeed, much that may be said against Rupert of Hentzau, the\ntruth about him well-nigh forbidding that charity of judgment which we\nare taught to observe towards all men. But neither I nor any man who\nknew him ever found in him a shrinking from danger or a fear of death.\nIt was no feeling such as these, but rather a cool calculation of\nchances, that now stayed his hand. Even if he were victorious in the\nduel, and both did not die, yet the noise of the firearms would greatly\ndecrease his chances of escape. Moreover, he was a noted swordsman, and\nconceived that he was Mr. Rassendyll's superior in that exercise. The\nsteel offered him at once a better prospect for victory and more hope of\na safe fight. So he did not pull his trigger, but, maintaining his aim\nthe while, said:\n\n\"I'm not a street bully, and I don't excel in a rough-and-tumble. Will\nyou fight now like a gentleman? There's a pair of blades in the case\nyonder.\"\n\nMr. Rassendyll, in his turn, was keenly alive to the peril that still\nhung over the queen. To kill Rupert would not save her if he himself\nalso were shot and left dead, or so helpless that he could not destroy\nthe letter; and while Rupert's revolver was at his heart he could not\ntear it up nor reach the fire that burnt on the other side of the\nroom. Nor did he fear the result of a trial with steel, for he had kept\nhimself in practice and improved his skill since the days when he came\nfirst to Strelsau.\n\n\"As you will,\" said he. \"Provided we settle the matter here and now, the\nmanner is the same to me.\"\n\n\"Put your revolver on the table, then, and I'll lay mine by the side of\nit.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" smiled Rudolf, \"but you must lay yours down first.\"\n\n\"I'm to trust you, it seems, but you won't trust me!\"\n\n\"Precisely. You know you can trust me; you know that I can't trust you.\"\n\nA sudden flush swept over Rupert of Hentzau's face. There were moments\nwhen he saw, in the mirror of another's face or words, the estimation in\nwhich honorable men held him; and I believe that he hated Mr. Rassendyll\nmost fiercely, not for thwarting his enterprise, but because he had more\npower than any other man to show him that picture. His brows knit in a\nfrown, and his lips shut tight.\n\n\"Ay, but though you won't fire, you'll destroy the letter,\" he sneered.\n\"I know your fine distinctions.\"\n\n\"Again I beg your pardon. You know very well that, although all Strelsau\nwere at the door, I wouldn't touch the letter.\"\n\nWith an angry muttered oath Rupert flung his revolver on the table.\nRudolf came forward and laid his by it. Then he took up both, and,\ncrossing to the mantelpiece, laid them there; between there he placed\nthe queen's letter. A bright blaze burnt in the grate; it needed but the\nslightest motion of his hand to set the letter beyond all danger. But he\nplaced it carefully on the mantelpiece, and, with a slight smile on his\nface, turned to Rupert, saying: \"Now shall we resume the bout that Fritz\nvon Tarlenheim interrupted in the forest of Zenda?\"\n\nAll this while they had been speaking in subdued accents, resolution\nin one, anger in the other, keeping the voice in an even, deliberate\nlowness. The girl outside caught only a word here and there; but now\nsuddenly the flash of steel gleamed on her eyes through the crevice of\nthe hinge. She gave a sudden gasp, and, pressing her face closer to the\nopening, listened and looked. For Rupert of Hentzau had taken the swords\nfrom their case and put them on the table. With a slight bow Rudolf took\none, and the two assumed their positions. Suddenly Rupert lowered his\npoint. The frown vanished from his face, and he spoke in his usual\nbantering tone.\n\n\"By the way,\" said he, \"perhaps we're letting our feelings run away\nwith us. Have you more of a mind now to be King of Ruritania? If so, I'm\nready to be the most faithful of your subjects.\"\n\n\"You honor me, Count.\"\n\n\"Provided, of course, that I'm one of the most favored and the richest.\nCome, come, the fool is dead now; he lived like a fool and he died like\na fool. The place is empty. A dead man has no rights and suffers no\nwrongs. Damn it, that's good law, isn't it? Take his place and his wife.\nYou can pay my price then. Or are you still so virtuous? Faith, how\nlittle some men learn from the world they live in! If I had your\nchance!\"\n\n\"Come, Count, you'd be the last man to trust Rupert of Hentzau.\"\n\n\"If I made it worth his while?\"\n\n\"But he's a man who would take the pay and betray his associate.\"\n\nAgain Rupert flushed. When he next spoke his voice was hard, cold, and\nlow.\n\n\"By God, Rudolf Rassendyll,\" said he, \"I'll kill you here and now.\"\n\n\"I ask no better than that you should try.\"\n\n\"And then I'll proclaim that woman for what she is in all Strelsau.\" A\nsmile came on his lips as he watched Rudolf's face.\n\n\"Guard yourself, my lord,\" said Mr. Rassendyll.\n\n\"Ay, for no better than--There, man, I'm ready for you.\" For Rudolf's\nblade had touched his in warning.\n\nThe steel jangled. The girl's pale face was at the crevice of the hinge.\nShe heard the blades cross again and again. Then one would run up the\nother with a sharp, grating slither. At times she caught a glimpse of\na figure in quick forward lunge or rapid wary withdrawal. Her brain was\nalmost paralyzed.\n\nIgnorant of the mind and heart of young Rupert, she could not conceive\nthat he tried to kill the king. Yet the words she had caught sounded\nlike the words of men quarreling, and she could not persuade herself\nthat the gentlemen fenced only for pastime. They were not speaking now;\nbut she heard their hard breathing and the movement of their unresting\nfeet on the bare boards of the floor. Then a cry rang out, clear and\nmerry with the fierce hope of triumph: \"Nearly! nearly!\"\n\nShe knew the voice for Rupert of Hentzau's, and it was the king who\nanswered calmly, \"Nearly isn't quite.\"\n\nAgain she listened. They seemed to have paused for a moment, for there\nwas no sound, save of the hard breathing and deep-drawn pants of men who\nrest an instant in the midst of intense exertion. Then came again the\nclash and the slitherings; and one of them crossed into her view. She\nknew the tall figure and she saw the red hair: it was the king. Backward\nstep by step he seemed to be driven, coming nearer and nearer to the\ndoor. At last there was no more than a foot between him and her; only\nthe crazy panel prevented her putting out her hand to touch him. Again\nthe voice of Rupert rang out in rich exultation, \"I have you now! Say\nyour prayers, King Rudolf!\"\n\n\"Say your prayers!\" Then they fought. It was earnest, not play. And it\nwas the king--her king--her dear king, who was in great peril of his\nlife. For an instant she knelt, still watching. Then with a low cry of\nterror she turned and ran headlong down the steep stairs. Her mind could\nnot tell what to do, but her heart cried out that she must do something\nfor her king. Reaching the ground floor, she ran with wide-open eyes\ninto the kitchen. The stew was on the hob, the old woman still held the\nspoon, but she had ceased to stir and fallen into a chair.\n\n\"He's killing the king! He's killing the king!\" cried Rosa, seizing her\nmother by the arm. \"Mother, what shall we do? He's killing the king!\"\n\nThe old woman looked up with dull eyes and a stupid, cunning smile.\n\n\"Let them alone,\" she said. \"There's no king here.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. He's upstairs in the count's room. They're fighting, he and\nthe Count of Hentzau. Mother, Count Rupert will kill--\"\n\n\"Let them alone. He the king? He's no king,\" muttered the old woman\nagain.\n\nFor an instant Rosa stood looking down on her in helpless despair. Then\na light flashed into her eyes.\n\n\"I must call for help,\" she cried.\n\nThe old woman seemed to spring to sudden life. She jumped up and caught\nher daughter by the shoulder.\n\n\"No, no,\" she whispered in quick accents. \"You--you don't know. Let them\nalone, you fool! It's not our business. Let them alone.\"\n\n\"Let me go, mother, let me go! Mother, I must help the king!\"\n\n\"I'll not let you go,\" said Mother Holf.\n\nBut Rosa was young and strong; her heart was fired with terror for the\nking's danger.\n\n\"I must go,\" she cried; and she flung her mother's grasp off from her\nso that the old woman was thrown back into her chair, and the spoon fell\nfrom her hand and clattered on the tiles. But Rosa turned and fled\ndown the passage and through the shop. The bolts delayed her trembling\nfingers for an instant. Then she flung the door wide. A new amazement\nfilled her eyes at the sight of the eager crowd before the house.\nThen her eyes fell on me where I stood between the lieutenant and\nRischenheim, and she uttered her wild cry, \"Help! The king!\"\n\nWith one bound I was by her side and in the house, while Bernenstein\ncried, \"Quicker!\" from behind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE TRIUMPH OF THE KING\n\nTHE things that men call presages, presentiments, and so forth, are,\nto my mind, for the most part idle nothings: sometimes it is only that\nprobable events cast before them a natural shadow which superstitious\nfancy twists into a Heaven sent warning; oftener the same desire that\ngives conception works fulfilment, and the dreamer sees in the result\nof his own act and will a mysterious accomplishment independent of his\neffort. Yet when I observe thus calmly and with good sense on the matter\nto the Constable of Zenda, he shakes his head and answers, \"But Rudolf\nRassendyll knew from the first that he would come again to Strelsau and\nengage young Rupert point to point. Else why did he practise with the\nfoils so as to be a better swordsman the second time than he was\nthe first? Mayn't God do anything that Fritz von Tarlenheim can't\nunderstand? a pretty notion, on my life!\" And he goes off grumbling.\n\nWell, be it inspiration, or be it delusion--and the difference stands\noften on a hair's breadth--I am glad that Rudolf had it. For if a man\nonce grows rusty, it is everything short of impossible to put the fine\npolish on his skill again. Mr. Rassendyll had strength, will, coolness,\nand, of course, courage. None would have availed had not his eye been in\nperfect familiarity with its work, and his hand obeyed it as readily\nas the bolt slips in a well-oiled groove. As the thing stood, the lithe\nagility and unmatched dash of young Rupert but just missed being too\nmuch for him. He was in deadly peril when the girl Rosa ran down to\nbring him aid. His practised skill was able to maintain his defence. He\nsought to do no more, but endured Rupert's fiery attack and wily feints\nin an almost motionless stillness. Almost, I say; for the slight turns\nof wrist that seem nothing are everything, and served here to keep his\nskin whole and his life in him.\n\nThere was an instant--Rudolf saw it in his eyes and dwelt on it when he\nlightly painted the scene for me--when there dawned on Rupert of Hentzau\nthe knowledge that he could not break down his enemy's guard. Surprise,\nchagrin, amusement, or something like it, seemed blended in his look.\nHe could not make out how he was caught and checked in every effort,\nmeeting, it seemed, a barrier of iron impregnable in rest. His quick\nbrain grasped the lesson in an instant. If his skill were not the\ngreater, the victory would not be his, for his endurance was the less.\nHe was younger, and his frame was not so closely knit; pleasure had\ntaken its tithe from him; perhaps a good cause goes for something. Even\nwhile he almost pressed Rudolf against the panel of the door, he seemed\nto know that his measure of success was full. But what the hand could\nnot compass the head might contrive. In quickly conceived strategy he\nbegan to give pause in his attack, nay, he retreated a step or two. No\nscruples hampered his devices, no code of honor limited the means he\nwould employ. Backing before his opponent, he seemed to Rudolf to be\nfaint-hearted; he was baffled, but seemed despairing; he was weary, but\nplayed a more complete fatigue. Rudolf advanced, pressing and attacking,\nonly to meet a defence as perfect as his own. They were in the middle of\nthe room now, close by the table. Rupert, as though he had eyes in\nthe back of his head, skirted round, avoiding it by a narrow inch. His\nbreathing was quick and distressed, gasp tumbling over gasp, but still\nhis eye was alert and his hand unerring. He had but a few moments'\nmore effort left in him: it was enough if he could reach his goal and\nperpetrate the trick on which his mind, fertile in every base device,\nwas set. For it was towards the mantelpiece that his retreat, seeming\nforced, in truth so deliberate, led him. There was the letter, there\nlay the revolvers. The time to think of risks was gone by; the time to\nboggle over what honor allowed or forbade had never come to Rupert of\nHentzau. If he could not win by force and skill, he would win by guile\nand by treachery, to the test that he had himself invited. The revolvers\nlay on the mantelpiece: he meant to possess himself of one, if he could\ngain an instant in which to snatch it.\n\nThe device that he adopted was nicely chosen. It was too late to call\na rest or ask breathing space: Mr. Rassendyll was not blind to the\nadvantage he had won, and chivalry would have turned to folly had it\nallowed such indulgence. Rupert was hard by the mantelpiece now. The\nsweat was pouring from his face, and his breast seemed like to burst in\nthe effort after breath; yet he had enough strength for his purpose. He\nmust have slackened his hold on his weapon, for when Rudolf's blade next\nstruck it, it flew from his hand, twirled out of a nerveless grasp, and\nslid along the floor. Rupert stood disarmed, and Rudolf motionless.\n\n\"Pick it up,\" said Mr. Rassendyll, never thinking there had been a\ntrick.\n\n\"Ay, and you'll truss me while I do it.\"\n\n\"You young fool, don't you know me yet?\" and Rudolf, lowering his blade,\nrested its point on the floor, while with his left hand he indicated\nRupert's weapon. Yet something warned him: it may be there came a look\nin Rupert's eyes, perhaps of scorn for his enemy's simplicity, perhaps\nof pure triumph in the graceless knavery. Rudolf stood waiting.\n\n\"You swear you won't touch me while I pick it up?\" asked Rupert,\nshrinking back a little, and thereby getting an inch or two nearer the\nmantelpiece.\n\n\"You have my promise: pick it up. I won't wait any longer.\"\n\n\"You won't kill me unarmed?\" cried Rupert, in alarmed scandalized\nexpostulation.\n\n\"No; but--\"\n\nThe speech went unfinished, unless a sudden cry were its ending. And,\nas he cried, Rudolf Rassendyll, dropping his sword on the ground, sprang\nforward. For Rupert's hand had shot out behind him and was on the butt\nof one of the revolvers. The whole trick flashed on Rudolf, and he\nsprang, flinging his long arms round Rupert. But Rupert had the revolver\nin his hand.\n\nIn all likelihood the two neither heard nor heeded, though it seemed to\nme that the creaks and groans of the old stairs were loud enough to wake\nthe dead. For now Rosa had given the alarm, Bernenstein and I--or I and\nBernenstein (for I was first, and, therefore, may put myself first)--had\nrushed up. Hard behind us came Rischenheim, and hot on his heels a score\nof fellows, pushing and shouldering and trampling. We in front had a\nfair start, and gained the stairs unimpeded; Rischenheim was caught up\nin the ruck and gulfed in the stormy, tossing group that struggled for\nfirst footing on the steps. Yet, soon they were after us, and we heard\nthem reach the first landing as we sped up to the last. There was a\nconfused din through all the house, and it seemed now to echo muffled\nand vague through the walls from the street without. I was conscious of\nit, although I paid no heed to anything but reaching the room where\nthe king--where Rudolf--was. Now I was there, Bernenstein hanging to\nmy heels. The door did not hold us a second. I was in, he after me. He\nslammed the door and set his back against it, just as the rush of feet\nflooded the highest flight of stairs. And at the moment a revolver shot\nrang clear and loud.\n\nThe lieutenant and I stood still, he against the door, I a pace farther\ninto the room. The sight we saw was enough to arrest us with its strange\ninterest. The smoke of the shot was curling about, but neither man\nseemed wounded. The revolver was in Rupert's hand, and its muzzle\nsmoked. But Rupert was jammed against the wall, just by the side of\nthe mantelpiece. With one hand Rudolf had pinned his left arm to the\nwainscoting higher than his head, with the other he held his right\nwrist. I drew slowly nearer: if Rudolf were unarmed, I could fairly\nenforce a truce and put them on an equality; yet, though Rudolf was\nunarmed, I did nothing. The sight of his face stopped me. He was very\npale and his lips were set, but it was his eyes that caught my gaze, for\nthey were glad and merciless. I had never seen him look thus before. I\nturned from him to young Hentzau's face. Rupert's teeth were biting his\nunder lip, the sweat dropped, and the veins swelled large and blue on\nhis forehead; his eyes were set on Rudolf Rassendyll. Fascinated, I drew\nnearer. Then I saw what passed. Inch by inch Rupert's arm curved, the\nelbow bent, the hand that had pointed almost straight from him and at\nMr. Rassendyll pointed now away from both towards the window. But its\nmotion did not stop; it followed the line of a circle: now it was\non Rupert's arm; still it moved, and quicker now, for the power of\nresistance grew less. Rupert was beaten; he felt it and knew it, and I\nread the knowledge in his eyes. I stepped up to Rudolf Rassendyll. He\nheard or felt me, and turned his eyes for an instant. I do not know\nwhat my face said, but he shook his head and turned back to Rupert. The\nrevolver, held still in the man's own hand, was at his heart. The motion\nceased, the point was reached.\n\nI looked again at Rupert. Now his face was easier; there was a slight\nsmile on his lips; he flung back his comely head and rested thus against\nthe wainscoting; his eyes asked a question of Rudolf Rassendyll. I\nturned my gaze to where the answer was to come, for Rudolf made none in\nwords. By the swiftest of movements he shifted his grasp from Rupert's\nwrist and pounced on his hand. Now his forefinger rested on Rupert's and\nRupert's was on the trigger. I am no soft-heart, but I laid a hand on\nhis shoulder. He took no heed; I dared do no more. Rupert glanced at\nme. I caught his look, but what could I say to him? Again my eyes were\nriveted on Rudolf's finger. Now it was crooked round Rupert's, seeming\nlike a man who strangles another.\n\nI will not say more. He smiled to the last; his proud head, which\nhad never bent for shame, did not bend for fear. There was a sudden\ntightening in the pressure of that crooked forefinger, a flash, a noise.\nHe was held up against the wall for an instant by Rudolf's hand; when\nthat was removed he sank, a heap that looked all head and knees.\n\nBut hot on the sound of the discharge came a shout and an oath from\nBernenstein. He was hurled away from the door, and through it burst\nRischenheim and the whole score after him. They were jostling one\nanother and crying out to know what passed and where the king was. High\nover all the voices, coming from the back of the throng, I heard the cry\nof the girl Rosa. But as soon as they were in the room, the same spell\nthat had fastened Bernenstein and me to inactivity imposed its numbing\npower on them also. Only Rischenheim gave a sudden sob and ran forward\nto where his cousin lay. The rest stood staring. For a moment Rudolf\neyed them. Then, without a word, he turned his back. He put out the\nright hand with which he had just killed Rupert of Hentzau, and took the\nletter from the mantelpiece. He glanced at the envelope, then he opened\nthe letter. The handwriting banished any last doubt he had; he tore\nthe letter across, and again in four pieces, and yet again in smaller\nfragments. Then he sprinkled the morsels of paper into the blaze of the\nfire. I believe that every eye in the room followed them and watched\ntill they curled and crinkled into black, wafery ashes. Thus, at last\nthe queen's letter was safe.\n\nWhen he had thus set the seal on his task he turned round to us again.\nHe paid no heed to Rischenheim, who was crouching down by the body of\nRupert; but he looked at Bernenstein and me, and then at the people\nbehind us. He waited a moment before he spoke; then his utterance was\nnot only calm but also very slow, so that he seemed to be choosing his\nwords carefully.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"a full account of this matter will be rendered\nby myself in due time. For the present it must suffice to say that this\ngentleman who lies here dead sought an interview with me on private\nbusiness. I came here to find him, desiring, as he professed, to desire,\nprivacy. And here he tried to kill me. The result of his attempt you\nsee.\"\n\nI bowed low, Bernenstein did the like, and all the rest followed our\nexample.\n\n\"A full account shall be given,\" said Rudolf. \"Now let all leave me,\nexcept the Count of Tarlenheim and Lieutenant von Bernenstein.\"\n\nMost unwillingly, with gaping mouths and wonder-struck eyes, the throng\nfiled out of the door. Rischenheim rose to his feet.\n\n\"You stay, if you like,\" said Rudolf, and the count knelt again by his\nkinsman.\n\nSeeing the rough bedsteads by the wall of the attic, I touched\nRischenheim on the shoulder and pointed to one of them. Together we\nlifted Rupert of Hentzau. The revolver was still in his hand, but\nBernenstein disengaged it from his grasp. Then Rischenheim and I laid\nhim down, disposing his body decently and spreading over it his riding\ncloak, still spotted with the mud gathered on his midnight expedition to\nthe hunting-lodge. His face looked much as before the shot was fired;\nin death, as in life, he was the handsomest fellow in all Ruritania. I\nwager that many tender hearts ached and many bright eyes were dimmed for\nhim when the news of his guilt and death went forth. There are ladies\nstill in Strelsau who wear his trinkets in an ashamed devotion that\ncannot forget. Well, even I, who had every good cause to hate and scorn\nhim, set the hair smooth on his brow; while Rischenheim was sobbing like\na child, and young Bernenstein rested his head on his arm as he leant on\nthe mantelpiece, and would not look at the dead. Rudolf alone seemed not\nto heed him or think of him. His eyes had lost their unnatural look of\njoy, and were now calm and tranquil. He took his own revolver from the\nmantelpiece and put it in his pocket, laying Rupert's neatly where his\nhad been. Then he turned to me and said:\n\n\"Come, let us go to the queen and tell her that the letter is beyond\nreach of hurt.\"\n\nMoved by some impulse, I walked to the window and put my head out. I\nwas seen from below, and a great shout greeted me. The crowd before the\ndoors grew every moment; the people flocking from all quarters would\nsoon multiply it a hundred fold; for such news as had been carried from\nthe attic by twenty wondering tongues spreads like a forest-fire. It\nwould be through Strelsau in a few minutes, through the kingdom in\nan hour, through Europe in but little longer. Rupert was dead and\nthe letter was safe, but what were we to tell that great concourse\nconcerning their king? A queer feeling of helpless perplexity came over\nme and found vent in a foolish laugh. Bernenstein was by my side; he\nalso looked out, and turned again with an eager face.\n\n\"You'll have a royal progress to your palace,\" said he to Rudolf\nRassendyll.\n\nMr. Rassendyll made no answer, but, coming to me, took my arm. We\nwent out, leaving Rischenheim by the body. I did not think of him;\nBernenstein probably thought that he would keep his pledge given to\nthe queen, for he followed us immediately and without demur. There was\nnobody outside the door. The house was very quiet, and the tumult from\nthe street reached us only in a muffled roar. But when we came to the\nfoot of the stairs we found the two women. Mother Holf stood on the\nthreshold of the kitchen, looking amazed and terrified. Rosa was\nclinging to her; but as soon as Rudolf came in sight, the girl\nsprang forward and flung herself on her knees before him, pouring out\nincoherent thanks to Heaven for his safety. He bent down and spoke to\nher in a whisper; she looked up with a flush of pride on her face. He\nseemed to hesitate a moment; he glanced at his hands, but he wore\nno ring save that which the queen had given him long ago. Then he\ndisengaged his chain and took his gold watch from his pocket. Turning it\nover, he showed me the monogram, R. R.\n\n\"Rudolfus Rex,\" he whispered with a whimsical smile, and pressed the\nwatch into the girl's hand, saying: \"Keep this to remind you of me.\"\n\nShe laughed and sobbed as she caught it with one hand, while with the\nother she held his.\n\n\"You must let go,\" he said gently. \"I have much to do.\"\n\nI took her by the arm and induced her to rise. Rudolf, released, passed\non to where the old woman stood. He spoke to her in a stern, distinct\nvoice.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"how far you are a party to the plot that was\nhatched in your house. For the present I am content not to know, for it\nis no pleasure to me to detect disloyalty or to punish an old woman. But\ntake care! The first word you speak, the first act you do against me,\nthe king, will bring its certain and swift punishment. If you trouble\nme, I won't spare you. In spite of traitors I am still king in\nStrelsau.\"\n\nHe paused, looking hard in her face. Her lip quivered and her eyes fell.\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated, \"I am king in Strelsau. Keep your hands out of\nmischief and your tongue quiet.\"\n\nShe made no answer. He passed on. I was following, but as I went by\nher the old woman clutched my arm. \"In God's name, who is he?\" she\nwhispered.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" I asked, lifting my brows. \"Don't you know the king when\nhe speaks to you? And you'd best remember what he said. He has servants\nwho'll do his orders.\"\n\nShe let me go and fell back a step. Young Bernenstein smiled at her; he\nat least found more pleasure than anxiety in our position. Thus, then,\nwe left them: the old woman terrified, amazed, doubtful; the girl with\nruddy cheeks and shining eyes, clasping in her two hands the keepsake\nthat the king himself had given her.\n\nBernenstein had more presence of mind than I. He ran forward, got in\nfront of both of us, and flung the door open. Then, bowing very low, he\nstood aside to let Rudolf pass. The street was full from end to end now,\nand a mighty shout of welcome rose from thousands of throats. Hats and\nhandkerchiefs were waved in mad exultation and triumphant loyalty. The\ntidings of the king's escape had flashed through the city, and all were\nthere to do him honor. They had seized some gentleman's landau and taken\nout the horses. The carriage stood now before the doors of the house.\nRudolf had waited a moment on the threshold, lifting his hat once or\ntwice; his face was perfectly calm, and I saw no trembling in his hands.\nIn an instant a dozen arms took gentle hold of him and impelled him\nforward. He mounted into the carriage; Bernenstein and I followed, with\nbare heads, and sat on the back seat, facing him. The people were round\nas thick as bees, and it seemed as though we could not move without\ncrushing somebody. Yet presently the wheels turned, and they began to\ndrag us away at a slow walk. Rudolf kept raising his hat, bowing now to\nright, now to left. But once, as he turned, his eyes met ours. In spite\nof what was behind and what was in front, we all three smiled.\n\n\"I wish they'd go a little quicker,\" said Rudolf in a whisper, as he\nconquered his smile and turned again to acknowledge the loyal greetings\nof his subjects.\n\nBut what did they know of any need for haste? They did not know what\nstood on the turn of the next few hours, nor the momentous question that\npressed for instant decision. So far from hurrying, they lengthened our\nride by many pauses; they kept us before the cathedral, while some ran\nand got the joy bells set ringing; we were stopped to receive improvised\nbouquets from the hands of pretty girls and impetuous hand-shakings from\nenthusiastic loyalists. Through it all Rudolf kept his composure, and\nseemed to play his part with native kingliness. I heard Bernenstein\nwhisper, \"By God, we must stick to it!\"\n\nAt last we came in sight of the palace. Here also there was a great\nstir. Many officers and soldiers were about. I saw the chancellor's\ncarriage standing near the portico, and a dozen other handsome equipages\nwere waiting till they could approach. Our human horses drew us slowly\nup to the entrance. Helsing was on the steps, and ran down to the\ncarriage, greeting the king with passionate fervor. The shouts of the\ncrowd grew louder still.\n\nBut suddenly a stillness fell on them; it lasted but an instant, and\nwas the prelude to a deafening roar. I was looking at Rudolf and saw his\nhead turn suddenly and his eyes grow bright. I looked where his eyes\nhad gone. There, on the top step of the broad marble flight, stood\nthe queen, pale as the marble itself, stretching out her hands towards\nRudolf. The people had seen her: she it was whom this last rapturous\ncheer greeted. My wife stood close behind her, and farther back others\nof her ladies. Bernenstein and I sprang out. With a last salute to the\npeople Rudolf followed us. He walked up to the highest step but one, and\nthere fell on one knee and kissed the queen's hand. I was by him, and\nwhen he looked up in her face I heard him say:\n\n\"All's well. He's dead, and the letter burnt.\"\n\nShe raised him with her hand. Her lips moved, but it seemed as though\nshe could find no words to speak. She put her arm through his, and thus\nthey stood for an instant, fronting all Strelsau. Again the cheers rang\nout, and young Bernenstein sprang forward, waving his helmet and crying\nlike a man possessed, \"God save the king!\" I was carried away by his\nenthusiasm and followed his lead. All the people took up the cry with\nboundless fervor, and thus we all, high and low in Strelsau, that\nafternoon hailed Mr. Rassendyll for our king. There had been no such\nzeal since Henry the Lion came back from his wars, a hundred and fifty\nyears ago.\n\n\"And yet,\" observed old Helsing at my elbow, \"agitators say that there\nis no enthusiasm for the house of Elphberg!\" He took a pinch of snuff in\nscornful satisfaction.\n\nYoung Bernenstein interrupted his cheering with a short laugh, but fell\nto his task again in a moment. I had recovered my senses by now, and\nstood panting, looking down on the crowd. It was growing dusk and the\nfaces became blurred into a white sea. Yet suddenly I seemed to discern\none glaring up at me from the middle of the crowd--the pale face of\na man with a bandage about his head. I caught Bernenstein's arm and\nwhispered, \"Bauer,\" pointing with my finger where the face was. But,\neven as I pointed, it was gone; though it seemed impossible for a man to\nmove in that press, yet it was gone. It had come like a cynic's warning\nacross the scene of mock triumph, and went swiftly as it had come,\nleaving behind it a reminder of our peril. I felt suddenly sick at\nheart, and almost cried out to the people to have done with their silly\nshouting.\n\nAt last we got away. The plea of fatigue met all visitors who made their\nway to the door and sought to offer their congratulations; it could not\ndisperse the crowd that hung persistently and contentedly about, ringing\nus in the palace with a living fence. We still heard their jests and\ncheers when we were alone in the small saloon that opens on the gardens.\nMy wife and I had come here at Rudolf's request; Bernenstein had assumed\nthe duty of guarding the door. Evening was now falling fast, and it grew\ndark. The garden was quiet; the distant noise of the crowd threw its\nstillness into greater relief. Rudolf told us there the story of his\nstruggle with Rupert of Hentzau in the attic of the old house, dwelling\non it as lightly as he could. The queen stood by his chair--she would\nnot let him rise; when he finished by telling how he had burnt her\nletter, she stooped suddenly and kissed him off the brow. Then she\nlooked straight across at Helga, almost defiantly; but Helga ran to her\nand caught her in her arms.\n\nRudolf Rassendyll sat with his head resting on his hand. He looked up\nonce at the two women; then he caught my eye, and beckoned me to come to\nhim. I approached him, but for several moments he did not speak. Again\nhe motioned to me, and, resting my hand on the arm of his chair, I bent\nmy head close down to his. He glanced again at the queen, seeming afraid\nthat she would hear what he wished to say.\n\n\"Fritz,\" he whispered at last, \"as soon as it's fairly dark I must get\naway. Bernenstein will come with me. You must stay here.\"\n\n\"Where can you go?\"\n\n\"To the lodge. I must meet Sapt and arrange matters with him.\"\n\nI did not understand what plan he had in his head, or what scheme he\ncould contrive. But at the moment my mind was not directed to such\nmatters; it was set on the sight before my eyes.\n\n\"And the queen?\" I whispered in answer to him.\n\nLow as my voice was, she heard it. She turned to us with a sudden,\nstartled movement, still holding Helga's hand. Her eyes searched our\nfaces, and she knew in an instant of what we had been speaking. A little\nlonger still she stood, gazing at us. Then she suddenly sprang forward\nand threw herself on her knees before Rudolf, her hands uplifted and\nresting on his shoulders. She forgot our presence, and everything in the\nworld, save her great dread of losing him again.\n\n\"Not again, Rudolf, my darling! Not again! Rudolf, I can't bear it\nagain.\"\n\nThen she dropped her head on his knees and sobbed.\n\nHe raised his hand and gently stroked the gleaming hair. But he did not\nlook at her. He gazed out at the garden, which grew dark and dreary\nin the gathering gloom. His lips were tight set and his face pale and\ndrawn.\n\nI watched him for a moment, then I drew my wife away, and we sat down at\na table some way off. From outside still came the cheers and tumult of\nthe joyful, excited crowd. Within there was no sound but the queen's\nstifled sobbing. Rudolf caressed her shining hair and gazed into the\nnight with sad, set eyes. She raised her head and looked into his face.\n\n\"You'll break my heart,\" she said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. FOR OUR LOVE AND HER HONOR\n\nRUPERT of Hentzau was dead! That was the thought which, among all our\nperplexities, came back to me, carrying with it a wonderful relief.\nTo those who have not learnt in fighting against him the height of his\naudacity and the reach of his designs, it may well seem incredible that\nhis death should breed comfort at a moment when the future was still\nso dark and uncertain. Yet to me it was so great a thing that I could\nhardly bring myself to the conviction that we had done with him. True,\nhe was dead; but could he not strike a blow at us even from beyond the\ngulf?\n\nSuch were the half-superstitious thoughts that forced their way into my\nmind as I stood looking out on the crowd which obstinately encircled the\nfront of the palace. I was alone; Rudolf was with the queen, my wife was\nresting, Bernenstein had sat down to a meal for which I could find\nno appetite. By an effort I freed myself from my fancies and tried to\nconcentrate my brain on the facts of our position. We were ringed round\nwith difficulties. To solve them was beyond my power; but I knew where\nmy wish and longing lay. I had no desire to find means by which Rudolf\nRassendyll should escape unknown from Strelsau; the king, although\ndead, be again in death the king, and the queen be left desolate on her\nmournful and solitary throne. It might be that a brain more astute than\nmine could bring all this to pass. My imagination would have none of\nit, but dwelt lovingly on the reign of him who was now king in Strelsau,\ndeclaring that to give the kingdom such a ruler would be a splendid\nfraud, and prove a stroke so bold as to defy detection. Against it\nstood only the suspicions of Mother Holf--fear or money would close her\nlips--and the knowledge of Bauer; Bauer's mouth also could be shut, ay,\nand should be before we were many days older. My reverie led me far;\nI saw the future years unroll before me in the fair record of a great\nking's sovereignty. It seemed to me that by the violence and bloodshed\nwe had passed through, fate, for once penitent, was but righting the\nmistake made when Rudolf was not born a king.\n\nFor a long while I stood thus, musing and dreaming; I was roused by the\nsound of the door opening and closing; turning, I saw the queen. She was\nalone, and came towards me with timid steps. She looked out for a moment\non the square and the people, but drew back suddenly in apparent fear\nlest they should see her. Then she sat down and turned her face towards\nmine. I read in her eyes something of the conflict of emotions which\npossessed her; she seemed at once to deprecate my disapproval and to\nask my sympathy; she prayed me to be gentle to her fault and kind to her\nhappiness; self-reproach shadowed her joy, but the golden gleam of it\nstrayed through. I looked eagerly at her; this would not have been her\nbearing had she come from a last farewell; for the radiance was there,\nhowever much dimmed by sorrow and by fearfulness.\n\n\"Fritz,\" she began softly, \"I am wicked--so wicked. Won't God punish me\nfor my gladness?\"\n\nI fear I paid little heed to her trouble, though I can understand it\nwell enough now.\n\n\"Gladness?\" I cried in a low voice. \"Then you've persuaded him?\"\n\nShe smiled at me for an instant.\n\n\"I mean, you've agreed?\" I stammered.\n\nHer eyes again sought mine, and she said in a whisper: \"Some day, not\nnow. Oh, not now. Now would be too much. But some day, Fritz, if God\nwill not deal too hardly with me, I--I shall be his, Fritz.\"\n\nI was intent on my vision, not on hers. I wanted him king; she did not\ncare what he was, so that he was hers, so that he should not leave her.\n\n\"He'll take the throne,\" I cried triumphantly.\n\n\"No, no, no. Not the throne. He's going away.\"\n\n\"Going away!\" I could not keep the dismay out of my voice.\n\n\"Yes, now. But not--not for ever. It will be long--oh, so long--but I\ncan bear it, if I know that at last!\" She stopped, still looking up at\nme with eyes that implored pardon and sympathy.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said I, bluntly, and, I fear, gruffly, also.\n\n\"You were right,\" she said: \"I did persuade him. He wanted to go away\nagain as he went before. Ought I to have let him? Yes, yes! But I\ncouldn't. Fritz, hadn't I done enough? You don't know what I've endured.\nAnd I must endure more still. For he will go now, and the time will be\nvery long. But, at last, we shall be together. There is pity in God; we\nshall be together at last.\"\n\n\"If he goes now, how can he come back?\"\n\n\"He will not come back; I shall go to him. I shall give up the throne\nand go to him, some day, when I can be spared from here, when I've done\nmy--my work.\"\n\nI was aghast at this shattering of my vision, yet I could not be hard to\nher. I said nothing, but took her hand and pressed it.\n\n\"You wanted him to be king?\" she whispered.\n\n\"With all my heart, madam,\" said I.\n\n\"He wouldn't, Fritz. No, and I shouldn't dare to do that, either.\"\n\nI fell back on the practical difficulties. \"But how can he go?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know. But he knows; he has a plan.\"\n\nWe fell again into silence; her eyes grew more calm, and seemed to look\nforward in patient hope to the time when her happiness should come to\nher. I felt like a man suddenly robbed of the exaltation of wine and\nsunk to dull apathy. \"I don't see how he can go,\" I said sullenly.\n\nShe did not answer me. A moment later the door again opened. Rudolf came\nin, followed by Bernenstein. Both wore riding boots and cloaks. I saw on\nBernenstein's face just such a look of disappointment as I knew must be\non mine. Rudolf seemed calm and even happy. He walked straight up to the\nqueen.\n\n\"The horses will be ready in a few minutes,\" he said gently. Then,\nturning to me, he asked, \"You know what we're going to do, Fritz?\"\n\n\"Not I, sire,\" I answered, sulkily.\n\n\"Not I, sire!\" he repeated, in a half-merry, half-sad mockery. Then he\ncame between Bernenstein and me and passed his arms through ours. \"You\ntwo villains!\" he said. \"You two unscrupulous villains! Here you are,\nas rough as bears, because I won't be a thief! Why have I killed young\nRupert and left you rogues alive?\"\n\nI felt the friendly pressure of his hand on my arm. I could not answer\nhim. With every word from his lips and every moment of his presence my\nsorrow grew keener that he would not stay. Bernenstein looked across at\nme and shrugged his shoulders despairingly. Rudolf gave a little laugh.\n\n\"You won't forgive me for not being as great a rogue, won't you?\" he\nasked.\n\nWell, I found nothing to say, but I took my arm out of his and clasped\nhis hand. He gripped mine hard.\n\n\"That's old Fritz!\" he said; and he caught hold of Bernenstein's hand,\nwhich the lieutenant yielded with some reluctance. \"Now for the\nplan,\" said he. \"Bernenstein and I set out at once for the lodge--yes,\npublicly, as publicly as we can. I shall ride right through the people\nthere, showing myself to as many as will look at me, and letting it\nbe known to everybody where I'm going. We shall get there quite early\nto-morrow, before it's light. There we shall find what you know. We\nshall find Sapt, too, and he'll put the finishing touches to our plan\nfor us. Hullo, what's that?\"\n\nThere was a sudden fresh shouting from the large crowd that still\nlingered outside the palace. I ran to the window, and saw a commotion in\nthe midst of them. I flung the sash up. Then I heard a well-known, loud,\nstrident voice: \"Make way, you rascals, make way.\"\n\nI turned round again, full of excitement.\n\n\"It's Sapt himself!\" I said. \"He's riding like mad through the crowd,\nand your servant's just behind him.\"\n\n\"My God, what's happened? Why have they left the lodge?\" cried\nBernenstein.\n\nThe queen looked up in startled alarm, and, rising to her feet, came\nand passed her arm through Rudolf's. Thus we all stood, listening to\nthe people good-naturedly cheering Sapt, whom they had recognized, and\nbantering James, whom they took for a servant of the constable's.\n\nThe minutes seemed very long as we waited in utter perplexity, almost in\nconsternation. The same thought was in the mind of all of us, silently\nimparted by one to another in the glances we exchanged. What could have\nbrought them from their guard of the great secret, save its discovery?\nThey would never have left their post while the fulfilment of their\ntrust was possible. By some mishap, some unforeseen chance, the king's\nbody must have been discovered. Then the king's death was known, and the\nnews of it might any moment astonish and bewilder the city.\n\nAt last the door was flung open, and a servant announced the Constable\nof Zenda. Sapt was covered with dust and mud, and James, who entered\nclose on his heels, was in no better plight. Evidently they had ridden\nhard and furiously; indeed they were still panting. Sapt, with a most\nperfunctory bow to the queen, came straight to where Rudolf stood.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" he asked, without preface.\n\n\"Yes, Rupert is dead,\" answered Mr. Rassendyll: \"I killed him.\"\n\n\"And the letter?\"\n\n\"I burnt it.\"\n\n\"And Rischenheim?\"\n\nThe queen struck in.\n\n\"The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim will say and do nothing against me,\" she\nsaid.\n\nSapt lifted his brows a little. \"Well, and Bauer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bauer's at large,\" I answered.\n\n\"Hum! Well, it's only Bauer,\" said the constable, seeming tolerably well\npleased. Then his eyes fell on Rudolf and Bernenstein. He stretched out\nhis hand and pointed to their riding-boots. \"Whither away so late at\nnight?\" he asked.\n\n\"First together to the lodge, to find you, then I alone to the\nfrontier,\" said Mr. Rassendyll.\n\n\"One thing at a time. The frontier will wait. What does your Majesty\nwant with me at the lodge?\"\n\n\"I want so to contrive that I shall be no longer your Majesty,\" said\nRudolf.\n\nSapt flung himself into a chair and took off his gloves.\n\n\"Come, tell me what has happened to-day in Strelsau,\" he said.\n\nWe gave a short and hurried account. He listened with few signs of\napproval or disapproval, but I thought I saw a gleam in his eyes when I\ndescribed how all the city had hailed Rudolf as its king and the queen\nreceived him as her husband before the eyes of all. Again the hope and\nvision, shattered by Rudolf's calm resolution, inspired me. Sapt said\nlittle, but he had the air of a man with some news in reserve. He seemed\nto be comparing what we told him with something already known to him\nbut unknown to us. The little servant stood all the while in respectful\nstillness by the door; but I could see by a glance at his alert face\nthat he followed the whole scene with keen attention.\n\nAt the end of the story, Rudolf turned to Sapt. \"And your secret--is it\nsafe?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ay, it's safe enough!\"\n\n\"Nobody has seen what you had to hide?\"\n\n\"No; and nobody knows that the king is dead,\" answered Sapt.\n\n\"Then what brings you here?\"\n\n\"Why, the same thing that was about to bring you to the lodge: the need\nof a meeting between yourself and me, sire.\"\n\n\"But the lodge--is it left unguarded?\"\n\n\"The lodge is safe enough,\" said Colonel Sapt.\n\nUnquestionably there was a secret, a new secret, hidden behind the curt\nwords and brusque manner. I could restrain myself no longer, and sprang\nforward, saying: \"What is it? Tell us, Constable!\"\n\nHe looked at me, then glanced at Mr. Rassendyll.\n\n\"I should like to hear your plan first,\" he said to Rudolf. \"How do you\nmean to account for your presence alive in the city to-day, when the\nking has lain dead in the shooting-box since last night?\"\n\nWe drew close together as Rudolf began his answer. Sapt alone lay back\nin his chair. The queen also had resumed her seat; she seemed to pay\nlittle heed to what we said. I think that she was still engrossed with\nthe struggle and tumult in her own soul. The sin of which she accused\nherself, and the joy to which her whole being sprang in a greeting which\nwould not be abashed, were at strife between themselves, but joined\nhands to exclude from her mind any other thought.\n\n\"In an hour I must be gone from here,\" began Rudolf.\n\n\"If you wish that, it's easy,\" observed Colonel Sapt.\n\n\"Come, Sapt, be reasonable,\" smiled Mr. Rassendyll. \"Early to-morrow,\nwe--you and I--\"\n\n\"Oh, I also?\" asked the colonel.\n\n\"Yes; you, Bernenstein, and I will be at the lodge.\"\n\n\"That's not impossible, though I have had nearly enough riding.\"\n\nRudolf fixed his eyes firmly on Sapt's.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"the king reaches his hunting-lodge early in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I follow you, sire.\"\n\n\"And what happens there, Sapt? Does he shoot himself accidentally?\"\n\n\"Well, that happens sometimes.\"\n\n\"Or does an assassin kill him?\"\n\n\"Eh, but you've made the best assassin unavailable.\"\n\nEven at this moment I could not help smiling at the old fellow's surly\nwit and Rudolf's amused tolerance of it.\n\n\"Or does his faithful attendant, Herbert, shoot him?\"\n\n\"What, make poor Herbert a murderer!\"\n\n\"Oh, no! By accident--and then, in remorse, kill himself.\"\n\n\"That's very pretty. But doctors have awkward views as to when a man can\nhave shot himself.\"\n\n\"My good Constable, doctors have palms as well as ideas. If you fill the\none you supply the other.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sapt, \"that both the plans are good. Suppose we choose\nthe latter, what then?\"\n\n\"Why, then, by to-morrow at midday the news flashes through\nRuritania--yes, and through Europe--that the king, miraculously\npreserved to-day--\"\n\n\"Praise be to God!\" interjected Colonel Sapt; and young Bernenstein\nlaughed.\n\n\"Has met a tragic end.\"\n\n\"It will occasion great grief,\" said Sapt.\n\n\"Meanwhile, I am safe over the frontier.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are quite safe?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. And in the afternoon of to-morrow, you and Bernenstein\nwill set out for Strelsau, bringing with you the body of the king.\" And\nRudolf, after a pause, whispered, \"You must shave his face. And if the\ndoctors want to talk about how long he's been dead, why, they have, as I\nsay, palms.\"\n\nSapt sat silent for a while, apparently considering the scheme. It was\nrisky enough in all conscience, but success had made Rudolf bold, and\nhe had learnt how slow suspicion is if a deception be bold enough. It is\nonly likely frauds that are detected.\n\n\"Well, what do you say?\" asked Mr. Rassendyll. I observed that he\nsaid nothing to Sapt of what the queen and he had determined to do\nafterwards.\n\nSapt wrinkled his forehead. I saw him glance at James, and the\nslightest, briefest smile showed on James's face.\n\n\"It's dangerous, of course,\" pursued Rudolf. \"But I believe that when\nthey see the king's body--\"\n\n\"That's the point,\" interrupted Sapt. \"They can't see the king's body.\"\n\nRudolf looked at him with some surprise. Then speaking in a low voice,\nlest the queen should hear and be distressed, he went on: \"You must\nprepare it, you know. Bring it here in a shell; only a few officials\nneed see the face.\"\n\nSapt rose to his feet and stood facing Mr. Rassendyll.\n\n\"The plan's a pretty one, but it breaks down at one point,\" said he in a\nstrange voice, even harsher than his was wont to be. I was on fire with\nexcitement, for I would have staked my life now that he had some strange\ntidings for us. \"There is no body,\" said he.\n\nEven Mr. Rassendyll's composure gave way. He sprang forward, catching\nSapt by the arm.\n\n\"No body? What do you mean?\" he exclaimed.\n\nSapt cast another glance at James, and then began in an even, mechanical\nvoice, as though he were reading a lesson he had learnt, or playing a\npart that habit made familiar:\n\n\"That poor fellow Herbert carelessly left a candle burning where the oil\nand the wood were kept,\" he said. \"This afternoon, about six, James and\nI lay down for a nap after our meal. At about seven James came to my\nside and roused me. My room was full of smoke. The lodge was ablaze. I\ndarted out of bed: the fire had made too much headway; we could not hope\nto quench it; we had but one thought!\" He suddenly paused, and looked at\nJames.\n\n\"But one thought, to save our companion,\" said James gravely.\n\n\"But one thought, to save our companion. We rushed to the door of the\nroom where he was. I opened the door and tried to enter. It was certain\ndeath. James tried, but fell back. Again I rushed in. James pulled me\nback: it was but another death. We had to save ourselves. We gained the\nopen air. The lodge was a sheet of flame. We could do nothing but stand\nwatching, till the swiftly burning wood blackened to ashes and the\nflames died down. As we watched we knew that all in the cottage must be\ndead. What could we do? At last James started off in the hope of getting\nhelp. He found a party of charcoal-burners, and they came with him.\nThe flames were burnt down now; and we and they approached the charred\nruins. Everything was in ashes. But\"--he lowered his voice--\"we found\nwhat seemed to be the body of Boris the hound; in another room was a\ncharred corpse, whose hunting-horn, melted to a molten mass, told us\nthat it had been Herbert the forester. And there was another\ncorpse, almost shapeless, utterly unrecognizable. We saw it; the\ncharcoal-burners saw it. Then more peasants came round, drawn by the\nsight of the flames. None could tell who it was; only I and James knew.\nAnd we mounted our horses and have ridden here to tell the king.\"\n\nSapt finished his lesson or his story. A sob burst from the queen, and\nshe hid her face in her hands. Bernenstein and I, amazed at this strange\ntale, scarcely understanding whether it were jest or earnest, stood\nstaring stupidly at Sapt. Then I, overcome by the strange thing, turned\nhalf-foolish by the bizarre mingling of comedy and impressiveness in\nSapt's rendering of it, plucked him by the sleeve, and asked, with\nsomething between a laugh and a gasp:\n\n\"Who had that other corpse been, Constable?\"\n\nHe turned his small, keen eyes on me in persistent gravity and\nunflinching effrontery.\n\n\"A Mr. Rassendyll, a friend of the king's, who with his servant James\nwas awaiting his Majesty's return from Strelsau. His servant here is\nready to start for England, to tell Mr. Rassendyll's relatives the\nnews.\"\n\nThe queen had begun to listen before now; her eyes were fixed on Sapt,\nand she had stretched out one arm to him, as if imploring him to read\nher his riddle. But a few words had in truth declared his device plainly\nenough in all its simplicity. Rudolf Rassendyll was dead, his body\nburnt to a cinder, and the king was alive, whole, and on his throne in\nStrelsau. Thus had Sapt caught from James, the servant, the infection of\nhis madness, and had fulfilled in action the strange imagination which\nthe little man had unfolded to him in order to pass their idle hours at\nthe lodge.\n\nSuddenly Mr. Rassendyll spoke in clear, short tones.\n\n\"This is all a lie, Sapt,\" said he, and his lips curled in contemptuous\namusement.\n\n\"It's no lie that the lodge is burnt, and the bodies in it, and that\nhalf a hundred of the peasants know it, and that no man could tell the\nbody for the king's. As for the rest, it is a lie. But I think the truth\nin it is enough to serve.\"\n\nThe two men stood facing one another with defiant eyes. Rudolf had\ncaught the meaning of the great and audacious trick which Sapt and his\ncompanion had played. It was impossible now to bring the king's body to\nStrelsau; it seemed no less impossible to declare that the man burnt in\nthe lodge was the king. Thus Sapt had forced Rudolf's hand; he had been\ninspired by the same vision as we, and endowed with more unshrinking\nboldness. But when I saw how Rudolf looked at him, I did not know but\nthat they would go from the queen's presence set on a deadly quarrel.\nMr. Rassendyll, however, mastered his temper.\n\n\"You're all bent on having me a rascal,\" he said coldly. \"Fritz and\nBernenstein here urge me; you, Sapt, try to force me. James, there, is\nin the plot, for all I know.\"\n\n\"I suggested it, sir,\" said James, not defiantly or with disrespect, but\nas if in simple dutiful obedience to his master's implied question.\n\n\"As I thought--all of you! Well, I won't be forced. I see now that\nthere's no way out of this affair, save one. That one I'll follow.\"\n\nWe none of us spoke, but waited till he should be pleased to continue.\n\n\"Of the queen's letter I need say nothing and will say nothing,\"\nhe pursued. \"But I will tell them that I'm not the king, but Rudolf\nRassendyll, and that I played the king only in order to serve the queen\nand punish Rupert of Hentzau. That will serve, and it will cut this net\nof Sapt's from about my limbs.\"\n\nHe spoke firmly and coldly; so that when I looked at him I was amazed\nto see how his lips twitched and that his forehead was moist with sweat.\nThen I understood what a sudden, swift, and fearful struggle he had\nsuffered, and how the great temptation had wrung and tortured him before\nhe, victorious, had set the thing behind him. I went to him and clasped\nhis hand: this action of mine seemed to soften him.\n\n\"Sapt, Sapt,\" he said, \"you almost made a rogue of me.\"\n\nSapt did not respond to his gentler mood. He had been pacing angrily up\nand down the room. Now he stopped abruptly before Rudolf, and pointed\nwith his finger at the queen.\n\n\"I make a rogue of you?\" he exclaimed. \"And what do you make of our\nqueen, whom we all serve? What does this truth that you'll tell make\nof her? Haven't I heard how she greeted you before all Strelsau as\nher husband and her love? Will they believe that she didn't know her\nhusband? Ay, you may show yourself, you may say they didn't know you.\nWill they believe she didn't? Was the king's ring on your finger? Where\nis it? And how comes Mr. Rassendyll to be at Fritz von Tarlenheim's for\nhours with the queen, when the king is at his hunting lodge? A king\nhas died already, and two men besides, to save a word against her. And\nyou--you'll be the man to set every tongue in Strelsau talking, and\nevery finger pointing in suspicion at her?\"\n\nRudolf made no answer. When Sapt had first uttered the queen's name, he\nhad drawn near and let his hand fall over the back of her chair. She put\nhers up to meet it, and so they remained. But I saw that Rudolf's face\nhad gone very pale.\n\n\"And we, your friends?\" pursued Sapt. \"For we've stood by you as we've\nstood by the queen, by God we have--Fritz, and young Bernenstein here,\nand I. If this truth's told, who'll believe that we were loyal to the\nking, that we didn't know, that we weren't accomplices in the tricking\nof the king--maybe, in his murder? Ah, Rudolf Rassendyll, God preserve\nme from a conscience that won't let me be true to the woman I love, or\nto the friends who love me!\"\n\nI had never seen the old fellow so moved; he carried me with him, as he\ncarried Bernenstein. I know now that we were too ready to be convinced;\nrather that, borne along by our passionate desire, we needed no\nconvincing at all. His excited appeal seemed to us an argument. At least\nthe danger to the queen, on which he dwelt, was real and true and great.\n\nThen a sudden change came over him. He caught Rudolf's hand and spoke to\nhim again in a low, broken voice, an unwonted softness transforming his\nharsh tones.\n\n\"Lad,\" he said, \"don't say no. Here's the finest lady alive sick for her\nlover, and the finest country in the world sick for its true king, and\nthe best friends--ay, by Heaven, the best friends--man ever had, sick to\ncall you master. I know nothing about your conscience; but this I know:\nthe king's dead, and the place is empty; and I don't see what Almighty\nGod sent you here for unless it was to fill it. Come, lad--for our love\nand her honor! While he was alive I'd have killed you sooner than let\nyou take it. He's dead. Now--for our love and her honor, lad!\"\n\nI do not know what thoughts passed in Mr. Rassendyll's mind. His face\nwas set and rigid. He made no sign when Sapt finished, but stood as\nhe was, motionless, for a long while. Then he slowly bent his head and\nlooked down into the queen's eyes. For a while she sat looking back into\nhis. Then, carried away by the wild hope of immediate joy, and by her\nlove for him and her pride in the place he was offered, she sprang up\nand threw herself at his feet, crying:\n\n\"Yes, yes! For my sake, Rudolf--for my sake!\"\n\n\"Are you, too, against me, my queen?\" he murmured caressing her ruddy\nhair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE DECISION OF HEAVEN\n\nWE were half mad that night, Sapt and Bernenstein and I. The thing\nseemed to have got into our blood and to have become part of ourselves.\nFor us it was inevitable--nay, it was done. Sapt busied himself in\npreparing the account of the fire at the hunting-lodge; it was to be\ncommunicated to the journals, and it told with much circumstantiality\nhow Rudolf Rassendyll had come to visit the king, with James his\nservant, and, the king being summoned unexpectedly to the capital, had\nbeen awaiting his Majesty's return when he met his fate. There was a\nshort history of Rudolf, a glancing reference to his family, a dignified\nexpression of condolence with his relatives, to whom the king was\nsending messages of deepest regret by the hands of Mr. Rassendyll's\nservant. At another table young Bernenstein was drawing up, under the\nconstable's direction, a narrative of Rupert of Hentzau's attempt on\nthe king's life and the king's courage in defending himself. The count,\neager to return (so it ran), had persuaded the king to meet him by\ndeclaring that he held a state-document of great importance and of a\nmost secret nature; the king, with his habitual fearlessness, had gone\nalone, but only to refuse with scorn Count Rupert's terms. Enraged at\nthis unfavorable reception, the audacious criminal had made a sudden\nattack on the king, with what issue all knew. He had met his own\ndeath, while the king, perceiving from a glance at the document that it\ncompromised well-known persons, had, with the nobility which marked him,\ndestroyed it unread before the eyes of those who were rushing in to\nhis rescue. I supplied suggestions and improvements; and, engrossed in\ncontriving how to blind curious eyes, we forgot the real and permanent\ndifficulties of the thing we had resolved upon. For us they did not\nexist; Sapt met every objection by declaring that the thing had been\ndone once and could be done again. Bernenstein and I were not behind him\nin confidence.\n\nWe would guard the secret with brain and hand and life, even as we had\nguarded and kept the secret of the queen's letter, which would now go\nwith Rupert of Hentzau to his grave. Bauer we could catch and silence:\nnay, who would listen to such a tale from such a man? Rischenheim was\nours; the old woman would keep her doubts between her teeth for her own\nsake. To his own land and his own people Rudolf must be dead while\nthe King of Ruritania would stand before all Europe recognized,\nunquestioned, unassailed. True, he must marry the queen again; Sapt was\nready with the means, and would hear nothing of the difficulty and risk\nin finding a hand to perform the necessary ceremony. If we quailed in\nour courage: we had but to look at the alternative, and find recompense\nthe perils of what we meant to undertake by a consideration the\ndesperate risk involved in abandoning it. Persuaded the substitution of\nRudolf for the king was the only thing would serve our turn, we asked\nno longer whether it possible, but sought only the means to make it safe\nand safe.\n\nBut Rudolf himself had not spoken. Sapt's appeal and the queen's\nimploring cry had shaken but not overcome him; he had wavered, but he\nwas not won. Yet there was no talk of impossibility or peril in his\nmouth, any more than in ours: those were not what gave him pause. The\nscore on which he hesitated was whether the thing should be done, not\nwhether it could; our appeals were not to brace a failing courage, but\ncajole a sturdy sense of honor which found the imposture distasteful\nso soon as it seemed to serve a personal end. To serve the king he had\nplayed the king in old days, but he did not love to play the king when\nthe profit of it was to be his own. Hence he was unmoved till his care\nfor the fair fame of the queen and the love of his friends joined to\nbuffet his resolution.\n\nThen he faltered; but he had not fallen. Yet Colonel Sapt did all as\nthough he had given his assent, and watched the last hours in which\nhis flight from Strelsau was possible go quickly by with more than\nequanimity. Why hurry Rudolf's resolve? Every moment shut him closer in\nthe trap of an inevitable choice. With every hour that he was called the\nking, it became more impossible for him to bear any other name all his\ndays. Therefore Sapt let Mr. Rassendyll doubt and struggle, while he\nhimself wrote his story and laid his long-headed plans. And now and then\nJames, the little servant, came in and went out, sedate and smug, but\nwith a quiet satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. He had made a story for\na pastime, and it was being translated into history. He at least would\nbear his part in it unflinchingly.\n\nBefore now the queen had left us, persuaded to lie down and try to rest\ntill the matter should be settled. Stilled by Rudolf's gentle rebuke,\nshe had urged him no more in words, but there was an entreaty in her\neyes stronger than any spoken prayer, and a piteousness in the lingering\nof her hand in his harder to resist than ten thousand sad petitions.\nAt last he had led her from the room and commended her to Helga's care.\nThen, returning to us, he stood silent a little while. We also were\nsilent, Sapt sitting and looking up at him with his brows knit and his\nteeth restlessly chewing the moustache on his lip.\n\n\"Well, lad?\" he said at last, briefly putting the great question. Rudolf\nwalked to the window and seemed to lose himself for a moment in\nthe contemplation of the quiet night. There were no more than a few\nstragglers in the street now; the moon shone white and clear on the\nempty square.\n\n\"I should like to walk up and down outside and think it over,\" he said,\nturning to us; and, as Bernenstein sprang up to accompany him, he added,\n\"No. Alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said old Sapt, with a glance at the clock, whose hands were\nnow hard on two o'clock. \"Take your time, lad, take your time.\"\n\nRudolf looked at him and broke into a smile.\n\n\"I'm not your dupe, old Sapt,\" said he, shaking his head. \"Trust me, if\nI decide to get away, I'll get away, be it what o'clock it will.\"\n\n\"Yes, confound you!\" grinned Colonel Sapt.\n\nSo he left us, and then came that long time of scheming and planning,\nand most persistent eye-shutting, in which occupations an hour wore its\nlife away. Rudolf had not passed out of the porch, and we supposed that\nhe had betaken himself to the gardens, there to fight his battle. Old\nSapt, having done his work, suddenly turned talkative.\n\n\"That moon there,\" he said, pointing his square, thick forefinger at the\nwindow, \"is a mighty untrustworthy lady. I've known her wake a villain's\nconscience before now.\"\n\n\"I've known her send a lover's to sleep,\" laughed young Bernenstein,\nrising from his table, stretching himself, and lighting a cigar.\n\n\"Ay, she's apt to take a man out of what he is,\" pursued old Sapt. \"Set\na quiet man near her, and he dreams of battle; an ambitious fellow,\nafter ten minutes of her, will ask nothing better than to muse all his\nlife away. I don't trust her, Fritz; I wish the night were dark.\"\n\n\"What will she do to Rudolf Rassendyll?\" I asked, falling in with the\nold fellow's whimsical mood.\n\n\"He will see the queen's face in hers,\" cried Bernenstein.\n\n\"He may see God's,\" said Sapt; and he shook himself as though an\nunwelcome thought had found its way to his mind and lips.\n\nA pause fell on us, born of the colonel's last remark. We looked one\nanother in the face. At last Sapt brought his hand down on the table\nwith a bang.\n\n\"I'll not go back,\" he said sullenly, almost fiercely.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Bernenstein, drawing himself up. \"Nor you, Tarlenheim?\"\n\n\"No, I also go on,\" I answered. Then again there was a moment's silence.\n\n\"She may make a man soft as a sponge,\" reflected Sapt, starting again,\n\"or hard as a bar of steel. I should feel safer if the night were dark.\nI've looked at her often from my tent and from bare ground, and I know\nher. She got me a decoration, and once she came near to making me turn\ntail. Have nothing to do with her, young Bernenstein.\"\n\n\"I'll keep my eyes for beauties nearer at hand,\" said Bernenstein, whose\nvolatile temper soon threw off a serious mood.\n\n\"There's a chance for you, now Rupert of Hentzau's gone,\" said Sapt\ngrimly.\n\nAs he spoke there was a knock at the door. When it opened James entered.\n\n\"The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim begs to be allowed to speak with the\nking,\" said James.\n\n\"We expect his Majesty every moment. Beg the count to enter,\" Sapt\nanswered; and, when Rischenheim came in, he went on, motioning the count\nto a chair: \"We are talking, my lord, of the influence of the moon on\nthe careers of men.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do? What have you decided?\" burst out Rischenheim\nimpatiently.\n\n\"We decide nothing,\" answered Sapt.\n\n\"Then what has Mr.--what has the king decided?\"\n\n\"The king decides nothing, my lord. She decides,\" and the old fellow\npointed again through the window towards the moon. \"At this moment\nshe makes or unmakes a king; but I can't tell you which. What of your\ncousin?\"\n\n\"You know that my cousin's dead.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that. What of him, though?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Rischenheim with some dignity, \"since he is dead, let him\nrest in peace. It is not for us to judge him.\"\n\n\"He may well wish it were. For, by Heaven, I believe I should let the\nrogue off,\" said Colonel Sapt, \"and I don't think his Judge will.\"\n\n\"God forgive him, I loved him,\" said Rischenheim. \"Yes, and many have\nloved him. His servants loved him, sir.\"\n\n\"Friend Bauer, for example?\"\n\n\"Yes, Bauer loved him. Where is Bauer?\"\n\n\"I hope he's gone to hell with his loved master,\" grunted Sapt, but he\nhad the grace to lower his voice and shield his mouth with his hand, so\nthat Rischenheim did not hear.\n\n\"We don't know where he is,\" I answered.\n\n\"I am come,\" said Rischenheim, \"to put my services in all respects at\nthe queen's disposal.\"\n\n\"And at the king's?\" asked Sapt.\n\n\"At the king's? But the king is dead.\"\n\n\"Therefore 'Long live the king!'\" struck in young Bernenstein.\n\n\"If there should be a king--\" began Sapt.\n\n\"You'll do that?\" interrupted Rischenheim in breathless agitation.\n\n\"She is deciding,\" said Colonel Sapt, and again he pointed to the moon.\n\n\"But she's a plaguey long time about it,\" remarked Lieutenant von\nBernenstein.\n\nRischenheim sat silent for a moment. His face was pale, and when he\nspoke his voice trembled. But his words were resolute enough.\n\n\"I gave my honor to the queen, and even in that I will serve her if she\ncommands me.\"\n\nBernenstein sprang forward and caught him by the hand. \"That's what I\nlike,\" said he, \"and damn the moon, colonel!\" His sentence was hardly\nout of his mouth when the door opened, and to our astonishment the queen\nentered. Helga was just behind her; her clasped hands and frightened\neyes seemed to protest that their coming was against her will. The queen\nwas clad in a long white robe, and her hair hung on her shoulders, being\nbut loosely bound with a ribbon. Her air showed great agitation, and\nwithout any greeting or notice of the rest she walked quickly across the\nroom to me.\n\n\"The dream, Fritz,\" she said. \"It has come again. Helga persuaded me to\nlie down, and I was very tired, so at last I fell asleep. Then it came.\nI saw him, Fritz--I saw him as plainly as I see you. They all called him\nking, as they did to-day; but they did not cheer. They were quiet, and\nlooked at him with sad faces. I could not hear what they said; they\nspoke in hushed voices. I heard nothing more than 'the king, the king,'\nand he seemed to hear not even that. He lay still; he was lying on\nsomething, something covered with hanging stuff, I couldn't see what it\nwas; yes, quite still. His face was so pale, and he didn't hear them\nsay 'the king.' Fritz, Fritz, he looked as if he were dead! Where is he?\nWhere have you let him go?\"\n\nShe turned from me and her eyes flashed over the rest. \"Where is he? Why\naren't you with him?\" she demanded, with a sudden change of tone; \"why\naren't you round him? You should be between him and danger, ready to\ngive your lives for his. Indeed, gentlemen, you take your duty lightly.\"\n\nIt might be that there was little reason in her words. There appeared to\nbe no danger threatening him, and after all he was not our king, much as\nwe desired to make him such. Yet we did not think of any such matter. We\nwere abashed before her reproof and took her indignation as deserved.\nWe hung our heads, and Sapt's shame betrayed itself in the dogged\nsullenness of his answer.\n\n\"He has chosen to go walking, madam, and to go alone. He ordered us--I\nsay, he ordered us not to come. Surely we are right to obey him?\" The\nsarcastic inflection of his voice conveyed his opinion of the queen's\nextravagance.\n\n\"Obey him? Yes. You couldn't go with him if he forbade you. But you\nshould follow him; you should keep him in sight.\"\n\nThis much she spoke in proud tones and with a disdainful manner, but\nthen came a sudden return to her former bearing. She held out her hands\ntowards me, wailing:\n\n\"Fritz, where is he? Is he safe? Find him for me, Fritz; find him.\"\n\n\"I'll find him for you if he's above ground, madam,\" I cried, for her\nappeal touched me to the heart.\n\n\"He's no farther off than the gardens,\" grumbled old Sapt, still\nresentful of the queen's reproof and scornful of the woman's agitation.\nHe was also out of temper with Rudolf himself, because the moon took so\nlong in deciding whether she would make or unmake a king.\n\n\"The gardens!\" she cried. \"Then let us look for him. Oh, you've let him\nwalk in the gardens alone?\"\n\n\"What should harm the fellow?\" muttered Sapt.\n\nShe did not hear him, for she had swept out of the room. Helga went with\nher, and we all followed, Sapt behind the rest of us, still very surly.\nI heard him grumbling away as we ran downstairs, and, having passed\nalong the great corridor, came to the small saloon that opened on\nthe gardens. There were no servants about, but we encountered a\nnight-watchman, and Bernenstein snatched the lantern from the astonished\nman's hand.\n\nSave for the dim light thus furnished, the room was dark. But outside\nthe windows the moon streamed brightly down on the broad gravel walk,\non the formal flower-beds, and the great trees in the gardens. The queen\nmade straight for the window. I followed her, and, having flung the\nwindow open, stood by her. The air was sweet, and the breeze struck with\ngrateful coolness on my face. I saw that Sapt had come near and stood on\nthe other side of the queen. My wife and the others were behind, looking\nout where our shoulders left space.\n\nThere, in the bright moonlight, on the far side of the broad terrace,\nclose by the line of tall trees that fringed its edge, we saw Rudolf\nRassendyll pacing slowly up and down, with his hands behind his back and\nhis eyes fixed on the arbiter of his fate, on her who was to make him a\nking or send him a fugitive from Strelsau.\n\n\"There he is, madam,\" said Sapt. \"Safe enough!\"\n\nThe queen did not answer. Sapt said no more, and of the rest of us none\nspoke. We stood watching him as he struggled with his great issue; a\ngreater surely has seldom fallen to the lot of any man born in a private\nstation. Yet I could read little of it on the face that the rays of\nwhite light displayed so clearly, although they turned his healthy tints\nto a dull gray, and gave unnatural sharpness to his features against the\ndeep background of black foliage.\n\nI heard the queen's quick breathing, but there was scarcely another\nsound. I saw her clutch her gown and pull it away a little from her\nthroat; save for that none in the group moved. The lantern's light\nwas too dim to force notice from Mr. Rassendyll. Unconscious of our\npresence, he wrestled with fate that night in the gardens.\n\nSuddenly the faintest exclamation came from Sapt. He put his hand back\nand beckoned to Bernenstein. The young man handed his lantern to the\nconstable, who set it close to the side of the window-frame. The queen,\nabsolutely engrossed in her lover, saw nothing, but I perceived what had\ncaught Sapt's attention. There were scores on the paint and indentations\nin the wood, just at the edge of the panel and near the lock. I glanced\nat Sapt, who nodded his head. It looked very much as though somebody had\ntried to force the door that night, employing a knife which had dented\nthe woodwork and scratched the paint. The least thing was enough to\nalarm us, standing where we stood, and the constable's face was full\nof suspicion. Who had sought an entrance? It could be no trained and\npractised housebreaker; he would have had better tools.\n\nBut now our attention was again diverted. Rudolf stopped short. He still\nlooked for a moment at the sky, then his glance dropped to the ground at\nhis feet. A second later he jerked his head--it was bare, and I saw\nthe dark red hair stir with the movement--like a man who has settled\nsomething which caused him a puzzle. In an instant we knew, by the quick\nintuition of contagious emotion, that the question had found its answer.\nHe was by now king or a fugitive. The Lady of the Skies had given her\ndecision. The thrill ran through us; I felt the queen draw herself\ntogether at my side; I felt the muscles of Rischenheim's arm which\nrested against my shoulder grow rigid and taut. Sapt's face was full of\neagerness, and he gnawed his moustache silently. We gathered closer to\none another. At last we could bear the suspense no longer. With one look\nat the queen and another at me, Sapt stepped on to the gravel. He would\ngo and learn the answer; thus the unendurable strain that had stretched\nus like tortured men on a rack would be relieved. The queen did not\nanswer his glance, nor even seem to see that he had moved. Her eyes\nwere still all for Mr. Rassendyll, her thoughts buried in his; for her\nhappiness was in his hands and lay poised on the issue of that decision\nwhose momentousness held him for a moment motionless on the path. Often\nI seem to see him as he stood there, tall, straight, and stately, the\nking a man's fancy paints when he reads of great monarchs who flourished\nlong ago in the springtime of the world.\n\nSapt's step crunched on the gravel. Rudolf heard it and turned his head.\nHe saw Sapt, and he saw me also behind Sapt. He smiled composedly and\nbrightly, but he did not move from where he was. He held out both\nhands towards the constable and caught him in their double grasp, still\nsmiling down in his face. I was no nearer to reading his decision,\nthough I saw that he had reached a resolution that was immovable and\ngave peace to his soul. If he meant to go on he would go on now, on\nto the end, without a backward look or a falter of his foot; if he had\nchosen the other way, he would depart without a murmur or a hesitation.\nThe queen's quick breathing had ceased, she seemed like a statue; but\nRischenheim moved impatiently, as though he could no longer endure the\nwaiting.\n\nSapt's voice came harsh and grating.\n\n\"Well?\" he cried. \"Which is it to be--backward or forward?\" Rudolf\npressed his hands and looked into his eyes. The answer asked but a word\nfrom him. The queen caught my arm; her rigid limbs seemed to give\nway, and she would have fallen if I had not supported her. At the same\ninstant a man sprang out of the dark line of tall trees, directly behind\nMr. Rassendyll. Bernenstein uttered a loud startled cry and rushed\nforward, pushing the queen herself violently out of his path. His hand\nflew to his side, and he ripped the heavy cavalry sword that belonged\nto his uniform of the Cuirassiers of the Guard from its sheath. I saw it\nflash in the moonlight, but its flash was quenched in a brighter short\nblaze. A shot rang out through the quiet gardens. Mr. Rassendyll did not\nloose his hold of Sapt's hands, but he sank slowly on to his knees. Sapt\nseemed paralyzed.\n\nAgain Bernenstein cried out. It was a name this time. \"Bauer! By God,\nBauer!\" he cried.\n\nIn an instant he was across the path and by the trees. The assassin\nfired again, but now he missed. We saw the great sword flash high above\nBernenstein's head and heard it whistle through the air. It crashed on\nthe crown of Bauer's head, and he fell like a log to the ground with his\nskull split. The queen's hold on me relaxed; she sank into Rischenheim's\narms. I ran forward and knelt by Mr. Rassendyll. He still held Sapt's\nhands, and by their help buoyed himself up. But when he saw me he let go\nof them and sank back against me, his head resting on my chest. He moved\nhis lips, but seemed unable to speak. He was shot through the back.\nBauer had avenged the master whom he loved, and was gone to meet him.\n\nThere was a sudden stir from inside the palace. Shutters were flung\nback and windows thrown open. The group we made stood clean-cut, plainly\nvisible in the moonlight. A moment later there was a rush of eager feet,\nand we were surrounded by officers and servants. Bernenstein stood by\nme now, leaning on his sword; Sapt had not uttered a word; his face was\ndistorted with horror and bitterness. Rudolf's eyes were closed and his\nhead lay back against me.\n\n\"A man has shot the king,\" said I, in bald, stupid explanation.\n\nAll at once I found James, Mr. Rassendyll's servant, by me.\n\n\"I have sent for doctors, my lord,\" he said. \"Come, let us carry him\nin.\"\n\nHe, Sapt and I lifted Rudolf and bore him across the gravel terrace\nand into the little saloon. We passed the queen. She was leaning on\nRischenheim's arm, and held my wife's hand. We laid Rudolf down on a\ncouch. Outside I heard Bernenstein say, \"Pick up that fellow and carry\nhim somewhere out of sight.\" Then he also came in, followed by a crowd.\nHe sent them all to the door, and we were left alone, waiting for the\nsurgeon. The queen came up, Rischenheim still supporting her. \"Rudolf!\nRudolf!\" she whispered, very softly.\n\nHe opened his eyes, and his lips bent in a smile. She flung herself on\nher knees and kissed his hand passionately. \"The surgeon will be here\ndirectly,\" said I.\n\nRudolf's eyes had been on the queen. As I spoke he looked up at me,\nsmiled again, and shook his head. I turned away.\n\nWhen the surgeon came Sapt and I assisted him in his examination. The\nqueen had been led away, and we were alone. The examination was very\nshort. Then we carried Rudolf to a bed; the nearest chanced to be in\nBernenstein's room; there we laid him, and there all that could be\ndone for him was done. All this time we had asked no questions of the\nsurgeon, and he had given no information. We knew too well to ask: we\nhad all seen men die before now, and the look on the face was familiar\nto us. Two or three more doctors, the most eminent in Strelsau, came\nnow, having been hastily summoned. It was their right to be called; but,\nfor all the good they were, they might have been left to sleep the night\nout in their beds. They drew together in a little group at the end of\nthe room and talked for a few minutes in low tones. James lifted his\nmaster's head and gave him a drink of water. Rudolf swallowed it with\ndifficulty. Then I saw him feebly press James's hand, for the little\nman's face was full of sorrow. As his master smiled the servant mustered\na smile in answer. I crossed over to the doctors. \"Well, gentlemen?\" I\nasked.\n\nThey looked at one another, then the greatest of them said gravely:\n\n\"The king may live an hour, Count Fritz. Should you not send for a\npriest?\"\n\nI went straight back to Rudolf Rassendyll. His eyes greeted me and\nquestioned me. He was a man, and I played no silly tricks with him. I\nbent down and said: \"An hour, they think, Rudolf.\"\n\nHe made one restless movement, whether of pain or protest I do not know.\nThen he spoke, very low, slowly, and with difficulty.\n\n\"Then they can go,\" he said; and when I spoke of a priest he shook his\nhead.\n\nI went back to them and asked if anything more could be done. The answer\nwas nothing; but I could not prevail further than to get all save one\nsent into an adjoining room; he who remained seated himself at a table\nsome way off. Rudolf's eyes had closed again; old Sapt, who had not once\nspoken since the shot was fired, raised a haggard face to mine.\n\n\"We'd better fetch her to him,\" he said hoarsely. I nodded my head.\n\nSapt went while I stayed by him. Bernenstein came to him, bent down,\nand kissed his hand. The young fellow, who had borne himself with such\nreckless courage and dash throughout the affair, was quite unmanned now,\nand the tears were rolling down his face. I could have been much in\nthe same plight, but I would not before Mr. Rassendyll. He smiled at\nBernenstein. Then he said to me:\n\n\"Is she coming, Fritz?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's coming, sire,\" I answered.\n\nHe noticed the style of my address; a faint amused gleam shot into his\nlanguid eyes.\n\n\"Well, for an hour, then,\" he murmured, and lay back on his pillows.\n\nShe came, dry-eyed, calm, and queenly. We all drew back, and she knelt\ndown by his bed, holding his hand in her two hands. Presently the hand\nstirred; she let it go; then, knowing well what he wanted, she raised it\nherself and placed it on her head, while she bowed her face to the bed.\nHis hand wandered for the last time over the gleaming hair that he had\nloved so well. She rose, passed her arm about his shoulders, and kissed\nhis lips. Her face rested close to his, and he seemed to speak to her,\nbut we could not have heard the words even if we would. So they remained\nfor a long while.\n\nThe doctor came and felt his pulse, retreating afterwards with\nclose-shut lips. We drew a little nearer, for we knew that he would\nnot be long with us now. Suddenly strength seemed to come upon him. He\nraised himself in his bed, and spoke in distinct tones.\n\n\"God has decided,\" he said. \"I've tried to do the right thing through it\nall. Sapt, and Bernenstein, and you, old Fritz, shake my hand. No, don't\nkiss it. We've done with pretence now.\"\n\nWe shook his hand as he bade us. Then he took the queen's hand. Again\nshe knew his mind, and moved it to his lips. \"In life and in death, my\nsweet queen,\" he murmured. And thus he fell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE COMING OF THE DREAM\n\nTHERE IS little need, and I have little heart, to dwell on what followed\nthe death of Mr. Rassendyll. The plans we had laid to secure his tenure\nof the throne, in case he had accepted it, served well in the event\nof his death. Bauer's lips were for ever sealed; the old woman was too\nscared and appalled to hint even to her gossips of the suspicions she\nentertained. Rischenheim was loyal to the pledge he had given to the\nqueen. The ashes of the hunting-lodge held their secret fast, and none\nsuspected when the charred body which was called Rudolf Rassendyll's was\nlaid to quiet rest in the graveyard of the town of Zenda, hard by the\ntomb of Herbert the forester. For we had from the first rejected any\nidea of bringing the king's body to Strelsau and setting it in the place\nof Mr. Rassendyll's. The difficulties of such an undertaking were almost\ninsuperable; in our hearts we did not desire to conquer them. As a king\nRudolf Rassendyll had died, as a king let him lie. As a king he lay in\nhis palace at Strelsau, while the news of his murder at the hands of a\nconfederate of Rupert of Hentzau went forth to startle and appall the\nworld. At a mighty price our task had been made easy; many might have\ndoubted the living, none questioned the dead; suspicions which might\nhave gathered round a throne died away at the gate of a vault. The king\nwas dead. Who would ask if it were in truth the king who lay in state in\nthe great hall of the palace, or whether the humble grave at Zenda held\nthe bones of the last male Elphberg? In the silence of the grave all\nmurmurs and questionings were hushed.\n\nThroughout the day people had been passing and repassing through the\ngreat hall. There, on a stately bier surmounted by a crown and the\ndrooping folds of the royal banner, lay Rudolf Rassendyll. The highest\nofficer guarded him; in the cathedral the archbishop said a mass for his\nsoul. He had lain there three days; the evening of the third had come,\nand early on the morrow he was to be buried. There is a little gallery\nin the hall, that looks down on the spot where the bier stood; here was\nI on this evening, and with me Queen Flavia. We were alone together, and\ntogether we saw beneath us the calm face of the dead man. He was clad\nin the white uniform in which he had been crowned; the ribbon of the\nRed Rose was across his breast. His hand held a true red rose, fresh and\nfragrant; Flavia herself had set it there, that even in death he might\nnot miss the chosen token of her love. I had not spoken to her, nor\nshe to me, since we came there. We watched the pomp round him, and the\ncircles of people that came to bring a wreath for him or to look upon\nhis face. I saw a girl come and kneel long at the bier's foot. She rose\nand went away sobbing, leaving a little circlet of flowers. It was Rosa\nHolf. I saw women come and go weeping, and men bite their lips as they\npassed by. Rischenheim came, pale-faced and troubled; and while all came\nand went, there, immovable, with drawn sword, in military stiffness, old\nSapt stood at the head of the bier, his eyes set steadily in front of\nhim, and his body never stirring from hour to hour through the long day.\n\nA distant faint hum of voices reached us. The queen laid her hand on my\narm.\n\n\"It is the dream, Fritz,\" she said. \"Hark! They speak of the king; they\nspeak in low voices and with grief, but they call him king. It's what I\nsaw in the dream. But he does not hear nor heed. No, he can't hear nor\nheed even when I call him my king.\"\n\nA sudden impulse came on me, and I turned to her, asking:\n\n\"What had he decided, madam? Would he have been king?\" She started a\nlittle.\n\n\"He didn't tell me,\" she answered, \"and I didn't think of it while he\nspoke to me.\"\n\n\"Of what then did he speak, madam?\"\n\n\"Only of his love--of nothing but his love, Fritz,\" she answered.\n\nWell, I take it that when a man comes to die, love is more to him than\na kingdom: it may be, if we could see truly, that it is more to him even\nwhile he lives.\n\n\"Of nothing but his great love for me, Fritz,\" she said again. \"And my\nlove brought him to his death.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have had it otherwise,\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered; and she leant over the parapet of the gallery,\nstretching out her arms to him. But he lay still and quiet, not hearing\nand not heeding what she murmured, \"My king! my king!\" It was even as it\nhad been in the dream.\n\nThat night James, the servant, took leave of his dead master and of\nus. He carried to England by word of mouth--for we dared write nothing\ndown--the truth concerning the King of Ruritania and Mr. Rassendyll.\nIt was to be told to the Earl of Burlesdon, Rudolf's brother, under\na pledge of secrecy; and to this day the earl is the only man besides\nourselves who knows the story. His errand done, James returned in order\nto enter the queen's service, in which he still is; and he told us that\nwhen Lord Burlesdon had heard the story he sat silent for a great while,\nand then said:\n\n\"He did well. Some day I will visit his grave. Tell her Majesty that\nthere is still a Rassendyll, if she has need of one.\"\n\nThe offer was such as should come from a man of Rudolf's name, yet I\ntrust that the queen needs no further service than such as it is our\nhumble duty and dear delight to render her. It is our part to strive\nto lighten the burden that she bears, and by our love to assuage her\nundying grief. For she reigns now in Ruritania alone, the last of all\nthe Elphbergs; and her only joy is to talk of Mr. Rassendyll with those\nfew who knew him, her only hope that she may some day be with him again.\n\nIn great pomp we laid him to his rest in the vault of the kings of\nRuritania in the Cathedral of Strelsau. There he lies among the\nprinces of the House of Elphberg. I think that if there be indeed any\nconsciousness among the dead, or any knowledge of what passes in the\nworld they have left, they should be proud to call him brother. There\nrises in memory of him a stately monument, and people point it out to\none another as the memorial of King Rudolf. I go often to the spot, and\nrecall in thought all that passed when he came the first time to Zenda,\nand again on his second coming. For I mourn him as a man mourns a\ntrusted leader and a loved comrade, and I should have asked no better\nthan to be allowed to serve him all my days. Yet I serve the queen, and\nin that I do most truly serve her lover.\n\nTimes change for all of us. The roaring flood of youth goes by, and the\nstream of life sinks to a quiet flow. Sapt is an old man now; soon my\nsons will be grown up, men enough themselves to serve Queen Flavia. Yet\nthe memory of Rudolf Rassendyll is fresh to me as on the day he died,\nand the vision of the death of Rupert of Hentzau dances often before\nmy eyes. It may be that some day the whole story shall be told, and men\nshall judge of it for themselves. To me it seems now as though all had\nended well. I must not be misunderstood: my heart is still sore for the\nloss of him. But we saved the queen's fair fame, and to Rudolf himself\nthe fatal stroke came as a relief from a choice too difficult: on the\none side lay what impaired his own honor, on the other what threatened\nhers. As I think on this my anger at his death is less, though my grief\ncannot be. To this day I know not how he chose; no, and I don't know\nhow he should have chosen. Yet he had chosen, for his face was calm and\nclear.\n\nCome, I have thought so much of him that I will go now and stand before\nhis monument, taking with me my last-born son, a little lad of ten.\nHe is not too young to desire to serve the queen, and not too young to\nlearn to love and reverence him who sleeps there in the vault and was in\nhis life the noblest gentleman I have known.\n\nI will take the boy with me and tell him what I may of brave King\nRudolf, how he fought and how he loved, and how he held the queen's\nhonor and his own above all things in this world. The boy is not too\nyoung to learn such lessons from the life of Mr. Rassendyll. And while\nwe stand there I will turn again into his native tongue--for, alas,\nthe young rogue loves his toy soldiers better than his Latin!--the\ninscription that the queen wrote with her own hand, directing that it\nshould be inscribed in that stately tongue over the tomb in which her\nlife lies buried.\n\n\"To Rudolf, who reigned lately in this city, and reigns for ever in her\nheart.--QUEEN FLAVIA.\"\n\nI told him the meaning, and he spelt the big words over in his childish\nvoice; at first he stumbled, but the second time he had it right, and\nrecited with a little touch of awe in his fresh young tones:\n\nRUDOLFO\n\nQui in hac civitate nuper regnavit In corde ipsius in aeternum regnat\n\nFLAVIA REGINA.\n\nI felt his hand tremble in mine, and he looked up in my face. \"God save\nthe Queen, father,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Rupert of Hentzau, by Anthony Hope\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RUPERT OF HENTZAU ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1145.txt or 1145.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/4/1145/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
