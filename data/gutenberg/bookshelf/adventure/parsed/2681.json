The Man in the Iron Mask we're\nfamiliar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.\n[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the\nconfusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]\n\nWe intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four\netexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la\nValliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in\nthe Iron Mask.\n\nOne thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,\nentitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.\nWhile this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years\nAfter, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts\nthat we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years\nAfter, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty\nYears \"After\" the original story...however, this is why the different\nwords \"After\" and \"Later\"...the Ten Years \"After\" is ten years after\nthe Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the\nD'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the\nsubtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different\nvolumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the\nfirst volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later\ncan, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the\nfour-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,\nit refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material\nin the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the\nseries which may prove helpful:\n\nThe Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1625-1628.\n\nTwenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D'Artagnan Romances.\nCovers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but\nsecond in time sequence!!!]\n\nTen Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the\nD'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.\n\nThe Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)--First\n75 chapters of the third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the\nyear 1660.\n\nTen Years Later: Etext 2681 (our new etext)--Chapters 76-140 of that\nthird book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661. [In\nthis particular editing of it]\n\nLouise de la Valliere: forthcoming (our next etext)--Chapters 141-208 of\nthe third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (following)--Chapters 209-269 of\nthe third book of the D'Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1661-1673.\n\nIf we've calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to\nthe modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still\nwidely circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de\nBragelonne.\n\nHere is a list of the other Dumas Etexts we have published so far:\n\nSep 1999 La Tulipe Noire, by Alexandre\nDumas[Pere#6/French][tlpnrxxx.xxx]1910 This is an abridged edition in\nFrench, also see our full length English Etext Jul 1997 The Black Tulip,\nby Alexandre Dumas[Pere][Dumas#1][tbtlpxxx.xxx] 965 Jan 1998 The Count\nof Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas[Pere][crstoxxx.xxx]1184\n\n\nMany thanks to Dr. David Coward, whose editions of the D'Artagnan\nRomances have proved an invaluable source of information.\n\n*****\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the\nfirst portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright\nAlexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had\nfound a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a\nhistory he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures\nof a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost\nimmediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and\nill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers\nwould enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,\nPorthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the\nscenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English\nhistory.\n\nEventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,\nand became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief\nsummary of the first two novels:\n\nThe Three Musketeers (serialized March-July, 1844): The year is 1625.\nThe young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and\nalmost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.\nInstead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's\nguards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.\nThe four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord\nto find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them\nacross both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the\nCardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,\nnamed simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of\nAustria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the\nfour friends.\n\nTwenty Years After (serialized January-August, 1845): The year is now\n1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has\ndied, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit\nupon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,\nthe real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.\nD'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have\nretired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de\nla Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.\nAramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of\nshedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has\nmarried a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But\ntrouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the\ninstitution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at\nhome the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings\nhis friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,\nbut Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death\nat the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our\nheroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,\nquiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThe third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847\n--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English\ntranslation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at\nvarious points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does\nnot give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the\nthree-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of\nthis etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition\ndoes, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,\nLouise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the last etext:\n\nThe Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and\nD'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become\ndisgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with\nthe Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on\nhis own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,\nand, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune\nin the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich\ncitizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's\nbrother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own\nestate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to\nassume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly\nMazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,\nthe king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any\nmeans necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant\nbestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's\nloyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention\nthat Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could\npossibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation\nagainst the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends\nhim to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his\nlong-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At\nBelle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications\nis, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.\nThe blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting,\nshow evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.\nD'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,\nwhich is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting\nthat D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis\ntricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,\nand sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of\nthe danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a\npresent, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating\nColbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an\naudience with the king.\n\nAnd now, the second etext of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. Enjoy!\n\nJohn Bursey Mordaunt@aol.com June, 2000\n\n*****\n\nThere is one French custom that may cause confusion. The Duc d'Orleans\nis traditionally called \"Monsieur\" and his wife \"Madame.\" Gaston, the\nking's uncle, currently holds that title. Upon the event of his death,\nit will be conferred upon the king's brother, Philip, who is currently\nthe Duc d'Anjou. The customary title of \"Monsieur\" will go to him as\nwell, and upon his future wife, Henrietta of England, that of \"Madame.\"\nGaston's widow will be referred to as the \"Dowager Madame.\"--JB\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\nChapter I. In which D'Artagnan finishes by at Length placing his Hand\nupon his Captain's Commission.\n\nThe reader guesses beforehand whom the usher preceded in announcing\nthe courier from Bretagne. This messenger was easily recognized. It was\nD'Artagnan, his clothes dusty, his face inflamed, his hair dripping with\nsweat, his legs stiff; he lifted his feet painfully at every step, on\nwhich resounded the clink of his blood-stained spurs. He perceived\nin the doorway he was passing through, the superintendent coming out.\nFouquet bowed with a smile to him who, an hour before, was bringing him\nruin and death. D'Artagnan found in his goodness of heart, and in his\ninexhaustible vigor of body, enough presence of mind to remember\nthe kind reception of this man; he bowed then, also, much more from\nbenevolence and compassion, than from respect. He felt upon his lips the\nword which had so many times been repeated to the Duc de Guise: \"Fly.\"\nBut to pronounce that word would have been to betray his cause; to speak\nthat word in the cabinet of the king, and before an usher, would have\nbeen to ruin himself gratuitously, and could save nobody. D'Artagnan\nthen, contented himself with bowing to Fouquet and entered. At this\nmoment the king floated between the joy the last words of Fouquet had\ngiven him, and his pleasure at the return of D'Artagnan. Without being a\ncourtier, D'Artagnan had a glance as sure and as rapid as if he had been\none. He read, on his entrance, devouring humiliation on the countenance\nof Colbert. He even heard the king say these words to him:--\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur Colbert; you have then nine hundred thousand livres at\nthe intendance?\" Colbert, suffocated, bowed but made no reply. All this\nscene entered into the mind of D'Artagnan, by the eyes and ears, at\nonce.\n\nThe first word of Louis to his musketeer, as if he wished it to contrast\nwith what he was saying at the moment, was a kind \"good day.\" His second\nwas to send away Colbert. The latter left the king's cabinet, pallid and\ntottering, whilst D'Artagnan twisted up the ends of his mustache.\n\n\"I love to see one of my servants in this disorder,\" said the king,\nadmiring the martial stains upon the clothes of his envoy.\n\n\"I thought, sire, my presence at the Louvre was sufficiently urgent to\nexcuse my presenting myself thus before you.\"\n\n\"You bring me great news, then, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Sire, the thing is this, in two words: Belle-Isle is fortified,\nadmirably fortified; Belle-Isle has a double _enceinte_, a citadel, two\ndetached forts; its ports contain three corsairs; and the side batteries\nonly await their cannon.\"\n\n\"I know all that, monsieur,\" replied the king.\n\n\"What! your majesty knows all that?\" replied the musketeer, stupefied.\n\n\"I have the plan of the fortifications of Belle-Isle,\" said the king.\n\n\"Your majesty has the plan?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\"It is really correct, sire: I saw a similar one on the spot.\"\n\nD'Artagnan's brow became clouded.\n\n\"Ah! I understand all. Your majesty did not trust to me alone, but sent\nsome other person,\" said he in a reproachful tone.\n\n\"Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what\nI know, so that I know it?\"\n\n\"Sire, sire,\" said the musketeer, without seeking even to conceal his\ndissatisfaction; \"but I must be permitted to say to your majesty, that\nit is not worth while to make me use such speed, to risk twenty\ntimes the breaking of my neck, to salute me on my arrival with\nsuch intelligence. Sire, when people are not trusted, or are deemed\ninsufficient, they should scarcely be employed.\" And D'Artagnan, with\na movement perfectly military, stamped with his foot, and left upon the\nfloor dust stained with blood. The king looked at him, inwardly enjoying\nhis first triumph.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, at the expiration of a minute, \"not only is\nBelle-Isle known to me, but, still further, Belle-Isle is mine.\"\n\n\"That is well! that is well, sire, I ask but one thing more,\" replied\nD'Artagnan.--\"My discharge.\"\n\n\"What! your discharge?\"\n\n\"Without doubt I am too proud to eat the bread of the king without\nearning it, or rather by gaining it badly.--My discharge, sire!\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"I ask for my discharge, or I will take it.\"\n\n\"You are angry, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I have reason, _mordioux!_ Thirty-two hours in the saddle, I ride day\nand night, I perform prodigies of speed, I arrive stiff as the corpse of\na man who has been hung--and another arrives before me! Come, sire, I am\na fool!--My discharge, sire!\"\n\n\"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Louis, leaning his white hand upon the dusty\narm of the musketeer, \"what I tell you will not at all affect that which\nI promised you. A king's word given must be kept.\" And the king going\nstraight to his table, opened a drawer, and took out a folded paper.\n\"Here is your commission of captain of musketeers; you have won it,\nMonsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\nD'Artagnan opened the paper eagerly, and scanned it twice. He could\nscarcely believe his eyes.\n\n\"And this commission is given you,\" continued the king, \"not only on\naccount of your journey to Belle-Isle but, moreover, for your brave\nintervention at the Place de Greve. There, likewise, you served me\nvaliantly.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said D'Artagnan, without his self-command being able to\nprevent a blush from mounting to his eyes--\"you know that also, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it.\"\n\nThe king possessed a piercing glance and an infallible judgment when it\nwas his object to read men's minds. \"You have something to say,\" said\nhe to the musketeer, \"something to say which you do not say. Come, speak\nfreely, monsieur; you know that I told you, once and for all, that you\nare to be always quite frank with me.\"\n\n\"Well, sire! what I have to say is this, that I would prefer being made\ncaptain of the musketeers for having charged a battery at the head of my\ncompany, or taken a city, than for causing two wretches to be hung.\"\n\n\"Is this quite true you tell me?\"\n\n\"And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?\"\n\n\"Because I have known you well, monsieur; you cannot repent of having\ndrawn your sword for me.\"\n\n\"Well, in that your majesty is deceived, and greatly; yes, I do repent\nof having drawn my sword on account of the results that action produced;\nthe poor men who were hung, sire, were neither your enemies nor mine;\nand they could not defend themselves.\"\n\nThe king preserved silence for a moment. \"And your companion, M.\nd'Artagnan, does he partake of your repentance?\"\n\n\"My companion?\"\n\n\"Yes, you were not alone, I have been told.\"\n\n\"Alone, where?\"\n\n\"At the Place de Greve.\"\n\n\"No, sire, no,\" said D'Artagnan, blushing at the idea that the king\nmight have a suspicion that he, D'Artagnan, had wished to engross to\nhimself all the glory that belonged to Raoul; \"no, _mordioux!_ and as\nyour majesty says, I had a companion, and a good companion, too.\"\n\n\"A young man?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; a young man. Oh! your majesty must accept my compliments,\nyou are as well informed of things out of doors as things within. It is\nM. Colbert who makes all these fine reports to the king.\"\n\n\"M. Colbert has said nothing but good of you, M. d'Artagnan, and he\nwould have met with a bad reception if he had come to tell me anything\nelse.\"\n\n\"That is fortunate!\"\n\n\"But he also said much good of that young man.\"\n\n\"And with justice,\" said the musketeer.\n\n\"In short, it appears that this young man is a fire-eater,\" said Louis,\nin order to sharpen the sentiment which he mistook for envy.\n\n\"A fire-eater! Yes, sire,\" repeated D'Artagnan, delighted on his part to\ndirect the king's attention to Raoul.\n\n\"Do you not know his name?\"\n\n\"Well, I think--\"\n\n\"You know him then?\"\n\n\"I have known him nearly five-and-twenty years, sire.\"\n\n\"Why, he is scarcely twenty-five years old!\" cried the king.\n\n\"Well, sire! I have known him ever since he was born, that is all.\"\n\n\"Do you affirm that?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"your majesty questions me with a mistrust in\nwhich I recognize another character than your own. M. Colbert, who has\nso well informed you, has he not forgotten to tell you that this young\nman is the son of my most intimate friend?\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sire. The father of the Vicomte de Bragelonne is M. le\nComte de la Fere, who so powerfully assisted in the restoration of King\nCharles II. Bragelonne comes of a valiant race, sire.\"\n\n\"Then he is the son of that nobleman who came to me, or rather to M.\nMazarin, on the part of King Charles II., to offer me his alliance?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sire.\"\n\n\"And the Comte de la Fere is a great soldier, say you?\"\n\n\"Sire, he is a man who has drawn his sword more times for the king, your\nfather, than there are, at present, months in the happy life of your\nmajesty.\"\n\nIt was Louis XIV. who now bit his lip.\n\n\"That is well, M. d'Artagnan, very well! And M. le Comte de la Fere is\nyour friend, say you?\"\n\n\"For about forty years; yes, sire. Your majesty may see that I do not\nspeak to you of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Should you be glad to see this young man, M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Delighted, sire.\"\n\nThe king touched his bell, and an usher appeared. \"Call M. de\nBragelonne,\" said the king.\n\n\"Ah! ah! he is here?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"He is on guard to-day, at the Louvre, with the company of the gentlemen\nof monsieur le prince.\"\n\nThe king had scarcely ceased speaking, when Raoul presented himself,\nand, on seeing D'Artagnan, smiled on him with that charming smile which\nis only found upon the lips of youth.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said D'Artagnan, familiarly, to Raoul, \"the king will\nallow you to embrace me; only tell his majesty you thank him.\"\n\nRaoul bowed so gracefully, that Louis, to whom all superior qualities\nwere pleasing when they did not overshadow his own, admired his beauty,\nstrength, and modesty.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the king, addressing Raoul, \"I have asked monsieur\nle prince to be kind enough to give you up to me; I have received his\nreply, and you belong to me from this morning. Monsieur le prince was a\ngood master, but I hope you will not lose by the exchange.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Raoul, be satisfied; the king has some good in him,\" said\nD'Artagnan, who had fathomed the character of Louis, and who played\nwith his self-love, within certain limits; always observing, be it\nunderstood, the proprieties and flattering, even when he appeared to be\nbantering.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Bragelonne, with voice soft and musical, and with the\nnatural and easy elocution he inherited from his father; \"Sire, it is\nnot from to-day that I belong to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, I know,\" said the king, \"you mean your enterprise of the Greve.\nThat day, you were truly mine, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Sire, it is not of that day I would speak; it would not become me\nto refer to so paltry a service in the presence of such a man as M.\nd'Artagnan. I would speak of a circumstance which created an epoch in my\nlife, and which consecrated me, from the age of sixteen, to the devoted\nservice of your majesty.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the king, \"what was that circumstance? Tell me,\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"This is it, sire.--When I was setting out on my first campaign, that is\nto say, to join the army of monsieur le prince, M. le Comte de la Fere\ncame to conduct me as far as Saint-Denis, where the remains of King\nLouis XIII. wait, upon the lowest steps of the funeral _basilique_, a\nsuccessor, whom God will not send him, I hope, for many years. Then\nhe made me swear upon the ashes of our masters, to serve royalty,\nrepresented by you--incarnate in you, sire--to serve it in word, in\nthought, and in action. I swore, and God and the dead were witnesses to\nmy oath. During ten years, sire, I have not so often as I desired had\noccasion to keep it. I am a soldier of your majesty, and nothing else;\nand, on calling me nearer to you, I do not change my master, I only\nchange my garrison.\"\n\nRaoul was silent and bowed. Louis still listened after he had done\nspeaking.\n\n\"_Mordioux!_\" cried D'Artagnan, \"that was well spoken! was it not, your\nmajesty? A good race! a noble race!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the king, without, however daring to manifest\nhis emotion, for it had no other cause than contact with a nature\nintrinsically noble. \"Yes, monsieur, you say truly:--wherever you were,\nyou were the king's. But in changing your garrison, believe me you will\nfind an advancement of which you are worthy.\"\n\nRaoul saw that this ended what the king had to say to him. And with\nthe perfect tact which characterized his refined nature, he bowed and\nretired.\n\n\"Is there anything else, monsieur, of which you have to inform me?\" said\nthe king, when he found himself again alone with D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Yes, sire, and I kept that news for the last, for it is sad, and will\nclothe European royalty in mourning.\"\n\n\"What do you tell me?\"\n\n\"Sire, in passing through Blois, a word, a sad word, echoed from the\npalace, struck my ear.\"\n\n\"In truth, you terrify me, M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Sire, this word was pronounced to me by a _piqueur_, who wore crape on\nhis arm.\"\n\n\"My uncle, Gaston of Orleans, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Sire, he has rendered his last sigh.\"\n\n\"And I was not warned of it!\" cried the king, whose royal susceptibility\nsaw an insult in the absence of this intelligence.\n\n\"Oh! do not be angry, sire,\" said D'Artagnan; \"neither the couriers\nof Paris, nor the couriers of the whole world, can travel with your\nservant; the courier from Blois will not be here these two hours, and he\nrides well, I assure you, seeing that I only passed him on the thither\nside of Orleans.\"\n\n\"My uncle Gaston,\" murmured Louis, pressing his hand to his brow, and\ncomprising in those three words all that his memory recalled of that\nsymbol of opposing sentiments.\n\n\"Eh! yes, sire, it is thus,\" said D'Artagnan, philosophically replying\nto the royal thought, \"it is thus the past flies away.\"\n\n\"That is true, monsieur, that is true; but there remains for us, thank\nGod! the future; and we will try to make it not too dark.\"\n\n\"I feel confidence in your majesty on that head,\" said D'Artagnan,\nbowing, \"and now--\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur; I had forgotten the hundred leagues you have\njust ridden. Go, monsieur, take care of one of the best of soldiers, and\nwhen you have reposed a little, come and place yourself at my disposal.\"\n\n\"Sire, absent or present, I am always yours.\"\n\nD'Artagnan bowed and retired. Then, as if he had only come from\nFontainebleau, he quickly traversed the Louvre to rejoin Bragelonne.\n\n\n\nChapter II. A Lover and His Mistress.\n\nWhilst the wax-lights were burning in the castle of Blois, around the\ninanimate body of Gaston of Orleans, that last representative of the\npast; whilst the _bourgeois_ of the city were thinking out his epitaph,\nwhich was far from being a panegyric; whilst madame the dowager, no\nlonger remembering that in her young days she had loved that senseless\ncorpse to such a degree as to fly the paternal palace for his sake,\nwas making, within twenty paces of the funeral apartment, her little\ncalculations of interest and her little sacrifices of pride; other\ninterests and other prides were in agitation in all the parts of the\ncastle into which a living soul could penetrate. Neither the lugubrious\nsounds of the bells, nor the voices of the chanters, nor the splendor\nof the wax-lights through the windows, nor the preparations for the\nfuneral, had power to divert the attention of two persons, placed at a\nwindow of the interior court--a window that we are acquainted with,\nand which lighted a chamber forming part of what were called the little\napartments. For the rest, a joyous beam of the sun, for the sun appeared\nto care little for the loss France had just suffered; a sunbeam, we say,\ndescended upon them, drawing perfumes from the neighboring flowers, and\nanimating the walls themselves. These two persons, so occupied, not by\nthe death of the duke, but by the conversation which was the consequence\nof that death, were a young woman and a young man. The latter personage,\na man of from twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, with a mien\nsometimes lively and sometimes dull, making good use of two large eyes,\nshaded with long eye-lashes, was short of stature and swart of skin; he\nsmiled with an enormous, but well-furnished mouth, and his pointed chin,\nwhich appeared to enjoy a mobility nature does not ordinarily grant to\nthat portion of the countenance, leant from time to time very lovingly\ntowards his interlocutrix, who, we must say, did not always draw back so\nrapidly as strict propriety had a right to require. The young girl--we\nknow her, for we have already seen her, at that very same window, by the\nlight of that same sun--the young girl presented a singular mixture of\nshyness and reflection; she was charming when she laughed, beautiful\nwhen she became serious; but, let us hasten to say, she was more\nfrequently charming than beautiful. These two appeared to have attained\nthe culminating point of a discussion--half-bantering, half-serious.\n\n\"Now, Monsieur Malicorne,\" said the young girl, \"does it, at length,\nplease you that we should talk reasonably?\"\n\n\"You believe that that is very easy, Mademoiselle Aure,\" replied the\nyoung man. \"To do what we like, when we can only do what we are able--\"\n\n\"Good! there he is bewildered in his phrases.\"\n\n\"Who, I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you; quit that lawyer's logic, my dear.\"\n\n\"Another impossibility. Clerk I am, Mademoiselle de Montalais.\"\n\n\"Demoiselle I am, Monsieur Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Alas, I know it well, and you overwhelm me by your rank; so I will say\nno more to you.\"\n\n\"Well, no, I don't overwhelm you; say what you have to tell me--say it,\nI insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Well, I obey you.\"\n\n\"That is truly fortunate.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is dead.\"\n\n\"Ah, _peste!_ that's news! And where do you come from, to be able to\ntell us that?\"\n\n\"I come from Orleans, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"And is that all the news you bring?\"\n\n\"Ah, no; I am come to tell you that Madame Henrietta of England is\ncoming to marry the king's brother.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Malicorne, you are insupportable with your news of the last\ncentury. Now, mind, if you persist in this bad habit of laughing at\npeople, I will have you turned out.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Yes, for really you exasperate me.\"\n\n\"There, there. Patience, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"You want to make yourself of consequence; I know well enough why. Go!\"\n\n\"Tell me, and I will answer you frankly, yes, if the thing be true.\"\n\n\"You know that I am anxious to have that commission of lady of honor,\nwhich I have been foolish enough to ask of you, and you do not use your\ncredit.\"\n\n\"Who, I?\" Malicorne cast down his eyes, joined his hands, and assumed\nhis sullen air. \"And what credit can the poor clerk of a procurer have,\npray?\"\n\n\"Your father has not twenty thousand livres a year for nothing, M.\nMalicorne.\"\n\n\"A provincial fortune, Mademoiselle de Montalais.\"\n\n\"Your father is not in the secrets of monsieur le prince for nothing.\"\n\n\"An advantage which is confined to lending monseigneur money.\"\n\n\"In a word, you are not the most cunning young fellow in the province\nfor nothing.\"\n\n\"You flatter me!\"\n\n\"Who, I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Since I maintain that I have no credit, and you maintain I have.\"\n\n\"Well, then,--my commission?\"\n\n\"Well,--your commission?\"\n\n\"Shall I have it, or shall I not?\"\n\n\"You shall have it.\"\n\n\"Ay, but when?\"\n\n\"When you like.\"\n\n\"Where is it, then?\"\n\n\"In my pocket.\"\n\n\"How--in your pocket?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd, with a smile, Malicorne drew from his pocket a letter, upon which\nmademoiselle seized as a prey, and which she read eagerly. As she read,\nher face brightened.\n\n\"Malicorne,\" cried she after having read it, \"In truth, you are a good\nlad.\"\n\n\"What for, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Because you might have been paid for this commission, and you have\nnot.\" And she burst into a loud laugh, thinking to put the clerk out of\ncountenance; but Malicorne sustained the attack bravely.\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" said he. It was now Montalais who was\ndisconcerted in her turn. \"I have declared my sentiments to you,\"\ncontinued Malicorne. \"You have told me three times, laughing all the\nwhile, that you did not love me; you have embraced me once without\nlaughing, and that is all I want.\"\n\n\"All?\" said the proud and coquettish Montalais, in a tone through which\nthe wounded pride was visible.\n\n\"Absolutely all, mademoiselle,\" replied Malicorne.\n\n\"Ah!\"--And this monosyllable indicated as much anger as the young man\nmight have expected gratitude. He shook his head quietly.\n\n\"Listen, Montalais,\" said he, without heeding whether that familiarity\npleased his mistress or not; \"let us not dispute about it.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Because during the year which I have known you, you might have had me\nturned out of doors twenty times if I did not please you.\"\n\n\"Indeed; and on what account should I have had you turned out?\"\n\n\"Because I have been sufficiently impertinent for that.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,--yes, that's true.\"\n\n\"You see plainly that you are forced to avow it,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Monsieur Malicorne!\"\n\n\"Don't let us be angry; if you have retained me, then it has not been\nwithout cause.\"\n\n\"It is not, at least, because I love you,\" cried Montalais.\n\n\"Granted. I will even say, at this moment, I am certain that you hate\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have never spoken so truly.\"\n\n\"Well, on my part, I detest you.\"\n\n\"Ah! I take the act.\"\n\n\"Take it. You find me brutal and foolish; on my part I find you have a\nharsh voice, and your face is too often distorted with anger. At this\nmoment you would allow yourself to be thrown out of that window rather\nthan allow me to kiss the tip of your finger; I would precipitate myself\nfrom the top of the balcony rather than touch the hem of your robe. But,\nin five minutes, you will love me, and I shall adore you. Oh, it is just\nso.\"\n\n\"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"And I swear it.\"\n\n\"Coxcomb!\"\n\n\"And then, that is not the true reason. You stand in need of me, Aure,\nand I of you. When it pleases you to be gay, I make you laugh; when it\nsuits me to be loving, I look at you. I have given you a commission\nof lady of honor which you wished for; you will give me, presently,\nsomething I wish for.\"\n\n\"I will?\"\n\n\"Yes, you will; but, at this moment, my dear Aure, I declare to you that\nI wish for absolutely nothing, so be at ease.\"\n\n\"You are a frightful man, Malicorne; I was going to rejoice at getting\nthis commission, and thus you quench my joy.\"\n\n\"Good; there is no time lost,--you will rejoice when I am gone.\"\n\n\"Go, then; and after--\"\n\n\"So be it; but in the first place, a piece of advice.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Resume your good-humor,--you are ugly when you pout.\"\n\n\"Coarse!\"\n\n\"Come, let us tell the truth to each other, while we are about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Malicorne! Bad-hearted man!\"\n\n\"Oh, Montalais! Ungrateful girl!\"\n\nThe young man leant with his elbow upon the window-frame; Montalais\ntook a book and opened it. Malicorne stood up, brushed his hat with his\nsleeve, smoothed down his black doublet;--Montalais, though pretending\nto read, looked at him out of the corner of her eye.\n\n\"Good!\" cried she, furious; \"he has assumed his respectful air--and he\nwill pout for a week.\"\n\n\"A fortnight, mademoiselle,\" said Malicorne, bowing.\n\nMontalais lifted up her little doubled fist. \"Monster!\" said she; \"oh!\nthat I were a man!\"\n\n\"What would you do to me?\"\n\n\"I would strangle you.\"\n\n\"Ah! very well, then,\" said Malicorne; \"I believe I begin to desire\nsomething.\"\n\n\"And what do you desire, Monsieur Demon? That I should lose my soul from\nanger?\"\n\nMalicorne was rolling his hat respectfully between his fingers; but, all\nat once, he let fall his hat, seized the young girl by the shoulders,\npulled her towards him, and sealed her mouth with two lips that were\nvery warm, for a man pretending to so much indifference. Aure would have\ncried out, but the cry was stifled in his kiss. Nervous and, apparently,\nangry, the young girl pushed Malicorne against the wall.\n\n\"Good!\" said Malicorne, philosophically, \"that's enough for six weeks.\nAdieu, mademoiselle, accept my very humble salutation.\" And he made\nthree steps towards the door.\n\n\"Well! no,--you shall not go!\" cried Montalais, stamping with her little\nfoot. \"Stay where you are! I order you!\"\n\n\"You order me?\"\n\n\"Yes; am I not mistress?\"\n\n\"Of my heart and soul, without doubt.\"\n\n\"A pretty property! _ma foi!_ The soul is silly and the heart dry.\"\n\n\"Beware, Montalais, I know you,\" said Malicorne; \"you are going to fall\nin love with your humble servant.\"\n\n\"Well, yes!\" said she, hanging round his neck with childish indolence,\nrather than with loving abandonment. \"Well, yes! for I must thank you at\nleast.\"\n\n\"And for what?\"\n\n\"For the commission; is it not my whole future?\"\n\n\"And mine.\"\n\nMontalais looked at him.\n\n\"It is frightful,\" said she, \"that one can never guess whether you are\nspeaking seriously or not.\"\n\n\"I cannot speak more seriously. I was going to Paris,--you are going\nthere,--we are going there.\"\n\n\"And so it was for that motive only you have served me; selfish fellow!\"\n\n\"What would you have me say, Aure? I cannot live without you.\"\n\n\"Well! in truth, it is just so with me; you are, nevertheless, it must\nbe confessed, a very bad-hearted young man.\"\n\n\"Aure, my dear Aure, take care! if you take to calling me names again,\nyou know the effect they produce upon me, and I shall adore you.\" And so\nsaying, Malicorne drew the young girl a second time towards him. But at\nthat instant a step resounded on the staircase. The young people were so\nclose, that they would have been surprised in the arms of each other, if\nMontalais had not violently pushed Malicorne, with his back against\nthe door, just then opening. A loud cry, followed by angry reproaches,\nimmediately resounded. It was Madame de Saint-Remy who uttered the cry\nand the angry words. The unlucky Malicorne almost crushed her between\nthe wall and the door she was coming in at.\n\n\"It is again that good-for-nothing!\" cried the old lady. \"Always here!\"\n\n\"Ah, madame!\" replied Malicorne, in a respectful tone; \"it is eight long\ndays since I was here.\"\n\n\n\nChapter III. In Which We at Length See the True Heroine of this History\nAppear.\n\nBehind Madame de Saint-Remy stood Mademoiselle de la Valliere. She heard\nthe explosion of maternal anger, and as she divined the cause of it,\nshe entered the chamber trembling, and perceived the unlucky Malicorne,\nwhose woeful countenance might have softened or set laughing whoever\nobserved it coolly. He had promptly intrenched himself behind a large\nchair, as if to avoid the first attacks of Madame de Saint-Remy; he had\nno hopes of prevailing with words, for she spoke louder than he, and\nwithout stopping; but he reckoned upon the eloquence of his gestures.\nThe old lady would neither listen to nor see anything; Malicorne had\nlong been one of her antipathies. But her anger was too great not to\noverflow from Malicorne on his accomplice. Montalais had her turn.\n\n\"And you, mademoiselle; you may be certain I shall inform madame of what\nis going on in the apartment of one of her ladies of honor?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear mother!\" cried Mademoiselle de la Valliere, \"for mercy's sake,\nspare--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, mademoiselle, and do not uselessly trouble yourself\nto intercede for unworthy people; that a young maid of honor like you\nshould be subjected to a bad example is, certes, a misfortune great\nenough; but that you should sanction it by your indulgence is what I\nwill not allow.\"\n\n\"But in truth,\" said Montalais, rebelling again, \"I do not know under\nwhat pretense you treat me thus. I am doing no harm, I suppose?\"\n\n\"And that great good-for-nothing, mademoiselle,\" resumed Madame de\nSaint-Remy, pointing to Malicorne, \"is he here to do any good, I ask\nyou?\"\n\n\"He is neither here for good nor harm, madame; he comes to see me, that\nis all.\"\n\n\"It is all very well! all very well!\" said the old lady. \"Her royal\nhighness shall be informed of it, and she will judge.\"\n\n\"At all events, I do not see why,\" replied Montalais, \"it should be\nforbidden M. Malicorne to have intentions towards me, if his intentions\nare honorable.\"\n\n\"Honorable intentions with such a face!\" cried Madame de Saint-Remy.\n\n\"I thank you in the name of my face, madame,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Come, my daughter, come,\" continued Madame de Saint-Remy; \"we will\ngo and inform madame that at the very moment she is weeping for her\nhusband, at the moment when we are all weeping for a master in this\nold castle of Blois, the abode of grief, there are people who amuse\nthemselves with flirtations!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried both the accused, with one voice.\n\n\"A maid of honor! a maid of honor!\" cried the old lady, lifting her\nhands towards heaven.\n\n\"Well! it is there you are mistaken, madame,\" said Montalais, highly\nexasperated; \"I am no longer a maid of honor, of madame's at least.\"\n\n\"Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle? That is well! I\ncannot but applaud such a determination, and I do applaud it.\"\n\n\"I do not give in my resignation, madame; I take another service,--that\nis all.\"\n\n\"In the _bourgeoisie_ or in the _robe?_\" asked Madame de Saint-Remy,\ndisdainfully.\n\n\"Please to learn, madame, that I am not a girl to serve either\n_bourgeoises_ or _robines_; and that instead of the miserable court at\nwhich you vegetate, I am going to reside in a court almost royal.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! a royal court,\" said Madame de Saint-Remy, forcing a laugh; \"a\nroyal court! What do you think of that, my daughter?\"\n\nAnd she turned towards Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whom she would by\nmain force have dragged away from Montalais, and who instead of obeying\nthe impulse of Madame de Saint-Remy, looked first at her mother and then\nat Montalais with her beautiful conciliatory eyes.\n\n\"I did not say a royal court, madame,\" replied Montalais; \"because\nMadame Henrietta of England, who is about to become the wife of S. A.\nR. Monsieur, is not a queen. I said almost royal, and I spoke correctly,\nsince she will be sister-in-law to the king.\"\n\nA thunderbolt falling upon the castle of Blois would not have astonished\nMadame de Saint-Remy more than the last sentence of Montalais.\n\n\"What do you say? of Son Altesse Royale Madame Henrietta?\" stammered out\nthe old lady.\n\n\"I say I am going to belong to her household, as maid of honor; that is\nwhat I say.\"\n\n\"As maid of honor!\" cried, at the same time, Madame de Saint-Remy with\ndespair, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere with delight.\n\n\"Yes, madame, as maid of honor.\"\n\nThe old lady's head sank down as if the blow had been too severe for\nher. But, almost immediately recovering herself, she launched a last\nprojectile at her adversary.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said she; \"I have heard of many of these sorts of promises\nbeforehand, which often lead people to flatter themselves with wild\nhopes, and at the last moment, when the time comes to keep the promises,\nand have the hopes realized, they are surprised to see the great credit\nupon which they reckoned vanish like smoke.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, the credit of my protector is incontestable and his\npromises are as good as deeds.\"\n\n\"And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful\nprotector?\"\n\n\"Oh! _mon Dieu!_ no! it is that gentleman there,\" said Montalais,\npointing to Malicorne, who, during this scene, had preserved the most\nimperturbable coolness, and the most comic dignity.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" cried Madame de Saint-Remy, with an explosion of hilarity,\n\"monsieur is your protector! Is the man whose credit is so powerful, and\nwhose promises are as good as deeds, Monsieur Malicorne!\"\n\nMalicorne bowed.\n\nAs to Montalais, as her sole reply, she drew the brevet from her pocket,\nand showed it to the old lady.\n\n\"Here is the _brevet_,\" said she.\n\nAt once all was over. As soon as she had cast a rapid glance over this\nfortunate _brevet_, the good lady clasped her hands, an unspeakable\nexpression of envy and despair contracted her countenance, and she\nwas obliged to sit down to avoid fainting. Montalais was not malicious\nenough to rejoice extravagantly at her victory, or to overwhelm the\nconquered enemy, particularly when that enemy was the mother of her\nfriend; she used then, but did not abuse her triumph. Malicorne was\nless generous; he assumed noble _poses_ in his _fauteuil_ and stretched\nhimself out with a familiarity which, two hours earlier, would have\ndrawn upon him threats of a caning.\n\n\"Maid of honor to the young madame!\" repeated Madame de Saint-Remy,\nstill but half convinced.\n\n\"Yes, madame, and through the protection of M. Malicorne, moreover.\"\n\n\"It is incredible!\" repeated the old lady: \"is it not incredible,\nLouise?\" But Louise did not reply; she was sitting, thoughtfully, almost\nsad; passing one had over her beautiful brow, she sighed heavily.\n\n\"Well, but, monsieur,\" said Madame de Saint-Remy, all at once, \"how did\nyou manage to obtain this post?\"\n\n\"I asked for it, madame.\"\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"One of my friends.\"\n\n\"And you have friends sufficiently powerful at court to give you such\nproofs of their credit?\"\n\n\"It appears so.\"\n\n\"And may one ask the name of these friends?\"\n\n\"I did not say I had many friends, madame, I said I had one friend.\"\n\n\"And that friend is called?\"\n\n\"_Peste!_ madame, you go too far! When one has a friend as powerful as\nmine, we do not publish his name in that fashion, in open day, in order\nthat he may be stolen from us.\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur, to be silent as to that name; for I think it\nwould be pretty difficult for you to tell it.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Montalais, \"if the friend does not exist, the\n_brevet_ does, and that cuts short the question.\"\n\n\"Then, I conceive,\" said Madame de Saint-Remy, with the gracious smile\nof the cat who is going to scratch, \"when I found monsieur here just\nnow--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He brought you the _brevet_.\"\n\n\"Exactly, madame; you have guessed rightly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, nothing can be more moral or proper.\"\n\n\"I think so, madame.\"\n\n\"And I have been wrong, as it appears, in reproaching you,\nmademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Very wrong, madame; but I am so accustomed to your reproaches, that I\npardon you these.\"\n\n\"In that case, let us begone, Louise; we have nothing to do but retire.\nWell!\"\n\n\"Madame!\" said La Valliere starting, \"did you speak?\"\n\n\"You do not appear to be listening, my child.\"\n\n\"No, madame, I was thinking.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"A thousand things.\"\n\n\"You bear me no ill-will, at least, Louise?\" cried Montalais, pressing\nher hand.\n\n\"And why should I, my dear Aure?\" replied the girl in a voice soft as a\nflute.\n\n\"_Dame!_\" resumed Madame de Saint-Remy; \"if she did bear you a little\nill-will, poor girl, she could not be much blamed.\"\n\n\"And why should she bear me ill-will, good gracious?\"\n\n\"It appears to me that she is of as good a family, and as pretty as\nyou.\"\n\n\"Mother! mother!\" cried Louise.\n\n\"Prettier a hundred times, madame--not of a better family; but that does\nnot tell me why Louise should bear me ill-will.\"\n\n\"Do you think it will be very amusing for her to be buried alive at\nBlois, when you are going to shine at Paris?\"\n\n\"But, madame, it is not I who prevent Louise following me thither; on\nthe contrary, I should certainly be most happy if she came there.\"\n\n\"But it appears that M. Malicorne, who is all-powerful at court--\"\n\n\"Ah! so much the worse, madame,\" said Malicorne, \"every one for himself\nin this poor world.\"\n\n\"Malicorne! Malicorne!\" said Montalais. Then stooping towards the young\nman:--\n\n\"Occupy Madame de Saint-Remy, either in disputing with her, or making\nit up with her; I must speak to Louise.\" And, at the same time, a soft\npressure of the hand recompensed Malicorne for his future obedience.\nMalicorne went grumbling towards Madame de Saint-Remy, whilst Montalais\nsaid to her friend, throwing one arm around her neck:--\n\n\"What is the matter? Tell _me_. Is it true that you would not love me if\nI were to shine, as your mother says?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said the young girl, with difficulty restraining her tears;\n\"on the contrary, I rejoice at your good fortune.\"\n\n\"Rejoice! why, one would say you are ready to cry!\"\n\n\"Do people never weep except from envy?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I understand; I am going to Paris and that word Paris recalls\nto your mind a certain cavalier--\"\n\n\"Aure!\"\n\n\"A certain cavalier who formerly lived near Blois, and who now resides\nat Paris.\"\n\n\"In truth, I know not what ails me, but I feel stifled.\"\n\n\"Weep, then, weep, as you cannot give me a smile!\"\n\nLouise raised her sweet face, which the tears, rolling down one after\nthe other, illumined like diamonds.\n\n\"Come, confess,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"What shall I confess?\"\n\n\"What makes you weep; people don't weep without cause. I am your friend;\nwhatever you would wish me to do, I will do. Malicorne is more powerful\nthan you would think. Do you wish to go to Paris?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed Louise.\n\n\"Do you wish to come to Paris?\"\n\n\"To remain here alone, in this old castle, I who have enjoyed the\ndelightful habit of listening to your songs, of pressing your hand,\nof running about the park with you. Oh! how I shall be _ennuyee!_ how\nquickly I shall die!\"\n\n\"Do you wish to come to Paris?\"\n\nLouise breathed another sigh.\n\n\"You do not answer me.\"\n\n\"What would you that I should reply?\"\n\n\"Yes or no; that is not very difficult, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are very fortunate, Montalais!\"\n\n\"That is to say you would like to be in my place.\"\n\nLouise was silent.\n\n\"Little obstinate thing!\" said Montalais; \"did ever any one keep her\nsecrets from her friend thus? But, confess that you would like to come\nto Paris; confess that you are dying with the wish to see Raoul again.\"\n\n\"I cannot confess that.\"\n\n\"Then you are wrong.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Because--do you not see this _brevet?_\"\n\n\"To be sure I do.\"\n\n\"Well, I would have got you a similar one.\"\n\n\"By whose means?\"\n\n\"Malicorne's.\"\n\n\"Aure, are you telling the truth? Is that possible?\"\n\n\"Malicorne is there; and what he has done for me, he surely can do for\nyou.\"\n\nMalicorne had heard his name pronounced twice; he was delighted\nat having an opportunity of coming to a conclusion with Madame de\nSaint-Remy, and he turned round:--\n\n\"What is the question, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Come hither, Malicorne,\" said Montalais, with an imperious gesture.\nMalicorne obeyed.\n\n\"A _brevet_ like this,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"A _brevet_ like this; that is plain enough.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I want one--I must have one!\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! you must have one!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, is it not, M. Malicorne?\" said Louise, with her\nsweet, soft voice.\n\n\"If it is for _you_, mademoiselle--\"\n\n\"For me. Yes, Monsieur Malicorne, it _would_ be for me.\"\n\n\"And if Mademoiselle de Montalais asks it at the same time--\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Montalais does not ask it, she requires it.\"\n\n\"Well! we will endeavor to obey you, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"And you will have her named?\"\n\n\"We will try.\"\n\n\"No evasive answers, Louise de la Valliere shall be maid of honor to\nMadame Henrietta within a week.\"\n\n\"How you talk!\"\n\n\"Within a week, or else--\"\n\n\"Well! or else?\"\n\n\"You may take back your _brevet_, Monsieur Malicorne; I will not leave\nmy friend.\"\n\n\"Dear Montalais!\"\n\n\"That is right. Keep your _brevet_; Mademoiselle de la Valliere shall be\na maid of honor.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Quite true.\"\n\n\"I may then hope to go to Paris?\"\n\n\"Depend on it.\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur Malicorne, what joy!\" cried Louise, clapping her hands,\nand bounding with pleasure.\n\n\"Little dissembler!\" said Montalais, \"try again to make me believe you\nare not in love with Raoul.\"\n\nLouise blushed like a rose in June, but instead of replying, she ran and\nembraced her mother. \"Madame,\" said she, \"do you know that M. Malicorne\nis going to have me appointed maid of honor?\"\n\n\"M. Malicorne is a prince in disguise,\" replied the old lady, \"he is\nall-powerful, seemingly.\"\n\n\"Should you also like to be a maid of honor?\" asked Malicorne of Madame\nde Saint-Remy. \"Whilst I am about it, I might as well get everybody\nappointed.\"\n\nAnd upon that he went away, leaving the poor lady quite disconcerted.\n\n\"Humph!\" murmured Malicorne as he descended the stairs,--\"Humph! there\ngoes another note of a thousand livres! but I must get through as well\nas I can; my friend Manicamp does nothing for nothing.\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Malicorne and Manicamp.\n\nThe introduction of these two new personages into this history and that\nmysterious affinity of names and sentiments, merit some attention on the\npart of both historian and reader. We will then enter into some details\nconcerning Messieurs Malicorne and Manicamp. Malicorne, we know, had\nmade the journey to Orleans in search of the _brevet_ destined for\nMademoiselle de Montalais, the arrival of which had produced such a\nstrong feeling at the castle of Blois. At that moment, M. de Manicamp\nwas at Orleans. A singular person was this M. de Manicamp; a very\nintelligent young fellow, always poor, always needy, although he dipped\nhis hand freely into the purse of M. le Comte de Guiche, one of the best\nfurnished purses of the period. M. le Comte de Guiche had had, as\nthe companion of his boyhood, this De Manicamp, a poor gentleman,\nvassal-born, of the house of Gramont. M. de Manicamp, with his tact\nand talent had created himself a revenue in the opulent family of the\ncelebrated marechal. From his infancy he had, with calculation beyond\nhis age, lent his mane and complaisance to the follies of the Comte de\nGuiche. If his noble companion had stolen some fruit destined for\nMadame la Marechale, if he had broken a mirror, or put out a dog's eye,\nManicamp declared himself guilty of the crime committed, and received\nthe punishment, which was not made the milder for falling on the\ninnocent. But this was the way this system of abnegation was paid\nfor: instead of wearing such mean habiliments as his paternal fortunes\nentitled him to, he was able to appear brilliant, superb, like a young\nnoble of fifty thousand livres a year. It was not that he was mean in\ncharacter or humble in spirit; no, he was a philosopher, or rather he\nhad the indifference, the apathy, the obstinacy which banish from man\nevery sentiment of the supernatural. His sole ambition was to spend\nmoney. But, in this respect, the worthy M. de Manicamp was a gulf. Three\nor four times every year he drained the Comte de Guiche, and when the\nComte de Guiche was thoroughly drained, when he had turned out his\npockets and his purse before him, when he declared that it would be at\nleast a fortnight before paternal munificence would refill those pockets\nand that purse, Manicamp lost all his energy, he went to bed, remained\nthere, ate nothing and sold his handsome clothes, under the pretense\nthat, remaining in bed, he did not want them. During this prostration\nof mind and strength, the purse of the Comte de Guiche was getting full\nagain, and when once filled, overflowed into that of De Manicamp, who\nbought new clothes, dressed himself again, and recommenced the same\nlife he had followed before. The mania of selling his new clothes for\na quarter of what they were worth, had rendered our hero sufficiently\ncelebrated in Orleans, a city where, in general, we should be puzzled\nto say why he came to pass his days of penitence. Provincial _debauches,\npetits-maitres_ of six hundred livres a year, shared the fragments of\nhis opulence.\n\nAmong the admirers of these splendid toilettes, our friend Malicorne\nwas conspicuous; he was the son of a syndic of the city, of whom M.\nde Conde, always needy as a De Conde, often borrowed money at enormous\ninterest. M. Malicorne kept the paternal money-chest; that is to\nsay, that in those times of easy morals, he had made for himself, by\nfollowing the example of his father, and lending at high interest for\nshort terms, a revenue of eighteen hundred livres, without reckoning\nsix hundred livres furnished by the generosity of the syndic; so that\nMalicorne was the king of the gay youth of Orleans, having two thousand\nfour hundred livres to scatter, squander, and waste on follies of every\nkind. But, quite contrary to Manicamp, Malicorne was terribly ambitious.\nHe loved from ambition; he spent money out of ambition; and he would\nhave ruined himself for ambition. Malicorne had determined to rise, at\nwhatever price it might cost, and for this, whatever price it did cost,\nhe had given himself a mistress and a friend. The mistress, Mademoiselle\nde Montalais, was cruel, as regarded love; but she was of a noble\nfamily, and that was sufficient for Malicorne. The friend had little or\nno friendship, but he was the favorite of the Comte de Guiche, himself\nthe friend of Monsieur, the king's brother; and that was sufficient for\nMalicorne. Only, in the chapter of charges, Mademoiselle de Montalais\ncost _per annum_:--ribbons, gloves, and sweets, a thousand livres.\nDe Manicamp cost--money lent, never returned--from twelve to fifteen\nhundred livres _per annum_. So that there was nothing left for\nMalicorne. Ah! yes, we are mistaken; there was left the paternal strong\nbox. He employed a mode of proceeding, upon which he preserved the most\nprofound secrecy, and which consisted in advancing to himself, from\nthe coffers of the syndic, half a dozen year's profits, that is to\nsay, fifteen thousand livres, swearing to himself--observe, quite to\nhimself--to repay this deficiency as soon as an opportunity should\npresent itself. The opportunity was expected to be the concession of\na good post in the household of Monsieur, when that household would be\nestablished at the period of his marriage. This juncture had arrived,\nand the household was about to be established. A good post in the family\nof a prince of the blood, when it is given by the credit, and on the\nrecommendation of a friend, like the Comte de Guiche, is worth at least\ntwelve thousand livres _per annum_; and by the means which M. Malicorne\nhad taken to make his revenues fructify, twelve thousand livres might\nrise to twenty thousand. Then, when once an incumbent of this post, he\nwould marry Mademoiselle de Montalais. Mademoiselle de Montalais, of\na half noble family, not only would be dowered, but would ennoble\nMalicorne. But, in order that Mademoiselle de Montalais, who had not a\nlarge patrimonial fortune, although an only daughter, should be suitably\ndowered, it was necessary that she should belong to some great princess,\nas prodigal as the dowager Madame was covetous. And in order that the\nwife should not be of one party whilst the husband belonged to the\nother, a situation which presents serious inconveniences, particularly\nwith characters like those of the future consorts--Malicorne had\nimagined the idea of making the central point of union the household of\nMonsieur, the king's brother. Mademoiselle de Montalais would be maid of\nhonor to Madame. M. Malicorne would be officer to Monsieur.\n\nIt is plain the plan was formed by a clear head; it is plain, also,\nthat it had been bravely executed. Malicorne had asked Manicamp to ask\na _brevet_ of maid of honor of the Comte de Guiche; and the Comte de\nGuiche had asked this _brevet_ of Monsieur, who had signed it without\nhesitation. The constructive plan of Malicorne--for we may well suppose\nthat the combinations of a mind as active as his were not confined\nto the present, but extended to the future--the constructive plan of\nMalicorne, we say, was this:--To obtain entrance into the household of\nMadame Henrietta for a woman devoted to himself, who was intelligent,\nyoung, handsome, and intriguing; to learn, by means of this woman, all\nthe feminine secrets of the young household; whilst he, Malicorne, and\nhis friend Manicamp, should, between them, know all the male secrets\nof the young community. It was by these means that a rapid and splendid\nfortune might be acquired at one and the same time. Malicorne was a\nvile name; he who bore it had too much wit to conceal this truth from\nhimself; but an estate might be purchased; and Malicorne of some place,\nor even De Malicorne itself, for short, would ring more nobly on the\near.\n\nIt was not improbable that a most aristocratic origin might be hunted up\nby the heralds for this name of Malicorne; might it not come from some\nestate where a bull with mortal horns had caused some great misfortune,\nand baptized the soil with the blood it had spilt? Certes, this plan\npresented itself bristling with difficulties: but the greatest of all\nwas Mademoiselle de Montalais herself. Capricious, variable, close,\ngiddy, free, prudish, a virgin armed with claws, Erigone stained with\ngrapes, she sometimes overturned, with a single dash of her white\nfingers, or with a single puff from her laughing lips, the edifice which\nhad exhausted Malicorne's patience for a month.\n\nLove apart, Malicorne was happy; but this love, which he could not help\nfeeling, he had the strength to conceal with care; persuaded that at the\nleast relaxing of the ties by which he had bound his Protean female,\nthe demon would overthrow and laugh at him. He humbled his mistress by\ndisdaining her. Burning with desire, when she advanced to tempt him,\nhe had the art to appear ice, persuaded that if he opened his arms, she\nwould run away laughing at him. On her side, Montalais believed she\ndid not love Malicorne; whilst, on the contrary, in reality she did.\nMalicorne repeated to her so often his protestation of indifference,\nthat she finished, sometimes, by believing him; and then she believed\nshe detested Malicorne. If she tried to bring him back by coquetry,\nMalicorne played the coquette better than she could. But what made\nMontalais hold to Malicorne in an indissoluble fashion, was that\nMalicorne always came cram full of fresh news from the court and the\ncity; Malicorne always brought to Blois a fashion, a secret, or a\nperfume; that Malicorne never asked for a meeting, but, on the contrary,\nrequired to be supplicated to receive the favors he burned to obtain. On\nher side, Montalais was no miser with stories. By her means, Malicorne\nlearnt all that passed at Blois, in the family of the dowager Madame;\nand he related to Manicamp tales that made him ready to die with\nlaughing, which the latter, out of idleness, took ready-made to M. de\nGuiche, who carried them to Monsieur.\n\nSuch, in two words, was the woof of petty interests and petty\nconspiracies which united Blois with Orleans, and Orleans with Pairs;\nand which was about to bring into the last named city where she was to\nproduce so great a revolution, the poor little La Valliere, who was far\nfrom suspecting, as she returned joyfully, leaning on the arm of her\nmother, for what a strange future she was reserved. As to the good\nman, Malicorne--we speak of the syndic of Orleans--he did not see more\nclearly into the present than others did into the future; and had no\nsuspicion as he walked, every day, between three and five o'clock, after\nhis dinner, upon the Place Sainte-Catherine, in his gray coat, cut\nafter the fashion of Louis XIII. and his cloth shoes with great knots of\nribbon, that it was he who was paying for all those bursts of laughter,\nall those stolen kisses, all those whisperings, all those little\nkeepsakes, and all those bubble projects which formed a chain of\nforty-five leagues in length, from the palais of Blois to the Palais\nRoyal.\n\n\n\nChapter V: Manicamp and Malicorne.\n\nMalicorne, then, left Blois, as we have said, and went to find his\nfriend, Manicamp, then in temporary retreat in the city of Orleans. It\nwas just at the moment when that young nobleman was employed in selling\nthe last decent clothing he had left. He had, a fortnight before,\nextorted from the Comte de Guiche a hundred pistoles, all he had, to\nassist in equipping him properly to go and meet Madame, on her arrival\nat Le Havre. He had drawn from Malicorne, three days before, fifty\npistoles, the price of the _brevet_ obtained for Montalais. He had then\nno expectation of anything else, having exhausted all his resources,\nwith the exception of selling a handsome suit of cloth and satin,\nembroidered and laced with gold, which had been the admiration of the\ncourt. But to be able to sell this suit, the last he had left,--as we\nhave been forced to confess to the reader--Manicamp had been obliged\nto take to his bed. No more fire, no more pocket-money, no more\nwalking-money, nothing but sleep to take the place of repasts, companies\nand balls. It has been said--\"He who sleeps, dines;\" but it has never\nbeen affirmed--He who sleeps, plays--or, He who sleeps, dances.\nManicamp, reduced to this extremity of neither playing nor dancing, for\na week at least, was, consequently, very sad; he was expecting a usurer,\nand saw Malicorne enter. A cry of distress escaped him.\n\n\"Eh! what!\" said he, in a tone which nothing can describe, \"is that you\nagain, dear friend?\"\n\n\"Humph! you are very polite!\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Ay, but look you, I was expecting money, and, instead of money, I see\n_you_.\"\n\n\"And suppose I brought you some money?\"\n\n\"Oh! that would be quite another thing. You are very welcome, my dear\nfriend!\"\n\nAnd he held out his hand, not for the hand of Malicorne, but for the\npurse. Malicorne pretended to be mistaken, and gave him his hand.\n\n\"And the money?\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"My dear friend, if you wish to have it, earn it.\"\n\n\"What must be done for it?\"\n\n\"Earn it, _parbleu!_\"\n\n\"And after what fashion?\"\n\n\"Oh! that is rather trying, I warn you.\"\n\n\"The devil!\"\n\n\"You must get out of bed, and go immediately to M. le Comte de Guiche.\"\n\n\"I get up!\" said Manicamp, stretching himself in his bed, complacently,\n\"oh, no, thank you!\"\n\n\"You have sold all your clothes?\"\n\n\"No, I have one suit left, the handsomest even, but I expect a\npurchaser.\"\n\n\"And the _chausses?_\"\n\n\"Well, if you look, you will see them on that chair.\"\n\n\"Very well! since you have some _chausses_ and a _pourpoint_ left, put\nyour legs into the first and your back into the other; have a horse\nsaddled, and set off.\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"_Morbleu!_ don't you know, then, that M. de Guiche is at Etampes?\"\n\n\"No, I thought he was at Paris. You will then only have fifteen leagues\nto go, instead of thirty.\"\n\n\"You are a wonderfully clever fellow! If I were to ride fifteen leagues\nin these clothes, they would never be fit to put on again; and, instead\nof selling them for thirty pistoles, I should be obliged to take\nfifteen.\"\n\n\"Sell them for whatever you like, but I must have a second commission of\nmaid of honor.\"\n\n\"Good! for whom? Is Montalais doubled, then?\"\n\n\"Vile fellow!--It is you who are doubled. You swallow up two\nfortunes--mine, and that of M. le Comte de Guiche.\"\n\n\"You should say, that of M. le Comte de Guiche and yours.\"\n\n\"That is true; honor where it is due; but I return to my _brevet_.\"\n\n\"And you are wrong.\"\n\n\"Prove me that.\"\n\n\"My friend, there will only be twelve maids of honor for madame; I have\nalready obtained for you what twelve hundred women are trying for, and\nfor that I was forced to employ all my diplomacy.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I know you have been quite heroic, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"We know what we are about,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"To whom do you tell that? When I am king, I promise you one thing.\"\n\n\"What? To call yourself Malicorne the First?\"\n\n\"No; to make you superintendent of my finances; but that is not the\nquestion now.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately.\"\n\n\"The present affair is to procure for me a second place of maid of\nhonor.\"\n\n\"My friend, if you were to promise me the price of heaven, I would\ndecline to disturb myself at this moment.\"\n\nMalicorne chinked the money in his pocket.\n\n\"There are twenty pistoles here,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"And what would you do with twenty pistoles, _mon Dieu!_\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Malicorne, a little angry, \"suppose I were to add them to\nthe five hundred you already owe me?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Manicamp, stretching out his hand again, \"and\nfrom that point of view I can accept them. Give them to me.\"\n\n\"An instant, what the devil! it is not only holding out your hand that\nwill do; if I give you the twenty pistoles, shall I have my _brevet?_\"\n\n\"To be sure you shall.\"\n\n\"Soon?\"\n\n\"To-day.\"\n\n\"Oh! take care! Monsieur de Manicamp; you undertake much, and I do not\nask that. Thirty leagues in a day is too much, you would kill yourself.\"\n\n\"I think nothing impossible when obliging a friend.\"\n\n\"You are quite heroic.\"\n\n\"Where are the twenty pistoles?\"\n\n\"Here they are,\" said Malicorne, showing them.\n\n\"That's well.\"\n\n\"Yes, but my dear M. Manicamp, you would consume them in post-horses\nalone!\"\n\n\"No, no, make yourself easy on that score.\"\n\n\"Pardon me. Why, it is fifteen leagues from this place to Etampes?\"\n\n\"Fourteen.\"\n\n\"Well! fourteen be it; fourteen leagues makes seven posts; at twenty\n_sous_ the post, seven _livres_; seven _livres_ the courier, fourteen;\nas many for coming back, twenty-eight! as much for bed and supper, that\nmakes sixty _livres_ this complaisance would cost.\"\n\nManicamp stretched himself like a serpent in his bed, and fixing his two\ngreat eyes upon Malicorne, \"You are right,\" said he; \"I could not return\nbefore to-morrow;\" and he took the twenty pistoles.\n\n\"Now, then, be off!\"\n\n\"Well, as I cannot be back before to-morrow, we have time.\"\n\n\"Time for what?\"\n\n\"Time to play.\"\n\n\"What do you wish to play with?\"\n\n\"Your twenty pistoles, _pardieu!_\"\n\n\"No; you always win.\"\n\n\"I will wager them, then.\"\n\n\"Against what?\"\n\n\"Against twenty others.\"\n\n\"And what shall be the object of the wager?\"\n\n\"This. We have said it was fourteen leagues to Etampes.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And fourteen leagues back?\"\n\n\"Doubtless.\"\n\n\"Well; for these twenty-eight leagues you cannot allow less than\nfourteen hours?\"\n\n\"That is agreed.\"\n\n\"One hour to find the Comte de Guiche.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"And an hour to persuade him to write a letter to Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"Sixteen hours in all?\"\n\n\"You reckon as well as M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"It is now twelve o'clock.\"\n\n\"Half-past.\"\n\n\"_Hein!_--you have a handsome watch!\"\n\n\"What were you saying?\" said Malicorne, putting his watch quickly back\ninto his fob.\n\n\"Ah! true; I was offering to lay you twenty pistoles against these you\nhave lent me, that you will have the Comte de Guiche's letter in--\"\n\n\"How soon?\"\n\n\"In eight hours.\"\n\n\"Have you a winged horse, then?\"\n\n\"That is no matter. Will you bet?\"\n\n\"I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In hand?\"\n\n\"In hand.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so; I lay,\" said Malicorne, curious enough to know how this\nseller of clothes would get through.\n\n\"Is it agreed?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Pass me the pen, ink, and paper.\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nManicamp raised himself with a sigh, and leaning on his left elbow, in\nhis best hand, traced the following lines:--\n\n\"Good for an order for a place of maid of honor to Madame, which M. le\nComte de Guiche will take upon him to obtain at sight. DE MANICAMP.\"\n\nThis painful task accomplished, he laid himself down in bed again.\n\n\"Well!\" asked Malicorne, \"what does this mean?\"\n\n\"That means that if you are in a hurry to have the letter from the Comte\nde Guiche for Monsieur, I have won my wager.\"\n\n\"How the devil is that?\"\n\n\"That is transparent enough, I think; you take that paper.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And you set out instead of me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"You put your horses to their best speed.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"In six hours you will be at Etampes; in seven hours you have the letter\nfrom the comte, and I shall have won my wager without stirring from my\nbed, which suits me and you too, at the same time, I am very sure.\"\n\n\"Decidedly, Manicamp, you are a great man.\"\n\n\"_Hein!_ I know that.\"\n\n\"I am to start then for Etampes?\"\n\n\"Directly.\"\n\n\"I am to go to the Comte de Guiche with this order?\"\n\n\"He will give you a similar one for Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur will approve?\"\n\n\"Instantly.\"\n\n\"And I shall have my _brevet?_\"\n\n\"You will.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Well, I hope I behave genteely?\"\n\n\"Adorably.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You do as you please, then, with the Comte de Guiche, Manicamp?\"\n\n\"Except making money of him--everything?\"\n\n\"_Diable!_ the exception is annoying; but then, if instead of asking him\nfor money, you were to ask--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something important.\"\n\n\"What do you call important?\"\n\n\"Well! suppose one of your friends asked you to render him a service?\"\n\n\"I would not render it to him.\"\n\n\"Selfish fellow!\"\n\n\"Or at least I would ask him what service he would render me in\nexchange.\"\n\n\"Ah! that, perhaps, is fair. Well, that friend speaks to you.\"\n\n\"What, you, Malicorne?\"\n\n\"Yes; I.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! you are rich, then?\"\n\n\"I have still fifty pistoles left.\"\n\n\"Exactly the sum I want. Where are those fifty pistoles?\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Malicorne, slapping his pocket.\n\n\"Then speak, my friend; what do you want?\"\n\nMalicorne took up the pen, ink, and paper again, and presented them all\nto Manicamp. \"Write!\" said he.\n\n\"Dictate!\"\n\n\"An order for a place in the household of Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Manicamp, laying down the pen, \"a place in the household of\nMonsieur for fifty pistoles?\"\n\n\"You mistook me, my friend; you did not hear plainly.\"\n\n\"What did you say, then?\"\n\n\"I said five hundred.\"\n\n\"And the five hundred?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\nManicamp devoured the rouleau with his eyes; but this time Malicorne\nheld it at a distance.\n\n\"Eh! what do you say to that? Five hundred pistoles.\"\n\n\"I say it is for nothing, my friend,\" said Manicamp, taking up the pen\nagain, \"and you exhaust my credit. Dictate.\"\n\nMalicorne continued:\n\n\"Which my friend the Comte de Guiche will obtain for my friend\nMalicorne.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"Pardon me, you have forgotten to sign.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is true. The five hundred pistoles?\"\n\n\"Here are two hundred and fifty of them.\"\n\n\"And the other two hundred and fifty?\"\n\n\"When I am in possession of my place.\"\n\nManicamp made a face.\n\n\"In that case give me the recommendation back again.\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"To add two words to it.\"\n\n\"Two words?\"\n\n\"Yes; two words only.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"In haste.\"\n\nMalicorne returned the recommendation; Manicamp added the words.\n\n\"Good,\" said Malicorne, taking back the paper.\n\nManicamp began to count out the pistoles.\n\n\"There want twenty,\" said he.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"The twenty I have won.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"By laying that you would have the letter from the Comte de Guiche in\neight hours.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's fair,\" and he gave him the twenty pistoles.\n\nManicamp began to scoop up his gold by handfuls, and pour it in cascades\nupon his bed.\n\n\"This second place,\" murmured Malicorne, whilst drying his paper,\n\"which, at first glance appears to cost me more than the first, but--\"\nHe stopped, took up the pen in his turn, and wrote to Montalais:--\n\n\"MADEMOISELLE,--Announce to your friend that her commission will not be\nlong before it arrives; I am setting out to get it signed: that will be\ntwenty-eight leagues I shall have gone for the love of you.\"\n\nThen with his sardonic smile, taking up the interrupted sentence:--\"This\nplace,\" said he, \"at first glance, appears to have cost more than the\nfirst; but--the benefit will be, I hope, in proportion with the\nexpense, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere will bring me back more than\nMademoiselle de Montalais, or else,--or else my name is not Malicorne.\nFarewell, Manicamp,\" and he left the room.\n\n\n\nChapter VI. The Courtyard of the Hotel Grammont.\n\nOn Malicorne's arrival at Orleans, he was informed that the Comte de\nGuiche had just set out for Paris. Malicorne rested himself for a couple\nof hours, and then prepared to continue his journey. He reached Paris\nduring the night, and alighted at a small hotel, where, in his previous\njourneys to the capital, he had been accustomed to put up, and at\neight o'clock the next morning presented himself at the Hotel Grammont.\nMalicorne arrived just in time, for the Comte de Guiche was on the point\nof taking leave of Monsieur before setting out for Le Havre, where the\nprincipal members of the French nobility had gone to await Madame's\narrival from England. Malicorne pronounced the name of Manicamp, and was\nimmediately admitted. He found the Comte de Guiche in the courtyard\nof the Hotel Grammont, inspecting his horses, which his trainers and\nequerries were passing in review before him. The count, in the presence\nof his tradespeople and of his servants, was engaged in praising or\nblaming, as the case seemed to deserve, the appointments, horses, and\nharness that were being submitted to him; when, in the midst of this\nimportant occupation, the name of Manicamp was announced.\n\n\"Manicamp!\" he exclaimed; \"let him enter by all means.\" And he advanced\na few steps toward the door.\n\nMalicorne slipped through the half-open door, and looking at the Comte\nde Guiche, who was surprised to see a face he did not recognize, instead\nof the one he expected, said: \"Forgive me, monsieur le comte, but I\nbelieve a mistake has been made. M. Manicamp himself was announced to\nyou, instead of which it is only an envoy from him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed De Guiche, coldly; \"and what do you bring me?\"\n\n\"A letter, monsieur le comte.\" Malicorne handed him the first document,\nand narrowly watched the count's face, who, as he read it, began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, \"another maid of honor? Are all the maids of honor\nin France, then, under his protection?\"\n\nMalicorne bowed.\n\n\"Why does he not come himself?\" he inquired.\n\n\"He is confined to his bed.\"\n\n\"The deuce! he has no money then, I suppose,\" said De Guiche, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \"What does he do with his money?\"\n\nMalicorne made a movement, to indicate that upon this subject he was as\nignorant as the count himself. \"Why does he not make use of his credit,\nthen?\" continued De Guiche.\n\n\"With regard to that, I think--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That Manicamp has credit with no one but yourself, monsieur le comte!\"\n\n\"He will not be at Le Havre, then?\" Whereupon Malicorne made another\nmovement.\n\n\"But every one will be there.\"\n\n\"I trust, monsieur le comte, that he will not neglect so excellent an\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"He should be at Paris by this time.\"\n\n\"He will take the direct road perhaps to make up for lost time.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"At Orleans.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said De Guiche, \"you seem to me a man of very good taste.\"\n\nMalicorne was wearing some of Manicamp's old-new clothes. He bowed in\nreturn, saying, \"You do me a very great honor, monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?\"\n\n\"My name is Malicorne, monsieur.\"\n\n\"M. de Malicorne, what do you think of these pistol-holsters?\"\n\nMalicorne was a man of great readiness and immediately understood the\nposition of affairs. Besides, the \"de\" which had been prefixed to his\nname, raised him to the rank of the person with whom he was conversing.\nHe looked at the holsters with the air of a connoisseur and said,\nwithout hesitation: \"Somewhat heavy, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said De Guiche to the saddler, \"this gentleman, who\nunderstands these matters well, thinks the holsters heavy, a complaint I\nhad already made.\" The saddler was full of excuses.\n\n\"What do you think,\" asked De Guiche, \"of this horse, which I have just\npurchased?\"\n\n\"To look at it, it seems perfect, monsieur le comte; but I must mount it\nbefore I give you my opinion.\"\n\n\"Do so, M. de Malicorne, and ride him round the court two or three\ntimes.\"\n\nThe courtyard of the hotel was so arranged, that whenever there was any\noccasion for it, it could be used as a riding-school. Malicorne, with\nperfect ease, arranged the bridle and snaffle-reins, placed his left\nhand on the horse's mane, and, with his foot in the stirrup, raised\nhimself and seated himself in the saddle. At first, he made the horse\nwalk the whole circuit of the court-yard at a foot-pace; next at a trot;\nlastly at a gallop. He then drew up close to the count, dismounted, and\nthrew the bridle to a groom standing by. \"Well,\" said the count, \"what\ndo you think of it, M. de Malicorne?\"\n\n\"This horse, monsieur le comte, is of the Mecklenburg breed. In looking\nwhether the bit suited his mouth, I saw that he was rising seven, the\nvery age when the training of a horse intended for a charger should\ncommence. The forehand is light. A horse which holds its head high, it\nis said, never tires his rider's hand. The withers are rather low. The\ndrooping of the hind-quarters would almost make me doubt the purity of\nits German breed, and I think there is English blood in him. He stands\nwell on his legs, but he trots high, and may cut himself, which requires\nattention to be paid to his shoeing. He is tractable; and as I made him\nturn round and change his feet, I found him quick and ready in doing\nso.\"\n\n\"Well said, M. de Malicorne,\" exclaimed the comte; \"you are a judge of\nhorses, I perceive;\" then, turning towards him again, he continued, \"you\nare most becomingly dressed, M. de Malicorne. That is not a provincial\ncut, I presume. Such a style of dress is not to be met with at Tours or\nOrleans.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur le comte; my clothes were made at Paris.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about that. But let us resume our own affair.\nManicamp wishes for the appointment of a second maid of honor.\"\n\n\"You perceive what he has written, monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"For whom was the first appointment?\"\n\nMalicorne felt the color rise in his face as he answered hurriedly.\n\n\"A charming maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! you are acquainted with her?\"\n\n\"We are affianced, or nearly so.\"\n\n\"That is quite another thing, then; a thousand compliments,\" exclaimed\nDe Guiche, upon whose lips a courtier's jest was already fitting, but\nto whom the word \"affianced,\" addressed by Malicorne with respect to\nMademoiselle de Montalais, recalled the respect due to women.\n\n\"And for whom is the second appointment destined?\" asked De Guiche; \"is\nit for anyone to whom Manicamp may happen to be affianced? In that case\nI pity her, poor girl! for she will have a sad fellow for a husband.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur le comte; the second appointment is for Mademoiselle de la\nBaume le Blanc de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Unknown,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"Unknown? yes, monsieur,\" said Malicorne, smiling in his turn.\n\n\"Very good. I will speak to Monsieur about it. By the by, she is of\ngentle birth?\"\n\n\"She belongs to a very good family and is maid of honor to Madame.\"\n\n\"That's well. Will you accompany me to Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, if I may be permitted the honor.\"\n\n\"Have you your carriage?\"\n\n\"No; I came here on horseback.\"\n\n\"Dressed as you are?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I posted from Orleans, and I changed my traveling suit\nfor the one I have on, in order to present myself to you.\"\n\n\"True, you already told me you had come from Orleans;\" saying which he\ncrumpled Manicamp's letter in his hand, and thrust it in his pocket.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Malicorne, timidly; \"but I do not think you\nhave read all.\"\n\n\"Not read all, do you say?\"\n\n\"No; there were two letters in the same envelope.\"\n\n\"Oh! are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Let us look, then,\" said the count, as he opened the letter again.\n\n\"Ah! you are right,\" he said opening the paper which he had not yet\nread.\n\n\"I suspected it,\" he continued--\"another application for an appointment\nunder Monsieur. This Manicamp is a regular vampire:--he is carrying on a\ntrade in it.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur le comte, he wishes to make a present of it.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To myself, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why did you not say so at once, my dear M. Mauvaisecorne?\"\n\n\"Malicorne, monsieur le comte.\"\n\n\"Forgive me; it is that Latin that bothers me--that terrible mine of\netymologies. Why the deuce are young men of family taught Latin? _Mala_\nand _mauvaise_--you understand it is the same thing. You will forgive\nme, I trust, M. de Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Your kindness affects me much, monsieur: but it is a reason why I\nshould make you acquainted with one circumstance without any delay.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I was not born a gentleman. I am not without courage, and not\naltogether deficient in ability; but my name is Malicorne simply.\"\n\n\"You appear to me, monsieur!\" exclaimed the count, looking at the astute\nface of his companion, \"to be a most agreeable man. Your face pleases\nme, M. Malicorne, and you must possess some indisputably excellent\nqualities to have pleased that egotistical Manicamp. Be candid and tell\nme whether you are not some saint descended upon the earth.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"For the simple reason that he makes you a present of anything. Did you\nnot say that he intended to make you a present of some appointment in\nthe king's household?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, count; but, if I succeed in obtaining the\nappointment, you, and not he, will have bestowed it on me.\"\n\n\"Besides he will not have given it to you for nothing, I suppose. Stay,\nI have it;--there is a Malicorne at Orleans who lends money to the\nprince.\"\n\n\"I think that must be my father, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Ah! the prince has the father, and that terrible dragon of a Manicamp\nhas the son. Take care, monsieur, I know him. He will fleece you\ncompletely.\"\n\n\"The only difference is, that I lend without interest,\" said Malicorne,\nsmiling.\n\n\"I was correct in saying you were either a saint or very much resembled\none. M. Malicorne, you shall have the post you want, or I will forfeit\nmy name.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur le comte, what a debt of gratitude shall I not owe you?\"\nsaid Malicorne, transported.\n\n\"Let us go to the prince, my dear M. Malicorne.\" And De Guiche proceeded\ntoward the door, desiring Malicorne to follow him. At the very moment\nthey were about to cross the threshold, a young man appeared on the\nother side. He was from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, of pale\ncomplexion, bright eyes and brown hair and eyebrows. \"Good-day,\" said\nhe, suddenly, almost pushing De Guiche back into the courtyard again.\n\n\"Is that you, De Wardes?--What! and booted, spurred and whip in hand,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"The most befitting costume for a man about to set off for Le Havre.\nThere will be no one left in Paris to-morrow.\" And hereupon he saluted\nMalicorne with great ceremony, whose handsome dress gave him the\nappearance of a prince.\n\n\"M. Malicorne,\" said De Guiche to his friend. De Wardes bowed.\n\n\"M. de Wardes,\" said Guiche to Malicorne, who bowed in return. \"By the\nby, De Wardes,\" continued De Guiche, \"you who are so well acquainted\nwith these matters, can you tell us, probably, what appointments are\nstill vacant at the court; or rather in the prince's household?\"\n\n\"In the prince's household,\" said De Wardes looking up with an air of\nconsideration, \"let me see--the appointment of the master of the horse\nis vacant, I believe.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Malicorne, \"there is no question of such a post as that,\nmonsieur; my ambition is not nearly so exalted.\"\n\nDe Wardes had a more penetrating observation than De Guiche, and\nfathomed Malicorne immediately. \"The fact is,\" he said, looking at him\nfrom head to foot, \"a man must be either a duke or a peer to fill that\npost.\"\n\n\"All I solicit,\" said Malicorne, \"is a very humble appointment; I am of\nlittle importance, and I do not rank myself above my position.\"\n\n\"M. Malicorne, whom you see here,\" said De Guiche to De Wardes, \"is a\nvery excellent fellow, whose only misfortune is that of not being of\ngentle birth. As far as I am concerned, you know, I attach little value\nto those who have but gentle birth to boast of.\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said De Wardes; \"but will you allow me to remark, my dear\ncount, that, without rank of some sort, one can hardly hope to belong to\nhis royal highness's household?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the count, \"court etiquette is absolute. The\ndevil!--we never so much as gave it a thought.\"\n\n\"Alas! a sad misfortune for me, monsieur le comte,\" said Malicorne,\nchanging color.\n\n\"Yet not without remedy, I hope,\" returned De Guiche.\n\n\"The remedy is found easily enough,\" exclaimed De Wardes; \"you can be\ncreated a gentleman. His Eminence, the Cardinal Mazarin, did nothing\nelse from morning till night.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, De Wardes,\" said the count; \"no jests of that kind; it ill\nbecomes us to turn such matters into ridicule. Letters of nobility, it\nis true, are purchasable; but that is a sufficient misfortune without\nthe nobles themselves laughing at it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, De Guiche, you're quite a Puritan, as the English say.\"\n\nAt this moment the Vicomte de Bragelonne was announced by one of the\nservants in the courtyard, in precisely the same manner as he would have\ndone in a room.\n\n\"Come here, my dear Raoul. What! you, too, booted and spurred? You are\nsetting off, then?\"\n\nBragelonne approached the group of young men, and saluted them with that\nquiet and serious manner peculiar to him. His salutation was principally\naddressed to De Wardes, with whom he was unacquainted, and whose\nfeatures, on his perceiving Raoul, had assumed a strange sternness\nof expression. \"I have come, De Guiche,\" he said, \"to ask your\ncompanionship. We set off for Le Havre, I presume.\"\n\n\"This is admirable--delightful. We shall have a most enjoyable journey.\nM. Malicorne, M. Bragelonne--ah! M. de Wardes, let me present you.\" The\nyoung men saluted each other in a restrained manner. Their very natures\nseemed, from the beginning, disposed to take exception to each other. De\nWardes was pliant, subtle, full of dissimulation; Raoul was calm, grave,\nand upright. \"Decide between us--between De Wardes and myself, Raoul.\"\n\n\"Upon what subject?\"\n\n\"Upon the subject of noble birth.\"\n\n\"Who can be better informed on that subject than a De Gramont?\"\n\n\"No compliments; it is your opinion I ask.\"\n\n\"At least, inform me of the subject under discussion.\"\n\n\"De Wardes asserts that the distribution of titles is abused; I, on\nthe contrary, maintain that a title is useless to the man on whom it is\nbestowed.\"\n\n\"And you are correct,\" said Bragelonne, quietly.\n\n\"But, monsieur le vicomte,\" interrupted De Wardes, with a kind of\nobstinacy, \"I affirm that it is I who am correct.\"\n\n\"What was your opinion, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I was saying that everything is done in France at the present moment,\nto humiliate men of family.\"\n\n\"And by whom?\"\n\n\"By the king himself. He surrounds himself with people who cannot show\nfour quarterings.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said De Guiche, \"where could you possibly have seen that, De\nWardes?\"\n\n\"One example will suffice,\" he returned, directing his look fully upon\nRaoul.\n\n\"State it then.\"\n\n\"Do you know who has just been nominated captain-general of the\nmusketeers?--an appointment more valuable than a peerage; for it gives\nprecedence over all the marechals of France.\"\n\nRaoul's color mounted in his face; for he saw the object De Wardes had\nin view. \"No; who has been appointed? In any case it must have been\nvery recently, for the appointment was vacant eight days ago; a proof of\nwhich is, that the king refused Monsieur, who solicited the post for one\nof his _proteges_.\"\n\n\"Well, the king refused it to Monsieur's _protege_, in order to bestow\nit upon the Chevalier d'Artagnan, a younger brother of some Gascon\nfamily, who has been trailing his sword in the ante-chambers during the\nlast thirty years.\"\n\n\"Forgive me if I interrupt you,\" said Raoul, darting a glance full\nof severity at De Wardes; \"but you give me the impression of being\nunacquainted with the gentleman of whom you are speaking.\"\n\n\"I not acquainted with M. d'Artagnan? Can you tell me, monsieur, who\ndoes _not_ know him?\"\n\n\"Those who _do_ know him, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, with still greater\ncalmness and sternness of manner, \"are in the habit of saying, that if\nhe is not as good a gentleman as the king--which is not his fault--he is\nthe equal of all the kings of the earth in courage and loyalty. Such is\nmy opinion, monsieur; and I thank heaven I have known M. d'Artagnan from\nmy birth.\"\n\nDe Wardes was about to reply, when De Guiche interrupted him.\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The Portrait of Madame.\n\nThe discussion was becoming full of bitterness. De Guiche perfectly\nunderstood the whole matter, for there was in Bragelonne's face a look\ninstinctively hostile, while in that of De Wardes there was something\nlike a determination to offend. Without inquiring into the different\nfeelings which actuated his two friends, De Guiche resolved to ward off\nthe blow which he felt was on the point of being dealt by one of them,\nand perhaps by both. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we must take our leave\nof each other, I must pay a visit to Monsieur. You, De Wardes, will\naccompany me to the Louvre, and you, Raoul, will remain here master of\nthe house; and as all that is done here is under your advice, you will\nbestow the last glance upon my preparations for departure.\"\n\nRaoul, with the air of one who neither seeks nor fears a quarrel, bowed\nhis head in token of assent, and seated himself upon a bench in the sun.\n\"That is well,\" said De Guiche, \"remain where you are, Raoul, and tell\nthem to show you the two horses I have just purchased; you will give me\nyour opinion, for I only bought them on condition that you ratified the\npurchase. By the by, I have to beg your pardon for having omitted to\ninquire after the Comte de la Fere.\" While pronouncing these latter\nwords, he closely observed De Wardes, in order to perceive what effect\nthe name of Raoul's father would produce upon him. \"I thank you,\"\nanswered the young man, \"the count is very well.\" A gleam of deep hatred\npassed into De Wardes's eyes. De Guiche, who appeared not to notice the\nforeboding expression, went up to Raoul, and grasping him by the hand,\nsaid,--\"It is agreed, then, Bragelonne, is it not, that you will rejoin\nus in the courtyard of the Palais Royal?\" He then signed to De Wardes to\nfollow him, who had been engaged in balancing himself first on one foot,\nthen on the other. \"We are going,\" said he, \"come, M. Malicorne.\"\nThis name made Raoul start; for it seemed that he had already heard it\npronounced before, but he could not remember on what occasion.\nWhile trying to recall it half-dreamily, yet half-irritated at his\nconversation with De Wardes, the three young men set out on their way\ntowards the Palais Royal, where Monsieur was residing. Malicorne learned\ntwo things; the first, that the young men had something to say to each\nother; and the second, that he ought not to walk in the same line with\nthem; and therefore he walked behind. \"Are you mad?\" said De Guiche\nto his companion, as soon as they had left the Hotel de Grammont; \"you\nattack M. d'Artagnan, and that, too, before Raoul.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said De Wardes, \"what then?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'what then?'\"\n\n\"Certainly, is there any prohibition against attacking M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"But you know very well that M. d'Artagnan was one of those celebrated\nand terrible four men who were called the musketeers.\"\n\n\"That they may be; but I do not perceive why, on that account, I should\nbe forbidden to hate M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"What cause has he given you?\"\n\n\"Me! personally, none.\"\n\n\"Why hate him, therefore?\"\n\n\"Ask my dead father that question.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear De Wardes, you surprise me. M. d'Artagnan is not one to\nleave unsettled any _enmity_ he may have to arrange, without completely\nclearing his account. Your father, I have heard, carried matters with a\nhigh hand. Moreover, there are no enmities so bitter that they cannot be\nwashed away by blood, by a good sword-thrust loyally given.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, my dear De Guiche, this inveterate dislike existed\nbetween my father and M. d'Artagnan, and when I was quite a child,\nhe acquainted me with the reason for it, and, as forming part of my\ninheritance, I regard it as a particular legacy bestowed upon me.\"\n\n\"And does this hatred concern M. d'Artagnan alone?\"\n\n\"As for that, M. d'Artagnan was so intimately associated with his three\nfriends, that some portion of the full measure of my hatred falls to\ntheir lot, and that hatred is of such a nature, whenever the opportunity\noccurs, they shall have no occasion to complain of their allowance.\"\n\nDe Guiche had kept his eyes fixed on De Wardes, and shuddered at\nthe bitter manner in which the young man smiled. Something like a\npresentiment flashed across his mind; he knew that the time had passed\naway for _grands coups entre gentilshommes_; but that the feeling of\nhatred treasured up in the mind, instead of being diffused abroad, was\nstill hatred all the same; that a smile was sometimes as full of meaning\nas a threat; and, in a word, that to the fathers who had hated with\ntheir hearts and fought with their arms, would now succeed the sons, who\nwould indeed hate with their hearts, but would no longer combat their\nenemies save by means of intrigue or treachery. As, therefore, it\ncertainly was not Raoul whom he could suspect either of intrigue or\ntreachery, it was on Raoul's account that De Guiche trembled. However,\nwhile these gloomy forebodings cast a shade of anxiety over De Guiche's\ncountenance, De Wardes had resumed the entire mastery over himself.\n\n\"At all events,\" he observed, \"I have no personal ill-will towards M. de\nBragelonne; I do not know him even.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said De Guiche, with a certain amount of severity in his\ntone of voice, \"do not forget one circumstance, that Raoul is my most\nintimate friend;\" a remark at which De Wardes bowed.\n\nThe conversation terminated there, although De Guiche tried his\nutmost to draw out his secret from him; but, doubtless, De Wardes had\ndetermined to say nothing further, and he remained impenetrable. De\nGuiche therefore promised himself a more satisfactory result with Raoul.\nIn the meantime they had reached the Palais Royal, which was surrounded\nby a crowd of lookers-on. The household belonging to Monsieur awaited\nhis command to mount their horses, in order to form part of the escort\nof the ambassadors, to whom had been intrusted the care of bringing the\nyoung princess to Paris. The brilliant display of horses, arms, and\nrich liveries, afforded some compensation in those times, thanks to the\nkindly feelings of the people, and to the traditions of deep devotion\nto their sovereigns, for the enormous expenses charged upon the taxes.\nMazarin had said: \"Let them sing, provided they pay;\" while Louis XIV.'s\nremark was, \"Let them look.\" Sight had replaced the voice; the people\ncould still look but they were no longer allowed to sing. De Guiche left\nDe Wardes and Malicorne at the bottom of the grand staircase, while\nhe himself, who shared the favor and good graces of Monsieur with the\nChevalier de Lorraine, who always smiled at him most affectionately,\nthough he could not endure him, went straight to the prince's\napartments, whom he found engaged in admiring himself in the glass, and\nrouging his face. In a corner of the cabinet, the Chevalier de Lorraine\nwas extended full length upon some cushions, having just had his long\nhair curled, with which he was playing in the same manner a woman would\nhave done. The prince turned round as the count entered, and perceiving\nwho it was, said: \"Ah! is that you, De Guiche; come here and tell me the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"You know, my lord, it is one of my defects to speak the truth.\"\n\n\"You will hardly believe, De Guiche, how that wicked chevalier has\nannoyed me.\"\n\nThe chevalier shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Why, he pretends,\" continued the prince, \"that Mademoiselle Henrietta\nis better looking as a woman than I am as a man.\"\n\n\"Do not forget, my lord,\" said De Guiche, frowning slightly, \"you\nrequire me to speak the truth.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the prince, tremblingly.\n\n\"Well, and I shall tell it you.\"\n\n\"Do not be in a hurry, Guiche,\" exclaimed the prince, \"you have plenty\nof time; look at me attentively, and try to recollect Madame. Besides,\nher portrait is here. Look at it.\" And he held out to him a miniature of\nthe finest possible execution. De Guiche took it, and looked at it for a\nlong time attentively.\n\n\"Upon my honor, my lord, this is indeed a most lovely face.\"\n\n\"But look at me, count, look at me,\" said the prince, endeavoring to\ndirect upon himself the attention of the count, who was completely\nabsorbed in contemplation of the portrait.\n\n\"It is wonderful,\" murmured Guiche.\n\n\"Really one would imagine you had never seen the young lady before.\"\n\n\"It is true, my lord, I have seen her but it was five years ago; there\nis a great difference between a child twelve years old, and a girl of\nseventeen.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your opinion?\"\n\n\"My opinion is that the portrait must be flattering, my lord.\"\n\n\"Of that,\" said the prince triumphantly, \"there can be no doubt; but let\nus suppose that it is not, what would your opinion be?\"\n\n\"My lord, that your highness is exceedingly happy to have so charming a\nbride.\"\n\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing. The prince understood how\nsevere towards himself this opinion of the Comte de Guiche was, and he\nlooked somewhat displeased, saying, \"My friends are not over indulgent.\"\nDe Guiche looked at the portrait again, and, after lengthened\ncontemplation, returned it with apparent unwillingness, saying, \"Most\ndecidedly, my lord, I should rather prefer to look ten times at your\nhighness, than to look at Madame once again.\" It seemed as if the\nchevalier had detected some mystery in these words, which were\nincomprehensible to the prince, for he exclaimed: \"Very well, get\nmarried yourself.\" Monsieur continued painting himself, and when he\nhad finished, looked at the portrait again once more, turned to admire\nhimself in the glass, and smiled, and no doubt was satisfied with the\ncomparison. \"You are very kind to have come,\" he said to Guiche, \"I\nfeared you would leave without bidding me adieu.\"\n\n\"Your highness knows me too well to believe me capable of so great a\ndisrespect.\"\n\n\"Besides, I suppose you have something to ask from me before leaving\nParis?\"\n\n\"Your highness has indeed guessed correctly, for I have a request to\nmake.\"\n\n\"Very good, what is it?\"\n\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine immediately displayed the greatest attention,\nfor he regarded every favor conferred upon another as a robbery\ncommitted against himself. And, as Guiche hesitated, the prince said:\n\"If it be money, nothing could be more fortunate, for I am in funds; the\nsuperintendent of the finances has sent me 500,000 pistoles.\"\n\n\"I thank your highness; but is not an affair of money.\"\n\n\"What is it, then? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The appointment of a maid of honor.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! Guiche, what a protector you have become of young ladies,\" said\nthe prince, \"you never speak of any one else now.\"\n\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine smiled, for he knew very well that nothing\ndispleased the prince more than to show any interest in ladies. \"My\nlord,\" said the comte, \"it is not I who am directly interested in the\nlady of whom I have just spoken; I am acting on behalf of one of my\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is different; what is the name of the young lady in whom your\nfriend is so interested?\"\n\n\"Mlle. de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere; she is already maid of honor\nto the dowager princess.\"\n\n\"Why, she is lame,\" said the Chevalier de Lorraine, stretching himself\non his cushions.\n\n\"Lame,\" repeated the prince, \"and Madame to have her constantly before\nher eyes? Most certainly not; it may be dangerous for her when in an\ninteresting condition.\"\n\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said Guiche, \"your conduct is ungenerous; while I am\nsoliciting a favor, you do me all the mischief you can.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, comte,\" said the Chevalier de Lorraine, somewhat uneasy at\nthe tone in which Guiche had made his remark, \"but I had no intention of\ndoing so, and I begin to believe that I have mistaken one young lady for\nanother.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it, monsieur; and I do not hesitate to declare\nthat such is the case.\"\n\n\"Do you attach much importance to it, Guiche?\" inquired the prince.\n\n\"I do, my lord.\"\n\n\"Well, you shall have it; but ask me for no more appointments, for there\nare none to give away.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the chevalier, \"midday already, that is the hour fixed\nfor the departure.\"\n\n\"You dismiss me, monsieur?\" inquired Guiche.\n\n\"Really, count, you treat me very ill to-day,\" replied the chevalier.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, count, for heaven's sake, chevalier,\" said Monsieur,\n\"do you not see how you are distressing me?\"\n\n\"Your highness's signature?\" said Guiche.\n\n\"Take a blank appointment from that drawer, and give it to me.\" Guiche\nhanded the prince the document indicated, and at the same time presented\nhim with a pen already dipped in ink; whereupon the prince signed.\n\"Here,\" he said, returning him the appointment, \"but I give it on one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"That you make friends with the chevalier.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Guiche. And he held out his hand to the chevalier with\nan indifference amounting to contempt.\n\n\"Adieu, count,\" said the chevalier, without seeming in any way to have\nnoticed the count's slight; \"adieu, and bring us back a princess who\nwill not talk with her own portrait too much.\"\n\n\"Yes, set off and lose no time. By the by, who will accompany you?\"\n\n\"Bragelonne and De Wardes.\"\n\n\"Both excellent and fearless companions.\"\n\n\"Too fearless,\" said the chevalier; \"endeavor to bring them both back,\ncount.\"\n\n\"A bad heart, bad!\" murmured De Guiche; \"he scents mischief everywhere,\nand sooner than anything else.\" And taking leave of the prince, he\nquitted the apartment. As soon as he reached the vestibule, he waved\nin the air the paper which the prince had signed. Malicorne hurried\nforward, and received it, trembling with delight. When, however, he held\nin his hand, Guiche observed that he still awaited something further.\n\n\"Patience, monsieur,\" he said; \"the Chevalier de Lorraine was there,\nand I feared an utter failure if I asked too much at once. Wait until I\nreturn. Adieu.\"\n\n\"Adieu, monsieur le comte; a thousand thanks,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Send Manicamp to me. By the way, monsieur, is it true that Mlle. de la\nValliere is lame?\" As he said this, he noticed that Bragelonne, who had\njust at that moment entered the courtyard, turned suddenly pale. The\npoor lover had heard the remark, which, however, was not the case with\nMalicorne, for he was already beyond the reach of the count's voice.\n\n\"Why is Louise's name spoken of here,\" said Raoul to himself; \"oh! let\nnot De Wardes, who stands smiling yonder, even say a word about her in\nmy presence.\"\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" exclaimed the Comte de Guiche, \"prepare to start.\"\n\nAt this moment the prince, who had complete his toilette, appeared at\nthe window, and was immediately saluted by the acclamations of all who\ncomposed the escort, and ten minutes afterwards, banners, scarfs,\nand feathers were fluttering and waving in the air, as the cavalcade\ngalloped away.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII. Le Havre.\n\nThis brilliant and animated company, the members of which were inspired\nby various feelings, arrived at Le Havre four days after their\ndeparture from Paris. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and no\nintelligence had yet been received of Madame. They were soon engaged in\nquest of apartments; but the greatest confusion immediately ensued among\nthe masters, and violent quarrels among their attendants. In the midst\nof this disorder, the Comte de Guiche fancied he recognized Manicamp. It\nwas, indeed, Manicamp himself; but as Malicorne had taken possession of\nhis very best costume, he had not been able to get any other than a suit\nof violet velvet, trimmed with silver. Guiche recognized him as much by\nhis dress as by his features, for he had very frequently seen Manicamp\nin his violet suit, which was his last resource. Manicamp presented\nhimself to the count under an arch of torches, which set in a blaze,\nrather than illuminated, the gate by which Le Havre is entered, and\nwhich is situated close to the tower of Francis I. The count, remarking\nthe woe-begone expression of Manicamp's face, could not resist laughing.\n\"Well, my poor Manicamp,\" he exclaimed, \"how violet you look; are you in\nmourning?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Manicamp; \"I am in mourning.\"\n\n\"For whom, or for what?\"\n\n\"For my blue-and-gold suit, which has disappeared, and in the place of\nwhich I could find nothing but this; and I was even obliged to economize\nfrom compulsion, in order to get possession of it.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is singular you should be astonished at that, since you leave me\nwithout any money.\"\n\n\"At all events, here you are, and that is the principal thing.\"\n\n\"By the most horrible roads.\"\n\n\"Where are you lodging?\"\n\n\"Lodging?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"I am not lodging anywhere.\"\n\nDe Guiche began to laugh. \"Well,\" said he, \"where do you intend to\nlodge?\"\n\n\"In the same place you do.\"\n\n\"But I don't know, myself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying you don't know?\"\n\n\"Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should stay?\"\n\n\"Have you not retained an hotel?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you or the prince.\"\n\n\"Neither of us has thought of it. Le Havre is of considerable size,\nI suppose; and provided I can get a stable for a dozen horses, and a\nsuitable house in a good quarter--\"\n\n\"Certainly, there are some very excellent houses.\"\n\n\"Well then--\"\n\n\"But not for us.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying not for us?--for whom, then?\"\n\n\"For the English, of course.\"\n\n\"For the English?\"\n\n\"Yes; the houses are all taken.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Guiche, whose attention this name had\nawakened.\n\n\"Yes, by the Duke of Buckingham. His Grace was preceded by a courier,\nwho arrived here three days ago, and immediately retained all the houses\nfit for habitation the town possesses.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Manicamp, let us understand each other.\"\n\n\"Well, what I have told you is clear enough, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"But surely Buckingham does not occupy the whole of Le Havre?\"\n\n\"He certainly does not occupy it, since he has not yet arrived; but,\nonce disembarked, he will occupy it.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"It is quite clear you are not acquainted with the English; they have a\nperfect rage for monopolizing everything.\"\n\n\"That may be; but a man who has the whole of one house, is satisfied\nwith it, and does not require two.\"\n\n\"Yes, but two men?\"\n\n\"Be it so; for two men, two houses, or four or six, or ten, if you like;\nbut there are a hundred houses at Le Havre.\"\n\n\"Yes, and all the hundred are let.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"What an obstinate fellow you are. I tell you Buckingham has hired all\nthe houses surrounding the one which the queen dowager of England and\nthe princess her daughter will inhabit.\"\n\n\"He is singular enough, indeed,\" said De Wardes, caressing his horse's\nneck.\n\n\"Such is the case, however, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure of it, Monsieur de Manicamp?\" and as he put this\nquestion, he looked slyly at De Guiche, as though to interrogate him\nupon the degree of confidence to be placed in his friend's state of\nmind. During this discussion the night had closed in, and the torches,\npages, attendants, squires, horses, and carriages, blocked up the gate\nand the open place; the torches were reflected in the channel, which the\nrising tide was gradually filling, while on the other side of the jetty\nmight be noticed groups of curious lookers-on, consisting of sailors and\ntownspeople, who seemed anxious to miss nothing of the spectacle. Amidst\nall this hesitation of purpose, Bragelonne, as though a perfect stranger\nto the scene, remained on his horse somewhat in the rear of Guiche, and\nwatched the rays of light reflected on the water, inhaling with rapture\nthe sea breezes, and listening to the waves which noisily broke upon the\nshore and on the beach, tossing the spray into the air with a noise\nthat echoed in the distance. \"But,\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"what is\nBuckingham's motive for providing such a supply of lodgings?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said De Wardes; \"what reason has he?\"\n\n\"A very excellent one,\" replied Manicamp.\n\n\"You know what it is, then?\"\n\n\"I fancy I do.\"\n\n\"Tell us, then.\"\n\n\"Bend your head down towards me.\"\n\n\"What! may it not be spoken except in private?\"\n\n\"You shall judge of that yourself.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" De Guiche bent down.\n\n\"Love,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"I do not understand you at all.\"\n\n\"Say rather, you cannot understand me yet.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Very well; it is quite certain, count, that his royal highness will be\nthe most unfortunate of husbands.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham--\"\n\n\"It is a name of ill omen to the princes of the house of France.\"\n\n\"And so the duke is madly in love with Madame, so the rumor runs, and\nwill have no one approach her but himself.\"\n\nDe Guiche colored. \"Thank you, thank you,\" said he to Manicamp, grasping\nhis hand. Then, recovering himself, added, \"Whatever you do, Manicamp,\nbe careful that this project of Buckingham's is not made known to any\nFrenchman here; for, if so, many a sword would be unsheathed in this\ncountry that does not fear English steel.\"\n\n\"But after all,\" said Manicamp, \"I have had no satisfactory proof given\nme of the love in question, and it may be no more than an idle tale.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said De Guiche, \"it must be the truth;\" and despite his\ncommand over himself, he clenched his teeth.\n\n\"Well,\" said Manicamp, \"after all, what does it matter to you? What\ndoes it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king\nwas? Buckingham the father for the queen, Buckingham the son for the\nprincess.\"\n\n\"Manicamp! Manicamp!\"\n\n\"It is a fact, or at least, everybody says so.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" cried the count.\n\n\"But why, silence?\" said De Wardes; \"it is a highly creditable\ncircumstance for the French nation. Are not you of my opinion, Monsieur\nde Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"To what circumstance do you allude?\" inquired De Bragelonne with an\nabstracted air.\n\n\"That the English should render homage to the beauty of our queens and\nour princesses.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, but I have not been paying attention to what has passed;\nwill you oblige me by explaining.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt it was necessary that Buckingham the father should\ncome to Paris in order that his majesty, King Louis XIII., should\nperceive that his wife was one of the most beautiful women of the French\ncourt; and it seems necessary, at the present time, that Buckingham the\nson should consecrate, by the devotion of his worship, the beauty of a\nprincess who has French blood in her veins. The fact of having inspired\na passion on the other side of the Channel will henceforth confer a\ntitle to beauty on this.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied De Bragelonne, \"I do not like to hear such matters\ntreated so lightly. Gentlemen like ourselves should be careful guardians\nof the honor of our queens and our princesses. If we jest at them, what\nwill our servants do?\"\n\n\"How am I to understand that?\" said De Wardes, whose ears tingled at the\nremark.\n\n\"In any way you chose, monsieur,\" replied De Bragelonne, coldly.\n\n\"Bragelonne, Bragelonne,\" murmured De Guiche.\n\n\"M. de Wardes,\" exclaimed Manicamp, noticing that the young man had\nspurred his horse close to the side of Raoul.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" said De Guiche, \"do not set such an example in\npublic, in the street too. De Wardes, you are wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong; in what way, may I ask you?\"\n\n\"You are wrong, monsieur, because you are always speaking ill of someone\nor something,\" replied Raoul, with undisturbed composure.\n\n\"Be indulgent, Raoul,\" said De Guiche, in an undertone.\n\n\"Pray do not think of fighting, gentlemen!\" said Manicamp, \"before you\nhave rested yourselves; for in that case you will not be able to do\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said De Guiche, \"forward, gentlemen!\" and breaking through the\nhorses and attendants, he cleared the way for himself towards the center\nof the square, through the crowd, followed by the whole cavalcade. A\nlarge gateway looking out upon a courtyard was open; Guiche entered the\ncourtyard, and Bragelonne, De Wardes, Manicamp, and three or four other\ngentlemen, followed him. A sort of council of war was held, and\nthe means to be employed for saving the dignity of the embassy were\ndeliberated upon. Bragelonne was of the opinion that the right of\npriority should be respected, while De Wardes suggested that the town\nshould be sacked. This latter proposition appearing to Manicamp rather\npremature, he proposed instead that they should first rest themselves.\nThis was the wisest thing to do, but, unhappily, to follow his advice,\ntwo things were wanting; namely, a house and beds. De Guiche reflected\nfor awhile, and then said aloud, \"Let him who loves me, follow me!\"\n\n\"The attendants also?\" inquired a page who had approached the group.\n\n\"Every one,\" exclaimed the impetuous young man. \"Manicamp, show us the\nway to the house destined for her royal highness's residence.\"\n\nWithout in any way divining the count's project, his friends followed\nhim, accompanied by a crowd of people, whose acclamations and delight\nseemed a happy omen for the success of that project with which they were\nyet unacquainted. The wind was blowing strongly from the harbor, and\nmoaning in fitful gusts.\n\n\n\nChapter IX. At Sea.\n\nThe following day was somewhat calmer, although the gale still\ncontinued. The sun had, however, risen through a bank of orange clouds,\ntingeing with its cheerful rays the crests of the black waves. Watch was\nimpatiently kept from the different look-outs. Towards eleven o'clock in\nthe morning a ship, with sails full set, was signalled as in view; two\nothers followed at the distance of about half a knot. They approached\nlike arrows shot from the bow of a skillful archer; and yet the sea ran\nso high that their speed was as nothing compared to the rolling of the\nbillows in which the vessels were plunging first in one direction and\nthen in another. The English fleet was soon recognized by the line of\nthe ships, and by the color of their pennants; the one which had the\nprincess on board and carried the admiral's flag preceded the others.\n\nThe rumor now spread that the princess was arriving. The whole French\ncourt ran to the harbor, while the quays and jetties were soon covered\nby crowds of people. Two hours afterwards, the other vessels had\novertaken the flagship, and the three, not venturing perhaps to enter\nthe narrow entrance of the harbor, cast anchor between Le Havre and La\nHeve. When the maneuver had been completed, the vessel which bore\nthe admiral saluted France by twelve discharges of cannon, which were\nreturned, discharge for discharge, from Fort Francis I. Immediately\nafterwards a hundred boats were launched; they were covered with the\nrichest stuffs, and destined for the conveyance of the different members\nof the French nobility towards the vessels at anchor. But when it was\nobserved that even inside the harbor the boats were tossed to and fro,\nand that beyond the jetty the waves rose mountains high, dashing upon\nthe shore with a terrible uproar, it was readily believed that not one\nof those frail boats would be able with safety to reach a fourth part of\nthe distance between the shore and the vessels at anchor. A pilot-boat,\nhowever, notwithstanding the wind and the sea, was getting ready to\nleave the harbor, for the purpose of placing itself at the admiral's\ndisposal.\n\nDe Guiche, who had been looking among the different boats for one\nstronger than the others, which might offer a chance of reaching the\nEnglish vessels, perceiving the pilot-boat getting ready to start, said\nto Raoul: \"Do you not think, Raoul, that intelligent and vigorous men,\nas we are, ought to be ashamed to retreat before the brute strength of\nwind and waves?\"\n\n\"That is precisely the very reflection I was silently making to myself,\"\nreplied Bragelonne.\n\n\"Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off? Will you come, De\nWardes?\"\n\n\"Take care, or you will get drowned,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"And for no purpose,\" said De Wardes, \"for with the wind in your teeth,\nas it will be, you will never reach the vessels.\"\n\n\"You refuse, then?\"\n\n\"Assuredly I do; I would willingly risk and lose my life in an encounter\nagainst men,\" he said, glancing at Bragelonne, \"but as to fighting with\noars against waves, I have no taste for that.\"\n\n\"And for myself,\" said Manicamp, \"even were I to succeed in reaching the\nships, I should not be indifferent to the loss of the only good dress\nwhich I have left,--salt water would spoil it.\"\n\n\"You, then, refuse also?\" exclaimed De Guiche.\n\n\"Decidedly I do; I beg you to understand that most distinctly.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"look, De Wardes--look, Manicamp--look\nyonder, the princesses are looking at us from the poop of the admiral's\nvessel.\"\n\n\"An additional reason, my dear fellow, why we should not make ourselves\nridiculous by being drowned while they are looking on.\"\n\n\"Is that your last word, Manicamp?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And then yours, De Wardes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I go alone.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Raoul, \"for I shall accompany you; I thought it was\nunderstood I should do so.\"\n\nThe fact is, that Raoul, uninfluenced by devotion, measuring the risk\nthey run, saw how imminent the danger was, but he willingly allowed\nhimself to accept a peril which De Wardes had declined.\n\nThe boat was about to set off when De Guiche called to the pilot.\n\"Stay,\" said he: \"we want two places in your boat;\" and wrapping five or\nsix pistoles in paper, he threw them from the quay into the boat.\n\n\"It seems you are not afraid of salt water, young gentlemen.\"\n\n\"We are afraid of nothing,\" replied De Guiche.\n\n\"Come along, then.\"\n\nThe pilot approached the side of the boat, and the two young men, one\nafter the other, with equal vivacity, jumped into the boat. \"Courage, my\nmen,\" said De Guiche; \"I have twenty pistoles left in this purse, and as\nsoon as we reach the admiral's vessel they shall be yours.\" The sailors\nbent themselves to their oars, and the boat bounded over the crest\nof the waves. The interest taken in this hazardous expedition was\nuniversal; the whole population of Le Havre hurried towards the jetties\nand every look was directed towards the little bark; at one moment it\nflew suspended on the crest of the foaming waves, then suddenly glided\ndownwards towards the bottom of a raging abyss, where it seemed utterly\nlost. At the expiration of an hour's struggling with the waves, it\nreached the spot where the admiral's vessel was anchored, and from the\nside of which two boats had already been dispatched towards their aid.\nUpon the quarter-deck of the flagship, sheltered by a canopy of velvet\nand ermine, which was suspended by stout supports, Henriette, the queen\ndowager, and the young princess--with the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk,\nstanding beside them--watched with alarm this slender bark, at one\nmoment tossed to the heavens, and the next buried beneath the waves, and\nagainst whose dark sail the noble figures of the two French gentlemen\nstood forth in relief like two luminous apparitions. The crew, leaning\nagainst the bulwarks and clinging to the shrouds, cheered the courage\nof the two daring young men, the skill of the pilot, and the strength of\nthe sailors. They were received at the side of the vessel by a shout of\ntriumph. The Duke of Norfolk, a handsome young man, from twenty-six\nto twenty-eight years of age, advanced to meet them. De Guiche and\nBragelonne lightly mounted the ladder on the starboard side, and,\nconducted by the Duke of Norfolk, who resumed his place near them, they\napproached to offer their homage to the princess. Respect, and yet more,\na certain apprehension, for which he could not account, had hitherto\nrestrained the Comte de Guiche from looking at Madame attentively, who,\nhowever, had observed him immediately, and had asked her mother, \"Is not\nthat Monsieur in the boat yonder?\" Madame Henriette, who knew Monsieur\nbetter than her daughter did, smiled at the mistake her vanity had led\nher into, and had answered, \"No; it is only M. de Guiche, his favorite.\"\nThe princess, at this reply, was constrained to check an instinctive\ntenderness of feeling which the courage displayed by the count had\nawakened. At the very moment the princess had put this question to\nher mother, De Guiche had, at last, summoned courage to raise his eyes\ntowards her and could compare the original with the portrait he had so\nlately seen. No sooner had he remarked her pale face, her eyes so full\nof animation, her beautiful nut-brown hair, her expressive lips, and her\nevery gesture, which, while betokening royal descent, seemed to thank\nand to encourage him at one and the same time, than he was, for a\nmoment, so overcome, that, had it not been for Raoul, on whose arm\nhe leant, he would have fallen. His friend's amazed look, and\nthe encouraging gesture of the queen, restored Guiche to his\nself-possession. In a few words he explained his mission, explained\nin what way he had become envoy of his royal highness; and saluted,\naccording to their rank and the reception they gave him, the admiral and\nseveral of the English noblemen who were grouped around the princess.\n\nRaoul was then presented, and was most graciously received; the share\nthat the Comte de la Fere had had in the restoration of Charles II. was\nknown to all; and, more than that, it was the comte who had been\ncharged with the negotiation of the marriage, by means of which the\ngranddaughter of Henry IV. was now returning to France. Raoul spoke\nEnglish perfectly, and constituted himself his friend's interpreter with\nthe young English noblemen, who were indifferently acquainted with the\nFrench language. At this moment, a young man came forward, of extremely\nhandsome features, and whose dress and arms were remarkable for their\nextravagance of material. He approached the princesses, who were engaged\nin conversation with the Duke of Norfolk, and, in a voice which ill\nconcealed his impatience, said, \"It is now time to disembark, your royal\nhighness.\" The younger of the princesses rose from her seat at this\nremark, and was about to take the hand which the young nobleman extended\nto her, with an eagerness which arose from a variety of motives, when\nthe admiral intervened between them, observing: \"A moment, if you\nplease, my lord; it is not possible for ladies to disembark just now,\nthe sea is too rough; it is probable the wind may abate before sunset,\nand the landing will not be effected, therefore, until this evening.\"\n\n\"Allow me to observe, my lord,\" said Buckingham, with an irritation of\nmanner which he did not seek to disguise, \"you detain these ladies,\nand you have no right to do so. One of them, unhappily, now belongs to\nFrance, and you perceive that France claims them by the voice of her\nambassadors;\" and at the same moment he indicated Raoul and Guiche, whom\nhe saluted.\n\n\"I cannot suppose that these gentlemen intend to expose the lives of\ntheir royal highnesses,\" replied the admiral.\n\n\"These gentlemen,\" retorted Buckingham, \"arrived here safely,\nnotwithstanding the wind; allow me to believe that the danger will not\nbe greater for their royal highnesses when the wind will be in their\nfavor.\"\n\n\"These envoys have shown how great their courage is,\" said the admiral.\n\"You may have observed that there was a great number of persons on shore\nwho did _not_ venture to accompany them. Moreover, the desire which they\nhad to show their respect with the least possible delay to Madame and\nher illustrious mother, induced them to brave the sea, which is very\ntempestuous to-day, even for sailors. These gentlemen, however, whom I\nrecommend as an example for my officers to follow, can hardly be so for\nthese ladies.\"\n\nMadame glanced at the Comte de Guiche, and perceived that his face was\nburning with confusion. This look had escaped Buckingham, who had eyes\nfor nothing but Norfolk, of whom he was evidently very jealous; he\nseemed anxious to remove the princesses from the deck of a vessel where\nthe admiral reigned supreme. \"In that case,\" returned Buckingham, \"I\nappeal to Madame herself.\"\n\n\"And I, my lord,\" retorted the admiral, \"I appeal to my own conscience,\nand to my own sense of responsibility. I have undertaken to convey\nMadame safe and sound to France, and I shall keep my promise.\"\n\n\"But, sir--\" continued Buckingham.\n\n\"My lord, permit me to remind you that I command here.\"\n\n\"Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?\" replied Buckingham,\nhaughtily.\n\n\"Perfectly so; I therefore repeat it: I alone command here, all yield\nobedience to me; the sea and the winds, the ships and men too.\" This\nremark was made in a dignified and authoritative manner. Raoul observed\nits effect upon Buckingham, who trembled with anger from head to foot,\nand leaned against one of the poles of the tent to prevent himself\nfalling; his eyes became suffused with blood, and the hand which he did\nnot need for his support wandered towards the hilt of his sword.\n\n\"My lord,\" said the queen, \"permit me to observe that I agree in every\nparticular with the Duke of Norfolk; if the heavens, instead of being\nclouded as they are at the present moment, were perfectly serene and\npropitious, we can still afford to bestow a few hours upon the officer\nwho has conducted us so successfully, and with such extreme attention,\nto the French coast, where he is to take leave of us.\"\n\nBuckingham, instead of replying, seemed to seek counsel from the\nexpression of Madame's face. She, however, half-concealed beneath the\nthick curtains of the velvet and gold which sheltered her, had not\nlistened to the discussion, having been occupied in watching the Comte\nde Guiche, who was conversing with Raoul. This was a fresh misfortune\nfor Buckingham, who fancied he perceived in Madame Henrietta's look a\ndeeper feeling than that of curiosity. He withdrew, almost tottering in\nhis gait, and nearly stumbled against the mainmast of the ship.\n\n\"The duke has not acquired a steady footing yet,\" said the queen-mother,\nin French, \"and that may possibly be his reason for wishing to find\nhimself on firm land again.\"\n\nThe young man overheard this remark, turned suddenly pale, and, letting\nhis hands fall in great discouragement by his side, drew aside, mingling\nin one sigh his old affection and his new hatreds. The admiral, however,\nwithout taking any further notice of the duke's ill-humor, led the\nprincesses into the quarter-deck cabin, where dinner had been served\nwith a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests. The admiral\nseated himself at the right hand of the princess, and placed the Comte\nde Guiche on her left. This was the place Buckingham usually occupied;\nand when he entered the cabin, how profound was his unhappiness to see\nhimself banished by etiquette from the presence of his sovereign, to a\nposition inferior to that which, by rank, he was entitled to. De Guiche,\non the other hand, paler still perhaps from happiness, than his rival\nwas from anger, seated himself tremblingly next to the princess, whose\nsilken robe, as it lightly touched him, caused a tremor of mingled\nregret and happiness to pass through his whole frame. The repast\nfinished, Buckingham darted forward to hand Madame Henrietta from the\ntable; but this time it was De Guiche's turn to give the duke a lesson.\n\"Have the goodness, my lord, from this moment,\" said he, \"not to\ninterpose between her royal highness and myself. From this moment,\nindeed, her royal highness belongs to France, and when she deigns to\nhonor me by touching my hand it is the hand of Monsieur, the brother of\nthe king of France, she touches.\"\n\nAnd saying this, he presented his hand to Madame Henrietta with such\nmarked deference, and at the same time with a nobleness of mien so\nintrepid, that a murmur of admiration rose from the English, whilst\na groan of despair escaped from Buckingham's lips. Raoul, who loved,\ncomprehended it all. He fixed upon his friend one of those profound\nlooks which a bosom friend or mother can alone extend, either as\nprotector or guardian, over the one who is about to stray from the right\npath. Towards two o'clock in the afternoon the sun shone forth anew, the\nwind subsided, the sea became smooth as a crystal mirror, and the fog,\nwhich had shrouded the coast, disappeared like a veil withdrawn before\nit. The smiling hills of France appeared in full view, with their\nnumerous white houses rendered more conspicuous by the bright green of\nthe trees or the clear blue sky.\n\n\n\nChapter X. The Tents.\n\nThe admiral, as we have seen, was determined to pay no further attention\nto Buckingham's threatening glances and fits of passion. In fact, from\nthe moment they quitted England, he had gradually accustomed himself to\nhis behavior. De Guiche had not yet in any way remarked the animosity\nwhich appeared to influence that young nobleman against him, but he\nfelt, instinctively, that there could be no sympathy between himself and\nthe favorite of Charles II. The queen-mother, with greater experience\nand calmer judgment, perceived the exact position of affairs, and, as\nshe discerned its danger, was prepared to meet it, whenever the proper\nmoment should arrive. Quiet had been everywhere restored, except in\nBuckingham's heart; he, in his impatience, addressed himself to the\nprincess, in a low tone of voice: \"For Heaven's sake, madame, I implore\nyou to hasten your disembarkation. Do you not perceive how that insolent\nDuke of Norfolk is killing me with his attentions and devotions to you?\"\n\nHenrietta heard this remark; she smiled, and without turning her head\ntowards him, but giving only to the tone of her voice that inflection of\ngentle reproach, and languid impertinence, which women and princesses so\nwell know how to assume, she murmured, \"I have already hinted, my lord,\nthat you must have taken leave of your senses.\"\n\nNot a single detail escaped Raoul's attention; he heard both\nBuckingham's entreaty and the princess's reply; he remarked Buckingham\nretire, heard his deep sigh, and saw him pass a hand over his face. He\nunderstood everything, and trembled as he reflected on the position\nof affairs, and the state of the minds of those about him. At last the\nadmiral, with studied delay, gave the last orders for the departure of\nthe boats. Buckingham heard the directions given with such an exhibition\nof delight that a stranger would really imagine the young man's reason\nwas affected. As the Duke of Norfolk gave his commands, a large boat or\nbarge, decked with flags, and capable of holding about twenty rowers and\nfifteen passengers, was slowly lowered from the side of the admiral's\nvessel. The barge was carpeted with velvet and decorated with coverings\nembroidered with the arms of England, and with garlands of flowers; for,\nat that time, ornamentation was by no means forgotten in these political\npageants. No sooner was this really royal boat afloat, and the rowers\nwith oars uplifted, awaiting, like soldiers presenting arms, the\nembarkation of the princess, than Buckingham ran forward to the ladder\nin order to take his place. His progress was, however, arrested by the\nqueen. \"My lord,\" she said, \"it is hardly becoming that you should allow\nmy daughter and myself to land without having previously ascertained\nthat our apartments are properly prepared. I beg your lordship to be\ngood enough to precede us ashore, and to give directions that everything\nbe in proper order on our arrival.\"\n\nThis was a fresh disappointment for the duke, and, still more so, since\nit was so unexpected. He hesitated, colored violently, but could not\nreply. He had thought he might be able to keep near Madame during the\npassage to the shore, and, by this means, to enjoy to the very last\nmoment the brief period fortune still reserved for him. The order,\nhowever, was explicit; and the admiral, who heard it given, immediately\ncalled out, \"Launch the ship's gig.\" His directions were executed with\nthat celerity which distinguishes every maneuver on board a man-of-war.\n\nBuckingham, in utter hopelessness, cast a look of despair at the\nprincess, of supplication towards the queen, and directed a glance full\nof anger towards the admiral. The princess pretended not to notice him,\nwhile the queen turned aside her head, and the admiral laughed outright,\nat the sound of which Buckingham seemed ready to spring upon him. The\nqueen-mother rose, and with a tone of authority said, \"Pray set off,\nsir.\"\n\nThe young duke hesitated, looked around him, and with a last effort,\nhalf-choked by contending emotions, said, \"And you, gentlemen, M. de\nGuiche and M. de Bragelonne, do not you accompany me?\"\n\nDe Guiche bowed and said, \"Both M. de Bragelonne and myself await her\nmajesty's orders; whatever the commands she imposes on us, we shall obey\nthem.\" Saying this, he looked towards the princess, who cast down her\neyes.\n\n\"Your grace will remember,\" said the queen, \"that M. de Guiche is here\nto represent Monsieur; it is he who will do the honors of France, as\nyou have done those of England; his presence cannot be dispensed with;\nbesides, we owe him this slight favor for the courage he displayed in\nventuring to seek us in such a terrible stress of weather.\"\n\nBuckingham opened his lips, as if he were about to speak, but, whether\nthoughts or expressions failed him, not a syllable escaped them, and\nturning away, as though out of his mind, he leapt from the vessel into\nthe boat. The sailors were just in time to catch hold of him to steady\nthemselves; for his weight and the rebound had almost upset the boat.\n\n\"His grace cannot be in his senses,\" said the admiral aloud to Raoul.\n\n\"I am uneasy on the Duke's account,\" replied Bragelonne.\n\nWhile the boat was advancing towards the shore, the duke kept his eyes\nimmovably fixed on the admiral's ship, like a miser torn away from his\ncoffers, or a mother separated from her child, about to be lead away\nto death. No one, however, acknowledged his signals, his frowns, or his\npitiful gestures. In very anguish of mind, he sank down in the boat,\nburying his hands in his hair, whilst the boat, impelled by the\nexertions of the merry sailors, flew over the waves. On his arrival he\nwas in such a state of apathy, that, had he not been received at the\nharbor by the messenger whom he had directed to precede him, he would\nhardly have had strength to ask his way. Having once, however, reached\nthe house which had been set apart for him, he shut himself up, like\nAchilles in his tent. The barge bearing the princess quitted the\nadmiral's vessel at the very moment Buckingham landed. It was followed\nby another boat filled with officers, courtiers, and zealous friends.\nGreat numbers of the inhabitants of Le Havre, having embarked in\nfishing-cobles and boats of every description, set off to meet the royal\nbarge. The cannon from the forts fired salutes, which were returned by\nthe flagship and the two other vessels, and the flashes from the\nopen mouths of the cannon floated in white fumes over the waves, and\ndisappeared in the clear blue sky.\n\nThe princess landed at the decorated quay. Bands of gay music greeted\nher arrival, and accompanied her every step she took. During the time\nshe was passing through the center of town, and treading beneath her\ndelicate feet the richest carpets and the gayest flowers, which had been\nstrewn upon the ground, De Guiche and Raoul, escaping from their English\nfriends, hurried through the town and hastened rapidly towards the place\nintended for the residence of Madame.\n\n\"Let us hurry forward,\" said Raoul to De Guiche, \"for if I read\nBuckingham's character aright, he will create some disturbance, when he\nlearns the result of our deliberations of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Never fear,\" said De Guiche, \"De Wardes is there, who is determination\nitself, while Manicamp is the very personification of the artless\ngentleness.\"\n\nDe Guiche was not, however, the less diligent on that account, and five\nminutes afterwards they were within sight of the Hotel de Ville. The\nfirst thing which struck them was the number of people assembled in\nthe square. \"Excellent,\" said De Guiche; \"our apartments, I see, are\nprepared.\"\n\nIn fact, in front of the Hotel de Ville, upon the wide open space before\nit, eight tents had been raised, surmounted by the flags of France and\nEngland united. The hotel was surrounded by tents, as by a girdle\nof variegated colors; ten pages and a dozen mounted troopers, for an\nescort, mounted guard before the tents. It had a singularly curious\neffect, almost fairy-like in its appearance. These tents had been\nconstructed during the night-time. Fitted up, within and without, with\nthe richest materials that De Guiche had been able to procure in Le\nHavre, they completely encircled the Hotel de Ville. The only passage\nwhich led to the steps of the hotel, and which was not inclosed by the\nsilken barricade, was guarded by two tents, resembling two pavilions,\nthe doorways of both of which opened towards the entrance. These two\ntents were destined for De Guiche and Raoul; in whose absence they were\nintended to be occupied, that of De Guiche by De Wardes, and that of\nRaoul by Manicamp. Surrounding these two tents, and the six others, a\nhundred officers, gentlemen, and pages, dazzling in their display of\nsilk and gold, thronged like bees buzzing about a hive. Every one of\nthem, their swords by their sides, was ready to obey the slightest sign\neither of De Guiche or Bragelonne, the leaders of the embassy.\n\nAt the very moment the two young men appeared at the end of one of the\nstreets leading to the square, they perceived, crossing the square at\nfull gallop, a young man on horseback, whose costume was of surprising\nrichness. He pushed hastily thorough the crowd of curious lookers-on,\nand, at the sight of these unexpected erections, uttered a cry of anger\nand dismay. It was Buckingham, who had awakened from his stupor, in\norder to adorn himself with a costume perfectly dazzling from its\nbeauty, and to await the arrival of the princess and the queen-mother\nat the Hotel de Ville. At the entrance to the tents, the soldiers\nbarred his passage, and his further progress was arrested. Buckingham,\nhopelessly infuriated, raised his whip; but his arm was seized by a\ncouple of officers. Of the two guardians of the tent, only one was\nthere. De Wardes was in the interior of the Hotel de Ville, engaging\nin attending to the execution of some orders by De Guiche. At the noise\nmade by Buckingham, Manicamp, who was indolently reclining upon the\ncushions at the doorway of one of the tents, rose with his usual\nindifference, and, perceiving that the disturbance continued, made his\nappearance from underneath the curtains. \"What is the matter?\" he said,\nin a gentle tone of voice, \"and who is making this disturbance?\"\n\nIt so happened, that, at the moment he began to speak, silence had just\nbeen restored, and, although his voice was very soft and gentle in its\ntouch, every one heard his question. Buckingham turned round, and looked\nat the tall thin figure, and the listless expression of countenance of\nhis questioner. Probably the personal appearance of Manicamp, who was\ndressed very plainly, did not inspire him with much respect, for he\nreplied disdainfully, \"Who may you be, monsieur?\"\n\nManicamp, leaning on the arm of a gigantic trooper, as firm as\nthe pillar of a cathedral, replied in his usual tranquil tone of\nvoice,--\"And _you_, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I, monsieur, am the Duke of Buckingham; I have hired all the houses\nwhich surround the Hotel de Ville, where I have business to transact;\nand as these houses are let, they belong to me, and, as I hired them in\norder to preserve the right of free access to the Hotel de Ville, you\nare not justified in preventing me passing to it.\"\n\n\"But who prevents you passing, monsieur?\" inquired Manicamp.\n\n\"Your sentinels.\"\n\n\"Because you wish to pass on horseback, and orders have been given to\nlet only persons on foot pass.\"\n\n\"No one has any right to give orders here, except myself,\" said\nBuckingham.\n\n\"On what grounds?\" inquired Manicamp, with his soft tone. \"Will you do\nme the favor to explain this enigma to me?\"\n\n\"Because, as I have already told you, I have hired all the houses\nlooking on the square.\"\n\n\"We are very well aware of that, since nothing but the square itself has\nbeen left for us.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, monsieur; the square belongs to me, as well as the\nhouses in it.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, monsieur, but you are mistaken there. In _our_ country,\nwe say, the highway belongs to the king, therefore this square is his\nmajesty's; and, consequently, as we are the king's ambassadors, the\nsquare belongs to us.\"\n\n\"I have already asked you who you are, monsieur,\" exclaimed Buckingham,\nexasperated at the coolness of his interlocutor.\n\n\"My name is Manicamp,\" replied the young man, in a voice whose tones\nwere as harmonious and sweet as the notes of an Aeolian harp.\n\nBuckingham shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and said, \"When I\nhired these houses which surround the Hotel de Ville, the square was\nunoccupied; these barracks obstruct my sight; I hereby order them to be\nremoved.\"\n\nA hoarse and angry murmur ran through the crowd of listeners at these\nwords. De Guiche arrived at this moment; he pushed through the crowd\nwhich separated him from Buckingham, and, followed by Raoul, arrived on\nthe scene of action from one side, just as De Wardes came up from the\nother. \"Pardon me, my lord; but if you have any complaint to make, have\nthe goodness to address it to me, inasmuch as it was I who supplied the\nplans for the construction of these tents.\"\n\n\"Moreover, I would beg you to observe, monsieur, that the term 'barrack'\nis a highly objectionable one!\" added Manicamp, graciously.\n\n\"You were saying, monsieur--\" continued De Guiche.\n\n\"I was saying, monsieur le comte,\" resumed Buckingham, in a tone of\nanger more marked than ever, although in some measure moderated by the\npresence of an equal, \"I was saying that it is impossible these tents\ncan remain where they are.\"\n\n\"_Impossible!_\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"and why?\"\n\n\"Because I object to them.\"\n\nA movement of impatience escaped De Guiche, but a warning glance from\nRaoul restrained him.\n\n\"You should the less object to them, monsieur, on account of the abuse\nof priority you have permitted yourself to exercise.\"\n\n\"_Abuse!_\"\n\n\"Most assuredly. You commission a messenger, who hires in your name the\nwhole of the town of Le Havre, without considering the members of the\nFrench court, who would be sure to arrive here to meet Madame.\nYour Grace will admit that this is hardly friendly conduct in the\nrepresentative of a friendly nation.\"\n\n\"The right of possession belongs to him who is first on the ground.\"\n\n\"Not in France, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why not in France?\"\n\n\"Because France is a country where politeness is observed.\"\n\n\"Which means?\" exclaimed Buckingham, in so violent a manner that those\nwho were present drew back, expecting an immediate collision.\n\n\"Which means, monsieur,\" replied De Guiche, now rather pale, \"that\nI caused these tents to be raised as habitations for myself and my\nfriends, as a shelter for the ambassadors of France, as the only place\nof refuge which your exactions have left us in the town; and that I\nand those who are with me, shall remain in them, at least, until an\nauthority more powerful, and more supreme, than your own shall dismiss\nme from them.\"\n\n\"In other words, until we are ejected, as the lawyers say,\" observed\nManicamp, blandly.\n\n\"I know an authority, monsieur, which I trust is such as you will\nrespect,\" said Buckingham, placing his hand on his sword.\n\nAt this moment, and as the goddess of Discord, inflaming all minds, was\nabout to direct their swords against each other, Raoul gently placed his\nhand on Buckingham's shoulder. \"One word, my lord,\" he said.\n\n\"My right, my right, first of all,\" exclaimed the fiery young man.\n\n\"It is precisely upon that point I wish to have the honor of addressing\na word to you.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur, but let your remarks be brief.\"\n\n\"One question is all I ask; you can hardly expect me to be briefer.\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur, I am listening.\"\n\n\"Are you, or is the Duke of Orleans, going to marry the granddaughter of\nHenry IV.?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Buckingham, retreating a few steps,\nbewildered.\n\n\"Have the goodness to answer me,\" persisted Raoul tranquilly.\n\n\"Do you mean to ridicule me, monsieur?\" inquired Buckingham.\n\n\"Your question is a sufficient answer for me. You admit, then, that it\nis not you who are going to marry the princess?\"\n\n\"You know it perfectly well, monsieur, I should imagine.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but your conduct has been such as to leave it not\naltogether certain.\"\n\n\"Proceed, monsieur, what do you mean to convey?\"\n\nRaoul approached the duke. \"Are you aware, my lord,\" he said, lowering\nhis voice, \"that your extravagances very much resemble the excesses\nof jealousy? These jealous fits, with respect to any woman, are not\nbecoming in one who is neither her lover nor her husband; and I am sure\nyou will admit that my remark applies with still greater force, when the\nlady in question is a princess of the blood royal!\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" exclaimed Buckingham, \"do you mean to insult Madame\nHenrietta?\"\n\n\"Be careful, my lord,\" replied Bragelonne, coldly, \"for it is you who\ninsult her. A little while since, when on board the admiral's ship,\nyou wearied the queen, and exhausted the admiral's patience. I\nwas observing, my lord; and, at first, I concluded you were not\nin possession of your senses, but I have since surmised the real\nsignificance of your madness.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\" exclaimed Buckingham.\n\n\"One moment more, for I have yet another word to add. I trust I am the\nonly one of my companions who has guessed it.\"\n\n\"Are you aware, monsieur,\" said Buckingham, trembling with mingled\nfeelings of anger and uneasiness, \"are you aware that you are holding\nlanguage towards me which requires to be checked?\"\n\n\"Weigh your words well, my lord,\" said Raoul, haughtily; \"my nature is\nnot such that its vivacities need checking; whilst you, on the contrary,\nare descended from a race whose passions are suspected by all true\nFrenchmen; I repeat, therefore, for the second time, be careful!\"\n\n\"Careful of what, may I ask? Do you presume to threaten me?\"\n\n\"I am the son of the Comte de la Fere, my lord, and I never threaten,\nbecause I strike first. Therefore, understand me well, the threat that I\nhold out to you is this--\"\n\nBuckingham clenched his hands, but Raoul continued, as though he had not\nobserved the gesture. \"At the very first word, beyond the respect and\ndeference due to her royal highness, which you permit yourself to use\ntowards her,--be patient my lord, for I am perfectly so.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. So long as Madame remained on English territory, I held\nmy peace; but from the very moment she stepped on French ground, and now\nthat we have received her in the name of the prince, I warn you, that\nat the first mark of disrespect which you, in your insane attachment,\nexhibit towards the royal house of France, I shall have one of two\ncourses to follow;--either I declare, in the presence of every one, the\nmadness with which you are now affected, and I get you ignominiously\nordered back to England; or if you prefer it, I will run my dagger\nthrough your throat in the presence of all here. This second alternative\nseems to me the least disagreeable, and I think I shall hold to it.\"\n\nBuckingham had become paler than the lace collar around his neck. \"M.\nde Bragelonne,\" he said, \"is it, indeed, a gentleman who is speaking to\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes; only the gentleman is speaking to a madman. Get cured, my lord,\nand he will hold quite another language to you.\"\n\n\"But, M. de Bragelonne,\" murmured the duke, in a voice, half-choked, and\nputting his hand to his neck,--\"Do you not see I am choking?\"\n\n\"If your death were to take place at this moment, my lord,\" replied\nRaoul, with unruffled composure, \"I should, indeed, regard it as a\ngreat happiness, for this circumstance would prevent all kinds of evil\nremarks; not alone about yourself, but also about those illustrious\npersons whom your devotion is compromising in so absurd a manner.\"\n\n\"You are right, you are right,\" said the young man, almost beside\nhimself. \"Yes, yes; better to die, than to suffer as I do at this\nmoment.\" And he grasped a beautiful dagger, the handle of which was\ninlaid with precious stones; and which he half drew from his breast.\n\nRaoul thrust his hand aside. \"Be careful what you do,\" he said; \"if you\ndo not kill yourself, you commit a ridiculous action; and if you were to\nkill yourself, you sprinkle blood upon the nuptial robe of the princess\nof England.\"\n\nBuckingham remained a minute gasping for breath; during this interval,\nhis lips quivered, his fingers worked convulsively, and his eyes\nwandered, as though in delirium. Then suddenly, he said, \"M. de\nBragelonne, I know nowhere a nobler mind than yours; you are, indeed,\na worthy son of the most perfect gentleman that ever lived. Keep your\ntents.\" And he threw his arms round Raoul's neck. All who were present,\nastounded at this conduct, which was the very reverse of what was\nexpected, considering the violence of the one adversary and the\ndetermination of the other, began immediately to clap their hands, and\na thousand cheers and joyful shouts arose from all sides. De Guiche, in\nhis turn, embraced Buckingham somewhat against his inclination; but,\nat all events, he did embrace him. This was the signal for French and\nEnglish to do the same; and they who, until that moment, had looked at\neach other with restless uncertainty, fraternized on the spot. In the\nmeantime, the procession of the princess arrived, and had it not been\nfor Bragelonne, two armies would have been engaged together in conflict,\nand blood would have been shed upon the flowers with which the ground\nwas covered. At the appearance, however, of the banners borne at the\nhead of the procession, complete order was restored.\n\n\n\nChapter XI. Night.\n\nConcord returned to its place amidst the tents. English and French\nrivaled each other in their devotion and courteous attention to the\nillustrious travelers. The English forwarded to the French baskets\nof flowers, of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the\narrival of the young princess; the French in return invited the English\nto a supper, which was to be given the next day. Congratulations were\npoured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey. From the\nrespect paid her on all sides, she seemed like a queen; and from the\nadoration with which she was treated by two or three; she appeared\nan object of worship. The queen-mother gave the French the most\naffectionate reception. France was her native country, and she had\nsuffered too much unhappiness in England for England to have made her\nforget France. She taught her daughter, then, by her own affection\nfor it, that love for a country where they had both been hospitably\nreceived, and where a brilliant future opened before them. After the\npublic entry was over, and the spectators in the streets had partially\ndispersed, and the sound of the music and cheering of the crowd could be\nheard only in the distance; when the night had closed in, wrapping with\nits star-covered mantle the sea, the harbor, the town, and surrounding\ncountry, De Guiche, still excited by the great events of the day,\nreturned to his tent, and seated himself upon one of the stools with so\nprofound an expression of distress that Bragelonne kept his eyes fixed\nupon him, until he heard him sigh, and then he approached him. The count\nhad thrown himself back on his seat, leaning his shoulders against the\npartition of the tent, and remained thus, his face buried in his hands,\nwith heaving chest and restless limbs.\n\n\"You are suffering?\" asked Raoul.\n\n\"Cruelly.\"\n\n\"Bodily, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; bodily.\"\n\n\"This has indeed been a harassing day,\" continued the young man, his\neyes fixed upon his friend.\n\n\"Yes; a night's rest will probably restore me.\"\n\n\"Shall I leave you?\"\n\n\"No; I wish to talk to you.\"\n\n\"You shall not speak to me, Guiche, until you have first answered my\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Proceed then.\"\n\n\"You will be frank with me?\"\n\n\"I always am.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent?\"\n\n\"I suspect.\"\n\n\"Because he is in love with Madame, is it not?\"\n\n\"One could almost swear to it, to observe him.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; there is nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"It is you who are mistaken, Raoul; I have read his distress in his\neyes, in his every gesture and action the whole day.\"\n\n\"You are a poet, my dear count, and find subjects for your muse\neverywhere.\"\n\n\"I can perceive love clearly enough.\"\n\n\"Where it does not exist?\"\n\n\"Nay, where it does exist.\"\n\n\"Do you not think you are deceiving yourself, Guiche?\"\n\n\"I am convinced of what I say,\" said the count.\n\n\"Now, inform me, count,\" said Raoul, fixing a penetrating look upon him,\n\"what happened to render you so clear-sighted.\"\n\nGuiche hesitated for a moment, and then answered, \"Self-love, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Self-love is a pedantic word, Guiche.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that, generally, you are less out of spirits than seems to be\nthe case this evening.\"\n\n\"I am fatigued.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Guiche; we have been campaigners together; we have been\non horseback for eighteen hours at a time, and our horses dying from\nexhaustion, or hunger, have fallen beneath us, and yet we have\nlaughed at our mishaps. Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you\nto-night.\"\n\n\"It is annoyance, then.\"\n\n\"What annoyance?\"\n\n\"That of this evening.\"\n\n\"The mad conduct of the Duke of Buckingham, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Of course; is it not vexations for us, the representatives of our\nsovereign master, to witness the devotion of an Englishman to our future\nmistress, the second lady in point of rank in the kingdom?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended\nfrom Buckingham.\"\n\n\"No; still he is intrusive. Did he not, on his arrival here, almost\nsucceed in creating a disturbance between the English and ourselves;\nand, had it not been for you, for your admirable presence, for your\nsingular decision of character, swords would have been drawn in the very\nstreets of the town.\"\n\n\"You observe, however, that he has changed his tactics.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; but this is the very thing that amazes me so much. You\nspoke to him in a low tone of voice, what did you say to him? You think\nhe loves her; you admit that such a passion does not give way readily.\nHe does not love her, then!\" De Guiche pronounced the latter with so\nmarked an expression that Raoul raised his head. The noble character of\nthe young man's countenance expressed a displeasure which could easily\nbe read.\n\n\"What I said to him, count,\" replied Raoul, \"I will repeat to you.\nListen to me. I said, 'You are regarding with wistful feelings, and most\ninjurious desire, the sister of your prince,--her to whom you are\nnot affianced, who is not, who can never be anything to you; you are\noutraging those who, like ourselves, have come to seek a young lady to\nescort her to her husband.'\"\n\n\"You spoke to him in that manner?\" asked Guiche, coloring.\n\n\"In those very terms; I even added more. 'How would you regard us,'\nI said, 'if you were to perceive among us a man mad enough, disloyal\nenough, to entertain other than sentiments of the most perfect respect\nfor a princess who is the destined wife of our master?'\"\n\nThese words were so applicable to De Guiche that he turned pale, and,\novercome by a sudden agitation, was barely able to stretch out one hand\nmechanically towards Raoul, as he covered his eyes and face with the\nother.\n\n\"But,\" continued Raoul, not interrupted by this movement of his friend,\n\"Heaven be praised, the French, who are pronounced to be thoughtless\nand indiscreet, reckless, even, are capable of bringing a calm and sound\njudgment to bear on matters of such high importance. I added even\nmore, for I said, 'Learn, my lord, that we gentlemen of France devote\nourselves to our sovereigns by sacrificing them our affections, as well\nas our fortunes and our lives; and whenever it may chance to happen that\nthe tempter suggests one of those vile thoughts that set the heart on\nfire, we extinguish the flame, even if it has to be done by shedding our\nblood for the purpose. Thus it is that the honor of three is saved:\nour country's, our master's, and our own. It is thus that we act, your\nGrace; it is thus that every man of honor ought to act.' In this\nmanner, my dear Guiche,\" continued Bragelonne, \"I addressed the Duke\nof Buckingham; and he admitted I was right, and resigned himself\nunresistingly to my arguments.\"\n\nDe Guiche, who had hitherto sat leaning forward while Raoul was\nspeaking, drew himself up, his eyes glancing proudly; he seized Raoul's\nhand, his face, which had been as cold as ice, seemed on fire. \"And you\nspoke magnificently,\" he said, in a half-choked voice; \"you are indeed a\nfriend, Raoul. But now, I entreat you, leave me to myself.\"\n\n\"Do you wish it?\"\n\n\"Yes; I need repose. Many things have agitated me to-day, both in mind\nand body; when you return to-morrow I shall no longer be the same man.\"\n\n\"I leave you, then,\" said Raoul, as he withdrew. The count advanced a\nstep towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms. But in this\nfriendly pressure Raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great\ninternal conflict.\n\nThe night was clear, starlit, and splendid; the tempest had passed away,\nand the sweet influences of the evening had restored life, peace and\nsecurity everywhere. A few fleecy clouds were floating in the heavens,\nand indicated from their appearance a continuance of beautiful weather,\ntempered by a gentle breeze from the east. Upon the large square in\nfront of the hotel, the shadows of the tents, intersected by the golden\nmoonbeams, formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones.\nSoon, however, the entire town was wrapped in slumber; a feeble light\nstill glimmered in Madame's apartment, which looked out upon the square,\nand the soft rays from the expiring lamp seemed to be the image of the\ncalm sleep of a young girl, hardly yet sensible of life's anxieties, and\nin whom the flame of existence sinks placidly as sleep steals over the\nbody.\n\nBragelonne quitted the tent with the slow and measured step of a man\ncurious to observe, but anxious not to be seen. Sheltered behind the\nthick curtains of his own tent, embracing with a glance the whole\nsquare, he noticed that, after a few moments' pause, the curtains of De\nGuiche's tent were agitated, and then drawn partially aside. Behind them\nhe could perceive the shadow of De Guiche, his eyes, glittering in the\nobscurity, fastened ardently upon the princess's sitting apartment,\nwhich was partially lighted by the lamp in the inner room. The soft\nlight which illumined the windows was the count's star. The fervent\naspirations of his nature could be read in his eyes. Raoul, concealed\nin the shadow, divined the many passionate thoughts that established,\nbetween the tent of the young ambassador and the balcony of the\nprincess, a mysterious and magical bond of sympathy--a bond created by\nthoughts imprinted with so much strength and persistence of will,\nthat they must have caused happy and loving dreams to alight upon the\nperfumed couch, which the count, with the eyes of his soul, devoured so\neagerly.\n\nBut De Guiche and Raoul were not the only watchers. The window of one\nof the houses looking on the square was opened too, the casement of the\nhouse where Buckingham resided. By the aid of the rays of light which\nissued from this latter, the profile of the duke could be distinctly\nseen, as he indolently reclined upon the carved balcony with its velvet\nhangings; he also was breathing in the direction of the princess's\napartment his prayers and the wild visions of his love.\n\nRaoul could not resist smiling, as thinking of Madame, he said to\nhimself, \"Hers is, indeed, a heart well besieged;\" and then added,\ncompassionately, as he thought of Monsieur, \"and he is a husband well\nthreatened too; it is a good thing for him that he is a prince of such\nhigh rank, that he has an army to safeguard for him that which is his\nown.\" Bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers,\nlistened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of Manicamp, who snored as\nimperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold, instead of his\nviolet suit.\n\nThen he turned towards the night breeze which bore towards him, he\nseemed to think, the distant song of the nightingale; and, after having\nlaid in a due provision of melancholy, another nocturnal malady, he\nretired to rest thinking, with regard to his own love affair, that\nperhaps four or even a larger number of eyes, quite as ardent as those\nof De Guiche and Buckingham, were coveting his own idol in the\nchateau at Blois. \"And Mademoiselle de Montalais is by no means a very\nconscientious garrison,\" said he to himself, sighing aloud.\n\n\n\nChapter XII. From Le Havre to Paris.\n\nThe next day the _fetes_ took place, accompanied by all the pomp and\nanimation that the resources of the town and the cheerful disposition of\nmen's minds could supply. During the last few hours spent in Le Havre,\nevery preparation for the departure had been made. After Madame had\ntaken leave of the English fleet, and, once again, had saluted the\ncountry in saluting its flags, she entered her carriage, surrounded by a\nbrilliant escort. De Guiche had hoped that the Duke of Buckingham\nwould accompany the admiral to England; but Buckingham succeeded in\ndemonstrating to the queen that there would be great impropriety in\nallowing Madame to proceed to Paris, almost unprotected. As soon as it\nhad been settled that Buckingham was to accompany Madame, the young\nduke selected a corps of gentlemen and officers to form part of his own\nsuite, so that it was almost an army that now set out towards Paris,\nscattering gold, and exciting the liveliest demonstrations as they\npassed through the different towns and villages on the route. The\nweather was very fine. France is a beautiful country, especially along\nthe route by which the procession passed. Spring cast its flowers and\nits perfumed foliage on their path. Normandy, with its vast variety of\nvegetation, its blue skies and silver rivers, displayed itself in all\nthe loveliness of a paradise to the new sister of the king. _Fetes_ and\nbrilliant displays received them everywhere along the line of march.\nDe Guiche and Buckingham forgot everything; De Guiche in his anxiety to\nprevent any fresh attempts on the part of the duke, and Buckingham, in\nhis desire to awaken in the heart of the princess a softer remembrance\nof the country to which the recollection of many happy days belonged.\nBut, alas! the poor duke could perceive that the image of that country\nso cherished by himself became, from day to day, more and more effaced\nin Madame's mind, in exact proportion as her affection for France became\nmore deeply engraved on her heart. In fact, it was not difficult to\nperceive that his most devoted attention awakened no acknowledgement,\nand that the grace with which he rode one of his most fiery horses was\nthrown away, for it was only casually and by the merest accident that\nthe princess's eyes were turned towards him. In vain did he try,\nin order to fix upon himself one of those looks, which were thrown\ncarelessly around, or bestowed elsewhere, to produce in the animal he\nrode its greatest display of strength, speed, temper and address; in\nvain did he, by exciting his horse almost to madness, spur him, at the\nrisk of dashing himself in pieces against the trees, or of rolling in\nthe ditches, over the gates and barriers which they passed, or down the\nsteep declivities of the hills. Madame, whose attention had been aroused\nby the noise, turned her head for a moment to observe the cause of it,\nand then, slightly smiling, again entered into conversation with her\nfaithful guardians, Raoul and De Guiche, who were quietly riding at her\ncarriage doors. Buckingham felt himself a prey to all the tortures of\njealousy; an unknown, unheard of anguish glided through his veins, and\nlaid siege to his heart; and then, as if to show that he knew the\nfolly of his conduct, and that he wished to correct, by the humblest\nsubmission, his flights of absurdity, he mastered his horse, and\ncompelled him, reeking with sweat and flecked with foam, to champ\nhis bit close beside the carriage, amidst the crowd of courtiers.\nOccasionally he obtained a word from Madame as a recompense, and yet her\nspeech seemed almost a reproach.\n\n\"That is well, my lord,\" she said, \"now you are reasonable.\"\n\nOr from Raoul, \"Your Grace is killing your horse.\"\n\nBuckingham listened patiently to Raoul's remarks, for he instinctively\nfelt, without having had any proof that such was the case, that Raoul\nchecked the display of De Guiche's feelings, and that, had it not\nbeen for Raoul, some mad act or proceeding, either of the count, or\nof Buckingham himself, would have brought about an open rupture, or a\ndisturbance--perhaps even exile itself. From the moment of that excited\nconversation the two young men had held in front of the tents at Le\nHavre, when Raoul made the duke perceive the impropriety of his conduct,\nBuckingham felt himself attracted towards Raoul almost in spite of\nhimself. He often entered into conversation with him, and it was nearly\nalways to talk to him either of his father or of D'Artagnan, their\nmutual friend, in whose praise Buckingham was nearly as enthusiastic as\nRaoul. Raoul endeavored, as much as possible, to make the conversation\nturn upon this subject in De Wardes's presence, who had, during the\nwhole journey, been exceedingly annoyed at the superior position taken\nby Bragelonne, and especially by his influence over De Guiche. De Wardes\nhad that keen and merciless penetration most evil natures possess; he\nhad immediately remarked De Guiche's melancholy, and divined the nature\nof his regard for the princess. Instead, however, of treating the\nsubject with the same reserve which Raoul practiced; instead of\nregarding with that respect, which was their due, the obligations\nand duties of society, De Wardes resolutely attacked in the count the\never-sounding chord of juvenile audacity and pride. It happened one\nevening, during a halt at Mantes, that while De Guiche and De Wardes\nwere leaning against a barrier, engaged in conversation, Buckingham and\nRaoul were also talking together as they walked up and down. Manicamp\nwas engaged in devoted attendance on the princess, who already treated\nhim without reserve, on account of his versatile fancy, his frank\ncourtesy of manner, and conciliatory disposition.\n\n\"Confess,\" said De Wardes, \"that you are really ill, and that your\npedagogue of a friend has not succeeded in curing you.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" said the count.\n\n\"And yet it is easy enough; you are dying of love.\"\n\n\"You are mad, De Wardes.\"\n\n\"Madness it would be, I admit, if Madame were really indifferent to your\nmartyrdom; but she takes so much notice of it, observes it to such an\nextent, that she compromises herself, and I tremble lest, on our arrival\nat Paris, M. de Bragelonne may not denounce both of you.\"\n\n\"For shame, De Wardes, again attacking De Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Come, come, a truce to child's play,\" replied the count's evil genius,\nin an undertone; \"you know as well as I do what I mean. Besides, you\nmust have observed how the princess's glance softens as she looks at\nyou;--you can tell, by the very inflection of her voice, what pleasure\nshe takes in listening to you, and can feel how thoroughly she\nappreciates the verses you recite to her. You cannot deny, too, that\nevery morning she tells you how indifferently she slept the previous\nnight.\"\n\n\"True, De Wardes, quite true; but what good is there in your telling me\nall that?\"\n\n\"Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?\"\n\n\"No, no; not when I am a witness of things that are enough to drive one\nmad.\"\n\n\"Stay, stay,\" said De Wardes; \"look, she calls you,--do you understand?\nProfit by the occasion, while your pedagogue is absent.\"\n\nDe Guiche could not resist; an invincible attraction drew him towards\nthe princess. De Wardes smiled as he saw him withdraw.\n\n\"You are mistaken, monsieur,\" said Raoul, suddenly stepping across\nthe barrier against which the previous moment the two friends had been\nleaning. \"The pedagogue is here, and has overheard you.\"\n\nDe Wardes, at the sound of Raoul's voice, which he recognized without\nhaving occasion to look at him, half drew his sword.\n\n\"Put up your sword,\" said Raoul; \"you know perfectly well that, until\nour journey is at an end, every demonstration of that nature is useless.\nWhy do you distill into the heart of the man you term your friend all\nthe bitterness that infects your own? As regards myself, you wish to\narouse a feeling of deep dislike against a man of honor--my father's\nfriend and my own; and as for the count you wish him to love one who\nis destined for your master. Really, monsieur, I should regard you as\na coward, and a traitor too, if I did not, with greater justice, regard\nyou as a madman.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" exclaimed De Wardes, exasperated, \"I was deceived, I find,\nin terming you a pedagogue. The tone you assume, and the style which\nis peculiarly your own, is that of a Jesuit, and not of a gentleman.\nDiscontinue, I beg, whenever I am present, this style I complain of, and\nthe tone also. I hate M. d'Artagnan, because he was guilty of a cowardly\nact towards my father.\"\n\n\"You lie, monsieur,\" said Raoul, coolly.\n\n\"You give me the lie, monsieur?\" exclaimed De Wardes.\n\n\"Why not, if what you assert is untrue?\"\n\n\"You give me the lie, and will not draw your sword?\"\n\n\"I have resolved, monsieur, not to kill you until Madame shall have been\ndelivered safely into her husband's hands.\"\n\n\"Kill me! Believe me, monsieur, your schoolmaster's rod does not kill so\neasily.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Raoul, sternly, \"but M. d'Artagnan's sword kills; and, not\nonly do I possess his sword, but he has himself taught me how to use it;\nand with that sword, when a befitting time arrives, I will avenge his\nname--a name you have dishonored.\"\n\n\"Take care, monsieur,\" exclaimed De Wardes; \"if you do not immediately\ngive me satisfaction, I will avail myself of every means to revenge\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Indeed, monsieur,\" said Buckingham, suddenly, appearing upon the\nscene of action, \"that is a threat which savors of assassination, and\ntherefore, ill becomes a gentleman.\"\n\n\"What did you say, my lord?\" said De Wardes, turning round towards him.\n\n\"I said, monsieur, that the words you have just spoken are displeasing\nto my English ears.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur, if what you say is true,\" exclaimed De Wardes,\nthoroughly incensed, \"I at least find in you one who will not escape me.\nUnderstand my words as you like.\"\n\n\"I take them in the manner they cannot but be understood,\" replied\nBuckingham, with that haughty tone which characterized him, and which,\neven in ordinary conversation, gave a tone of defiance to everything he\nsaid; \"M. de Bragelonne is my friend, you insult M. de Bragelonne, and\nyou shall give me satisfaction for that insult.\"\n\nDe Wardes cast a look upon De Bragelonne, who, faithful to the character\nhe had assumed, remained calm and unmoved, even after the duke's\ndefiance.\n\n\"It would seem that I did not insult M. de Bragelonne, since M. de\nBragelonne, who carries a sword by his side, does not consider himself\ninsulted.\"\n\n\"At all events you insult someone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I insulted M. d'Artagnan,\" resumed De Wardes, who had observed\nthat this was the only means of stinging Raoul, so as to awaken his\nanger.\n\n\"That, then,\" said Buckingham, \"is another matter.\"\n\n\"Precisely so,\" said De Wardes; \"it is the province of M. d'Artagnan's\nfriends to defend him.\"\n\n\"I am entirely of your opinion,\" replied the duke, who had regained all\nhis indifference of manner; \"if M. de Bragelonne were offended, I could\nnot reasonably be expected to espouse his quarrel, since he is himself\nhere; but when you say that it is a quarrel of M. d'Artagnan--\"\n\n\"You will of course leave me to deal with the matter,\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"Nay, on the contrary, for I draw my sword,\" said Buckingham,\nunsheathing it as he spoke; \"for if M. d'Artagnan injured your father,\nhe rendered, or at least did all that he could to render, a great\nservice to mine.\"\n\nDe Wardes was thunderstruck.\n\n\"M. d'Artagnan,\" continued Buckingham, \"is the bravest gentleman I know.\nI shall be delighted, as I owe him many personal obligations, to settle\nthem with you, by crossing my sword with yours.\" At the same moment\nBuckingham drew his sword from its scabbard, saluted Raoul, and put\nhimself on guard.\n\nDe Wardes advanced a step to meet him.\n\n\"Stay, gentlemen,\" said Raoul, advancing towards them, and placing his\nown drawn sword between the combatants, \"the affair is hardly worth the\ntrouble of blood being shed almost in the presence of the princess.\nM. de Wardes speaks ill of M. d'Artagnan, with whom he is not even\nacquainted.\"\n\n\"What, monsieur,\" said De Wardes, setting his teeth hard together, and\nresting the point of his sword on the toe of his boot, \"do you assert\nthat I do not know M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Certainly not; you do not know him,\" replied Raoul, coldly, \"and you\nare even not aware where he is to be found.\"\n\n\"Not know where he is?\"\n\n\"Such must be the case, since you fix your quarrel with him upon\nstrangers, instead of seeking M. d'Artagnan where he is to be found.\" De\nWardes turned pale. \"Well, monsieur,\" continued Raoul, \"I will tell you\nwhere M. d'Artagnan is: he is now in Paris; when on duty he is to be\nmet with at the Louvre,--when not on duty, in the Rue des Lombards.\nM. d'Artagnan can easily be discovered at either of those two places.\nHaving, therefore, as you assert, so many causes of complaint against\nhim, show your courage in seeking him out, and afford him an opportunity\nof giving you that satisfaction you seem to ask of every one but of\nhimself.\" De Wardes passed his hand across his forehead, which was\ncovered with perspiration. \"For shame, M. de Wardes! so quarrelsome\na disposition is hardly becoming after the publication of the edicts\nagainst duels. Pray think of that; the king will be incensed at our\ndisobedience, particularly at such a time,--and his majesty will be in\nthe right.\"\n\n\"Excuses,\" murmured De Wardes; \"mere pretexts.\"\n\n\"Really, M. De Wardes,\" resumed Raoul, \"such remarks are the idlest\nbluster. You know very well that the Duke of Buckingham is a man of\nundoubted courage, who has already fought ten duels, and will probably\nfight eleven. His name alone is significant enough. As far as I am\nconcerned, you are well aware that I can fight also. I fought at Lens,\nat Bleneau, at the Dunes in front of the artillery, a hundred paces in\nfront of the line, while you--I say this parenthetically--were a hundred\npaces behind it. True it is, that on that occasion there was far too\ngreat a concourse of persons present for your courage to be observed,\nand on that account perhaps you did not reveal it; while here, it would\nbe a display, and would excite remark--you wish that others should talk\nabout you, in what manner you do not care. Do not depend upon me, M. de\nWardes to assist you in your designs, for I shall certainly not afford\nyou that pleasure.\"\n\n\"Sensibly observed,\" said Buckingham, putting up his sword, \"and I ask\nyour forgiveness, M. de Bragelonne, for having allowed myself to yield\nto a first impulse.\"\n\nDe Wardes, however, on the contrary, perfectly furious, bounded forward\nand raised his sword, threateningly, against Raoul, who had scarcely\nenough time to put himself in a posture of defense.\n\n\"Take care, monsieur,\" said Bragelonne, tranquilly, \"or you will put out\none of my eyes.\"\n\n\"You will not fight, then?\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"Not at this moment; but this I promise to do; immediately on our\narrival at Paris I will conduct you to M. d'Artagnan, to whom you shall\ndetail all the causes of complaint you have against him. M d'Artagnan\nwill solicit the king's permission to measure swords with you. The\nking will yield his consent, and when you shall have received the\nsword-thrust in due course, you will consider, in a calmer frame\nof mind, the precepts of the Gospel, which enjoin forgetfulness of\ninjuries.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed De Wardes, furious at this imperturbable coolness, \"one\ncan clearly see you are half a bastard, M. de Bragelonne.\"\n\nRaoul became as pale as death; his eyes flashed lightning, causing De\nWardes involuntarily to fall back. Buckingham, also, who had perceived\ntheir expression, threw himself between the two adversaries, whom he\nhad expected to see precipitate themselves on each other. De Wardes had\nreserved this injury for the last; he clasped his sword firmly in his\nhand, and awaited the encounter. \"You are right, monsieur,\" said Raoul,\nmastering his emotion, \"I am only acquainted with my father's name; but\nI know too well that the Comte de la Fere is too upright and honorable\na man to allow me to fear for a single moment that there is, as you\ninsinuate, any stain upon my birth. My ignorance, therefore, of my\nmother's name is a misfortune for me, and not a reproach. You are\ndeficient in loyalty of conduct; you are wanting in courtesy, in\nreproaching me with misfortune. It matters little, however, the insult\nhas been given, and I consider myself insulted accordingly. It is quite\nunderstood, then, that after you shall have received satisfaction from\nM. d'Artagnan, you will settle your quarrel with me.\"\n\n\"I admire your prudence, monsieur,\" replied De Wardes with a bitter\nsmile; \"a little while ago you promised me a sword-thrust from M.\nd'Artagnan, and now, after I shall have received his, you offer me one\nfrom yourself.\"\n\n\"Do not disturb yourself,\" replied Raoul, with concentrated anger; \"in\nall affairs of that nature, M. d'Artagnan is exceedingly skillful, and\nI will beg him as a favor to treat you as he did your father; in other\nwords, to spare your life at least, so as to leave me the pleasure,\nafter your recovery, of killing you outright; for you have the heart of\na viper, M. de Wardes, and in very truth, too many precautions cannot be\ntaken against you.\"\n\n\"I shall take my precautions against you,\" said De Wardes, \"be assured\nof it.\"\n\n\"Allow me, monsieur,\" said Buckingham, \"to translate your remark by a\npiece of advice I am about to give M. de Bragelonne; M. de Bragelonne,\nwear a cuirass.\"\n\nDe Wardes clenched his hands. \"Ah!\" said he, \"you two gentlemen intend\nto wait until you have taken that precaution before you measure your\nswords against mine.\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur,\" said Raoul, \"since you positively will have it\nso, let us settle the affair now.\" And, drawing his sword, he advanced\ntowards De Wardes.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" said Buckingham.\n\n\"Be easy,\" said Raoul, \"it will not be very long.\"\n\nDe Wardes placed himself on his guard; their swords crossed. De Wardes\nflew upon Raoul with such impetuosity, that at the first clashing of the\nsteel blades Buckingham clearly saw that Raoul was only trifling with\nhis adversary. Buckingham stepped aside, and watched the combat. Raoul\nwas as calm as if he were handling a foil instead of a sword; having\nretreated a step, he parried three or four fierce thrusts which De\nWardes made at him, caught the sword of the latter with within his own,\nand sent it flying twenty paces the other side of the barrier. Then as\nDe Wardes stood disarmed and astounded at his defeat, Raoul sheathed\nhis sword, seized him by the collar and the waist band, and hurled his\nadversary to the other end of the barrier, trembling, and mad with rage.\n\n\"We shall meet again,\" murmured De Wardes, rising from the ground and\npicking up his sword.\n\n\"I have done nothing for the last hour,\" said Raoul, rising from the\nground, \"but say the same thing.\" Then, turning towards the duke, he\nsaid, \"I entreat you to be silent about this affair; I am ashamed\nto have gone so far, but my anger carried me away, and I ask your\nforgiveness for it;--forget it, too.\"\n\n\"Dear viscount,\" said the duke, pressing with his own the vigorous and\nvaliant hand of his companion, \"allow me, on the contrary, to remember\nit, and to look after your safety; that man is dangerous,--he will kill\nyou.\"\n\n\"My father,\" replied Raoul, \"lived for twenty years under the menace of\na much more formidable enemy, and he still lives.\"\n\n\"Your father had good friends, viscount.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Raoul, \"such friends, indeed, that none are now left like\nthem.\"\n\n\"Do not say that, I beg, at the very moment I offer you my friendship;\"\nand Buckingham opened his arms to embrace Raoul, who delightedly\nreceived the proffered alliance. \"In my family,\" added Buckingham, \"you\nare aware, M. de Bragelonne, we die to save our friends.\"\n\n\"I know it well, duke,\" replied Raoul.\n\n\n\nChapter XIII. An Account of what the Chevalier de Lorraine Thought of\nMadame.\n\nNothing further interrupted the journey. Under a pretext that was little\nremarked, M. de Wardes went forward in advance of the others. He took\nManicamp with him, for his equable and dreamy disposition acted as a\ncounterpoise to his own. It is a subject of remark, that quarrelsome\nand restless characters invariably seek the companionship of gentle,\ntimorous dispositions, as if the former sought, in the contrast, a\nrepose for their own ill-humor, and the latter a protection for their\nweakness. Buckingham and Bragelonne, admitting De Guiche into their\nfriendship, in concert with him, sang the praises of the princess during\nthe whole of the journey. Bragelonne, had, however, insisted that their\nthree voices should be in concert, instead of singing in solo parts,\nas De Guiche and his rival seemed to have acquired a dangerous habit of\ndoing. This style of harmony pleased the queen-mother exceedingly,\nbut it was not perhaps so agreeable to the young princess, who was an\nincarnation of coquetry, and who, without any fear as far as her\nown voice was concerned, sought opportunities of so perilously\ndistinguishing herself. She possessed one of those fearless and\nincautious dispositions that find gratification in an excess of\nsensitiveness of feeling, and for whom, also, danger has a certain\nfascination. And so her glances, her smiles, her toilette, an\ninexhaustible armory of weapons of offense, were showered on the three\nyoung men with overwhelming force; and, from her well-stored arsenal\nissued glances, kindly recognitions, and a thousand other little\ncharming attentions which were intended to strike at long range the\ngentlemen who formed the escort, the townspeople, the officers of the\ndifferent cities she passed through, pages, populace, and servants;\nit was wholesale slaughter, a general devastation. By the time Madame\narrived at Paris, she had reduced to slavery about a hundred thousand\nlovers: and brought in her train to Paris half a dozen men who were\nalmost mad about her, and two who were, indeed, literally out of their\nminds. Raoul was the only person who divined the power of this woman's\nattraction, and as his heart was already engaged, he arrived in the\ncapital full of indifference and distrust. Occasionally during the\njourney he conversed with the queen of England respecting the power\nof fascination which Madame possessed, and the mother, whom so many\nmisfortunes and deceptions had taught experience, replied: \"Henrietta\nwas sure to be illustrious in one way or another, whether born in a\npalace or born in obscurity; for she is a woman of great imagination,\ncapricious and self-willed.\" De Wardes and Manicamp, in their\nself-assumed character of courtiers, had announced the princess's\narrival. The procession was met at Nanterre by a brilliant escort\nof cavaliers and carriages. It was Monsieur himself, followed by the\nChevalier de Lorraine and by his favorites, the latter being themselves\nfollowed by a portion of the king's military household, who had arrived\nto meet his affianced bride. At St. Germain, the princess and her mother\nhad changed their heavy traveling carriage, somewhat impaired by the\njourney, for a light, richly decorated chariot drawn by six horses with\nwhite and gold harness. Seated in this open carriage, as though upon\na throne, and beneath a parasol of embroidered silk, fringed with\nfeathers, sat the young and lovely princess, on whose beaming face were\nreflected the softened rose-tints which suited her delicate skin to\nperfection. Monsieur, on reaching the carriage, was struck by her\nbeauty; he showed his admiration in so marked a manner that the\nChevalier de Lorraine shrugged his shoulders as he listened to his\ncompliments, while Buckingham and De Guiche were almost heart-broken.\nAfter the usual courtesies had been rendered, and the ceremony\ncompleted, the procession slowly resumed the road to Paris. The\npresentations had been carelessly made, and Buckingham, with the rest of\nthe English gentlemen, had been introduced to Monsieur, from whom they\nhad received but very indifferent attention. But, during their progress,\nas he observed that the duke devoted himself with his accustomed\neagerness to the carriage-door, he asked the Chevalier de Lorraine, his\ninseparable companion, \"Who is that cavalier?\"\n\n\"He was presented to your highness a short while ago; it is the handsome\nDuke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"Madame's knight,\" added the favorite, with an inflection of the voice\nwhich envious minds can alone give to the simplest phrases.\n\n\"What do you say?\" replied the prince.\n\n\"I said 'Madame's knight'.\"\n\n\"Has she a recognized knight, then?\"\n\n\"One would think you can judge of that for yourself; look, only, how\nthey are laughing and flirting. All three of them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by _all three?_\"\n\n\"Do you not see that De Guiche is one of the party?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see. But what does that prove?\"\n\n\"That Madame has two admirers instead of one.\"\n\n\"You poison the simplest thing!\"\n\n\"I poison nothing. Ah! your royal highness's mind is perverted. The\nhonors of the kingdom of France are being paid to your wife and you are\nnot satisfied.\"\n\nThe Duke of Orleans dreaded the satirical humor of the Chevalier de\nLorraine whenever it reached a certain degree of bitterness, and he\nchanged the conversation abruptly. \"The princess is pretty,\" said he,\nvery negligently, as if he were speaking of a stranger.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the chevalier, in the same tone.\n\n\"You say 'yes' like a 'no'. She has very beautiful black eyes.\"\n\n\"Yes, but small.\"\n\n\"That is so, but they are brilliant. She is tall, and of a good figure.\"\n\n\"I fancy she stoops a little, my lord.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it. She has a noble appearance.\"\n\n\"Yes, but her face is thin.\"\n\n\"I thought her teeth beautiful.\"\n\n\"They can easily be seen, for her mouth is large enough. Decidedly, I\nwas wrong, my lord; you are certainly handsomer than your wife.\"\n\n\"But do you think me as handsome as Buckingham?\"\n\n\"Certainly, and he thinks so, too; for look, my lord, he is redoubling\nhis attentions to Madame to prevent your effacing the impression he has\nmade.\"\n\nMonsieur made a movement of impatience, but as he noticed a smile of\ntriumph pass across the chevalier's lips, he drew up his horse to a\nfoot-pace. \"Why,\" said he, \"should I occupy myself any longer about my\ncousin? Do I not already know her? Were we not brought up together? Did\nI not see her at the Louvre when she was quite a child?\"\n\n\"A great change has taken place in her since then, prince. At the period\nyou allude to, she was somewhat less brilliant, and scarcely so proud,\neither. One evening, particularly, you may remember, my lord, the\nking refused to dance with her, because he thought her plain and badly\ndressed!\"\n\nThese words made the Duke of Orleans frown. It was by no means\nflattering for him to marry a princess of whom, when young, the king had\nnot thought much. He would probably have retorted, but at this moment\nDe Guiche quitted the carriage to join the prince. He had remarked the\nprince and the chevalier together, and full of anxious attention he\nseemed to try and guess the nature of the remarks which they had just\nexchanged. The chevalier, whether he had some treacherous object in\nview, or from imprudence, did not take the trouble to dissimulate.\n\"Count,\" he said, \"you're a man of excellent taste.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the compliment,\" replied De Guiche; \"but why do you say\nthat?\"\n\n\"Well I appeal to his highness.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" said Monsieur; \"and Guiche knows perfectly well that I\nregard him as a most finished cavalier.\"\n\n\"Well, since that is decided, I resume. You have been in the princess's\nsociety, count, for the last eight days, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied De Guiche, coloring in spite of himself.\n\n\"Well then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal\nappearance?\"\n\n\"Of her personal appearance?\" returned De Guiche, stupefied.\n\n\"Yes; of her appearance, of her mind, of herself, in fact.\"\n\nAstounded by this question, De Guiche hesitated answering.\n\n\"Come, come, De Guiche,\" resumed the chevalier, laughingly, \"tell us\nyour opinion frankly; the prince commands it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the prince, \"be frank.\"\n\nDe Guiche stammered out a few unintelligible words.\n\n\"I am perfectly well aware,\" returned Monsieur, \"that the subject is a\ndelicate one, but you know you can tell me everything. What do you think\nof her?\"\n\nIn order to avoid betraying his real thoughts, De Guiche had recourse\nto the only defense which a man taken by surprise really has, and\naccordingly told an untruth. \"I do not find Madame,\" he said, \"either\ngood or bad looking, yet rather good than bad looking.\"\n\n\"What! count,\" exclaimed the chevalier, \"you who went into such\necstasies and uttered so many exclamations at the sight of her\nportrait.\"\n\nDe Guiche colored violently. Very fortunately, his horse, which\nwas slightly restive, enabled him by a sudden plunge to conceal his\nagitation. \"What portrait?\" he murmured, joining them again. The\nchevalier had not taken his eyes off him.\n\n\"Yes, the portrait. Was not the miniature a good likeness?\"\n\n\"I do not remember. I had forgotten the portrait; it quite escaped my\nrecollection.\"\n\n\"And yet it made a very marked impression upon you,\" said the chevalier.\n\n\"That is not unlikely.\"\n\n\"Is she witty, at all events?\" inquired the duke.\n\n\"I believe so, my lord.\"\n\n\"Is M. de Buckingham witty, too?\" said the chevalier.\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"My own opinion is that he must be,\" replied the chevalier, \"for he\nmakes Madame laugh, and she seems to take no little pleasure in his\nsociety, which never happens to a clever woman when in the company of a\nsimpleton.\"\n\n\"Of course, then, he must be clever,\" said De Guiche, simply.\n\nAt this moment Raoul opportunely arrived, seeing how De Guiche was\npressed by his dangerous questioner, to whom he addressed a remark, and\nin that way changed the conversation. The _entree_ was brilliant and\njoyous.\n\nThe king, in honor of his brother, had directed that the festivities\nshould be on a scale of the greatest possible magnificence. Madame and\nher mother alighted at the Louvre, where, during their exile they had\nso gloomily submitted to obscurity, misery, and privations of every\ndescription. That palace, which had been so inhospitable a residence\nfor the unhappy daughter of Henry IV., the naked walls, the uneven\nfloorings, the ceilings matted with cobwebs, the vast dilapidated\nchimney-places, the cold hearths on which the charity extended to them\nby parliament hardly permitted a fire to glow, was completely altered\nin appearance. The richest hangings and the thickest carpets, glistening\nflagstones, and pictures, with their richly gilded frames; in every\ndirection could be seen candelabra, mirrors, and furniture and fittings\nof the most sumptuous character; in every direction, also, were guards\nof the proudest military bearing, with floating plumes, crowds of\nattendants and courtiers in the ante-chambers and upon the staircases.\nIn the courtyards, where the grass had formerly been allowed to\nluxuriate, as if the ungrateful Mazarin had thought it a good idea to\nlet the Parisians perceive the solitude and disorder were, with misery\nand despair, the fit accompaniments of fallen monarchy; the immense\ncourtyards, formerly silent and desolate, were now thronged with\ncourtiers whose horses were pacing and prancing to and fro. The\ncarriages were filled with young and beautiful women, who awaited the\nopportunity of saluting, as she passed, the daughter of that daughter of\nFrance who, during her widowhood and exile, had sometimes gone without\nwood for her fire, and bread for her table, whom the meanest attendant\nat the chateau had treated with indifference and contempt. And so, the\nMadame Henriette once more returned to the Louvre, with her heart more\nswollen with bitter recollections than her daughter's, whose disposition\nwas fickle and forgetful, with triumph and delight. She knew but too\nwell this brilliant reception was paid to the happy mother of a king\nrestored to his throne, a throne second to none in Europe, while the\nworse than indifferent reception she had before met with was paid\nto her, the daughter of Henry IV., as a punishment for having been\nunfortunate. After the princess had been installed in their apartments\nand had rested, the gentlemen who had formed their escort, having, in\nlike manner, recovered from their fatigue, they resumed their accustomed\nhabits and occupations. Raoul began by setting off to see his father,\nwho had left for Blois. He then tried to see M. d'Artagnan, who,\nhowever, being engaged in the organization of a military household for\nthe king, could not be found anywhere. Bragelonne next sought out De\nGuiche, but the count was occupied in a long conference with his tailors\nand with Manicamp, which consumed his whole time. With the Duke of\nBuckingham he fared still worse, for the duke was purchasing horses\nafter horses, diamonds upon diamonds. He monopolized every embroiderer,\njeweler, and tailor that Paris could boast of. Between De Guiche and\nhimself a vigorous contest ensued, invariably a courteous one, in which,\nin order to insure success, the duke was ready to spend a million; while\nthe Marechal de Gramont had only allowed his son sixty thousand francs.\nSo Buckingham laughed and spent his money. Guiche groaned in despair,\nand would have shown it more violently, had it not been for the advice\nDe Bragelonne gave him.\n\n\"A million!\" repeated De Guiche daily; \"I must submit. Why will not the\nmarechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?\"\n\n\"Because you would throw it away,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"What can that matter to him? If I am to die of it, I shall die of it,\nand then I shall need nothing further.\"\n\n\"But what need is there to die?\" said Raoul.\n\n\"I do not wish to be conquered in elegance by an Englishman.\"\n\n\"My dear count,\" said Manicamp, \"elegance is not a costly commodity, it\nis only a very difficult accomplishment.\"\n\n\"Yes, but difficult things cost a good deal of money, and I have only\ngot sixty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"A very embarrassing state of things, truly,\" said De Wardes; \"even if\nyou spent as much as Buckingham, there is only nine hundred and forty\nthousand francs difference.\"\n\n\"Where am I to find them?\"\n\n\"Get into debt.\"\n\n\"I am in debt already.\"\n\n\"A greater reason for getting further.\"\n\nAdvice like this resulted in De Guiche becoming excited to such an\nextent that he committed extravagances where Buckingham only incurred\nexpenses. The rumor of this extravagant profuseness delighted the\nhearts of all the shopkeepers in Paris; from the hotel of the Duke of\nBuckingham to that of the Comte de Gramont nothing but miracles was\nattempted. While all this was going on, Madame was resting herself, and\nBragelonne was engaged in writing to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. He had\nalready dispatched four letters, and not an answer to any one of them\nhad been received, when, on the very morning fixed for the marriage\nceremony, which was to take place in the chapel at the Palais Royal,\nRaoul, who was dressing, heard his valet announce M. de Malicorne. \"What\ncan this Malicorne want with me?\" thought Raoul; and then said to his\nvalet, \"Let him wait.\"\n\n\"It is a gentleman from Blois,\" said the valet.\n\n\"Admit him at once,\" said Raoul, eagerly.\n\nMalicorne entered as brilliant as a star, and wearing a superb sword at\nhis side. After having saluted Raoul most gracefully, he said: \"M. de\nBragelonne, I am the bearer of a thousand compliments from a lady to\nyou.\"\n\nRaoul colored. \"From a lady,\" said he, \"from a lady of Blois?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; from Mademoiselle de Montalais.\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur; I recollect you now,\" said Raoul. \"And what does\nMademoiselle de Montalais require of me.\"\n\nMalicorne drew four letters from his pocket, which he offered to Raoul.\n\n\"My own letters, is it possible?\" he said, turning pale; \"my letters,\nand the seals unbroken?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, your letters did not find at Blois the person to whom they\nwere addressed, and so they are now returned to you.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere has left Blois, then?\" exclaimed Raoul.\n\n\"Eight days ago.\"\n\n\"Where is she, then?\"\n\n\"In Paris.\"\n\n\"How is it known that these letters were from me?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Montalais recognized your handwriting and your seal,\"\nsaid Malicorne.\n\nRaoul colored and smiled. \"Mademoiselle de Montalais is exceedingly\namiable,\" he said; \"she is always kind and charming.\"\n\n\"Always, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Surely she could have given me some precise information about\nMademoiselle de la Valliere. I never could find her in this immense\ncity.\"\n\nMalicorne drew another packet from his pocket. \"You may possibly find in\nthis letter what you are anxious to learn.\"\n\nRaoul hurriedly broke the seal. The writing was that of Mademoiselle\nAure, and inclosed were these words:--\"Paris, Palais Royal. The day of\nthe nuptial blessing.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" inquired Raoul of Malicorne; \"you probably know?\"\n\n\"I do, monsieur.\"\n\n\"For pity's sake, tell me, then.\"\n\n\"Impossible, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because Mademoiselle Aure has forbidden me to do so.\"\n\nRaoul looked at his strange visitor, and remained silent;--\"At least,\ntell me whether it is fortunate or unfortunate.\"\n\n\"That you will see.\"\n\n\"You are very severe in your reservations.\"\n\n\"Will you grant me one favor, monsieur?\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"In exchange for that you refuse me?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I have the greatest desire to see the ceremony, and I have no ticket\nto admit me, in spite of all the steps I have taken to secure one. Could\nyou get me admitted?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Do me this kindness, then, I entreat.\"\n\n\"Most willingly, monsieur; come with me.\"\n\n\"I am exceedingly indebted to you, monsieur,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"I thought you were a friend of M. de Manicamp.\"\n\n\"I am, monsieur; but this morning I was with him as he was dressing, and\nI let a bottle of blacking fall over his new dress, and he flew at me\nsword in hand, so that I was obliged to make my escape. That is the\nreason I could not ask him for a ticket. He wanted to kill me.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it,\" laughed Raoul. \"I know Manicamp is capable of\nkilling a man who has been unfortunate enough to commit the crime you\nhave to reproach yourself with, but I will repair the mischief as far as\nyou are concerned. I will but fasten my cloak, and shall then be ready\nto serve you, not only as a guide, but as your introducer, too.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIV. A Surprise for Raoul.\n\nMadame's marriage was celebrated in the chapel of the Palais Royal, in\nthe presence of a crowd of courtiers, who had been most scrupulously\nselected. However, notwithstanding the marked favor which an invitation\nindicated, Raoul, faithful to his promise to Malicorne, who was so\nanxious to witness the ceremony, obtained admission for him. After he\nhad fulfilled this engagement, Raoul approached De Guiche, who, as if\nin contrast with his magnificent costume, exhibited a countenance so\nutterly dejected, that the Duke of Buckingham was the only one present\nwho could contend with him as far as pallor and discomfiture were\nconcerned.\n\n\"Take care, count,\" said Raoul, approaching his friend, and preparing to\nsupport him at the moment the archbishop blessed the married couple. In\nfact, the Prince of Conde was attentively scrutinizing these two images\nof desolation, standing like caryatides on either side of the nave\nof the church. The count, after that, kept a more careful watch over\nhimself.\n\nAt the termination of the ceremony, the king and queen passed onward\ntowards the grand reception-room, where Madame and her suite were to be\npresented to them. It was remarked that the king, who had seemed more\nthan surprised at his sister-in-law's appearance, was most flattering\nin his compliments to her. Again, it was remarked that the queen-mother,\nfixing a long and thoughtful gaze upon Buckingham, leaned towards\nMadame de Motteville as though to ask her, \"Do you not see how much he\nresembles his father?\" and finally it was remarked that Monsieur watched\neverybody, and seemed quite discontented. After the reception of the\nprincess and ambassadors, Monsieur solicited the king's permission to\npresent to him as well as to Madame the persons belonging to their new\nhousehold.\n\n\"Are you aware, vicomte,\" inquired the Prince de Conde of Raoul,\n\"whether the household has been selected by a person of taste, and\nwhether there are any faces worth looking at?\"\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea, monseigneur,\" replied Raoul.\n\n\"You affect ignorance, surely.\"\n\n\"In what way, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"You are a friend of De Guiche, who is one of the friends of the\nprince.\"\n\n\"That may be so, monseigneur; but the matter having no interest whatever\nfor me, I have never questioned De Guiche on the subject; and De Guiche,\non his part, never having been questioned, did not communicate any\nparticulars to me.\"\n\n\"But Manicamp?\"\n\n\"It is true I saw Manicamp at Le Havre, and during the journey here, but\nI was no more inquisitive with him than I had been towards De Guiche.\nBesides, is it likely that Manicamp should know anything of such\nmatters? for he is a person of only secondary importance.\"\n\n\"My dear vicomte, do you not know better than that?\" said the prince;\n\"why, it is these persons of secondary importance, who, on such\noccasions, have all the influence; and the truth is, that nearly\neverything has been done through Manicamp's presentations to De Guiche,\nand through De Guiche to Monsieur.\"\n\n\"I assure you, monseigneur, I was ignorant of that,\" said Raoul, \"and\nwhat your highness does me the honor to impart is perfectly new to me.\"\n\n\"I will most readily believe you, although it seems incredible; besides\nwe shall not have long to wait. See, the flying squadron is advancing,\nas good Queen Catherine used to say. Ah! ah! what pretty faces!\"\n\nA bevy of young girls at this moment entered the _salon_, conducted by\nMadame de Navailles, and to Manicamp's credit be it said, if indeed\nhe had taken that part in their selection which the Prince de Conde\nassigned him, it was a display calculated to dazzle those who, like the\nprince, could appreciate every character and style of beauty. A young,\nfair-complexioned girl, from twenty to one-and-twenty years of age, and\nwhose large blue eyes flashed, as she opened them, in the most dazzling\nmanner, walked at the head of the band and was the first presented.\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,\" said Madame de Navailles to Monsieur,\nwho, as he saluted his wife, repeated \"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said the Prince de Conde to Raoul, \"she is presentable\nenough.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Raoul, \"but has she not a somewhat haughty style?\"\n\n\"Bah! we know these airs very well, vicomte; three months hence she will\nbe tame enough. But look, there, indeed, is a pretty face.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Raoul, \"and one I am acquainted with.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais,\" said Madame de Navailles. The name and\nChristian name were carefully repeated by Monsieur.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" exclaimed Raoul, fixing his bewildered gaze upon the\nentrance doorway.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired the prince; \"was it Mademoiselle Aure de\nMontalais who made you utter such a 'Great heavens'?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur, no,\" replied Raoul, pale and trembling.\n\n\"Well, then, if it be not Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, it is that\npretty _blonde_ who follows her. What beautiful eyes! She is rather\nthin, but has fascinations without number.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere!\" said Madame de\nNavailles; and, as this name resounded through his whole being, a cloud\nseemed to rise from his breast to his eyes, so that he neither saw nor\nheard anything more; and the prince, finding him nothing more than a\nmere echo which remained silent under his railleries, moved forward to\ninspect somewhat closer the beautiful girls whom his first glance had\nalready particularized.\n\n\"Louise here! Louise a maid of honor to Madame!\" murmured Raoul, and his\neyes, which did not suffice to satisfy his reason, wandered from Louise\nto Montalais. The latter had already emancipated herself from her\nassumed timidity, which she only needed for the presentation and for her\nreverences.\n\nMademoiselle de Montalais, from the corner of the room to which she had\nretired, was looking with no slight confidence at the different persons\npresent; and, having discovered Raoul, she amused herself with the\nprofound astonishment which her own and her friend's presence there\ncaused the unhappy lover. Her waggish and malicious look, which Raoul\ntried to avoid meeting, and which yet he sought inquiringly from time\nto time, placed him on the rack. As for Louise, whether from natural\ntimidity, or some other reason for which Raoul could not account, she\nkept her eyes constantly cast down; intimidated, dazzled, and with\nimpeded respiration, she withdrew herself as much as possible aside,\nunaffected even by the nudges Montalais gave her with her elbow. The\nwhole scene was a perfect enigma for Raoul, the key to which he would\nhave given anything to obtain. But no one was there who could assist\nhim, not even Malicorne; who, a little uneasy at finding himself in the\npresence of so many persons of good birth, and not a little discouraged\nby Montalais's bantering glances, had described a circle, and by degrees\nsucceeded in getting a few paces from the prince, behind the group of\nmaids of honor, and nearly within reach of Mademoiselle Aure's voice,\nshe being the planet around which he, as her attendant satellite, seemed\nconstrained to gravitate. As he recovered his self-possession, Raoul\nfancied he recognized voices on his right hand side that were familiar\nto him, and he perceived De Wardes, De Guiche, and the Chevalier de\nLorraine conversing together. It is true they were talking in tones so\nlow, that the sound of their words could hardly be heard in the vast\napartment. To speak in that manner from any particular place without\nbending down, or turning round, or looking at the person with whom one\nmay be engaged in conversation, is a talent that cannot be immediately\nacquired by newcomers. Long study is needed for such conversations,\nwhich, without a look, gesture, or movement of the head, seem like the\nconversation of a group of statues. In fact, the king's and queen's\ngrand assemblies, while their majesties were speaking, and while every\none present seemed to be listening in the midst of the most profound\nsilence, some of these noiseless conversations took place, in which\nadulation was not the prevailing feature. But Raoul was one among others\nexceedingly clever in this art, so much a matter of etiquette, that from\nthe movement of the lips, he was often able to guess the sense of the\nwords.\n\n\"Who is that Montalais?\" inquired De Wardes, \"and that La Valliere? What\ncountry-town have we had sent here?\"\n\n\"Montalais?\" said the chevalier,--\"oh, I know her; she is a good sort of\ngirl, whom we shall find amusing enough. La Valliere is a charming girl,\nslightly lame.\"\n\n\"Ah! bah!\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"Do not be absurd, De Wardes, there are some very characteristic and\ningenious Latin axioms about lame ladies.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" said De Guiche, looking at Raoul with\nuneasiness, \"be a little careful, I entreat you.\"\n\nBut the uneasiness of the count, in appearance at least, was not needed.\nRaoul had preserved the firmest and most indifferent countenance,\nalthough he had not lost a word that passed. He seemed to keep an\naccount of the insolence and license of the two speakers in order to\nsettle matters with them at the earliest opportunity.\n\nDe Wardes seemed to guess what was passing in his mind, and continued:\n\n\"Who are these young ladies' lovers?\"\n\n\"Montalais's lover?\" said the chevalier.\n\n\"Yes, Montalais first.\"\n\n\"You, I, or De Guiche,--whoever likes, in fact.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Take care, gentlemen,\" exclaimed De Guiche, anxious to put a stop to\nthe chevalier's reply; \"take care, Madame is listening to us.\"\n\nRaoul had thrust his hand up to the wrist into his _justaucorps_ in\ngreat agitation. But the very malignity which he saw was excited against\nthese poor girls made him take a serious resolution. \"Poor Louise,\" he\nthought, \"has come here only with an honorable object in view, and under\nhonorable protection; and I must learn what that object is which she\nhas in view, and who it is that protects her.\" And following Malicorne's\nmaneuver, he made his way toward the group of the maids of honor. The\npresentations were soon over. The king, who had done nothing but look\nat and admire Madame, shortly afterwards left the reception-room,\naccompanied by the two queens. The Chevalier de Lorraine resumed his\nplace beside Monsieur, and, as he accompanied him, insinuated a few\ndrops of the venom he had collected during the last hour, while looking\nat some of the faces in the court, and suspecting that some of their\nhearts might be happy. A few of the persons present followed the king\nas he quitted the apartment; but such of the courtiers as assumed an\nindependence of character, and professed a gallantry of disposition,\nbegan to approach the ladies of the court. The prince paid his\ncompliments to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, Buckingham devoted\nhimself to Madame Chalais and Mademoiselle de Lafayette, whom Madame\nalready distinguished by her notice, and whom she held in high regard.\nAs for the Comte de Guiche, who had abandoned Monsieur as soon as he\ncould approach Madame alone, he conversed, with great animation, with\nMadame de Valentinois, and with Mademoiselle de Crequy and de Chatillon.\n\nAmid these varied political, and amorous interests, Malicorne was\nanxious to gain Montalais's attention; but the latter preferred talking\nwith Raoul, even if it were only to amuse herself with his innumerable\nquestions and his astonishment. Raoul had gone directly to Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere, and had saluted her with the profoundest respect, at\nwhich Louise blushed, and could not say a word. Montalais, however,\nhurried to her assistance.\n\n\"Well, monsieur le vicomte, here we are, you see.\"\n\n\"I do, indeed, see you,\" said Raoul smiling, \"and it is exactly because\nyou are here that I wish to ask for some explanation.\"\n\nMalicorne approached the group with his most fascinating smile.\n\n\"Go away, Malicorne; really you are exceedingly indiscreet.\" At this\nremark Malicorne bit his lips and retired a few steps, without making\nany reply. His smile, however, changed its expression, and from its\nformer frankness, became mocking in its expression.\n\n\"You wished for an explanation, M. Raoul?\" inquired Montalais.\n\n\"It is surely worth one, I think; Mademoiselle de la Valliere is a maid\nof honor to Madame!\"\n\n\"Why should she not be a maid of honor, as well as myself?\" inquired\nMontalais.\n\n\"Pray accept my compliments, young ladies,\" said Raoul, who fancied he\nperceived they were not disposed to answer him in a direct manner.\n\n\"Your remark was not made in a very complimentary manner, vicomte.\"\n\n\"Mine?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I appeal to Louise.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne probably thinks the position is above my condition,\"\nsaid Louise, hesitatingly.\n\n\"Assuredly not,\" replied Raoul, eagerly, \"you know very well that such\nis not my feeling; were you called upon to occupy a queen's throne, I\nshould not be surprised; how much greater reason, then, such a position\nas this? The only circumstance that amazes me is, that I should have\nlearned it only to-day, and that by the merest accident.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Montalais, with her usual giddiness; \"you know\nnothing about it, and there is no reason you should. M. de Bragelonne\nhad written several letters to you, but your mother was the only person\nwho remained behind at Blois, and it was necessary to prevent these\nletters from falling into her hands; I intercepted them, and returned\nthem to M. Raoul, so that he believed you were still at Blois while you\nwere here in Paris, and had no idea whatever, indeed, how high you had\nrisen in rank.\"\n\n\"Did you not inform M. Raoul, as I begged you to do?\"\n\n\"Why should I? to give him opportunity of making some of his severe\nremarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we have had so much\ntrouble in effecting? Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Am I so very severe, then?\" said Raoul, inquiringly.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Montalais, \"it is sufficient to say that it suited me.\nI was about setting off for Paris--you were away; Louise was weeping her\neyes out; interpret that as you please; I begged a friend, a protector\nof mine, who had obtained the appointment for me, to solicit one for\nLouise; the appointment arrived. Louise left in order to get her costume\nprepared; as I had my own ready, I remained behind; I received your\nletters, and returned them to you, adding a few words, promising you a\nsurprise. Your surprise is before you, monsieur, and seems to be a fair\none enough; you have nothing more to ask. Come, M. Malicorne, it is now\ntime to leave these young people together: they have many things to\ntalk about; give me your hand; I trust that you appreciate the honor\nconferred upon you, M. Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" said Raoul, arresting the giddy girl, and giving to\nhis voice an intonation, the gravity of which contrasted with that of\nMontalais; \"forgive me, but may I inquire the name of the protector you\nspeak of; for if protection be extended towards you, Mademoiselle de\nMontalais,--for which, indeed, so many reasons exist,\" added Raoul,\nbowing, \"I do not see that the same reasons exist why Mademoiselle de la\nValliere should be similarly cared for.\"\n\n\"But, M. Raoul,\" said Louise, innocently, \"there is no difference in the\nmatter, and I do not see why I should not tell it you myself; it was M.\nMalicorne who obtained it for me.\"\n\nRaoul remained for a moment almost stupefied, asking himself if they\nwere trifling with him; he then turned round to interrogate Malicorne,\nbut he had been hurried away by Montalais, and was already at some\ndistance from them. Mademoiselle de la Valliere attempted to follow her\nfriend, but Raoul, with gentle authority, detained her.\n\n\"Louise, one word, I beg.\"\n\n\"But, M. Raoul,\" said Louise, blushing, \"we are alone. Every one has\nleft. They will become anxious, and will be looking for us.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" said the young man, smiling, \"we are neither of us of\nsufficient importance for our absence to be remarked.\"\n\n\"But I have my duty to perform, M. Raoul.\"\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, I am acquainted with these usages of the court; you\nwill not be on duty until to-morrow; a few minutes are at your disposal,\nwhich will enable you to give me the information I am about to have the\nhonor to ask you for.\"\n\n\"How serious you are, M. Raoul!\" said Louise.\n\n\"Because the circumstances are serious. Are you listening?\"\n\n\"I am listening; I would only repeat, monsieur, that we are quite\nalone.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Raoul, and, offering her his hand, he led the\nyoung girl into the gallery adjoining the reception-room, the windows\nof which looked out upon the courtyard. Every one hurried towards the\nmiddle window, which had a balcony outside, from which all the details\nof the slow and formal preparations for departure could be seen. Raoul\nopened one of the side windows, and then, being alone with Louise, said\nto her: \"You know, Louise, that from my childhood I have regarded you\nas my sister, as one who has been the confidante of all my troubles, to\nwhom I have entrusted all my hopes.\"\n\n\"Yes, M. Raoul,\" she answered softly; \"yes, M. Raoul, I know that.\"\n\n\"You used, on your side, to show the same friendship towards me, and had\nthe same confidence in me; why have you not, on this occasion, been my\nfriend,--why have you shown suspicion of me?\"\n\nMademoiselle de la Valliere did not answer. \"I fondly thought you loved\nme,\" said Raoul, whose voice became more and more agitated; \"I fondly\nthought you consented to all the plans we had, together, laid down for\nour own happiness, at the time when we wandered up and down the walks of\nCour-Cheverny, under the avenue of poplar trees leading to Blois. You\ndo not answer me, Louise. Is it possible,\" he inquired, breathing with\ndifficulty, \"that you no longer love me?\"\n\n\"I did not say so,\" replied Louise, softly.\n\n\"Oh! tell me the truth, I implore you. All my hopes in life are centered\nin you. I chose you for your gentle and simple tastes. Do not suffer\nyourself to be dazzled, Louise, now that you are in the midst of a court\nwhere all that is pure too soon becomes corrupt--where all that is young\ntoo soon grows old. Louise, close your ears, so as not to hear what may\nbe said; shut your eyes, so as not to see the examples before you; shut\nyour lips, that you may not inhale the corrupting influences about\nyou. Without falsehood or subterfuge, Louise, am I to believe what\nMademoiselle de Montalais stated? Louise, did you come to Paris because\nI was no longer at Blois?\"\n\nLa Valliere blushed and concealed her face in her hands.\n\n\"Yes, it was so, then!\" exclaimed Raoul, delightedly; \"that was, then,\nyour reason for coming here. I love you as I never yet loved you.\nThanks, Louise, for this devotion; but measures must be taken to place\nyou beyond all insult, to shield you from every lure. Louise, a maid of\nhonor, in the court of a young princess in these days of free manners\nand inconstant affections--a maid of honor is placed as an object of\nattack without having any means of defence afforded her; this state of\nthings cannot continue; you must be married in order to be respected.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"Yes, here is my hand, Louise; will you place yours within it?\"\n\n\"But your father?\"\n\n\"My father leaves me perfectly free.\"\n\n\"Yet--\"\n\n\"I understand your scruples, Louise; I will consult my father.\"\n\n\"Reflect, M. Raoul; wait.\"\n\n\"Wait! it is impossible. Reflect, Louise, when _you_ are concerned! it\nwould be insulting,--give me your hand, dear Louise; I am my own master.\nMy father will consent, I know; give me your hand, do not keep me\nwaiting thus. One word in answer, one word only; if not, I shall begin\nto think that, in order to change you forever, nothing more was needed\nthan a single step in the palace, a single breath of favor, a smile from\nthe queen, a look from the king.\"\n\nRaoul had no sooner pronounced this latter word, than La Valliere became\nas pale as death, no doubt from fear at seeing the young man excite\nhimself. With a movement as rapid as thought, she placed both her\nhands in those of Raoul, and then fled, without adding a syllable;\ndisappearing without casting a look behind her. Raoul felt his whole\nframe tremble at the contact of her hand; he received the compact as a\nsolemn bargain wrung by affection from her child-like timidity.\n\n\n\nChapter XV. The Consent of Athos.\n\nRaoul quitted the Palais Royal full of ideas that admitted no delay in\nexecution. He mounted his horse in the courtyard, and followed the road\nto Blois, while the marriage festivities of Monsieur and the princess of\nEngland were being celebrated with exceeding animation by the courtiers,\nbut to the despair of De Guiche and Buckingham. Raoul lost no time\non the road, and in sixteen hours he arrived at Blois. As he traveled\nalong, he marshaled his arguments in the most becoming manner. Fever is\nan argument that cannot be answered, and Raoul had an attack. Athos\nwas in his study, making additions to his memoirs, when Raoul entered,\naccompanied by Grimaud. Keen-sighted and penetrating, a mere glance at\nhis son told him that something extraordinary had befallen him.\n\n\"You seem to come on a matter of importance,\" said he to Raoul, after he\nhad embraced him, pointing to a seat.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the young man; \"and I entreat you to give me\nthe same kind attention that has never yet failed me.\"\n\n\"Speak, Raoul.\"\n\n\"I present the case to you, monsieur, free from all preface, for that\nwould be unworthy of you. Mademoiselle de la Valliere is in Paris as one\nof Madame's maids of honor. I have pondered deeply on the matter; I love\nMademoiselle de la Valliere above everything; and it is not proper to\nleave her in a position where her reputation, her virtue even, may be\nassailed. It is my wish, therefore, to marry her, monsieur, and I have\ncome to solicit your consent to my marriage.\"\n\nWhile this communication was being made to him, Athos maintained the\nprofoundest silence and reserve. Raoul, who had begun his address with\nan assumption of self-possession, finished it by allowing a manifest\nemotion to escape him at every word. Athos fixed upon Bragelonne a\nsearching look, overshadowed indeed by a slight sadness.\n\n\"You have reflected well upon it?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I believe you are already acquainted with my views respecting this\nalliance?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Raoul, in a low tone of voice; \"but you added,\nthat if I persisted--\"\n\n\"You do persist, then?\"\n\nRaoul stammered out an almost unintelligible assent.\n\n\"Your passion,\" continued Athos, tranquilly, \"must indeed be very great,\nsince, notwithstanding my dislike to this union, you persist in wanting\nit.\"\n\nRaoul passed his hand trembling across his forehead to remove the\nperspiration that collected there. Athos looked at him, and his heart\nwas touched by pity. He rose and said,--\n\n\"It is no matter. My own personal feelings are not to be taken into\nconsideration since yours are concerned; I am ready to give it. Tell me\nwhat you want.\"\n\n\"Your kind indulgence, first of all, monsieur,\" said Raoul, taking hold\nof his hand.\n\n\"You have mistaken my feelings, Raoul, I have more than mere indulgence\nfor you in my heart.\"\n\nRaoul kissed as devotedly as a lover could have done the hand he held in\nhis own.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Athos, \"I am quite ready; what do you wish me to\nsign?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever, monsieur, only it would be very kind if you would\ntake the trouble to write to the king, to whom I belong, and solicit his\nmajesty's permission for me to marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Well thought, Raoul! After, or rather before myself, you have a master\nto consult, that master being the king; it is loyal in you to submit\nyourself voluntarily to this double proof; I will grant your request\nwithout delay, Raoul.\"\n\nThe count approached the window, and leaning out, called to Grimaud,\nwho showed his head from an arbor covered with jasmine, which he was\noccupied in trimming.\n\n\"My horses, Grimaud,\" continued the count.\n\n\"Why this order, monsieur?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"We shall set off in a few hours.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"For Paris.\"\n\n\"Paris, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Is not the king at Paris?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, ought we not to go there?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Raoul, almost alarmed by this kind condescension.\n\"I do not ask you to put yourself to such inconvenience, and a letter\nmerely--\"\n\n\"You mistake my position, Raoul; it is not respectful that a simple\ngentleman, such as I am, should write to his sovereign. I wish to speak,\nI ought to speak, to the king, and I will do so. We will go together,\nRaoul.\"\n\n\"You overpower me with your kindness, monsieur.\"\n\n\"How do you think his majesty is affected?\"\n\n\"Towards me, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Excellently well disposed.\"\n\n\"You _know_ that to be so?\" continued the count.\n\n\"The king has himself told me so.\"\n\n\"On what occasion?\"\n\n\"Upon the recommendation of M. d'Artagnan, I believe, and on account of\nan affair in the Place de Greve, when I had the honor to draw my sword\nin the king's service. I have reason to believe that, vanity apart, I\nstand well with his majesty.\"\n\n\"So much the better.\"\n\n\"But I entreat you, monsieur,\" pursued Raoul, \"not to maintain towards\nme your present grave and serious manner. Do not make me bitterly regret\nhaving listened to a feeling stronger than anything else.\"\n\n\"That is the second time you have said so, Raoul; it was quite\nunnecessary; you require my formal consent, and you have it. We need\ntalk no more on the subject, therefore. Come and see my new plantations,\nRaoul.\"\n\nThe young man knew very well, that, after the expression of his father's\nwish, no opportunity of discussion was left him. He bowed his head, and\nfollowed his father into the garden. Athos slowly pointed out to him\nthe grafts, the cuttings, and the avenues he was planting. This perfect\nrepose of manner disconcerted Raoul extremely; the affection with which\nhis own heart was filled seemed so great that the whole world could\nhardly contain it. How, then, could his father's heart remain void,\nand closed to its influence? Bragelonne, therefore, collecting all his\ncourage, suddenly exclaimed,--\n\n\"It is impossible, monsieur, you can have any reason to reject\nMademoiselle de la Valliere! In Heaven's name, she is so good, so\ngentle and pure, that your mind, so perfect in its penetration, ought\nto appreciate her accordingly. Does any secret repugnance, or any\nhereditary dislike, exist between you and her family?\"\n\n\"Look, Raoul, at that beautiful lily of the valley,\" said Athos;\n\"observe how the shade and the damp situation suit it, particularly the\nshadow which that sycamore-tree casts over it, so that the warmth, and\nnot the blazing heat of the sun, filters through its leaves.\"\n\nRaoul stopped, bit his lips, and then, with the blood mantling in his\nface, he said, courageously,--\"One word of explanation, I beg, monsieur.\nYou cannot forget that your son is a man.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Athos, drawing himself up with sternness, \"prove\nto me that you are a man, for you do not show yourself a son. I begged\nyou to wait the opportunity of forming an illustrious alliance. I would\nhave obtained a wife for you from the first ranks of the rich nobility.\nI wish you to be distinguished by the splendor which glory and fortune\nconfer, for nobility of descent you have already.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" exclaimed Raoul, carried away by a first impulse. \"I was\nreproached the other day for not knowing who my mother was.\"\n\nAthos turned pale; then, knitting his brows like the greatest of all\nthe heathen deities:--\"I am waiting to learn the reply you made,\" he\ndemanded, in an imperious manner.\n\n\"Forgive me! oh, forgive me,\" murmured the young man, sinking at once\nfrom the lofty tone he had assumed.\n\n\"What was your reply, monsieur?\" inquired the count, stamping his feet\nupon the ground.\n\n\"Monsieur, my sword was in my hand immediately, my adversary placed\nhimself on guard, I struck his sword over the palisade, and threw him\nafter it.\"\n\n\"Why did you suffer him to live?\"\n\n\"The king has prohibited duelling, and, at the moment, I was an\nambassador of the king.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Athos, \"but all the greater reason I should see his\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to ask him?\"\n\n\"Authority to draw my sword against the man who has inflicted this\ninjury upon me.\"\n\n\"If I did not act as I ought to have done, I beg you to forgive me.\"\n\n\"Did I reproach you, Raoul?\"\n\n\"Still, the permission you are going to ask from the king?\"\n\n\"I will implore his majesty to sign your marriage-contract, but on one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Are conditions necessary with me, monsieur? Command, and you shall be\nobeyed.\"\n\n\"On the condition, I repeat,\" continued Athos; \"that you tell me the\nname of the man who spoke of your mother in that way.\"\n\n\"What need is there that you should know his name; the offense was\ndirected against myself, and the permission once obtained from his\nmajesty, to revenge it is my affair.\"\n\n\"Tell me his name, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I will not allow you to expose yourself.\"\n\n\"Do you take me for a Don Diego? His name, I say.\"\n\n\"You insist upon it?\"\n\n\"I demand it.\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Wardes.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Athos, tranquilly, \"I know him. But our horses are\nready, I see; and, instead of delaying our departure for a couple of\nhours, we will set off at once. Come, monsieur.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XVI. Monsieur Becomes Jealous of the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nWhile the Comte de la Fere was proceeding on his way to Pairs,\naccompanied by Raoul, the Palais Royal was the theatre wherein a scene\nof what Moliere would have called excellent comedy, was being performed.\nFour days had elapsed since his marriage, and Monsieur, having\nbreakfasted very hurriedly, passed into his ante-chamber, frowning and\nout of temper. The repast had not been over-agreeable. Madame had had\nbreakfast served in her own apartment, and Monsieur had breakfasted\nalmost alone; the Chevalier de Lorraine and Manicamp were the only\npersons present at the meal, which lasted three-quarters of an hour\nwithout a single syllable having been uttered. Manicamp, who was less\nintimate with his royal highness than the Chevalier de Lorraine, vainly\nendeavored to detect, from the expression of the prince's face, what had\nmade him so ill-humored. The Chevalier de Lorraine, who had no occasion\nto speculate about anything, inasmuch as he knew all, ate his breakfast\nwith that extraordinary appetite which the troubles of one's friends but\nstimulates, and enjoyed at the same time both Monsieur's ill-humor and\nthe vexation of Manicamp. He seemed delighted, while he went on eating,\nto detain a prince, who was very impatient to move, still at table.\nMonsieur at times repented the ascendency which he had permitted the\nChevalier de Lorraine to acquire over him, and which exempted the latter\nfrom any observance of etiquette towards him. Monsieur was now in one\nof those moods, but he dreaded as much as he liked the chevalier, and\ncontented himself with nursing his anger without betraying it. Every\nnow and then Monsieur raised his eyes to the ceiling, then lowered them\ntowards the slices of _pate_ which the chevalier was attacking, and\nfinally, not caring to betray the resentment, he gesticulated in a\nmanner which Harlequin might have envied. At last, however, Monsieur\ncould control himself no longer, and at the dessert, rising from the\ntable in excessive wrath, as we have related, he left the Chevalier de\nLorraine to finish his breakfast as he pleased. Seeing Monsieur rise\nfrom the table, Manicamp, napkin in hand, rose also. Monsieur ran rather\nthan walked, towards the ante-chamber, where, noticing an usher in\nattendance, he gave him some directions in a low tone of voice.\nThen, turning back again, but avoiding passing through the breakfast\napartment, he crossed several rooms, with the intention of seeking the\nqueen-mother in her oratory, where she usually remained.\n\nIt was about ten o'clock in the morning. Anne of Austria was engaged in\nwriting as Monsieur entered. The queen-mother was extremely attached to\nher son, for he was handsome in person and amiable in disposition. He\nwas, in fact, more affectionate, and it might be, more effeminate\nthan the king. He pleased his mother by those trifling sympathizing\nattentions all women are glad to receive. Anne of Austria, who would\nhave been rejoiced to have had a daughter, almost found in this, her\nfavorite son, the attentions, solicitude, and playful manners of a\nchild of twelve years of age. All the time he passed with his mother he\nemployed in admiring her arms, in giving his opinion upon her cosmetics,\nand recipes for compounding essences, in which she was very particular;\nand then, too, he kissed her hands and cheeks in the most childlike and\nendearing manner, and had always some sweetmeats to offer her, or some\nnew style of dress to recommend. Anne of Austria loved the king,\nor rather the regal power in her eldest son; Louis XIV. represented\nlegitimacy by right divine. With the king, her character was that of\nthe queen-mother, with Philip she was simply the mother. The latter\nknew that, of all places, a mother's heart is the most compassionate and\nsurest. When quite a child he always fled there for refuge when he and\nhis brother quarreled, often, after having struck him, which constituted\nthe crime of high treason on his part, after certain engagements with\nhands and nails, in which the king and his rebellious subject indulged\nin their night-dresses respecting the right to a disputed bed, having\ntheir servant Laporte as umpire,--Philip, conqueror, but terrified at\nvictory, used to flee to his mother to obtain reinforcements from her,\nor at least the assurance of forgiveness, which Louis XIV. granted with\ndifficulty, and after an interval. Anne, from this habit of peaceable\nintervention, succeeded in arranging the disputes of her sons, and in\nsharing, at the same time, all their secrets. The king, somewhat jealous\nof that maternal solicitude which was bestowed particularly on his\nbrother, felt disposed to show towards Anne of Austria more submission\nand attachment than his character really dictated. Anne of Austria had\nadopted this line of conduct especially towards the young queen. In this\nmanner she ruled with almost despotic sway over the royal household, and\nshe was already preparing her batteries to govern with the same absolute\nauthority the household of her second son. Anne experienced almost\na feeling of pride whenever she saw any one enter her apartment with\nwoe-begone looks, pale cheeks, or red eyes, gathering from appearances\nthat assistance was required either by the weakest or the most\nrebellious. She was writing, we have said, when Monsieur entered her\noratory, not with red eyes or pale cheeks, but restless, out of temper,\nand annoyed. With an absent air he kissed his mother's hands, and sat\nhimself down before receiving her permission to do so. Considering the\nstrict rules of etiquette established at the court of Anne of Austria,\nthis forgetfulness of customary civilities was a sign of preoccupation,\nespecially on Philip's part, who, of his own accord, observed a respect\ntowards her of a somewhat exaggerated character. If, therefore, he so\nnotoriously failed in this regard, there must be a serious cause for it.\n\n\"What is the matter, Philip?\" inquired Anne of Austria, turning towards\nher son.\n\n\"A good many things,\" murmured the prince, in a doleful tone of voice.\n\n\"You look like a man who has a great deal to do,\" said the queen, laying\ndown her pen. Philip frowned, but did not reply. \"Among the various\nsubjects which occupy your mind,\" said Anne of Austria, \"there must\nsurely be one that absorbs it more than others.\"\n\n\"One has indeed occupied me more than any other.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it? I am listening.\"\n\nPhilip opened his mouth as if to express all the troubles his mind was\nfilled with, and which he seemed to be waiting only for an opportunity\nof declaring. But he suddenly became silent, and a sigh alone expressed\nall that his heart was overflowing with.\n\n\"Come, Philip, show a little firmness,\" said the queen-mother. \"When one\nhas to complain of anything, it is generally an individual who is the\ncause of it. Am I not right?\"\n\n\"I do not say no, madame.\"\n\n\"Whom do you wish to speak about? Come, take courage.\"\n\n\"In fact, madame, what I might possibly have to say must be kept a\nprofound secret; for when a lady is in the case--\"\n\n\"Ah! you are speaking of Madame, then?\" inquired the queen-mother, with\na feeling of the liveliest curiosity.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you wish to speak of Madame, do not hesitate to do so. I\nam your mother, and she is no more than a stranger to me. Yet, as she is\nmy daughter-in-law, rest assured I shall be interested, even were it for\nyour own sake alone, in hearing all you may have to say about her.\"\n\n\"Pray tell me, madame, in your turn, whether you have not remarked\nsomething?\"\n\n\"'Something'! Philip? Your words almost frighten me, from their want of\nmeaning. What do you mean by 'something?'\"\n\n\"Madame is pretty, certainly.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Yet not altogether beautiful.\"\n\n\"No, but as she grows older, she will probably become strikingly\nbeautiful. You must have remarked the change which a few years have\nalready made in her. Her beauty will improve more and more; she is now\nonly sixteen years of age. At fifteen I was, myself, very thin; but even\nas she is at present, Madame is very pretty.\"\n\n\"And consequently others have remarked it.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, for a woman of ordinary rank is noticed--and with still\ngreater reason a princess.\"\n\n\"She has been well brought up, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Madame Henriette, her mother, is a woman somewhat cold in manner,\nslightly pretentious, but full of noble thoughts. The princess's\neducation may have been neglected, but her principles, I believe, are\ngood. Such at least was the opinion I formed of her when she resided in\nFrance; but she afterwards returned to England, and I am ignorant what\nmay have occurred there.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Simply that there are some heads naturally giddy, which are easily\nturned by prosperity.\"\n\n\"That is the very word, madame. I think the princess rather giddy.\"\n\n\"We must not exaggerate, Philip; she is clever and witty, and has a\ncertain amount of coquetry very natural in a young woman; but this\ndefect in persons of high rank and position, is a great advantage at a\ncourt. A princess who is tinged with coquetry usually forms a brilliant\ncourt; her smile stimulates luxury, arouses wit, and even courage; the\nnobles, too, fight better for a prince whose wife is beautiful.\"\n\n\"Thank you extremely, madame,\" said Philip, with some temper; \"you\nreally have drawn some very alarming pictures for me.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\" asked the queen, with pretended simplicity.\n\n\"You know, madame,\" said Philip, dolefully, \"whether I had or had not a\nvery great dislike to getting married.\"\n\n\"Now, indeed, you alarm me. You have some serious cause of complaint\nagainst Madame.\"\n\n\"I do not precisely say it is serious.\"\n\n\"In that case, then, throw aside your doleful looks. If you show\nyourself to others in your present state, people will take you for a\nvery unhappy husband.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" replied Philip, \"I am not altogether satisfied as a\nhusband, and I shall not be sorry if others know it.\"\n\n\"For shame, Philip.\"\n\n\"Well, then, madame, I will tell you frankly that I do not understand\nthe life I am required to lead.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"My wife does not seem to belong to me; she is always leaving me\nfor some reason or another. In the mornings there are visits,\ncorrespondences, and toilettes; in the evenings, balls and concerts.\"\n\n\"You are jealous, Philip.\"\n\n\"I! Heaven forbid. Let others act the part of a jealous husband, not I.\nBut I _am_ annoyed.\"\n\n\"All these things you reproach your wife with are perfectly innocent,\nand, so long as you have nothing of greater importance--\"\n\n\"Yet, listen; without being very blamable, a woman can excite a\ngood deal of uneasiness. Certain visitors may be received, certain\npreferences shown, which expose young women to remark, and which are\nenough to drive out of their senses even those husbands who are least\ndisposed to be jealous.\"\n\n\"Ah! now we are coming to the real point at last, and not without some\ndifficulty. You speak of frequent visits, and certain preferences--very\ngood; for the last hour we have been beating about the bush, and at last\nyou have broached the true question.\"\n\n\"Well then, yes--\"\n\n\"This is more serious than I thought. It is possible, then, that Madame\ncan have given you grounds for these complaints against her?\"\n\n\"Precisely so.\"\n\n\"What, your wife, married only four days ago, prefers some other person\nto yourself? Take care, Philip, you exaggerate your grievances; in\nwishing to prove everything, you prove nothing.\"\n\nThe prince, bewildered by his mother's serious manner, wished to reply,\nbut he could only stammer out some unintelligible words.\n\n\"You draw back, then?\" said Anne of Austria. \"I prefer that, as it is an\nacknowledgement of your mistake.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Philip, \"I do not draw back, and I will prove all I\nasserted. I spoke of preference and of visits, did I not? Well, listen.\"\n\nAnne of Austria prepared herself to listen, with that love of gossip\nwhich the best woman living and the best mother, were she a queen even,\nalways finds in being mixed up with the petty squabbles of a household.\n\n\"Well,\" said Philip, \"tell me one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Why does my wife retain an English court about her?\" said Philip, as\nhe crossed his arms and looked his mother steadily in the face, as if he\nwere convinced that she could not answer the question.\n\n\"For a very simple reason,\" returned Anne of Austria; \"because the\nEnglish are her countrymen, because they have expended large sums in\norder to accompany her to France, and because it would hardly be polite\n--not politic, certainly--to dismiss abruptly those members of the\nEnglish nobility who have not shrunk from any devotion or sacrifice.\"\n\n\"A wonderful sacrifice indeed,\" returned Philip, \"to desert a wretched\ncountry to come to a beautiful one, where a greater effect can\nbe produced for a guinea that can be procured elsewhere for four!\nExtraordinary devotion, really, to travel a hundred leagues in company\nwith a woman one is in love with!\"\n\n\"In love, Philip! think what you are saying. Who is in love with\nMadame?\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham. Perhaps you will defend him, too?\"\n\nAnne of Austria blushed and smiled at the same time. The name of the\nDuke of Buckingham recalled certain recollections of a very tender and\nmelancholy nature. \"The Duke of Buckingham?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yes; one of those arm-chair soldiers--\"\n\n\"The Buckinghams are loyal and brave,\" said Anne of Austria,\ncourageously.\n\n\"This is too bad; my own mother takes the part of my wife's lover\nagainst me,\" exclaimed Philip, incensed to such an extent that his weak\norganization was affected almost to tears.\n\n\"Philip, my son,\" exclaimed Anne of Austria, \"such an expression is\nunworthy of you. Your wife has no lover; and, had she one, it would not\nbe the Duke of Buckingham. The members of that family, I repeat,\nare loyal and discreet, and the rights of hospitality are sure to be\nrespected by them.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham is an Englishman, madame,\" said Philip, \"and may\nI ask if the English so very religiously respect what belongs to princes\nof France?\"\n\nAnne blushed a second time, and turned aside under the pretext of taking\nher pen from her desk again, but in reality to conceal her confusion\nfrom her son. \"Really, Philip,\" she said, \"you seem to discover\nexpressions for the purpose of embarrassing me, and your anger blinds\nyou while it alarms me; reflect a little.\"\n\n\"There is no need for reflection, madame. I can see with my own eyes.\"\n\n\"Well, and what do you see?\"\n\n\"That Buckingham never quits my wife. He presumes to make presents to\nher, and she ventures to accept them. Yesterday she was talking about\n_sauchets a la violette_; well, our French perfumers, you know very\nwell, madame, for you have over and over again asked for it without\nsuccess--our French perfumers, I say, have never been able to procure\nthis scent. The duke, however, wore about him a _sachet a la violette_,\nand I am sure that the one my wife has came from him.\"\n\n\"Indeed, monsieur,\" said Anne of Austria, \"you build your pyramids on\nneedle points; be careful. What harm, I ask you, can there be in a man\ngiving to his countrywoman a recipe for a new essence? These strange\nideas, I protest, painfully recall your father to me; he who so\nfrequently and so unjustly made me suffer.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham's father was probably more reserved and more\nrespectful than his son,\" said Philip, thoughtlessly, not perceiving how\ndeeply he had wounded his mother's feelings. The queen turned pale,\nand pressed her clenched hands upon her bosom; but, recovering herself\nimmediately, she said, \"You came here with some intention or another, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"I came, madame, intending to complain energetically, and to inform you\nthat I will not submit to such behavior from the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"What do you intend to do, then?\"\n\n\"I shall complain to the king.\"\n\n\"And what do you expect the king to reply?\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Monsieur, with an expression of stern\ndetermination on his countenance, which offered a singular contrast to\nits usual gentleness. \"Very well. I will right myself!\"\n\n\"What do you call righting yourself?\" inquired Anne of Austria, in\nalarm.\n\n\"I will have the Duke of Buckingham quit the princess, I will have him\nquit France, and I will see that my wishes are intimated to him.\"\n\n\"You will intimate nothing of the kind, Philip,\" said the queen, \"for if\nyou act in that manner, and violate hospitality to that extent, I will\ninvoke the severity of the king against you.\"\n\n\"Do you threaten me, madame?\" exclaimed Philip, almost in tears; \"do you\nthreaten me in the midst of my complaints?\"\n\n\"I do not threaten you; I do but place an obstacle in the path of your\nhasty anger. I maintain, that, to adopt towards the Duke of Buckingham,\nor any other Englishman, any rigorous measure--to take even a\ndiscourteous step towards him, would be to plunge France and England\ninto the most disastrous disagreement. Can it be possible that a prince\nof the blood, the brother of the king of France, does not know how to\nhide an injury, even did it exist in reality, where political necessity\nrequires it?\" Philip made a movement. \"Besides,\" continued the queen,\n\"the injury is neither true nor possible, and it is merely a matter of\nsilly jealousy.\"\n\n\"Madame, I know what I know.\"\n\n\"Whatever you may know, I can only advise you to be patient.\"\n\n\"I am not patient by disposition, madame.\"\n\nThe queen rose, full of severity, and with an icy ceremonious manner.\n\"Explain what you really require, monsieur,\" she said.\n\n\"I do not require anything, madame; I simply express what I desire.\nIf the Duke of Buckingham does not, of his own accord, discontinue his\nvisits to my apartments I shall forbid him entrance.\"\n\n\"That is a point you will refer to the king,\" said Anne of Austria, her\nheart swelling as she spoke, and her voice trembling with emotion.\n\n\"But, madame,\" exclaimed Philip, striking his hands together, \"act as my\nmother and not as the queen, since I speak to you as a son; it is simply\na matter of a few minutes' conversation between the duke and myself.\"\n\n\"It is that very conversation I forbid,\" said the queen, resuming her\nauthority, \"because it is unworthy of you.\"\n\n\"Be it so; I will not appear in the matter, but I shall intimate my will\nto Madame.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the queen-mother, with a melancholy arising from reflection,\n\"never tyrannize over a wife--never behave too haughtily or imperiously\ntowards your own. A woman unwillingly convinced, is unconvinced.\"\n\n\"What is to be done, then?--I will consult my friends about it.\"\n\n\"Yes, your double-dealing advisers, your Chevalier de Lorraine--your De\nWardes. Intrust the conduct of this affair to me. You wish the Duke of\nBuckingham to leave, do you not?\"\n\n\"As soon as possible, madame.\"\n\n\"Send the duke to me, then; smile upon your wife, behave to her, to the\nking, to every one, as usual. But follow no advice but mine. Alas! I too\nwell know what any household comes to, that is troubled by advisers.\"\n\n\"You shall be obeyed, madame.\"\n\n\"And you will be satisfied at the result. Send the duke to me.\"\n\n\"That will not be difficult.\"\n\n\"Where do you suppose him to be?\"\n\n\"At my wife's door, whose _levee_ he is probably awaiting.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Anne of Austria, calmly. \"Be good enough to tell the\nduke that I shall be charmed if he will pay me a visit.\"\n\nPhilip kissed his mother's hand, and started off to find the Duke of\nBuckingham.\n\n\n\nChapter XVII. Forever!\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham, obedient to the queen-mother's invitation,\npresented himself in her apartments half an hour after the departure of\nthe Duc d'Orleans. When his name was announced by the gentleman-usher\nin attendance, the queen, who was sitting with her elbow resting on a\ntable, and her head buried in her hands, rose, and smilingly received\nthe graceful and respectful salutation which the duke addressed to her.\nAnne of Austria was still beautiful. It is well known that at her then\nsomewhat advanced age, her long auburn hair, perfectly formed hands, and\nbright ruby lips, were still the admiration of all who saw her. On the\npresent occasion, abandoned entirely to a remembrance which evoked all\nthe past in her heart, she looked almost as beautiful as in the days\nof her youth, when her palace was open to the visits of the Duke of\nBuckingham's father, then a young and impassioned man, as well as an\nunfortunate prince, who lived for her alone, and died with her name upon\nhis lips. Anne of Austria fixed upon Buckingham a look so tender in\nits expression, that it denoted, not alone the indulgence of maternal\naffection, but a gentleness of expression like the coquetry of a woman\nwho loves.\n\n\"Your majesty,\" said Buckingham, respectfully, \"desired to speak to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, duke,\" said the queen, in English; \"will you be good enough to sit\ndown?\"\n\nThe favor which Anne of Austria thus extended to the young man, and the\nwelcome sound of the language of a country from which the duke had been\nestranged since his stay in France, deeply affected him. He immediately\nconjectured that the queen had a request to make of him. After having\nabandoned the first few moments to the irrepressible emotions she\nexperienced, the queen resumed the smiling air with which she had\nreceived him. \"What do you think of France?\" she said, in French.\n\n\"It is a lovely country, madame,\" replied the duke.\n\n\"Had you ever seen it before?\"\n\n\"Once only, madame.\"\n\n\"But, like all true Englishmen, you prefer England?\"\n\n\"I prefer my own native land to France,\" replied the duke; \"but if\nyour majesty were to ask me which of the two cities, London or Pairs, I\nshould prefer as a residence, I should be forced to answer Paris.\"\n\nAnne of Austria observed the ardent manner with which these words had\nbeen pronounced. \"I am told, my lord, you have rich possessions in your\nown country, and that you live in a splendid and time-honored place.\"\n\n\"It was my father's residence,\" replied Buckingham, casting down his\neyes.\n\n\"Those are indeed great advantages and _souvenirs_,\" replied the\nqueen, alluding, in spite of herself, to recollections from which it is\nimpossible voluntarily to detach one's self.\n\n\"In fact,\" said the duke, yielding to the melancholy influence of this\nopening conversation, \"sensitive persons live as much in the past or the\nfuture, as in the present.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" said the queen, in a low tone of voice. \"It\nfollows, then, my lord,\" she added, \"that you, who are a man of feeling,\nwill soon quit France in order to shut yourself up with your wealth and\nyour relics of the past.\"\n\nBuckingham raised his head and said, \"I think not, madame.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think of leaving England in order to take up my\nresidence in France.\"\n\nIt was now Anne of Austria's turn to exhibit surprise. \"Why?\" she said.\n\"Are you not in favor with the new king?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so, madame, for his majesty's kindness to me is unbounded.\"\n\n\"It cannot,\" said the queen, \"be because your fortune has diminished,\nfor it is said to be enormous.\"\n\n\"My income, madame, has never been so large.\"\n\n\"There is some secret cause, then?\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" said Buckingham, eagerly, \"there is nothing secret in my\nreason for this determination. I prefer residence in France; I like\na court so distinguished by its refinement and courtesy; I like\nthe amusements, somewhat serious in their nature, which are not the\namusements of my own country, and which are met with in France.\"\n\nAnne of Austria smiled shrewdly. \"Amusements of a serious nature?\" she\nsaid. \"Has your Grace well reflected on their seriousness?\" The duke\nhesitated. \"There is no amusement so serious,\" continued the queen, \"as\nto prevent a man of your rank--\"\n\n\"Your majesty seems to insist greatly on that point,\" interrupted the\nduke.\n\n\"Do you think so, my lord?\"\n\n\"If you will forgive me for saying so, it is the second time you have\nvaunted the attractions of England at the expense of the delight which\nall experience who live in France.\"\n\nAnne of Austria approached the young man, and placing her beautiful\nhand upon his shoulder, which trembled at the touch, said, \"Believe me,\nmonsieur, nothing can equal a residence in one's own native country. I\nhave very frequently had occasion to regret Spain. I have lived long, my\nlord, very long for a woman, and I confess to you, that not a year has\npassed I have not regretted Spain.\"\n\n\"Not one year, madame?\" said the young duke coldly. \"Not one of those\nyears when you reigned Queen of Beauty--as you still are, indeed?\"\n\n\"A truce to flattery, duke, for I am old enough to be your mother.\" She\nemphasized these latter words in a manner, and with a gentleness, which\npenetrated Buckingham's heart. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I am old enough to be\nyour mother; and for this reason, I will give you a word of advice.\"\n\n\"That advice being that I should return to London?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nThe duke clasped his hands with a terrified gesture, which could not\nfail of its effect upon the queen, already disposed to softer feelings\nby the tenderness of her own recollections. \"It must be so,\" added the\nqueen.\n\n\"What!\" he again exclaimed, \"am I seriously told that I must\nleave,--that I must exile myself,--that I am to flee at once?\"\n\n\"Exile yourself, did you say? One would fancy France was your native\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Madame, the country of those who love is the country of those whom they\nlove.\"\n\n\"Not another word, my lord; you forget whom you are addressing.\"\n\nBuckingham threw himself on his knees. \"Madame, you are the source of\nintelligence, of goodness, and of compassion; you are the first person\nin this kingdom, not only by your rank, but the first person in the\nworld on account of your angelic attributes. I have said nothing,\nmadame. Have I, indeed, said anything you should answer with such a\ncruel remark? What have I betrayed?\"\n\n\"You have betrayed yourself,\" said the queen, in a low tone of voice.\n\n\"I have said nothing,--I know nothing.\"\n\n\"You forget you have spoken and thought in the presence of a woman; and\nbesides--\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said the duke, \"no one knows you are listening to me.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is known; you have all the defects and all the\nqualities of youth.\"\n\n\"I have been betrayed or denounced, then?\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By those who, at Le Havre, had, with infernal perspicacity, read my\nheart like an open book.\"\n\n\"I do not know whom you mean.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne, for instance.\"\n\n\"I know the name without being acquainted with the person to whom it\nbelongs. M. de Bragelonne has said nothing.\"\n\n\"Who can it be, then? If any one, madame, had had the boldness to notice\nin me that which I do not myself wish to behold--\"\n\n\"What would you do, duke?\"\n\n\"There are secrets which kill those who discover them.\"\n\n\"He, then, who has discovered your secret, madman that you are, still\nlives; and, what is more, you will not slay him, for he is armed on all\nsides,--he is a husband, a jealous man,--he is the second gentleman in\nFrance,--he is my son, the Duc du Orleans.\"\n\nThe duke turned pale as death. \"You are very cruel, madame,\" he said.\n\n\"You see, Buckingham,\" said Anne of Austria, sadly, \"how you pass from\none extreme to another, and fight with shadows, when it would seem so\neasy to remain at peace with yourself.\"\n\n\"If we fight, madame, we die on the field of battle,\" replied the young\nman, gently, abandoning himself to the most gloomy depression.\n\nAnne ran towards him and took him by the hand. \"Villiers,\" she said, in\nEnglish, with a vehemence of tone which nothing could resist, \"what\nis it you ask? Do you ask a mother to sacrifice her son,--a queen to\nconsent to the dishonor of her house? Child that you are, do not dream\nof it. What! in order to spare your tears am I to commit these crimes?\nVilliers! you speak of the dead; the dead, at least, were full of\nrespect and submission; they resigned themselves to an order of exile;\nthey carried their despair away with them in their hearts, like a\npriceless possession, because the despair was caused by the woman they\nloved, and because death, thus deceptive, was like a gift of a favor\nconferred upon them.\"\n\nBuckingham rose, his features distorted, and his hands pressed against\nhis heart. \"You are right, madame,\" he said, \"but those of whom you\nspeak had received their order of exile from the lips of the one whom\nthey loved; they were not driven away; they were entreated to leave, and\nwere not laughed at.\"\n\n\"No,\" murmured Anne of Austria, \"they were not forgotten. But who says\nyou are driven away, or that you are exiled? Who says that your devotion\nwill not be remembered? I do not speak on any one's behalf but my own,\nwhen I tell you to leave. Do me this kindness,--grant me this favor; let\nme, for this also, be indebted to one of your name.\"\n\n\"It is for your sake, then, madame?\"\n\n\"For mine alone.\"\n\n\"No one whom I shall leave behind me will venture to mock,--no prince\neven who shall say, 'I required it.'\"\n\n\"Listen to me, duke,\" and hereupon the dignified features of the queen\nassumed a solemn expression. \"I swear to you that no one commands in\nthis matter but myself. I swear to you that, not only shall no one\neither laugh or boast in any way, but no one even shall fail in the\nrespect due to your rank. Rely upon me, duke, as I rely upon you.\"\n\n\"You do not explain yourself, madame; my heart is full of bitterness,\nand I am in utter despair; no consolation, however gentle and\naffectionate, can afford me relief.\"\n\n\"Do you remember your mother, duke?\" replied the queen, with a winning\nsmile.\n\n\"Very slightly, madame; yet I remember how she used to cover me with her\ncaresses and her tears whenever I wept.\"\n\n\"Villiers,\" murmured the queen, passing her arm round the young man's\nneck, \"look upon me as your mother, and believe that no one shall ever\nmake my son weep.\"\n\n\"I thank you, madame,\" said the young man affected and almost suffocated\nby his emotion; \"I feel there is still room in my heart for a gentler\nand nobler sentiment than love.\"\n\nThe queen-mother looked at him and pressed his hand. \"Go,\" she said.\n\n\"When must I leave? Command me.\"\n\n\"At any time that may suit you, my lord,\" resumed the queen; \"you will\nchoose your own day of departure. Instead, however, of setting off\nto-day, as you would doubtless wish to do, or to-morrow, as others\nmay have expected, leave the day after to-morrow, in the evening; but\nannounce to-day that it is your wish to leave.\"\n\n\"My wish?\" murmured the young duke.\n\n\"Yes, duke.\"\n\n\"And shall I never return to France?\"\n\nAnne of Austria reflected for a moment, seemingly absorbed in sad and\nserious thought. \"It would be a consolation for me,\" she said, \"if\nyou were to return on the day when I shall be carried to my final\nresting-place at Saint-Dennis beside the king, my husband.\"\n\n\"Madame, you are goodness itself; the tide of prosperity is setting in\non you; your cup brims over with happiness, and many long years are yet\nbefore you.\"\n\n\"In that case you will not come for some time, then,\" said the queen,\nendeavoring to smile.\n\n\"I shall not return,\" said Buckingham, \"young as I am. Death does not\nreckon by years; it is impartial; some die young, some reach old age.\"\n\n\"I will not harbor any sorrowful ideas, duke. Let me comfort you; return\nin two years. I perceive from your face that the very idea which saddens\nyou so much now, will have disappeared before six months have passed,\nand will be not only dead but forgotten in the period of absence I have\nassigned you.\"\n\n\"I think you judged me better a little while ago, madame,\" replied the\nyoung man, \"when you said that time is powerless against members of the\nfamily of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Silence,\" said the queen, kissing the duke upon the forehead with an\naffection she could not restrain. \"Go, go; spare me and forget yourself\nno longer. I am the queen; you are the subject of the king of England;\nKing Charles awaits your return. Adieu, Villiers,--farewell.\"\n\n\"Forever!\" replied the young man, and he fled, endeavoring to master his\nemotions.\n\nAnne leaned her head upon her hands, and then looking at herself in the\nglass, murmured, \"It has been truly said, that a woman who has truly\nloved is always young, and that the bloom of the girl of twenty years\never lies concealed in some secret cloister of the heart.\" [1]\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII. King Louis XIV. does not think Mademoiselle de la\nValliere either rich enough or pretty enough for a Gentleman of the Rank\nof the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\n\n\nRaoul and the Comte de la Fere reached Paris the evening of the same day\non which Buckingham had held the conversation with the queen-mother.\nThe count had scarcely arrived, when, through Raoul, he solicited an\naudience of the king. His majesty had passed a portion of the morning in\nlooking over, with madame and the ladies of the court, various goods of\nLyons manufacture, of which he had made his sister-in-law a present. A\ncourt dinner had succeeded, then cards, and afterwards, according to his\nusual custom, the king, leaving the card-tables at eight o'clock, passed\ninto his cabinet in order to work with M. Colbert and M. Fouquet. Raoul\nentered the ante-chamber at the very moment the two ministers quitted\nit, and the king, perceiving him through the half-closed door, said,\n\"What do you want, M. de Bragelonne?\"\n\nThe young man approached: \"An audience, sire,\" he replied, \"for the\nComte de la Fere, who has just arrived from Blois, and is most anxious\nto have an interview with your majesty.\"\n\n\"I have an hour to spare between cards and supper,\" said the king. \"Is\nthe Comte de la Fere at hand?\"\n\n\"He is below, and awaits your majesty's permission.\"\n\n\"Let him come up at once,\" said the king, and five minutes afterwards\nAthos entered the presence of Louis XIV. He was received by the king\nwith that gracious kindness of manner which Louis, with a tact beyond\nhis years, reserved for the purpose of gaining those who were not to be\nconquered by ordinary favors. \"Let me hope, comte,\" said the king, \"that\nyou have come to ask me for something.\"\n\n\"I will not conceal from your majesty,\" replied the comte, \"that I am\nindeed come for that purpose.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said the king, joyously.\n\n\"It is not for myself, sire.\"\n\n\"So much the worse; but, at least, I will do for your _protege_ what you\nrefuse to permit me to do for you.\"\n\n\"Your majesty encourages me. I have come to speak on behalf of the\nVicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"It is the same as if you spoke on your own behalf, comte.\"\n\n\"Not altogether so, sire. I am desirous of obtaining from your majesty\nthat which I cannot ask for myself. The vicomte thinks of marrying.\"\n\n\"He is still very young; but that does not matter. He is an eminently\ndistinguished man; I will choose a wife for him.\"\n\n\"He has already chosen one, sire, and only awaits your consent.\"\n\n\"It is only a question, then, of signing the marriage-contract?\" Athos\nbowed. \"Has he chose a wife whose fortune and position accord with your\nown anticipation?\"\n\nAthos hesitated for a moment. \"His affirmed wife is of good birth, but\nhas no fortune.\"\n\n\"That is a misfortune we can remedy.\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me with gratitude, sire; but your majesty will permit me\nto offer a remark?\"\n\n\"Do so, comte.\"\n\n\"Your majesty seems to intimate an intention of giving a\nmarriage-portion to this young lady.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I should regret, sire, if the step I have taken towards your majesty\nshould be attended by this result.\"\n\n\"No false delicacy, comte; what is the bride's name?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere,\" said Athos, coldly.\n\n\"I seem to know that name,\" said the king, as if reflecting; \"there was\na Marquis de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, it is his daughter.\"\n\n\"But he died, and his widow married again M. de Saint-Remy, I think,\nsteward of the dowager Madame's household.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is correctly informed.\"\n\n\"More than that, the young lady has lately become one of the princess's\nmaids of honor.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is better acquainted with her history than am I.\"\n\nThe king again reflected, and glancing at the comte's anxious\ncountenance, said: \"The young lady does not seem to me to be very\npretty, comte.\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure,\" replied Athos.\n\n\"I have seen her, but she hardly struck me as being so.\"\n\n\"She seems to be a good and modest girl, but has little beauty, sire.\"\n\n\"Beautiful fair hair, however.\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"And her blue eyes are tolerably good.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"With regard to her beauty, then, the match is but an ordinary one. Now\nfor the money side of the question.\"\n\n\"Fifteen to twenty thousand francs dowry at the very outset, sire; the\nlovers are disinterested enough; for myself, I care little for money.\"\n\n\"For superfluity, you mean; but a needful amount is of importance. With\nfifteen thousand francs, without landed property, a woman cannot live at\ncourt. We will make up the deficiency; I will do it for De Bragelonne.\"\nThe king again remarked the coldness with which Athos received the\nremark.\n\n\"Let us pass from the question of money to that of rank,\" said Louis\nXIV.; \"the daughter of the Marquis de la Valliere, that is well enough;\nbut there is that excellent Saint-Remy, who somewhat damages the credit\nof the family; and you, comte, are rather particular, I believe, about\nyour own family.\"\n\n\"Sire, I no longer hold to anything but my devotion to your majesty.\"\n\nThe king again paused. \"A moment, comte. You have surprised me in no\nlittle degree from the beginning of your conversation. You came to ask\nme to authorize a marriage, and you seem greatly disturbed in having to\nmake the request. Nay, pardon me, comte, but I am rarely deceived,\nyoung as I am; for while with some persons I place my friendship at the\ndisposal of my understanding, with others I call my distrust to my aid,\nby which my discernment is increased. I repeat, that you do not prefer\nyour request as though you wished it success.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, that is true.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, then; refuse.\"\n\n\"Nay, sire; I love De Bragelonne with my whole heart; he is smitten with\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, he weaves dreams of bliss for the future;\nI am not one who is willing to destroy the illusions of youth. This\nmarriage is objectionable to me, but I implore your majesty to consent\nto it forthwith, and thus make Raoul happy.\"\n\n\"Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?\"\n\n\"If your majesty requires me to speak candidly, I do not believe in\nMademoiselle de la Valliere's affection; the delight at being at court,\nthe honor of being in the service of Madame, counteract in her head\nwhatever affection she may happen to have in her heart; it is a marriage\nsimilar to many others which already exist at court; but De Bragelonne\nwishes it, and so let it be.\"\n\n\"And yet you do not resemble those easy-tempered fathers who volunteer\nas stepping-stones for their children,\" said the king.\n\n\"I am determined enough against the viciously disposed, but not so\nagainst men of upright character. Raoul is suffering; he is in great\ndistress of mind; his disposition, naturally light and cheerful, has\nbecome gloomy and melancholy. I do not wish to deprive your majesty of\nthe services he may be able to render.\"\n\n\"I understand you,\" said the king; \"and what is more, I understand your\nheart, too, comte.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion, therefore,\" replied the comte, \"to tell your\nmajesty that my object is to make these children, or rather Raoul,\nhappy.\"\n\n\"And I, too, as much as yourself, comte, wish to secure M. de\nBragelonne's happiness.\"\n\n\"I only await your majesty's signature. Raoul will have the honor of\npresenting himself before your majesty to receive your consent.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, comte,\" said the king, firmly; \"I have just said that\nI desire to secure M. de Bragelonne's happiness, and from the present\nmoment, therefore, I oppose his marriage.\"\n\n\"But, sire,\" exclaimed Athos, \"your majesty has promised!\"\n\n\"Not so, comte, I did not promise you, for it is opposed to my own\nviews.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your majesty's considerate and generous intentions on my\nbehalf; but I take the liberty of recalling to you that I undertook to\napproach you as an ambassador.\"\n\n\"An ambassador, comte, frequently asks, but does not always obtain what\nhe asks.\"\n\n\"But, sire, it will be such a blow for De Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"My hand shall deal the blow; I will speak to the vicomte.\"\n\n\"Love, sire, is overwhelming in its might.\"\n\n\"Love can be resisted, comte. I myself can assure you of that.\"\n\n\"When one has the soul of a king,--your own, for instance, sire.\"\n\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy on the subject. I have certain views for\nDe Bragelonne. I do not say that he shall not marry Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, but I do not wish him to marry so young; I do not wish him to\nmarry her until she has acquired a fortune; and he, on his side, no less\ndeserves favor, such as I wish to confer upon him. In a word, comte, I\nwish them to wait.\"\n\n\"Yet once more, sire.\"\n\n\"Comte, you told me you came here to request a favor.\"\n\n\"Assuredly, sire.\"\n\n\"Grant me one, then, instead; let us speak no longer upon this matter.\nIt is probable that, before long, war may be declared. I require men\nabout me who are unfettered. I should hesitate to send under fire a\nmarried man, or a father of a family. I should hesitate also, on De\nBragelonne's account, to endow with a fortune, without some sound reason\nfor it, a young girl, a perfect stranger; such an act would sow jealousy\namongst my nobility.\" Athos bowed, and remained silent.\n\n\"Is that all you wished to ask me?\" added Louis XIV.\n\n\"Absolutely all, sire; and I take my leave of your majesty. Is it,\nhowever, necessary that I should inform Raoul?\"\n\n\"Spare yourself the trouble and annoyance. Tell the vicomte that at my\n_levee_ to-morrow morning I will speak to him. I shall expect you this\nevening, comte, to join my card-table.\"\n\n\"I am in traveling-costume, sire.\"\n\n\"A day will come, I hope, when you will leave me no more. Before long,\ncomte, the monarchy will be established in such a manner as to enable me\nto offer a worthy hospitality to men of your merit.\"\n\n\"Provided, sire, a monarch reigns grandly in the hearts of his subjects,\nthe palace he inhabits matters little, since he is worshipped in\na temple.\" With these words Athos left the cabinet, and found De\nBragelonne, who was awaiting him anxiously.\n\n\"Well, monsieur?\" said the young man.\n\n\"The king, Raoul, is well intentioned towards us both; not, perhaps, in\nthe sense you suppose, but he is kind, and generously disposed to our\nhouse.\"\n\n\"You have bad news to communicate to me, monsieur,\" said the young man,\nturning very pale.\n\n\"The king himself will inform you to-morrow morning that it is not bad\nnews.\"\n\n\"The king has not signed, however?\"\n\n\"The king wishes himself to settle the terms of the contract, and he\ndesires to make it so grand that he requires time for consideration.\nThrow the blame rather on your own impatience, than on the king's good\nfeelings towards you.\"\n\nRaoul, in utter consternation, on account of his knowledge of the\ncount's frankness as well as his diplomacy, remained plunged in dull and\ngloomy stupor.\n\n\"Will you not go with me to my lodgings?\" said Athos.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I will follow you,\" he stammered out,\nfollowing Athos down the staircase.\n\n\"Since I am here,\" said Athos, suddenly, \"cannot I see M. d'Artagnan?\"\n\n\"Shall I show you his apartments?\" said De Bragelonne.\n\n\"Do so.\"\n\n\"They are on the opposite staircase.\"\n\nThey altered their course, but on reaching the landing of the grand\nstaircase, Raoul perceived a servant in the Comte de Guiche's livery,\nwho ran towards him as soon as he heard his voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Raoul.\n\n\"This note, monsieur. My master heard of your return and wrote to you\nwithout delay; I have been looking for you for the last half-hour.\"\n\nRaoul approached Athos as he unsealed the letter, saying, \"With your\npermission, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Dear Raoul,\" wrote the Comte de Guiche, \"I have an affair in hand which\nrequires immediate attention; I know you have returned; come to me as\nsoon as possible.\"\n\nHardly had he finished reading it, when a servant in the livery of the\nDuke of Buckingham, turning out of the gallery, recognized Raoul, and\napproached him respectfully, saying, \"From his Grace, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, Raoul, as I see you are already as busy as a general of an army,\nI shall leave you, and will find M. d'Artagnan myself.\"\n\n\"You will excuse me, I trust,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I excuse you; adieu, Raoul; you will find me at my apartments\nuntil to-morrow; during the day I may set out for Blois, unless I have\norders to the contrary.\"\n\n\"I shall present my respects to you to-morrow, monsieur.\"\n\nAs soon as Athos had left, Raoul opened Buckingham's letter.\n\n\"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" it ran, \"You are, of all the Frenchmen I\nhave known, the one with whom I am most pleased; I am about to put your\nfriendship to the proof. I have received a certain message, written\nin very good French. As I am an Englishman, I am afraid of not\ncomprehending it very clearly. The letter has a good name attached to\nit, and that is all I can tell you. Will you be good enough to come and\nsee me? for I am told you have arrived from Blois.\n\n\"Your devoted\n\n\"VILLIERS, Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\n\"I am going now to see your master,\" said Raoul to De Guiche's servant,\nas he dismissed him; \"and I shall be with the Duke of Buckingham in an\nhour,\" he added, dismissing with these words the duke's messenger.\n\n\n\nChapter XIX. Sword-Thrusts in the Water.\n\nRaoul, on betaking himself to De Guiche, found him conversing with De\nWardes and Manicamp. De Wardes, since the affair of the barricade,\nhad treated Raoul as a stranger; they behaved as if they were not\nacquainted. As Raoul entered, De Guiche walked up to him; and Raoul,\nas he grasped his friend's hand, glanced rapidly at his two companions,\nhoping to be able to read on their faces what was passing in their\nminds. De Wardes was cold and impenetrable; Manicamp seemed absorbed in\nthe contemplation of some trimming to his dress. De Guiche led Raoul\nto an adjoining cabinet, and made him sit down, saying, \"How well you\nlook!\"\n\n\"That is singular,\" replied Raoul, \"for I am far from being in good\nspirits.\"\n\n\"It is your case, then, Raoul, as it is my own,--our love affairs do not\nprogress.\"\n\n\"So much the better, count, as far as _you_ are concerned; the worst\nnews would be good news.\"\n\n\"In that case do not distress yourself, for, not only am I very unhappy,\nbut, what is more, I see others about me who are happy.\"\n\n\"Really, I do not understand you,\" replied Raoul; \"explain yourself.\"\n\n\"You will soon learn. I have tried, but in vain, to overcome the feeling\nyou saw dawn in me, increase, and take entire possession of me. I have\nsummoned all your advice and my own strength to my aid. I have well\nweighed the unfortunate affair in which I have embarked; I have sounded\nits depths; that it is an abyss, I am aware, but it matters little for\n_I_ shall pursue my own course.\"\n\n\"This is madness, De Guiche! you cannot advance another step without\nrisking your own ruin to-day, perhaps your life to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Whatever may happen, I have done with reflections; listen.\"\n\n\"And you hope to succeed; you believe that Madame will love you?\"\n\n\"Raoul, I believe nothing; I hope, because hope exists in man, and never\nabandons him until death.\"\n\n\"But, admitting that you obtain the happiness you covet, even then, you\nare more certainly lost than if you had failed in obtaining it.\"\n\n\"I beseech you, Raoul, not to interrupt me any more; you could never\nconvince me, for I tell you beforehand, I do not wish to be convinced; I\nhave gone so far I cannot recede; I have suffered so much, death itself\nwould be a boon. I no longer love to madness, Raoul, I am being engulfed\nby a whirlpool of jealousy.\"\n\nRaoul struck his hands together with an expression resembling anger.\n\"Well?\" said he.\n\n\"Well or ill matters little. This is what I claim from you, my friend,\nmy almost brother. During the last three days Madame has been living in\na perfect intoxication of gayety. On the first day, I dared not look\nat her; I hated her for not being as unhappy as myself. The next day I\ncould not bear her out of my sight; and she, Raoul--at least I thought\nI remarked it--she looked at me, if not with pity, at least with\ngentleness. But between her looks and mine, a shadow intervened;\nanother's smile invited hers. Beside her horse another's always gallops,\nwhich is not mine; in her ear another's caressing voice, not mine,\nunceasingly vibrates. Raoul, for three days past my brain has been on\nfire; flame, not blood, courses through my veins. That shadow must be\ndriven away, that smile must be quenched; that voice must be silenced.\"\n\n\"You wish Monsieur's death,\" exclaimed Raoul.\n\n\"No, no, I am not jealous of the husband; I am jealous of the lover.\"\n\n\"Of the lover?\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Have you not observed it, you who were formerly so keen-sighted?\"\n\n\"Are you jealous of the Duke of Buckingham?\"\n\n\"To the very death.\"\n\n\"Again jealous?\"\n\n\"This time the affair will be easy to arrange between us; I have taken\nthe initiative, and have sent him a letter.\"\n\n\"It was you, then, who wrote to him?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I know it, because he told me so. Look at this;\" and he handed De\nGuiche the letter he had received nearly at the same moment as his own.\nDe Guiche read it eagerly, and said, \"He is a brave man, and more than\nthat, a gallant man.\"\n\n\"Most certainly the duke is a gallant man; I need not ask if you wrote\nto him in a similar style.\"\n\n\"He will show you my letter when you call on him on my behalf.\"\n\n\"But that is almost out of the question.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"That I shall call on him for that purpose.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"The duke consults me as you do.\"\n\n\"I suppose you will give _me_ the preference! Listen to me, Raoul, I\nwish you to tell his Grace--it is a very simple matter--that to-day,\nto-morrow, the following day, or any other day he may choose, I will\nmeet him at Vincennes.\"\n\n\"Reflect, De Guiche.\"\n\n\"I thought I told you I have reflected.\"\n\n\"The duke is a stranger here; he is on a mission which renders his\nperson inviolable.... Vincennes is close to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"The consequences concern _me_.\"\n\n\"But the motive for this meeting? What motive do you wish me to assign?\"\n\n\"Be perfectly easy on that score, he will not ask any. The duke must be\nas sick of me as I am of him. I implore you, therefore, seek the duke,\nand if it is necessary to entreat him, to accept my offer, I will do\nso.\"\n\n\"That is useless. The duke has already informed me that he wishes to\nspeak to me. The duke is now playing cards with the king. Let us both go\nthere. I will draw him aside in the gallery; you will remain aloof. Two\nwords will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"That is well arranged. I will take De Wardes to keep me in\ncountenance.\"\n\n\"Why not Manicamp? De Wardes can join us at any time; we can leave him\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true.\"\n\n\"He knows nothing?\"\n\n\"Positively nothing. You continue still on an unfriendly footing, then?\"\n\n\"Has he not told you anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I do not like the man, and, as I _never_ liked him, the result is, that\nI am on no worse terms with him to-day than I was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Let us go, then.\"\n\nThe four descended the stairs. De Guiche's carriage was waiting at the\ndoor, and took them to the Palais Royal. As they were going along, Raoul\nwas engaged in devising his scheme of action. The sole depositary of two\nsecrets, he did not despair of concluding some arrangement between the\ntwo parties. He knew the influence he exercised over Buckingham, and\nthe ascendency he had acquired over De Guiche, and affairs did not look\nutterly hopeless. On their arrival in the gallery, dazzling with the\nblaze of light, where the most beautiful and illustrious women of the\ncourt moved to and fro, like stars in their own atmosphere, Raoul could\nnot prevent himself for a moment forgetting De Guiche in order to\nseek out Louise, who, amidst her companions, like a dove completely\nfascinated, gazed long and fixedly upon the royal circle, which\nglittered with jewels and gold. All its members were standing, the king\nalone being seated. Raoul perceived Buckingham, who was standing a few\npaces from Monsieur, in a group of French and English, who were admiring\nhis aristocratic carriage and the incomparable magnificence of his\ncostume. Some of the older courtiers remembered having seen his father,\nbut their recollections were not prejudicial to the son.\n\nBuckingham was conversing with Fouquet, who was talking with him aloud\nabout Belle-Isle. \"I cannot speak to him at present,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Wait, then, and choose your opportunity, but finish everything\nspeedily. I am on thorns.\"\n\n\"See, our deliverer approaches,\" said Raoul, perceiving D'Artagnan, who,\nmagnificently dressed in his new uniform of captain of the musketeers,\nhad just made his entry in the gallery; and he advanced towards\nD'Artagnan.\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere has been looking for you, chevalier,\" said Raoul.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I have just left him.\"\n\n\"I thought you would have passed a portion of the evening together.\"\n\n\"We have arranged to meet again.\"\n\nAs he answered Raoul, his absent looks were directed on all sides, as\nif seeking some one in the crowd or looking for something in the room.\nSuddenly his gaze became fixed, like that of an eagle on its prey. Raoul\nfollowed the direction of his glance, and noticed that De Guiche and\nD'Artagnan saluted each other, but he could not distinguish at whom the\ncaptain's lingering and haughty glance was aimed.\n\n\"Chevalier,\" said Raoul, \"there is no one here but yourself who can\nrender me a service.\"\n\n\"What is it, my dear vicomte?\"\n\n\"It is simply to go and interrupt the Duke of Buckingham, to whom I wish\nto say two words, and, as the duke is conversing with M. Fouquet, you\nunderstand that it would not do for _me_ to throw myself into the middle\nof the conversation.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah, is M. Fouquet there?\" inquired D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Do you not see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, now I do. But do you think I have a greater right than you have?\"\n\n\"You are a more important personage.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right; I am captain of the musketeers; I have had the post\npromised me so long, and have enjoyed it for so brief a period, that I\nam always forgetting my dignity.\"\n\n\"You will do me this service, will you not?\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet--the deuce!\"\n\n\"Are you not on good terms with him?\"\n\n\"It is rather he who may not be on good terms with me; however, since it\nmust be done some day or another--\"\n\n\"Stay; I think he is looking at you; or is it likely that it might be--\"\n\n\"No, no; don't deceive yourself, it is indeed me for whom this honor is\nintended.\"\n\n\"The opportunity is a good one, then?\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Pray go.\"\n\n\"Well, I will.\"\n\nDe Guiche had not removed his eyes from Raoul, who made a sign to him\nthat all was arranged. D'Artagnan walked straight up to the group, and\ncivilly saluted M. Fouquet as well as the others.\n\n\"Good evening, M. d'Artagnan; we were speaking of Belle-Isle,\" said\nFouquet, with that usage of society, and that perfect knowledge of the\nlanguage of looks, which require half a lifetime thoroughly to acquire,\nand which some persons, notwithstanding all their study, never attain.\n\n\"Of Belle-Ile-en-Mer! Ah!\" said D'Artagnan. \"It belongs to you, I\nbelieve, M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet has just told us that he had presented it to the king,\" said\nBuckingham.\n\n\"Do you know Belle-Isle, chevalier?\" inquired Fouquet.\n\n\"I have only been there once,\" replied D'Artagnan, with readiness and\ngood-humor.\n\n\"Did you remain there long?\"\n\n\"Scarcely a day.\"\n\n\"Did you see much of it while you were there?\"\n\n\"All that could be seen in a day.\"\n\n\"A great deal can be seen with observation as keen as yours,\" said\nFouquet; at which D'Artagnan bowed.\n\nDuring this Raoul made a sign to Buckingham. \"M. Fouquet,\" said\nBuckingham, \"I leave the captain with you, he is more learned than I\nam in bastions, scarps, and counter-scarps, and I will join one of my\nfriends, who has just beckoned me.\" Saying this, Buckingham disengaged\nhimself from the group, and advanced towards Raoul, stopping for a\nmoment at the table where the queen-mother, the young queen, and the\nking were playing together.\n\n\"Now, Raoul,\" said De Guiche, \"there he is; be firm and quick.\"\n\nBuckingham, having made some complimentary remark to Madame, continued\nhis way towards Raoul, who advanced to meet him, while De Guiche\nremained in his place, though he followed him with his eyes. The\nmaneuver was so arranged that the young men met in an open space which\nwas left vacant, between the groups of players and the gallery, where\nthey walked, stopping now and then for the purpose of saying a few words\nto some of the graver courtiers who were walking there. At the moment\nwhen the two lines were about to unite, they were broken by a third. It\nwas Monsieur who advanced towards the Duke of Buckingham. Monsieur had\nhis most engaging smile on his red and perfumed lips.\n\n\"My dear duke,\" said he, with the most affectionate politeness; \"is it\nreally true what I have just been told?\"\n\nBuckingham turned round; he had not noticed Monsieur approach; but had\nmerely heard his voice. He started in spite of his command over himself,\nand a slight pallor overspread his face. \"Monseigneur,\" he asked, \"what\nhas been told you that surprises you so much?\"\n\n\"That which throws me into despair, and will, in truth, be a real cause\nof mourning for the whole court.\"\n\n\"Your highness is very kind, for I perceive that you allude to my\ndeparture.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nGuiche had overheard the conversation from where he was standing, and\nstarted in his turn. \"His departure,\" he murmured. \"What does he say?\"\n\nPhilip continued with the same gracious air, \"I can easily conceive,\nmonsieur, why the king of Great Britain recalls you; we all know that\nKing Charles II., who appreciates true gentlemen, cannot dispense with\nyou. But it cannot be supposed we can let you go without great regret;\nand I beg you to receive the expression of my own.\"\n\n\"Believe me, monseigneur,\" said the duke, \"that if I quit the court of\nFrance--\"\n\n\"Because you are recalled; but, if you suppose the expression of my own\nwish on the subject might possibly have any influence with the king, I\nwill gladly volunteer to entreat his majesty Charles II. to leave you\nwith us a little while longer.\"\n\n\"I am overwhelmed, monseigneur, by so much kindness,\" replied\nBuckingham; \"but I have received positive commands. My residence in\nFrance was limited; I have prolonged it at the risk of displeasing my\ngracious sovereign. It is only this very day that I recollected I ought\nto have set off four days ago.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Monsieur.\n\n\"Yes; but,\" added Buckingham, raising his voice in such a manner that\nthe princess could hear him,--\"but I resemble that dweller in the East,\nwho turned mad, and remained so for several days, owing to a delightful\ndream that he had had, but who one day awoke, if not completely\ncured, in some respects rational at least. The court of France has its\nintoxicating properties, which are not unlike this dream, my lord; but\nat last I wake and leave it. I shall be unable, therefore, to prolong my\nresidence, as your highness has so kindly invited me to do.\"\n\n\"When do you leave?\" inquired Philip, with an expression full of\ninterest.\n\n\"To-morrow, monseigneur. My carriages have been ready for three days.\"\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans made a movement of the head, which seemed to\nsignify, \"Since you are determined, duke, there is nothing to be said.\"\nBuckingham returned the gesture, concealing under a smile a contraction\nof his heart; and then Monsieur moved away in the same direction by\nwhich he had approached. At the same moment, however, De Guiche advanced\nfrom the opposite direction. Raoul feared that the impatient young man\nmight possibly make the proposition himself, and hurried forth before\nhim.\n\n\"No, no, Raoul, all is useless now,\" said Guiche, holding both his hands\ntowards the duke, and leading him behind a column. \"Forgive me, duke,\nfor what I wrote to you, I was mad; give me back my letter.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the duke, \"you cannot owe me a grudge any longer\nnow.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, duke; my friendship, my lasting friendship is yours.\"\n\n\"There is certainly no reason why you should bear me any ill-will from\nthe moment I leave her never to see her again.\"\n\nRaoul heard these words, and comprehending that his presence was now\nuseless between the young men, who had now only friendly words to\nexchange, withdrew a few paces; a movement which brought him closer to\nDe Wardes, who was conversing with the Chevalier de Lorraine respecting\nthe departure of Buckingham. \"A strategic retreat,\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because the dear duke saves a sword-thrust by it.\" At which reply both\nlaughed.\n\nRaoul, indignant, turned round frowningly, flushed with anger and his\nlip curling with disdain. The Chevalier de Lorraine turned on his heel,\nbut De Wardes remained and waited.\n\n\"You will not break yourself of the habit,\" said Raoul to De Wardes, \"of\ninsulting the absent; yesterday it was M. d'Artagnan, to-day it is the\nDuke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"You know very well, monsieur,\" returned De Wardes, \"that I sometimes\ninsult those who are present.\"\n\nDe Wardes was close to Raoul, their shoulders met, their faces\napproached, as if to mutually inflame each other by the fire of their\nlooks and of their anger. It could be seen that the one was at the\nheight of fury, the other at the end of his patience. Suddenly a voice\nwas heard behind them full of grace and courtesy, saying, \"I believe I\nheard my name pronounced.\"\n\nThey turned round and saw D'Artagnan, who, with a smiling eye and a\ncheerful face, had just placed his hand on De Wardes's shoulder. Raoul\nstepped back to make room for the musketeer. De Wardes trembled from\nhead to foot, turned pale, but did not move. D'Artagnan, still with the\nsame smile, took the place which Raoul had abandoned to him.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear Raoul,\" he said. \"M. de Wardes, I wish to talk with\nyou. Do not leave us, Raoul; every one can hear what I have to say to M.\nde Wardes.\" His smile immediately faded away, and his glace became cold\nand sharp as a sword.\n\n\"I am at your orders, monsieur,\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"For a very long time,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"I have sought an\nopportunity of conversing with you; to-day is the first time I have\nfound it. The place is badly chosen, I admit, but you will perhaps\nhave the goodness to accompany me to my apartments, which are on the\nstaircase at the end of this gallery.\"\n\n\"I follow you, monsieur,\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"Are you alone here?\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"No; I have M. Manicamp and M. de Guiche, two of my friends.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said D'Artagnan; \"but two persons are not sufficient; you\nwill be able to find a few others, I trust.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the young man, who did not know what object D'Artagnan\nhad in view. \"As many as you please.\"\n\n\"Are they friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Real friends?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Very well, get a good supply, then. Do you come, too, Raoul; bring M.\nde Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"What a disturbance,\" replied De Wardes, attempting to smile. The\ncaptain slightly signed to him with his hand, as though to recommend him\nto be patient, and then led the way to his apartments. [2]\n\n\n\nChapter XX. Sword-Thrusts in the Water (concluded).\n\nD'Artagnan's apartment was not unoccupied; for the Comte de la Fere,\nseated in the recess of a window, awaited him. \"Well,\" said he to\nD'Artagnan, as he saw him enter.\n\n\"Well,\" said the latter, \"M. de Wardes has done me the honor to pay me a\nvisit, in company with some of his own friends, as well as of ours.\" In\nfact, behind the musketeer appeared De Wardes and Manicamp, followed\nby De Guiche and Buckingham, who looked surprised, not knowing what was\nexpected of them. Raoul was accompanied by two or three gentlemen; and,\nas he entered, glanced round the room, and perceiving the count, he went\nand placed himself by his side. D'Artagnan received his visitors\nwith all the courtesy he was capable of; he preserved his unmoved and\nunconcerned look. All the persons present were men of distinction,\noccupying posts of honor and credit at the court. After he had\napologized to each of them for any inconvenience he might have put\nthem to, he turned towards De Wardes, who, in spite of his customary\nself-command, could not prevent his face betraying some surprise mingled\nwith not a little uneasiness.\n\n\"Now, monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, \"since we are no longer within the\nprecincts of the king's palace, and since we can speak out without\nfailing in respect to propriety, I will inform you why I have taken the\nliberty to request you to visit me here, and why I have invited these\ngentlemen to be present at the same time. My friend, the Comte de la\nFere, has acquainted me with the injurious reports you are spreading\nabout myself. You have stated that you regard me as your mortal enemy,\nbecause I was, so you affirm, that of your father.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, monsieur, I have said so,\" replied De Wardes, whose\npallid face became slightly tinged with color.\n\n\"You accuse me, therefore, of a crime, or a fault, or of some mean\nand cowardly act. Have the goodness to state your charge against me in\nprecise terms.\"\n\n\"In the presence of witnesses?\"\n\n\"Most certainly in the presence of witnesses; and you see I have\nselected them as being experienced in affairs of honor.\"\n\n\"You do not appreciate my delicacy, monsieur. I have accused you, it is\ntrue; but I have kept the nature of the accusation a perfect secret.\nI entered into no details; but have rested satisfied by expressing my\nhatred in the presence of those on whom a duty was almost imposed to\nacquaint you with it. You have not taken the discreetness I have shown\ninto consideration, although you were interested in remaining silent. I\ncan hardly recognize your habitual prudence in that, M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\nD'Artagnan, who was quietly biting the corner of his moustache, said,\n\"I have already had the honor to beg you to state the particulars of the\ngrievances you say you have against me.\"\n\n\"Aloud?\"\n\n\"Certainly, aloud.\"\n\n\"In that case, I will speak.\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur,\" said D'Artagnan, bowing; \"we are all listening to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur, it is not a question of a personal injury towards\nmyself, but one towards my father.\"\n\n\"That you have already stated.\"\n\n\"Yes; but there are certain subjects which are only approached with\nhesitation.\"\n\n\"If that hesitation, in your case, really does exist, I entreat you to\novercome it.\"\n\n\"Even if it refer to a disgraceful action?\"\n\n\"Yes; in every and any case.\"\n\nThose who were present at this scene had, at first, looked at each other\nwith a good deal of uneasiness. They were reassured, however, when they\nsaw that D'Artagnan manifested no emotion whatever.\n\nDe Wardes still maintained the same unbroken silence. \"Speak, monsieur,\"\nsaid the musketeer; \"you see you are keeping us waiting.\"\n\n\"Listen, then:--My father loved a lady of noble birth, and this lady\nloved my father.\" D'Artagnan and Athos exchanged looks. De Wardes\ncontinued: \"M. d'Artagnan found some letters which indicated a\nrendezvous, substituted himself, under disguise, for the person who was\nexpected, and took advantage of the darkness.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly true,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\nA slight murmur was heard from those present. \"Yes, I was guilty of that\ndishonorable action. You should have added, monsieur, since you are so\nimpartial, that, at the period when the circumstance which you have just\nrelated happened, I was not one-and-twenty years of age.\"\n\nA renewed murmur was heard, but this time of astonishment, and almost of\ndoubt.\n\n\"It was a most shameful deception, I admit,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and I\nhave not waited for M. de Wardes's reproaches to reproach myself for it,\nand very bitterly, too. Age has, however, made me more reasonable, and,\nabove all, more upright; and this injury has been atoned for by a long\nand lasting regret. But I appeal to you, gentlemen; this affair took\nplace in 1626, at a period, happily for yourselves, known to you by\ntradition only, at a period when love was not over-scrupulous,\nwhen consciences did not distill, as in the present day, poison and\nbitterness. We were young soldiers, always fighting, or being attacked,\nour swords always in our hands, or at least ready to be drawn from their\nsheaths. Death then always stared us in the face, war hardened us, and\nthe cardinal pressed us sorely. I have repented of it, and more than\nthat--I still repent it, M. de Wardes.\"\n\n\"I can well understand that, monsieur, for the action itself needed\nrepentance; but you were not the less the cause of that lady's disgrace.\nShe, of whom you have been speaking, covered with shame, borne down by\nthe affront you brought upon her, fled, quitted France, and no one ever\nknew what became of her.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said the Comte de la Fere, stretching his hand towards De\nWardes, with a peculiar smile upon his face, \"you are mistaken; she was\nseen; and there are persons even now present, who, having often heard\nher spoken of, will easily recognize her by the description I am about\nto give. She was about five-and-twenty years of age, slender in form, of\na pale complexion, and fair-haired; she was married in England.\"\n\n\"Married?\" exclaimed De Wardes.\n\n\"So, you were not aware she was married? You see we are far better\ninformed than yourself. Do you happen to know she was usually styled 'My\nLady,' without the addition of any name to that description?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" murmured Buckingham.\n\n\"Very well, monsieur. That woman, who came from England, returned to\nEngland after having thrice attempted M. d'Artagnan's life. That was but\njust, you will say, since M. d'Artagnan had insulted her. But that which\nwas not just was, that, when in England, this woman, by her seductions,\ncompletely enslaved a young man in the service of Lord de Winter, by\nname Felton. You change color, my lord,\" said Athos, turning to the Duke\nof Buckingham, \"and your eyes kindle with anger and sorrow. Let your\nGrace finish the recital, then, and tell M. de Wardes who this woman was\nwho placed the knife in the hand of your father's murderer.\"\n\nA cry escaped from the lips of all present. The young duke passed his\nhandkerchief across his forehead, which was covered with perspiration. A\ndead silence ensued among the spectators.\n\n\"You see, M. de Wardes,\" said D'Artagnan, whom this recital had\nimpressed more and more, as his own recollection revived as Athos spoke,\n\"you see that my crime did not cause the destruction of any one's soul,\nand that the soul in question may fairly be considered to have been\naltogether lost before my regret. It is, however, an act of conscience\non my part. Now this matter is settled, therefore, it remains for me\nto ask, with the greatest humility, your forgiveness for this shameless\naction, as most certainly I should have asked it of your father, if\nhe were still alive, and if I had met him after my return to France,\nsubsequent to the death of King Charles I.\"\n\n\"That is too much, M. d'Artagnan,\" exclaimed many voices, with\nanimation.\n\n\"No, gentlemen,\" said the captain. \"And now, M. de Wardes, I hope all is\nfinished between us, and that you will have no further occasion to speak\nill of me again. Do you consider it completely settled?\"\n\nDe Wardes bowed, and muttered to himself inarticulately.\n\n\"I trust also,\" said D'Artagnan, approaching the young man closely,\n\"that you will no longer speak ill of any one, as it seems you have the\nunfortunate habit of doing; for a man so puritanically conscientious\nas you are, who can reproach an old soldier for a youthful freak\nfive-and-thirty years after it happened, will allow me to ask whether\nyou, who advocate such excessive purity of conscience, will undertake on\nyour side to do nothing contrary either to conscience or the principle\nof honor. And now, listen attentively to what I am going to say, M. de\nWardes, in conclusion. Take care that no tale, with which your name may\nbe associated, reaches my ear.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said De Wardes, \"it is useless threatening to no purpose.\"\n\n\"I have not yet finished, M. de Wardes, and you must listen to me still\nfurther.\" The circle of listeners, full of eager curiosity, drew closer.\n\"You spoke just now of the honor of a woman, and of the honor of\nyour father. We were glad to hear you speak in that manner; for it is\npleasing to think that such a sentiment of delicacy and rectitude, and\nwhich did not exist, it seems, in _our_ minds, lives in our children;\nand it is delightful, too, to see a young man, at an age when men from\nhabit become the destroyers of the honor of women, respect and defend\nit.\"\n\nDe Wardes bit his lip and clenched his hands, evidently much disturbed\nto learn how this discourse, the commencement of which was announced in\nso threatening a manner, would terminate.\n\n\"How did it happen, then, that you allowed yourself to say to M. de\nBragelonne that he did not know who his mother was?\"\n\nRaoul's eyes flashed, as, darting forward, he exclaimed,--\"Chevalier,\nthis is a personal affair of my own!\" At which exclamation, a smile,\nfull of malice, passed across De Wardes's face.\n\nD'Artagnan put Raoul aside, saying,--\"Do not interrupt me, young man.\"\nAnd looking at De Wardes in an authoritative manner, he continued:--\"I\nam now dealing with a matter which cannot be settled by means of the\nsword. I discuss it before men of honor, all of whom have more than once\nhad their swords in their hands in affairs of honor. I selected them\nexpressly. These gentlemen well know that every secret for which men\nfight ceases to be a secret. I again put my question to M. de Wardes.\nWhat was the subject of conversation when you offended this young man,\nin offending his father and mother at the same time?\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" returned De Wardes, \"that liberty of speech is\nallowed, when it is supported by every means which a man of courage has\nat his disposal.\"\n\n\"Tell me what the means are by which a man of courage can sustain a\nslanderous expression.\"\n\n\"The sword.\"\n\n\"You fail, not only in logic, in your argument, but in religion and\nhonor. You expose the lives of many others, without referring to your\nown, which seems to be full of hazard. Besides, fashions pass away,\nmonsieur, and the fashion of duelling has passed away, without referring\nin any way to the edicts of his majesty which forbid it. Therefore, in\norder to be consistent with your own chivalrous notions, you will at\nonce apologize to M. de Bragelonne; you will tell him how much you\nregret having spoken so lightly, and that the nobility and purity of\nhis race are inscribed, not in his heart alone, but still more in every\naction of his life. You will do and say this, M. de Wardes, as I, an old\nofficer, did and said just now to your boy's moustache.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\" inquired De Wardes.\n\n\"In that case the result will be--\"\n\n\"That which you think you will prevent,\" said De Wardes, laughing; \"the\nresult will be that your conciliatory address will end in a violation of\nthe king's prohibition.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said the captain, \"you are quite mistaken.\"\n\n\"What will be the result, then?\"\n\n\"The result will be that I shall go to the king, with whom I am on\ntolerably good terms, to whom I have been happy enough to render certain\nservices, dating from a period when you were not born, and who, at\nmy request, has just sent me an order in blank for M. Baisemeaux de\nMontlezun, governor of the Bastile; and I shall say to the king: 'Sire,\na man has in a most cowardly way insulted M. de Bragelonne by insulting\nhis mother; I have written this man's name upon the _lettre de cachet_\nwhich your majesty has been kind enough to give me, so that M. de Wardes\nis in the Bastile for three years.\" And D'Artagnan, drawing the order\nsigned by the king from his pocket, held it towards De Wardes.\n\nRemarking that the young man was not quite convinced, and received\nthe warning as an idle threat, he shrugged his shoulders and walked\nleisurely towards the table, upon which lay a writing-case and a pen,\nthe length of which would have terrified the topographical Porthos. De\nWardes then saw that nothing could well be more seriously intended\nthan the threat in question, for the Bastile, even at that period, was\nalready held in dread. He advanced a step towards Raoul, and, in an\nalmost unintelligible voice, said,--\"I offer my apologies in the terms\nwhich M. d'Artagnan just now dictated, and which I am forced to make to\nyou.\"\n\n\"One moment, monsieur,\" said the musketeer, with the greatest\ntranquillity, \"you mistake the terms of the apology. I did not say, 'and\nwhich I am forced to make'; I said, 'and which my conscience induces me\nto make.' This latter expression, believe me, is better than the former;\nand it will be far preferable, since it will be the most truthful\nexpression of your own sentiments.\"\n\n\"I subscribe to it,\" said De Wardes; \"but submit, gentlemen, that a\nthrust of the sword through the body, as was the custom formerly, was\nfar better than tyranny like this.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied Buckingham; \"for the sword-thrust, when\nreceived, was no indication that a particular person was right or wrong;\nit only showed that he was more or less skillful in the use of the\nweapon.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\" exclaimed De Wardes.\n\n\"There, now,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"you are going to say something\nvery rude, and I am rendering a service by stopping you in time.\"\n\n\"Is that all, monsieur?\" inquired De Wardes.\n\n\"Absolutely everything,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"and these gentlemen, as\nwell as myself, are quite satisfied with you.\"\n\n\"Believe me, monsieur, that your reconciliations are not successful.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Because, as we are now about to separate, I would wager that M. de\nBragelonne and myself are greater enemies than ever.\"\n\n\"You are deceived, monsieur, as far as I am concerned,\" returned Raoul;\n\"for I do not retain the slightest animosity in my heart against you.\"\n\nThis last blow overwhelmed De Wardes. He cast his eyes around him like\na man bewildered. D'Artagnan saluted most courteously the gentlemen who\nhad been present at the explanation; and every one, on leaving the room,\nshook hands with him; but not one hand was held out towards De Wardes.\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the young man, \"can I not find some one on whom to wreak\nmy vengeance?\"\n\n\"You can, monsieur, for I am here,\" whispered a voice full of menace in\nhis ear.\n\nDe Wardes turned round, and saw the Duke of Buckingham, who, having\nprobably remained behind with that intention, had just approached him.\n\"You, monsieur?\" exclaimed De Wardes.\n\n\"Yes, I! I am no subject of the king of France; I am not going to remain\non the territory, since I am about setting off for England. I have\naccumulated in my heart such a mass of despair and rage, that I, too,\nlike yourself, need to revenge myself upon some one. I approve M.\nd'Artagnan's principles profoundly, but I am not bound to apply them\nto you. I am an Englishman, and, in my turn, I propose to you what you\nproposed to others to no purpose. Since you, therefore, are so terribly\nincensed, take me as a remedy. In thirty-four hours' time I shall be at\nCalais. Come with me; the journey will appear shorter if together, than\nif alone. We will fight, when we get there, upon the sands which are\ncovered by the rising tide, and which form part of the French territory\nduring six hours of the day, but belong to the territory of Heaven\nduring the other six.\"\n\n\"I accept willingly,\" said De Wardes.\n\n\"I assure you,\" said the duke, \"that if you kill me, you will be\nrendering me an infinite service.\"\n\n\"I will do my utmost to make myself agreeable to you, duke,\" said De\nWardes.\n\n\"It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?\"\n\n\"I shall be at your commands. I needed some real danger and some mortal\nrisk to run, to tranquilize me.\"\n\n\"In that case, I think you have met with what you are looking for.\nFarewell, M. de Wardes; to-morrow morning, my valet will tell you the\nexact hour of our departure; we can travel together like two excellent\nfriends. I generally travel as fast as I can. Adieu.\"\n\nBuckingham saluted De Wardes, and returned towards the king's\napartments; De Wardes, irritated beyond measure, left the Palais Royal,\nand hurried through the streets homeward to the house where he lodged.\n\n\n\nChapter XXI. Baisemeaux de Montlezun.\n\nAfter the austere lesson administered to De Wardes, Athos and D'Artagnan\ntogether descended the staircase which led to the courtyard of the\nPalais Royal. \"You perceive,\" said Athos to D'Artagnan, \"that Raoul\ncannot, sooner or later, avoid a duel with De Wardes, for De Wardes is\nas brave as he is vicious and wicked.\"\n\n\"I know such fellows well,\" replied D'Artagnan; \"I had an affair with\nthe father. I assure you that, although at that time I had good muscles\nand a sort of brute courage--I assure you that the father did me some\nmischief. But you should have seen how I fought it out with him. Ah,\nAthos, such encounters never take place in these times! I had a hand\nwhich could never remain at rest, a hand like quicksilver,--you knew\nits quality, for you have seen me at work. My sword was no longer than\na piece of steel; it was a serpent that assumed every form and every\nlength, seeking where it might thrust its head; in other words, where it\nmight fix its bite. I advanced half a dozen paces, then three, and then,\nbody to body, I pressed my antagonist closely, then I darted back again\nten paces. No human power could resist that ferocious ardor. Well,\nDe Wardes the father, with the bravery of his race, with his dogged\ncourage, occupied a good deal of my time; and my fingers, at the end of\nthe engagement, were, I well remember, tired enough.\"\n\n\"It is, then, as I said,\" resumed Athos, \"the son will always be looking\nout for Raoul, and will end by meeting him; and Raoul can easily be\nfound when he is sought for.\"\n\n\"Agreed; but Raoul calculates well; he bears no grudge against De\nWardes,--he has said so; he will wait until he is provoked, and in that\ncase his position is a good one. The king will not be able to get out\nof temper about the matter; besides we shall know how to pacify his\nmajesty. But why so full of these fears and anxieties? You don't easily\nget alarmed.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what makes me anxious; Raoul is to see the king\nto-morrow, when his majesty will inform him of his wishes respecting a\ncertain marriage. Raoul, loving as he does, will get out of temper, and\nonce in an angry mood, if he were to meet De Wardes, the shell would\nexplode.\"\n\n\"We will prevent the explosion.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Athos, \"for I must return to Blois. All this gilded\nelegance of the court, all these intrigues, sicken me. I am no longer a\nyoung man who can make terms with the meanness of the day. I have read\nin the Great Book many things too beautiful and too comprehensive to\nlonger take any interest in the trifling phrases which these men whisper\namong themselves when they wish to deceive others. In one word, I am\nweary of Paris wherever and whenever you are not with me; and as I\ncannot have you with me always, I wish to return to Blois.\"\n\n\"How wrong you are, Athos; how you gainsay your origin and the destiny\nof your noble nature. Men of your stamp are created to continue, to the\nvery last moment, in full possession of their great faculties. Look at\nmy sword, a Spanish blade, the one I wore at La Rochelle; it served me\nfor thirty years without fail; one day in the winter it fell upon the\nmarble floor on the Louvre and was broken. I had a hunting-knife made of\nit which will last a hundred years yet. You, Athos, with your loyalty,\nyour frankness, your cool courage, and your sound information, are\nthe very man kings need to warn and direct them. Remain here; Monsieur\nFouquet will not last as long as my Spanish blade.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said Athos, smiling, \"that my friend, D'Artagnan, who,\nafter having raised me to the skies, making me an object of worship,\ncasts me down from the top of Olympus, and hurls me to the ground?\nI have more exalted ambition, D'Artagnan. To be a minister--to be a\nslave,--never! Am I not still greater? I am nothing. I remember having\nheard you occasionally call me 'the great Athos'; I defy you, therefore,\nif I were minister, to continue to bestow that title upon me. No, no; I\ndo not yield myself in this manner.\"\n\n\"We will not speak of it any more, then; renounce everything, even the\nbrotherly feeling which unites us.\"\n\n\"It is almost cruel what you say.\"\n\nD'Artagnan pressed Athos's hand warmly. \"No, no; renounce everything\nwithout fear. Raoul can get on without you. I am at Paris.\"\n\n\"In that case I shall return to Blois. We will take leave of each other\nto-night; to-morrow at daybreak I shall be on my horse again.\"\n\n\"You cannot return to your hotel alone; why did you not bring Grimaud\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Grimaud takes his rest now; he goes to bed early, for my poor old\nservant gets easily fatigued. He came from Blois with me, and I\ncompelled him to remain within doors; for if, in retracing the forty\nleagues which separate us from Blois, he needed to draw breath even, he\nwould die without a murmur. But I don't want to lose Grimaud.\"\n\n\"You shall have one of my musketeers to carry a torch for you. _Hola!_\nsome one there,\" called out D'Artagnan, leaning over the gilded\nbalustrade. The heads of seven or eight musketeers appeared. \"I wish\nsome gentleman, who is so disposed, to escort the Comte de la Fere,\"\ncried D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Thank you for your readiness, gentlemen,\" said Athos; \"I regret to have\noccasion to trouble you in this manner.\"\n\n\"I would willingly escort the Comte de la Fere,\" said some one, \"if I\nhad not to speak to Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" said D'Artagnan, looking into the darkness.\n\n\"I, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Heaven forgive me, if that is not Monsieur Baisemeaux's voice.\"\n\n\"It is, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What are you doing in the courtyard, my dear Baisemeaux?\"\n\n\"I am waiting your orders, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"Wretch that I am,\" thought D'Artagnan; \"true, you have been told,\nI suppose, that some one was to be arrested, and have come yourself,\ninstead of sending an officer?\"\n\n\"I came because I had occasion to speak to you.\"\n\n\"You did not send to me?\"\n\n\"I waited until you were disengaged,\" said Monsieur Baisemeaux, timidly.\n\n\"I leave you, D'Artagnan,\" said Athos.\n\n\"Not before I have present Monsieur Baisemeaux de Montlezun, the\ngovernor of the Bastile.\"\n\nBaisemeaux and Athos saluted each other.\n\n\"Surely you must know each other,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"I have an indistinct recollection of Monsieur Baisemeaux,\" said Athos.\n\n\"You remember, my dear, Baisemeaux, the king's guardsman with whom we\nused formerly to have such delightful meetings in the cardinal's time?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Athos, taking leave of him with affability.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, whose _nom de guerre_ was Athos,\"\nwhispered D'Artagnan to Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Yes, yes, a brave man, one of the celebrated four.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. But, my dear Baisemeaux, shall we talk now?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"In the first place, as for the orders--there are none. The king does\nnot intend to arrest the person in question.\n\n\"So much the worse,\" said Baisemeaux with a sigh.\n\n\"What do you mean by so much the worse?\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, laughing.\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" returned the governor, \"my prisoners are my income.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I did not see it in that light.\"\n\n\"And so there are no orders,\" repeated Baisemeaux with a sigh. \"What\nan admirable situation yours is, captain,\" he continued, after a pause;\n\"captain-lieutenant of the musketeers.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is good enough; but I don't see why you should envy me; you,\ngovernor of the Bastile, the first castle in France.\"\n\n\"I am well aware of that,\" said Baisemeaux, in a sorrowful tone of\nvoice.\n\n\"You say that like a man confessing his sins. I would willingly exchange\nmy profits for yours.\"\n\n\"Don't speak of profits to me, if you wish to save me the bitterest\nanguish of mind.\"\n\n\"Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were\nafraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest\nothers?\"\n\n\"I was looking to see whether any one could see or listen to us; it\nwould be safer to confer more in private, if you would grant me such a\nfavor.\"\n\n\"Baisemeaux, you seem to forget we are acquaintances of five and thirty\nyears' standing. Don't assume such sanctified airs; make yourself quite\ncomfortable; I don't eat governors of the Bastile raw.\"\n\n\"Heaven be praised!\"\n\n\"Come into the courtyard with me; it's a beautiful moonlit night; we\nwill walk up and down, arm in arm, under the trees, while you tell me\nyour pitiful tale.\" He drew the doleful governor into the courtyard,\ntook him by the arm as he had said, and, in his rough, good-humored way,\ncried: \"Out with it, rattle away, Baisemeaux; what have you got to say?\"\n\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\n\"You prefer your own lamentations, then; my opinion is, it will be\nlonger than ever. I'll wager you are making fifty thousand francs out of\nyour pigeons in the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Would to heaven that were the case, M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"You surprise me, Baisemeaux; just look at you, acting the anchorite.\nI should like to show you your face in a glass, and you would see how\nplump and florid-looking you are, as fat and round as a cheese, with\neyes like lighted coals; and if it were not for that ugly wrinkle you\ntry to cultivate on your forehead, you would hardly look fifty years\nold, and you are sixty, if I am not mistaken.\"\n\n\"All quite true.\"\n\n\"Of course I knew it was true, as true as the fifty thousand francs\nprofit you make;\" at which remark Baisemeaux stamped on the ground.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I will add up your accounts for you: you\nwere captain of M. Mazarin's guards; and twelve thousand francs a year\nwould in twelve years amount to one hundred and forty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Twelve thousand francs! Are you mad?\" cried Baisemeaux; \"the old miser\ngave me no more than six thousand, and the expenses of the post amounted\nto six thousand five hundred francs. M. Colbert, who deducted the other\nsix thousand francs, condescended to allow me to take fifty thousand\nfrancs as a gratification; so that, if it were not for my little estate\nat Montlezun, which brings me in twelve thousand francs a year, I could\nnot have met my engagements.\"\n\n\"Well, then, how about the fifty thousand francs from the Bastile?\nThere, I trust, you are boarded and lodged, and get your six thousand\nfrancs salary besides.\"\n\n\"Admitted!\"\n\n\"Whether the year be good or bad, there are fifty prisoners, who, on the\naverage, bring you in a thousand francs a year each.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n\n\"Well, there is at once an income of fifty thousand francs; you have\nheld the post three years, and must have received in that time one\nhundred and fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"You forget one circumstance, dear M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That while you received your appointment as captain from the king\nhimself, I received mine as governor from Messieurs Tremblay and\nLouviere.\"\n\n\"Quite right, and Tremblay was not a man to let you have the post for\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Nor Louviere either: the result was, that I gave seventy-five thousand\nfrancs to Tremblay as his share.\"\n\n\"Very agreeable that! and to Louviere?\"\n\n\"The very same.\"\n\n\"Money down?\"\n\n\"No: that would have been impossible. The king did not wish, or rather\nM. Mazarin did not wish, to have the appearance of removing those\ntwo gentlemen, who had sprung from the barricades; he permitted them,\ntherefore, to make certain extravagant conditions for their retirement.\"\n\n\"What were those conditions?\"\n\n\"Tremble... three years' income for the good-will.\"\n\n\"The deuce! so that the one hundred and fifty thousand francs have\npassed into their hands.\"\n\n\"Precisely so.\"\n\n\"And beyond that?\"\n\n\"A sum of one hundred and fifty thousand francs, or fifteen thousand\npistoles, whichever you please, in three payments.\"\n\n\"Exorbitant.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is not all.\"\n\n\"What besides?\"\n\n\"In default of the fulfillment by me of any one of those conditions,\nthose gentlemen enter upon their functions again. The king has been\ninduced to sign that.\"\n\n\"It is monstrous, incredible!\"\n\n\"Such is the fact, however.\"\n\n\"I do indeed pity you, Baisemeaux. But why, in the name of fortune, did\nM. Mazarin grant you this pretended favor? It would have been far better\nto have refused you altogether.\"\n\n\"Certainly, but he was strongly persuaded to do so by my protector.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"One of your own friends, indeed; M. d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"M. d'Herblay! Aramis!\"\n\n\"Just so; he has been very kind towards me.\"\n\n\"Kind! to make you enter into such a bargain!\"\n\n\"Listen! I wished to leave the cardinal's service. M. d'Herblay spoke on\nmy behalf to Louviere and Tremblay--they objected; I wished to have the\nappointment very much, for I knew what it could be made to produce;\nin my distress I confided in M. d'Herblay, and he offered to become my\nsurety for the different payments.\"\n\n\"You astound me! Aramis became your surety?\"\n\n\"Like a man of honor; he procured the signature; Tremblay and Louviere\nresigned their appointments; I have paid every year twenty-five thousand\nfrancs to these two gentlemen; on the thirty-first of May, every year,\nM. d'Herblay himself comes to the Bastile, and brings me five thousand\npistoles to distribute between my crocodiles.\"\n\n\"You owe Aramis one hundred and fifty thousand francs, then?\"\n\n\"That is the very thing which is the cause of my despair, for I only owe\nhim one hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand you.\"\n\n\"He came and settled with the vampires only two years. To-day, however,\nis the thirty-first of May, and he has not been yet, and to-morrow, at\nmidday, the payment falls due; if, therefore, I don't pay to-morrow,\nthose gentlemen can, by the terms of the contract, break off the\nbargain; I shall be stripped of everything; I shall have worked for\nthree years, and given two hundred and fifty thousand francs for\nnothing, absolutely for nothing at all, dear M. d'Artagnan.\"\n\n\"This is very strange,\" murmured D'Artagnan.\n\n\"You can now imagine that I may well have wrinkles on my forehead, can\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\"\n\n\"And you can imagine, too, that notwithstanding I may be as round as a\ncheese, with a complexion like an apple, and my eyes like coals on fire,\nI may almost be afraid that I shall not have a cheese or an apple left\nme to eat, and that my eyes will be left me only to weep with.\"\n\n\"It is really a very grievous affair.\"\n\n\"I have come to you, M. d'Artagnan, for you are the only man who can get\nme out of my trouble.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"You are acquainted with the Abbe d'Herblay, and you know that he is a\nsomewhat mysterious gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, you can, perhaps, give me the address of his presbytery, for I\nhave been to Noisy-le-Sec, and he is no longer there.\"\n\n\"I should think not, indeed. He is Bishop of Vannes.\"\n\n\"What! Vannes in Bretagne?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe little man began to tear his hair, saying, \"How can I get to Vannes\nfrom here by midday to-morrow? I am a lost man.\"\n\n\"Your despair quite distresses me.\"\n\n\"Vannes, Vannes!\" cried Baisemeaux.\n\n\"But listen; a bishop is not always a resident. M. d'Herblay may not\npossibly be so far away as you fear.\"\n\n\"Pray tell me his address.\"\n\n\"I really don't know it.\"\n\n\"In that case I am lost. I will go and throw myself at the king's feet.\"\n\n\"But, Baisemeaux, I can hardly believe what you tell me; besides, since\nthe Bastile is capable of producing fifty thousand francs a year, why\nhave you not tried to screw one hundred thousand out of it?\"\n\n\"Because I am an honest man, M. d'Artagnan, and because my prisoners are\nfed like ambassadors.\"\n\n\"Well, you're in a fair way to get out of your difficulties; give\nyourself a good attack of indigestion with your excellent living, and\nput yourself out of the way between this and midday to-morrow.\"\n\n\"How can you be hard-hearted enough to laugh?\"\n\n\"Nay, you really afflict me. Come, Baisemeaux, if you can pledge me your\nword of honor, do so, that you will not open your lips to any one about\nwhat I am going to say to you.\"\n\n\"Never, never!\"\n\n\"You wish to put your hands on Aramis?\"\n\n\"At any cost!\"\n\n\"Well, go and see where M. Fouquet is.\"\n\n\"Why, what connection can there be--\"\n\n\"How stupid you are! Don't you know that Vannes is in the diocese of\nBelle-Isle, or Belle-Isle in the diocese of Vannes? Belle-Isle belongs\nto M. Fouquet, and M. Fouquet nominated M. d'Herblay to that bishopric!\"\n\n\"I see, I see; you restore me to life again.\"\n\n\"So much the better. Go and tell M. Fouquet very simply that you wish to\nspeak to M. d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" exclaimed Baisemeaux, delightedly.\n\n\"But,\" said D'Artagnan, checking him by a severe look, \"your word of\nhonor?\"\n\n\"I give you my sacred word of honor,\" replied the little man, about to\nset off running.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To M. Fouquet's house.\"\n\n\"It is useless doing that; M. Fouquet is playing at cards with the king.\nAll you can do is to pay M. Fouquet a visit early to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I will do so. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Good luck attend you,\" said D'Artagnan.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"This is a strange affair,\" murmured D'Artagnan, as he slowly ascended\nthe staircase after he had left Baisemeaux. \"What possible interest can\nAramis have in obliging Baisemeaux in this manner? Well, I suppose we\nshall learn some day or another.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXII. The King's Card-Table.\n\nFouquet was present, as D'Artagnan had said, at the king's card-table.\nIt seemed as if Buckingham's departure had shed a balm on the lacerated\nhearts of the previous evening. Monsieur, radiant with delight, made a\nthousand affectionate signs to his mother. The Count de Guiche could not\nseparate himself from Buckingham, and while playing, conversed with him\nupon the circumstance of his projected voyage. Buckingham, thoughtful,\nand kind in his manner, like a man who has adopted a resolution,\nlistened to the count, and from time to time cast a look full of regret\nand hopeless affection at Madame. The princess, in the midst of her\nelation of spirits, divided her attention between the king, who was\nplaying with her, Monsieur, who quietly joked her about her enormous\nwinnings, and De Guiche, who exhibited an extravagant delight. Of\nBuckingham she took but little notice; for her, this fugitive, this\nexile, was now simply a remembrance, no longer a man. Light hearts are\nthus constituted; while they themselves continue untouched, they roughly\nbreak off with every one who may possibly interfere with their little\ncalculations of self comfort. Madame had received Buckingham's smiles\nand attentions and sighs while he was present; but what was the good\nof sighing, smiling, and kneeling at a distance? Can one tell in what\ndirection the winds in the Channel, which toss mighty vessels to and\nfro, carry such sighs as these? The duke could not fail to mark this\nchange, and his heart was cruelly hurt. Of a sensitive character, proud\nand susceptible of deep attachment, he cursed the day on which such a\npassion had entered his heart. The looks he cast, from time to time\nat Madame, became colder by degrees at the chilling complexion of his\nthoughts. He could hardly yet despair, but he was strong enough to\nimpose silence upon the tumultuous outcries of his heart. In exact\nproportion, however, as Madame suspected this change of feeling, she\nredoubled her activity to regain the ray of light she was about to lose;\nher timid and indecisive mind was displayed in brilliant flashes of\nwit and humor. At any cost she felt that she must be remarked above\neverything and every one, even above the king himself. And she was so,\nfor the queens, notwithstanding their dignity, and the king, despite the\nrespect which etiquette required, were all eclipsed by her. The queens,\nstately and ceremonious, were softened and could not restrain their\nlaughter. Madame Henriette, the queen-mother, was dazzled by the\nbrilliancy which cast distinction upon her family, thanks to the wit of\nthe grand-daughter of Henry IV. The king, jealous, as a young man and\nas a monarch, of the superiority of those who surrounded him, could not\nresist admitting himself vanquished by a petulance so thoroughly French\nin its nature, whose energy more than ever increased by English humor.\nLike a child, he was captivated by her radiant beauty, which her wit\nmade still more dazzling. Madame's eyes flashed like lightning. Wit and\nhumor escaped from her scarlet lips like persuasion from the lips of\nNestor of old. The whole court, subdued by her enchanting grace,\nnoticed for the first time that laughter could be indulged in before the\ngreatest monarch in the world, like people who merited their appellation\nof the wittiest and most polished people in Europe.\n\nMadame, from that evening, achieved and enjoyed a success capable of\nbewildering all not born to those altitudes termed thrones; which, in\nspite of their elevation, are sheltered from such giddiness. From that\nvery moment Louis XIV. acknowledged Madame as a person to be recognized.\nBuckingham regarded her as a coquette deserving the cruelest tortures,\nand De Guiche looked upon her as a divinity; the courtiers as a star\nwhose light might some day become the focus of all favor and power. And\nyet Louis XIV., a few years previously, had not even condescended to\noffer his hand to that \"ugly girl\" for a ballet; and Buckingham had\nworshipped this coquette \"on both knees.\" De Guiche had once looked upon\nthis divinity as a mere woman; and the courtiers had not dared to extol\nthis star in her upward progress, fearful to disgust the monarch whom\nsuch a dull star had formerly displeased.\n\nLet us see what was taking place during this memorable evening at the\nking's card-table. The young queen, although Spanish by birth, and the\nniece of Anne of Austria, loved the king, and could not conceal her\naffection. Anne of Austria, a keen observer, like all women, and\nimperious, like every queen, was sensible of Madame's power, and\nacquiesced in it immediately, a circumstance which induced the young\nqueen to raise the siege and retire to her apartments. The king hardly\npaid any attention to her departure, notwithstanding the pretended\nsymptoms of indisposition by which it was accompanied. Encouraged by the\nrules of etiquette, which he had begun to introduce at the court as an\nelement of every relation of life, Louis XIV. did not disturb himself;\nhe offered his hand to Madame without looking at Monsieur his brother,\nand led the young princess to the door of her apartments. It was\nremarked, that at the threshold of the door, his majesty, freed from\nevery restraint, or not equal to the situation, sighed very deeply.\nThe ladies present--nothing escapes a woman's glance--Mademoiselle\nMontalais, for instance--did not fail to say to each other, \"the king\nsighed,\" and \"Madame sighed too.\" This had been indeed the case. Madame\nhad sighed very noiselessly, but with an accompaniment very far more\ndangerous for the king's repose. Madame had sighed, first closing her\nbeautiful black eyes, next opening them, and then, laden, as they were,\nwith an indescribable mournfulness of expression, she had raised them\ntowards the king, whose face at that moment visibly heightened in color.\nThe consequence of these blushes, of those interchanged sighs, and of\nthis royal agitation, was, that Montalais had committed an indiscretion\nwhich had certainly affected her companion, for Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, less clear sighted, perhaps, turned pale when the king\nblushed; and her attendance being required upon Madame, she tremblingly\nfollowed the princess without thinking of taking the gloves, which court\netiquette required her to do. True it is that the young country girl\nmight allege as her excuse the agitation into which the king seemed to\nbe thrown, for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, busily engaged in closing\nthe door, had involuntarily fixed her eyes upon the king, who, as he\nretired backwards, had his face towards it. The king returned to the\nroom where the card-tables were set out. He wished to speak to the\ndifferent persons there, but it was easy to see that his mind was\nabsent. He jumbled different accounts together, which was taken\nadvantage of by some of the noblemen who had retained those habits since\nthe time of Monsieur Mazarin--who had a poor memory, but was a good\ncalculator. In this way, Monsieur Manicamp, with a thoughtless and\nabsent air--for M. Manicamp was the honestest man in the world,\nappropriated twenty thousand francs, which were littering the table, and\nwhich did not seem to belong to any person in particular. In the same\nway, Monsieur de Wardes, whose head was doubtless a little bewildered by\nthe occurrences of the evening, somehow forgot to leave behind him the\nsixty double louis which he had won for the Duke of Buckingham, and\nwhich the duke, incapable, like his father, of soiling his hands with\ncoin of any sort, had left lying on the table before him. The king\nonly recovered his attention in some degree at the moment that Monsieur\nColbert, who had been narrowly observant for some minutes, approached,\nand, doubtless, with great respect, yet with much perseverance,\nwhispered a counsel of some sort into the still tingling ears of the\nking. The king, at the suggestion, listened with renewed attention and\nimmediately looking around him, said, \"Is Monsieur Fouquet no longer\nhere?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, I am here,\" replied the superintendent, till then engaged\nwith Buckingham, and approached the king, who advanced a step towards\nhim with a smiling yet negligent air. \"Forgive me,\" said Louis, \"if I\ninterrupt your conversation; but I claim your attention wherever I may\nrequire your services.\"\n\n\"I am always at the king's service,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"And your cash-box, too,\" said the king, laughing with a false smile.\n\n\"My cash-box more than anything else,\" said Fouquet, coldly.\n\n\"The fact is, I wish to give a _fete_ at Fontainebleau--to keep open\nhouse for fifteen days, and I shall require--\" and he stopped, glancing\nat Colbert. Fouquet waited without showing discomposure; and the king\nresumed, answering Colbert's icy smile, \"four million francs.\"\n\n\"Four million,\" repeated Fouquet, bowing profoundly. And his nails,\nburied in his bosom, were thrust into his flesh, but the tranquil\nexpression of his face remained unaltered. \"When will they be required,\nsire?\"\n\n\"Take your time,--I mean--no, no; as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"A certain time will be necessary, sire.\"\n\n\"Time!\" exclaimed Colbert, triumphantly.\n\n\"The time, monsieur,\" said the superintendent, with the haughtiest\ndisdain, \"simply to _count the money_; a million can only be drawn and\nweighed in a day.\"\n\n\"Four days, then,\" said Colbert.\n\n\"My clerks,\" replied Fouquet, addressing himself to the king, \"will\nperform wonders on his majesty's service, and the sum shall be ready in\nthree days.\"\n\nIt was for Colbert now to turn pale. Louis looked at him astonished.\nFouquet withdrew without any parade or weakness, smiling at his numerous\nfriends, in whose countenances alone he read the sincerity of their\nfriendship--an interest partaking of compassion. Fouquet, however,\nshould not be judged by his smile, for, in reality, he felt as if he had\nbeen stricken by death. Drops of blood beneath his coat stained the fine\nlinen that clothed his chest. His dress concealed the blood, and his\nsmile the rage which devoured him. His domestics perceived, by the\nmanner in which he approached his carriage, that their master was not in\nthe best of humors: the result of their discernment was, that his orders\nwere executed with that exactitude of maneuver which is found on board\na man-of-war, commanded during a storm by an ill-tempered captain. The\ncarriage, therefore, did not simply roll along--it flew. Fouquet had\nhardly time to recover himself during the drive; on his arrival he\nwent at once to Aramis, who had not yet retired for the night. As for\nPorthos, he had supped very agreeably off a roast leg of mutton, two\npheasants, and a perfect heap of cray-fish; he then directed his body to\nbe anointed with perfumed oils, in the manner of the wrestlers of\nold; and when this anointment was completed, he had himself wrapped in\nflannels and placed in a warm bed. Aramis, as we have already said,\nhad not retired. Seated at his ease in a velvet dressing-gown, he wrote\nletter after letter in that fine and hurried handwriting, a page of\nwhich contained a quarter of a volume. The door was thrown hurriedly\nopen, and the superintendent appeared, pale, agitated, anxious. Aramis\nlooked up: \"Good-evening,\" said he; and his searching look detected his\nhost's sadness and disordered state of mind. \"Was your play as good as\nhis majesty's?\" asked Aramis, by way of beginning the conversation.\n\nFouquet threw himself upon a couch, and then pointed to the door to\nthe servant who had followed him; when the servant had left he said,\n\"Excellent.\"\n\nAramis, who had followed every movement with his eyes, noticed that he\nstretched himself upon the cushions with a sort of feverish impatience.\n\"You have lost as usual?\" inquired Aramis, his pen still in his hand.\n\n\"Even more than usual,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"You know how to support losses?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"What, Monsieur Fouquet a bad player!\"\n\n\"There is play and play, Monsieur d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"How much have you lost?\" inquired Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.\n\nFouquet collected himself a moment, and then, without the slightest\nemotion, said, \"The evening has cost me four millions,\" and a bitter\nlaugh drowned the last vibration of these words.\n\nAramis, who did not expect such an amount, dropped his pen. \"Four\nmillions,\" he said; \"you have lost four millions,--impossible!\"\n\n\"Monsieur Colbert held my cards for me,\" replied the superintendent,\nwith a similar bitter laugh.\n\n\"Ah, now I understand; so, so, a new application for funds?\"\n\n\"Yes, and from the king's own lips. It was impossible to ruin a man with\na more charming smile. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It is clear that your destruction is the object in view.\"\n\n\"That is your opinion?\"\n\n\"Still. Besides, there is nothing in it which should astonish you, for\nwe have foreseen it all along.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I did not expect four millions.\"\n\n\"No doubt the amount is serious, but, after all, four millions are\nnot quite the death of a man, especially when the man in question is\nMonsieur Fouquet.\"\n\n\"My dear D'Herblay, if you knew the contents of my coffers, you would be\nless easy.\"\n\n\"And you promised?\"\n\n\"What could I _do?_\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"The very day I refuse, Colbert will procure the money; whence I know\nnot, but he _will_ procure it: and I shall be lost.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that. In how many days did you promise the four\nmillions?\"\n\n\"In three days. The king seemed exceedingly pressed.\"\n\n\"_In three days?_\"\n\n\"When I think,\" resumed Fouquet, \"that just now as I passed along the\nstreets, the people cried out, 'There is the rich Monsieur Fouquet,' it\nis enough to turn my brain.\"\n\n\"Stay, monsieur, the matter is not worth so much trouble,\" said Aramis,\ncalmly, sprinkling some sand over the letter he had just written.\n\n\"Suggest a remedy, then, for this evil without a remedy.\"\n\n\"There is only one remedy for you,--pay.\"\n\n\"But it is very uncertain whether I have the money. Everything must be\nexhausted; Belle-Isle is paid for; the pension has been paid; and money,\nsince the investigation of the accounts of those who farm the revenue,\nis scarce. Besides, admitting that I pay this time, how can I do so on\nanother occasion? When kings have tasted money, they are like tigers who\nhave tasted flesh, they devour everything. The day will arrive--_must_\narrive--when I shall have to say, 'Impossible, sire,' and on that very\nday I am a lost man.\"\n\nAramis raised his shoulders slightly, saying:\n\n\"A man in your position, my lord, is only lost when he wishes to be so.\"\n\n\"A man, whatever his position may be, cannot hope to struggle against a\nking.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; when I was young I wrestled successfully with the Cardinal\nRichelieu, who was king of France,--nay more--cardinal.\"\n\n\"Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures? I have not even\nBelle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Bah! necessity is the mother of invention, and when you think all is\nlost, something will be discovered which will retrieve everything.\"\n\n\"Who will discover this wonderful something?\"\n\n\"Yourself.\"\n\n\"I! I resign my office of inventor.\"\n\n\"Then _I_ will.\"\n\n\"Be it so. But set to work without delay.\"\n\n\"Oh! we have time enough!\"\n\n\"You kill me, D'Herblay, with your calmness,\" said the superintendent,\npassing his handkerchief over his face.\n\n\"Do you not remember that I one day told you not to make yourself\nuneasy, if you possessed courage? _Have_ you any?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"Then don't make yourself uneasy.\"\n\n\"It is decided then, that, at the last moment, you will come to my\nassistance.\"\n\n\"It will only be the repayment of a debt I owe you.\"\n\n\"It is the vocation of financiers to anticipate the wants of men such as\nyourself, D'Herblay.\"\n\n\"If obligingness is the vocation of financiers, charity is the virtue\nof the clergy. Only, on this occasion, do you act, monsieur. You are not\nyet sufficiently reduced, and at the last moment we will see what is to\nbe done.\"\n\n\"We shall see, then, in a very short time.\"\n\n\"Very well. However, permit me to tell you that, personally, I regret\nexceedingly that you are at present so short of money, because I myself\nwas about to ask you for some.\"\n\n\"For yourself?\"\n\n\"For myself, or some of my people, for mine or for ours.\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Be easy on that score; a roundish sum, it is true, but not too\nexorbitant.\"\n\n\"Tell me the amount.\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Oh! a mere nothing. Of course one has always fifty thousand francs.\nWhy the deuce cannot that knave Colbert be as easily satisfied as you\nare--and I should give myself far less trouble than I do. When do you\nneed this sum?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning; but you wish to know its destination?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, chevalier, I need no explanation.\"\n\n\"To-morrow is the first of June.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"One of our bonds becomes due.\"\n\n\"I did not know we had any bonds.\"\n\n\"Certainly, to-morrow we pay our last third instalment.\"\n\n\"What third?\"\n\n\"Of the one hundred and fifty thousand francs to Baisemeaux.\"\n\n\"Baisemeaux? Who is he?\"\n\n\"The governor of the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember. On what grounds am I to pay one hundred and fifty\nthousand francs for that man.\"\n\n\"On account of the appointment which he, or rather we, purchased from\nLouviere and Tremblay.\"\n\n\"I have a very vague recollection of the matter.\"\n\n\"That is likely enough, for you have so many affairs to attend to.\nHowever, I do not believe you have any affair in the world of greater\nimportance than this one.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, why we purchased this appointment.\"\n\n\"Why, in order to render him a service in the first place, and\nafterwards ourselves.\"\n\n\"Ourselves? You are joking.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, the time may come when the governor of the Bastile may\nprove a very excellent acquaintance.\"\n\n\"I have not the good fortune to understand you, D'Herblay.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, we had our own poets, our own engineer, our own architect,\nour own musicians, our own printer, and our own painters; we needed our\nown governor of the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Let us not deceive ourselves, monseigneur; we are very much opposed to\npaying the Bastile a visit,\" added the prelate, displaying, beneath\nhis pale lips, teeth which were still the same beautiful teeth so much\nadmired thirty years previously by Marie Michon.\n\n\"And you think it is not too much to pay one hundred and fifty thousand\nfrancs for that? I thought you generally put out money at better\ninterest than that.\"\n\n\"The day will come when you will admit your mistake.\"\n\n\"My dear D'Herblay, the very day on which a man enters the Bastile, he\nis no longer protected by his past.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is, if the bonds are perfectly regular; besides, that good\nfellow Baisemeaux has not a courtier's heart. I am certain, my lord,\nthat he will not remain ungrateful for that money, without taking into\naccount, I repeat, that I retain the acknowledgements.\"\n\n\"It is a strange affair! usury in a matter of benevolence.\"\n\n\"Do not mix yourself up with it, monseigneur; if there be usury, it is\nI who practice it, and both of us reap the advantage from it--that is\nall.\"\n\n\"Some intrigue, D'Herblay?\"\n\n\"I do not deny it.\"\n\n\"And Baisemeaux an accomplice in it?\"\n\n\"Why not?--there are worse accomplices than he. May I depend, then, upon\nthe five thousand pistoles to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Do you want them this evening?\"\n\n\"It would be better, for I wish to start early; poor Baisemeaux will not\nbe able to imagine what has be become of me, and must be upon thorns.\"\n\n\"You shall have the amount in an hour. Ah, D'Herblay, the interest\nof your one hundred and fifty thousand francs will never pay my four\nmillions for me.\"\n\n\"Why not, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Good-night, I have business to transact with my clerks before I\nretire.\"\n\n\"A good night's rest, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"D'Herblay, you wish things that are impossible.\"\n\n\"Shall I have my fifty thousand francs this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Go to sleep, then, in perfect safety--it is I who tell you to do so.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this assurance, and the tone in which it was given,\nFouquet left the room shaking his head, and heaving a sigh.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII. M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun's Accounts.\n\nThe clock of St. Paul was striking seven as Aramis, on horseback,\ndressed as a simple citizen, that is to say, in colored suit, with no\ndistinctive mark about him, except a kind of hunting-knife by his side,\npassed before the Rue du Petit-Musc, and stopped opposite the Rue des\nTournelles, at the gate of the Bastile. Two sentinels were on duty at\nthe gate; they made no difficulty about admitting Aramis, who entered\nwithout dismounting, and they pointed out the way he was to go by a\nlong passage with buildings on both sides. This passage led to the\ndrawbridge, or, in other words, to the real entrance. The drawbridge was\ndown, and the duty of the day was about being entered upon. The sentinel\nat the outer guardhouse stopped Aramis's further progress, asking him,\nin a rough tone of voice, what had brought him there. Aramis explained,\nwith his usual politeness, that a wish to speak to M. Baisemeaux de\nMontlezun had occasioned his visit. The first sentinel then summoned a\nsecond sentinel, stationed within an inner lodge, who showed his face\nat the grating, and inspected the new arrival most attentively. Aramis\nreiterated the expression of his wish to see the governor; whereupon the\nsentinel called to an officer of lower grade, who was walking about in a\ntolerably spacious courtyard and who, in turn, on being informed of his\nobject, ran to seek one of the officers of the governor's staff. The\nlatter, after having listened to Aramis's request, begged him to wait a\nmoment, then went away a short distance, but returned to ask his name.\n\"I cannot tell it you, monsieur,\" said Aramis; \"I need only mention that\nI have matters of such importance to communicate to the governor, that\nI can only rely beforehand upon one thing, that M. de Baisemeaux will be\ndelighted to see me; nay, more than that, when you have told him that it\nis the person whom he expected on the first of June, I am convinced he\nwill hasten here himself.\" The officer could not possibly believe that a\nman of the governor's importance should put himself out for a person of\nso little importance as the citizen-looking visitor on horseback. \"It\nhappens most fortunately, monsieur,\" he said, \"that the governor is just\ngoing out, and you can perceive his carriage with the horses already\nharnessed, in the courtyard yonder; there will be no occasion for him to\ncome to meet you, as he will see you as he passes by.\" Aramis bowed to\nsignify his assent; he did not wish to inspire others with too exalted\nan opinion of himself, and therefore waited patiently and in silence,\nleaning upon the saddle-bow of his horse. Ten minutes had hardly elapsed\nwhen the governor's carriage was observed to move. The governor appeared\nat the door, and got into the carriage, which immediately prepared to\nstart. The same ceremony was observed for the governor himself as with\na suspected stranger; the sentinel at the lodge advanced as the\ncarriage was about to pass under the arch, and the governor opened the\ncarriage-door, himself setting the example of obedience to orders;\nso that, in this way, the sentinel could convince himself that no one\nquitted the Bastile improperly. The carriage rolled along under the\narchway, but at the moment the iron-gate was opened, the officer\napproached the carriage, which had again been stopped, and said\nsomething to the governor, who immediately put his head out of\nthe door-way, and perceived Aramis on horseback at the end of the\ndrawbridge. He immediately uttered almost a shout of delight, and got\nout, or rather darted out of his carriage, running towards Aramis, whose\nhands he seized, making a thousand apologies. He almost embraced him.\n\"What a difficult matter to enter the Bastile!\" said Aramis. \"Is it the\nsame for those who are sent here against their wills, as for those who\ncome of their own accord?\"\n\n\"A thousand pardons, my lord. How delighted I am to see your Grace!\"\n\n\"Hush! What are you thinking of, my dear M. Baisemeaux? What do you\nsuppose would be thought of a bishop in my present costume?\"\n\n\"Pray, excuse me, I had forgotten. Take this gentleman's horse to the\nstables,\" cried Baisemeaux.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Aramis; \"I have five thousand pistoles in the\nsaddle-bags.\"\n\nThe governor's countenance became so radiant, that if the prisoners had\nseen him they would have imagined some prince of the royal blood had\narrived. \"Yes, you are right, the horse shall be taken to the government\nhouse. Will you get into the carriage, my dear M. d'Herblay? and it\nshall take us back to my house.\"\n\n\"Get into a carriage to cross a courtyard! do you believe I am so great\nan invalid? No, no, we will go on foot.\"\n\nBaisemeaux then offered his arm as a support, but the prelate did\nnot accept it. They arrived in this manner at the government house,\nBaisemeaux rubbing his hands and glancing at the horse from time to\ntime, while Aramis was looking at the bleak bare walls. A tolerably\nhandsome vestibule and a staircase of white stone led to the governor's\napartments, who crossed the ante-chamber, the dining-room, where\nbreakfast was being prepared, opened a small side door, and closeted\nhimself with his guest in a large cabinet, the windows of which opened\nobliquely upon the courtyard and the stables. Baisemeaux installed the\nprelate with that all-inclusive politeness of which a good man, or a\ngrateful man, alone possesses the secret. An arm-chair, a footstool,\na small table beside him, on which to rest his hand, everything was\nprepared by the governor himself. With his own hands, too, he placed\nupon the table, with much solicitude, the bag containing the gold, which\none of the soldiers had brought up with the most respectful devotion;\nand the soldier having left the room, Baisemeaux himself closed the door\nafter him, drew aside one of the window-curtains, and looked steadfastly\nat Aramis to see if the prelate required anything further.\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" he said, still standing up, \"of all men of their word,\nyou still continue to be the most punctual.\"\n\n\"In matters of business, dear M. de Baisemeaux, exactitude is not a\nvirtue only, it is a duty as well.\"\n\n\"Yes, in matters of business, certainly; but what you have with me is\nnot of that character; it is a service you are rendering me.\"\n\n\"Come, confess, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that, notwithstanding this\nexactitude, you have not been without a little uneasiness.\"\n\n\"About your health, I certainly have,\" stammered out Baisemeaux.\n\n\"I wished to come here yesterday, but I was not able, as I was too\nfatigued,\" continued Aramis. Baisemeaux anxiously slipped another\ncushion behind his guest's back. \"But,\" continued Aramis, \"I promised\nmyself to come and pay you a visit to-day, early in the morning.\"\n\n\"You are really very kind, my lord.\"\n\n\"And it was a good thing for me I was punctual, I think.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, you were going out.\" At which latter remark Baisemeaux colored and\nsaid, \"It is true I was going out.\"\n\n\"Then I prevent you,\" said Aramis; whereupon the embarrassment of\nBaisemeaux became visibly greater. \"I am putting you to inconvenience,\"\nhe continued, fixing a keen glace upon the poor governor; \"if I had\nknown that, I should not have come.\"\n\n\"How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?\"\n\n\"Confess you were going in search of money.\"\n\n\"No,\" stammered out Baisemeaux, \"no! I assure you I was going to--\"\n\n\"Does the governor still intend to go to M. Fouquet?\" suddenly called\nout the major from below. Baisemeaux ran to the window like a madman.\n\"No, no,\" he exclaimed in a state of desperation, \"who the deuce is\nspeaking of M. Fouquet? are you drunk below there? why am I interrupted\nwhen I am engaged on business?\"\n\n\"You were going to M. Fouquet's,\" said Aramis, biting his lips, \"to M.\nFouquet, the abbe, or the superintendent?\"\n\nBaisemeaux almost made up his mind to tell an untruth, but he could not\nsummon courage to do so. \"To the superintendent,\" he said.\n\n\"It is true, then, that you were in want of money, since you were going\nto a person who gives it away!\"\n\n\"I assure you, my lord--\"\n\n\"You were afraid?\"\n\n\"My dear lord, it was the uncertainty and ignorance in which I was as to\nwhere you were to be found.\"\n\n\"You would have found the money you require at M. Fouquet's, for he is a\nman whose hand is always open.\"\n\n\"I swear that I should never have ventured to ask M. Fouquet for money.\nI only wished to ask him for your address.\"\n\n\"To ask M. Fouquet for my address?\" exclaimed Aramis, opening his eyes\nin real astonishment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Baisemeaux, greatly disturbed by the glance which the\nprelate fixed upon him,--\"at M. Fouquet's certainly.\"\n\n\"There is no harm in that, dear M. Baisemeaux, only I would ask, why ask\nmy address of M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"That I might write to you.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Aramis smiling, \"but that is not what I meant; I do\nnot ask you what you required my address for: I only ask why you should\ngo to M. Fouquet for it?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Baisemeaux, \"as Belle-Isle is the property of M. Fouquet,\nand as Belle-Isle is in the diocese of Vannes, and as you are bishop of\nVannes--\"\n\n\"But, my dear Baisemeaux, since you knew I was bishop of Vannes, you had\nno occasion to ask M. Fouquet for my address.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said Baisemeaux, completely at bay, \"if I have acted\nindiscreetly, I beg your pardon most sincerely.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" observed Aramis calmly: \"how can you possibly have acted\nindiscreetly?\" And while he composed his face, and continued to smile\ncheerfully on the governor, he was considering how Baisemeaux, who was\nnot aware of his address, knew, however, that Vannes was his residence.\n\"I shall clear all this up,\" he said to himself; and then speaking\naloud, added,--\"Well, my dear governor shall we now arrange our little\naccounts?\"\n\n\"I am at your orders, my lord; but tell me beforehand, my lord, whether\nyou will do me the honor to breakfast with me as usual?\"\n\n\"Very willingly, indeed.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said Baisemeaux, as he struck the bell before him three\ntimes.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"That I have some one to breakfast with me, and that preparations are to\nbe made accordingly.\"\n\n\"And you rang thrice. Really, my dear governor, I begin to think you are\nacting ceremoniously with me.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Besides, the least I can do is to receive you in the best\nway I can.\"\n\n\"But why so?\"\n\n\"Because not even a prince could have done what you have done for me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nay, I assure you--\"\n\n\"Let us speak of other matters,\" said Aramis. \"Or rather, tell me how\nyour affairs here are getting on.\"\n\n\"Not over well.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"M. de Mazarin was not hard enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see; you require a government full of suspicion--like that of\nthe old cardinal, for instance.\"\n\n\"Yes; matters went on better under him. The brother of his 'gray\neminence' made his fortune here.\"\n\n\"Believe me, my dear governor,\" said Aramis, drawing closer to\nBaisemeaux, \"a young king is well worth an old cardinal. Youth has\nits suspicions, its fits of anger, its prejudices, as old age has its\nhatreds, its precautions, and its fears. Have you paid your three years'\nprofits to Louvidre and Tremblay?\"\n\n\"Most certainly I have.\"\n\n\"So that you have nothing more to give them than the fifty thousand\nfrancs I have brought with me?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you not saved anything, then?\"\n\n\"My lord, in giving the fifty thousand francs of my own to these\ngentlemen, I assure you that I gave them everything I gain. I told M.\nd'Artagnan so yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Aramis, whose eyes sparkled for a moment, but became\nimmediately afterwards as unmoved as before; \"so you have been to see my\nold friend D'Artagnan; how was he?\"\n\n\"Wonderfully well.\"\n\n\"And what did you say to him, M. de Baisemeaux?\"\n\n\"I told him,\" continued the governor, not perceiving his own\nthoughtlessness; \"I told him that I fed my prisoners too well.\"\n\n\"How many have you?\" inquired Aramis, in an indifferent tone of voice.\n\n\"Sixty.\"\n\n\"Well, that is a tolerably round number.\"\n\n\"In former times, my lord, there were, during certain years, as many as\ntwo hundred.\"\n\n\"Still a minimum of sixty is not to be grumbled at.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not; for, to anybody but myself, each prisoner would bring in\ntwo hundred and fifty pistoles; for instance, for a prince of the blood\nI have fifty francs a day.\"\n\n\"Only you have no prince of the blood; at least, I suppose so,\" said\nAramis, with a slight tremor in his voice.\n\n\"No, thank heaven!--I mean, no, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by unfortunately?\"\n\n\"Because my appointment would be improved by it. So fifty francs per day\nfor a prince of the blood, thirty-six for a marechal of France--\"\n\n\"But you have as many marechals of France, I suppose, as you have\nprinces of the blood?\"\n\n\"Alas! no more. It is true lieutenant-generals and brigadiers pay\ntwenty-six francs, and I have two of them. After that, come councilors\nof parliament, who bring me fifteen francs, and I have six of them.\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" said Aramis, \"that councilors were so productive.\"\n\n\"Yes; but from fifteen francs I sink at once to ten francs; namely, for\nan ordinary judge, and for an ecclesiastic.\"\n\n\"And you have seven, you say; an excellent affair.\"\n\n\"Nay, a bad one, and for this reason. How can I possibly treat these\npoor fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a\ncouncilor of parliament?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right; I do not see five francs difference between them.\"\n\n\"You understand; if I have a fine fish, I pay four or five francs for\nit; if I get a fine fowl, it cost me a franc and a half. I fatten a good\ndeal of poultry, but I have to buy grain, and you cannot imagine the\narmy of rats that infest this place.\"\n\n\"Why not get half a dozen cats to deal with them?\"\n\n\"Cats, indeed; yes, they eat them, but I was obliged to give up the idea\nbecause of the way in which they treated my grain. I have been obliged\nto have some terrier dogs sent me from England to kill the rats. These\ndogs, unfortunately, have tremendous appetites; they eat as much as a\nprisoner of the fifth order, without taking into account the rabbits and\nfowls they kill.\"\n\nWas Aramis really listening or not? No one could have told; his downcast\neyes showed the attentive man, but the restless hand betrayed the man\nabsorbed in thought--Aramis was meditating.\n\n\"I was saying,\" continued Baisemeaux, \"that a good-sized fowl costs me\na franc and a half, and that a fine fish costs me four or five francs.\nThree meals are served at the Bastile, and, as the prisoners, having\nnothing to do, are always eating, a ten-franc man costs me seven francs\nand a half.\"\n\n\"But did you not say that you treated those at ten francs like those at\nfifteen?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Very well! Then you gain seven francs and a half upon those who pay you\nfifteen francs.\"\n\n\"I _must_ compensate myself somehow,\" said Baisemeaux, who saw how he\nhad been snapped up.\n\n\"You are quite right, my dear governor; but have you no prisoners below\nten francs?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! we have citizens and barristers at five francs.\"\n\n\"And do they eat, too?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it; only you understand that they do not get fish or\npoultry, nor rich wines at every meal; but at all events thrice a week\nthey have a good dish at their dinner.\"\n\n\"Really, you are quite a philanthropist, my dear governor, and you will\nruin yourself.\"\n\n\"No; understand me; when the fifteen-franc has not eaten his fowl, or\nthe ten-franc has left his dish unfinished, I send it to the five-franc\nprisoner; it is a feast for the poor devil, and one must be charitable,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"And what do you make out of your five-franc prisoners?\"\n\n\"A franc and a half.\"\n\n\"Baisemeaux, you're an honest fellow; in honest truth I say so.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord. But I feel most for the small tradesmen and\nbailiffs' clerks, who are rated at three francs. They do not often see\nRhine carp or Channel sturgeon.\"\n\n\"But do not the five-franc gentlemen sometimes leave some scraps?\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord, do not believe I am so stingy as that; I delight the heart\nof some poor little tradesman or clerk by sending him a wing of a red\npartridge, a slice of venison, or a slice of a truffled pasty, dishes\nwhich he never tasted except in his dreams; these are the leavings of\nthe twenty-four-franc prisoners; and as he eats and drinks, at dessert\nhe cries 'Long live the King,' and blesses the Bastile; with a couple\nbottles of champagne, which cost me five sous, I make him tipsy every\nSunday. That class of people call down blessings upon me, and are sorry\nto leave the prison. Do you know that I have remarked, and it does me\ninfinite honor, that certain prisoners, who have been set at liberty,\nhave, almost immediately afterwards, got imprisoned again? Why should\nthis be the case, unless it be to enjoy the pleasures of my kitchen? It\nis really the fact.\"\n\nAramis smiled with an expression of incredulity.\n\n\"You smile,\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"I do,\" returned Aramis.\n\n\"I tell you that we have names which have been inscribed on our books\nthrice in the space of two years.\"\n\n\"I must see it before I believe it,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Well, I can show it to you, although it is prohibited to communicate\nthe registers to strangers; and if you really wish to see it with your\nown eyes--\"\n\n\"I should be delighted, I confess.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Baisemeaux, and he took out of a cupboard a large\nregister. Aramis followed him most anxiously with his eyes, and\nBaisemeaux returned, placed the register upon the table, and turned over\nthe leaves for a minute, and stayed at the letter M.\n\n\"Look here,\" said he, \"Martinier, January, 1659; Martinier, June, 1660;\nMartinier, March, 1661. Mazarinades, etc.; you understand it was only\na pretext; people were not sent to the Bastile for jokes against M.\nMazarin; the fellow denounced himself in order to get imprisoned here.\"\n\n\"And what was his object?\"\n\n\"None other than to return to my kitchen at three francs a day.\"\n\n\"Three francs--poor devil!\"\n\n\"The poet, my lord, belongs to the lowest scale, the same style of board\nas the small tradesman and bailiff's clerk; but I repeat, it is to those\npeople that I give these little surprises.\"\n\nAramis mechanically turned over the leaves of the register, continuing\nto read the names, but without appearing to take any interest in the\nnames he read.\n\n\"In 1661, you perceive,\" said Baisemeaux, \"eighty entries; and in 1659,\neighty also.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Aramis. \"Seldon; I seem to know that name. Was it not you who\nspoke to me about a certain young man?\"\n\n\"Yes, a poor devil of a student, who made--What do you call that where\ntwo Latin verses rhyme together?\"\n\n\"A distich.\"\n\n\"Yes; that is it.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow; for a distich.\"\n\n\"Do you know that he made this distich against the Jesuits?\"\n\n\"That makes no difference; the punishment seems very severe. Do not pity\nhim; last year you seemed to interest yourself in him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did so.\"\n\n\"Well, as your interest is all-powerful here, my lord, I have treated\nhim since that time as a prisoner at fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"The same as this one, then,\" said Aramis, who had continued turning\nover the leaves, and who had stopped at one of the names which followed\nMartinier.\n\n\"Yes, the same as that one.\"\n\n\"Is that Marchiali an Italian?\" said Aramis, pointing with his finger to\nthe name which had attracted his attention.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Why hush?\" said Aramis, involuntarily clenching his white hand.\n\n\"I thought I had already spoken to you about that Marchiali.\"\n\n\"No, it is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.\"\n\n\"That may be, but perhaps I have spoken to you about him without naming\nhim.\"\n\n\"Is he an old offender?\" asked Aramis, attempting to smile.\n\n\"On the contrary, he is quite young.\"\n\n\"Is his crime, then, very heinous?\"\n\n\"Unpardonable.\"\n\n\"Has he assassinated any one?\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"An incendiary, then?\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Has he slandered any one?\"\n\n\"No, no! It is he who--\" and Baisemeaux approached Aramis's ear,\nmaking a sort of ear-trumpet of his hands, and whispered: \"It is he who\npresumes to resemble the--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Aramis; \"I now remember you already spoke about it last\nyear to me; but the crime appeared to me so slight.\"\n\n\"Slight, do you say?\"\n\n\"Or rather, so involuntary.\"\n\n\"My lord, it is not involuntarily that such a resemblance is detected.\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is, I had forgotten it. But, my dear host,\" said Aramis,\nclosing the register, \"if I am not mistaken, we are summoned.\"\n\nBaisemeaux took the register, hastily restored it to its place in the\ncloset, which he locked, and put the key in his pocket. \"Will it be\nagreeable to your lordship to breakfast now?\" said he; \"for you are\nright in supposing that breakfast was announced.\"\n\n\"Assuredly, my dear governor,\" and they passed into the dining-room.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV. The Breakfast at Monsieur de Baisemeaux's.\n\nAramis was generally temperate; but on this occasion, while taking\nevery care of his constitution, he did ample justice to Baisemeaux's\nbreakfast, which, in all respects, was most excellent. The latter on\nhis side, was animated with the wildest gayety; the sight of the five\nthousand pistoles, which he glanced at from time to time, seemed to open\nhis heart. Every now and then he looked at Aramis with an expression of\nthe deepest gratitude; while the latter, leaning back in his chair, took\na few sips of wine from his glass, with the air of a connoisseur. \"Let\nme never hear any ill words against the fare of the Bastile,\" said he,\nhalf closing his eyes; \"happy are the prisoners who can get only half a\nbottle of such Burgundy every day.\"\n\n\"All those at fifteen francs drink it,\" said Baisemeaux. \"It is very old\nVolnay.\"\n\n\"Does that poor student, Seldon, drink such good wine?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"I thought I heard you say he was boarded at fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"He! no, indeed; a man who makes districts--distichs I mean--at fifteen\nfrancs! No, no! it is his neighbor who is at fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"Which neighbor?\"\n\n\"The other, second Bertaudiere.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, my dear governor; but you speak a language which requires\nquite an apprenticeship to understand.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the governor. \"Allow me to explain: second Bertaudiere\nis the person who occupies the second floor of the tower of the\nBertaudiere.\"\n\n\"So that Bertaudiere is the name of one of the towers of the Bastile?\nThe fact is, I think I recollect hearing that each tower has a name of\nits own. Whereabouts is the one you are speaking of?\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Baisemeaux, going to the window. \"It is that tower to the\nleft--the second one.\"\n\n\"Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"Seven or eight years, nearly.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by nearly? Do you not know the dates more precisely?\"\n\n\"It was not in my time, M. d'Herblay.\"\n\n\"But I should have thought that Louviere or Tremblay would have told\nyou.\"\n\n\"The secrets of the Bastile are never handed over with the keys of the\ngovernorship.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Then the cause of his imprisonment is a mystery--a state\nsecret.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I do not suppose it is a state secret, but a secret--like\neverything that happens at the Bastile.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Aramis, \"why do you speak more freely of Seldon than of\nsecond Bertaudiere?\"\n\n\"Because, in my opinion, the crime of the man who writes a distich is\nnot so great as that of the man who resembles--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I understand you. Still, do not the turnkeys talk with your\nprisoners?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"The prisoners, I suppose, tell them they are not guilty?\"\n\n\"They are _always_ telling them that; it is a matter of course; the same\nsong over and over again.\"\n\n\"But does not the resemblance you were speaking about just now strike\nthe turnkeys?\"\n\n\"My dear M. d'Herblay, it is only for men attached to the court, as you\nare, to take trouble about such matters.\"\n\n\"You're right, you're right, my dear M. Baisemeaux. Let me give you\nanother taste of this Volnay.\"\n\n\"Not a taste merely, a full glass; fill yours too.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! You are a musketeer still, to the very tips of your fingers,\nwhile I have become a bishop. A taste for me; a glass for yourself.\"\n\n\"As you please.\" And Aramis and the governor nodded to each other, as\nthey drank their wine. \"But,\" said Aramis, looking with fixed attention\nat the ruby-colored wine he had raised to the level of his eyes, as if\nhe wished to enjoy it with all his senses at the same moment, \"but\nwhat you might call a resemblance, another would not, perhaps, take any\nnotice of.\"\n\n\"Most certainly he would, though, if it were any one who knew the person\nhe resembles.\"\n\n\"I really think, dear M. Baisemeaux, that it can be nothing more than a\nresemblance of your own creation.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, it is not so.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" continued Aramis. \"I have seen many persons very like the one\nwe are speaking of; but, out of respect, no one ever said anything about\nit.\"\n\n\"Very likely; because there is resemblance and resemblance. This is a\nstriking one, and, if you were to see him, you would admit it to be so.\"\n\n\"If I were to see him, indeed,\" said Aramis, in an indifferent tone;\n\"but in all probability I never shall.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because if I were even to put my foot inside one of those horrible\ndungeons, I should fancy I was buried there forever.\"\n\n\"No, no; the cells are very good places to live in.\"\n\n\"I really do not, and cannot believe it, and that is a fact.\"\n\n\"Pray do not speak ill of second Bertaudiere. It is really a good room,\nvery nicely furnished and carpeted. The young fellow has by no means\nbeen unhappy there; the best lodging the Bastile affords has been his.\nThere is a chance for you.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Aramis, coldly; \"you will never make me believe there\nare any good rooms in the Bastile; and, as for your carpets, they exist\nonly in your imagination. I should find nothing but spiders, rats, and\nperhaps toads, too.\"\n\n\"Toads?\" cried Baisemeaux.\n\n\"Yes, in the dungeons.\"\n\n\"Ah! I don't say there are not toads in the dungeons,\" replied\nBaisemeaux. \"But--will you be convinced by your own eyes?\" he continued,\nwith a sudden impulse.\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\n\"Not even to satisfy yourself of the resemblance which you deny, as you\ndo the carpets?\"\n\n\"Some spectral-looking person, a mere shadow; an unhappy, dying man.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind--as brisk and vigorous a young fellow as ever\nlived.\"\n\n\"Melancholy and ill-tempered, then?\"\n\n\"Not at all; very gay and lively.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; you are joking.\"\n\n\"Will you follow me?\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To go the round of the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You will then see for yourself--see with your own eyes.\"\n\n\"But the regulations?\"\n\n\"Never mind them. To-day my major has leave of absence; the lieutenant\nis visiting the post on the bastions; we are sole masters of the\nsituation.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear governor; why, the very idea of the sound of the bolts\nmakes me shudder. You will only have to forget me in second or fourth\nBertaudiere, and then--\"\n\n\"You are refusing an opportunity that may never present itself again. Do\nyou know that, to obtain the favor I propose to you gratis, some of the\nprinces of the blood have offered me as much as fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Really! he must be worth seeing, then?\"\n\n\"Forbidden fruit, my lord; forbidden fruit. You who belong to the church\nought to know that.\"\n\n\"Well, if had any curiosity, it would be to see the poor author of the\ndistich.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will see him, too; but if I were at all curious, it would\nbe about the beautiful carpeted room and its lodger.\"\n\n\"Furniture is very commonplace; and a face with no expression in it\noffers little or no interest.\"\n\n\"But a boarder at fifteen francs is always interesting.\"\n\n\"By the by, I forgot to ask you about that. Why fifteen francs for him,\nand only three francs for poor Seldon?\"\n\n\"The distinction made in that instance was a truly noble act, and one\nwhich displayed the king's goodness of heart to great advantage.\"\n\n\"The king's, you say.\"\n\n\"The cardinal's, I mean. 'This unhappy man,' said M. Mazarin, 'is\ndestined to remain in prison forever.'\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one; and, consequently, his\npunishment ought to be so, too.\"\n\n\"Lasting?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it, unless he is fortunate enough to catch the small-pox,\nand even that is difficult, for we never get any impure air here.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be more ingenious than your train of reasoning, my dear M.\nBaisemeaux. Do you, however, mean to say that this unfortunate man must\nsuffer without interruption or termination?\"\n\n\"I did not say he was to suffer, my lord; a fifteen-franc boarder does\nnot suffer.\"\n\n\"He suffers imprisonment, at all events.\"\n\n\"No doubt; there is no help for that, but this suffering is sweetened\nfor him. You must admit that this young fellow was not born to eat all\nthe good things he does eat; for instance, such things as we have on the\ntable now; this pasty that has not been touched, these crawfish from the\nRiver Marne, of which we have hardly taken any, and which are almost\nas large as lobsters; all these things will at once be taken to second\nBertaudiere, with a bottle of that Volnay which you think so excellent.\nAfter you have seen it you will believe it, I hope.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear governor, certainly; but all this time you are thinking\nonly of your very happy fifteen-franc prisoner, and you forget poor\nSeldon, my _protege_.\"\n\n\"Well, out of consideration for you, it shall be a gala day for him; he\nshall have some biscuits and preserves with this small bottle of port.\"\n\n\"You are a good-hearted fellow; I have said so already, and I repeat it,\nmy dear Baisemeaux.\"\n\n\"Well, let us set off, then,\" said the governor, a little bewildered,\npartly from the wine he had drunk, and partly from Aramis's praises.\n\n\"Do not forget that I only go to oblige you,\" said the prelate.\n\n\"Very well; but you will thank me when you get there.\"\n\n\"Let us go, then.\"\n\n\"Wait until I have summoned the jailer,\" said Baisemeaux, as he struck\nthe bell twice; at which summons a man appeared. \"I am going to visit\nthe towers,\" said the governor. \"No guards, no drums, no noise at all.\"\n\n\"If I were not to leave my cloak here,\" said Aramis, pretending to\nbe alarmed, \"I should really think I was going to prison on my own\naccount.\"\n\nThe jailer preceded the governor, Aramis walking on his right hand; some\nof the soldiers who happened to be in the courtyard drew themselves up\nin a line, as stiff as posts, as the governor passed along. Baisemeaux\nled the way down several steps which conducted to a sort of esplanade;\nthence they arrived at the drawbridge, where the sentinels on duty\nreceived the governor with the proper honors. The governor turned toward\nAramis, and, speaking in such a tone that the sentinels could not lose a\nword, he observed,--\"I hope you have a good memory, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"On account of your plans and your measurements, for you know that no\none is allowed, not architects even, to enter where the prisoners are,\nwith paper, pens or pencil.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Aramis to himself, \"it seems I am an architect, then. It\nsounds like one of D'Artagnan's jokes, who perceived in me the engineer\nof Belle-Isle.\" Then he added aloud: \"Be easy on that score,\nmonsieur; in our profession, a mere glance and a good memory are quite\nsufficient.\"\n\nBaisemeaux did not change countenance, and the soldiers took Aramis for\nwhat he seemed to be. \"Very well; we will first visit la Bertaudiere,\"\nsaid Baisemeaux, still intending the sentinels to hear him. Then,\nturning to the jailer, he added: \"You will take the opportunity of\ncarrying to No. 2 the few dainties I pointed out.\"\n\n\"Dear M. de Baisemeaux,\" said Aramis, \"you are always forgetting No. 3.\"\n\n\"So I am,\" said the governor; and upon that, they began to ascend. The\nnumber of bolts, gratings, and locks for this single courtyard would\nhave sufficed for the safety of an entire city. Aramis was neither an\nimaginative nor a sensitive man; he had been somewhat of a poet in his\nyouth, but his heart was hard and indifferent, as the heart of every man\nof fifty-five years of age is, who has been frequently and passionately\nattached to women in his lifetime, or rather who has been passionately\nloved by them. But when he placed his foot upon the worn stone steps,\nalong which so many unhappy wretches had passed, when he felt himself\nimpregnated, as it were, with the atmosphere of those gloomy dungeons,\nmoistened with tears, there could be but little doubt he was overcome\nby his feelings, for his head was bowed and his eyes became dim, as he\nfollowed Baisemeaux without a syllable.\n\n\n\nChapter XXV. The Second Floor of la Bertaudiere.\n\nOn the second flight of stairs, whether from fatigue or emotion, the\nbreathing of the visitor began to fail him, and he leaned against the\nwall. \"Will you begin with this one?\" said Baisemeaux; \"for since we are\ngoing to both, it matters very little whether we ascend from the second\nto the third story, or descend from the third to the second.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed Aramis, eagerly, \"higher, if you please; the one\nabove is the more urgent.\" They continued their ascent. \"Ask the jailer\nfor the keys,\" whispered Aramis. Baisemeaux did so, took the keys, and,\nhimself, opened the door of the third room. The jailer was the first to\nenter; he placed upon the table the provisions, which the kind-hearted\ngovernor called dainties, and then left the room. The prisoner had\nnot stirred; Baisemeaux then entered, while Aramis remained at the\nthreshold, from which place he saw a youth about eighteen years of age,\nwho, raising his head at the unusual noise, jumped off the bed, as he\nperceived the governor, and clasping his hands together, began to cry\nout, \"My mother, my mother,\" in tones which betrayed such deep distress\nthat Aramis, despite his command over himself, felt a shudder pass\nthrough his frame. \"My dear boy,\" said Baisemeaux, endeavoring to smile,\n\"I have brought you a diversion and an extra,--the one for the mind, the\nother for the body; this gentleman has come to take your measure, and\nhere are some preserves for your dessert.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" exclaimed the young man, \"keep me in solitude for a year,\nlet me have nothing but bread and water for a year, but tell me that at\nthe end of a year I shall leave this place, tell me that at the end of a\nyear I shall see my mother again.\"\n\n\"But I have heard you say that your mother was very poor, and that you\nwere very badly lodged when you were living with her, while here--upon\nmy word!\"\n\n\"If she were poor, monsieur, the greater reason to restore her only\nmeans of support to her. Badly lodged with her! Oh, monsieur, every one\nis always well lodged when he is free.\"\n\n\"At all events, since you yourself admit you have done nothing but write\nthat unhappy distich--\"\n\n\"But without any intention, I swear. Let me be punished--cut off the\nhand which wrote it, I will work with the other--but restore my mother\nto me.\"\n\n\"My boy,\" said Baisemeaux, \"you know very well that it does not depend\nupon me; all I can do for you is to increase your rations, give you a\nglass of port wine now and then, slip in a biscuit for you between a\ncouple of plates.\"\n\n\"Great heaven!\" exclaimed the young man, falling backward and rolling on\nthe ground.\n\nAramis, unable to bear this scene any longer, withdrew as far as the\nlanding. \"Unhappy, wretched man,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, he is indeed very wretched,\" said the jailer; \"but it is\nhis parents' fault.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"No doubt. Why did they let him learn Latin? Too much knowledge, you\nsee; it is that which does harm. Now I, for instance, can't read or\nwrite, and therefore I am not in prison.\" Aramis looked at the man,\nwho seemed to think that being a jailer in the Bastile was not being in\nprison. As for Baisemeaux, noticing the little effect produced by his\nadvice and his port wine, he left the dungeon quite upset. \"You have\nforgotten to close the door,\" said the jailer.\n\n\"So I have,\" said Baisemeaux; \"there are the keys, do you do it.\"\n\n\"I will solicit the pardon of that poor boy,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"And if you do not succeed,\" said Baisemeaux, \"at least beg that he may\nbe transferred to the ten-franc list, by which both he and I shall be\ngainers.\"\n\n\"If the other prisoner calls out for his mother in a similar manner,\"\nsaid Aramis, \"I prefer not to enter at all, but will take my measure\nfrom outside.\"\n\n\"No fear of that, monsieur architect, the one we are now going to see is\nas gentle as a lamb; before he could call after his mother he must open\nhis lips, and he never says a word.\"\n\n\"Let us go in, then,\" said Aramis, gloomily.\n\n\"Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?\" said the jailer.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"It is odd, then, that you are not more accustomed to all this.\"\n\nAramis perceived that, to avoid giving rise to any suspicions, he must\nsummon all his strength of mind to his assistance. Baisemeaux, who\ncarried the keys, opened the door. \"Stay outside,\" he said to the\njailer, \"and wait for us at the bottom of the steps.\" The jailer obeyed\nand withdrew.\n\nBaisemeaux entered first, and opened the second door himself. By the\nlight which filtered through the iron-barred window, could be seen a\nhandsome young man, short in stature, with closely cut hair, and a beard\nbeginning to grow; he was sitting on a stool, his elbow resting on an\narmchair, and with all the upper part of his body reclining against it.\nHis dress, thrown upon the bed, was of rich black velvet, and he inhaled\nthe fresh air which blew in upon his breast through a shirt of the very\nfinest cambric. As the governor entered, the young man turned his head\nwith a look full of indifference; and on recognizing Baisemeaux, he\narose and saluted him courteously. But when his eyes fell upon Aramis,\nwho remained in the background, the latter trembled, turned pale, and\nhis hat, which he held in his hand, fell upon the ground, as if all\nhis muscles had become relaxed at once. Baisemeaux, habituated to the\npresence of his prisoner, did not seem to share any of the sensations\nwhich Aramis experienced, but, with all the zeal of a good servant, he\nbusied himself in arranging on the table the pasty and crawfish he\nhad brought with him. Occupied in this manner, he did not remark how\ndisturbed his guest had become. When he had finished, however, he turned\nto the young prisoner and said: \"You are looking very well,--are you\nso?\"\n\n\"Quite well, I thank you, monsieur,\" replied the young man.\n\nThe effect of the voice was such as almost to overpower Aramis, and\nnotwithstanding his control over himself, he advanced a few steps\ntowards him, with his eyes wide open and his lips trembling. The\nmovement he made was so marked that Baisemeaux, notwithstanding his\npreoccupation, observed it. \"This gentleman is an architect who has come\nto examine your chimney,\" said Baisemeaux; \"does it smoke?\"\n\n\"Never, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You were saying just now,\" said the governor, rubbing his hands\ntogether, \"that it was not possible for a man to be happy in prison;\nhere, however, is one who is so. You have nothing to complain of, I\nhope?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Do you ever feel weary?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha,\" said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of voice; \"was I right?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear governor, it is impossible not to yield to evidence. Is\nit allowed to put any question to him?\"\n\n\"As many as you like.\"\n\n\"Very well; be good enough to ask him if he knows why he is here.\"\n\n\"This gentleman requests me to ask you,\" said Baisemeaux, \"if you are\naware of the cause of your imprisonment?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" said the young man, unaffectedly, \"I am not.\"\n\n\"That is hardly possible,\" said Aramis, carried away by his feelings\nin spite of himself; \"if you were really ignorant of the cause of your\ndetention, you would be furious.\"\n\n\"I was so during the early days of my imprisonment.\"\n\n\"Why are you not so now?\"\n\n\"Because I have reflected.\"\n\n\"That is strange,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Is it not odd?\" said Baisemeaux.\n\n\"May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?\"\n\n\"I felt that as I had committed no crime, Heaven could not punish me.\"\n\n\"What is a prison, then,\" inquired Aramis, \"if it be not a punishment.\"\n\n\"Alas! I cannot tell,\" said the young man; \"all that I can tell you now\nis the very opposite of what I felt seven years ago.\"\n\n\"To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one might almost\nbelieve that you liked your imprisonment?\"\n\n\"I endure it.\"\n\n\"In the certainty of recovering your freedom some day, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I have no certainty; hope, I have, and that is all; and yet I\nacknowledge that this hope becomes less every day.\"\n\n\"Still, why should you not again be free, since you have already been\nso?\"\n\n\"That is precisely the reason,\" replied the young man, \"which prevents\nme from expecting liberty; why should I have been imprisoned at all if\nit had been intended to release me afterwards?\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"I have forgotten the name by which I was called.\"\n\n\"Who are your parents?\"\n\n\"I never knew them.\"\n\n\"But those who brought you up?\"\n\n\"They did not call me their son.\"\n\n\"Did you ever love any one before coming here?\"\n\n\"I loved my nurse, and my flowers.\"\n\n\"Was that all?\"\n\n\"I also loved my valet.\"\n\n\"Do you regret your nurse and your valet?\"\n\n\"I wept very much when they died.\"\n\n\"Did they die since you have been here, or before you came?\"\n\n\"They died the evening before I was carried off.\"\n\n\"Both at the same time?\"\n\n\"Yes, both at the same time.\"\n\n\"In what manner were you carried off?\"\n\n\"A man came for me, directed me to get into a carriage, which was closed\nand locked, and brought me here.\"\n\n\"Would you be able to recognize that man again?\"\n\n\"He was masked.\"\n\n\"Is this not an extraordinary tale?\" said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of\nvoice, to Aramis, who could hardly breathe.\n\n\"It is indeed extraordinary,\" he murmured.\n\n\"But what is still more extraordinary is, that he has never told me so\nmuch as he has just told you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the reason may be that you have never questioned him,\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"It's possible,\" replied Baisemeaux; \"I have no curiosity. Have you\nlooked at the room? it's a fine one, is it not?\"\n\n\"Very much so.\"\n\n\"A carpet--\"\n\n\"Beautiful.\"\n\n\"I'll wager he had nothing like it before he came here.\"\n\n\"I think so, too.\" And then again turning towards the young man, he\nsaid, \"Do you not remember to have been visited at some time or another\nby a strange lady or gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; thrice by a woman, who each time came to the door in a\ncarriage, and entered covered with a veil, which she raised when we were\ntogether and alone.\"\n\n\"Do you remember that woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What did she say to you?\"\n\nThe young man smiled mournfully, and then replied, \"She inquired, as you\nhave just done, if I were happy, and if I were getting weary.\"\n\n\"What did she do on arriving, and on leaving you?\"\n\n\"She pressed me in her arms, held me in her embrace, and kissed me.\"\n\n\"Do you remember her?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Do you recall her features distinctly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You would recognize her, then, if accident brought her before you, or\nled you into her person?\"\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\nA flush of fleeting satisfaction passed across Aramis's face. At this\nmoment Baisemeaux heard the jailer approaching. \"Shall we leave?\" he\nsaid, hastily, to Aramis.\n\nAramis, who probably had learnt all that he cared to know, replied,\n\"When you like.\"\n\nThe young man saw them prepare to leave, and saluted them politely.\nBaisemeaux replied merely by a nod of the head, while Aramis, with a\nrespect, arising perhaps from the sight of such misfortune, saluted the\nprisoner profoundly. They left the room, Baisemeaux closing the door\nbehind them.\n\n\"Well,\" said Baisemeaux, as they descended the staircase, \"what do you\nthink of it all?\"\n\n\"I have discovered the secret, my dear governor,\" he said.\n\n\"Bah! what is the secret, then?\"\n\n\"A murder was committed in that house.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"But attend; the valet and nurse died the same day.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"And by poison. What do you think?\"\n\n\"That is very likely to be true.\"\n\n\"What! that that young man is an assassin?\"\n\n\"Who said that? What makes you think that poor young fellow could be an\nassassin?\"\n\n\"The very thing I was saying. A crime was committed in his house,\" said\nAramis, \"and that was quite sufficient; perhaps he saw the criminals,\nand it was feared that he might say something.\"\n\n\"The deuce! if I only thought that--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I would redouble the surveillance.\"\n\n\"Oh, he does not seem to wish to escape.\"\n\n\"You do not know what prisoners are.\"\n\n\"Has he any books?\"\n\n\"None; they are strictly prohibited, and under M. de Mazarin's own\nhand.\"\n\n\"Have you the writing still?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; would you like to look at it as you return to take your\ncloak?\"\n\n\"I should, for I like to look at autographs.\"\n\n\"Well, then, this one is of the most unquestionable authenticity; there\nis only one erasure.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah! an erasure; and in what respect?\"\n\n\"With respect to a figure. At first there was written: 'To be boarded at\nfifty francs.'\"\n\n\"As princes of the blood, in fact?\"\n\n\"But the cardinal must have seen his mistake, you understand; for he\ncanceled the zero, and has added a one before the five. But, by the\nby--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You do not speak of the resemblance.\"\n\n\"I do not speak of it, dear M. de Baisemeaux, for a very simple reason--\nbecause it does not exist.\"\n\n\"The deuce it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Or, if it does exist, it is only in your own imagination; but,\nsupposing it were to exist elsewhere, I think it would be better for you\nnot to speak of about it.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"The king, Louis XIV.--you understand--would be excessively angry with\nyou, if he were to learn that you contributed in any way to spread the\nreport that one of his subjects has the effrontery to resemble him.\"\n\n\"It is true, quite true,\" said Baisemeaux, thoroughly alarmed; \"but I\nhave not spoken of the circumstance to any one but yourself, and you\nunderstand, monseigneur, that I perfectly rely on your discretion.\"\n\n\"Oh, be easy.\"\n\n\"Do you still wish to see the note?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nWhile engaged in this manner in conversation, they had returned to\nthe governor's apartments; Baisemeaux took from the cupboard a private\nregister, like the one he had already shown Aramis, but fastened by\na lock, the key which opened it being one of a small bunch which\nBaisemeaux always carried with him. Then placing the book upon the\ntable, he opened it at the letter \"M,\" and showed Aramis the following\nnote in the column of observations: \"No books at any time; all linen\nand clothes of the finest and best quality to be procured; no exercise;\nalways the same jailer; no communications with any one. Musical\ninstruments; every liberty and every indulgence which his welfare may\nrequire; to be boarded at fifteen francs. M. de Baisemeaux can claim\nmore if the fifteen francs be not sufficient.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Baisemeaux, \"now I think of it, I shall claim it.\"\n\nAramis shut the book. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is indeed M. de Mazarin's\nhandwriting; I recognize it well. Now, my dear governor,\" he continued,\nas if this last communication had exhausted his interest, \"let us now\nturn over to our own little affairs.\"\n\n\"Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take? Fix it yourself.\"\n\n\"There need not be any particular period fixed; give me a simple\nacknowledgement for one hundred and fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"When to be made payable?\"\n\n\"When I require it; but, you understand, I shall only wish it when you\nyourself do.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am quite easy on that score,\" said Baisemeaux, smiling; \"but I\nhave already given you two receipts.\"\n\n\"Which I now destroy,\" said Aramis; and after having shown the two\nreceipts to Baisemeaux, he destroyed them. Overcome by so great a mark\nof confidence, Baisemeaux unhesitatingly wrote out an acknowledgement of\na debt of one hundred and fifty thousand francs, payable at the pleasure\nof the prelate. Aramis, who had, by glancing over the governor's\nshoulder, followed the pen as he wrote, put the acknowledgement into his\npocket without seeming to have read it, which made Baisemeaux perfectly\neasy. \"Now,\" said Aramis, \"you will not be angry with me if I were to\ncarry off one of your prisoners?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"By obtaining his pardon, of course. Have I not already told you that I\ntook a great interest in poor Seldon?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite true, you did so.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That is your affair; do as you think proper. I see you have an open\nhand, and an arm that can reach a great way.\"\n\n\"Adieu, adieu.\" And Aramis left, carrying with him the governor's best\nwishes.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI. The Two Friends.\n\nAt the very time M. de Baisemeaux was showing Aramis the prisoners in\nthe Bastile, a carriage drew up at Madame de Belliere's door, and, at\nthat still early hour, a young woman alighted, her head muffled in\na silk hood. When the servants announced Madame Vanel to Madame de\nBelliere, the latter was engaged, or rather was absorbed, in reading\na letter, which she hurriedly concealed. She had hardly finished her\nmorning toilette, her maid being still in the next room. At the name--at\nthe footsteps of Marguerite Vanel, Madame de Belliere ran to meet her.\nShe fancied she could detect in her friend's eyes a brightness which was\nneither that of health nor of pleasure. Marguerite embraced her, pressed\nher hands, and hardly allowed her time to speak. \"Dearest,\" she\nsaid, \"have you forgotten me? Have you quite given yourself up to the\npleasures of the court?\"\n\n\"I have not even seen the marriage _fetes_.\"\n\n\"What are you doing with yourself, then?\"\n\n\"I am getting ready to leave for Belliere.\"\n\n\"For Belliere?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are becoming rustic in your tastes, then; I delight to see you so\ndisposed. But you are pale.\"\n\n\"No, I am perfectly well.\"\n\n\"So much the better; I was becoming uneasy about you. You do not know\nwhat I have been told.\"\n\n\"People say so many things.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this is very singular.\"\n\n\"How well you know how to excite curiosity, Marguerite.\"\n\n\"Well, I was afraid of vexing you.\"\n\n\"Never; you have yourself always admired me for my evenness of temper.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is said that--no, I shall never be able to tell you.\"\n\n\"Do not let us talk about it, then,\" said Madame de Belliere, who\ndetected the ill-nature that was concealed by all these prefaces, yet\nfelt the most anxious curiosity on the subject.\n\n\"Well, then, my dear marquise, it is said, for some time past, you no\nlonger continue to regret Monsieur de Belliere as you used to.\"\n\n\"It is an ill-natured report, Marguerite. I do regret, and shall always\nregret, my husband; but it is now two years since he died. I am only\ntwenty-eight years old, and my grief at his loss ought not always to\ncontrol every action and thought of my life. You, Marguerite, who are\nthe model of a wife, would not believe me if I were to say so.\"\n\n\"Why not? Your heart is so soft and yielding,\" she said, spitefully.\n\n\"Yours is so, too, Marguerite, and yet I did not perceive that you\nallowed yourself to be overcome by grief when your heart was wounded.\"\nThese words were in direct allusion to Marguerite's rupture with the\nsuperintendent, and were also a veiled but direct reproach made against\nher friend's heart.\n\nAs if she only awaited this signal to discharge her shaft, Marguerite\nexclaimed, \"Well, Elise, it is said you are in love.\" And she looked\nfixedly at Madame de Belliere, who blushed against her will.\n\n\"Women can never escape slander,\" replied the marquise, after a moment's\npause.\n\n\"No one slanders you, Elise.\"\n\n\"What!--people say that I am in love, and yet they do not slander me!\"\n\n\"In the first place, if it be true, it is no slander, but simply a\nscandal-loving report. In the next place--for you did not allow me\nto finish what I was saying--the public does not assert that you have\nabandoned yourself to this passion. It represents you, on the contrary,\nas a virtuous but loving woman, defending yourself with claws and\nteeth, shutting yourself up in your own house as in a fortress; in other\nrespects, as impenetrable as that of Danae, notwithstanding Danae's\ntower was made of brass.\"\n\n\"You are witty, Marguerite,\" said Madame de Belliere, angrily.\n\n\"You always flatter me, Elise. In short, however, you are reported to be\nincorruptible and unapproachable. You cannot decide whether the world is\ncalumniating you or not; but what is it you are musing about while I am\nspeaking to you?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you are blushing and do not answer me.\"\n\n\"I was trying,\" said the marquise, raising her beautiful eyes brightened\nwith an indication of growing temper, \"I was trying to discover to what\nyou could possibly have alluded, you who are so learned in mythological\nsubjects, in comparing me to Danae.\"\n\n\"You were trying to guess that?\" said Marguerite, laughing.\n\n\"Yes; do you not remember that at the convent, when we were solving our\nproblems in arithmetic--ah! what I have to tell you is learned also, but\nit is my turn--do you not remember, that if one of the terms were given,\nwe were to find the other? Therefore do _you_ guess now?\"\n\n\"I cannot conjecture what you mean.\"\n\n\"And yet nothing is more simple. You pretend that I am in love, do you\nnot?\"\n\n\"So it is said.\"\n\n\"Very well; it is not said, I suppose, that I am in love with an\nabstraction. There must surely be a name mentioned in this report.\"\n\n\"Certainly, a name is mentioned.\"\n\n\"Very well; it is not surprising, then, that I should try to guess this\nname, since you do not tell it.\"\n\n\"My dear marquise, when I saw you blush, I did not think you would have\nto spend much time in conjectures.\"\n\n\"It was the word Danae which you used that surprised me. Danae means a\nshower of gold, does it not?\"\n\n\"That is to say that the Jupiter of Danae changed himself into a shower\nof gold for her.\"\n\n\"My lover, then, he whom you assign me--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; I am your friend, and assign you no one.\"\n\n\"That may be; but those who are ill disposed towards me.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to hear the name?\"\n\n\"I have been waiting this half hour for it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you shall hear it. Do not be shocked; he is a man high in\npower.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the marquise, as she clenched her hands like a patient at\nthe approach of the knife.\n\n\"He is a very wealthy man,\" continued Marguerite; \"the wealthiest, it\nmay be. In a word, it is--\"\n\nThe marquise closed her eyes for a moment.\n\n\"It is the Duke of Buckingham,\" said Marguerite, bursting into laughter.\nThis perfidy had been calculated with extreme ability; the name that\nwas pronounced, instead of the name which the marquise awaited, had\nprecisely the same effect upon her as the badly sharpened axes, that had\nhacked, without destroying, Messieurs de Chalais and de Thou upon the\nscaffold. She recovered herself, however, and said, \"I was perfectly\nright in saying you were a witty woman, for you are making the time pass\naway most agreeably. This joke is a most amusing one, for I have never\nseen the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Never?\" said Marguerite, restraining her laughter.\n\n\"I have never even left my own house since the duke has been at Paris.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" resumed Madame Vanel, stretching out her foot towards a paper\nwhich was lying on the carpet near the window; \"it is not necessary for\npeople to see each other, since they can write.\" The marquise trembled,\nfor this paper was the envelope of the letter she was reading as her\nfriend had entered, and was sealed with the superintendent's arms. As\nshe leaned back on the sofa on which she was sitting, Madame de Belliere\ncovered the paper with the thick folds of her large silk dress, and so\nconcealed it.\n\n\"Come, Marguerite, tell me, is it to tell me all these foolish reports\nthat you have come to see me so early in the day?\"\n\n\"No; I came to see you, in the first place, and to remind you of those\nhabits of our earlier days, so delightful to remember, when we used to\nwander about together at Vincennes, and, sitting beneath an oak, or in\nsome sylvan shade, used to talk of those we loved, and who loved us.\"\n\n\"Do you propose that we should go out together now?\"\n\n\"My carriage is here, and I have three hours at my disposal.\"\n\n\"I am not dressed yet, Marguerite; but if you wish that we should talk\ntogether, we can, without going to the woods of Vincennes, find in my\nown garden here, beautiful trees, shady groves, a green sward covered\nwith daisies and violets, the perfume of which can be perceived from\nwhere we are sitting.\"\n\n\"I regret your refusal, my dear marquise, for I wanted to pour out my\nwhole heart into yours.\"\n\n\"I repeat again, Marguerite, my heart is yours just as much in this\nroom, or beneath the lime-trees in the garden here, as it would be under\nthe oaks in the woods yonder.\"\n\n\"It is not the same thing for me. In approaching Vincennes, marquise,\nmy ardent aspirations approach nearer to that object towards which they\nhave for some days past been directed.\" The marquise suddenly raised\nher head. \"Are you surprised, then, that I am still thinking of\nSaint-Mande?\"\n\n\"Of Saint-Mande?\" exclaimed Madame de Belliere; and the looks of both\nwomen met each other like two resistless swords.\n\n\"You, so proud!\" said the marquise, disdainfully.\n\n\"I, so proud!\" replied Madame Vanel. \"Such is my nature. I do not\nforgive neglect--I cannot endure infidelity. When I leave any one who\nweeps at my abandonment, I feel induced still to love him; but when\nothers forsake me and laugh at their infidelity, I love distractedly.\"\n\nMadame de Belliere could not restrain an involuntary movement.\n\n\"She is jealous,\" said Marguerite to herself.\n\n\"Then,\" continued the marquise, \"you are quite enamored of the Duke\nof Buckingham--I mean of M. Fouquet?\" Elise felt the allusion, and\nher blood seemed to congeal in her heart. \"And you wished to go to\nVincennes,--to Saint-Mande, even?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what I wished: you would have advised me perhaps.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\"\n\n\"You have often done so.\"\n\n\"Most certainly I should not have done so in the present instance, for\nI do not forgive as you do. I am less loving, perhaps; when my heart has\nbeen once wounded, it remains so always.\"\n\n\"But M. Fouquet has not wounded you,\" said Marguerite Vanel, with the\nmost perfect simplicity.\n\n\"You perfectly understand what I mean. M. Fouquet has not wounded me;\nI do not know of either obligation or injury received at his hands, but\nyou have reason to complain of him. You are my friend, and I am afraid I\nshould not advise you as you would like.\"\n\n\"Ah! you are prejudging the case.\"\n\n\"The sighs you spoke of just now are more than indications.\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me,\" said the young woman suddenly, as if collecting her\nwhole strength, like a wrestler preparing for a last struggle; \"you take\nonly my evil dispositions and my weaknesses into calculation, and do\nnot speak of my pure and generous feelings. If, at this moment, I feel\ninstinctively attracted towards the superintendent, if I even make an\nadvance to him, which, I confess, is very probable, my motive for it\nis, that M. Fouquet's fate deeply affects me, and because he is, in my\nopinion, one of the most unfortunate men living.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the marquise, placing her hand upon her heart, \"something\nnew, then, has occurred?\"\n\n\"Do you not know it?\"\n\n\"I am utterly ignorant of everything about him,\" said Madame de\nBelliere, with the poignant anguish that suspends thought and speech,\nand even life itself.\n\n\"In the first place, then, the king's favor is entirely withdrawn from\nM. Fouquet, and conferred on M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"So it is stated.\"\n\n\"It is very clear, since the discovery of the plot of Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"I was told that the discovery of the fortifications there had turned\nout to M. Fouquet's honor.\"\n\nMarguerite began to laugh in so cruel a manner that Madame de Belliere\ncould at that moment have delightedly plunged a dagger in her bosom.\n\"Dearest,\" continued Marguerite, \"there is no longer any question of M.\nFouquet's honor; his safety is concerned. Before three days are passed\nthe ruin of the superintendent will be complete.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said the marquise, in her turn smiling, \"that is going a little\nfast.\"\n\n\"I said three days, because I wish to deceive myself with a hope; but\nprobably the catastrophe will be complete within twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"For the simplest of all reasons,--that M. Fouquet has no more money.\"\n\n\"In matters of finance, my dear Marguerite, some are without money\nto-day, who to-morrow can procure millions.\"\n\n\"That might be M. Fouquet's case when he had two wealthy and clever\nfriends who amassed money for him, and wrung it from every possible or\nimpossible source; but those friends are dead.\"\n\n\"Money does not die, Marguerite; it may be concealed, but it can be\nlooked for, bought and found.\"\n\n\"You see things on the bright side, and so much the better for you. It\nis really very unfortunate that you are not the Egeria of M. Fouquet;\nyou might now show him the source whence he could obtain the millions\nwhich the king asked him for yesterday.\"\n\n\"Millions!\" said the marquise, in terror.\n\n\"Four--an even number.\"\n\n\"Infamous!\" murmured Madame de Belliere, tortured by her friend's\nmerciless delight.\n\n\"M. Fouquet, I should think, must certainly have four millions,\" she\nreplied, courageously.\n\n\"If he has those which the king requires to-day,\" said Marguerite, \"he\nwill not, perhaps, possess those which the king will demand in a month\nor so.\"\n\n\"The king will exact money from him again, then?\"\n\n\"No doubt; and that is my reason for saying that the ruin of poor M.\nFouquet is inevitable. Pride will induce him to furnish the money, and\nwhen he has no more, he will fall.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the marquise, trembling; \"the plan is a bold one; but\ntell me, does M. Colbert hate M. Fouquet so very much?\"\n\n\"I think he does not like him. M. Colbert is powerful; he improves\non close acquaintance; he has gigantic ideas, a strong will, and\ndiscretion; he will rise.\"\n\n\"He will be superintendent?\"\n\n\"It is probable. Such is the reason, my dear marquise, why I felt myself\nimpressed in favor of that poor man, who once loved, and even adored me;\nand why, when I see him so unfortunate, I forgive his infidelity, which\nI have reason to believe he also regrets; and why, moreover, I should\nnot have been disinclined to afford him some consolation, or some good\nadvice; he would have understood the step I had taken, and would have\nthought kindly of me for it. It is gratifying to be loved, you know.\nMen value love more highly when they are no longer blinded by its\ninfluence.\"\n\nThe marquise, bewildered and overcome by these cruel attacks, which had\nbeen calculated with the greatest nicety and precision, hardly knew what\nto answer in return; she even seemed to have lost all power of thought.\nHer perfidious friend's voice had assumed the most affectionate tone;\nshe spoke as a woman, but concealed the instincts of a wolf.\n\n\"Well,\" said Madame de Belliere, who had a vague hope that Marguerite\nwould cease to overwhelm a vanquished enemy, \"why do you not go and see\nM. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"Decidedly, marquise, you have made me reflect. No, it would be\nunbecoming for me to make the first advance. M. Fouquet no doubt loves\nme, but he is too proud. I cannot expose myself to an affront....\nbesides, I have my husband to consider. You tell me nothing? Very well,\nI shall consult M. Colbert on the subject.\" Marguerite rose smilingly,\nas though to take leave, but the marquise had not the strength to\nimitate her. Marguerite advanced a few paces, in order that she might\ncontinue to enjoy the humiliating grief in which her rival was plunged,\nand then said, suddenly,--\"You do not accompany me to the door, then?\"\nThe marquise rose, pale and almost lifeless, without thinking of\nthe envelope, which had occupied her attention so greatly at the\ncommencement of the conversation, and which was revealed at the first\nstep she took. She then opened the door of her oratory, and without even\nturning her head towards Marguerite Vanel, entered it, closing the door\nafter her. Marguerite said, or rather muttered a few words, which Madame\nde Belliere did not even hear. As soon, however, as the marquise had\ndisappeared, her envious enemy, not being able to resist the desire\nto satisfy herself that her suspicions were well founded, advanced\nstealthily like a panther, and seized the envelope. \"Ah!\" she said,\ngnashing her teeth, \"it was indeed a letter from M. Fouquet she was\nreading when I arrived,\" and then darted out of the room. During this\ninterval, the marquise, having arrived behind the rampart, as it were,\nof her door, felt that her strength was failing her; for a moment she\nremained rigid, pale and motionless as a statue, and then, like a statue\nshaken on its base by an earthquake, tottered and fell inanimate on\nthe carpet. The noise of the fall resounded at the same moment as the\nrolling of Marguerite's carriage leaving the hotel.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII. Madame de Belliere's Plate.\n\nThe blow had been the more painful on account of its being unexpected.\nIt was some time before the marquise recovered herself; but once\nrecovered, she began to reflect upon the events so heartlessly announced\nto her. She therefore returned, at the risk even of losing her life in\nthe way, to that train of ideas which her relentless friend had\nforced her to pursue. Treason, then--deep menaces, concealed under\nthe semblance of public interest--such were Colbert's maneuvers. A\ndetestable delight at an approaching downfall, untiring efforts to\nattain this object, means of seduction no less wicked than the crime\nitself--such were the weapons Marguerite employed. The crooked atoms\nof Descartes triumphed; to the man without compassion was united a\nwoman without heart. The marquise perceived, with sorrow rather than\nindignation, that the king was an accomplice in the plot which betrayed\nthe duplicity of Louis XIII. in his advanced age, and the avarice of\nMazarin at a period of life when he had not had the opportunity of\ngorging himself with French gold. The spirit of this courageous\nwoman soon resumed its energy, no longer overwhelmed by indulgence in\ncompassionate lamentations. The marquise was not one to weep when action\nwas necessary, nor to waste time in bewailing a misfortune as long as\nmeans still existed of relieving it. For some minutes she buried her\nface in her cold fingers, and then, raising her head, rang for her\nattendants with a steady hand, and with a gesture betraying a fixed\ndetermination of purpose. Her resolution was taken.\n\n\"Is everything prepared for my departure?\" she inquired of one of her\nfemale attendants who entered.\n\n\"Yes, madame; but it was not expected that your ladyship would leave for\nBelliere for the next few days.\"\n\n\"All my jewels and articles of value, then, are packed up?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; but hitherto we have been in the habit of leaving them in\nParis. Your ladyship does not generally take your jewels with you into\nthe country.\"\n\n\"But they are all in order, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, in your ladyship's own room.\"\n\n\"The gold plate?\"\n\n\"In the chest.\"\n\n\"And the silver plate?\"\n\n\"In the great oak closet.\"\n\nThe marquise remained silent for a few moments, and then said calmly,\n\"Let my goldsmith be sent for.\"\n\nHer attendants quitted the room to execute the order. The marquise,\nhowever, had entered her own room, and was inspecting her casket of\njewels with the greatest attention. Never, until now, had she bestowed\nsuch close attention upon riches in which women take so much pride;\nnever, until now, had she looked at her jewels, except for the purpose\nof making a selection according to their settings or their colors.\nOn this occasion, however, she admired the size of the rubies and the\nbrilliancy of the diamonds; she grieved over every blemish and every\ndefect; she thought the gold light, and the stones wretched. The\ngoldsmith, as he entered, found her thus occupied. \"M. Faucheux,\" she\nsaid, \"I believe you supplied me with my gold service?\"\n\n\"I did, your ladyship.\"\n\n\"I do not now remember the amount of the account.\"\n\n\"Of the new service, madame, or of that which M. de Belliere presented\nto you on your marriage? for I have furnished both.\"\n\n\"First of all, the new one.\"\n\n\"The covers, the goblets, and the dishes, with their covers, the\n_eau-epergne_, the ice-pails, the dishes for the preserves, and the tea\nand coffee urns, cost your ladyship sixty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"No more?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship thought the account very high.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I remember, in fact, that it was dear; but it was the\nworkmanship, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; the designs, the chasings--all new patterns.\"\n\n\"What proportion of the cost does the workmanship form? Do not hesitate\nto tell me.\"\n\n\"A third of its value, madame.\"\n\n\"There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my\nhusband?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame; there is less workmanship in that than in the other. Its\nintrinsic value does not exceed thirty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand,\" murmured the marquise. \"But, M. Faucheux, there is\nalso the service which belonged to my mother; all that massive plate\nwhich I did not wish to part with, on account of the associations\nconnected with it.\"\n\n\"Ah! madame, that would indeed be an excellent resource for those who,\nunlike your ladyship, might not be in position to keep their plate. In\nchasing that they worked in solid metal. But that service is no longer\nin fashion. Its weight is its only advantage.\"\n\n\"That is all I care about. How much does it weigh?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand livres at the very least. I do not allude to the\nenormous vases for the buffet, which alone weigh five thousand livres,\nor ten thousand the pair.\"\n\n\"One hundred and thirty,\" murmured the marquise. \"You are quite sure of\nyour figures, M. Faucheux?\"\n\n\"The amount is entered in my books. Your ladyship is extremely\nmethodical, I am aware.\"\n\n\"Let us now turn to another subject,\" said Madame de Belliere; and she\nopened one of her jewel-boxes.\n\n\"I recognize these emeralds,\" said M. Faucheux; \"for it was I who had\nthe setting of them. They are the most beautiful in the whole court. No,\nI am mistaken; Madame de Chatillon has the most beautiful set; she had\nthem from Messieurs de Guise; but your set, madame, comes next.\"\n\n\"What are they worth?\"\n\n\"Mounted?\"\n\n\"No; supposing I wished to sell them.\"\n\n\"I know very well who would buy them,\" exclaimed M. Faucheux.\n\n\"That is the very thing I ask. They could be sold, then?\"\n\n\"All your jewels could be sold, madame. It is well known that you\npossess the most beautiful jewels in Paris. You are not changeable in\nyour tastes; when you make a purchase it is of the very best; and what\nyou purchase you do not part with.\"\n\n\"What could these emeralds be sold for, then?\"\n\n\"A hundred and thirty thousand francs.\"\n\nThe marquise wrote down upon her tablets the amount which the jeweler\nmentioned. \"The ruby necklace?\" she said.\n\n\"Are they balas-rubies, madame?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\n\"They are beautiful--magnificent. I did not know your ladyship had these\nstones.\"\n\n\"What is their value?\"\n\n\"Two hundred thousand francs. The center one is alone worth a hundred\nthousand.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said the marquise. \"As for diamonds, I have them in\nnumbers; rings, necklaces, sprigs, ear-rings, clasps. Tell me their\nvalue, M. Faucheux.\"\n\nThe jeweler took his magnifying-glass and scales, weighed and inspected\nthem, and silently made his calculations. \"These stones,\" he said, \"must\nhave cost your ladyship an income of forty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"You value them at eight hundred thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"It is about what I imagined--but the settings are not included?\"\n\n\"No, madame; but if I were called upon to sell or to buy, I should be\nsatisfied with the gold of the settings alone as my profit upon the\ntransaction. I should make a good twenty-five thousand francs.\"\n\n\"An agreeable sum.\"\n\n\"Very much so, madame.\"\n\n\"Will you then accept that profit, then, on condition of converting the\njewels into money?\"\n\n\"But you do not intend to sell you diamonds, I suppose, madame?\"\nexclaimed the bewildered jeweler.\n\n\"Silence, M. Faucheux, do not disturb yourself about that; give me an\nanswer simply. You are an honorable man, with whom my family has dealt\nfor thirty years; you knew my father and mother, whom your own father\nand mother served. I address you as a friend; will you accept the gold\nof the settings in return for a sum of ready money to be placed in my\nhands?\"\n\n\"Eight hundred thousand francs! it is enormous.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"Impossible to find.\"\n\n\"Not so.\"\n\n\"But reflect, madame, upon the effect which will be produced by the sale\nof your jewels.\"\n\n\"No one need know it. You can get sets of false jewels made for me,\nsimilar to the real. Do not answer a word; I insist upon it. Sell them\nseparately, sell the stones only.\"\n\n\"In that way it is easy. Monsieur is looking out for some sets of\njewels as well as single stones for Madame's toilette. There will be\na competition for them. I can easily dispose of six hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth to Monsieur. I am certain yours are the most beautiful.\"\n\n\"When can you do so?\"\n\n\"In less than three days' time.\"\n\n\"Very well, the remainder you will dispose of among private individuals.\nFor the present, make me out a contract of sale, payment to be made in\nfour days.\"\n\n\"I entreat you to reflect, madame; for if you force the sale, you will\nlose a hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"If necessary, I will lose two hundred; I wish everything to be settled\nthis evening. Do you accept?\"\n\n\"I do, your ladyship. I will not conceal from you that I shall make\nfifty thousand francs by the transaction.\"\n\n\"So much the better for you. In what way shall I have the money?\"\n\n\"Either in gold, or in bills of the bank of Lyons, payable at M.\nColbert's.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said the marquise, eagerly; \"return home and bring the sum in\nquestion in notes, as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, but for Heaven's sake--\"\n\n\"Not a word, M. Faucheux. By the by, I was forgetting the silver plate.\nWhat is the value of that which I have?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand francs, madame.\"\n\n\"That makes a million,\" said the marquise to herself. \"M. Faucheux, you\nwill take away with you both the gold and silver plate. I can assign, as\na pretext, that I wish it remodeled on patters more in accordance with\nmy own taste. Melt it down, and return me its value in money, at once.\"\n\n\"It shall be done, your ladyship.\"\n\n\"You will be good enough to place the money in a chest, and direct one\nof your clerks to accompany the chest, and without my servants seeing\nhim; and order him to wait for me in a carriage.\"\n\n\"In Madame de Faucheux's carriage?\" said the jeweler.\n\n\"If you will allow it, and I will call for it at your house.\"\n\n\"Certainly, your ladyship.\"\n\n\"I will direct some of my servants to convey the plate to your house.\"\nThe marquise rung. \"Let the small van be placed at M. Faucheux's\ndisposal,\" she said. The jeweler bowed and left the house, directing\nthat the van should follow him closely, saying aloud, that the marquise\nwas about to have her plate melted down in order to have other plate\nmanufactured of a more modern style. Three hours afterwards she went to\nM. Faucheux's house and received from him eight hundred francs in gold\ninclosed in a chest, which one of the clerks could hardly carry towards\nMadame Faucheux's carriage--for Madame Faucheux kept her carriage. As\nthe daughter of a president of accounts, she had brought a marriage\nportion of thirty thousand crowns to her husband, who was syndic of the\ngoldsmiths. These thirty thousand crowns had become very fruitful during\ntwenty years. The jeweler, though a _millionaire_, was a modest man. He\nhad purchased a substantial carriage, built in 1648, ten years after the\nking's birth. This carriage, or rather house upon wheels, excited the\nadmiration of the whole quarter in which he resided--it was covered\nwith allegorical paintings, and clouds scattered over with stars. The\nmarquise entered this somewhat extraordinary vehicle, sitting opposite\nthe clerk, who endeavored to put his knees out of the way, afraid even\nof touching the marquise's dress. It was the clerk, too, who told the\ncoachman, who was very proud of having a marquise to drive, to take the\nroad to Saint-Mande.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII. The Dowry.\n\nMonsieur Faucheux's horses were serviceable animals, with thickset knees\nand legs that had some difficulty in moving. Like the carriage, they\nbelonged to the earlier part of the century. They were not as fleet as\nthe English horses of M. Fouquet, and consequently it took two hours\nto get to Saint-Mande. Their progress, it might be said, was majestic.\nMajesty, however, precludes hurry. The marquise stopped the carriage at\nthe door so well known to her, although she had seen it only once, under\ncircumstances, it will now be remembered, no less painful than those\nwhich brought her now to it again. She drew a key from her pocket,\nand inserted it into the lock, pushed open the door, which noiselessly\nyielded to her touch, and directed the clerk to carry the chest upstairs\nto the first floor. The weight of the chest was so great that the clerk\nwas obliged to get the coachman to assist him with it. They placed it\nin a small cabinet, ante-room, or boudoir rather, adjoining the saloon\nwhere we once saw M. Fouquet at the marquise's feet. Madame de Belliere\ngave the coachman a louis, smiled gracefully at the clerk, and dismissed\nthem both. She closed the door after them, and waited in the room, alone\nand barricaded. There was no servant to be seen about the rooms, but\neverything was prepared as though some invisible genius had divined the\nwishes and desires of an expected guest. The fire was laid, candles\nin the candelabra, refreshments upon the table, books scattered about,\nfresh-cut flowers in the vases. One might almost have imagined it an\nenchanted house.\n\nThe marquise lighted the candles, inhaled the perfume of the flowers,\nsat down, and was soon plunged in profound thought. Her deep musings,\nmelancholy though they were, were not untinged with a certain vague joy.\nSpread out before her was a treasure, a million wrung from her fortune\nas a gleaner plucks the blue corn-flower from her crown of flowers. She\nconjured up the sweetest dreams. Her principal thought, and one that\ntook precedence of all others, was to devise means of leaving this money\nfor M. Fouquet without his possibly learning from whom the gift had\ncome. This idea, naturally enough, was the first to present itself to\nher mind. But although, on reflection, it appeared difficult to carry\nout, she did not despair of success. She would then ring to summon M.\nFouquet and make her escape, happier than if, instead of having given\na million, she had herself found one. But, being there, and having seen\nthe boudoir so coquettishly decorated that it might almost be said the\nleast particle of dust had but the moment before been removed by the\nservants; having observed the drawing-room, so perfectly arranged that\nit might almost be said her presence there had driven away the fairies\nwho were its occupants, she asked herself if the glance or gaze of\nthose whom she had displaced--whether spirits, fairies, elves, or human\ncreatures--had not already recognized her. To secure success, it\nwas necessary that some steps should be seriously taken, and it was\nnecessary also that the superintendent should comprehend the serious\nposition in which he was placed, in order to yield compliance with\nthe generous fancies of a woman; all the fascinations of an eloquent\nfriendship would be required to persuade him, and, should this be\ninsufficient, the maddening influence of a devoted passion, which, in\nits resolute determination to carry conviction, would not be turned\naside. Was not the superintendent, indeed, known for his delicacy and\ndignity of feeling? Would he allow himself to accept from any woman that\nof which she had stripped herself? No! He would resist, and if any voice\nin the world could overcome his resistance, it would be the voice of the\nwoman he loved.\n\nAnother doubt, and that a cruel one, suggested itself to Madame de\nBelliere with a sharp, acute pain, like a dagger thrust. Did he really\nlove her? Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to\nbe fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel? Was it not\nthe same with Fouquet, notwithstanding his genius and his uprightness of\nconduct, as with those conquerors on the field of battle who shed tears\nwhen they have gained a victory? \"I must learn if it be so, and must\njudge of that for myself,\" said the marquise. \"Who can tell whether that\nheart, so coveted, is not common in its impulses, and full of alloy? Who\ncan tell if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not\nbe found of a mean and vulgar character? Come, come,\" she said, \"this\nis doubting and hesitation too much--to the proof,\" she said, looking\nat the timepiece. \"It is now seven o'clock,\" she said; \"he must have\narrived; it is the hour for signing his papers.\" With a feverish\nimpatience she rose and walked towards the mirror, in which she smiled\nwith a resolute smile of devotedness; she touched the spring and drew\nout the handle of the bell. Then, as if exhausted beforehand by the\nstruggle she had just undergone, she threw herself on her knees, in\nutter abandonment, before a large couch, in which she buried her face in\nher trembling hands. Ten minutes afterwards she heard the spring of the\ndoor sound. The door moved upon invisible hinges, and Fouquet appeared.\nHe looked pale, and seemed bowed down by the weight of some bitter\nreflection. He did not hurry, but simply came at the summons. The\npreoccupation of his mind must indeed have been very great, that a\nman, so devoted to pleasure, for whom indeed pleasure meant everything,\nshould obey such a summons so listlessly. The previous night, in fact,\nfertile in melancholy ideas, had sharpened his features, generally so\nnoble in their indifference of expression, and had traced dark lines\nof anxiety around his eyes. Handsome and noble he still was, and the\nmelancholy expression of his mouth, a rare expression with men, gave a\nnew character to his features, by which his youth seemed to be renewed.\nDressed in black, the lace in front of his chest much disarranged by\nhis feverishly restless hand, the looks of the superintendent, full of\ndreamy reflection, were fixed upon the threshold of the room which\nhe had so frequently approached in search of expected happiness. This\ngloomy gentleness of manner, this smiling sadness of expression, which\nhad replaced his former excessive joy, produced an indescribable effect\nupon Madame de Belliere, who was regarding him at a distance.\n\nA woman's eye can read the face of the man she loves, its every feeling\nof pride, its every expression of suffering; it might almost be said\nthat Heaven has graciously granted to women, on account of their very\nweakness, more than it has accorded to other creatures. They can conceal\ntheir own feelings from a man, but from them no man can conceal his. The\nmarquise divined in a single glace the whole weight of the unhappiness\nof the superintendent. She divined a night passed without sleep, a day\npassed in deceptions. From that moment she was firm in her own strength,\nand she felt that she loved Fouquet beyond everything else. She arose\nand approached him, saying, \"You wrote to me this morning to say you\nwere beginning to forget me, and that I, whom you had not seen lately,\nhad no doubt ceased to think of you. I have come to undeceive you,\nmonsieur, and the more completely so, because there is one thing I can\nread in your eyes.\"\n\n\"What is that, madame?\" said Fouquet, astonished.\n\n\"That you have never loved me so much as at this moment; in the same\nmanner you can read, in my present step towards you, that I have not\nforgotten you.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame,\" said Fouquet, whose face was for a moment lighted up by\na sudden gleam of joy, \"you are indeed an angel, and no man can\nsuspect you. All he can do is to humble himself before you and entreat\nforgiveness.\"\n\n\"Your forgiveness is granted, then,\" said the marquise. Fouquet was\nabout to throw himself upon his knees. \"No, no,\" she said, \"sit here by\nmy side. Ah! that is an evil thought which has just crossed your mind.\"\n\n\"How do you detect it, madame?\"\n\n\"By the smile that has just marred the expression of your countenance.\nBe candid, and tell me what your thought was--no secrets between\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, madame, why you have been so harsh these three or four\nmonths past?\"\n\n\"Harsh?\"\n\n\"Yes; did you not forbid me to visit you?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Madame de Belliere, sighing, \"because your visit to me\nwas the cause of your being visited with a great misfortune; because my\nhouse is watched; because the same eyes that have seen you already might\nsee you again; because I think it less dangerous for you that I should\ncome here than that you should come to my house; and, lastly, because\nI know you to be already unhappy enough not to wish to increase your\nunhappiness further.\"\n\nFouquet started, for these words recalled all the anxieties connected\nwith his office of superintendent--he who, for the last few minutes, had\nindulged in all the wild aspirations of the lover. \"I unhappy?\" he said,\nendeavoring to smile: \"indeed, marquise, you will almost make me believe\nI am so, judging from your own sadness. Are your beautiful eyes raised\nupon me merely in pity? I was looking for another expression from them.\"\n\n\"It is not I who am sad, monsieur; look in the mirror, there--it is\nyourself.\"\n\n\"It is true I am somewhat pale, marquise; but it is from overwork; the\nking yesterday required a supply of money from me.\"\n\n\"Yes, four millions; I am aware of it.\"\n\n\"You know it?\" exclaimed Fouquet, in a tone of surprise; \"how can you\nhave learnt it? It was after the departure of the queen, and in the\npresence of one person only, that the king--\"\n\n\"You perceive that I do know it; is that not sufficient? Well, go on,\nmonsieur, the money the king has required you to supply--\"\n\n\"You understand, marquise, that I have been obliged to procure it, then\nto get it counted, afterwards registered--altogether a long affair.\nSince Monsieur de Mazarin's death, financial affairs occasion some\nlittle fatigue and embarrassment. My administration is somewhat\novertaxed, and this is the reason why I have not slept during the past\nnight.\"\n\n\"So you have the amount?\" inquired the marquise, with some anxiety.\n\n\"It would indeed be strange, marquise,\" replied Fouquet, cheerfully, \"if\na superintendent of finances were not to have a paltry four millions in\nhis coffers.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I believe you either have, or will have them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by saying I shall have them?\"\n\n\"It is not very long since you were required to furnish two millions.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it seems almost an age; but do not let us talk of\nmoney matters any longer.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, we will continue to speak of them, for that is my only\nreason for coming to see you.\"\n\n\"I am at a loss to compass your meaning,\" said the superintendent, whose\neyes began to express an anxious curiosity.\n\n\"Tell me, monsieur, is the office of superintendent a permanent\nposition?\"\n\n\"You surprise me, marchioness, for you speak as if you had some motive\nor interest in putting the question.\"\n\n\"My reason is simple enough; I am desirous of placing some money in your\nhands, and naturally I wish to know if you are certain of your post.\"\n\n\"Really, marquise, I am at a loss what to reply; I cannot conceive your\nmeaning.\"\n\n\"Seriously, then, dear M. Fouquet, I have certain funds which somewhat\nembarrass me. I am tired of investing my money in lands, and am anxious\nto intrust it to some friend who will turn it to account.\"\n\n\"Surely it does not press,\" said M. Fouquet.\n\n\"On the contrary, it is very pressing.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will talk of that by and by.\"\n\n\"By and by will not do, for my money is there,\" returned the marquise,\npointing out the coffer to the superintendent, and showing him, as she\nopened it, the bundles of notes and heaps of gold. Fouquet, who had\nrisen from his seat at the same moment as Madame de Belliere, remained\nfor a moment plunged in thought; then suddenly starting back, he turned\npale, and sank down in his chair, concealing his face in his hands.\n\"Madame, madame,\" he murmured, \"what opinion can you have of me, when\nyou make me such an offer?\"\n\n\"Of you!\" returned the marquise. \"Tell me, rather, what you yourself\nthink of the step I have taken.\"\n\n\"You bring me this money for myself, and you bring it because you know\nme to be embarrassed. Nay, do not deny it, for I am sure of it. Can I\nnot read your heart?\"\n\n\"If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer\nyou?\"\n\n\"I have guessed rightly, then,\" exclaimed Fouquet. \"In truth, madame, I\nhave never yet given you the right to insult me in this manner.\"\n\n\"Insult you,\" she said, turning pale, \"what singular delicacy of\nfeeling! You tell me you love me; in the name of that affection you wish\nme to sacrifice my reputation and my honor, yet, when I offer you money\nwhich is my own, you refuse me.\"\n\n\"Madame, you are at liberty to preserve what you term your reputation\nand your honor. Permit me to preserve mine. Leave me to my ruin, leave\nme to sink beneath the weight of the hatreds which surround me, beneath\nthe faults I have committed, beneath the load, even, of my remorse,\nbut, for Heaven's sake, madame, do not overwhelm me with this last\ninfliction.\"\n\n\"A short time since, M. Fouquet, you were wanting in judgment; now you\nare wanting in feeling.\"\n\nFouquet pressed his clenched hand upon his breast, heaving with emotion,\nsaying: \"overwhelm me, madame, for I have nothing to reply.\"\n\n\"I offered you my friendship, M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, and you limited yourself to that.\"\n\n\"And what I am now doing is the act of a friend.\"\n\n\"No doubt it is.\"\n\n\"And you reject this mark of my friendship?\"\n\n\"I do reject it.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Fouquet, look at me,\" said the marquise, with glistening eyes,\n\"I now offer you my love.\"\n\n\"Oh, madame,\" exclaimed Fouquet.\n\n\"I have loved you for a long while past; women, like men, have a false\ndelicacy at times. For a long time past I have loved you, but would not\nconfess it. Well, then, you have implored this love on your knees, and I\nhave refused you; I was blind, as you were a little while since; but as\nit was my love that you sought, it is my love I now offer you.\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, you overwhelm me beneath a load of happiness.\"\n\n\"Will you be happy, then, if I am yours--entirely?\"\n\n\"It will be the supremest happiness for me.\"\n\n\"Take me, then. If, however, for your sake I sacrifice a prejudice, do\nyou, for mine, sacrifice a scruple.\"\n\n\"Do not tempt me.\"\n\n\"Do not refuse me.\"\n\n\"Think seriously of what you are proposing.\"\n\n\"Fouquet, but one word. Let it be 'No,' and I open this door,\" and she\npointed to the door which led into the streets, \"and you will never see\nme again. Let that word be 'Yes,' and I am yours entirely.\"\n\n\"Elise! Elise! But this coffer?\"\n\n\"Contains my dowry.\"\n\n\"It is your ruin,\" exclaimed Fouquet, turning over the gold and papers;\n\"there must be a million here.\"\n\n\"Yes, my jewels, for which I care no longer if you do not love me, and\nfor which, equally, I care no longer if you love me as I love you.\"\n\n\"This is too much,\" exclaimed Fouquet. \"I yield, I yield, even were it\nonly to consecrate so much devotion. I accept the dowry.\"\n\n\"And take the woman with it,\" said the marquise, throwing herself into\nhis arms.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX. Le Terrain de Dieu.\n\nDuring the progress of these events Buckingham and De Wardes traveled\nin excellent companionship, and made the journey from Paris to Calais in\nundisturbed harmony together. Buckingham had hurried his departure, so\nthat the greater part of his _adieux_ were very hastily made. His visit\nto Monsieur and Madame, to the young queen, and to the queen-dowager,\nhad been paid collectively--a precaution on the part of the queen-mother\nwhich saved him the distress of any private conversation with Monsieur,\nand also the danger of seeing Madame again. The carriages containing the\nluggage had already been sent on beforehand, and in the evening he set\noff in his traveling carriage with his attendants.\n\nDe Wardes, irritated at finding himself dragged away in so abrupt a\nmanner by this Englishman, had sought in his subtle mind for some\nmeans of escaping from his fetters; but no one having rendered him any\nassistance in this respect, he was absolutely obliged, therefore, to\nsubmit to the burden of his own evil thoughts and caustic spirit.\n\nSuch of his friends in whom he had been able to confide, had, in their\ncharacter of wits, rallied him upon the duke's superiority. Others,\nless brilliant, but more sensible, had reminded him of the king's orders\nprohibiting dueling. Others, again, and they the larger number, who,\nin virtue of charity, or national vanity, might have rendered him\nassistance, did not care to run the risk of incurring disgrace, and\nwould, at the best, have informed the ministers of a departure which\nmight end in a massacre on a small scale. The result was, that, after\nhaving fully deliberated upon the matter, De Wardes packed up his\nluggage, took a couple of horses, and, followed only by one servant,\nmade his way towards the barrier, where Buckingham's carriage was to\nawait him.\n\nThe duke received his adversary as he would have done an intimate\nacquaintance, made room beside him on the same seat with himself,\noffered him refreshments, and spread over his knees the sable cloak that\nhad been thrown on the front seat. They then conversed of the court,\nwithout alluding to Madame; of Monsieur, without speaking of domestic\naffairs; of the king, without speaking of his brother's wife; of the\nqueen-mother, without alluding to her daughter-in-law; of the king of\nEngland, without alluding to his sister; of the state of the affections\nof either of the travelers, without pronouncing any name that might be\ndangerous. In this way the journey, which was performed by short stages,\nwas most agreeable, and Buckingham, almost a Frenchman from wit and\neducation, was delighted at having so admirably selected his traveling\ncompanion. Elegant repasts were served, of which they partook but\nlightly; trials of horses made in the beautiful meadows that skirted the\nroad; coursing indulged in, for Buckingham had his greyhounds with him;\nand in such ways did they pass away the pleasant time. The duke somewhat\nresembled the beautiful river Seine, which folds France a thousand times\nin its loving embrace, before deciding upon joining its waters with the\nocean. In quitting France, it was her recently adopted daughter he had\nbrought to Paris whom he chiefly regretted; his every thought was a\nremembrance of her--his every memory a regret. Therefore, whenever, now\nand then, despite his command over himself, he was lost in thought,\nDe Wardes left him entirely to his musings. This delicacy might have\ntouched Buckingham, and changed his feelings towards De Wardes, if\nthe latter, while preserving silence, had shown a glance less full\nof malice, and a smile less false. Instinctive dislikes, however,\nare relentless; nothing appeases them; a few ashes may, sometimes,\napparently, extinguish them; but beneath those ashes the smothered\nembers rage more furiously. Having exhausted every means of amusement\nthe route offered, they arrived, as we have said, at Calais towards the\nend of the sixth day. The duke's attendants, since the previous evening,\nhad traveled in advance, and now chartered a boat, for the purpose\nof joining the yacht, which had been tacking about in sight, or\nbore broadside on, whenever it felt its white wings wearied, within\ncannon-shot of the jetty.\n\nThe boat was destined for the transport of the duke's equipages from the\nshore to the yacht. The horses had been embarked, having been hoisted\nfrom the boat upon the deck in baskets, expressly made for the purpose,\nand wadded in such a manner that their limbs, even in the most violent\nfits of terror or impatience, were always protected by the soft support\nwhich the sides afforded, and their coats not even turned. Eight of\nthese baskets, placed side by side, filled the ship's hold. It is well\nknown that, in short voyages horses refuse to eat, but remain trembling\nall the while, with the best of food before them, such as they would\nhave greatly coveted on land. By degrees, the duke's entire equipage was\ntransported on board the yacht; he was then informed that everything was\nin readiness, and that they only waited for him, whenever he would be\ndisposed to embark with the French gentleman; for no one could possibly\nimagine that the French gentleman would have any other accounts to\nsettle with his Grace other than those of friendship. Buckingham desired\nthe captain to be told to hold himself in readiness, but that, as the\nsea was beautiful, and as the day promised a splendid sunset, he did not\nintend to go on board until nightfall, and would avail himself of the\nevening to enjoy a walk on the strand. He added also, that, finding\nhimself in such excellent company, he had not the least desire to hasten\nhis embarkation.\n\nAs he said this he pointed out to those who surrounded him the\nmagnificent spectacle which the sky presented, of deepest azure in the\nhorizon, the amphitheatre of fleecy clouds ascending from the sun's disc\nto the zenith, assuming the appearance of a range of snowy mountains,\nwhose summits were heaped one upon another. The dome of clouds was\ntinged at its base with, as it were, the foam of rubies, fading away\ninto opal and pearly tints, in proportion as the gaze was carried from\nbase to summit. The sea was gilded with the same reflection, and upon\nthe crest of every sparkling wave danced a point of light, like a\ndiamond by lamplight. The mildness of the evening, the sea breezes, so\ndear to contemplative minds, setting in from the east and blowing in\ndelicious gusts; then, in the distance, the black outline of the yacht\nwith its rigging traced upon the empurpled background of the sky--while,\ndotting the horizon, might be seen, here and there, vessels with their\ntrimmed sails, like the wings of a seagull about to plunge; such a\nspectacle indeed well merited admiration. A crowd of curious idlers\nfollowed the richly dressed attendants, amongst whom they mistook\nthe steward and the secretary for the master and his friend. As for\nBuckingham, who was dressed very simply, in a gray satin vest, and\ndoublet of violet-colored velvet, wearing his hat thrust over his eyes,\nand without orders or embroidery, he was taken no more notice of than De\nWardes, who was in black, like an attorney.\n\nThe duke's attendants had received directions to have a boat in\nreadiness at the jetty head, and to watch the embarkation of their\nmaster, without approaching him until either he or his friend should\nsummon them,--\"whatever may happen,\" he had added, laying a stress upon\nthese words, so that they might not be misunderstood. Having walked a\nfew paces upon the strand, Buckingham said to De Wardes, \"I think it is\nnow time to take leave of each other. The tide, you perceive, is rising;\nten minutes hence it will have soaked the sands where we are now walking\nin such a manner that we shall not be able to keep our footing.\"\n\n\"I await your orders, my lord, but--\"\n\n\"But, you mean, we are still upon soil which is part of the king's\nterritory.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, do you see yonder a kind of little island surrounded by a circle\nof water? The pool is increasing every minute, and the isle is gradually\ndisappearing. This island, indeed, belongs to Heaven, for it is situated\nbetween two seas, and is not shown on the king's charts. Do you observe\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes; but we can hardly reach it now, without getting our feet wet.\"\n\n\"Yes; but observe that it forms an eminence tolerably high, and that the\ntide rises up on every side, leaving the top free. We shall be admirably\nplaced upon that little theatre. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I shall be perfectly happy wherever I may have the honor of crossing my\nsword with your lordship's.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I am distressed to be the cause of your wetting your\nfeet, M. de Wardes, but it is most essential you should be able to say\nto the king: 'Sire, I did not fight upon your majesty's territory.'\nPerhaps the distinction is somewhat subtle, but, since Port-Royal, your\nnation delights in subtleties of expression. Do not let us complain\nof this, however, for it makes your wit very brilliant, and of a style\npeculiarly your own. If you do not object, we will hurry ourselves, for\nthe sea, I perceive, is rising fast, and night is setting in.\"\n\n\"My reason for not walking faster was, that I did not wish to precede\nyour Grace. Are you still on dry land, my lord?\"\n\n\"Yes, at present I am. Look yonder! My servants are afraid we shall be\ndrowned, and have converted the boat into a cruiser. Do you remark how\ncuriously it dances upon the crests of the waves? But, as it makes me\nfeel sea-sick, would you permit me to turn my back towards them?\"\n\n\"You will observe, my lord, that in turning your back to them, you will\nhave the sun full in your face.\"\n\n\"Oh, its rays are very feeble at this hour and it will soon disappear;\ndo not be uneasy on that score.\"\n\n\"As you please, my lord; it was out of consideration for your lordship\nthat I made the remark.\"\n\n\"I am aware of that, M. de Wardes, and I fully appreciate your kindness.\nShall we take off our doublets?\"\n\n\"As you please, my lord.\"\n\n\"Do not hesitate to tell me, M. de Wardes, if you do not feel\ncomfortable upon the wet sand, or if you think yourself a little too\nclose to French territory. We could fight in England, or even upon my\nyacht.\"\n\n\"We are exceedingly well placed here, my lord; only I have the honor to\nremark that, as the sea is rising fast, we have hardly time--\"\n\nBuckingham made a sign of assent, took off his doublet and threw it on\nthe ground, a proceeding which De Wardes imitated. Both their bodies,\nwhich seemed like phantoms to those who were looking at them from the\nshore, were thrown strongly into relief by a dark red violet-colored\nshadow with which the sky became overspread.\n\n\"Upon my word, your Grace,\" said De Wardes, \"we shall hardly have time\nto begin. Do you not perceive how our feet are sinking into the sand?\"\n\n\"I have sunk up to the ankles,\" said Buckingham, \"without reckoning that\nthe water is even now breaking in upon us.\"\n\n\"It has already reached me. As soon as you please, therefore, your\nGrace,\" said De Wardes, who drew his sword, a movement imitated by the\nduke.\n\n\"M. de Wardes,\" said Buckingham, \"one final word. I am about to\nfight you because I do not like you,--because you have wounded me in\nridiculing a certain devotional regard I have entertained, and one which\nI acknowledge that, at this moment, I still retain, and for which I\nwould very willingly die. You are a bad and heartless man, M. de Wardes,\nand I will do my very utmost to take your life; for I feel assured that,\nif you survive this engagement, you will, in the future, work great\nmischief towards my friends. That is all I have to remark, M. de\nWardes,\" concluded Buckingham as he saluted him.\n\n\"And I, my lord, have only this to reply to you: I have not disliked you\nhitherto, but, since you give me such a character, I hate you, and will\ndo all I possibly can to kill you;\" and De Wardes saluted Buckingham.\n\nTheir swords crossed at the same moment, like two flashes of lightning\non a dark night. The swords seemed to seek each other, guessed their\nposition, and met. Both were practiced swordsmen, and the earlier passes\nwere without any result. The night was fast closing in, and it was so\ndark that they attacked and defended themselves almost instinctively.\nSuddenly De Wardes felt his word arrested,--he had just touched\nBuckingham's shoulder. The duke's sword sunk, as his arm was lowered.\n\n\"You are wounded, my lord,\" said De Wardes, drawing back a step or two.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, but only slightly.\"\n\n\"Yet you quitted your guard.\"\n\n\"Only from the first effect of the cold steel, but I have recovered.\nLet us go on, if you please.\" And disengaging his sword with a sinister\nclashing of the blade, the duke wounded the marquis in the breast.\n\n\"A hit?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" cried De Wardes, not moving from his place.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but observing that your shirt was stained--\" said\nBuckingham.\n\n\"Well,\" said De Wardes furiously, \"it is now your turn.\"\n\nAnd with a terrible lunge, he pierced Buckingham's arm, the sword\npassing between the two bones. Buckingham feeling his right arm\nparalyzed, stretched out his left, seized his sword, which was about\nfalling from his nerveless grasp, and before De Wardes could resume his\nguard, he thrust him through the breast. De Wardes tottered, his knees\ngave way beneath him, and leaving his sword still fixed in the duke's\narm, he fell into the water, which was soon crimsoned with a more\ngenuine reflection than that which it had borrowed from the clouds. De\nWardes was not dead; he felt the terrible danger that menaced him, for\nthe sea rose fast. The duke, too, perceived the danger. With an effort\nand an exclamation of pain he tore out the blade which remained in his\narm, and turning towards De Wardes said, \"Are you dead, marquis?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied De Wardes, in a voice choked by the blood which rushed\nfrom his lungs to his throat, \"but very near it.\"\n\n\"Well, what is to be done; can you walk?\" said Buckingham, supporting\nhim on his knee.\n\n\"Impossible,\" he replied. Then falling down again, said, \"call to your\npeople, or I shall be drowned.\"\n\n\"Halloa! boat there! quick, quick!\"\n\nThe boat flew over the waves, but the sea rose faster than the boat\ncould approach. Buckingham saw that De Wardes was on the point of being\nagain covered by a wave; he passed his left arm, safe and unwounded,\nround his body and raised him up. The wave ascended to his waist,\nbut did not move him. The duke immediately began to carry his late\nantagonist towards the shore. He had hardly gone ten paces, when a\nsecond wave, rushing onwards higher, more furious and menacing than the\nformer, struck him at the height of his chest, threw him over and buried\nhim beneath the water. At the reflux, however, the duke and De Wardes\nwere discovered lying on the strand. De Wardes had fainted. At this\nmoment four of the duke's sailors, who comprehended the danger, threw\nthemselves into the sea, and in a moment were close beside him. Their\nterror was extreme when they observed how their master became covered\nwith blood, in proportion to the water, with which it was impregnated,\nflowed towards his knees and feet; they wished to carry him.\n\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed the duke, \"take the marquis on shore first.\"\n\n\"Death to the Frenchman!\" cried the English sullenly.\n\n\"Wretched knaves!\" exclaimed the duke, drawing himself up with a haughty\ngesture, which sprinkled them with blood, \"obey directly! M. de Wardes\non shore! M. de Wardes's safety to be looked to first, or I will have\nyou all hanged!\"\n\nThe boat had by this time reached them; the secretary and steward leaped\ninto the sea, and approached the marquis, who no longer showed any sign\nof life.\n\n\"I commit him to your care, as you value your lives,\" said the duke.\n\"Take M. de Wardes on shore.\" They took him in their arms, and carried\nhim to the dry sand, where the tide never rose so high. A few idlers\nand five or six fishermen had gathered on the shore, attracted by the\nstrange spectacle of two men fighting with the water up to their knees.\nThe fishermen, observing a group of men approaching carrying a wounded\nman, entered the sea until the water was up to their waists. The English\ntransferred the wounded man to them, at the very moment the latter began\nto open his eyes again. The salt water and the fine sand had got into\nhis wounds, and caused him the acutest pain. The duke's secretary drew\nout a purse filled with gold from his pocket, and handed it to the one\namong those present who appeared of most importance, saying: \"From my\nmaster, his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, in order that every possible\ncare may be taken of the Marquis de Wardes.\"\n\nThen, followed by those who had accompanied him, he returned to the\nboat, which Buckingham had been enabled to reach with the greatest\ndifficulty, but only after he had seen De Wardes out of danger. By this\ntime it was high tide; embroidered coats, and silk sashes were lost;\nmany hats, too, had been carried away by the waves. The flow of the tide\nhad borne the duke's and De Wardes's clothes to the shore, and De Wardes\nwas wrapped in the duke's doublet, under the belief that it was his own,\nwhen the fishermen carried him in their arms towards the town.\n\n\n\nChapter XXX. Threefold Love.\n\nAs soon as Buckingham departed, Guiche imagined the coast would be\nperfectly clear for him without any interference. Monsieur, who no\nlonger retained the slightest feeling of jealousy, and who, besides,\npermitted himself to be monopolized by the Chevalier de Lorraine,\nallowed as much liberty and freedom in his house as the most exacting\ncould desire. The king, on his side, who had conceived a strong\npredilection for his sister-in-law's society, invented a variety of\namusements, in quick succession to each other, in order to render her\nresidence in Paris as cheerful as possible, so that in fact, not a day\npassed without a ball at the Palais Royal, or a reception in Monsieur's\napartments. The king had directed that Fontainebleau should be prepared\nfor the reception of the court, and every one was using his utmost\ninterest to get invited. Madame led a life of incessant occupation;\nneither her voice nor her pen were idle for a moment. The conversations\nwith De Guiche were gradually assuming a tone of interest which might\nunmistakably be recognized as the prelude of a deep-seated attachment.\nWhen eyes look languishingly while the subject under discussion happens\nto be colors of materials for dresses; when a whole hour is occupied in\nanalyzing the merits and the perfume of a _sachet_ or a flower;--there\nare words in this style of conversation which every one might listen to,\nbut there are gestures and sighs that every one cannot perceive. After\nMadame had talked for some time with De Guiche, she conversed with\nthe king, who paid her a visit regularly every day. They played, wrote\nverses, or selected mottoes or emblematical devices; this spring was\nnot only the Maytide of nature, it was the youth of an entire people, of\nwhich those at court were the head. The king was handsome, young, and of\nunequaled gallantry. All women were passionately loved by him, even the\nqueen, his wife. This mighty monarch was, however, more timid and more\nreserved than any other person in the kingdom, to such a degree, indeed,\nthat he did not confess his sentiments even to himself. This timidity of\nbearing restrained him within the limits of ordinary politeness, and no\nwoman could boast of having any preference shown her beyond that shown\nto others. It might be foretold that the day when his real character\nwould be displayed would be the dawn of a new sovereignty; but as yet\nhe had not declared himself. M. de Guiche took advantage of this, and\nconstituted himself the sovereign prince of the whole laughter-loving\ncourt. It had been reported that he was on the best of terms with\nMademoiselle de Montalais; that he had been assiduously attentive to\nMademoiselle de Chatillon; but now he was not even barely civil to any\nof the court beauties. He had eyes and ears for one person alone. In\nthis manner, and, as it were, without design, he devoted himself to\nMonsieur, who had a great regard for him, and kept him as much as\npossible in his own apartments. Unsociable from natural disposition, he\nhad estranged himself too much previous to the arrival of Madame,\nbut, after her arrival, he did not estrange himself sufficiently. This\nconduct, which every one had observed, had been particularly remarked\nby the evil genius of the house, the Chevalier de Lorraine, for whom\nMonsieur exhibited the warmest attachment because he was of a very\ncheerful disposition, even in his remarks most full of malice, and\nbecause he was never at a loss how to wile the time away. The Chevalier\nde Lorraine, therefore, having noticed that he was threatened with being\nsupplanted by De Guiche, resorted to strong measures. He disappeared\nfrom the court, leaving Monsieur much embarrassed. The first day of his\nabsence, Monsieur hardly inquired about him, for he had De Guiche with\nhim, and, except that the time given to conversation with Madame, his\ndays and nights were rigorously devoted to the prince. On the second\nday, however, Monsieur, finding no one near him, inquired where the\nchevalier was. He was told that no one knew.\n\nDe Guiche, after having spent the morning in selecting embroideries and\nfringes with Madame, went to console the prince. But after dinner,\nas there were some amethysts to be looked at, De Guiche returned to\nMadame's cabinet. Monsieur was left quite to himself during the time\ndevoted to dressing and decorating himself; he felt that he was the most\nmiserable of men, and again inquired whether there was any news of the\nchevalier, in reply to which he was told that no one could tell\nwhere the chevalier was to be found. Monsieur, hardly knowing in what\ndirection to inflict his weariness, went to Madame's apartments dressed\nin his morning-gown. He found a large assemblage of people there,\nlaughing and whispering in every part of the room; at one end, a group\nof women around one of the courtiers, talking together, amid smothered\nbursts of laughter; at the other end, Manicamp and Malicorne were being\npillaged at cards by Montalais and Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,\nwhile two others were standing by, laughing. In another part were\nMadame, seated upon some cushions on the floor, and De Guiche, on his\nknees beside her, spreading out a handful of pearls and precious stones,\nwhile the princess, with her white and slender fingers pointed out such\namong them as pleased her the most. Again, in another corner of the\nroom, a guitar player was playing some of the Spanish seguedillas, to\nwhich Madame had taken the greatest fancy ever since she had heard them\nsung by the young queen with a melancholy expression of voice. But the\nsongs which the Spanish princess had sung with tears in her eyes, the\nyoung Englishwoman was humming with a smile that well displayed her\nbeautiful teeth. The cabinet presented, in fact, the most perfect\nrepresentation of unrestrained pleasure and amusement. As he entered,\nMonsieur was struck at beholding so many persons enjoying themselves\nwithout him. He was so jealous at the sight that he could not resist\nexclaiming, like a child, \"What! you are amusing yourselves here, while\nI am sick and tired of being alone!\"\n\nThe sound of his voice was like a clap of thunder coming to interrupt\nthe warbling of birds under the leafy covert of the trees; a dead\nsilence ensued. De Guiche was on his feet in a moment. Malicorne tried\nto hide himself behind Montalais. Manicamp stood bolt upright, and\nassumed a very ceremonious demeanor. The guitar player thrust his\ninstrument under a table, covering it with a piece of carpet to conceal\nit from the prince's observation. Madame was the only one who did\nnot move, and smiling at her husband, said, \"Is not this the hour you\nusually devote to your toilette?\"\n\n\"An hour which others select, it seems, for amusing themselves,\" replied\nthe prince, grumblingly.\n\nThis untoward remark was the signal for a general rout; the women fled\nlike a flock of terrified starlings; the guitar player vanished like a\nshadow; Malicorne, still protected by Montalais, who purposely widened\nout her dress, glided behind the hanging tapestry. As for Manicamp, he\nwent to the assistance of De Guiche, who naturally remained near Madame,\nand both of them, with the princess herself, courageously sustained the\nattack. The count was too happy to bear malice against the husband;\nbut Monsieur bore a grudge against his wife. Nothing was wanting but a\nquarrel; he sought it, and the hurried departure of the crowd, which had\nbeen so joyous before he arrived, and was so disturbed by his entrance,\nfurnished him with a pretext.\n\n\"Why do they run away at the very sight of me?\" he inquired, in a\nsupercilious tone; to which remark Madame replied, that, \"whenever the\nmaster of the house made his appearance, the family kept aloof out of\nrespect.\" As she said this, she made so funny and so pretty a grimace,\nthat De Guiche and Manicamp could not control themselves; they burst\ninto a peal of laugher; Madame followed their example, and even Monsieur\nhimself could not resist it, and he was obliged to sit down, as, for\nlaughing, he could scarcely keep his equilibrium. However, he very soon\nleft off, but his anger had increased. He was still more furious because\nhe had permitted himself to laugh, than from having seen others laugh.\nHe looked at Manicamp steadily, not venturing to show his anger towards\nDe Guiche; but, at a sign which displayed no little amount of annoyance,\nManicamp and De Guiche left the room, so that Madame, left alone,\nbegan sadly to pick up her pearls and amethysts, no longer smiling, and\nspeaking still less.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" said the duke, \"to find myself treated as a stranger\nhere, Madame,\" and he left the room in a passion. On his way out, he met\nMontalais, who was in attendance in the ante-room. \"It is very agreeable\nto pay you a visit here, but outside the door.\"\n\nMontalais made a very low obeisance. \"I do not quite understand what\nyour royal highness does me the honor to say.\"\n\n\"I say that when you are all laughing together in Madame's apartment, he\nis an unwelcome visitor who does not remain outside.\"\n\n\"Your royal highness does not think, and does not speak so, of\nyourself?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is on my own account that I do speak and think. I\nhave no reason, certainly, to flatter myself about the reception I meet\nwith here at any time. How is it that, on the very day there is music\nand a little society in Madame's apartments--in my own apartments,\nindeed, for they are mine--on the very day that I wish to amuse myself a\nlittle in my turn, every one runs away? Are they afraid to see me, that\nthey all take wing as soon as I appear? Is there anything wrong, then,\ngoing on in my absence?\"\n\n\"Yet nothing has been done to-day, monseigneur, which is not done every\nday.\"\n\n\"What! do they laugh like that every day?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"The same group of people simpering and the same singing and strumming\ngoing on every day?\"\n\n\"The guitar, monseigneur, was introduced to-day; but when we have no\nguitars, we have violins and flutes; ladies soon weary without music.\"\n\n\"The deuce!--and the men?\"\n\n\"What men, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche, M. de Manicamp, and the rest of them?\"\n\n\"They all belong to your highness's household.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you are right,\" said the prince, as he returned to his own\napartments, full of thought. He threw himself into the largest of his\narm-chairs, without looking at himself in the glass. \"Where can the\nchevalier be?\" said he. One of the prince's attendants happened to be\nnear him, overheard his remark, and replied,--\n\n\"No one knows, your highness.\"\n\n\"Still the same answer. The first one who answers me again, 'I do not\nknow,' I will discharge.\" Every one at this remark hurried out of his\napartments, in the same manner as the others had fled from Madame's\napartments. The prince then flew into the wildest rage. He kicked over\na chiffonier, which tumbled on the carpet, broken into pieces. He next\nwent into the galleries, and with the greatest coolness threw down,\none after another, an enameled vase, a porphyry ewer, and a bronze\ncandelabrum. The noise summoned every one to the various doors.\n\n\"What is your highness's pleasure?\" said the captain of the guards,\ntimidly.\n\n\"I am treating myself to some music,\" replied the prince, gnashing his\nteeth.\n\nThe captain of the guards desired his royal highness's physician to be\nsent for. But before he came, Malicorne arrived, saying to the prince,\n\"Monseigneur, the Chevalier de Lorraine is here.\"\n\nThe duke looked at Malicorne, and smiled graciously at him, just as the\nchevalier entered.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI. M. de Lorraine's Jealousy.\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans uttered a cry of delight on perceiving the Chevalier\nde Lorraine. \"This is fortunate, indeed,\" he said; \"by what happy chance\ndo I see you? Had you indeed disappeared, as every one assured me?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A caprice?\"\n\n\"I to venture upon caprices with your highness! The respect--\"\n\n\"Put respect out of the way, for you fail in it every day. I absolve\nyou; but why did you leave me?\"\n\n\"Because I felt that I was of no further use to you.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Your highness has people about you who are far more amusing that _I_\ncan ever be. I felt I was not strong enough to enter into contest with\nthem, and I therefore withdrew.\"\n\n\"This extreme diffidence shows a want of common sense. Who are those\nwith whom you cannot contend? De Guiche?\"\n\n\"I name no one.\"\n\n\"This is absurd. Does De Guiche annoy you?\"\n\n\"I do not say he does; do not force me to speak, however; you know very\nwell that De Guiche is one of our best friends.\"\n\n\"Who is it, then?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, monseigneur, let us say no more about it.\" The chevalier\nknew perfectly well that curiosity is excited in the same way as thirst\n--by removing that which quenches it; or in other words, by denying an\nexplanation.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the prince; \"I wish to know why you went away.\"\n\n\"In that case, monseigneur, I will tell you; but do not get angry. I\nremarked that my presence was disagreeable.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To Madame.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said the duke in astonishment.\n\n\"It is simple enough; Madame is very probably jealous of the regard you\nare good enough to testify for me.\"\n\n\"Has she shown it to you?\"\n\n\"Madame never addresses a syllable to me, particularly since a certain\ntime.\"\n\n\"Since _what_ time?\"\n\n\"Since the time when, M. de Guiche having made himself more agreeable to\nher than I could, she receives him at every and any hour.\"\n\nThe duke colored. \"At any hour, chevalier; what do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"You see, your highness, I have already displeased you; I was quite sure\nI should.\"\n\n\"I am not displeased; but what you say is rather startling. In what\nrespect does Madame prefer De Guiche to you?\"\n\n\"I shall say no more,\" said the chevalier, saluting the prince\nceremoniously.\n\n\"On the contrary, I require you to speak. If you withdraw on that\naccount, you must indeed be very jealous.\"\n\n\"One cannot help being jealous, monseigneur, when one loves. Is not your\nroyal highness jealous of Madame? Would you not, if you saw some one\nalways near Madame, and always treated with great favor, take umbrage\nat it? One's friends are as one's lovers. Your highness has sometimes\nconferred the distinguished honor upon me of calling me your friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,; but you used a phrase which has a very equivocal\nsignificance; you are unfortunate in your phrases.\"\n\n\"What phrase, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"You said, 'treated with great favor.' What do you mean by favor?\"\n\n\"Nothing can be more simple,\" said the chevalier, with an expression of\ngreat frankness; \"for instance, whenever a husband remarks that his wife\nsummons such and such a man near her; whenever this man is always to\nbe found by her side, or in attendance at the door of her carriage;\nwhenever the bouquet of the one is always the same color as the\nribbons of the other; when music and supper parties are held in private\napartments; whenever a dead silence takes place immediately the husband\nmakes his appearance in his wife's rooms; and when the husband suddenly\nfinds that he has, as a companion, the most devoted and the kindest\nof men, who, a week before, was with him as little as possible; why,\nthen--\"\n\n\"Well, finish.\"\n\n\"Why, then, I say, monseigneur, one possibly may get jealous. But all\nthese details hardly apply; for our conversation had nothing to do with\nthem.\"\n\nThe duke was evidently very much agitated, and seemed to struggle with\nhimself a good deal. \"You have not told me,\" he then remarked, \"why you\nabsented yourself. A little while ago you said it was from a fear of\nintruding; you added, even, that you had observed a disposition on\nMadame's part to encourage De Guiche.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, monseigneur, I did not say that.\"\n\n\"You did, indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, if I did say so, I observed nothing but what was very\ninoffensive.\"\n\n\"At all events, you remarked something.\"\n\n\"You embarrass me, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? Answer me. If you speak the truth, why should\nyou feel embarrassed?\"\n\n\"I always speak the truth, monseigneur; but I also always hesitate when\nit is a question of repeating what others say.\"\n\n\"Ah! repeat? It appears that it is talked about, then?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge that others have spoken to me on the subject.\"\n\n\"Who?\" said the prince.\n\nThe chevalier assumed almost an angry air, as he replied, \"Monseigneur,\nyou are subjecting me to cross-examination; you treat me as a criminal\nat the bar; the rumors which idly pass by a gentleman's ears do not\nremain there. Your highness wishes me to magnify rumors until it attains\nthe importance of an event.\"\n\n\"However,\" said the duke, in great displeasure, \"the fact remains that\nyou withdrew on account of this report.\"\n\n\"To speak the truth, others have talked to me of the attentions of M. de\nGuiche to Madame, nothing more; perfectly harmless, I repeat, and more\nthan that, allowable. But do not be unjust, monseigneur, and do not\nattach any undue importance to it. It does not concern you.\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche's attentions to Madame do not concern me?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; and what I say to you I would say to De Guiche\nhimself, so little do I think of the attentions he pays Madame. Nay,\nI would say it even to Madame herself. Only you understand what I am\nafraid of--I am afraid of being thought jealous of the favor shown,\nwhen I am only jealous as far as friendship is concerned. I know your\ndisposition; I know that when you bestow your affections you become\nexclusively attached. You love Madame--and who, indeed, would _not_ love\nher? Follow me attentively as I proceed:--Madame has noticed among your\nfriends the handsomest and most fascinating of them all; she will begin\nto influence you on his behalf in such a way that you will neglect the\nothers. Your indifference would kill me; it is already bad enough to\nhave to support Madame's indifference. I have, therefore, made up my\nmind to give way to the favorite whose happiness I envy, even while I\nacknowledge my sincere friendship and sincere admiration for him. Well,\nmonseigneur, do you see anything to object to in this reasoning? Is\nit not that of a man of honor? Is my conduct that of a sincere friend?\nAnswer me, at least, after having so closely questioned me.\"\n\nThe duke had seated himself, with his head buried in his hands. After a\nsilence long enough to enable the chevalier to judge the effect of this\noratorical display, the duke arose, saying, \"Come, be candid.\"\n\n\"As I always am.\"\n\n\"Very well. You know that we already observed something respecting that\nmad fellow, Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Do not say anything against Madame, monseigneur, or I shall take my\nleave. It is impossible you can be suspicious of Madame?\"\n\n\"No, no, chevalier; I do not suspect Madame; but in fact, I observe--I\ncompare--\"\n\n\"Buckingham was a madman, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A madman about whom, however, you opened my eyes thoroughly.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the chevalier, quickly; \"it was not I who opened your\neyes, it was De Guiche. Do not confound us, I beg.\" And he began to\nlaugh in so harsh a manner that it sounded like the hiss of a serpent.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I remember. You said a few words, but De Guiche showed the\nmost jealousy.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" continued the chevalier, in the same tone. \"He was\nfighting for home and altar.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" said the duke, haughtily, thoroughly roused by this\ninsidious jest.\n\n\"Am I not right? for does not M. de Guiche hold the chief post of honor\nin your household?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the duke, somewhat calmed, \"had this passion of\nBuckingham been remarked?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Very well. Do people say that M. de Guiche's is remarked as much?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, monseigneur; you are again mistaken; no one says that M. de\nGuiche entertains anything of the sort.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"You see, monseigneur, that it would have been better, a hundred times\nbetter, to have left me in my retirement, than to have allowed you to\nconjure up, by aid of any scruples I may have had, suspicions which\nMadame will regard as crimes, and she would be in the right, too.\"\n\n\"What would you do?\"\n\n\"Act reasonably.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I should not pay the slightest attention to the society of these new\nEpicurean philosophers; and, in that way, the rumors will cease.\"\n\n\"Well, I will see; I will think it over.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have time enough; the danger is not great; and then, besides,\nit is not a question of danger or of passion. It all arose from a fear\nI had to see your friendship for me decrease. From the very moment you\nrestore it, with so kind an assurance of its existence, I have no longer\nany other idea in my head.\"\n\nThe duke shook his head as if he meant to say: \"If you have no more\nideas, I have, though.\" It being now the dinner hour, the prince sent to\ninform Madame of it; but she returned a message to the effect that she\ncould not be present, but would dine in her own apartment.\n\n\"That is not my fault,\" said the duke. \"This morning, having taken them\nby surprise in the midst of a musical party, I got jealous; and so they\nare in the sulks with me.\"\n\n\"We will dine alone,\" said the chevalier, with a sigh; \"I regret De\nGuiche is not here.\"\n\n\"Oh! De Guiche will not remain long in the sulks; he is a very\ngood-natured fellow.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said the chevalier, suddenly, \"an excellent idea has\nstruck me, in our conversation just now. I may have exasperated your\nhighness, and caused you some dissatisfaction. It is but fitting that I\nshould be the mediator. I will go and look for the count, and bring him\nback with me.\"\n\n\"Ah! chevalier, you are really a very good-natured fellow.\"\n\n\"You say that as if you were surprised.\"\n\n\"Well, you are not so tender-hearted every day.\"\n\n\"That may be; but confess that I know how to repair a wrong I may have\ndone.\"\n\n\"I confess that.\"\n\n\"Will your highness do me the favor to wait here a few minutes?\"\n\n\"Willingly; be off, and I will try on my Fontainebleau costume.\"\n\nThe chevalier left the room, called his different attendant with the\ngreatest care, as if he were giving them different orders. All went\noff in various directions; but he retained his _valet de chambre_.\n\"Ascertain, and immediately, too, of M. de Guiche is not in Madame's\napartments. How can one learn it?\"\n\n\"Very easily, monsieur. I will ask Malicorne, who will find out from\nMlle. de Montalais. I may as well tell you, however, that the inquiry\nwill be useless; for all M. de Guiche's attendants are gone, and he must\nhave left with them.\"\n\n\"Ascertain, nevertheless.\"\n\nTen minutes had hardly passed, when the valet returned. He beckoned his\nmaster mysteriously towards the servants' staircase, and showed him into\na small room with a window looking out upon the garden. \"What is the\nmatter?\" said the chevalier; \"why so many precautions?\"\n\n\"Look, monsieur,\" said the valet, \"look yonder, under the walnut-tree.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said the chevalier. \"I see Manicamp there. What is he waiting\nfor?\"\n\n\"You will see in a moment, monsieur, if you wait patiently. There, do\nyou see now?\"\n\n\"I see one, two, four musicians with their instruments, and behind them,\nurging them on, De Guiche himself. What is he doing there, though?\"\n\n\"He is waiting until the little door of the staircase, belonging to the\nladies of honor, is opened; by that staircase he will ascend to Madame's\napartments, where some new pieces of music are going to be performed\nduring dinner.\"\n\n\"This is admirable news you tell me.\"\n\n\"Is it not, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Was it M. de Malicorne who told you this?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"He likes you, then?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, it is Monsieur that he likes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he wishes to belong to his household.\"\n\n\"And most certainly he shall. How much did he give you for that?\"\n\n\"The secret which I now dispose of to you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And which I buy for a hundred pistoles. Take them.\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur. Look, look, the little door opens; a woman admits\nthe musicians.\"\n\n\"It is Montalais.\"\n\n\"Hush, monseigneur; do not call out her name; whoever says Montalais\nsays Malicorne. If you quarrel with the one, you will be on bad terms\nwith the other.\"\n\n\"Very well; I have seen nothing.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the valet, pocketing the purse, \"have received nothing.\"\n\nThe chevalier, being now certain that Guiche had entered, returned to\nthe prince, whom he found splendidly dressed and radiant with joy, as\nwith good looks. \"I am told,\" he exclaimed, \"that the king has taken the\nsun as his device; really, monseigneur, it is you whom this device would\nbest suit.\"\n\n\"Where is De Guiche?\"\n\n\"He cannot be found. He has fled--has evaporated entirely. Your scolding\nof this morning terrified him. He could not be found in his apartments.\"\n\n\"Bah! the hair-brained fellow is capable of setting off post-haste to\nhis own estates. Poor man! we will recall him. Come, let us dine now.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, to-day is a very festival of ideas; I have another.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Madame is angry with you, and she has reason to be so. You owe her\nrevenge; go and dine with her.\"\n\n\"Oh! that would be acting like a weak and whimsical husband.\"\n\n\"It is the duty of a good husband to do so. The princess is no doubt\nwearied enough; she will be weeping in her plate, and here eyes will get\nquite red. A husband who is the cause of his wife's eyes getting red is\nan odious creature. Come, monseigneur, come.\"\n\n\"I cannot; for I have directed dinner to be served here.\"\n\n\"Yet see, monseigneur, how dull we shall be; I shall be low-spirited\nbecause I know that Madame will be alone; you, hard and savage as you\nwish to appear, will be sighing all the while. Take me with you to\nMadame's dinner, and that will be a delightful surprise. I am sure we\nshall be very merry; you were in the wrong this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I was.\"\n\n\"There is no perhaps at all, for it is a fact you were so.\"\n\n\"Chevalier, chevalier, your advice is not good.\"\n\n\"Nay, my advice is good; all the advantages are on your own side. Your\nviolet-colored suit, embroidered with gold, becomes you admirably.\nMadame will be as much vanquished by the man as by the action. Come,\nmonseigneur.\"\n\n\"You decide me; let us go.\"\n\nThe duke left his room, accompanied by the chevalier and went towards\nMadame's apartments. The chevalier hastily whispered to the valet, \"Be\nsure there are some people before that little door, so that no one can\nescape in that direction. Run, run!\" And he followed the duke towards\nthe ante-chambers of Madame's suite of apartments, and when the ushers\nwere about to announce them, the chevalier said, laughing, \"His highness\nwishes to surprise Madame.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII. Monsieur is Jealous of Guiche.\n\nMonsieur entered the room abruptly, as persons do who mean well and\nthink they confer pleasure, or as those who hope to surprise some\nsecret, the terrible reward of jealous people. Madame, almost out of\nher senses with joy at the first bars of music, was dancing in the most\nunrestrained manner, leaving the dinner, which had been already begun,\nunfinished. Her partner was M. de Guiche, who, with his arms raised,\nand his eyes half closed, was kneeling on one knee, like the Spanish\ndancers, with looks full of passion, and gestures of the most caressing\ncharacter. The princess was dancing round him with a responsive\nsmile, and the same air of alluring seductiveness. Montalais stood\nby admiringly; La Valliere, seated in a corner of the room, looked on\nthoughtfully. It is impossible to describe the effect which the presence\nof the prince produced upon this gleeful company, and it would be\nequally impossible to describe the effect which the sight of their\nhappiness produced upon Philip. The Comte de Guiche had no power to\nmove; Madame remained in the middle of one of the figures and of an\nattitude, unable to utter a word. The Chevalier de Lorraine, leaning his\nback against the doorway, smiled like a man in the very height of\nthe frankest admiration. The pallor of the prince, and the convulsive\ntwitching of his hands and limbs, were the first symptoms that struck\nthose present. A dead silence succeeded the merry music of the dance.\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine took advantage of this interval to salute\nMadame and De Guiche most respectfully, affecting to join them together\nin his reverences as though they were the master and mistress of the\nhouse. Monsieur then approached them, saying, in a hoarse tone of voice,\n\"I am delighted; I came here expecting to find you ill and low-spirited,\nand I find you abandoning yourself to new amusements; really, it is most\nfortunate. My house is the pleasantest in the kingdom.\" Then turning\ntowards De Guiche, \"Comte,\" he said, \"I did not know you were so good\na dancer.\" And, again addressing his wife, he said, \"Show a little more\nconsideration for me, Madame; whenever you intend to amuse yourselves\nhere, invite me. I am a prince, unfortunately, very much neglected.\"\n\nGuiche had now recovered his self-possession, and with the spirited\nboldness which was natural to him, and sat so well upon him, he said,\n\"Your highness knows very well that my very life is at your service,\nand whenever there is a question of its being needed, I am ready; but\nto-day, as it is only a question of dancing to music, I dance.\"\n\n\"And you are perfectly right,\" said the prince, coldly. \"But, Madame,\"\nhe continued, \"you do not remark that your ladies deprive me of my\nfriends; M. de Guiche does not belong to you, Madame, but to me. If you\nwish to dine without me you have your ladies. When I dine alone I have\nmy gentlemen; do not strip me of _everything_.\"\n\nMadame felt the reproach and the lesson, and the color rushed to her\nface. \"Monsieur,\" she replied, \"I was not aware, when I came to the\ncourt of France, that princesses of my rank were to be regarded as the\nwomen in Turkey are. I was not aware that we were not allowed to be\nseen; but, since such is your desire, I will conform myself to it;\npray do not hesitate, if you should wish it, to have my windows barred,\neven.\"\n\nThis repartee, which made Montalais and De Guiche smile, rekindled\nthe prince's anger, no inconsiderable portion of which had already\nevaporated in words.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, in a concentrated tone of voice, \"this is the way\nin which I am respected in my own house.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, monseigneur,\" murmured the chevalier in the duke's ear,\nin such a manner that every one could observe he was endeavoring to calm\nhim.\n\n\"Come,\" replied the prince, as his only answer to the remark, hurrying\nhim away, and turning round with so hasty a movement that he almost ran\nagainst Madame. The chevalier followed him to his own apartment, where\nthe prince had no sooner seated himself than he gave free vent to his\nfury. The chevalier raised his eyes towards the ceiling, joined his\nhands together, and said not a word.\n\n\"Give me your opinion,\" exclaimed the prince.\n\n\"Upon what?\"\n\n\"Upon what is taking place here.\"\n\n\"Oh, monseigneur, it is a very serious matter.\"\n\n\"It is abominable! I cannot live in this manner.\"\n\n\"How miserable all this is,\" said the chevalier. \"We hoped to enjoy\ntranquillity after that madman Buckingham had left.\"\n\n\"And this is worse.\"\n\n\"I do not say that, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I say it; for Buckingham would never have ventured upon a\nfourth part of what we have just now seen.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"To conceal oneself for the purposes of dancing, and to feign\nindisposition in order to dine _tete-a-tete_.\"\n\n\"No, no, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" exclaimed the prince, exciting himself like a self-willed\nchild; \"but I will not endure it any longer, I must learn what is really\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"Oh, monseigneur, an exposure--\"\n\n\"By Heaven, monsieur, _shall_ I put myself out of the way, when people\nshow so little consideration for me? Wait for me here, chevalier, wait\nfor me here.\" The prince disappeared in the neighboring apartment and\ninquired of the gentleman in attendance if the queen-mother had returned\nfrom chapel.\n\nAnne of Austria felt that her happiness was now complete; peace restored\nto her family, a nation delighted with the presence of a young monarch\nwho had shown an aptitude for affairs of great importance; the revenues\nof the state increased; external peace assured; everything seemed to\npromise a tranquil future. Her thoughts recurred, now and then, to the\npoor young nobleman whom she had received as a mother, and had driven\naway as a hard-hearted step-mother, and she sighed as she thought of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly the Duc d'Orleans entered her room. \"Dear mother,\" he exclaimed\nhurriedly, closing the door, \"things cannot go on as they are now.\"\n\nAnne of Austria raised her beautiful eyes towards him, and with an\nunmoved suavity of manner, said, \"What do you allude to?\"\n\n\"I wish to speak of Madame.\"\n\n\"Your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"I suppose that silly fellow Buckingham has been writing a farewell\nletter to her.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, madame; of course, it is a question of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Of whom else could it be, then? for that poor fellow was, wrongly\nenough, the object of your jealousy, and I thought--\"\n\n\"My wife, madame, has already replaced the Duke of Buckingham.\"\n\n\"Philip, what are you saying? You are speaking very heedlessly.\"\n\n\"No, no. Madame has so managed matters, that I am still jealous.\"\n\n\"Of whom, in Heaven's name?\"\n\n\"Is it possible you have not remarked it? Have you not noticed that M.\nde Guiche is always in her apartments--always with her?\"\n\nThe queen clapped her hands together, and began to laugh. \"Philip,\" she\nsaid, \"your jealousy is not merely a defect, it is a disease.\"\n\n\"Whether a defect or a disease, madame, I am the sufferer from it.\"\n\n\"And do you imagine that a complaint which exists only in your own\nimagination can be cured? You wish it to be said you are right in being\njealous, when there is no ground whatever for your jealousy.\"\n\n\"Of course, you will begin to say for this gentleman what you already\nsaid on the behalf of the other.\"\n\n\"Because, Philip,\" said the queen dryly, \"what you did for the other,\nyou are going to do for this one.\"\n\nThe prince bowed, slightly annoyed. \"If I give you facts,\" he said,\n\"will you believe me?\"\n\n\"If it regarded anything else but jealousy, I would believe you without\nyour bringing facts forward; but as jealousy is the case, I promise\nnothing.\"\n\n\"It is just the same as if your majesty were to desire me to hold my\ntongue, and sent me away unheard.\"\n\n\"Far from it; you are my son, I owe you a mother's indulgence.\"\n\n\"Oh, say what you think; you owe me as much indulgence as a madman\ndeserves.\"\n\n\"Do not exaggerate, Philip, and take care how you represent your wife to\nme as a woman of depraved mind--\"\n\n\"But facts, mother, facts!\"\n\n\"Well, I am listening.\"\n\n\"This morning at ten o'clock they were playing music in Madame's\napartments.\"\n\n\"No harm in that, surely.\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche was talking with her alone--Ah! I forgot to tell you,\nthat, during the last ten days, he has never left her side.\"\n\n\"If they were doing any harm they would hide themselves.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" exclaimed the duke, \"I expected you to say that. Pray\nremember with precision the words you have just uttered. This morning\nI took them by surprise, and showed my dissatisfaction in a very marked\nmanner.\"\n\n\"Rely upon it, that is quite sufficient; it was, perhaps, even a little\ntoo much. These young women easily take offense. To reproach them for\nan error they have not committed is, sometimes, almost equivalent to\ntelling them they might be guilty of even worse.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good; but wait a minute. Do not forget what you have\njust this moment said, that this morning's lesson ought to have been\nsufficient, and that if they had been doing what was wrong, they would\nhave hidden themselves.\"\n\n\"Yes, I said so.\"\n\n\"Well, just now, repenting of my hastiness of the morning, and imagining\nthat Guiche was sulking in his own apartments, I went to pay Madame\na visit. Can you guess what, or whom, I found there? Another set of\nmusicians; more dancing, and Guiche himself--he was concealed there.\"\n\nAnne of Austria frowned. \"It was imprudent,\" she said. \"What did Madame\nsay?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"And Guiche?\"\n\n\"As much--oh, no! he muttered some impertinent remark or another.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your opinion, Philip?\"\n\n\"That I have been made a fool of; that Buckingham was only a pretext,\nand that Guiche is the one who is really to blame in the matter.\"\n\nAnne shrugged her shoulders. \"Well,\" she said, \"what else?\"\n\n\"I wish De Guiche to be dismissed from my household, as Buckingham was,\nand I shall ask the king, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless you, my dear mother, who are so clever and so kind, will execute\nthe commission yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not do it, Philip.\"\n\n\"What, madame?\"\n\n\"Listen, Philip; I am not disposed to pay people ill compliments\nevery day; I have some influence over young people, but I cannot take\nadvantage of it without running the chances of losing it altogether.\nBesides, there is nothing to prove that M. de Guiche is guilty.\"\n\n\"He has displeased me.\"\n\n\"That is your own affair.\"\n\n\"Very well, I know what I shall do,\" said the prince, impetuously.\n\nAnne looked at him with some uneasiness. \"What do you intend to do?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I will have him drowned in my fish-pond the very next time I find\nhim in my apartments again.\" Having launched this terrible threat, the\nprince expected his mother would be frightened out of her senses; but\nthe queen was unmoved.\n\n\"Do so,\" she said.\n\nPhilip was as weak as a woman, and began to cry out, \"Every one betrays\nme,--no one cares for me; my mother, even, joins my enemies.\"\n\n\"Your mother, Philip, sees further in the matter than you do, and does\nnot care about advising you, since you will not listen to her.\"\n\n\"I will go to the king.\"\n\n\"I was about to propose that to you. I am now expecting his majesty;\nit is the hour he usually pays me a visit; explain the matter to him\nyourself.\"\n\nShe had hardly finished when Philip heard the door of the ante-room open\nwith some noise. He began to feel nervous. At the sound of the king's\nfootsteps, which could be heard upon the carpet, the duke hurriedly made\nhis escape. Anne of Austria could not resist laughing, and was laughing\nstill when the king entered. He came very affectionately to inquire\nafter the even now uncertain health of the queen-mother, and to announce\nto her that the preparations for the journey to Fontainebleau were\ncomplete. Seeing her laugh, his uneasiness on her account diminished,\nand he addressed her in a vivacious tone himself. Anne of Austria took\nhim by the hand, and, in a voice full of playfulness, said, \"Do you\nknow, sire that I am proud of being a Spanish woman?\"\n\n\"Why, madame?\"\n\n\"Because Spanish women are worth more than English women at least.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Since your marriage you have not, I believe, had a single reproach to\nmake against the queen.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"And you, too, have been married some time. Your brother, on the\ncontrary, has been married but a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He is now finding fault with Madame a second time.\"\n\n\"What, Buckingham still?\"\n\n\"No, another.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Guiche.\"\n\n\"Really? Madame is a coquette, then?\"\n\n\"I fear so.\"\n\n\"My poor brother,\" said the king, laughing.\n\n\"You don't object to coquettes, it seems?\"\n\n\"In Madame, certainly I do; but Madame is not a coquette at heart.\"\n\n\"That may be, but your brother is excessively angry about it.\"\n\n\"What does he want?\"\n\n\"He wants to drown Guiche.\"\n\n\"That is a violent measure to resort to.\"\n\n\"Do not laugh; he is extremely irritated. Think of what can be done.\"\n\n\"To save Guiche--certainly.\"\n\n\"Of, if your brother heard you, he would conspire against you as your\nuncle did against your father.\"\n\n\"No; Philip has too much affection for me for that, and I, on my side,\nhave too great a regard for him; we shall live together on very good\nterms. But what is the substance of his request?\"\n\n\"That you will prevent Madame from being a coquette and Guiche from\nbeing amiable.\"\n\n\"Is that all? My brother has an exalted idea of sovereign power. To\nreform a man, not to speak about reforming a woman!\"\n\n\"How will you set about it?\"\n\n\"With a word to Guiche, who is a clever fellow, I will undertake to\nconvince him.\"\n\n\"But Madame?\"\n\n\"That is more difficult; a word will not be enough. I will compose a\nhomily and read it to her.\"\n\n\"There is no time to be lost.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will use the utmost diligence. There is a repetition of the\nballet this afternoon.\"\n\n\"You will read her a lecture while you are dancing?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"You promise to convert her?\"\n\n\"I will root out the heresy altogether, either by convincing her, or by\nextreme measures.\"\n\n\"That is all right, then. Do not mix me up in the affair; Madame would\nnever forgive me all her life, and as a mother-in-law, I ought to desire\nto live on good terms with my new-found daughter.\"\n\n\"The king, madame, will take all upon himself. But let me reflect.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"It would be better, perhaps, if I were to go and see Madame in her own\napartment.\"\n\n\"Would that not seem a somewhat serious step to take?\"\n\n\"Yes; but seriousness is not unbecoming in preachers, and the music\nof the ballet would drown half my arguments. Besides, the object is\nto prevent any violent measures on my brother's part, so that a little\nprecipitation may be advisable. Is Madame in her own apartment?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"What is my statement of grievances to consist of?\"\n\n\"In a few words, of the following: music uninterruptedly; Guiche's\nassiduity; suspicions of treasonable plots and practices.\"\n\n\"And the proofs?\"\n\n\"There _are_ none.\"\n\n\"Very well; I will go at once to see Madame.\" The king turned to look in\nthe mirrors at his costume, which was very rich, and his face, which\nwas radiant as the morning. \"I suppose my brother is kept a little at a\ndistance,\" said the king.\n\n\"Fire and water cannot be more opposite.\"\n\n\"That will do. Permit me, madame, to kiss your hands, the most beautiful\nhands in France.\"\n\n\"May you be successful, sire, as the family peacemaker.\"\n\n\"I do not employ an ambassador,\" said Louis, \"which is as much as to say\nthat I shall succeed.\" He laughed as he left the room, and carelessly\nadjusted his ruffles as he went along.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII. The Mediator.\n\nWhen the king made his appearance in Madame's apartments, the courtiers,\nwhom the news of a conjugal misunderstanding had dispersed through the\nvarious apartments, began to entertain the most serious apprehensions. A\nstorm was brewing in that direction, the elements of which the Chevalier\nde Lorraine, in the midst of the different groups, was analyzing with\ndelight, contributing to the weaker, and acting, according to his own\nwicked designs, in such a manner with regard to the stronger, as to\nproduce the most disastrous consequences possible. As Anne of Austria\nhad herself said, the presence of the king gave a solemn and serious\ncharacter to the event. Indeed, in the year 1662, the dissatisfaction of\nMonsieur with Madame, and the king's intervention in the private affairs\nof Monsieur, was a matter of no inconsiderable moment. [3]\n\nThe boldest, even, who had been the associates of the Comte de Guiche,\nhad, from the first moment, held aloof from him, with a sort of nervous\napprehension; and the comte himself, infected by the general panic,\nretired to his own room. The king entered Madame's private apartments,\nacknowledging and returning the salutations, as he was always in the\nhabit of doing. The ladies of honor were ranged in a line on his passage\nalong the gallery. Although his majesty was very much preoccupied,\nhe gave the glance of a master at the two rows of young and beautiful\ngirls, who modestly cast down their eyes, blushing as they felt the\nking's gaze fall upon them. One only of the number, whose long hair fell\nin silken masses upon the most beautiful skin imaginable, was pale,\nand could hardly sustain herself, notwithstanding the knocks which her\ncompanion gave her with her elbow. It was La Valliere whom Montalais\nsupported in that manner by whispering some of that courage to her with\nwhich she herself was so abundantly provided. The king could not resist\nturning round to look at them again. Their faces, which had already been\nraised, were again lowered, but the only fair head among them remained\nmotionless, as if all the strength and intelligence she had left\nhad abandoned her. When he entered Madame's room, Louis found his\nsister-in-law reclining upon the cushions of her cabinet. She rose and\nmade a profound reverence, murmuring some words of thanks for the honor\nshe was receiving. She then resumed her seat, overcome by a sudden\nweakness, which was no doubt assumed, for a delightful color animated\nher cheeks, and her eyes, still red from the tears she had recently\nshed, never had more fire in them. When the king was seated, as soon as\nhe had remarked, with that accuracy of observation which characterized\nhim, the disorder of the apartment, and the no less great disorder of\nMadame's countenance, he assumed a playful manner, saying, \"My dear\nsister, at what hour to-day would you wish the repetition of the ballet\nto take place?\"\n\nMadame, shaking her charming head, slowly and languishingly said: \"Ah!\nsire, will you graciously excuse my appearance at the repetition? I was\nabout to send to inform you that I could not attend to-day.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the king, in apparent surprise; \"are you not well?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"I will summon your medical attendants, then.\"\n\n\"No, for they can do nothing for my indisposition.\"\n\n\"You alarm me.\"\n\n\"Sire, I wish to ask your majesty's permission to return to England.\"\n\nThe king started. \"Return to England,\" he said; \"do you really say what\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"I say it reluctantly, sire,\" replied the grand-daughter of Henry IV.,\nfirmly, her beautiful black eyes flashing. \"I regret to have to confide\nsuch matters to your majesty, but I feel myself too unhappy at your\nmajesty's court; and I wish to return to my own family.\"\n\n\"Madame, madame,\" exclaimed the king, as he approached her.\n\n\"Listen to me, sire,\" continued the young woman, acquiring by degrees\nthat ascendency over her interrogator which her beauty and her nervous\nnature conferred; \"young as I am, I have already suffered humiliation,\nand have endured disdain here. Oh! do not contradict me, sire,\" she\nsaid, with a smile. The king colored.\n\n\"Then,\" she continued, \"I had reasoned myself into the belief that\nHeaven called me into existence with that object--I, the daughter of a\npowerful monarch; that since my father had been deprived of life, Heaven\ncould well smite my pride. I have suffered greatly; I have been the\ncause, too, of my mother suffering much; but I vowed that if Providence\never placed me in a position of independence, even were it that of a\nworkman of the lower classes, who gains her bread by her labor, I would\nnever suffer humiliation again. That day has now arrived; I have been\nrestored to the fortune due to my rank and to my birth; I have even\nascended again the steps of a throne, and I thought that, in allying\nmyself with a French prince, I should find in him a relation, a friend,\nan equal; but I perceive I have found only a master, and I rebel. My\nmother shall know nothing of it; you whom I respect, and whom I--love--\"\n\nThe king started; never had any voice so gratified his ear.\n\n\"You, sire, who know all, since you have come here; you will, perhaps,\nunderstand me. If you had not come, I should have gone to you. I wish\nfor permission to go away. I leave it to your delicacy of feeling to\nexculpate and to protect me.\"\n\n\"My dear sister,\" murmured the king, overpowered by this bold attack,\n\"have you reflected upon the enormous difficulty of the project you have\nconceived?\"\n\n\"Sire, I do not reflect, I feel. Attacked, I instinctively repel the\nattack, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Come, tell me, what have they done to you?\" said the king.\n\nThe princess, it will have been seen, by this peculiarly feminine\nmaneuver, had escaped every reproach, and advanced on her side a far\nmore serious one; from the accused she became the accuser. It is an\ninfallible sign of guilt; but notwithstanding that, all women, even the\nleast clever of the sex, invariably know how to derive some such means\nof turning the tables. The king had forgotten that he was paying her a\nvisit in order to say to her, \"What have you done to my brother?\" and he\nwas reduced to weakly asking her, \"What have they done to you?\"\n\n\"What have they done to me?\" replied Madame. \"One must be a woman to\nunderstand it, sire--they have made me shed tears;\" and, with one of\nher fingers, whose slenderness and perfect whiteness were unequaled,\nshe pointed to her brilliant eyes swimming with unshed drops, and again\nbegan to weep.\n\n\"I implore you, my dear sister!\" said the king, advancing to take her\nwarm and throbbing hand, which she abandoned to him.\n\n\"In the first place, sire, I was deprived of the presence of my\nbrother's friend. The Duke of Buckingham was an agreeable, cheerful\nvisitor; my own countryman, who knew my habits; I will say almost a\ncompanion, so accustomed had we been to pass our days together, with our\nother friends, upon the beautiful piece of water at St. James's.\"\n\n\"But Villiers was in love with you.\"\n\n\"A pretext! What does it matter,\" she said, seriously, \"whether the duke\nwas in love with me or not? Is a man in love so very dangerous for\nme? Ah! sire, it is not sufficient for a man to love a woman.\" And she\nsmiled so tenderly, and with so much archness, that the king felt his\nheart swell and throb in his breast.\n\n\"At all events, if my brother were jealous?\" interrupted the king.\n\n\"Very well, I admit that is a reason; and the duke was sent away\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"No, not sent away.\"\n\n\"Driven away, dismissed, expelled, then, if you prefer it, sire. One of\nthe first gentlemen of Europe obliged to leave the court of the King\nof France, of Louis XIV., like a beggar, on account of a glance or a\nbouquet. It was little worthy of a most gallant court; but forgive me,\nsire; I forgot, that, in speaking thus, I am attacking your sovereign\npower.\"\n\n\"I assure you, my dear sister, it was not I who dismissed the Duke of\nBuckingham; I was charmed with him.\"\n\n\"It was not you?\" said Madame; \"ah! so much the better;\" and she\nemphasized the \"so much the better,\" as if she had instead said, \"so\nmuch the worse.\"\n\nA few minutes' silence ensued. She then resumed: \"The Duke of Buckingham\nhaving left--I now know why and by whose means--I thought I should have\nrecovered my tranquillity; but not at all, for all at once Monsieur\nfound another pretext; all at once--\"\n\n\"All at once,\" said the king, playfully, \"some one else presents\nhimself. It is but natural; you are beautiful, and will always meet with\nmen who will madly love you.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" exclaimed the princess, \"I will create a solitude around\nme, which indeed seems to be what is wished, and what is being prepared\nfor me. But no, I prefer to return to London. There I am known and\nappreciated. I shall have friends, without fearing they may be regarded\nas my lovers. Shame! it is a disgraceful suspicion, and unworthy a\ngentleman. Monsieur has lost everything in my estimation, since he has\nshown me he can be a tyrant to a woman.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, my brother's only fault is that of loving you.\"\n\n\"Love me! Monsieur love me! Ah! sire,\" and she burst out laughing.\n\"Monsieur will never love any woman,\" she said; \"Monsieur loves himself\ntoo much; no, unhappily for me, Monsieur's jealousy is of the worst\nkind--he is jealous without love.\"\n\n\"Confess, however,\" said the king, who began to be excited by this\nvaried and animated conversation; \"confess that Guiche loves you.\"\n\n\"Ah! sire, I know nothing about that.\"\n\n\"You must have perceived it. A man who loves readily betrays himself.\"\n\n\"M. de Guiche has not betrayed himself.\"\n\n\"My dear sister, you are defending M. de Guiche.\"\n\n\"I, indeed! Ah, sire, I only needed a suspicion from yourself to crown\nmy wretchedness.\"\n\n\"No, madame, no,\" returned the king, hurriedly; \"do not distress\nyourself. Nay, you are weeping. I implore you to calm yourself.\"\n\nShe wept, however, and large tears fell upon her hands; the king took\none of her hands in his, and kissed the tears away. She looked at him\nso sadly and with so much tenderness that he felt his heart giving way\nunder her gaze.\n\n\"You have no kind of feeling, then, for Guiche?\" he said, more disturbed\nthan became his character of mediator.\n\n\"None--absolutely none.\"\n\n\"Then I can reassure my brother in that respect?\"\n\n\"Nothing will satisfy him, sire. Do not believe he is jealous. Monsieur\nhas been badly advised by some one, and he is of nervous disposition.\"\n\n\"He may well be so when you are concerned,\" said the king.\n\nMadame cast down her eyes, and was silent; the king did so likewise,\nstill holding her hand all the while. Their momentary silence seemed to\nlast an age. Madame gently withdrew her hand, and from that moment, she\nfelt her triumph was certain, and that the field of battle was her own.\n\n\"Monsieur complains,\" said the king, \"that you prefer the society of\nprivate individuals to his own conversation and society.\"\n\n\"But Monsieur passes his life in looking at his face in the glass,\nand in plotting all sorts of spiteful things against women with the\nChevalier de Lorraine.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are going somewhat too far.\"\n\n\"I only tell you what is true. Do you observe for yourself, sire, and\nyou will see that I am right.\"\n\n\"I will observe; but, in the meantime, what satisfaction can I give my\nbrother?\"\n\n\"My departure.\"\n\n\"You repeat that word,\" exclaimed the king, imprudently, as if, during\nthe last ten minutes, such a change had been produced that Madame would\nhave had all her ideas on the subject thoroughly changed.\n\n\"Sire, I cannot be happy here any longer,\" she said. \"M. de Guiche\nannoys Monsieur. Will he be sent away, too?\"\n\n\"If it be necessary, why not?\" replied the king, smiling.\n\n\"Well; and after M. de Guiche--whom, by the by, I shall regret--I warn\nyou, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah, you will regret him?\"\n\n\"Certainly; he is amiable, he has a great friendship for me, and he\namuses me.\"\n\n\"If Monsieur were only to hear you,\" said the king, slightly annoyed,\n\"do you know I would not undertake to make it up again between you; nay,\nI would not even attempt it.\"\n\n\"Sire, can you, even now, prevent Monsieur from being jealous of the\nfirst person who may approach? I know very well that M. de Guiche is not\nthe first.\"\n\n\"Again I warn you that as a good brother I shall take a dislike to De\nGuiche.\"\n\n\"Ah, sire, do not, I entreat you, adopt either the sympathies or the\ndislikes of Monsieur. Remain king; better for yourself and for every one\nelse.\"\n\n\"You jest charmingly, madame; and I can well understand how the people\nyou attack must adore you.\"\n\n\"And is that the reason why you, sire, whom I had regarded as my\ndefender, are about to join these who persecute me?\" said Madame.\n\n\"I your persecutor! Heaven forbid!\"\n\n\"Then,\" she continued, languishingly, \"grant me a favor.\"\n\n\"Whatever you wish.\"\n\n\"Let me return to England.\"\n\n\"Never, never!\" exclaimed Louis XIV.\n\n\"I am a prisoner, then?\"\n\n\"In France--if France is a prison--yes.\"\n\n\"What must I do, then?\"\n\n\"I will tell you. Instead of devoting yourself to friendships which are\nsomewhat unstable, instead of alarming us by your retirement, remain\nalways in our society, do not leave us, let us live as a united family.\nM. de Guiche is certainly very amiable; but if, at least, we do not\npossess his wit--\"\n\n\"Ah, sire, you know very well you are pretending to be modest.\"\n\n\"No, I swear to you. One may be a king, and yet feel that he possesses\nfewer chances of pleasing than many other gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I am sure, sire, that you do not believe a single word you are saying.\"\n\nThe king looked at Madame tenderly, and said, \"Will you promise me one\nthing?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That you will no longer waste upon strangers, in your own apartments,\nthe time which you owe us. Shall we make an offensive and defensive\nalliance against the common enemy?\"\n\n\"An alliance with you, sire?\"\n\n\"Why not? Are you not a sovereign power?\"\n\n\"But are you, sire, a reliable ally?\"\n\n\"You shall see, madame.\"\n\n\"And when shall this alliance commence?\"\n\n\"This very day.\"\n\n\"I will draw up the treaty, and you shall sign it.\"\n\n\"Blindly.\"\n\n\"Then, sire, I promise you wonders; you are the star of the court, and\nwhen you make your appearance, everything will be resplendent.\"\n\n\"Oh, madame, madame,\" said Louis XIV., \"you know well that there is no\nbrilliancy that does not proceed from yourself, and that if I assume the\nsun as my device, it is only an emblem.\"\n\n\"Sire, you flatter your ally, and you wish to deceive her,\" said Madame,\nthreatening the king with her finger menacingly raised.\n\n\"What! you believe I am deceiving you, when I assure you of my\naffection?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What makes you so suspicious?\"\n\n\"One thing.\"\n\n\"What is it? I shall indeed be unhappy if I do not overcome it.\"\n\n\"That one thing in question, sire, is not in your power, not even in the\npower of Heaven.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"The past.\"\n\n\"I do not understand, madame,\" said the king, precisely because he had\nunderstood her but too well.\n\nThe princess took his hand in hers. \"Sire,\" she said, \"I have had the\nmisfortune to displease you for so long a period, that I have almost\nthe right to ask myself to-day why you were able to accept me as a\nsister-in-law.\"\n\n\"Displease me! You have displeased me?\"\n\n\"Nay, do not deny it, for I remember it well.\"\n\n\"Our alliance shall date from to-day,\" exclaimed the king, with a warmth\nthat was not assumed. \"You will not think any more of the past, will\nyou? I myself am resolved that I will not. I shall always remember the\npresent; I have it before my eyes; look.\" And he led the princess before\na mirror, in which she saw herself reflected, blushing and beautiful\nenough to overcome a saint.\n\n\"It is all the same,\" she murmured; \"it will not be a very worthy\nalliance.\"\n\n\"Must I swear?\" inquired the king, intoxicated by the voluptuous turn\nthe whole conversation had taken.\n\n\"Oh, I will not refuse to witness a resounding oath,\" said Madame; \"it\nhas always the _semblance_ of security.\"\n\nThe king knelt upon a footstool and took Madame's hand. She, with a\nsmile that no painter could ever succeed in depicting, and which a poet\nmight only imagine, gave him both her hands, in which he hid his burning\nface. Neither of them could utter a syllable. The king felt Madame\nwithdraw her hands, caressing his face while she did so. He rose\nimmediately and left the apartment. The courtiers remarked his\nheightened color, and concluded that the scene had been a stormy one.\nThe Chevalier de Lorraine, however, hastened to say, \"Nay, be comforted,\ngentlemen, his majesty is always pale when he is angry.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV. The Advisers.\n\nThe king left Madame in a state of agitation it would have been\ndifficult even for himself to have explained. It is impossible, in fact,\nto depict the secret play of those strange sympathies which, suddenly\nand apparently without any cause, are excited, after many years passed\nin the greatest calmness and indifference, by two hearts destined to\nlove each other. Why had Louis formerly disdained, almost hated, Madame?\nWhy did he now find the same woman so beautiful, so captivating? And\nwhy, not only were his thoughts occupied about her, but still more, why\nwere they so continuously occupied about her? Why, in fact, had Madame,\nwhose eyes and mind were sought for in another direction, shown during\nthe last week towards the king a semblance of favor which encouraged\nthe belief of still greater regard. It must not be supposed that Louis\nproposed to himself any plan of seduction; the tie which united Madame\nto his brother was, or at least, seemed to him, an insuperable barrier;\nhe was even too far removed from that barrier to perceive its existence.\nBut on the downward path of those passions in which the heart rejoices,\ntowards which youth impels us, no one can decide where to stop, not even\nthe man who has in advance calculated all the chances of his own success\nor another's submission. As far as Madame was concerned, her regard\nfor the king may easily be explained: she was young, a coquette, and\nardently fond of admiration. Hers was one of those buoyant, impetuous\nnatures, which upon a theatre would leap over the greatest obstacles to\nobtain an acknowledgement of applause from the spectators. It was not\nsurprising, then, that, after having been adored by Buckingham, by De\nGuiche, who was superior to Buckingham, even if it were only from\nthat negative merit, so much appreciated by women, that is to say,\nnovelty--it was not surprising, we say, that the princess should raise\nher ambition to being admired by the king, who not only was the first\nperson in the kingdom, but was one of the handsomest and cleverest men\nin Europe. As for the sudden passion with which Louis was inspired for\nhis sister-in-law, physiology would perhaps supply an explanation\nby some hackneyed commonplace reasons, and nature by means of her\nmysterious affinity of characters. Madame had the most beautiful black\neyes in the world; Louis, eyes as beautiful, but blue. Madame was\nlaughter-loving and unreserved in her manners; Louis, melancholy and\ndiffident. Summoned to meet each other for the first time upon the\ngrounds of interest and common curiosity, these two opposite\nnatures were mutually influenced by the mingling of their reciprocal\ncontradictions of character. Louis, when he returned to his own rooms,\nacknowledged to himself that Madame was the most attractive woman of his\ncourt. Madame, left alone, delightedly thought that she had made a\ngreat impression on the king. This feeling with her must remain passive,\nwhilst the king could not but act with all the natural vehemence of the\nheated fancies of a young man, and of a young man who has but to express\na wish to see his wish fulfilled.\n\nThe first thing the king did was to announce to Monsieur that everything\nwas quietly arranged; that Madame had the greatest respect, the\nsincerest affection for him; but that she was of a proud, impetuous\ncharacter, and that her susceptibilities were so acute as to require\nvery careful management.\n\nMonsieur replied in the reticent tone of voice he generally adopted with\nhis brother, that he could not very well understand the susceptibilities\nof a woman whose conduct might, in his opinion, expose her to censorious\nremarks, and that if any one had a right to feel wounded, it was he,\nMonsieur himself. To this the king replied in a quick tone of voice,\nwhich showed the interest he took in his sister-in-law, \"Thank Heaven,\nMadame is above censure.\"\n\n\"The censure of others, certainly, I admit,\" said Monsieur; \"but not\nabove mine, I presume.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the king, \"all I have to say, Philip, is that Madame's\nconduct does not deserve your censure. She certainly is heedless and\nsingular, but professes the best feelings. The English character is not\nalways well understood in France, and the liberty of English manners\nsometimes surprises those who do not know the extent to which this\nliberty is enriched by innocence.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Monsieur, more and more piqued, \"from the very moment that\nyour majesty absolves my wife, whom I accuse, my wife is not guilty, and\nI have nothing more to say.\"\n\n\"Philip,\" replied the king hastily, for he felt the voice of conscience\nmurmuring softly in his heart, that Monsieur was not altogether\nwrong, \"what I have done, and what I have said, has been only for your\nhappiness. I was told that you complained of a want of confidence and\nattention on Madame's part, and I did not wish your uneasiness to be\nprolonged. It is part of my duty to watch over your household, as over\nthat of the humblest of my subjects. I have satisfied myself,\ntherefore, with the sincerest pleasure, that your apprehensions have no\nfoundation.\"\n\n\"And,\" continued Monsieur, in an interrogative tone of voice, and fixing\nhis eyes upon his brother, \"what your majesty has discovered for Madame\n--and I bow myself to your superior judgment--have you verified for\nthose who have been the cause of the scandal of which I complain?\"\n\n\"You are right, Philip,\" said the king; \"I will reserve that point for\nfuture consideration.\"\n\nThese words comprised an order as well as a consolation; the prince felt\nit to be so, and withdrew.\n\nAs for Louis, he went to seek his mother, for he felt that he had need\nof a more complete absolution than that he had just received from his\nbrother. Anne of Austria did not entertain for M. de Guiche the same\nreasons for indulgence she had had for Buckingham. She perceived, at\nthe very first words he pronounced, that Louis was not disposed to be\nsevere.\n\nTo appear in a contradictory humor was one of the stratagems of the good\nqueen, in order to succeed in ascertaining the truth. But Louis was no\nlonger in his apprenticeship; already for more than a year past he\nhad been king, and during that year he had learned how to dissemble.\nListening to Anne of Austria, in order to permit her to disclose her own\nthoughts, testifying his approval only by look and gesture, he became\nconvinced, from certain piercing glances, and from certain skillful\ninsinuations, that the queen, so clear-sighted in matters of gallantry,\nhad, if not guessed, at least suspected, his weakness for Madame. Of all\nhis auxiliaries, Anne of Austria would be the most important to secure;\nof all his enemies, Anne of Austria would prove most dangerous. Louis,\ntherefore, changed his maneuvers. He complained of Madame, absolved\nMonsieur, listened to what his mother had to say of De Guiche, as he had\npreviously listened to what she had to say of Buckingham, and then, when\nhe saw that she thought she had gained a complete victory over him, he\nleft her.\n\nThe whole of the court, that is to say, all the favorites and more\nintimate associates, and they were numerous, since there were already\nfive masters, were assembled in the evening for the repetition of the\nballet. This interval had been occupied by poor De Guiche in receiving\nvisits; among the number was one which he hoped and feared nearly to\nan equal extent. It was that of the Chevalier de Lorraine. About three\no'clock in the afternoon the chevalier entered De Guiche's rooms. His\nlooks were of the most reassuring character. \"Monsieur,\" said he to\nDe Guiche, \"was in an excellent humor, and no none could say that the\nslightest cloud had passed across the conjugal sky. Besides, Monsieur\nwas not one to bear ill-feeling.\"\n\nFor a long time past, during his residence at the court, the Chevalier\nde Lorraine had decided, that of Louis XIII.'s two sons, Monsieur\nwas the one who had inherited the father's character--an uncertain,\nirresolute character; impulsively good, indifferently disposed at\nbottom; but certainly a cipher for his friends. He especially cheered De\nGuiche, by pointing out to him that Madame would, before long, succeed\nin governing her husband, and that, consequently, that man would govern\nMonsieur who should succeed in influencing Madame.\n\nTo this, De Guiche full of mistrust and presence of mind, replied, \"Yes,\nchevalier; but I believe Madame to be a very dangerous person.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\"\n\n\"She has perceived that Monsieur is not very passionately inclined\ntowards women.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" said the Chevalier de Lorraine, laughing.\n\n\"In that case, Madame will choose the first one who approaches, in order\nto make him the object of her preference, and to bring back her husband\nby jealousy.\"\n\n\"Deep! deep!\" exclaimed the chevalier.\n\n\"But true,\" replied De Guiche.\n\nNeither the one nor the other expressed his real thought. De Guiche, at\nthe very moment he thus attacked Madame's character, mentally asked her\nforgiveness from the bottom of his heart. The chevalier, while admiring\nDe Guiche's penetration, was leading him, blindfolded, to the brink\nof the precipice. De Guiche then questioned him more directly upon the\neffect produced by the scene of the morning, and upon the still more\nserious effect produced by the scene at dinner.\n\n\"But I have already told you they are all laughing at it,\" replied the\nChevalier de Lorraine, \"and Monsieur himself at the head of them.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" hazarded De Guiche, \"I have heard that the king paid Madame a\nvisit.\"\n\n\"Yes, precisely so. Madame was the only one who did not laugh, and the\nking went to her in order to make her laugh, too.\"\n\n\"So that--\"\n\n\"So that nothing is altered in the arrangements of the day,\" said the\nchevalier.\n\n\"And is there a repetition of the ballet this evening?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" returned the chevalier.\n\nAt this moment of the conversation between the two young men, Raoul\nentered, looking full of anxiety. As soon as the chevalier, who had a\nsecret dislike for him, as for every other noble character, perceived\nhim enter, he rose from his seat.\n\n\"What do you advise me to do, then?\" inquired De Guiche of the\nchevalier.\n\n\"I advise you to go to sleep in perfect tranquillity, my dear count.\"\n\n\"And my advice, De Guiche,\" said Raoul, \"is the very opposite.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"To mount your horse and set off at once for one of your estates; on\nyour arrival, follow the chevalier's advice, if you like; and, what is\nmore, you can sleep there as long and as tranquilly as you please.\"\n\n\"What! set off!\" exclaimed the chevalier, feigning surprise; \"why should\nDe Guiche set off?\"\n\n\"Because, and you cannot be ignorant of it--you particularly so--\nbecause every one is talking about the scene which has passed between\nMonsieur and De Guiche.\"\n\nDe Guiche turned pale.\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the chevalier, \"not at all; and you have been\nwrongly informed, M. de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"I have been perfectly well informed, on the contrary, monsieur,\"\nreplied Raoul, \"and the advice I give De Guiche is that of a friend.\"\n\nDuring this discussion, De Guiche, somewhat shaken, looked alternately\nfirst at one and then at the other of his advisers. He inwardly felt\nthat a game, important in all its consequences for the rest of his life,\nwas being played at that moment.\n\n\"Is it not fact,\" said the chevalier, putting the question to the\ncount himself, \"is it not fact, De Guiche, that the scene was not\nso tempestuous as the Vicomte de Bragelonne seems to think, and who,\nmoreover, was not himself there?\"\n\n\"Whether tempestuous or not,\" persisted Raoul, \"it is not precisely of\nthe scene itself that I am speaking, but of the consequences that may\nensue. I know that Monsieur has threatened, I know that Madame has been\nin tears.\"\n\n\"Madame in tears!\" exclaimed De Guiche, imprudently clasping his hands.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the chevalier, laughing, \"this is indeed a circumstance I\nwas not acquainted with. You are decidedly better informed than I am,\nMonsieur de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"And it is because I am better informed than yourself, chevalier, that I\ninsist upon De Guiche leaving.\"\n\n\"No, no; I regret to differ from you, vicomte; but his departure is\nunnecessary. Why, indeed, should he leave? tell us why.\"\n\n\"The king!\"\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed De Guiche.\n\n\"Yes; I tell you the king has taken up the affair.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the chevalier, \"the king likes De Guiche, and particularly\nhis father; reflect, that, if the count were to leave, it would be an\nadmission that he had done something which merited rebuke.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it; when one runs away, it is either from guilt or fear.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, because a man is offended; often because he is wrongfully\naccused,\" said Bragelonne. \"We will assign as a reason for his\ndeparture, that he feels hurt and injured--nothing will be easier; we\nwill say that we both did our utmost to keep him, and you, at least,\nwill not be speaking otherwise than the truth. Come, De Guiche, you are\ninnocent, and, being so, the scene of to-day must have wounded you. So\nset off.\"\n\n\"No, De Guiche, remain where you are,\" said the chevalier; \"precisely\nas M. de Bragelonne has put it, because you are innocent. Once more,\nforgive me, vicomte; but my opinion is the very opposite to your own.\"\n\n\"And you are at perfect liberty to maintain it, monsieur; but be assured\nthat the exile which De Guiche will voluntarily impose upon himself\nwill be of short duration. He can terminate it whenever he pleases, and\nreturning from his voluntary exile, he will meet with smiles from all\nlips; while, on the contrary, the anger of the king may now draw down a\nstorm upon his head, the end of which no one can foresee.\"\n\nThe chevalier smiled, and muttered to himself, \"That is the very thing I\nwish.\" And at the same time he shrugged his shoulders, a movement which\ndid not escape the count, who dreaded, if he quitted the court, to seem\nto yield to a feeling of fear.\n\n\"No, no; I have decided, Bragelonne; I stay.\"\n\n\"I prophesy, then,\" said Raoul, sadly, \"that misfortune will befall you,\nDe Guiche.\"\n\n\"I, too, am a prophet, but not a prophet of evil; on the contrary,\ncount, I say to you, 'remain.'\"\n\n\"Are you sure,\" inquired De Guiche, \"that the repetition of the ballet\nstill takes place?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Raoul,\" continued De Guiche, endeavoring to smile, \"you\nsee, the court is not so very sorrowful, or so readily disposed for\ninternal dissensions, when dancing is carried on with such assiduity.\nCome, acknowledge that,\" said the count to Raoul, who shook his head,\nsaying, \"I have nothing to add.\"\n\n\"But,\" inquired the chevalier, curious to learn whence Raoul had\nobtained his information, the exactitude of which he was inwardly forced\nto admit, \"since you say you are well informed, vicomte, how can you be\nbetter informed than myself, who am one of the prince's most intimate\ncompanions?\"\n\n\"To such a declaration I submit. You certainly ought to be perfectly\nwell informed, I admit; and, as a man of honor is incapable of saying\nanything but what he knows to be true, or of speaking otherwise than\nwhat he thinks, I will say no more, but confess myself defeated, and\nleave you in possession of the field of battle.\"\n\nWhereupon Raoul, who now seemed only to care to be left quiet, threw\nhimself upon a couch, whilst the count summoned his servants to aid him\nin dressing. The chevalier, finding that time was passing away, wished\nto leave; but he feared, too, that Raoul, left alone with De Guiche,\nmight yet influence him to change his mind. He therefore made use of his\nlast resource.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, \"will be brilliant; she appears to-day in her costume\nof Pomona.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" exclaimed the count.\n\n\"And she has just given directions in consequence,\" continued the\nchevalier. \"You know, Monsieur de Bragelonne, that the king is to appear\nas Spring.\"\n\n\"It will be admirable,\" said De Guiche; \"and that is a better reason\nfor me to remain than any you have yet given, because I am to appear\nas Autumn, and shall have to dance with Madame. I cannot absent myself\nwithout the king's orders, since my departure would interrupt the\nballet.\"\n\n\"I,\" said the chevalier, \"am to be only a simple _egypan_; true, it is,\nI am a bad dancer, and my legs are not well made. Gentlemen, adieu.\nDo not forget the basket of fruit, which you are to offer to Pomona,\ncount.\"\n\n\"Rest assured,\" said De Guiche, delightedly, \"I shall forget nothing.\"\n\n\"I am now quite certain that he will remain,\" murmured the Chevalier de\nLorraine to himself.\n\nRaoul, when the chevalier had left, did not even attempt to dissuade\nhis friend, for he felt that it would be trouble thrown away; he merely\nobserved to the comte, in his melancholy and melodious voice, \"You are\nembarking in a most dangerous enterprise. I know you well; you go to\nextremes in everything, and the lady you love does so, too. Admitting\nfor an instant that she should at last love you--\"\n\n\"Oh, never!\" exclaimed De Guiche.\n\n\"Why do you say never?\"\n\n\"Because it would be a great misfortune for both of us.\"\n\n\"In that case, instead of regarding you simply imprudent, I cannot but\nconsider you absolutely mad.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Are you perfectly sure--mind, answer me frankly--that you do not wish\nher whom you love to make any sacrifice for you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; quite sure.\"\n\n\"Love her, then, at a distance.\"\n\n\"What! at a distance?\"\n\n\"Certainly; what matters being present or absent, since you expect\nnothing from her? Love her portrait, a memento.\"\n\n\"Raoul!\"\n\n\"Love is a shadow, an illusion, a chimera; be devoted to the affection\nitself, in giving a name to your ideality.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"You turn away; your servants approach. I will say no more. In good or\nbad fortune, De Guiche, depend on me.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall do so.\"\n\n\"Very well; that is all I had to say to you. Spare no pains in your\nperson, De Guiche, and look your very best. Adieu.\"\n\n\"You will not be present, then, at the ballet, vicomte?\"\n\n\"No; I shall have a visit to pay in town. Farewell, De Guiche.\"\n\nThe reception was to take place in the king's apartments. In the first\nplace, there were the queens, then Madame, and a few ladies of the\ncourt, who had been carefully selected. A great number of courtiers,\nalso selected, occupied the time, before the dancing commenced, in\nconversing, as people knew how to converse in those times. None of the\nladies who had received invitations appeared in the costumes of\nthe _fete_, as the Chevalier de Lorraine had predicted, but many\nconversations took place about the rich and ingenious toilettes designed\nby different painters for the ballet of \"The Demi-Gods,\" for thus were\ntermed the kings and queens of which Fontainebleau was about to\nbecome the Pantheon. Monsieur arrived, holding in his hand a drawing\nrepresenting his character; he looked somewhat anxious; he bowed\ncourteously to the young queen and his mother, but saluted Madame almost\ncavalierly. His notice of her and his coldness of manner were observed\nby all. M. de Guiche indemnified the princess by a look of passionate\ndevotion, and it must be admitted that Madame, as she raised her eyes,\nreturned it to him with interest. It is unquestionable that De Guiche\nhad never looked so handsome, for Madame's glance had its customary\neffect of lighting up the features of the son of the Marshal de Gramont.\nThe king's sister-in-law felt a storm mustering above her head; she\nfelt, too, that during the whole of the day, so fruitful in future\nevents, she had acted unjustly, if not treasonably, towards one who\nloved her with such a depth of devotion. In her eyes the moment seemed\nto have arrived for an acknowledgement to the poor victim of the\ninjustice of the morning. Her heart spoke, and murmured the name of\nDe Guiche; the count was sincerely pitied and accordingly gained the\nvictory over all others. Neither Monsieur, nor the king, nor the Duke of\nBuckingham, was any longer thought of; De Guiche at that moment reigned\nwithout a rival. But although Monsieur also looked very handsome, still\nhe could not be compared to the count. It is well known--indeed all\nwomen say so--that a wide difference invariably exists between the good\nlooks of a lover and those of a husband. Besides, in the present case,\nafter Monsieur had left, and after the courteous and affectionate\nrecognition of the young queen and of the queen-mother, and the careless\nand indifferent notice of Madame, which all the courtiers had remarked;\nall these motives gave the lover the advantage over the husband.\nMonsieur was too great a personage to notice these details. Nothing\nis so certain as a well settled idea of superiority to prove the\ninferiority of the man who has that opinion of himself. The king\narrived. Every one looked for what might possibly happen in the glance,\nwhich began to bestir the world, like the brow of Jupiter Tonans. Louis\nhad none of his brother's gloominess, but was perfectly radiant. Having\nexamined the greater part of the drawings which were displayed for his\ninspection on every side, he gave his opinion or made his remarks upon\nthem, and in this manner rendered some happy and others wretched by a\nsingle word. Suddenly his glance, which was smilingly directed towards\nMadame, detected the slight correspondence established between the\nprincess and the count. He bit his lips, but when he opened them again\nto utter a few commonplace remarks, he said, advancing towards the\nqueens:--\n\n\"I have just been informed that everything is now prepared at\nFontainebleau, in accordance with my directions.\" A murmur of\nsatisfaction arose from the different groups, and the king perceived\non every face the greatest anxiety to receive an invitation for the\n_fetes_. \"I shall leave to-morrow,\" he added. Whereupon the profoundest\nsilence immediately ensued. \"And I invite,\" said the king, finishing,\n\"all those who are now present to get ready to accompany me.\"\n\nSmiling faces were now everywhere visible, with the exception of\nMonsieur, who seemed to retain his ill-humor. The different noblemen\nand ladies of the court thereupon defiled before the king, one after the\nother, in order to thank his majesty for the great honor which had been\nconferred upon them by the invitation. When it came to De Guiche's turn,\nthe king said, \"Ah! M. de Guiche, I did not see you.\"\n\nThe comte bowed, and Madame turned pale. De Guiche was about to open\nhis lips to express his thanks, when the king said, \"Comte, this is the\nseason for farming purposes in the country; I am sure your tenants in\nNormandy will be glad to see you.\"\n\nThe king, after this pitiless attack, turned his back on the poor comte,\nwhose turn it was now to become pale; he advanced a few steps towards\nthe king, forgetting that the king is never spoken to except in reply to\nquestions addressed.\n\n\"I have perhaps misunderstood your majesty,\" he stammered out.\n\nThe king turned his head slightly, and with a cold and stern glance,\nwhich plunged like a sword relentlessly into the hearts of those under\ndisgrace, repeated, \"I said retire to your estates,\" allowing every\nsyllable to fall slowly one by one.\n\nA cold perspiration bedewed the comte's face, his hands convulsively\nopened, and his hat, which he held between his trembling fingers, fell\nto the ground. Louis sought his mother's glance, as though to show her\nthat he was master; he sought his brother's triumphant look, as if to\nask him if he were satisfied with the vengeance taken; and lastly, his\neyes fell upon Madame; but the princess was laughing and smiling with\nMadame de Noailles. She heard nothing, or rather had pretended not to\nhear at all. The Chevalier de Lorraine looked on also, with one of those\nlooks of fixed hostility that seemed to give to a man's glance the power\nof a lever when it raises an obstacle, wrests it away, and casts it to\na distance. M. de Guiche was left alone in the king's cabinet, the whole\nof the company having departed. Shadows seemed to dance before his eyes.\nHe suddenly broke through the settled despair that overwhelmed him, and\nflew to hide himself in his own room, where Raoul awaited him, immovable\nin his own sad presentiments.\n\n\"Well?\" he murmured, seeing his friend enter, bareheaded, with a wild\ngaze and tottering gait.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is true,\" said De Guiche, unable to utter more, and\nfalling exhausted upon the couch.\n\n\"And she?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"She,\" exclaimed his unhappy friend, as he raised his hand clenched in\nanger, towards Heaven. \"She!--\"\n\n\"What did she say and do?\"\n\n\"She said that her dress suited her admirably, and then she laughed.\"\n\nA fit of hysteric laughter seemed to shatter his nerves, for he fell\nbackwards, completely overcome.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV. Fontainebleau.\n\nFor four days, every kind of enchantment brought together in the\nmagnificent gardens of Fontainebleau had converted this spot into a\nplace of the most perfect enjoyment. M. Colbert seemed gifted with\nubiquity. In the morning there were the accounts of the previous night's\nexpenses to settle; during the day, programmes, essays, enrolments,\npayments. M. Colbert had amassed four millions of francs, and dispersed\nthem with sleepless economy. He was horrified at the expenses which\nmythology involved; not a wood nymph, nor a dryad, that cost less than a\nhundred francs a day! The dress alone amounted to three hundred francs.\nThe expense of powder and sulphur for fireworks amounted, every night,\nto a hundred thousand francs. In addition to these, the illuminations\non the borders of the sheet of water cost thirty thousand francs\nevery evening. The _fetes_ had been magnificent; and Colbert could not\nrestrain his delight. From time to time, he noticed Madame and the king\nsetting forth on hunting expeditions, or preparing for the reception\nof different fantastic personages, solemn ceremonials, which had been\nextemporized a fortnight before, and in which Madame's sparkling wit and\nthe king's magnificence were equally well displayed.\n\nFor Madame, the heroine of the _fete_, replied to the addresses of the\ndeputations from unknown races--Garamanths, Scythians, Hyperboreans,\nCaucasians, and Patagonians, who seemed to issue from the ground for the\npurpose of approaching her with their congratulations; and upon every\nrepresentative of these races the king bestowed a diamond, or some other\narticle of value. Then the deputies, in verses more or less amusing,\ncompared the king to the sun, Madame to Phoebe, the sun's sister, and\nthe queen and Monsieur were no more spoken of than if the king had\nmarried Henrietta of England, and not Maria Theresa of Austria. The\nhappy pair, hand in hand, imperceptibly pressing each other's fingers,\ndrank in deep draughts the sweet beverage of adulation, by which the\nattractions of youth, beauty, power and love are enhanced. Every one at\nFontainebleau was amazed at the extent of the influence which Madame had\nso rapidly acquired over the king, and whispered among themselves that\nMadame was, in point of fact, the true queen; and in effect, the king\nhimself proclaimed its truth by his every thought, word, and look. He\nformed his wishes, he drew his inspirations from Madame's eyes, and his\ndelight was unbounded when Madame deigned to smile upon him. And was\nMadame, on her side, intoxicated with the power she wielded, as she\nbeheld every one at her feet? This was a question she herself could\nhardly answer; but what she did know was, that she could frame no wish,\nand that she felt herself to be perfectly happy. The result of all these\nchanges, the source of which emanated from the royal will, was that\nMonsieur, instead of being the second person in the kingdom, had, in\nreality, become the third. And it was now far worse than in the time\nwhen De Guiche's guitars were heard in Madame's apartments; for, then,\nat least, Monsieur had the satisfaction of frightening those who annoyed\nhim. Since the departure, however, of the enemy, who had been driven\naway by means of his alliance with the king, Monsieur had to submit to a\nburden, heavier, but in a very different sense, to his former one. Every\nevening Madame returned home quite exhausted. Horse-riding, bathing\nin the Seine, spectacles, dinners under the leafy covert of the trees,\nballs on the banks of the grand canal, concerts, etc., etc.; all this\nwould have been sufficient to have killed, not a slight and delicate\nwoman, but the strongest porter in the _chateau_. It is perfectly\ntrue that, with regard to dancing, concerts, and promenades, and such\nmatters, a woman is far stronger than the most robust of porters. But,\nhowever great a woman's strength may be, there is a limit to it, and she\ncannot hold out long under such a system. As for Monsieur, he had not\neven the satisfaction of witnessing Madame's abdication of her royalty\nin the evening, for she lived in the royal pavilion with the young queen\nand the queen-mother. As a matter of course, the Chevalier de Lorraine\ndid not quit Monsieur, and did not fail to distil drops of gall into\nevery wound the latter received. The result was, that Monsieur--who\nhad at first been in the highest spirits, and completely restored since\nGuiche's departure--subsided into his melancholy state three days after\nthe court was installed at Fontainebleau.\n\nIt happened, however, that, one day, about two o'clock in the afternoon,\nMonsieur, who had risen late, and had bestowed upon his toilet more than\nhis usual attention,--it happened, we repeat, that Monsieur, who had not\nheard of any plans having been arranged for the day, formed the project\nof collecting his own court, and of carrying Madame off with him to\nMoret, where he possessed a charming country house. He accordingly went\nto the queen's pavilion, and was astonished, on entering, to find none\nof the royal servants in attendance. Quite alone, therefore, he entered\nthe rooms, a door on the left opening to Madame's apartment, the one on\nthe right to the young queen's. In his wife's apartment, Monsieur was\ninformed, by a sempstress who was working there, that every one had left\nat eleven o'clock, for the purpose of bathing in the Seine, that a grand\n_fete_ was to be made of the expedition, that all the carriages had been\nplaced at the park gates, and that they had all set out more than an\nhour ago.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Monsieur, \"the idea is a good one; the heat is very\noppressive, and I have no objection to bathe, too.\"\n\nHe summoned his servants, but no one came. He summoned those in\nattendance on Madame, but everybody had gone out. He went to the\nstables, where he was informed by a groom that there were no carriages\nof any description. He desired that a couple of horses should be\nsaddled, one for himself and the other for his valet. The groom told him\nthat all the horses had been sent away. Monsieur, pale with anger, again\ndescended towards the queen's apartments, and penetrated as far as\nAnne of Austria's oratory, where he perceived, through the half-opened\ntapestry-hangings, his young and beautiful sister on her knees before\nthe queen-mother, who appeared weeping bitterly. He had not been either\nseen or heard. He cautiously approached the opening, and listened, the\nsight of so much grief having aroused his curiosity. Not only was the\nyoung queen weeping, but she was complaining also. \"Yes,\" she said, \"the\nking neglects me, the king devotes himself to pleasures and amusements\nonly, in which I have no share.\"\n\n\"Patience, patience, my daughter,\" said Anne of Austria, in Spanish; and\nthen, also in Spanish, added some words of advice, which Monsieur did\nnot understand. The queen replied by accusations, mingled with sighs and\nsobs, among which Monsieur often distinguished the word _banos_, which\nMaria Theresa accentuated with spiteful anger.\n\n\"The baths,\" said Monsieur to himself; \"it seems it is the baths that\nhave put her out.\" And he endeavored to put together the disconnected\nphrases which he had been able to understand. It was easy to guess that\nthe queen was complaining bitterly, and that, if Anne of Austria did not\nconsole her, she at least endeavored to do so. Monsieur was afraid to\nbe detected listening at the door and he therefore made up his mind to\ncough; the two queens turned round at the sound and Monsieur entered. At\nsight of the prince, the young queen rose precipitately, and dried her\ntears. Monsieur, however, knew the people he had to deal with too\nwell, and was naturally too polite to remain silent, and he accordingly\nsaluted them. The queen-mother smiled pleasantly at him, saying, \"What\ndo you want, Philip?\"\n\n\"I?--nothing,\" stammered Monsieur. \"I was looking for--\"\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"I was looking for Madame.\"\n\n\"Madame is at the baths.\"\n\n\"And the king?\" said Monsieur, in a tone which made the queen tremble.\n\n\"The king also, the whole court as well,\" replied Anne of Austria.\n\n\"Except you, madame,\" said Monsieur.\n\n\"Oh! I,\" said the young queen, \"I seem to terrify all those who amuse\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"And so do I,--judging from appearances,\" rejoined Monsieur.\n\nAnne of Austria made a sigh to her daughter-in-law, who withdrew,\nweeping.\n\nMonsieur's brows contracted, as he remarked aloud, \"What a cheerless\nhouse. What do you think of it, mother?\"\n\n\"Why, no; everybody here is pleasure-hunting.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, that is the very thing that makes those dull who do not\ncare for pleasure.\"\n\n\"In what a tone you say that, Philip.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, madame, I speak as I think.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself; what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Ask my sister-in-law, rather, who, just now, was detailing all her\ngrievances to you.\"\n\n\"Her grievances, what--\"\n\n\"Yes, I was listening; accidentally, I confess, but still I listened--so\nthat I heard only too well my sister complain of those famous baths of\nMadame--\"\n\n\"Ah! folly!\"\n\n\"No, no, no; people are not always foolish when they weep. The queen\nsaid _banos_, which means baths.\"\n\n\"I repeat, Philip,\" said Anne of Austria, \"that your sister is\nchildishly jealous.\"\n\n\"In that case, madame,\" replied the prince, \"I, too, must with great\nhumility accuse myself of possessing the same defect.\"\n\n\"You also, Philip?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Are you really jealous of these baths?\"\n\n\"And why not, madame, when the king goes to the baths with my wife, and\ndoes not take the queen? Why not, when Madame goes to the baths with the\nking, and does not do me the honor to even invite me? And you enjoin my\nsister-in-law to be satisfied, and require me to be satisfied, too.\"\n\n\"You are raving, my dear Philip,\" said Anne of Austria; \"you have driven\nthe Duke of Buckingham away; you have been the cause of M. de Guiche's\nexile; do you now wish to send the king away from Fontainebleau?\"\n\n\"I do not pretend to anything of the kind, madame,\" said Monsieur,\nbitterly; \"but, at least, I can withdraw, and I shall do so.\"\n\n\"Jealous of the king--jealous of your brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, I am jealous of the king--of my own brother, and\nremarkably jealous, too.\"\n\n\"Really, Monsieur,\" exclaimed Anne of Austria, affecting to be\nindignant, \"I begin to believe you are mad, and a sworn enemy to my\nrepose. I therefore abandon the place to you, for I have no means of\ndefending myself against such monomanias.\"\n\nShe arose and left Monsieur a prey to the most extravagant transport\nof passion. He remained for a moment completely bewildered; then,\nrecovering himself, again went to the stables, found the groom, once\nmore asked him for a carriage or a horse, and upon his reply that there\nwas neither the one or the other, Monsieur snatched a long whip from the\nhand of a stable-boy, and began to pursue the poor devil of a groom all\nround the servants' courtyard, whipping him the while, in spite of his\ncries and excuses; then, quite out of breath, covered with perspiration,\nand trembling in every limb, he returned to his own apartments, broke\nin pieces some beautiful specimens of porcelain, and then got into bed,\nbooted and spurred as he was, crying out for some one to come to him.\n[4]\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI. The Bath.\n\nAt Vulaines, beneath the impenetrable shade of flowering osiers\nand willows, which, as they bent down their green heads, dipped\nthe extremities of their branches in the blue waters, a long and\nflat-bottomed boat, with ladders covered with long blue curtains, served\nas a refuge for the bathing Dianas, who, as they left the water, were\nwatched by twenty plumed Acteons, who, eagerly, and full of admiration,\ngalloped up and down the flowery banks of the river. But Diana\nherself, even the chaste Diana, clothed in her long chlamys, was less\nbeautiful--less impenetrable, than Madame, as young and beautiful\nas that goddess herself. For, notwithstanding the fine tunic of the\nhuntress, her round and delicate knee can be seen; and notwithstanding\nthe sonorous quiver, her brown shoulders can be detected; whereas, in\nMadame's case, a long white veil enveloped her, wrapping her round and\nround a hundred times, as she resigned herself into the hands of her\nfemale attendants, and thus was rendered inaccessible to the most\nindiscreet, as well as to the most penetrating gaze. When she ascended\nthe ladder, the poets were present--and all were poets when Madame was\nthe subject of discussion--the twenty poets who were galloping about,\nstopped, and with one voice, exclaimed that pearls, and not drops of\nwater, were falling from her person, to be lost again in the happy\nriver. The king, the center of these effusions, and of this respectful\nhomage, imposed silence upon those expatiators, for whom it seemed\nimpossible to exhaust their raptures, and he rode away, for fear of\noffending, even through the silken curtains, the modesty of the woman\nand the dignity of the princess. A great blank thereupon ensued in\nthe scene, and perfect silence in the boat. From the movements on\nboard--from the flutterings and agitations of the curtains--the goings\nto and fro of the female attendants engaged in their duties, could be\nguessed.\n\nThe king smilingly listened to the conversation of the courtiers around\nhim, but it could easily be perceived that he gave but little, if any,\nattention to their remarks. In fact, hardly had the sound of the rings\ndrawn along the curtain-rods announced that Madame was dressed, and that\nthe goddess was about to make her reappearance, than the king,\nreturning to his former post immediately, and running quite close to\nthe river-bank, gave the signal for all those to approach whose duty\nor pleasure summoned them to Madame's side. The pages hurried forward,\nconducting the led horses; the carriages, which had remained sheltered\nunder the trees, advanced towards the tent, followed by a crowd of\nservants, bearers, and female attendants, who, while their masters had\nbeen bathing, had mutually exchanged their own observations, critical\nremarks, and the discussion of matters personal--the fugitive journal\nof that period, of which no one now remembers anything, not even by the\nwaves, the witnesses of what went on that day--themselves now sublimed\ninto immensity, as the actors have vanished into eternity.\n\nA crowd of people swarming upon the banks of the river, without\nreckoning the groups of peasants drawn together by their anxiety to see\nthe king and the princess, was, for many minutes, the most disorderly,\nbut the most agreeable, mob imaginable. The king dismounted from his\nhorse, a movement which was imitated by all the courtiers, and offered\nhis hat to Madame, whose rich riding-habit displayed her fine figure,\nwhich was set off to great advantage by that garment, made of fine\nwoolen cloth embroidered with silver. Her hair, still damp and blacker\nthan jet, hung in heavy masses upon her white and delicate neck. Joy and\nhealth sparkled in her beautiful eyes; composed, yet full of energy, she\ninhaled the air in deep draughts, under a lace parasol, which was borne\nby one of her pages. Nothing could be more charming, more graceful, more\npoetical, than these two figures buried under the rose-colored shade\nof the parasol, the king, whose white teeth were displayed in continual\nsmiles, and Madame, whose black eyes sparkled like carbuncles in the\nglittering reflection of the changing hues of the silk. When Madame\napproached her horse, a magnificent animal of Andalusian breed, of\nspotless white, somewhat heavy, perhaps, but with a spirited and\nsplendid head, in which the mixture, happily combined, of Arabian and\nSpanish blood could be readily traced, and whose long tail swept the\nground; and as the princess affected difficulty in mounting, the king\ntook her in his arms in such a manner that Madame's arm was clasped like\na circlet of alabaster around the king's neck. Louis, as he withdrew,\ninvoluntarily touched with his lips the arm, which was not withheld, and\nthe princess having thanked her royal equerry, every one sprang to his\nsaddle at the same moment. The king and Madame drew aside to allow the\ncarriages, the outriders, and runners, to pass by. A fair proportion of\nthe cavaliers, released from the restraint etiquette had imposed upon\nthem, gave the rein to their horses, and darted after the carriages\nwhich bore the maids of honor, as blooming as so many virgin huntresses\naround Diana, and the human whirlwind, laughing, chattering, and noisy,\npassed onward.\n\nThe king and Madame, however, kept their horses in hand at a foot-pace.\nBehind his majesty and his sister-in-law, certain of the courtiers\n--those, at least, who were seriously disposed or were anxious to be\nwithin reach, or under the eyes, of the king--followed at a respectful\ndistance, restraining their impatient horses, regulating their pace by\nthat of the king and Madame, and abandoned themselves to all the delight\nand gratification which is to be found in the conversation of clever\npeople, who can, with perfect courtesy, make a thousand atrocious, but\nlaughable remarks about their neighbors. In their stifled laughter, and\nin the little reticences of their sardonic humor, Monsieur, the poor\nabsentee, was not spared. But they pitied, and bewailed greatly, the\nfate of De Guiche, and it must be confessed that their compassion, as\nfar as he was concerned, was not misplaced. The king and Madame having\nbreathed the horses, and repeated a hundred times over such remarks as\nthe courtiers, who supplied them with talk, suggested to them, set off\nat a hand gallop, and the leafy coverts of the forest resounded to the\nfootfalls of the mounted party. To the conversations beneath the\nshade of the trees,--to remarks made in the shape of confidential\ncommunications, and observations, mysteriously exchanged, succeeded the\nnoisiest bursts of laughter;--from the very outriders to royalty itself,\nmerriment seemed to spread. Every one began to laugh and to cry out.\nThe magpies and the jays fluttered away uttering their guttural cries,\nbeneath the waving avenues of oaks; the cuckoo staid his monotonous cry\nin the recesses of the forest; the chaffinch and tomtit flew away in\nclouds; while the terrified deer bounded riverwards from the midst of\nthe thickets. This crowd, spreading joy, confusion, and light wherever\nit passed, was heralded, it may be said, to the chateau by its own\nclamor. As the king and Madame entered the village, they were received\nby the acclamations of the crowd. Madame hastened to look for Monsieur,\nfor she instinctively understood that he had been far too long kept from\nsharing in this joy. The king went to rejoin the queens; he knew he owed\nthem--one especially--a compensation for his long absence. But Madame\nwas not admitted to Monsieur's apartments, and she was informed that\nMonsieur was asleep. The king, instead of being met by Maria Theresa\nsmiling, as was usual with her, found Anne of Austria in the gallery\nwatching for his return, who advanced to meet him, and taking him by the\nhand, led him to her own apartment. No one ever knew what was the nature\nof the conversation which took place between them, or rather what it was\nthat the queen-mother said to Louis XIV.; but the general tenor of the\ninterview might certainly be guessed from the annoyed expression of the\nking's face as he left her.\n\nBut we, whose mission it is to interpret all things, as it is also to\ncommunicate our interpretations to our readers,--we should fail in\nour duty, if we were to leave them in ignorance of the result of this\ninterview. It will be found sufficiently detailed, at least we hope so,\nin the following chapter.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII. The Butterfly-Chase.\n\nThe king, on retiring to his apartments to give some directions and\nto arrange his ideas, found on his toilette-glass a small note, the\nhandwriting of which seemed disguised. He opened it and read--\"Come\nquickly, I have a thousand things to say to you.\" The king and Madame\nhad not been separated a sufficiently long time for these thousand\nthings to be the result of the three thousand which they had been\nsaying to each other during the route which separated Vulaines from\nFontainebleau. The confused and hurried character of the note gave the\nking a great deal to reflect upon. He occupied himself but slightly with\nhis toilette, and set off to pay his visit to Madame. The princess, who\ndid not wish to have the appearance of expecting him, had gone into the\ngardens with the ladies of her suite. When the king was informed that\nMadame had left her apartments and had gone for a walk in the gardens,\nhe collected all the gentlemen he could find, and invited them to follow\nhim. He found Madame engaged in chasing butterflies, on a large lawn\nbordered with heliotrope and flowering broom. She was looking on as the\nmost adventurous and youngest of her ladies ran to and fro, and with her\nback turned to a high hedge, very impatiently awaited the arrival of the\nking, with whom she had appointed the rendezvous. The sound of many feet\nupon the gravel walk made her turn round. Louis XIV. was hatless, he\nhad struck down with his cane a peacock butterfly, which Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan had picked up from the ground quite stunned.\n\n\"You see, Madame,\" said the king, as he approached her, \"that I, too,\nam hunting on your behalf!\" and then, turning towards those who had\naccompanied him, said, \"Gentlemen, see if each of you cannot obtain as\nmuch for these ladies,\" a remark which was a signal for all to retire.\nAnd thereupon a curious spectacle might have been observed; old and\ncorpulent courtiers were seen running after butterflies, losing their\nhats as they ran, and with their raised canes cutting down the myrtles\nand the furze, as they would have done the Spaniards.\n\nThe king offered Madame his arm, and they both selected, as the center\nof observation, a bench with a roof of boards and moss, a kind of hut\nroughly designed by the modest genius of one of the gardeners who had\ninaugurated the picturesque and fanciful amid the formal style of\nthe gardening of that period. This sheltered retreat, covered with\nnasturtiums and climbing roses, screened the bench, so that the\nspectators, insulated in the middle of the lawn, saw and were seen on\nevery side, but could not be heard, without perceiving those who might\napproach for the purpose of listening. Seated thus, the king made a sign\nof encouragement to those who were running about; and then, as if he\nwere engaged with Madame in a dissertation upon the butterfly, which he\nhad thrust through with a gold pin and fastened on his hat, said to her,\n\"How admirably we are placed here for conversations.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, for I wished to be heard by you alone, and yet to be seen by\nevery one.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" said Louis.\n\n\"My note surprised you?\"\n\n\"Terrified me rather. But what I have to tell you is more important.\"\n\n\"It cannot be, sire. Do you know that Monsieur refuses to see me?\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Can you not guess why?\"\n\n\"Ah, Madame! in that case we have both the same thing to say to each\nother.\"\n\n\"What has happened to you, then?\"\n\n\"You wish me to begin?\"\n\n\"Yes, for I have told you all.\"\n\n\"Well, then, as soon as I returned, I found my mother waiting for me,\nand she led me away to her own apartments.\"\n\n\"The queen-mother?\" said Madame, with some anxiety, \"the matter is\nserious then.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is, for she told me... but, in the first place, allow me to\npreface what I have to say with one remark. Has Monsieur ever spoken to\nyou about me?\"\n\n\"Often.\"\n\n\"Has he ever spoken to you about his jealousy?\"\n\n\"More frequently still.\"\n\n\"Of his jealousy of me?\"\n\n\"No, but of the Duke of Buckingham and De Guiche.\"\n\n\"Well, Madame, Monsieur's present idea is a jealousy of myself.\"\n\n\"Really,\" replied the princess, smiling archly.\n\n\"And it really seems to me,\" continued the king, \"that we have never\ngiven any ground--\"\n\n\"Never! at least _I_ have not. But who told you that Monsieur was\njealous?\"\n\n\"My mother represented to me that Monsieur entered her apartments like a\nmadman, that he uttered a thousand complaints against you, and--forgive\nme for saying it--against your coquetry. It appears that Monsieur\nindulges in injustice, too.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, sire.\"\n\n\"My mother reassured him; but he pretended that people reassure him too\noften, and that he had had quite enough of it.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better for him not to make himself uneasy in any way?\"\n\n\"The very thing I said.\"\n\n\"Confess, sire, that the world is very wicked. Is it possible that a\nbrother and sister cannot converse together, or take pleasure in each\nother's company, without giving rise to remarks and suspicions? For\nindeed, sire, we are doing no harm, and have no intention of doing any.\"\nAnd she looked at the king with that proud yet provoking glance that\nkindles desire in the coldest and wisest of men.\n\n\"No!\" sighed the king, \"that is true.\"\n\n\"You know very well, sire, that if it were to continue, I should be\nobliged to make a disturbance. Do you decide upon our conduct, and say\nwhether it has, or has not, been perfectly correct.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly--perfectly correct.\"\n\n\"Often alone together,--for we delight in the same things,--we might\npossibly be led away into error, but _have_ we been? I regard you as a\nbrother, and nothing more.\"\n\nThe king frowned. She continued:\n\n\"Your hand, which often meets my own, does not excite in me that\nagitation and emotion which is the case with those who love each other,\nfor instance--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said the king, \"enough, I entreat you. You have no pity--you\nare killing me.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"In fact, then, you distinctly say you experience nothing when near me.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! I don't say that--my affection--\"\n\n\"Enough, Henrietta, I again entreat you. If you believe me to be marble,\nas you are, undeceive yourself.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, sire.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the king, casting down his eyes. \"And so our meetings,\nthe pressure of each other's hand, the looks we have exchanged--Yes,\nyes; you are right, and I understand your meaning,\" and he buried his\nface in his hands.\n\n\"Take care, sire,\" said Madame, hurriedly, \"Monsieur de Saint-Aignan is\nlooking at you.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Louis, angrily; \"never even the shadow of liberty!\nnever any sincerity in my intercourse with any one! I imagine I have\nfound a friend, who is nothing but a spy; a dearer friend, who is only\na--sister!\"\n\nMadame was silent, and cast down her eyes.\n\n\"My husband is jealous,\" she murmured, in a tone of which nothing could\nequal its sweetness and charm.\n\n\"You are right,\" exclaimed the king, suddenly.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, looking at him in a manner that set his heart on\nfire, \"you are free, you are not suspected, the peace of your house is\nnot disturbed.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said the king, \"as yet you know nothing, for the queen is\njealous.\"\n\n\"Maria Theresa!\"\n\n\"Stark mad with jealousy! Monsieur's jealousy arises from hers; she was\nweeping and complaining to my mother, and was reproaching us for those\nbathing parties, which have made me so happy.\"\n\n\"And me too,\" answered Madame, by a look.\n\n\"When, suddenly,\" continued the king, \"Monsieur, who was listening,\nheard the word '_banos_,' which the queen pronounced with some degree\nof bitterness, that awakened his attention; he entered the room, looking\nquite wild, broke into the conversation, and began to quarrel with my\nmother so bitterly that she was obliged to leave him; so that, while you\nhave a jealous husband to deal with, I shall have perpetually present\nbefore me a specter of jealousy with swollen eyes, a cadaverous face,\nand sinister looks.\"\n\n\"Poor king,\" murmured Madame, as she lightly touched the king's hand.\nHe retained her hand in his, and in order to press it without exciting\nsuspicion in the spectators, who were not so much taken up with the\nbutterflies that they could not occupy themselves about other matters,\nand who perceived clearly enough that there was some mystery in the\nking's and Madame's conversation, Louis placed the dying butterfly\nbefore his sister-in-law, and bent over it as if to count the thousand\neyes of its wings, or the particles of golden dust which covered it.\nNeither of them spoke; however, their hair mingled, their breaths\nunited, and their hands feverishly throbbed in each other's grasp. Five\nminutes passed in this manner.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII. What Was Caught after the Butterflies.\n\nThe two young people remained for a moment with their heads bent down,\nbowed, as it were, beneath the double thought of the love which was\nspringing up in their hearts, and which gives birth to so many happy\nfancies in the imaginations of twenty years of age. Henrietta gave\na side glance, from time to time, at the king. Hers was one of those\nfinely-organized natures capable of looking inwardly at itself, as well\nas at others at the same moment. She perceived Love lying at the bottom\nof Louis's heart, as a skillful diver sees a pearl at the bottom of\nthe sea. She knew Louis was hesitating, if not in doubt, and that his\nindolent or timid heart required aid and encouragement. \"And so?\" she\nsaid, interrogatively, breaking the silence.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Louis, after a moment's pause.\n\n\"I mean, that I shall be obliged to return to the resolution I had\nformed.\"\n\n\"To what resolution?\"\n\n\"To that which I have already submitted to your majesty.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"On the very day we had a certain explanation about Monsieur's\njealousies.\"\n\n\"What did you say to me then?\" inquired Louis, with some anxiety.\n\n\"Do you not remember, sire?\"\n\n\"Alas! if it be another cause of unhappiness, I shall recollect it soon\nenough.\"\n\n\"A cause of unhappiness for myself alone, sire,\" replied Madame\nHenrietta; \"but as it is necessary, I must submit to it.\"\n\n\"At least, tell me what it is,\" said the king.\n\n\"Absence.\"\n\n\"Still that unkind resolve?\"\n\n\"Believe me, sire, I have not found it without a violent struggle with\nmyself; it is absolutely necessary I should return to England.\"\n\n\"Never, never will I permit you to leave France,\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"And yet, sire,\" said Madame, affecting a gentle yet sorrowful\ndetermination, \"nothing is more urgently necessary; nay, more than that,\nI am persuaded it is your mother's desire I should do so.\"\n\n\"Desire!\" exclaimed the king; \"that is a very strange expression to use\nto me.\"\n\n\"Still,\" replied Madame Henrietta, smilingly, \"are you not happy in\nsubmitting to the wishes of so good a mother?\"\n\n\"Enough, I implore you; you rend my very soul.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes; for you speak of your departure with tranquillity.\"\n\n\"I was not born for happiness, sire,\" replied the princess, dejectedly;\n\"and I acquired, in very early life, the habit of seeing my dearest\nwishes disappointed.\"\n\n\"Do you speak truly?\" said the king. \"Would your departure gainsay any\none of your cherished thoughts?\"\n\n\"If I were to say 'yes,' would you begin to take your misfortune\npatiently?\"\n\n\"How cruel you are!\"\n\n\"Take care, sire; some one is coming.\"\n\nThe king looked all round him, and said, \"No, there is no one,\" and\nthen continued: \"Come, Henrietta, instead of trying to contend against\nMonsieur's jealousy by a departure which would kill me--\"\n\nHenrietta slightly shrugged her shoulders like a woman unconvinced.\n\"Yes,\" repeated Louis, \"which would kill me, I say. Instead of fixing\nyour mind on this departure, does not your imagination--or rather does\nnot your heart--suggest some expedient?\"\n\n\"What is it you wish my heart to suggest?\"\n\n\"Tell me, how can one prove to another that it is wrong to be jealous?\"\n\n\"In the first place, sire, by giving no motive for jealousy; in other\nwords, in loving no one but the person in question.\"\n\n\"Oh! I expected more than that.\"\n\n\"What did you expect?\"\n\n\"That you would simply tell me that jealous people are pacified\nby concealing the affection which is entertained for the object of\njealousy.\"\n\n\"Dissimulation is difficult, sire.\"\n\n\"Yet it is only be means of conquering difficulties that any happiness\nis attained. As far as I am concerned, I swear I will give the lie to\nthose who are jealous of me by pretending to treat you like any other\nwoman.\"\n\n\"A bad, as well as unsafe, means,\" said the young princess, shaking her\npretty head.\n\n\"You seem to think everything bad, dear Henrietta,\" said Louis,\ndiscontentedly. \"You negative everything I propose. Suggest, at least,\nsomething else in its stead. Come, try and think. I trust implicitly to\na woman's invention. Do you invent in your turn?\"\n\n\"Well, sire, I have hit upon something. Will you listen to it?\"\n\n\"Can you ask me? You speak of a matter of life or death to me, and then\nask if I will listen.\"\n\n\"Well, I judge of it by my own case. If my husband intended to put me on\nthe wrong scent with regard to another woman, one thing would reassure\nme more than anything else.\"\n\n\"What would that be?\"\n\n\"In the first place to see that he never took any notice of the woman in\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That is precisely what I said just now.\"\n\n\"Very well; but in order to be perfectly reassured on the subject, I\nshould like to see him occupy himself with some one else.\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand you,\" replied Louis, smiling. \"But confess, dear\nHenrietta, if the means is at least ingenious, it is hardly charitable.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"In curing the dread of a wound in a jealous person's mind, you inflict\none upon the heart. His fear ceases, it is true; but the evil still\nexists; and that seems to me to be far worse.\"\n\n\"Agreed; but he does not detect, he does not suspect the real enemy; he\ndoes no prejudice to love itself; he concentrates all his strength on\nthe side where his strength will do no injury to anything or any one.\nIn a word, sire, my plan, which I confess I am surprised to find you\ndispute, is mischievous to jealous people, it is true; but to lovers it\nis full of advantage. Besides, let me ask, sire, who, except yourself,\nhas ever thought of pitying jealous people? Are they not a melancholy\ncrew of grumblers always equally unhappy, whether with or without\na cause? You may remove that cause, but you never can remove their\nsufferings. It is a disease which lies in the imagination, and, like all\nimaginary disorders, it is incurable. By the by, I remember an aphorism\nupon this subject, of poor Dr. Dawley, a clever and amusing man, who,\nhad it not been for my brother, who could not do without him, I should\nhave with me now. He used to say, 'Whenever you are likely to suffer\nfrom two affections, choose that which will give you the least trouble,\nand I will allow you to retain it; for it is positive,' he said, 'that\nthat very ailment is of the greatest service to me, in order to enable\nme to get rid of the other.'\"\n\n\"Well and judiciously remarked, Henrietta,\" replied the king, smiling.\n\n\"Oh! we have some clever people in London, sire.\"\n\n\"And those clever people produce adorable pupils. I will grant this\nDaley, Darley, Dawley, or whatever you call him, a pension for his\naphorism; but I entreat you, Henrietta, to begin by choosing the least\nof your evils. You do not answer--you smile. I guess that the least of\nyour bugbears is your stay in France. I will allow you to retain this\ninformation; and, in order to begin with the cure of the other, I will\nthis very day begin to look out for a subject which shall divert the\nattention of the jealous members of either sex who persecute us both.\"\n\n\"Hush! this time some one is really coming,\" said Madame; and she\nstooped to gather a flower from the thick grass at her feet. Some one,\nin fact, was approaching; for, suddenly, a bevy of young girls ran down\nfrom the top of the hillock, following the cavaliers--the cause of this\ninterruption being a magnificent hawk-moth, with wings like rose-leaves.\nThe prey in question had fallen into the net of Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente, who displayed it with some pride to her less successful\nrivals. The queen of the chase had seated herself some twenty paces from\nthe bank on which Louis and Madame Henrietta were reclining; and leaned\nher back against a magnificent oak-tree entwined with ivy, and stuck\nthe butterfly on the long cane she carried in her hand. Mademoiselle\nde Tonnay-Charente was very beautiful, and the gentlemen, accordingly,\ndeserted her companions, and under the pretext of complimenting her\nupon her success, pressed in a circle around her. The king and princess\nlooked gloomily at this scene, as spectators of maturer age look on\nat the games of little children. \"They seem to be amusing themselves\nthere,\" said the king.\n\n\"Greatly, sire; I have always found that people are amused wherever\nyouth and beauty are to be found.\"\n\n\"What do you think of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, Henrietta?\"\ninquired the king.\n\n\"I think she has rather too much flax-yellow and lily-whiteness in her\ncomplexion,\" replied Madame, fixing in a moment upon the only fault it\nwas possible to find in the almost perfect beauty of the future Madame\nde Montespan.\"\n\n\"Rather too fair, yes; but beautiful, I think, in spite of that.\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, really.\"\n\n\"Very well; and it is mine, too.\"\n\n\"And she seems to be much sought after.\"\n\n\"On, that is a matter of course. Lovers flutter from one to another. If\nwe had hunted for lovers instead of butterflies, you can see, from those\nwho surround her, what successful sport we should have had.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Henrietta, what would be said if the king were to make himself\none of those lovers, and let his glance fall in that direction? Would\nsome one else be jealous, in such a case?\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is a very efficacious\nremedy,\" said Madame, with a sigh. \"She would cure a jealous man,\ncertainly; but she might possibly make a woman jealous, too.\"\n\n\"Henrietta,\" exclaimed Louis, \"you fill my heart with joy. Yes, yes;\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is far too beautiful to serve as a\ncloak.\"\n\n\"A king's cloak,\" said Madame Henrietta, smiling, \"ought to be\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"Do you advise me to do it, then?\" inquired Louis.\n\n\"I! what should I say, sire, except that to give such an advice would be\nto supply arms against myself? It would be folly or pride to advise you\nto take, for the heroine of an assumed affection, a woman more beautiful\nthan the one for whom you pretend to feel real regard.\"\n\nThe king tried to take Madame's hand in his own; his eyes sought hers;\nand then he murmured a few words so full of tenderness, but pronounced\nin so low a tone, that the historian, who ought to hear everything,\ncould not hear them. Then, speaking aloud, he said, \"Do you yourself\nchoose for me the one who is to cure our jealous friend. To her, then,\nall my devotion, all my attention, all the time that I can spare from\nmy occupations, shall be devoted. For her shall be the flower that I\nmay pluck for you, the fond thoughts with which you have inspired me.\nTowards her I will direct the glance I dare not bestow upon you, and\nwhich ought to be able to rouse you from your indifference. But, be\ncareful in your selection, lest, in offering her the rose which I may\nhave plucked, I find myself conquered by you; and my looks, my hand, my\nlips, turn immediately towards you, even were the whole world to guess\nmy secret.\"\n\nWhile these words escaped from the king's lips, in a stream of wild\naffection, Madame blushed, breathless, happy, proud, almost intoxicated\nwith delight. She could find nothing to say in reply; her pride and her\nthirst for homage were satisfied. \"I shall fail,\" she said, raising her\nbeautiful black eyes, \"but not as you beg me, for all this incense which\nyou wish to burn on the altar of another divinity. Ah! sire, I too shall\nbe jealous of it, and want restored to me; and would not that a particle\nof it should be lost in the way. Therefore, sire, with your royal\npermission, I will choose one who shall appear to me the least likely\nto distract your attention, and who will leave my image intact and\nunshadowed in your heart.\"\n\n\"Happily for me,\" said the king, \"your heart is not hard and unfeeling.\nIf it were so, I should be alarmed at the threat you hold out.\nPrecautions were taken on this point, and around you, as around myself,\nit would be difficult to meet with a disagreeable-looking face.\"\n\nWhilst the king was speaking, Madame had risen from her seat, looked\naround the greensward, and after a careful and silent examination,\nshe called the king to her side, and said, \"See yonder, sire, upon the\ndeclivity of that little hill, near that group of Guelder roses, that\nbeautiful girl walking alone, her head down, her arms hanging by her\nside, with her eyes fixed upon the flowers, which she crushes beneath\nher feet, like one who is lost in thought.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Valliere, do you mean?\" remarked the king.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Will she not suit you, sire?\"\n\n\"Why, look how thin the poor child is. She has hardly any flesh upon her\nbones.\"\n\n\"Nay: am I stout then?\"\n\n\"She is so melancholy.\"\n\n\"The greater contrast to myself, who am accused of being too lively.\"\n\n\"She is lame.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it. Look; she has allowed every one to pass by her, through\nfear of her defect being remarked.\"\n\n\"Well, she will not run so fast as Daphne, and will not be as able to\nescape Apollo.\"\n\n\"Henrietta,\" said the king, out of temper; \"of all your maids of honor,\nyou have really selected for me the one most full of defects.\"\n\n\"Still she is one of my maids of honor.\"\n\n\"Of course; but what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that, in order to visit this new divinity, you will not be able\nto do so without paying a visit to my apartments, and that, as propriety\nwill forbid your conversing with her in private, you will be compelled\nto see her in my circle, to speak, as it were, at me, while speaking to\nher. I mean, in fact, that those who may be jealous, will be wrong if\nthey suppose you come to my apartments for my sake, since you will go\nthere for Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\n\"Who happens to be lame.\"\n\n\"Hardly that.\"\n\n\"Who never opens her lips.\"\n\n\"But who, when she does open them, displays a beautiful set of teeth.\"\n\n\"Who may serve as a model for an osteologist.\"\n\n\"Your favor will change her appearance.\"\n\n\"Henrietta!\"\n\n\"At all events you allowed me to choose.\"\n\n\"Alas! yes.\"\n\n\"Well, my choice is made: I impose her upon you, and you must submit.\"\n\n\"Oh! I would accept one of the furies, if you were to insist upon it.\"\n\n\"La Valliere is as gentle as a lamb: do not fear she will ever\ncontradict you when you tell her you love her,\" said Madame, laughing.\n\n\"You are not afraid, are you, that I shall say too much to her?\"\n\n\"It would be for my sake.\"\n\n\"The treaty is agreed to, then?\"\n\n\"Not only so, but signed. You will continue to show me the friendship of\na brother, the attention of a brother, the gallantry of a monarch, will\nyou not?\"\n\n\"I will preserve for you intact a heart that has already become\naccustomed to beat only at your command.\"\n\n\"Very well, do you not see that we have guaranteed the future by this\nmeans?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Will your mother cease to regard me as an enemy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will Maria Theresa leave off speaking in Spanish before Monsieur,\nwho has a horror of conversation held in foreign languages, because\nhe always thinks he is being ill spoken of? and lastly,\" continued the\nprincess, \"will people persist in attributing a wrongful affection to\nthe king when the truth is, we can offer nothing to each other, except\nabsolute sympathy, free from mental reservation?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the king, hesitatingly. \"But other things may still be\nsaid of us.\"\n\n\"What can be said, sire? shall we never be left in tranquillity?\"\n\n\"People will say I am deficient in taste; but what is my self-respect in\ncomparison with your tranquillity?\"\n\n\"In comparison with my honor, sire, and that of our family, you mean.\nBesides, I beg you to attend, do not be so hastily prejudiced against La\nValliere. She is slightly lame, it is true, but she is not deficient in\ngood sense. Moreover, all that the king touches is converted into gold.\"\n\n\"Well, Madame, rest assured of one thing, namely, that I am still\ngrateful to you: you might even yet make me pay dearer for your stay in\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Sire, some one approaches.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"One last word.\"\n\n\"Say it.\"\n\n\"You are prudent and judicious, sire; but in the present instance you\nwill be obliged to summon to your aid all your prudence, and all your\njudgment.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Louis, laughing, \"from this very day I shall begin to\nact my part, and you shall see whether I am not quite fit to represent\nthe character of a tender swain. After luncheon, there will be a\npromenade in the forest, and then there is supper and the ballet at ten\no'clock.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"The ardor of my passion shall blaze more brilliantly than the\nfireworks, shall shine more steadily than our friend Colbert's lamps;\nit shall shine so dazzlingly that the queens and Monsieur will be almost\nblinded by it.\"\n\n\"Take care, sire, take care.\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name, what have I done, then?\"\n\n\"I shall begin to recall the compliments I paid you just now. You\nprudent! you wise! did I say? Why, you begin by the most reckless\ninconsistencies! Can a passion be kindled in this manner, like a torch,\nin a moment? Can a monarch, such as you are, without any preparation,\nfall at the feet of a girl like La Valliere?\"\n\n\"Ah! Henrietta, now I understand you. We have not yet begun the\ncampaign, and you are plundering me already.\"\n\n\"No, I am only recalling you to common-sense ideas. Let your passion be\nkindled gradually, instead of allowing it to burst forth so suddenly.\nJove's thunders and lightnings are heard and seen before the palace\nis set on fire. Everything has its commencements. If you are so easily\nexcited, no one will believe you are really captivated, and every one\nwill think you out of your senses--if even, indeed, the truth itself not\nbe guessed. The public is not so fatuous as they seem.\"\n\nThe king was obliged to admit that Madame was an angel for sense, and\nthe very reverse for cleverness. He bowed, and said: \"Agreed, Madame,\nI will think over my plan of attack: great military men--my cousin\nDe Conde for instance--grow pale in meditation upon their strategical\nplans, before they move one of the pawns, which people call armies; I\ntherefore wish to draw up a complete plan of campaign; for you know that\nthe tender passion is subdivided in a variety of ways. Well, then,\nI shall stop at the village of Little Attentions, at the hamlet of\nLove-Letters, before I follow the road of Visible Affection; the way is\nclear enough, you know, and poor Madame de Scudery would never forgive\nme for passing though a halting-place without stopping.\"\n\n\"Oh! now we have returned to our proper senses, shall we say adieu,\nsire?\"\n\n\"Alas! it must be so, for see, we are interrupted.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Henrietta, \"they are bringing Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente and her sphinx butterfly in grand procession this way.\"\n\n\"It is perfectly well understood, that this evening, during the\npromenade, I am to make my escape into the forest, and find La Valliere\nwithout you.\"\n\n\"I will take care to send her away.\"\n\n\"Very well! I will speak to her when she is with her companions, and I\nwill then discharge my first arrow at her.\"\n\n\"Be skillful,\" said Madame, laughing, \"and do not miss the heart.\"\n\nThen the princess took leave of the king, and went forward to meet the\nmerry troop, which was advancing with much ceremony, and a great many\npretended flourishes of trumpets, imitated with their mouths.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX. The Ballet of the Seasons.\n\nAt the conclusion of the banquet, which was served at five o'clock, the\nking entered his cabinet, where his tailors were awaiting him for the\npurpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing Spring, which\nwas the result of so much imagination, and had cost so many efforts of\nthought to the designers and ornament-workers of the court. As for the\nballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and\nhow to perform it. The king had resolved to make it surprise. Hardly,\ntherefore, had he finished his conference, and entered his own\napartment, than he desired his two masters of the ceremonies, Villeroy\nand Saint-Aignan, to be sent for. Both replied that they only awaited\nhis orders, and that everything was ready to begin, but that it was\nnecessary to be sure of fine weather and a favorable night before these\norders could be carried out. The king opened his window; the pale-gold\nhues of the evening were visible on the horizon through the vistas of\nthe wood, and the moon, white as snow, was already mounting the heavens.\nNot a ripple could be noticed on the surface of the green waters; the\nswans themselves, even, reposing with folded wings like ships at anchor,\nseemed inspirations of the warmth of the air, the freshness of the\nwater, and the silence of the beautiful evening. The king, having\nobserved all these things, and contemplated the magnificent picture\nbefore him, gave the order which De Villeroy and De Saint-Aignan\nawaited; but with a view of insuring the execution of this order in a\nroyal manner, one last question was necessary, and Louis XIV. put it to\nthe two gentlemen in the following manner:--\"Have you any money?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"we have arranged everything with M.\nColbert.\"\n\n\"Ah! very well!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and M. Colbert said he would wait upon your majesty, as\nsoon as your majesty should manifest an intention of carrying out the\n_fetes_, of which he has furnished the programme.\"\n\n\"Let him come in, then,\" said the king; and as if Colbert had been\nlistening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself _au courant_\nwith the conversation, he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his\nname to the two courtiers.\n\n\"Ah! M. Colbert,\" said the king. \"Gentlemen, to your posts,\" whereupon\nSaint-Aignan and Villeroy took their leave. The king seated himself in\nan easy-chair near the window, saying: \"The ballet will take place this\nevening, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"In that case, sire, I will pay all accounts to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"I promised the tradespeople to pay their bills the day following that\non which the ballet should take place.\"\n\n\"Very well, M. Colbert, pay them, since you have promised to do so.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that.\"\n\n\"What! have not the four millions, which M. Fouquet promised, been sent?\nI forgot to ask you about it.\"\n\n\"Sire, they were sent at the hour promised.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the\ncooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days.\"\n\n\"Entirely?\"\n\n\"To the last penny. Every time your majesty directed the banks of the\ngrand canal to be illuminated, as much oil was consumed as there was\nwater in the basins.\"\n\n\"Well, well, M. Colbert; the fact is, then, you have no more money?\"\n\n\"I have no more, sire, but M. Fouquet has,\" Colbert replied, his face\ndarkening with a sinister expression of pleasure.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Louis.\n\n\"We have already made M. Fouquet advance six millions. He has given\nthem with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are\nrequired, which is the case at the present moment. It is necessary,\ntherefore, that he should comply.\"\n\nThe king frowned. \"M. Colbert,\" said he, accentuating the financier's\nname, \"that is not the way I understood the matter; I do not wish to\nmake use, against any of my servants, of a means of pressure which\nmay oppress him and fetter his services. In eight days M. Fouquet has\nfurnished six millions; that is a good round sum.\"\n\nColbert turned pale. \"And yet,\" he said, \"your majesty did not use this\nlanguage some time ago, when the news about Belle-Isle arrived, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"You are right, M. Colbert.\"\n\n\"Nothing, however, has changed since then; on the contrary, indeed.\"\n\n\"In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed.\"\n\n\"Does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt?\"\n\n\"My affairs concern myself alone, monsieur; and I have already told you\nI transact them without interference.\"\n\n\"Then, I perceive,\" said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, \"that I\nhave had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty.\"\n\n\"Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me.\"\n\n\"Yet, sire,\" said the minister, with a certain affected bluntness, so\nsuccessful when it was a question of flattering Louis's self-esteem,\n\"what use is there in being agreeable to your majesty, if one can no\nlonger be of any use?\"\n\n\"I reserve your services for a better occasion; and believe me, they\nwill only be the better appreciated.\"\n\n\"Your majesty's plan, then, in this affair, is--\"\n\n\"You want money, M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"Seven hundred thousand francs, sire.\"\n\n\"You will take them from my private treasure.\" Colbert bowed. \"And,\"\nadded Louis, \"as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding\nyour economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I\nintend to incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions.\"\n\nThe king took a pen and signed an order immediately, then handed it\nto Colbert. \"Be satisfied, M. Colbert, the plan I have adopted is one\nworthy of a king,\" said Louis XIV., who pronounced these words with all\nthe majesty he knew how to assume in such circumstances; and dismissed\nColbert for the purpose of giving an audience to his tailors.\n\nThe order issued by the king was known throughout the whole of\nFontainebleau; it was already known, too, that the king was trying on\nhis costume, and that the ballet would be danced in the evening. The\nnews circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it\nkindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition. At the\nsame moment, as if by enchantment, every one who knew how to hold a\nneedle, every one who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers,\nwas summoned to the assistance of those who had received invitations.\nThe king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an\nopen carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers. The queens\nhad taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform, erected\nupon the borders of the lake, in a theater of wonderful elegance of\nconstruction. In the space of five hours the carpenters had put together\nall the different parts connected with the building; the upholsterers\nhad laid down the carpets, erected the seats; and, as if at the wave\nof an enchanter's wand, a thousand arms, aiding, instead of interfering\nwith each other, had constructed the building, amidst the sound of\nmusic; whilst, at the same time, other workmen illuminated the theater\nand the shores of the lake with an incalculable number of lamps. As the\nheavens, set with stars, were perfectly unclouded, as not even a breath\nof air could be heard in the woods, and as if Nature itself had yielded\ncomplacently to the king's fancies, the back of the theater had been\nleft open; so that, behind the foreground of the scenes, could be seen\nas a background the beautiful sky, glittering with stars; the sheet of\nwater, illuminated by the lights which were reflected in it; and the\nbluish outline of the grand masses of woods, with their rounded tops.\nWhen the king made his appearance, the theater was full, and presented\nto the view one vast group, dazzling with gold and precious stones;\nin which, however, at the first glance, no single face could be\ndistinguished. By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much\nbrilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening\nsky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then\nopens them again.\n\nThe theater represented a grove of trees; a few fauns lifting up their\ncloven feet were jumping about; a dryad made her appearance on the\nscene, and was immediately pursued by them; others gathered round her\nfor her defense, and they quarrelled as they danced. Suddenly, for the\npurpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole\ncourt, made his appearance. The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology,\ntogether with their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious\nsovereign. The Seasons, allies of Spring, followed him closely, to form\na quadrille, which, after many words of more or less flattering import,\nwas the commencement of the dance. The music, hautboys, flutes, and\nviols, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights. The king had\nalready made his appearance, amid thunders of applause. He was dressed\nin a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well-formed figure\nto advantage. His legs, the best-shaped at court, were displayed to\ngreat advantage in flesh-colored silken hose, of silk so fine and so\ntransparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself. The most beautiful\npale-lilac satin shoes, with bows of flowers and leaves, imprisoned his\nsmall feet. The bust of the figure was in harmonious keeping with the\nbase; Louis's waving hair floated on his shoulders, the freshness of his\ncomplexion was enhanced by the brilliancy of his beautiful blue eyes,\nwhich softly kindled all hearts; a mouth with tempting lips, which\ndeigned to open in smiles. Such was the prince of that period: justly\nthat evening styled \"The King of all the Loves.\" There was something in\nhis carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and\nhe did not dance so much as seem to soar along. His entrance produced,\ntherefore, the most brilliant effect. Suddenly the Comte de Saint-Aignan\nwas observed endeavoring to approach either the king or Madame.\n\nThe princess--who was robed in a long dress, diaphanous and light as the\nfinest network tissue from the hands of skillful Mechlin workers, one\nknee occasionally revealed beneath the folds of the tunic, and her\nlittle feet encased in silken slippers decked with pearls--advanced\nradiant with beauty, accompanied by her _cortege_ of Bacchantes, and\nhad already reached the spot assigned to her in the dance. The applause\ncontinued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.\n\n\"What is the matter, Saint-Aignan?\" said Spring.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" replied the courtier, as pale as death; \"but your\nmajesty has not thought of Fruits.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is suppressed.\"\n\n\"Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it,\nthe musicians have retained it.\"\n\n\"How excessively annoying,\" said the king. \"This figure cannot be\nperformed, since M. de Guiche is absent. It must be suppressed.\"\n\n\"Ah, sire, a quarter of an hour's music without any dancing will produce\nan effect so chilling as to ruin the success of the ballet.\"\n\n\"But, come, since--\"\n\n\"Oh, sire, that is not the greatest misfortune; for, after all, the\norchestra could still just as well cut it out, if it were necessary;\nbut--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Why, M. de Guiche is here.\"\n\n\"Here?\" replied the king, frowning, \"here? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; and ready dressed for the ballet.\"\n\nThe king felt himself color deeply, and said, \"You are probably\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"So little is that the case, sire, that if your majesty will look to the\nright, you will see that the comte is in waiting.\"\n\nLouis turned hastily towards the side, and in fact, on his right,\nbrilliant in his character of Autumn, De Guiche awaited until the king\nshould look at him, in order that he might address him. To give an idea\nof the stupefaction of the king, and that of Monsieur, who was moving\nabout restlessly in his box,--to describe also the agitated movement\nof the heads in the theater, and the strange emotion of Madame, at the\nsight of her partner,--is a task we must leave to abler hands. The king\nstood almost gaping with astonishment as he looked at the comte, who,\nbowing lowly, approached Louis with the profoundest respect.\n\n\"Sire,\" he said, \"your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to\nperform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already\nshown on the field of battle. Your majesty, in omitting the dance of the\nFruits, would be losing the most beautiful scene in the ballet. I did\nnot wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majesty's\nelegance, skill, and graceful invention; and I have left my tenants in\norder to place my services at your majesty's commands.\"\n\nEvery word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis\nXIV.'s ears. Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had\nastonished him, and he simply replied: \"I did not tell you to return,\ncomte.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, sire; but your majesty did not tell me to remain.\"\n\nThe king perceived that time was passing away, that if this strange\nscene were prolonged it would complicate everything, and that a single\ncloud upon the picture would eventually spoil the whole. Besides, the\nking's heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived\nfresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame. Her look had said\nto him: \"Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the\nman who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular.\"\nSo that Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him. The king smiled\nupon De Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language,\nbut he remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed\nthe pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness\nof heart. The king seemed only pleased with every one present. Monsieur\nwas the only one who did not understand anything about the matter. The\nballet began; the effect was more than beautiful. When the music, by\nits bursts of melody, carried away these illustrious dancers, when the\nsimple, untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on\naccount of the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached\nits culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous\napplause.\n\nDe Guiche shone like a sun, but like a courtly sun, that is resigned to\nfill a subordinate part. Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed\nno acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the\nmarked preference of the princess. She, however, did not bestow a single\nglance upon him. By degrees all his happiness, all his brilliancy,\nsubsided into regret and uneasiness; so that his limbs lost their power,\nhis arms hung heavily by his sides, and his head drooped as though he\nwas stupefied. The king, who had from this moment become in reality\nthe principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished\nrival. De Guiche soon ceased to sustain even the character of the\ncourtier; without applause, he danced indifferently, and very soon\ncould not dance at all, by which accident the triumph of the king and of\nMadame was assured.\n\n\n\nChapter XL: The Nymphs of the Park of Fontainebleau.\n\nThe king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it\ncould possibly be. He then turned towards Madame, for the purpose of\nadmiring her also a little in her turn. Young persons love with more\nvivacity, perhaps with greater ardor and deeper passion, than others\nmore advanced in years; but all the other feelings are at the same time\ndeveloped in proportion to their youth and vigor: so that vanity being\nwith them almost always the equivalent of love, the latter feeling,\naccording to the laws of equipoise, never attains that degree of\nperfection which it acquires in men and women from thirty to five and\nthirty years of age. Louis thought of Madame, but only after he had\nstudiously thought of himself; and Madame carefully thought of herself,\nwithout bestowing a single thought upon the king. The victim, however,\nof all these royal affections and affectations, was poor De Guiche.\nEvery one could observe his agitation and prostration--a prostration\nwhich was, indeed, the more remarkable since people were not accustomed\nto see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side, his head\nbewildered, and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed. It\nrarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account, whenever\na question of elegance or taste was under discussion; and De Guiche's\ndefeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present to his\ncourtier-like tact and ability. But there were others--keen-sighted\nobservers are always to be met with at court--who remarked his paleness\nand his altered looks; which he could neither feign nor conceal,\nand their conclusion was that De Guiche was not acting the part of a\nflatterer. All these sufferings, successes, and remarks were blended,\nconfounded, and lost in the uproar of applause. When, however, the\nqueens expressed their satisfaction and the spectators their enthusiasm,\nwhen the king had retired to his dressing-room to change his costume,\nand whilst Monsieur, dressed as a woman, as he delighted to be, was\nin his turn dancing about, De Guiche, who had now recovered himself,\napproached Madame, who, seated at the back of the theater, was waiting\nfor the second part, and had quitted the others for the purpose of\ncreating a sort of solitude for herself in the midst of the crowd, to\nmeditate, as it were, beforehand, upon chorographic effects; and it will\nbe perfectly understood that, absorbed in deep meditation, she did not\nsee, or rather pretended not to notice, anything that was passing around\nher. De Guiche, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed\nof painted cloth, approached her. Two of her maids of honor, dressed\nas hamadryads, seeing De Guiche advance, drew back out of respect.,\nwhereupon De Guiche proceeded towards the middle of the circle and\nsaluted her royal highness; but, whether she did or did not observe\nhis salutations, the princess did not even turn her head. A cold\nshiver passed through poor De Guiche; he was unprepared for such utter\nindifference, for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had\ntaken place, and consequently could guess nothing. Remarking, therefore,\nthat his obeisance obtained him no acknowledgement, he advanced one step\nfurther, and in a voice which he tried, though vainly, to render calm,\nsaid: \"I have the honor to present my most humble respects to your royal\nhighness.\"\n\nUpon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the\ncomte, observing. \"Ah! M. de Guiche, is that you? good day!\"\n\nThe comte's patience almost forsook him, as he continued,--\"Your royal\nhighness danced just now most charmingly.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" she replied with indifference.\n\n\"Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect\nharmony with your own.\"\n\nMadame again turned round, and, looking De Guiche full in the face with\na bright and steady gaze, said,--\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Oh! there can be no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself?\"\n\n\"You represented a divinity, beautiful, disdainful, inconstant.\"\n\n\"You mean Pomona, comte?\"\n\n\"I allude to the goddess.\"\n\nMadame remained silent for a moment, with her lips compressed, and then\nobserved,--\"But, comte, you, too, are an excellent dancer.\"\n\n\"Nay, Madame, I am only one of those who are never noticed, or who are\nsoon forgotten if they ever happen to be noticed.\"\n\nWith this remark, accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect\nthe remotest fibers of one's being, his heart burdened with sorrow\nand throbbing fast, his head on fire, and his gaze wandering, he bowed\nbreathlessly, and withdrew behind the thicket. The only reply Madame\ncondescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders, and, as her\nladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation\nlasted, she recalled them by a look. The ladies were Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente and Mademoiselle de Montalais.\n\n\"Did you hear what the Comte de Guiche said?\" the princess inquired.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It really is very singular,\" she continued, in a compassionate tone,\n\"how exile has affected poor M. de Guiche's wit.\" And then, in a louder\nvoice, fearful lest her unhappy victim might lose a syllable, she\nsaid,--\"In the first place he danced badly, and afterwards his remarks\nwere very silly.\"\n\nShe then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to\ndance. De Guiche had overheard everything. The arrow pierced his heart\nand wounded him mortally. Then, at the risk of interrupting the progress\nof the _fete_ by his annoyance, he fled from the scene, tearing his\nbeautiful costume of Autumn in pieces, and scattering, as he went along,\nthe branches of vines, mulberry and almond trees, with all the other\nartificial attributes of his assumed divinity. A quarter of an hour\nafterwards he returned to the theater; but it will be readily believed\nthat it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement\nthat enabled him to go back; or perhaps, for love is thus strangely\nconstituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated\nfrom the presence of one who had broken his heart. Madame was finishing\nher figure. She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and\nrevengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her\nnymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers. During this time, at the\nother end of the theater, near the lake, a young woman was seated, with\nher eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater, from which were\nissuing streams of light--the window in question being that of the royal\nbox. As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into\nthe fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and\nsaluted her. When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman\nsurprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing\nfrom herself. De Guiche stopped as he recognized her, and said\nhurriedly,--\"Good evening, Mademoiselle de la Valliere; I am indeed\nfortunate in meeting you.\"\n\n\"I, also, M. de Guiche, am glad of this accidental meeting,\" said the\nyoung girl, as she was about to withdraw.\n\n\"Pray do not leave me,\" said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards\nher, \"for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just\npronounced. Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely. You wish\nto escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society. Well, I\ncan understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and\none never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex\nof these exciting amusements. Oh! Heaven!\" he exclaimed, suddenly.\n\n\"What is the matter, monsieur le comte?\" inquired La Valliere, with some\nanxiety. \"You seem agitated.\"\n\n\"I! oh, no!\"\n\n\"Will you allow me, M. de Guiche, to return you the thanks I had\nproposed to offer you on the very first opportunity? It is to your\nrecommendation, I am aware, that I owe my admission among the number of\nMadame's maids of honor.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Ah! I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love any\none?\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed La Valliere.\n\n\"Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive\nme; Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely\nturned my brain.\"\n\n\"And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? Received me with kindness--perhaps so--yes--\"\n\n\"There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you\nreturned without his permission.\"\n\n\"Quite true, and I believe you are right. But have you not seen M. de\nBragelonne here?\"\n\nLa Valliere started at the name. \"Why do you ask?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Have I offended you again?\" said De Guiche. \"In that case I am indeed\nunhappy, and greatly to be pitied.\"\n\n\"Yes, very unhappy, and very much to be pitied, Monsieur de Guiche, for\nyou seem to be suffering terribly.\"\n\n\"Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend,\nsuch as yourself?\"\n\n\"You have friends, Monsieur de Guiche, and the Vicomte de Bragelonne, of\nwhom you spoke just now, is, I believe, one of the most devoted.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you are right, he is one of my best friends. Farewell,\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, farewell.\" And he fled, like one possessed,\nalong the banks of the lake. His dark shadow glided, lengthening as it\ndisappeared, among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the\nwater. La Valliere looked after him, saying,--\"Yes, yes, he, too, is\nsuffering, and I begin to understand why.\"\n\nShe had hardly finished when her companions, Mademoiselle de Montalais\nand Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, ran forward. They were released\nfrom their attendance, and had changed their costumes of nymphs;\ndelighted with the beautiful night, and the success of the evening, they\nreturned to look after their companion.\n\n\"What, already here!\" they said to her. \"We thought we should be first\nat the rendezvous.\"\n\n\"I have been here this quarter of an hour,\" replied La Valliere.\n\n\"Did not the dancing amuse you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But surely the enchanting spectacle?\"\n\n\"No more than the dancing. As far as beauty is concerned, I much prefer\nthat which these dark woods present, in whose depths can be seen, now\nin one direction and again in another, a light passing by, as though it\nwere an eye, in color like a midnight rainbow, sometimes open, at others\nclosed.\"\n\n\"La Valliere is quite a poetess,\" said Tonnay-Charente.\n\n\"In other words,\" said Montalais, \"she is insupportable. Whenever there\nis a question of laughing a little or of amusing ourselves, La Valliere\nbegins to cry; whenever we girls have reason to cry, because, perhaps,\nwe have mislaid our dresses, or because our vanity as been wounded, or\nour costume fails to produce an effect, La Valliere laughs.\"\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, that is not my character,\" said Mademoiselle\nde Tonnay-Charente. \"I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever\nloves me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever\npleases--\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Montalais, \"you do not finish.\"\n\n\"It is too difficult,\" replied Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, laughing\nloudly. \"Do you, who are so clever, finish for me.\"\n\n\"And you, Louise?\" said Montalais, \"does any one please you?\"\n\n\"That is a matter that concerns no one but myself,\" replied the young\ngirl, rising from the mossy bank on which she had been reclining during\nthe whole time the ballet lasted. \"Now, mesdemoiselles, we have agreed\nto amuse ourselves to-night without any one to overlook us, and without\nany escort. We are three in number, we like one another, and the night\nis lovely. Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering\nthe topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks. Oh, beautiful walk!\nsweet liberty! exquisite soft turf of the woods, the happiness which\nyour friendship confers upon me! let us walk arm in arm towards those\nlarge trees. Out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and\nfully occupied, or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal\npromenade; horses are being saddled, or harnessed to the carriages--the\nqueen's mules or Madame's four white ponies. As for ourselves, we shall\nsoon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow\nours. Do you not remember, Montalais, the woods of Cheverny and of\nChambord, the innumerable rustling poplars of Blois, where we exchanged\nour mutual hopes?\"\n\n\"And confidences too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, \"I also think a good deal;\nbut I take care--\"\n\n\"To say nothing,\" said Montalais, \"so that when Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente thinks, Athenais is the only one who knows it.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, \"I hear steps approaching\nfrom this side.\"\n\n\"Quick, quick, then, among the high reed-grass,\" said Montalais; \"stoop,\nAthenais, you are so tall.\"\n\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente stooped as she was told, and, almost at\nthe same moment, they saw two gentlemen approaching, their heads bent\ndown, walking arm in arm, on the fine gravel walk running parallel with\nthe bank. The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small--indeed\ninvisible.\n\n\"It is Monsieur de Guiche,\" whispered Montalais in Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente's ear.\n\n\"It is Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" whispered the latter to La Valliere.\n\nThe two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones.\n\"She was here just now,\" said the count. \"If I had only seen her, I\nshould have declared it to be a vision, but I spoke to her.\"\n\n\"You are positive, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; but perhaps I frightened her.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Oh! I was still half crazy at you know what; so that she could hardly\nhave understood what I was saying, and must have grown alarmed.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Bragelonne, \"do not make yourself uneasy: she is all\nkindness, and will excuse you; she is clear-sighted, and will\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she\nmay talk.\"\n\n\"You do not know Louise, count,\" said Raoul. \"Louise possesses every\nvirtue, and has not a single fault.\" And the two young men passed on,\nand, as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.\n\n\"How is it, La Valliere,\" said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, \"that\nthe Vicomte de Bragelonne spoke of you as Louise?\"\n\n\"We were brought up together,\" replied Louise, blushing; \"M. de\nBragelonne has honored me by asking my hand in marriage, but--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It seems the king will not consent to it.\"\n\n\"Eh! Why the king? and what has the king to do with it?\" exclaimed Aure,\nsharply. \"Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters\nof that kind? Politics are politics, as M. de Mazarin used to say; but\nlove is love. If, therefore, you love M. de Bragelonne, marry him. _I_\ngive _my_ consent.\"\n\nAthenais began to laugh.\n\n\"Oh! I am speaking seriously,\" replied Montalais, \"and my opinion in\nthis case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said La Valliere, \"these gentlemen have passed; let us take\nadvantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge\nin the woods.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Athenais, \"because I see the torches setting\nout from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were\npreceding some person of distinction.\"\n\n\"Let us run, then,\" said all three. And, gracefully lifting up the long\nskirts of their silk dresses, they lightly ran across the open space\nbetween the lake and the thickest covert of the park. Montalais agile as\na deer, Athenais eager as a young wolf, bounded through the dry grass,\nand, now and then, some bold Acteon might, by the aid of the faint\nlight, have perceived their straight and well-formed limbs somewhat\ndisplayed beneath the heavy folds of their satin petticoats. La\nValliere, more refined and more bashful, allowed her dress to flow\naround her; retarded also by the lameness of her foot, it was not long\nbefore she called out to her companions to halt, and, left behind, she\nobliged them both to wait for her. At this moment, a man, concealed in\na dry ditch planted with young willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its\nshelving side, and ran off in the direction of the chateau. The three\nyoung girls, on their side, reached the outskirts of the park, every\npath of which they well knew. The ditches were bordered by high hedges\nfull of flowers, which on that side protected the foot-passengers from\nbeing intruded upon by the horses and carriages. In fact, the sound of\nMadame's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon\nthe hard dry ground of the roads, followed by the mounted cavaliers.\nDistant music reached them in response, and when the soft notes died\naway, the nightingale, with throat of pride, poured forth his melodious\nchants, and his most complicated, learned, and sweetest compositions\nto those who had met beneath the thick covert of the woods. Near the\nsongster, in the dark background of the large trees, could be seen the\nglistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony. In this way\nthe _fete_ of the whole court was a _fete_ also for the mysterious\ninhabitants of the forest; for certainly the deer in the brake, the\npheasant on the branch, the fox in its hole, were all listening. One\ncould realize the life led by this nocturnal and invisible population\nfrom the restless movements that suddenly took place among the leaves.\nOur sylvan nymphs uttered a slight cry, but, reassured immediately\nafterwards, they laughed, and resumed their walk. In this manner they\nreached the royal oak, the venerable relic of a tree which in its\nprime has listened to the sighs of Henry II. for the beautiful Diana of\nPoitiers, and later still to those of Henry IV. for the lovely Gabrielle\nd'Estrees. Beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and\nturf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the\nwearied limbs of man or monarch. The trunk, somewhat rough to recline\nagainst, was sufficiently large to accommodate the three young girls,\nwhose voices were lost among the branches, which stretched upwards to\nthe sky.\n\n\n\nChapter XLI. What Was Said under the Royal Oak.\n\nThe softness of the air, the stillness of the foliage, tacitly imposed\nupon these young girls an engagement to change immediately their giddy\nconversation for one of a more serious character. She, indeed, whose\ndisposition was the most lively,--Montalais, for instance,--was the\nfirst to yield to the influence; and she began by heaving a deep sigh,\nand saying:--\"What happiness to be here alone, and at liberty, with\nevery right to be frank, especially towards one another.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; \"for the court, however\nbrilliant it may be, has always some falsehood concealed beneath the\nfolds of its velvet robes, or the glitter of its diamonds.\"\n\n\"I,\" replied La Valliere, \"I never tell a falsehood; when I cannot speak\nthe truth, I remain silent.\"\n\n\"You will not long remain in favor,\" said Montalais; \"it is not here\nas it was at Blois, where we told the dowager Madame all our little\nannoyances, and all our longings. There were certain days when Madame\nremembered that she herself had been young, and, on those days, whoever\ntalked with her found in her a sincere friend. She related to us her\nflirtations with Monsieur, and we told her of the flirtations she\nhad had with others, or, at least, the rumors of them that had spread\nabroad. Poor woman, so simple-minded! she laughed at them, as we did.\nWhere is she now?\"\n\n\"Ah, Montalais,--laughter-loving Montalais!\" cried La Valliere; \"you\nsee you are sighing again; the woods inspire you, and you are almost\nreasonable this evening.\"\n\n\"You ought not, either of you,\" said Athenais, \"to regret the court at\nBlois so much, unless you do not feel happy with us. A court is a place\nwhere men and women resort to talk of matters which mothers, guardians,\nand especially confessors, severely denounce.\"\n\n\"Oh, Athenais!\" said Louise, blushing.\n\n\"Athenais is frank to-night,\" said Montalais; \"let us avail ourselves of\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us take advantage of it, for this evening I could divulge the\nsoftest secrets of my heart.\"\n\n\"Ah, if M. Montespan were here!\" said Montalais.\n\n\"Do you think that I care for M. de Montespan?\" murmured the beautiful\nyoung girl.\n\n\"He is handsome, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes. And that is no small advantage in my eyes.\"\n\n\"There now, you see--\"\n\n\"I will go further, and say, that of all the men whom one sees here, he\nis the handsomest, and the most--\"\n\n\"What was that?\" said La Valliere, starting suddenly from the mossy\nbank.\n\n\"A deer hurrying by, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I am only afraid of men,\" said Athenais.\n\n\"When they do not resemble M. de Montespan.\"\n\n\"A truce to raillery. M. de Montespan is attentive to me, but that does\nnot commit me in any way. Is not M. de Guiche here, he who is so devoted\nto Madame?\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said La Valliere.\n\n\"Why to be pitied? Madame is sufficiently beautiful, and of high enough\nrank, I suppose.\"\n\nLa Valliere shook her head sorrowfully, saying, \"When one loves, it is\nneither beauty nor rank;--when one loves it should be the heart, or the\neyes only, of him, or of her whom one loves.\"\n\nMontalais began to laugh loudly. \"Heart, eyes,\" she said; \"oh,\nsugar-plums!\"\n\n\"I speak for myself;\" replied La Valliere.\n\n\"Noble sentiments,\" said Athenais, with an air of protection, but with\nindifference.\n\n\"Are they not your own?\" asked Louise.\n\n\"Perfectly so; but to continue: how can one pity a man who bestows his\nattentions upon such a woman as Madame? If any disproportion exists, it\nis on the count's side.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no,\" returned La Valliere; \"it is on Madame's side.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"I will. Madame has not even a wish to know what love is. She diverts\nherself with the feeling, as children do with fireworks, form which a\nspark might set a palace on fire. It makes a display, and that is all\nshe cares about. Besides, pleasure forms the tissue of which she wishes\nher life to be woven. M. de Guiche loves this illustrious personage, but\nshe will never love him.\"\n\nAthenais laughed disdainfully. \"Do people really ever love?\" she said.\n\"Where are the noble sentiments you just now uttered? Does not a woman's\nvirtue consist in the uncompromising refusal of every intrigue that\nmight compromise her? A properly regulated woman, endowed with a natural\nheart, ought to look at men, make herself loved--adored, even, by them,\nand say at the very utmost but once in her life, 'I begin to think that\nI ought not to have been what I am,--I should have detested this one\nless than others.'\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"that is what M. de Montespan has to\nexpect.\"\n\n\"Certainly; he, as well as every one else. What! have I not said that I\nadmit he possesses a certain superiority, and would not that be enough?\nMy dear child, a woman is a queen during the entire period nature\npermits her to enjoy sovereign power--from fifteen to thirty-five years\nof age. After that, we are free to have a heart, when we only have that\nleft--\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" murmured La Valliere.\n\n\"Excellent,\" cried Montalais; \"a very masterly woman; Athenais, you will\nmake your way in the world.\"\n\n\"Do you not approve of what I say?\"\n\n\"Completely,\" replied her laughing companion.\n\n\"You are not serious, Montalais?\" said Louise.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I approve everything Athenais has just said; only--\"\n\n\"Only _what?_\"\n\n\"Well, I cannot carry it out. I have the firmest principles; I form\nresolutions beside which the laws of the Stadtholder and of the King\nof Spain are child's play; but when the moment arrives to put them into\nexecution, nothing comes of them.\"\n\n\"Your courage fails?\" said Athenais, scornfully.\n\n\"Miserably so.\"\n\n\"Great weakness of nature,\" returned Athenais. \"But at least you make a\nchoice.\"\n\n\"Why, no. It pleases fate to disappoint me in everything; I dream of\nemperors, and I find only--\"\n\n\"Aure, Aure!\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"for pity's sake, do not, for the\npleasure of saying something witty, sacrifice those who love you with\nsuch devoted affection.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not trouble myself much about that; those who love me are\nsufficiently happy that I do not dismiss them altogether. So much the\nworse for myself if I have a weakness for any one, but so much the worse\nfor others if I revenge myself upon them for it.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Athenais, \"and, perhaps, you too will reach the\ngoal. In other words, young ladies, that is termed being a coquette.\nMen, who are very silly in most things, are particularly so in\nconfounding, under the term of coquetry, a woman's pride, and love\nof changing her sentiments as she does her dress. I, for instance, am\nproud; that is to say, impregnable. I treat my admirers harshly, but\nwithout any pretention to retain them. Men call me a coquette, because\nthey are vain enough to think I care for them. Other women--Montalais,\nfor instance--have allowed themselves to be influenced by flattery; they\nwould be lost were it not for that most fortunate principle of instinct\nwhich urges them to change suddenly, and punish the man whose devotion\nthey so recently accepted.\"\n\n\"A very learned dissertation,\" said Montalais, in the tone of thorough\nenjoyment.\n\n\"It is odious!\" murmured Louise.\n\n\"Thanks to that sort of coquetry, for, indeed, that is genuine\ncoquetry,\" continued Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; \"the lover who, a\nlittle while since, was puffed up with pride, in a minute afterwards is\nsuffering at every pore of his vanity and self-esteem. He was, perhaps,\nalready beginning to assume the airs of a conqueror, but now he retreats\ndefeated; he was about to assume an air of protection towards us, but\nhe is obliged to prostrate himself once more. The result of all this is,\nthat, instead of having a husband who is jealous and troublesome,\nfree from restraint in his conduct towards us, we have a lover always\ntrembling in our presence, always fascinated by our attractions, always\nsubmissive; and for this simple reason, that he finds the same woman\nnever twice of the same mind. Be convinced, therefore, of the advantages\nof coquetry. Possessing that, one reigns a queen among women in cases\nwhere Providence has withheld that precious faculty of holding one's\nheart and mind in check.\"\n\n\"How clever you are,\" said Montalais, \"and how well you understand the\nduty women owe themselves!\"\n\n\"I am only settling a case of individual happiness,\" said Athenais\nmodestly; \"and defending myself, like all weak, loving dispositions,\nagainst the oppressions of the stronger.\"\n\n\"La Valliere does not say a word.\"\n\n\"Does she not approve of what we are saying?\"\n\n\"Nay; only I do not understand it,\" said Louise. \"You talk like people\nnot called upon to live in this world of ours.\"\n\n\"And very pretty your world is,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"A world,\" returned Athenais, \"in which men worship a woman until she\nhas fallen,--and insult her when she has fallen.\"\n\n\"Who spoke to you of falling?\" said Louise.\n\n\"Yours is a new theory, then; will you tell us how you intend to resist\nyielding to temptation, if you allow yourself to be hurried away by\nfeelings of affection?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the young girl, raising towards the dark heavens her\nbeautiful large eyes filled with tears, \"if you did but know what a\nheart is, I would explain, and convince you; a loving heart is stronger\nthan all your coquetry, more powerful than all your pride. A woman is\nnever truly loved, I believe; a man never loves with idolatry, unless\nhe feels sure he is loved in return. Let old men, whom we read of in\ncomedies, fancy themselves adored by coquettes. A young man is conscious\nof, and knows them; if he has a fancy, or a strong desire, and an\nabsorbing passion, for a coquette, he cannot mistake her; a coquette may\ndrive him out of his senses, but will never make him fall in love. Love,\nsuch as I conceive it to be, is an incessant, complete, and perfect\nsacrifice; but it is not the sacrifice of one only of the two persons\nthus united. It is the perfect abnegation of two who are desirous of\nblending their beings into one. If ever I love, I shall implore my lover\nto leave me free and pure; I will tell him, and he will understand, that\nmy heart was torn by my refusal, and he, in his love for me, aware of\nthe magnitude of my sacrifice,--he, in his turn, I say, will store his\ndevotion for me,--will respect me, and will not seek my ruin, to insult\nme when I shall have fallen, as you said just now, whilst uttering your\nblasphemies against love, such as I understand it. That is my idea of\nlove. And now you will tell me, perhaps, that my love will despise me; I\ndefy him to do so, unless he be the vilest of men, and my heart assures\nme that it is not such a man I would choose. A look from me will repay\nhim for the sacrifices he makes, or will inspire him with the virtues\nwhich he would never think he possessed.\"\n\n\"But, Louise,\" exclaimed Montalais, \"you tell us this, and do not carry\nit into practice.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You are adored by Raoul de Bragelonne, who worships you on both knees.\nThe poor fellow is made the victim of your virtue, just as he would be--\nnay, more than he would be, even--of my coquetry, or Athenais's pride.\"\n\n\"All this is simply a different shade of coquetry,\" said Athenais; \"and\nLouise, I perceive, is a coquette without knowing it.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said La Valliere.\n\n\"Yes, you may call it instinct, if you please, keenest sensibility,\nexquisite refinement of feeling, perpetual play of restrained outbreaks\nof affection, which end in smoke. It is very artful too, and very\neffective. I should even, now that I reflect upon it, have preferred\nthis system of tactics to my own pride, for waging war on members of\nthe other sex, because it offers the advantage sometimes of thoroughly\nconvincing them; but, at the present moment, without utterly condemning\nmyself, I declare it to be superior to the non-complex coquetry of\nMontalais.\" And the two young girls began to laugh.\n\nLa Valliere alone preserved silence, and quietly shook her head. Then,\na moment after, she added, \"If you were to tell me, in the presence of\na man, but a fourth part of what you have just said, or even if I were\nassured that you think it, I should die of shame and grief where I am\nnow.\"\n\n\"Very well; die, poor tender little darling,\" replied Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente; \"for if there are no men here, there are at least two\nwomen, your own friends, who declare you to be attained and convicted of\nbeing a coquette from instinct; in other words, the most dangerous kind\nof coquette the world possesses.\"\n\n\"Oh! mesdemoiselles,\" replied La Valliere, blushing, and almost ready to\nweep. Her two companions again burst out laughing.\n\n\"Very well! I will ask Bragelonne to tell me.\"\n\n\"Bragelonne?\" said Athenais.\n\n\"Yes! Bragelonne, who is as courageous as Caesar, and as clever and\nwitty as M. Fouquet. Poor fellow! for twelve years he has known you,\nloved you, and yet--one can hardly believe it--he has never even kissed\nthe tips of your fingers.\"\n\n\"Tell us the reason of this cruelty, you who are all heart,\" said\nAthenais to La Valliere.\n\n\"Let me explain it by a single word--virtue. You will perhaps deny the\nexistence of virtue?\"\n\n\"Come, Louise, tell us the truth,\" said Aure, taking her by the hand.\n\n\"What do you wish me to tell you?\" cried La Valliere.\n\n\"Whatever you like; but it will be useless for you to say anything,\nfor I persist in my opinion of you. A coquette from instinct; in other\nwords, as I have already said, and I say it again, the most dangerous of\nall coquettes.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no; for pity's sake do not believe that!\"\n\n\"What! twelve years of extreme severity.\"\n\n\"How can that be, since twelve years ago I was only five years old?\nThe frivolity of the child cannot surely be placed to the young girl's\naccount.\"\n\n\"Well! you are now seventeen; three years instead of twelve. During\nthose three years you have remained constantly and unchangeably cruel.\nAgainst you are arrayed the silent shades of Blois, the meetings when\nyou diligently conned the stars together, the evening wanderings beneath\nthe plantain-trees, his impassioned twenty years speaking to your\nfourteen summers, the fire of his glances addressed to yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but so it is!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"But why impossible?\"\n\n\"Tell us something credible and we will believe you.\"\n\n\"Yet, if you were to suppose one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Suppose that I thought I was in love, and that I am not.\"\n\n\"What! not in love!\"\n\n\"Well, then! if I have acted in a different manner to what others do\nwhen they are in love, it is because I do not love; and because my hour\nhas not yet come.\"\n\n\"Louise, Louise,\" said Montalais, \"take care or I will remind you of the\nremark you made just now. Raoul is not here; do not overwhelm him while\nhe is absent; be charitable, and if, on closer inspection, you think you\ndo not love him, tell him so, poor fellow!\" and she began to laugh.\n\n\"Louise pitied M. de Guiche just now,\" said Athenais; \"would it be\npossible to detect an explanation of her indifference for the one in\nthis compassion for the other?\"\n\n\"Say what you please,\" said La Valliere, sadly; \"upbraid me as you like,\nsince you do not understand me.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" replied Montalais, \"temper, sorrow, tears; we are jesting,\nLouise, and are not, I assure you, quite the monsters you suppose.\nLook at the proud Athenais, as she is called; she does not love M. de\nMontespan, it is true, but she would be in despair if M. de Montespan\ndid not continue to love her. Look at me; I laugh at M. Malicorne,\nbut the poor fellow whom I laugh at knows precisely when he will be\npermitted to press his lips upon my hand. And yet the eldest of us is\nnot twenty yet. What a future before us!\"\n\n\"Silly, silly girls!\" murmured Louise.\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said Montalais; \"and you alone have spoken words\nof wisdom.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I do not dispute it,\" replied Athenais. \"And so it is clear you do not\nlove poor M. de Bragelonne?\"\n\n\"Perhaps she does,\" said Montalais; \"she is not yet quite certain of it.\nBut, in any case, listen, Athenais; if M. de Bragelonne is ever free, I\nwill give you a little friendly advice.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"To look at him well before you decide in favor of M. de Montespan.\"\n\n\"Oh! in that way of considering the subject, M. de Bragelonne is not\nthe only one whom one could look at with pleasure; M. de Guiche, for\ninstance, has his value also.\"\n\n\"He did not distinguish himself this evening,\" said Montalais; \"and I\nknow from very good authority that Madame thought him insupportable.\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Aignan produced a most brilliant effect, and I am sure that\nmore than one person who saw him dance this evening will not soon forget\nhim. Do you not think so, La Valliere?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me? I did not see him, nor do I know him.\"\n\n\"What! you did not see M. de Saint-Aignan? Don't you know him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Come, come, do not affect a virtue more extravagantly excessive than\nour vanity!--you have eyes, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"Then you must have seen all those who danced this evening.\"\n\n\"Yes, nearly all.\"\n\n\"That is a very impertinent 'nearly all' for somebody.\"\n\n\"You must take it for what it is worth.\"\n\n\"Very well; now, among all those gentlemen whom you saw, which do you\nprefer?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Montalais, \"is it M. de Saint-Aignan, or M. de Guiche, or\nM.--\"\n\n\"I prefer no one; I thought them all about the same.\"\n\n\"Do you mean, then, that among that brilliant assembly, the first court\nin the world, no one pleased you?\"\n\n\"I do not say that.\"\n\n\"Tell us, then, who your ideal is?\"\n\n\"It is not an ideal being.\"\n\n\"He exists, then?\"\n\n\"In very truth,\" exclaimed La Valliere, aroused and excited; \"I cannot\nunderstand you at all. What! you who have a heart as I have, eyes as I\nhave, and yet you speak of M. de Guiche, of M. de Saint-Aignan, when the\nking was there.\" These words, uttered in a precipitate manner, and in\nan agitated, fervid tone of voice, made her two companions, between whom\nshe was seated, exclaim in a manner that terrified her, \"_The king!_\"\n\nLa Valliere buried her face in her hands. \"Yes,\" she murmured; \"the\nking! the king! Have you ever seen any one to be compared to the king?\"\n\n\"You were right just now in saying you had excellent eyes, Louise, for\nyou see a great distance; too far, indeed. Alas! the king is not one\nupon whom our poor eyes have a right to hinge themselves.\"\n\n\"That is too true,\" cried La Valliere; \"it is not the privilege of all\neyes to gaze upon the sun; but I will look upon him, even were I to be\nblinded in doing so.\" At this moment, and as though caused by the words\nwhich had just escaped La Valliere's lips, a rustling of leaves, and of\nwhat sounded like some silken material, was heard behind the adjoining\nbushes. The young girls hastily rose, almost terrified out of their\nsenses. They distinctly saw the leaves move, without being able to see\nwhat it was that stirred them.\n\n\"It is a wolf or a wild boar,\" cried Montalais; \"fly! fly!\" The three\ngirls, in the extremity of terror, fled by the first path that presented\nitself, and did not stop until they had reached the verge of the wood.\nThere, breathless, leaning against each other, feeling their hearts\nthrob wildly, they endeavored to collect their senses, but could only\nsucceed in doing so after the lapse of some minutes. Perceiving at last\nthe lights from the windows of the chateau, they decided to walk towards\nthem. La Valliere was exhausted with fatigue, and Aure and Athenais were\nobliged to support her.\n\n\"We have escaped well,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"I am greatly afraid,\" said La Valliere, \"that it was something\nworse than a wolf. For my part, and I speak as I think, I should have\npreferred to have run the risk of being devoured alive by some wild\nanimal than to have been listened to and overheard. Fool, fool that I\nam! How could I have thought, how could I have said what I did?\" And\nsaying this her head bowed like the water tossed plume of a bulrush;\nshe felt her limbs fail, and her strength abandoning her, and, gliding\nalmost inanimate from the arms of her companions, sank down upon the\nturf.\n\n\n\nChapter XLII. The King's Uneasiness.\n\nLet us leave poor La Valliere, who had fainted in the arms of her two\ncompanions, and return to the precincts of the royal oak. The young\ngirls had hardly run twenty paces, when the sound which had so much\nalarmed them was renewed among the branches. A man's figure might\nindistinctly be perceived, and putting the branches of the bushes aside,\nhe appeared upon the verge of the wood, and perceiving that the place\nwas empty, burst out into a peal of laughter. It is almost superfluous\nto add that the form in question was that of a young and handsome\ncavalier, who immediately made a sign to another, who thereupon made his\nappearance.\n\n\"What, sire,\" said the second figure, advancing timidly, \"has your\nmajesty put our young sentimentalists to flight?\"\n\n\"It seems so,\" said the king, \"and you can show yourself without fear.\"\n\n\"Take care, sire, you will be recognized.\"\n\n\"But I tell you they are flown.\"\n\n\"This is a most fortunate meeting, sire; and, if I dared offer an\nopinion to your majesty, we ought to follow them.\"\n\n\"They are far enough away by this time.\"\n\n\"They would quickly allow themselves to be overtaken, especially if they\nknew who were following them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, coxcomb that you are?\"\n\n\"Why, one of them seems to have taken a fancy to me, and another\ncompared you to the sun.\"\n\n\"The greater reason why we should not show ourselves, Saint-Aignan. The\nsun never shows itself in the night-time.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sire, your majesty seems to have very little curiosity.\nIn your place, I should like to know who are the two nymphs, the two\ndryads, the two hamadryads, who have so good an opinion of us.\"\n\n\"I shall know them again very well, I assure you, without running after\nthem.\"\n\n\"By what means?\"\n\n\"By their voices, of course. They belong to the court, and the one who\nspoke of me had a remarkably sweet voice.\"\n\n\"Ah! your majesty permits yourself to be influenced by flattery.\"\n\n\"No one will ever say it is a means _you_ make use of.\"\n\n\"Forgive my stupidity, sire.\"\n\n\"Come; let us go and look where I told you.\"\n\n\"Is the passion, then, which your majesty confided to me, already\nforgotten?\"\n\n\"Oh! no, indeed. How is it possible to forget such beautiful eyes as\nMademoiselle de la Valliere has?\"\n\n\"Yet the other one has a beautiful voice.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"The lady who has fallen in love with the sun.\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Aignan!\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sire.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not sorry you should believe me to be an admirer of sweet\nvoices as well as of beautiful eyes. I know you to be a terrible talker,\nand to-morrow I shall have to pay for the confidence I have shown you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sire?\"\n\n\"That to-morrow every one will know that I have designs upon this little\nLa Valliere; but be careful, Saint-Aignan, I have confided my secret to\nno one but you, and if any one should speak to me about it, I shall know\nwho has betrayed my secret.\"\n\n\"You are angry, sire.\"\n\n\"No; but you understand I do not wish to compromise the poor girl.\"\n\n\"Do not be afraid, sire.\"\n\n\"You promise me, then?\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honor.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" thought the king, laughing to himself; \"now every one\nwill know to-morrow that I have been running about after La Valliere\nto-night.\"\n\nThen, endeavoring to see where he was, he said: \"Why we have lost\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Not quite so bad as that, sire.\"\n\n\"Where does that gate lead to?\"\n\n\"To Rond-Point, sire.\"\n\n\"Where were we going when we heard the sound of women's voices?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and the termination of a conversation in which I had the\nhonor of hearing my own name pronounced by the side of your majesty's.\"\n\n\"You return to that subject too frequently, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Your majesty will forgive me, but I am delighted to know that a woman\nexists whose thoughts are occupied about me, without my knowledge,\nand without my having done anything to deserve it. Your majesty cannot\ncomprehend this satisfaction, for your rank and merit attract attention,\nand compel regard.\"\n\n\"No, no, Saint-Aignan, believe me or not, as you like,\" said the king,\nleaning familiarly upon Saint-Aignan's arm and taking the path he\nthought would lead them to the chateau; \"but this candid confession,\nthis perfectly disinterested preference of one who will, perhaps, never\nattract my attention--in one word, the mystery of this adventure excites\nme, and the truth is, that if I were not so taken with La Valliere--\"\n\n\"Do not let that interfere with your majesty's intentions: you have time\nenough before you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"La Valliere is said to be very strict in her ideas.\"\n\n\"You excite my curiosity and I am anxious to see her again. Come, let us\nwalk on.\"\n\nThe king spoke untruly, for nothing, on the contrary, could make him\nless anxious, but he had a part to play, and so he walked on hurriedly.\nSaint-Aignan followed him at a short distance. Suddenly the king\nstopped; the courtier followed his example.\n\n\"Saint-Aignan,\" he said, \"do you not hear some one moaning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and weeping, too, it seems.\"\n\n\"It is in this direction,\" said the king. \"It sounds like the tears and\nsobs of a woman.\"\n\n\"Run,\" said the king; and, following a by-path, they ran across the\ngrass. As they approached, the cries were more distinctly heard.\n\n\"Help, help,\" exclaimed two voices. The king and his companion redoubled\ntheir speed, and, as they approached nearer, the sighs they had\nheard were changed into loud sobs. The cry of \"Help! help!\" was again\nrepeated; at the sound of which, the king and Saint-Aignan increased the\nrapidity of their pace. Suddenly at the other side of a ditch, under\nthe branches of a willow, they perceived a woman on her knees, holding\nanother in her arms who seemed to have fainted. A few paces from them,\na third, standing in the middle of the path, was calling for assistance.\nPerceiving the two gentlemen, whose rank she could not tell, her cries\nfor assistance were redoubled. The king, who was in advance of his\ncompanion, leaped across the ditch, and reached the group at the very\nmoment when, from the end of the path which led to the chateau, a dozen\npersons were approaching, who had been drawn to the spot by the\nsame cries that had attracted the attention of the king and M. de\nSaint-Aignan.\n\n\"What is the matter, young ladies?\" said Louis.\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed Mademoiselle de Montalais, in her astonishment,\nletting La Valliere's head fall upon the ground.\n\n\"Yes, it is the king; but that is no reason why you should abandon your\ncompanion. Who is she?\"\n\n\"It is Mademoiselle de la Valliere, sire.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere!\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, she has just fainted.\"\n\n\"Poor child!\" said the king. \"Quick, quick, fetch a surgeon.\" But\nhowever great the anxiety with which the king had pronounced these words\nmay have seemed to others, he had not so carefully schooled himself\nbut that they appeared, as well as the gesture which accompanied them,\nsomewhat cold to Saint-Aignan, to whom the king had confided the sudden\nlove with which she had inspired him.\n\n\"Saint-Aignan,\" continued the king, \"watch over Mademoiselle de la\nValliere, I beg. Send for a surgeon. I will hasten forward and inform\nMadame of the accident which has befallen one of her maids of honor.\"\nAnd, in fact, while M. de Saint-Aignan was busily engaged in making\npreparations for carrying Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the chateau,\nthe king hurried forward, happy to have an opportunity of approaching\nMadame, and of speaking to her under a colorable pretext. Fortunately, a\ncarriage was passing; the coachman was told to stop, and the persons who\nwere inside, having been informed of the accident, eagerly gave up their\nseats to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The current of fresh air produced\nby the rapid motion of the carriage soon recalled her to her senses.\nHaving reached the chateau, she was able, though very weak, to\nalight from the carriage, and, with the assistance of Athenais and of\nMontalais, to reach the inner apartments. They made her sit down in one\nof the rooms of the ground floor. After a while, as the accident had not\nproduced much effect upon those who had been walking, the promenade was\nresumed. During this time, the king had found Madame beneath a tree with\noverhanging branches, and had seated himself by her side.\n\n\"Take care, sire,\" said Henrietta to him, in a low tone, \"you do not\nshow yourself as indifferent as you ought to be.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied the king, in the same tone, \"I much fear we have entered\ninto an agreement above our strength to keep.\" He then added aloud, \"You\nhave heard of the accident, I suppose?\"\n\n\"What accident?\"\n\n\"Oh! in seeing you I forgot I hurried here expressly to tell you of it.\nI am, however, painfully affected by it; one of your maids of honor,\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, has just fainted.\"\n\n\"Indeed! poor girl,\" said the princess, quietly, \"what was the cause of\nit?\"\n\nShe then added in an undertone, \"You forget, sire, that you wish others\nto believe in your passion for this girl, and yet you remain here while\nshe is almost dying, perhaps, elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Ah! Madame,\" said the king, sighing, \"how much more perfect you are in\nyour part than I am, and how actively you think of everything.\"\n\nHe then rose, saying loud enough for every one to hear him, \"Permit\nme to leave you, Madame; my uneasiness is very great, and I wish to\nbe quite certain, myself, that proper attention has been given to\nMademoiselle de la Valliere.\" And the king left again to return to La\nValliere, while those who had been present commented upon the king's\nremark:--\"My uneasiness is very great.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLIII. The King's Secret.\n\nOn his way Louis met the Comte de Saint-Aignan. \"Well, Saint-Aignan,\" he\ninquired, with affected interest, \"how is the invalid.\"\n\n\"Really, sire,\" stammered Saint-Aignan, \"to my shame, I confess I do not\nknow.\"\n\n\"What! you do not know?\" said the king, pretending to take in a serious\nmanner this want of attention for the object of his predilection.\n\n\"Will your majesty pardon me; but I have just met one of our three\nloquacious wood-nymphs, and I confess that my attention has been taken\naway from other matters.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, eagerly, \"you have found, then--\"\n\n\"The one who deigned to speak of me in such advantageous terms; and,\nhaving found mine, I was searching for yours, sire, when I had the\nhappiness to meet your majesty.\"\n\n\"Very well; but Mademoiselle de la Valliere before everything else,\"\nsaid the king, faithful to the character he had assumed.\n\n\"Oh! our charming invalid!\" said Saint-Aignan; \"how fortunately her\nfainting fit came on, since your majesty had already occupied yourself\nabout her.\"\n\n\"What is the name of your fair lady, Saint-Aignan? Is it a secret?\"\n\n\"It ought to be a secret, and a very great one, even; but your majesty\nis well aware that no secret can possibly exist for you.\"\n\n\"Well, what is her name?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.\"\n\n\"Is she pretty?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly, sire; and I recognized the voice which pronounced my name\nin such tender accents. I accosted her, questioned her as well as I\nwas able to do, in the midst of the crowd; and she told me, without\nsuspecting anything, that a little while ago she was under the great\noak, with her two friends, when the sound of a wolf or a robber had\nterrified them, and made them run away.\"\n\n\"But,\" inquired the king, anxiously, \"what are the names of these two\nfriends?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"will your majesty send me forthwith to the\nBastile?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Because I am an egotist and a fool. My surprise was so great at such a\nconquest, and at so fortunate a discovery, that I went no further in my\ninquiries. Besides, I did not think that your majesty would attach any\nvery great importance to what you heard, knowing how much your attention\nwas taken up by Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and then, Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente left me precipitately, to return to Mademoiselle de la\nValliere.\"\n\n\"Let us hope, then, that I shall be as fortunate as yourself. Come,\nSaint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Your majesty is ambitions, I perceive, and does not wish to allow any\nconquest to escape you. Well, I assure you that I will conscientiously\nset about my inquiries; and, moreover, from one or the other of those\nThree Graces we shall learn the names of the rest, and by the names\ntheir secrets.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said the king, \"only require to hear her voice to know it\nagain. Come, let us say no more about it, but show me where poor La\nValliere is.\"\n\n\"Well,\" thought Saint-Aignan, \"the king's regard is beginning to display\nitself, and for that girl too. It is extraordinary; I should never have\nbelieved it.\" And with this thought passing through his mind, he showed\nthe king the room to which La Valliere had been carried; the king\nentered, followed by Saint-Aignan. In a low chamber, near a large\nwindow looking out upon the gardens, La Valliere, reclining in a large\narmchair, was inhaling deep draughts of the perfumed evening breeze.\nFrom the loosened body of her dress, the lace fell in tumbled folds,\nmingling with the tresses of her beautiful fair hair, which lay\nscattered upon her shoulders. Her languishing eyes were filled with\ntears; she seemed as lifeless as those beautiful visions of our dreams,\nthat pass before the mental eye of the sleeper, half-opening their wings\nwithout moving them, unclosing their lips without a sound escaping\nthem. The pearl-like pallor of La Valliere possessed a charm it would\nbe impossible to describe. Mental and bodily suffering had produced\nupon her features a soft and noble expression of grief; from the perfect\npassiveness of her arms and bust, she more resembled one whose soul had\npassed away, than a living being; she seemed not to hear either of\nthe whisperings which arose from the court. She seemed to be communing\nwithin herself; and her beautiful, delicate hands trembled from time\nto time as though at the contact of some invisible touch. She was so\ncompletely absorbed in her reverie, that the king entered without her\nperceiving him. At a distance he gazed upon her lovely face, upon which\nthe moon shed its pure silvery light.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" he exclaimed, with a terror he could not control, \"she\nis dead.\"\n\n\"No, sire,\" said Montalais, in a low voice; \"on the contrary, she is\nbetter. Are you not better, Louise?\"\n\nBut Louise did not answer. \"Louise,\" continued Montalais, \"the king has\ndeigned to express his uneasiness on your account.\"\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed Louise, starting up abruptly, as if a stream of\nfire had started through her frame to her heart; \"the king uneasy about\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"The king is here, then?\" said La Valliere, not venturing to look round\nher.\n\n\"That voice! that voice!\" whispered Louis, eagerly, to Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Yes, it is so,\" replied Saint-Aignan; \"your majesty is right; it is she\nwho declared her love for the sun.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said the king. And then approaching La Valliere, he said, \"You\nare not well, Mademoiselle de la Valliere? Just now, indeed, in the\npark, I saw that you had fainted. How were you attacked?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" stammered out the poor child, pale and trembling, \"I really do\nnot know.\"\n\n\"You have been walking too far,\" said the king; \"and fatigue, perhaps--\"\n\n\"No, sire,\" said Montalais, eagerly, answering for her friend, \"it could\nnot be from fatigue, for we passed most of the evening seated beneath\nthe royal oak.\"\n\n\"Under the royal oak?\" returned the king, starting. \"I was not deceived;\nit is as I thought.\" And he directed a look of intelligence at the\ncomte.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"under the royal oak, with Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" inquired Montalais.\n\n\"In a very simple way. Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente told me so.\"\n\n\"In that case, she probably told you the cause of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere's fainting?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; she told me something about a wolf or a robber. I forget\nprecisely which.\" La Valliere listened, her eyes fixed, her bosom\nheaving, as if, gifted with an acuteness of perception, she foresaw a\nportion of the truth. Louis imagined this attitude and agitation to\nbe the consequence of a terror only partially reassured. \"Nay, fear\nnothing,\" he said, with a rising emotion which he could not conceal;\n\"the wolf which terrified you so much was simply a wolf with two legs.\"\n\n\"It was a man, then!\" said Louise; \"it was a man who was listening?\"\n\n\"Suppose it was so, mademoiselle, what great harm was there in his\nhaving listened? Is it likely that, even in your own opinion, you would\nhave said anything which could not have been listened to?\"\n\nLa Valliere wrung her hands, and hid her face in them, as if to hide her\nblushes. \"In Heaven's name,\" she said, \"who was concealed there? Who was\nlistening?\"\n\nThe king advanced towards her, to take hold of one of her hands. \"It\nwas I,\" he said, bowing with marked respect. \"Is it likely I could have\nfrightened you?\" La Valliere uttered a loud cry; for the second time\nher strength forsook her; and moaning in utter despair, she again fell\nlifeless in her chair. The king had just time to hold out his arm; so\nthat she was partially supported by him. Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente\nand Montalais, who stood a few paces from the king and La Valliere,\nmotionless and almost petrified at the recollection of their\nconversation with La Valliere, did not even think of offering their\nassistance, feeling restrained by the presence of the king, who, with\none knee on the ground, held La Valliere round the waist with his arm.\n\n\"You heard, sire!\" murmured Athenais. But the king did not reply; he\nremained with his eyes fixed upon La Valliere's half-closed eyes, and\nheld her quiescent hand in his own.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Saint-Aignan, who, on his side, hoping that\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, too, would faint, advancing towards\nher, holding his arms extended,--\"of course; we did not even lose a\nsingle word.\" But the haughty Athenais was not a woman to faint easily;\nshe darted a terrible look at Saint-Aignan, and fled. Montalais, with\nmore courage, advanced hurriedly towards Louise, and received her from\nthe king's hands, who was already fast losing his presence of mind, as\nhe felt his face covered by the perfumed tresses of the seemingly dying\ngirl. \"Excellent,\" whispered Saint-Aignan. \"This is indeed an adventure;\nand it will be my own fault if I am not the first to relate it.\"\n\nThe king approached him, and, with a trembling voice and a passionate\ngesture, said, \"Not a syllable, comte.\"\n\nThe poor king forgot that, only an hour before, he had given him a\nsimilar recommendation, but with the very opposite intention; namely,\nthat the comte should be indiscreet. It followed, as a matter of course,\nthat he latter recommendation was quite as unnecessary as the\nformer. Half an hour afterwards, everybody in Fontainebleau knew that\nMademoiselle de la Valliere had had a conversation under the royal oak\nwith Montalais and Tonnay-Charente, and that in this conversation she\nhad confessed her affection for the king. It was known, also, that the\nking, after having manifested the uneasiness with which Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere's health had inspired him, had turned pale, and trembled\nvery much as he received the beautiful girl fainting into his arms; so\nthat it was quite agreed among the courtiers, that the greatest event of\nthe period had just been revealed; that his majesty loved Mademoiselle\nde la Valliere, and that, consequently, Monsieur could now sleep in\nperfect tranquillity. It was this, even, that the queen-mother, as\nsurprised as the others by the sudden change, hastened to tell the young\nqueen and Philip d'Orleans. Only she set to work in a different manner,\nby attacking them in the following way:--To her daughter-in-law she\nsaid, \"See, now, Therese, how very wrong you were to accuse the king;\nnow it is said he is devoted to some other person; why should there be\nany greater truth in the report of to-day than in that of yesterday, or\nin that of yesterday than in that of to-day?\" To Monsieur, in relating\nto him the adventure of the royal oak, she said, \"Are you not very\nabsurd in your jealousies, my dear Philip? It is asserted that the king\nis madly in love with that little La Valliere. Say nothing of it to\nyour wife; for the queen will know all about it very soon.\" This latter\nconfidential communication had an immediate result. Monsieur, who had\nregained his composure, went triumphantly to look after his wife, and\nit was not yet midnight and the _fete_ was to continue until two in the\nmorning, he offered her his hand for a promenade. At the end of a few\npaces, however, the first thing he did was to disobey his mother's\ninjunctions.\n\n\"Do not tell any one, the queen least of all,\" he said mysteriously,\n\"what people say about the king.\"\n\n\"What do they say about him?\" inquired Madame.\n\n\"That my brother has suddenly fallen in love.\"\n\n\"With whom?\"\n\n\"With Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\nAs it was dark, Madame could smile at her ease.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, \"and how long is it since this has been the case?\"\n\n\"For some days, it seems. But that was nothing but nonsense; it is only\nthis evening that he has revealed his passion.\"\n\n\"The king shows his good taste,\" said Madame; \"in my opinion she is a\nvery charming girl.\"\n\n\"I verily believe you are jesting.\"\n\n\"I! in what way?\"\n\n\"In any case this passion will make some one very happy, even if it be\nonly La Valliere herself.\"\n\n\"Really,\" continued the princess, \"you speak as if you had read into the\ninmost recesses of La Valliere's heart. Who has told you that she agrees\nto return the king's affection?\"\n\n\"And who has told you that she will not return it?\"\n\n\"She loves the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"She is even affianced to him.\"\n\n\"She was so.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"When they went to ask the king's permission to arrange the marriage, he\nrefused his permission.\"\n\n\"Refused?\"\n\n\"Yes, although the request was preferred by the Comte de la Fere\nhimself, for whom the king has the greatest regard, on account of the\npart he took in your royal brother's restoration, and in other events,\nalso, which happened a long time ago.\"\n\n\"Well! the poor lovers must wait until the king is pleased to change his\nopinion; they are young, and there is time enough.\"\n\n\"But, dear me,\" said Philip, laughing, \"I perceive you do not know the\nbest part of the affair.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"That by which the king was most deeply touched.\"\n\n\"The king, do you say, has been deeply touched?\"\n\n\"To the very quick of his heart.\"\n\n\"But how?--in what manner?--tell me directly.\"\n\n\"By an adventure, the romance of which cannot be equalled.\"\n\n\"You know how I love to hear of such adventures, and yet you keep me\nwaiting,\" said the princess, impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then--\" and Monsieur paused.\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"Under the royal oak--you know where the royal oak is?\"\n\n\"What can that matter? Under the royal oak, you were saying?\"\n\n\"Well! Mademoiselle de la Valliere, fancying herself to be alone with\nher two friends, revealed to them her affection for the king.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madame, beginning to be uneasy, \"her affection for the king?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"About an hour ago.\"\n\nMadame started, and then said, \"And no one knew of this affection?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"Not even his majesty?\"\n\n\"Not even his majesty. The artful little puss kept her secret strictly\nto herself, when suddenly it proved stronger than herself, and so\nescaped her.\"\n\n\"And from whom did you get this absurd tale?\"\n\n\"Why, as everybody else did, from La Valliere herself, who confessed her\nlove to Montalais and Tonnay-Charente, who were her companions.\"\n\nMadame stopped suddenly, and by a hasty movement let go her husband's\nhand.\n\n\"Did you say it was an hour ago she made this confession?\" Madame\ninquired.\n\n\"About that time.\"\n\n\"Is the king aware of it?\"\n\n\"Why, that is the very thing which constitutes the perfect romance of\nthe affair, for the king was behind the royal oak with Saint-Aignan, and\nheard the whole of the interesting conversation without losing a single\nword of it.\"\n\nMadame felt struck to the heart, saying incautiously, \"But I have seen\nthe king since, and he never told me a word about it.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Monsieur; \"he took care not to speak of it to you\nhimself, since he recommended every one not to say a word about it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Madame, growing angry.\n\n\"I mean that they wished to keep you in ignorance of the affair\naltogether.\"\n\n\"But why should they wish to conceal it from me?\"\n\n\"From the fear that your friendship for the young queen might induce you\nto say something about it to her, nothing more.\"\n\nMadame hung down her head; her feelings were grievously wounded. She\ncould not enjoy a moment's repose until she had met the king. As a king\nis, most naturally, the very last person in his kingdom who knows what\nis said about him, in the same way that a lover is the only one who is\nkept in ignorance of what is said about his mistress, therefore, when\nthe king perceived Madame, who was looking for him, he approached her\nin some perturbation, but still gracious and attentive in his manner.\nMadame waited for him to speak about La Valliere first; but as he did\nnot speak of her, she said, \"And the poor girl?\"\n\n\"What poor girl?\" said the king.\n\n\"La Valliere. Did you not tell me, sire, that she had fainted?\"\n\n\"She is still very ill,\" said the king, affecting the greatest\nindifference.\n\n\"But surely that will prejudicially affect the rumor you were going to\nspread, sire?\"\n\n\"What rumor?\"\n\n\"That your attention was taken up by her.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the king, carelessly, \"I trust it will be reported all the\nsame.\"\n\nMadame still waited; she wished to know if the king would speak to her\nof the adventure of the royal oak. But the king did not say a word about\nit. Madame, on her side, did not open her lips about it; so that the\nking took leave of her without having reposed the slightest confidence\nin her. Hardly had she watched the king move away, than she set out in\nsearch of Saint-Aignan. Saint-Aignan was never very difficult to find;\nhe was like the smaller vessels that always follow in the wake of, and\nas tenders to, the larger ships. Saint-Aignan was the very man whom\nMadame needed in her then state of mind. And as for him, he only looked\nfor worthier ears than others he had found to have an opportunity of\nrecounting the event in all its details. And so he did not spare Madame\na single word of the whole affair. When he had finished, Madame said to\nhim, \"Confess, now, that is his all a charming invention.\"\n\n\"Invention, no; a true story, yes.\"\n\n\"Confess, whether invention or true story, that it was told to you as\nyou have told it to me, but that you were not there.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, Madame, I was there.\"\n\n\"And you think that these confessions may have made an impression on the\nking?\"\n\n\"Certainly, as those of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente did upon me,\"\nreplied Saint-Aignan; \"do not forget, Madame, that Mademoiselle de la\nValliere compared the king to the sun; that was flattering enough.\"\n\n\"The king does not permit himself to be influenced by such flatteries.\"\n\n\"Madame, the king is just as much Adonis as Apollo; and I saw plain\nenough just now when La Valliere fell into his arms.\"\n\n\"La Valliere fell into the king's arms!\"\n\n\"Oh! it was the most graceful picture possible; just imagine, La\nValliere had fallen back fainting, and--\"\n\n\"Well! what did you see?--tell me--speak!\"\n\n\"I saw what ten other people saw at the same time as myself; I saw that\nwhen La Valliere fell into his arms, the king almost fainted himself.\"\n\nMadame smothered a subdued cry, the only indication of her smothered\nanger.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, laughing in a convulsive manner, \"you relate\nstories delightfully, M. de Saint-Aignan.\" And she hurried away, alone,\nand almost suffocated by painful emotion, towards the chateau.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIV. Courses de Nuit.\n\nMonsieur quitted the princess in the best possible humor, and feeling\ngreatly fatigued, retired to his apartments, leaving every one to finish\nthe night as he chose. When in his room, Monsieur began to dress for the\nnight with careful attention, which displayed itself from time to time\nin paroxysms of satisfaction. While his attendants were engaged in\ncurling his hair, he sang the principal airs of the ballet which the\nviolins had played, and to which the king had danced. He then summoned\nhis tailors, inspected his costumes for the next day, and, in token of\nhis extreme satisfaction, distributed various presents among them. As,\nhowever, the Chevalier de Lorraine, who had seen the prince return to\nthe chateau, entered the room, Monsieur overwhelmed him with kindness.\nThe former, after having saluted the prince, remained silent for a\nmoment, like a sharpshooter who deliberates before deciding in what\ndirection he will renew his fire; then, seeming to make up his mind, he\nsaid, \"Have you remarked a very singular coincidence, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"No; what is it?\"\n\n\"The bad reception which his majesty, in appearance, gave the Comte de\nGuiche.\"\n\n\"In appearance?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; since, in reality, he has restored him to favor.\"\n\n\"I did not notice it,\" said the prince.\n\n\"What, did you not remark, that, instead of ordering him to go away\nagain into exile, as was natural, he encouraged him in his opposition by\npermitting him to resume his place in the ballet?\"\n\n\"And you think the king was wrong, chevalier?\" said the prince.\n\n\"Are you not of my opinion, prince?\"\n\n\"Not altogether so, my dear chevalier; and I think the king was quite\nright not to have made a disturbance against a poor fellow whose want of\njudgment is more to be complained of than his intention.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said the chevalier, \"as far as I am concerned, I confess that\nthis magnanimity astonishes me to the highest degree.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" inquired Philip.\n\n\"Because I should have thought the king had been more jealous,\" replied\nthe chevalier, spitefully. During the last few minutes Monsieur had\nfelt there was something of an irritating nature concealed under his\nfavorite's remarks; this last word, however, ignited the powder.\n\n\"Jealous!\" exclaimed the prince. \"Jealous! what do you mean? Jealous of\nwhat, if you please--or jealous of whom?\"\n\nThe chevalier perceived that he had allowed an excessively mischievous\nremark to escape him, as he was in the habit of doing. He endeavored,\ntherefore, apparently to recall it while it was still possible to do so.\n\"Jealous of his authority,\" he said, with an assumed frankness; \"of what\nelse would you have the king jealous?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the prince, \"that's very proper.\"\n\n\"Did your royal highness,\" continued the chevalier, \"solicit dear De\nGuiche's pardon?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Monsieur. \"De Guiche is an excellent fellow, and full\nof courage; but as I do not approve of his conduct with Madame, I wish\nhim neither harm nor good.\"\n\nThe chevalier had assumed a bitterness with regard to De Guiche, as he\nhad attempted to do with regard to the king; but he thought he perceived\nthat the time for indulgence, and even for the utmost indifference,\nhad arrived, and that, in order to throw some light on the question, it\nmight be necessary for him to put the lamp, as the saying is, beneath\nthe husband's very nose.\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" said the chevalier to himself, \"I must wait for\nDe Wardes; he will do more in one day than I in a month; for I verily\nbelieve he is even more envious than I. Then, again, it is not De Wardes\nI require so much as that some event or another should happen; and in\nthe whole of this affair I see none. That De Guiche returned after he\nhad been sent away is certainly serious enough, but all its seriousness\ndisappears when I learn that De Guiche has returned at the very moment\nMadame troubles herself no longer about him. Madame, in fact, is\noccupied with the king, that is clear; but she will not be so much\nlonger if, as it is asserted, the king has ceased to trouble his\nhead about her. The moral of the whole matter is, to remain perfectly\nneutral, and await the arrival of some new caprice and let that\ndecide the whole affair.\" And the chevalier thereupon settled himself\nresignedly in the armchair in which Monsieur permitted him to seat\nhimself in his presence, and, having no more spiteful or malicious\nremarks to make, the consequence was that De Lorraine's wit seemed to\nhave deserted him. Most fortunately Monsieur was in high good-humor,\nand he had enough for two, until the time arrived for dismissing\nhis servants and gentlemen of the chamber, and he passed into his\nsleeping-apartment. As he withdrew, he desired the chevalier to\npresent his compliments to Madame, and say that, as the night was cool,\nMonsieur, who was afraid of the toothache, would not venture out again\ninto the park during the remainder of the evening. The chevalier entered\nthe princess's apartments at the very moment she came in herself. He\nacquitted himself faithfully of the commission intrusted to him, and, in\nthe first place, remarked all the indifference and annoyance with\nwhich Madame received her husband's communication--a circumstance which\nappeared to him fraught with something fresh. If Madame had been about\nto leave her apartments with that strangeness of manner, he would have\nfollowed her; but she was returning to them; there was nothing to\nbe done, therefore he turned upon his heel like an unemployed heron,\nappearing to question earth, air, and water about it; shook his head,\nand walked away mechanically in the direction of the gardens. He had\nhardly gone a hundred paces when he met two young men, walking arm in\narm, with their heads bent down, and idly kicking the small stones out\nof their path as they walked on, plunged in thought. It was De Guiche\nand De Bragelonne, the sight of whom, as it always did, produced upon\nthe chevalier, instinctively, a feeling of repugnance. He did not,\nhowever, the less, on that account, salute them with a very low bow,\nwhich they returned with interest. Then, observing that the park was\nnearly deserted, that the illuminations began to burn out, and that the\nmorning breeze was setting in, he turned to the left, and entered the\nchateau again, by one of the smaller courtyards. The others turned aside\nto the right, and continued on their way towards the large park. As the\nchevalier was ascending the side staircase, which led to the private\nentrance, he saw a woman, followed by another, make her appearance under\nthe arcade which led from the small to the large courtyard. The two\nwomen walked so fast that the rustling of their dresses could be\ndistinguished through the silence of the night. The style of their\nmantles, their graceful figures, a mysterious yet haughty carriage which\ndistinguished them both, especially the one who walked first, struck the\nchevalier.\n\n\"I certainly know those two,\" he said to himself, pausing upon the top\nstep of the small staircase. Then, as with the instinct of a bloodhound\nhe was about to follow them, one of the servants who had been running\nafter him arrested his attention.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"the courier has arrived.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the chevalier, \"there is time enough; to-morrow will\ndo.\"\n\n\"There are some urgent letters which you would be glad to see, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Where from?\" inquired the chevalier.\n\n\"One from England, and the other from Calais; the latter arrived by\nexpress, and seems of great importance.\"\n\n\"From Calais! Who the deuce can have to write to me from Calais?\"\n\n\"I think I recognize the handwriting of Monsieur le Comte de Wardes.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the chevalier, forgetting his intention of acting the\nspy, \"in that case I will come up at once.\" This he did, while the two\nunknown beings disappeared at the end of the court opposite to the one\nby which they had just entered. We shall now follow them, and leave the\nchevalier undisturbed to his correspondence. When they had arrived at\nthe grove of trees, the foremost of the two halted, somewhat out of\nbreath, and, cautiously raising her hood, said, \"Are we still far from\nthe tree?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, more than five hundred paces; but pray rest awhile, you\nwill not be able to walk much longer at this rate.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the princes, for it was she; and she leaned\nagainst a tree. \"And now,\" she resumed, after having recovered her\nbreath, \"tell me the whole truth, and conceal nothing from me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame,\" cried the young girl, \"you are already angry with me.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Athenais, reassure yourself, I am in no way angry with you.\nAfter all, these things do not concern me personally. You are anxious\nabout what you may have said under the oak; you are afraid of having\noffended the king, and I wish to tranquillize you by ascertaining myself\nif it were possible you could have been overheard.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Madame, the king was close to us.\"\n\n\"Still, you were not speaking so loud that some of your remarks may not\nhave been lost.\"\n\n\"We thought we were quite alone, Madame.\"\n\n\"There were three of you, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes; La Valliere, Montalais, and myself.\"\n\n\"And _you_, individually, spoke in a light manner of the king?\"\n\n\"I am afraid so. Should such be the case, will your highness have the\nkindness to make my peace with his majesty?\"\n\n\"If there should be any occasion for it, I promise you I will do so.\nHowever, as I have already told you, it will be better not to anticipate\nevil. The night is now very dark, and the darkness is still greater\nunder the trees. It is not likely you were recognized by the king. To\ninform him of it, by being the first to speak, is to denounce yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame, Madame! if Mademoiselle de la Valliere were recognized,\nI must have been recognized also. Besides, M. de Saint-Aignan left no\ndoubt on the subject.\"\n\n\"Did you, then, say anything very disrespectful of the king?\"\n\n\"Not at all; it was one of the others who made some very flattering\nspeeches about the king; and my remarks must have been much in contrast\nwith hers.\"\n\n\"Montalais is such a giddy girl,\" said Madame.\n\n\"It was not Montalais. Montalais said nothing; it was La Valliere.\"\n\nMadame started as if she had not known it perfectly well already. \"No,\nno,\" she said, \"the king cannot have heard. Besides, we will now try the\nexperiment for which we came out. Show me the oak. Do you know where it\nis?\" she continued.\n\n\"Alas! Madame, yes.\"\n\n\"And you can find it again?\"\n\n\"With my eyes shut.\"\n\n\"Very well; sit down on the bank where you were, where La Valliere was,\nand speak in the same tone and to the same effect as you did before; I\nwill conceal myself in the thicket, and if I can hear you, I will tell\nyou so.\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"If, therefore, you really spoke loud enough for the king to have heard\nyou, in that case--\"\n\nAthenais seemed to await the conclusion of the sentence with some\nanxiety.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Madame, in a suffocated voice, arising doubtless\nfrom her hurried progress, \"in that case, I forbid you--\" And Madame\nagain increased her pace. Suddenly, however, she stopped. \"An idea\noccurs to me,\" she said.\n\n\"A good idea, no doubt, Madame,\" replied Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente.\n\n\"Montalais must be as much embarrassed as La Valliere and yourself.\"\n\n\"Less so, for she is less compromised, having said less.\"\n\n\"That does not matter; she will help you, I dare say, by deviating a\nlittle from the exact truth.\"\n\n\"Especially if she knows that your highness is kind enough to interest\nyourself about me.\"\n\n\"Very well, I think I have discovered what it is best for you all to\npretend.\"\n\n\"How delightful.\"\n\n\"You had better say that all three of you were perfectly well aware that\nthe king was behind the tree, or behind the thicket, whichever it might\nhave been; and that you knew M. de Saint-Aignan was there too.\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame.\"\n\n\"For you cannot disguise it from yourself, Athenais, Saint-Aignan takes\nadvantage of some very flattering remarks you made about him.\"\n\n\"Well, Madame, you see very clearly that one can be overheard,\" cried\nAthenais, \"since M. de Saint-Aignan overheard us.\"\n\nMadame bit her lips, for she had thoughtlessly committed herself. \"Oh,\nyou know Saint-Aignan's character very well,\" she said, \"the favor the\nking shows him almost turns his brain, and he talks at random; not only\nso, he very often invents. That is not the question; the fact remains,\ndid or did not the king overhear?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Madame, he certainly did,\" said Athenais, in despair.\n\n\"In that case, do what I said: maintain boldly that all three of you\nknew--mind, all three of you, for if there is a doubt about any one of\nyou, there will be a doubt about all,--persist, I say, that you knew\nthat the king and M. de Saint-Aignan were there, and that you wished to\namuse yourself at the expense of those who were listening.\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame, at the _king's_ expense; we shall never dare say that!\"\n\n\"It is a simple jest; an innocent deception readily permitted in young\ngirls whom men wish to take by surprise. In this manner everything\nexplains itself. What Montalais said of Malicorne, a mere jest; what you\nsaid of M. de Saint-Aignan, a mere jest too; and what La Valliere might\nhave said of--\"\n\n\"And which she would have given anything to recall.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Very well, an additional reason. Say the whole affair was a mere\njoke. M. de Malicorne will have no occasion to get out of temper; M.\nde Saint-Aignan will be completely put out of countenance; _he_ will be\nlaughed at instead of you; and lastly, the king will be punished for a\ncuriosity unworthy of his rank. Let people laugh a little at the king in\nthis affair, and I do not think he will complain of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Madame, you are indeed an angel of goodness and sense!\"\n\n\"It is to my own advantage.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"How can you ask me why it is to my advantage to spare my maids of honor\nthe remarks, annoyances, perhaps even calumnies, that might follow?\nAlas! you well know that the court has no indulgence for this sort of\npeccadillo. But we have now been walking for some time, shall we be long\nbefore we reach it?\"\n\n\"About fifty or sixty paces further; turn to the left, Madame, if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"And you are sure of Montalais?\" said Madame.\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n\n\"Will she do what you ask her?\"\n\n\"Everything. She will be delighted.\"\n\n\"And La Valliere--\" ventured the princess.\n\n\"Ah, there will be some difficulty with her, Madame; she would scorn to\ntell a falsehood.\"\n\n\"Yet, when it is in her interest to do so--\"\n\n\"I am afraid that that would not make the slightest difference in her\nideas.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Madame. \"I have been already told that; she is one of\nthose overnice and affectedly particular people who place heaven in the\nforeground in order to conceal themselves behind it. But if she refuses\nto tell a falsehood,--as she will expose herself to the jests of the\nwhole court, as she will have annoyed the king by a confession as\nridiculous as it was immodest,--Mademoiselle la Baume le Blanc de la\nValliere will think it but proper I should send her back again to her\npigeons in the country, in order that, in Touraine yonder, or in Le\nBlaisois,--I know not where it may be,--she may at her ease study\nsentiment and pastoral life combined.\"\n\nThese words were uttered with a vehemence and harshness that terrified\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; and the consequence was, that, as far\nas she was concerned, she promised to tell as many falsehoods as might\nbe necessary. It was in this frame of mind that Madame and her companion\nreached the precincts of the royal oak.\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Tonnay-Charente.\n\n\"We shall soon learn if one can overhear,\" replied Madame.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered the young girl, holding Madame back with a hurried\ngesture, entirely forgetful of her companion's rank. Madame stopped.\n\n\"You see that you can hear,\" said Athenais.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\nMadame held her breath; and, in fact, the following words pronounced by\na gentle and melancholy voice, floated towards them:\n\n\"I tell you, vicomte, I tell you I love her madly; I tell you I love her\nto distraction.\"\n\nMadame started at the voice; and, beneath her hood, a bright joyous\nsmile illumined her features. It was she who now held back her\ncompanion, and with a light step leading her some twenty paces away,\nthat is to say, out of the reach of the voice, she said, \"Remain here,\nmy dear Athenais, and let no one surprise us. I think it must be you\nthey are conversing about.\"\n\n\"Me, Madame?\"\n\n\"Yes, you--or rather your adventure. I will go and listen; if we were\nboth there, we should be discovered. Or, stay!--go and fetch Montalais,\nand then return and wait for me with her at the entrance of the forest.\"\nAnd then, as Athenais hesitated, she again said \"Go!\" in a voice which\ndid not admit of reply. Athenais thereupon arranged her dress so as to\nprevent its rustling being heard; and, by a path beyond the group of\ntrees, she regained the flower-garden. As for Madame, she concealed\nherself in the thicket, leaning her back against a gigantic\nchestnut-tree, one of the branches of which had been cut in such\na manner as to form a seat, and waited there, full of anxiety and\napprehension. \"Now,\" she said, \"since one can hear from this place, let\nus listen to what M. de Bragelonne and that other madly-in-love fool,\nthe Comte de Guiche, have to say about me.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XLV. In Which Madame Acquires a Proof that Listeners Hear What\nIs Said.\n\nThere was a moment's silence, as if the mysterious sounds of night were\nhushed to listen, at the same time as Madame, to the youthful passionate\ndisclosures of De Guiche.\n\nRaoul was about to speak. He leaned indolently against the trunk of the\nlarge oak, and replied in his sweet and musical voice, \"Alas, my dear De\nGuiche, it is a great misfortune.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the latter, \"great indeed.\"\n\n\"You do not understand me, De Guiche. I say that it is a great\nmisfortune for you, not merely loving, but not knowing how to conceal\nyour love.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"Yes, you do not perceive one thing; namely, that it is no longer to the\nonly friend you have,--in other words,--to a man who would rather die\nthan betray you; you do not perceive, I say, that it is no longer to\nyour only friend that you confide your passion, but to the first person\nthat approaches you.\"\n\n\"Are you mad, Bragelonne,\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"to say such a thing to\nme?\"\n\n\"The fact stands thus, however.\"\n\n\"Impossible! How, in what manner can I have ever been indiscreet to such\nan extent?\"\n\n\"I mean, that your eyes, your looks, your sighs, proclaim, in spite of\nyourself, that exaggerated feeling which leads and hurries a man beyond\nhis own control. In such a case he ceases to be master of himself; he is\na prey to a mad passion, that makes him confide his grief to the trees,\nor to the air, from the very moment he has no longer any living being in\nreach of his voice. Besides, remember this: it very rarely happens that\nthere is not always some one present to hear, especially the very things\nwhich ought _not_ to be heard.\" De Guiche uttered a deep sigh. \"Nay,\"\ncontinued Bragelonne, \"you distress me; since your return here, you have\na thousand times, and in a thousand different ways, confessed your love\nfor her; and yet, had you not said one word, your return alone would\nhave been a terrible indiscretion. I persist, then, in drawing this\nconclusion; that if you do not place a better watch over yourself than\nyou have hitherto done, one day or other something will happen that will\ncause an explosion. Who will save you then? Answer me. Who will save\nher? for, innocent as she will be of your affection, your affection will\nbe an accusation against her in the hands of her enemies.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" murmured De Guiche; and a deep sigh accompanied the exclamation.\n\n\"That is not answering me, De Guiche.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Well, what reply have you to make?\"\n\n\"This, that when the day arrives I shall be no more a living being than\nI feel myself now.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"So many vicissitudes have worn me out. At present, I am no more a\nthinking, acting being; at present, the most worthless of men is\nbetter than I am; my remaining strength is exhausted, my latest-formed\nresolutions have vanished, and I abandon myself to my fate. When a man\nis out campaigning, as we have been together, and he sets off alone and\nunaccompanied for a skirmish, it sometimes happens that he may meet with\na party of five or six foragers, and although alone, he defends himself;\nafterwards, five or six others arrive unexpectedly, his anger is aroused\nand he persists; but if six, eight, or ten others should still be met\nwith, he either sets spurs to his horse, if he should still happen to\nretain one, or lets himself be slain to save an ignominious flight.\nSuch, indeed, is my own case: first, I had to struggle against myself;\nafterwards, against Buckingham; now, since the king is in the field, I\nwill not contend against the king, nor even, I wish you to understand,\nwill the king retire; nor even against the nature of that woman. Still\nI do not deceive myself; having devoted myself to the service of such a\nlove, I will lose my life in it.\"\n\n\"It is not the lady you ought to reproach,\" replied Raoul; \"it is\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"You know the princess's character,--somewhat giddy, easily captivated\nby novelty, susceptible to flattery, whether it come from a blind person\nor a child, and yet you allow your passion for her to eat your very life\naway. Look at her,--love her, if you will,--for no one whose heart is\nnot engaged elsewhere can see her without loving her. Yet, while you\nlove her, respect, in the first place, her husband's rank, then herself,\nand lastly, your own safety.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Raoul.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Because, seeing how much I suffer through this woman, you endeavor\nto console me, because you tell me all the good of her you think, and\nperhaps even that which you do not think.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Raoul, \"there you are wrong, comte; what I think I do not\nalways say, but in that case I say nothing; but when I speak, I know not\nhow to feign or to deceive; and whoever listens to me may believe me.\"\n\nDuring this conversation, Madame, her head stretched forward with\neager ear and dilated glance, endeavoring to penetrate the obscurity,\nthirstily drank in the faintest sound of their voices.\n\n\"Oh, I know her better than you do, then!\" exclaimed Guiche. \"She is not\nmerely giddy, but frivolous; she is not only attracted by novelty,\nshe is utterly oblivious, and is without faith; she is not simply\nsusceptible to flattery, she is a practiced and cruel coquette. A\nthorough coquette! yes, yes, I am sure of it. Believe me, Bragelonne,\nI am suffering all the torments of hell; brave, passionately fond of\ndanger, I meet a danger greater than my strength and my courage. But,\nbelieve me, Raoul, I reserve for myself a victory which shall cost her\nfloods of tears.\"\n\n\"A victory,\" he asked, \"and of what kind?\"\n\n\"Of what kind, you ask?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One day I will accost her, and will address her thus: 'I was young--\nmadly in love, I possessed, however, sufficient respect to throw myself\nat your feet, and to prostrate myself in the dust, if your looks had not\nraised me to your hand. I fancied I understood your looks, I rose, and\nthen, without having done anything more towards you than love you yet\nmore devotedly, if that were possible--you, a woman without heart,\nfaith, or love, in very wantonness, dashed me down again from sheer\ncaprice. You are unworthy, princess of the royal blood though you may\nbe, of the love of a man of honor; I offer my life as a sacrifice for\nhaving loved you too tenderly, and I die despairing you.'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Raoul, terrified at the accents of profound truth which De\nGuiche's words betrayed, \"I was right in saying you were mad, Guiche.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" exclaimed De Guiche, following out his own idea; \"since\nthere are no wars here now, I will flee yonder to the north, seek\nservice in the Empire, where some Hungarian, or Croat, or Turk, will\nperhaps kindly put me out of my misery.\" De Guiche did not finish, or\nrather as he finished, a sound made him start, and at the same moment\ncaused Raoul to leap to his feet. As for De Guiche, buried in his own\nthoughts, he remained seated, with his head tightly pressed between his\nhands. The branches of the tree were pushed aside, and a woman, pale and\nmuch agitated, appeared before the two young men. With one hand she\nheld back the branches, which would have struck her face, and, with the\nother, she raised the hood of the mantle which covered her shoulders.\nBy her clear and lustrous glance, by her lofty carriage, by her haughty\nattitude, and, more than all that, by the throbbing of his own heart, De\nGuiche recognized Madame, and, uttering a loud cry, he removed his hands\nfrom his temple, and covered his eyes with them. Raoul, trembling and\nout of countenance, merely muttered a few words of respect.\n\n\"Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" said the princess, \"have the goodness, I beg,\nto see if my attendants are not somewhere yonder, either in the walks or\nin the groves; and you, M. de Guiche, remain here: I am tired, and you\nwill perhaps give me your arm.\"\n\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the unhappy young man, he would\nhave been less terrified than by her cold and severe tone. However, as\nhe himself had just said, he was brave; and as in the depths of his own\nheart he had just decisively made up his mind, De Guiche arose, and,\nobserving Bragelonne's hesitation, he turned towards him a glance full\nof resignation and grateful acknowledgement. Instead of immediately\nanswering Madame, he even advanced a step towards the vicomte, and\nholding out the arm which the princess had just desired him to give her,\nhe pressed his friend's hand in his own, with a sigh, in which he seemed\nto give to friendship all the life that was left in the depths of his\nheart. Madame, who in her pride had never known what it was to wait, now\nwaited until this mute colloquy was at an end. Her royal hand remained\nsuspended in the air, and, when Raoul had left, it sank without anger,\nbut not without emotion, in that of De Guiche. They were alone in the\ndepths of the dark and silent forest, and nothing could be heard but\nRaoul's hastily retreating footsteps along the obscure paths. Over their\nheads was extended the thick and fragrant vault of branches, through the\noccasional openings of which the stars could be seen glittering in their\nbeauty. Madame softly drew De Guiche about a hundred paces away from\nthat indiscreet tree which had heard, and had allowed so many things to\nbe heard, during the evening, and, leading him to a neighboring glade,\nso that they could see a certain distance around them, she said in a\ntrembling voice, \"I have brought you here, because yonder where you\nwere, everything can be overheard.\"\n\n\"Everything can be overheard, did you say, Madame?\" replied the young\nman, mechanically.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Which means--\" murmured De Guiche.\n\n\"Which means that I have heard every syllable you have said.\"\n\n\"Oh, Heaven! this only was wanting to destroy me,\" stammered De Guiche;\nand he bent down his head, like an exhausted swimmer beneath the wave\nwhich engulfs him.\n\n\"And so,\" she said, \"you judge me as you have said?\" De Guiche grew\npale, turned his head aside, and was silent. He felt almost on the point\nof fainting.\n\n\"I do not complain,\" continued the princess, in a tone of voice full\nof gentleness; \"I prefer a frankness that wounds me, to flattery, which\nwould deceive me. And so, according to your opinion, M. de Guiche, I am\na coquette, an a worthless creature.\"\n\n\"Worthless,\" cried the young man; \"you worthless! Oh, no; most certainly\nI did not say, I could not have said, that that which was the most\nprecious object in life for me could be worthless. No, no; I did not say\nthat.\"\n\n\"A woman who sees a man perish, consumed by the fire she has kindled,\nand who does not allay that fire, is, in my opinion, a worthless woman.\"\n\n\"What can it matter to you what I said?\" returned the comte. \"What am\nI compared to you, and why should you even trouble yourself to know\nwhether I exist or not?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Guiche, both you and I are human beings, and, knowing you\nas I do, I do not wish you to risk your life; with you I will change\nmy conduct and character. I will be, not frank, for I am always so, but\ntruthful. I implore you, therefore, to love me no more, and to forget\nutterly that I have ever addressed a word or a glance towards you.\"\n\nDe Guiche turned around, bending a look full of passionate devotion upon\nher. \"You,\" he said; \"_you_ excuse yourself; _you_ implore me?\"\n\n\"Certainly; since I have done evil, I ought to repair the evil I have\ndone. And so, comte, this is what we will agree to. You will forgive my\nfrivolity and my coquetry. Nay, do not interrupt me. I will forgive\nyou for having said I was frivolous and a coquette, or something worse,\nperhaps; and you will renounce your idea of dying, and will preserve for\nyour family, for the king, and for our sex, a cavalier whom every one\nesteems, and whom many hold dear.\" Madame pronounced this last word\nin such an accent of frankness, and even of tenderness, that poor De\nGuiche's heart felt almost bursting.\n\n\"Oh! Madame, Madame!\" he stammered out.\n\n\"Nay, listen further,\" she continued. \"When you shall have renounced\nall thought of me forever, from necessity in the first place, and,\nnext, because you will yield to my entreaty, then you will judge me more\nfavorably, and I am convinced you will replace this love--forgive the\nfrivolity of the expression--by a sincere friendship, which you will\nbe ready to offer me, and which, I promise you, shall be cordially\naccepted.\"\n\nDe Guiche, his forehead bedewed with perspiration, a feeling of death\nin his heart, and a trembling agitation through his whole frame, bit\nhis lip, stamped his foot on the ground, and, in a word, devoured\nthe bitterness of his grief. \"Madame,\" he said, \"what you offer is\nimpossible, and I cannot accept such conditions.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Madame, \"do you refuse my friendship, then?\"\n\n\"No, no! I do not need your friendship, Madame. I prefer to die from\nlove, than to live for friendship.\"\n\n\"Comte!\"\n\n\"Oh! Madame,\" cried De Guiche, \"the present is a moment for me, in\nwhich no other consideration and no other respect exist, than the\nconsideration and respect of a man of honor towards the woman he\nworships. Drive me away, curse me, denounce me, you will be perfectly\nright. I have uttered complaints against you, but their bitterness has\nbeen owing to my passion for you; I have said I wish to die, and die I\nwill. If I lived, you would forget me; but dead, you would never forget\nme, I am sure.\"\n\nHenrietta, who was standing buried in thought, and nearly as agitated as\nDe Guiche himself, turned aside her head as but a minute before he had\nturned aside his. Then, after a moment's pause, she said, \"And you love\nme, then, very much?\"\n\n\"Madly; madly enough to die from it, whether you drive me from you, or\nwhether you listen to me still.\"\n\n\"It is a hopeless case,\" she said, in a playful manner; \"a case which\nmust be treated with soothing application. Give me your hand. It is as\ncold as ice.\" De Guiche knelt down, and pressed to his lips, not one,\nbut both of Madame's hands.\n\n\"Love me, then,\" said the princess, \"since it cannot be otherwise.\" And\nalmost imperceptibly she pressed his fingers, raising him thus, partly\nin the manner of a queen, and partly as a fond and affectionate woman\nwould have done. De Guiche trembled from head to foot, and Madame, who\nfelt how passion coursed through every fiber of his being, knew that\nhe indeed loved truly. \"Give me your arm, comte,\" she said, \"and let us\nreturn.\"\n\n\"Ah! Madame,\" said the comte, trembling and bewildered; \"you have\ndiscovered a third way of killing me.\"\n\n\"But, happily, it is the slowest way, is it not?\" she replied, as she\nled him towards the grove of trees they had so lately quitted.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVI. Aramis's Correspondence.\n\nWhen De Guiche's affairs, which had been suddenly set to right without\nhis having been able to guess the cause of their improvement, assumed\nthe unexpected aspect we have seen, Raoul, in obedience to the request\nof the princess, had withdrawn in order not to interrupt an explanation,\nthe results of which he was far from guessing; and he soon after joined\nthe ladies of honor who were walking about in the flower-gardens. During\nthis time, the Chevalier de Lorraine, who had returned to his own room,\nread De Wardes's latter with surprise, for it informed him by the hand\nof his valet, of the sword-thrust received at Calais, and of all the\ndetails of the adventure, and invited him to inform De Guiche and\nMonsieur, whatever there might be in the affair likely to be most\ndisagreeable to both of them. De Wardes particularly endeavored to prove\nto the chevalier the violence of Madame's affection for Buckingham, and\nhe finished his letter by declaring that he thought this feeling was\nreturned. The chevalier shrugged his shoulders at the last paragraph,\nand, in fact, De Wardes was out of date, as we have seen. De Wardes was\nstill only at Buckingham's affair. The chevalier threw the letter over\nhis shoulder upon an adjoining table, and said in a disdainful tone,\n\"It is really incredible; and yet poor De Wardes is not deficient in\nability; but the truth is, it is not very apparent, so easy is it to\ngrow rusty in the country. The deuce take the simpleton, who ought to\nhave written to me about matters of importance, and yet he writes such\nsilly stuff as that. If it had not been for that miserable letter, which\nhas no meaning at all in it, I should have detected in the grove yonder\na charming little intrigue, which would have compromised a woman, would\nhave perhaps have been as good as a sword-thrust for a man, and have\ndiverted Monsieur for many days to come.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch. \"It is now too late,\" he said. \"One o'clock\nin the morning; every one must have returned to the king's apartments,\nwhere the night is to be finished; well, the scent is lost, and unless\nsome extraordinary chance--\" And thus saying, as if to appeal to his\ngood star, the chevalier, greatly out of temper, approached the\nwindow, which looked out upon a somewhat solitary part of the garden.\nImmediately, and as if some evil genius was at his orders, he perceived\nreturning towards the chateau, accompanied by a man, a silk mantle of\na dark color, and recognized the figure which had struck his attention\nhalf an hour previously.\n\n\"Admirable!\" he thought, striking his hands together, \"this is my\nprovidential mysterious affair.\" And he started out precipitately, along\nthe staircase, hoping to reach the courtyard in time to recognize the\nwoman in the mantle, and her companion. But as he arrived at the door of\nthe little court, he nearly knocked against Madame, whose radiant face\nseemed full of charming revelations beneath the mantle which protected\nwithout concealing her. Unfortunately, Madame was alone. The chevalier\nknew that since he had seen her, not five minutes before, with a\ngentleman, the gentleman in question could not be far off. Consequently,\nhe hardly took time to salute the princess as he drew up to allow her\nto pass; then when she had advanced a few steps, with the rapidity of a\nwoman who fears recognition, and when the chevalier perceived that she\nwas too much occupied with her own thoughts to trouble herself about\nhim, he darted into the garden, looked hastily round on every side, and\nembraced within his glance as much of the horizon as he possibly could.\nHe was just in time; the gentleman who had accompanied Madame was still\nin sight; only he was hurrying towards one of the wings of the chateau,\nbehind which he was on the point of disappearing. There was not an\ninstant to lose; the chevalier darted in pursuit of him, prepared to\nslacken his pace as he approached the unknown; but in spite of the\ndiligence he used, the unknown had disappeared behind the flight of\nsteps before he approached.\n\nIt was evident, however, that as the man pursued was walking quietly, in\na pensive manner, with his head bent down, either beneath the weight of\ngrief or happiness, when once the angle was passed, unless, indeed, he\nwere to enter by some door or another, the chevalier could not fail to\novertake him. And this, certainly, would have happened, if, at the\nvery moment he turned the angle, the chevalier had not run against two\npersons, who were themselves wheeling in the opposite direction.\nThe chevalier was ready to seek a quarrel with these two troublesome\nintruders, when, looking up, he recognized the superintendent. Fouquet\nwas accompanied by a person whom the chevalier now saw for the first\ntime. This stranger was the bishop of Vannes. Checked by the important\ncharacter of the individual, and obliged out of politeness to make his\nown excuses when he expected to receive them, the chevalier stepped back\na few paces; and as Monsieur Fouquet possessed, if not the friendship,\nat least the respect of every one; as the king himself, although he was\nrather his enemy than his friend, treated M. Fouquet as a man of great\nconsideration, the chevalier did what the king himself would have done,\nnamely, he bowed to M. Fouquet, who returned his salutation with kindly\npoliteness, perceiving that the gentleman had run against him by mistake\nand without any intention of being rude. Then, almost immediately\nafterwards, having recognized the Chevalier de Lorraine, he made a few\ncivil remarks, to which the chevalier was obliged to reply. Brief as the\nconversation was, De Lorraine saw, with the most unfeigned displeasure,\nthe figure of his unknown becoming dimmer in the distance, and fast\ndisappearing in the darkness. The chevalier resigned himself, and,\nonce resigned, gave his entire attention to Fouquet:--\"You arrive late,\nmonsieur,\" he said. \"Your absence has occasioned great surprise, and\nI heard Monsieur express himself as much astonished that, having been\ninvited by the king, you had not come.\"\n\n\"It was impossible for me to do so; but I came as soon as I was free.\"\n\n\"Is Paris quiet?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so. Paris has received the last tax very well.\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand you wished to assure yourself of this good feeling\nbefore you came to participate in our _fetes_.\"\n\n\"I have arrived, however, somewhat late to enjoy them. I will ask you,\ntherefore, to inform me if the king is in the chateau or not, if I am\nlikely to be able to see him this evening, or if I shall have to wait\nuntil to-morrow.\"\n\n\"We have lost sight of his majesty during the last half-hour nearly,\"\nsaid the chevalier.\n\n\"Perhaps he is in Madame's apartments?\" inquired Fouquet.\n\n\"Not in Madame's apartments, I should think, for I just now met Madame\nas she was entering by the small staircase; and unless the gentleman\nwhom you a moment ago encountered was the king himself--\" and the\nchevalier paused, hoping that, in this manner, he might learn who it\nwas he had been hurrying after. But Fouquet, whether he had or had not\nrecognized De Guiche, simply replied, \"No, monsieur, it was not the\nking.\"\n\nThe chevalier, disappointed in his expectation, saluted them; but as he\ndid so, casting a parting glance around him, and perceiving M. Colbert\nin the center of a group, he said to the superintendent: \"Stay,\nmonsieur; there is some one under the trees yonder, who will be able to\ninform you better than myself.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Fouquet, whose near-sightedness prevented him from seeing\nthrough the darkness.\n\n\"M. Colbert,\" returned the chevalier.\n\n\"Indeed! That person, then, who is speaking yonder to those men with\ntorches in their hands, is M. Colbert?\"\n\n\"M. Colbert himself. He is giving orders personally to the workmen who\nare arranging the lamps for the illuminations.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Fouquet, with an inclination of the head, which\nindicated that he had obtained all the information he wished. The\nchevalier, on his side, having, on the contrary, learned nothing at all,\nwithdrew with a profound salutation.\n\nHe had scarcely left when Fouquet, knitting his brows, fell into a deep\nreverie. Aramis looked at him for a moment with a mingled feeling of\ncompassion and silence.\n\n\"What!\" he said to him, \"the fellow's name alone seemed to affect you.\nIs it possible that, full of triumph and delight as you were just now,\nthe sight merely of that man is capable of dispiriting you? Tell me,\nhave you faith in your good star?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Fouquet, dejectedly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I am too full of happiness at this present moment,\" he replied,\nin a trembling voice. \"You, my dear D'Herblay, who are so learned, will\nremember the history of a certain tyrant of Samos. What can I throw into\nthe sea to avert approaching evil? Yes! I repeat it once more, I am\ntoo full of happiness! so happy that I wish for nothing beyond what I\nhave... I have risen so high... You know my motto: '_Quo non ascendam?_'\nI have risen so high that nothing is left me but to descend from my\nelevation. I cannot believe in the progress of a success already more\nthan human.\"\n\nAramis smiled as he fixed his kind and penetrating glance upon him.\n\"If I were aware of the cause of your happiness,\" he said, \"I should\nprobably fear for your grace; but you regard me in the light of a true\nfriend; I mean, you turn to me in misfortune, nothing more. Even that\nis an immense and precious boon, I know; but the truth is, I have a\njust right to beg you to confide in me, from time to time, any fortunate\ncircumstances that befall you, in which I should rejoice, you know, more\nthan if they had befallen myself.\"\n\n\"My dear prelate,\" said Fouquet, laughing, \"my secrets are of too\nprofane a character to confide them to a bishop, however great a\nworldling he may be.\"\n\n\"Bah! in confession.\"\n\n\"Oh! I should blush too much if you were my confessor.\" And Fouquet\nbegan to sigh. Aramis again looked at him without further betrayal of\nhis thoughts than a placid smile.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"discretion is a great virtue.\"\n\n\"Silence,\" said Fouquet; \"yonder venomous reptile has recognized us, and\nis crawling this way.\"\n\n\"Colbert?\"\n\n\"Yes; leave me, D'Herblay; I do not wish that fellow to see you with me,\nor he will take an aversion to _you_.\"\n\nAramis pressed his hand, saying, \"What need have I of his friendship,\nwhile you are here?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I may not always be here,\" replied Fouquet, dejectedly.\n\n\"On that day, then, if that day should ever dawn,\" said Aramis,\ntranquilly, \"we will think over a means of dispensing with the\nfriendship, or of braving the dislike of M. Colbert. But tell me, my\ndear Fouquet, instead of conversing with this reptile, as you did him\nthe honor of styling him, a conversation the need for which I do not\nperceive, why do you not pay a visit, if not to the king, at least to\nMadame?\"\n\n\"To Madame,\" said the superintendent, his mind occupied by his\n_souvenirs_. \"Yes, certainly, to Madame.\"\n\n\"You remember,\" continued Aramis, \"that we have been told that Madame\nstands high in favor during the last two or three days. It enters into\nyour policy, and forms part of our plans, that you should assiduously\ndevote yourself to his majesty's friends. It is a means of counteracting\nthe growing influence of M. Colbert. Present yourself, therefore, as\nsoon as possible to Madame, and, for our sakes, treat this ally with\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Fouquet, \"are you quite sure that it is upon her that the\nking has his eyes fixed at the present moment?\"\n\n\"If the needle has turned, it must be since the morning. You know I have\nmy police.\"\n\n\"Very well! I will go there at once, and, at all events, I shall have\na means of introduction in the shape of a magnificent pair of antique\ncameos set with diamonds.\"\n\n\"I have seen them, and nothing could be more costly and regal.\"\n\nAt this moment they were interrupted by a servant followed by a courier.\n\"For you, monseigneur,\" said the courier aloud, presenting a letter to\nFouquet.\n\n\"For your grace,\" said the lackey in a low tone, handing Aramis a\nletter. And as the lackey carried a torch in his hand, he placed himself\nbetween the superintendent and the bishop of Vannes, so that both of\nthem could read at the same time. As Fouquet looked at the fine and\ndelicate writing on the envelope, he started with delight. Those who\nlove, or who are beloved, will understand his anxiety in the first\nplace, and his happiness in the next. He hastily tore open the letter,\nwhich, however, contained only these words: \"It is but an hour since\nI quitted you, it is an age since I told you how much I love you.\" And\nthat was all. Madame de Belliere had, in fact, left Fouquet about an\nhour previously, after having passed two days with him; and apprehensive\nlest his remembrance of her might be effaced for too long a period from\nthe heart she regretted, she dispatched a courier to him as the bearer\nof this important communication. Fouquet kissed the letter, and rewarded\nthe bearer with a handful of gold. As for Aramis, he, on his side, was\nengaged in reading, but with more coolness and reflection, the following\nletter:\n\n\"The king has this evening been struck with a strange fancy; a woman\nloves him. He learned it accidentally, as he was listening to the\nconversation of this young girl with her companions; and his majesty\nhas entirely abandoned himself to his new caprice. The girl's name is\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, and she is sufficiently pretty to warrant\nthis caprice becoming a strong attachment. Beware of Mademoiselle de la\nValliere.\"\n\nThere was not a word about Madame. Aramis slowly folded the letter and\nput it in his pocket. Fouquet was still delightedly inhaling the perfume\nof his epistle.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Aramis, touching Fouquet's arm.\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"An idea has just occurred to me. Are you acquainted with a young girl\nof the name of La Valliere?\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Reflect a little.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, I believe so; one of Madame's maids of honor.\"\n\n\"That must be the one.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"Well, monseigneur, it is to that young girl that you must pay your\nvisit this evening.\"\n\n\"Bah! why so?\"\n\n\"Nay, more than that, it is to her you must present your cameos.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"You know, monseigneur, that my advice is not to be regarded lightly.\"\n\n\"But this is unforeseen--\"\n\n\"That is my affair. Pay your court in due form, and without loss of\ntime, to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. I will be your guarantee with\nMadame de Belliere that your devotion is altogether politic.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, my dear D'Herblay, and whose name have you just\npronounced?\"\n\n\"A name which ought to convince you that, as I am so well informed about\nyourself, I may possibly be just as well informed about others. Pay your\ncourt, therefore, to La Valliere.\"\n\n\"I will pay my court to whomsoever you like,\" replied Fouquet, his heart\nfilled with happiness.\n\n\"Come, come, descend again to the earth, traveler in the seventh\nheaven,\" said Aramis; \"M. Colbert is approaching. He has been\nrecruiting while we were reading; see, how he is surrounded, praised,\ncongratulated; he is decidedly becoming powerful.\" In fact, Colbert was\nadvancing, escorted by all the courtiers who remained in the gardens,\nevery one of whom complimented him upon the arrangements of the _fete_:\nall of which so puffed him up that he could hardly contain himself.\n\n\"If La Fontaine were here,\" said Fouquet, smiling, \"what an admirable\nopportunity for him to recite his fable of 'The Frog that wanted to make\nitself as big as the Ox.'\"\n\nColbert arrived in the center of the circle blazing with light; Fouquet\nawaited his approach, unmoved and with a slightly mocking smile. Colbert\nsmiled too; he had been observing his enemy during the last quarter of\nan hour, and had been approaching him gradually. Colbert's smile was a\npresage of hostility.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Aramis, in a low tone of voice to the superintendent;\n\"the scoundrel is going to ask you again for more millions to pay for\nhis fireworks and his colored lamps.\" Colbert was the first to salute\nthem, and with an air which he endeavored to render respectful. Fouquet\nhardly moved his head.\n\n\"Well, monseigneur, what do your eyes say? Have we shown our good\ntaste?\"\n\n\"Perfect taste,\" replied Fouquet, without permitting the slightest tone\nof raillery to be remarked in his words.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Colbert, maliciously, \"you are treating us with indulgence.\nWe are poor, we servants of the king, and Fontainebleau is no way to be\ncompared as a residence with Vaux.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" replied Fouquet coolly.\n\n\"But what can we do, monseigneur?\" continued Colbert, \"we have done our\nbest on slender resources.\"\n\nFouquet made a gesture of assent.\n\n\"But,\" pursued Colbert, \"it would be only a proper display of your\nmagnificence, monseigneur, if you were to offer to his majesty a _fete_\nin your wonderful gardens--in those gardens which have cost you sixty\nmillions of francs.\"\n\n\"Seventy-two,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"An additional reason,\" returned Colbert; \"it would, indeed, be truly\nmagnificent.\"\n\n\"But do you suppose, monsieur, that his majesty would deign to accept my\ninvitation?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt whatever of it,\" cried Colbert, hastily; \"I will\nguarantee that he does.\"\n\n\"You are exceedingly kind,\" said Fouquet. \"I may depend on it, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Then I will consider the matter,\" yawned Fouquet.\n\n\"Accept, accept,\" whispered Aramis, eagerly.\n\n\"You will consider?\" repeated Colbert.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Fouquet; \"in order to know what day I shall submit my\ninvitation to the king.\"\n\n\"This very evening, monseigneur, this very evening.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said the superintendent. \"Gentlemen, I should wish to issue\nmy invitations; but you know that wherever the king goes, the king is\nin his own palace; it is by his majesty, therefore, that you must be\ninvited.\" A murmur of delight immediately arose. Fouquet bowed and left.\n\n\"Proud and dauntless man,\" thought Colbert, \"you accept, and yet you\nknow it will cost you ten millions.\"\n\n\"You have ruined me,\" whispered Fouquet, in a low tone, to Aramis.\n\n\"I have saved you,\" replied the latter, whilst Fouquet ascended the\nflight of steps and inquired whether the king was still visible.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVII. The Orderly Clerk.\n\nThe king, anxious to be again quite alone, in order to reflect well\nupon what was passing in his heart, had withdrawn to his own apartments,\nwhere M. de Saint-Aignan had, after his conversation with Madame, gone\nto meet him. This conversation has already been related. The favorite,\nvain of his twofold importance, and feeling that he had become, during\nthe last two hours, the confidant of the king, began to treat the\naffairs of the court in a somewhat indifferent manner: and, from the\nposition in which he had placed himself, or rather, where chance had\nplaced him, he saw nothing but love and garlands of flowers around him.\nThe king's love for Madame, that of Madame for the king, that of Guiche\nfor Madame, that of La Valliere for the king, that of Malicorne for\nMontalais, that of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente for himself, was\nnot all this, truly, more than enough to turn the head of any courtier?\nBesides, Saint-Aignan was the model of courtiers, past, present, and to\ncome; and, moreover, showed himself such an excellent narrator, and\nso discerningly appreciative that the king listened to him with an\nappearance of great interest, particularly when he described the excited\nmanner with which Madame had sought for him to converse about the affair\nof Mademoiselle de la Valliere. While the king no longer experienced for\nMadame any remains of the passion he had once felt for her, there was,\nin this same eagerness of Madame to procure information about him, great\ngratification for his vanity, from which he could not free himself. He\nexperienced this pleasure then, but nothing more, and his heart was not,\nfor a single moment, alarmed at what Madame might, or might not, think\nof his adventure. When, however, Saint-Aignan had finished, the king,\nwhile preparing to retire to rest, asked, \"Now, Saint-Aignan, you know\nwhat Mademoiselle de la Valliere is, do you not?\"\n\n\"Not only what she is, but what she will be.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that she is everything that woman can wish to be--that is to\nsay, beloved by your majesty; I mean, that she will be everything your\nmajesty may wish her to be.\"\n\n\"That is not what I am asking. I do not wish to know what she is to-day,\nor what she will be to-morrow; as you have remarked, that is my affair.\nBut tell me what others say of her.\"\n\n\"They say she is well conducted.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the king, smiling, \"that is mere report.\"\n\n\"But rare enough, at court, sire, to believe when it is spread.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right. Is she well born?\"\n\n\"Excellently; the daughter of the Marquis de la Valliere, and\nstep-daughter of that good M. de Saint-Remy.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! my aunt's major-domo; I remember; and I remember now that I\nsaw her as I passed through Blois. She was presented to the queens. I\nhave even to reproach myself that I did not on that occasion pay her the\nattention she deserved.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire! I trust that your majesty will now repair time lost.\"\n\n\"And the report--you tell me--is, that Mademoiselle de la Valliere never\nhad a lover.\"\n\n\"In any case, I do not think your majesty would be much alarmed at the\nrivalry.\"\n\n\"Yet, stay,\" said the king, in a very serious tone of voice.\n\n\"Your majesty?\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"If she has no lover, she has, at least, a betrothed.\"\n\n\"A betrothed!\"\n\n\"What! Count, do you not know that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You, the man who knows all the news?\"\n\n\"Your majesty will excuse me. You know this betrothed, then?\"\n\n\"Assuredly! his father came to ask me to sign the marriage contract: it\nis--\" The king was about to pronounce the Vicomte de Bragelonne's name,\nwhen he stopped, and knitted his brows.\n\n\"It is--\" repeated Saint-Aignan, inquiringly.\n\n\"I don't remember now,\" replied Louis XIV., endeavoring to conceal an\nannoyance he had some trouble to disguise.\n\n\"Can I put your majesty in the way?\" inquired the Comte de Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"No; for I no longer remember to whom I intended to refer; indeed, I\nonly remember very indistinctly, that one of the maids of honor was to\nmarry--the name, however, has escaped me.\"\n\n\"Was it Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente he was going to marry?\" inquired\nSaint-Aignan.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the king.\n\n\"In that case, the intended was M. de Montespan; but Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente did not speak of it, it seemed to me, in such a manner\nas would frighten suitors away.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said the king, \"I know nothing, or almost nothing,\nabout Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Saint-Aignan, I rely upon you to\nprocure me every information about her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, and when shall I have the honor of seeing your majesty\nagain, to give you the latest news?\"\n\n\"Whenever you have procured it.\"\n\n\"I shall obtain it speedily, then, if the information can be as quickly\nobtained as my wish to see your majesty again.\"\n\n\"Well said, count! By the by, has Madame displayed any ill-feeling\nagainst this poor girl?\"\n\n\"None, sire.\"\n\n\"Madame did not get angry, then?\"\n\n\"I do not know; I only know that she laughed continually.\"\n\n\"That's well; but I think I hear voices in the ante-rooms--no doubt a\ncourier has just arrived. Inquire, Saint-Aignan.\" The count ran to the\ndoor and exchanged a few words with the usher; he returned to the king,\nsaying, \"Sire, it is M. Fouquet who has this moment arrived, by your\nmajesty's orders, he says. He presented himself, but, because of the\nlateness of the hour, he does not press for an audience this evening,\nand is satisfied to have his presence here formally announced.\"\n\n\"M. Fouquet! I wrote to him at three o'clock, inviting him to be at\nFontainebleau the following day, and he arrives at Fontainebleau at\ntwo o'clock in the morning! This is, indeed, zeal!\" exclaimed the\nking, delighted to see himself so promptly obeyed. \"On the contrary, M.\nFouquet shall have his audience. I summoned him, and will receive him.\nLet him be introduced. As for you, count, pursue your inquiries, and be\nhere to-morrow.\"\n\nThe king placed his finger on his lips; and Saint-Aignan, his heart\nbrimful of happiness, hastily withdrew, telling the usher to introduce\nM. Fouquet, who, thereupon, entered the king's apartment. Louis rose to\nreceive him.\n\n\"Good evening, M. Fouquet,\" he said, smiling graciously; \"I congratulate\nyou on your punctuality; and yet my message must have reached you late?\"\n\n\"At nine in the evening, sire.\"\n\n\"You have been working very hard lately, M. Fouquet, for I have been\ninformed that you have not left your rooms at Saint-Mande during the\nlast three or four days.\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true, your majesty, that I have kept myself shut up for\nthe past three days,\" replied Fouquet.\n\n\"Do you know, M. Fouquet, that I had a great many things to say to you?\"\ncontinued the king, with a most gracious air.\n\n\"Your majesty overwhelms me, and since you are so graciously disposed\ntowards me, will you permit me to remind you of the promise made to\ngrant an audience?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! some church dignitary, who thinks he has to thank me for\nsomething, is it not?\"\n\n\"Precisely so, sire. The hour is, perhaps, badly chosen; but the time\nof the companion whom I have brought with me is valuable, and as\nFontainebleau is on the way to his diocese--\"\n\n\"Who is it, then?\"\n\n\"The bishop of Vannes, whose appointment your majesty, at my\nrecommendation, deigned, three months since, to sign.\"\n\n\"That is very possible,\" said the king, who had signed without reading;\n\"and he is here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire; Vannes is an important diocese; the flock belonging to this\npastor needed his religious consolation; they are savages, whom it is\nnecessary to polish, at the same time that he instructs them, and M.\nd'Herblay is unequalled in such kind of missions.\"\n\n\"M. d'Herblay!\" said the king, musingly, as if his name, heard long\nsince, was not, however, unknown to him.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Fouquet, promptly, \"your majesty is not acquainted with the\nobscure name of one of your most faithful and valuable servants?\"\n\n\"No, I confess I am not. And so he wishes to set off again?\"\n\n\"He has this very day received letters which will, perhaps, compel him\nto leave, so that, before setting off for that unknown region called\nBretagne, he is desirous of paying his respects to your majesty.\"\n\n\"Is he waiting?\"\n\n\"He is here, sire.\"\n\n\"Let him enter.\"\n\nFouquet made a sign to the usher in attendance, who was waiting behind\nthe tapestry. The door opened, and Aramis entered. The king allowed him\nto finish the compliments which he addressed to him, and fixed a long\nlook upon a countenance which no one could forget, after having once\nbeheld it.\n\n\"Vannes!\" he said: \"you are bishop of Vannes, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Vannes is in Bretagne, I think?\" Aramis bowed.\n\n\"Near the coast?\" Aramis again bowed.\n\n\"A few leagues from Bell-Isle, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Aramis; \"six leagues, I believe.\"\n\n\"Six leagues; a mere step, then,\" said Louis XIV.\n\n\"Not for us poor Bretons, sire,\" replied Aramis: \"six leagues, on the\ncontrary, is a great distance, if it be six leagues on land; and an\nimmense distance, if it be leagues on the sea. Besides, I have the honor\nto mention to your majesty that there are six leagues of sea from the\nriver to Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"It is said that M. Fouquet has a very beautiful house there?\" inquired\nthe king.\n\n\"Yes, it is said so,\" replied Aramis, looking quietly at Fouquet.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'it is said so?'\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"He has, sire.\"\n\n\"Really, M. Fouquet, I must confess that one circumstance surprises me.\"\n\n\"What may that be, sire?\"\n\n\"That you should have at the head of the diocese a man like M.\nd'Herblay, and yet should not have shown him Belle-Isle.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire,\" replied the bishop, without giving Fouquet time to answer,\n\"we poor Breton prelates seldom leave our residences.\"\n\n\"M. de Vannes,\" said the king, \"I will punish M. Fouquet for his\nindifference.\"\n\n\"In what way, sire?\"\n\n\"I will change your bishopric.\"\n\nFouquet bit his lips, but Aramis only smiled.\n\n\"What income does Vannes bring you in?\" continued the king.\n\n\"Sixty thousand livres, sire,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"So trifling an amount as that; but you possess other property, Monsieur\nde Vannes?\"\n\n\"I have nothing else, sire; only M. Fouquet pays me one thousand two\nhundred livres a year for his pew in the church.\"\n\n\"Well, M. d'Herblay, I promise you something better than that.\"\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"I will not forget you.\"\n\nAramis bowed, and the king also bowed to him in a respectful manner, as\nhe was accustomed to do towards women and members of the Church. Aramis\ngathered that his audience was at an end; he took his leave of the\nking in the simple, unpretending language of a country pastor, and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"He is, indeed, a remarkable face,\" said the king, following him with\nhis eyes as long as he could see him, and even to a certain degree when\nhe was no longer to be seen.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Fouquet, \"if that bishop had been educated early in\nlife, no prelate in the kingdom would deserve the highest distinctions\nbetter than he.\"\n\n\"His learning is not extensive, then?\"\n\n\"He changed the sword for the crucifix, and that rather late in life.\nBut it matters little, if your majesty will permit me to speak of M. de\nVannes again on another occasion--\"\n\n\"I beg you to do so. But before speaking of him, let us speak of\nyourself, M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"Of me, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have to pay you a thousand compliments.\"\n\n\"I cannot express to your majesty the delight with which you overwhelm\nme.\"\n\n\"I understand you, M. Fouquet. I confess, however, to have had certain\nprejudices against you.\"\n\n\"In that case, I was indeed unhappy, sire.\"\n\n\"But they exist no longer. Did you not perceive--\"\n\n\"I did, indeed, sire; but I awaited with resignation the day when the\ntruth would prevail; and it seems that that day has now arrived.\"\n\n\"Ah! you knew, then, you were in disgrace with me?\"\n\n\"Alas! sire, I perceived it.\"\n\n\"And do you know the reason?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well; your majesty thought that I had been wastefully lavish\nin expenditure.\"\n\n\"Not so; far from that.\"\n\n\"Or, rather an indifferent administrator. In a word, you thought\nthat, as the people had no money, there would be none for your majesty\neither.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought so; but I was deceived.\"\n\nFouquet bowed.\n\n\"And no disturbances, no complaints?\"\n\n\"And money enough,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"The fact is that you have been profuse with it during the last month.\"\n\n\"I have more, not only for all your majesty's requirements, but for all\nyour caprices.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Monsieur Fouquet,\" replied the king, seriously. \"I will\nnot put you to the proof. For the next two months I do not intend to ask\nyou for anything.\"\n\n\"I will avail myself of the interval to amass five or six millions,\nwhich will be serviceable as money in hand in case of war.\"\n\n\"Five or six millions!\"\n\n\"For the expenses of your majesty's household only, be it understood.\"\n\n\"You think war probable, M. Fouquet?\"\n\n\"I think that if Heaven has bestowed on the eagle a beak and claws, it\nis to enable him to show his royal character.\"\n\nThe king blushed with pleasure.\n\n\"We have spent a great deal of money these few days past, Monsieur\nFouquet; will you not scold me for it?\"\n\n\"Sire, your majesty has still twenty years of youth to enjoy, and a\nthousand million francs to lavish in those twenty years.\"\n\n\"That is a great deal of money, M. Fouquet,\" said the king.\n\n\"I will economize, sire. Besides, your majesty as two valuable servants\nin M. Colbert and myself. The one will encourage you to be prodigal with\nyour treasures--and this shall be myself, if my services should continue\nto be agreeable to your majesty; and the other will economize money for\nyou, and this will be M. Colbert's province.\"\n\n\"M. Colbert?\" returned the king, astonished.\n\n\"Certainly, sire; M. Colbert is an excellent accountant.\"\n\nAt this commendation, bestowed by the traduced on the traducer, the king\nfelt himself penetrated with confidence and admiration. There was not,\nmoreover, either in Fouquet's voice or look, anything which injuriously\naffected a single syllable of the remark he had made; he did not pass\none eulogium, as it were, in order to acquire the right of making\ntwo reproaches. The king comprehended him, and yielding to so much\ngenerosity and address, he said, \"You praise M. Colbert, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire, I praise him; for, besides being a man of merit, I believe\nhim to be devoted to your majesty's interests.\"\n\n\"Is that because he has often interfered with your own views?\" said the\nking, smiling.\n\n\"Exactly, sire.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"It is simple enough. I am the man who is needed to make the money come\nin; he is the man who is needed to prevent it leaving.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, monsieur le surintendant, you will presently say something\nwhich will correct this good opinion.\"\n\n\"Do you mean as far as administrative abilities are concerned, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, sire, I do not know throughout France a better clerk\nthan M. Colbert.\"\n\nThis word \"clerk\" did not possess, in 1661, the somewhat subservient\nsignification attached to it in the present day; but, as spoken by\nFouquet, whom the king had addressed as the superintendent, it seemed\nto acquire an insignificant and petty character, that at this juncture\nserved admirably to restore Fouquet to his place, and Colbert to his\nown.\n\n\"And yet,\" said Louis XIV., \"it was Colbert, however, that,\nnotwithstanding his economy, had the arrangement of my _fetes_ here at\nFontainebleau; and I assure you, Monsieur Fouquet, that in no way has\nhe checked the expenditure of money.\" Fouquet bowed, but did not reply.\n\n\"Is it not your opinion too?\" said the king.\n\n\"I think, sire,\" he replied, \"that M. Colbert has done what he had to do\nin an exceedingly orderly manner, and that he deserves, in this respect,\nall the praise your majesty may bestow upon him.\"\n\nThe word \"orderly\" was a proper accompaniment for the word \"clerk.\" The\nking possessed that extreme sensitiveness of organization, that delicacy\nof perception, which pierced through and detected the regular order of\nfeelings and sensations, before the actual sensations themselves, and\nhe therefore comprehended that the clerk had, in Fouquet's opinion, been\ntoo full of method and order in his arrangements; in other words, that\nthe magnificent _fetes_ of Fontainebleau might have been rendered more\nmagnificent still. The king consequently felt that there was something\nin the amusements he had provided with which some person or another\nmight be able to find fault; he experienced a little of the annoyance\nfelt by a person coming from the provinces to Paris, dressed out in the\nvery best clothes which his wardrobe can furnish, only to find that\nthe fashionably dressed man there looks at him either too much or not\nenough. This part of the conversation, which Fouquet had carried on with\nso much moderation, yet with extreme tact, inspired the king with the\nhighest esteem for the character of the man and the capacity of the\nminister. Fouquet took his leave at a quarter to three in the morning,\nand the king went to bed a little uneasy and confused at the indirect\nlesson he had received; and a good hour was employed by him in going\nover again in memory the embroideries, the tapestries, the bills of fare\nof the various banquets, the architecture of the triumphal arches, the\narrangements for the illuminations and fireworks, all the offspring\nof the \"Clerk Colbert's\" invention. The result was, the king passed in\nreview before him everything that had taken place during the last\neight days, and decided that faults could be found in his _fetes_.\nBut Fouquet, by his politeness, his thoughtful consideration, and his\ngenerosity, had injured Colbert more deeply than the latter, by his\nartifice, his ill-will, and his persevering hatred, had ever yet\nsucceeded in hurting Fouquet.\n\n\n\nChapter XLVIII. Fontainebleau at Two o'Clock in the Morning.\n\nAs we have seen, Saint-Aignan had quitted the king's apartment at the\nvery moment the superintendent entered it. Saint-Aignan was charged with\na mission that required dispatch, and he was going to do his utmost to\nturn his time to the best advantage. He whom we have introduced as the\nking's friend was indeed an uncommon personage; he was one of those\nvaluable courtiers whose vigilance and acuteness of perception threw\nall other favorites into the shade, and counterbalanced, by his close\nattention, the servility of Dangeau, who was not the favorite, but the\ntoady of the king. M. de Saint-Aignan began to think what was to be\ndone in the present position of affairs. He reflected that his first\ninformation ought to come from De Guiche. He therefore set out in search\nof him, but De Guiche, whom we saw disappear behind one of the wings,\nand who seemed to have returned to his own apartments, had not entered\nthe chateau. Saint-Aignan therefore went in quest of him, and after\nhaving turned, and twisted, and searched in every direction, he\nperceived something like a human form leaning against a tree. This\nfigure was as motionless as a statue, and seemed deeply engaged in\nlooking at a window, although its curtains were closely drawn. As this\nwindow happened to be Madame's, Saint-Aignan concluded that the form in\nquestion must be that of De Guiche. He advanced cautiously, and found\nhe was not mistaken. De Guiche had, after his conversation with Madame,\ncarried away such a weight of happiness, that all of his strength of\nmind was hardly sufficient to enable him to support it. On his side,\nSaint-Aignan knew that De Guiche had had something to do with La\nValliere's introduction to Madame's household, for a courtier knows\neverything and forgets nothing; but he had never learned under what\ntitle or conditions De Guiche had conferred his protection upon La\nValliere. But, as in asking a great many questions it is singular if a\nman does not learn something, Saint-Aignan reckoned upon learning much\nor little, as the case might be, if he questioned De Guiche with that\nextreme tact, and, at the same time, with that persistence in attaining\nan object, of which he was capable. Saint-Aignan's plan was as follows:\nIf the information obtained was satisfactory, he would inform the king,\nwith alacrity, that he had lighted upon a pearl, and claim the privilege\nof setting the pearl in question in the royal crown. If the information\nwere unsatisfactory,--which, after all, might be possible,--he would\nexamine how far the king cared about La Valliere, and make use of his\ninformation in such a manner as to get rid of the girl altogether, and\nthereby obtain all the merit of her banishment with all the ladies of\nthe court who might have the least pretensions to the king's heart,\nbeginning with Madame and finishing with the queen. In case the king\nshould show himself obstinate in his fancy, then he would not produce\nthe damaging information he had obtained, but would let La Valliere\nknow that this damaging information was carefully preserved in a secret\ndrawer of her confidant's memory. In this manner, he would be able\nto air his generosity before the poor girl's eyes, and so keep her in\nconstant suspense between gratitude and apprehension, to such an extent\nas to make her a friend at court, interested, as an accomplice, in\ntrying to make his fortune, while she was making her own. As far as\nconcerned the day when the bombshell of the past should burst, if ever\nthere were any occasion, Saint-Aignan promised himself that he would\nby that time have taken all possible precautions, and would pretend an\nentire ignorance of the matter to the king; while, with regard to La\nValliere, he would still have an opportunity of being considered the\npersonification of generosity. It was with such ideas as these, which\nthe fire of covetousness had caused to dawn in half an hour, that\nSaint-Aignan, the son of earth, as La Fontaine would have said,\ndetermined to get De Guiche into conversation: in other words, to\ntrouble him in his happiness--a happiness of which Saint-Aignan was\nquite ignorant. It was long past one o'clock in the morning when\nSaint-Aignan perceived De Guiche, standing, motionless, leaning\nagainst the trunk of a tree, with his eyes fastened upon the lighted\nwindow,--the sleepiest hour of night-time, which painters crown with\nmyrtles and budding poppies, the hour when eyes are heavy, hearts throb,\nand heads feel dull and languid--an hour which casts upon the day which\nhas passed away a look of regret, while addressing a loving greeting\nto the dawning light. For De Guiche it was the dawn of unutterable\nhappiness; he would have bestowed a treasure upon a beggar, had one\nstood before him, to secure him uninterrupted indulgence in his\ndreams. It was precisely at this hour that Saint-Aignan, badly\nadvised,--selfishness always counsels badly,--came and struck him on the\nshoulder, at the very moment he was murmuring a word, or rather a name.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried loudly, \"I was looking for you.\"\n\n\"For me?\" said De Guiche, starting.\n\n\"Yes; and I find you seemingly moon-struck. Is it likely, my dear comte,\nyou have been attacked by a poetical malady, and are making verses?\"\n\nThe young man forced a smile upon his lips, while a thousand conflicting\nsensations were muttering defiance of Saint-Aignan in the deep recesses\nof his heart. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"But by what happy chance--\"\n\n\"Ah! your remark shows that you did not hear what I said.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Why, I began by telling you I was looking for you.\"\n\n\"You were looking for me?\"\n\n\"Yes: and I find you now in the very act.\"\n\n\"Of doing what, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"Of singing the praises of Phyllis.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not deny it,\" said De Guiche, laughing. \"Yes, my dear comte,\nI was celebrating Phyllis's praises.\"\n\n\"And you have acquired the right to do so.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"You; no doubt of it. You; the intrepid protector of every beautiful and\nclever woman.\"\n\n\"In the name of goodness, what story have you got hold of now?\"\n\n\"Acknowledged truths, I am well aware. But stay a moment; I am in love.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So much the better, my dear comte; tell me all about it.\" And De\nGuiche, afraid that Saint-Aignan might perhaps presently observe the\nwindow, where the light was still burning, took the comte's arm and\nendeavored to lead him away.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the latter, resisting, \"do not take me towards those dark\nwoods, it is too damp there. Let us stay in the moonlight.\" And while\nhe yielded to the pressure of De Guiche's arm, he remained in the\nflower-garden adjoining the chateau.\n\n\"Well,\" said De Guiche, resigning himself, \"lead me where you like, and\nask me what you please.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to be more agreeable than you are.\" And then, after\na moment's silence, Saint-Aignan continued, \"I wish you to tell me\nsomething about a certain person in who you have interested yourself.\"\n\n\"And with whom you are in love?\"\n\n\"I will neither admit nor deny it. You understand that a man does not\nvery readily place his heart where there is no hope of return, and that\nit is most essential he should take measures of security in advance.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said De Guiche with a sigh; \"a man's heart is a very\nprecious gift.\"\n\n\"Mine particularly is very tender, and in that light I present it to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are well known, comte. Well?\"\n\n\"It is simply a question of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear Saint-Aignan, you are losing your senses, I should think.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"I have never shown or taken any interest in Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Did you not obtain admission for Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente into\nMadame's household?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente--and you ought to know it better than\nany one else, my dear comte--is of a sufficiently good family to make\nher presence here desirable, and her admittance very easy.\"\n\n\"You are jesting.\"\n\n\"No; and upon my honor I do not know what you mean.\"\n\n\"And you had nothing, then, to do with her admission?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You do not know her?\"\n\n\"I saw her for the first time the day she was presented to Madame.\nTherefore, as I have never taken any interest in her, as I do not know\nher, I am not able to give you the information you require.\" And De\nGuiche made a movement as though he were about to leave his questioner.\n\n\"Nay, nay, one moment, my dear comte,\" said Saint-Aignan; \"you shall not\nescape me in this manner.\"\n\n\"Why, really, it seems to me that it is now time to return to our\napartments.\"\n\n\"And yet you were not going in when I--did not meet, but found you.\"\n\n\"Therefore, my dear comte,\" said De Guiche, \"as long as you have\nanything to say to me, I place myself entirely at your service.\"\n\n\"And you are quite right in doing so. What matters half an hour more or\nless? Will you swear that you have no injurious communications to\nmake to me about her, and that any injurious communications you might\npossibly have to make are not the cause of your silence?\"\n\n\"Oh! I believe the poor child to be as pure as crystal.\"\n\n\"You overwhelm me with joy. And yet I do not wish to have towards you\nthe appearance of a man so badly informed as I seem. It is quite certain\nthat you supplied the princess's household with the ladies of honor.\nNay, a song has even been written about it.\"\n\n\"Oh! songs are written about everything.\"\n\n\"Do you know it?\"\n\n\"No: sing it to me and I shall make its acquaintance.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you how it begins; I only remember how it ends.\"\n\n\"Very well, at all events, that is something.\"\n\n\"When Maids of Honor happen to run short, Lo!--Guiche will furnish the\nentire Court.\"\n\n\"The idea is weak, and the rhyme poor,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"What can you expect, my dear fellow? it is not Racine's or Moliere's,\nbut La Feuillade's; and a great lord cannot rhyme like a beggarly poet.\"\n\n\"It is very unfortunate, though, that you only remember the\ntermination.\"\n\n\"Stay, stay, I have just recollected the beginning of the second\ncouplet.\"\n\n\"Why, there's the birdcage, with a pretty pair, The charming Montalais,\nand...\"\n\n\"And La Valliere,\" exclaimed Guiche, impatiently, and completely\nignorant besides of Saint-Aignan's object.\n\n\"Yes, yes, you have it. You have hit upon the word, 'La Valliere.'\"\n\n\"A grand discovery indeed.\"\n\n\"Montalais and La Valliere, these, then, are the two young girls in whom\nyou interest yourself,\" said Saint-Aignan, laughing.\n\n\"And so Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente's name is not to be met with in\nthe song?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"And are you satisfied, then?\"\n\n\"Perfectly; but I find Montalais there,\" said Saint-Aignan, still\nlaughing.\n\n\"Oh! you will find her everywhere. She is a singularly active young\nlady.\"\n\n\"You know her?\"\n\n\"Indirectly. She was the _protegee_ of a man named Malicorne, who is a\n_protegee_ of Manicamp's; Manicamp asked me to get the situation of\nmaid of honor for Montalais in Madame's household, and a situation for\nMalicorne as an officer in Monsieur's household. Well, I asked for the\nappointments, for you know very well that I have a weakness for that\ndroll fellow Manicamp.\"\n\n\"And you obtained what you sought?\"\n\n\"For Montalais, yes; for Malicorne, yes and no; for as yet he is only on\ntrial. Do you wish to know anything else?\"\n\n\"The last word of the couplet still remains, La Valliere,\" said\nSaint-Aignan, resuming the smile that so tormented Guiche.\n\n\"Well,\" said the latter, \"it is true that I obtained admission for her\nin Madame's household.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"But,\" continued Guiche, assuming a great coldness of manner, \"you will\noblige me, comte, not to jest about that name. Mademoiselle la Baume le\nBlanc de la Valliere is a young lady perfectly well-conducted.\"\n\n\"Perfectly well-conducted do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you have not heard the last rumor?\" exclaimed Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"No, and you will do me a service, my dear comte, in keeping this report\nto yourself and to those who circulate it.\"\n\n\"Ah! bah! you take the matter up very seriously.\"\n\n\"Yes; Mademoiselle de Valliere is beloved by one of my best friends.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan started. \"Aha!\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, comte,\" continued Guiche; \"and consequently, you, the most\ndistinguished man in France for polished courtesy of manner, will\nunderstand that I cannot allow my friend to be placed in a ridiculous\nposition.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan began to bite his nails, partially from vexation, and\npartially from disappointed curiosity. Guiche made him a very profound\nbow.\n\n\"You send me away,\" said Saint-Aignan, who was dying to know the name of\nthe friend.\n\n\"I do not send you away, my dear fellow. I am going to finish my lines\nto Phyllis.\"\n\n\"And those lines--\"\n\n\"Are a _quatrain_. You understand, I trust, that a _quatrain_ is a\nserious affair?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And as, of these four lines, of which it is composed, I have yet three\nand a half to make, I need my undivided attention.\"\n\n\"I quite understand. Adieu! comte. By the by--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Are you quick at making verses?\"\n\n\"Wonderfully so.\"\n\n\"Will you have quite finished the three lines and a half to-morrow\nmorning?\"\n\n\"I _hope_ so.\"\n\n\"Adieu, then, until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Adieu, adieu!\"\n\nSaint-Aignan was obliged to accept the notice to quit; he accordingly\ndid so, and disappeared behind the hedge. Their conversation had led\nGuiche and Saint-Aignan a good distance from the chateau.\n\nEvery mathematician, every poet, and every dreamer has his own subjects\nof interest. Saint-Aignan, on leaving Guiche, found himself at the\nextremity of the grove,--at the very spot where the outbuildings of\nthe servants begin, and where, behind the thickets of acacias and\nchestnut-trees interlacing their branches, which were hidden by masses\nof clematis and young vines, the wall which separated the woods from\nthe courtyard was erected. Saint-Aignan, alone, took the path which led\ntowards these buildings; De Guiche going off in the opposite direction.\nThe one proceeded to the flower-garden, while the other bent his steps\ntowards the walls. Saint-Aignan walked on between rows of mountain-ash,\nlilac, and hawthorn, which formed an almost impenetrable roof above his\nhead; his feet were buried in the soft gravel and thick moss. He was\ndeliberating a means of taking his revenge, which seemed difficult for\nhim to carry out, and was vexed with himself for not having learned\nmore about La Valliere, notwithstanding the ingenious measures he\nhad resorted to in order to acquire more information about her, when\nsuddenly the murmur of a human voice attracted his attention. He\nheard whispers, the complaining tones of a woman's voice mingled with\nentreaties, smothered laughter, sighs, and half-stilted exclamations of\nsurprise; but above them all, the woman's voice prevailed. Saint-Aignan\nstopped to look about him; he perceived from the greatest surprise that\nthe voices proceeded, not from the ground, but from the branches of the\ntrees. As he glided along under the covered walk, he raised his head,\nand observed at the top of the wall a woman perched upon a ladder, in\neager conversation with a man seated on a branch of a chestnut-tree,\nwhose head alone could be seen, the rest of his body being concealed in\nthe thick covert of the chestnut. [5]\n\n\n\nChapter XLIX. The Labyrinth.\n\nSaint-Aignan, who had only been seeking for information, had met with an\nadventure. This was indeed a piece of good luck. Curious to learn why,\nand particularly what about, this man and woman were conversing at such\nan hour, and in such a singular position, Saint-Aignan made himself as\nsmall as he possibly could, and approached almost under the rounds\nof the ladder. And taking measures to make himself as comfortable as\npossible, he leaned his back against a tree and listened, and heard the\nfollowing conversation. The woman was the first to speak.\n\n\"Really, Monsieur Manicamp,\" she said, in a voice which, notwithstanding\nthe reproaches she addressed to him, preserved a marked tone of\ncoquetry, \"really your indiscretion is of a very dangerous character. We\ncannot talk long in this manner without being observed.\"\n\n\"That is very probable,\" said the man, in the calmest and coolest of\ntones.\n\n\"In that case, then, what would people say? Oh! if any one were to see\nme, I declare I should die of very shame.\"\n\n\"Oh! that would be very silly; I do not believe you would.\"\n\n\"It might have been different if there had been anything between us; but\nto injure myself gratuitously is really very foolish of me; so, adieu,\nMonsieur Manicamp.\"\n\n\"So far so good; I know the man, and now let me see who the woman is,\"\nsaid Saint-Aignan, watching the rounds of the ladder, on which were\nstanding two pretty little feet covered with blue satin shoes.\n\n\"Nay, nay, for pity's sake, my dear Montalais,\" cried Manicamp, \"deuce\ntake it, do not go away; I have a great many things to say to you, of\nthe greatest importance, still.\"\n\n\"Montalais,\" said Saint-Aignan to himself, \"one of the three. Each of\nthe three gossips had her adventure, only I imagined the hero of this\none's adventure was Malicorne and not Manicamp.\"\n\nAt her companion's appeal, Montalais stopped in the middle of her\ndescent, and Saint-Aignan could observe the unfortunate Manicamp climb\nfrom one branch of the chestnut-tree to another, either to improve his\nsituation or to overcome the fatigue consequent upon his inconvenient\nposition.\n\n\"Now, listen to me,\" said he; \"you quite understand, I hope, that my\nintentions are perfectly innocent?\"\n\n\"Of course. But why did you write me a letter stimulating my gratitude\ntowards you? Why did you ask me for an interview at such an hour and in\nsuch a place as this?\"\n\n\"I stimulated your gratitude in reminding you that it was I who had been\nthe means of your becoming attached to Madame's household; because most\nanxiously desirous of obtaining the interview you have been kind enough\nto grant me, I employed the means which appeared to me most certain to\ninsure it. And my reason for soliciting it, at such an hour and in such\na locality, was, that the hour seemed to me to be the most prudent, and\nthe locality the least open to observation. Moreover, I had occasion\nto speak to you upon certain subjects which require both prudence and\nsolitude.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Manicamp!\"\n\n\"But everything I wish to say is perfectly honorable, I assure you.\"\n\n\"I think, Monsieur Manicamp, it will be more becoming in me to take my\nleave.\"\n\n\"No, no!--listen to me, or I will jump from my perch here to yours;\nand be careful how you set me at defiance, for a branch of this\nchestnut-tree causes me a good deal of annoyance, and may provoke me to\nextreme measures. Do not follow the example of this branch, then, but\nlisten to me.\"\n\n\"I am listening, and I agree to do so; but be as brief as possible, for\nif you have a branch of the chestnut-tree which annoys you, I wish you\nto understand that one of the rounds of the ladder is hurting the soles\nof my feet, and my shoes are being cut through.\"\n\n\"Do me the kindness to give me your hand.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Will you have the goodness to do so?\"\n\n\"There is my hand, then; but what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"To draw you towards me.\"\n\n\"What for? You surely do not wish me to join you in the tree?\"\n\n\"No; but I wish you to sit down upon the wall; there, that will do;\nthere is quite room enough, and I would give a great deal to be allowed\nto sit down beside you.\"\n\n\"No, no; you are very well where you are; we should be seen.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" said Manicamp, in an insinuating voice.\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Very well, I remain in my tree, then, although I cannot be worse\nplaced.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Manicamp, we are wandering away from the subject.\"\n\n\"You are right, we are so.\"\n\n\"You wrote me a letter?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Why did you write?\"\n\n\"Fancy, at two o'clock to-day, De Guiche left.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Seeing him set off, I followed him, as I usually do.\"\n\n\"Of course, I see that, since you are here now.\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry. You are aware, I suppose, that De Guiche is up to\nhis very neck in disgrace?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes.\"\n\n\"It was the very height of imprudence on his part, then, to come to\nFontainebleau to seek those who had at Paris sent him away into exile,\nand particularly those from whom he had been separated.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Manicamp, you reason like Pythagoras.\"\n\n\"Moreover, De Guiche is as obstinate as a man in love can be, and he\nrefused to listen to any of my remonstrances. I begged, I implored him,\nbut he would not listen to anything. Oh, the deuce!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle Montalais, but this confounded branch,\nabout which I have already had the honor of speaking to you, has just\ntorn a certain portion of my dress.\"\n\n\"It is quite dark,\" replied Montalais, laughing; \"so, pray continue, M.\nManicamp.\"\n\n\"De Guiche set off on horseback as hard as he could, I following him,\nat a slower pace. You quite understand that to throw one's self into\nthe water, for instance, with a friend, at the same headlong rate as he\nhimself would do it, would be the act either of a fool or a madman. I\ntherefore allowed De Guiche to get in advance, and I proceeded on my\nway with a commendable slowness of pace, feeling quite sure that my\nunfortunate friend would not be received, or, if he had been, that he\nwould ride off again at the very first cross, disagreeable answer;\nand that I should see him returning much faster than he went, without\nhaving, myself, gone much farther than Ris or Melun--and that even was a\ngood distance you will admit, for it is eleven leagues to get there and\nas many to return.\"\n\nMontalais shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Laugh as much as you like; but if, instead of being comfortably seated\non the top of the wall as you are, you were sitting on this branch as if\nyou were on horseback, you would, like Augustus, aspire to descend.\"\n\n\"Be patient, my dear M. Manicamp; a few minutes will soon pass away; you\nwere saying, I think, that you had gone beyond Ris and Melun.\"\n\n\"Yes, I went through Ris and Melun, and I continued to go on, more\nand more surprised that I did not see him returning; and here I am at\nFontainebleau; I look for and inquire after De Guiche everywhere, but\nno one has seen him, no one in the town has spoken to him; he arrived\nriding at full gallop, he entered the chateau; and there he has\ndisappeared. I have been here at Fontainebleau since eight o'clock this\nevening inquiring for De Guiche in every direction, but no De Guiche\ncan be found. I am dying with uneasiness. You understand that I have not\nbeen running my head into the lion's den, in entering the chateau, as my\nimprudent friend has done; I came at once to the servants' offices, and\nI succeeded in getting a letter conveyed to you; and now, for Heaven's\nsake, my dear young lady, relieve me from my anxiety.\"\n\n\"There will be no difficulty in that, my dear M. Manicamp; your friend\nDe Guiche has been admirably received.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"The king made quite a fuss over him.\"\n\n\"The king, who exiled him!\"\n\n\"Madame smiled upon him, and Monsieur appears to like him better than\never.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Manicamp, \"that explains to me, then, why and how he has\nremained. And did he not say anything about me?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"That is very unkind. What is he doing now?\"\n\n\"In all probability he is asleep, or, if not asleep, dreaming.\"\n\n\"And what have they been doing all the evening?\"\n\n\"Dancing.\"\n\n\"The famous ballet? How did De Guiche look?\"\n\n\"Superb!\"\n\n\"Dear fellow! And now, pray forgive me, Mademoiselle Montalais; but all\nI now have to do is pass from where I now am to your apartment.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I cannot suppose that the door of the chateau will be opened for me at\nthis hour; and as for spending the night upon this branch, I possibly\nmight not object to do so, but I declare it is impossible for any other\nanimal than a boa-constrictor to do it.\"\n\n\"But, M. Manicamp, I cannot introduce a man over the wall in that\nmanner.\"\n\n\"Two, if you please,\" said a second voice, but in so timid a tone that\nit seemed as if its owner felt the utter impropriety of such a request.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Montalais, \"who is that speaking to me?\"\n\n\"Malicorne, Mademoiselle Montalais.\"\n\nAnd as Malicorne spoke, he raised himself from the ground to the lowest\nbranches, and thence to the height of the wall.\n\n\"Monsieur Malicorne! why, you are both mad!\"\n\n\"How do you do, Mademoiselle Montalais?\" inquired Malicorne.\n\n\"I needed but this!\" said Montalais, in despair.\n\n\"Oh! Mademoiselle Montalais,\" murmured Malicorne; \"do not be so severe,\nI beseech you.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Manicamp, \"we are your friends, and you cannot possibly\nwish your friends to lose their lives; and to leave us to pass the night\non these branches is in fact condemning us to death.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Montalais, \"Monsieur Malicorne is so robust that a night\npassed in the open air with the beautiful stars above him will not do\nhim any harm, and it will be a just punishment for the trick he has\nplayed me.\"\n\n\"Be it so, then; let Malicorne arrange matters with you in the best way\nhe can; I pass over,\" said Manicamp. And bending down the famous branch\nagainst which he had directed such bitter complaints, he succeeded, by\nthe assistance of his hands and feet, in seating himself side by side\nwith Montalais, who tried to push him back, while he endeavored to\nmaintain his position, and, moreover, he succeeded. Having taken\npossession of the ladder, he stepped on it, and then gallantly offered\nhis hand to his fair antagonist. While this was going on, Malicorne had\ninstalled himself in the chestnut-tree, in the very place Manicamp had\njust left, determining within himself to succeed him in the one he now\noccupied. Manicamp and Montalais descended a few rounds of the ladder,\nManicamp insisting, and Montalais laughing and objecting.\n\nSuddenly Malicorne's voice was heard in tones of entreaty:\n\n\"I entreat you, Mademoiselle Montalais, not to leave me here. My\nposition is very insecure, and some accident will be certain to befall\nme, if I attempt unaided to reach the other side of the wall; it does\nnot matter if Manicamp tears his clothes, for he can make use of M. de\nGuiche's wardrobe; but I shall not be able to use even those belonging\nto M. Manicamp, for they will be torn.\"\n\n\"My opinion,\" said Manicamp, without taking any notice of Malicorne's\nlamentations, \"is that the best thing to be done is to go and look for\nDe Guiche without delay, for, by and by, perhaps, I may not be able to\nget to his apartments.\"\n\n\"That is my own opinion, too,\" replied Montalais; \"so, go at once,\nMonsieur Manicamp.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks. Adieu Mademoiselle Montalais,\" said Manicamp,\njumping to the ground; \"your condescension cannot be repaid.\"\n\n\"Farewell, M. Manicamp; I am now going to get rid of M. Malicorne.\"\n\nMalicorne sighed. Manicamp went away a few paces, but returning to the\nfoot of the ladder, he said, \"By the by, how do I get to M. de Guiche's\napartments?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier. You go along by the hedge until you reach a place where\nthe paths cross.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You will see four paths.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"One of which you will take.\"\n\n\"Which of them?\"\n\n\"That to the right.\"\n\n\"That to the right?\"\n\n\"No, to the left.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"No, no, wait a minute--\"\n\n\"You do not seem to be quite sure. Think again, I beg.\"\n\n\"You take the middle path.\"\n\n\"But there are _four_.\"\n\n\"So there are. All I know is, that one of the four paths leads straight\nto Madame's apartments; and that one I am well acquainted with.\"\n\n\"But M. de Guiche is not in Madame's apartments, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, then the path which leads to Madame's apartments is of no use to\nme, and I would willingly exchange it for the one that leads to where M.\nde Guiche is lodging.\"\n\n\"Of course, and I know that as well; but as for indicating it from where\nwe are, it is quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Well, let us suppose that I have succeeded in finding that fortunate\npath.\"\n\n\"In that case, you are almost there, for you have nothing else to do but\ncross the labyrinth.\"\n\n\"_Nothing_ more than that? The deuce! so there is a labyrinth as well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and complicated enough too; even in daylight one may sometimes\nbe deceived,--there are turnings and windings without end: in the first\nplace, you must turn three times to the right, then twice to the left,\nthen turn once--stay, is it once or twice, though? at all events, when\nyou get clear of the labyrinth, you will see an avenue of sycamores,\nand this avenue leads straight to the pavilion in which M. de Guiche is\nlodging.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be more clearly indicated,\" said Manicamp; \"and I have\nnot the slightest doubt in the world that if I were to follow your\ndirections, I should lose my way immediately. I have, therefore, a\nslight service to ask of you.\"\n\n\"What may that be?\"\n\n\"That you will offer me your arm and guide me yourself, like another--\nlike another--I used to know mythology, but other important matters have\nmade me forget it; pray come with me, then?\"\n\n\"And am I to be abandoned, then?\" cried Malicorne.\n\n\"It is quite impossible, monsieur,\" said Montalais to Manicamp; \"if I\nwere to be seen with you at such an hour, what would be said of me?\"\n\n\"Your own conscience would acquit you,\" said Manicamp, sententiously.\n\n\"Impossible, monsieur, impossible.\"\n\n\"In that case, let me assist Malicorne to get down; he is a very\nintelligent fellow, and possesses a very keen scent; he will guide me,\nand if we lose ourselves, both of us will be lost, and the one will save\nthe other. If we are together, and should be met by any one, we shall\nlook as if we had some matter of business in hand; whilst alone I should\nhave the appearance either of a lover or a robber. Come, Malicorne, here\nis the ladder.\"\n\nMalicorne had already stretched out one of his legs towards the top of\nthe wall, when Manicamp said, in a whisper, \"Hush!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Montalais.\n\n\"I hear footsteps.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\"\n\nIn fact the fancied footsteps soon became a reality; the foliage was\npushed aside, and Saint-Aignan appeared, with a smile on his lips, and\nhis hand stretched out towards them, taking every one by surprise;\nthat is to say, Malicorne upon the tree with his head stretched out,\nMontalais upon the round of the ladder and clinging to it tightly,\nand Manicamp on the ground with his foot advanced ready to set off.\n\"Good-evening, Manicamp,\" said the comte, \"I am glad to see you, my dear\nfellow; we missed you this evening, and a good many inquiries have been\nmade about you. Mademoiselle de Montalais, your most obedient servant.\"\n\nMontalais blushed. \"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, hiding her face in\nboth her hands.\n\n\"Pray reassure yourself; I know how perfectly innocent you are, and I\nshall give a good account of you. Manicamp, do you follow me: the hedge,\nthe cross-paths, and labyrinth, I am well acquainted with them all;\nI will be your Ariadne. There now, your mythological name is found at\nlast.\"\n\n\"Perfectly true, comte.\"\n\n\"And take M. Malicorne away with you at the same time,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Malicorne; \"M. Manicamp has conversed with you\nas long as he liked, and now it is my turn, if you please; I have a\nmultitude of things to tell you about our future prospects.\"\n\n\"You hear,\" said the comte, laughing; \"stay with him, Mademoiselle\nMontalais. This is, indeed, a night for secrets.\" And, taking Manicamp's\narm, the comte led him rapidly away in the direction of the road\nMontalais knew so well, and indicated so badly. Montalais followed them\nwith her eyes as long as she could perceive them.\n\n\n\nChapter L: How Malicorne Had Been Turned Out of the Hotel of the Beau\nPaon.\n\nWhile Montalais was engaged in looking after the comte and Manicamp,\nMalicorne had taken advantage of the young girl's attention being drawn\naway to render his position somewhat more tolerable, and when she turned\nround, she immediately noticed the change which had taken place; for\nhe had seated himself, like a monkey, upon the wall, the foliage of the\nwild vine and honeysuckle curled around his head like a faun, while\nthe twisted ivy branches represented tolerably enough his cloven\nfeet. Montalais required nothing to make her resemblance to a dryad as\ncomplete as possible. \"Well,\" she said, ascending another round of the\nladder, \"are you resolved to render me unhappy? have you not persecuted\nme enough, tyrant that you are?\"\n\n\"I a tyrant?\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Yes, you are always compromising me, Monsieur Malicorne; you are a\nperfect monster of wickedness.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"What have you to do with Fontainebleau? Is not Orleans your place of\nresidence?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me what I have to do here? I wanted to see you.\"\n\n\"Ah, great need of that.\"\n\n\"Not as far as concerns yourself, perhaps, but as far as I am concerned,\nMademoiselle Montalais, you know very well that I have left my home, and\nthat, for the future, I have no other place of residence than that which\nyou may happen to have. As you, therefore, are staying at Fontainebleau\nat the present moment, I have come to Fontainebleau.\"\n\nMontalais shrugged her shoulders. \"You wished to see me, did you not?\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Very well, you have seen me,--you are satisfied; so now go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Malicorne; \"I came to talk with you as well as to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will talk by and by, and in another place than this.\"\n\n\"By and by! Heaven only knows if I shall meet you by and by in another\nplace. We shall never find a more favorable one than this.\"\n\n\"But I cannot this evening, nor at the present moment.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because a thousand things have happened to-night.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my affair will make a thousand and one.\"\n\n\"No, no; Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is waiting for me in our room\nto communicate something of the very greatest importance.\"\n\n\"How long has she been waiting?\"\n\n\"For an hour at least.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Malicorne, tranquilly, \"she can wait a few minutes\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Malicorne,\" said Montalais, \"you are forgetting yourself.\"\n\n\"You should rather say that it is you who are forgetting me, and that I\nam getting impatient at the part you make me play here indeed! For the\nlast week I have been prowling about among the company, and you have not\nonce deigned to notice my presence.\"\n\n\"Have you been prowling about here for a week, M. Malicorne?\"\n\n\"Like a wolf; sometimes I have been burnt by the fireworks, which\nhave singed two of my wigs; at others, I have been completely\ndrenched in the osiers by the evening damps, or the spray from the\nfountains,--half-famished, fatigued to death, with the view of a wall\nalways before me, and the prospect of having to scale it perhaps. Upon\nmy word, this is not the sort of life for any one to lead who is\nneither a squirrel, a salamander, nor an otter; and since you drive your\ninhumanity so far as to wish to make me renounce my condition as a man,\nI declare it openly. A man I am, indeed, and a man I will remain, unless\nby superior orders.\"\n\n\"Well, then, tell me, what do you wish,--what do you require,--what do\nyou insist upon?\" said Montalais, in a submissive tone.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you did not know I was at Fontainebleau?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Nay, be frank.\"\n\n\"I suspected so.\"\n\n\"Well, then, could you not have contrived during the last week to have\nseen me once a day, at least?\"\n\n\"I have always been prevented, M. Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\"\n\n\"Ask my companion, if you do not believe me.\"\n\n\"I shall ask no one to explain matters, I know better than any one.\"\n\n\"Compose yourself, M. Malicorne: things will change.\"\n\n\"They must indeed.\"\n\n\"You know that, whether I see you or not, I am thinking of you,\" said\nMontalais, in a coaxing tone of voice.\n\n\"Oh, you are thinking of me, are you? well, and is there anything new?\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"About my post in Monsieur's household.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear Malicorne, no one has ventured lately to approach his royal\nhighness.\"\n\n\"Well, but now?\"\n\n\"Now it is quite a different thing; since yesterday he has left off\nbeing jealous.\"\n\n\"Bah! how has his jealousy subsided?\"\n\n\"It has been diverted into another channel.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"A report was spread that the king had fallen in love with some one\nelse, and Monsieur was tranquillized immediately.\"\n\n\"And who spread the report?\"\n\nMontalais lowered her voice. \"Between ourselves,\" she said, \"I think\nthat Madame and the king have come to a secret understanding about it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Malicorne; \"that was the only way to manage it. But what\nabout poor M. de Guiche?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for him, he is completely turned off.\"\n\n\"Have they been writing to each other?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not; I have not seen a pen in either of their hands for\nthe last week.\"\n\n\"On what terms are you with Madame?\"\n\n\"The very best.\"\n\n\"And with the king?\"\n\n\"The king always smiles at me whenever I pass him.\"\n\n\"Good. Now tell me whom have the two lovers selected to serve as their\nscreen?\"\n\n\"La Valliere.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, poor girl! We must prevent that!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, if M. Raoul Bragelonne were to suspect it, he would either\nkill her or kill himself.\"\n\n\"Raoul, poor fellow! do you think so?\"\n\n\"Women pretend to have a knowledge of the state of people's affections,\"\nsaid Malicorne, \"and they do not even know how to read the thoughts of\ntheir own minds and hearts. Well, I can tell you that M. de Bragelonne\nloves La Valliere to such a degree that, if she deceived him, he would,\nI repeat, either kill himself or kill her.\"\n\n\"But the king is there to defend her,\" said Montalais.\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed Malicorne; \"Raoul would kill the king as he would\na common thief.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Montalais; \"you are mad, M. Malicorne.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Everything I have told you is, on the contrary,\nperfectly serious; and, for my own part, I know one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That I shall quietly tell Raoul of the trick.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Montalais, mounting another round of the ladder, so as to\napproach Malicorne more closely, \"do not open your lips to poor Raoul.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because, as yet you know nothing at all.\"\n\n\"What is the matter, then?\"\n\n\"Why, this evening--but no one is listening, I hope?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"This evening, then, beneath the royal oak, La Valliere said aloud, and\ninnocently enough, 'I cannot conceive that when one has once seen the\nking, one can ever love another man.'\"\n\nMalicorne almost jumped off the wall. \"Unhappy girl! did she really say\nthat?\"\n\n\"Word for word.\"\n\n\"And she thinks so?\"\n\n\"La Valliere always thinks what she says.\"\n\n\"That positively cries aloud for vengeance. Why, women are the veriest\nserpents,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Compose yourself, my dear Malicorne, compose yourself.\"\n\n\"No, no; let us take the evil in time, on the contrary. There is time\nenough yet to tell Raoul of it.\"\n\n\"Blunderer, on the contrary, it is too late,\" replied Montalais.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"La Valliere's remark, which was intended for the king, reached its\ndestination.\"\n\n\"The king knows it, then? The king was told of it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"The king heard it.\"\n\n\"_Ahime!_ as the cardinal used to say.\"\n\n\"The king was hidden in the thicket close to the royal oak.\"\n\n\"It follows, then,\" said Malicorne, \"that for the future, the plan which\nthe king and Madame have arranged, will go as easily as if it were on\nwheels, and will pass over poor Bragelonne's body.\"\n\n\"Precisely so.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Malicorne, after a moment's reflection, \"do not let us\ninterpose our poor selves between a large oak-tree and a great king, for\nwe should certainly be ground to pieces.\"\n\n\"The very thing I was going to say to you.\"\n\n\"Let us think of ourselves, then.\"\n\n\"My own idea.\"\n\n\"Open your beautiful eyes, then.\"\n\n\"And you your large ears.\"\n\n\"Approach your little mouth for a kiss.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Montalais, who paid the debt immediately in ringing coin.\n\n\"Now let us consider. First, we have M. de Guiche, who is in love with\nMadame; then La Valliere, who is in love with the king; next, the king,\nwho is in love both with Madame and La Valliere; lastly Monsieur, who\nloves no one but himself. Among all these loves, a noodle would make his\nfortune: a greater reason, therefore, for sensible people like ourselves\nto do so.\"\n\n\"There you are with your dreams again.\"\n\n\"Nay, rather with realities. Let me still lead you, darling. I do not\nthink you have been very badly off hitherto?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, the future is guaranteed by the past. Only, since all here think\nof themselves before anything else, let us do so too.\"\n\n\"Perfectly right.\"\n\n\"But of ourselves only.\"\n\n\"Be it so.\"\n\n\"An offensive and defensive alliance.\"\n\n\"I am ready to swear it.\"\n\n\"Put out your hand, then, and say, 'All for Malicorne.'\"\n\n\"All for Malicorne.\"\n\n\"And I, 'All for Montalais,'\" replied Malicorne, stretching out his hand\nin his turn.\n\n\"And now, what is to be done?\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes and ears constantly open; collect every means of attack\nwhich may be serviceable against others; never let anything lie about\nwhich can be used against ourselves.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"Decided.\"\n\n\"Sworn to. And now the agreement entered into, good-bye.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'good-bye?'\"\n\n\"Of course you can now return to your inn.\"\n\n\"To my inn?\"\n\n\"Yes; are you not lodging at the sign of the Beau Paon?\"\n\n\"Montalais, Montalais, you now betray that you were aware of my being at\nFontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Well; and what does that prove, except that I occupy myself about you\nmore than you deserve?\"\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\n\"Go back, then, to the Beau Paon.\"\n\n\"That is now quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"Have you not a room there?\"\n\n\"I had, but have it no longer.\"\n\n\"Who has taken it from you, then?\"\n\n\"I will tell you. Some little time ago I was returning there, after I\nhad been running about after you; and having reached my hotel quite out\nof breath, I perceived a litter, upon which four peasants were carrying\na sick monk.\"\n\n\"A monk?\"\n\n\"Yes, an old gray-bearded Franciscan. As I was looking at the monk, they\nentered the hotel; and as they were carrying him up the staircase, I\nfollowed, and as I reached the top of the staircase I observed that they\ntook him into my room.\"\n\n\"Into your room?\"\n\n\"Yes, into my own apartment. Supposing it to be a mistake, I summoned\nthe landlord, who said that the room which had been let to me for the\npast eight days was let to the Franciscan for the ninth.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"That was exactly what I said; nay, I did even more, for I was inclined\nto get out of temper. I went up-stairs again. I spoke to the Franciscan\nhimself, and wished to prove to him the impropriety of the step; when\nthis monk, dying though he seemed to be, raised himself upon his\narm, fixed a pair of blazing eyes upon me, and, in a voice which was\nadmirably suited for commanding a charge of cavalry, said, 'Turn this\nfellow out of doors;' which was done, immediately by the landlord and\nthe four porters, who made me descend the staircase somewhat faster than\nwas agreeable. This is how it happens, dearest, that I have no lodging.\"\n\n\"Who can this Franciscan be?\" said Montalais. \"Is he a general?\"\n\n\"That is exactly the very title that one of the bearers of the litter\ngave him as he spoke to him in a low tone.\"\n\n\"So that--\" said Montalais.\n\n\"So that I have no room, no hotel, no lodging; and I am as determined as\nmy friend Manicamp was just now, not to pass the night in the open air.\"\n\n\"What is to be done, then?\" said Montalais.\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" said a third voice; whereupon Montalais and Malicorne\nuttered a simultaneous cry, and Saint-Aignan appeared. \"Dear Monsieur\nMalicorne,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"a very lucky accident has brought me\nback to extricate you from your embarrassment. Come, I can offer you a\nroom in my own apartments, which, I can assure you, no Franciscan will\ndeprive you of. As for you, my dear lady, rest easy. I already knew\nMademoiselle de la Valliere's secret, and that of Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente; your own you have just been kind enough to confide\nto me; for which I thank you. I can keep three quite as well as one.\"\nMalicorne and Montalais looked at each other, like children detected in\na theft; but as Malicorne saw a great advantage in the proposition which\nhad been made to him, he gave Montalais a sign of assent, which\nshe returned. Malicorne then descended the ladder, round by round,\nreflecting at every step on the means of obtaining piecemeal from M.\nde Saint-Aignan all he might possibly know about the famous secret.\nMontalais had already darted away like a deer, and neither cross-road\nnor labyrinth was able to lead her wrong. As for Saint-Aignan, he\ncarried off Malicorne with him to his apartments, showing him a thousand\nattentions, enchanted to have so close at hand the very two men who,\neven supposing De Guiche were to remain silent, could give him the best\ninformation about the maids of honor.\n\n\n\nChapter LI. What Actually Occurred at the Inn Called the Beau Paon.\n\nIn the first place, let us supply our readers with a few details\nabout the inn called Beau Paon. It owed its name to its sign, which\nrepresented a peacock spreading its tail. But, in imitation of certain\npainters who bestowed the face of a handsome young man on the serpent\nwhich tempted Eve, the limner of the sign had conferred upon the peacock\nthe features of a woman. This famous inn, an architectural epigram\nagainst that half of the human race which renders existence delightful,\nwas situated at Fontainebleau, in the first turning on the left-hand\nside, which divides the road from Paris, the large artery that\nconstitutes in itself alone the entire town of Fontainebleau. The side\nstreet in question was then known as the Rue de Lyon, doubtless because,\ngeographically, it led in the direction of the second capital of the\nkingdom. The street itself was composed of two houses occupied by\npersons of the class of tradespeople, the houses being separated by\ntwo large gardens bordered with hedges running round them. Apparently,\nhowever, there were three houses in the street. Let us explain,\nnotwithstanding appearances, how there were in fact only two. The inn of\nthe Beau Paon had its principal front towards the main street; but\nupon the Rue de Lyon there were two ranges of buildings divided by\ncourtyards, which comprised sets of apartments for the reception of\nall classes of travelers, whether on foot or on horseback, or even with\ntheir own carriages; and in which could be supplied, not only board\nand lodging, but also accommodation for exercise, or opportunities\nof solitude for even the wealthiest courtiers, whenever, after having\nreceived some check at the court, they wished to shut themselves up to\ntheir own society, either to devour an affront, or to brood on revenge.\nFrom the windows of this part of the building travelers could perceive,\nin the first place, the street with the grass growing between the\nstones, which were being gradually loosened by it; next the beautiful\nhedges of elder and thorn, which embraced, as though within two green\nand flowery arms, the house of which we have spoken; and then, in the\nspaces between those houses, forming the groundwork of the picture,\nand appearing an almost impassable barrier, a line of thick trees,\nthe advanced sentinels of the vast forest which extends in front of\nFontainebleau. It was therefore easy, provided one secured an apartment\nat the angle of the building, to obtain, by the main street from Paris,\na view of, as well as to hear, the passers-by and the _fetes_; and, by\nthe Rue de Lyon, to look upon and to enjoy the calm of the country. And\nthis without reckoning that, in cases of urgent necessity, at the very\nmoment people might be knocking at the principal door in the Rue de\nParis, one could make one's escape by the little door in the Rue de\nLyon, and, creeping along the gardens of the private houses, attain the\noutskirts of the forest. Malicorne, who, it will be remembered, was the\nfirst to speak about this inn, by way of deploring his being turned out\nof it, being then absorbed in his own affairs, had not told Montalais\nall that could be said about this curious inn; and we will try to repair\nthe omission. With the exception of the few words he had said about\nthe Franciscan friar, Malicorne had not given any particulars about\nthe travelers who were staying in the inn. The manner in which they\nhad arrived, the manner in which they had lived, the difficulty which\nexisted for every one but certain privileged travelers, of entering the\nhotel without a password, or living there without certain preparatory\nprecautions, must have struck Malicorne; and, we will venture to say,\nreally did so. But Malicorne, as we have already said, had personal\nmatters of his own to occupy his attention which prevented him from\npaying much attention to others. In fact, all the apartments of the\nhotel were engaged and retained by certain strangers, who never stirred\nout, who were incommunicative in their address, with countenances full\nof thoughtful preoccupation, and not one of whom was known to Malicorne.\nEvery one of these travelers had reached the hotel after his own arrival\nthere; each man had entered after having given a kind of password, which\nhad at first attracted Malicorne's attention; but having inquired, in\nan indiscreet manner, about it, he had been informed that the host had\ngiven as a reason for this extreme vigilance, that, as the town was so\nfull of wealthy noblemen, it must also be as full of clever and zealous\npickpockets. The reputation of an honest inn like that of the Beau Paon\nwas concerned in not allowing its visitors to be robbed. It occasionally\nhappened that Malicorne asked himself, as he thought matters carefully\nover in his mind, and reflected upon his own position in the inn, how it\nwas that they had allowed him to become an inmate of the hotel, when he\nhad observed, since his residence there, admission refused to so many.\nHe asked himself, too, how it was that Manicamp, who, in his opinion,\nmust be a man to be looked upon with veneration by everybody, having\nwished to bait his horse at the Beau Paon, on arriving there, both horse\nand rider had been incontinently turned away with a _nescio vos_ of the\nmost positive character. All this for Malicorne, whose mind being fully\noccupied by his own love affair and personal ambition, was a problem\nhe had not applied himself to solve. Had he wished to do so, we should\nhardly venture, notwithstanding the intelligence we have accorded as\nhis due, to say he would have succeeded. A few words will prove to the\nreader that no one but Oedipus in person could have solved the enigma in\nquestion. During the week, seven travelers had taken up their abode in\nthe inn, all of them having arrived there the day after the fortunate\nday on which Malicorne had fixed his choice on the Beau Paon. These\nseven persons, accompanied by a suitable retinue, were the following:--\n\nFirst of all, a brigadier in the German army, his secretary, physician,\nthree servants, and seven horses. The brigadier's name was the Comte\nde Wostpur.--A Spanish cardinal, with two nephews, two secretaries, an\nofficer of his household, and twelve horses. The cardinal's name was\nMonseigneur Herrebia.--A rich merchant of Bremen, with his man-servant\nand two horses. This merchant's name was Meinheer Bonstett.--A Venetian\nsenator with his wife and daughter, both extremely beautiful. The\nsenator's name was Signor Marini.--A Scottish laird, with seven\nhighlanders of his clan, all on foot. The laird's name was MacCumnor.--\nAn Austrian from Vienna without title or coat of arms, who had arrived\nin a carriage; a good deal of the priest, and something of the soldier.\nHe was called the Councilor.--And, finally, a Flemish lady, with a\nman-servant, a lady's maid, and a female companion, a large retinue of\nservants, great display, and immense horses. She was called the Flemish\nlady.\n\nAll these travelers had arrived on the same day, and yet their arrival\nhad occasioned no confusion in the inn, no stoppage in the street;\ntheir apartments had been fixed upon beforehand, by their couriers or\nsecretaries, who had arrived the previous evening or that very morning.\nMalicorne, who had arrived the previous day, riding an ill-conditioned\nhorse, with a slender valise, had announced himself at the hotel of\nthe Beau Paon as the friend of a nobleman desirous of witnessing the\n_fetes_, and who would himself arrive almost immediately. The landlord,\non hearing these words, had smiled as if he were perfectly well\nacquainted either with Malicorne or his friend the nobleman, and had\nsaid to him, \"Since you are the first arrival, monsieur, choose what\napartment you please.\" And this was said with that obsequiousness of\nmanners, so full of meaning with landlords, which means, \"Make yourself\nperfectly easy, monsieur: we know with whom we have to do, and you will\nbe treated accordingly.\" These words, and their accompanying gesture,\nMalicorne had thought very friendly, but rather obscure. However, as he\ndid not wish to be very extravagant in his expenses, and as he thought\nthat if he were to ask for a small apartment he would doubtless have\nbeen refused, on account of his want of consequence, he hastened to\nclose at once with the innkeeper's remark, and deceive him with a\ncunning equal to his own. So, smiling as a man would do for whom\nwhatever might be done was but simply his due, he said, \"My dear host, I\nshall take the best and the gayest room in the house.\"\n\n\"With a stable?\"\n\n\"Yes, with a stable.\"\n\n\"And when will you take it?\"\n\n\"Immediately if it be possible.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Malicorne, \"I shall leave the large room unoccupied for the\npresent.\"\n\n\"Very good!\" said the landlord, with an air of intelligence.\n\n\"Certain reasons, which you will understand by and by, oblige me to\ntake, at my own cost, this small room only.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the host.\n\n\"When my friend arrives, he will occupy the large apartment: and as a\nmatter of course, as this larger apartment will be his own affair, he\nwill settle for it himself.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the landlord, \"certainly; let it be understood in that\nmanner.\"\n\n\"It is agreed, then, that such shall be the terms?\"\n\n\"Word for word.\"\n\n\"It is extraordinary,\" said Malicorne to himself. \"You quite understand,\nthen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"There is nothing more to be said. Since you understand,--for you do\nclearly understand, do you not?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Very well; and now show me to my room.\"\n\nThe landlord, cap in hand, preceded Malicorne, who installed himself\nin his room, and became more and more surprised to observe that the\nlandlord, at every ascent or descent, looked and winked at him in a\nmanner which indicated the best possible intelligence between them.\n\n\"There is some mistake here,\" said Malicorne to himself; \"but until it\nis cleared up, I shall take advantage of it, which is the best thing\nI can possibly do.\" And he darted out of his room, like a hunting-dog\nfollowing a scent, in search of all the news and curiosities of the\ncourt, getting himself burnt in one place and drowned in another, as he\nhad told Mademoiselle de Montalais. The day after he had been installed\nin his room, he had noticed the seven travelers arrive successively, who\nspeedily filled the whole hotel. When he saw this perfect multitude\nof people, of carriages, and retinue, Malicorne rubbed his hands\ndelightedly, thinking that, one day later, he should not have found a\nbed to lie upon after his return from his exploring expeditions. When\nall the travelers were lodged, the landlord entered Malicorne's room,\nand with his accustomed courteousness, said to him, \"You are aware, my\ndear monsieur, that the large room in the third detached building is\nstill reserved for you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am aware of it.\"\n\n\"I am really making you a present of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"So that when your friend comes--\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"He will be satisfied with me, I hope: or, if he be not, he will be very\ndifficult to please.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but will you allow me to say a few words about my friend?\"\n\n\"Of course, for you have a perfect right to do so.\"\n\n\"He intended to come, as you know.\"\n\n\"And he does so still.\"\n\n\"He may possibly have changed his opinion.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure, then?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"But in case you should have some doubt.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"I can only say that I do not positively assure you that he will come.\"\n\n\"Yet he told you--\"\n\n\"He certainly did tell me; but you know that man proposes and God\ndisposes,--_verba volant, scripta manent_.\"\n\n\"Which is as much to say--\"\n\n\"That what is spoken flies away, and what is written remains; and, as\nhe did not write to me, but contented himself by saying to me, 'I will\nauthorize you, yet without specifically instructing you,' you must feel\nthat it places me in a very embarrassing position.\"\n\n\"What do you authorize me to do, then?\"\n\n\"Why, to let your rooms if you find a good tenant for them.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"Never will I do such a thing, monsieur. If he has not written to you,\nhe has written to me.\"\n\n\"Ah! what does he say? Let us see if his letter agrees with his words.\"\n\n\"These are almost his very words. 'To the landlord of the Beau Paon\nHotel,--You will have been informed of the meeting arranged to take\nplace in your inn between some people of importance; I shall be one of\nthose who will meet with the others at Fontainebleau. Keep for me, then,\na small room for a friend who will arrive either before or after me--'\nand you are the friend, I suppose,\" said the landlord, interrupting his\nreading of the letter. Malicorne bowed modestly. The landlord continued:\n\n\"'And a large apartment for myself. The large apartment is my own\naffair, but I wish the price of the smaller room to be moderate, as it\nis destined for a fellow who is deucedly poor.' It is still you he is\nspeaking of, is he not?\" said the host.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Malicorne.\n\n\"Then we are agreed; your friend will settle for his apartment, and you\nfor your own.\"\n\n\"May I be broken alive on the wheel,\" said Malicorne to himself, \"if\nI understand anything at all about it,\" and then he said aloud, \"Well,\nthen, are you satisfied with the name?\"\n\n\"With what name?\"\n\n\"With the name at the end of the letter. Does it give you the guarantee\nyou require?\"\n\n\"I was going to ask you the name.\"\n\n\"What! was the letter not signed?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the landlord, opening his eyes very wide, full of mystery and\ncuriosity.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Malicorne, imitating his gesture and his mysterious\nlook, \"if he has not given you his name, you understand, he must have\nhis reasons for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course.\"\n\n\"And, therefore, I, his friend, his confidant, must not betray him.\"\n\n\"You are perfectly right, monsieur,\" said the landlord, \"and I do not\ninsist upon it.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your delicacy. As for myself, as my friend told you,\nmy room is a separate affair, so let us come to terms about it. Short\naccounts make long friends. How much is it?\"\n\n\"There is no hurry.\"\n\n\"Never mind, let us reckon it all up all the same. Room, my own board, a\nplace in the stable for my horse, and his feed. How much per day?\"\n\n\"Four livres, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Which will make twelve livres for the three days I have been here?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Here are your twelve livres, then.\"\n\n\"But why settle now?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Malicorne, lowering his voice, and resorting to his\nformer air of mystery, because he saw that the mysterious had succeeded,\n\"because if I had to set off suddenly, to decamp at any moment, my\naccount would be settled.\"\n\n\"You are right, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I may consider myself at home, then?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"So far so well. Adieu!\" And the landlord withdrew. Malicorne, left\nalone, reasoned with himself in the following manner: \"No one but De\nGuiche or Manicamp could have written to this fellow; De Guiche, because\nhe wishes to secure a lodging for himself beyond the precincts of the\ncourt, in the event of his success or failure, as the case might be;\nManicamp, because De Guiche must have intrusted him with his commission.\nAnd De Guiche or Manicamp will have argued in this manner. The large\napartment would serve for the reception, in a befitting manner, of a\nlady thickly veiled, reserving to the lady in question a double means\nof exit, either in a street somewhat deserted, or closely adjoining the\nforest. The smaller room might either shelter Manicamp for a time, who\nis De Guiche's confidant, and would be the vigilant keeper of the door,\nor De Guiche himself, acting, for greater safety, the part of a master\nand confidant at the same time. Yet,\" he continued, \"how about this\nmeeting which is to take place, and which has actually taken place, in\nthis hotel? No doubt they are persons who are going to be presented to\nthe king. And the 'poor devil,' for whom the smaller room is destined,\nis a trick, in order to better conceal De Guiche or Manicamp. If this\nbe the case, as very likely it is, there is only half the mischief done,\nfor there is simply the length of a purse string between Manicamp and\nMalicorne.\" After he had thus reasoned the matter out, Malicorne slept\nsoundly, leaving the seven travelers to occupy, and in every sense\nof the word to walk up and down, their several lodgings in the hotel.\nWhenever there was nothing at court to put him out, when he had wearied\nhimself with his excursions and investigations, tired of writing letters\nwhich he could never find an opportunity of delivering to the people\nthey were intended for, he returned home to his comfortable little room,\nand leaning upon the balcony, which was filled with nasturtiums and\nwhite pinks, for whom Fontainebleau seemed to possess no attractions\nwith all its illuminations, amusements, and _fetes_.\n\nThings went on in this manner until the seventh day, a day of which\nwe have given such full details, with its night also, in the preceding\nchapters. On that night Malicorne was enjoying the fresh air, seated at\nhis window, toward one o'clock in the morning, when Manicamp appeared on\nhorseback, with a thoughtful and listless air.\n\n\"Good!\" said Malicorne to himself, recognizing him at the first glance;\n\"there's my friend, who is come to take possession of his apartment,\nthat is to say, of my room.\" And he called to Manicamp, who looked up\nand immediately recognized Malicorne.\n\n\"Ah! by Jove!\" said the former, his countenance clearing up, \"glad to\nsee you, Malicorne. I have been wandering about Fontainebleau, looking\nfor three things I cannot find: De Guiche, a room, and a stable.\"\n\n\"Of M. de Guiche I cannot give you either good or bad news, for I have\nnot seen him; but as far as concerns your room and a stable, that's\nanother matter, for they have been retained here for you.\"\n\n\"Retained--and by whom?\"\n\n\"By yourself, I presume.\"\n\n\"By _me?_\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you did not take lodgings here?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said Manicamp.\n\nAt this moment the landlord appeared on the threshold of the door.\n\n\"I want a room,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"Did you engage one, monsieur?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I have no rooms to let.\"\n\n\"In that case, I have engaged a room,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"A room simply, or lodgings?\"\n\n\"Anything you please.\"\n\n\"By letter?\" inquired the landlord.\n\nMalicorne nodded affirmatively to Manicamp.\n\n\"Of course by letter,\" said Manicamp. \"Did you not receive a letter from\nme?\"\n\n\"What was the date of the letter?\" inquired the host, in whom Manicamp's\nhesitation had aroused some suspicion.\n\nManicamp rubbed his ear, and looked up at Malicorne's window; but\nMalicorne had left his window and was coming down the stairs to his\nfriend's assistance. At the very same moment, a traveler, wrapped in\na large Spanish cloak, appeared at the porch, near enough to hear the\nconversation.\n\n\"I ask you what was the date of the letter you wrote to me to retain\napartments here?\" repeated the landlord, pressing the question.\n\n\"Last Wednesday was the date,\" said the mysterious stranger, in a soft\nand polished tone of voice, touching the landlord on the shoulder.\n\nManicamp drew back, and it was now Malicorne's turn, who appeared on the\nthreshold, to scratch his ear. The landlord saluted the new arrival as a\nman who recognizes his true guest.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said to him, with civility, \"your apartment is ready\nfor you, and the stables too, only--\" He looked round him and inquired,\n\"Your horses?\"\n\n\"My horses may or may not arrive. That, however, matters but little\nto you, provided you are paid for what has been engaged.\" The landlord\nbowed lower still.\n\n\"You have,\" continued the unknown traveler, \"kept for me in addition,\nthe small room I asked for?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Malicorne, endeavoring to hide himself.\n\n\"Your friend has occupied it during the last week,\" said the landlord,\npointing to Malicorne, who was trying to make himself as small as\npossible. The traveler, drawing his cloak round him so as to cover the\nlower part of his face, cast a rapid glance at Malicorne, and said,\n\"This gentleman is no friend of mine.\"\n\nThe landlord started violently.\n\n\"I am not acquainted with this gentleman,\" continued the traveler.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the host, turning to Malicorne, \"are you not this\ngentleman's friend, then?\"\n\n\"What does it matter whether I am or not, provided you are paid?\" said\nMalicorne, parodying the stranger's remark in a very majestic manner.\n\n\"It matters so far as this,\" said the landlord, who began to perceive\nthat one person had been taken for another, \"that I beg you, monsieur,\nto leave the rooms, which had been engaged beforehand, and by some one\nelse instead of you.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Malicorne, \"this gentleman cannot require at the same\ntime a room on the first floor and an apartment on the second. If this\ngentleman will take the room, I will take the apartment: if he prefers\nthe apartment, I will be satisfied with the room.\"\n\n\"I am exceedingly distressed, monsieur,\" said the traveler in his soft\nvoice, \"but I need both the room and the apartment.\"\n\n\"At least, tell me for whom?\" inquired Malicorne.\n\n\"The apartment I require for myself.\"\n\n\"Very well; but the room?\"\n\n\"Look,\" said the traveler, pointing towards a sort of procession which\nwas approaching.\n\nMalicorne looked in the direction indicated, and observed borne upon\na litter, the arrival of the Franciscan, whose installation in his\napartment he had, with a few details of his own, related to Montalais,\nand whom he had so uselessly endeavored to convert to humbler views. The\nresult of the arrival of the stranger, and of the sick Franciscan, was\nMalicorne's expulsion, without any consideration for his feelings,\nfrom the inn, by the landlord and the peasants who had carried the\nFranciscan. The details have already been given of what followed this\nexpulsion; of Manicamp's conversation with Montalais; how Manicamp, with\ngreater cleverness than Malicorne had shown, had succeeded in obtaining\nnews of De Guiche, of the subsequent conversation of Montalais with\nMalicorne, and, finally, of the billets with which the Comte de\nSaint-Aignan had furnished Manicamp and Malicorne. It remains for us\nto inform our readers who was the traveler in the cloak--the principal\ntenant of the double apartment, of which Malicorne had only occupied\na portion--and the Franciscan, quite as mysterious a personage, whose\narrival, together with that of the stranger, unfortunately upset the two\nfriends' plans.\n\n\n\nChapter LII. A Jesuit of the Eleventh Year.\n\nIn the first place, in order not to weary the reader's patience, we will\nhasten to answer the first question. The traveler with the cloak held\nover his face was Aramis, who, after he had left Fouquet, and taken\nfrom a portmanteau, which his servant had opened, a cavalier's complete\ncostume, quitted the chateau, and went to the hotel of the Beau Paon,\nwhere, by letters, seven or eight days previously, he had, as the\nlandlord had stated, directed a room and an apartment to be retained\nfor him. Immediately after Malicorne and Manicamp had been turned out,\nAramis approached the Franciscan, and asked him whether he would prefer\nthe apartment or the room. The Franciscan inquired where they were both\nsituated. He was told that the room was on the first, and the apartment\non the second floor.\n\n\"The room, then,\" he said.\n\nAramis did not contradict him, but, with great submissiveness, said to\nthe landlord: \"The room.\" And bowing with respect he withdrew into the\napartment, and the Franciscan was accordingly carried at once into the\nroom. Now, is it not extraordinary that this respect should be shown by\na prelate of the Church for a simple monk, for one, too, belonging to a\nmendicant order; to whom was given up, without a request for it even, a\nroom which so many travelers were desirous of obtaining? How, too, can\none explain the unexpected arrival of Aramis at the hotel--he who had\nentered the chateau with M. Fouquet, and could have remained at the\nchateau with M. Fouquet if he had liked? The Franciscan supported his\nremoval up the staircase without uttering a complaint, although it was\nevident he suffered very much, and that every time the litter knocked\nagainst the wall or the railing of the staircase, he experienced a\nterrible shock throughout his frame. And finally, when he had arrived in\nthe room, he said to those who carried him: \"Help me to place myself in\nthat armchair.\" The bearers of the litter placed it on the ground, and\nlifting the sick man up as gently as possible, carried him to the chair\nhe had indicated, which was situated at the head of the bed. \"Now,\" he\nadded, with a marked benignity of gesture and tone, \"desire the landlord\nto come.\"\n\nThey obeyed, and five minutes afterwards the landlord appeared at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Be kind enough,\" said the Franciscan to him, \"to send these excellent\nfellows away; they are vassals of the Vicomte de Melun. They found\nme when I had fainted on the road overcome by the heat, and without\nthinking of whether they would be paid for their trouble, they wished to\ncarry me to their own home. But I know at what cost to themselves is the\nhospitality which the poor extend to a sick monk, and I preferred this\nhotel, where, moreover, I was expected.\"\n\nThe landlord looked at the Franciscan in amazement, but the latter,\nwith his thumb, made the sign of the cross in a peculiar manner upon his\nbreast. The host replied by making a similar sign on his left shoulder.\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he said, \"we did expect you, but we hoped that you would\narrive in a better state of health.\" And as the peasants were looking\nat the innkeeper, usually so supercilious, and saw how respectful he had\nbecome in the presence of a poor monk, the Franciscan drew from a deep\npocket three or four pieces of gold which he held out.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"here is something to repay you for the care\nyou have taken of me. So make yourselves perfectly easy, and do not be\nafraid of leaving me here. The order to which I belong, and for which\nI am traveling, does not require me to beg; only, as the attention you\nhave shown me deserves to be rewarded, take these two louis and depart\nin peace.\"\n\nThe peasants did not dare to take them; the landlord took the two louis\nout of the monk's hand and placed them in that of one of the peasants,\nall four of whom withdrew, opening their eyes wider than ever. The door\nwas then closed; and, while the innkeeper stood respectfully near it,\nthe Franciscan collected himself for a moment. He then passed across\nhis sallow face a hand which seemed dried up by fever, and rubbed his\nnervous and agitated fingers across his beard. His large eyes, hollowed\nby sickness and inquietude, seemed to peruse in the vague distance a\nmournful and fixed idea.\n\n\"What physicians have you at Fontainebleau?\" he inquired, after a long\npause.\n\n\"We have three, holy father.\"\n\n\"What are their names?\"\n\n\"Luiniguet first.\"\n\n\"The next one?\"\n\n\"A brother of the Carmelite order, named Brother Hubert.\"\n\n\"The next?\"\n\n\"A secular member, named Grisart.\"\n\n\"Ah! Grisart?\" murmured the monk, \"send for M. Grisart immediately.\"\n\nThe landlord moved in prompt obedience to the direction.\n\n\"Tell me what priests are there here?\"\n\n\"What priests?\"\n\n\"Yes; belonging to what orders?\"\n\n\"There are Jesuits, Augustines, and Cordeliers; but the Jesuits are the\nclosest at hand. Shall I send for a confessor belonging to the order of\nJesuits?\"\n\n\"Yes, immediately.\"\n\nIt will be imagined that, at the sign of the cross which they had\nexchanged, the landlord and the invalid monk had recognized each other\nas two affiliated members of the well-known Society of Jesus. Left to\nhimself, the Franciscan drew from his pocket a bundle of papers, some of\nwhich he read over with the most careful attention. The violence of\nhis disorder, however, overcame his courage; his eyes rolled in their\nsockets, a cold sweat poured down his face, and he nearly fainted, and\nlay with his head thrown backwards and his arms hanging down on both\nsides of his chair. For more than five minutes he remained without any\nmovement, when the landlord returned, bringing with him the physician,\nwhom he hardly allowed time to dress himself. The noise they made in\nentering the room, the current of air, which the opening of the door\noccasioned, restored the Franciscan to his senses. He hurriedly seized\nhold of the papers which were lying about, and with his long and bony\nhand concealed them under the cushions of the chair. The landlord went\nout of the room, leaving patient and physician together.\n\n\"Come here, Monsieur Grisart,\" said the Franciscan to the doctor;\n\"approach closer, for there is no time to lose. Try, by touch and sound,\nand consider and pronounce your sentence.\"\n\n\"The landlord,\" replied the doctor, \"told me I had the honor of\nattending an affiliated brother.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Franciscan, \"it is so. Tell me the truth, then; I\nfeel very ill, and I think I am about to die.\"\n\nThe physician took the monk's hand, and felt his pulse. \"Oh, oh,\" he\nsaid, \"a dangerous fever.\"\n\n\"What do you call a dangerous fever?\" inquired the Franciscan, with an\nimperious look.\n\n\"To an affiliated member of the first or second year,\" replied the\nphysician, looking inquiringly at the monk, \"I should say--a fever that\nmay be cured.\"\n\n\"But to me?\" said the Franciscan. The physician hesitated.\n\n\"Look at my grey hair, and my forehead, full of anxious thought,\" he\ncontinued: \"look at the lines in my face, by which I reckon up the\ntrials I have undergone; I am a Jesuit of the eleventh year, Monsieur\nGrisart.\" The physician started, for, in fact, a Jesuit of the eleventh\nyear was one of those men who had been initiated in all the secrets\nof the order, one of those for whom science has no more secrets, the\nsociety no further barriers to present--temporal obedience, no more\ntrammels.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Grisart, saluting him with respect, \"I am in the\npresence of a master?\"\n\n\"Yes; act, therefore, accordingly.\"\n\n\"And you wish to know?\"\n\n\"My real state.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the physician, \"it is a brain fever, which has reached its\nhighest degree of intensity.\"\n\n\"There is no hope, then?\" inquired the Franciscan, in a quick tone of\nvoice.\n\n\"I do not say that,\" replied the doctor; \"yet, considering the\ndisordered state of the brain, the hurried respiration, the rapidity of\nthe pulse, and the burning nature of the fever which is devouring you--\"\n\n\"And which has thrice prostrated me since this morning,\" said the monk.\n\n\"All things considered, I shall call it a terrible attack. But why did\nyou not stop on your road?\"\n\n\"I was expected here, and I was obliged to come.\"\n\n\"Even at the risk of your life?\"\n\n\"Yes, at the risk of dying on the way.\"\n\n\"Very well. Considering all the symptoms of your case, I must tell you\nthat your condition is almost desperate.\"\n\nThe Franciscan smiled in a strange manner.\n\n\"What you have just told me is, perhaps, sufficient for what is due to\nan affiliated member, even of the eleventh year; but for what is due\nto me, Monsieur Grisart, it is too little, and I have a right to demand\nmore. Come, then, let us be more candid still, and as frank as if you\nwere making your own confession to Heaven. Besides, I have already sent\nfor a confessor.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have hopes, however,\" murmured the doctor.\n\n\"Answer me,\" said the sick man, displaying with a dignified gesture\na golden ring, the stone of which had until that moment been turned\ninside, and which bore engraved thereon the distinguishing mark of the\nSociety of Jesus.\n\nGrisart uttered loud exclamation. \"The general!\" he cried.\n\n\"Silence,\" said the Franciscan., \"you can now understand that the whole\ntruth is all important.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, monseigneur,\" murmured Grisart, \"send for the confessor,\nfor in two hours, at the next seizure, you will be attacked by delirium,\nand will pass away in its course.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the patient, for a moment contracting his eyebrows, \"I\nhave still two hours to live then?\"\n\n\"Yes; particularly if you take the potion I will send you presently.\"\n\n\"And that will give me two hours of life?\"\n\n\"Two hours.\"\n\n\"I would take it, were it poison, for those two hours are necessary not\nonly for myself, but for the glory of the order.\"\n\n\"What a loss, what a catastrophe for us all!\" murmured the physician.\n\n\"It is the loss of one man--nothing more,\" replied the Franciscan, \"for\nHeaven will enable the poor monk, who is about to leave you, to find\na worthy successor. Adieu, Monsieur Grisart; already even, through the\ngoodness of Heaven, I have met with you. A physician who had not been\none of our holy order, would have left me in ignorance of my condition;\nand, confident that existence would be prolonged a few days further, I\nshould not have taken the necessary precautions. You are a learned man,\nMonsieur Grisart, and that confers an honor upon us all; it would have\nbeen repugnant to my feelings to have found one of our order of little\nstanding in his profession. Adieu, Monsieur Grisart; send me the cordial\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Give me your blessing, at least, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"In my mind, I do; go, go; in my mind, I do so, I tell you--_animo_,\nMaitre Grisart, _viribus impossibile_.\" And he again fell back on the\narmchair, in an almost senseless state. M. Grisart hesitated, whether\nhe should give him immediate assistance, or should run to prepare the\ncordial he had promised. He decided in favor of the cordial, for he\ndarted out of the room and disappeared down the staircase. [6]\n\n\n\nChapter LIII. The State Secret.\n\nA few moments after the doctor's departure, the confessor arrived. He\nhad hardly crossed the threshold of the door when the Franciscan fixed\na penetrating look upon him, and, shaking his head, murmured--\"A weak\nmind, I see; may Heaven forgive me if I die without the help of this\nliving piece of human infirmity.\" The confessor, on his side, regarded\nthe dying man with astonishment, almost with terror. He had never beheld\neyes so burningly bright at the very moment they were about to close,\nnor looks so terrible at the moment they were about to be quenched in\ndeath. The Franciscan made a rapid and imperious movement of his hand.\n\"Sit down, there, my father,\" he said, \"and listen to me.\" The Jesuit\nconfessor, a good priest, a recently initiated member of the order,\nwho had merely seen the beginning of its mysteries, yielded to the\nsuperiority assumed by the penitent.\n\n\"There are several persons staying in this hotel,\" continued the\nFranciscan.\n\n\"But,\" inquired the Jesuit, \"I thought I had been summoned to listen to\na confession. Is your remark, then, a confession?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"In order to know whether I am to keep your words secret.\"\n\n\"My remarks are part of my confession; I confide them to you in your\ncharacter of a confessor.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the priest, seating himself on the chair which the\nFranciscan had, with great difficulty, just left, to lie down on the\nbed.\n\nThe Franciscan continued,--\"I repeat, there are several persons staying\nin this inn.\"\n\n\"So I have heard.\"\n\n\"They ought to be eight in number.\"\n\nThe Jesuit made a sign that he understood him. \"The first to whom I wish\nto speak,\" said the dying man, \"is a German from Vienna, whose name is\nBaron de Wostpur. Be kind enough to go to him, and tell him the person\nhe expected has arrived.\" The confessor, astounded, looked at his\npenitent; the confession seemed a singular one.\n\n\"Obey,\" said the Franciscan, in a tone of command impossible to resist.\nThe good Jesuit, completely subdued, rose and left the room. As soon as\nhe had gone, the Franciscan again took up the papers which a crisis of\nthe fever had already, once before, obliged him to put aside.\n\n\"The Baron de Wostpur? Good!\" he said; \"ambitious, a fool, and\nstraitened in means.\"\n\nHe folded up the papers, which he thrust under his pillow. Rapid\nfootsteps were heard at the end of the corridor. The confessor returned,\nfollowed by the Baron de Wostpur, who walked along with his head raised,\nas if he were discussing with himself the possibility of touching the\nceiling with the feather in his hat. Therefore, at the appearance of\nthe Franciscan, at his melancholy look, and seeing the plainness of the\nroom, he stopped, and inquired,--\"Who has summoned me?\"\n\n\"I,\" said the Franciscan, who turned towards the confessor, saying, \"My\ngood father, leave us for a moment together; when this gentleman leaves,\nyou will return here.\" The Jesuit left the room, and, doubtless, availed\nhimself of this momentary exile from the presence of the dying man\nto ask the host for some explanation about this strange penitent, who\ntreated his confessor no better than he would a man servant. The baron\napproached the bed, and wished to speak, but the hand of the Franciscan\nimposed silence upon him.\n\n\"Every moment is precious,\" said the latter, hurriedly. \"You have come\nhere for the competition, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my father.\"\n\n\"You hope to be elected general of the order?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"You know on what conditions only you can possibly attain this high\nposition, which makes one man the master of monarchs, the equal of\npopes?\"\n\n\"Who are you,\" inquired the baron, \"to subject me to these\ninterrogations?\"\n\n\"I am he whom you expected.\"\n\n\"The elector-general?\"\n\n\"I am the elected.\"\n\n\"You are--\"\n\nThe Franciscan did not give him time to reply; he extended his shrunken\nhand, on which glittered the ring of the general of the order. The baron\ndrew back in surprise; and then, immediately afterwards, bowing with the\nprofoundest respect, he exclaimed,--\"Is it possible that you are here,\nmonseigneur; you, in this wretched room; you, upon this miserable bed;\nyou, in search of and selecting the future general, that is, your own\nsuccessor?\"\n\n\"Do not distress yourself about that, monsieur, but fulfil immediately\nthe principal condition, of furnishing the order with a secret of\nimportance, of such importance that one of the greatest courts of Europe\nwill, by your instrumentality, forever be subjected to the order. Well!\ndo you possess the secret which you promised, in your request, addressed\nto the grand council?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur--\"\n\n\"Let us proceed, however, in due order,\" said the monk. \"You are the\nBaron de Wostpur?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"And this letter is from you?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\nThe general of the Jesuits drew a paper from his bundle, and presented\nit to the baron, who glanced at it, and made a sign in the affirmative,\nsaying, \"Yes, monseigneur, this letter is mine.\"\n\n\"Can you show me the reply which the secretary of the grand council\nreturned to you?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the baron, holding towards the Franciscan a letter\nbearing simply the address, \"To his excellency the Baron de Wostpur,\"\nand containing only this phrase, \"From the 15th to the 22nd May,\nFontainebleau, the hotel of the Beau Paon.--A. M. D. G.\" [7]\n\n\"Right,\" said the Franciscan, \"and now speak.\"\n\n\"I have a body of troops, composed of 50,000 men; all the officers are\ngained over. I am encamped on the Danube. In four days I can overthrow\nthe emperor, who is, as you are aware, opposed to the progress of our\norder, and can replace him by whichever of the princes of his family the\norder may determine upon.\" The Franciscan listened, unmoved.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he said.\n\n\"A revolution throughout Europe is included in my plan,\" said the baron.\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur de Wostpur, you will receive a reply; return to\nyour room, and leave Fontainebleau within a quarter of an hour.\" The\nbaron withdrew backwards, as obsequiously as if he were taking leave of\nthe emperor he was ready to betray.\n\n\"There is no secret there,\" murmured the Franciscan, \"it is a plot.\nBesides,\" he added, after a moment's reflection, \"the future of Europe\nis no longer in the hands of the House of Austria.\"\n\nAnd with a pencil he held in his hand, he struck the Baron de Wostpur's\nname from the list.\n\n\"Now for the cardinal,\" he said; \"we ought to get something more serious\nfrom the side of Spain.\"\n\nRaising his head, he perceived the confessor, who was awaiting his\norders as respectfully as a school-boy.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" he said, noticing his submissive air, \"you have been talking\nwith the landlord.\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur; and to the physician.\"\n\n\"To Grisart?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He is here, then?\"\n\n\"He is waiting with the potion he promised.\"\n\n\"Very well; if I require him, I will call; you now understand the great\nimportance of my confession, do you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Then go and fetch me the Spanish Cardinal Herrebia. Make haste. Only,\nas you now understand the matter in hand, you will remain near me, for I\nbegin to feel faint.\"\n\n\"Shall I summon the physician?\"\n\n\"Not yet, not yet... the Spanish cardinal, no one else. Fly.\"\n\nFive minutes afterwards, the cardinal, pale and disturbed, entered the\nlittle room.\n\n\"I am informed, monseigneur,--\" stammered the cardinal.\n\n\"To the point,\" said the Franciscan, in a faint voice, showing the\ncardinal a letter which he had written to the grand council. \"Is that\nyour handwriting?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"And your summons?\"\n\nThe cardinal hesitated to answer. His purple revolted against the mean\ngarb of the poor Franciscan, who stretched out his hand and displayed\nthe ring, which produced its effect, greater in proportion to the\ngreatness of the person over whom the Franciscan exercised his\ninfluence.\n\n\"Quick, the secret, the secret!\" said the dying man, leaning upon his\nconfessor.\n\n\"_Coram isto?_\" inquired the Spanish cardinal. [8]\n\n\"Speak in Spanish,\" said the Franciscan, showing the liveliest\nattention.\n\n\"You are aware, monseigneur,\" said the cardinal, continuing the\nconversation in Castilian, \"that the condition of the marriage of the\nInfanta with the king of France was the absolute renunciation of the\nrights of the said Infanta, as well as of King Louis XIV., to all claim\nto the crown of Spain.\" The Franciscan made a sign in the affirmative.\n\n\"The consequence is,\" continued the cardinal, \"that the peace and\nalliance between the two kingdoms depend upon the observance of that\nclause of the contract.\" A similar sign from the Franciscan. \"Not only\nFrance and Spain,\" continued the cardinal, \"but the whole of Europe\neven, would be violently rent asunder by the faithlessness of either\nparty.\" Another movement of the dying man's head.\n\n\"It further results,\" continued the speaker, \"that the man who might be\nable to foresee events, and to render certain that which is no more than\na vague idea floating in the mind of man, that is to say, the idea of a\nfuture good or evil, would preserve the world from a great catastrophe;\nand the event, which has no fixed certainty even in the brain of him who\noriginated it, could be turned to the advantage of our order.\"\n\n\"_Pronto_, _pronto!_\" murmured the Franciscan, in Spanish, who suddenly\nbecame paler, and leaned upon the priest. The cardinal approached the\near of the dying man, and said, \"Well, monseigneur, I know that the king\nof France has determined that, at the very first pretext, a death for\ninstance, either that of the king of Spain, or that of a brother of the\nInfanta, France will, arms in hand, claim the inheritance, and I have in\nmy possession, already prepared, the plan of policy agreed upon by Louis\nXIV. for this occasion.\"\n\n\"And this plan?\" said the Franciscan.\n\n\"Here it is,\" returned the cardinal.\n\n\"In whose handwriting is it?\"\n\n\"My own.\"\n\n\"Have you anything further to say to me?\"\n\n\"I think I have said a good deal, my lord,\" replied the cardinal.\n\n\"Yes, you have rendered the order a great service. But how did you\nprocure the details, by the aid of which you have constructed your\nplan?\"\n\n\"I have the under-servants of the king of France in my pay, and I obtain\nfrom them all the waste papers, which have been saved from being burnt.\"\n\n\"Very ingenious,\" murmured the Franciscan, endeavoring to smile; \"you\nwill leave this hotel, cardinal, in a quarter of an hour, and a reply\nshall be sent you.\" The cardinal withdrew.\n\n\"Call Grisart, and desire the Venetian Marini to come,\" said the sick\nman.\n\nWhile the confessor obeyed, the Franciscan, instead of striking out the\ncardinal's name, as he had done the baron's, made a cross at the side\nof it. Then, exhausted by the effort, he fell back on his bed, murmuring\nthe name of Dr. Grisart. When he returned to his senses, he had drunk\nabout half of the potion, of which the remainder was left in the glass,\nand he found himself supported by the physician, while the Venetian and\nthe confessor were standing close to the door. The Venetian submitted to\nthe same formalities as his two predecessors, hesitated as they had done\nat the sight of the two strangers, but his confidence restored by the\norder of the general, he revealed that the pope, terrified at the\npower of the order, was weaving a plot for the general expulsion of the\nJesuits, and was tampering with the different courts of Europe in order\nto obtain their assistance. He described the pontiff's auxiliaries,\nhis means of action, and indicated the particular locality in the\nArchipelago where, by a sudden surprise, two cardinals, adepts of\nthe eleventh year, and, consequently, high in authority, were to be\ntransported, together with thirty-two of the principal affiliated\nmembers of Rome. The Franciscan thanked the Signor Marini. It was by no\nmeans a slight service he had rendered the society by denouncing this\npontifical project. The Venetian thereupon received directions to\nset off in a quarter of an hour, and left as radiant as if he already\npossessed the ring, the sign of the supreme authority of the society.\nAs, however, he was departing, the Franciscan murmured to himself:\n\"All these men are either spies, or a sort of police, not one of them a\ngeneral; they have all discovered a plot, but not one of them a secret.\nIt is not by means of ruin, or war, or force, that the Society of Jesus\nis to be governed, but by that mysterious influence moral superiority\nalone confers. No, the man is not yet found, and to complete the\nmisfortune, Heaven strikes me down, and I am dying. Oh! must the society\nindeed fall with me for want of a column to support it? Must death,\nwhich is waiting for me, swallow up with me the future of the order;\nthat future which ten years more of my own life would have rendered\neternal? for that future, with the reign of the new king, is\nopening radiant and full of splendor.\" These words, which had been\nhalf-reflected, half-pronounced aloud, were listened to by the Jesuit\nconfessor with a terror similar to that with which one listens to the\nwanderings of a person attacked by fever, whilst Grisart, with a mind of\nhigher order, devoured them as the revelations of an unknown world, in\nwhich his looks were plunged without ability to comprehend. Suddenly the\nFranciscan recovered himself.\n\n\"Let us finish this,\" he said; \"death is approaching. Oh! just now I\nwas dying resignedly, for I hoped... while now I sink in despair, unless\nthose who remain... Grisart, Grisart, give me to live a single hour\nlonger.\"\n\nGrisart approached the dying monk, and made him swallow a few drops, not\nof the potion which was still left in the glass, but of the contents of\na small bottle he had upon his person.\n\n\"Call the Scotchman!\" exclaimed the Franciscan; \"call the Bremen\nmerchant. Call, call quickly. I am dying. I am suffocated.\"\n\nThe confessor darted forward to seek assistance, as if there had been\nany human strength which could hold back the hand of death, which was\nweighing down the sick man; but, at the threshold of the door, he\nfound Aramis, who, with his finger on his lips, like the statue of\nHarpocrates, the god of silence, by a look motioned him back to the\nend of the apartment. The physician and the confessor, after having\nconsulted each other by looks, made a movement as if to push Aramis\naside, who, however, with two signs of the cross, each made in a\ndifferent manner, transfixed them both in their places.\n\n\"A chief!\" they both murmured.\n\nAramis slowly advanced into the room where the dying man was struggling\nagainst the first attack of the agony which had seized him. As for the\nFranciscan, whether owing to the effect of the elixir, or whether the\nappearance of Aramis had restored his strength, he made a movement, and\nhis eyes glaring, his mouth half open, and his hair damp with sweat, sat\nup upon the bed. Aramis felt that the air of the room was stifling; the\nwindows were closed; the fire was burning upon the hearth; a pair of\ncandles of yellow wax were guttering down in the copper candlesticks,\nand still further increased, by their thick smoke, the temperature of\nthe room. Aramis opened the window, and fixing upon the dying man a\nlook full of intelligence and respect, said to him: \"Monseigneur, pray\nforgive my coming in this manner, before you summoned me, but your state\nalarms me, and I thought you might possibly die before you had seen me,\nfor I am but the sixth upon your list.\"\n\nThe dying man started and looked at the list.\n\n\"You are, therefore, he who was formerly called Aramis, and since, the\nChevalier d'Herblay? You are the bishop of Vannes?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"I know you, I have seen you.\"\n\n\"At the last jubilee, we were with the Holy Father together.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I remember; and you place yourself on the list of\ncandidates?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, I have heard it said that the order required to become\npossessed of a great state secret, and knowing that from modesty you\nhad in anticipation resigned your functions in favor of the person who\nshould be the depositary of such a secret, I wrote to say that I was\nready to compete, possessing alone a secret I believe to be important.\"\n\n\"Speak,\" said the Franciscan; \"I am ready to listen to you, and to judge\nthe importance of the secret.\"\n\n\"A secret of the value of that which I have the honor to confide to\nyou cannot be communicated by word of mouth. Any idea which, when once\nexpressed, has thereby lost its safeguard, and has become vulgarized\nby any manifestation or communication of it whatever, no longer is the\nproperty of him who gave it birth. My words may be overheard by some\nlistener, or perhaps by an enemy; one ought not, therefore, to speak at\nrandom, for, in such a case, the secret would cease to be one.\"\n\n\"How do you propose, then, to convey your secret?\" inquired the dying\nmonk.\n\nWith one hand Aramis signed to the physician and the confessor to\nwithdraw, and with the other he handed to the Franciscan a paper\nenclosed in a double envelope.\n\n\"Is not writing more dangerous still than language?\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" said Aramis, \"for you will find within this envelope\ncharacters which you and I alone can understand.\" The Franciscan looked\nat Aramis with an astonishment which momentarily increased.\n\n\"It is a cipher,\" continued the latter, \"which you used in 1655, and\nwhich your secretary, Juan Jujan, who is dead, could alone decipher, if\nhe were restored to life.\"\n\n\"You knew this cipher, then?\"\n\n\"It was I who taught it him,\" said Aramis, bowing with a gracefulness\nfull of respect, and advancing towards the door as if to leave the room:\nbut a gesture of the Franciscan accompanied by a cry for him to remain,\nrestrained him.\n\n\"_Ecce homo!_\" he exclaimed; then reading the paper a second time, he\ncalled out, \"Approach, approach quickly!\"\n\nAramis returned to the side of the Franciscan, with the same calm\ncountenance and the same respectful manner, unchanged. The Franciscan,\nextending his arm, burnt by the flame of the candle the paper which\nAramis had handed him. Then, taking hold of Aramis's hand, he drew him\ntowards him, and inquired: \"In what manner and by whose means could you\npossibly become acquainted with such a secret?\"\n\n\"Through Madame de Chevreuse, the intimate friend and _confidante_ of\nthe queen.\"\n\n\"And Madame de Chevreuse--\"\n\n\"Is dead.\"\n\n\"Did any others know it?\"\n\n\"A man and a woman only, and they of the lower classes.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Persons who had brought him up.\"\n\n\"What has become of them?\"\n\n\"Dead also. This secret burns like vitriol.\"\n\n\"But you survive?\"\n\n\"No one is aware that I know it.\"\n\n\"And for what length of time have you possessed this secret?\"\n\n\"For the last fifteen years.\"\n\n\"And you have kept it?\"\n\n\"I wished to live.\"\n\n\"And you give it to the order without ambition, without\nacknowledgement?\"\n\n\"I give it to the order with ambition and with a hope of return,\" said\nAramis; \"for if you live, my lord, you will make of me, now you know me,\nwhat I can and ought to be.\"\n\n\"And as I am dying,\" exclaimed the Franciscan, \"I constitute you my\nsuccessor... Thus.\" And drawing off the ring, he passed it on Aramis's\nfinger. Then, turning towards the two spectators of this scene, he said:\n\"Be ye witnesses of this, and testify, if need be, that, sick in body,\nbut sound in mind, I have freely and voluntarily bestowed this ring,\nthe token of supreme authority, upon Monseigneur d'Herblay, bishop\nof Vannes, whom I nominate my successor, and before whom I, an humble\nsinner, about to appear before Heaven, prostrate myself, as an example\nfor all to follow.\" And the Franciscan bowed lowly and submissively,\nwhilst the physician and the Jesuit fell on their knees. Aramis,\neven while he became paler than the dying man himself, bent his looks\nsuccessively upon all the actors of this scene. Profoundly gratified\nambition flowed with life-blood towards his heart.\n\n\"We must lose no time,\" said the Franciscan; \"what I had still to do on\nearth was urgent. I shall never succeed in carrying it out.\"\n\n\"I will do it,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"It is well,\" said the Franciscan, and then turning towards the Jesuit\nand the doctor, he added, \"Leave us alone,\" a direction they instantly\nobeyed.\n\n\"With this sign,\" he said, \"you are the man needed to shake the world\nfrom one end to the other; with this sign you will overthrow; with this\nsign you will edify; _in hoc signo vinces!_\" [9]\n\n\"Close the door,\" continued the Franciscan after a pause. Aramis shut\nand bolted the door, and returned to the side of the Franciscan.\n\n\"The pope is conspiring against the order,\" said the monk; \"the pope\nmust die.\"\n\n\"He shall die,\" said Aramis, quietly.\n\n\"Seven hundred thousand livres are owing to a Bremen merchant of the\nname of Bonstett, who came here to get the guarantee of my signature.\"\n\n\"He shall be paid,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Six knights of Malta, whose names are written here, have discovered,\nby the indiscretion of one of the affiliated of the eleventh year, the\nthree mysteries; it must be ascertained what else these men have done\nwith the secret, to get it back again and bury it.\"\n\n\"It shall be done.\"\n\n\"Three dangerous affiliated members must be sent away into Tibet, there\nto perish; they stand condemned. Here are their names.\"\n\n\"I will see that the sentence be carried out.\"\n\n\"Lastly, there is a lady at Anvers, grand-niece of Ravaillac; she holds\ncertain papers in her hands that compromise the order. There has been\npayable to the family during the last fifty-one years a pension of\nfifty thousand livres. The pension is a heavy one, and the order is not\nwealthy. Redeem the papers, for a sum of money paid down, or, in case of\nrefusal, stop the pension--but run no risk.\"\n\n\"I will quickly decide what is best to be done,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"A vessel chartered from Lima entered the port of Lisbon last week;\nostensibly it is laden with chocolate, in reality with gold. Every ingot\nis concealed by a coating of chocolate. The vessel belongs to the\norder; it is worth seventeen millions of livres; you will see that it is\nclaimed; here are the bills of landing.\"\n\n\"To what port shall I direct it to be taken?\"\n\n\"To Bayonne.\"\n\n\"Before three weeks are over it shall be there, wind and weather\npermitting. Is that all?\" The Franciscan made a sign in the affirmative,\nfor he could no longer speak; the blood rushed to his throat and his\nhead, and gushed from his mouth, his nostrils, and his eyes. The dying\nman had barely time to press Aramis's hand, when he fell in convulsions\nfrom his bed upon the floor. Aramis placed his hand upon the\nFranciscan's heart, but it had ceased to beat. As he stooped down,\nAramis observed that a fragment of the paper he had given the Franciscan\nhad escaped being burnt. He picked it up, and burnt it to the last atom.\nThen, summoning the confessor and the physician, he said to the former:\n\"Your penitent is in heaven; he needs nothing more than prayers and the\nburial bestowed upon the pious dead. Go and prepare what is necessary\nfor a simple interment, such as a poor monk only would require. Go.\"\n\nThe Jesuit left the room. Then, turning towards the physician, and\nobserving his pale and anxious face, he said, in a low tone of voice:\n\"Monsieur Grisart, empty and clean this glass; _there is too much left\nin it of what the grand council desired you to put in_.\"\n\nGrisart, amazed, overcome, completely astounded, almost fell backwards\nin his extreme terror. Aramis shrugged his shoulders in sign of pity,\ntook the glass, and poured out the contents among the ashes of the\nhearth. He then left the room, carrying the papers of the dead man with\nhim.\n\n\n\nChapter LIV. A Mission.\n\nThe next day, or rather the same day (for the events we have just\ndescribed were concluded only at three o'clock in the morning), before\nbreakfast was served, and as the king was preparing to go to mass with\nthe two queens; as Monsieur, with the Chevalier de Lorraine, and a few\nother intimate companions, was mounting his horse to set off for the\nriver, to take one of those celebrated baths with which the ladies\nof the court were so infatuated, as, in fact, no one remained in\nthe chateau, with the exception of Madame who, under the pretext of\nindisposition, would not leave her room; Montalais was seen, or rather\nnot was not seen, to glide stealthily out of the room appropriated to\nthe maids of honor, leading La Valliere after her, who tried to conceal\nherself as much as possible, and both of them, hurrying secretly through\nthe gardens, succeeded, looking round them at every step they took, in\nreaching the thicket. The weather was cloudy, a warm breeze bowed the\nflowers and the shrubs, the burning dust, swept along in clouds by the\nwind, was whirled in eddies towards the trees. Montalais, who, during\ntheir progress, had discharged the functions of a clever scout, advanced\na few steps further, and turning round again, to be quite sure that no\none was either listening or approaching, said to her companion, \"Thank\ngoodness, we are quite alone! Since yesterday every one spies on\nus here, and a circle seems to be drawn round us, as if we were\nplague-stricken.\" La Valliere bent down her head and sighed. \"It is\npositively unheard of,\" continued Montalais; \"from M. Malicorne to M. de\nSaint-Aignan, every one wishes to get hold of our secret. Come, Louise,\nlet us take counsel, you and I, together, in order that I may know what\nto do.\"\n\nLa Valliere lifted towards her companion her beautiful eyes, pure and\ndeep as the azure of a spring sky, \"And I,\" she said, \"will ask you why\nwe have been summoned to Madame's own room? Why have we slept close\nto her apartment, instead of sleeping as usual in our own? Why did you\nreturn so late, and whence are these measures of strict supervision\nwhich have been adopted since this morning, with respect to us both?\"\n\n\"My dear Louise, you answer my question by another, or rather, by ten\nothers, which is not answering me at all. I will tell you all you want\nto know later, and as it is of secondary importance, you can wait. What\nI ask you--for everything will depend upon that--is, whether there is or\nis not any secret?\"\n\n\"I do not know if there is any secret,\" said La Valliere; \"but I\ndo know, for my part at least, that there has been great imprudence\ncommitted. Since the foolish remark I made, and my still more silly\nfainting yesterday, every one here is making remarks about us.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Montalais, laughing, \"speak for yourself and\nfor Tonnay-Charente; for both of you made your declarations of love to\nthe skies, which unfortunately were intercepted.\"\n\nLa Valliere hung down her head. \"Really you overwhelm me,\" she said.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you torture me with your jests.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Louise. These are no jests, for nothing is more serious;\non the contrary, I did not drag you out of the chateau; I did not miss\nattending mass; I did not pretend to have a cold, as Madame did, which\nshe has no more than I have; and, lastly, I did not display ten times\nmore diplomacy than M. Colbert inherited from M. de Mazarin, and makes\nuse of with respect to M. Fouquet, in order to find means of confiding\nmy perplexities to you, for the sole end and purpose that, when at\nlast we were alone, with no one to listen to us, you should deal\nhypocritically with me. No, no; believe me, that when I ask you a\nquestion, it is not from curiosity alone, but really because the\nposition is a critical one. What you said yesterday is now known,--it\nis a text on which every one is discoursing. Every one embellishes it\nto the utmost, and according to his own fancy; you had the honor last\nnight, and you have it still to-day, of occupying the whole court, my\ndear Louise; and the number of tender and witty remarks which have been\nascribed to you, would make Mademoiselle de Scudery and her brother\nburst from very spite, if they were faithfully reported.\"\n\n\"But, dearest Montalais,\" said the poor girl, \"you know better than any\none exactly what I said, since you were present when I said it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. But that is not the question. I have not forgotten a\nsingle syllable you uttered, but did you think what you were saying?\"\n\nLouise became confused. \"What,\" she exclaimed, \"more questions still!\nOh, heavens! when I would give the world to forget what I did say, how\ndoes it happen that every one does all he possibly can to remind me of\nit? Oh, this is indeed terrible!\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"To have a friend who ought to spare me, who might advise me and help me\nto save myself, and yet who is undoing me--is killing me.\"\n\n\"There, there, that will do,\" said Montalais; \"after having said too\nlittle, you now say too much. No one thinks of killing you, nor even of\nrobbing you, even of your secret; I wish to have it voluntarily, and in\nno other way; for the question does not concern your own affairs only,\nbut ours also; and Tonnay-Charente would tell you as I do, if she\nwere here. For, the fact is, that last evening she wished to have\nsome private conversation in our room, and I was going there after the\nManicamp and Malicorne colloquies terminated, when I learned, on my\nreturn, rather late, it is true, that Madame had sequestered her maids\nof honor, and that we were to sleep in her apartments, instead of our\nown. Moreover, Madame has shut up her maids of honor in order that they\nshould not have the time to concert any measures together, and this\nmorning she was closeted with Tonnay-Charente with the same object. Tell\nme, then, to what extent Athenais and I can rely upon you, as we will\ntell you in what way you can rely upon us?\"\n\n\"I do not clearly understand the question you have put,\" said Louise,\nmuch agitated.\n\n\"Hum! and yet, on the contrary, you seem to understand me very well.\nHowever, I will put my questions in a more precise manner, in order that\nyou may not be able, in the slightest degree, to evade them. Listen to\nme: _Do you love M. de Bragelonne?_ That is plain enough, is it not?\"\n\nAt this question, which fell like the first bombshell of a besieging\narmy into a doomed town, Louise started. \"You ask me,\" she exclaimed,\n\"if I love Raoul, the friend of my childhood,--my brother almost?\"\n\n\"No, no, no! Again you evade me, or rather, you wish to escape me. I do\nnot ask if you love Raoul, your childhood's friend,--your brother; but I\nask if you love the Vicomte de Bragelonne, your affianced husband?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! dear Montalais,\" said Louise, \"how severe your tone is!\"\n\n\"You deserve no indulgence,--I am neither more nor less severe than\nusual. I put a question to you, so answer it.\"\n\n\"You certainly do not,\" said Louise, in a choking voice, \"speak to me\nlike a friend; but I will answer you as a true friend.\"\n\n\"Well, do so.\"\n\n\"Very well; my heart is full of scruples and silly feelings of pride,\nwith respect to everything that a woman ought to keep secret, and in\nthis respect no one has ever read into the bottom of my soul.\"\n\n\"That I know very well. If I had read it, I should not interrogate you\nas I have done; I should simply say,--'My good Louise, you have the\nhappiness of an acquaintance with M. de Bragelonne, who is an excellent\nyoung man, and an advantageous match for a girl without fortune. M. de\nla Fere will leave something like fifteen thousand livres a year to his\nson. At a future day, then, you, as this son's wife, will have fifteen\nthousand livres a year; which is not bad. Turn, then, neither to the\nright hand nor to the left, but go frankly to M. de Bragelonne; that\nis to say, to the altar to which he will lead you. Afterwards, why--\nafterwards, according to his disposition, you will be emancipated or\nenslaved; in other words, you will have a right to commit any piece of\nfolly people commit who have either too much liberty or too little.'\nThat is, my dear Louise, what I should have told you at first, if I had\nbeen able to read your heart.\"\n\n\"And I should have thanked you,\" stammered out Louise, \"although the\nadvice does not appear to me to be altogether sound.\"\n\n\"Wait, wait. But immediately after having given you that advice, I\nshould have added,--'Louise, it is very dangerous to pass whole days\nwith your head drooping, your hands unoccupied, your eyes restless and\nfull of thought; it is dangerous to prefer the least frequented paths,\nand no longer be amused with such diversions as gladden young girls'\nhearts; it is dangerous, Louise, to scrawl with the point of your foot,\nas you do, upon the gravel, certain letters it is useless for you to\nefface, but which appear again under your heel, particularly when those\nletters rather resemble the letter L than the letter B; and, lastly, it\nis dangerous to allow the mind to dwell on a thousand wild fancies, the\nfruits of solitude and heartache; these fancies, while they sink into\na young girl's mind, make her cheeks sink in also, so that it is not\nunusual, on such occasions, to find the most delightful persons in\nthe world become the most disagreeable, and the wittiest to become the\ndullest.'\"\n\n\"I thank you, dearest Aure,\" replied La Valliere, gently; \"it is like\nyou to speak to me in this manner, and I thank you for it.\"\n\n\"It was only for the benefit of wild dreamers, such as I have just\ndescribed, that I spoke; do not take any of my words, then, to yourself,\nexcept such as you think you deserve. Stay, I hardly know what story\nrecurs to my memory of some silly or melancholy girl, who was gradually\npining away because she fancied that the prince, or the king, or the\nemperor, whoever it was--and it does not matter much which--had fallen\nin love with her; while on the contrary, the prince, or the king, or the\nemperor, whichever you please, was plainly in love with some one else,\nand--a singular circumstance, one, indeed, which she could not perceive,\nalthough every one around and about her perceived it clearly enough--\nmade use of her as a screen for his own love affair. You laugh as I do,\nat this poor silly girl, do you not, Louise?\"\n\n\"I?--oh! of course,\" stammered Louise, pale as death.\n\n\"And you are right, too, for the thing is amusing enough. The story,\nwhether true or false, amused me, and so I remembered it and told it\nto you. Just imagine then, my good Louise, the mischief that such a\nmelancholy would create in anybody's brain,--a melancholy, I mean, of\nthat kind. For my own part, I resolved to tell you the story; for\nif such a thing were to happen to either of _us_, it would be most\nessential to be assured of its truth; to-day it is a snare, to-morrow\nit would become a jest and mockery, the next day it would mean death\nitself.\" La Valliere started again, and became, if possible, still\npaler.\n\n\"Whenever a king takes notice of us,\" continued Montalais, \"he lets us\nsee it easily enough, and, if we happen to be the object he covets, he\nknows very well how to gain his object. You see, then, Louise, that, in\nsuch circumstances, between young girls exposed to such a danger as the\none in question, the most perfect confidence should exist, in order that\nthose hearts which are not disposed towards melancholy may watch over\nthose likely to become so.\"\n\n\"Silence, silence!\" said La Valliere; \"some one approaches.\"\n\n\"Some one is approaching fast, in fact,\" said Montalais; \"but who can it\npossibly be? Everybody is away, either at mass with the king, or bathing\nwith Monsieur.\"\n\nAt the end of the walk the young girls perceived almost immediately,\nbeneath the arching trees, the graceful carriage and noble stature of a\nyoung man, who, with his sword under his arm and a cloak thrown across\nhis shoulders, booted and spurred besides, saluted them from the\ndistance with a gentle smile. \"Raoul!\" exclaimed Montalais.\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne!\" murmured Louise.\n\n\"A very proper judge to decide upon our difference of opinion,\" said\nMontalais.\n\n\"Oh! Montalais, Montalais, for pity's sake,\" exclaimed La Valliere,\n\"after having been so cruel, show me a little mercy.\" These words,\nuttered with all the fervor of a prayer, effaced all trace of irony, if\nnot from Montalais's heart, at least from her face.\n\n\"Why, you are as handsome as Amadis, Monsieur de Bragelonne,\" she cried\nto Raoul, \"and armed and booted like him.\"\n\n\"A thousand compliments, young ladies,\" replied Raoul, bowing.\n\n\"But why, I ask, are you booted in this manner?\" repeated Montalais,\nwhilst La Valliere, although she looked at Raoul with a surprise equal\nto that of her companion, nevertheless uttered not a word.\n\n\"Why?\" inquired Raoul.\n\n\"Yes!\" ventured Louise.\n\n\"Because I am about to set off,\" said Bragelonne, looking at Louise.\n\nThe young girl seemed as though smitten by some superstitious feeling of\nterror, and tottered. \"You are going away, Raoul!\" she cried; \"and where\nare you going?\"\n\n\"Dearest Louise,\" he replied, with that quiet, composed manner which was\nnatural to him, \"I am going to England.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do in England?\"\n\n\"The king has sent me there.\"\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed Louise and Aure together, involuntarily exchanging\nglances, the conversation which had just been interrupted recurring to\nthem both. Raoul intercepted the glance, but could not understand its\nmeaning, and, naturally enough, attributed it to the interest both the\nyoung girls took in him.\n\n\"His majesty,\" he said, \"has been good enough to remember that the Comte\nde la Fere is high in favor with King Charles II. This morning, as he\nwas on his way to attend mass, the king, seeing me as he passed, signed\nto me to approach, which I accordingly did. 'Monsieur de Bragelonne,'\nhe said to me, 'you will call upon M. Fouquet, who has received from me\nletters for the king of Great Britain; you will be the bearer of them.'\nI bowed. 'Ah!' his majesty added, 'before you leave, you will be good\nenough to take any commissions which Madame may have for the king her\nbrother.'\"\n\n\"Gracious heaven!\" murmured Louise, much agitated, and yet full of\nthought at the same time.\n\n\"So quickly! You are desired to set off in such haste!\" said Montalais,\nalmost paralyzed by this unforeseen event.\n\n\"Properly to obey those whom we respect,\" said Raoul, \"it is necessary\nto obey quickly. Within ten minutes after I had received the order, I\nwas ready. Madame, already informed, is writing the letter which she\nis good enough to do me the honor of intrusting to me. In the meantime,\nlearning from Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente that it was likely you\nwould be in this direction, I came here, and am happy to find you both.\"\n\n\"And both of us very sad, as you see,\" said Montalais, going to Louise's\nassistance, whose countenance was visibly altered.\n\n\"Suffering?\" responded Raoul, pressing Louise's hand with a tender\ncuriosity. \"Your hand is like ice.\"\n\n\"It is nothing.\"\n\n\"This coldness does not reach your heart, Louise, does it?\" inquired the\nyoung man, with a tender smile. Louise raised her head hastily, as if\nthe question had been inspired by some suspicion, and had aroused a\nfeeling of remorse.\n\n\"Oh! you know,\" she said, with an effort, \"that my heart will never be\ncold towards a friend like yourself, Monsieur de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Louise. I know both your heart and your mind; it is not by\nthe touch of the hand that one can judge of an affection like yours. You\nknow, Louise, how devotedly I love you, with what perfect and unreserved\nconfidence I reserve my life for you; will you not forgive me, then, for\nspeaking to you with something like the frankness of a child?\"\n\n\"Speak, Monsieur Raoul,\" said Louise, trembling painfully, \"I am\nlistening.\"\n\n\"I cannot part from you, carrying away with me a thought that tortures\nme; absurd I know it to be, and yet one which rends my very heart.\"\n\n\"Are you going away, then, for any length of time?\" inquired La\nValliere, with faltering utterance, while Montalais turned her head\naside.\n\n\"No; probably I shall not be absent more than a fortnight.\" La Valliere\npressed her hand upon her heart, which felt as though it were breaking.\n\n\"It is strange,\" pursued Raoul, looking at the young girl with a\nmelancholy expression; \"I have often left you when setting off on\nadventures fraught with danger. Then I started joyously enough--my heart\nfree, my mind intoxicated by thoughts of happiness in store for me,\nhopes of which the future was full; and yet I was about to face the\nSpanish cannon, or the halberds of the Walloons. To-day, without the\nexistence of any danger or uneasiness, and by the sunniest path in the\nworld, I am going in search of a glorious recompense, which this mark\nof the king's favor seems to indicate, for I am, perhaps, going to win\n_you_, Louise. What other favor, more precious than yourself, could the\nking confer upon me? Yet, Louise, in very truth I know not how or why,\nbut this happiness and this future seem to vanish before my very eyes\nlike mist--like an idle dream; and I feel here, here at the very bottom\nof my heart, a deep-seated grief, a dejection I cannot overcome--\nsomething heavy, passionless, death-like,--resembling a corpse. Oh!\nLouise, too well do I know why; it is because I have never loved you so\ntruly as now. God help me!\"\n\nAt this last exclamation, which issued as it were from a broken heart,\nLouise burst into tears, and threw herself into Montalais's arms. The\nlatter, although she was not easily moved, felt the tears rush to her\neyes. Raoul noted only the tears Louise shed; his look, however, did not\npenetrate--nay, sought not to penetrate--beyond those tears. He bent his\nknee before her, and tenderly kissed her hand; and it was evident that\nin that kiss he poured out his whole heart.\n\n\"Rise, rise,\" said Montalais to him, ready to cry, \"for Athenais is\ncoming.\"\n\nRaoul rose, brushed his knee with the back of his hand, smiled again\nupon Louise, whose eyes were fixed on the ground, and, having pressed\nMontalais's hand gratefully, he turned round to salute Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente, the sound of whose silken robe was already heard upon\nthe gravel walk. \"Has Madame finished her letter?\" he inquired, when the\nyoung girl came within reach of his voice.\n\n\"Yes, the letter is finished, sealed, and her royal highness is ready to\nreceive you.\"\n\nRaoul, at this remark, hardly gave himself time to salute Athenais, cast\none look at Louise, bowed to Montalais, and withdrew in the direction of\nthe chateau. As he withdrew he again turned round, but at last, at the\nend of the grand walk, it was useless to do so again, as he could no\nlonger see them. The three young girls, on their side, had, with widely\ndifferent feelings, watched him disappear.\n\n\"At last,\" said Athenais, the first to interrupt the silence, \"at last\nwe are alone, free to talk of yesterday's great affair, and to come\nto an understanding upon the conduct it is advisable for us to pursue.\nBesides, if you will listen to me,\" she continued, looking round on\nall sides, \"I will explain to you, as briefly as possible, in the first\nplace, our own duty, such as I imagine it to be, and, if you do\nnot understand a hint, what is Madame's desire on the subject.\" And\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente pronounced these words in such a tone as\nto leave no doubt, in her companion's minds, upon the official character\nwith which she was invested.\n\n\"Madame's desire!\" exclaimed Montalais and La Valliere together.\n\n\"Her _ultimatum_,\" replied Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,\ndiplomatically.\n\n\"But,\" murmured La Valliere, \"does Madame know, then--\"\n\n\"Madame knows more about the matter than we said, even,\" said Athenais,\nin a formal, precise manner. \"Therefore let us come to a proper\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Montalais, \"and I am listening in breathless\nattention.\"\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" murmured Louise, trembling, \"shall I ever survive\nthis cruel evening?\"\n\n\"Oh! do not frighten yourself in that manner,\" said Athenais; \"we have\nfound a remedy.\" So, seating herself between her two companions, and\ntaking each of them by the hand, which she held in her own, she began.\nThe first words were hardly spoke, when they heard a horse galloping\naway over the stones of the public high-road, outside the gates of the\nchateau.\n\n\n\nChapter LV. Happy as a Prince.\n\nAt the very moment he was about entering the chateau, Bragelonne met De\nGuiche. But before having been met by Raoul, De Guiche had met Manicamp,\nwho had met Malicorne. How was it that Malicorne had met Manicamp?\nNothing more simple, for he had awaited his return from mass, where he\nhad accompanied M. de Saint-Aignan. When they met, they congratulated\neach other upon their good fortune, and Manicamp availed himself of\nthe circumstance to ask his friend if he had not a few crowns still\nremaining at the bottom of his pocket. The latter, without expressing\nany surprise at the question, which he perhaps expected, answered that\nevery pocket which is always being drawn upon without anything ever\nbeing put in it, resembles those wells which supply water during the\nwinter, but which gardeners render useless by exhausting during the\nsummer; that his, Malicorne's, pocket certainly was deep, and that\nthere would be a pleasure in drawing on it in times of plenty, but that,\nunhappily, abuse had produced barrenness. To this remark, Manicamp, deep\nin thought, had replied, \"Quite true!\"\n\n\"The question, then, is how to fill it?\" Malicorne added.\n\n\"Of course; but in what way?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier, my dear Monsieur Manicamp.\"\n\n\"So much the better. How?\"\n\n\"A post in Monsieur's household, and the pocket is full again.\"\n\n\"You have the post?\"\n\n\"That is, I have the promise of being nominated.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Yes; but the promise of nomination, without the post itself, is like a\npurse with no money in it.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" Manicamp replied a second time.\n\n\"Let us try for the post, then,\" the candidate had persisted.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" sighed Manicamp, \"an appointment in his royal\nhighness's household is one of the gravest difficulties of our\nposition.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"There is no question that, at the present moment, we cannot ask\nMonsieur for anything.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" \"Because we are not on good terms with him.\"\n\n\"A great absurdity, too,\" said Malicorne, promptly.\n\n\"Bah! and if we were to show Madame any attention,\" said Manicamp,\n\"frankly speaking, do you think we should please Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Precisely; if we show Madame any attention, and do it adroitly,\nMonsieur ought to adore us.\"\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\n\"Either that or we are great fools. Make haste, therefore, M. Manicamp,\nyou who are so able a politician, and make M. de Guiche and his royal\nhighness friendly again.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what did M. de Saint-Aignan tell you, Malicorne?\"\n\n\"Tell me? nothing; he asked me several questions, and that was all.\"\n\n\"Well, was he less discreet, then, with me.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"That the king is passionately in love with Mademoiselle de la\nValliere.\"\n\n\"We knew that already,\" replied Malicorne, ironically; \"and everybody\ntalks about it loud enough for all to know it; but in the meantime, do\nwhat I advise you; speak to M. de Guiche, and endeavor to get him to\nmake advances to Monsieur. Deuce take it! he owes his royal highness\nthat, at least.\"\n\n\"But we must see De Guiche, then?\"\n\n\"There does not seem to be any great difficulty in that; try to see him\nin the same way I tried to see you; wait for him; you know that he is\nnaturally very fond of walking.\"\n\n\"Yes; but whereabouts does he walk?\"\n\n\"What a question to ask! Do you not know that he is in love with\nMadame?\"\n\n\"So it is said.\"\n\n\"Very well; you will find him walking about on the side of the chateau\nwhere her apartments are.\"\n\n\"Stay, my dear Malicorne, you were not mistaken, for here he is coming.\"\n\n\"Why should I be mistaken? Have you ever noticed that I am in the habit\nof making a mistake? Come, we only need to understand each other. Are\nyou in want of money?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Manicamp, mournfully.\n\n\"Well, I want my appointment. Let Malicorne have the appointment, and\nManicamp shall have the money. There is no greater difficulty in the way\nthan that.\"\n\n\"Very well; in that case make yourself easy. I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Do.\"\n\nDe Guiche approached, Malicorne stepped aside, and Manicamp caught\nhold of De Guiche, who was thoughtful and melancholy. \"Tell me, my dear\ncomte, what rhyme you were trying to find,\" said Manicamp. \"I have an\nexcellent one to match yours, particularly if yours ends in _ame_.\"\n\nDe Guiche shook his head, and recognizing a friend, he took him by the\narm. \"My dear Manicamp,\" he said, \"I am in search of something very\ndifferent from a rhyme.\"\n\n\"What is it you are looking for?\"\n\n\"You will help me to find what I am in search of,\" continued the comte:\n\"you who are such an idle fellow, in other words, a man with a mind full\nof ingenious devices.\"\n\n\"I am getting my ingenuity ready, then, my dear comte.\"\n\n\"This is the state of the case, then: I wish to approach a particular\nhouse, where I have some business.\"\n\n\"You must get near the house, then,\" said Manicamp.\n\n\"Very good; but in this house dwells a husband who happens to be\njealous.\"\n\n\"Is he more jealous than the dog Cerberus?\"\n\n\"Not more, but quite as much so.\"\n\n\"Has he three mouths, as that obdurate guardian of the infernal regions\nhad? Do not shrug your shoulders, my dear comte: I put the question\nto you with an excellent reason, since poets pretend that, in order to\nsoften Monsieur Cerberus, the visitor must take something enticing\nwith him--a cake, for instance. Therefore, I, who view the matter in a\nprosaic light, that is to say in the light of reality, I say: one cake\nis very little for three mouths. If your jealous husband has three\nmouths, comte, get three cakes.\"\n\n\"Manicamp, I can get such advice as that from M. de Beautru.\"\n\n\"In order to get better advice,\" said Manicamp, with a comical\nseriousness of expression, \"you will be obliged to adopt a more precise\nformula than you have used towards me.\"\n\n\"If Raoul were here,\" said De Guiche, \"he would be sure to understand\nme.\"\n\n\"So I think, particularly if you said to him: 'I should very much\nlike to see Madame a little nearer, but I fear Monsieur, because he is\njealous.'\"\n\n\"Manicamp!\" cried the comte, angrily, and endeavoring to overwhelm his\ntormentor by a look, who did not, however, appear to be in the slightest\ndegree disturbed by it.\n\n\"What is the matter now, my dear comte?\" inquired Manicamp.\n\n\"What! is it thus you blaspheme the most sacred of names?\"\n\n\"What names?\"\n\n\"Monsieur! Madame! the highest names in the kingdom.\"\n\n\"You are very strangely mistaken, my dear comte. I never mentioned the\nhighest names in the kingdom. I merely answered you in reference to the\nsubject of a jealous husband, whose name you did not tell me, and who,\nas a matter of course, has a wife. I therefore replied to you, in order\nto see Madame, you must get a little more intimate with Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Double-dealer that you are,\" said the comte, smiling; \"was that what\nyou said?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\n\"Very good; what then?\"\n\n\"Now,\" added Manicamp, \"let the question be regarding the Duchess--or\nthe Duke--; very well, I shall say: Let us get into the house in\nsome way or other, for that is a tactic which cannot in any case be\nunfavorable to your love affair.\"\n\n\"Ah! Manicamp, if you could but find me a pretext, a good pretext.\"\n\n\"A pretext; I can find you a hundred, nay, a thousand. If Malicorne were\nhere, he would have already hit upon a thousand excellent pretexts.\"\n\n\"Who is Malicorne?\" replied De Guiche, half-shutting his eyes, like a\nperson reflecting, \"I seem to know the name.\"\n\n\"Know him! I should think so: you owe his father thirty thousand\ncrowns.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! so it's that worthy fellow from Orleans.\"\n\n\"Whom you promised an appointment in Monsieur's household; not the\njealous husband, but the other.\"\n\n\"Well, then, since your friend Malicorne is such an inventive genius,\nlet him find me a means of being adored by Monsieur, and a pretext to\nmake my peace with him.\"\n\n\"Very good: I'll talk to him about it.\"\n\n\"But who is that coming?\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"\n\n\"Raoul! yes, it is he,\" said De Guiche, as he hastened forward to meet\nhim. \"You here, Raoul?\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"Yes: I was looking for you to say farewell,\" replied Raoul, warmly,\npressing the comte's hand. \"How do you do, Monsieur Manicamp?\"\n\n\"How is this, vicomte, you are leaving us?\"\n\n\"Yes, a mission from the king.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To London. On leaving you, I am going to Madame; she has a letter to\ngive me for his majesty, Charles II.\"\n\n\n\"You will find her alone, for Monsieur has gone out; gone to bathe, in\nfact.\"\n\n\"In that case, you, who are one of Monsieur's gentlemen in waiting, will\nundertake to make my excuses to him. I would have waited in order to\nreceive any directions he might have to give me, if the desire for my\nimmediate departure had not been intimated to me by M. Fouquet on behalf\nof his majesty.\"\n\nManicamp touched De Guiche's elbow, saying, \"There's a pretext for you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne's excuses.\"\n\n\"A weak pretext,\" said De Guiche.\n\n\"An excellent one, if Monsieur is not angry with you; but a paltry one\nif he bears you ill-will.\"\n\n\"You are right, Manicamp; a pretext, however poor it may be, is all I\nrequire. And so, a pleasant journey to you, Raoul!\" And the two friends\ntook a warm leave of each other.\n\nFive minutes afterwards Raoul entered Madame's apartments, as\nMademoiselle de Montalais had begged him to do. Madame was still seated\nat the table where she had written her letter. Before her was still\nburning the rose-colored taper she had used to seal it. Only in her deep\nreflection, for Madame seemed to be buried in thought, she had forgotten\nto extinguish the light. Bragelonne was a very model of elegance in\nevery way; it was impossible to see him once without always remembering\nhim; and not only had Madame seen him once, but it will not be\nforgotten he was one of the very first who had gone to meet her, and had\naccompanied her from Le Havre to Paris. Madame preserved therefore an\nexcellent recollection of him.\n\n\"Ah! M. de Bragelonne,\" she said to him, \"you are going to see my\nbrother, who will be delighted to pay to the son a portion of the debt\nof gratitude he contracted with the father.\"\n\n\"The Comte de la Fere, Madame, has been abundantly recompensed for the\nlittle service he had the happiness to render the king, by the kindness\nmanifested towards him, and it is I who will have to convey to his\nmajesty the assurance of the respect, devotion, and gratitude of both\nfather and son.\"\n\n\"Do you know my brother?\"\n\n\"No, your highness; I shall have the honor of seeing his majesty for the\nfirst time.\"\n\n\"You require no recommendation to him. At all events, however, if you\nhave any doubt about your personal merit, take me unhesitatingly for\nyour surety.\"\n\n\"Your royal highness overwhelms me with kindness.\"\n\n\"No! M. de Bragelonne, I well remember that we were fellow-travelers\nonce, and that I remarked your extreme prudence in the midst of the\nextravagant absurdities committed, on both sides, by two of the greatest\nsimpletons in the world,--M. de Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham. Let\nus not speak of them, however; but of yourself. Are you going to England\nto remain there permanently? Forgive my inquiry: it is not curiosity,\nbut a desire to be of service to you in anything I can.\"\n\n\"No, Madame; I am going to England to fulfil a mission which his majesty\nhas been kind enough to confide to me--nothing more.\"\n\n\"And you propose to return to France?\"\n\n\"As soon as I have accomplished my mission; unless, indeed, his majesty,\nKing Charles II., should have other orders for me.\"\n\n\"He well beg you, at the very least, I am sure, to remain near him as\nlong as possible.\"\n\n\"In that case, as I shall not know how to refuse, I will now beforehand\nentreat your royal highness to have the goodness to remind the king of\nFrance that one of his devoted servants is far away from him.\"\n\n\"Take care that when you _are_ recalled, you do not consider his command\nan abuse of power.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, Madame.\"\n\n\"The court of France is not easily matched, I am aware, but yet we have\nsome pretty women at the court of England also.\"\n\nRaoul smiled.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Madame, \"yours is a smile which portends no good to my\ncountrywomen. It is as though you were telling them, Monsieur de\nBragelonne: 'I visit you, but I leave my heart on the other side of the\nChannel.' Did not your smile indicate that?\"\n\n\"Your highness is gifted with the power of reading the inmost depths\nof the soul, and you will understand, therefore, why, at present, any\nprolonged residence at the court of England would be a matter of the\ndeepest regret.\"\n\n\"And I need not inquire if so gallant a knight is recompensed in\nreturn?\"\n\n\"I have been brought up, Madame, with her whom I love, and I believe our\naffection is mutual.\"\n\n\"In that case, do not delay your departure, Monsieur de Bragelonne,\nand delay not your return, for on your return we shall see two persons\nhappy; for I hope no obstacle exists to your felicity.\"\n\n\"There is a great obstacle, Madame.\"\n\n\"Indeed! what is it?\"\n\n\"The king's wishes on the subject.\"\n\n\"The king opposes your marriage?\"\n\n\"He postpones it, at least. I solicited his majesty's consent through\nthe Comte de la Fere, and, without absolutely refusing it, he positively\nsaid it must be deferred.\"\n\n\"Is the young lady whom you love unworthy of you, then?\"\n\n\"She is worthy of a king's affection, Madame.\"\n\n\"I mean, she is not, perhaps, of birth equal to your own.\"\n\n\"Her family is excellent.\"\n\n\"Is she young, beautiful?\"\n\n\"She is seventeen, and, in my opinion, exceedingly beautiful.\"\n\n\"Is she in the country, or at Paris?\"\n\n\"She is here at Fontainebleau, Madame.\"\n\n\"At the court?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do I know her?\"\n\n\"She has the honor to form one of your highness's household.\"\n\n\"Her name?\" inquired the princess, anxiously; \"if indeed,\" she added,\nhastily, \"her name is not a secret.\"\n\n\"No, Madame, my affection is too pure for me to make a secret of it to\nany one, and with still greater reason to your royal highness, whose\nkindness towards me has been so extreme. It is Mademoiselle Louise de la\nValliere.\"\n\nMadame could not restrain an exclamation, in which a feeling\nstronger than surprise might have been detected. \"Ah!\" she said, \"La\nValliere--she who yesterday--\" she paused, and then continued, \"she who\nwas taken ill, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame; it was only this morning that I heard of the accident that\nhad befallen her.\"\n\n\"Did you see her before you came to me?\"\n\n\"I had the honor of taking leave of her.\"\n\n\"And you say,\" resumed Madame, making a powerful effort over herself,\n\"that the king has--deferred your marriage with this young girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, deferred it.\"\n\n\"Did he assign any reason for this postponement?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"How long is it since the Comte de la Fere preferred his request to the\nking?\"\n\n\"More than a month, Madame.\"\n\n\"It is very singular,\" said the princess, as something like a film\nclouded her eyes.\n\n\"A month?\" she repeated.\n\n\"About a month.\"\n\n\"You are right, vicomte,\" said the princess, with a smile, in which De\nBragelonne might have remarked a kind of restraint; \"my brother must not\nkeep you too long in England; set off at once, and in the first letter I\nwrite to England, I will claim you in the king's name.\" And Madame rose\nto place her letter in Bragelonne's hands. Raoul understood that his\naudience was at an end; he took the letter, bowed lowly to the princess,\nand left the room.\n\n\"A month!\" murmured the princess; \"could I have been blind, then, to so\ngreat an extent, and could he have loved her for this last month?\"\nAnd as Madame had nothing to do, she sat down to begin a letter to her\nbrother, the postscript of which was a summons for Bragelonne to return.\n\nThe Comte de Guiche, as we have seen, had yielded to the pressing\npersuasions of Manicamp, and allowed himself to be led to the stables,\nwhere they desired their horses to be got ready for them; then, by one\nof the side paths, a description of which has already been given,\nthey advanced to meet Monsieur, who, having just finished bathing, was\nreturning towards the chateau, wearing a woman's veil to protect his\nface from getting burnt by the sun, which was shining very brightly.\nMonsieur was in one of those fits of good humor to which the admiration\nof his own good looks sometimes gave occasion. As he was bathing he\nhad been able to compare the whiteness of his body with that of the\ncourtiers, and, thanks to the care which his royal highness took of\nhimself, no one, not even the Chevalier de Lorraine, was able to stand\nthe comparison. Monsieur, moreover, had been tolerably successful in\nswimming, and his muscles having been exercised by the healthy immersion\nin the cool water, he was in a light and cheerful state of mind and\nbody. So that, at the sight of Guiche, who advanced to meet him at a\nhand gallop, mounted upon a magnificent white horse, the prince could\nnot restrain an exclamation of delight.\n\n\"I think matters look well,\" said Manicamp, who fancied he could read\nthis friendly disposition upon his royal highness's countenance.\n\n\"Good day, De Guiche, good day,\" exclaimed the prince.\n\n\"Long life to your royal highness!\" replied De Guiche, encouraged by the\ntone of Philip's voice; \"health, joy, happiness, and prosperity to your\nhighness.\"\n\n\"Welcome, De Guiche, come on my right side, but keep your horse in hand,\nfor I wish to return at a walking pace under the cool shade of these\ntrees.\"\n\n\"As you please, monseigneur,\" said De Guiche, taking his place on the\nprince's right as he had been invited to do.\n\n\"Now, my dear De Guiche,\" said the prince, \"give me a little news\nof that De Guiche whom I used to know formerly, and who used to pay\nattentions to my wife.\"\n\nGuiche blushed to the very whites of his eyes, while Monsieur burst out\nlaughing, as though he had made the wittiest remark in the world. The\nfew privileged courtiers who surrounded Monsieur thought it their duty\nto follow his example, although they had not heard the remark, and a\nnoisy burst of laughter immediately followed, beginning with the first\ncourtier, passing on through the whole company, and only terminating\nwith the last. De Guiche, although blushing scarlet, put a good\ncountenance on the matter; Manicamp looked at him.\n\n\"Ah! monseigneur,\" replied De Guiche, \"show a little charity towards\nsuch a miserable fellow as I am: do not hold me up to the ridicule of\nthe Chevalier de Lorraine.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"If he hears you ridicule me, he will go beyond your highness, and will\nshow no pity.\"\n\n\"About your passion and the princess, do you mean?\"\n\n\"For mercy's sake, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Come, come, De Guiche, confess that you _did_ get a little sweet upon\nMadame.\"\n\n\"I will never confess such a thing, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Out of respect for me, I suppose; but I release you from your respect,\nDe Guiche. Confess, as if it were simply a question about Mademoiselle\nde Chalais or Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"\n\nThen breaking off, he said, beginning to laugh again, \"Comte, that\nwasn't at all bad!--a remark like a sword, which cuts two ways at once.\nI hit you and my brother at the same time, Chalais and La Valliere, your\naffianced bride and his future lady love.\"\n\n\"Really, monseigneur,\" said the comte, \"you are in a most brilliant humor\nto-day.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I feel well, and then I am pleased to see you again. But\nyou were angry with me, were you not?\"\n\n\"I, monseigneur? Why should I have been so?\"\n\n\"Because I interfered with your sarabands and your other Spanish\namusements. Nay, do not deny it. On that day you left the princess's\napartments with your eyes full of fury; that brought you ill-luck, for\nyou danced in the ballet yesterday in a most wretched manner. Now don't\nget sulky, De Guiche, for it does you no good, but makes you look like a\ntame bear. If the princess did not look at you attentively yesterday, I\nam quite sure of one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that, monseigneur? Your highness alarms me.\"\n\n\"She has quite forsworn you now,\" said the prince, with a burst of loud\nlaughter.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" thought Manicamp, \"rank has nothing to do with it, and all\nmen are alike.\"\n\nThe prince continued: \"At all events, you have now returned, and it is\nto be hoped that the chevalier will become amiable again.\"\n\n\"How so, monseigneur: and by what miracle can I exercise such an\ninfluence over M. de Lorraine?\"\n\n\"The matter is very simple, he is jealous of you.\"\n\n\"Bah! it is not possible.\"\n\n\"It is the case, though.\"\n\n\"He does me too much honor.\"\n\n\"The fact is, that when you are here, he is full of kindness and\nattention, but when you are gone he makes me suffer a perfect martyrdom.\nI am like a see-saw. Besides, you do not know the idea that has struck\nme?\"\n\n\"I do not even suspect it.\"\n\n\"Well, then; when you were in exile--for you really were exiled, my poor\nDe Guiche--\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed; but whose fault was it?\" said De Guiche,\npretending to speak in an angry tone.\n\n\"Not mine, certainly, my dear comte,\" replied his royal highness, \"upon\nmy honor, I did not ask for the king to exile you--\"\n\n\"No, not you, monseigneur, I am well aware; but--\"\n\n\"But Madame; well, as far as that goes, I do not say it was not the\ncase. Why, what the deuce did you do or say to Madame?\"\n\n\"Really, monseigneur--\"\n\n\"Women, I know, have their grudges, and my wife is not free from\ncaprices of that nature. But if she were the cause of your being exiled\nI bear you no ill-will.\"\n\n\"In that case, monseigneur,\" said De Guiche. \"I am not altogether\nunhappy.\"\n\nManicamp, who was following closely behind De Guiche and who did\nnot lose a word of what the prince was saying, bent down to his very\nshoulders over his horse's neck, in order to conceal the laughter he\ncould not repress.\n\n\"Besides, your exile started a project in my head.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"When the chevalier--finding you were no longer here, and sure of\nreigning undisturbed--began to bully me, I, observing that my wife, in\nthe most perfect contrast to him, was most kind and amiable towards me\nwho had neglected her so much, the idea occurred to me of becoming a\nmodel husband--a rarity, a curiosity, at the court; and I had an idea of\ngetting very fond of my wife.\"\n\nDe Guiche looked at the prince with a stupefied expression of\ncountenance, which was not assumed.\n\n\"Oh! monseigneur,\" De Guiche stammered out; \"surely, that never\nseriously occurred to you.\"\n\n\"Indeed it did. I have some property that my brother gave me on my\nmarriage; she has some money of her own, and not a little either, for\nshe gets money from her brother and brother-in-law of England and France\nat the same time. Well! we should have left the court. I should have\nretired to my chateau at Villers-Cotterets, situated in the middle of a\nforest, in which we should have led a most sentimental life in the\nvery same spot where my grandfather, Henry IV., sojourned with La Belle\nGabrielle. What do you think of that idea, De Guiche?\"\n\n\"Why, it is enough to make one shiver, monseigneur,\" replied De Guiche,\nwho shuddered in reality.\n\n\"Ah! I see you would never be able to endure being exiled a second\ntime.\"\n\n\"I, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"I will not carry you off with us, as I had first intended.\"\n\n\"What, with you, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Yes; if the idea should occur to me again of taking a dislike to the\ncourt.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not let that make any difference, monseigneur; I would follow\nyour highness to the end of the world.\"\n\n\"Clumsy fellow that you are!\" said Manicamp, grumblingly, pushing his\nhorse towards De Guiche, so as almost to unseat him, and then, as\nhe passed close to him, as if he had lost command over the horse, he\nwhispered, \"For goodness' sake, think what you are saying.\"\n\n\"Well, it is agreed, then,\" said the prince; \"since you are so devoted\nto me, I shall take you with me.\"\n\n\"Anywhere, monseigneur,\" replied De Guiche in a joyous tone, \"whenever\nyou like, and at once, too. Are you ready?\"\n\nAnd De Guiche, laughingly, gave his horse the rein, and galloped forward\na few yards.\n\n\"One moment,\" said the prince. \"Let us go to the chateau first.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Why, to take my wife, of course.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked De Guiche.\n\n\"Why, since I tell you that it is a project of conjugal affection, it is\nnecessary I should take my wife with me.\"\n\n\"In that case, monseigneur,\" replied the comte, \"I am greatly concerned,\nbut no De Guiche for you.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Yes.--Why do you take Madame with you?\"\n\n\"Because I begin to fancy I love her,\" said the prince.\n\nDe Guiche turned slightly pale, but endeavored to preserve his seeming\ncheerfulness.\n\n\"If you love Madame, monseigneur,\" he said, \"that ought to be quite\nenough for you, and you have no further need of your friends.\"\n\n\"Not bad, not bad,\" murmured Manicamp.\n\n\"There, your fear of Madame has begun again,\" replied the prince.\n\n\"Why, monseigneur, I have experienced that to my cost; a woman who was\nthe cause of my being exiled!\"\n\n\"What a revengeful disposition you have, De Guiche, how virulently you\nbear malice.\"\n\n\"I should like the case to be your own, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Decidedly, then, that was the reason why you danced so badly yesterday;\nyou wished to revenge yourself, I suppose, by trying to make Madame make\na mistake in her dancing; ah! that is very paltry, De Guiche, and I will\ntell Madame of it.\"\n\n\"You may tell her whatever you please, monseigneur, for her highness\ncannot hate me more than she does.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, you are exaggerating; and this because merely of the\nfortnight's sojourn in the country she imposed on you.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, a fortnight is a fortnight; and when the time is passed in\ngetting sick and tired of everything, a fortnight is an eternity.\"\n\n\"So that you will not forgive her?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Come, come, De Guiche, be a better disposed fellow than that. I wish\nto make your peace with her; you will find, in conversing with her,\nthat she has no malice or unkindness in her nature, and that she is very\ntalented.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur--\"\n\n\"You will see that she can receive her friends like a princess, and\nlaugh like a citizen's wife; you will see that, when she pleases, she\ncan make the pleasant hours pass like minutes. Come, De Guiche, you must\nreally make up your differences with my wife.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Manicamp to himself, \"the prince is a husband whose\nwife's name will bring him ill-luck, and King Candaules, of old, was a\ntiger beside his royal highness.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" added the prince, \"I am sure you will make it up with\nmy wife: I guarantee you will do so. Only, I must show you the way now.\nThere is nothing commonplace about her: it is not every one who takes\nher fancy.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur--\"\n\n\"No resistance, De Guiche, or I shall get out of temper,\" replied the\nprince.\n\n\"Well, since he will have it so,\" murmured Manicamp, in Guiche's ear,\n\"do as he wants you to do.\"\n\n\"Well, monseigneur,\" said the comte, \"I obey.\"\n\n\"And to begin,\" resumed the prince, \"there will be cards, this evening,\nin Madame's apartment; you will dine with me, and I will take you there\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Oh! as for that, monseigneur,\" objected De Guiche, \"you will allow me\nto object.\"\n\n\"What, again! this is positive rebellion.\"\n\n\"Madame received me too indifferently, yesterday, before the whole\ncourt.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said the prince, laughing.\n\n\"Nay, so much so, indeed, that she did not even answer me when I\naddressed her; it may be a good thing to have no self-respect at all,\nbut to have too little is not enough, as the saying is.\"\n\n\"Comte! after dinner, you will go to your own apartments and dress\nyourself, and then you will come to fetch me. I shall wait for you.\"\n\n\"Since your highness absolutely commands it.\"\n\n\"Positively.\"\n\n\"He will not lose his hold,\" said Manicamp; \"these are the things to\nwhich husbands cling most obstinately. Ah! what a pity M. Moliere could\nnot have heard this man; he would have turned him into verse if he had.\"\n\nThe prince and his court, chatting in this manner, returned to the\ncoolest apartments of the chateau.\n\n\"By the by,\" said De Guiche, as they were standing by the door, \"I had a\ncommission for your royal highness.\"\n\n\"Execute it, then.\"\n\n\"M. de Bragelonne has, by the king's order, set off for London, and he\ncharged me with his respects for you; monseigneur.\"\n\n\"A pleasant journey to the vicomte, whom I like very much. Go and dress\nyourself, De Guiche, and come back for me. If you don't come back--\"\n\n\"What will happen, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"I will have you sent to the Bastile.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said De Guiche, laughing, \"his royal highness, monseigneur, is\ndecidedly the counterpart of her royal highness, Madame. Madame gets\nme sent into exile, because she does not care for me sufficiently; and\nmonseigneur gets me imprisoned, because he cares for me too much. I\nthank monseigneur, and I thank Madame.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the prince, \"you are a delightful companion, and you\nknow I cannot do without you. Return as soon as you can.\"\n\n\"Very well; but I am in the humor to prove myself difficult to be\npleased, in _my_ turn, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"So, I will not return to your royal highness, except upon one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"I want to oblige the friend of one of my friends.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Malicorne.\"\n\n\"An ugly name.\"\n\n\"But very well borne, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"That may be. Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I owe M. Malicorne a place in your household, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"What kind of a place?\"\n\n\"Any kind of a place; a supervision of some sort or another, for\ninstance.\"\n\n\"That happens very fortunately, for yesterday I dismissed my chief usher\nof the apartments.\"\n\n\"That will do admirably. What are his duties?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except to look about and make his report.\"\n\n\"A sort of interior police?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Ah, how excellently that will suit Malicorne,\" Manicamp ventured to\nsay.\n\n\"You know the person we are speaking of, M. Manicamp?\" inquired the\nprince.\n\n\"Intimately, monseigneur. He is a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"And your opinion is?\"\n\n\"That your highness could never get a better usher of the apartments\nthan he will make.\"\n\n\"How much does the appointment bring in?\" inquired the comte of the\nprince.\n\n\"I don't know at all, only I have always been told that he could make as\nmuch as he pleased when he was thoroughly in earnest.\"\n\n\"What do you call being thoroughly in earnest, prince?\"\n\n\"It means, of course, when the functionary in question is a man who has\nhis wits about him.\"\n\n\"In that case I think your highness will be content, for Malicorne is as\nsharp as the devil himself.\"\n\n\"Good! the appointment will be an expensive one for me, in that case,\"\nreplied the prince, laughing. \"You are making me a positive present,\ncomte.\"\n\n\"I believe so, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Well, go and announce to your M. Melicorne--\"\n\n\"Malicorne, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I shall never get hold of that name.\"\n\n\"You say Manicamp very well, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ought to say Malicorne very well, too. The alliteration will help\nme.\"\n\n\"Say what you like, monseigneur, I can promise you your inspector of\napartments will not be annoyed; he has the very happiest disposition\nthat can be met with.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my dear De Guiche, inform him of his nomination. But,\nstay--\"\n\n\"What is it, monseigneur?\"\n\n\"I wish to see him beforehand; if he be as ugly as his name, I retract\nevery word I have said.\"\n\n\"Your highness knows him, for you have already seen him at the Palais\nRoyal; nay, indeed, it was I who presented him to you.\"\n\n\"Ah, I remember now--not a bad-looking fellow.\"\n\n\"I know you must have noticed him, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes. You see, De Guiche, I do not wish that either my wife or\nmyself should have ugly faces before our eyes. My wife will have all her\nmaids of honor pretty; I, all the gentlemen about me good-looking. In\nthis way, De Guiche, you see, that any children we may have will run a\ngood chance of being pretty, if my wife and myself have handsome models\nbefore us.\"\n\n\"Most magnificently argued, monseigneur,\" said Manicamp, showing his\napproval by look and voice at the same time.\n\nAs for De Guiche, he very probably did not find the argument so\nconvincing, for he merely signified his opinion by a gesture, which,\nmoreover, exhibited in a marked manner some indecision of mind on the\nsubject. Manicamp went off to inform Malicorne of the good news he had\njust learned. De Guiche seemed very unwilling to take his departure\nfor the purpose of dressing himself. Monsieur, singing, laughing, and\nadmiring himself, passed away the time until the dinner-hour, in a frame\nof mind that justified the proverb of \"Happy as a prince.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LVI. Story of a Dryad and a Naiad.\n\nEvery one had partaken of the banquet at the chateau, and afterwards\nassumed their full court dresses. The usual hour for the repast was\nfive o'clock. If we say, then, that the repast occupied an hour, and\nthe toilette two hours, everybody was ready about eight o'clock in the\nevening. Towards eight o'clock, then, the guests began to arrive\nat Madame's, for we have already intimated that it was Madame who\n\"received\" that evening. And at Madame's _soirees_ no one failed to\nbe present; for the evenings passed in her apartments always had that\nperfect charm about them which the queen, that pious and excellent\nprincess, had not been able to confer upon her _reunions_. For,\nunfortunately, one of the advantages of goodness of disposition is that\nit is far less amusing than wit of an ill-natured character. And yet,\nlet us hasten to add, that such a style of wit could not be assigned\nto Madame, for her disposition of mind, naturally of the very highest\norder, comprised too much true generosity, too many noble impulses\nand high-souled thoughts, to warrant her being termed ill-natured. But\nMadame was endowed with a spirit of resistance--a gift frequently fatal\nto its possessor, for it breaks where another disposition would have\nbent; the result was that blows did not become deadened upon her as upon\nwhat might be termed the cotton-wadded feelings of Maria Theresa.\nHer heart rebounded at each attack, and therefore, whenever she was\nattacked, even in a manner that almost stunned her, she returned blow\nfor blow to any one imprudent enough to tilt against her.\n\nWas this really maliciousness of disposition or simply waywardness of\ncharacter? We regard those rich and powerful natures as like the tree\nof knowledge, producing good and evil at the same time; a double branch,\nalways blooming and fruitful, of which those who wish to eat know how\nto detect the good fruit, and from which the worthless and frivolous die\nwho have eaten of it--a circumstance which is by no means to be regarded\nas a great misfortune. Madame, therefore, who had a well-disguised\nplan in her mind of constituting herself the second, if not even the\nprincipal, queen of the court, rendered her receptions delightful\nto all, from the conversation, the opportunities of meeting, and the\nperfect liberty she allowed every one of making any remark he pleased,\non the condition, however, that the remark was amusing or sensible. And\nit will hardly be believed, that, by that means, there was less talking\namong the society Madame assembled together than elsewhere. Madame hated\npeople who talked much, and took a remarkably cruel revenge upon them,\nfor she allowed them to talk. She disliked pretension, too, and never\noverlooked that defect, even in the king himself. It was more than a\nweakness of Monsieur, and the princess had undertaken the amazing task\nof curing him of it. As for the rest, poets, wits, beautiful women, all\nwere received by her with the air of a mistress superior to her slaves.\nSufficiently meditative in her liveliest humors to make even poets\nmeditate; sufficiently pretty to dazzle by her attractions, even among\nthe prettiest; sufficiently witty for the most distinguished persons\nwho were present, to be listened to with pleasure--it will easily be\nbelieved that the _reunions_ held in Madame's apartments must naturally\nhave proved very attractive. All who were young flocked there, and when\nthe king himself happens to be young, everybody at court is so too.\nAnd so, the older ladies of the court, the strong-minded women of the\nregency, or of the last reign, pouted and sulked at their ease; but\nothers only laughed at the fits of sulkiness in which these venerable\nindividuals indulged, who had carried the love of authority so far as\neven to take command of bodies of soldiers in the wars of the Fronde,\nin order, as Madame asserted, not to lose their influence over men\naltogether. As eight o'clock struck her royal highness entered the great\ndrawing-room accompanied by her ladies in attendance, and found several\ngentlemen belonging to the court already there, having been waiting for\nsome minutes. Among those who had arrived before the hour fixed for the\nreception she looked round for one who, she thought, ought to have been\nfirst in attendance, but he was not there. However, almost at the very\nmoment she completed her investigation, Monsieur was announced. Monsieur\nlooked splendid. All the precious stones and jewels of Cardinal Mazarin,\nwhich of course that minister could not do otherwise than leave; all the\nqueen-mother's jewels as well as a few belonging to his wife--Monsieur\nwore them all, and he was as dazzling as the rising sun. Behind him\nfollowed De Guiche, with hesitating steps and an air of contrition\nadmirably assumed; De Guiche wore a costume of French-gray velvet,\nembroidered with silver, and trimmed with blue ribbons: he wore also\nMechlin lace as rare and beautiful in its own way as the jewels of\nMonsieur in theirs. The plume in his hat was red. Madame, too, wore\nseveral colors, and preferred red for embroidery, gray for dress, and\nblue for flowers. M. de Guiche, dressed as we have described, looked so\nhandsome that he excited every one's observation. An interesting pallor\nof complexion, a languid expression of the eyes, his white hands seen\nthrough the masses of lace that covered them, the melancholy expression\nof his mouth--it was only necessary, indeed, to see M. de Guiche to\nadmit that few men at the court of France could hope to equal him. The\nconsequence was that Monsieur, who was pretentious enough to fancy he\ncould eclipse a star even, if a star had adorned itself in a similar\nmanner to himself, was, on the contrary, completely eclipsed in all\nimaginations, which are silent judges certainly, but very positive and\nfirm in their convictions. Madame looked at De Guiche lightly, but light\nas her look had been, it brought a delightful color to his face. In\nfact, Madame found De Guiche so handsome and so admirably dressed, that\nshe almost ceased regretting the royal conquest she felt she was on the\npoint of escaping her. Her heart, therefore, sent the blood to her face.\nMonsieur approached her. He had not noticed the princess's blush, or if\nhe had seen it, he was far from attributing it to its true cause.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said, kissing his wife's hand, \"there is some one present\nhere, who has fallen into disgrace, an unhappy exile whom I venture to\nrecommend to your kindness. Do not forget, I beg, that he is one of\nmy best friends, and that a gentle reception of him will please me\ngreatly.\"\n\n\"What exile? what disgraced person are you speaking of?\" inquired\nMadame, looking all round, and not permitting her glance to rest more on\nthe count than on the others.\n\nThis was the moment to present De Guiche, and the prince drew aside and\nlet De Guiche pass him, who, with a tolerably well-assumed awkwardness\nof manner, approached Madame and made his reverence to her.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Madame, as if she were greatly surprised, \"is M. de\nGuiche the disgraced individual you speak of, the exile in question?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" returned the duke.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Madame, \"he seems almost the only person here!\"\n\n\"You are unjust, Madame,\" said the prince.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Come, forgive the poor fellow.\"\n\n\"Forgive him what? What have I to forgive M. de Guiche?\"\n\n\"Come, explain yourself, De Guiche. What do you wish to be forgiven?\"\ninquired the prince.\n\n\"Alas! her royal highness knows very well what it is,\" replied the\nlatter, in a hypocritical tone.\n\n\"Come, come, give him your hand, Madame,\" said Philip.\n\n\"If it will give you any pleasure, Monsieur,\" and, with a movement of\nher eyes and shoulders, which it would be impossible to describe, Madame\nextended towards the young man her beautiful and perfumed hand, upon\nwhich he pressed his lips. It was evident that he did so for some little\ntime, and that Madame did not withdraw her hand too quickly, for the\nduke added:\n\n\"De Guiche is not wickedly disposed, Madame; so do not be afraid, he\nwill not bite you.\"\n\nA pretext was given in the gallery by the duke's remark, which was\nnot, perhaps, very laughable, for every one to laugh excessively. The\nsituation was odd enough, and some kindly disposed persons had observed\nit. Monsieur was still enjoying the effect of his remark, when the\nking was announced. The appearance of the room at that moment was as\nfollows:--in the center, before the fireplace, which was filled with\nflowers, Madame was standing up, with her maids of honor formed in two\nwings, on either side of her; around whom the butterflies of the court\nwere fluttering. Several other groups were formed in the recesses of the\nwindows, like soldiers stationed in their different towers who belong to\nthe same garrison. From their respective places they could pick up the\nremarks which fell from the principal group. From one of these groups,\nthe nearest to the fireplace, Malicorne, who had been at once raised to\nthe dignity, through Manicamp and De Guiche, of the post of master of\nthe apartments, and whose official costume had been ready for the last\ntwo months, was brilliant with gold lace, and shone upon Montalais,\nstanding on Madame's extreme left, with all the fire of his eyes and\nsplendor of his velvet. Madame was conversing with Mademoiselle\nde Chatillon and Mademoiselle de Crequy, who were next to her, and\naddressed a few words to Monsieur, who drew aside as soon as the king\nwas announced. Mademoiselle de la Valliere, like Montalais, was on\nMadame's left hand, and the last but one on the line, Mademoiselle de\nTonnay-Charente being on her right. She was stationed as certain bodies\nof troops are, whose weakness is suspected, and who are placed between\ntwo experienced regiments. Guarded in this manner by the companions who\nhad shared her adventure, La Valliere, whether from regret at Raoul's\ndeparture, or still suffering from the emotion caused by recent\nevents, which had begun to render her name familiar on the lips of\nthe courtiers, La Valliere, we repeat, hid her eyes, red with weeping,\nbehind her fan, and seemed to give the greatest attention to the remarks\nwhich Montalais and Athenais, alternately, whispered to her from time to\ntime. As soon as the king's name was announced a general movement took\nplace in the apartment. Madame, in her character as hostess, rose\nto receive the royal visitor; but as she rose, notwithstanding her\npreoccupation of mind, she glanced hastily towards her right; her\nglance, which the presumptuous De Guiche regarded as intended for\nhimself, rested, as it swept over the whole circle, upon La Valliere,\nwhose warm blush and restless emotion it instantly perceived.\n\nThe king advanced to the middle of the group, which had now become a\ngeneral one, by a movement which took place from the circumference to\nthe center. Every head bowed low before his majesty, the ladies bending\nlike frail, magnificent lilies before King Aquilo. There was nothing\nvery severe, we will even say, nothing very royal that evening about the\nking, except youth and good looks. He wore an air of animated joyousness\nand good-humor which set all imaginations at work, and, thereupon, all\npresent promised themselves a delightful evening, for no other reason\nthan from having remarked the desire his majesty had to amuse himself\nin Madame's apartments. If there was any one in particular whose high\nspirits and good-humor equalled the king's, it was M. de Saint-Aignan,\nwho was dressed in a rose-colored costume, with face and ribbons of the\nsame color, and, in addition, particularly rose-colored in his\nideas, for that evening M. de Saint-Aignan was prolific in jests. The\ncircumstance which had given a new expansion to the numerous ideas\ngerminating in his fertile brain was, that he had just perceived\nthat Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente was, like himself, dressed in\nrose-color. We would not wish to say, however, that the wily courtier\nhad not know beforehand that the beautiful Athenais was to wear that\nparticular color; for he very well knew the art of unlocking the lips of\na dress-maker or a lady's maid as to her mistress's intentions. He\ncast as many killing glances at Mademoiselle Athenais as he had bows\nof ribbons on his stockings and doublet; in other words he discharged\na prodigious number. The king having paid Madame the customary\ncompliments, and Madame having requested him to be seated, the circle\nwas immediately formed. Louis inquired of Monsieur the particulars of\nthe day's bathing; and stated, looking at the ladies present while he\nspoke, that certain poets were engaged turning into verse the enchanting\ndiversion of the baths of Vulaines, and that one of them particularly,\nM. Loret, seemed to have been intrusted with the confidence of some\nwater-nymph, as he had in his verses recounted many circumstances that\nwere actually true--at which remark more than one lady present felt\nherself bound to blush. The king at this moment took the opportunity of\nlooking round him at more leisure; Montalais was the only one who did\nnot blush sufficiently to prevent her looking at the king, and she\nsaw him fix his eyes devouringly on Mademoiselle de la Valliere. This\nundaunted maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais, be it understood,\nforced the king to lower his gaze, and so saved Louise de la Valliere\nfrom a sympathetic warmth of feeling this gaze might possibly have\nconveyed. Louis was appropriated by Madame, who overwhelmed him with\ninquiries, and no one in the world knew how to ask questions better than\nshe did. He tried, however, to render the conversation general, and,\nwith the view of effecting this, he redoubled his attention and devotion\nto her. Madame coveted complimentary remarks, and, determined to procure\nthem at any cost, she addressed herself to the king, saying:\n\n\"Sire, your majesty, who is aware of everything which occurs in your\nkingdom, ought to know beforehand the verses confided to M. Loret by\nthis nymph; will your majesty kindly communicate them to us?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied the king, with perfect grace of manner, \"I dare\nnot--you, personally, might be in no little degree confused at having to\nlisten to certain details--but Saint-Aignan tells a story well, and has\na perfect recollection of the verses. If he does not remember them, he\nwill invent. I can certify he is almost a poet himself.\" Saint-Aignan,\nthus brought prominently forward, was compelled to introduce himself\nas advantageously as possible. Unfortunately, however, for Madame, he\nthought of his own personal affairs only; in other words, instead of\npaying Madame the compliments she so much desired and relished, his\nmind was fixed upon making as much display as possible of his own\ngood fortune. Again glancing, therefore, for the hundredth time at the\nbeautiful Athenais, who carried into practice her previous evening's\ntheory of not even deigning to look at her adorer, he said:--\n\n\"Your majesty will perhaps pardon me for having too indifferently\nremembered the verses which the nymph dictated to Loret; but if the\nking has not retained any recollection of them, how could I possibly\nremember?\"\n\nMadame did not receive this shortcoming of the courtier very favorably.\n\n\"Ah! madame,\" added Saint-Aignan, \"at present it is no longer a question\nwhat the water-nymphs have to say; and one would almost be tempted to\nbelieve that nothing of any interest now occurs in those liquid realms.\nIt is upon earth, madame, important events happen. Ah! Madame, upon the\nearth, how many tales are there full of--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Madame, \"and what is taking place upon the earth?\"\n\n\"That question must be asked of the Dryads,\" replied the comte; \"the\nDryads inhabit the forest, as your royal highness is aware.\"\n\n\"I am aware also, that they are naturally very talkative, Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Such is the case, Madame; but when they say such delightful things, it\nwould be ungracious to accuse them of being too talkative.\"\n\n\"Do they talk so delightfully, then?\" inquired the princess,\nindifferently. \"Really, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, you excite my\ncuriosity; and, if I were the king, I would require you immediately to\ntell us what the delightful things are these Dryads have been saying,\nsince you alone seem to understand their language.\"\n\n\"I am at his majesty's orders, Madame, in that respect,\" replied the\ncomte, quickly.\n\n\"What a fortunate fellow this Saint-Aignan is to understand the language\nof the Dryads,\" said Monsieur.\n\n\"I understand it perfectly, monseigneur, as I do my own language.\"\n\n\"Tell us all about them, then,\" said Madame.\n\nThe king felt embarrassed, for his confidant was, in all probability,\nabout to embark in a difficult matter. He felt that it would be so, from\nthe general attention excited by Saint-Aignan's preamble, and aroused\ntoo by Madame's peculiar manner. The most reserved of those who were\npresent seemed ready to devour every syllable the comte was about to\npronounce. They coughed, drew closer together, looked curiously at some\nof the maids of honor, who, in order to support with greater propriety,\nor with more steadiness, the fixity of the inquisitorial looks bent\nupon them, adjusted their fans accordingly, and assumed the bearing of a\nduelist about to be exposed to his adversary's fire. At this epoch,\nthe fashion of ingeniously constructed conversations, and hazardously\ndangerous recitals, so prevailed, that, where, in modern times, a whole\ncompany assembled in a drawing-room would begin to suspect some scandal,\nor disclosure, or tragic event, and would hurry away in dismay, Madame's\nguests quietly settled themselves in their places, in order not to lose\na word or gesture of the comedy composed by Monsieur de Saint-Aignan for\ntheir benefit, and the termination of which, whatever the style and\nthe plot might be, must, as a matter of course, be marked by the most\nperfect propriety. The comte as known as a man of extreme refinement,\nand an admirable narrator. He courageously began, then, amidst a\nprofound silence, which would have been formidable to any one but\nhimself:--\"Madame, by the king's permission, I address myself, in the\nfirst place, to your royal highness, since you admit yourself to be\nthe person present possessing the greatest curiosity. I have the\nhonor, therefore, to inform your royal highness that the Dryad\nmore particularly inhabits the hollows of oaks; and, as Dryads are\nmythological creatures of great beauty, they inhabit the most beautiful\ntrees, in other words, the largest to be found.\"\n\nAt this exordium, which recalled, under a transparent veil, the\ncelebrated story of the royal oak, which had played so important a part\nin the last evening, so many hearts began to beat, both from joy and\nuneasiness, that, if Saint-Aignan had not had a good and sonorous voice,\ntheir throbbings might have been heard above the sound of his voice.\n\n\"There must surely be Dryads at Fontainebleau, then,\" said Madame, in a\nperfectly calm voice; \"for I have never, in all my life, seen finer\noaks than in the royal park.\" And as she spoke, she directed towards De\nGuiche a look of which he had no reason to complain, as he had of the\none that preceded it; which, as we have already mentioned, had reserved\na certain amount of indefiniteness most painful for so loving a heart as\nhis.\n\n\"Precisely, Madame, it is of Fontainebleau I was about to speak to\nyour royal highness,\" said Saint-Aignan; \"for the Dryad whose story is\nengaging our attention, lives in the park belonging to the chateau of\nhis majesty.\"\n\nThe affair was fairly embarked on; the action was begun, and it was no\nlonger possible for auditory or narrator to draw back.\n\n\"It will be worth listening to,\" said Madame; \"for the story not only\nappears to me to have all the interest of a national incident, but still\nmore, seems to be a circumstance of very recent occurrence.\"\n\n\"I ought to begin at the beginning,\" said the comte. \"In the first\nplace, then, there lived at Fontainebleau, in a cottage of modest and\nunassuming appearance, two shepherds. The one was the shepherd Tyrcis,\nthe owner of extensive domains transmitted to him from his parents, by\nright of inheritance. Tyrcis was young and handsome, and, from his many\nqualifications, he might be pronounced to be the first and foremost\namong the shepherds in the whole country; one might even boldly say he\nwas the king of shepherds.\" A subdued murmur of approbation encouraged\nthe narrator, who continued:--\"His strength equals his courage; no one\ndisplays greater address in hunting wild beasts, nor greater wisdom in\nmatters where judgment is required. Whenever he mounts and exercises his\nhorse in the beautiful plains of his inheritance, or whenever he joins\nwith the shepherds who owe him allegiance, in different games of skill\nand strength, one might say that it is the god Mars hurling his lance on\nthe plains of Thrace, or, even better, that it was Apollo himself, the\ngod of day, radiant upon earth, bearing his flaming darts in his hand.\"\nEvery one understood that this allegorical portrait of the king was not\nthe worst exordium the narrator could have chosen; and consequently it\ndid not fail to produce its effect, either upon those who, from duty or\ninclination, applauded it to the very echo, or on the king himself, to\nwhom flattery was very agreeable when delicately conveyed, and whom,\nindeed, it did not always displease, even when it was a little too\nbroad. Saint-Aignan then continued:--\"It is not in games of glory only,\nladies, that the shepherd Tyrcis had acquired that reputation by which\nhe was regarded as the king of the shepherds.\"\n\n\"Of the shepherds of Fontainebleau,\" said the king, smilingly, to\nMadame.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Madame, \"Fontainebleau is selected arbitrarily by the\npoet; but I should say, of the shepherds of the whole world.\" The king\nforgot his part of a passive auditor, and bowed.\n\n\"It is,\" paused Saint-Aignan, amidst a flattering murmur of applause,\n\"it is with ladies fair especially that the qualities of this king of\nthe shepherds are most prominently displayed. He is a shepherd with a\nmind as refined as his heart is pure; he can pay a compliment with a\ncharm of manner whose fascination it is impossible to resist; and in his\nattachments he is so discreet, that beautiful and happy conquests may\nregard their lot as more than enviable. Never a syllable of disclosure,\nnever a moment's forgetfulness. Whoever has seen and heard Tyrcis\nmust love him; whoever loves and is beloved by him, has indeed found\nhappiness.\" Saint-Aignan here paused; he was enjoying the pleasure\nof all these compliments; and the portrait he had drawn, however\ngrotesquely inflated it might be, had found favor in certain ears,\nin which the perfections of the shepherd did not seem to have been\nexaggerated. Madame begged the orator to continue. \"Tyrcis,\" said the\ncomte, \"had a faithful companion, or rather a devoted servant, whose\nname was--Amyntas.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madame, archly, \"now for the portrait of Amyntas; you are\nsuch an excellent painter, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"Madame--\"\n\n\"Oh! comte, do not, I entreat you, sacrifice poor Amyntas; I should\nnever forgive you.\"\n\n\"Madame, Amyntas is of too humble a position, particularly beside\nTyrcis, for his person to be honored by a parallel. There are certain\nfriends who resemble those followers of ancient times, who caused\nthemselves to be buried alive at their masters' feet. Amyntas's place,\ntoo, is at the feet of Tyrcis; he cares for no other; and if, sometimes,\nthe illustrious hero--\"\n\n\"Illustrious shepherd, you mean?\" said Madame, pretending to correct M.\nde Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Your royal highness is right; I was mistaken,\" returned the courtier;\n\"if, I say, the shepherd Tyrcis deigns occasionally to call Amyntas his\nfriend, and to open his heart to him, it is an unparalleled favor, which\nthe latter regards as the most unbounded felicity.\"\n\n\"All that you say,\" interrupted Madame, \"establishes the extreme\ndevotion of Amyntas to Tyrcis, but does not furnish us with the portrait\nof Amyntas. Comte, do not flatter him, if you like; but describe him to\nus. I will have Amyntas's portrait.\" Saint-Aignan obeyed, after having\nbowed profoundly to his majesty's sister-in-law.\n\n\"Amyntas,\" he said, \"is somewhat older than Tyrcis; he is not an\nill-favored shepherd; it is even said that the muses condescended to\nsmile upon him at his birth, even as Hebe smiled upon youth. He is not\nambitious of display, but he is ambitious of being loved; and he might\nnot, perhaps, be found unworthy of it, if he were only sufficiently\nwell-known.\"\n\nThis latter paragraph, strengthened by a killing glance, was directed\nstraight to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who received them both\nunmoved. But the modesty and tact of the allusion had produced a good\neffect; Amyntas reaped the benefit of it in the applause bestowed upon\nhim: Tyrcis's head even gave the signal for it by a consenting bow, full\nof good feeling.\n\n\"One evening,\" continued Saint-Aignan, \"Tyrcis and Amyntas were walking\ntogether in the forest, talking of their love disappointments. Do not\nforget, ladies, that the story of the Dryad is now beginning, otherwise\nit would be easy to tell you what Tyrcis and Amyntas, the two most\ndiscreet shepherds of the whole earth, were talking about. They reached\nthe thickest part of the forest, for the purpose of being quite alone,\nand of confiding their troubles more freely to each other, when suddenly\nthe sound of voices struck upon their ears.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said those who surrounded the narrator. \"Nothing can be more\ninteresting.\"\n\nAt this point, Madame, like a vigilant general inspecting his army,\nglanced at Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who could not help wincing\nas they drew themselves up.\n\n\"These harmonious voices,\" resumed Saint-Aignan, \"were those of certain\nshepherdesses, who had been likewise desirous of enjoying the coolness\nof the shade, and who, knowing the isolated and almost unapproachable\nsituation of the place, had betaken themselves there to interchange\ntheir ideas upon--\" A loud burst of laughter occasioned by this remark\nof Saint-Aignan, and an imperceptible smile of the king, as he looked at\nTonnay-Charente, followed this sally.\n\n\"The Dryad affirms positively,\" continued Saint-Aignan, \"that the\nshepherdesses were three in number, and that all three were young and\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"What were their names?\" said Madame, quickly.\n\n\"Their names?\" said Saint-Aignan, who hesitated from fear of committing\nan indiscretion.\n\n\"Of course; you call your shepherds Tyrcis and Amyntas; give your\nshepherdesses names in a similar manner.\"\n\n\"Oh! Madame, I am not an inventor; I relate simply what took place as\nthe Dryad related it to me.\"\n\n\"What did your Dryad, then, call these shepherdesses? You have a very\ntreacherous memory, I fear. This Dryad must have fallen out with the\ngoddess Mnemosyne.\"\n\n\"These shepherdesses, Madame? Pray remember that it is a crime to betray\na woman's name.\"\n\n\"From which a woman absolves you, comte, on the condition that you will\nreveal the names of the shepherdesses.\"\n\n\"Their names were Phyllis, Amaryllis, and Galatea.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly well!--they have not lost by the delay,\" said Madame, \"and\nnow we have three charming names. But now for their portraits.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan again made a slight movement.\n\n\"Nay, comte, let us proceed in due order,\" returned Madame. \"Ought we\nnot, sire, to have the portraits of the shepherdesses?\"\n\nThe king, who expected this determined perseverance, and who began to\nfeel some uneasiness, did not think it safe to provoke so dangerous\nan interrogator. He thought, too, that Saint-Aignan, in drawing the\nportraits, would find a means of insinuating some flattering allusions\nwhich would be agreeable to the ears of one his majesty was interested\nin pleasing. It was with this hope and with this fear that Louis\nauthorized Saint-Aignan to sketch the portraits of the shepherdesses,\nPhyllis, Amaryllis, and Galatea.\n\n\"Very well, then; be it so,\" said Saint-Aignan, like a man who has made\nup his mind, and he began.\n\n\n\nChapter LVII. Conclusion of the Story of a Naiad and of a Dryad.\n\n\"Phyllis,\" said Saint-Aignan, with a glance of defiance at Montalais,\nsuch as a fencing-master would give who invites an antagonist worthy\nof him to place himself on guard, \"Phyllis is neither fair nor dark,\nneither tall nor short, neither too grave nor too gay; though but a\nshepherdess, she is as witty as a princess, and as coquettish as the\nmost finished flirt that ever lived. Nothing can equal her excellent\nvision. Her heart yearns for everything her gaze embraces. She is like\na bird, which, always warbling, at one moment skims the ground, at the\nnext rises fluttering in pursuit of a butterfly, then rests itself upon\nthe topmost branch of a tree, where it defies the bird-catchers either\nto come and seize it or to entrap it in their nets.\" The portrait bore\nsuch a strong resemblance to Montalais, that all eyes were directed\ntowards her; she, however, with her head raised, and with a steady,\nunmoved look, listened to Saint-Aignan, as if he were speaking of an\nutter stranger.\n\n\"Is that all, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan?\" inquired the princess.\n\n\"Oh! your royal highness, the portrait is but a mere sketch, and many\nmore additions could be made, but I fear to weary your patience, or\noffend the modesty of the shepherdess, and I shall therefore pass on to\nher companion, Amaryllis.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Madame, \"pass on to Amaryllis, Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan, we are all attention.\"\n\n\"Amaryllis is the eldest of the three, and yet,\" Saint-Aignan hastened\nto add, \"this advanced age does not reach twenty years.\"\n\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who had slightly knitted her brows at\nthe commencement of the description, unbent them with a smile.\n\n\"She is tall, with an astonishing abundance of beautiful hair, which\nshe fastens in the manner of the Grecian statues; her walk is full of\nmajesty, her attitude haughty; she has the air, therefore, rather of a\ngoddess than a mere mortal, and among the goddesses, she most resembles\nDiana the huntress; with this sole difference, however, that the cruel\nshepherdess, having stolen the quiver of young love, while poor Cupid\nwas sleeping in a thicket of roses, instead of directing her arrows\nagainst the inhabitants of the forest, discharges them pitilessly\nagainst all poor shepherds who pass within reach of her bow and of her\neyes.\"\n\n\"Oh! what a wicked shepherdess!\" said Madame. \"She may some day\nwound herself with one of those arrows she discharges, as you say, so\nmercilessly on all sides.\"\n\n\"It is the hope of shepherds, one and all!\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"And that of the shepherd Amyntas in particular, I suppose?\" said\nMadame.\n\n\"The shepherd Amyntas is so timid,\" said Saint-Aignan, with the most\nmodest air he could assume, \"that if he cherishes such a hope as that,\nno one has ever known anything about it, for he conceals it in the\nvery depths of his heart.\" A flattering murmur of applause greeted this\nprofession of faith on behalf of the shepherd.\n\n\"And Galatea?\" inquired Madame. \"I am impatient to see a hand so\nskillful as yours continue the portrait where Virgil left it, and finish\nit before our eyes.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"I am indeed a poor dumb post beside the\nmighty Virgil. Still, encouraged by your desire, I will do my best.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan extended his foot and hand, and thus began:--\"White as\nmilk, she casts upon the breeze the perfume of her fair hair tinged with\ngolden hues, as are the ears of corn. One is tempted to inquire if she\nis not the beautiful Europa, who inspired Jupiter with a tender passion\nas she played with her companions in the flower-spangled meadows. From\nher exquisite eyes, blue as azure heaven on the clearest summer day,\nemanates a tender light, which reverie nurtures, and love dispenses.\nWhen she frowns, or bends her looks towards the ground, the sun is\nveiled in token of mourning. When she smiles, on the contrary, nature\nresumes her jollity, and the birds, for a brief moment silenced,\nrecommence their songs amid the leafy covert of the trees. Galatea,\"\nsaid Saint-Aignan, in conclusion, \"is worthy of the admiration of the\nwhole world; and if she should ever bestow her heart upon another, happy\nwill that man be to whom she consecrates her first affections.\"\n\nMadame, who had attentively listened to the portrait Saint-Aignan\nhad drawn, as, indeed, had all the others, contented herself with\naccentuating her approbation of the most poetic passage by occasional\ninclinations of her head; but it was impossible to say if these marks of\nassent were accorded to the ability of the narrator of the resemblance\nof the portrait. The consequence, therefore, was, that as Madame did not\nopenly exhibit any approbation, no one felt authorized to applaud, not\neven Monsieur, who secretly thought that Saint-Aignan dwelt too much\nupon the portraits of the shepherdesses, and had somewhat slightingly\npassed over the portraits of the shepherds. The whole assembly seemed\nsuddenly chilled. Saint-Aignan, who had exhausted his rhetorical skill\nand his palette of artistic tints in sketching the portrait of Galatea,\nand who, after the favor with which his other descriptions had been\nreceived, already imagined he could hear the loudest applause allotted\nto this last one, was himself more disappointed than the king and the\nrest of the company. A moment's silence followed, which was at last\nbroken by Madame.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" she inquired, \"What is your majesty's opinion of these\nthree portraits?\"\n\nThe king, who wished to relieve Saint-Aignan's embarrassment without\ncompromising himself, replied, \"Why, Amaryllis, in my opinion, is\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said Monsieur, \"I prefer Phyllis; she is a capital girl,\nor rather a good-sort-of-fellow of a nymph.\"\n\nA gentle laugh followed, and this time the looks were so direct, that\nMontalais felt herself blushing almost scarlet.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Madame, \"what were those shepherdesses saying to each\nother?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan, however, whose vanity had been wounded, did not feel\nhimself in a position to sustain an attack of new and refreshed troops,\nand merely said, \"Madame, the shepherdesses were confiding to one\nanother their little preferences.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, you are a perfect stream of\npastoral poesy,\" said Madame, with an amiable smile, which somewhat\ncomforted the narrator.\n\n\"They confessed that love is a mighty peril, but that the absence of\nlove is the heart's sentence of death.\"\n\n\"What was the conclusion they came to?\" inquired Madame.\n\n\"They came to the conclusion that love was necessary.\"\n\n\"Very good! Did they lay down any conditions?\"\n\n\"That of choice, simply,\" said Saint-Aignan. \"I ought even to\nadd,--remember it is the Dryad who is speaking,--that one of the\nshepherdesses, Amaryllis, I believe, was completely opposed to the\nnecessity of loving, and yet she did not positively deny that she had\nallowed the image of a certain shepherd to take refuge in her heart.\"\n\n\"Was it Amyntas or Tyrcis?\"\n\n\"Amyntas, Madame,\" said Saint-Aignan, modestly. \"But Galatea, the gentle\nand soft-eyed Galatea, immediately replied, that neither Amyntas, nor\nAlphesiboeus, nor Tityrus, nor indeed any of the handsomest shepherds of\nthe country, were to be compared to Tyrcis; that Tyrcis was as superior\nto all other men, as the oak to all other trees, as the lily in its\nmajesty to all other flowers. She drew even such a portrait of Tyrcis\nthat Tyrcis himself, who was listening, must have felt truly flattered\nat it, notwithstanding his rank as a shepherd. Thus Tyrcis and Amyntas\nhad been distinguished by Phyllis and Galatea; and thus had the secrets\nof two hearts revealed beneath the shades of evening, and amid the\nrecesses of the woods. Such, Madame, is what the Dryad related to me;\nshe who knows all that takes place in the hollows of oaks and grassy\ndells; she who knows the loves of the birds, and all they wish to convey\nby their songs; she who understands, in fact, the language of the wind\namong the branches, the humming of the insect with its gold and emerald\nwings in the corolla of the wild-flowers; it was she who related the\nparticulars to me, and I have repeated them.\"\n\n\"And now you have finished, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, have you not?\"\nsaid Madame, with a smile that made the king tremble.\n\n\"Quite finished,\" replied Saint-Aignan, \"and but too happy if I have\nbeen able to amuse your royal highness for a few moments.\"\n\n\"Moments which have been too brief,\" replied the princess; \"for you\nhave related most admirably all you know; but, my dear Monsieur\nde Saint-Aignan, you have been unfortunate enough to obtain your\ninformation from one Dryad only, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madame, only from one, I confess.\"\n\n\"The fact was, that you passed by a little Naiad, who pretended to know\nnothing at all, and yet knew a great deal more than your Dryad, my dear\ncomte.\"\n\n\"A Naiad!\" repeated several voices, who began to suspect that the story\nhad a continuation.\n\n\"Of course close beside the oak you are speaking of, which, if I am\nnot mistaken, is called the royal oak--is it not so, Monsieur de\nSaint-Aignan?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan and the king exchanged glances.\n\n\"Yes, Madame,\" the former replied.\n\n\"Well, close beside the oak there is a pretty little spring, which\nruns murmuringly over the pebbles, between banks of forget-me-nots and\ndaffodils.\"\n\n\"I believe you are correct,\" said the king, with some uneasiness, and\nlistening with some anxiety to his sister-in-law's narrative.\n\n\"Oh! there is one, I can assure you,\" said Madame; \"and the proof of it\nis, that the Naiad who resides in that little stream stopped me as I was\nabout to come.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" continued the princess, \"and she did so in order to\ncommunicate to me many particulars Monsieur de Saint-Aignan has omitted\nin his recital.\"\n\n\"Pray relate them yourself, then,\" said Monsieur, \"you can relate\nstories in such a charming manner.\" The princess bowed at the conjugal\ncompliment paid her.\n\n\"I do not possess the poetical powers of the comte, nor his ability to\nbring to light the smallest details.\"\n\n\"You will not be listened to with less interest on that account,\" said\nthe king, who already perceived that something hostile was intended in\nhis sister-in-law's story.\n\n\"I speak, too,\" continued Madame, \"in the name of that poor little\nNaiad, who is indeed the most charming creature I ever met. Moreover,\nshe laughed so heartily while she was telling me her story, that, in\npursuance of that medical axiom that laughter is the finest physic in\nthe world, I ask permission to laugh a little myself when I recollect\nher words.\"\n\nThe king and Saint-Aignan, who noticed spreading over many of the faces\npresent a distant and prophetic ripple of the laughter Madame announced,\nfinished by looking at each other, as if asking themselves whether there\nwas not some little conspiracy concealed beneath these words. But Madame\nwas determined to turn the knife in the wound over and over again; she\ntherefore resumed with the air of the most perfect candor, in other\nwords, with the most dangerous of all her airs: \"Well, then, I passed\nthat way,\" she said, \"and as I found beneath my steps many fresh\nflowers newly blown, no doubt Phyllis, Amaryllis, Galatea, and all your\nshepherdesses had passed the same way before me.\"\n\nThe king bit his lips, for the recital was becoming more and more\nthreatening. \"My little Naiad,\" continued Madame, \"was cooing over her\nquaint song in the bed of the rivulet; as I perceived that she accosted\nme by touching the hem of my dress, I could not think of receiving her\nadvances ungraciously, and more particularly so, since, after all, a\ndivinity, even though she be of a second grade, is always of greater\nimportance than a mortal, though a princess. I thereupon accosted the\nNaiad, and bursting into laughter, this is what she said to me:\n\n\"'Fancy, princess...' You understand, sire, it is the Naiad who is\nspeaking?\"\n\nThe king bowed assentingly; and Madame continued:--\"'Fancy, princess,\nthe banks of my little stream have just witnessed a most amusing scene.\nTwo shepherds, full of curiosity, even indiscreetly so, have allowed\nthemselves to be mystified in a most amusing manner by three nymphs, or\nthree shepherdesses,'--I beg your pardon, but I do not now remember if\nit was nymphs or shepherdesses she said; but it does not much matter, so\nwe will continue.\"\n\nThe king, at this opening, colored visibly, and Saint-Aignan, completely\nlosing countenance, began to open his eyes in the greatest possible\nanxiety.\n\n\"'The two shepherds,' pursued my nymph, still laughing, 'followed in\nthe wake of the three young ladies,'--no, I mean, of the three nymphs;\nforgive me, I ought to say, of the three shepherdesses. It is not always\nwise to do that, for it may be awkward for those who are followed. I\nappeal to all the ladies present, and not one of them, I am sure, will\ncontradict me.\"\n\nThe king, who was much disturbed by what he suspected was about to\nfollow, signified his assent by a gesture.\n\n\"'But,' continued the Naiad, 'the shepherdesses had noticed Tyrcis and\nAmyntas gliding into the wood, and, by the light of the moon, they\nhad recognized them through the grove of the trees.' Ah, you laugh!\"\ninterrupted Madame; \"wait, wait, you are not yet at the end.\"\n\nThe king turned pale; Saint-Aignan wiped his forehead, now dewed\nwith perspiration. Among the groups of ladies present could be heard\nsmothered laughter and stealthy whispers.\n\n\"'The shepherdesses, I was saying, noticing how indiscreet the two\nshepherds were, proceeded to sit down at the foot of the royal oak; and,\nwhen they perceived that their over-curious listeners were sufficiently\nnear, so that not a syllable of what they might say could be lost, they\naddressed towards them very innocently, in the most artless manner\nin the world indeed, a passionate declaration, which from the vanity\nnatural to all men, and even to the most sentimental of shepherds,\nseemed to the two listeners as sweet as honey.'\"\n\nThe king, at these words, which the assembly was unable to hear without\nlaughing, could not restrain a flash of anger darting from his eyes. As\nfor Saint-Aignan, he let his head fall upon his breast, and concealed,\nunder a silly laugh, the extreme annoyance he felt.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the king, drawing himself up to his full height, \"upon my\nword, that is a most amusing jest, certainly; but, really and truly, are\nyou sure you quite understood the language of the Naiads?\"\n\n\"The comte, sire, pretends to have perfectly understood that of the\nDryads,\" retorted Madame, icily.\n\n\"No doubt,\" said the king; \"but you know the comte has the weakness to\naspire to become a member of the Academy, so that, with this object in\nview, he has learnt all sorts of things of which very happily you are\nignorant; and it might possibly happen that the language of the Nymph of\nthe Waters might be among the number of things you have not studied.\"\n\n\"Of course, sire,\" replied Madame, \"for facts of that nature one\ndoes not altogether rely upon one's self alone; a woman's ear is not\ninfallible, so says Saint Augustine; and I, therefore, wished to satisfy\nmyself by other opinions beside my own, and as my Naiad, who, in her\ncharacter of a goddess, is polyglot,--is not that the expression, M. de\nSaint-Aignan?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said the latter, quite out of countenance.\n\n\"Well,\" continued the princess, \"as my Naiad, who, in her character of\na goddess, had, at first spoken to me in English, I feared, as\nyou suggest, that I might have misunderstood her, and I requested\nMesdemoiselles de Montalais, de Tonnay-Charente, and de la Valliere, to\ncome to me, begging my Naiad to repeat to me in the French language, the\nrecital she had already communicated to me in English.\"\n\n\"And did she do so?\" inquired the king.\n\n\"Oh, she is the most polite divinity it is possible to imagine! Yes,\nsire, she did so; so that no doubt whatever remains on the subject. Is\nit not so, young ladies?\" said the princess, turning towards the left of\nher army; \"did not the Naiad say precisely what I have related, and\nhave I, in any one particular, exceeded the truth, Phyllis? I beg your\npardon, I mean Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais?\"\n\n\"Precisely as you have stated, Madame,\" articulated Mademoiselle de\nMontalais, very distinctly.\n\n\"Is it true, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente?\"\n\n\"The perfect truth,\" replied Athenais, in a voice quite as firm, but not\nyet so distinct.\n\n\"And you, La Valliere?\" asked Madame.\n\nThe poor girl felt the king's ardent look fixed upon her,--she dared\nnot deny--she dared not tell a falsehood; she merely bowed her head;\nand everybody took it for a token of assent. Her head, however, was not\nraised again, chilled as she was by a coldness more bitter than that of\ndeath. This triple testimony overwhelmed the king. As for Saint-Aignan,\nhe did not even attempt to dissemble his despair, and, hardly knowing\nwhat he said, he stammered out, \"An excellent jest! admirably played!\"\n\n\"A just punishment for curiosity,\" said the king, in a hoarse voice.\n\"Oh! who would think, after the chastisement that Tyrcis and Amyntas\nhad suffered, of endeavoring to surprise what is passing in the heart of\nshepherdesses? Assuredly I shall not, for one; and, you, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Nor I! nor I!\" repeated, in a chorus, the group of courtiers.\n\nMadame was filled with triumph at the king's annoyance; and was full of\ndelight, thinking that her story had been, or was to be, the termination\nof the whole affair. As for Monsieur, who had laughed at the two stories\nwithout comprehending anything about them, he turned towards De Guiche,\nand said to him, \"Well, comte, you say nothing; can you not find\nsomething to say? Do you pity M. Tyrcis and M. Amyntas, for instance?\"\n\n\"I pity them with all my soul,\" replied De Guiche; \"for, in very truth,\nlove is so sweet a fancy, that to lose it, fancy though it may be, is to\nlose more than life itself. If, therefore, these two shepherds thought\nthemselves beloved,--if they were happy in that idea, and if, instead\nof that happiness, they meet not only that empty void which resembles\ndeath, but jeers and jests at love itself, which is worse than a\nthousand deaths,--in that case, I say that Tyrcis and Amyntas are the\ntwo most unhappy men I know.\"\n\n\"And you are right, too, Monsieur de Guiche,\" said the king; \"for, in\nfact, the injury in question is a very hard return for a little harmless\ncuriosity.\"\n\n\"That is as much to say, then, that the story of my Naiad has displeased\nthe king?\" asked Madame, innocently.\n\n\"Nay, Madame, undeceive yourself,\" said Louis, taking the princess by\nthe hand; \"your Naiad, on the contrary, has pleased me, and the more so,\nbecause she was so truthful, and because her tale, I ought to add, is\nconfirmed by the testimony of unimpeachable witnesses.\"\n\nThese words fell upon La Valliere, accompanied by a look that on one,\nfrom Socrates to Montaigne, could have exactly defined. The look and the\nking's remark succeeded in overpowering the unhappy girl, who, with her\nhead upon Montalais's shoulder, seemed to have fainted away. The king\nrose, without remarking this circumstance, of which no one, moreover,\ntook any notice, and, contrary to his usual custom, for generally he\nremained late in Madame's apartments, he took his leave, and retired to\nhis own side of the palace. Saint-Aignan followed him, leaving the rooms\nin as much despair as he had entered them with delight. Mademoiselle\nde Tonnay-Charente, less sensitive than La Valliere, was not much\nfrightened, and did not faint. However, it may be that the last look of\nSaint-Aignan had hardly been so majestic as the king's.\n\n\n\nChapter LVIII. Royal Psychology.\n\nThe king returned to his apartments with hurried steps. The reason he\nwalked as fast as he did was probably to avoid tottering in his gait.\nHe seemed to leave behind him as he went along a trace of a mysterious\nsorrow. That gayety of manner, which every one had remarked in him on\nhis arrival, and which they had been delighted to perceive, had not\nperhaps been understood in its true sense: but his stormy departure, his\ndisordered countenance, all knew, or at least thought they could\ntell the reason of. Madame's levity of manner, her somewhat bitter\njests,--bitter for persons of a sensitive disposition, and particularly\nfor one of the king's character; the great resemblance which naturally\nexisted between the king and an ordinary mortal, were among the reasons\nassigned for the precipitate and unexpected departure of his majesty.\nMadame, keen-sighted enough in other respects, did not, however, at\nfirst see anything extraordinary in it. It was quite sufficient for her\nto have inflicted some slight wound upon the vanity or self-esteem of\none who, so soon forgetting the engagements he had contracted, seemed to\nhave undertaken to disdain, without cause, the noblest and highest prize\nin France. It was not an unimportant matter for Madame, in the present\nposition of affairs, to let the king perceive the difference which\nexisted between the bestowal of his affections on one in a high station,\nand the running after each passing fancy, like a youth fresh from the\nprovinces. With regard to those higher placed affections, recognizing\ntheir dignity and their illimitable influence, acknowledging in them\na certain etiquette and display--a monarch not only did not act in a\nmanner derogatory to his high position, but found even repose, security,\nmystery, and general respect therein. On the contrary, in the debasement\nof a common or humble attachment, he would encounter, even among his\nmeanest subjects, carping and sarcastic remarks; he would forfeit his\ncharacter of infallibility and inviolability. Having descended to\nthe region of petty human miseries, he would be subjected to paltry\ncontentions. In one word, to convert the royal divinity into a mere\nmortal by striking at his heart, or rather even at his face, like the\nmeanest of his subjects, was to inflict a terrible blow upon the pride\nof that generous nature. Louis was more easily captivated by vanity than\naffection. Madame had wisely calculated her vengeance, and it has been\nseen, also, in what manner she carried it out. Let it not be supposed,\nhowever, that Madame possessed such terrible passions as the heroines of\nthe middle ages, or that she regarded things from a pessimistic point of\nview; on the contrary, Madame, young, amiable, of cultivated intellect,\ncoquettish, loving in her nature, but rather from fancy, or imagination,\nor ambition, than from her heart--Madame, we say, on the contrary,\ninaugurated that epoch of light and fleeting amusements, which\ndistinguished the hundred and twenty years that intervened between\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, and the last quarter of the\neighteenth. Madame saw, therefore, or rather fancied she saw,\nthings under their true aspect; she knew that the king, her august\nbrother-in-law, had been the first to ridicule the humble La Valliere,\nand that, in accordance with his usual custom, it was hardly probable\nhe would ever love the person who had excited his laughter, even had it\nbeen only for a moment. Moreover, was not her vanity ever present,\nthat evil influence which plays so important a part in that comedy of\ndramatic incidents called the life of a woman? Did not her vanity tell\nher, aloud, in a subdued voice, in a whisper, in every variety of tone,\nthat she could not, in reality, she a princess, young, beautiful, and\nrich, be compared to the poor La Valliere, as youthful as herself it\nis true, but far less pretty, certainly, and utterly without money,\nprotectors, or position? And surprise need not be excited with respect\nto Madame; for it is known that the greatest characters are those\nwho flatter themselves the most in the comparisons they draw between\nthemselves and others, between others and themselves. It may perhaps be\nasked what was Madame's motive for an attack so skillfully conceived\nand executed. Why was there such a display of forces, if it were not\nseriously her intention to dislodge the king from a heart that had never\nbeen occupied before, in which he seemed disposed to take refuge? Was\nthere any necessity, then, for Madame to attach so great an importance\nto La Valliere, if she did not fear her? Yet Madame did not fear La\nValliere in that direction in which an historian, who knows everything,\nsees into the future, or rather, the past. Madame was neither a\nprophetess nor a sibyl; nor could she, any more than another, read what\nwas written in that terrible and fatal book of the future, which records\nin its most secret pages the most serious events. No, Madame desired\nsimply to punish the king for having availed himself of secret means\naltogether feminine in their nature; she wished to prove to him that if\nhe made use of offensive weapons of that nature, she, a woman of ready\nwit and high descent, would assuredly discover in the arsenal of her\nimagination defensive weapons proof even against the thrusts of a\nmonarch. Moreover, she wished him to learn that, in a war of that\ndescription, kings are held of no account, or, at all events, that kings\nwho fight on their own behalf, like ordinary individuals, may witness\nthe fall of their crown in the first encounter; and that, in fact, if he\nhad expected to be adored by all the ladies of the court from the\nvery first, from a confident reliance on his mere appearance, it was a\npretension which was most preposterous and insulting even, for certain\npersons who filled a higher position than others, and that a lesson\ntaught in season to this royal personage, who assumed too high and\nhaughty a carriage, would be rendering him a great service. Such,\nindeed, were Madame's reflections with respect to the king. The sequel\nitself was not thought of. And in this manner, it will be seen that she\nhad exercised all her influence over the minds of her maids of honor,\nand with all its accompanying details, had arranged the comedy which had\njust been acted. The king was completely bewildered by it; for the first\ntime since he had escaped from the trammels of M. de Mazarin, he found\nhimself treated as a man. Similar severity from any of his subjects\nwould have been at once resisted by him. Strength comes with battle.\nBut to match one's self with women, to be attacked by them, to have been\nimposed upon by mere girls from the country, who had come from Blois\nexpressly for that purpose; it was the depth of dishonor for a young\nsovereign full of the pride his personal advantages and royal power\ninspired him with. There was nothing he could do--neither reproaches,\nnor exile--nor could he even show the annoyance he felt. To manifest\nvexation would have been to admit that he had been touched, like\nHamlet, by a sword from which the button had been removed--the sword of\nridicule. To show animosity against women--humiliation! especially\nwhen the women in question have laughter on their side, as a means of\nvengeance. If, instead of leaving all the responsibility of the affair\nto these women, one of the courtiers had had anything to do with the\nintrigue, how delightedly would Louis have seized the opportunity of\nturning the Bastile to personal account. But there, again, the king's\nanger paused, checked by reason. To be the master of armies, of prisons,\nof an almost divine authority, and to exert such majesty and might in\nthe service of a petty grudge, would be unworthy not only of a monarch,\nbut even of a man. It was necessary, therefore, simply to swallow the\naffront in silence, and to wear his usual gentleness and graciousness\nof expression. It was essential to treat Madame as a friend. As a\nfriend!--Well, and why not? Either Madame had been the instigator of the\naffair, or the affair itself had found her passive. If she had been the\ninstigator of it, it certainly was a bold measure on her part, but, at\nall events, it was but natural in her. Who was it that had sought her in\nthe earliest moments of her married life to whisper words of love in\nher ear? Who was it that had dared to calculate the possibility of\ncommitting a crime against the marriage vow--a crime, too, still more\ndeplorable on account of the relationship between them? Who was it that,\nshielded behind his royal authority, had said to this young creature:\nbe not afraid, love but the king of France, who is above all, and a\nmovement of whose sceptered hand will protect you against all attacks,\neven from your own remorse? And she had listened to and obeyed the royal\nvoice, had been influenced by his ensnaring tones; and when, morally\nspeaking, she had sacrificed her honor in listening to him, she saw\nherself repaid for her sacrifice by an infidelity the more humiliating,\nsince it was occasioned by a woman far beneath her in the world.\n\nHad Madame, therefore, been the instigator of the revenge, she would\nhave been right. If, on the contrary, she had remained passive in the\nwhole affair, what grounds had the king to be angry with her on that\naccount? Was it for her to restrain, or rather could she restrain, the\nchattering of a few country girls? and was it for her, by an excess\nof zeal that might have been misinterpreted, to check, at the risk of\nincreasing it, the impertinence of their conduct? All these various\nreasonings were like so many actual stings to the king's pride; but when\nhe had carefully, in his own mind, gone over all the various causes of\ncomplaint, Louis was surprised, upon due reflection--in other words,\nafter the wound has been dressed--to find that there were other causes\nof suffering, secret, unendurable, and unrevealed. There was one\ncircumstance he dared not confess, even to himself; namely, that the\nacute pain from which he was suffering had its seat in his heart. The\nfact is, he had permitted his heart to be gratified by La Valliere's\ninnocent confusion. He had dreamed of a pure affection--of an affection\nfor Louis the man, and not the sovereign--of an affection free from\nall self-interest; and his heart, simpler and more youthful than he had\nimagined it to be, had to meet that other heart that had revealed\nitself to him by its aspirations. The commonest thing in the complicated\nhistory of love, is the double inoculation of love to which any two\nhearts are subjected; the one loves nearly always before the other, in\nthe same way that the latter finishes nearly always by loving after the\nother. In this way, the electric current is established, in proportion\nto the intensity of the passion which is first kindled. The more\nMademoiselle de la Valliere showed her affection, the more the king's\naffection had increased. And it was precisely that which had annoyed his\nmajesty. For it was now fairly demonstrated to him, that no sympathetic\ncurrent had been the means of hurrying his heart away in its course,\nbecause there had been no confession of love in the case--because the\nconfession was, in fact, an insult towards the man and towards the\nsovereign; and finally, because--and the word, too, burnt like a hot\niron--because, in fact, it was nothing but a mystification after all.\nThis girl, therefore, who, in strictness, could not lay claim to\nbeauty, or birth, or great intelligence--who had been selected by Madame\nherself, on account of her unpretending position, had not only aroused\nthe king's regard, but had, moreover, treated him with disdain--he, the\nking, a man who, like an eastern potentate, had but to bestow a glance,\nto indicate with his finger, to throw his handkerchief. And, since the\nprevious evening, his mind had been so absorbed with this girl that he\ncould think and dream of nothing else. Since the previous evening his\nimagination had been occupied by clothing her image with charms to which\nshe could not lay claim. In very truth, he whom such vast interests\nsummoned, and whom so many women smiled upon invitingly, had, since the\nprevious evening, consecrated every moment of his time, every throb of\nhis heart, to this sole dream. It was, indeed, either too much, or not\nsufficient. The indignation of the king, making him forget everything,\nand, among others, that Saint-Aignan was present, was poured out in\nthe most violent imprecations. True it is, that Saint-Aignan had taken\nrefuge in a corner of the room; and from his corner, regarded\nthe tempest passing over. His own personal disappointment seemed\ncontemptible, in comparison with the anger of the king. He compared\nwith his own petty vanity the prodigious pride of offended majesty;\nand, being well read in the hearts of kings in general, and in those of\npowerful kings in particular, he began to ask himself if this weight of\nanger, as yet held in suspense, would not soon terminate by falling\nupon his own head, for the very reason that others were guilty, and\nhe innocent. In point of fact, the king, all at once, did arrest his\nhurried pace; and, fixing a look full of anger upon Saint-Aignan,\nsuddenly cried out: \"And you, Saint-Aignan?\"\n\nSaint-Aignan made a sign which was intended to signify, \"Well, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes; you have been as silly as myself, I think.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" stammered out Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"You permitted us to be deceived by this shameless trick.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Saint-Aignan, whose agitation was such as to make him\ntremble in every limb, \"let me entreat your majesty not to exasperate\nyourself. Women, you know, are characters full of imperfections, created\nfor the misfortune of mankind: to expect anything good from them is to\nrequire them to perform impossibilities.\"\n\nThe king, who had the greatest consideration for himself, and who had\nbegun to acquire over his emotions that command which he preserved over\nthem all his life, perceived that he was doing an outrage to his own\ndignity in displaying so much animosity about so trifling an object.\n\"No,\" he said, hastily; \"you are mistaken, Saint-Aignan; I am not angry;\nI can only wonder that we should have been turned into ridicule so\ncleverly and with such audacity by these young girls. I am particularly\nsurprised that, although we might have informed ourselves accurately on\nthe subject, we were silly enough to leave the matter for our own hearts\nto decide.\"\n\n\"The heart, sire, is an organ which requires positively to be reduced to\nits material functions, but which, for the sake of humanity's peace of\nmind, should be deprived of all its metaphysical inclinations. For my\nown part, I confess, when I saw that your majesty's heart was so taken\nup by this little--\"\n\n\"My heart taken up! I! My mind might, perhaps, have been so; but as for\nmy heart, it was--\" Louis again perceived that, in order to fill one\ngulf, he was about to dig another. \"Besides,\" he added, \"I have no fault\nto find with the girl. I was quite aware that she was in love with some\none else.\"\n\n\"The Vicomte de Bragelonne. I informed your majesty of the\ncircumstance.\"\n\n\"You did so: but you were not the first who told me. The Comte de la\nFere had solicited from me Mademoiselle de la Valliere's hand for his\nson. And, on his return from England, the marriage shall be celebrated,\nsince they love each other.\"\n\n\"I recognize your majesty's great generosity of disposition in that\nact.\"\n\n\"So, Saint-Aignan, we will cease to occupy ourselves with these matters\nany longer,\" said Louis.\n\n\"Yes, we will digest the affront, sire,\" replied the courtier, with\nresignation.\n\n\"Besides, it will be an easy matter to do so,\" said the king, checking a\nsigh.\n\n\"And, by way of a beginning, I will set about the composition of an\nepigram upon all three of them. I will call it 'The Naiad and Dryad,'\nwhich will please Madame.\"\n\n\"Do so, Saint-Aignan, do so,\" said the king, indifferently. \"You shall\nread me your verses; they will amuse me. Ah! it does not signify,\nSaint-Aignan,\" added the king, like a man breathing with difficulty,\n\"the blow requires more than human strength to support in a dignified\nmanner.\" As the king thus spoke, assuming an air of the most angelic\npatience, one of the servants in attendance knocked gently at the door.\nSaint-Aignan drew aside, out of respect.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the king. The servant partially opened the door. \"What\nis it?\" inquired Louis.\n\nThe servant held out a letter of a triangular shape. \"For your majesty,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"I do not know. One of the officers on duty gave it to me.\"\n\nThe valet, in obedience to a gesture of the king, handed him the\nletter. The king advanced towards the candles, opened the note, read\nthe signature, and uttered a loud cry. Saint-Aignan was sufficiently\nrespectful not to look on; but, without looking on, he saw and heard\nall, and ran towards the king, who with a gesture dismissed the servant.\n\"Oh, heavens!\" said the king, as he read the note.\n\n\"Is your majesty unwell?\" inquired Saint-Aignan, stretching forward his\narms.\n\n\"No, no, Saint-Aignan--read!\" and he handed him the note.\n\nSaint-Aignan's eyes fell upon the signature. \"La Valliere!\" he\nexclaimed. \"Oh, sire!\"\n\n\"Read, _read!_\"\n\nAnd Saint-Aignan read:\n\n\"Forgive my importunity, sire; and forgive, also, the absence of the\nformalities which may be wanting in this letter. A note seems to be more\nspeedy and more urgent than a dispatch. I venture, therefore, to address\nthis note to your majesty. I have retired to my own room, overcome with\ngrief and fatigue, sire; and I implore your majesty to grant me the\nfavor of an audience, which will enable me to confess the _truth_ to my\nsovereign.\n\n\"LOUISE de la VALLIERE.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked the king, taking the letter from Saint-Aignan's hands, who\nwas completely bewildered by what he had just read.\n\n\"Well!\" repeated Saint-Aignan.\n\n\"What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I hardly know.\"\n\n\"Still, what is your opinion?\"\n\n\"Sire, the young lady must have heard the muttering of the thunder, and\nhas got frightened.\"\n\n\"Frightened at what?\" asked Louis with dignity.\n\n\"Why, your majesty has a thousand reasons to be angry with the author or\nauthors of so hazardous a joke; and, if your majesty's memory were to be\nawakened in a disagreeable sense, it would be a perpetual menace hanging\nover the head of this imprudent girl.\"\n\n\"Saint-Aignan, I do not think as you do.\"\n\n\"Your majesty doubtless sees more clearly than myself.\"\n\n\"Well! I see affliction and restraint in these lines; more particularly\nsince I recall some of the details of the scene which took place this\nevening in Madame's apartments--\" The king suddenly stopped, leaving his\nmeaning unexpressed.\n\n\"In fact,\" resumed Saint-Aignan, \"your majesty will grant an audience;\nnothing is clearer than that.\"\n\n\"I will do better, Saint-Aignan.\"\n\n\"What is that, sire?\"\n\n\"Put on your cloak.\"\n\n\"But, sire--\"\n\n\"You know the suite of rooms where Madame's maids of honor are lodged?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"You know some means of obtaining an entrance there.\"\n\n\"As far as that is concerned, I do not.\"\n\n\"At all events, you must be acquainted with some one there.\"\n\n\"Really, your majesty is the source of every good idea.\"\n\n\"You do know some one, then. Who is it?\"\n\n\"I know a certain gentleman, who is on very good terms with a certain\nyoung lady there.\"\n\n\"One of the maids of honor?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, I suppose?\" said the king,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Fortunately, no, sire; with Montalais.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Malicorne.\"\n\n\"And you can depend on him?\"\n\n\"I believe so, sire. He ought to have a key of some sort in his\npossession; and if he should happen to have one, as I have done him a\nservice, why, he will let us have it.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better. Let us set off immediately.\"\n\nThe king threw his cloak over Saint-Aignan's shoulders, asked him for\nhis, and both went out into the vestibule.\n\n\n\nChapter LIX. Something That neither Naiad nor Dryad Foresaw.\n\nSaint-Aignan stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the\n_entresol_, where the maids of honor were lodged, and to the first\nfloor, where Madame's apartments were situated. Then, by means of one\nof the servants who was passing, he sent to apprise Malicorne, who was\nstill with Monsieur. After having waited ten minutes, Malicorne arrived,\nfull of self-importance. The king drew back towards the darkest part of\nthe vestibule. Saint-Aignan, on the contrary, advanced to meet him, but\nat the first words, indicating his wish, Malicorne drew back abruptly.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" he said, \"you want me to introduce you into the rooms of the\nmaids of honor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know very well that I cannot do anything of the kind, without being\nmade acquainted with your object.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, it is quite impossible for\nme to give you any explanation; you must therefore confide in me as in a\nfriend who got you out of a great difficulty yesterday, and who now begs\nyou to draw him out of one to-day.\"\n\n\"Yet I told you, monsieur, what my object was; which was, not to sleep\nout in the open air, and any man might express the same wish, whilst\nyou, however, admit nothing.\"\n\n\"Believe me, my dear Monsieur Malicorne,\" Saint-Aignan persisted, \"that\nif I were permitted to explain myself, I would do so.\"\n\n\"In that case, my dear monsieur, it is impossible for me to allow you to\nenter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"You know why, better than any one else, since you caught me on the wall\npaying my addresses to Mademoiselle de Montalais; it would, therefore,\nbe an excess of kindness on my part, you will admit, since I am paying\nmy attentions to her, to open the door of her room to you.\"\n\n\"But who told you it was on her account I asked you for the key?\"\n\n\"For whom, then?\"\n\n\"She does not lodge there alone, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, certainly; for Mademoiselle de la Valliere shares her rooms with\nher; but, really, you have nothing more to do with Mademoiselle de la\nValliere than with Mademoiselle de Montalais, and there are only two men\nto whom I would give this key; to M. de Bragelonne, if he begged me to\ngive it to him, and to the king, if he commanded me.\"\n\n\"In that case, give me the key, monsieur: I order you to do so,\" said\nthe king, advancing from the obscurity, and partially opening his cloak.\n\"Mademoiselle de Montalais will step down to talk with you, while we go\nup-stairs to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, for, in fact, it is she only\nwhom we desire to see.\"\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed Malicorne, bowing to the very ground.\n\n\"Yes, the king,\" said Louis, smiling: \"the king, who is as pleased with\nyour resistance as with your capitulation. Rise, monsieur, and render us\nthe service we request of you.\"\n\n\"I obey, your majesty,\" said Malicorne, leading the way up the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Get Mademoiselle de Montalais to come down,\" said the king, \"and do not\nbreathe a word to her of my visit.\"\n\nMalicorne bowed in token of obedience, and proceeded up the staircase.\nBut the king, after a hasty reflection, followed him, and that, too,\nwith such rapidity, that, although Malicorne was already more than\nhalf-way up the staircase, the king reached the room at the same\nmoment. He then observed, by the door which remained half-opened behind\nMalicorne, La Valliere, sitting in an armchair with her head thrown\nback, and in the opposite corner Montalais, who, in her dressing-gown,\nwas standing before a looking-glass, engaged in arranging her hair, and\nparleying the while with Malicorne. The king hurriedly opened the door\nand entered the room. Montalais called out at the noise made by the\nopening of the door, and, recognizing the king, made her escape. La\nValliere rose from her seat, like a dead person galvanized, and then\nfell back in her armchair. The king advanced slowly towards her.\n\n\"You wished for an audience, I believe,\" he said coldly. \"I am ready to\nhear you. Speak.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan, faithful to his character of being deaf, blind, and dumb,\nhad stationed himself in a corner of the door, upon a stool which by\nchance he found there. Concealed by the tapestry which covered the\ndoorway, and leaning his back against the wall, he could thus listen\nwithout being seen; resigning himself to the post of a good watch-dog,\nwho patiently waits and watches without ever getting in his master's\nway.\n\nLa Valliere, terror-stricken at the king's irritated aspect, rose a\nsecond time, and assuming a posture full of humility and entreaty,\nmurmured, \"Forgive me, sire.\"\n\n\"What need is there for my forgiveness?\" asked Louis.\n\n\"Sire, I have been guilty of a great fault; nay, more than a great\nfault, a great crime.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Sire, I have offended your majesty.\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest degree in the world,\" replied Louis XIV.\n\n\"I implore you, sire, not to maintain towards me that terrible\nseriousness of manner which reveals your majesty's just anger. I feel I\nhave offended you, sire; but I wish to explain to you how it was that I\nhave not offended you of my own accord.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" said the king, \"in what way can you possibly have\noffended me? I cannot perceive how. Surely not on account of a young\ngirl's harmless and very innocent jest? You turned the credulity of a\nyoung man into ridicule--it was very natural to do so: any other woman\nin your place would have done the same.\"\n\n\"Oh! your majesty overwhelms me by your remark.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, if I had been the author of the jest, it would not have been\ninnocent.\"\n\n\"Well, is that all you had to say to me in soliciting an audience?\" said\nthe king, as though about to turn away.\n\nThereupon La Valliere, in an abrupt and a broken voice, her eyes dried\nup by the fire of her tears, made a step towards the king, and said,\n\"Did your majesty hear everything?\"\n\n\"Everything, what?\"\n\n\"Everything I said beneath the royal oak.\"\n\n\"I did not lose a syllable.\"\n\n\"And now, after your majesty really heard all, are you able to think I\nabused your credibility?\"\n\n\"Credulity; yes, indeed, you have selected the very word.\"\n\n\"And your majesty did not suppose that a poor girl like myself might\npossibly be compelled to submit to the will of others?\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" returned the king; \"but I shall never be able to\nunderstand that she, who of her own free will could express herself so\nunreservedly beneath the royal oak, would allow herself to be influenced\nto such an extent by the direction of others.\"\n\n\"But the threat held out against me, sire.\"\n\n\"Threat! who threatened you--who dared to threaten you?\"\n\n\"Those who have the right to do so, sire.\"\n\n\"I do not recognize any one as possessing the right to threaten the\nhumblest of my subjects.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sire, but near your majesty, even, there are persons\nsufficiently high in position to have, or to believe that they possess,\nthe right of injuring a young girl, without fortune, and possessing only\nher reputation.\"\n\n\"In what way injure her?\"\n\n\"In depriving her of her reputation, by disgracefully expelling her from\nthe court.\"\n\n\"Oh! Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" said the king bitterly, \"I prefer\nthose persons who exculpate themselves without incriminating others.\"\n\n\"Sire!\"\n\n\"Yes; and I confess that I greatly regret to perceive, that an easy\njustification, as your own would have been, is now complicated in my\npresence by a tissue of reproaches and imputations against others.\"\n\n\"And which you do not believe?\" exclaimed La Valliere. The king remained\nsilent.\n\n\"Nay, but tell me!\" repeated La Valliere, vehemently.\n\n\"I regret to confess it,\" repeated the king, bowing coldly.\n\nThe young girl uttered a deep groan, striking her hands together in\ndespair. \"You do not believe me, then,\" she said to the king, who\nstill remained silent, while poor La Valliere's features became visibly\nchanged at his continued silence. \"Therefore, you believe,\" she said,\n\"that I pre-arranged this ridiculous, this infamous plot, of trifling,\nin so shameless a manner, with your majesty.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the king, \"it was neither ridiculous nor infamous; it was\nnot even a plot; merely a jest, more or less amusing, and nothing more.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" murmured the young girl, \"the king does not, and will not believe\nme, then?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I will not believe you,\" said the king. \"Besides, in point\nof fact, what can be more natural? The king, you argue, follows me,\nlistens to me, watches me; the king wishes perhaps to amuse himself\nat my expense, I will amuse myself at his, and as the king is very\ntender-hearted, I will take his heart by storm.\"\n\nLa Valliere hid her face in her hands, as she stifled her sobs. The\nking continued pitilessly; he was revenging himself upon the poor victim\nbefore him for all he had himself suffered.\n\n\"Let us invent, then, this story of my loving him and preferring him to\nothers. The king is so simple and so conceited that he will believe me;\nand then we can go and tell others how credulous the king is, and can\nenjoy a laugh at his expense.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed La Valliere, \"you think that, you believe that!--it is\nfrightful.\"\n\n\"And,\" pursued the king, \"that is not all; if this self-conceited prince\ntake our jest seriously, if he should be imprudent enough to exhibit\nbefore others anything like delight at it, well, in that case, the king\nwill be humiliated before the whole court; and what a delightful story\nit will be, too, for him to whom I am really attached, in fact part of\nmy dowry for my husband, to have the adventure to relate of the monarch\nwho was so amusingly deceived by a young girl.\"\n\n\"Sire!\" exclaimed La Valliere, her mind bewildered, almost wandering,\nindeed, \"not another word, I implore you; do you not see that you are\nkilling me?\"\n\n\"A jest, nothing but a jest,\" murmured the king, who, however, began to\nbe somewhat affected.\n\nLa Valliere fell upon her knees, and that so violently, that the sound\ncould be heard upon the hard floor. \"Sire,\" she said, \"I prefer shame to\ndisloyalty.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired the king, without moving a step to raise\nthe young girl from her knees.\n\n\"Sire, when I shall have sacrificed my honor and my reason both to you,\nyou will perhaps believe in my loyalty. The tale which was related to\nyou in Madame's apartments, and by Madame herself, is utterly false; and\nthat which I said beneath the great oak--\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"That is the only truth.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" exclaimed La Valliere, hurried away by the violence of her\nemotions, \"were I to die of shame on the very spot where my knees are\nfixed, I would repeat it until my latest breath; I said that I loved\nyou, and it is true; I do love you.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"I have loved you, sire, from the very first day I ever saw you; from\nthe moment when at Blois, where I was pining away my existence, your\nroyal looks, full of light and life, were first bent upon me. I love\nyou still, sire; it is a crime of high treason, I know, that a poor girl\nlike myself should love her sovereign, and should presume to tell him\nso. Punish me for my audacity, despise me for my shameless immodesty;\nbut do not ever say, do not ever think, that I have jested with or\ndeceived you. I belong to a family whose loyalty has been proved, sire,\nand I, too, love my king.\"\n\nSuddenly her strength, voice, and respiration ceased, and she fell\nforward, like the flower Virgil alludes to, which the scythe of the\nreaper severed in the midst of the grass. The king, at these words, at\nthis vehement entreaty, no longer retained any ill-will or doubt in\nhis mind: his whole heart seemed to expand at the glowing breath of an\naffection which proclaimed itself in such noble and courageous language.\nWhen, therefore, he heard the passionate confession, his strength seemed\nto fail him, and he hid his face in his hands. But when he felt La\nValliere's hands clinging to his own, when their warm pressure fired his\nblood, he bent forward, and passing his arm round La Valliere's waist,\nhe raised her from the ground and pressed her against his heart. But\nshe, her drooping head fallen forward on her bosom, seemed to have\nceased to live. The king, terrified, called out for Saint-Aignan.\nSaint-Aignan, who had carried his discretion so far as to remain without\nstirring in his corner, pretending to wipe away a tear, ran forward at\nthe king's summons. He then assisted Louis to seat the young girl upon\na couch, slapped her hands, sprinkled some Hungary water over her\nface, calling out all the while, \"Come, come, it is all over; the king\nbelieves you, and forgives you. There, there now! take care, or you\nwill agitate his majesty too much; his majesty is so sensitive, so\ntender-hearted. Now, really, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, you must pay\nattention, for the king is very pale.\"\n\nThe fact was, the king was visibly losing color. But La Valliere did not\nmove.\n\n\"Do pray recover,\" continued Saint-Aignan. \"I beg, I implore you; it is\nreally time you should; think only of one thing, that if the king should\nbecome unwell, I should be obliged to summon his physician. What a state\nof things that would be! So do pray rouse yourself; make an effort, pray\ndo, and do so at once, my dear.\"\n\nIt was difficult to display more persuasive eloquence than Saint-Aignan\ndid, but something still more powerful, and of a more energetic nature\nthan this eloquence, aroused La Valliere. The king, who was kneeling\nbefore her, covered the palms of her hands with those burning kisses\nwhich are to the hands what a kiss upon the lips is to the face. La\nValliere's senses returned to her; she languidly opened her eyes and,\nwith a dying look, murmured, \"Oh! sire, has your majesty pardoned me,\nthen?\"\n\nThe king did not reply, for he was still too much overcome. Saint-Aignan\nthought it was his duty again to retire, for he observed the passionate\ndevotion which was displayed in the king's gaze. La Valliere rose.\n\n\"And now, sire, that I have justified myself, at least I trust so, in\nyour majesty's eyes, grant me leave to retire into a convent. I shall\nbless your majesty all my life, and I shall die thanking and loving\nHeaven for having granted me one hour of perfect happiness.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the king, \"you will live here blessing Heaven, on the\ncontrary, but loving Louis, who will make your existence one of perfect\nfelicity--Louis who loves you--Louis who swears it.\"\n\n\"Oh! sire, sire!\"\n\nAnd upon this doubt of La Valliere, the king's kisses became so warm\nthat Saint-Aignan thought it was his duty to retire behind the tapestry.\nThese kisses, however, which she had not the strength at first to\nresist, began to intimidate the young girl.\n\n\"Oh! sire,\" she exclaimed, \"do not make me repeat my loyalty, for this\nwould show me that your majesty despises me still.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de la Valliere,\" said the king, suddenly, drawing back\nwith an air full of respect, \"there is nothing in the world that I love\nand honor more than yourself, and nothing in my court, I call Heaven\nto witness, shall be so highly regarded as you shall be henceforward.\nI entreat your forgiveness for my transport; it arose from an excess\nof affection, but I can prove to you that I love you more than ever by\nrespecting you as much as you can possibly desire or deserve.\" Then,\nbending before her, and taking her by the hand, he said to her, \"Will\nyou honor me by accepting the kiss I press upon your hand?\" And the\nking's lips were pressed respectfully and lightly upon the young girl's\ntrembling hand. \"Henceforth,\" added Louis, rising and bending his glance\nupon La Valliere, \"henceforth you are under my safeguard. Do not speak\nto any one of the injury I have done you, forgive others that which they\nmay have attempted. For the future, you shall be so far above all those,\nthat, far from inspiring you with fear, they shall be even beneath your\npity.\" And he bowed as reverently as though he were leaving a place\nof worship. Then calling to Saint-Aignan, who approached with great\nhumility, he said, \"I hope, comte, that Mademoiselle de la Valliere will\nkindly confer a little of her friendship upon you, in return for that\nwhich I have vowed to her eternally.\"\n\nSaint-Aignan bent his knee before La Valliere, saying, \"How happy,\nindeed, would such an honor make me!\"\n\n\"I will send your companion back to you,\" said the king. \"Farewell! or,\nrather, adieu till we meet again; do not forget me in your prayers, I\nentreat.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried La Valliere, \"be assured that you and Heaven are in my heart\ntogether.\"\n\nThese words of Louise elated the king, who, full of happiness,\nhurried Saint-Aignan down the stairs. Madame had not anticipated this\n_denouement_; and neither the Naiad nor the Dryad had breathed a word\nabout it.\n\n\n\nChapter LX. The New General of the Jesuits.\n\nWhile La Valliere and the king were mingling, in their first confession\nof love, all the bitterness of the past, the happiness of the present,\nand hopes of the future, Fouquet had retired to the apartments which\nhad been assigned to him in the chateau, and was conversing with Aramis\nprecisely upon the very subjects which the king at that moment was\nforgetting.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" said Fouquet, after having installed his guest in an\narmchair and seated himself by his side, \"tell me, Monsieur d'Herblay,\nwhat is our position with regard to the Belle-Isle affair, and whether\nyou have received any news about it.\"\n\n\"Everything is going on in that direction as we wish,\" replied Aramis;\n\"the expenses have been paid, and nothing has transpired of our\ndesigns.\"\n\n\"But what about the soldiers the king wished to send there?\"\n\n\"I have received news this morning they arrived there fifteen days ago.\"\n\n\"And how have they been treated?\"\n\n\"In the best manner possible.\"\n\n\"What has become of the former garrison?\"\n\n\"The soldiers were landed at Sarzeau, and then transferred immediately\nto Quimper.\"\n\n\"And the new garrison?\"\n\n\"Belongs to us from this very moment.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of what you say, my dear Monsieur de Vannes?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, and, moreover, you will see by and by how matters have\nturned out.\"\n\n\"Still you are very well aware, that, of all the garrison towns,\nBelle-Isle is precisely the very worst.\"\n\n\"I know it, and have acted accordingly; no space to move about, no\ngayety, no cheerful society, no gambling permitted: well, it is a great\npity,\" added Aramis, with one of those smiles so peculiar to him, \"to\nsee how much young people at the present day seek amusement, and how\nmuch, consequently, they incline to the man who procures and pays for\ntheir favorite pastimes.\"\n\n\"But if they amuse themselves at Bell-Isle?\"\n\n\"If they amuse themselves through the king's means, they will attach\nthemselves to the king; but if they get bored to death through the\nking's means, and amuse themselves through M. Fouquet, they will attach\nthemselves to M. Fouquet.\"\n\n\"And you informed my intendant, of course?--so that immediately on their\narrival--\"\n\n\"By no means; they were left alone a whole week, to weary themselves\nat their ease; but, at the end of the week, they cried out, saying that\nformer officers amused themselves much better. Whereupon they were told\nthat the old officers had been able to make a friend of M. Fouquet, and\nthat M. Fouquet, knowing them to be friends of his, had from that moment\ndone all he possibly could to prevent their getting wearied or\nbored upon his estates. Upon this they began to reflect. Immediately\nafterwards, however, the intendant added, that without anticipating M.\nFouquet's orders, he knew his master sufficiently well to be aware that\nhe took an interest in every gentleman in the king's service, and that,\nalthough he did not know the new-comers, he would do as much for them as\nhe had done for the others.\"\n\n\"Excellent! and I trust that the promises were followed up; I desire, as\nyou know, that no promise should ever be made in my name without being\nkept.\"\n\n\"Without a moment's loss of time, our two privateers, and your own\nhorses, were placed at the disposal of the officers; the keys of\nthe principal mansion were handed over to them, so that they made up\nhunting-parties, and walking excursions with such ladies as are to be\nfound in Belle-Isle; and such other as they are enabled to enlist from\nthe neighborhood, who have no fear of sea-sickness.\"\n\n\"And there is a fair sprinkling to be met with at Sarzeau and Vannes, I\nbelieve, your eminence?\"\n\n\"Yes; in fact all along the coast,\" said Aramis, quietly.\n\n\"And now, how about the soldiers?\"\n\n\"Everything precisely the same, in a relative degree, you understand;\nthe soldiers have plenty of wine, excellent provisions, and good pay.\"\n\n\"Very good; so that--\"\n\n\"So that this garrison can be depended upon, and it is a better one than\nthe last.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"The result is, if Fortune favors us, so that the garrisons are changed\nin this manner, only every two months, that, at the end of every\nthree years, the whole army will, in its turn, have been there; and,\ntherefore, instead of having one regiment in our favor, we shall have\nfifty thousand men.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I knew perfectly well,\" said Fouquet, \"that no friend could\nbe more incomparable and invaluable than yourself, my dear Monsieur\nd'Herblay; but,\" he added, laughing, \"all this time we are forgetting\nour friend, Du Vallon; what has become of him? During the three days I\nspent at Saint-Mande, I confess I have forgotten him completely.\"\n\n\"I do not forget him, however,\" returned Aramis. \"Porthos is at\nSaint-Mande; his joints are kept well greased, the greatest care is\nbeing taken care of him with regard to the food he eats, and the wines\nhe drinks; I advise him to take daily airings in the small park, which\nyou have kept for your own use, and he makes us of it accordingly. He\nbegins to walk again, he exercises his muscular powers by bending down\nyoung elm-trees, or making the old oaks fly into splinters, as Milo of\nCrotona used to do; and, as there are no lions in the park, it is not\nunlikely we shall find him alive. Porthos is a brave fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, but in the mean time he will get bored to death.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; he never does that.\"\n\n\"He will be asking questions?\"\n\n\"He sees no one.\"\n\n\"At all events, he is looking or hoping for something or another.\"\n\n\"I have inspired in him a hope which we will realize some fine morning,\nand on that he subsists.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That of being presented to the king.\"\n\n\"Oh! in what character?\"\n\n\"As the engineer of Belle-Isle, of course.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"Quite true.\"\n\n\"Shall we not be obliged, then, to send him back to Belle-Isle?\"\n\n\"Most certainly; I am even thinking of sending him as soon as possible.\nPorthos is very fond of display; he is man whose weakness D'Artagnan,\nAthos, and myself are alone acquainted with; he never commits himself\nin any way; he is dignity himself; to the officers there, he would seem\nlike a Paladin of the time of the Crusades. He would make the whole\nstaff drunk, without getting tipsy in the least himself, and every one\nwill regard him with admiration and sympathy; if, therefore, it should\nhappen that we have any orders requiring to be carried out, Porthos is\nan incarnation of the order itself, and whatever he chose to do others\nwould find themselves obliged to submit to.\"\n\n\"Send him back, then.\"\n\n\"That is what I intend to do; but only in a few days; for I must not\nomit to tell you one thing.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I begin to mistrust D'Artagnan. He is not at Fontainebleau, as you\nmay have noticed, and D'Artagnan is never absent, or apparently idle,\nwithout some object in view. And now that my own affairs are settled, I\nam going to try and ascertain what the affairs are in which D'Artagnan\nis engaged.\"\n\n\"Your own affairs are settled, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are very fortunate in that case, then, and I should like to be able\nto say the same.\"\n\n\"I hope you do not make yourself uneasy.\"\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better than the king's reception of you.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"And Colbert leaves you in peace.\"\n\n\"Nearly so.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Aramis, with that connection of ideas which marked\nhim, \"in that case, then, we can bestow a thought upon the young girl I\nwas speaking to you about yesterday.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"What, have you forgotten already? I mean La Valliere.\"\n\n\"Ah! of course, of course.\"\n\n\"Do you object, then, to try and make a conquest of her?\"\n\n\"In one respect only; my heart is engaged in another direction, and I\npositively do not care about the girl in the least.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Aramis, \"your heart is engaged, you say. The deuce! we\nmust take care of that.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it is terrible to have the heart occupied, when others, besides\nyourself, have so much need of the head.\"\n\n\"You are right. So you see, at your first summons, I left everything.\nBut to return to this girl. What good do you see in my troubling myself\nabout her?\"\n\n\"This.--The king, it is said, has taken a fancy to her; at least, so it\nis supposed.\"\n\n\"But you, who know everything, know very differently.\"\n\n\"I know that the king is greatly and suddenly changed; that the day\nbefore yesterday he was crazy over Madame; that a few days ago, Monsieur\ncomplained of it, even to the queen-mother; and that some conjugal\nmisunderstandings and maternal scoldings were the consequence.\"\n\n\"How do you know all that?\"\n\n\"I do know it; at all events, since these misunderstandings and\nscoldings, the king has not addressed a word, has not paid the slightest\nattention, to her royal highness.\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\"\n\n\"Since then, he has been taken up with Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\nNow, Mademoiselle de la Valliere is one of Madame's maids of honor. You\nhappen to know, I suppose, what is called a _chaperon_ in matters of\nlove. Well, then, Mademoiselle de la Valliere is Madame's _chaperon_.\nIt is for you to take advantage of this state of things. You have no\noccasion for me to tell you that. But, at all events, wounded vanity\nwill render the conquest an easier one; the girl will get hold of the\nking, and Madame's secret, and you can scarcely predict what a man of\nintelligence can do with a secret.\"\n\n\"But how to get at her?\"\n\n\"Nay, you, of all men, to ask me such a question!\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Very true. I shall not have any time to take any notice of her.\"\n\n\"She is poor and unassuming, you will create a position for her, and\nwhether she tames the king as his lady confessor, or his sweetheart, you\nwill have enlisted a new and valuable ally.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Fouquet. \"What is to be done, then, with regard to\nthis girl?\"\n\n\"Whenever you have taken a fancy to any lady, Monsieur Fouquet, what\ncourse have you generally pursued?\"\n\n\"I have written to her, protesting my devotion to her. I have added, how\nhappy I should be to render her any service in my power, and have signed\n'Fouquet,' at the end of the letter.\"\n\n\"And has any one offered resistance?\"\n\n\"One person only,\" replied Fouquet. \"But, four days ago, she yielded, as\nthe others had done.\"\n\n\"Will you take the trouble to write?\" said Aramis, holding a pen towards\nhim, which Fouquet took, saying:\n\n\"I will write at your dictation. My head is so taken up in another\ndirection, that I should not be able to write a couple lines.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Aramis, \"write.\"\n\nAnd he dictated, as follows: \"Mademoiselle--I have seen you--and you\nwill not be surprised to learn, I think you very beautiful. But, for\nwant of the position you merit at court, your presence there is a waste\nof time. The devotion of a man of honor, should ambition of any kind\ninspire you, might possibly serve as a means of display for your talent\nand beauty. I place my devotion at your feet; but, as an affection,\nhowever reserved and unpresuming it may be, might possibly compromise\nthe object of its worship, it would ill become a person of your merit\nrunning the risk of being compromised, without her future being assured.\nIf you would deign to accept, and reply to my affection, my affection\nshall prove its gratitude to you in making you free and independent\nforever.\"\n\nHaving finished writing, Fouquet looked at Aramis.\n\n\"Sign it,\" said the latter.\n\n\"Is it absolutely necessary?\"\n\n\"Your signature at the foot of that letter is worth a million; you\nforget that.\" Fouquet signed.\n\n\"Now, by whom do you intend to send this letter?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"By an excellent servant of mine.\"\n\n\"Can you rely on him?\"\n\n\"He is a man who has been with me all my life.\"\n\n\"Very well. Besides, in this case, we are not playing for very heavy\nstakes.\"\n\n\"How so? For if what you say be true of the accommodating disposition of\nthis girl for the king and Madame, the king will give her all the money\nshe can ask for.\"\n\n\"The king has money, then?\" asked Aramis.\n\n\"I suppose so, for he has not asked me for any more.\"\n\n\"Be easy, he will ask for some, soon.\"\n\n\"Nay, more than that, I had thought he would have spoken to me about the\n_fete_ at Vaux, but he never said a word about it.\"\n\n\"He will be sure to do so, though.\"\n\n\"You must think the king's disposition a very cruel one, Monsieur\nd'Herblay.\"\n\n\"It is not he who is so.\"\n\n\"He is young, and therefore his disposition is a kind one.\"\n\n\"He is young, and either he is weak, or his passions are strong; and\nMonsieur Colbert holds his weakness and his passions in his villainous\ngrasp.\"\n\n\"You admit that you fear him?\"\n\n\"I do not deny it.\"\n\n\"I that case I am lost.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"My only influence with the king has been through the money I commanded,\nand now I am a ruined man.\"\n\n\"Not so.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'not so?' Do you know my affairs better than\nmyself?\"\n\n\"That is not unlikely.\"\n\n\"If he were to request this _fete_ to be given?\"\n\n\"You would give it, of course.\"\n\n\"But where is the money to come from?\"\n\n\"Have you ever been in want of any?\"\n\n\"Oh! if you only knew at what a cost I procured the last supply.\"\n\n\"The next shall cost you nothing.\"\n\n\"But who will give it me?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"What, give me six millions?\"\n\n\"Ten, if necessary.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, D'Herblay,\" said Fouquet, \"your confidence alarms me more\nthan the king's displeasure. Who can you possibly be, after all?\"\n\n\"You know me well enough, I should think.\"\n\n\"Of course; but what is it you are aiming at?\"\n\n\"I wish to see upon the throne of France a king devoted to Monsieur\nFouquet, and I wish Monsieur Fouquet to be devoted to me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Fouquet, pressing his hand,--\"as for being devoted to\nyou, I am yours, entirely; but believe me, my dear D'Herblay, you are\ndeceiving yourself.\"\n\n\"In what respect?\"\n\n\"The king will never become devoted to me.\"\n\n\"I do not remember to have said that King Louis would ever become\ndevoted to you.\"\n\n\"Why, on the contrary, you have this moment said so.\"\n\n\"I did not say _the_ king; I said _a_ king.\"\n\n\"Is it not all the same?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary, it is altogether different.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"You will do so, shortly, then; suppose, for instance, the king in\nquestion were to be a very different person to Louis XIV.\"\n\n\"Another person.\"\n\n\"Yes, who is indebted for everything to you.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"His very throne, even.\"\n\n\"You are mad, D'Herblay. There is no man living besides Louis XIV. who\ncan sit on the throne of France. I know of none, not one.\"\n\n\"_But_ I know one.\"\n\n\"Unless it be Monsieur,\" said Fouquet, looking at Aramis uneasily; \"yet\nMonsieur--\"\n\n\"It is _not_ Monsieur.\"\n\n\"But how can it be, that a prince not of the royal line, that a prince\nwithout any right--\"\n\n\"My king, or rather your king, will be everything that is necessary, be\nassured of that.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Monsieur d'Herblay, you make my blood run cold, and my head\nswim.\"\n\nAramis smiled. \"There is but little occasion for that,\" he replied.\n\n\"Again, I repeat, you terrify me,\" said Fouquet. Aramis smiled.\n\n\"You laugh,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"The day will come when you will laugh too; only at the present moment I\nmust laugh alone.\"\n\n\"But explain yourself.\"\n\n\"When the proper time comes, I will explain all. Fear nothing. Have\nfaith in me, and doubt nothing.\"\n\n\"The fact is, I cannot but doubt, because I do not see clearly, or even\nat all.\"\n\n\"That is because of your blindness; but a day will come when you will be\nenlightened.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Fouquet, \"how willingly would I believe.\"\n\n\"You, without belief! you, who, through my means, have ten times crossed\nthe abyss yawning at your feet, and in which, had you been alone, you\nwould have been irretrievably swallowed; you, without belief; you, who\nfrom procureur-general attained the rank of intendant, from the rank\nof intendant, that of the first minister of the crown, and who from the\nrank of first minister will pass to that of mayor of the palace. But\nno,\" he said, with the same unaltered smile, \"no, no, you cannot see,\nand consequently cannot believe--what I tell you.\" And Aramis rose to\nwithdraw.\n\n\"One word more,\" said Fouquet; \"you have never yet spoken to me in this\nmanner, you have never yet shown yourself so confident, I should rather\nsay so daring.\"\n\n\"Because it is necessary, in order to speak confidently, to have the\nlips unfettered.\"\n\n\"And that is now your case?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Since a very short time, then?\"\n\n\"Since yesterday, only.\"\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur d'Herblay, take care, your confidence is becoming\naudacity.\"\n\n\"One can well be audacious when one is powerful.\"\n\n\"And you are powerful?\"\n\n\"I have already offered you ten millions; I repeat the offer.\"\n\nFouquet rose, profoundly agitated.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"come; you spoke of overthrowing kings and replacing\nthem by others. If, indeed, I am not really out of my senses, is or is\nnot that what you said just now?\"\n\n\"You are by no means out of your senses, for it is perfectly true I did\nsay all that just now.\"\n\n\"And why did you say so?\"\n\n\"Because it is easy to speak in this manner of thrones being cast down,\nand kings being raised up, when one is, one's self, far above all kings\nand thrones, of this world at least.\"\n\n\"Your power is infinite, then?\" cried Fouquet.\n\n\"I have told you so already, and I repeat it,\" replied Aramis, with\nglistening eyes and trembling lips.\n\nFouquet threw himself back in his chair, and buried his face in\nhis hands. Aramis looked at him for a moment, as the angel of human\ndestinies might have looked upon a simple mortal.\n\n\"Adieu,\" he said to him, \"sleep undisturbed, and send your letter to La\nValliere. To-morrow we shall see each other again.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow,\" said Fouquet, shaking his hands like a man returning\nto his senses. \"But where shall we see each other?\"\n\n\"At the king's promenade, if you like.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" And they separated.\n\n\n\nChapter LXI. The Storm.\n\nThe dawn of the following day was dark and gloomy, and as every one knew\nthat the promenade was down in the royal programme, every one's gaze, as\nhis eyes were opened, was directed towards the sky. Just above the tops\nof the trees a thick, suffocating vapor seemed to remain suspended, with\nbarely sufficient power to rise thirty feet above the ground under the\ninfluence of the sun's rays, which was scarcely visible as a faint spot\nof lesser darkness through the veil of heavy mist. No dew had fallen\nin the morning; the turf was dried up for want of moisture, the flowers\nwithered. The birds sang less inspiringly than usual upon the boughs,\nwhich remained motionless as the limbs of corpses. The strange confused\nand animated murmurs, which seemed born and to exist in virtue of the\nsun, that respiration of nature which is unceasingly heard amidst all\nother sounds, could not be heard now, and never had the silence been so\nprofound.\n\nThe king had noticed the cheerless aspect of the heavens as he\napproached the window immediately upon rising. But as all the\nnecessary directions had been given respecting the promenade, and\nevery preparation had been made accordingly, and as, which was far\nmore imperious than anything else, Louis relied upon this promenade to\nsatisfy the cravings of his imagination, and we will even already say,\nthe clamorous desires of his heart--the king unhesitatingly decided\nthat the appearance of the heavens had nothing whatever to do with the\nmatter; that the promenade was arranged, and that, whatever the state of\nthe weather, the promenade should take place. Besides, there are\ncertain terrestrial sovereigns who seem to have accorded them privileged\nexistences, and there are certain times when it might almost be supposed\nthat the expressed wish of an earthly monarch has its influence over the\nDivine will. It was Virgil who observed of Augustus: _Nocte pluit tota\nredeunt spectacula mane_. [10]\n\nLouis attended mass as usual, but it was evident that his attention was\nsomewhat distracted from the presence of the Creator by the remembrance\nof the creature. His mind was occupied during the service in reckoning\nmore than once the number of minutes, then of seconds, which separated\nhim from the blissful moment when the promenade would begin, that is\nto say, the moment when Madame would set out with her maids of honor.\nBesides, as a matter of course, everybody at the chateau was ignorant\nof the interview which had taken place between La Valliere and the king.\nMontalais, perhaps, with her usual chattering propensity, might have\nbeen disposed to talk about it; but Montalais on this occasion was held\nin check by Malicorne, who had securely fastened on her pretty lips the\ngolden padlock of mutual interest. As for Louis XIV., his happiness was\nso extreme that he had forgiven Madame, or nearly so, her little\npiece of malice of the previous evening. In fact, he had occasion to\ncongratulate himself rather than to complain of it. Had it not been for\nher ill-natured action, he would not have received the letter from\nLa Valliere; had it not been for the letter, he would have had no\ninterview; and had it not been for the interview he would have remained\nundecided. His heart was filled with too much happiness for any\nill-feeling to remain in it, at that moment at least. Instead,\ntherefore, of knitting his brows into a frown when he perceived his\nsister-in-law, Louis resolved to receive her in a more friendly and\ngracious manner than usual. But on one condition only, that she would be\nready to set out early. Such was the nature of Louis's thoughts during\nmass; which made him, during the ceremony, forget matters which, in his\ncharacter of Most Christian King and of the eldest son of the Church,\nought to have occupied his attention. He returned to the chateau, and\nas the promenade was fixed for midday, and it was at present just ten\no'clock, he set to work desperately with Colbert and Lyonne. But even\nwhile he worked Louis went from the table to the window, inasmuch as the\nwindow looked out upon Madame's pavilion: he could see M. Fouquet in the\ncourtyard, to whom the courtiers, since the favor shown towards him\non the previous evening, paid greater attention than ever. The king,\ninstinctively, on noticing Fouquet, turned towards Colbert, who was\nsmiling, and seemed full of benevolence and delight, a state of feeling\nwhich had arisen from the very moment one of his secretaries had entered\nand handed him a pocket-book, which he had put unopened into his pocket.\nBut, as there was always something sinister at the bottom of any delight\nexpressed by Colbert, Louis preferred, of the smiles of the two men,\nthat of Fouquet. He beckoned to the superintendent to come up, and\nturning towards Lyonne and Colbert, he said:--\"Finish this matter, place\nit on my desk, and I will read it at my leisure.\" And he left the\nroom. At the sign the king had made to him, Fouquet had hastened up\nthe staircase, while Aramis, who was with the superintendent, quietly\nretired among the group of courtiers and disappeared without having been\neven observed by the king. The king and Fouquet met at the top of the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Fouquet, remarking the gracious manner in which Louis was\nabout to receive him, \"your majesty has overwhelmed me with kindness\nduring the last few days. It is not a youthful monarch, but a being of\nhigher order, who reigns over France, one whom pleasure, happiness, and\nlove acknowledge as their master.\" The king colored. The compliment,\nalthough flattering, was not the less somewhat pointed. Louis\nconducted Fouquet to a small room that divided his study from his\nsleeping-apartment.\n\n\"Do you know why I summoned you?\" said the king as he seated himself\nupon the edge of the window, so as not to lose anything that might be\npassing in the gardens which fronted the opposite entrance to Madame's\npavilion.\n\n\"No, sire,\" replied Fouquet, \"but I am sure for something agreeable, if\nI am to judge from your majesty's gracious smile.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, then.\"\n\n\"I, sire?\"\n\n\"For I summoned you, on the contrary, to pick a quarrel with you.\"\n\n\"With me, sire?\"\n\n\"Yes: and that a serious one.\"\n\n\"Your majesty alarms me--and yet I was most confident in your justice\nand goodness.\"\n\n\"Do you know I am told, Monsieur Fouquet, that you are preparing a grand\n_fete_ at Vaux.\"\n\nFouquet smiled, as a sick man would do at the first shiver of a fever\nwhich has left him but returns again.\n\n\"And that you have not invited me!\" continued the king.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Fouquet, \"I have not even thought of the _fete_ you\nspeak of, and it was only yesterday evening that one of my _friends_,\"\nFouquet laid a stress upon the word, \"was kind enough to make me think\nof it.\"\n\n\"Yet I saw you yesterday evening, Monsieur Fouquet, and you said nothing\nto me about it.\"\n\n\"How dared I hope that your majesty would so greatly descend from your\nown exalted station as to honor my dwelling with your royal presence?\"\n\n\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur Fouquet, you did not speak to me about your\n_fete_.\"\n\n\"I did not allude to the _fete_ to your majesty, I repeat, in the\nfirst place, because nothing had been decided with regard to it, and,\nsecondly, because I feared a refusal.\"\n\n\"And something made you fear a refusal, Monsieur Fouquet? You see I am\ndetermined to push you hard.\"\n\n\"The profound wish I had that your majesty should accept my\ninvitation--\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Fouquet, nothing is easier, I perceive, than our coming\nto an understanding. Your wish is to invite me to your _fete_, my own is\nto be present at it; invite me and I will go.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that your majesty will deign to accept?\" murmured the\nsuperintendent.\n\n\"Why, really, monsieur,\" said the king, laughing, \"I think I do more\nthan accept; I rather fancy I am inviting myself.\"\n\n\"Your majesty overwhelms me with honor and delight,\" exclaimed Fouquet,\n\"but I shall be obliged to repeat what M. Vieuville said to your\nancestor, Henry IV., _Domine non sum dignus_.\" [11]\n\n\"To which I reply, Monsieur Fouquet, that if you give a _fete_, I will\ngo, whether I am invited or not.\"\n\n\"I thank your majesty deeply,\" said Fouquet, as he raised his head\nbeneath this favor, which he was convinced would be his ruin.\n\n\"But how could your majesty have been informed of it?\"\n\n\"By a public rumor, Monsieur Fouquet, which says such wonderful things\nof yourself and the marvels of your house. Would you become proud,\nMonsieur Fouquet, if the king were to be jealous of you?\"\n\n\"I should be the happiest man in the world, sire, since the very day\non which your majesty were to be jealous of Vaux, I should possess\nsomething worthy of being offered to you.\"\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur Fouquet, prepare your _fete_, and open the door of\nyour house as wide as possible.\"\n\n\"It is for your majesty to fix the day.\"\n\n\"This day month, then.\"\n\n\"Has your majesty any further commands?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Monsieur Fouquet, except from the present moment until then to\nhave you near me as much as possible.\"\n\n\"I have the honor to form one of your majesty's party for the\npromenade.\"\n\n\"Very good; indeed, I am now setting out; for there are the ladies, I\nsee, who are going to start.\"\n\nWith this remark, the king, with all the eagerness, not only of a young\nman, but of a young man in love, withdrew from the window, in order\nto take his gloves and cane, which his valet held ready for him. The\nneighing of the horses and the crunching of the wheels on the gravel of\nthe courtyard could be distinctly heard. The king descended the stairs,\nand at the moment he appeared upon the flight of steps, every\none stopped. The king walked straight up to the young queen. The\nqueen-mother, who was still suffering more than ever from the illness\nwith which she was afflicted, did not wish to go out. Maria Theresa\naccompanied Madame in her carriage, and asked the king in what direction\nhe wished the promenade to drive. The king, who had just seen La\nValliere, still pale from the event of the previous evening, get into\na carriage with three of her companions, told the queen that he had no\npreference, and wherever she would like to go, there would he be with\nher. The queen then desired that the outriders should proceed in the\ndirection of Apremont. The outriders set off accordingly before the\nothers. The king rode on horseback, and for a few minutes accompanied\nthe carriage of the queen and Madame. The weather had cleared up a\nlittle, but a kind of veil of dust, like a thick gauze, was still spread\nover the surface of the heavens, and the sun made every atom glisten\nwithin the circuit of its rays. The heat was stifling; but, as the king\ndid not seem to pay any attention to the appearance of the heavens, no\none made himself uneasy about it, and the promenade, in obedience to the\norders given by the queen, took its course in the direction of Apremont.\nThe courtiers who followed were in the very highest spirits; it was\nevident that every one tried to forget, and to make others forget, the\nbitter discussions of the previous evening. Madame, particularly, was\ndelightful. In fact, seeing the king at the door of her carriage, as she\ndid not suppose he would be there for the queen's sake, she hoped that\nher prince had returned to her. Hardly, however, had they proceeded a\nquarter of a mile on the road, when the king, with a gracious smile,\nsaluted them and drew up his horse, leaving the queen's carriage to pass\non, then that of the principal ladies of honor, and then all the others\nin succession, who, seeing the king stop, wished in their turn to stop\ntoo; but the king made a sign to them to continue their progress. When\nLa Valliere's carriage passed, the king approached it, saluted the\nladies who were inside, and was preparing to accompany the carriage\ncontaining the maids of honor, in the same way he had followed that in\nwhich Madame was, when suddenly the whole file of carriages stopped. It\nwas probable that Madame, uneasy at the king having left her, had just\ngiven directions for the performance of this maneuver, the direction in\nwhich the promenade was to take place having been left to her. The king,\nhaving sent to inquire what her object was in stopping the cavalcade,\nwas informed in reply, that she wished to walk. She most likely hoped\nthat the king, who was following the carriages of the maids of honor on\nhorseback, would not venture to follow the maids of honor themselves on\nfoot. They had arrived in the middle of the forest.\n\nThe promenade, in fact, was not ill-timed, especially for those who were\ndreamers or lovers. From the little open space where the halt had taken\nplace, three beautiful long walks, shady and undulating, stretched out\nbefore them. These walks were covered with moss or with leaves that\nformed a carpet from the loom of nature; and each walk had its horizon\nin the distance, consisting of about a hand-breadth of sky, apparent\nthrough the interlacing of the branches of the trees. At the end of\nalmost every walk, evidently in great tribulation and uneasiness, the\nstartled deer were seen hurrying to and fro, first stopping for a moment\nin the middle of the path, and then raising their heads they fled with\nthe speed of an arrow or bounded into the depths of the forest, where\nthey disappeared from view; now and then a rabbit, of philosophical\nmien, might be noticed quietly sitting upright, rubbing his muzzle\nwith his fore paws, and looking about inquiringly, as though wondering\nwhether all these people, who were approaching in his direction, and\nwho had just disturbed him in his meditations and his meal, were not\nfollowed by their dogs, or had not their guns under their arms. All\nalighted from their carriages as soon as they observed that the queen\nwas doing so. Maria Theresa took the arm of one of her ladies of honor,\nand, with a side glance towards the king, who did not perceive that he\nwas in the slightest degree the object of the queen's attention, entered\nthe forest by the first path before her. Two of the outriders preceded\nher majesty with long poles, which they used for the purpose of putting\nthe branches of the trees aside, or removing the bushes that might\nimpede her progress. As soon as Madame alighted, she found the Comte\nde Guiche at her side, who bowed and placed himself at her disposal.\nMonsieur, delighted with his bath of the two previous days, had\nannounced his preference for the river, and, having given De Guiche\nleave of absence, remained at the chateau with the Chevalier de Lorraine\nand Manicamp. He was not in the slightest degree jealous. He had been\nlooked for to no purpose among those present; but as Monsieur was a man\nwho thought a great deal of himself, and usually added very little to\nthe general pleasure, his absence was rather a subject of satisfaction\nthan regret. Every one had followed the example which the queen and\nMadame had set, doing just as they pleased, according as chance or fancy\ninfluenced them. The king, we have already observed, remained near La\nValliere, and, throwing himself off his horse at the moment the door of\nher carriage was opened, he offered her his hand to alight. Montalais\nand Tonnay-Charente immediately drew back and kept at a distance; the\nformer from calculated, the latter from natural motives. There was this\ndifference, however, between the two, that the one had withdrawn from\na wish to please the king, the other for a very opposite reason. During\nthe last half-hour the weather also had undergone a change; the veil\nwhich had been spread over the sky, as if driven by a blast of heated\nair, had become massed together in the western part of the heavens;\nand afterwards, as if driven by a current of air from the opposite\ndirection, was now advancing slowly and heavily towards them. The\napproach of the storm could be felt, but as the king did not perceive\nit, no one thought it proper to do so. The promenade was therefore\ncontinued; some of the company, with minds ill at ease on the subject,\nraised their eyes from time to time towards the sky; others, even more\ntimid still, walked about without wandering too far from the carriages,\nwhere they relied upon taking shelter in case the storm burst. The\ngreater number of these, however, observing that the king fearlessly\nentered the wood with La Valliere, followed his majesty. The king,\nnoticing this, took La Valliere's hand, and led her to a lateral\nforest-alley; where no one this time ventured to follow him.\n\n\n\nChapter LXII. The Shower of Rain.\n\nAt this moment, and in the same direction, too, that the king and La\nValliere had taken, except that they were in the wood itself instead of\nfollowing the path, two men were walking together, utterly indifferent\nto the appearance of the heavens. Their heads were bent down in the\nmanner of people occupied with matters of great moment. They had not\nobserved either De Guiche or Madame, the king or La Valliere. Suddenly\nsomething fell through the air like a colossal sheet of flame, followed\nby a loud but distant rumbling noise.\n\n\"Ah!\" said one of them, raising his head, \"here comes the storm. Let us\nreach our carriages, my dear D'Herblay.\"\n\nAramis looked inquiringly at the heavens. \"There is no occasion to hurry\nyet,\" he said; and then resuming the conversation where it had doubtless\nbeen interrupted, he said, \"You were observing that the letter we wrote\nlast evening must by this time have reached its destination?\"\n\n\"I was saying that she certainly has it.\"\n\n\"Whom did you send it by?\"\n\n\"By my own servant, as I have already told you.\"\n\n\"Did he bring back an answer?\"\n\n\"I have not seen him since; the young girl was probably in attendance\non Madame, or was in her own room dressing, and he may have had to\nwait. Our time for leaving arrived, and we set off, of course; I cannot,\ntherefore, know what is going on yonder.\"\n\n\"Did you see the king before leaving?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How did he seem?\"\n\n\"Nothing could have passed off better, or worse; according as he be\nsincere or hypocritical.\"\n\n\"And the _fete?_\"\n\n\"Will take place in a month.\"\n\n\"He invited himself, you say?\"\n\n\"With a pertinacity in which I detected Colbert's influence. But has not\nlast night removed your illusions?\"\n\n\"What illusions?\"\n\n\"With respect to the assistance you may be able to give me under these\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"No; I have passed the night writing, and all my orders are given.\"\n\n\"Do not conceal it from yourself, D'Herblay, but the _fete_ will cost\nsome millions.\"\n\n\"I will supply six; do you on your side get two or three.\"\n\n\"You are a wonderful man, my dear D'Herblay.\"\n\nAramis smiled.\n\n\"But,\" inquired Fouquet, with some remaining uneasiness, \"how is it that\nwhile you are now squandering millions in this manner, a few days ago\nyou did not pay the fifty thousand francs to Baisemeaux out of your own\npocket?\"\n\n\"Because a few days ago I was as poor as Job.\"\n\n\"And to-day?\"\n\n\"To-day I am wealthier than the king himself.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Fouquet; \"I understand men pretty well; I know you are\nincapable of forfeiting your word; I do not wish to wrest your secret\nfrom you, and so let us talk no more about it.\"\n\nAt this moment a dull, heavy rumbling was heard, which suddenly\ndeveloped into a violent clap of thunder.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Fouquet, \"I was quite right in what I said.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Aramis, \"let us rejoin the carriages.\"\n\n\"We shall not have time,\" said Fouquet, \"for here comes the rain.\"\n\nIn fact, as he spoke, and as if the heavens were opened, a shower of\nlarge drops of rain was suddenly heard pattering on the leaves about\nthem.\n\n\"We shall have time,\" said Aramis, \"to reach the carriages before the\nfoliage becomes saturated.\"\n\n\"It will be better,\" said Fouquet, \"to take shelter somewhere--in a\ngrotto, for instance.\"\n\n\"Yes, but where are we to find a grotto?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"I know one,\" said Fouquet, smiling, \"not ten paces from here.\" Then\nlooking round him, he added: \"Yes, we are quite right.\"\n\n\"You are very fortunate to have so good a memory,\" said Aramis, smiling\nin his turn, \"but are you not afraid that your coachman, finding we do\nnot return, will suppose we have taken another road back, and that he\nwill not follow the carriages belonging to the court?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no fear of that,\" said Fouquet; \"whenever I place my\ncoachman and my carriage in any particular spot, nothing but an express\norder from the king could stir them; and more than that, too, it seems\nthat we are not the only ones who have come so far, for I hear footsteps\nand the sound of voices.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Fouquet turned round, and opened with his cane a mass of\nfoliage which hid the path from his view. Aramis's glance as well as his\nown plunged at the same moment through the aperture he had made.\n\n\"A woman,\" said Aramis.\n\n\"And a man,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"It is La Valliere and the king,\" they both exclaimed together.\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Aramis, \"is his majesty aware of your cavern as well?\nI should not be astonished if he were, for he seems to be on very good\nterms with the dryads of Fontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Fouquet; \"let us get there. If he is not aware of\nit, we shall see what he will do if he should know it, as it has two\nentrances, so that whilst he enters by one, we can leave by the other.\"\n\n\"Is it far?\" asked Aramis, \"for the rain is beginning to penetrate.\"\n\n\"We are there now,\" said Fouquet, as he pushed aside a few branches, and\nan excavation in the solid rock could be observed, hitherto concealed by\nheaths, ivy, and a thick covert of small shrubs.\n\nFouquet led the way, followed by Aramis; but as the latter entered the\ngrotto, he turned round, saying: \"Yes, they are entering the wood; and,\nsee, they are bending their steps this way.\"\n\n\"Very well; let us make room for them,\" said Fouquet, smiling and\npulling Aramis by his cloak; \"but I do not think the king knows of my\ngrotto.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aramis, \"they are looking about them, but it is only for a\nthicker tree.\"\n\nAramis was not mistaken, the king's looks were directed upward, and not\naround him. He held La Valliere's arm within his own, and held her hand\nin his. La Valliere's feet began to sleep on the damp grass. Louis again\nlooked round him with greater attention than before, and perceiving an\nenormous oak with wide-spreading branches, he hurriedly drew La Valliere\nbeneath its protecting shelter. The poor girl looked round her on all\nsides, and seemed half afraid, half desirous of being followed. The\nking made her lean back against the trunk of the tree, whose vast\ncircumference, protected by the thickness of the foliage, was as dry as\nif at that moment the rain had not been falling in torrents. He himself\nremained standing before her with his head uncovered. After a few\nminutes, however, some drops of rain penetrated through the branches of\nthe tree and fell on the king's forehead, who did not pay any attention\nto them.\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" murmured La Valliere, pushing the king's hat towards him.\nBut the king simply bowed, and determinedly refused to cover his head.\n\n\"Now or never is the time to offer your place,\" said Fouquet in Aramis's\near.\n\n\"Now or never is the time to listen, and not lose a syllable of what\nthey may have to say to each other,\" replied Aramis in Fouquet's ear.\n\nIn fact they both remained perfectly silent, and the king's voice\nreached them where they were.\n\n\"Believe me,\" said the king, \"I perceive, or rather I can imagine your\nuneasiness; believe me, I sincerely regret having isolated you from the\nrest of the company, and brought you, also, to a spot where you will be\ninconvenienced by the rain. You are wet already, and perhaps cold too?\"\n\n\"No, sire.\"\n\n\"And yet you tremble?\"\n\n\"I am afraid, sire, that my absence may be misinterpreted; at a moment,\ntoo, when all the others are reunited.\"\n\n\"I would not hesitate to propose returning to the carriages,\nMademoiselle de la Valliere, but pray look and listen, and tell me if it\nbe possible to attempt to make the slightest progress at present?\"\n\nIn fact the thunder was still rolling, and the rain continued to fall in\ntorrents.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued the king, \"no possible interpretation can be made\nwhich would be to your discredit. Are you not with the king of France;\nin other words, with the first gentleman of the kingdom?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sire,\" replied La Valliere, \"and it is a very distinguished\nhonor for me; it is not, therefore, for myself that I fear any\ninterpretations that may be made.\"\n\n\"For whom, then?\"\n\n\"For you, sire.\"\n\n\"For _me?_\" said the king, smiling, \"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Has your majesty already forgotten what took place yesterday evening in\nher royal highness's apartments?\"\n\n\"Oh! forget that, I beg, or allow me to remember it for no other purpose\nthan to thank you once more for your letter, and--\"\n\n\"Sire,\" interrupted La Valliere, \"the rain is falling, and your\nmajesty's head is uncovered.\"\n\n\"I entreat you not to think of anything but yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh! I,\" said La Valliere, smiling, \"I am a country girl, accustomed\nto roaming through the meadows of the Loire and the gardens of Blois,\nwhatever the weather may be. And, as for my clothes,\" she added, looking\nat her simple muslin dress, \"your majesty sees there is but little room\nfor injury.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I have already noticed, more than once, that you owed nearly\neverything to yourself and nothing to your toilette. Your freedom from\ncoquetry is one of your greatest charms in my eyes.\"\n\n\"Sire, do not make me out better than I am, and say merely, 'You cannot\npossibly be a coquette.'\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said La Valliere, smiling, \"I am not rich.\"\n\n\"You admit, then,\" said the king, quickly, \"that you have a love for\nbeautiful things?\"\n\n\"Sire, I only regard those things as beautiful which are within my\nreach. Everything which is too highly placed for me--\"\n\n\"You are indifferent to?\"\n\n\"Is foreign to me, as being prohibited.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the king, \"do not find that you are at my court on\nthe footing you should be. The services of your family have not been\nsufficiently brought under my notice. The advancement of your family was\ncruelly neglected by my uncle.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sire. His royal highness, the Duke of Orleans, was\nalways exceedingly kind towards M. de Saint-Remy, my step-father. The\nservices rendered were humble, and, properly speaking, our services have\nbeen adequately recognized. It is not every one who is happy enough to\nfind opportunities of serving his sovereign with distinction. I have no\ndoubt at all, that, if ever opportunities had been met with, my family's\nactions would have been as lofty as their loyalty was firm: but that\nhappiness was never ours.\"\n\n\"In that case, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, it belongs to kings to\nrepair the want of opportunity, and most delightedly do I undertake to\nrepair, in your instance, and with the least possible delay, the wrongs\nof fortune towards you.\"\n\n\"Nay, sire,\" cried La Valliere, eagerly; \"leave things, I beg, as they\nare now.\"\n\n\"Is it possible! you refuse what I ought, and what I wish to do for\nyou?\"\n\n\"All I desired has been granted me, when the honor was conferred upon me\nof forming one of Madame's household.\"\n\n\"But if you refuse for yourself, at least accept for your family.\"\n\n\"Your generous intentions, sire, bewilder me and make me apprehensive,\nfor, in doing for my family what your kindness urges you to do, your\nmajesty will raise up enemies for us, and enemies for yourself, too.\nLeave me in the ranks of middle life, sire; of all the feelings and\nsentiments I experience, leave me to enjoy the pleasing instinct of\ndisinterestedness.\"\n\n\"The sentiments you express,\" said the king, \"are indeed admirable.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" murmured Aramis in Fouquet's ear, \"and he cannot be\naccustomed to them.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied Fouquet, \"suppose she were to make a similar reply to my\nletter.\"\n\n\"True!\" said Aramis, \"let us not anticipate, but wait the conclusion.\"\n\n\"And then, dear Monsieur d'Herblay,\" added the superintendent, hardly\nable to appreciate the sentiments which La Valliere had just expressed,\n\"it is very often sound calculation to seem disinterested with\nmonarchs.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was thinking this very minute,\" said Aramis. \"Let us\nlisten.\"\n\nThe king approached nearer to La Valliere, and as the rain dripped more\nand more through the foliage of the oak, he held his hat over the head\nof the young girl, who raised her beautiful blue eyes towards the royal\nhat which sheltered her, and shook her head, sighing deeply as she did\nso.\n\n\"What melancholy thought,\" said the king, \"can possibly reach your heart\nwhen I place mine as a rampart before it?\"\n\n\"I will tell you, sire. I had already once before broached this\nquestion, which is so difficult for a young girl of my age to discuss,\nbut your majesty imposed silence on me. Your majesty belongs not\nto yourself alone: you are married; and every sentiment which would\nseparate your majesty from the queen, in leading you to take notice\nof me, will be a source of profoundest sorrow for the queen.\" The\nking endeavored to interrupt the young girl, but she continued with a\nsuppliant gesture. \"The Queen Maria, with an attachment which can be\nwell understood, follows with her eyes every step of your majesty which\nseparates you from her. Happy enough in having had her fate united to\nyour own, she weepingly implores Heaven to preserve you to her, and is\njealous of the faintest throb of your heart bestowed elsewhere.\" The\nking again seemed anxious to speak, but again did La Valliere venture to\nprevent him.--\"Would it not, therefore, be a most blamable action,\" she\ncontinued, \"if your majesty, a witness of this anxious and disinterested\naffection, gave the queen any cause for jealousy? Forgive me, sire, for\nthe expressions I have used. I well know it is impossible, or rather\nthat it would be impossible, that the greatest queen of the whole world\ncould be jealous of a poor girl like myself. But though a queen, she is\nstill a woman, and her heart, like that of the rest of her sex, cannot\nclose itself against the suspicions which such as are evilly disposed,\ninsinuate. For Heaven's sake, sire, think no more of me; I am unworthy\nof your regard.\"\n\n\"Do you not know that in speaking as you have done, you change my esteem\nfor you into the profoundest admiration?\"\n\n\"Sire, you assume my words to be contrary to the truth; you suppose me\nto be better than I really am, and attach a greater merit to me than God\never intended should be the case. Spare me, sire; for, did I not know\nthat your majesty was the most generous man in your kingdom, I should\nbelieve you were jesting.\"\n\n\"You do not, I know, fear such a thing; I am quite sure of that,\"\nexclaimed Louis.\n\n\"I shall be obliged to believe it, if your majesty continues to hold\nsuch language towards me.\"\n\n\"I am most unhappy, then,\" said the king, in a tone of regret which was\nnot assumed; \"I am the unhappiest prince in the Christian world, since\nI am powerless to induce belief in my words, in one whom I love the best\nin the wide world, and who almost breaks my heart by refusing to credit\nmy regard for her.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" said La Valliere, gently putting the king aside, who had\napproached nearer to her, \"I think the storm has passed away now, and\nthe rain has ceased.\" At the very moment, however, as the poor girl,\nfleeing as it were from her own heart, which doubtless throbbed but too\nwell in unison with the king's, uttered these words, the storm undertook\nto contradict her. A dead-white flash of lightning illumined the\nforest with a weird glare, and a peal of thunder, like a discharge of\nartillery, burst over their heads, as if the height of the oak that\nsheltered them had attracted the storm. The young girl could not repress\na cry of terror. The king with one hand drew her towards his heart, and\nstretched the other above her head, as though to shield her from the\nlightning. A moment's silence ensued, as the group, delightful as\neverything young and loving is delightful, remained motionless, while\nFouquet and Aramis contemplated it in attitudes as motionless as La\nValliere and the king. \"Oh, sire!\" murmured La Valliere, \"do you hear?\"\nand her head fell upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king. \"You see, the storm has not passed away.\"\n\n\"_It is a warning, sire_.\" The king smiled. \"Sire, it is the voice of\nHeaven in anger.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said the king. \"I agree to accept that peal of thunder as\na warning, and even as a menace, if, in five minutes from the present\nmoment, it is renewed with equal violence; but if not, permit me to\nthink that the storm is a storm simply, and nothing more.\" And the king,\nat the same moment, raised his head, as if to interrogate the heavens.\nBut, as if the remark had been heard and accepted, during the five\nminutes which elapsed after the burst of thunder which had alarmed them,\nno renewed peal was heard; and, when the thunder was again heard, it was\npassing as plainly as if, during those same five minutes, the storm, put\nto flight, had traversed the heavens with the wings of the wind. \"Well,\nLouise,\" said the king, in a low tone of voice, \"do you still threaten\nme with the anger of Heaven? and, since you wished to regard the storm\nas a warning, do you still believe it bodes misfortune?\"\n\nThe young girl looked up, and saw that while they had been talking, the\nrain had penetrated the foliage above them, and was trickling down\nthe king's face. \"Oh, sire, sire!\" she exclaimed, in accents of eager\napprehensions, which greatly agitated the king. \"Is it for me,\" she\nmurmured, \"that the king remains thus uncovered, and exposed to the\nrain? What am I, then?\"\n\n\"You are, you perceive,\" said the king, \"the divinity who dissipates the\nstorm, and brings back fine weather.\" In fact, even as the king spoke,\na ray of sunlight streamed through the forest, and caused the rain-drops\nwhich rested upon the leaves, or fell vertically among the openings in\nthe branches of the trees, to glisten like diamonds.\n\n\"Sire,\" said La Valliere, almost overcome, but making a powerful effort\nover herself, \"think of the anxieties your majesty will have to submit\nto on my account. At this very moment, they are seeking you in every\ndirection. The queen must be full of uneasiness; and Madame--oh,\nMadame!\" the young girl exclaimed, with an expression almost resembling\nterror.\n\nThis name had a certain effect upon the king. He started, and disengaged\nhimself from La Valliere, whom he had, till that moment, held pressed\nagainst his heart. He then advanced towards the path, in order to look\nround, and returned, somewhat thoughtfully, to La Valliere. \"Madame, did\nyou say?\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yes, Madame; she, too, is jealous,\" said La Valliere, with a marked\ntone of voice; and her eyes, so timorous in their expression, and\nso modestly fugitive in their glance, for a moment, ventured to look\ninquiringly into the king's.\n\n\"Still,\" returned Louis, making an effort over himself, \"it seems to me\nthat Madame has no reason, no right to be jealous of me.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" murmured La Valliere.\n\n\"Are you, too,\" said the king, almost in a tone of reproach, \"are\nyou among those who think the sister has a right to be jealous of the\nbrother?\"\n\n\"It is not for me, sire, to seek to penetrate your majesty's secrets.\"\n\n\"You _do_ believe it, then?\" exclaimed the king.\n\n\"I believe Madame is jealous, sire,\" La Valliere replied, firmly.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said the king with some anxiety, \"that you have\nperceived it, then, from her conduct towards you? Have her manners\nin any way been such towards you that you can attribute them to the\njealousy you speak of?\"\n\n\"Not at all, sire; I am of so little importance.\"\n\n\"Oh! if it were really the case--\" exclaimed Louis, violently.\n\n\"Sire,\" interrupted the young girl, \"it has ceased raining; some one is\ncoming, I think.\" And, forgetful of all etiquette, she had seized the\nking by the arm.\n\n\"Well,\" replied the king, \"let them come. Who is there who would venture\nto think I had done wrong in remaining alone with Mademoiselle de la\nValliere?\"\n\n\"For pity's sake, sire! they will think it strange to see you wet\nthrough, in this manner, and that you should have run such risk for me.\"\n\n\"I have simply done my duty as a gentleman,\" said Louis; \"and woe to him\nwho may fail in his, in criticising his sovereign's conduct.\" In fact,\nat this moment a few eager and curious faces were seen in the walk, as\nif engaged in a search. Catching glimpses at last of the king and La\nValliere, they seemed to have found what they were seeking. They were\nsome of the courtiers who had been sent by the queen and Madame, and\nuncovered themselves, in token of having perceived his majesty. But\nLouis, notwithstanding La Valliere's confusion, did not quit his\nrespectful and tender attitude. Then, when all the courtiers were\nassembled in the walk--when every one had been able to perceive the\nextraordinary mark of deference with which he had treated the young\ngirl, by remaining standing and bare-headed during the storm--he offered\nher his arm, led her towards the group who were waiting, recognized by\nan inclination of the head the respectful salutations which were paid\nhim on all sides; and, still holding his hat in his hand, he conducted\nher to her carriage. And, as a few sparse drops of rain continued\nto fall--a last adieu of the vanishing storm--the other ladies, whom\nrespect had prevented from getting into their carriages before the king,\nremained altogether unprotected by hood or cloak, exposed to the rain\nfrom which the king was protecting, as well as he was able, the humblest\namong them. The queen and Madame must, like the others, have witnessed\nthis exaggerated courtesy of the king. Madame was so disconcerted at\nit, that she touched the queen with her elbow, saying at the same time,\n\"Look there, look there.\"\n\nThe queen closed her eyes as if she had been suddenly seized with\na fainting-spell. She lifted her hands to her face and entered her\ncarriage, Madame following her. The king again mounted his horse,\nand without showing a preference for any particular carriage door, he\nreturned to Fontainebleau, the reins hanging over his horse's neck,\nabsorbed in thought. As soon as the crowd had disappeared, and the sound\nof the horses and carriages grew fainter in the distance, and when they\nwere certain, in fact, that no one could see them, Aramis and Fouquet\ncame out of their grotto, and both of them in silence passed slowly\non towards the walk. Aramis looked most narrowly not only at the whole\nextent of the open space stretching out before and behind him, but even\ninto the very depth of the wood.\n\n\"Monsieur Fouquet,\" he said, when he had quite satisfied himself that\nthey were alone, \"we must get back, at any cost, that letter you wrote\nto La Valliere.\"\n\n\"That will be easy enough,\" said Fouquet, \"if my servant has not given\nit to her.\"\n\n\"In any case it must be had, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes. The king is in love with the girl, you mean?\"\n\n\"Deeply, and what is worse is, that on her side, the girl is\npassionately attached to him.\"\n\n\"As much as to say that we must change our tactics, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it; you have no time to lose. You must see La Valliere,\nand, without thinking any more of becoming her lover, which is out of\nthe question, must declare yourself her most devoted friend and her most\nhumble servant.\"\n\n\"I will do so,\" replied Fouquet, \"and without the slightest feeling of\ndisinclination, for she seems a good-hearted girl.\"\n\n\"Or a very clever one,\" said Aramis; \"but in that case, all the greater\nreason.\" Then he added, after a moment's pause, \"If I am not mistaken,\nthat girl will become the strongest passion of the king's life. Let us\nreturn to our carriage, and, as fast as possible, to the chateau.\"\n\n\n\nChapter LXIII. Toby.\n\nTwo hours after the superintendent's carriage had set off by Aramis's\ndirections, conveying them both towards Fontainebleau with the fleetness\nof the clouds the last breath of the tempest was hurrying across the\nface of heaven, La Valliere was closeted in her own apartment, with a\nsimple muslin wrapper round her, having just finished a slight repast,\nwhich was placed upon a marble table. Suddenly the door was opened,\nand a servant entered to announce M. Fouquet, who had called to request\npermission to pay his respects to her. She made him repeat the message\ntwice over, for the poor girl only knew M. Fouquet by name, and could\nnot conceive what business she could possibly have with a superintendent\nof finances. However, as he might represent the king--and, after the\nconversation we have recorded, it was very likely--she glanced at her\nmirror, drew out still more the ringlets of her hair, and desired him\nto be admitted. La Valliere could not, however, refrain from a certain\nfeeling of uneasiness. A visit from the superintendent was not an\nordinary event in the life of any woman attached to the court. Fouquet,\nso notorious for his generosity, his gallantry, and his sensitive\ndelicacy of feeling with regard to women generally, had received\nmore invitations than he had requested audiences. In many houses, the\npresence of the superintendent had been significant of fortune; in many\nhearts, of love. Fouquet entered the apartment with a manner full of\nrespect, presenting himself with that ease and gracefulness of manner\nwhich was the distinctive characteristic of the men of eminence of that\nperiod, and which at the present day seems no longer to be understood,\neven through the interpretation of the portraits of the period, in\nwhich the painter has endeavored to recall them to being. La Valliere\nacknowledged the ceremonious salutation which Fouquet addressed to her\nby a gentle inclination of the head, and motioned him to a seat. But\nFouquet, with a bow, said, \"I will not sit down until you have pardoned\nme.\"\n\n\"I?\" asked La Valliere, \"pardon what?\"\n\nFouquet fixed a most piercing look upon the young girl, and fancied he\ncould perceive in her face nothing but the most unaffected surprise. \"I\nobserve,\" he said, \"that you have as much generosity as intelligence,\nand I read in your eyes the forgiveness I solicit. A pardon pronounced\nby your lips is insufficient for me, and I need the forgiveness of your\nheart and mind.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, monsieur,\" said La Valliere, \"I assure you most\npositively I do not understand your meaning.\"\n\n\"Again, that is a delicacy on your part which charms me,\" replied\nFouquet, \"and I see you do not wish me to blush before you.\"\n\n\"Blush! blush before _me!_ Why should you blush?\"\n\n\"Can I have deceived myself,\" said Fouquet; \"and can I have been happy\nenough not to have offended you by my conduct towards you?\"\n\n\"Really, monsieur,\" said La Valliere, shrugging her shoulders, \"you\nspeak in enigmas, and I suppose I am too ignorant to understand you.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Fouquet; \"I will not insist. Tell me, only, I entreat\nyou, that I may rely upon your full and complete forgiveness.\"\n\n\"I have but one reply to make to you, monsieur,\" said La Valliere,\nsomewhat impatiently, \"and I hope that will satisfy you. If I knew the\nwrong you have done me, I would forgive you, and I now do so with still\ngreater reason since I am ignorant of the wrong you allude to.\"\n\nFouquet bit his lips, as Aramis would have done. \"In that case,\" he\nsaid, \"I may hope, that, notwithstanding what has happened, our good\nunderstanding will remain undisturbed, and that you will kindly confer\nthe favor upon me of believing in my respectful friendship.\"\n\nLa Valliere fancied that she now began to understand, and said to\nherself, \"I should not have believed M. Fouquet so eager to seek\nthe source of a favor so very recent,\" and then added aloud, \"Your\nfriendship, monsieur! you offer me your friendship. The honor, on the\ncontrary, is mine, and I feel overpowered by it.\"\n\n\"I am aware,\" replied Fouquet, \"that the friendship of the master may\nappear more brilliant and desirable than that of the servant; but I\nassure you the latter will be quite as devoted, quite as faithful, and\naltogether disinterested.\"\n\nLa Valliere bowed, for, in fact, the voice of the superintendent seemed\nto convey both conviction and real devotion in its tone, and she held\nout her hand to him, saying, \"I believe you.\"\n\nFouquet eagerly took hold of the young girl's hand. \"You see no\ndifficulty, therefore,\" he added, \"in restoring me that unhappy letter.\"\n\n\"What letter?\" inquired La Valliere.\n\nFouquet interrogated her with his most searching gaze, as he had already\ndone before, but the same ingenious expressions, the same transparently\ncandid look met his. \"I am obliged to confess,\" he said, after this\ndenial, \"that your heart is the most delicate in the world, and I should\nnot feel I was a man of honor and uprightness if I were to suspect\nanything from a woman so generous as yourself.\"\n\n\"Really, Monsieur Fouquet,\" replied La Valliere, \"it is with profound\nregret I am obliged to repeat that I absolutely understand nothing of\nwhat you refer to.\"\n\n\"In fact, then, upon your honor, mademoiselle, you have not received any\nletter from me?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, none,\" replied La Valliere, firmly.\n\n\"Very well, that is quite sufficient; permit me, then, to renew the\nassurance of my utmost esteem and respect,\" said Fouquet. Then, bowing,\nhe left the room to seek Aramis, who was waiting for him in his\nown apartment, and leaving La Valliere to ask herself whether the\nsuperintendent had not lost his senses.\n\n\"Well!\" inquired Aramis, who was impatiently waiting Fouquet's return,\n\"are you satisfied with the favorite?\"\n\n\"Enchanted,\" replied Fouquet; \"she is a woman full of intelligence and\nfine feeling.\"\n\n\"She did not get angry, then?\"\n\n\"Far from that--she did not even seem to understand.\"\n\n\"To understand what?\"\n\n\"To understand that I had written to her.\"\n\n\"She must, however, have understood you sufficiently to give the letter\nback to you, for I presume she returned it.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"At least, you satisfied yourself that she had burnt it.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur d'Herblay, I have been playing at cross-purposes for\nmore than an hour, and, however amusing it may be, I begin to have had\nenough of this game. So understand me thoroughly: the girl pretended not\nto understand what I was saying to her; she denied having received any\nletter; therefore, having positively denied its receipt, she was unable\neither to return or burn it.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Aramis, with uneasiness, \"what is this you tell me?\"\n\n\"I say that she swore most positively she had not received any letter.\"\n\n\"That is too much. And did you not insist?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I did insist, almost impertinently even.\"\n\n\"And she persisted in her denial?\"\n\n\"Unhesitatingly.\"\n\n\"And did she not contradict herself?\"\n\n\"Not once.\"\n\n\"But, in that case, then, you have left our letter in her hands?\"\n\n\"How could I do otherwise?\"\n\n\"Oh! it was a great mistake.\"\n\n\"What the deuce would you have done in my place?\"\n\n\"One could not force her, certainly, but it is very embarrassing; such a\nletter ought not to remain in existence against us.\"\n\n\"Oh! the young girl's disposition is generosity itself; I looked at her\neyes, and I can read eyes well.\"\n\n\"You think she can be relied upon?\"\n\n\"From my heart I do.\"\n\n\"Well, I think we are mistaken.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I think that, in point of fact, as she herself told you, she did not\nreceive the letter.\"\n\n\"What! do you suppose--\"\n\n\"I suppose that, from some motive, of which we know nothing, your man\ndid not deliver the letter to her.\"\n\nFouquet rang the bell. A servant appeared. \"Send Toby here,\" he said. A\nmoment afterwards a man made his appearance, with an anxious, restless\nlook, shrewd expression of the mouth, with short arms, and his back\nsomewhat bent. Aramis fixed a penetrating look upon him.\n\n\"Will you allow me to interrogate him myself?\" inquired Aramis.\n\n\"Do so,\" said Fouquet.\n\nAramis was about to say something to the lackey, when he paused. \"No,\"\nhe said; \"he would see that we attach too much importance to his answer;\ntherefore question him yourself; I will pretend to be writing.\" Aramis\naccordingly placed himself at a table, his back turned towards the old\nattendant, whose every gesture and look he watched in a looking-glass\nopposite to him.\n\n\"Come here, Toby,\" said Fouquet to the valet, who approached with a\ntolerably firm step. \"How did you execute my commission?\" inquired\nFouquet.\n\n\"In the usual way, monseigneur,\" replied the man.\n\n\"But how, tell me?\"\n\n\"I succeeded in penetrating as far as Mademoiselle de la Valliere's\napartment; but she was at mass, and so I placed the note on her\ntoilette-table. Is not that what you told me to do?\"\n\n\"Precisely; and is that all?\"\n\n\"Absolutely all, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"No one was there?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"Did you conceal yourself as I told you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And she returned?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes afterwards.\"\n\n\"And no one could have taken the letter?\"\n\n\"No one; for no one had entered the room.\"\n\n\"From the outside, but from the interior?\"\n\n\"From the place where I was secreted, I could see to the very end of the\nroom.\"\n\n\"Now listen to me,\" said Fouquet, looking fixedly at the lackey; \"if\nthis letter did not reach its proper destination, confess it; for, if a\nmistake has been made, your head shall be the forfeit.\"\n\nToby started, but immediately recovered himself. \"Monseigneur,\" he said,\n\"I placed the letter on the very place I told you: and I ask only\nhalf an hour to prove to you that the letter is in Mademoiselle de la\nValliere's hand, or to bring you back the letter itself.\"\n\nAramis looked at the valet scrutinizingly. Fouquet was ready in placing\nconfidence in people, and for twenty years this man had served him\nfaithfully. \"Go,\" he said; \"but bring me the proof you speak of.\" The\nlackey quitted the room.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it?\" inquired Fouquet of Aramis.\n\n\"I think that you must, by some means or another, assure yourself of\nthe truth, either that the letter has, or has not, reached La Valliere;\nthat, in the first case, La Valliere must return it to you, or satisfy\nyou by burning it in your presence; that, in the second, you must have\nthe letter back again, even were it to cost you a million. Come, is not\nthat your opinion?\"\n\n\"Yes; but still, my dear bishop, I believe you are exaggerating the\nimportance of the affair.\"\n\n\"Blind, how blind you are!\" murmured Aramis.\n\n\"La Valliere,\" returned Fouquet, \"whom we assume to be a schemer of the\nfirst ability, is simply nothing more than a coquette, who hopes that I\nshall pay my court to her, because I have already done so, and who, now\nthat she has received a confirmation of the king's regard, hopes to keep\nme in leading strings with the letter. It is natural enough.\"\n\nAramis shook his head.\n\n\"Is not that your opinion?\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"She is not a coquette,\" he replied.\n\n\"Allow me to tell you--\"\n\n\"Oh! I am well enough acquainted with women who are coquettes,\" said\nAramis.\n\n\"My dear friend!\"\n\n\"It is a long time ago since I finished my education, you mean. But\nwomen are the same, throughout the centuries.\"\n\n\"True; but men change, and you at the present day are far more\nsuspicious than you formerly were.\" And then, beginning to laugh, he\nadded, \"Come, if La Valliere is willing to love me only to the extent\nof a third, and the king two-thirds, do you think the condition\nacceptable?\"\n\nAramis rose impatiently. \"La Valliere,\" he said, \"has never loved, and\nnever will love, any one but the king.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Fouquet, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Ask me rather what I would have done?\"\n\n\"Well! what would you have done?\"\n\n\"In the first place, I should not have allowed that man to depart.\"\n\n\"Toby?\"\n\n\"Yes; Toby is a traitor. Nay, I am sure of it, and I would not have let\nhim go until he had told me the truth.\"\n\n\"There is still time. I will recall him, and do you question him in your\nturn.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"But I assure you it is useless. He has been with me for twenty years,\nand has never made the slightest mistake, and yet,\" added Fouquet,\nlaughing, \"it would have been easy enough for him to have done so.\"\n\n\"Still, call him back. This morning I fancy I saw that face, in earnest\nconversation with one of M. Colbert's men.\"\n\n\"Where was that?\"\n\n\"Opposite the stables.\"\n\n\"Bah! all my people are at daggers drawn with that fellow.\"\n\n\"I saw him, I tell you, and his face, which should have been unknown to\nme when he entered just now, struck me as disagreeably familiar.\"\n\n\"Why did you not say something, then, while he was here?\"\n\n\"Because it is only at this very minute that my memory is clear upon the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Fouquet, \"you alarm me.\" And he again rang the bell.\n\n\"Provided that it is not already too late,\" said Aramis.\n\nFouquet once more rang impatiently. The valet usually in attendance\nappeared. \"Toby!\" said Fouquet, \"send Toby.\" The valet again shut the\ndoor.\n\n\"You leave me at perfect liberty, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Entirely so.\"\n\n\"I may employ all means, then, to ascertain the truth.\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Intimidation, even?\"\n\n\"I constitute you public prosecutor in my place.\"\n\nThey waited ten minutes longer, but uselessly, and Fouquet, thoroughly\nout of patience, again rang loudly.\n\n\"Toby!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said the valet, \"they are looking for him.\"\n\n\"He cannot be far distant, I have not given him any commission to\nexecute.\"\n\n\"I will go and see, monseigneur,\" replied the valet, as he closed the\ndoor. Aramis, during the interview, walked impatiently, but without a\nsyllable, up and down the cabinet. They waited a further ten minutes.\nFouquet rang in a manner to alarm the very dead. The valet again\npresented himself, trembling in a way to induce a belief that he was the\nbearer of bad news.\n\n\"Monseigneur is mistaken,\" he said, before even Fouquet could\ninterrogate him, \"you must have given Toby some commission, for he\nhas been to the stables and taken your lordship's swiftest horse, and\nsaddled it himself.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And he has gone off.\"\n\n\"Gone!\" exclaimed Fouquet. \"Let him be pursued, let him be captured.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" whispered Aramis, taking him by the hand, \"be calm, the evil\nis done.\"\n\nThe valet quietly went out.\n\n\"The evil is done, you say?\"\n\n\"No doubt; I was sure of it. And now, let us give no cause for\nsuspicion; we must calculate the result of the blow, and ward it off, if\npossible.\"\n\n\"After all,\" said Fouquet, \"the evil is not great.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" said Aramis.\n\n\"Of course. Surely a man is allowed to write a love-letter to a woman.\"\n\n\"A man, certainly; a subject, no; especially, too, when the woman in\nquestion is one with whom the king is in love.\"\n\n\"But the king was not in love with La Valliere a week ago! he was not in\nlove with her yesterday, and the letter is dated yesterday; I could not\nguess the king was in love, when the king's affection was not even yet\nin existence.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" replied Aramis; \"but unfortunately the letter is not\ndated, and it is that circumstance particularly which annoys me. If it\nhad only been dated yesterday, I should not have the slightest shadow of\nuneasiness on your account.\"\n\nFouquet shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Am I not my own master,\" he said, \"and is the king, then, king of my\nbrain and of my flesh?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Aramis, \"do not let us attach greater\nimportance to matters than is necessary; and besides... Well! if we are\nmenaced, we have means of defense.\"\n\n\"Oh! menaced!\" said Fouquet, \"you do not place this gnat bite, as it\nwere, among the number of menaces which may compromise my fortune and my\nlife, do you?\"\n\n\"Do not forget, Monsieur Fouquet, that the bit of an insect can kill a\ngiant, if the insect be venomous.\"\n\n\"But has this sovereign power you were speaking of, already vanished?\"\n\n\"I am all-powerful, it is true, but I am not immortal.\"\n\n\"Come, then, the most pressing matter is to find Toby again, I suppose.\nIs not that your opinion?\"\n\n\"Oh! as for that, you will not find him again,\" said Aramis, \"and if he\nwere of any great value to you, you must give him up for lost.\"\n\n\"At all events he is somewhere or another in the world,\" said Fouquet.\n\n\"You're right, let me act,\" replied Aramis.\n\n\n\nChapter LXIV. Madame's Four Chances.\n\nAnne of Austria had begged the young queen to pay her a visit. For some\ntime past suffering most acutely, and losing both her youth and beauty\nwith that rapidity which signalizes the decline of women for whom life\nhas been one long contest, Anne of Austria had, in addition to her\nphysical sufferings, to experience the bitterness of being no longer\nheld in any esteem, except as a surviving remembrance of the past,\namidst the youthful beauties, wits, and influential forces of her court.\nHer physician's opinions, her mirror also, grieved her far less than the\ninexorable warnings which the society of the courtiers afforded, who,\nlike rats in a ship, abandon the hold into which on the very next voyage\nthe water will infallibly penetrate, owing to the ravages of decay. Anne\nof Austria did not feel satisfied with the time her eldest son devoted\nto her. The king, a good son, more from affectation than from affection,\nhad at first been in the habit of passing an hour in the morning and one\nin the evening with his mother; but, since he had himself undertaken\nthe conduct of state affairs, the duration of the morning and evening's\nvisit had been reduced by one half; and then, by degrees, the morning\nvisit had been suppressed altogether. They met at mass; the evening\nvisit was replaced by a meeting, either at the king's assembly or at\nMadame's, which the queen attended obligingly enough, out of regard to\nher two sons.\n\nThe result of this was, that Madame gradually acquired an immense\ninfluence over the court, which made her apartments the true royal place\nof meeting. This, Anne of Austria perceived; knowing herself to be very\nill, and condemned by her sufferings to frequent retirement, she was\ndistressed at the idea that the greater part of her future days and\nevenings would pass away solitary, useless, and in despondency. She\nrecalled with terror the isolation in which Cardinal Richelieu had\nformerly left her, those dreaded and insupportable evenings, during\nwhich, however, she had both youth and beauty, which are ever\naccompanied by hope, to console her. She next formed the project of\ntransporting the court to her own apartments, and of attracting Madame,\nwith her brilliant escort, to her gloomy and already sorrowful abode,\nwhere the widow of a king of France, and the mother of a king of France,\nwas reduced to console, in her artificial widowhood, the weeping wife of\na king of France.\n\nAnne began to reflect. She had intrigued a good deal in her life. In\nthe good times past, when her youthful mind nursed projects that were,\nultimately, invariably successful, she had by her side, to stimulate\nher ambition and her love, a friend of her own sex, more eager, more\nambitious than herself,--a friend who had loved her, a rare circumstance\nat courts, and whom some petty considerations had removed from her\nforever. But for many years past--except Madame de Motteville, and La\nMolena, her Spanish nurse, a confidante in her character of countrywoman\nand woman too--who could boast of having given good advice to the queen?\nWho, too, among all the youthful heads there, could recall the past for\nher,--that past in which alone she lived? Anne of Austria remembered\nMadame de Chevreuse, in the first place exiled rather by her wish than\nthe king's, and then dying in exile, the wife of a gentleman of obscure\nbirth and position. She asked herself what Madame de Chevreuse would\nhave advised her to do in similar circumstances, in their mutual\ndifficulties arising from their intrigues; and after serious reflection,\nit seemed as if the clever, subtle mind of her friend, full of\nexperience and sound judgment, answered her in the well-remembered\nironical tones: \"All the insignificant young people are poor and greedy\nof gain. They require gold and incomes to supply means of amusement;\nit is by interest you must gain them over.\" And Anne of Austria adopted\nthis plan. Her purse was well filled, and she had at her disposal a\nconsiderable sum of money, which had been amassed by Mazarin for her,\nand lodged in a place of safety. She possessed the most magnificent\njewels in France, and especially pearls of a size so large that they\nmade the king sigh every time he saw them, because the pearls of his\ncrown were like millet seed compared to them. Anne of Austria had\nneither beauty nor charms any longer at her disposal. She gave out,\ntherefore, that her wealth was great, and as an inducement for others\nto visit her apartments she let it be known that there were good gold\ncrowns to be won at play, or that handsome presents were likely to be\nmade on days when all went well with her; or windfalls, in the shape of\nannuities which she had wrung from the king by entreaty, and thus she\ndetermined to maintain her credit. In the first place, she tried these\nmeans upon Madame; because to gain her consent was of more importance\nthan anything else. Madame, notwithstanding the bold confidence which\nher wit and beauty inspired her, blindly ran head foremost into the net\nthus stretched out to catch her. Enriched by degrees by these presents\nand transfers of property, she took a fancy to inheritances by\nanticipation. Anne of Austria adopted the same means towards Monsieur,\nand even towards the king himself. She instituted lotteries in her\napartments. The day on which the present chapter opens, invitations had\nbeen issued for a late supper in the queen-mother's apartments, as she\nintended that two beautiful diamond bracelets of exquisite workmanship\nshould be put into a lottery. The medallions were antique cameos of\nthe greatest value; the diamonds, in point of intrinsic value, did not\nrepresent a very considerable amount, but the originality and rarity of\nthe workmanship were such, that every one at court not only wished to\npossess the bracelets, but even to see the queen herself wear them; for,\non the days she wore them, it was considered as a favor to be admitted\nto admire them in kissing her hands. The courtiers had, even with regard\nto this subject, adopted various expressions of gallantry to establish\nthe aphorism, that the bracelets would have been priceless in value if\nthey had not been unfortunate enough to be placed in contact with arms\nas beautiful as the queen's. This compliment had been honored by a\ntranslation into all the languages of Europe, and numerous verses in\nLatin and French had been circulated on the subject. The day that Anne\nof Austria had selected for the lottery was a decisive moment; the king\nhad not been near his mother for a couple of days; Madame, after the\ngreat scene of the Dryads and Naiads, was sulking by herself. It\nis true, the king's fit of resentment was over, but his mind was\nabsorbingly occupied by a circumstance that raised him above the stormy\ndisputes and giddy pleasures of the court.\n\nAnne of Austria effected a diversion by the announcement of the famous\nlottery to take place in her apartments on the following evening. With\nthis object in view, she saw the young queen, whom, as we have already\nseen, she had invited to pay her a visit in the morning. \"I have good\nnews to tell you,\" she said to her; \"the king has been saying the most\ntender things about you. He is young, you know, and easily drawn away;\nbut so long as you keep near me, he will not venture to keep away from\nyou, to whom, besides, he is most warmly and affectionately attached. I\nintend to have a lottery this evening and shall expect to see you.\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" said the young queen, with a sort of timid reproach,\n\"that your majesty intends to put in the lottery those lovely bracelets\nwhose rarity is so great that we ought not to allow them to pass out of\nthe custody of the crown, even were there no other reason than that they\nhad once belonged to you.\"\n\n\"My daughter,\" said Anne of Austria, who read the young queen's\nthoughts, and wished to console her for not having received the\nbracelets as a present, \"it is positively necessary that I should induce\nMadame to pass her time in my apartments.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" said the young queen, blushing.\n\n\"Of course: would you not prefer to have a rival near you, whom you\ncould watch and influence, to knowing the king is with her, always as\nready to flirt as to be flirted with by her? The lottery I have proposed\nis my means of attraction for that purpose; do you blame me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" returned Maria Theresa, clapping her hands with a childlike\nexpression of delight.\n\n\"And you no longer regret, then, that I did not give you these\nbracelets, as I at first intended to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\"\n\n\"Very well; make yourself look as beautiful as possible that our supper\nmay be very brilliant; the gayer you seem, the more charming you appear,\nand you will eclipse all the ladies present as much by your brilliancy\nas by your rank.\"\n\nMaria Theresa left full of delight. An hour afterwards, Anne of Austria\nreceived a visit from Madame, whom she covered with caresses, saying,\n\"Excellent news! the king is charmed with my lottery.\"\n\n\"But I,\" replied Madame, \"am not so greatly charmed: to see such\nbeautiful bracelets on any one's arms but yours or mine, is what I\ncannot reconcile myself to.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Anne of Austria, concealing by a smile a violent\npang she had just experienced, \"do not look at things in the worst light\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Ah, Madame, Fortune is blind, and I am told there are two hundred\ntickets.\"\n\n\"Quite as many as that; but you cannot surely forget that there can only\nbe one winner.\"\n\n\"No doubt. But who will that be? Can you tell?\" said Madame, in despair.\n\n\"You remind me that I had a dream last night; my dreams are always\ngood,--I sleep so little.\"\n\n\"What was your dream?--but are you suffering?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the queen, stifling with wonderful command the torture of a\nrenewed attack of shooting pains in her bosom; \"I dreamed that the king\nwon the bracelets.\"\n\n\"The king!\"\n\n\"You are going to ask me, I think, what the king could possibly do with\nthe bracelets?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you would not add, perhaps, that it would be very fortunate if the\nking were really to win, for he would be obliged to give the bracelets\nto some one else.\"\n\n\"To restore them to you, for instance.\"\n\n\"In which case I should immediately give them away; for you do not\nthink, I suppose,\" said the queen, laughing, \"that I have put these\nbracelets up to a lottery from necessity. My object was to give them\nwithout arousing any one's jealousy; but if Fortune will not get me out\nof my difficulty--well, I will teach Fortune a lesson--and I know\nvery well to whom I intend to offer the bracelets.\" These words were\naccompanied by so expressive a smile, that Madame could not resist\npaying her by a grateful kiss.\n\n\"But,\" added Anne of Austria, \"do you not know, as well as I do, that if\nthe king were to win the bracelets, he would not restore them to me?\"\n\n\"You mean he would give them to the queen?\"\n\n\"No; and for the very same reason that he would not give them back again\nto me; since, if I had wished to make the queen a present of them, I had\nno need of him for that purpose.\"\n\nMadame cast a side glance upon the bracelets, which, in their casket,\nwere dazzlingly exposed to view upon a table close beside her.\n\n\"How beautiful they are,\" she said, sighing. \"But stay,\" Madame\ncontinued, \"we are quite forgetting that your majesty's dream was\nnothing but a dream.\"\n\n\"I should be very much surprised,\" returned Anne of Austria, \"if my\ndream were to deceive me; that has happened to me very seldom.\"\n\n\"We may look upon you as a prophetess, then.\"\n\n\"I have already said, that I dream but very rarely; but the coincidence\nof my dream about this matter, with my own ideas, is extraordinary! it\nagrees so wonderfully with my own views and arrangements.\"\n\n\"What arrangements do you allude to?\"\n\n\"That you will get the bracelets, for instance.\"\n\n\"In that case, it will not be the king.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Anne of Austria, \"there is not such a very great distance\nbetween his majesty's heart and your own; for, are you not his sister,\nfor whom he has a great regard? There is not, I repeat, so very wide a\ndistance, that my dream can be pronounced false on that account. Come,\nlet us reckon up the chances in its favor.\"\n\n\"I will count them.\"\n\n\"In the first place, we will begin with the dream. If the king wins, he\nis sure to give you the bracelets.\"\n\n\"I admit that is one.\"\n\n\"If you win them, they are yours.\"\n\n\"Naturally; that may be admitted also.\"\n\n\"Lastly;--if Monsieur were to win them!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Madame, laughing heartily, \"he would give them to the\nChevalier de Lorraine.\"\n\nAnne of Austria laughed as heartily as her daughter-in-law; so much so,\nindeed, that her sufferings again returned, and made her turn suddenly\npale in the very midst of her enjoyment.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired Madame, terrified.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing; a pain in my side. I have been laughing too much. We\nwere at the fourth chance, I think.\"\n\n\"I cannot see a fourth.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; I am not excluded from the chance of winning, and if\nI be the winner, you are sure of me.\"\n\n\"Oh! thank you, thank you!\" exclaimed Madame.\n\n\"I hope that you look upon yourself as one whose chances are good, and\nthat my dream now begins to assure the solid outlines of reality.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed: you give me both hope and confidence,\" said Madame, \"and\nthe bracelets, won in this manner, will be a hundred times more precious\nto me.\"\n\n\"Well! then, good-bye, until this evening.\" And the two princesses\nseparated. Anne of Austria, after her daughter-in-law had left her, said\nto herself, as she examined the bracelets, \"They are, indeed, precious;\nsince, by their means, this evening, I shall have won over a heart to my\nside, at the same time, fathomed an important secret.\"\n\nThen turning towards the deserted recess in her room, she said,\naddressing vacancy,--\"Is it not thus that you would have acted, my poor\nChevreuse? Yes, yes; I know it is.\"\n\nAnd, like a perfume of other, fairer days, her youth, her imagination,\nand her happiness seemed to be wafted towards the echo of this\ninvocation.\n\n\n\nChapter LXV. The Lottery.\n\nBy eight o'clock in the evening, every one had assembled in the\nqueen-mother's apartments. Anne of Austria, in full dress, beautiful\nstill, from former loveliness, and from all the resources coquetry\ncan command at the hands of clever assistants, concealed, or rather\npretended to conceal, from the crowd of courtiers who surrounded her,\nand who still admired her, thanks to the combination of circumstances\nwhich we have indicated in the preceding chapter, the ravages, which\nwere already visible, of the acute suffering to which she finally\nyielded a few years later. Madame, almost as great a coquette as Anne of\nAustria, and the queen, simple and natural as usual, were seated beside\nher, each contending for her good graces. The ladies of honor, united\nin a body, in order to resist with greater effect, and consequently with\nmore success, the witty and lively conversations which the young men\nheld about them, were enabled, like a battalion formed in a square,\nto offer each other the means of attack and defense which were thus\nat their command. Montalais, learned in that species of warfare which\nconsists of sustained skirmishing, protected the whole line by a sort\nof rolling fire she directed against the enemy. Saint-Aignan, in utter\ndespair at the rigor, which became almost insulting from the very fact\nof her persisting in it, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente displayed,\ntried to turn his back upon her; but, overcome by the irresistible\nbrilliancy of her eyes, he, every moment, returned to consecrate his\ndefeat by new submissions, to which Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente did\nnot fail to reply by fresh acts of impertinence. Saint-Aignan did not\nknow which way to turn. La Valliere had about her, not exactly a court,\nbut sprinklings of courtiers. Saint-Aignan, hoping by this maneuver to\nattract Athenais's attention towards him, approached the young girl, and\nsaluted her with a respect that induced some to believe that he wished\nto balance Athenais by Louise. But these were persons who had neither\nbeen witnesses of the scene during the shower, nor had heard it spoken\nof. As the majority was already informed, and well informed, too, on the\nmatter, the acknowledged favor with which she was regarded had attracted\nto her side some of the most astute, as well as the least sensible,\nmembers of the court. The former, because they said with Montaigne,\n\"How do I know?\" and the latter, who said with Rabelais, \"Perhaps.\"\nThe greatest number had followed in the wake of the latter, just as in\nhunting five or six of the best hounds alone follow the scent of the\nanimal hunted, whilst the remainder of the pack follow only the scent of\nthe hounds. The two queens and Madame examined with particular attention\nthe toilettes of their ladies and maids of honor; and they condescended\nto forget they were queens in recollecting that they were women. In\nother words, they pitilessly picked to pieces every person present who\nwore a petticoat. The looks of both princesses simultaneously fell upon\nLa Valliere, who, as we have just said, was completely surrounded\nat that moment. Madame knew not what pity was, and said to the\nqueen-mother, as she turned towards her, \"If Fortune were just, she\nwould favor that poor La Valliere.\"\n\n\"That is not possible,\" said the queen-mother, smiling.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"There are only two hundred tickets, so that it was not possible to\ninscribe every one's name on the list.\"\n\n\"And hers is not there, then?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"What a pity! she might have won them, and then sold them.\"\n\n\"Sold them!\" exclaimed the queen.\n\n\"Yes; it would have been a dowry for her, and she would not have been\nobliged to marry without her _trousseau_, as will probably be the case.\"\n\n\"Really,\" answered the queen-mother, \"poor little thing: has she no\ndresses, then?\"\n\nAnd she pronounced these words like a woman who has never been able to\nunderstand the inconveniences of a slenderly filled purse.\n\n\"Stay, look at her. Heaven forgive me, if she is not wearing the very\nsame petticoat this evening that she had on this morning during the\npromenade, and which she managed to keep clean, thanks to the care the\nking took of her, in sheltering her from the rain.\"\n\nAt the very moment Madame uttered these words the king entered the\nroom. The two queens would not perhaps have observed his arrival, so\ncompletely were they occupied in their ill-natured remarks, had not\nMadame noticed that, all at once, La Valliere, who was standing up\nfacing the gallery, exhibited certain signs of confusion, and then\nsaid a few words to the courtiers who surrounded her, who immediately\ndispersed. This movement induced Madame to look towards the door, and\nat that moment, the captain of the guards announced the king. At this\nmoment La Valliere, who had hitherto kept her eyes fixed upon the\ngallery, suddenly cast them down as the king entered. His majesty was\ndressed magnificently and in the most perfect taste; he was conversing\nwith Monsieur and the Duc de Roquelaure, Monsieur on his right, and the\nDuc de Roquelaure on his left. The king advanced, in the first place,\ntowards the queens, to whom he bowed with an air full of graceful\nrespect. He took his mother's hand and kissed it, addressed a few\ncompliments to Madame upon the beauty of her toilette, and then began\nto make the round of the assembly. La Valliere was saluted in the same\nmanner as the others, but with neither more nor less attention. His\nmajesty then returned to his mother and his wife. When the courtiers\nnoticed that the king had only addressed some ordinary remark to the\nyoung girl who had been so particularly noticed in the morning, they\nimmediately drew their own conclusion to account for this coldness of\nmanner; this conclusion being, that although the king may have taken\na sudden fancy to her, that fancy had already disappeared. One thing,\nhowever, must be remarked, that close beside La Valliere, among the\nnumber of the courtiers, M. Fouquet was to be seen; and his respectfully\nattentive manner served to sustain the young girl in the midst of the\nvaried emotions that visibly agitated her.\n\nM. Fouquet was just on the point, moreover, of speaking in a more\nfriendly manner with Mademoiselle de la Valliere, when M. Colbert\napproached, and after having bowed to Fouquet with all the formality of\nrespectful politeness, he seemed to take up a post beside La Valliere,\nfor the purpose of entering into conversation with her. Fouquet\nimmediately quitted his place. These proceedings were eagerly devoured\nby the eyes of Montalais and Malicorne, who mutually exchanged their\nobservations on the subject. De Guiche, standing within the embrasure of\none of the windows, saw no one but Madame. But as Madame, on her side,\nfrequently glanced at La Valliere, De Guiche's eyes, following\nMadame's, were from time to time cast upon the young girl. La Valliere\ninstinctively felt herself sinking beneath the weight of all these\ndifferent looks, inspired, some by interest, others by envy. She had\nnothing to compensate her for her sufferings, not a kind word from her\ncompanions, nor a look of affection from the king. No one could possibly\nexpress the misery the poor girl was suffering. The queen-mother\nnext directed the small table to be brought forward, on which the\nlottery-tickets were placed, two hundred in number, and begged Madame de\nMotteville to read the list of the names. It was a matter of course\nthat this list had been drawn out in strict accordance with the laws of\netiquette. The king's name was first on the list, next the queen-mother,\nthen the queen, Monsieur, Madame, and so on. All hearts throbbed\nanxiously as the list was read out; more than three hundred persons had\nbeen invited, and each of them was anxious to learn whether his or\nher name was to be found in the number of privileged names. The king\nlistened with as much attention as the others, and when the last name\nhad been pronounced, he noticed that La Valliere had been omitted from\nthe list. Every one, of course, remarked this omission. The king flushed\nas if much annoyed; but La Valliere, gentle and resigned, as usual,\nexhibited nothing of the sort. While the list was being read, the king\nhad not taken his eyes off the young girl, who seemed to expand, as it\nwere, beneath the happy influence she felt was shed around her, and who\nwas delighted and too pure in spirit for any other thought than that of\nlove to find an entrance either to her mind or her heart. Acknowledging\nthis touching self-denial by the fixity of his attention, the king\nshowed La Valliere how much he appreciated its delicacy. When the list\nwas finished, the different faces of those who had been omitted or\nforgotten fully expressed their disappointment. Malicorne was also\nleft out from amongst the men; and the grimace he made plainly said\nto Montalais, who was also forgotten, \"Cannot we contrive to arrange\nmatters with Fortune in such a manner that she shall not forget us?\"\nto which a smile full of intelligence from Mademoiselle Aure, replied:\n\"Certainly we can.\"\n\nThe tickets were distributed to each according to the number listed. The\nking received his first, next the queen-mother, then Monsieur, then the\nqueen and Madame, and so on. After this, Anne of Austria opened a small\nSpanish leather bag, containing two hundred numbers engraved upon small\nballs of mother-of-pearl, and presented the open sack to the youngest\nof her maids of honor, for the purpose of taking one of the balls out of\nit. The eager expectation of the throng, amidst all the tediously slow\npreparations, was rather that of cupidity than curiosity. Saint-Aignan\nbent towards Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente to whisper to her, \"Since\nwe have each a number, let us unite our two chances. The bracelet shall\nbe yours if I win, and if you are successful, deign to give me but one\nlook of your beautiful eyes.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Athenais, \"if you win the bracelet, keep it, every one for\nhimself.\"\n\n\"You are without any pity,\" said Saint-Aignan, \"and I will punish you by\na quatrain:--\n\n\"Beautiful Iris, to my vows You are too opposed--\"\n\n\"Silence,\" said Athenais, \"you will prevent me hearing the winning\nnumber.\"\n\n\"Number one,\" said the young girl who had drawn the mother-of-pearl from\nthe Spanish leather bag.\n\n\"The king!\" exclaimed the queen-mother.\n\n\"The king has won,\" repeated the queen, delightedly.\n\n\"Oh! the king! your dream!\" said Madame, joyously, in the ear of Anne of\nAustria.\n\nThe king was the only one who did not exhibit any satisfaction. He\nmerely thanked Fortune for what she had done for him, in addressing a\nslight salutation to the young girl who had been chosen as her proxy.\nThen receiving from the hands of Anne of Austria, amid the eager desire\nof the whole assembly, the casket inclosing the bracelets, he said, \"Are\nthese bracelets really beautiful, then?\"\n\n\"Look at them,\" said Anne of Austria, \"and judge for yourself.\"\n\nThe king looked at them, and said, \"Yes, indeed, an admirable medallion.\nWhat perfect finish!\"\n\nQueen Maria Theresa easily saw, and that, too at the very first glance,\nthat the king would not offer the bracelets to her; but, as he did not\nseem the least degree in the world disposed to offer them to Madame,\nshe felt almost satisfied, or nearly so. The king sat down. The most\nintimate among the courtiers approached, one by one, for the purpose of\nadmiring more closely the beautiful piece of workmanship, which soon,\nwith the king's permission, was handed about from person to person.\nImmediately, every one, connoisseurs or not, uttered various\nexclamations of surprise, and overwhelmed the king with congratulations.\nThere was, in fact, something for everybody to admire--the brilliance\nfor some, and the cutting for others. The ladies present visibly\ndisplayed their impatience to see such a treasure monopolized by the\ngentlemen.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" said the king, whom nothing escaped, \"one would\nalmost think that you wore bracelets as the Sabines used to do; hand\nthem round for a while for the inspection of the ladies, who seem to\nhave, and with far greater right, an excuse for understanding such\nmatters!\"\n\nThese words appeared to Madame the commencement of a decision she\nexpected. She gathered, besides, this happy belief from the glances of\nthe queen-mother. The courtier who held them at the moment the king\nmade this remark, amidst the general agitation, hastened to place the\nbracelets in the hands of the queen, Maria Theresa, who, knowing too\nwell, poor woman, that they were not designed for her, hardly looked at\nthem, and almost immediately passed them on to Madame. The latter, and\neven more minutely, Monsieur, gave the bracelets a long look of anxious\nand almost covetous desire. She then handed the jewels to those ladies\nwho were near her, pronouncing this single word, but with an accent\nwhich was worth a long phrase, \"Magnificent!\"\n\nThe ladies who had received the bracelets from Madame's hands looked at\nthem as long as they chose to examine them, and then made them circulate\nby passing them on towards the right. During this time the king was\ntranquilly conversing with De Guiche and Fouquet, rather passively\nletting them talk than himself listening. Accustomed to the set form\nof ordinary phrases, his ear, like that of all men who exercise\nan incontestable superiority over others, merely selected from the\nconversations held in various directions the indispensable word which\nrequires reply. His attention, however, was now elsewhere, for it\nwandered as his eyes did.\n\nMademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente was the last of the ladies inscribed for\ntickets; and, as if she had ranked according to her name upon the list,\nshe had only Montalais and La Valliere near her. When the bracelets\nreached these two latter, no one appeared to take any further notice of\nthem. The humble hands which for a moment touched these jewels, deprived\nthem, for the time, of their importance--a circumstance which did not,\nhowever, prevent Montalais from starting with joy, envy, and covetous\ndesire, at the sight of the beautiful stones still more than at their\nmagnificent workmanship. It is evident that if she were compelled to\ndecide between the pecuniary value and the artistic beauty, Montalais\nwould unhesitatingly have preferred diamonds to cameos, and her\ndisinclination, therefore, to pass them on to her companion,\nLa Valliere, was very great. La Valliere fixed a look almost of\nindifference upon the jewels.\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful, how magnificent these bracelets are!\" exclaimed\nMontalais; \"and yet you do not go into ecstasies about them, Louise! You\nare no true woman, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, indeed,\" replied the young girl, with an accent of the\nmost charming melancholy; \"but why desire that which can never, by any\npossibility, be ours?\"\n\nThe king, his head bent forward, was listening to what Louise was\nsaying. Hardly had the vibration of her voice reached his ear than he\nrose, radiant with delight, and passing across the whole assembly,\nfrom the place where he stood, to La Valliere, \"You are mistaken,\nmademoiselle,\" he said, \"you are a woman, and every woman has a right to\nwear jewels, which are a woman's appurtenance.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire!\" said La Valliere, \"your majesty will not absolutely believe\nin my modesty?\"\n\n\"I believe you possess every virtue, mademoiselle; frankness as well as\nevery other; I entreat you, therefore, to say frankly what you think of\nthese bracelets?\"\n\n\"That they are beautiful, sire, and cannot be offered to any other than\na queen.\"\n\n\"I am delighted that such is your opinion, mademoiselle; the bracelets\nare yours, and the king begs your acceptance of them.\"\n\nAnd as, with a movement almost resembling terror, La Valliere eagerly\nheld out the casket to the king, the king gently pushed back her\ntrembling hand.\n\nA silence of astonishment, more profound than that of death, reigned in\nthe assembly.\n\nAnd yet, from the side where the queens were, no one had heard what he\nhad said, nor understood what he had done. A charitable friend, however,\ntook upon herself to spread the news; it was Tonnay-Charente, to whom\nMadame had made a sign to approach.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" explained Tonnay-Charente, \"how happy that La Valliere\nis! the king has just given her the bracelets.\"\n\nMadame bit her lips to such a degree that the blood appeared upon the\nsurface of the skin. The young queen looked first at La Valliere and\nthen at Madame, and began to laugh. Anne of Austria rested her chin upon\nher beautiful white hand, and remained for a long time absorbed by a\npresentiment that disturbed her mind, and by a terrible pang which stung\nher heart. De Guiche, observing Madame turn pale, and guessing the cause\nof her change of color, abruptly quitted the assembly and disappeared.\nMalicorne was then able to approach Montalais very quietly, and under\ncover of the general din of conversation, said to her:\n\n\"Aure, your fortune and our future are standing at your elbow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was her reply, as she tenderly embraced La Valliere, whom,\ninwardly, she was tempted to strangle.\n\n\nEnd of Ten Years Later. The next text in the series is Louise de la\nValliere.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[Footnote 1: In the three-volume edition, Volume 1, entitled The Vicomte de\nBragelonne, ends here.]\n\n[Footnote 2:  In most other editions, the previous chapter and the next are\nusually combined into one chapter, entitled \"D'Artagnan calls\nDe Wardes to account.\"]\n\n[Footnote 3:  Dumas is mistaken.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
