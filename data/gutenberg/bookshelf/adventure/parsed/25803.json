M. C. W.)\n\n\n\n\nTHE KEEPERS OF THE KING'S PEACE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nBONES, SANDERS AND ANOTHER\n\n\nTo Isongo, which stands upon the tributary of that name, came a woman of\nthe Isisi who had lost her husband through a providential tree falling\nupon him. I say \"providential,\" for it was notorious that he was an evil\nman, a drinker of beer and a favourite of many bad persons. Also he made\nmagic in the forest, and was reputedly the familiar of Bashunbi the\ndevil brother of M'shimba-M'shamba. He beat his wives, and once had set\nfire to his house from sheer wickedness. So that when he was borne back\nto the village on a grass bier and the women of his house decked\nthemselves with green leaves and arm in arm staggered and stamped\nthrough the village street in their death dance, there was a suspicion\nof hilarity in their song, and a more cheery step in their dance than\nthe occasion called for.\n\nAn old man named D'wiri, who knew every step of every dance, saw this\nand said in his stern way that it was shameless. But he was old and was,\nmoreover, in fear for the decorum of his own obsequies if these\noutrageous departures from custom were approved or allowed to pass\nwithout reprimand.\n\nWhen M'lama, the wife of G'mami, had seen her lord depart in the canoe\nfor burial in the middle island and had wailed her conventional grief,\nshe washed the dust from her body at the river's edge and went back to\nher hut. And all that was grief for the dead man was washed away with\nthe dust of mourning.\n\nMany moons came out of the sky, were wasted and died before the woman\nM'lama showed signs of her gifts. It is said that they appeared one\nnight after a great storm wherein lightning played such strange tricks\nupon the river that even the old man D'wiri could not remember parallel\ninstances.\n\nIn the night the wife of a hunter named E'sani-Osoni brought a dying\nchild into the hut of the widow. He had been choked by a fish-bone and\nwas _in extremis_ when M'lama put her hand upon his head and straightway\nthe bone flew from his mouth, \"and there was a cry terrible to\nhear--such a cry as a leopard makes when he is pursued by ghosts.\"\n\nA week later a baby girl fell into a terrible fit and M'lama had laid\nher hand upon it and behold! it slept from that moment.\n\nAhmet, chief of the Government spies, heard of these happenings and came\na three days' journey by river to Isongo.\n\n\"What are these stories of miracles?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Capita_,\" said the chief, using the term of regard which is employed\nin the Belgian Congo, \"this woman M'lama is a true witch and has great\ngifts, for she raises the dead by the touch of her hand. This I have\nseen. Also it is said that when U'gomi, the woodcutter, made a fault,\ncutting his foot in two, this woman healed him marvellously.\"\n\n\"I will see this M'lama,\" said Ahmet importantly.\n\nHe found her in her hut tossing four bones idly. These were the shanks\nof goats, and each time they fell differently.\n\n\"O Ahmet,\" she said, when he entered, \"you have a wife who is sick, also\na first-born boy who does not speak though he is more than six seasons\nold.\"\n\nAhmet squatted down by her side.\n\n\"Woman,\" said he, \"tell me something that is not the talk of river and I\nwill believe your magic.\"\n\n\"To-morrow your master, the lord Sandi, will send you a book which will\ngive you happiness,\" she said.\n\n\"Every day my lord sends me a book,\" retorted the sceptical Ahmet, \"and\neach brings me happiness. Also it is common talk that at this time\nthere come messengers carrying bags of silver and salt to pay men\naccording to their services.\"\n\nUndismayed she tried her last shot.\n\n\"You have a crooked finger which none can straighten--behold!\"\n\nShe took his hand in hers and pressed the injured phlange. A sharp pain\nshot up his arm and he winced, pulling back his hand--but the year-old\ndislocation which had defied the effort of the coast doctor was\nstraightened out, and though the movement was exquisitely painful he\ncould bend it.\n\n\"I see you are a true witch,\" he said, greatly impressed, for a native\nhas a horror of deformity of any kind, and he sent back word of the\nphenomenon to Sanders.\n\nSanders at the same time was in receipt of other news which alternately\npleased him and filled him with panic. The mail had come in by fast\nlaunch and had brought Captain Hamilton of the Houssas a very bulky\nletter written in a feminine hand. He had broken the glad news to\nCommissioner Sanders, but that gentleman was not certain in his mind\nwhether the startling intelligence conveyed by the letter was good or\nbad.\n\n\"I'm sure the country will suit her,\" he said, \"this part of the country\nat any rate--but what will Bones say?\"\n\n\"Bones!\" repeated Captain Hamilton scornfully. \"What the dickens does\nit matter what Bones says?\"\n\nNevertheless, he went to the sea-end of the verandah, and his roar\nrivalled the thunder of the surf.\n\n\"Bones!\"\n\nThere was no answer and for an excellent reason.\n\nSanders came out of the bungalow, his helmet on the back of his head, a\ncheroot tilted dizzily.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he asked.\n\nHamilton turned.\n\n\"I asked him to--at least I didn't ask him, he volunteered--to peg out a\ntrench line.\"\n\n\"Expect an invasion?\" asked Sanders.\n\nHamilton grinned.\n\n\"Bones does,\" he said. \"He's full of the idea, and offered to give me\ntips on the way a trench should be dug--he's feeling rotten about things\n... you know what I mean. His regiment was at Mons.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said quietly. \"And you ... you're a jolly good\nsoldier, Hamilton--how do you feel about it all?\"\n\nHamilton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"They would have taken me for the Cameroons, but somebody had to stay,\"\nhe said quietly. \"After all, it is one's business to ... to do one's job\nin the station of life to which it has pleased God to call him. This is\nmy work ... here.\"\n\nSanders laid his hand on the other's shoulder.\n\n\"That's the game as it should be played,\" he said, and his blue eyes\nwere as soft and as tender as a woman's. \"There is no war here--we are\nthe keepers of the King's peace, Hamilton.\"\n\n\"It's rotten....\"\n\n\"I know--I feel that way myself. We're out of it--the glory of it--the\nchance of it--the tragedy of it. And there are others. Think of the men\nin India eating their hearts out ... praying for the order that will\ncarry them from the comfort of their lives to the misery and the\ndeath--and the splendour, I grant you--of war.\"\n\nHe sighed and looked wistfully to the blue sea.\n\nHamilton beckoned a Houssa corporal who was crossing the garden of the\nResidency.\n\n\"Ho, Mustaf,\" he said, in his queer coast Arabic, \"where shall I look\nfor my lord Tibbetti?\"\n\nThe corporal turned and pointed to the woods which begin at the back of\nthe Residency and carry without a break for three hundred miles.\n\n\"Lord, he went there carrying many strange things--also there went with\nhim Ali Abid, his servant.\"\n\nHamilton reached through an open window of the bungalow and fished out\nhis helmet with his walking-stick.\n\n\"We'll find Bones,\" he said grimly; \"he's been gone three hours and he's\nhad time to re-plan Verdun.\"\n\nIt took some time to discover the working party, but when it was found\nthe trouble was well repaid.\n\nBones was stretched on a canvas chair under the shade of a big Isisi\npalm. His helmet was tipped forward so that the brim rested on the\nbridge of his nose, his thin red arms were folded on his breast, and\ntheir gentle rise and fall testified to his shame. Two pegs had been\ndriven in, and between them a string sagged half-heartedly.\n\nCurled up under a near-by bush was, presumably, Ali Abid--presumably,\nbecause all that was visible was a very broad stretch of brown satin\nskin which showed between the waistline of a pair of white cotton\ntrousers and a duck jacket.\n\nThey looked down at the unconscious Bones for a long time in silence.\n\n\"What will he say when I kick him?\" asked Hamilton. \"You can have the\nfirst guess.\"\n\nSanders frowned thoughtfully.\n\n\"He'll say that he was thinking out a new system of communicating\ntrenches,\" he said. \"He's been boring me to tears over saps and things.\"\n\nHamilton shook his head.\n\n\"Wrong, sir,\" he said; \"that isn't the lie he'll tell. He will say that\nI kept him up so late last night working at the men's pay-sheets that he\ncouldn't keep awake.\"\n\nBones slept on.\n\n\"He may say that it was coffee after tiffin,\" suggested Sanders after a\nwhile; \"he said the other day that coffee always made him sleep.\"\n\n\"'Swoon' was the word he used, sir,\" corrected Hamilton. \"I don't think\nhe'll offer that suggestion now--the only other excuse I can think of is\nthat he was repeating the Bomongo irregular verbs. Bones!\"\n\nHe stooped and broke off a long grass and inserted it in the right ear\nof Lieutenant Tibbetts, twiddling the end delicately. Bones made a\nfeeble clutch at his ear, but did not open his eyes.\n\n\"Bones!\" said Hamilton, and kicked him less gently. \"Get up, you lazy\ndevil--there's an invasion.\"\n\nBones leapt to his feet and staggered a little; blinked fiercely at his\nsuperior and saluted.\n\n\"Enemy on the left flank, sir,\" he reported stiffly. \"Shall we have\ndinner or take a taxi?\"\n\n\"Wake up, Napoleon,\" begged Hamilton, \"you're at Waterloo.\"\n\nBones blinked more slowly.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've been unconscious, dear old officer,\" he confessed. \"The\nfact is----\"\n\n\"Listen to this, everybody,\" said Hamilton admiringly.\n\n\"The fact is, sir,\" said Bones, with dignity, \"I fell asleep--that\nbeastly coffee I had after lunch, added to the fatigue of sittin' up\nhalf the night with those jolly old accounts of yours, got the better of\nme. I was sittin' down workin' out one of the dinkiest little ideas in\ntrenches--a sort of communicatin' trench where you needn't get wet in\nthe rainiest weather--when I--well, I just swooned off.\"\n\nHamilton looked disappointed.\n\n\"Weren't you doing anything with the Bomongo verbs?\" he demanded.\n\nA light came to Bones's eyes.\n\n\"By Jove, sir!\" he said heartily, \"that was it, of course.... The last\nthing I remember was....\"\n\n\"Kick that man of yours and come back to the bungalow,\" Hamilton\ninterrupted, \"there's a job for you, my boy.\"\n\nHe walked across and stirred the second sleeper with the toe of his\nboot.\n\nAli Abid wriggled round and sat up.\n\nHe was square of face, with a large mouth and two very big brown eyes.\nHe was enormously fat, but it was not fat of the flabby type. Though he\ncalled himself Ali, it was, as Bones admitted, \"sheer swank\" to do so,\nfor this man had \"coast\" written all over him.\n\nHe got up slowly and saluted first his master, then Sanders, and lastly\nHamilton.\n\nBones had found him at Cape Coast Castle on the occasion of a joy-ride\nwhich the young officer had taken on a British man-of-war. Ali Abid had\nbeen the heaven-sent servant, and though Sanders had a horror of natives\nwho spoke English, the English of Ali Abid was his very own.\n\nHe had been for five years the servant of Professor Garrileigh, the\neminent bacteriologist, the account of whose researches in the field of\ntropical medicines fill eight volumes of closely-printed matter, every\npage of which contains words which are not to be found in most lexicons.\n\nThey walked back to the Residency, Ali Abid in the rear.\n\n\"I want you to go up to the Isongo, Bones,\" said Sanders; \"there may be\nsome trouble there--a woman is working miracles.\"\n\n\"He might get a new head,\" murmured Hamilton, but Bones pretended not to\nhear.\n\n\"Use your tact and get back before the 17th for the party.\"\n\n\"The----?\" asked Bones.\n\nHe had an irritating trick of employing extravagant gestures of a\nfairly commonplace kind. Thus, if he desired to hear a statement\nrepeated--though he had heard it well enough the first time--he\nwould bend his head with a puzzled wrinkle of forehead, put his hand\nto his ear and wait anxiously, even painfully, for the repetition.\n\n\"You heard what the Commissioner said,\" growled Hamilton.\n\"Party--P-A-R-T-Y.\"\n\n\"My birthday is not until April, your Excellency,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I'd guess the date--but what's the use?\" interposed Hamilton.\n\n\"It isn't a birthday party, Bones,\" said Sanders. \"We are giving a\nhouse-warming for Miss Hamilton.\"\n\nBones gasped, and turned an incredulous eye upon his chief.\n\n\"You haven't a sister, surely, dear old officer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why the dickens shouldn't I have a sister?\" demanded his chief.\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"A matter of deduction, sir,\" he said quietly. \"Absence of all evidence\nof a soothin' and lovin' influence in your lonely an' unsympathetic\nupbringin'; hardness of heart an' a disposition to nag, combined with a\nrough and unpromisin' exterior--a sister, good Lord!\"\n\n\"Anyway, she's coming, Bones,\" said Hamilton; \"and she's looking forward\nto seeing you--I've written an awful lot about you.\"\n\nBones smirked.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"you've overdone it a bit--women hate to be\ndisillusioned. What you ought to have done, sir, is to describe me as a\nsort of ass--genial and all that sort of thing, but a commonplace sort\nof ass.\"\n\nHamilton nodded.\n\n\"That's exactly what I've done, Bones,\" he said. \"I told her how Bosambo\ndid you in the eye for twenty pounds, and how you fell into the water\nlooking for buried treasure, and how the Isisi tried to sell you a\nflying crocodile and would have sold it too, if it hadn't been for my\ntimely arrival. I told her----\"\n\n\"I think you've said enough, sir.\"\n\nBones was very red and very haughty.\n\n\"Far be it from me to resent your attitude or contradict your calumnies.\nMiss Hamilton will see very little of me. An inflexible sense of duty\nwill keep me away from the frivolous circle of society, sir. Alert an'\nsleepless----\"\n\n\"Trenches,\" said Hamilton brutally.\n\nBones winced, regarded his superior for a moment with pain, saluted, and\nturning on his heel, stalked away, followed by Ali Abid no less pained.\n\nHe left at dawn the next morning, and both Sanders and Hamilton came\ndown to the concrete quay to see the _Zaire_ start on her journey.\nSanders gave his final instructions--\n\n\"If the woman is upsetting the people, arrest her; if she has too big a\nhold on them, arrest her; but if she is just amusing them, come back.\"\n\n\"And don't forget the 17th,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I may arrive a little late for that,\" said Bones gravely. \"I don't\nwish to be a skeleton at your jolly old festive board, dear old\nsportsman--you will excuse my absence to Miss Hamilton. I shall\nprobably have a headache and all that sort of thing.\"\n\nHe waved a sad farewell as the _Zaire_ passed round the bend of the\nriver, and looked, as he desired to look, a melancholy figure with his\nhuge pipe in his mouth and his hands thrust dejectedly into his trousers\npockets.\n\nOnce out of sight he became his own jovial self.\n\n\"Lieutenant Ali,\" he said, \"get out my log and put it in old Sanders'\ncabin, make me a cup of tea and keep her jolly old head east, east by\nnorth.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Ali in excellent English.\n\nThe \"log\" which Bones kept was one of the secret documents which never\ncome under the eye of the superior authorities. There were such entries\nas--\n\n     \"Wind N.N.W. Sea calm. Hostile craft sighted on port bow, at 10.31\n     a.m. General Quarters sounded 10.32. Interrogated Captain of the\n     hostile craft and warned him not to fish in fair-way. Sighted Cape\n     M'Gooboori 12.17, stopped for lunch and wood.\"\n\nWhat though Cape M'Gooboori was the village of that name and the \"calm\nsea\" was no more than the placid bosom of the Great River? What though\nBones's \"hostile craft\" was a dilapidated canoe, manned by one aged and\nbewildered man of the Isisi engaged in spearing fish? Bones saw all\nthings through the rosy spectacles of adventurous youth denied its\nproper share of experience.\n\nAt sunset the _Zaire_ came gingerly through the shoals that run out from\nthe Isongo beach, and Bones went ashore to conduct his investigations.\nIt chanced that the evening had been chosen by M'lama, the witch, for\ncertain wonderful manifestations, and the village was almost deserted.\n\nIn a wood and in a place of green trees M'lama sat tossing her sheep\nshanks, and a dense throng of solemn men and women squatted or sat or\ntiptoed about her--leaving her a respectable space for her operations. A\nbright fire crackled and glowed at her side, and into this, from time to\ntime, she thrust little sticks of plaited straw and drew them forth\nblazing and spluttering until with a quick breath she extinguished the\nflame and examined the grey ash.\n\n\"Listen, all people,\" she said, \"and be silent, lest my great ju-ju\nstrike you dead. What man gave me this?\"\n\n\"It was I, M'lama,\" said an eager woman, her face wrinkled with\napprehension as she held up her brown palm.\n\nThe witch peered forward at the speaker.\n\n\"O F'sela!\" she chanted, \"there is a man-child for thee who shall be\ngreater than chiefs; also you will suffer from a sickness which shall\nmake you mad.\"\n\n\"O ko!\"\n\nHalf dismayed by the promise of her own fate; half exalted by the career\nthe witch had sketched for her unborn son, the woman stared\nincredulously, fearfully at the swaying figure by the fire.\n\nAgain a plaited stick went into the fire, was withdrawn and blown out,\nand the woman again prophesied.\n\nAnd sometimes it was of honours and riches she spoke, and sometimes--and\nmore often--of death and disaster. Into this shuddering group strode\nBones, very finely clad in white raiment yet limp withal, for the night\nwas close and the way had been long and rough.\n\nThe sitters scrambled to their feet, their knuckles at their teeth, for\nthis was a moment of great embarrassment.\n\n\"Oh, M'lama,\" said Bones agreeably, and spoke in the soft dialect of the\nIsisi by-the-River, \"prophesy for me!\"\n\nShe looked up sullenly, divining trouble for herself.\n\n\"Lord,\" she said, with a certain smooth venom, \"there is a great\nsickness for you--and behold you will go far away and die, and none\nshall miss you.\"\n\nBones went very red, and shook an indignant forefinger at the offending\nprophetess.\n\n\"You're a wicked old storyteller!\" he stammered. \"You're depressin' the\npeople--you naughty girl! I hate you--I simply loathe you!\"\n\nAs he spoke in English she was not impressed.\n\n\"Goin' about the country puttin' people off their grub, by Jove!\" he\nstormed; \"tellin' stories ... oh, dash it, I shall have to be awfully\nsevere with you!\"\n\nSevere he was, for he arrested her, to the relief of her audience, who\nwaited long enough to discover whether or not her ju-ju would strike him\ndead, and being obviously disappointed by her failure to provide this\nspectacle, melted away.\n\nClose to the gangway of the _Zaire_ she persuaded one of her Houssa\nguard to release his hold. She persuaded him by the simple expedient of\nburying her sharp white teeth in the fleshy part of his arm--and bolted.\nThey captured her half mad with panic and fear of her unknown fate, and\nbrought her to the boat.\n\nBones, fussing about the struggling group, dancing with excitement, was\nhonourably wounded by the chance contact of his nose with a wild and\nwhirling fist.\n\n\"Put her in the store cabin!\" he commanded breathlessly. \"Oh, what a\nwicked woman!\"\n\nIn the morning as the boat got under way Ali came to him with a\ndistressing story.\n\n\"Your Excellency will be pained to hear,\" he said, \"that the female\nprisoner has eradicated her costume.\"\n\n\"Eradicated...?\" repeated the puzzled Bones, gently touching the patch\nof sticking-plaster on his nose.\n\n\"In the night,\" explained this former slave of science, \"the subject has\ndeveloped symptoms of mania, and has entirely dispensed with her\nclothes--to wit, by destruction.\"\n\n\"She's torn up her clothes?\" gasped Bones, his hair rising and Ali\nnodded.\n\nNow, the dress of a native woman varies according to the degree in\nwhich she falls under missionary influence. Isongo was well within\nthe sphere of the River Mission, and so M'lama's costume consisted\nof a tight-fitting piece of print which wound round and round the body\nin the manner of a kilt, covering the figure from armpit to feet.\n\nBones went to the open window of the prison cabin, and steadfastly\naverting his gaze, called--\n\n\"M'lama!\"\n\nNo reply came, and he called again.\n\n\"M'lama,\" he said gently, in the river dialect, \"what shall Sandi say to\nthis evil that you do?\"\n\nThere was no reply, only a snuffling sound of woe.\n\n\"Oh, ai!\" sobbed the voice.\n\n\"M'lama, presently we shall come to the Mission house where the God-men\nare, and I will bring you clothing--these you will put on you,\" said\nBones, still staring blankly over the side of the ship at the waters\nwhich foamed past her low hull; \"for if my lord Sandi see you as I see\nyou--I mean as I wouldn't for the world see you, you improper person,\"\nhe corrected himself hastily in English--\"if my lord Sandi saw you, he\nwould feel great shame. Also,\" he added, as a horrible thought made him\ngo cold all over, \"also the lady who comes to my lord Militini--oh,\nlor!\"\n\nThese last two words were in English.\n\nFortunately there was a Jesuit settlement near by, and here Bones\nstopped and interviewed the stout and genial priest in charge.\n\n\"It's curious how they all do it,\" reflected the priest, as he led the\nway to his storehouse. \"I've known 'em to tear up their clothes in an\nEast End police cell--white folk, the same as you and I.\"\n\nHe rummaged in a big box and produced certain garments.\n\n\"My last consignment from a well-meaning London congregation,\" he\nsmiled, and flung out a heap of dresses, hats, stockings and shoes. \"If\nthey'd sent a roll or two of print I might have used them--but strong\nreligious convictions do not entirely harmonize with a last year's Paris\nmodel.\"\n\nBones, flushed and unhappy, grabbed an armful of clothing, and showering\nthe chuckling priest with an incoherent medley of apology and thanks,\nhurried back to the _Zaire_.\n\n\"Behold, M'lama,\" he said, as he thrust his loot through the window of\nthe little deck-house, \"there are many grand things such as great ladies\nwear--now you shall appear before Sandi beautiful to see.\"\n\nHe logged the happening in characteristic language, and was in the midst\nof this literary exercise when the tiny steamer charged a sandbank, and\nbefore her engines could slow or reverse she had slid to the top and\nrested in two feet of water.\n\nA rueful Bones surveyed the situation and returned to his cabin to\nconclude his diary with--\n\n     \"12.19 struck a reef off B'lidi Bay. Fear vessel total wreck. Boats\n     all ready for lowering.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact there were neither boats to lower nor need to lower\nthem, because the crew were already standing in the river (up to their\nhips) and were endeavouring to push the _Zaire_ to deep water.\n\nIn this they were unsuccessful, and it was not for thirty-six hours\nuntil the river, swollen by heavy rains in the Ochori region, lifted the\n_Zaire_ clear of the obstruction, that Bones might record the story of\nhis salvage.\n\nHe had released a reformed M'lama to the greater freedom of the deck,\nand save for a shrill passage at arms between that lady and the corporal\nshe had bitten, there was no sign of a return to her evil ways. She wore\na white pique skirt and a white blouse, and on her head she balanced\ndeftly, without the aid of pins, a yellow straw hat with long trailing\nribbons of heliotrope. Alternately they trailed behind and before.\n\n\"A horrible sight,\" said Bones, shuddering at his first glimpse of her.\n\nThe rest of the journey was uneventful until the _Zaire_ had reached the\nnorthernmost limits of the Residency reserve. Sanders had partly\ncleared and wholly drained four square miles of the little peninsula on\nwhich the Residency stood, and by barbed wire and deep cutting had\nisolated the Government estate from the wild forest land to the north.\n\nHere, the river shoals in the centre, cutting a passage to the sea\nthrough two almost unfathomable channels close to the eastern and\nwestern banks. Bones had locked away his journal and was standing on the\nbridge rehearsing the narrative which was to impress his superiors with\na sense of his resourcefulness--and incidentally present himself in the\nmost favourable light to the new factor which was coming into his daily\nlife.\n\nHe had thought of Hamilton's sister at odd intervals and now....\n\nThe _Zaire_ was hugging the western bank so closely that a bold and\nagile person might have stepped ashore.\n\nM'lama, the witch, was both bold and agile.\n\nHe turned with open mouth to see something white and feminine leap the\nspace between deck and shore, two heliotrope ribbons streaming wildly in\nsuch breeze as there was.\n\n\"Hi! Don't do that ... naughty, naughty!\" yelled the agonized Bones, but\nshe had disappeared into the undergrowth before the big paddle-wheel of\nthe _Zaire_ began to thresh madly astern.\n\nNever was the resourcefulness of Bones more strikingly exemplified. An\nordinary man would have leapt overboard in pursuit, but Bones was no\nordinary man. He remembered in that moment of crisis, the distressing\npropensity of his prisoner to the \"eradication of garments.\" With one\nstride he was in his cabin and had snatched a counterpane from his bed,\nin two bounds he was over the rail on the bank and running swiftly in\nthe direction the fugitive had taken.\n\nFor a little time he did not see her, then he glimpsed the white of a\npique dress, and with a yell of admonition started in pursuit.\n\nShe stood hesitating a moment, then fled, but he was on her before she\nhad gone a dozen yards; the counterpane was flung over her head, and\nthough she kicked and struggled and indulged in muffled squeaks, he\nlifted her up in his arms and staggered back to the boat.\n\nThey ran out a gangway plank and across this he passed with his burden,\ndeclining all offers of assistance.\n\n\"Close the window,\" he gasped; \"open the door--now, you naughty old\nlady!\"\n\nHe bundled her in, counterpane enmeshed and reduced to helpless silence,\nslammed the door and leant panting against the cabin, mopping his brow.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Bones, and repeated the inelegant remark many times. All\nthis happened almost within sight of the quay on which Sanders and\nHamilton were waiting. It was a very important young man who saluted\nthem.\n\n\"All correct, sir,\" said Bones, stiff as a ramrod; \"no\ncasualties--except as per my nose which will be noted in the margin of\nmy report--one female prisoner secured after heroic chase, which, I\ntrust, sir, you will duly report to my jolly old superiors----\"\n\n\"Don't gas so much, Bones,\" said Hamilton. \"Come along and meet my\nsister--hullo, what the devil's that?\"\n\nThey turned with one accord to the forest path.\n\nTwo native policemen were coming towards them, and between them a\nbedraggled M'lama, her skirt all awry, her fine hat at a rakish angle,\nstepped defiantly.\n\n\"Heavens!\" said Bones, \"she's got away again.... That's my prisoner,\ndear old officer!\"\n\nHamilton frowned.\n\n\"I hope she hasn't frightened Pat ... she was walking in the\nreservation.\"\n\nBones did not faint, his knees went from under him, but he recovered by\nclutching the arm of his faithful Ali.\n\n\"Dear old friend,\" he murmured brokenly, \"accidents ... error of\njudgment ... the greatest tragedy of my life....\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded Sanders in alarm, for the face of\nBones was ghastly.\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts made no reply, but walked with unsteady steps to the\nlock-up, fumbled with the key and opened the door.\n\nThere stepped forth a dishevelled and wrathful girl (she was a little\nscared, too, I suspect), the most radiant and lovely figure that had\never dawned upon the horizon of Bones.\n\nShe looked from her staggered brother to Sanders, from Sanders to her\nmiserable custodian.\n\n\"What on earth----\" began Hamilton.\n\nThen her lips twitched and she fell into a fit of uncontrollable\nlaughter.\n\n\"If,\" said Bones huskily, \"if in an excess of zeal I mistook... in the\ngloamin', madame ... white dress....\"\n\nHe spread out his arms in a gesture of extravagant despair.\n\n\"I can do no more than a gentleman.... I have a loaded revolver in my\ncabin ... farewell!\"\n\nHe bowed deeply to the girl, saluted his dumbfounded chief, tripped up\nover a bucket and would have fallen but for Hamilton's hand.\n\n\"You're an ass,\" said Hamilton, struggling to preserve his sense of\nannoyance. \"Pat--this is Lieutenant Tibbetts, of whom I have often\nwritten.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Bones, her eyes moist with laughter.\n\n\"I guessed it from the first,\" she said, and Bones writhed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nBONES CHANGES HIS RELIGION\n\n\nCaptain Hamilton of the King's Houssas had two responsibilities in life,\na sister and a subaltern.\n\nThe sister's name was Patricia Agatha, the subaltern had been born\nTibbetts, christened Augustus, and named by Hamilton in his arbitrary\nway, \"Bones.\"\n\nWhilst sister and subaltern were separated from one another by some\nthree thousand miles of ocean--as far, in fact, as the Coast is from\nBradlesham Thorpe in the County of Hampshire--Captain Hamilton bore his\nresponsibilities without displaying a sense of the burden.\n\nWhen Patricia Hamilton decided on paying a visit to her brother she did\nso with his heartiest approval, for he did not realize that in bringing\nhis two responsibilities face to face he was not only laying the\nfoundation of serious trouble, but was actually engaged in erecting the\nfabric.\n\nPat Hamilton had come and had been boisterously welcomed by her brother\none white-hot morning, Houssas in undress uniform lining the beach and\ngazing solemnly upon Militini's riotous joy. Mr. Commissioner Sanders,\nC.M.G., had given her a more formal welcome, for he was a little scared\nof women. Bones, as we know, had not been present--which was unfortunate\nin more ways than one.\n\nIt made matters no easier for the wretched Bones that Miss Hamilton was\nan exceedingly lovely lady. Men who live for a long time in native lands\nand see little save beautiful figures displayed without art and with\nvery little adornment, are apt to regard any white woman with regular\nfeatures as pretty, when the vision comes to them after a long interval\nspent amidst native people. But it needed neither contrast nor\ncomparison to induce an admiration for Captain Hamilton's sister.\n\nShe was of a certain Celtic type, above the medium height, with the\nfreedom of carriage and gait which is the peculiar possession of her\ncountry-women. Her face was a true oval, and her complexion of that kind\nwhich tans readily but does not freckle.\n\nEyes and mouth were firm and steadfast; she was made for ready laughter,\nyet she was deep enough, and in eyes and mouth alike you read a\ntenderness beyond disguise. She had a trinity of admirers: her brother's\nadmiration was natural and critical; Sanders admired and feared;\nLieutenant Tibbetts admired and resented.\n\nFrom the moment when Bones strode off after the painful discovery, had\nslammed the door of his hut and had steadfastly declined all manner of\nfood and sustenance, he had voluntarily cut himself off from his kind.\n\nHe met Hamilton on parade the following morning, hollow-eyed (as he\nhoped) after a sleepless night, and there was nothing in his attitude\nsuggestive of the deepest respect and the profoundest regard for that\nparagraph of King's Regulations which imposes upon the junior officer a\nbecoming attitude of humility in the presence of his superior officer.\n\n\"How is your head, Bones?\" asked Hamilton, after the parade had been\ndismissed.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Bones bitterly--though why he should be bitter at\nthe kindly inquiry only he knew--\"thank you, sir, it is about the same.\nMy temperature is--or was--up to one hundred and four, and I have been\ndelirious. I wouldn't like to say, dear old--sir, that I'm not nearly\ndelirious now.\"\n\n\"Come up to tiffin,\" invited Hamilton.\n\nBones saluted--a sure preliminary to a dramatic oration.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said firmly, \"you've always been a jolly old officer to me\nbefore this contretemps wrecked my young life--but I shall never be\nquite the same man again, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass,\" begged Hamilton.\n\n\"Revile me, sir,\" said Bones dismally; \"give me a dangerous mission, one\nof those jolly old adventures where a feller takes his life in one\nhand, his revolver in the other, but don't ask me----\"\n\n\"My sister wants to see you,\" said Hamilton, cutting short the flow of\neloquence.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Bones hollowly, and strode into his hut.\n\n\"And what I'm going to do with him, Heaven knows,\" groaned Hamilton at\ntiffin. \"The fact is, Pat, your arrival on the scene has thoroughly\ndemoralized him.\"\n\nThe girl folded her serviette and walked to the window, and stood\nlooking out over the yellow stretch of the deserted parade-ground.\n\n\"I'm going to call on Bones,\" she said suddenly.\n\n\"Poor Bones!\" murmured Sanders.\n\n\"That's very rude!\" She took down her solar helmet from the peg behind\nthe door and adjusted it carefully. Then she stepped through the open\ndoor, whistling cheerfully.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind, sir,\" apologized Hamilton, \"but we've never\nsucceeded in stopping her habit of whistling.\"\n\nSanders laughed.\n\n\"It would be strange if she didn't whistle,\" he said cryptically.\n\nBones was lying on his back, his hands behind his head. A half-emptied\ntin of biscuits, no less than the remnants of a box of chocolates,\nindicated that anchorite as he was determined to be, his austerity did\nnot run in the direction of starvation.\n\nHis mind was greatly occupied by a cinematograph procession of\nmelancholy pictures. Perhaps he would go away, far, far, into the\ninterior. Even into the territory of the great king where a man's life\nis worth about five cents net. And as day by day passed and no news came\nof him--as how could it when his habitation was marked by a cairn of\nstones?--she would grow anxious and unhappy. And presently messengers\nwould come bringing her a few poor trinkets he had bequeathed to her--a\nwrist-watch, a broken sword, a silver cigarette-case dented with the\narrow that slew him--and she would weep silently in the loneliness of\nher room.\n\nAnd perhaps he would find strength to send a few scrawled words asking\nfor her pardon, and the tears would well up in her beautiful grey\neyes--as they were already welling in Bones's eyes at the picture he\ndrew--and she would know--all.\n\n\"Phweet!\"\n\nOr else, maybe he would be stricken down with fever, and she would want\nto come and nurse him, but he would refuse.\n\n\"Tell her,\" he would say weakly, but oh, so bravely, \"tell her ... I ask\nonly ... her pardon.\"\n\n\"Phweet!\"\n\nBones heard the second whistle. It came from the open window immediately\nabove his head. A song bird was a rare visitor to these parts, but he\nwas too lazy and too absorbed to look up.\n\nPerhaps (he resumed) she would never see him again, never know the deep\nsense of injustice....\n\n\"Phwee--et!\"\n\nIt was clearer and more emphatic, and he half turned his head to\nlook----\n\nHe was on his feet in a second, his hand raised to his damp forehead,\nfor leaning on the window sill, her lips pursed for yet another whistle,\nwas the lady of his thoughts.\n\nShe met his eyes sternly.\n\n\"Come outside--misery!\" she said, and Bones gasped and obeyed.\n\n\"What do you mean,\" she demanded, \"by sulking in your wretched little\nhut when you ought to be crawling about on your hands and knees begging\nmy pardon?\"\n\nBones said nothing.\n\n\"Bones,\" said this outrageous girl, shaking her head reprovingly, \"you\nwant a jolly good slapping!\"\n\nBones extended his bony wrist.\n\n\"Slap!\" he said defiantly.\n\nHe had hardly issued the challenge when a very firm young palm, driven\nby an arm toughened by a long acquaintance with the royal and ancient\ngame, came \"Smack!\" and Bones winced.\n\n\"Play the game, dear old Miss Hamilton,\" he said, rubbing his wrist.\n\n\"Play the game yourself, dear old Bones,\" she mimicked him. \"You ought\nto be ashamed of yourself----\"\n\n\"Let bygones be bygones, jolly old Miss Hamilton,\" begged Bones\nmagnanimously. \"And now that I see you're a sport, put it there, if it\nweighs a ton.\"\n\nAnd he held out his nobbly hand and caught the girl's in a grip that\nmade her grimace.\n\nFive minutes later he was walking her round the married quarters of his\nHoussas, telling her the story of his earliest love affair. She was an\nexcellent listener, and seldom interrupted him save to ask if there was\nany insanity in his family, or whether the girl was short-sighted; in\nfact, as Bones afterwards said, it might have been Hamilton himself.\n\n\"What on earth are they finding to talk about?\" wondered Sanders,\nwatching the confidences from the depths of a big cane chair on the\nverandah.\n\n\"Bones,\" replied Hamilton lazily, \"is telling her the story of his life\nand how he saved the territories from rebellion. He's also begging her\nnot to breathe a word of this to me for fear of hurting my feelings.\"\n\nAt that precise moment Bones was winding up a most immodest recital of\nhis accomplishments with a less immodest footnote.\n\n\"Of course, dear old Miss Hamilton,\" he was saying, lowering his voice,\n\"I shouldn't like a word of this to come to your jolly old brother's\nears. He's an awfully good sort, but naturally in competition with an\nagile mind like mine, understanding the native as I do, he hasn't an\nearthly----\"\n\n\"Why don't you write the story of your adventures?\" she asked\ninnocently. \"It would sell like hot cakes.\"\n\nBones choked with gratification.\n\n\"Precisely my idea--oh, what a mind you've got! What a pity it doesn't\nrun in the family! I'll tell you a precious secret--not a word to\nanybody--honest?\"\n\n\"Honest,\" she affirmed.\n\nBones looked round.\n\n\"It's practically ready for the publisher,\" he whispered, and stepped\nback to observe the effect of his words.\n\nShe shook her head in admiration, her eyes were dancing with delight,\nand Bones realized that here at last he had met a kindred soul.\n\n\"It must be awfully interesting to write books,\" she sighed. \"I've\ntried--but I can never invent anything.\"\n\n\"Of course, in my case----\" corrected Bones.\n\n\"I suppose you just sit down with a pen in your hand and imagine all\nsorts of things,\" she mused, directing her feet to the Residency.\n\n\"This is the story of my life,\" explained Bones earnestly. \"Not\nfiction ... but all sorts of adventures that actually happened.\"\n\n\"To whom?\" she asked.\n\n\"To me,\" claimed Bones, louder than was necessary.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said.\n\n\"Don't start 'Oh-ing,'\" said Bones in a huff. \"If you and I are going to\nbe good friends, dear old Miss Hamilton, don't say 'Oh!'\"\n\n\"Don't be a bully, Bones.\" She turned on him so fiercely that he shrank\nback.\n\n\"Play the game,\" he said feebly; \"play the game, dear old sister!\"\n\nShe led him captive to the stoep and deposited him in the easiest chair\nshe could find.\n\nFrom that day he ceased to be anything but a slave, except on one point.\n\nThe question of missions came up at tiffin, and Miss Hamilton revealed\nthe fact that she favoured the High Church and held definite views on\nthe clergy.\n\nBones confessed that he was a Wesleyan.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you're a Nonconformist?\" she asked\nincredulously.\n\n\"That's my dinky little religion, dear old Miss Hamilton,\" said Bones.\n\"I'd have gone into the Church only I hadn't enough--enough----\"\n\n\"Brains?\" suggested Hamilton.\n\n\"Call is the word,\" said Bones. \"I wasn't called--or if I was I was\nout--haw-haw! That's a rippin' little bit of persiflage, Miss Hamilton?\"\n\n\"Be serious, Bones,\" said the girl; \"you mustn't joke about things.\"\n\nShe put him through a cross-examination to discover the extent of his\nconvictions. In self-defence Bones, with only the haziest idea of the\ndoctrine he defended, summarily dismissed certain of Miss Hamilton's\nmost precious beliefs.\n\n\"But, Bones,\" she persisted, \"if I asked you to change----\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"Dear old friend,\" he said solemnly, \"there are two things I'll never\ndo--alter the faith of my distant but happy youth, or listen to one\ndisparagin' word about the jolliest old sister that ever----\"\n\n\"That will do, Bones,\" she said, with dignity. \"I can see that you don't\nlike me as I thought you did--what do you think, Mr. Sanders?\"\n\nSanders smiled.\n\n\"I can hardly judge--you see,\" he added apologetically, \"I'm a Wesleyan\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Patricia, and fled in confusion.\n\nBones rose in silence, crossed to his chief and held out his hand.\n\n\"Brother,\" he said brokenly.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing?\" snarled Sanders.\n\n\"Spoken like a true Christian, dear old Excellency and sir,\" murmured\nBones. \"We'll bring her back to the fold.\"\n\nHe stepped nimbly to the door, and the serviette ring that Sanders threw\nwith unerring aim caught his angular shoulder as he vanished.\n\nThat same night Sanders had joyful news to impart. He came into the\nResidency to find Bones engaged in mastering the art of embroidery under\nthe girl's tuition.\n\nSanders interrupted what promised to be a most artistic execution.\n\n\"Who says a joy-ride to the upper waters of the Isisi?\"\n\nHamilton jumped up.\n\n\"Joy-ride?\" he said, puzzled.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"We leave to-morrow for the Lesser Isisi to settle a religious\npalaver--Bucongo of the Lesser Isisi is getting a little too\nenthusiastic a Christian, and Ahmet has been sending some queer reports.\nI've been putting off the palaver for weeks, but Administration says it\nhas no objection to my making a picnic of duty--so we'll all go.\"\n\n\"Tri-umph!\" said Hamilton. \"Bones, leave your needlework and go overhaul\nthe stores.\"\n\nBones, kneeling on a chair, his elbows on the table, looked up.\n\n\"As jolly old Francis Drake said when the Spanish Armada----\"\n\n\"To the stores, you insubordinate beggar!\" commanded Hamilton, and Bones\nmade a hurried exit.\n\nThe accommodation of the _Zaire_ was limited, but there was the launch,\na light-draught boat which was seldom used except for tributary work.\n\n\"I could put Bones in charge of the _Wiggle_,\" he said, \"but he'd be\npretty sure to smash her up. Miss Hamilton will have my cabin, and you\nand I could take the two smaller cabins.\"\n\nBones, to whom it was put, leapt at the suggestion, brushing aside all\nobjections. They were answered before they were framed.\n\nAs for the girl, she was beside herself with joy.\n\n\"Will there be any fighting?\" she asked breathlessly. \"Shall we be\nattacked?\"\n\nSanders shook his head smilingly.\n\n\"All you have to do,\" said Bones confidently, \"is to stick to me. Put\nyour faith in old Bones. When you see the battle swayin' an' it isn't\ncertain which way it's goin', look for my jolly old banner wavin' above\nthe stricken field.\"\n\n\"And be sure it _is_ his banner,\" interrupted Hamilton, \"and not his\nlarge feet. Now the last time we had a fight....\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to publish and utter a scandalous libel, Bones\nprotesting incoherently the while.\n\nThe expedition was on the point of starting when Hamilton took his\njunior aside.\n\n\"Bones,\" he said, not unkindly, \"I know you're a whale of a navigator,\nand all that sort of thing, and my sister, who has an awfully keen sense\nof humour, would dearly love to see you at the helm of the _Wiggle_, but\nas the Commissioner wants to make a holiday, I think it would be best if\nyou left the steering to one of the boys.\"\n\nBones drew himself up stiffly.\n\n\"Dear old officer,\" he said aggrieved, \"I cannot think that you wish to\nspeak disparagingly of my intelligence----\"\n\n\"Get that silly idea out of your head,\" said Hamilton. \"That is just\nwhat I'm trying to do.\"\n\n\"I'm under your jolly old orders, sir,\" Bones said with the air of an\nearly Christian martyr, \"and according to Paragraph 156 of King's\nRegulations----\"\n\n\"Don't let us go into that,\" said Hamilton. \"I'm not giving you any\ncommands, I'm merely making a sensible suggestion. Of course, if you\nwant to make an ass of yourself----\"\n\n\"I have never had the slightest inclination that way, cheery old sir,\"\nsaid Bones, \"and I'm not likely at my time of life to be influenced by\nmy surroundings.\"\n\nHe saluted again and made his way to the barracks. Bones had a\ndifficulty in packing his stores. In truth they had all been packed\nbefore he reached the _Wiggle_, and to an unprofessional eye they were\npacked very well indeed, but Bones had them turned out and packed _his_\nway. When that was done, and it was obvious to the meanest intelligence\nthat the _Wiggle_ was in terrible danger of capsizing before she\nstarted, the stores were unshipped and rearranged under the directions\nof the fuming Hamilton.\n\nWhen the third packing was completed, the general effect bore a\nstriking resemblance to the position of the stores as Bones had found\nthem when he came to the boat. When everybody was ready to start, Bones\nremembered that he had forgotten his log-book, and there was another\nwait.\n\n\"Have you got everything now?\" asked Sanders wearily, leaning over the\nrail.\n\n\"Everything, sir,\" said Bones, with a salute to his superior, and a\nsmile to the girl.\n\n\"Have you got your hot-water bottle and your hair-curlers?\" demanded\nHamilton offensively.\n\nBones favoured him with a dignified stare, made a signal to the\nengineer, and the _Wiggle_ started forward, as was her wont, with a jerk\nwhich put upon Bones the alternative of making a most undignified sprawl\nor clutching a very hot smoke-stack. He chose the latter, recovered his\nbalance with an easy grace, punctiliously saluted the tiny flag of the\n_Zaire_ as he whizzed past her, and under the very eyes of Hamilton,\nwith all the calmness in the world, took the wheel from the steersman's\nhand and ran the _Wiggle_ ashore.\n\nAll this he did in the brief space of three minutes.\n\n\"And,\" said Hamilton, exasperated to a degree, \"if you'd only broken\nyour infernal head, the accident would have been worth it.\"\n\nIt took half an hour for the _Wiggle_ to get afloat again. She had run\nup the beach, and it was necessary to unload the stores, carry them back\nto the quay and reload her again.\n\n\"_Now_ are you ready?\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Bones, abased but nautical.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBucongo, the chief of the Lesser Isisi folk, had a dispute with his\nbrother-in-law touching a certain matter which affected his honour. It\naffected his life eventually, since his relative was found one morning\ndead of a spear-thrust. This Sanders discovered after the big trial\nwhich followed certain events described hereafter.\n\nThe brother-in-law in his malice had sworn that Bucongo held communion\nwith devils. It is a fact that Bucongo had, at an early age, been\ncaptured by Catholic missionaries, and had spent an uncomfortable youth\nmastering certain mysterious rites and ceremonies. His brother-in-law\nhad been in the blessed service of another missionary who taught that\nGod lived in the river, and that to fully benefit by his ju-ju it was\nnecessary to be immersed in the flowing stream.\n\nBetween the water-God men and the cross-God men there was ever a feud,\neach speaking disparagingly of the other, though converts to each creed\nhad this in common, that neither understood completely the faith into\nwhich they were newly admitted. The advantage lay with the Catholic\nconverts because they were given a pewter medal with hearts and sunlike\nradiations engraved thereon (this medal was admittedly a cure for\ntoothache and pains in the stomach), whilst the Protestants had little\nbeyond a mysterious something that they referred to as A'lamo--which\nmeans Grace.\n\nBut when taunted by their medal-flaunting rivals and challenged to\nproduce this \"Grace,\" they were crestfallen and ashamed, being obliged\nto admit that A'lamo was an invisible magic which (they stoutly\naffirmed) was nevertheless an excellent magic, since it preserved one\nfrom drowning and cured warts and boils.\n\nBucongo, the most vigorous partisan of the cross-God men, and an\ninnovator of ritual, found amusement in watching the Baptist\nmissionaries standing knee-deep in the river washing the souls of the\nconverts.\n\nHe had even been insolent to young Ferguson, the earnest leader of the\nAmerican Baptist Mission, and to his intense amazement had been suddenly\nfloored with a left-hander delivered by the sometime Harvard middle\nweight.\n\nHe carried his grievance and a lump on his jaw to Mr. Commissioner\nSanders, who had arrived at the junction of the Isisi and the N'gomi\nrivers and was holding his palaver, and Sanders had been unsympathetic.\n\n\"Go worship your God in peace,\" said Sanders, \"and let all other men\nworship theirs; and say no evil word to white men for these are very\nquick to anger. Also it is unbecoming that a black man should speak\nscornfully to his masters.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bucongo, \"in heaven all men are as one, black or white.\"\n\n\"In heaven,\" said Sanders, \"we will settle that palaver, but here on the\nriver we hold our places by our merits. To-morrow I come to your village\nto inquire into certain practices of which the God-men know\nnothing--this palaver is finished.\"\n\nNow Bucongo was something more than a convert. He was a man of singular\nintelligence and of surprising originality. He had been a lay missioner\nof the Church, and had made many converts to a curious religion, the\nritual of which was only half revealed to the good Jesuit fathers when\nat a great palaver which Bucongo summoned to exhibit his converts, the\nChurch service was interspersed with the sacrifice of a goat and a weird\nprocession and dance which left the representative of The Order\nspeechless. Bucongo was called before a conference of the Mission and\nreprimanded.\n\nHe offered excuses, but there was sufficient evidence to prove that this\nenthusiastic Christian had gone systematically to work, to found what\namounted to a religion of his own.\n\nThe position was a little delicate, and any other Order than the Jesuits\nmight have hesitated to tackle a reform which meant losing a very large\nmembership.\n\nThe fate of Bucongo's congregation had been decided when, in his anger,\nhe took canoe, and travelling for half a day, came to the principal\nMission.\n\nFather Carpentier, full-bearded, red of face and brawny of arm, listened\nin the shade of his hut, pulling thoughtfully at a long pipe.\n\n\"And so, Pentini,\" concluded Bucongo, \"even Sandi puts shame upon me\nbecause I am a cross-God man, and he by all accounts is of the water-God\nju-ju.\"\n\nThe father eyed this perturbed sheep of his flock thoughtfully.\n\n\"O Bucongo,\" he said gently, \"in the river lands are many beasts. Those\nwhich fly and which swim; those that run swiftly and that hide in the\nearth. Now who of these is right?\"\n\n\"Lord, they are all right but are of different ways,\" said Bucongo.\n\nFather Carpentier nodded.\n\n\"Also in the forest are two ants--one who lives in tree nests, and one\nwho has a home deep in the ground. They are of a kind, and have the same\nbusiness. Yet God put it into the little heads of one to climb trees,\nand of the other to burrow deeply. Both are right and neither are wrong,\nsave when the tree ant meets the ground ant and fights him. Then both\nare wrong.\"\n\nThe squatting Bucongo rose sullenly.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, \"these mysteries are too much for a poor man. I think\nI know a better ju-ju, and to him I go.\"\n\n\"You have no long journey, Chief,\" said the father sternly, \"for they\ntell me stories of ghost dances in the forest and a certain Bucongo who\nis the leader of these--and of a human sacrifice. Also of converts who\nare branded with a cross of hot iron.\"\n\nThe chief looked at his sometime tutor with face twisted and puckered\nwith rage, and turning without a word, walked back to his canoe.\n\nThe next morning Father Carpentier sent a messenger to Sanders bearing\nan urgent letter, and Sanders read the closely written lines with a\ntroubled frown.\n\nHe put down the letter and came out on to the deck, to find Hamilton\nfishing over the side of the steamer. Hamilton looked round.\n\n\"Anything wrong?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"Bucongo of the Lesser Isisi is wrong,\" said Sanders. \"I have heard of\nhis religious meetings and have been a little worried--there will be a\nbig ju-ju palaver or I'm very much mistaken. Where is Bones?\"\n\n\"He has taken my sister up the creek--Bones says there are any number of\negrets' nests there, and I believe he is right.\"\n\nSanders frowned again.\n\n\"Send a canoe to fetch him back,\" he said. \"That is Bucongo's territory,\nand I don't trust the devil.\"\n\n\"Which one--Bones or Bucongo?\" asked Hamilton innocently.\n\nBut Sanders was not feeling humorous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that precise moment Bones was sitting before the most fantastic\nreligious assembly that ecclesiastic or layman had ever attended.\n\nFate and Bones had led the girl through a very pleasant forest\nglade--they left the light-draught _Wiggle_ half a mile down stream\nowing to the shoals which barred their progress, and had come upon\nBucongo in an exalted moment.\n\nWith the assurance that he was doing no more than intrude upon one of\nthose meetings which the missionizing Chief of the Lesser Isisi so\nfrequently held, Bones stood on the outer fringe of the circle which sat\nin silence to watch an unwilling novitiate getting acquainted with\nBucongo's god.\n\nThe novice was a girl, and she lay before an altar of stones surmounted\nby a misshapen _beti_ who glared with his one eye upon the devout\ngathering. The novice lay rigid, for the excellent reason that she was\nroped foot and hands to two pegs in the ground.\n\nBefore the altar itself was a fire of wood in which two irons were\nheating.\n\nBones did not take this in for a moment, for he was gazing open-mouthed\nat Bucongo. On his head was an indubitable mitre, but around the mitre\nwas bound a strip of skin from which was suspended a circle of dangling\nmonkey tails. For cope he wore a leopard's robe. His face was streaked\nred with camwood, and around his eyes he had painted two white circles.\n\nHe was in the midst of a frenzied address when the two white visitors\ncame upon the scene, and his hand was outstretched to take the red\nbranding-iron when the girl at Bones's side, with a little gasp of\nhorror, broke into the circle, and wrenching the rough iron from the\nattendant's hand, flung it towards the circle of spectators, which\nwidened in consequence.\n\n\"How dare you--how dare you!\" she demanded breathlessly, \"you\nhorrible-looking man!\"\n\nBucongo glared at her but said nothing; then he turned to meet Bones.\n\nIn that second of time Bucongo had to make a great decision, and to\novercome the habits of a lifetime. Training and education to the\ndominion of the white man half raised his hand to the salute; something\nthat boiled and bubbled madly and set his shallow brain afire, something\nthat was of his ancestry, wild, unreasoning, brutish, urged other\naction. Bones had his revolver half drawn when the knobbly end of the\nchief's killing-spear struck him between the eyes, and he went down on\nhis knees.\n\nThus it came about, that he found himself sitting before Bucongo, his\nfeet and hands tied with native grass, with the girl at his side in no\nbetter case.\n\nShe was very frightened, but this she did not show. She had the\ndisadvantage of being unable to understand the light flow of offensive\nbadinage which passed between her captor and Bones.\n\n\"O Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, \"you see me as a god--I have finished with\nall white men.\"\n\n\"Soon we shall finish with you, Bucongo,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I cannot die, Tibbetti,\" said the other with easy confidence, \"that is\nthe wonderful thing.\"\n\n\"Other men have said that,\" said Bones in the vernacular, \"and their\nwidows are wives again and have forgotten their widowhood.\"\n\n\"This is a new ju-ju, Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, a strange light in his\neyes. \"I am the greatest of all cross-God men, and it is revealed to me\nthat many shall follow me. Now you and the woman shall be the first of\nall white people to bear the mark of Bucongo the Blessed. And in the\ndays to be you shall bare your breasts and say, 'Bucongo the Wonderful\ndid this with his beautiful hands.'\"\n\nBones was in a cold sweat and his mouth was dry. He scarcely dare look\nat the girl by his side.\n\n\"What does he say?\" she asked in a low voice. Bones hesitated, and then\nhaltingly he stammered the translation of the threat.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"O Bucongo,\" said Bones, with a sudden inspiration, \"though you do evil,\nI will endure. But this you shall do and serve me. Brand me alone upon\nthe chest, and upon the back. For if we be branded separately we are\nbound to one another, and you see how ugly this woman is with her thin\nnose and her pale eyes; also she has long hair like the grass which the\nweaver birds use for their nests.\"\n\nHe spoke loudly, eagerly, and it seemed convincingly, for Bucongo was in\ndoubt. Truly the woman by all standards was very ugly. Her face was\nwhite and her lips thin. She was a narrow woman too, he thought, like\none underfed.\n\n\"This you shall do for me, Bucongo,\" urged Bones; \"for gods do not do\nevil things, and it would be bad to marry me to this ugly woman who has\nno hips and has an evil tongue.\"\n\nBucongo was undecided.\n\n\"A god may do no evil,\" he said; \"but I do not know the ways of white\nmen. If it be true, then I will mark you twice, Tibbetti, and you shall\nbe my man for ever; and the woman I will not touch.\"\n\n\"Cheer oh!\" said Bones.\n\n\"What are you saying--will he let us go?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I was sayin' what a jolly row there'll be,\" lied Bones; \"and he was\nsayin' that he couldn't think of hurtin' a charmin' lady like you. Shut\nyour eyes, dear old Miss Hamilton.\"\n\nShe shut them quickly, half fainting with terror, for Bucongo was coming\ntowards them, a blazing iron in his hand, a smile of simple benevolence\nupon his not unintelligent face.\n\n\"This shall come as a blessing to you, Tibbetti,\" he said almost\njovially.\n\nBones shut his teeth and waited.\n\nThe hot iron was scorching his silk shirt when a voice hailed the\nhigh-priest of the newest of cults.\n\n\"O Bucongo,\" it said.\n\nBucongo turned with a grimace of fear and cringed backward before the\nlevelled Colt of Mr. Commissioner Sanders.\n\n\"Tell me now,\" said Sanders in his even tone, \"can such a man as you\ndie? Think, Bucongo.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bucongo huskily, \"I think I can die.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Sanders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not until after dinner that night that the girl had recovered\nsufficiently to discuss her exciting morning.\n\n\"I think you were an awful brute,\" she addressed her unabashed brother.\n\"You were standing in the wood listening to and seeing everything, and\nnever came till the last minute.\"\n\n\"It was my fault,\" interrupted Sanders. \"I wanted to see how far the\ngentle Bucongo would go.\"\n\n\"Dooced thoughtless,\" murmured Bones under his breath, but audible.\n\nShe looked at him long and earnestly then turned again to her brother.\n\n\"There is one thing I want to know,\" she said. \"What was Bones saying\nwhen he talked to that horrible man? Do you know that Bones was\nscowling at me as though I was ... I hardly know how to express it. Was\nhe saying nice things?\"\n\nHamilton looked up at the awning, and cleared his throat.\n\n\"Play the game, dear old sir and brother-officer,\" croaked Bones.\n\n\"He said----\" began Hamilton.\n\n\"Live an' let live,\" pleaded Bones, all of a twitter. \"_Esprit de corps_\nan' discretion, jolly old captain.\"\n\nHamilton looked at his subordinate steadily.\n\n\"He asked to be branded twice in order that you might not be branded\nonce,\" he said quietly.\n\nThe girl stared at Bones, and her eyes were full of tears.\n\n\"Oh, Bones!\" she said, with a little catch in her voice, \"you ... you\nare a sportsman.\"\n\n\"Carry on,\" said Bones incoherently, and wept a little at the\nrealization of that magnificent moment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE MAKER OF STORMS\n\n\nEverybody knows that water drawn from rivers is very bad water, for the\nrivers are the Roads of the Dead, and in the middle of those nights when\nthe merest rind of a moon shows, and this slither of light and two\nwatchful stars form a triangle pointing to the earth, the spirits rise\nfrom their graves and walk, \"singing deadly songs,\" towards the lower\nstar which is the source of all rivers. If you should be--which God\nforbid--on one of those lonely island graveyards on such nights you will\nsee strange sights.\n\nThe broken cooking-pots which rest on the mounds and the rent linen\nwhich flutters from little sticks stuck about the graves, grow whole and\nnew again. The pots are red and hot as they come from the fire, and the\npitiful cloths take on the sheen of youth and fold themselves about\ninvisible forms. None may see the dead, though it is said that you may\nsee the babies.\n\nThese the wise men have watched playing at the water's edge, crowing and\nchuckling in the universal language of their kind, staggering groggily\nalong the shelving beach with outspread arms balancing their uncertain\nsteps. On such nights when M'sa beckons the dead world to the source of\nall rivers, the middle islands are crowded with babies--the dead babies\nof a thousand years. Their spirits come up from the unfathomed deeps of\nthe great river and call their mortality from graves.\n\n\"How may the waters of the river be acceptable?\" asks the shuddering\nN'gombi mother.\n\nTherefore the N'gombi gather their water from the skies in strange\ncisterns of wicker, lined with the leaf of a certain plant which is\nimpervious, and even carry their drinking supplies with them when they\nvisit the river itself.\n\nThere was a certain month in the year, which will be remembered by all\nwho attempted the crossing of the Kasai Forest to the south of the\nN'gombi country, when pools and rivulets suddenly dried--so suddenly,\nindeed, that even the crocodiles, who have an instinct for coming\ndrought, were left high and dry, in some cases miles from the nearest\nwater, and when the sun rose in a sky unflecked by cloud and gave place\nat nights to a sky so brilliant and so menacing in their fierce and\nfiery nearness that men went mad.\n\nToward the end of this month, when an exasperating full moon advertised\na continuance of the dry spell by its very whiteness, the Chief\nKoosoogolaba-Muchini, or, as he was called, Muchini, summoned a council\nof his elder men, and they came with parched throats and fear of death.\n\n\"All men know,\" said Muchini, \"what sorrow has come to us, for there is\na more powerful ju-ju in the land than I remember. He has made M'shimba\nM'shamba afraid so that he has gone away and walks no more in the forest\nwith his terrible lightning. Also K'li, the father of pools, has gone\ninto the earth and all his little children, and I think we shall die,\nevery one of us.\"\n\nThere was a skinny old man, with a frame like a dried goatskin, who made\na snuffling noise when he spoke.\n\n\"O Muchini,\" he said, \"when I was a young man there was a way to bring\nM'shimba M'shamba which was most wonderful. In those days we took a\nyoung maiden and hung her upon a tree----\"\n\n\"Those old ways were good,\" interrupted Muchini; \"but I tell you,\nM'bonia, that we can follow no more the old ways since Sandi came to the\nland, for he is a cruel man and hanged my own mother's brother for that\nfine way of yours. Yet we cannot sit and die because of certain magic\nwhich the Stone Breaker is practising.\"\n\nNow Bula Matadi (\"The Stone Breaker\") was in those days the mortal enemy\nof the N'gombi people, who were wont to ascribe all their misfortunes to\nhis machinations. To Bula Matadi (which was the generic name by which\nthe Government of the Congo Free State was known) was traceable the\nmalign perversity of game, the blight of crops, the depredations of\nweaver birds. Bula Matadi encouraged leopards to attack isolated\ntravellers, and would on great occasions change the seasons of the year\nthat the N'gombi's gardens might come to ruin.\n\n\"It is known from one end of the earth to the other that I am a most\ncunning man,\" Muchini went on, stroking his muscular arm, a trick of\nself-satisfied men in their moments of complacence; \"and whilst even the\nold men slept, I, Koosoogolaba-Muchini, the son of the terrible and\ncrafty G'sombo, the brother of Eleni-N'gombi, I went abroad with my wise\nmen and my spies and sought out devils and ghosts in places where even\nthe bravest have never been,\" he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper,\n\"to the Ewa-Ewa Mongo, the Very Place of Death.\"\n\nThe gasp of horror from his audience was very satisfying to this little\nchief of the Inner N'gombi, and here was a moment suitable for his\nclimax.\n\n\"And behold!\" he cried.\n\nBy his side was something covered with a piece of native cloth. This\ncovering he removed with a flourish and revealed a small yellow box.\n\nIt was most certainly no native manufacture, for its angles were clamped\nwith neat brass corner-pieces set flush in the polished wood.\n\nThe squatting councillors watched their lord as with easy familiarity he\nopened the lid.\n\nThere were twenty tiny compartments, and in each was a slender glass\ntube, corked and heavily sealed, whilst about the neck of each tube was\na small white label covered with certain devil marks.\n\nMuchini waited until the sensation he had prepared had had its full\neffect.\n\n\"By the Great River which runs to the Allamdani,\"[1] he said slowly and\nimpressively, \"were white men who had been sent by Bula Matadi to catch\nghosts. For I saw them, I and my wise men, when the moon was calling all\nspirits. They were gathered by the river with little nets and little\ngourds and they caught the waters. Also they caught little flies and\nother foolish things and took them to their tent. Then my young men and\nI waited, and when all were gone away we went to their tents and found\nhis magic box--which is full of devils of great power--Ro!\"\n\n[Footnote 1: This was evidently the Sanga River.]\n\nHe leapt to his feet, his eye gleaming. Across the starry dome of the\nsky there had flicked a quick flare of light.\n\nThere came a sudden uneasy stirring of leaves, a hushed whisper of\nthings as though the forest had been suddenly awakened from sleep.\n\nThen an icy cold breeze smote his cheek, and staring upward, he saw the\nwestern stars disappearing in swathes behind the tumbling clouds.\n\n\"M'shimba M'shamba--he lives!\" he roared, and the crash of thunder in\nthe forest answered him.\n\nBosambo, Chief of the Ochori, was on the furthermost edge of the forest,\nfor he was following the impulse of his simple nature and was hunting in\na country where he had no right to be. The storm (which he cursed,\nhaving no scruples about river and water, and being wholly sceptical as\nto ghosts) broke with all its fury over his camp and passed. Two nights\nlater, he sat before the rough hut his men had built, discussing the\nstrange ways of the antelope, when he suddenly stopped and listened,\nlowering his head till it almost touched the ground.\n\nClear to his keen ears came the rattle of the distant lokali--the drum\nthat sends messages from village to village and from nation to nation.\n\n\"O Secundi,\" said Bosambo, with a note of seriousness in his voice, \"I\nhave not heard that call for many moons--for it is the war call of the\nN'gombi.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is no war call,\" said the old man, shifting his feet for\ngreater comfort, \"yet it is a call which may mean war, for it calls\nspears to a dance, and it is strange, for the N'gombi have no enemies.\"\n\n\"All men are the enemies of the N'gombi,\" Bosambo quoted a river saying\nas old as the sun.\n\nHe listened again, then rose.\n\n\"You shall go back and gather me a village of spears, and bring them to\nthe borderland near the road that crosses the river,\" he said.\n\n\"On my life,\" said the other.\n\nMuchini, Chief of the Inner N'gombi, a most inflated man and a familiar\nof magical spirits, gathered his spears to some purpose, for two days\nlater Bosambo met him by his border and the chiefs greeted one another\nbetween two small armies.\n\n\"Which way do you go, Muchini?\" asked Bosambo.\n\nNow, between Muchini and the Chief of the Ochori was a grievance dating\nback to the big war, when Bosambo had slain the N'gombi chief of the\ntime with his own hands.\n\n\"I go to the river to call a palaver of all free men,\" said Muchini;\n\"for I tell you this, Bosambo, that I have found a great magic which\nwill make us greater than Sandi, and it has been prophesied that I shall\nbe a king over a thousand times a thousand spears. For I have a small\nbox which brings even M'shimba to my call.\"\n\nBosambo, a head and shoulders taller than the other, waved his hand\ntowards the forest path which leads eventually to the Ochori city.\n\n\"Here is a fine moment for you, Muchini,\" he said, \"and you shall try\nyour great magic on me and upon my young men. For I say that you do not\ngo by this way, neither you nor your warriors, since I am the servant of\nSandi and of his King, and he has sent me here to keep his peace; go\nback to your village, for this is the way to Death.\"\n\nMuchini glared at his enemy.\n\n\"Yet this way I go, Bosambo,\" he said huskily, and looked over his\nshoulder towards his followers.\n\nBosambo swung round on one heel, an arm and a leg outstretched in the\nattitude of an athlete who is putting the shot. Muchini threw up his\nwicker shield and pulled back his stabbing-spear, but he was a dead man\nbefore the weapon was poised.\n\nThus ended the war, and the N'gombi folk went home, never so much as\nstriking a blow for the yellow box which Bosambo claimed for himself as\nhis own personal loot.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., was blissfully ignorant\nof the miraculous happenings which have been recorded. He was wholly\npreoccupied by the novelty which the presence of Patricia Hamilton\noffered. Never before had a white woman made her home at the Residency,\nand it changed things a little.\n\nShe was at times an embarrassment.\n\nWhen Fubini, the witch-doctor of the Akasava, despatched five maidens to\nchange Sandi's wicked heart--Sanders had sent Fubini to the Village of\nIrons for six months for preaching unauthorized magic--they came, in the\nlanguage of Bones, \"doocedly undressed,\" and Patricia had beaten a\nhurried retreat.\n\nShe was sometimes an anxiety, as I have already shown, but was never a\nnuisance. She brought to headquarters an aroma of English spring, a\nclean fragrance that refreshed the heat-jaded Commissioner and her\nbrother, but which had no perceptible influence upon Bones.\n\nThat young officer called for her one hot morning, and Hamilton,\nsprawling on a big cane chair drawn to the shadiest and breeziest end of\nthe verandah, observed that Bones carried a wooden box, a drawing-board,\na pad of paper, two pencils imperfectly concealed behind his large ear,\nand a water-bottle.\n\n\"Shop!\" said Hamilton lazily. \"Forward, Mr. Bones--what can we do for\nyou this morning?\"\n\nBones shaded his eyes and peered into the cool corner.\n\n\"Talkin' in your sleep, dear old Commander,\" he said pleasantly,\n\"dreamin' of the dear old days beyond recall.\"\n\nHe struck an attitude and lifted his unmusical voice--\n\n     \"When life was gay, heigho!\n     Tum tum te tay, heigho!\n     Oh, tiddly umpty humpty umty do,\n     When life was gay--dear old officer--heigho!\"\n\nPatricia Hamilton stepped out to the verandah in alarm.\n\n\"Oh, please, don't make that hooting noise,\" she appealed to her\nbrother. \"I'm writing----\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said Hamilton, \"it was only Bones singing. Do it\nagain, Bones, Pat didn't hear you.\"\n\nBones stood erect, his hand to his white helmet.\n\n\"Come aboard, my lady,\" he said.\n\n\"I won't keep you a minute, Bones,\" said the girl, and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\n\"What are you doing this morning?\" asked Hamilton, gazing with\npardonable curiosity at the box and drawing-board.\n\n\"Polishin' up my military studies with Miss Hamilton's kind\nassistance--botany and applied science, sir,\" said Bones briskly. \"Field\nfortifications, judgin' distance, strategy, Bomongo grammar, field\ncookery an' tropical medicines.\"\n\n\"What has poor little making-up-company-accounts done?\" asked Hamilton,\nand Bones blushed.\n\n\"Dear old officer,\" he begged, \"I'll tackle that little job as soon as I\nget back. I tried to do 'em this mornin' an was four dollars out--it's\nthe regimental cash account that's wrong. People come in and out helpin'\nthemselves, and I positively can't keep track of the money.\"\n\n\"As I'm the only person with the key of the regimental cash-box, I\nsuppose you mean----?\"\n\nBones raised his hand.\n\n\"I make no accusations, dear old feller--it's a painful subject. We all\nhave those jolly old moments of temptation. I tackle the accounts\nto-night, sir. You mustn't forget that I've a temperament. I'm not like\nyou dear old wooden-heads----\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said the weary Hamilton. \"So long as you're going to do a\nbit of study, it's all right.\"\n\n\"Now, Bones,\" said Patricia, appearing on the scene, \"have you got the\nsandwiches?\"\n\nBones made terrifying and warning grimaces.\n\n\"Have you got the board to lay the cloth and the paper to cover it, and\nthe chocolates and the cold tea?\"\n\nBones frowned, and jerked his head in an agony of warning.\n\n\"Come on, then,\" said the unconscious betrayer of Lieutenant Tibbetts.\n\"Good-bye, dear.\"\n\n\"Why 'good-bye,' dear old Hamilton's sister?\" asked Bones.\n\nShe looked at him scornfully and led the way.\n\n\"Don't forget the field fortifications,\" called Hamilton after them;\n\"they eat nicely between slices of strategy.\"\n\nThe sun was casting long shadows eastward when they returned. They\nhad not far to come, for the place they had chosen for their picnic\nwas well within the Residency reservation, but Bones had been describing\non his way back one of the remarkable powers he possessed, namely, his\nability to drag the truth from reluctant and culpable natives. And every\ntime he desired to emphasize the point he would stop, lower all his\nimpedimenta to the ground, cluttering up the landscape with picnic-box,\ndrawing-board, sketching-blocks and the numerous bunches of wild\nflowers he had culled at her request, and press his argument with\nmuch palm-punching.\n\nHe stopped for the last time on the very edge of the barrack square, put\ndown his cargo and proceeded to demolish the doubt she had unwarily\nexpressed.\n\n\"That's where you've got an altogether erroneous view of me, dear old\nsister,\" he said triumphantly. \"I'm known up an' down the river as the\none man that you can't deceive. Go up and ask the Bomongo, drop in on\nthe Isisi, speak to the Akasava, an' what will they say? They'll say,\n'No, ma'am, there's no flies on jolly old Bones--not on your life,\nHarriet!'\"\n\n\"Then they would be very impertinent,\" smiled Pat.\n\n\"Ask Sanders (God bless him!). Ask Ham. Ask----\" he was going on\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"Are you going to camp here, or are you coming in?\" she challenged.\n\nBones gathered up his belongings, never ceasing to talk.\n\n\"Fellers like me, dear young friend, make the Empire--paint the whole\nbally thing red, white an' blue--'unhonoured an' unsung, until the\ncurtain's rung, the boys that made the Empire and the Navy.'\"\n\n\"Bones, you promised you wouldn't sing,\" she said reproachfully; \"and,\nbesides, you're not in the navy.\"\n\n\"That doesn't affect the argument,\" protested Bones, and was rapidly\nshedding his equipment in preparation for another discourse, when she\nwalked on towards Sanders who had come across the square to meet them.\n\nBones made a dive at the articles he had dropped, and came prancing (no\nother word describes his erratic run) up to Sanders.\n\n\"I've just been telling Miss Hamilton, sir and Excellency, that nobody\ncan find things that old Bones--you'll remember, sir, the episode of\nyour lost pyjama legs. Who found 'em?\"\n\n\"You did,\" said Sanders; \"they were sent home in your washing. Talking\nabout finding things, read this.\"\n\nHe handed a telegraph form to the young man, and Bones, peering into the\nmessage until his nose almost touched the paper, read--\n\n     \"Very urgent. Clear the line. Administration.\n\n     \"To Sanders, Commission River Territories. Message begins. Belgian\n     Congo Government reports from Leopoldville, Bacteriological\n     Expedition carriers raided on edge of your territory by Inner\n     N'gombi people, all stores looted including case of 20 culture\n     tubes. Stop. As all these cultures are of virulent diseases,\n     inoculate Inner N'gombi until intact tubes recovered. Message\n     ends.\"\n\nBones read it twice, and his face took on an appearance which indicated\nsomething between great pain and intense vacancy. It was intended to\nconvey to the observer the fact that Bones was thinking deeply and\nrapidly, and that he had banished from his mind all the frivolities of\nlife.\n\n\"I understand, sir--you wish me to go to the dear old Congo Government\nand apologize--I shall be ready in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"What I really want you to do,\" said Sanders patiently, \"is to take the\n_Wiggle_ up stream and get that box.\"\n\n\"I quite understand, sir,\" said Bones, nodding his head. \"To-day is the\n8th, to-morrow is the 9th--the box shall be in your hands on the 15th by\nhalf-past seven in the evening, dear old sir.\"\n\nHe saluted and turned a baleful glare upon the girl, the import of which\nshe was to learn at first hand.\n\n\"Duty, Miss Patricia Hamilton! Forgive poor old Bones if he suddenly\ndrops the mask of _dolce far niente_--I go!\"\n\nHe saluted again and went marching stiffly to his quarters, with all the\ndignity which an empty lunch-box and a dangling water-bottle would allow\nhim.\n\nThe next morning Bones went forth importantly for the Ochori city, being\nentrusted with the task of holding, so to speak, the right flank of the\nN'gombi country.\n\n\"You will use your discretion,\" Sanders said at parting, \"and, of\ncourse, you must keep your eyes open; if you hear the merest hint that\nthe box is in your neighbourhood, get it.\"\n\n\"I think, your Excellency,\" said Bones, with heavy carelessness, \"that\nI have fulfilled missions quite as delicate as this, and as for\nobservation, why, the gift runs in my family.\"\n\n\"And runs so fast that you've never caught up with it,\" growled\nHamilton.\n\nBones turned haughtily and saluted. It was a salute full of subdued\noffence.\n\nHe went joyously to the northward, evolving cunning plans. He stopped\nat every village to make inquiries and to put the unoffending villagers\nto considerable trouble--for he insisted upon a house-to-house\nsearch--before, somewhat wearied by his own zeal, he came to the Ochori.\n\nChief Bosambo heard of his coming and summoned his councillors.\n\n\"Truly has Sandi a hundred ears,\" he said in dismay, \"for it seems that\nhe has heard of the slaying of Muchini. Now, all men who are true to me\nwill swear to the lord Tibbetti that we know nothing of a killing\npalaver, and that we have not been beyond the trees to the land side of\nthe city. This you will all say because you love me; and if any man says\nanother thing I will beat him until he is sick.\"\n\nBones came and was greeted by the chief--and Bosambo was carried to the\nbeach on a litter.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo weakly, \"now the sight of your simple face will\nmake me a well man again. For, lord, I have not left my bed since the\ncoming of the rains, and there is strength neither in my hands and\nfeet.\"\n\n\"Poor old bird,\" said Bones sympathetically, \"you've been sittin' in a\ndraught.\"\n\n\"This I tell you, Tibbetti,\" Bosambo went on, as yet uncertain of his\nruler's attitude, since Bones must need, at this critical moment, employ\nEnglish and idiomatic English, \"that since the last moon was young I\nhave lain in my hut never moving, seeing nothing and hearing nothing,\nbeing like a dead man--all this my headman will testify.\"\n\nBones's face dropped, for he had hoped to secure information here.\nBosambo, watching his face through half-closed lids, saw the dismal\ndroop of the other's mouth, and came to the conclusion that whatever\nmight be the cause of the visit, it was not to hold the Ochori or their\nchief to account for known misdeeds.\n\n\"O Bosambo,\" said Bones, in the river dialect, \"this is sad news, for I\ndesire that you shall tell me certain things for which Sandi would have\ngiven you salt and rods.\"\n\nThe Chief of the Ochori sat up in his litter and went so far as to put\none foot to the ground.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he heartily, \"the sound of your lovely voice brings me from\nthe grave and gives me strength. Ask, O Bonesi, for you are my father\nand my mother; and though I saw and heard nothing, yet in my sickness I\nhad wonderful visions and all things were made visible--that I declare\nto you, Bonesi, before all men.\"\n\n\"Don't call me 'Bonesi,'\" said Bones fiercely. \"You're a jolly cheeky\nfeller, Bosambo--you're very, very naughty, indeed!\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo humbly, \"though I rule these Ochori I am a\nforeigner in this land; in the tongue of my own people, Bonesi means\n'he-who-is-noble-in-face-and-a-giver-of-justice.'\"\n\n\"That's better,\" nodded the gratified Bones, and went on speaking in the\ndialect. \"You shall help me in this--it touches the people of the Inner\nN'gombi----\"\n\nBosambo fell back wearily on to the litter, and rolled his eyes as one\nin pain.\n\n\"This is a sorrow for me, Bo--Tibbetti,\" he said faintly, \"but I am a\nsick man.\"\n\n\"Also,\" continued Bones, \"of a certain box of wood, full of poisons----\"\n\nAs well as he could Bones explained the peculiar properties of germ\nculture.\n\n\"Oh, ko!\" said Bosambo, closing his eyes, and was to all appearances\nbeyond human aid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, at parting, \"you have brought me to life, and\nevery man of every tribe shall know that you are a great healer. To all\nthe far and quiet places of the forest I will send my young men who will\ncry you aloud as a most wonderful doctor.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" murmured Bones modestly, \"not at all.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo, this time in English, for he was not to be\noutdone in the matter of languages, for had he not attended a great\nmission school in Monrovia? \"Master, you dam' fine feller, you look 'um\nbetter feller, you no find um. You be same like Moses and Judi Escariot,\nbig fine feller, by golly--yas.\"\n\nAll night long, between the visits which Bones had been making from the\nmoored _Wiggle_ to the village (feeling the patient's pulse with a\nprofound and professional air and prescribing brandy and milk), Bosambo\nhad been busy.\n\n\"Stand you at the door, Secundi,\" he said to his headman, \"and let one\nof your men go to the shore to warn me of my lord Tibbetti's coming, for\nI have work to do. It seems this Maker of Storms were better with Sandi\nthan with me.\"\n\n\"Tibbetti is a fool, I think,\" suggested Secundi.\n\nBosambo, kneeling on a rush mat, busy with a native chisel and a pot of\nclay paint, looked up.\n\n\"I have beaten older men than you with a stick until they have wept,\" he\nsaid, \"and all for less than you say. For this is the truth, Secundi,\nthat a child cannot be a fool, though an old man may be a shame. This is\nthe word of the blessed prophet. As for Tibbetti, he has a clean and\nloving heart.\"\n\nThere was a rustle at the door and a whispered voice.\n\nThe box and the tools were thrust under a skin rug and Bosambo again\nbecame the interesting invalid.\n\nIn the morning Bosambo had said farewell, and a blushing Bones listened\nwith unconcealed pleasure to the extravagant praise of his patient.\n\n\"And this I tell you, Tibbetti,\" said Bosambo, standing thigh-deep in\nthe river by the launch's side, \"that knowing you are wise man who\ngathers wisdom, I have sent to the end of my country for some rare and\nbeautiful thing that you may carry it with you.\"\n\nHe signalled to a man on the bank, and his servant brought him a curious\nobject.\n\nIt was, Bones noted, a square box apparently of native make, for it was\nfantastically carved and painted. There were crude heads and hideous\nforms which never were on land or sea. The paint was brilliant; red,\nyellow and green indiscriminately splashed.\n\n\"This is very ancient and was brought to my country by certain forest\npeople. It is a Maker of Storms, and is a powerful ju-ju for good and\nevil.\"\n\nBones, already a collector of native work, was delighted. His delight\nsoothed him for his failure in other respects.\n\nHe returned to headquarters empty-handed and sat the centre of a\nchilling group--if we except Patricia Hamilton--and endeavoured, as so\nmany successful advocates have done, to hide his short-comings behind a\nscreen of rhetoric.\n\nHe came to the part of his narrative where Bosambo was taken ill without\ncreating any notable sensation, save that Sanders's grey eyes narrowed\na little and he paid greater heed to the rest of the story.\n\n\"There was poor old Bosambo knocked out, sir--ab-so-lutely done\nfor--fortunately I did not lose my nerve. You know what I am, dear old\nofficer, in moments of crisis?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Hamilton grimly, \"something between a Welsh revivalist\nand a dancing dervish.\"\n\n\"Please go on, Bones,\" begged the girl, not the least interested of the\naudience.\n\n\"I dashed straight back to the _Wiggle_,\" said Bones breathlessly,\n\"searched for my medicine chest--it wasn't there! Not so much as a\nmustard plaster--what was I to do, dear old Miss Hamilton?\" he appealed\ndramatically.\n\n\"Don't tell him, Pat,\" begged Hamilton, \"he's sure to guess it.\"\n\n\"What was I to do? I seized a bottle of brandy,\" said Bones with relish,\n\"I dashed back to where Bosambo was lyin'. I dashed into the village,\ninto his hut and got a glass----\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Sanders impatiently, \"what happened after all this\ndashing?\"\n\nBones spread out his hands.\n\n\"Bosambo is alive to-day,\" he said simply, \"praisin'--if I may be\nallowed to boast--the name of Bones the Medicine Man. Look here, sir.\"\n\nHe dragged towards him along the floor of the hut a package covered with\na piece of native sacking. This he whisked away and revealed the\nhideous handiwork of an artist who had carved and painted as true to\nnature as a man may who is not quite certain whether the human eye is\nhalf-way down the nose or merely an appendage to his ear.\n\n\"That, sir,\" said Bones impressively, \"is one of the most interestin'\nspecimens of native work I have ever seen: a gift! From Bosambo to the\njolly old doctor man who dragged him, if I might so express it, from the\nvery maws of death.\"\n\nHe made his dramatic pause.\n\nSanders bent down, took a penknife from his pocket and scraped the paint\nfrom a flat oblong space on the top.\n\nThere for all men to see--save Bones who was now engaged in a relation\nof his further adventure to his one sympathizer--was a brass plate, and\nwhen the paint had been scraped away, an inscription--\n\n     Department du M\u00e9dicins, Etat CONGO BELGE.\n\nSanders and Hamilton gazed, fascinated and paralysed to silence.\n\n\"I've always had a feelin' I'd like to be a medicine man.\" Bones\nprattled on. \"You see----\"\n\n\"One moment, Bones,\" interrupted Sanders quietly. \"Did you open this box\nby any chance?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"And did you see any of its contents?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Bones confidentially, \"that's the most interestin' thing\nabout the box. It contains magic--which, of course, honoured sir and\nExcellency, is all rubbish.\"\n\nSanders took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and after a few trials\nopened the case and scrutinized the contents, noting the comforting fact\nthat all the tubes were sealed. He heaved a deep sigh of thankfulness.\n\n\"You didn't by chance discover anything about the missing cultures,\nBones?\" he asked mildly.\n\nBones shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and looked disconsolately\nat his chief.\n\n\"You think I've been feeble, but I haven't lost hope, sir,\" he said,\nwith fine resolution. \"I've got a feelin' that if I were allowed to go\ninto the forest, disguised, sir, as a sort of half-witted native chap,\nsir----\"\n\n\"Disguised!\" said Hamilton. \"Good Lord, what do you want a disguise\nfor?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBONES AND THE WIRELESS\n\n\nKo-boru, the headman of Bingini, called his relations together for a\nsolemn family conference.\n\nThe lower river folk play an inconsiderable r\u00f4le in the politics of the\nTerritories, partly because they are so near to headquarters that there\nis no opportunity for any of those secret preparations which precede all\nnative intrigues, great or small, and partly because the lower river\npeople are so far removed from the turbulent elements of the upper river\nthat they are not swayed by the cyclonic emotions of the Isisi, the cold\nand deliberate desire for slaughter which is characteristically\nAkasavian, or the electrical decisions of the Outer N'gombi.\n\nBut they had their crises.\n\nTo Bingini came all the notables of the district who claimed kinship\nwith Ko-boru, and they sat in a great circle about the headman's hut,\nalternately eyeing the old headman and their stout relative, his\ndaughter.\n\n\"All my relations shall know this,\" began Ko-boru, after Okmimi, the\nwitch-doctor, had formally burnt away the devils and ghosts that fringe\nall large assemblies, \"that a great shame has come to us, every one,\nbecause of Yoka-m'furi. For this Yoka is to Sandi as a brother, and\nguides his little ship up and down the river, and because of this\nsplendid position I gave him my own daughter by the first of my wives.\"\n\n\"S'm-m!\" murmured the council in agreement.\n\n\"Also I built him a hut and gave him a garden, where his wife might\nwork, and he has sat at family palavers. Now, I tell you that\nYoka-m'furi is an evil man, for he has left my daughter, and has found\nanother wife in the upper river, and he comes no more to this village,\nand my daughter weeps all day.\n\n\"For three seasons he has not been to this village; when the moon comes\nagain, it will be four.\" He said this with proper significance, and the\nflat face of the melancholy girl by his side puckered and creased\nmiserably before she opened her large mouth to wail her woe.\n\nFor the man who deliberately separates himself from his wife for\nfour seasons and does not spend twenty-four hours--\"from sunrise to\nmoonset\" in her village is automatically divorced and freed from all\nresponsibility. This is the custom of all people from the lands of\nthe Great King to the sea.\n\n\"Now, I have had a dream,\" Ko-boru went on, \"and in this dream it was\ntold me that I should call you all together, and that I and the chief of\nmy councillors and friends should go to Sandi and tell him what is\ntrue.\"\n\n\"Brother and uncle,\" said Bechimi of G'lara, \"I will go with you, for\nonce I spoke to Sandi and he spoke to me, and because of his cunning\nmemory he will recall Bechimi, who picked up his little black stick,\nwhen it fell, and gave it to him.\"\n\nFive were chosen to accompany Ko-boru, and they took canoe and travelled\nfor less than five miles to the Residency.\n\nSanders was entertaining Patricia Hamilton with stories of native feuds,\nwhen the unexpected deputation squatted in the sun before the verandah.\n\n\"O Ko-boru,\" hailed Sanders, \"why do you come?\"\n\nKo-boru was all for a long and impressive palaver, but recognized a\ncertain absence of encouragement in the Commissioner's tone. Therefore\nhe came straight to the point.\n\n\"Now, you are our father and our mother, Sandi,\" he said, in conclusion,\n\"and when you speak, all wonders happen. Also you have very beautiful\nfriends, Militini, who speak a word and set his terrible soldiers moving\nlike leopards towards a kill, and Tibbetti, the young one who is\ninnocent and simple. So I say to you, Sandi, that if you speak one word\nto Yoka, he will come back to my daughter, his wife.\"\n\nSanders stood by the rail of the stoep and looked down upon the\nspokesman.\n\n\"I hear strange things, Ko-boru,\" he said quietly. \"They tell me stories\nof a woman with many lovers and an evil tongue; and once there came to\nme Yoka with a wounded head, for this daughter of yours is very quick in\nher anger.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the flustered Ko-boru, \"such things happen even in love.\"\n\n\"All things happen in love,\" said Sanders, with a little smile, \"and, if\nit is to be, Yoka will return. Also, if it is to be, he will not go back\nto the woman, and she will be free. This palaver is finished.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" pleaded Ko-boru, \"the woman will do no more angry things. Let\nhim come back from sunrise to moonset----\"\n\n\"This palaver is finished,\" repeated Sanders.\n\nOn their way back to Bingini the relatives of Ko-boru made a plot. It\nwas the first plot that had been hatched in the shadow of headquarters\nfor twenty years.\n\n\"Would it be indiscreet to ask what your visitors wanted?\" asked the\ngirl, as the crestfallen deputation was crossing the square to their\ncanoe.\n\n\"It was a marriage palaver,\" replied Sanders, with a little grimace,\n\"and I was being requested to restore a husband to a temperamental lady\nwho has a passion for shying cook-pots at her husband when she is\nannoyed.\"\n\nThe girl's laughing eyes were fixed upon his.\n\n\"Poor Mr. Sanders!\" she said, with mock seriousness.\n\n\"Don't be sorry for me,\" smiled Sanders. \"I'm rather domestic, really,\nand I'm interested in this case because the man concerned is my\nsteersman--the best on the river, and a capital all-round man. Besides\nthat,\" he went on seriously, \"I regard them all as children of mine. It\nis right that a man who shirks his individual responsibilities to the\nrace should find a family to 'father.'\"\n\n\"Why do you?\" she asked, after a little pause.\n\n\"Why do I what?\"\n\n\"Shirk your responsibilities,\" she said. \"This is a healthy and a\ndelightful spot: a woman might be very happy here.\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've been awfully impertinent,\" said Patricia, hurriedly\nrising, \"but to a woman there is a note of interrogation behind every\nbachelor--especially nice bachelors--and the more 'confirmed' he is, the\nbigger the question mark.\"\n\nSanders rose to her.\n\n\"One of these days I shall do something rash,\" he threatened, with that\nshy laugh of his. \"Here is your little family coming.\"\n\nBones and Hamilton were discussing something heatedly, and justice was\non the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts, if one could judge by the frequency\nwith which he stopped and gesticulated.\n\n\"It really is too bad,\" said the annoyed Hamilton, as he mounted the\nsteps to the stoep, followed by Bones, who, to do him justice, did not\nadopt the attitude of a delinquent, but was, on the contrary, injured\nvirtue personified.\n\n\"What is too bad, dear?\" asked the girl sympathetically.\n\n\"A fortnight ago,\" said Hamilton, \"I told this silly ass----\"\n\n\"Your jolly old brother is referrin' to me, dear lady,\" explained Bones.\n\n\"Who else could I be referring to?\" demanded the other truculently. \"I\ntold him to have all the company accounts ready by to-morrow. You know,\nsir, that the paymaster is coming down from Administration to check 'em,\nand will you believe me, sir\"--he glared at Bones, who immediately\nclosed his eyes resignedly--\"would you believe me that, when I went to\nexamine those infernal accounts, they were all at sixes and sevens?\"\n\n\"Threes an' nines, dear old officer,\" murmured Bones, waking up, \"the\nmatter in dispute being a trifle of thirty-nine dollars, which I've\ngenerously offered to make up out of my own pocket.\"\n\nHe beamed round as one who expected applause.\n\n\"And on the top of this,\" fumed Hamilton, \"he talks of taking Pat for an\nearly morning picnic to the village island!\"\n\n\"Accompanied by the jolly old accounts,\" corrected Bones. \"Do me\njustice, sir and brother-officer. I offered to take the books with me,\nan' render a lucid and convincin' account of my stewardship.\"\n\n\"Don't make me laugh,\" snarled Hamilton, stamping into the bungalow.\n\n\"Isn't he naughty?\" said Bones admiringly.\n\n\"Now, Bones,\" warned the girl, \"I shan't go unless you keep your word\nwith Alec.\"\n\nBones drew himself up and saluted.\n\n\"Dear old friend,\" he said proudly, \"put your faith in Bones.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"H.M. Launch No. 36 (Territories),\" as it was officially described on\nthe stores record, had another name, which she earned in her early days\nthrough certain eccentricities of construction. Though she might not in\njustice be called the _Wiggle_ any longer, yet the _Wiggle_ she was from\none end of the river to the other, and even native men called her\n\"Komfuru,\" which means \"that which does not run straight.\"\n\nIt had come to be recognized that the _Wiggle_ was the especial charge\nof Lieutenant Tibbetts. Bones himself was the first to recognize this\nright. There were moments when he inferred that the _Wiggle's_ arrival\non the station at the time he was making his own first appearance was\nsomething more than a coincidence.\n\nShe was not, in the strictest sense of the word, a launch, for she\npossessed a square, open dining saloon and two tiny cabins amidships.\nHer internal works were open to the light of day, and her engineer\nlived in the engine-room up to his waist and on deck from his waist up,\nthus demonstrating the possibility of being in two places at once.\n\nThe _Wiggle_, moreover, possessed many attributes which are denied to\nother small steamers. She had, for example, a Maxim gun on her tiny\nforecastle. She had a siren of unusual power and diabolical tone, she\nwas also fitted with a big motor-horn, both of which appendages were\nBones's gift to his flagship. The motor-horn may seem superfluous, but\nwhen the matter is properly explained, you will understand the necessity\nfor some less drastic method of self-advertisement than the siren.\n\nThe first time the siren had been fitted Bones had taken the _Wiggle_\nthrough \"the Channel.\" Here the river narrows and deepens, and the\ncurrent runs at anything from five to seven knots an hour. Bones was\ngoing up stream, and met the Bolalo Mission steamer coming down. She had\ndipped her flag to the _Wiggle's_ blue ensign, and Bones had replied\nwith two terrific blasts on his siren.\n\nAfter that the _Wiggle_ went backwards, floating with the current all\nways, from broadside on to stern first, for in those two blasts Bones\nhad exhausted the whole of his steam reserve.\n\nShe was also equipped with wireless. There was an \"aerial\" and an\napparatus which Bones had imported from England at a cost of twelve\npounds, and which was warranted to receive messages from two hundred\nmiles distant. There was also a book of instructions. Bones went to his\nhut with the book and read it. His servant found him in bed the next\nmorning, sleeping like a child, with his hand resting lightly upon the\nsecond page.\n\nSanders and Hamilton both took a hand at fixing the _Wiggle's_ wireless.\nThe only thing they were all quite certain about was that there ought to\nbe a wire somewhere. So they stretched the aerial from the funnel to the\nflagstaff at the stern of the boat, and then addressed themselves to the\nless simple solution of \"making it work.\"\n\nThey tried it for a week, and gave it up in despair.\n\n\"They've had you, Bones,\" said Hamilton. \"It doesn't 'went.' Poor old\nBones!\"\n\n\"Your pity, dear old officer, is offensive,\" said Bones stiffly, \"an' I\ndon't mind tellin' you that I've a queer feelin'--I can't explain what\nit is, except that I'm a dooce of a psychic--that that machine is goin'\nto be jolly useful.\"\n\nBut though Bones worked day and night, read the book of instructions\nfrom cover to cover, and took the whole apparatus to pieces, examining\neach part under a strong magnifying glass, he never succeeded either in\ntransmitting or receiving a message, and the machine was repacked and\nstored in the spare cabin, and was never by any chance referred to,\nexcept by Hamilton in his most unpleasant moments.\n\nBones took an especial delight in the _Wiggle_; it was his very own\nship, and he gave her his best personal attention.\n\nIt was Bones who ordered from London especially engraved notepaper\nheaded \"H. M. S. _Komfuru_\"--the native name sounded more dignified than\n_Wiggle_, and more important than \"Launch 36.\" It was Bones who\ninstalled the little dynamo which--when it worked--lit the cabins and\neven supplied power for a miniature searchlight. It was Bones who had\nher painted Service grey, and would have added another funnel if\nHamilton had not detected the attempted aggrandizement. Bones claimed\nthat she was dustproof, waterproof, and torpedo-proof, and Hamilton had\nvoiced his regret that she was not also fool-proof.\n\nAt five o'clock the next morning, when the world was all big hot stars\nand shadows, and there was no sound but the whisper of the running river\nand the \"ha-a-a-a--ha-a-a-a\" of breakers, Bones came from his hut,\ncrossed the parade-ground, and, making his way by the light of a lantern\nalong the concrete quay--it was the width of an average table--dropped\non to the deck and kicked the custodian of the _Wiggle_ to wakefulness.\n\nBones's satellite was one Ali Abid, who was variously described as Moor,\nEgyptian, Tripolitan, and Bedouin, but was by all ethnological\nindications a half-breed Kano, who had spent the greater part of his\nlife in the service of a professor of bacteriology. This professor was\nsomething of a purist, and the association with Ali Abid, plus a\ngrounding in the elementary subjects which are taught at St. Joseph's\nMission School, Cape Coast Castle, had given Ali a gravity of demeanour\nand a splendour of vocabulary which many better favoured than he might\nhave envied.\n\n\"Arise,\" quoth Bones, in the cracked bass which he employed whenever he\nfelt called upon to deliver his inaccurate versions of Oriental poets--\n\n     \"Arise, for morning in the bowl of night\n     Has chucked a stone to put the stars to flight.\n     And lo! and lo!... Get up, Ali; the caravan is moving.\n     Oh, make haste!\"\n\n(\"Omar will never be dead so long as Bones quotes him,\" Hamilton once\nsaid; \"he simply couldn't afford to be dead and leave it to Bones!\")\n\nAli rose, blinking and shivering, for the early morning was very cold,\nand he had been sleeping under an old padded dressing-gown which Bones\nhad donated.\n\n\"Muster all the hands,\" said Bones, setting his lantern on the deck.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali slowly, \"the subjects are not at our disposition. Your\npreliminary instructions presupposed that you had made necessary\narrangements _re personnel_.\"\n\nBones scratched his head.\n\n\"Dash my whiskers,\" he said, in his annoyance, \"didn't I tell you that I\nwas taking the honourable lady for a trip? Didn't I tell you, you jolly\nold slacker, to have everything ready by daybreak? Didn't I issue\nexplicit an' particular instructions about grub?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"you didn't.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Bones wrathfully, \"why the dickens do I think I have?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"some subjects, when enjoying refreshing coma, possess\ndelirium, hallucinations, highly imaginative, which dissipate when the\nsubject recovers consciousness, but retain in brain cavity illusory\nreminiscences.\"\n\nBones thrust his face into the other's.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me I dreamt it?\" he hissed.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"self-preservation compels complete acquiescence in\nyour diagnosis.\"\n\n\"You're childish,\" said Bones.\n\nHe gave a few vague instructions in the best Bones manner, and stole up\nto the dark Residency. He had solemnly promised Sanders that he would\nrouse the girl without waking up the rest of the house.\n\nThey were to go up stream to the Village Island, where the ironworkers\nof the Akasava had many curious implements to show her. Breakfast was\nto be taken on the boat, and they were to return for tiffin.\n\nOvernight she had shown Bones the window of her room, and Hamilton had\noffered to make a chalk mark on the sash, so there could be no mistaking\nthe situation of the room.\n\n\"If you wake me before sunrise, I shall do something I shall be sorry\nfor,\" he warned Bones. \"If you return without straightening the\naccounts, I shall do something which _you_ will be sorry for.\"\n\nBones remembered this as he crept stealthily along the wooden verandah.\nTo make doubly sure, he took off his boots and dropped them with a\ncrash.\n\n\"Sh!\" said Bones loudly. \"Sh, Bones! Not so much noise, you silly old\nass!\"\n\nHe crept softly along the wooden wall and reconnoitred. The middle\nwindow was Hamilton's room, the left was Sanders's, the right was\nPatricia's. He went carefully to the right window and knocked. There was\nno answer. He knocked again. Still no reply. He knocked loudly.\n\n\"Is that you, Bones?\" growled Sanders's voice.\n\nBones gasped.\n\n\"Awfully sorry, sir,\" he whispered agitatedly--\"my mistake entirely.\"\n\nHe tiptoed to the left window and rapped smartly. Then he whistled, then\nhe rapped again.\n\nHe heard a bed creak, and turned his head modestly away.\n\n\"It's Bones, dear old sister,\" he said, in his loudest whisper. \"Arise,\nfor mornin' in the bowl of light has----\"\n\nHamilton's voice raged at him.\n\n\"I knew it was you, you blithering----\"\n\n\"Dear old officer,\" began Bones, \"awfully sorry! Go to sleep again.\nNight-night!\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said a muffled voice.\n\nBones, however, went to the middle window; here he could make no\nmistake. He knocked authoritatively.\n\n\"Hurry up, ma'am,\" he said; \"time is on the wing----\"\n\nThe sash was flung up, and again Bones confronted the furious Hamilton.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the exasperated Bones, \"how the dooce did you get here?\"\n\n\"Don't you know this room has two windows? I told you last night, you\ngoop! Pat sleeps at the other end of the building. I told you that, too,\nbut you've got a brain like wool!\"\n\n\"I am obliged to you, sir,\" said Bones, on his dignity, \"for the\ninformation. I will not detain you.\"\n\nHamilton groped on his dressing-table for a hair-brush.\n\n\"Go back to bed, sir,\" said Bones, \"an' don't forget to say your\nprayers.\"\n\nHe was searching for the window in the other wing of the Residency,\nwhen the girl, who had been up and dressed for a quarter of an hour,\ncame softly behind him and tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Wow!\" screeched Bones. \"Oh, Lord, dear old sister, you gave me the\ndickens of a fright! Well, let's get along. Thank heavens, we haven't\ndisturbed anybody.\"\n\nHe was followed to the boat with the imprecations of two pyjamaed\nfigures that stood on the stoep and watched his lank body melt in the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Send us a wireless when you're coming back!\" roared Hamilton.\n\n\"Cad!\" said Bones, between his teeth.\n\nAli Abid had not been idle. He had aroused Yoka, the steersman, and\nBoosoobi, the engineer, and these two men had accepted the unexpected\ncall with the curious readiness which natives show on such occasions,\nand which suggests that they have pre-knowledge of the summons, and are\nonly waiting the word.\n\nIn one of the small cabins Ali had arranged the much-discussed company\naccounts ready for his lord's attention, and there was every promise of\na happy and a profitable day when Yoka rang the engines \"ahead,\" and the\n_Wiggle_ jerked her way to midstream.\n\nThe east had grown pale, there was a murmur from the dark forests on\neither bank, the timorous chirping or bad-tempered squawk of a bird, a\nfaint fragrance of burning gumwood from the fishing villages\nestablished on the river bank, where, in dancing spots of light, the\nwomen were tending their fires.\n\nThere is no intermediate stage on the big river between darkness and\nbroad daylight. The stars go out all at once, and the inky sky which\nserves then becomes a delicate blue. The shadows melt deeper and deeper\ninto the forest, clearly revealing the outlines of the straight-stemmed\ntrees. There is just this interregnum of pearl greyness, a sort of\nhush-light, which lasts whilst a man counts twenty, before the silver\nlances of the sun are flashing through the leaves, and the grey veil\nwhich blurs the islands to shapeless blotches in a river of dull silver\nis burnt to nothingness, and the islands are living things of vivid\ngreen set in waters of gold.\n\n\"The sunrise!\" said Bones, and waved his hand to the east with the air\nof one who was responsible for the miracle.\n\nThe girl sat in a deep wicker chair and breathed in the glory and the\nfreshness of the scene. Across the broad river, right ahead of the boat,\na flock of parroquets was flying, screeching their raucous chorus. The\nsun caught their brilliant plumage, and she saw, as it seemed, a rainbow\nin flight.\n\n\"Isn't that wonderful?\" she whispered.\n\nBones peered up at the birds, shading his eyes.\n\n\"Just like a jolly old patchwork quilt,\" he said. \"What a pity they\ncan't talk till you teach 'em! They're awful bad eatin', too, though\nsome fellers say they make a good curry----\"\n\n\"Oh, look, look!\"\n\nThe _Wiggle_ was swerving to the southern bank of the river, and two\nmajestic flamingos standing at the water's edge had arrested the girl's\nattention.\n\n\"_They're_ bad eatin', too,\" said the informative Bones. \"The flesh is\nfishy an' too fat; heron are just the same.\"\n\n\"Haven't you a soul, Bones?\" she asked severely.\n\n\"A soul, dear ma'am?\" Bones asked, in astonishment. \"Why, that's my\nspecialty!\"\n\nIt was a delightful morning for the girl, for Bones had retired to his\ncabin at her earnest request, and was struggling with the company\naccounts, and she was left to enjoy the splendour of the day, to watch\nthe iron-red waters piling up against the _Wiggle's_ bows, to feel the\ncool breezes that swept down from the far-away mountains, and all this\nwithout being under the necessity of making conversation with Bones.\n\nThat gentleman had a no less profitable morning, for Ali Abid was a\nmethodical and clerkly man, and unearthed the missing thirty-nine\ndollars in the Compensation Record.\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" said Bones, relieved. \"You're a jolly old accountant,\nAli. I'd never have found it.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"some subjects, by impetuous application, omit vision\nof intricate detail. This is due to subjects' lack of concentration.\"\n\n\"Have it your way,\" said Bones, \"but get the statement out for me to\ncopy.\"\n\nHe awoke the girl from a profound reverie--which centred about shy and\nsolemn bachelors who adopted whole nations of murderous children as\ntheir own--and proceeded to \"take charge.\"\n\nThis implied the noisy issuing of orders which nobody carried out, the\nmanipulation of a telescope, anxious glances at the heavens, deep and\npenetrating scrutinies of the water, and a promenade back and forward\nfrom one side of the launch to the other. Bones called this \"pacing the\nbridge,\" and invariably carried his telescope tucked under his arm in\nthe process, and, as he had to step over Pat's feet every time, and\nsometimes didn't, she arrested his nautical wanderings.\n\n\"You make me dizzy,\" she said. \"And isn't that the island?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the early hours of the afternoon they re-embarked, the _capita_ of\nthe village coming to the beach to see them off.\n\nThey brought back with them a collection of spear-heads, gruesome\nexecution knives, elephant swords, and wonder-working steel figures.\n\n\"And the lunch was simply lovely, Bones,\" agreed the girl, as the\n_Wiggle_ turned her nose homeward. \"Really, you can be quite clever\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"Dear old Miss Hamilton,\" said Bones, \"you saw me to-day as I really am.\nThe mask was off, and the real Bones, kindly, thoughtful, considerate,\nan'--if I may use the word without your foundin' any great hope upon\nit--tender. You saw me free from carkin' care, alert----\"\n\n\"Go along and finish your accounts, like a good boy,\" she said. \"I'm\ngoing to doze.\"\n\nDoze she did, for it was a warm, dozy afternoon, and the boat was\nrunning swiftly and smoothly with the tide. Bones yawned and wrote,\ncopying Ali's elaborate and accurate statement, whilst Ali himself slept\ncontentedly on the top of the cabin. Even the engineer dozed at his\npost, and only one man was wide awake and watchful--Yoka, whose hands\nturned the wheel mechanically, whose dark eyes never left the river\nahead, with its shoals, its sandbanks, and its snags, known and unknown.\n\nTwo miles from headquarters, where the river broadens before it makes\nits sweep to the sea, there are three islands with narrow passages\nbetween. At this season only one such passage--the centre of all--is\nsafe. This is known as \"The Passage of the Tree,\" because all boats,\neven the _Zaire_, must pass so close beneath the overhanging boughs of a\ngreat lime that the boughs brush their very funnels. Fortunately, the\ncurrent is never strong here, for the passage is a shallow one. Yoka\nfelt the boat slowing as he reached shoal water, and brought her nearer\nto the bank of the island. He had reached the great tree, when a noose\ndropped over him, tightened about his arms, and, before he could do more\nthan lock the wheel, he was jerked from the boat and left swinging\nbetween bough and water.\n\n\"O Yoka,\" chuckled a voice from the bough, \"between sunrise and moonset\nis no long time for a man to be with his wife!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBones had finished his account, and was thinking. He thought with his\nhead on his hands, with his eyes shut, and his mouth open, and his\nthought was accompanied by strange guttural noises.\n\nPatricia Hamilton was also thinking, but much more gracefully. Boosoobi\nsat by his furnace door, nodding. Sometimes he looked at the steam\ngauge, sometimes he kicked open the furnace door and chucked in a few\nbillets of wood, but, in the main, he was listening to the soothing\n\"chook-a-chook, chook-a-chook\" of his well-oiled engines.\n\n\"Woo-yow!\" yawned Bones, stretched himself, and came blinking into the\nsunlight. The sun was nearly setting.\n\n\"What the dooce----\" said Bones. He stared round.\n\nThe _Wiggle_ had run out from the mouth of the river and was at sea.\nThere was no sign of land of any description. The low-lying shores of\nthe territory had long since gone under the horizon.\n\nBones laid his hand on the shoulder of the sleeping girl, and she woke\nwith a start.\n\n\"Dear old shipmate,\" he said, and his voice trembled, \"we're alone on\nthis jolly old ocean! Lost the steersman!\"\n\nShe realized the seriousness of the situation in a moment.\n\nThe dozing engineer, now wide awake, came aft at Bones's call, and\naccepted the disappearance of the steersman without astonishment.\n\n\"We'll have to go back,\" said Bones, as he swung the wheel round. \"I\ndon't think I'm wrong in sayin' that the east is opposite to the west,\nan', if that's true, we ought to be home in time for dinner.\"\n\n\"Sar,\" said Boosoobi, who, being a coast boy, elected to speak English,\n\"dem wood she no lib.\"\n\n\"Hey?\" gasped Bones, turning pale.\n\n\"Dem wood she be done. I look um. I see um. I no find um.\"\n\nBones sat down heavily on the rail.\n\n\"What does he say?\" Pat asked anxiously.\n\n\"He says there's no more wood,\" said Bones. \"The horrid old bunkers are\nempty, an' we're at the mercy of the tempest.\"\n\n\"Oh, Bones!\" she cried, in consternation.\n\nBut Bones had recovered.\n\n\"What about swimmin' to shore with a line?\" he said. \"It can't be more\nthan ten miles!\"\n\nIt was Ali Abid who prevented the drastic step.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"the subject on such occasions should act with\ndeliberate reserve. Proximity of land presupposes research. The subject\nshould assist rather than retard research by passivity of action, easy\nrespiration, and general normality of temperature.\"\n\n\"Which means, dear old Miss Hamilton, that you've got to keep your wool\non,\" explained Bones.\n\nWhat might have happened is not to be recorded, for at that precise\nmoment the s.s. _Paretta_ came barging up over the horizon.\n\nThere was still steam in the _Wiggle's_ little boiler, and one log of\nwood to keep it at pressure.\n\nBones was incoherent, but again Ali came to the rescue.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"for intimating SOS-ness there is upon steamer or launch\ncertain scientific apparatus, unadjusted, but susceptible to treatment.\"\n\n\"The wireless!\" spluttered Bones. \"Good lor', the wireless!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later the _Wiggle_ ran alongside the gangway of the s.s.\n_Paretta_, anticipating the arrival of the _Zaire_ by half an hour.\n\nThe s.s. _Paretta_ was at anchor when Sanders brought the _Zaire_ to the\nscene.\n\nHe saw the _Wiggle_ riding serenely by the side of the great ship,\nlooking for all the world like a humming bird under the wings of an\nostrich, and uttered a little prayer of thankfulness.\n\n\"They're safe,\" he said to Hamilton. \"O Yoka, take the _Zaire_ to the\nother side of the big boat.\"\n\n\"Master, do we go back to-night to seek Ko-boru?\" asked Yoka, who was\nbearing marks which indicated his strenuous experience, for he had\nfought his way clear of his captors, and had swum with the stream to\nheadquarters.\n\n\"To-morrow is also a day,\" quoth Sanders.\n\nHamilton was first on the deck of the s.s. _Paretta_, and found his\nsister and a debonair and complacent Bones waiting for him. With them\nwas an officer whom Hamilton recognized.\n\n\"Company accounts all correct, sir,\" said Bones, \"audited by the jolly\nold paymaster\"--he saluted the other officer--\"an' found correct, sir,\nthus anticipatin' all your morose an' savage criticisms.\"\n\nHamilton gripped his hand and grinned.\n\n\"Bones was really wonderful,\" said the girl, \"they wouldn't have seen us\nif it hadn't been for his idea.\"\n\n\"Saved by wireless, sir,\" said Bones nonchalantly. \"It was a mere\nnothin'--just a flash of inspiration.\"\n\n\"You got the wireless to work?\" asked Hamilton incredulously.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Bones. \"But I wanted a little extra steam to get up to\nthe ship, so I burnt the dashed thing. I knew it would come in handy\nsooner or later.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE REMEDY\n\n\nBeyond the far hills, which no man of the Ochori passed, was a range of\nblue mountains, and behind this again was the L'Mandi country. This\nadventurous hunting men of the Ochori had seen, standing in a safe place\non the edge of the Great King's country. Also N'gombi people, who are\nnotoriously disrespectful of all ghosts save their own, had, upon a\ntime, penetrated the northern forest to a high knoll which Nature had\nshaped to the resemblance of a hayrick.\n\nA huntsman climbing this after his lawful quarry might gain a nearer\nview of the blue mountains, all streaked with silver at certain periods\nof the year, when a hundred streams came leaping with feathery feet from\ncrag to crag to strengthen the forces of the upper river, or, as some\nsaid, to create through underground channels the big lakes M'soobo and\nT'sambi at the back of the N'gombi country.\n\nAnd on summer nights, when the big yellow moon came up and showed all\nthings in her own chaste way, you might see from the knoll of the\nhayrick these silver ribbons all a-glitter, though the bulk of the\nmountain was lost to sight.\n\nThe river folk saw little of the L'Mandi, because L'Mandi territory lies\nbehind the country of the Great King, who looked with a jealous eye upon\ncomings and goings in his land, and severely restricted the movement and\nthe communications of his own people.\n\nThe Great King followed his uncle in the government of the pleasant\nO'Mongo lands, and he had certain advantages and privileges, the\nsignificance of which he very imperfectly interpreted.\n\nHis uncle had died suddenly at the hands of Mr. Commissioner Sanders,\nC.M.G., and the land itself might have passed to the protection of the\nCrown, for there was gold in the country in large and payable\nquantities.\n\nThat such a movement was arrested was due largely to the L'Mandi and the\ninfluence they were able to exercise upon the European Powers by virtue\nof their military qualities. Downing Street was all for a permanent\noccupation of the chief city and the institution of a conventional\n_r\u00e9gime_; but the L'Mandi snarled, clicked their heels, and made\njingling noises with their great swords, and there was at that moment a\nGovernment in office in England which was rather impressed by\nheel-clicking and sword-jingling, and so the territory of the Great King\nwas left intact, and was marked on all maps as Omongoland, and coloured\nred, as being within the sphere of British influence. On the other hand,\nthe L'Mandi people had it tinted yellow, and described it as an integral\nportion of the German Colonial Empire.\n\nThere was little communication between L'Mandi and Sanders's territory,\nbut that little was more than enough for the Commissioner, since it took\nthe shape of evangelical incursions carried out by missionaries who were\nin the happy position of not being obliged to say as much as \"By your\nleave,\" since they had secured from a Government which was, as I say,\nimpressed by heel-clicking and sword-jingling, an impressive document,\ncharging \"all commissioners, sub-commissioners, magistrates, and\nofficers commanding our native forces,\" to give facilities to these good\nChristian gentlemen.\n\nThere were missionaries in the Territories who looked askance at their\nbrethren, and Ferguson, of the River Mission, made a journey to\nheadquarters to lay his views upon the subject before the Commissioner.\n\n\"These fellows aren't missionaries at all, Mr. Sanders; they are just\npolitical agents utilizing sacred symbols to further a political\npropaganda.\"\n\n\"That is a Government palaver,\" smiled Sanders, and that was all the\nsatisfaction Ferguson received. Nevertheless, Sanders was watchful, for\nthere were times when the L'Mandi missioners and their friends strayed\noutside their sphere.\n\nOnce the L'Mandi folk had landed in a village in the middle Ochori, had\nflogged the headman, and made themselves free of the commodities which\nthe people of the village had put aside for the payment of their\ntaxation.\n\nIn his wrath, Bosambo, the chief, had taken ten war canoes; but Sanders,\nwho had been in the Akasava on a shooting trip, was there before him,\nand had meted out swift justice to the evil-doers.\n\n\"And let me tell you, Bosambo,\" said Sanders severely, \"that you shall\nnot bring spears except at my word.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, frankness itself, \"if I disobeyed you, it was\nbecause I was too hot to think.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"That I know,\" he said. \"Now I tell you this, Bosambo, and this is the\nway of very wise men--that when they go to do evil things with a hot\nheart, they first sleep, and in their sleep their spirits go free and\ntalk with the wise and the dead, and when they wake, their hearts are\ncool, and they see all the folly of the night, and their eyes are bright\nfor their own faults.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo, \"you are my father and my mother, and all the\npeople of the river you carry in your arms. Now I say to you that when I\ngo to do an evil thing I will first sleep, and I will make all my people\nsleep also.\"\n\nThere are strange stories in circulation as to the manner in which\nBosambo carried out this novel reform. There is the story of an Ochori\nwife-beater who, adjured by his chief, retired to slumber on his\ngrievance, and came to his master the following morning with the\ninformation that he had not closed his eyes. Whereupon Bosambo clubbed\nhim insensible, in order that Sanders's plan might have a fair chance.\n\nAt least, this is the story which Hamilton retailed at breakfast one\nmorning. Sanders, appealed to for confirmation, admitted cautiously that\nhe had heard the legend, but did not trouble to make an investigation.\n\n\"The art of governing a native country,\" he said, \"is the art of not\nasking questions.\"\n\n\"But suppose you want to know something?\" demanded Patricia.\n\n\"Then,\" said Sanders, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"you must pretend that\nyou know.\"\n\n\"What is there to do to-day?\" asked Hamilton, rolling his serviette.\n\nHe addressed himself to Lieutenant Tibbetts, who, to Sanders's intense\nannoyance, invariably made elaborate notes of all the Commissioner said.\n\n\"Nothin' until this afternoon, sir,\" said Bones, closing his notebook\nbriskly, \"then we're doin' a little deep-sea fishin'.\"\n\nThe girl made a grimace.\n\n\"We didn't catch anything yesterday, Bones,\" she objected.\n\n\"We used the wrong kind of worm,\" said Bones confidently. \"I've found a\nnew worm nest in the plantation. Jolly little fellers they are, too.\"\n\n\"What are we doing to-day, Bones?\" repeated Hamilton ominously.\n\nBones puckered his brows.\n\n\"Deep-sea fishin', dear old officer and comrade,\" he repeated, \"an'\nafter dinner a little game of tiddly-winks--Bones _v._ jolly old\nHamilton's sister, for the championship of the River an' the Sanders\nCup.\"\n\nHamilton breathed deeply, but was patient.\n\n\"Your King and your country,\" he said, \"pay you seven and eightpence per\ndiem----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Bones, a light dawning, \"you mean _work_?\"\n\n\"Strange, is it not,\" mused Hamilton, \"that we should\nconsider----Hullo!\"\n\nThey followed the direction of his eyes.\n\nA white bird was circling groggily above the plantation, as though\nuncertain where to alight. There was weariness in the beat of its wings,\nin the irregularity of its flight. Bones leapt over the rail of the\nverandah and ran towards the square. He slowed down as he came to a\nplace beneath the bird, and whistled softly.\n\nBones's whistle was a thing of remarkable sweetness--it was his one\naccomplishment, according to Hamilton, and had neither tune nor rhyme.\nIt was a succession of trills, rising and falling, and presently, after\ntwo hesitating swoops, the bird rested on his outstretched hand. He came\nback to the verandah and handed the pigeon to Sanders.\n\nThe Commissioner lifted the bird and with gentle fingers removed the\nslip of thin paper fastened to its leg by a rubber band.\n\nBefore he opened the paper he handed the weary little servant of the\nGovernment to an orderly.\n\n\"Lord, this is Sombubo,\" said Abiboo, and he lifted the pigeon to his\ncheek, \"and he comes from the Ochori.\"\n\nSanders had recognized the bird, for Sombubo was the swiftest, the\nwisest, and the strongest of all his messengers, and was never\ndispatched except on the most critical occasions.\n\nHe smoothed the paper and read the letter, which was in Arabic.\n\n     \"From the servant of God Bosambo, in the Ochori City, to Sandi,\n     where-the-sea-runs.\n\n     \"There have come three white men from the L'Mandi country, and they\n     have crossed the mountains. They sit with the Akasava in full\n     palaver. They say there shall be no more taxes for the People of\n     the River, but there shall come a new king greater than any. And\n     every man shall have goats and salt and free hunting. They say the\n     Akasava shall be given all the Ochori country, also guns like the\n     white man. Many guns and a thousand carriers are in the mountains\n     waiting to come. I hold the Ochori with all my spears. Also the\n     Isisi chief calls his young men for your King.\n\n     \"Peace be on your house in the name of Allah Compassionate and\n     Merciful.\"\n\n\"M-m!\" said Sanders, as he folded the paper. \"I'm afraid there will be\nno fishing this afternoon. Bones, take the _Wiggle_ and get up to the\nAkasava as fast as you can; I will follow on the _Zaire_. Abiboo!\"\n\n\"Lord?\"\n\n\"You will find me a swift Ochori pigeon. Hamilton, scribble a line to\nBosambo, and say that he shall meet Bones by Sokala's village.\"\n\nHalf an hour later Bones was sending incomprehensible semaphore signals\nof farewell as the _Wiggle_ slipped round the bend of the river.\n\nSokala, a little chief of the Isisi, was a rich man. He had ten wives,\neach of whom lived in her own hut. Also each wife wore about her neck a\ngreat ring of brass weighing twenty pounds, to testify to the greatness\nand wealth of her lord.\n\nSokala was wizened and lined of face, and across his forehead were many\ndeep furrows, and it seemed that he lived in a state of perplexity as to\nwhat should become of all his riches when he died, for he was cursed\nwith ten daughters--O'femi, Jubasami, K'sola, M'kema, Wasonga, Mombari,\net cetera.\n\nWhen Wasonga was fourteen, there was revealed to Sokala, her father, a\ngreat wonder.\n\nThe vision came at the tail end of a year of illness, when his head had\nached for weeks together, and not even the brass wire twisted lightly\nabout his skull brought him relief.\n\nSokala was lying on his fine bed of skins, wondering why strange animals\nsat by the fire in the centre of his hut, and why they showed their\nteeth and talked in human language. Sometimes they were leopards,\nsometimes they were little white-whiskered monkeys that scratched and\ntold one another stories, and these monkeys were the wisest of all, for\nthey discussed matters which were of urgency to the sick man rolling\nrestlessly from side to side.\n\nOn this great night two such animals had appeared suddenly, a big grey\nfellow with a solemn face, and a very little one, and they sat staring\ninto the fire, mechanically seeking their fleas until the little one\nspoke.\n\n\"Sokala is very rich and has ten daughters.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the other; \"also he will die because he has no\nson.\"\n\nSokala's heart beat furiously with fear, but he listened when the little\nblack monkey spoke.\n\n\"If Sokala took Wasonga, his daughter, into the forest near to The Tree\nand slew her, his daughters would become sons and he would grow well.\"\n\nAnd the other monkey nodded.\n\nAs they talked, Sokala recognized the truth of all that they had said.\nHe wondered that he had never thought of the matter before in this way.\nAll night long he lay thinking--thinking--long after the fires had died\ndown to a full red glow amidst white ashes, and the monkeys had\nvanished. In the cold dawn his people found him sitting on the side of\nthe bed, and marvelled that he should have lived the night through.\n\n\"Send me Wasonga, my daughter,\" he said, and they brought a sleepy girl\nof fourteen, tall, straight, and wholly reluctant. \"We go a journey,\"\nsaid Sokala, and took from beneath his bed his wicker shield and his\nsharp-edged throwing-spear.\n\n\"Sokala hunts,\" said the people of the village significantly, and they\nknew that the end was very near, for he had been a great hunter, and men\nturn in death to the familiar pursuits of life.\n\nThree miles on the forest road to the Isisi city, Sokala bade his\ndaughter sit on the ground.\n\nBones had met and was in earnest conversation with the Chief of the\nOchori, the _Wiggle_ being tied up at a wooding, when he heard a scream,\nand saw a girl racing through the wood towards him.\n\nBehind her, with the foolish stare on his face which comes to men in the\nlast stages of sleeping sickness, his spear balanced, came Sokala.\n\nThe girl tumbled in a wailing, choking heap at Bones's feet, and her\npursuer checked at the sight of the white man.\n\n\"I see you, Sokala,\"[2] said Bones gently.\n\n[Footnote 2: The native equivalent for \"Good morning.\"]\n\n\"Lord,\" said the old man, blinking at the officer of the Houssas, \"you\nshall see a wonderful magic when I slay this woman, for my daughters\nshall be sons, and I shall be a well man.\"\n\nBones took the spear from his unresisting hand.\n\n\"I will show you a greater magic, Sokala, for I will give you a little\nwhite stone which will melt like salt in your mouth, and you shall\nsleep.\"\n\nThe old man peered from Lieutenant Tibbetts to the King of the Ochori.\nHe watched Bones as he opened his medicine chest and shook out two\nlittle white pellets from a bottle marked \"Veronal,\" and accepted them\ngratefully.\n\n\"God bless my life,\" cried Bones, \"don't chew 'em, you dear old\nsilly--swallow 'em!\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Sokala soberly, \"they have a beautiful and a magic taste.\"\n\nBones sent the frightened girl back to the village, and made the old man\nsit by a tree.\n\n\"O Tibbetti,\" said Bosambo, in admiration, \"that was a good palaver. For\nit is better than the letting of blood, and no one will know that Sokala\ndid not die in his time.\"\n\nBones looked at him in horror.\n\n\"Goodness gracious heavens, Bosambo,\" he gasped, \"you don't think I've\npoisoned him?\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo, nodding his head, \"he die one time--he not fit\nfor lib--you give um plenty no-good stuff. You be fine Christian feller\nsame like me.\"\n\nBones wiped the perspiration from his brow and explained the action of\nveronal. Bosambo was sceptical. Even when Sokala fell into a profound\nslumber, Bosambo waited expectantly for his death. And when he realized\nthat Bones had spoken the truth, he was a most amazed man.\n\n\"Master,\" he said, in that fluid Ochori dialect which seems to be made\nup of vowels, \"this is a great magic. Now I see very surely that you\nhold wonderful ju-jus, and I have wronged you, for I thought you were\nwithout wisdom.\"\n\n\"Cheer-oh!\" said the gratified Bones.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNear by the city of the Akasava is a small hill on which no vegetation\ngrows, though it rises from a veritable jungle of undergrowth. The\nAkasava call this place the Hill of the Women, because it was here that\nM'lama, the King of the Akasava, slew a hundred Akasava maidens to\npropitiate M'shimba M'shamba, the god of storms. It was on the topmost\npoint of the hill that Sanders erected a fine gallows and hung M'lama\nfor his country's good. It had always been associated with the spiritual\nhistory of the Akasava, for ghosts and devils and strange ju-jus had\ntheir home hereabouts, and every great decision at which the people\narrived was made upon its slopes. At the crest there was a palaver\nhouse--no more than a straw-thatched canopy affording shelter for four\nmen at the most.\n\nOn a certain afternoon all the chiefs, great and minor, the headmen, the\nwarriors, and the leaders of fishing villages of the Akasava, squatted\nin a semicircle and listened to the oration of a bearded man, who spoke\neasily in the river dialect of the happy days which were coming to the\npeople.\n\nBy his side were two other white men--a tall, clean-shaven man with\nspectacles, and a stouter man with a bristling white moustache.\n\nHad the bearded man's address been in plain English, or even plain\nGerman, and had it been delivered to European hearers accustomed to\ntaking its religion in allegories and symbols, it would have been\nharmless. As it was, the illustrations and the imagery which the speaker\nemployed had no other interpretation to the simple-minded Akasava than a\npurely material one.\n\n\"I speak for the Great King,\" said the orator, throwing out his arms, \"a\nking who is more splendid than any. He has fierce and mighty armies that\ncover the land like ants. He holds thunder and lightning in his hand,\nand is greater than M'shimba M'shamba. He is the friend of the black man\nand the white, and will deliver you from all oppression. He will give\nyou peace and full crops, and make you _capita_ over your enemies. When\nhe speaks, all other kings tremble. He is a great buffalo, and the\npawing of his hoofs shakes the earth.\n\n\"This he says to you, the warrior people of the Akasava----\"\n\nThe message was destined to be undelivered.\n\nHeads began to turn, and there was a whisper of words. Some of the\naudience half rose, some on the outskirts of the gathering stole quietly\naway--the lesser chiefs were amongst these--and others, sitting stolidly\non, assumed a blandness and a scepticism of demeanour calculated to meet\nthe needs of the occasion.\n\nFor Sanders was at the foot of the hill, a trim figure in white, his\nsolar helmet pushed back to cover the nape of his neck from the slanting\nrays of the sun, and behind Sanders were two white officers and a\ncompany of Houssas with fixed bayonets. Not a word said Sanders, but\nslowly mounted the Hill of the Dead. He reached the palaver house and\nturned.\n\n\"Let no man go,\" he said, observing the disposition of the gathering to\nmelt away, \"for this is a great palaver, and I come to speak for these\nGod-men.\"\n\nThe bearded orator glared at the Commissioner and half turned to his\ncompanions. The stout man with the moustache said something quickly, but\nSanders silenced him with a gesture.\n\n\"O people,\" said Sanders, \"you all know that under my King men may live\nin peace, and death comes quickly to those who make war. Also you may\nworship in what manner you desire, though it be my God or the famous\ngods of your fathers. And such as preach of God or gods have full\nliberty. Who denies this?\"\n\n\"Lord, you speak the truth,\" said an eager headman.\n\n\"Therefore,\" said Sanders, \"my King has given these God-men a book[3]\nthat they may speak to you, and they have spoken. Of a great king they\ntell. Also of wonders which will come to you if you obey him. But this\nking is the same king of whom the God-cross men and the water-God men\ntell. For he lives beyond the stars, and his name is God. Tell me,\npreacher, if this is the truth?\"\n\n[Footnote 3: A book = written permission, any kind of document or\nwriting.]\n\nThe bearded man swallowed something and muttered, \"This is true.\"\n\n\"Also, there is no king in this world greater than my King, whom you\nserve,\" Sanders continued, \"and it is your duty to be obedient to him,\nand his name is D'jorja.\" Sanders raised his hand to his helmet in\nsalute. \"This also the God-men will tell you.\"\n\nHe turned to the three evangelists.\n\nHerr Professor Wiessmann hesitated for the fraction of a second. The\npause was pardonable, for he saw the undoing of three months' good work,\nand his thoughts at that moment were with a certain party of carriers\nwho waited in the mountains.\n\n\"The question of earthly and heavenly dominion is always debatable,\" he\nbegan in English, but Sanders stopped him.\n\n\"We will speak in the Akasava tongue,\" he said, \"and let all men hear.\nTell me, shall my people serve my King, or shall they serve another?\"\n\n\"They shall serve your King,\" growled the man, \"for it is the law.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Sanders in English.\n\nThe gathering slowly dispersed, leaving only the white men on the hill\nand a few lingering folk at the foot, watching the stolid native\nsoldiery with an apprehension born of experience.\n\n\"We should like you to dine with us,\" said Sanders pleasantly.\n\nThe leader of the L'Mandi mission hesitated, but the thin man with the\nspectacles, who had been silent, answered for him.\n\n\"We shall be pleased, Mr. Commissioner,\" he said. \"After eating with\nthese swine for a month, a good dinner would be very acceptable.\"\n\nSanders said nothing, though he winced at the inelegant description of\nhis people, and the three evangelists went back to their huts, which had\nbeen built for their use by the Akasava chief.\n\nAn hour later that worthy sent for a certain witch-doctor.\n\n\"Go secretly,\" he said, \"and call all headmen and chiefs to the Breaking\nTree in the forest. There they shall be until the moon comes up, and the\nL'Mandi lords will come and speak freely. And you shall tell them that\nthe word he spoke before Sandi was no true word, but to-night he shall\nspeak the truth, and when Sandi is gone we shall have wonderful guns\nand destroy all who oppose us.\"\n\nThis the witch-doctor did, and came back by the river path.\n\nHere, by all accounts, he met Bosambo, and would have passed on; but the\nChief of the Ochori, being in a curious mind and being, moreover,\nsuspicious, was impressed by the importance of the messenger, and made\ninquiries....\n\nAn old man is a great lover of life, and after the witch-doctor's head\nhad been twice held under water--for the river was providentially\nnear--he gasped the truth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three missioners were very grateful guests indeed. They were the\nmore grateful because Patricia Hamilton was an unexpected hostess. They\nclicked their heels and kissed her hand and drank her health many times\nin good hock. The dinner was a feast worthy of Lucullus, they swore, the\nwine was perfect, and the coffee--which Abiboo handed round with a\nsolemn face--was wonderful.\n\nThey sat chatting for a time, and then the bearded man looked at his\nwatch.\n\n\"To bed, gentlemen,\" he said gaily. \"We leave you, Herr Commissioner, in\ngood friendship, we trust?\"\n\n\"Oh, most excellent,\" said Sanders awkwardly, for he was a poor liar,\nand knew that his spies were waiting on the bank to \"pick up\" these\npotential enemies of his.\n\nHe watched them go ashore and disappear into the darkness of the forest\npath that leads to the village.\n\nThe moon was rising over the tall trees, and an expectant gathering of\nAkasava notables were waiting for a white spokesman who came not, when\nBosambo and his bodyguard were engaged in lifting three unconscious men\nand laying them in a large canoe. He himself paddled the long boat to\nmidstream, where two currents run swiftly, one to the sea and one to the\nIsisi River, which winds for a hundred miles until it joins the Congo.\n\n\"Go with God,\" said Bosambo piously, as he stepped into his own canoe,\nand released his hold of the other with its slumbering freight, \"for if\nyour king is so great, he will bring you to your own lands; and if he is\nnot great, then you are liars. O Abiboo\"--he spoke over his shoulder to\nthe sergeant of Houssas--\"tell me, how many of the magic white stones of\nBonesi did you put in their drink?\"\n\n\"Bosambo, I put four in each, as you told me, and if my lord Tibbetti\nmisses them, what shall I say?\"\n\n\"You shall say,\" said Bosambo, \"that this is Sandi's own word--that when\nmen plan evils they must first sleep. And I think these men will sleep\nfor a long time. Perhaps they will sleep for ever--all things are with\nGod.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE MEDICINE MAN\n\n\nAt the flood season, before the turbulent tributaries of the Isisi River\nhad been induced to return to their accustomed channels, Sanders came\nback to headquarters a very weary man, for he had spent a horrid week in\nan endeavour--successful, but none the less nerve-racking--to impress an\nindolent people that the swamping of their villages was less a matter of\nProvidence and ghosts than the neglect of elementary precaution.\n\n\"For I told you, Ranabini,\" said an exasperated Sanders, \"that you\nshould keep the upper channel free from trees and branches, and I have\npaid you many bags of salt for your services.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is so,\" said Ranabini, scratching his brown leg thoughtfully.\n\n\"At the full of the moon, before the rains, did I not ask you if the\nchannel was clear, and did you not say it was like the street of your\nvillage?\" demanded Sanders, in wrath.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Ranabini frankly, \"I lied to you, thinking your lordship\nwas mad. For what other man would foresee with his wonderful eye that\nrains would come? Therefore, lord, I did not think of the upper channel,\nand many trees floated down and made a little dam. Lord, I am an\nignorant man, and my mind is full of my own brother, who has come from a\nlong distance to see me, for he is a very sick man.\"\n\nSanders's mind was occupied by no thought of Ranabini's sick brother, as\nthe dazzling white _Zaire_ went thrashing her way down stream. For he\nhimself was a tired man, and needed rest, and there was a dose of\nmalaria looming in the offing, as his aching head told him. It was as\nthough his brains were arranged in slats, like a venetian blind, and\nthese slats were opening and closing swiftly, bringing with each\nlightning flicker a momentary unconsciousness.\n\nCaptain Hamilton met him on the quay, and when Sanders landed--walking a\nthought unsteadily, and instantly began a long and disjointed account of\nhis adventures on a Norwegian salmon river--Hamilton took him by the arm\nand led the way to the bungalow.\n\nIn ten minutes he was assisting Sanders into his pyjamas, Sanders\nprotesting, albeit feebly, and when, after forcing an astonishing amount\nof quinine and arsenic down his chief's throat, Hamilton came from the\nsemi-darkness of the bungalow to the white glare of the barrack square,\nHamilton was thoughtful.\n\n\"Let one of your women watch by the bed of the lord Sandi,\" said he to\nSergeant Abiboo, of the Houssas, \"and she shall call me if he grows\nworse.\"\n\n\"On my life,\" said Abiboo, and was going off.\n\n\"Where is Tibbetti?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nThe sergeant turned back and seemed embarrassed.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"Tibbetti has gone with the lady, your sister, to make\na palaver with Jimbujini, the witch-doctor of the Akasava. They sit in\nthe forest in a magic circle, and lo! Tibbetti grows very wise.\"\n\nHamilton swore under his breath. He had ordered Lieutenant Tibbetts, his\nsecond-in-command, prop, stay, and aide-de-camp, to superintend the\ndrill of some raw Kano recruits who had been sent from the coast.\n\n\"Go tell the lord Tibbetti to come to me,\" he said, \"but first send your\nwoman to Sandi.\"\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts, with his plain, boyish face all red with his\nexertions, yet dignified withal, came hurriedly from his studies.\n\n\"Come aboard, sir,\" he said, and saluted extravagantly, blinking at his\nsuperior with a curious solemnity of mien which was his own peculiar\nexpression.\n\n\"Bones,\" said Hamilton, \"where the dickens have you been?\"\n\nBones drew a long breath. He hesitated, then--\n\n\"Knowledge,\" he said shortly.\n\nHamilton looked at his subordinate in alarm.\n\n\"Dash it, you aren't off your head, too, are you?\"\n\nBones shook his head with vigour.\n\n\"Knowledge of the occult, sir and brother-officer,\" he said. \"One is\nnever too old to learn, sir, in this jolly old world.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Hamilton; \"in fact, I'm pretty certain that you'll\nnever live long enough to learn everything.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nThe girl, who had had less qualms than Bones when the summons arrived,\nand had, in consequence, returned more leisurely, came into the room.\n\n\"Pat,\" said her brother, \"Sanders is down with fever.\"\n\n\"Fever!\" she said a little breathlessly. \"It isn't--dangerous?\"\n\nBones, smiling indulgently, soothed her.\n\n\"Nothin' catchin', dear Miss Patricia Hamilton,\" he began.\n\n\"Please don't be stupid,\" she said so fiercely that Bones recoiled. \"Do\nyou think I'm afraid of catching anything? Is it dangerous for Mr.\nSanders?\" she asked her brother.\n\n\"No more dangerous than a cold in the head,\" he answered flippantly. \"My\ndear child, we all have fever. You'll have it, too, if you go out at\nsunset without your mosquito boots.\"\n\nHe explained, with the easy indifference of a man inured to malaria,\nthe habits of the mosquito--his predilection for ankles and wrists,\nwhere the big veins and arteries are nearer to the surface--but the girl\nwas not reassured. She would have sat up with Sanders, but the idea so\nalarmed Hamilton that she abandoned it.\n\n\"He'd never forgive me,\" he said. \"My dear girl, he'll be as right as a\ntrivet in the morning.\"\n\nShe was sceptical, but, to her amazement, Sanders turned up at breakfast\nhis usual self, save that he was a little weary-eyed, and that his hand\nshook when he raised his coffee-cup to his lips. A miracle, thought\nPatricia Hamilton, and said so.\n\n\"Not at all, dear miss,\" said Bones, now, as ever, accepting full credit\nfor all phenomena she praised, whether natural or supernatural. \"This is\nsimply nothin' to what happened to me. Ham, dear old feller, do you\nremember when I was brought down from the Machengombi River? Simply\ndelirious--ravin'--off my head.\"\n\n\"So much so,\" said Hamilton, slicing the top off his egg, \"that we\ndidn't think you were ill.\"\n\n\"If you'd seen me,\" Bones went on, solemnly shaking one skinny\nforefinger at the girl, \"you'd have said: 'Bones is for the High Jump.'\"\n\n\"I should have said nothing so vulgar, Bones,\" she retorted. \"And was it\nmalaria?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Hamilton triumphantly, \"I was too much of a gentleman to hint\nthat it wasn't. Press the question, Pat.\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders and cast a look of withering contempt upon\nhis superior.\n\n\"In the execution of one's duty, dear Miss Patricia H,\" he said, \"the\ncalibre of the gun that lays a fellow low, an' plunges his relations an'\ncreditors into mournin', is beside the point. The only consideration, as\ndear old Omar says, is--\n\n     \"'The movin' finger hits, an', havin' hit,\n     Moves on, tum tumty tumty tay,\n     And all a feller does won't make the slightest difference.'\"\n\n\"Is that Omar or Shakespeare?\" asked the dazed Hamilton.\n\n\"Be quiet, dear. What was the illness, Bones?\"\n\n\"Measles,\" said Hamilton brutally, \"and German measles at that.\"\n\n\"Viciously put, dear old officer, but, nevertheless, true,\" said Bones\nbuoyantly. \"But when the hut's finished, I'll return good for evil.\nThere's goin' to be a revolution, Miss Patricia Hamilton. No more fever,\nno more measles--health, wealth, an' wisdom, by gad!\"\n\n\"Sunstroke,\" diagnosed Hamilton. \"Pull yourself together, Bones--you're\namongst friends.\"\n\nBut Bones was superior to sarcasm.\n\nThere was a creature of Lieutenant Tibbetts a solemn, brown man, who\npossessed, in addition to a vocabulary borrowed from a departed\nprofessor of bacteriology, a rough working knowledge of the classics.\nThis man's name was, as I have already explained, Abid Ali or Ali Abid,\nand in him Bones discovered a treasure beyond price.\n\nBones had recently built himself a large square hut near the\nseashore--that is to say, he had, with the expenditure of a great amount\nof midnight oil, a pair of compasses, a box of paints, and a T-square,\nevolved a somewhat complicated plan whereon certain blue oblongs stood\nfor windows, and certain red cones indicated doors. To this he had added\nan elevation in the severe Georgian style.\n\nWith his plan beautifully drawn to scale, with sectional diagrams and\nside elevations embellishing its margin, he had summoned Mojeri of the\nLower Isisi, famous throughout the land as a builder of great houses,\nand to him he had entrusted the execution of his design.\n\n\"This you shall build for me, Mojeri,\" said Bones, sucking the end of\nhis pencil and gazing lovingly at the plan outspread before him, \"and\nyou shall be famous all through the world. This room shall be twice as\nlarge as that, and you shall cunningly contrive a passage so that I may\nmove from one to the other, and none see me come or go. Also, this shall\nbe my sleeping-place, and this a great room where I will practise\npowerful magics.\"\n\nMojeri took the plan in his hand and looked at it. He turned it upside\ndown and looked at it that way. Then he looked at it sideways.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, putting down the plan with a reverent hand, \"all these\nwonders I shall remember.\"\n\n\"And did he?\" asked Hamilton, when Bones described the interview.\n\nBones blinked and swallowed.\n\n\"He went away and built me a square hut--just a plain square hut. Mojeri\nis an ass, sir--a jolly old fraud an' humbug, sir. He----\"\n\n\"Let me see the plan,\" said Hamilton, and his subordinate produced the\ncartridge paper.\n\n\"H'm!\" said Hamilton, after a careful scrutiny. \"Very pretty. But how\ndid you get into your room?\"\n\n\"Through the door, dear old officer,\" said the sarcastic Bones.\n\n\"I thought it might be through the roof,\" said Hamilton, \"or possibly\nyou made one of your famous dramatic entries through a star-trap in the\nfloor--\n\n     \"'Who is it speaks in those sepulchral tones?\n     It is the demon king--the grisly Bones!\n                                      Bing!'\n\n\"and up you pop amidst red fire and smoke.\"\n\nA light dawned on Bones.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me, jolly old Ham, that I forgot to put a door into\nmy room?\" he asked incredulously, and peered over his chief's shoulder.\n\n\"That is what I mean, Bones. And where does the passage lead to?\"\n\n\"That goes straight from my sleepin' room to the room marked L,\" said\nBones, in triumph.\n\n\"Then you _were_ going to be a demon king,\" said the admiring Hamilton.\n\"But fortunately for you, Bones, the descent to L is not so easy--you've\ndrawn a party wall across----\"\n\n\"L stands for laboratory,\" explained the architect hurriedly. \"An'\nwhere's the wall? God bless my jolly old soul, so I have! Anyway, that\ncould have been rectified in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"Speaking largely,\" said Hamilton, after a careful scrutiny of the plan,\n\"I think Mojeri has acted wisely. You will have to be content with the\none room. What was the general idea of the house, anyway?\"\n\n\"Science an' general illumination of the human mind,\" said Bones\ncomprehensively.\n\n\"I see,\" said Hamilton. \"You were going to make fireworks. A splendid\nidea, Bones.\"\n\n\"Painful as it is to undeceive you, dear old sir,\" said Bones,\nwith admirable patience, \"I must tell you that I'm takin' up my\nmedical studies where I left off. Recently I've been wastin' my time,\nsir: precious hours an' minutes have been passed in frivolous\namusement--_tempus fugit_, sir an' captain, _festina lente_, an'\nI might add----\"\n\n\"Don't,\" begged Hamilton; \"you give me a headache.\"\n\nThere was a look of interest in Bones's eyes.\n\n\"If I may be allowed to prescribe, sir----\" he began.\n\n\"Thanks, I'd rather have the headache,\" replied Hamilton hastily.\n\nIt was nearly a week before the laboratory was fitted that Bones gave a\nhouse-warming, which took the shape of an afternoon tea. Bones, arrayed\nin a long white coat, wearing a ferocious lint mask attached to huge\nmica goggles, through which he glared on the world, met the party at the\ndoor and bade them a muffled welcome. They found the interior of the hut\na somewhat uncomfortable place. The glass retorts, test tubes, bottles,\nand the paraphernalia of science which Bones had imported crowded the\nbig table, the shelves, and even overflowed on to the three available\nchairs.\n\n\"Welcome to my little workroom,\" said the hollow voice of Bones from\nbehind the mask. \"Wel----Don't put your foot in the crucible, dear old\nofficer! You're sittin' on the methylated spirits, ma'am! Phew!\"\n\nBones removed his mask and showed a hot, red face.\n\n\"Don't take it off, Bones,\" begged Hamilton; \"it improves you.\"\n\nSanders was examining the microscope, which stood under a big glass\nshade.\n\n\"You're very complete, Bones,\" he said approvingly. \"In what branch of\nscience are you dabbling?\"\n\n\"Tropical diseases, sir,\" said Bones promptly, and lifted the shade.\n\"I'm hopin' you'll allow me to have a look at your blood after tea.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Sanders. \"You had better practise on Hamilton.\"\n\n\"Don't come near me!\" threatened Hamilton.\n\nIt was Patricia who, when the tea-things had been removed, played the\nheroine.\n\n\"Take mine,\" she said, and extended her hand.\n\nBones found a needle, and sterilized it in the flame of a spirit lamp.\n\n\"This won't hurt you,\" he quavered, and brought the point near the\nwhite, firm flesh. Then he drew it back again.\n\n\"This won't hurt you, dear old miss,\" he croaked, and repeated the\nperformance.\n\nHe stood up and wiped his streaming brow.\n\n\"I haven't the heart to do it,\" he said dismally.\n\n\"A pretty fine doctor you are, Bones!\" she scoffed, and took the needle\nfrom his hand. \"There!\"\n\nBones put the tiny crimson speck between his slides, blobbed a drop of\noil on top, and focussed the microscope.\n\nHe looked for a long time, then turned a scared face to the girl.\n\n\"Sleepin' sickness, poor dear old Miss Hamilton!\" he gasped. \"You're\nsimply full of tryps! Good Lord! What a blessin' for you I discovered\nit!\"\n\nSanders pushed the young scientist aside and looked. When he turned his\nhead, the girl saw his face was white and drawn, and for a moment a\nsense of panic overcame her.\n\n\"You silly ass,\" growled the Commissioner, \"they aren't trypnosomes! You\nhaven't cleaned the infernal eyepiece!\"\n\n\"Not trypnosomes?\" said Bones.\n\n\"You seem disappointed, Bones,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"As a man, I'm overjoyed,\" replied Bones gloomily; \"as a scientist, it's\na set-back, dear old officer--a distinct set-back.\"\n\nThe house-warming lasted a much shorter time than the host had intended.\nThis was largely due to the failure of a very beautiful experiment which\nhe had projected. In order that the rare and wonderful result at which\nhe aimed should be achieved, Bones had the hut artificially darkened,\nand they sat in a hot and sticky blackness, whilst he knocked over\nbottles and swore softly at the instruments his groping hand could not\ndiscover. And the end of the experiment was a large, bad smell.\n\n\"The women and children first,\" said Hamilton, and dived for the door.\n\nThey took farewell of Bones at a respectful distance.\n\nHamilton went across to the Houssa lines, and Sanders walked back to the\nResidency with the girl. For a little while they spoke of Bones and his\nnewest craze, and then suddenly the girl asked--\n\n\"You didn't really think there were any of those funny things in my\nblood, did you?\"\n\nSanders looked straight ahead.\n\n\"I thought--you see, we know--the tryp is a distinct little body, and\nanybody who had lived in this part of the world for a time can pick him\nout. Bones, of course, knows nothing thoroughly--I should have\nremembered that.\"\n\nShe said nothing until they reached the verandah, and she turned to go\nto her room.\n\n\"It wasn't nice, was it?\" she said.\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"It was a taste of hell,\" he said simply. And she fetched a quick, long\nsigh and patted his arm before she realized what she was doing.\n\nBones, returning from his hut, met Sanders hurrying across the square.\n\n\"Bones, I want you to go up to the Isisi,\" said the Commissioner.\n\"There's an outbreak of some weird disease, probably due to the damming\nof the little river by Ranabini, and the flooding of the low forests.\"\n\nBones brightened up.\n\n\"Sir an' Excellency,\" he said gratefully, \"comin' from you, this tribute\nto my scientific----\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Bones!\" said Sanders irritably. \"Your job is to make\nthese beggars work. They'll simply sit and die unless you start them on\ndrainage work. Cut a few ditches with a fall to the river; kick Ranabini\nfor me; take up a few kilos of quinine and dose them.\"\n\nNevertheless, Bones managed to smuggle on board quite a respectable\namount of scientific apparatus, and came in good heart to the despondent\nfolk of the Lower Isisi.\n\nThree weeks after Bones had taken his departure, Sanders was sitting at\ndinner in a very thoughtful mood.\n\nPatricia had made several ineffectual attempts to draw him into a\nconversation, and had been answered in monosyllables. At first she had\nbeen piqued and a little angry, but, as the meal progressed, she\nrealized that matters of more than ordinary seriousness were occupying\nhis thoughts, and wisely changed her attitude of mind. A chance\nreference to Bones, however, succeeded where more pointed attempts had\nfailed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sanders, in answer to the question she had put, \"Bones has\nsome rough idea of medical practice. He was a cub student at Bart.'s for\ntwo years before he realized that surgery and medicines weren't his\nforte.\"\n\n\"Don't you sometimes feel the need of a doctor here?\" she asked, and\nSanders smiled.\n\n\"There is very little necessity. The military doctor comes down\noccasionally from headquarters, and we have a native apothecary. We have\nfew epidemics amongst the natives, and those the medical missions deal\nwith--sleep-sickness, beri-beri and the like. Sometimes, of course, we\nhave a pretty bad outbreak which spreads----Don't go, Hamilton--I want\nto see you for a minute.\"\n\nHamilton had risen, and was making for his room, with a little nod to\nhis sister.\n\nAt Sanders's word he turned.\n\n\"Walk with me for a few minutes,\" said Sanders, and, with an apology to\nthe girl, he followed the other from the room.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nSanders was perturbed--this he knew, and his own move towards his room\nwas in the nature of a challenge for information.\n\n\"Bones,\" said the Commissioner shortly. \"Do you realize that we have had\nno news from him since he left?\"\n\nHamilton smiled.\n\n\"He's an erratic beggar, but nothing could have happened to him, or we\nshould have heard about it.\"\n\nSanders did not reply at once. He paced up and down the gravelled path\nbefore the Residency, his hands behind him.\n\n\"No news has come from Ranabini's village for the simple reason that\nnobody has entered or left it since Bones arrived,\" he said. \"It is\nsituated, as you know, on a tongue of land at the confluence of two\nrivers. No boat has left the beaches, and an attempt to reach it by land\nhas been prevented by force.\"\n\n\"By force?\" repeated the startled Hamilton.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"I had the report in this morning. Two men of the Isisi from another\nvillage went to call on some relations. They were greeted with arrows,\nand returned hurriedly. The headman of M'gomo village met with the same\nreception. This came to the ears of my chief spy Ahmet, who attempted to\npaddle to the island in his canoe. At a distance of two hundred yards he\nwas fired upon.\"\n\n\"Then they've got Bones?\" gasped Hamilton.\n\n\"On the contrary, Bones nearly got Ahmet, for Bones was the marksman.\"\n\nThe two men paced the path in silence.\n\n\"Either Bones has gone mad,\" said Hamilton, \"or----\"\n\n\"Or----?\"\n\nHamilton laughed helplessly.\n\n\"I can't fathom the mystery,\" he said. \"McMasters will be down\nto-morrow, to look at some sick men. We'll take him up, and examine the\nboy.\"\n\nIt was a subdued little party that boarded the _Zaire_ the following\nmorning, and Patricia Hamilton, who came to see them off, watched their\ndeparture with a sense of impending trouble.\n\nDr. McMasters alone was cheerful, for this excursion represented a break\nin a somewhat monotonous routine.\n\n\"It may be the sun,\" he suggested. \"I have known several fellows who\nhave gone a little nutty from that cause. I remember a man at Grand\nBassam who shot----\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up, Mac, you grisly devil!\" snapped Hamilton. \"Talk about\nbutterflies.\"\n\nThe _Zaire_ swung round the bend of the river that hid Ranabini's\nvillage from view, but had scarcely come into sight when--\n\n\"Ping!\"\n\nSanders saw the bullet strike the river ahead of the boat, and send a\nspiral column of water shooting into the air. He put up his glasses and\nfocussed them on the village beach.\n\n\"Bones!\" he said grimly. \"Take her in, Abiboo.\"\n\nAs the steersman spun the wheel--\n\n\"Ping!\"\n\nThis time the shot fell to the right.\n\nThe three white men looked at one another.\n\n\"Let every man take cover,\" said Sanders quietly. \"We're going to that\nbeach even if Bones has a battery of 75's!\"\n\nAn exclamation from Hamilton arrested him.\n\n\"He's signalling,\" said the Houssa Captain, and Sanders put up his\nglasses again.\n\nBones's long arms were waving at ungainly angles as he semaphored his\nwarning.\n\nHamilton opened his notebook and jotted down the message--\n\n\"Awfully sorry, dear old officer,\" he spelt, and grinned at the\nunnecessary exertion of this fine preliminary flourish, \"but must keep\nyou away. Bad outbreak of virulent smallpox----\"\n\nSanders whistled, and pulled back the handle of the engine-room\ntelegraph to \"stop.\"\n\n\"My God!\" said Hamilton through his teeth, for he had seen such an\noutbreak once, and knew something of its horrors. Whole districts had\nbeen devastated in a night. One tribe had been wiped out, and the\nrotting frames of their houses still showed amidst the tangle of\nelephant grass which had grown up through the ruins.\n\nHe wiped his forehead and read the message a little unsteadily, for his\nmind was on his sister--\n\n     \"Had devil of fight, and lost twenty men, but got it under. Come\n     and get me in three weeks. Had to stay here for fear careless\n     devils spreading disease.\"\n\nSanders looked at Hamilton, and McMasters chuckled.\n\n\"This is where I get a swift vacation,\" he said, and called his servant.\n\nHamilton leapt on to the rail, and steadying himself against a\nstanchion, waved a reply--\n\n\"We are sending you a doctor.\"\n\nBack came the reply in agitated sweeps of arm--\n\n\"Doctor be blowed! What am I?\"\n\n\"What shall I say, sir?\" asked Hamilton after he had delivered the\nmessage.\n\n\"Just say 'a hero,'\" said Sanders huskily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nBONES, KING-MAKER\n\n\nPatricia Hamilton, an observant young lady, had not failed to notice\nthat every day, at a certain hour, Bones disappeared from view. It was\nnot for a long time that she sought an explanation.\n\n\"Where is Bones?\" she asked one morning, when the absence of her\ncavalier was unusually protracted.\n\n\"With his baby,\" said her brother.\n\n\"Please don't be comic, dear. Where is Bones? I thought I saw him with\nthe ship's doctor.\"\n\nThe mail had come in that morning, and the captain and surgeon of the\ns.s. _Boma Queen_ had been their guests at breakfast.\n\nHamilton looked up from his book and removed his pipe.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that Bones has kept his guilty secret all this\ntime?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nShe sat down by his side.\n\n\"Please tell me the joke. This isn't the first time you have ragged\nBones about 'the baby'; even Mr. Sanders has done it.\"\n\nShe looked across at the Commissioner with a reproving shake of her\npretty head.\n\n\"Have _I_ ragged Bones?\" asked Sanders, in surprise. \"I never thought I\nwas capable of ragging anybody.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Pat,\" said her brother, \"there isn't any rag about the\nmatter. Bones adopted a piccanin.\"\n\n\"A child?\"\n\n\"A baby about a month old. Its mother died, and some old bird of a\nwitch-doctor was 'chopping' it when Bones appeared on the scene.\"\n\nPatricia gave a little gurgle of delight and clapped her hands. \"Oh,\nplease tell me everything about it.\"\n\n\"It was Sanders who told her of Henry Hamilton Bones, his dire peril and\nhis rescue; it was Hamilton who embellished the story of how Bones had\ngiven his adopted son his first bath.\n\n\"Just dropped him into a tub and stirred him round with a mop.\"\n\nSoon after this Bones came blithely up from the beach and across the\nparade-ground, his large pipe in his mouth, his cane awhirl.\n\nHamilton watched him from the verandah of the Residency, and called over\nhis shoulder to Patricia.\n\nIt had been an anxious morning for Bones, and even Hamilton was\ncompelled to confess to himself that he had felt the strain, though he\nhad not mentioned the fact to his sister.\n\nOutside in the roadstead the intermediate Elder Dempster boat was\nwaiting the return of the doctor. Bones had been to see him off. An\nimportant day, indeed, for Henry Hamilton Bones had been vaccinated.\n\n\"I think it 'took,'\" said Bones gravely, answering the other's question.\n\"I must say Henry behaved like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"What did Fitz say?\"\n\n(Fitzgerald, the doctor, had come in accordance with his promise to\nperform the operation.)\n\n\"Fitz?\" said Bones, and his voice trembled. \"Fitz is a cad!\"\n\nHamilton grinned.\n\n\"He said that babies didn't feel pain, and there was Henry howling his\nyoung head off. It was horrible!\"\n\nBones wiped his streaming brow with a large and violent bandana, and\nlooked round cautiously.\n\n\"Not a word, Ham, to her!\" he said, in a loud whisper.\n\n\"Sorry!\" said Hamilton, picking up his pipe. \"Her knows.\"\n\n\"Good gad!\" said Bones, in despair, and turned to meet the girl.\n\n\"Oh, Bones!\" she said reproachfully, \"you never told me!\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders, opened his mouth, dropped his pipe,\nblinked, spread out his hands in deprecation, and picked up his pipe.\n\nFrom which it may be gathered that he was agitated.\n\n\"Dear old Miss Hamilton,\" he said tremulously, \"I should be a horrid\nbounder if I denied Henry Hamilton Bones--poor little chap. If I never\nmentioned him, dear old sister, it is because----Ah, well, you will\nnever understand.\"\n\nHe hunched his shoulders dejectedly.\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Bones. Why the dickens are you making a mystery of the\nthing?\" asked Hamilton. \"I'll certify you're a jolly good father to the\nbrat.\"\n\n\"Not 'brat,' dear old sir,\" begged Bones. \"Henry is a human being with a\nhuman heart. That boy\"--he wagged his finger solemnly--\"knows me the\nmoment I go into the hut. To see him sit up an' say 'Da!' dear old\nsister Hamilton,\" he went on incoherently, \"to see him open his mouth\nwith a smile, one tooth through, an' one you can feel with your little\nfinger--why, it's--it's wonderful, jolly old Miss Hamilton! Damn it,\nit's wonderful!\"\n\n\"Bones!\" cried the shocked girl.\n\n\"I can't help it, madame,\" said Bones miserably. \"Fitz cut his poor\nlittle, fat little arm. Oh, Fitz is a low cad! Cut it, my dear old\nPatricia, mercilessly--yes, mercilessly, brutally, an' the precious\nlittle blighter didn't so much as call for the police. Good gad, it was\nterrible!\"\n\nHis eyes were moist, and he blew his nose with great vigour.\n\n\"I'm sure it was awful,\" she soothed him. \"May I come and see him?\"\n\nBones raised a warning hand, and, though the habitat of the wonderful\nchild could not have been less than half a mile away, lowered his voice.\n\n\"He's asleep--fitfully, but asleep. I've told them to call me if he has\na turn for the worse, an' I'm goin' down with a gramophone after dinner,\nin case the old fellow wants buckin' up. But now he's asleep, thankin'\nyou for your great kindness an' sympathy, dear old miss, in the moment\nof singular trial.\"\n\nHe took her hand and shook it heartily, tried to say something, and\nswallowed hard, then, turning, walked from the verandah in the direction\nof his hut.\n\nThe girl was smiling, but there were tears in her eyes.\n\n\"What a boy!\" she said, half to herself.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"Bones is very nice,\" he said, and she looked at him curiously.\n\n\"That is almost eloquent,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"I thought it was rather bald,\" he replied. \"You see, few people really\nunderstand Bones. I thought, the first time I saw him, that he was a\nfool. I was wrong. Then I thought he was effeminate. I was wrong again,\nfor he has played the man whenever he was called upon to do so. Bones\nis one of those rare creatures--a man with all the moral equipment of a\ngood woman.\"\n\nHer eyes were fixed on his, and for a moment they held. Then hers\ndropped quickly, and she flushed ever so slightly.\n\n\"I think you have defined the perfect man,\" she said, turning the leaves\nof her book.\n\nThe next morning she was admitted to an audience with that paragon of\nparagons, Henry Hamilton Bones.\n\nHe lived in the largest of the Houssa huts at the far end of the lines,\nand had for attendants two native women, for whom Bones had framed the\nmost stringent and regimental of orders.\n\nThe girl paused in the porch of the hut to read the typewritten\nregulations which were fastened by drawing-pins to a green baize board.\n\nThey were bi-lingual, being in English and in coast Arabic, in which\ndialect Bones was something of a master. The girl wondered why they\nshould be in English.\n\n\"Absolutely necessary, dear old lady friend,\" explained Bones firmly.\n\"You've no idea what a lot of anxiety I have had. Your dear old\nbrother--God bless him!--is a topping old sport, but with children you\ncan't be too careful, and Ham is awfully thoughtless. There, I've said\nit!\"\n\nThe English part of the regulations was brief, and she read it through.\n\n                    HENRY HAMILTON BONES (Care of).\n\n     1.

A fat-faced atom of\nbrown humanity, bald-headed and big-eyed, he sucked his thumb and stared\nat the visitor, and from the visitor to Bones.\n\nBones he regarded with an intelligent interest which dissolved into a\nfat chuckle of sheer delight.\n\n\"Isn't it--isn't it simply extraordinary?\" demanded Bones ecstatically.\n\"In all your long an' painful experience, dear old friend an' co-worker,\nhave you ever seen anything like it? When you remember that babies don't\nopen their eyes until three weeks after they're born----\"\n\n\"Da!\" said Henry Hamilton Bones.\n\n\"Da yourself, Henry!\" squawked his foster-father.\n\n\"Do da!\" said Henry.\n\nThe smile vanished from Bones's face, and he bit his lip thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do da!\" he repeated. \"Let me see, what is 'do da'?\"\n\n\"Do da!\" roared Henry.\n\n\"Dear old Miss Hamilton,\" he said gently, \"I don't know whether Henry\nwants a drink or whether he has a pain in his stomach, but I think that\nwe had better leave him in more experienced hands.\"\n\nHe nodded fiercely to the native woman nurse and made his exit.\n\nOutside they heard Henry's lusty yell, and Bones put his hand to his ear\nand listened with a strained expression on his face.\n\nPresently the tension passed.\n\n\"It _was_ a drink,\" said Bones. \"Excuse me whilst I make a note.\" He\npulled out his pocket-book and wrote: \"'Do da' means 'child wants\ndrink.'\"\n\nHe walked back to the Residency with her, giving her a remarkable\ninsight into Henry's vocabulary. It appeared that babies have a language\nof their own, which Bones boasted that he had almost mastered.\n\nShe lay awake for a very long time that night, thinking of Bones, his\nsimplicity and his lovableness. She thought, too, of Sanders, grave,\naloof, and a little shy, and wondered....\n\nShe woke with a start, to hear the voice of Bones outside the window.\nShe felt sure that something had happened to Henry. Then she heard\nSanders and her brother speaking, and realized that it was not Henry\nthey were discussing.\n\nShe looked at her watch--it was three o'clock.\n\n\"I was foolish to trust that fellow,\" Sanders was saying, \"and I know\nthat Bosambo is not to blame, because he has always given a very wide\nberth to the Kulumbini people, though they live on his border.\"\n\nShe heard him speak in a strange tongue to some unknown fourth, and\nguessed that a spy of the Government had come in during the night.\n\n\"We'll get away as quickly as we can, Bones,\" Sanders said. \"We can take\nour chance with the lower river in the dark; it will be daylight before\nwe reach the bad shoals. You need not come, Hamilton.\"\n\n\"Do you think Bones will be able to do all you want?\" Hamilton's tone\nwas dubious.\n\n\"Pull yourself together, dear old officer,\" said Bones, raising his\nvoice to an insubordinate pitch.\n\nShe heard the men move from the verandah, and fell asleep again,\nwondering who was the man they spoke of and what mischief he had been\nbrewing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a little tributary stream, which is hidden by the island of bats, was\nthe village of Kulumbini. High elephant grass hid the poor huts even\nfrom they who navigate a cautious way along the centre of the narrow\nstream. On the shelving beach one battered old canoe of ironwood, with\nits sides broken and rusted, the indolence of its proprietor made plain\nby the badly spliced panels, was all that told the stranger that the\nhabitations of man were nigh.\n\nKulumbini was a term of reproach along the great river and amongst the\npeople of the Akasava, the Isisi, and the N'gombi, no less than among\nthat most tolerant of tribes the Ochori. They were savage people,\nimmensely brave, terrible in battle, but more terrible after.\n\nKulumbini, the village and city of the tribe, was no more than an\noutlier of a fairly important tribe which occupied forest land\nstretching back to the Ochori boundary. Their territory knew no frontier\nsave the frontiers of caprice and desire. They had neither nationality\nnor national ambition, and would sell their spears for a bunch of fish,\nas the saying goes. Their one consuming passion and one great wish was\nthat they should not be overlooked, and, so long as the tribes respected\nthis eccentricity, the Kulumbini distressed no man.\n\nHow this desire for isolation arose, none know. It is certain that once\nupon a time they possessed a king who so shared their views that he\nnever came amongst them, but lived in a forest place which is called to\nthis day S'furi-S'foosi, \"The trees (or glade) of the distant king.\"\nThey had demurred at Government inspection, and Sanders, coming up the\nlittle river on the first of his visits, was greeted by a shower of\narrows, and his landing opposed by locked shields.\n\nThere are many ways of disposing of opposition, not the least important\nof which is to be found in two big brass-barrelled guns which have their\nabiding place at each end of the _Zaire's_ bridge. There is also a\nmethod known as peaceful suasion. Sanders had compromised by going\nashore for a peace palaver with a revolver in each hand.\n\nHe had a whole fund of Bomongo stories, most of which are unfit for\nprinting, but which, nevertheless, find favour amongst the primitive\nhumorists of the Great River. By parable and story, by nonsense tale and\nromance, by drawing upon his imagination to supply himself with facts,\nby invoking ju-jus, ghosts, devils, and all the armoury of native\nsuperstition, he had, in those far-off times, prevailed upon the people\nof Kulumbini not only to allow him a peaceful entrance to their country,\nbut--wonder of wonders!--to contribute, when the moon and tide were in\ncertain relative positions, which in English means once every six\nmonths, a certain tithe or tax, which might consist of rubber, ivory,\nfish, or manioc, according to the circumstances of the people.\n\nMore than this, he stamped a solemn treaty--he wrote it in a tattered\nlaundry-book which had come into the chief's possession by some\nmysterious means--and he hung about the neck of Gulabala, the titular\nlord of these strange people, the medal and chain of chieftainship.\n\nNot to be outdone in courtesy, the chief offered him the choice of all\nthe maidens of Kulumbini, and Sanders, to whom such offers were by no\nmeans novel, had got out of a delicate situation in his usual manner,\nhaving resort to witchcraft for the purpose. For he said, with due\nsolemnity and hushed breath, that it had been predicted by a celebrated\nwitch-doctor of the lower river that the next wife he should take to\nhimself would die of the sickness-mongo, and said Sanders--\n\n\"My heart is too tender for your people, O Chief, to lead one of your\nbeautiful daughters to death.\"\n\n\"O Sandi,\" replied Gulabala hopefully, \"I have many daughters, and I\nshould not miss one. And would it not be good service for a woman of my\nhouse to die in your hut?\"\n\n\"We see things differently, you and I,\" said Sanders, \"for, according to\nmy religion, if any woman dies from witchcraft, her ghost sits for ever\nat the foot of my bed, making terrifying faces.\"\n\nThus Sanders had made his escape, and had received at odd intervals the\ntribute of these remote people.\n\nFor years they had dwelt without interference, for they were an unlucky\npeople to quarrel with, and, save for one or two trespasses on the part\nof Gulabala, there was no complaint made concerning them. It is not\nnatural, however, for native people to prosper, as these folks did,\nwithout there growing up a desire to kill somebody. For does not the\nriver saying run: \"The last measure of a full granary is a measure of\nblood\"?\n\nIn the dead of a night Gulabala took three hundred spears across the\nfrontier to the Ochori village of Netcka, and returned at dawned with\nthe spears all streaky. And he brought back with him some twenty women,\nwho would have sung the death-song of their men but for the fact that\nGulabala and his warriors beat them.\n\nGulabala slept all the day, he and his spears, and woke to a grisly\nvision of consequence.\n\nHe called his people together and spoke in this wise--\n\n\"Soon Sandi and his headmen will come, and, if we are here, there will\nbe many folk hanged, for Sandi is a cruel man. Therefore let us go to a\nfar place in the forest, carrying our treasure, and when Sandi has\nforgiven us, we will come back.\"\n\nA good plan but for the sad fact that Bosambo of the Ochori was less\nthan fifty miles away at the dawn of that fatal day, and was marching\nswiftly to avenge his losses, for not only had Gulabala taken women, but\nhe had taken sixty goats, and that was unpardonable.\n\nThe scouts which Gulabala had sent out came back with the news that the\nway to sanctuary was barred by Bosambo.\n\nNow, of all the men that the Kulumbini hated, they hated none more than\nthe Chief of the Ochori. For he alone never scrupled to overlook them,\nand to dare their anger by flogging such of them as raided his territory\nin search of game.\n\n\"Ko,\" said Gulabala, deeply concerned, \"this Bosambo is Sandi's dog. Let\nus go back to our village and say we have been hunting, for Bosambo will\nnot cross into our lands for fear of Sandi's anger.\"\n\nThey reached the village, and were preparing to remove the last evidence\nof their crime--one goat looks very much like another, but women can\nspeak--when Sanders came striding down the village street, and Gulabala,\nwith his curved execution knife in his hand, stood up by the side of the\nwoman he had slain.\n\n\"O Gulabala,\" said Sanders softly, \"this is an evil thing.\"\n\nThe chief looked left and right helplessly.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said huskily, \"Bosambo and his people put me to shame, for\nthey spied on me and overlooked me. And we are proud people, who must\nnot be overlooked--thus it has been for all time.\"\n\nSanders pursed his lips and stared at the man.\n\n\"I see here a fine high tree,\" he said, \"so high that he who hangs from\nits top branch may say that no man overlooks him. There you shall hang,\nGulabala, for your proud men to see, before they also go to work for my\nKing, with chains upon their legs as long as they live.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Gulabala philosophically, \"I have lived.\"\n\nTen minutes later he went the swift way which bad chiefs go, and his\npeople were unresentful spectators.\n\n\"This is the tenth time I have had to find a new chief in this belt,\"\nsaid Sanders, pacing the deck of the _Zaire_, \"and who on earth I am to\nput in his place I do not know.\"\n\nThe _lokalis_ of the Kulumbini were already calling headmen to grand\npalaver. In the shade of the reed-thatched _lokali_ house, before the\nhollow length of tree-trunk, the player worked his flat drumsticks of\nironwood with amazing rapidity. The call trilled and rumbled, rising and\nfalling, now a patter of light musical sound, now a low grumble.\n\nBosambo came--by the river route--as Sanders was leaving the _Zaire_ to\nattend the momentous council.\n\n\"How say you, Bosambo--what man of the Kulumbini folk will hold these\npeople in check?\"\n\nBosambo squatted at his lord's feet and set his spear a-spinning.\n\n\"Lord,\" he confessed, \"I know of none, for they are a strange and\nhateful people. Whatever king you set above them they will despise. Also\nthey worship no gods or ghosts, nor have they ju-ju or fetish. And, if a\nman does not believe, how may you believe him? Lord, this I say to\nyou--set me above the Kulumbini, and I will change their hearts.\"\n\nBut Sanders shook his head.\n\n\"That may not be, Bosambo,\" he said.\n\nThe palaver was a long and weary one. There were twelve good claimants\nfor the vacant stool of office, and behind the twelve there were kinsmen\nand spears.\n\nFrom sunset to nigh on sunrise they debated the matter, and Sanders sat\npatiently through it all, awake and alert. Whether this might be said of\nBones is questionable. Bones swears that he did not sleep, and spent\nthe night, chin in hand, turning over the problem in his mind.\n\nIt is certain he was awake when Sanders gave his summing up.\n\n\"People of this land,\" said Sanders, \"four fires have been burnt since\nwe met, and I have listened to all your words. Now, you know how good it\nis that there should be one you call chief. Yet, if I take you,\nM'loomo\"--he turned to one sullen claimant--\"there will be war. And if I\ntake B'songi, there will be killing. And I have come to this mind--that\nI will appoint a king over you who shall not dwell with you nor overlook\nyou.\"\n\nTwo hundred pairs of eyes watched the Commissioner's face. He saw the\ngleam of satisfaction which came at this concession to the traditional\ncharacteristic of the tribe, and went on, almost completely sure of his\nground.\n\n\"He shall dwell far away, and you, the twelve kinsmen of Gulabala, shall\nreign in his place--one at every noon shall sit in the chief's chair and\nkeep the land for your king, who shall dwell with me.\"\n\nOne of the prospective regents rose.\n\n\"Lord, that is good talk, for so did Sakalaba, the great king of our\nrace, live apart from us at S'furi-S'foosi, and were we not prosperous\nin those days? Now tell us what man you will set over us.\"\n\nFor one moment Sanders was nonplussed. He was rapidly reviewing the\nqualifications of all the little chiefs, the headmen, and the fisher\nleaders who sat under him, and none fulfilled his requirements.\n\nIn that moment of silence an agitated voice whispered in his ear, and\nBones's lean hand clutched his sleeve.\n\n\"Sir an' Excellency,\" breathed Bones, all of a twitter, \"don't think I'm\ntakin' advantage of my position, but it's the chance I've been lookin'\nfor, sir. You'd do me an awful favour--you see, sir, I've got his career\nto consider----\"\n\n\"What on earth----\" began Sanders.\n\n\"Henry Hamilton Bones, sir,\" said Bones tremulously. \"You'd set him up\nfor life, sir. I must think of the child, hang it all! I know I'm a\njolly old rotter to put my spoke in----\"\n\nSanders gently released the frenzied grip of his lieutenant, and faced\nthe wondering palaver.\n\n\"Know all people that this day I give to you as king one whom you shall\ncall M'songuri, which means in your tongue 'The Young and the Wise,' and\nwho is called in my tongue N'risu M'ilitani Tibbetti, and this one is a\nchild and well beloved by my lord Tibbetti, being to him as a son, and\nby M'ilitani and by me, Sandi.\"\n\nHe raised his hand in challenge.\n\n\"Wa! Whose men are you?\" he cried.\n\n\"M'songuri!\"\n\nThe answer came in a deep-throated growl, and the assembly leapt to its\nfeet.\n\n\"Wa! Who rules this land?\"\n\n\"M'songuri!\"\n\nThey locked arms and stamped first with the right foot and then with the\nleft, in token of their acceptance.\n\n\"Take your king,\" said Sanders, \"and build him a beautiful hut, and his\nspirit shall dwell with you. This palaver is finished.\"\n\nBones was speechless all the way down river. At irregular intervals he\nwould grip Sanders's hand, but he was too full for speech.\n\nHamilton and his sister met the law-givers on the quay.\n\n\"You're back sooner than I expected you, sir,\" said Hamilton. \"Did Bones\nbehave?\"\n\n\"Like a little gentleman,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Oh, Bones,\" Patricia broke in eagerly, \"Henry has cut another tooth.\"\n\nBones's nod was grave and even distant.\n\n\"I will go and see His Majesty,\" he said. \"I presume he is in the\npalace?\"\n\nHamilton stared after him.\n\n\"Surely,\" he asked irritably, \"Bones isn't sickening for measles again?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE TAMER OF BEASTS\n\n\nNative folk, at any rate, are but children of a larger growth. In the\nmain, their delinquencies may be classified under the heading of\n\"naughtiness.\" They are mischievous and passionate, and they have a\nweakness for destroying things to discover the secrets of volition. A\ntoo prosperous nation mystifies less fortunate people, who demand of\ntheir elders and rulers some solution of the mystery of their rivals'\nprogress. Such a ruler, unable to offer the necessary explanation, takes\nhis spears to the discovery, and sometimes discovers too much for his\nhappiness.\n\nThe village of Jumburu stands on the edge of the bush country, where the\nlawless men of all nations dwell. This territory is filled with fierce\ncommunities, banded together against a common enemy--the law. They call\nthis land the B'wigini, which means \"the Nationless,\" and Jumburu's\nimportance lies in the fact that it is the outpost of order and\ndiscipline.\n\nIn Jumburu were two brothers, O'ka and B'suru, who had usurped the\nchieftainship of their uncle, the very famous K'sungasa, \"very famous,\"\nsince he had been in his time a man of remarkable gifts, which he still\nretained to some extent, and in consequence enjoyed what was left of\nlife.\n\nHe was, by all accounts, as mad as a man could be, and in circumstances\nless favourable to himself his concerned relatives would have taken him\na long journey into the forest he loved so well, and they would have put\nout his eyes and left him to the mercy of the beasts, such being the\nmethod of dealing with lunacy amongst people who, all unknown to\nthemselves, were eugenists of a most inflexible kind.\n\nBut to leave K'sungasa to the beasts would have been equivalent to\ndelivering him to the care of his dearest friends, for he had an\naffinity for the wild dwellers of the bush, and all his life he had\nlived amongst them and loved them.\n\nIt is said that he could arrest the parrot in the air by a \"cl'k!\" and\ncould bring the bird screeching and fluttering to his hand. He could\ncall the shy little monkeys from the high branches where they hid, and\neven the fiercest of buffaloes would at his word come snuffling and\nnosing his brown arm.\n\nSo that, when he grew weak-minded, his relatives, after a long palaver,\ndecided that for once the time-honoured customs of the land should be\noverridden, and since there was no other method of treating the blind\nbut that prescribed by precedent, he should be allowed to live in a\ngreat hut at the edge of the village with his birds and snakes and\nwild cats, and that the direction of village affairs should pass to his\nnephews.\n\nMr. Commissioner Sanders knew all this, but did nothing. His task was to\ngovern the territory, which meant to so direct affairs that the\nterritory governed itself. When the fate of K'sungasa was in the\nbalance, he sent word to the chief's nephews that he was somewhere in\nthe neighbourhood, and that the revival of the bad old custom of\nblinding would be followed by the introduction of the bad new custom of\nhanging; but this had less effect upon the council of relatives--to whom\nSanders's message was not transmitted--than the strange friendship which\nK'sungasa had for the forest folk.\n\nThe nephews might have governed the village, exacted tribute,\napportioned fishing rights, and administered justice for all time, but\nfor the fact that there came a period of famine, when crops were bad and\nfish was scarce, and when, remarkably enough, the village of L'bini,\ndistant no more than a few hours' paddling, had by a curious coincident\nraised record crops, and had, moreover, a glut of fish in their waters.\n\nThere was the inevitable palaver and the inevitable solution. O'ka and\nB'suru led ten canoes to the offending village, slaughtered a few men\nand burnt a few huts. For two hours the combatants pranced and yelled\nand thrust at one another amidst a pandemonium of screaming women, and\nthen Lieutenant Tibbetts dropped from the clouds with a most substantial\nplatoon of Houssas, and there was a general sorting out.\n\nSanders held a court on one of the middle islands near the Residency,\nand B'suru was sent to the Village of Irons for the term of his natural\nlife. O'ka, who had fled to the bush, escaped, however, and with him a\nheadman and a few followers.\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts, who had spent two profitable days in the village of\nJumburu, came back to the Residency a very thoughtful young man.\n\n\"What is the matter with Bones?\" asked Captain Hamilton.\n\nHis sister smiled over her book, but offered no other comment.\n\n\"Do you know, Pat?\" demanded Hamilton sternly.\n\nSanders looked at the girl with a twinkle in his grey eyes, and lit a\ncheroot. The relationships between Patricia Hamilton and Bones were a\nsource of constant joy to him. Taciturn and a thought dour as he was,\nPat would never have suspected the bubbling laughter which arose behind\nthat lean brown face, unmovable and, in his moments of most intense\nenjoyment, expressionless.\n\n\"Bones and I have a feud,\" said the girl.\n\nSanders smiled.\n\n\"Not as violent a feud as O'ka and I have, I hope?\" he said.\n\nShe frowned a little and looked at him anxiously.\n\n\"But you don't worry about the threats of the people you have punished?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"I haven't punished O'ka,\" said Sanders, \"and an expedition into the\nbush would be too expensive an affair. He has apparently settled with\nthe B'wigini people. If they take up his feud, they might give trouble.\nBut what is your trouble with Bones?\"\n\n\"You must ask him,\" she said.\n\nHamilton's opportunity came next day, when Bones applied for leave.\n\n\"Leave?\" said Captain Hamilton incredulously. \"Leave, Bones? What the\ndickens do you want leave for?\"\n\nBones, standing as stiff as a ramrod before the office table at which\nhis superior sat, saluted.\n\n\"Urgent private affairs, sir,\" he said gruffly.\n\n\"But you haven't any private affairs,\" protested Hamilton. \"Your life is\nan open book--you were bragging about that fact yesterday.\"\n\n\"Sir and brother-officer,\" said Bones firmly, \"a crisis has arisen in my\nyoung life. My word, sir, has been called into doubt by your jolly old\nsister. I desire to vindicate my honour, my reputation, an' my\nveracity.\"\n\n\"Pat has been pulling your leg!\" suggested Hamilton, but Bones shook his\nhead.\n\n\"Nothin' so indelicate, sir. Your revered an' lovely relative--God\nbless her jolly old heart!--expressed her doubt in _re_ leopards an'\nbuffaloes. I'm goin' out, sir, into the wilds--amidst dangers, Ham, old\nfeller, that only seasoned veterans like you an' me can imagine--to\nbring proof that I am not only a sportsman, but a gentleman.\"\n\nThe timely arrival of Miss Patricia Hamilton, very beautiful in dazzling\nwhite, with her solar helmet perched at an angle, smote Bones to\nsilence.\n\n\"What have you been saying to Bones?\" asked Hamilton severely.\n\n\"She said----\"\n\n\"I said----\"\n\nThey began and finished together.\n\n\"Bones, you're a tell-tale,\" accused the girl.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Bones recklessly. \"Don't spare me. I'm a liar an' a thief\nan' a murderer--don't mind me!\"\n\n\"I simply said that I didn't believe he shot the leopard--the one whose\nskin is in his hut.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Bones, with heavy sarcasm, \"I didn't shoot it--oh, no! I\nfroze it to death--I poisoned it!\"\n\n\"But did you shoot it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Did I shoot it, dear old Ham?\" asked Bones, with great calmness.\n\n\"Did you?\" asked Hamilton innocently.\n\n\"Did I shoot at that leopard,\" Bones went on deliberately, \"an' was he\nfound next mornin' cold an' dead, with a smile on his naughty old\nface?\"\n\nHamilton nodded, and Bones faced the girl expectantly.\n\n\"Apologize, child,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" she replied, with some heat. \"Did\nBones shoot the leopard?\"\n\nShe appealed to her brother.\n\nHamilton looked from one to the other.\n\n\"When the leopard was found----\" he began.\n\n\"Listen to this, dear old sister,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"When the leopard was found, with a spear in its side----\"\n\n\"Evidently done after death by a wanderin' cad of a native,\" interposed\nBones hastily.\n\n\"Be quiet, Bones,\" commanded the girl, and Bones shrugged his shoulders\nand obeyed.\n\n\"When the leopard was found,\" continued Hamilton, \"he was certainly\nbeyond human aid, and though no bullet mark was discovered, Bones\nconclusively proved----\"\n\n\"One moment, dear old officer,\" interrupted Bones. He had seen out of\nthe tail of his eye a majestic figure crossing the square.\n\n\"Will you allow me to produce scientific an' expert evidence?\"\n\nHamilton assented gravely, and Bones went to the door of the orderly\nroom and roared a name.\n\n\"I shall produce,\" he said quietly, but firmly, \"the evidence of one\nwho enjoyed the confidence of dear old Professor What's-his-name, the\neminent thigumy-ologist. Oh, Ali!\"\n\nAli Abid, a solemn figure, salaamed in the doorway.\n\nNot for nothing had he been factotum to a great bacteriologist before\nthe demise of his master had driven him to service with a lieutenant of\nHoussas. His vocabulary smelt of the laboratory, his English was pure,\nundefiled, and unusual.\n\n\"Ali, you remember my leopard?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, shaking his head, \"who can forget?\"\n\n\"Did I kill him, Ali?\" asked Bones. \"Tell the lady everything.\"\n\nAli bowed to the girl.\n\n\"Miss or madame,\" he said, \"the leopard (_Felis pardus_), a wild beast\nof the Felid\u00e6 family, is indigenous to forest territory. The subject in\nquestion--to wit, the skin thereof exhibited by Sir Bones--was\nparticularly ferocious, and departed this life as a result of hunting\nconducted by aforesaid. Examination of subject after demise under most\nscientific scrutiny revealed that said leopard (_Felis pardus_) suffered\nfrom weak heart, and primary cause of death was diagnosed as shock\noccasioned by large 'bang' from Sir Bones's rifle.\"\n\n\"What did I say?\" asked Bones complacently.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" gasped the girl, \"that you _frightened_ the\nleopard to death?\"\n\nBones spread out his hands disparagingly.\n\n\"You have heard the evidence, dear old sister,\" he said; \"there is\nnothing to add.\"\n\nShe threw back her head and laughed until her grey eyes were swimming in\ntears.\n\n\"Oh, Bones, you humbug!\" she laughed.\n\nBones drew himself up more stiffly than ever, stuck his monocle in his\neye, and turned to his chief.\n\n\"Do I understand, sir,\" he said, \"that my leave is granted?\"\n\n\"Seven days,\" said Hamilton, and Bones swung round on his heel, knocked\nover Hamilton's stationery rack, stumbled over a chair, and strode\ngloomily from the hut.\n\nWhen Patricia Hamilton woke the next morning, she found a note pinned to\nher pillow.\n\nWe may gloss over the impropriety of the proceedings which led to\nthis phenomenon. Bones was an artist, and so small a matter as the\nproprieties did not come into his calculations.\n\nPatricia sat up in bed and read the letter.\n\n     \"DEAR OLD FRIEND AND DOUTTING THOS.\"\n     (Bones's spelling was always perfectly disgraceful),--\n\n     \"When this reaches you, when this reaches you, I shall be far, far\n     away on my long and dangerus journey. I may not come back, I may\n     not come back, for I and a faithful servant are about to penetrate\n     to the lares of the wild beasts of the forest, of the forest. I am\n     determined to wipe out the reproach which you have made. I will\n     bring back, not a dead leppard, not a dead leppard, but a live one,\n     which I shall seeze with my own hands. I may lose my life in this\n     rash and hazardus enterprise, but at least I shall vindycate my\n     honour.--Farewell, dear old Patrisia.\n\n                               \"Your friend,\n\n                                    \"B.\"\n\n\"Which proves,\" said Hamilton, when he was shown the letter, \"that Bones\nis learning to spell. It only seems yesterday when he was spelling\n'Hamilton' with three m's. By the way, how did you get this letter?\"\n\n\"I found it pinned to the door,\" said Patricia tactfully.\n\nBones went by the shortest route to Jumburu, and was received without\nenthusiasm, for he had left a new chief to rule over a people who were\nnear enough to the B'wigini to resent overmuch discipline. But his\nbusiness was with K'sungasa, for the two days' stay which Bones had made\nin the village, and all that he had learnt of the old tamer, had been\nresponsible for his reckless promise to Patricia Hamilton.\n\nHe came at a critical moment, for K'sungasa, a thin and knobbly old man,\nwith dim eyes and an incessant chuckle, was very near his end. He lay\non a fine raised bed, a big yellow-eyed wild cat at his feet, a monkey\nor two shivering by the bedside, and a sprawling litter of kittens--to\nwhich the wild cat leapt in a tremble of rage when Bones entered the\nhut--crawling in the sunlight which flooded the hut.\n\n\"Lord Tibbetti,\" croaked the old man, \"I see you! This is a good time,\nfor to-morrow I should be dead.\"\n\n\"K'sungasa,\" said Bones, seating himself gingerly, and looking about for\nthe snake which was usually coiled round the old man's stool, \"that is\nfoolish talk, for you will see many floods.\"\n\n\"That is fine talk for the river folk,\" grinned the old man, \"but not\nfor we people of the forest, who never see flood and only little-little\nrivers. Now, I tell you, lord, that I am glad to die, because I have\nbeen full of mad thoughts for a long time, but now my mind is clear.\nTell me, master, why you come.\"\n\nBones explained his errand, and the old man's eyes brightened.\n\n\"Lord, if I could go with you to the forest, I would bring to you many\nbeautiful leopards by my magic. Now, because I love Sandi, I will do\nthis for you, so that you shall know how wise and cunning I am.\"\n\nIn the woods about the village was a wild plant, the seeds of which,\nwhen pounded and boiled in an earthen vessel, produced, by a rough\nmethod of distillation, a most pungent liquid. Abid spoke learnedly of\n_pimpinella anisum_, and probably he was right.[4]\n\n[Footnote 4: Both anise and star anise (_Illicium anisatum_) are to be\nfound in the Territories, as also is a small plant which has all the\nproperties (and more) of _Pimpinella anisum_. This was probably the\nplant.--AUTHOR.]\n\nBones and his assistant made many excursions into the woods before they\nfound and brought back the right plant. Fortunately it was seed-time,\nand once he was on the right track Bones had no difficulty in securing\nmore than a sufficient quantity for his purpose.\n\nHe made his distillation under the old man's directions, the fire\nburning in the middle of the hut. As the drops began to fall from the\nnarrow neck of his retort, a fault sweet aroma filled the hut. First the\ncat, then the monkeys began to show signs of extraordinary agitation.\nCat and kittens crouched as near the fire as they could, their heads\ncraned towards the brown vessel, mewing and whimpering. Then the monkeys\ncame, bright-eyed and eager.\n\nThe scent brought the most unexpected beasts from every hole and crevice\nin the hut--brown rats, squirrels, a long black snake with spade-shaped\nhead and diamond markings, little bush hares, a young buck, which came\ncrashing through the forest and prinked timidly to the door of the hut.\n\nThe old man on the bed called them all by name, and snapped his feeble\nfingers to them; but their eyes were on the retort and the crystal\ndrops that trembled and fell from the lip of the narrow spout.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA week later a speechless group stood before the Residency and focussed\ntheir astonished gaze upon the miracle.\n\n\"The miracle\" was a half-grown leopard cub, vividly marked. He was\nmuzzled and held in leash by a chain affixed to a stout collar, and\nBones, a picture of smug gratification, held the end of the chain.\n\n\"But how--how did you catch him?\" gasped the girl.\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It is not for me, dear old friend, to tell of nights spent in the\nhowlin' forest,\" he quavered, in the squeaky tone which invariably came\nto him when he was excited. \"I'm not goin' to speak of myself. If you\nexpect me to tell you how I trailed the jolly old leopard to his grisly\nlair an' fought with him single-handed, you'll be disappointed.\"\n\n\"But did you track him to his lair?\" demanded Hamilton, recovering his\nspeech.\n\n\"I beg of you, dear old officer, to discuss other matters,\" evaded Bones\ntactfully. \"Here are the goods delivered, as per mine of the\ntwenty-fourth instant.\"\n\nHe put his hand to his pocket mechanically, and the cub looked up with a\nquick eager stare.\n\n\"Bones, you're a wonderful fellow,\" said Sanders quietly.\n\nBones bowed.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"if you'll excuse me, I'll take my little friend to\nhis new home.\"\n\nBefore they realized what he was doing, he had slipped off the chain.\nEven Sanders stepped back and dropped his hand to the automatic pistol\nhe carried in his hip pocket.\n\nBut Bones, unconcerned, whistled and marched off to his hut, and the\ngreat cat followed humbly at his heels.\n\nThat same night Bones strode across from his hut to the Residency,\nresolved upon a greater adventure yet. He would go out under the\nadmiring eyes of Patricia Hamilton, and would return from the Residency\nwoods a veritable Pied Piper, followed by a trail of forest denizens.\n\nIn his pocket was a quart bottle, and his clothes reeked with the scent\nof wild aniseed. As a matter of fact, his secret would have been out the\nmoment he entered Sanders's dining-room, but it so happened that his\nprogramme was doomed to interruption.\n\nHe was half-way across the square when a dark figure rose from the\nground and a harsh voice grunted \"Kill!\"\n\nHe saw the flash of the spear in the starlight and leapt aside. A hand\nclutched at his jacket, but he wrenched himself free, leaving the\ngarment in his assailant's hands.\n\nHe was unarmed, and there was nothing left but flight.\n\nSanders heard his yell, and sprang out to the darkness of the verandah\nas Bones flew up the steps.\n\nHe saw the two men racing in pursuit, and fired twice. One man fell, the\nother swerved and was lost in the shadows.\n\nAn answering shot came from the Houssa sentry at the far end of the\nsquare. Sanders saw a man running, and fired again, and again missed.\n\nThen out of the darkness blundered Ali Abid, his face grey with fear.\n\n\"Sir,\" he gasped, \"wild animal (_Felis pardus_) has divested muzzlement\nand proper restraint, and is chasing various subjects outrageously.\"\n\nEven as he spoke a fourth figure sped across the ground before the\nResidency, so close that they could see the bundle he carried under his\narm.\n\n\"My jacket!\" roared Bones. \"Hi, stop him! Good Lord!\"\n\nSwift on the heels of the flying man came a streak of yellow fur....\n\nWhether O'ka of the Jumburu outpaced the leopard, or the leopard\novertook O'ka, is not known, but until the rains came and washed away\nthe scent of crude aniseed, Bones dared not leave his hut by night for\nfear of the strange beasts that came snuffling at his hut, or sat in\nexpectant and watchful circles about his dwelling, howling dismally.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MERCENARIES\n\n\nThere was a large brown desk in Sanders's study, a desk the edges of\nwhich had been worn yellow with constant rubbing. It was a very tidy\ndesk, with two rows of books neatly grouped on the left and on the\nright, and held in place by brass rails. There were three tiers of wire\nbaskets, a great white blotting-pad, a silver inkstand and four\nclean-looking pens.\n\nLately, there had appeared a glass vase filled with flowers which were\ndaily renewed. Except on certain solemn occasions, none intruded into\nthis holy of holies. It is true that a change had been brought about by\nthe arrival of Patricia Hamilton, for she had been accorded permission\nto use the study as she wished, and she it was who had introduced the\nfloral decorations.\n\nYet, such was the tradition of sanctuary which enveloped the study, that\nneither Captain Hamilton, her brother, nor Bones, her slave, had ever\nventured to intrude thither in search of her, and if by chance they came\nto the door to speak to her, they unaccountably lowered their voices.\n\nOn a certain summer morning, Hamilton sat at the desk, a stern and sober\nfigure, and Bones, perspiring and rattled, sat on the edge of a chair\nfacing him.\n\nThe occasion was a solemn one, for Bones was undergoing his examination\nin subjects \"X\" and \"Y\" for promotion to the rank of Captain. The\nparticular subject under discussion was \"Map Reading and Field\nSketching,\" and the inquisition was an oral one.\n\n\"Lieutenant Tibbetts,\" said Hamilton gravely, \"you will please define a\nBase Line.\"\n\nBones pushed back the hair straggling over his forehead, and blinked\nrapidly in an effort of memory.\n\n\"A base line, dear old officer?\" he repeated. \"A base line, dear old\nHam----\"\n\n\"Restrain your endearing terms,\" said Hamilton, \"you won't get any extra\nmarks for 'em.\"\n\n\"A base line?\" mused Bones; then, \"Whoop! I've got it! God bless your\njolly old soul! I thought I'd foozled it. A base line,\" he said loudly,\n\"is the difference of level between two adjacent contours. How's that,\numpire?\"\n\n\"Wrong,\" said Hamilton; \"you're describing a Vertical Interval.\"\n\nBones glared at him.\n\n\"Are you sure, dear old chap?\" he demanded truculently. \"Have a look at\nthe book, jolly old friend, your poor old eyes ain't what they used to\nbe----\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Tibbetts,\" said Hamilton in ponderous reproof, \"you are\nbehaving very strangely.\"\n\n\"Look here, dear old Ham,\" wheedled Bones \"can't you pretend you asked\nme what a Vertical Interval was?\"\n\nHamilton reached round to find something to throw, but this was\nSanders's study.\n\n\"You have a criminal mind, Bones,\" he said helplessly. \"Now get on with\nit. What are 'Hachures'?\"\n\n\"Hachures?\" said Bones, shutting his eye. \"Hachures? Now I know what\nHachures are. A lot of people would think they were chickens, but I\nknow ... they're a sort of line ... when you're drawing a hill ...\nwiggly-waggly lines ... you know the funny things ... a sort of....\"\nBones made mysterious and erratic gestures in the air, \"shading ...\nwater, dear old friend.\"\n\n\"Are you feeling faint?\" asked Hamilton, jumping up in alarm.\n\n\"No, silly ass ... shadings ... direction of water--am I right, sir?\"\n\n\"Not being a thought-reader I can't visualize your disordered mind,\"\nsaid Hamilton, \"but Hachures are the conventional method of representing\nhill features by shading in short vertical lines to indicate the slope\nand the water flow. I gather that you have a hazy idea of what the\nanswer should be.\"\n\n\"I thank you, dear old sir, for that generous tribute to my grasp\nof military science,\" said Bones. \"An' now proceed to the next\ntorture--which will you have, sir, rack or thumbscrew?--oh, thank\nyou, Horace, I'll have a glass of boiling oil.\"\n\n\"Shut up talking to yourself,\" growled Hamilton, \"and tell me what is\nmeant by 'Orienting a Map'?\"\n\n\"Turning it to the east,\" said Bones promptly. \"Next, sir.\"\n\n\"What is meant by 'Orienting a Map'?\" asked Hamilton patiently.\n\n\"I've told you once,\" said Bones defiantly.\n\n\"Orienting a Map,\" said Hamilton, \"as I have explained to you a thousand\ntimes, means setting your map or plane-table so that the north line lies\nnorth.\"\n\n\"In that case, sir,\" said Bones firmly, \"the east line would be east,\nand I claim to have answered the question to your entire satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Continue to claim,\" snarled Hamilton. \"I shall mark you zero for that\nanswer.\"\n\n\"Make it one,\" pleaded Bones. \"Be a sport, dear old Ham--I've found a\nnew fishin' pool.\"\n\nHamilton hesitated.\n\n\"There never are any fish in the pools you find,\" he said dubiously.\n\"Anyway, I'll reserve my decision until I've made a cast or two.\"\n\nThey adjourned for tiffin soon after.\n\n\"How did you do, Bones?\" asked Patricia Hamilton.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Bones enthusiastically; \"I simply bowled over every\nquestion that your dear old brother asked. In fact, Ham admitted that I\nknew much more about some things than he did.\"\n\n\"What I said,\" corrected Hamilton, \"was that your information on certain\nsubjects was so novel that I doubted whether even the staff college\nshared it.\"\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" said Bones.\n\n\"You should try him on military history,\" suggested Sanders dryly. \"I've\njust been hearing from Bosambo----\"\n\nBones coughed and blushed.\n\n\"The fact is, sir an' Excellency,\" he confessed, \"I was practisin' on\nBosambo. You mightn't be aware of the fact, but I like to hear myself\nspeak----\"\n\n\"No!\" gasped Hamilton in amazement, \"you're wronging yourself, Bones!\"\n\n\"What I mean, sir,\" Bones went on with dignity, \"is that if I lecture\nsomebody on a subject I remember what I've said.\"\n\n\"Always providing that you understand what you're saying,\" suggested\nHamilton.\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Sanders, with his quiet smile, \"Bones has filled Bosambo\nwith a passionate desire to emulate Napoleon, and Bosambo has been\nmaking tentative inquiries as to whether he can raise an Old Guard or\nenlist a mercenary army.\"\n\n\"I flatter myself----\" began Bones.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Hamilton, rising. \"It's the only chance you'll have of\nhearing something complimentary about yourself.\"\n\n\"_I_ believe in you, Bones,\" said a smiling Patricia. \"I think you're\nreally wonderful, and that Ham is a brute.\"\n\n\"I'll never, never contradict you, dear Miss Patricia,\" said Bones; \"an'\nafter the jolly old Commissioner has gone----\"\n\n\"You're not going away again, are you?\" she asked, turning to Sanders.\n\"Why, you have only just come back from the interior.\"\n\nThere was genuine disappointment in her eyes, and Sanders experienced a\nstrange thrill the like of which he had never known before.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said with a nod. \"There is a palaver of sorts in the Morjaba\ncountry--the most curious palaver I have ever been called upon to hold.\"\n\nAnd indeed he spoke the truth.\n\nBeyond the frontiers of the Akasava, and separated from all the other\nTerritories by a curious bush belt which ran almost in a straight line\nfor seventy miles, were the people of Morjaba. They were a folk isolated\nfrom territorial life, and Sanders saw them once every year and no more\nfrequently, for they were difficult to come by, regular payers of taxes\nand law-abiding, having quarrels with none. The bush (reputedly the\nabode of ghosts) was, save at one point, impenetrable. Nature had\nplaited a natural wall on one side, and had given the tribe the\nprotection of high mountains to the north and a broad swamp to the\nwest.\n\nThe fierce storms of passion and hate which burst upon the river at\nintervals and sent thousands of spears to a blooding, were scarcely\nechoed in this sanctuary-land. The marauders of the Great King's country\nto the north never fetched across the smooth moraine of the mountains,\nand the evil people of The-Land-beyond-the-Swamp were held back by the\ntreacherous bogland wherein, _cala-cala_, a whole army had been\nswallowed up.\n\nThus protected, the Morjabian folk grew fat and rich. The land was a\nveritable treasure of Nature, and it is a fact that in the dialect they\nspeak, there is no word which means \"hunger.\"[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: It is as curious a fact that amongst the majority of\ncannibal people there is no equivalent for \"thank you.\"--E. W.]\n\nYet the people of the Morjaba were not without their crises.\n\nS'kobi, the stout chief, held a great court which was attended by ten\nthousand people, for at that court was to be concluded for ever the feud\nbetween the M'gimi and the M'joro--a feud which went back for the\ngreater part of fifty years.\n\nThe M'gimi were the traditional warrior tribe, the bearers of arms, and,\nas their name (\"The High Lookers\") implied, the proudest and most\nexclusive of the people. For every man was the descendant of a chief,\nand it was \"easier for fish to walk,\" as the saying goes, than for a\nman of the M'joro (\"The Diggers\") to secure admission to the caste.\nThree lateral cuts on either cheek was the mark of the M'gimi--wounds\nmade, upon the warrior's initiation to the order, with the razor-edged\nblade of a killing-spear. They lived apart in three camps to the number\nof six thousand men, and for five years from the hour of their\ninitiation they neither married nor courted. The M'gimi turned their\nbacks to women, and did not suffer their presence in their camps. And if\nany man departed from this austere rule he was taken to the Breaking\nTree, his four limbs were fractured, and he was hoisted to the lower\nbranches, between which a litter was swung, and his regiment sat beneath\nthe tree neither eating, drinking nor sleeping until he died. Sometimes\nthis was a matter of days. As for the woman who had tempted his eye and\nhis tongue, she was a witness.\n\nThus the M'gimi preserved their traditions of austerity. They were\nfamous walkers and jumpers. They threw heavy spears and fought great\nsham-fights, and they did every violent exercise save till the ground.\n\nThis was the sum and substance of the complaint which had at last come\nto a head.\n\nS'gono, the spokesman of The Diggers, was a headman of the inner lands,\nand spoke with bitter prejudice, since his own son had been rejected by\nthe M'gimi captains as being unworthy.\n\n\"Shall we men dig and sow for such as these?\" he asked. \"Now give a\njudgment, King! Every moon we must take the best of our fruit and the\nfinest of our fish. Also so many goats and so much salt, and it is\nswallowed up.\"\n\n\"Yet if I send them away,\" said the king, \"how shall I protect this land\nagainst the warriors of the Akasava and the evil men of the swamp? Also\nof the Ochori, who are four days' march across good ground?\"\n\n\"Lord King,\" said S'gono, \"are there no M'gimi amongst us who have\npassed from the camp and have their women and their children? May not\nthese take the spear again? And are not we M'joro folk men? By my life!\nI will raise as many spears from The Diggers and captain them with\nM'joro men--this I could do between the moons and none would say that\nyou were not protected. For we are men as bold as they.\"\n\nThe king saw that the M'gimi party was in the minority. Moreover, he had\nlittle sympathy with the warrior caste, for his beginnings were basely\nrooted in the soil, and two of his sons had no more than scraped into\nthe M'gimi.\n\n\"This thing shall be done,\" said the king, and the roar of approval\nwhich swept up the little hillock on which he sat was his reward.\n\nSanders, learning something of these doings, had come in haste, moving\nacross the Lower Akasava by a short cut, risking the chagrin of certain\nchiefs and friends who would be shocked and mortified by his apparent\nlack of courtesy in missing the ceremonious call which was their due.\n\nBut his business was very urgent, otherwise he would not have travelled\nby Nobolama--The-River-that-comes-and-goes.\n\nHe was fortunate in that he found deep water for the _Wiggle_ as far as\nthe edge of this pleasant land. A two days' trek through the forest\nbrought him to the great city of Morjaba. In all the Territories there\nwas no such city as this, for it stretched for miles on either hand, and\nindeed was one of the most densely populated towns within a radius of\nfive hundred miles.\n\nS'kobi came waddling to meet his governor with maize, plucked in haste\nfrom the gardens he passed, and salt, grabbed at the first news of\nSanders's arrival, in his big hands. These he extended as he puffed to\nwhere Sanders sat at the edge of the city.\n\n\"Lord,\" he wheezed, \"none came with news of this great honour, or my\nyoung men would have met you, and my maidens would have danced the road\nflat with their feet. Take!\"\n\nSanders extended both palms and received the tribute of salt and corn,\nand solemnly handed the crushed mess to his orderly.\n\n\"O S'kobi,\" he said, \"I came swiftly to make a secret palaver with you,\nand my time is short.\"\n\n\"Lord, I am your man,\" said S'kobi, and signalled his councillors and\nelder men to a distance.\n\nSanders was in some difficulty to find a beginning.\n\n\"You know, S'kobi, that I love your people as my children,\" he said,\n\"for they are good folk who are faithful to government and do ill to\nnone.\"\n\n\"Wa!\" said S'kobi.\n\n\"Also you know that spearmen and warriors I do not love, for spears are\nwar and warriors are great lovers of fighting.\"\n\n\"Lord, you speak the truth,\" said the other, nodding, \"therefore in this\nland I will have made a law that there shall be no spears, save those\nwhich sleep in the shadow of my hut. Now well I know why you have come\nto make this palaver, for you have heard with your beautiful long ears\nthat I have sent away my fighting regiments.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"You speak truly, my friend,\" he said, and S'kobi beamed.\n\n\"Six times a thousand spears I had--and, lord, spears grow no corn.\nRather are they terrible eaters. And now I have sent them to their\nvillages, and at the next moon they should have burnt their fine\nwar-knives, but for a certain happening. We folk of Morjaba have no\nenemies, and we do good to all. Moreover, lord, as you know, we have\namongst us many folk of the Isisi, of the Akasava and the N'gombi, also\nmen from the Great King's land beyond the High Rocks, and the little\nfolk from The-Land-beyond-the-Swamp. Therefore, who shall attack us\nsince we have kinsmen of all amongst us?\"\n\nSanders regarded the jovial king with a sad little smile.\n\n\"Have I done well by all men?\" he asked quietly. \"Have I not governed\nthe land so that punishment comes swiftly to those who break the law?\nYet, S'kobi, do not the Akasava and the Isisi, the N'gombi and the Lower\nRiver folk take their spears against me? Now I tell you this which I\nhave discovered. In all beasts great and little there are mothers who\nhave young ones and fathers who fight that none shall harass the\nmother.\"\n\n\"Lord, this is the way of life,\" said S'kobi.\n\n\"It is the way of the Bigger Life,\" said Sanders, \"and greatly the way\nof man-life. For the women bring children to the land and the men sit\nwith their spears ready to fight all who would injure their women. And\nso long as life lasts, S'kobi, the women will bear and the men will\nguard; it is the way of Nature, and you shall not take from men the\ndesire for slaughter until you have dried from the hearts of women the\nyearning for children.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said S'kobi, a fat man and easily puzzled, \"what shall be the\nanswer to this strange riddle you set me?\"\n\n\"Only this,\" said Sanders rising, \"I wish peace in this land, but there\ncan be no peace between the leopard who has teeth and claws and the\nrabbit who has neither tooth nor claw. Does the leopard fight the lion\nor the lion the leopard? They live in peace, for each is terrible in\nhis way, and each fears the other. I tell you this, that you live in\nlove with your neighbours not because of your kindness, but because of\nyour spears. Call them back to your city, S'kobi.\"\n\nThe chief's large face wrinkled in a frown.\n\n\"Lord,\" he said, \"that cannot be, for these men have marched away from\nmy country to find a people who will feed them, for they are too proud\nto dig the ground.\"\n\n\"Oh, damn!\" said Sanders in despair, and went back the way he came,\nfeeling singularly helpless.\n\nThe Odyssey of the discarded army of the Morjaba has yet to be written.\nParadoxically enough, its primary mission was a peaceful one, and when\nit found first the frontiers of the Akasava and then the river borders\nof the Isisi closed against it, it turned to the north in an endeavour to\nfind service under the Great King, beyond the mountains. Here it was\nrepulsed and its pacific intentions doubted. The M'gimi formed a camp a\nday's march from the Ochori border, and were on the thin line which\nseparates unemployment from anarchy when Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori,\nwho had learnt of their presence, came upon the scene.\n\nBosambo was a born politician. He had the sense of opportunity and that\nstrange haze of hopeful but indefinite purpose which is the foundation\nof the successful poet and statesman, but which, when unsuccessfully\ndeveloped, is described as \"temperament.\"\n\nBones, paying a business call upon the Ochori, found a new township\ngrown up on the forest side of the city. He also discovered evidence of\ndiscontent in Bosambo's harassed people, who had been called upon to\nprovide fish and meal for the greater part of six thousand men who were\ntoo proud to work.\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo, \"I have often desired such an army as this, for\nmy Ochori fighters are few. Now, lord, with these men I can hold the\nUpper River for your King, and Sandi and none dare speak against him.\nThus would N'poloyani, who is your good friend, have done.\"\n\n\"But who shall feed these men, Bosambo?\" demanded Bones hastily.\n\n\"All things are with God,\" replied Bosambo piously.\n\nBones collected all the available information upon the matter and took\nit back to headquarters.\n\n\"H'm,\" said Sanders when he had concluded his recital, \"if it were any\nother man but Bosambo ... you would require another battalion,\nHamilton.\"\n\n\"But what has Bosambo done?\" asked Patricia Hamilton, admitted to the\ncouncil.\n\n\"He is being Napoleonic,\" said Sanders, with a glance at the youthful\nauthority on military history, and Bones squirmed and made strange\nnoises. \"We will see how it works out. How on earth is he going to feed\nthem, Bones?\"\n\n\"Exactly the question I asked, sir an' Excellency,\" said Bones in\ntriumph. \"'Why, you silly old ass----'\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon!\" exclaimed the startled Sanders.\n\n\"That is what I said to Bosambo, sir,\" explained Bones hastily. \"'Why,\nyou silly old ass,' I said, 'how are you going to grub 'em?' 'Lord\nBones,' said Bosambo, 'that's the jolly old problem that I'm workin'\nout.'\"\n\nHow Bosambo worked out his problem may be gathered.\n\n\"There is some talk of an Akasava rising,\" said Sanders at breakfast one\nmorning. \"I don't know why this should be, for my information is that\nthe Akasava folk are fairly placid.\"\n\n\"Where does the news come from, sir?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"From the Isisi king--he's in a devil of a funk, and has begged Bosambo\nto send him help.\"\n\nThat help was forthcoming in the shape of Bosambo's new army, which\narrived on the outskirts of the Isisi city and sat in idleness for a\nmonth, at the end of which time the people of the Isisi represented to\ntheir king that they would, on the whole, prefer war to a peace which\nput them on half rations in order that six thousand proud warriors might\nlive on the fat of the land.\n\nThe M'gimi warriors marched back to the Ochori, each man carrying a\nmonth's supply of maize and salt, wrung from the resentful peasants of\nthe Isisi.\n\nThree weeks after, Bosambo sent an envoy to the King of the Akasava.\n\n\"Let no man know this, Gubara, lest it come to the ears of Sandi, and\nyou, who are very innocent, be wrongly blamed,\" said the envoy solemnly.\n\"Thus says Bosambo: It has come to my ears that the N'gombi are secretly\narming and will very soon send a forest of spears against the Akasava.\nSay this to Gubara, that because my stomach is filled with sorrow I will\nhelp him. Because I am very powerful, because of my friendship with\nBonesi and his cousin, N'poloyani, who is also married to Bonesi's aunt,\nI have a great army which I will send to the Akasava, and when the\nN'gombi hear of this they will send away their spears and there will be\npeace.\"\n\nThe Akasava chief, a nervous man with the memory of all the discomforts\nwhich follow tribal wars, eagerly assented. For two months Bosambo's\narmy sat down like a cloud of locusts and ate the Akasava to a condition\nbordering upon famine.\n\nAt the end of that time they marched to the N'gombi country, news having\nbeen brought by Bosambo's messengers that the Great King was crossing\nthe western mountains with a terrible army to seize the N'gombi forests.\nHow long this novel method of provisioning his army might have continued\nmay only be guessed, for in the midst of Bosambo's plans for maintaining\nan army at the expense of his neighbours there was a great happening in\nthe Morjaba country.\n\nS'kobi, the fat chief, had watched the departure of his warriors with\nsomething like relief. He was gratified, moreover (native-like), by the\nfact that he had confounded Sanders. But when the Commissioner had gone\nand S'kobi remembered all that he had said, a great doubt settled like a\npall upon his mind. For three days he sat, a dejected figure, on the\nhigh carved stool of state before his house, and at the end of that time\nhe summoned S'gono, the M'joro.\n\n\"S'gono,\" said he, \"I am troubled in my stomach because of certain\nthings which our lord Sandi has said.\"\n\nThereupon he told the plebeian councillor much of what Sanders had said.\n\n\"And now my M'gimi are with Bosambo of the Ochori, and he sells them to\nthis people and that for so much treasure and food.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said S'gono, \"is my word nothing? Did I not say that I would\nraise spears more wonderful than the M'gimi? Give me leave, King, and\nyou shall find an army that shall grow in a night. I, S'gono, son of\nMocharlabili Yoka, say this!\"\n\nSo messengers went forth to all the villages of the Morjaba calling the\nyoung men to the king's hut, and on the third week there stood on a\nplateau beneath the king's palaver house a most wonderful host.\n\n\"Let them march across the plain and make the Dance of Killing,\" said\nthe satisfied king, and S'gono hesitated.\n\n\"Lord King,\" he pleaded, \"these are new soldiers, and they are not yet\nwise in the ways of warriors. Also they will not take the chiefs I gave\nthem, but have chosen their own, so that each company have two leaders\nwho say evil things of one another.\"\n\nS'kobi opened his round eyes.\n\n\"The M'gimi did not do this,\" he said dubiously, \"for when their\ncaptains spoke they leapt first with one leg and then with the other,\nwhich was beautiful to see and very terrifying to our enemies.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" begged the agitated S'gono, \"give me the space of a moon and\nthey shall leap with both legs and dance in a most curious manner.\"\n\nA spy retailed this promise to a certain giant chief of the Great King\nwho was sitting on the Morjaba slopes of the mountains with four\nthousand spears, awaiting a favourable moment to ford the river which\nseparated him from the rich lands of the northern Morjaba.\n\nThis giant heard the tidings with interest.\n\n\"Soon they shall leap without heads,\" he said, \"for without the\nM'gimi they are little children. For twenty seasons we have waited,\nand now comes our fine night. Go you, B'furo, to the Chief of\nThe-Folk-beyond-the-Swamp and tell him that when he sees three fires on\nthis mountain he shall attack across the swamp by the road which he\nknows.\"\n\nIt was a well-planned campaign which the Great King's generals and the\nChief of The-People-beyond-the-Marsh had organized. With the passing of\nthe warrior caste the enemies of the Morjaba had moved swiftly. The path\nacross the swamp had been known for years, but the M'gimi had had one of\ntheir camps so situated that no enemy could debouch across, and had so\nordered their dispositions that the northern river boundary was\nautomatically safeguarded.\n\nNow S'gono was a man of the fields, a grower and seller of maize and a\nbreeder of goats. And he had planned his new army as he would plan a new\ngarden, on the basis that the nearer the army was to the capital, the\neasier it was to maintain. In consequence the river-ford was unguarded,\nand there were two thousand spears across the marshes before a scared\nminister of war apprehended any danger.\n\nHe flung his new troops against the Great King's chief captain in a\ndesperate attempt to hold back the principal invader. At the same time,\nmore by luck than good generalship, he pushed the evil people of the\nmarsh back to their native element.\n\nFor two days the Morjaba fought desperately if unskilfully against the\nseasoned troops of the Great King, while messengers hurried east and\nsouth, seeking help.\n\nBosambo's intelligence department may have shown remarkable prescience\nin unearthing the plot against the peace and security of the Morjaba, or\nit may have been (and this is Sanders's theory) that Bosambo was on his\nway to the Morjaba with a cock and bull story of imminent danger. He was\non the frontier when the king's messenger came, and Bosambo returned\nwith the courier to treat in person.\n\n\"Five thousand loads of corn I will give you, Bosambo,\" said the king,\n\"also a hundred bags of salt. Also two hundred women who shall be slaves\nin your house.\"\n\nThere was some bargaining, for Bosambo had no need of slaves, but\nurgently wanted goats. In the end he brought up his hirelings, and the\npeople of the Morjaba city literally fell on the necks of the returned\nM'gimi.\n\nThe enemy had forced the northern defences and were half-way to the city\nwhen the M'gimi fell upon their flank.\n\nThe giant chief of the Great King's army saw the ordered ranks of the\nold army driving in his flank, and sent for his own captain.\n\n\"Go swiftly to our lord, the King, and say that I am a dead man.\"\n\nHe spoke no more than the truth, for he fell at the hand of Bosambo, who\nmade a mental resolve to increase his demand on the herds of S'kobi in\nconsequence.\n\nFor the greater part of a month Bosambo was a welcome visitor, and at\nthe end of that time he made his preparations to depart.\n\nCarriers and herdsmen drove or portered his reward back to the Ochori\ncountry, marching one day ahead of the main body.\n\nThe M'gimi were summoned for the march at dawn, but at dawn Bosambo\nfound himself alone on the plateau, save for the few Ochori headmen who\nhad accompanied him on his journey.\n\n\"Lord,\" said S'kobi, \"my fine soldiers do not go with you, for I have\nseen how wise is Sandi who is my father and my mother.\"\n\nBosambo choked, and as was usual in moments of intense emotion, found\nrefuge in English.\n\n\"Dam' nigger!\" he said wrathfully, \"I bring um army, I feed um, I keep\num proper--you pinch um! Black t'ief! Pig! You bad feller! I speak you\nbad for N'poloyani--him fine feller.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the uncomprehending king, \"I see that you are like Sandi\nfor you speak his tongue. He also said 'Dam' very loudly. I think it is\nthe word white folk say when they are happy.\"\n\nBosambo met Bones hurrying to the scene of the fighting, and told his\ntale.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he in conclusion, \"what was I to do, for you told nothing\nof the ways of N'poloyani when his army was stolen from him. Tell me\nnow, Tibbetti, what this man would have done.\"\n\nBut Bones shook his head severely.\n\n\"This I cannot tell you, Bosambo,\" he said, \"for if I do you will tell\nothers, and my lord N'poloyani will never forgive me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE WATERS OF MADNESS\n\n\nUnexpected things happen in the Territories which Mr. Commissioner\nSanders rules. As for example: Bones had gone down to the beach to \"take\nthe mail.\" This usually meant no more than receiving a mail-bag wildly\nflung from a dancing surf-boat. On this occasion Bones was surprised to\ndiscover that the boat had beached and had landed, not only the mail,\nbut a stranger with his baggage.\n\nHe was a clean-shaven, plump man, in spotless white, and he greeted\nBones with a friendly nod. \"Morning!\" he said. \"I've got your mail.\"\n\nBones extended his hand and took the bag without evidence of any\nparticular enthusiasm.\n\n\"Sanders about?\" asked the stranger.\n\n\"Mr. Sanders is in residence, sir,\" said Bones, ponderously polite.\n\nThe other laughed. \"Show the way,\" he said briskly.\n\nBones looked at the new-comer from the ventilator of his pith helmet to\nthe soles of his pipe-clayed shoes. \"Excuse me, dear old sir,\" he said,\n\"have I the honour of addressin' the Secretary of State for War?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the other in surprise. \"What made you think that?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Bones, with rising wrath, \"he's the only fellow that\nneedn't say 'please' to me.\"\n\nThe man roared with laughter. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"_Please_ show me the\nway.\"\n\n\"Follow me, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nSanders was not \"in residence,\" being, in fact, inspecting some\nrecent--and native--repairs to the boilers of the _Zaire_.\n\nThe stranger drew up a chair on the stoep without invitation and seated\nhimself. He looked around. Patricia Hamilton was at the far end of the\nstoep, reading a book. She had glanced up just long enough to note and\nwonder at the new arrival. \"Deuced pretty girl that,\" said the stranger,\nlighting a cigar.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Bones.\n\n\"I say that is a deuced pretty girl,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"And you're a deuced brute, dear sir,\" said Bones, \"but hitherto I have\nnot commented on the fact.\"\n\nThe man looked up quickly. \"What are you here,\" he asked--\"a clerk or\nsomething?\"\n\nBones did not so much as flush. \"Oh, no,\" he said sweetly. \"I am an\nofficer of Houssas--rank, lieutenant. My task is to tame the uncivilized\nbeast an' entertain the civilized pig with a selection of music. Would\nyou like to hear our gramophone?\"\n\nThe new-comer frowned. What brilliant effort of persiflage was to follow\nwill never be known, for at that moment came Sanders.\n\nThe stranger rose and produced a pocket-book, from which he extracted a\ncard and a letter. \"Good morning, Commissioner!\" he said. \"My name's\nCorklan--P. T. Corklan, of Corklan, Besset and Lyons.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"I've got a letter for you,\" said the man.\n\nSanders took the note, opened it, and read. It bore the neat signature\nof an Under-Secretary of State and the embossed heading of the\nExtra-Territorial Office, and it commended Mr. P. T. Corklan to Mr.\nCommissioner Sanders, and requested him to let Mr. Corklan pass without\nlet or hindrance through the Territories, and to render him every\nassistance \"compatible with exigencies of the Service\" in his \"inquiries\ninto sugar production from the sweet potato.\"\n\n\"You should have taken this to the Administrator,\" said Sanders, \"and it\nshould bear his signature.\"\n\n\"There's the letter,\" said the man shortly. \"If that's not enough, and\nthe signature of the Secretary of State isn't sufficient, I'm going\nstraight back to England and tell him so.\"\n\n\"You may go to the devil and tell him so,\" said Sanders calmly; \"but\nyou do not pass into these Territories until I have received telegraphic\nauthority from my chief. Bones, take this man to your hut, and let your\npeople do what they can for him.\" And he turned and walked into the\nhouse.\n\n\"You shall hear about this,\" said Mr. Corklan, picking up his baggage.\n\n\"This way, dear old pilgrim,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Who's going to carry my bag?\"\n\n\"Your name escapes me,\" said Bones, \"but, if you'll glance at your\nvisitin' card, you will find the name of the porter legibly inscribed.\"\n\nSanders compressed the circumstances into a hundred-word telegram worded\nin his own economical style.\n\nIt happened that the Administrator was away on a shooting trip, and it\nwas his cautious secretary who replied--\n\n\"Administration to Sanders.--Duplicate authority here. Let Corklan\nproceed at own risk. Warn him dangers.\"\n\n\"You had better go along and tell him,\" said Sanders. \"He can leave at\nonce, and the sooner the better.\"\n\nBones delivered the message. The man was sitting on his host's bed, and\nthe floor was covered with cigar ash. Worst abomination of all, was a\nlarge bottle of whisky, which he had produced from one of his bags, and\na reeking glass, which he had produced from Bones's sideboard.\n\n\"So I can go to-night, can I?\" said Mr. Corklan. \"That's all right. Now,\nwhat about conveyance, hey?\"\n\nBones had now reached the stage where he had ceased to be annoyed, and\nwhen he found some interest in the situation. \"What sort of conveyance\nwould you like, sir?\" he asked curiously.\n\n(If you can imagine him pausing half a bar before every \"sir,\" you may\nvalue its emphasis.)\n\n\"Isn't there a steamer I can have?\" demanded the man. \"Hasn't Sanders\ngot a Government steamer?\"\n\n\"Pardon my swooning,\" said Bones, sinking into a chair.\n\n\"Well, how am I going to get up?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Are you a good swimmer?\" demanded Bones innocently.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. Corklan, \"you aren't a bad fellow. I rather like\nyou.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Bones simply.\n\n\"I rather like you,\" repeated Mr. Corklan. \"You might give me a little\nhelp.\"\n\n\"It is very unlikely that I shall,\" said Bones. \"But produce your\nproposition, dear old adventurer.\"\n\n\"That is just what I am,\" said the other. He bit off the end of another\ncigar and lit it with the glowing butt of the old one. \"I have knocked\nabout all over the world, and I have done everything. I've now a chance\nof making a fortune. There is a tribe here called the N'gombi. They\nlive in a wonderful rubber country, and I am told that they have got all\nthe ivory in the world, and stacks of rubber hidden away.\"\n\nNow, it is a fact--and Bones was surprised to hear it related by the\nstranger--that the N'gombi are great misers and hoarders of elephant\ntusks. For hundreds of years they have traded ivory and rubber, and\nevery village has its secret storehouse. The Government had tried for\nyears to wheedle the N'gombi into depositing their wealth in some State\nstore, for riches mean war sooner or later. They lived in great\nforests--the word N'gombi means \"interior\"--in lands full of elephants\nand rich in rubber trees.\n\n\"You are a regular information bureau,\" said Bones admiringly. \"But what\nhas this to do with your inquiry into the origin of the candy tree?\"\n\nThe man smoked in silence for awhile, then he pulled from his pocket a\nbig map. Again Bones was surprised, because the map he produced was the\nofficial map of the Territories. He traced the river with his fat\nforefinger.\n\n\"Here is the N'gombi country from the east bank of the Isisi, and this\nis all forest, and a rubber tree to every ten square yards.\"\n\n\"I haven't counted them,\" said Bones, \"but I'll take your word.\"\n\n\"Now, what does this mean?\" Mr. Corklan indicated a twisting line of\ndots and dashes which began at the junction of the Isisi River and the\nGreat River, and wound tortuously over five hundred miles of country\nuntil it struck the Sigi River, which runs through Spanish territory.\n\"What is that?\" he asked.\n\n\"That, or those,\" said Bones, \"are the footprints of the mighty swoozlum\nbird that barks with its eyes an' lives on buttered toast an' hardware.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what I know it is,\" said the man, looking up and\nlooking Bones straight in the eye--\"it is one of those secret rivers you\nare always finding in these 'wet' countries. The natives tell you about\n'em, but you never find 'em. They are rivers that only exist about once\nin a blue moon, when the river is very high and the rains are very\nheavy. Now, down in the Spanish territory\"--he touched Bones's knee with\ngreat emphasis--\"they tell me that their end of the secret river is in\nflood.\"\n\n\"They will tell you anything in the Spanish territory,\" said Bones\npleasantly. \"They'd tell you your jolly old fortune if you'd cross their\npalms with silver.\"\n\n\"What about your end?\" asked the man, ignoring the scepticism of his\nhost.\n\n\"Our end?\" said Bones. \"Well, you will find out for yourself. I'd hate\nto disappoint you.\"\n\n\"Now, how am I going up?\" asked the man after a pause.\n\n\"You can hire a canoe, and live on the land, unless you have brought\nstores.\"\n\nThe man chuckled. \"I've brought no stores. Here, I will show you\nsomething,\" he said. \"You are a very good fellow.\" He opened his bag and\ntook out a tight packet which looked like thin skins. There must have\nbeen two or three hundred of them. \"That's my speciality,\" he said. He\nnipped the string that tied them together, stripped one off, and,\nputting his lips to one end, blew. The skin swelled up like a toy\nballoon. \"Do you know what that is?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot say I do,\" said Bones.\n\n\"You have heard of Soemmering's process?\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"Do you know what decimal 1986 signifies?\"\n\n\"You've got me guessing, my lad,\" said Bones admiringly.\n\nThe other chuckled, threw the skins into his bag, and closed it with a\nsnap. \"That's my little joke,\" he said. \"All my friends tell me it will\nbe the death of me one of these days. I like to puzzle people\"--he\nsmiled amiably and triumphantly in Bones's face--\"I like to tell them\nthe truth in such a way they don't understand it. If they understood\nit--Heavens, there'd be the devil to pay!\"\n\n\"You are an ingenious fellow,\" said Bones, \"but I don't like your face.\nYou will forgive my frankness, dear old friend.\"\n\n\"Faces aren't fortunes,\" said the other complacently, \"and I am going\nout of this country with money sticking to me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you,\" said Bones, shaking his head; \"I hate to see\nfellows with illusions.\"\n\nHe reported all that occurred to the Commissioner, and Sanders was a\nlittle worried.\n\n\"I wish I knew what his game is,\" he said; \"I'd stop him like a shot,\nbut I can't very well in the face of the Administrator's wire. Anyway,\nhe will get nothing out of the N'gombi. I've tried every method to make\nthe beggars bank their surpluses, and I have failed.\"\n\n\"He has got to come back this way, at any rate,\" said Hamilton, \"and I\ncannot see that he will do much harm.\"\n\n\"What is the rest of his baggage like?\"\n\n\"He has a case of things that look like concave copper plates, sir,\"\nsaid Bones, \"very thin copper, but copper. Then he has two or three\ncopper pipes, and that is about his outfit.\"\n\nMr. Corklan was evidently no stranger to the coast, and Bones, who\nwatched the man's canoe being loaded that afternoon, and heard his\nfluent observations on the slackness of his paddlers, realized that his\nacquaintance with Central Africa was an extensive one. He cursed in\nSwahili and Portuguese, and his language was forcible and impolite.\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I'll be getting along. I'll make a fishing\nvillage for the night, and I ought to reach my destination in a week. I\nshan't be seeing you again, so I'll say good-bye.\"\n\n\"How do you suppose you're going to get out of the country?\" asked Bones\ncuriously.\n\nMr. Corklan laughed. \"So long!\" he said.\n\n\"One moment, my dashin' old explorer,\" said Bones. \"A little\nformality--I want to see your trunks opened.\"\n\nA look of suspicion dawned on the man's face. \"What for?\"\n\n\"A little formality, my jolly old hero,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Why didn't you say so before?\" growled the man, and had his two trunks\nlanded. \"I suppose you know you're exceeding your duty?\"\n\n\"I didn't know--thanks for tellin' me,\" said Bones. \"The fact is, sir\nan' fellow-man, I'm the Custom House officer.\"\n\nThe man opened his bags, and Bones explored. He found three bottles of\nwhisky, and these he extracted.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" asked Mr. Corklan.\n\nBones answered him by breaking the bottles on a near-by stone.\n\n\"Here, what the dickens----\"\n\n\"Wine is a mocker,\" said Bones, \"strong drink is ragin'. This is what is\ntermed in the land of Hope an' Glory a prohibition State, an' I'm\nentitled to fine you five hundred of the brightest an' best for\nattemptin' to smuggle intoxicants into our innocent country.\"\n\nBones expected an outburst; instead, his speech evoked no more than a\nsnigger.\n\n\"You're funny,\" said the man.\n\n\"My friends tell me so,\" admitted Bones. \"But there's nothin' funny\nabout drink. Acquainted as you are with the peculiar workin's of the\nnative psychology, dear sir, you will understand the primitive cravin'\nof the untutored mind for the enemy that we put in our mouths to steal\naway our silly old brains. I wish you 'bon voyage.'\"\n\n\"So long,\" said Mr. Corklan.\n\nBones went back to the Residency and made his report, and there, for the\ntime being, the matter ended. It was not unusual for wandering\nscientists, manufacturers, and representatives of shipping companies to\narrive armed with letters of introduction or command, and to be\ndispatched into the interior. The visits, happily, were few and far\nbetween. On this occasion Sanders, being uneasy, sent one of his spies\nto follow the adventurer, with orders to report any extraordinary\nhappening--a necessary step to take, for the N'gombi, and especially the\nInner N'gombi, are a secretive people, and news from local sources is\nhard to come by.\n\n\"I shall never be surprised to learn that a war has been going on in the\nN'gombi for two months without our hearing a word about it.\"\n\n\"If they fight amongst themselves--yes,\" said Captain Hamilton; \"if they\nfight outsiders, there will be plenty of bleats. Why not send Bones to\noverlook his sugar experiments,\" he added.\n\n\"Let's talk about something pleasant,\" said Bones hastily.\n\nIt was exactly three months later when he actually made the trip.\n\n\"Take the _Zaire_ up to the bend of the Isisi,\" said Sanders one\nmorning, at breakfast, \"and find out what Ali Kano is doing--the lazy\nbeggar should have reported.\"\n\n\"Any news from the N'gombi?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Only roundabout stories of their industry. Apparently the sugar\nmerchant is making big experiments. He has set half the people digging\nroots for him. Be ready to sail at dawn.\"\n\n\"Will it be a dangerous trip?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"No. Why?\" smiled Sanders.\n\n\"Because I'd like to go. Oh, please, don't look so glum! Bones is\nawfully good to me.\"\n\n\"Better than a jolly old brother,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"H'm!\" Sanders shook his head, and she appealed to her brother.\n\n\"Please!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind your going,\" said Hamilton, \"if only to look after\nBones.\"\n\n\"S-sh!\" said Bones reproachfully.\n\n\"If you're keen on it, I don't see why you shouldn't--if you had a\nchaperon.\"\n\n\"A chaperon!\" sneered Bones. \"Great Heavens! Do, old skipper, pull\nyourself together. Open the jolly old window and give him air. Feelin'\nbetter, sir?\"\n\n\"A chaperon! How absurd!\" cried the girl indignantly. \"I'm old enough to\nbe Bones's mother! I'm nearly twenty--well, I'm older than Bones, and\nI'm ever so much more capable of looking after myself.\"\n\nThe end of it was that she went, with her Kano maid and with the wife of\nAbiboo to cook for her. And in two days they came to the bend of the\nriver, and Bones pursued his inquiries for the missing spy, but without\nsuccess.\n\n\"But this I tell you, lord,\" said the little chief who acted as\nSanders's agent, \"that there are strange things happening in the N'gombi\ncountry, for all the people have gone mad, and are digging up their\nteeth (tusks) and bringing them to a white man.\"\n\n\"This shall go to Sandi,\" said Bones, realizing the importance of the\nnews; and that same evening he turned the bow of the _Zaire_ down\nstream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus said Wafa, the half-breed, for he was neither foreign Arab nor\nnative N'gombi, yet combined the cunning of both--\n\n\"Soon we shall see the puc-a-puc of Government turn from the\ncrookedness of the river, and I will go out and speak to our lord\nTibbetti, who is a very simple man, and like a child.\"\n\n\"O Wafa,\" said one of the group of armed men which stood shivering on\nthe beach in the cold hours of dawn, \"may this be a good palaver! As for\nme, my stomach is filled with fearfulness. Let us all drink this magic\nwater, for it gives us men courage.\"\n\n\"That you shall do when you have carried out all our master's works,\"\nsaid Wafa, and added with confidence: \"Have no fear, for soon you shall\nsee great wonders.\"\n\nThey heard the deep boom of the _Zaire's_ siren signalling a solitary\nand venturesome fisherman to quit the narrow fair-way, and presently she\ncame round the bend of the river, a dazzling white craft, showering\nsparks from her two slender smoke-stacks and leaving behind her twin\ncornucopias of grey smoke.\n\nWafa stepped into a canoe, and, seeing that the others were preparing to\nfollow him, he struck out swiftly, man[oe]uvring his ironwood boat to\nthe very waters from whence a scared fisherman was frantically paddling.\n\n\"Go not there, foreigner,\" wailed the Isisi Stabber-of-Waters, \"for it\nis our lord Sandi, and his puc-a-puc has bellowed terribly.\"\n\n\"Die you!\" roared Wafa. \"On the river bottom your body, son of a fish\nand father of snakes!\"\n\n\"O foreign frog!\" came the shrill retort. \"O poor man with two men's\nwives! O goatless----\"\n\nWafa was too intent upon his business to heed the rest. He struck the\nwater strongly with his broad paddles, and reached the centre of the\nchannel.\n\nBones of the Houssas put up his hand and jerked the rope of the siren.\n\n_Whoo-o-o--woo-o-op!_\n\n\"Bless his silly old head,\" said Bones fretfully, \"the dashed fellow\nwill be run down!\"\n\nThe girl was dusting Bones's cabin, and looked round. \"What is it?\" she\nasked.\n\nBones made no reply. He gripped the telegraph handle and rung the\nengines astern as Yoka, the steersman, spun the wheel.\n\nBump! Bump! Bumpity bump!\n\nThe steamer slowed and stopped, and the girl came out to the bridge in\nalarm. The _Zaire_ had struck a sandbank, and was stranded high, if not\ndry.\n\n\"Bring that man on board,\" said the wrathful Bones. And they hauled to\nhis presence Wafa, who was neither Arab nor N'gombi, but combined the\nvices of both.\n\n\"O man,\" said Bones, glaring at the offender through his eyeglass, \"what\nevil ju-ju sent you to stop my fine ship?\" He spoke in the Isisi\ndialect, and was surprised to be answered in coast Arabic.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, unmoved by the wrath of his overlord, \"I come to\nmake a great palaver concerning spirits and devils. Lord, I have found a\ngreat magic.\"\n\nBones grinned, for he had that sense of humour which rises superior to\nall other emotions. \"Then you shall try your magic, my man, and lift\nthis ship to deep water.\"\n\nWafa was not at all embarrassed. \"Lord, this is a greater magic, for it\nconcerns men, and brings to life the dead. For, lord, in this forest is\na wonderful tree. Behold!\"\n\nHe took from his loose-rolled waistband a piece of wood. Bones took it\nin his hand. It was the size of a corn cob, and had been newly cut, so\nthat the wood was moist with sap. Bones smelt it. There was a faint\nodour of resin and camphor. Patricia Hamilton smiled. It was so like\nBones to be led astray by side issues.\n\n\"Where is the wonder, man, that you should drive my ship upon a\nsandbank! And who are these?\" Bones pointed to six canoes, filled with\nmen, approaching the _Zaire_. The man did not answer, but, taking the\nwood from Bones's hand, pulled a knife from his belt and whittled a\nshaving.\n\n\"Here, lord,\" he said, \"is my fine magic. With this wood I can do many\nmiracles, such as making sick men strong and the strong weak.\"\n\nBones heard the canoes bump against the side of the boat, but his mind\nwas occupied with curiosity.\n\n\"Thus do I make my magic, Tibbetti,\" droned Wafa.\n\nHe held the knife by the haft in the right hand, and the chip of wood in\nhis left. The point of the knife was towards the white man's heart.\n\n\"Bones!\" screamed the girl.\n\nBones jumped aside and struck out as the man lunged. His nobbly fist\ncaught Wafa under the jaw, and the man stumbled and fell. At the same\ninstant there was a yell from the lower deck, the sound of scuffling,\nand a shot.\n\nBones jumped for the girl, thrust her into the cabin, sliding the steel\ndoor behind him. His two revolvers hung at the head of his bunk, and he\nslipped them out, gave a glance to see whether they were loaded, and\npushed the door.\n\n\"Shut the door after me,\" he breathed.\n\nThe bridge deck was deserted, and Bones raced down the ladder to the\niron deck. Two Houssas and half a dozen natives lay dead or dying. The\nremainder of the soldiers were fighting desperately with whatever\nweapons they found to their hands--for, with characteristic carefulness,\nthey had laid their rifles away in oil, lest the river air rust\nthem--and, save for the sentry, who used a rifle common to all, they\nwere unarmed.\n\n\"O dogs!\" roared Bones.\n\nThe invaders turned and faced the long-barrelled Webleys, and the fight\nwas finished. Later, Wafa came to the bridge with bright steel manacles\non his wrist. His companions in the mad adventure sat on the iron deck\nbelow, roped leg to leg, and listened with philosophic calm as the\nHoussa sentry drew lurid pictures of the fate which awaited them.\n\nBones sat in his deep chair, and the prisoner squatted before him. \"You\nshall tell my lord Sandi why you did this wickedness,\" he said, \"also,\nWafa, what evil thought was in your mind.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Wafa cheerfully, \"what good comes to me if I speak?\"\nSomething about the man's demeanour struck Bones as strange, and he rose\nand went close to him.\n\n\"I see,\" he said, with a tightened lip. \"The palaver is finished.\"\n\nThey led the man away, and the girl, who had been a spectator, asked\nanxiously: \"What is wrong, Bones?\"\n\nBut the young man shook his head. \"The breaking of all that Sanders has\nworked for,\" he said bitterly, and the very absence of levity in one\nwhose heart was so young and gay struck a colder chill to the girl's\nheart than the yells of the warring N'gombi. For Sanders had a big place\nin Patricia Hamilton's life. In an hour the _Zaire_ was refloated, and\nwas going at full speed down stream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSanders held his court in the thatched palaver house between the Houssa\nguard-room and the little stockade prison at the river's edge--a prison\nhidden amidst the flowering shrubs and acacia trees.\n\nWafa was the first to be examined. \"Lord,\" he said, without\nembarrassment, \"I tell you this--that I will not speak of the great\nwonders which lay in my heart unless you give me a book[6] that I shall\ngo free.\"\n\n[Footnote 6: A written promise.]\n\nSanders smiled unpleasantly. \"By the Prophet, I say what is true,\" he\nbegan confidentially; and Wafa winced at the oath, for he knew that\ntruth was coming, and truth of a disturbing character. \"In this land I\ngovern millions of men,\" said Sanders, speaking deliberately, \"I and two\nwhite lords. I govern by fear, Wafa, because there is no love in simple\nnative men, save a love for their own and their bellies.\"\n\n\"Lord, you speak truth,\" said Wafa, the superior Arab of him responding\nto the confidence.\n\n\"Now, if you make to kill the lord Tibbetti,\" Sanders went on, \"and do\nyour wickedness for secret reasons, must I not discover what is that\nsecret, lest it mean that I lose my hold upon the lands I govern?\"\n\n\"Lord, that is also true,\" said Wafa.\n\n\"For what is one life more or less,\" asked Sanders, \"a suffering smaller\nor greater by the side of my millions and their good?\"\n\n\"Lord, you are Suliman,\" said Wafa eagerly. \"Therefore, if you let me\ngo, who shall be the worse for it?\"\n\nAgain Sanders smiled, that grim parting of lip to show his white teeth.\n\"Yet you may lie, and, if I let you go, I have neither the truth nor\nyour body. No, Wafa, you shall speak.\" He rose up from his chair.\n\"To-day you shall go to the Village of Irons,\" he said; \"to-morrow I\nwill come to you, and you shall answer my questions. And, if you will\nnot speak, I shall light a little fire on your chest, and that fire\nshall not go out except when the breath goes from your body. This\npalaver is finished.\"\n\nSo they took Wafa away to the Village of Irons, where the evil men of\nthe Territories worked with chains about their ankles for their many\nsins, and in the morning came Sanders.\n\n\"Speak, man,\" he said.\n\nWafa stared with an effort of defiance, but his face was twitching, for\nhe saw the soldiers driving pegs into the ground, preparatory to staking\nhim out. \"I will speak the truth,\" he said.\n\nSo they took him into a hut, and there Sanders sat with him alone for\nhalf an hour; and when the Commissioner came out, his face was drawn and\ngrey. He beckoned to Hamilton, who came forward and saluted. \"We will\nget back to headquarters,\" he said shortly, and they arrived two hours\nlater.\n\nSanders sat in the little telegraph office, and the Morse sounder\nrattled and clacked for half an hour. Other sounders were at work\nelsewhere, delicate needles vacillated in cable offices, and an\nUnder-Secretary was brought from the House of Commons to the bureau of\nthe Prime Minister to answer a question.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon came the message Sanders expected:\n\"London says permit for Corklan forged. Arrest. Take extremest steps.\nDeal drastically, ruthlessly. Holding in residence three companies\nAfrican Rifles and mountain battery support you. Good luck.\nAdministration.\"\n\nSanders came out of the office, and Bones met him.\n\n\"Men all aboard, sir,\" he reported.\n\n\"We'll go,\" said Sanders.\n\nHe met the girl half-way to the quay. \"I know it is something very\nserious,\" she said quietly; \"you have all my thoughts.\" She put both her\nhands in his, and he took them. Then, without a word, he left her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. P. T. Corklan sat before his new hut in the village of Fimini. In\nthat hut--the greatest the N'gombi had ever seen--were stored hundreds\nof packages all well wrapped and sewn in native cloth.\n\nHe was not smoking a cigar, because his stock of cigars was running\nshort, but he was chewing a toothpick, for these, at a pinch, could be\nimprovised. He called to his headman. \"Wafa?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord, he will come, for he is very cunning,\" said the headman.\n\nMr. Corklan grunted. He walked to the edge of the village, where the\nground sloped down to a strip of vivid green rushes. \"Tell me, how long\nwill this river be full?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lord, for a moon.\"\n\nCorklan nodded. Whilst the secret river ran, there was escape for him,\nfor its meandering course would bring him and his rich cargo to Spanish\nterritory and deep water.\n\nHis headman waited as though he had something to say. \"Lord,\" he said at\nlast, \"the chief of the N'coro village sends this night ten great teeth\nand a pot.\"\n\nCorklan nodded. \"If we're here, we'll get 'em. I hope we shall be gone.\"\n\nAnd then the tragically unexpected happened. A man in white came through\nthe trees towards him, and behind was another white man and a platoon of\nnative soldiers.\n\n\"Trouble,\" said Corklan to himself, and thought the moment was one which\ncalled for a cigar.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Sanders!\" he said cheerfully.\n\nSanders eyed him in silence.\n\n\"This is an unexpected pleasure,\" said Corklan.\n\n\"Corklan, where is your still?\" asked Sanders.\n\nThe plump man laughed. \"You'll find it way back in the forest,\" he said,\n\"and enough sweet potatoes to distil fifty gallons of spirit--all proof,\nsir, decimal 1986 specific gravity water extracted by Soemmering's\nmethod--in fact, as good as you could get it in England.\"\n\nSanders nodded. \"I remember now--you're the man that ran the still in\nthe Ashanti country, and got away with the concession.\"\n\n\"That's me,\" said the other complacently. \"P. T. Corklan--I never assume\nan alias.\"\n\nSanders nodded again. \"I came past villages,\" he said, \"where every man\nand almost every woman was drunk. I have seen villages wiped out in\ndrunken fights. I have seen a year's hard work ahead of me. You have\ncorrupted a province in a very short space of time, and, as far as I can\njudge, you hoped to steal a Government ship and get into neutral\nterritory with the prize you have won by your----\"\n\n\"Enterprise,\" said Mr. Corklan obligingly. \"You'll have to prove\nthat--about the ship. I am willing to stand any trial you like. There's\nno law about prohibition--it's one you've made yourself. I brought up\nthe still--that's true--brought it up in sections and fitted it. I've\nbeen distilling spirits--that's true----\"\n\n\"I also saw a faithful servant of Government, one Ali Kano,\" said\nSanders, in a low voice. \"He was lying on the bank of this secret river\nof yours with two revolver bullets in him.\"\n\n\"The nigger was spying on me, and I shot him,\" explained Corklan.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Sanders. And then, after a little pause: \"Will you\nbe hung or shot?\"\n\nThe cigar dropped from the man's mouth. \"Hey?\" he said hoarsely.\n\"You--you can't--do that--for making a drop of liquor--for niggers!\"\n\n\"For murdering a servant of the State,\" corrected Sanders. \"But, if it\nis any consolation to you, I will tell you that I would have killed you,\nanyway.\"\n\nIt took Mr. Corklan an hour to make up his mind, and then he chose\nrifles.\n\nTo-day the N'gombi point to a mound near the village of Fimini, which\nthey call by a name which means, \"The Waters of Madness,\" and it is\nbelieved to be haunted by devils.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nEYE TO EYE\n\n\n\"Bones,\" said Captain Hamilton, in despair, \"you will never be a\nNapoleon.\"\n\n\"Dear old sir and brother-officer,\" said Lieutenant Tibbetts, \"you are a\njolly old pessimist.\"\n\nBones was by way of being examined in subjects C and D, for promotion to\ncaptaincy, and Hamilton was the examining officer. By all the rules and\nlaws and strict regulations which govern military examinations, Bones\nhad not only failed, but he had seriously jeopardized his right to his\nlieutenancy, if every man had his due.\n\n\"Now, let me put this,\" said Hamilton. \"Suppose you were in charge of a\ncompany of men, and you were attacked on three sides, and you had a\nriver behind you on the fourth side, and you found things were going\nvery hard against you. What would you do?\"\n\n\"Dear old sir,\" said Bones thoughtfully, and screwing his face into all\nmanner of contortions in his effort to secure the right answer, \"I\nshould go and wet my heated brow in the purling brook, then I'd take\ncounsel with myself.\"\n\n\"You'd lose,\" said Hamilton, with a groan. \"That's the last person in\nthe world you should go to for advice, Bones. Suppose,\" he said, in a\nlast desperate effort to awaken a gleam of military intelligence in his\nsubordinate's mind, \"suppose you were trekking through the forest with a\nhundred rifles, and you found your way barred by a thousand armed men.\nWhat would you do?\"\n\n\"Go back,\" said Bones, \"and jolly quick, dear old fellow.\"\n\n\"Go back? What would you go back for?\" asked the other, in astonishment.\n\n\"To make my will,\" said Bones firmly, \"and to write a few letters to\ndear old friends in the far homeland. I have friends, Ham,\" he said,\nwith dignity, \"jolly old people who listen for my footsteps, and to whom\nmy voice is music, dear old fellow.\"\n\n\"What other illusions do they suffer from?\" asked Hamilton offensively,\nclosing his book with a bang. \"Well, you will be sorry to learn that I\nshall not recommend you for promotion.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that,\" said Bones hoarsely.\n\n\"I mean that,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well, I thought if I had a pal to examine me, I would go through with\nflying colours.\"\n\n\"Then I am not a pal. You don't suggest,\" said Hamilton, with ominous\ndignity, \"that I would defraud the public by lying as to the qualities\nof a deficient character?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Bones, nodding vigorously, \"for my sake and for the\nsake of the child.\" The child was that small native whom Bones had\nrescued and adopted.\n\n\"Not even for the sake of the child,\" said Hamilton, with an air of\nfinality. \"Bones, you're ploughed.\"\n\nBones did not speak, and Hamilton gathered together the papers, forms,\nand paraphernalia of examination.\n\nHe lifted his head suddenly, to discover that Bones was staring at him.\nIt was no ordinary stare, but something that was a little uncanny. \"What\nthe dickens are you looking at?\"\n\nBones did not speak. His round eyes were fixed on his superior in an\nunwinking glare.\n\n\"When I said you had failed,\" said Hamilton kindly, \"I meant, of\ncourse----\"\n\n\"That I'd passed,\" muttered Bones excitedly. \"Say it, Ham--say it!\n'Bones, congratulations, dear old lad'----\"\n\n\"I meant,\" said Hamilton coldly, \"that you have another chance next\nmonth.\"\n\nThe face of Lieutenant Tibbetts twisted into a painful contortion. \"It\ndidn't work!\" he said bitterly, and stalked from the room.\n\n\"Rum beggar!\" thought Hamilton, and smiled to himself.\n\n\"Have you noticed anything strange about Bones?\" asked Patricia Hamilton\nthe next day.\n\nHer brother looked at her over his newspaper. \"The strangest thing about\nBones is Bones,\" he said, \"and that I am compelled to notice every day\nof my life.\"\n\nShe looked up at Sanders, who was idly pacing the stoep of the\nResidency. \"Have you, Mr. Sanders?\"\n\nSanders paused. \"Beyond the fact that he is rather preoccupied and\nstares at one----\"\n\n\"That is it,\" said the girl. \"I knew I was right--he stares horribly. He\nhas been doing it for a week--just staring. Do you think he is ill?\"\n\n\"He has been moping in his hut for the past week,\" said Hamilton\nthoughtfully, \"but I was hoping that it meant that he was swotting for\nhis exam. But staring--I seem to remember----\"\n\nThe subject of the discussion made his appearance at the far end of the\nsquare at that moment, and they watched him. First he walked slowly\ntowards the Houssa sentry, who shouldered his arms in salute. Bones\nhalted before the soldier and stared at him. Somehow, the watchers on\nthe stoep knew that he was staring--there was something so fixed, so\ntense in his attitude. Then, without warning, the sentry's hand passed\nacross his body, and the rifle came down to the \"present.\"\n\n\"What on earth is he doing?\" demanded the outraged Hamilton, for\nsentries do not present arms to subaltern officers.\n\nBones passed on. He stopped before one of the huts in the married lines,\nand stared at the wife of Sergeant Abiboo. He stared long and earnestly,\nand the woman, giggling uncomfortably, stared back. Then she began to\ndance.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake----\" gasped Sanders, as Bones passed on.\n\n\"Bones!\" roared Hamilton.\n\nBones turned first his head, then his body towards the Residency, and\nmade his slow way towards the group.\n\n\"What is happening?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nThe face of Bones was flushed; there was triumph in his eye--triumph\nwhich his pose of nonchalance could not wholly conceal. \"What is\nhappening, dear old officer?\" he asked innocently, and stared.\n\n\"What the dickens are you goggling at?\" demanded Hamilton irritably.\n\"And please explain why you told the sentry to present arms to you.\"\n\n\"I didn't tell him, dear old sir and superior captain,\" said Bones. His\neyes never left Hamilton's; he stared with a fierceness and with an\nintensity that was little short of ferocious.\n\n\"Confound you, what are you staring at? Aren't you well?\" demanded\nHamilton wrathfully.\n\nBones blinked. \"Quite well, sir and comrade,\" he said gravely. \"Pardon\nthe question--did you feel a curious and unaccountable inclination to\nraise your right hand and salute me?\"\n\n\"Did I--what?\" demanded his dumbfounded superior.\n\n\"A sort of itching of the right arm--an almost overpowerin' inclination\nto touch your hat to poor old Bones?\"\n\nHamilton drew a long breath. \"I felt an almost overpowering desire to\nlift my foot,\" he said significantly.\n\n\"Look at me again,\" said Bones calmly. \"Fix your eyes on mine an' think\nof nothin'. Now shut your eyes. Now you can't open 'em.\"\n\n\"Of course I can open them,\" said Hamilton. \"Have you been drinking,\nBones?\"\n\nA burst of delighted laughter from the girl checked Bones's indignant\ndenial. \"I know!\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"Bones is trying to\nmesmerize you!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe scarlet face of Bones betrayed him.\n\n\"Power of the human eye, dear old sir,\" he said hurriedly. \"Some people\nhave it--it's a gift. I discovered it the other day after readin' an\narticle in _The Scientific Healer_.\"\n\n\"Phew!\" Hamilton whistled. \"So,\" he said, with dangerous calm, \"all this\nstaring and gaping of yours means that, does it? I remember now. When I\nwas examining you for promotion the other day, you stared. Trying to\nmesmerize me?\"\n\n\"Let bygones be bygones, dear old friend,\" begged Bones.\n\n\"And when I asked you to produce the company pay-sheets, which you\nforgot to bring up to date, you stared at me!\"\n\n\"It's a gift,\" said Bones feebly.\n\n\"Oh, Bones,\" said the girl slowly, \"you stared at me, too, after I\nrefused to go picnicking with you on the beach.\"\n\n\"All's fair in love an' war,\" said Bones vaguely. \"It's a wonderful\ngift.\"\n\n\"Have you ever mesmerized anybody?\" asked Hamilton curiously, and Bones\nbrightened up.\n\n\"Rather, dear old sir,\" he said. \"Jolly old Ali, my secretary--goes off\nin a regular trance on the slightest provocation. Fact, dear old Ham.\"\n\nHamilton clapped his hands, and his orderly, dozing in the shade of the\nverandah, rose up. \"Go, bring Ali Abid,\" said Hamilton. And when the man\nhad gone: \"Are you under the illusion that you made the sentry present\narms to you, and Abiboo's woman dance for you, by the magic of your\neye?\"\n\n\"You saw,\" said the complacent Bones. \"It's a wonderful gift, dear old\nHam. As soon as I read the article, I tried it on Ali. Got him, first\npop!\"\n\nThe girl was bubbling with suppressed laughter, and there was a twinkle\nin Sanders's eye. \"I recall that you saw me in connection with shooting\nleave in the N'gombi.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir and Excellency,\" said the miserable Bones.\n\n\"And I said that I thought it inadvisable, because of the trouble in the\nbend of the Isisi River.\"\n\n\"Yes, Excellency and sir,\" agreed Bones dolefully.\n\n\"And then you stared.\"\n\n\"Did I, dear old--Did I, sir?\"\n\nHis embarrassment was relieved by the arrival of Ali. So buoyant a soul\nhad Bones, that from the deeps of despair into which he was beginning to\nsink he rose to heights of confidence, not to say self-assurance, that\nwere positively staggering.\n\n\"Miss Patricia, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Bones briskly, \"we have here\nAli Abid, confidential servant and faithful retainer. I will now\nendeavour to demonstrate the power of the human eye.\"\n\nHe met the stolid gaze of Ali and stared. He stared terribly and\nalarmingly, and Ali, to do him justice, stared back.\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" commanded Bones. \"You can't open them, can you?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"optics of subject are hermetically sealed.\"\n\n\"I will now put him in a trance,\" said Bones, and waved his hand\nmysteriously. Ali rocked backward and forward, and would have fallen but\nfor the supporting arm of the demonstrator. \"He is now insensible to\npain,\" said Bones proudly.\n\n\"Lend me your hatpin, Pat,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I will now awaken him,\" said Bones hastily, and snapped his fingers.\nAli rose to his feet with great dignity. \"Thank you, Ali; you may go,\"\nsaid his master, and turned, ready to receive the congratulations of\nthe party.\n\n\"Do you seriously believe that you mesmerized that humbug?\"\n\nBones drew himself erect. \"Sir and captain,\" he said stiffly, \"do you\nsuggest I am a jolly old impostor? You saw the sentry, sir, you saw the\nwoman, sir.\"\n\n\"And I saw Ali,\" said Hamilton, nodding, \"and I'll bet he gave the\nsentry something and the woman something to play the goat for you.\"\n\nBones bowed slightly and distantly. \"I cannot discuss my powers, dear\nold sir; you realize that there are some subjects too delicate to broach\nexcept with kindred spirits. I shall continue my studies of psychic\nmysteries undeterred by the cold breath of scepticism.\" He saluted\neverybody, and departed with chin up and shoulders squared, a picture of\noffended dignity.\n\nThat night Sanders lay in bed, snuggled up on his right side, which\nmeant that he had arrived at the third stage of comfort which precedes\nthat fading away of material life which men call sleep. Half consciously\nhe listened to the drip, drip, drip of rain on the stoep, and promised\nhimself that he would call upon Abiboo in the morning, to explain the\nmatter of a choked gutter, for Abiboo had sworn, by the Prophet and\ncertain minor relatives of the Great One, that he had cleared every\nbird's nest from the ducts about the Residency.\n\nDrip, drip, drip, drip, drip!\n\nSanders sank with luxurious leisure into the nothingness of the night.\n\nDrip-tap, drip-tap, drip-tap!\n\nHe opened his eyes slowly, slid one leg out of bed, and groped for his\nslippers. He slipped into the silken dressing-gown which had been flung\nover the end of the bed, corded it about him, and switched on the\nelectric light. Then he passed out into the big common room, with its\nchairs drawn together in overnight comradeship, and the solemn tick of\nthe big clock to emphasize the desolation. He paused a second to switch\non the lights, then went to the door and flung it open.\n\n\"Enter!\" he said in Arabic.\n\nThe man who came in was naked, save for a tarboosh on his head and a\nloin-cloth about his middle. His slim body shone with moisture, and\nwhere he stood on the white matting were two little pools. Kano from his\nbrown feet to the soaked fez, he stood erect with that curious\nassumption of pride and equality which the Mussulman bears with less\noffence to his superiors than any other race.\n\n\"Peace on this house,\" he said, raising his hand.\n\n\"Speak, Ahmet,\" said Sanders, dropping into a big chair and stretching\nback, with his clasped hands behind his head. He eyed the man gravely\nand without resentment, for no spy would tap upon his window at night\nsave that the business was a bad one.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"it is shameful that I should wake your lordship\nfrom your beautiful dream, but I came with the river.\"[7] He looked down\nat his master, and in the way of certain Kano people, who are\ndialecticians to a man, he asked: \"Lord, it is written in the Sura of\nYa-Sin, 'To the sun it is not given to overtake the moon----'\"\n\n[Footnote 7: I came when I could.]\n\n\"'Nor doth the night outstrip the day; but each in his own sphere doth\njourney on,'\" finished Sanders patiently. \"Thus also begins the Sura of\nthe Cave: 'Praise be to God, Who hath sent down the book to his servant,\nand hath put no crookedness into it.' Therefore, Ahmet, be plain to me,\nand leave your good speeches till you meet the abominable Sufi.\"\n\nThe man sank to his haunches. \"Lord,\" he said, \"from the bend of the\nriver, where the Isisi divides the land of the N'gombi from the lands of\nthe Good Chief, I came, travelling by day and night with the river, for\nmany strange things have happened which are too wonderful for me. This\nChief Busesi, whom all men call good, has a daughter by his second wife.\nIn the year of the High Crops she was given to a stranger from the\nforest, him they call Gufuri-Bululu, and he took her away to live in his\nhut.\"\n\nSanders sat up. \"Go on, man,\" he said.\n\n\"Lord, she has returned and performs wonderful magic,\" said the man,\n\"for by the wonder of her eyes she can make dead men live and live men\ndie, and all people are afraid. Also, lord, there was a wise man in the\nforest, who was blind, and he had a daughter who was the prop and staff\nof him, and because of his wisdom, and because she hated all who\nrivalled her, the woman D'rona Gufuri told certain men to seize the girl\nand hold her in a deep pool of water until she was dead.\"\n\n\"This is a bad palaver,\" said Sanders; \"but you shall tell me what you\nmean by the wonder of her eyes.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"she looks upon men, and they do her will. Now, it\nis her will that there shall be a great dance on the Rind of the Moon,\nand after she shall send the spears of the people of Busesi--who is old\nand silly, and for this reason is called good--against the N'gombi\nfolk.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Sanders, biting his lip in thought, \"by the wonder of her\neyes!\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the man, \"even I have seen this, for she has stricken men\nto the ground by looking at them, and some she has made mad, and others\nfoolish.\"\n\nSanders turned his head at a noise from the doorway. The tall figure of\nHamilton stood peering sleepily at the light.\n\n\"I heard your voice,\" he said apologetically. \"What is the trouble?\"\n\nBriefly Sanders related the story the man had told.\n\n\"Wow!\" said Hamilton, in a paroxysm of delight.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Bones!\" shouted Hamilton. \"Bones is the fellow. Let him go up and\nsubdue her with his eye. He's the very fellow. I'll go over and call\nhim, sir.\"\n\nHe hustled into his clothing, slipped on a mackintosh, and, making his\nway across the dark square, admitted himself to the sleeping-hut of\nLieutenant Tibbetts. By the light of his electric torch he discovered\nthe slumberer. Bones lay on his back, his large mouth wide open, one\nthin leg thrust out from the covers, and he was making strange noises.\nHamilton found the lamp and lit it, then he proceeded to the\nheart-breaking task of waking his subordinate. \"Up, you lazy devil!\" he\nshouted, shaking Bones by the shoulder.\n\nBones opened his eyes and blinked rapidly. \"On the word 'One!'\" he said\nhoarsely, \"carry the left foot ten inches to the left front, at the same\ntime bringing the rifle to a horizontal position at the right side.\nOne!\"\n\n\"Wake up, wake up, Bones!\"\n\nBones made a wailing noise. It was the noise of a mother panther who has\nreturned to her lair to discover that her offspring have been eaten by\nwild pigs. \"Whar-r-ow-ow!\" he said, and turned over on his right side.\n\nHamilton pocketed his torch, and, lifting Bones bodily from the bed, let\nhim fall with a thud.\n\nBones scrambled up, staring. \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, \"I stand\nbefore you a ruined man. Drink has been my downfall, as the dear old\njudge remarked. I _did_ kill Wilfred Morgan, and I plead the unwritten\nlaw.\" He saluted stiffly, collapsed on to his pillow, and fell instantly\ninto a deep child-like sleep.\n\nHamilton groaned. He had had occasion to wake Bones from his beauty\nsleep before, but he had never been as bad as this. He took a soda\nsiphon from the little sideboard and depressed the lever, holding the\noutlet above his victim's head.\n\nBones leapt up with a roar. \"Hello, Ham!\" he said quite sanely. \"Well\ndear old officer, this is the finish! You stand by the lifeboat an'\nshoot down anybody who attempts to leave the ship before the torpedoes\nare saved. I'm goin' down into the hold to have a look at the women an'\nchildren.\" He saluted, and was stepping out into the wet night, when\nHamilton caught his arm.\n\n\"Steady, the Buffs, my sleeping beauty! Dress yourself. Sanders wants\nyou.\"\n\nBones nodded. \"I'll just drive over and see him,\" he said, climbed back\ninto bed, and was asleep in a second.\n\nHamilton put out the light and went back to the Residency. \"I hadn't\nthe heart to cut his ear off,\" he said regretfully. \"I'm afraid we\nshan't be able to consult Bones till the morning.\"\n\nSanders nodded. \"Anyway, I will wait for the morning. I have told Abiboo\nto get stores and wood aboard, and to have steam in the _Zaire_. Let us\nemulate Bones.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said Hamilton piously.\n\nBones came blithely to breakfast, a dapper and a perfectly groomed\nfigure. He received the news of the ominous happenings in the N'gombi\ncountry with that air of profound solemnity which so annoyed Hamilton.\n\n\"I wish you had called me in the night,\" he said gravely. \"Dear old\nofficer, I think it was due to me.\"\n\n\"Called you! Called you! Why--why----\" spluttered Hamilton.\n\n\"In fact, we did call you Bones, but we could not wake you,\" smoothed\nSanders.\n\nA look of amazement spread over the youthful face of Lieutenant\nTibbetts. \"You called me?\" he asked incredulously. \"Called _me_?\"\n\n\"_You!_\" hissed Hamilton. \"I not only called you, but I kicked you.\nI poured water on you, and I chucked you up to the roof of the hut and\ndropped you.\"\n\nA faint but unbelieving smile from Bones. \"Are you sure it was me,\ndear old officer?\" he asked, and Hamilton choked. \"I only ask,\" said\nBones, turning blandly to the girl, \"because I'm a notoriously light\nsleeper, dear old Miss Patricia. The slightest stir wakes me, and\ninstantly I'm in possession of all my faculties. Bosambo calls me\n'Eye-That-Never-Shuts----'\"\n\n\"Bosambo is a notorious leg-puller,\" interrupted Hamilton irritably.\n\"Really, Bones----\"\n\n\"Often, dear old Sister,\" Bones went on impressively, \"campin' out in\nthe forest, an' sunk in the profound sleep which youth an' a good\nconscience brings, something has wakened me, an' I've jumped to my feet,\na revolver in my hand, an' what do you think it was?\"\n\n\"A herd of wild elephants walking on your chest?\" suggested Hamilton.\n\n\"What do you think it was, dear old Patricia miss?\" persisted Bones, and\ninterrupted her ingenious speculation in his usual aggravating manner:\n\"The sound of a footstep breakin' a twig a hundred yards away!\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" sneered Hamilton, stirring his coffee. \"Bones, if you could\nonly spell, what a novelist you'd be!\"\n\n\"The point is,\" said Sanders, with good-humoured patience, which\nbrought, for some curious reason, a warm sense of intimacy to the girl,\n\"you've got to go up and try your eye on the woman D'rona Gufuri.\"\n\nBones leant back in his chair and spoke with deliberation and\nimportance, for he realized that he, and only he, could supply a\nsolution to the difficulties of his superiors.\n\n\"The power of the human eye, when applied by a jolly old scientist to a\nheathen, is irresistible. You may expect me down with the prisoner in\nfour days.\"\n\n\"She may be more trouble than you expect,\" said Sanders seriously. \"The\nlonger one lives in native lands, the less confident can one be. There\nhave been remarkable cases of men possessing the power which this woman\nhas----\"\n\n\"And which I have, sir an' Excellency, to an extraordinary extent,\"\ninterrupted Bones firmly. \"Have no fear.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThirty-six hours later Bones stood before the woman D'rona Gufuri.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the woman, \"men speak evilly of me to Sandi, and now you\nhave come to take me to the Village of Irons.\"\n\n\"That is true, D'rona,\" said Bones, and looked into her eyes.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the woman, speaking slowly, \"you shall go back to Sandi and\nsay, 'I have not seen the woman D'rona'--for, lord, is this not truth?\"\n\n\"I'wa! I'wa!\" muttered Bones thickly.\n\n\"You cannot see me Tibbetti, and I am not here,\" said the woman, and she\nspoke before the assembled villagers, who stood, knuckles to teeth,\ngazing awe-stricken upon the scene.\n\n\"I cannot see you,\" said Bones sleepily.\n\n\"And now you cannot hear me, lord?\"\n\nBones did not reply.\n\nThe woman took him by the arm and led him through the patch of wood\nwhich fringes the river and separates beach from village. None followed\nthem; even the two Houssas who formed the escort of Lieutenant Tibbetts\nstayed rooted to the spot.\n\nBones passed into the shadow of the trees, the woman's hand on his arm.\nThen suddenly from the undergrowth rose a lank figure, and D'rona of the\nMagic Eye felt a bony hand at her throat. She laughed.\n\n\"O man, whoever you be, look upon me in this light, and your strength\nshall melt.\"\n\nShe twisted round to meet her assailant's face, and shrieked aloud, for\nhe was blind. And Bones stood by without moving, without seeing or\nhearing, whilst the strong hands of the blind witch-doctor, whose\ndaughter she had slain, crushed the life from her body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" explained Bones, \"you may think she mesmerized me. On\nthe other hand, it is quite possible that she acted under my influence.\nIt's a moot point, sir an' Excellency--jolly moot!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE HOODED KING\n\n\nThere was a certain Portuguese governor--this was in the days when\nColhemos was Colonial Minister--who had a small legitimate income and an\nextravagant wife. This good lady had a villa at Cintra, a box at the\nReal Theatre de S\u00e3o Carlos, and a motor-car, and gave five o'clocks at\nthe Hotel Nunes to the aristocracy and gentry who inhabited that spot,\nof whom the ecstatic Spaniard said, \"dejar a Cintra, y ver al mundo\nentero, es, con verdad caminar en capuchera.\"\n\nSince her husband's salary was exactly $66.50 weekly and the upkeep of\nthe villa alone was twice that amount, it is not difficult to understand\nthat Senhor Bonaventura was a remarkable man.\n\nColhemos came over to the Foreign Office in the Praco de Commercio one\nday and saw Dr. Sarabesta, and Sarabesta, who was both a republican and\na sinner, was also ambitious, or he had a Plan and an Ideal--two very\ndangerous possessions for a politician, since they lead inevitably to\nchange, than which nothing is more fatal to political systems.\n\n\"Colhemos,\" said the doctor dramatically, \"you are ruining me! You are\nbringing me to the dust and covering me with the hatred and mistrust of\nthe Powers!\"\n\nHe folded his arms and rose starkly from the chair, his beard all\na-bristle, his deep little eyes glaring.\n\n\"What is wrong, Baptisa?\" asked Colhemos.\n\nThe other flung out his arms in an extravagant gesture.\n\n\"Ruin!\" he cried somewhat inadequately.\n\nHe opened the leather portfolio which lay on the table and extracted six\nsheets of foolscap paper.\n\n\"Read!\" he said, and subsided into his padded armchair a picture of\ngloom.\n\nThe sheets of foolscap were surmounted by crests showing an emaciated\nlion and a small horse with a spiral horn in his forehead endeavouring\nto climb a chafing-dish which had been placed on edge for the purpose,\nand was suitably inscribed with another lion, two groups of leopards and\na harp.\n\nColhemos did not stop to admire the menagerie, but proceeded at once to\nthe literature. It was in French, and had to do with a certain condition\nof affairs in Portuguese Central Africa which \"constituted a grave and\nincreasing menace to the native subjects\" of \"Grande Bretagne.\" There\nwere hints, \"which His Majesty's Government would be sorry to believe,\nof raids and requisitions upon the native manhood\" of this country which\ndiffered little from slave raids.\n\nFurther, \"Mr. Commissioner Sanders of the Territories regretted to\nlearn\" that these labour requisitions resulted in a condition of affairs\nnot far removed from slavery.\n\nColhemos read through the dispatch from start to finish, and put it down\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Pinto has been overdoing it,\" he admitted. \"I shall have to write to\nhim.\"\n\n\"What you write to Pinto may be interesting enough to print,\" said Dr.\nSarabesta violently, \"but what shall I write to London? This\nCommissioner Sanders is a fairly reliable man, and his Government will\nact upon what he says.\"\n\nColhemos, who was really a great man (it was a distinct loss when he\nfaced a firing platoon in the revolutionary days of '12), tapped his\nnose with a penholder.\n\n\"You can say that we shall send a special commissioner to the M'fusi\ncountry to report, and that he will remain permanently established in\nthe M'fusi to suppress lawless acts.\"\n\nThe doctor looked up wonderingly.\n\n\"Pinto won't like that,\" said he, \"besides which, the M'fusi are quite\nunmanageable. The last time we tried to bring them to reason it\ncost--Santa Maria!... and the lives!... phew!\"\n\nColhemos nodded.\n\n\"The duc de Sagosta,\" he said slowly, \"is an enthusiastic young man. He\nis also a royalist and allied by family ties to Dr. Ceillo of the Left.\nHe is, moreover, an Anglomaniac--though why he should be so when his\nmother was an American woman I do not know. He shall be our\ncommissioner, my dear Baptisa.\"\n\nHis dear Baptisa sat bolt upright, every hair in his bristling head\nerect.\n\n\"A royalist!\" he gasped, \"do you want to set Portugal ablaze?\"\n\n\"There are moments when I could answer 'Yes' to that question,\" said the\ntruthful Colhemos \"but for the moment I am satisfied that there will be\nno fireworks. It will do no harm to send the boy. It will placate the\nLeft and please the Clerics--it will also consolidate our reputation for\nliberality and largeness of mind. Also the young man will either be\nkilled or fall a victim to the sinister influences of that corruption\nwhich, alas, has so entered into the vitals of our Colonial service.\"\n\nSo Manuel duc de Sagosta was summoned, and prepared for the subject of\nhis visit by telephone, came racing up from Cintra in his big American\njuggernaut, leapt up the stairs of the Colonial Office two at a time,\nand came to Colhemos' presence in a state of mind which may be described\nas a big mental whoop.\n\n\"You will understand, Senhor,\" said Colhemos, \"that I am doing that\nwhich may make me unpopular. For that I care nothing! My country is my\nfirst thought, and the glory and honour of our flag! Some day you may\nhold my portfolio in the Cabinet, and it will be well if you bring to\nyour high and noble office the experience....\"\n\nThen they all talked together, and the dark room flickered with\ngesticulating palms.\n\nColhemos came to see the boy off by the M.N.P. boat which carried him to\nthe African Coast.\n\n\"I suppose, Senhor,\" said the duc, \"there would be no objection on the\npart of the Government to my calling on my way at a certain British\nport. I have a friend in the English army--we were at Clifton\ntogether----\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Colhemos, pressing the young man's hand warmly, \"you\nmust look upon England as a potential ally, and lose no opportunity\nwhich offers to impress upon our dear colleagues this fact, that behind\nEngland, unmoved, unshaken, faithful, stands the armed might of\nPortugal. May the saints have you in their keeping!\"\n\nHe embraced him, kissing him on both cheeks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBones was drilling recruits at headquarters when Hamilton hailed him\nfrom the edge of the square.\n\n\"There's a pal of yours come to see you, Bones,\" he roared.\n\nBones marched sedately to his superior and touched his helmet.\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"A friend of yours--just landed from the Portuguese packet.\"\n\nBones was mystified, and went up to the Residency to find a young man in\nspotless white being entertained by Patricia Hamilton and a very\nthoughtful Sanders.\n\nThe duc de Sagosta leapt to his feet as Bones came up the verandah.\n\n\"Hullo, Conk!\" he yelled hilariously.\n\nBones stared.\n\n\"God bless my life,\" he stammered, \"it's Mug!\"\n\nThere was a terrific hand-shaking accompanied by squawking inquiries\nwhich were never answered, uproarious laughter, back patting, brazen and\nbaseless charges that each was growing fat, and Sanders watched it with\ngreat kindness.\n\n\"Here's old Ham,\" said Bones, \"you ought to know Ham--Captain Hamilton,\nsir, my friend, the duke of something or other--but you can call him\nMug--Miss Hamilton--this is Mug.\"\n\n\"We've already been introduced,\" she laughed. \"But why do you let him\ncall you Mug?\"\n\nThe duc grinned.\n\n\"I like Mug,\" he said simply.\n\nHe was to stay to lunch, for the ship was not leaving until the\nafternoon, and Bones carried him off to his hut.\n\n\"A joyous pair,\" said Hamilton enviously. \"Lord, if I was only a boy\nagain!\"\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"You don't echo that wish?\" said Pat.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about that--I was thinking of the boy. I dislike this\nM'fusi business, and I can't think why the Government sent him. They are\na pretty bad lot--their territory is at the back of the Akasava, and the\nChief of the M'fusi is a rascal.\"\n\n\"But he says that he has been sent to reform them,\" said the girl.\n\nSanders smiled.\n\n\"It is not a job I should care to undertake--and yet----\"\n\nHe knitted his forehead.\n\n\"And yet----?\"\n\n\"I could reform them--Bones could reform them. But if they were reformed\nit would break Bonaventura, for he holds his job subject to their\ninfamy.\"\n\nAt lunch Sanders was unusually silent, a silence which was unnoticed,\nsave by the girl. Bones and his friend, however, needed no stimulation.\nLunch was an almost deafening meal, and when the time came for the duc\nto leave, the whole party went down to the beach to see him embark.\n\n\"Good-bye, old Mug!\" roared Bones, as the boat pulled away. \"Whoop! hi!\nhow!\"\n\n\"You're a noisy devil,\" said Hamilton, admiringly.\n\n\"Vox populi, vox Dei,\" said Bones.\n\nHe had an unexpected visitor that evening, for whilst he was dressing\nfor dinner, Sanders came into his hut--an unusual happening.\n\nWhat Sanders had to say may not be related since it was quite\nunofficial, but Bones came to dinner that night and behaved with such\ndecorum and preserved a mien so grave, that Hamilton thought he was ill.\n\nThe duc continued his journey down the African Coast and presently came\nto a port which was little more than a beach, a jetty, a big white\nhouse, and by far the most imposing end of the Moanda road. In due time,\nhe arrived by the worst track in the world (he was six days on the\njourney) at Moanda itself, and came into the presence of the Governor.\n\nDid the duc but know it, his Excellency had also been prepared for the\nyoung man's mission. The mail had arrived by carrier the day before the\nduc put in his appearance, and Pinto Bonaventura had his little piece\nall ready to say.\n\n\"I will give you all the assistance I possibly can,\" he said, as they\nsat at _d\u00e9jeuner_, \"but, naturally, I cannot guarantee you immunity.\"\n\n\"Immunity?\" said the puzzled duc.\n\nSenhor Bonaventura nodded gravely.\n\n\"Nothing is more repugnant to me than slavery,\" he said, \"unless it be\nthe terrible habit of drinking. If I could sweep these evils out of\nexistence with a wave of my hand, believe me I would do so; but I cannot\nperform miracles, and the Government will not give me sufficient troops\nto suppress these practices which every one of us hold in abhorrence.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested the duc, a little alarmed, \"since I am going to reform\nthe M'fusi....\"\n\nThe Governor choked over his coffee and apologized. He did not laugh,\nbecause long residence in Central Africa had got him out of the habit,\nand had taught him a certain amount of self-control in all things except\nthe consumption of marsala.\n\n\"Pray go on,\" he said, wearing an impassive face.\n\n\"It will be to the interests of Portugal, no less than to your\nExcellency's interest,\" said the young man, leaning across the table and\nspeaking with great earnestness, \"if I can secure a condition of peace,\nprosperity, sobriety, and if I can establish the Portuguese law in this\ndisturbed area.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" acknowledged the older man with profound seriousness.\n\nSo far from the duc's statement representing anything near the truth, it\nmay be said that a restoration of order would serve his Excellency very\nbadly indeed. In point of fact he received something like eight\nshillings for every \"head\" of \"recruited labour.\" He also received a\ncommission from the same interested syndicates which exported\nable-bodied labourers, a commission amounting to six shillings upon\nevery case of square-face, and a larger sum upon every keg of rum that\ncame into the country.\n\nSobriety and law would, in fact, spell much discomfort to the elegant\nlady who lived in the villa at Cintra, and would considerably diminish\nnot only Senhor Bonaventura's handsome balance at the Bank of Brazil,\nbut would impoverish certain ministers, permanent and temporary, who\nlooked to their dear Pinto for periodical contributions to what was\nhumorously described as \"The Party Fund.\"\n\nYet the duc de Sagosta went into the wilds with a high heart and a\ncomplete faith, in his youthful and credulous soul, that he had behind\nhim the full moral and physical support of a high-minded and patriotic\nGovernor. The high-minded and patriotic Governor, watching the caravan\nof his new assistant disappearing through the woods which fringe Moanda,\nexpressed in picturesque language his fervent hope that the mud, the\nswamp, the forest and the wilderness of the M'fusi country would swallow\nup this young man for evermore, amen. The unpopularity of the new\nCommissioner was sealed when the Governor learnt of his visit to\nSanders, for \"Sanders\" was a name at which his Excellency made\ndisapproving noises.\n\nThe predecessor of the duc de Sagosta was dead. His grave was in\nthe duc's front garden, and was covered with rank grass. The new-comer\nfound the office correspondence in order (as a glib native clerk\ndemonstrated); he also found 103 empty bottles behind the house, and\nunderstood the meaning of that coarse grave in the garden. He found\nthat the last index number in the letter-book was 951.\n\nIt is remarkable that the man he succeeded should have found, in one\nyear, 951 subjects for correspondence, but it is the fact. Possibly nine\nhundred of the letters had to do with the terrible state of the\nResidency at Uango-Bozeri. The roof leaked, the foundations had settled,\nand not a door closed as it should close. On the day of his arrival the\nduc found a _mamba_ resting luxuriously in his one armchair, a discovery\nwhich suggested the existence of a whole colony of these deadly\nbrutes--the _mamba_ bite is fatal in exactly ninety seconds--under or\nnear the house.\n\nThe other fifty dispatches probably had to do with the late\nCommissioner's arrears of pay, for Portugal at that time was in the\nthroes of her annual crisis, and ministries were passing through the\nGovernment offices at Lisbon with such rapidity that before a cheque\ncould be carried from the Foreign Office to the bank, it was out of\ndate.\n\nUango Bozeri is 220 miles by road from the coast, and is the centre of\nthe child-like people of the M'fusi. Here the duc dwelt and had his\nbeing, as Governor of 2,000 square miles, and overlord of some million\npeople who were cannibals with a passion for a fiery liquid which was\ndescribed by traders as \"rum.\" It was as near rum as the White City is\nto Heaven; that is to say, to the uncultivated taste it might have been\nrum, and anyway was as near to rum as the taster could expect to get.\n\nThis is all there is to be said about the duc de Sagosta, save that his\nheadman swindled him, his soldiers were conscienceless natives\ncommitting acts of brigandage in his innocent name, whilst his chief at\nMoanda was a peculating and incompetent scoundrel.\n\nAt the time when the duc was finding life a bitter and humiliating\nexperience, and had reached the stage when he sat on his predecessor's\ngrave for company, a small and unauthorized party crossed the frontier\nfrom the British Territories in search of adventure.\n\nNow it happened that the particular region through which the border-line\npassed was governed by the Chief of the Greater M'fusi, who was a\ncannibal, a drunkard, and a master of two regiments.\n\nThe duc had been advised not to interfere with the chief of his people,\nand he had (after one abortive and painful experience) obeyed his\nsuperiors, accepting the hut tax which was sent to him (and which was\nobviously and insolently inadequate) without demur.\n\nNo white man journeyed to the city of the M'fusi without invitation\nfrom the chief, and as Chief Karata never issued such invitation, the\nGreater M'fusi was a _terra incognita_ even to his Excellency the\nGovernor-General of the Central and Western Provinces.\n\nKarata was a drunkard approaching lunacy. It was his whim for weeks on\nend to wear on his head the mask of a goat. At other times, \"as a mark\nof his confidence in devils,\" he would appear hidden beneath a plaited\nstraw extinguisher which fitted him from head to foot. He was eccentric\nin other ways which need not be particularized, but he was never so\neccentric that he welcomed strangers.\n\nUnfortunately for those concerned, the high road from the Territories\npassed through the M'fusi drift. And one day there came a panting\nmessenger from the keeper of the drift who flung himself down at the\nking's feet.\n\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"there is a white man at the drift, and with him a\ncertain chief and his men.\"\n\n\"You will take the men, bringing them to me tied with ropes,\" said the\nking, who looked at the messenger with glassy eyes and found some\ndifficulty in speaking, for he was at the truculent stage of his second\nbottle.\n\nThe messenger returned and met the party on the road. What was his\nattitude towards the intruders it is impossible to say. He may have been\ninsolent, secure in the feeling that he was representing his master's\nattitude towards white men; he may have offered fight in the illusion\nthat the six warriors he took with him were sufficient to enforce the\nking's law. It is certain that he never returned.\n\nInstead there came to the king's kraal a small but formidable party\nunder a white man, and they arrived at a propitious moment, for the\nground before the king's great hut was covered with square bottles, and\nthe space in front of the palace was crowded with wretched men chained\nneck to neck and waiting to march to the coast and slavery.\n\nThe white man pushed back his helmet.\n\n\"Goodness gracious Heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"how perfectly horrid!\nBosambo, this is immensely illegal an' terrificly disgustin'.\"\n\nThe Chief of the Ochori looked round.\n\n\"Dis feller be dam' bad,\" was his effort.\n\nBones walked leisurely to the shady canopy under which the king sat, and\nKing Karata stared stupidly at the unexpected vision.\n\n\"O King,\" said Bones in the Akasavian vernacular which runs from Dacca\nto the Congo, \"this is an evil thing that you do--against all law.\"\n\nOpen-mouthed Karata continued to stare.\n\nTo the crowded kraal, on prisoner and warrior, councillor and dancing\nwoman alike, came a silence deep and unbroken.\n\nThey heard the words spoken in a familiar tongue, and marvelled that a\nwhite man should speak it. Bones was carrying a stick and taking\ndeliberate aim, and after two trial strokes he brought the nobbly end\nround with a \"swish!\"\n\nA bottle of square-face smashed into a thousand pieces, and there arose\non the hot air the sickly scent of crude spirits. Fascinated, silent,\nmotionless, King Karata, named not without reason \"The Terrible,\"\nwatched the destruction as bottle followed bottle.\n\nThen as a dim realization of the infamy filtered through his thick\nbrain, he rose with a growl like a savage animal, and Bones turned\nquickly. But Bosambo was quicker. One stride brought him to the king's\nside.\n\n\"Down, dog!\" he said. \"O Karata, you are very near the painted hut where\ndead kings lie.\"\n\nThe king sank back and glared to and fro.\n\nAll that was animal in him told of his danger; he smelt death in the\nmirthless grin of the white man; he smelt it as strongly under the hand\nof the tall native wearing the monkey-tails of chieftainship. If they\nwould only stand away from him they would die quickly enough. Let them\nget out of reach, and a shout, an order, would send them bloodily to the\nground with little kicks and twitches as the life ran out of them.\n\nBut they stood too close, and that order of his meant his death.\n\n\"O white man,\" he began.\n\n\"Listen, black man,\" said Bosambo, and lapsed into his English; \"hark\num, you dam' black nigger--what for you speak um so?\"\n\n\"You shall say 'master' to me, Karata,\" said Bones easily, \"for in my\nland 'white man' is evil talk.\"[8]\n\n[Footnote 8: In most native countries \"white man\" is seldom employed\nsave as a piece of insolence. It is equivalent to the practice of\nreferring to the natives as niggers.]\n\n\"Master,\" said the king sullenly, \"this is a strange thing--for I see\nthat you are English and we be servants of another king. Also it is\nforbidden that any white--that any master should stand in my kraal\nwithout my word, and I have driven even Igselensi from my face.\"\n\n\"That is all foolish talk, Karata,\" said Bones. \"This is good talk:\nshall Karata live or shall he die? This you shall say. If you send away\nthis palaver and say to your people that we are folk whom you desire\nshall live in the shadow of the king's hut, then you live. Let him say\nless than this, Bosambo, and you strike quickly.\"\n\nThe king looked from face to face. Bones had his hand in the uniform\njacket pocket. Bosambo balanced his killing-spear on the palm of his\nhand, the chief saw with the eye of an expert that the edge was razor\nsharp.\n\nThen he turned to the group whom Bones had motioned away when he started\nto speak to the king.\n\n\"This palaver is finished,\" he said, \"and the white lord stays in my hut\nfor a night.\"\n\n\"Good egg,\" said Bones as the crowd streamed from the kraal.\n\nSenhor Bonaventura heard of the arrival of a white man at the chief's\ngreat kraal and was not perturbed, because there were certain favourite\ntraders who came to the king from time to time. He was more concerned by\nthe fact that a labour draft of eight hundred men who had been promised\nby Karata had not yet reached Moanda, but frantic panic came from the\nremarkable information of Karata's eccentricities which had reached him\nfrom his lieutenant.\n\nThe duc's letter may be reproduced.\n\n     \"ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT SENHOR,\n\n     \"It is with joy that I announce to you the most remarkable\n     reformation of King Karata. The news was brought to me that the\n     king had received a number of visitors of an unauthorized\n     character, and though I had, as I have reported to you, Illustrious\n     and Excellent Senhor, the most unpleasant experience at the hands\n     of the king, I deemed it advisable to go to the city of the Greater\n     M'fusi and conduct an inquiry.\n\n     \"I learnt that the king had indeed received the visitors, and that\n     they had departed on the morning of my arrival carrying with them\n     one of their number who was sick. With this party was a white man.\n     But the most remarkable circumstance, Illustrious and Excellent\n     Senhor, was that the king had called a midnight palaver of his\n     councillors and high people of state and had told them that the\n     strangers had brought news of such sorrowful character that for\n     four moons it would be forbidden to look upon his face. At the end\n     of that period he would disappear from the earth and become a god\n     amongst the stars.\n\n     \"At these words, Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, the king with\n     some reluctance took from one of the strangers a bag in which two\n     eyes had been cut, and pulled it over his head and went back into\n     his hut.\n\n     \"Since then he has done many remarkable things. He has forbidden\n     the importation of drink, and has freed all labour men to their\n     homes. He has nominated Zifingini, the elder chief of the M'fusi,\n     to be king after his departure, and has added another fighting\n     regiment to his army.\n\n     \"He is quite changed, and though they cannot see his face and he\n     has banished all his wives, relatives and councillors to a distant\n     village, he is more popular than ever.\n\n     \"Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, I feel that at last I am seeing\n     the end of the old r\u00e9gime and that we may look forward to a period\n     of sobriety and prosperity in the M'fusi.\n\n     \"Receive the assurance, Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, of my\n     distinguished consideration.\"\n\nHis Excellency went purple and white.\n\n\"Holy mother!\" he spluttered apoplectically, \"this is ruin!\"\n\nWith trembling hands he wrote a telegram. Translated in its sense it was\nto this effect--\n\n\"Recall de Sagosta without fail or there will be nothing doing on pay\nday.\"\n\nHe saw this dispatched on its way, and returned to his bureau. He picked\nup the duc's letter and read it again: then he saw there was a\npostscript.\n\n     \"P.S.--In regard to the strangers who visited the king, the man\n     they carried away on a closed litter was very sick indeed,\n     according to the accounts of woodmen who met the party. He was\n     raving at the top of his voice, but the white man was singing very\n     loudly.\n\n     \"P.SS.--I have just heard, Illustrious and Excellent Senhor, that\n     the Hooded King (as his people call him) has sent off all his\n     richest treasures and many others which he has taken from the huts\n     of his deported relatives to one Bosambo, who is a chief of the\n     Ochori in British Territory, and is distantly related to Senhor\n     Sanders, the Commissioner of that Territory.\"\n\n                              THE END\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\n\nMinor changes have been made to correct typesetter's errors; in all\nother respects, every effort has been made to be true to the author's\nwords and intent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Keepers of the King's Peace, by Edgar Wallace\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE KEEPERS OF THE KING'S PEACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25803-8.txt or 25803-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/8/0/25803/\n\nProduced by D Alexander and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
