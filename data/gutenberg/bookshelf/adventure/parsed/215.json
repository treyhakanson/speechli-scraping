Into the Primitive\n\n\n         \"Old longings nomadic leap,\n          Chafing at custom's chain;\n          Again from its brumal sleep\n          Wakens the ferine strain.\"\n\nBuck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble\nwas brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong\nof muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.\nBecause men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal,\nand because steamship and transportation companies were booming the\nfind, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted\ndogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by\nwhich to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.\n\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge\nMiller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden\namong the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide\ncool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by\ngravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and\nunder the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on\neven a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables,\nwhere a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants'\ncottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors,\ngreen pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping\nplant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge\nMiller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot\nafternoon.\n\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he\nhad lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other\ndogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did\nnot count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived\nobscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the\nJapanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,--strange creatures that\nrarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand,\nthere were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped\nfearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them\nand protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.\n\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.\nHe plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons;\nhe escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight\nor early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet\nbefore the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his\nback, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through\nwild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even\nbeyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the\nterriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly\nignored, for he was king,--king over all creeping, crawling, flying\nthings of Judge Miller's place, humans included.\n\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable\ncompanion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was\nnot so large,--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,--for his\nmother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred\nand forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good\nliving and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right\nroyal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived\nthe life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even\na trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of\ntheir insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere\npampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down\nthe fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing\nraces, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.\n\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the\nKlondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.\nBut Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,\none of the gardener's helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel\nhad one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his\ngambling, he had one besetting weakness--faith in a system; and this\nmade his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while\nthe wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and\nnumerous progeny.\n\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the\nboys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of\nManuel's treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard\non what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a\nsolitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known\nas College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between\nthem.\n\n\"You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm,\" the stranger said\ngruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck's neck\nunder the collar.\n\n\"Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee,\" said Manuel, and the stranger\ngrunted a ready affirmative.\n\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an\nunwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to\ngive them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends\nof the rope were placed in the stranger's hands, he growled menacingly.\nHe had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to\nintimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope tightened around\nhis neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man,\nwho met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft\ntwist threw him over on his back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly,\nwhile Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and\nhis great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so\nvilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. But his\nstrength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was\nflagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.\n\nThe next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and\nthat he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse\nshriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He\nhad travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of\nriding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the\nunbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but\nBuck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they\nrelax till his senses were choked out of him once more.\n\n\"Yep, has fits,\" the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the\nbaggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. \"I'm\ntakin' 'm up for the boss to 'Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks\nthat he can cure 'm.\"\n\nConcerning that night's ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself,\nin a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.\n\n\"All I get is fifty for it,\" he grumbled; \"an' I wouldn't do it over for\na thousand, cold cash.\"\n\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg\nwas ripped from knee to ankle.\n\n\"How much did the other mug get?\" the saloon-keeper demanded.\n\n\"A hundred,\" was the reply. \"Wouldn't take a sou less, so help me.\"\n\n\"That makes a hundred and fifty,\" the saloon-keeper calculated; \"and\nhe's worth it, or I'm a squarehead.\"\n\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated\nhand. \"If I don't get the hydrophoby--\"\n\n\"It'll be because you was born to hang,\" laughed the saloon-keeper.\n\"Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,\" he added.\n\nDazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life\nhalf throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But he\nwas thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the\nheavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed, and he\nwas flung into a cagelike crate.\n\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and\nwounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did they\nwant with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent up in\nthis narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by the\nvague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night he\nsprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the\nJudge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face of\nthe saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow\ncandle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck's throat was\ntwisted into a savage growl.\n\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered\nand picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were\nevil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at\nthem through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks at him, which\nhe promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what\nthey wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be\nlifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he was imprisoned,\nbegan a passage through many hands. Clerks in the express office took\ncharge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried\nhim, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry steamer; he\nwas trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and finally he\nwas deposited in an express car.\n\nFor two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail\nof shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate\nnor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express\nmessengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he\nflung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed\nat him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,\nmewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he\nknew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed\nand waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water\ncaused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch. For\nthat matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had\nflung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched\nand swollen throat and tongue.\n\nHe was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given\nthem an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.\nThey would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was\nresolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during\nthose two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath\nthat boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned\nblood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was\nhe that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express\nmessengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at\nSeattle.\n\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,\nhigh-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged\ngenerously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.\nThat was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled\nhimself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a\nhatchet and a club.\n\n\"You ain't going to take him out now?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.\n\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried\nit in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the\nperformance.\n\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging\nand wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was\nthere on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get\nout as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.\n\n\"Now, you red-eyed devil,\" he said, when he had made an opening\nsufficient for the passage of Buck's body. At the same time he dropped\nthe hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.\n\nAnd Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the\nspring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot\neyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds\nof fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In\nmid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received\na shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an\nagonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and\nside. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not\nunderstand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again\non his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he\nwas brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was\nthe club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and\nas often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.\n\nAfter a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to\nrush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth\nand ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.\nThen the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on\nthe nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the\nexquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its\nferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the\nclub from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same\ntime wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle\nin the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head\nand chest.\n\nFor the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had\npurposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,\nknocked utterly senseless.\n\n\"He's no slouch at dog-breakin', that's wot I say,\" one of the men on\nthe wall cried enthusiastically.\n\n\"Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,\" was the reply of\nthe driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.\n\nBuck's senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he\nhad fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.\n\n\"'Answers to the name of Buck,'\" the man soliloquized, quoting from the\nsaloon-keeper's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate\nand contents. \"Well, Buck, my boy,\" he went on in a genial voice, \"we've\nhad our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at\nthat. You've learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all\n'll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I'll whale the\nstuffin' outa you. Understand?\"\n\nAs he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded,\nand though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand,\nhe endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank\neagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk,\nfrom the man's hand.\n\nHe was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for\nall, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned\nthe lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was\na revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,\nand he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer\naspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the\nlatent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs\ncame, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging\nand roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass\nunder the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he\nlooked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck:\na man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not\nnecessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he\ndid see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails,\nand licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate\nnor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.\n\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,\nand in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such\ntimes that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of\nthe dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never\ncame back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was\nglad each time when he was not selected.\n\nYet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who\nspat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck\ncould not understand.\n\n\"Sacredam!\" he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. \"Dat one dam bully\ndog! Eh? How moch?\"\n\n\"Three hundred, and a present at that,\" was the prompt reply of the man\nin the red sweater. \"And seem' it's government money, you ain't got no\nkick coming, eh, Perrault?\"\n\nPerrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed\nskyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine\nan animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its\ndespatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at\nBuck he knew that he was one in a thousand--\"One in ten t'ousand,\" he\ncommented mentally.\n\nBuck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a\ngood-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened\nman. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as\nCurly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it\nwas the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below\nby Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois.\nPerrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Francois was a\nFrench-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new kind\nof men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while\nhe developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to\nrespect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair\nmen, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the\nway of dogs to be fooled by dogs.\n\nIn the 'tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two other\ndogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had\nbeen brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied\na Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous\nsort of way, smiling into one's face the while he meditated some\nunderhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck's food at the\nfirst meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Francois's whip\nsang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained\nto Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Francois, he decided,\nand the half-breed began his rise in Buck's estimation.\n\nThe other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not\nattempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and\nhe showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and\nfurther, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. \"Dave\"\nhe was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took\ninterest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte\nSound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When\nBuck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as\nthough annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went\nto sleep again.\n\nDay and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,\nand though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that\nthe weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the\npropeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of\nexcitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change\nwas at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the\nfirst step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy\nsomething very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white\nstuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell\nupon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It\nbit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried\nit again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and\nhe felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II. The Law of Club and Fang\n\n\nBuck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was\nfilled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the\nheart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.\nNo lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be\nbored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment's safety. All\nwas confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.\nThere was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men\nwere not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who knew no\nlaw but the law of club and fang.\n\nHe had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his\nfirst experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was\na vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.\nCurly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she, in\nher friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown\nwolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning, only a leap\nin like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and\nCurly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw.\n\nIt was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there\nwas more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and\nsurrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not\ncomprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they\nwere licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again\nand leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar\nfashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This\nwas what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,\nsnarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath\nthe bristling mass of bodies.\n\nSo sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw\nSpitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw\nFrancois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men\nwith clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two\nminutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were\nclubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled\nsnow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing\nover her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to Buck to\ntrouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play. Once down,\nthat was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he never went\ndown. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment\nBuck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.\n\nBefore he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing\nof Curly, he received another shock. Francois fastened upon him an\narrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had seen\nthe grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses work,\nso he was set to work, hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that\nfringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though his\ndignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too\nwise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though\nit was all new and strange. Francois was stern, demanding instant\nobedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience;\nwhile Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck's hind quarters\nwhenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,\nand while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now\nand again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck\ninto the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined\ntuition of his two mates and Francois made remarkable progress. Ere they\nreturned to camp he knew enough to stop at \"ho,\" to go ahead at \"mush,\"\nto swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the\nloaded sled shot downhill at their heels.\n\n\"T'ree vair' good dogs,\" Francois told Perrault. \"Dat Buck, heem pool\nlak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt'ing.\"\n\nBy afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his\ndespatches, returned with two more dogs. \"Billee\" and \"Joe\" he called\nthem, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother though\nthey were, they were as different as day and night. Billee's one fault\nwas his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, sour and\nintrospective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck received\nthem in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz proceeded to\nthrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail appeasingly,\nturned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried\n(still appeasingly) when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his flank. But no\nmatter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his heels to face\nhim, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws\nclipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically\ngleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible was his\nappearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to\ncover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing\nBillee and drove him to the confines of the camp.\n\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean\nand gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a\nwarning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which\nmeans the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected\nnothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,\neven Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky\nenough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side.\nOf this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he\nhad of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed\nhis shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after\nBuck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had\nno more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave's, was to be left\nalone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed\none other and even more vital ambition.\n\nThat night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined\nby a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,\nas a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and Francois bombarded\nhim with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his\nconsternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind\nwas blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his\nwounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,\nbut the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and\ndisconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that\none place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed\nupon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning\nfast), and they let him go his way unmolested.\n\nFinally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own\nteam-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.\nAgain he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and\nagain he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he\nwould not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With\ndrooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly\ncircled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs\nand he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back,\nbristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a\nfriendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A\nwhiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under\nthe snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and\nwriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a\nbribe for peace, to lick Buck's face with his warm wet tongue.\n\nAnother lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently\nselected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a\nhole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined\nspace and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept\nsoundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with\nbad dreams.\n\nNor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.\nAt first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night\nand he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,\nand a great surge of fear swept through him--the fear of the wild thing\nfor the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own\nlife to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an\nunduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so\ncould not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted\nspasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders\nstood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into\nthe blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he\nlanded on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew\nwhere he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went\nfor a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night\nbefore.\n\nA shout from Francois hailed his appearance. \"Wot I say?\" the dog-driver\ncried to Perrault. \"Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing.\"\n\nPerrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government, bearing\nimportant despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was\nparticularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.\n\nThree more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total\nof nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in\nharness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon. Buck was\nglad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not\nparticularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which\nanimated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still\nmore surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They\nwere new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and\nunconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious\nthat the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by\ndelay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed\nthe supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and\nthe only thing in which they took delight.\n\nDave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then\ncame Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,\nto the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.\n\nBuck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he\nmight receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally\napt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing\ntheir teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He\nnever nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he\nstood in need of it. As Francois's whip backed him up, Buck found it\nto be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief\nhalt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both\nDave and Solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The\nresulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the\ntraces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he\nmastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. Francois's whip\nsnapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up\nhis feet and carefully examining them.\n\nIt was a hard day's run, up the Canon, through Sheep Camp, past the\nScales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of\nfeet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between\nthe salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely\nNorth. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the\ncraters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge\ncamp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were\nbuilding boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made\nhis hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all\ntoo early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his\nmates to the sled.\n\nThat day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next\nday, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked\nharder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of\nthe team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.\nFrancois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places\nwith him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself\non his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall\nice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at\nall.\n\nDay after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,\nthey broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them\nhitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always\nthey pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling\nto sleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of\nsun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go\nnowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.\nYet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life,\nreceived a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.\n\nHe swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life.\nA dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of\nhis unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was fighting\noff two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the others. To\nremedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger compel\nhim, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. He watched and\nlearned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and\nthief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned,\nhe duplicated the performance the following day, getting away with the\nwhole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was unsuspected; while\nDub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished\nfor Buck's misdeed.\n\nThis first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland\nenvironment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself\nto changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and\nterrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his\nmoral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for\nexistence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of\nlove and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;\nbut in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such\nthings into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he\nwould fail to prosper.\n\nNot that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and\nunconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his\ndays, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But\nthe club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more\nfundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a\nmoral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip; but\nthe completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability\nto flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his\nhide. He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his\nstomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of\nrespect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done because\nit was easier to do them than not to do them.\n\nHis development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard as\niron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an internal\nas well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter how\nloathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach\nextracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it\nto the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the toughest and\nstoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably keen, while his\nhearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest\nsound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril. He learned to bite\nthe ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes; and when\nhe was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole, he\nwould break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs. His most\nconspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a\nnight in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his\nnest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to\nleeward, sheltered and snug.\n\nAnd not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became\nalive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways\nhe remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs\nranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as\nthey ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut\nand slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten\nancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks\nwhich they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.\nThey came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been\nhis always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a\nstar and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust,\npointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through\nhim. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced\ntheir woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the\ncold, and dark.\n\nThus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged\nthrough him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had\nfound a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener's\nhelper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers\nsmall copies of himself.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast\n\n\nThe dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce\nconditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.\nHis newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy\nadjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did\nhe not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain\ndeliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness\nand precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz\nhe betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.\n\nOn the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous\nrival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even\nwent out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the\nfight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in\nthe trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted\naccident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp\non the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a\nwhite-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping\nplace. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a\nperpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Francois were compelled to\nmake their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake\nitself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light.\nA few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down\nthrough the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.\n\nClose in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm\nwas it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the\nfish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his\nration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told\nhim that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble\nwith his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared. He\nsprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz\nparticularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him\nthat his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own\nonly because of his great weight and size.\n\nFrancois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the\ndisrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. \"A-a-ah!\"\nhe cried to Buck. \"Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty\nt'eef!\"\n\nSpitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness\nas he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no less\neager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for\nthe advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing\nwhich projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past\nmany a weary mile of trail and toil.\n\nAn oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony\nframe, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of\npandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking\nfurry forms,--starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had\nscented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck\nand Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with\nstout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed\nby the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the\ngrub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box\nwas capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished\nbrutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon them\nunheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled\nnone the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.\n\nIn the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests\nonly to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such\ndogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.\nThey were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing\neyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them terrifying,\nirresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were swept back\nagainst the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by three huskies,\nand in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. The din\nwas frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks, dripping\nblood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. Joe\nwas snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of\na husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike, the malingerer,\nleaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of\nteeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was\nsprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. The warm\ntaste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. He flung\nhimself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own\nthroat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.\n\nPerrault and Francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,\nhurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled\nback before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a\nmoment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon\nwhich the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee, terrified\ninto bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the\nice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the team\nbehind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the\ntail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention\nof overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies,\nthere was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's\ncharge, then joined the flight out on the lake.\n\nLater, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the\nforest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not\none who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded\ngrievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky\nadded to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an eye;\nwhile Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons,\ncried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they limped warily\nback to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.\nFully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had chewed through\nthe sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact, nothing, no matter how\nremotely eatable, had escaped them. They had eaten a pair of Perrault's\nmoose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two\nfeet of lash from the end of Francois's whip. He broke from a mournful\ncontemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.\n\n\"Ah, my frien's,\" he said softly, \"mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many\nbites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t'ink, eh, Perrault?\"\n\nThe courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail\nstill between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break\nout among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses\ninto shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling\npainfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,\nand for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.\n\nThe Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,\nand it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held\nat all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty\nterrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was\naccomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,\nPerrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by\nthe long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time across\nthe hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the thermometer\nregistering fifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was\ncompelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.\n\nNothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had been\nchosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks, resolutely\nthrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from\ndim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent\nand crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. Once, the\nsled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were half-frozen and\nall but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The usual fire was\nnecessary to save them. They were coated solidly with ice, and the two\nmen kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close\nthat they were singed by the flames.\n\nAt another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up\nto Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on\nthe slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But\nbehind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled\nwas Francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.\n\nAgain, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape\nexcept up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while Francois\nprayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and\nthe last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,\none by one, to the cliff crest. Francois came up last, after the sled\nand load. Then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was\nultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the\nriver with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit.\n\nBy the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played out.\nThe rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make\nup lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered\nthirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to\nthe Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up\ntoward the Five Fingers.\n\nBuck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.\nHis had softened during the many generations since the day his last\nwild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he\nlimped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry as\nhe was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which Francois\nhad to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck's feet for half\nan hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own\nmoccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great relief, and\nBuck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a\ngrin one morning, when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his\nback, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge\nwithout them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out\nfoot-gear was thrown away.\n\nAt the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had\nnever been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced\nher condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog\nbristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a\ndog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew\nthat here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away he\nraced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she\ngain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great\nwas her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the island,\nflew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice\nto another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river,\nand in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, though he\ndid not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. Francois\ncalled to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one\nleap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that\nFrancois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand,\nand as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head.\n\nBuck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,\nhelpless. This was Spitz's opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice\nhis teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to\nthe bone. Then Francois's lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction\nof watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any\nof the teams.\n\n\"One devil, dat Spitz,\" remarked Perrault. \"Some dam day heem keel dat\nBuck.\"\n\n\"Dat Buck two devils,\" was Francois's rejoinder. \"All de tam I watch dat\nBuck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell\nan' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow. Sure. I\nknow.\"\n\nFrom then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and\nacknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this\nstrange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many\nSouthland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and\non trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and\nstarvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,\nmatching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a\nmasterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of\nthe man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out\nof his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could bide\nhis time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.\n\nIt was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck wanted\nit. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been\ngripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and\ntrace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which\nlures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts\nif they are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as\nwheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride\nthat laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and\nsullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride\nthat spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,\nletting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This was the\npride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered\nand shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.\nLikewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a possible\nlead-dog. And this was Buck's pride, too.\n\nHe openly threatened the other's leadership. He came between him and the\nshirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One night\nthere was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the malingerer,\ndid not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.\nFrancois called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was wild with wrath.\nHe raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely\nplace, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his\nhiding-place.\n\nBut when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,\nBuck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so\nshrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. Pike,\nwho had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,\nand sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a\nforgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Francois, chuckling at\nthe incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought\nhis lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck\nfrom his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into\nplay. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash\nlaid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many\ntimes offending Pike.\n\nIn the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still\ncontinued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it\ncraftily, when Francois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,\na general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks\nwere unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.\nThings no longer went right. There was continual bickering and jangling.\nTrouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck. He kept\nFrancois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the\nlife-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place\nsooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling\nand strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,\nfearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.\n\nBut the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson\none dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many\nmen, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the\nordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up\nand down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling\nbells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up\nto the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa\nClara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main\nthey were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine, at\ntwelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant,\nin which it was Buck's delight to join.\n\nWith the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping\nin the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow,\nthis song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it\nwas pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and\nwas more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. It\nwas an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the\nyounger world in a day when songs were sad. It was invested with the woe\nof unnumbered generations, this plaint by which Buck was so strangely\nstirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that\nwas of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the\ncold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. And that he should be\nstirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through\nthe ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling\nages.\n\nSeven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the\nsteep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and\nSalt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent\nthan those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,\nand he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things\nfavored him in this. The week's rest had recuperated the dogs and put\nthem in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was\npacked hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged\nin two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was\ntravelling light.\n\nThey made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and\nthe second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly.\nBut such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and\nvexation on the part of Francois. The insidious revolt led by Buck\nhad destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog\nleaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them\ninto all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader greatly\nto be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging\nhis authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped\nit down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and Joe fought\nSpitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And even\nBillee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half\nso placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz without\nsnarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct approached that\nof a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's\nvery nose.\n\nThe breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their\nrelations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever\namong themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and\nSol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the\nunending squabbling. Francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped\nthe snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always singing\namong the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back was turned\nthey were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip, while Buck\nbacked up the remainder of the team. Francois knew he was behind all the\ntrouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever ever again to be\ncaught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil\nhad become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to\nprecipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.\n\nAt the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a\nsnowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team\nwas in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest\nPolice, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit\nsped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of\nwhich it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while\nthe dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty\nstrong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low\nto the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap\nby leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale\nfrost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.\n\nAll that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men\nout from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things\nby chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to\nkill--all this was Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was\nranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living\nmeat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm\nblood.\n\nThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life\ncannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when\none is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is\nalive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist,\ncaught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the\nsoldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came\nto Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after\nthe food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the\nmoonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of\nhis nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time.\nHe was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,\nthe perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was\neverything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing\nitself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face\nof dead matter that did not move.\n\nBut Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack\nand cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend\naround. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost\nwraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger\nfrost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of\nthe rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white\nteeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man\nmay shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life's\napex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's\nchorus of delight.\n\nBuck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz,\nshoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled\nover and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as\nthough he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and\nleaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of\na trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips\nthat writhed and snarled.\n\nIn a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As\nthey circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the\nadvantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed\nto remember it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the\nthrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm.\nThere was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf\nquivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in\nthe frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these\ndogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an\nexpectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and\ntheir breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or\nstrange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been,\nthe wonted way of things.\n\nSpitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and\nacross Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of\ndogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never\nblind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his\nenemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till\nhe was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first\ndefended that attack.\n\nIn vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.\nWherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by\nthe fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,\nbut Buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard. Then he warmed up and\nenveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried\nfor the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and\neach time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took\nto rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his\nhead and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the\nshoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,\nBuck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.\n\nSpitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting\nhard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and\nwolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck\ngrew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for\nfooting. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started\nup; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank\ndown again and waited.\n\nBut Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness--imagination. He\nfought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as\nthough attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept\nlow to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg. There\nwas a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three\nlegs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and\nbroke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz\nstruggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming\neyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in\nupon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists\nin the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.\n\nThere was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing\nreserved for gentler climes. He manoeuvred for the final rush. The\ncircle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on\nhis flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half\ncrouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to\nfall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz\nquivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with\nhorrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck\nsprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely\nmet shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as\nSpitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful\nchampion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found\nit good.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership\n\n\n\"Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.\" This was\nFrancois's speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck\ncovered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed\nthem out.\n\n\"Dat Spitz fight lak hell,\" said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping\nrips and cuts.\n\n\"An' dat Buck fight lak two hells,\" was Francois's answer. \"An' now we\nmake good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.\"\n\nWhile Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the\ndog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place\nSpitz would have occupied as leader; but Francois, not noticing him,\nbrought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was\nthe best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him\nback and standing in his place.\n\n\"Eh? eh?\" Francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. \"Look at dat\nBuck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t'ink to take de job.\"\n\n\"Go 'way, Chook!\" he cried, but Buck refused to budge.\n\nHe took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled\nthreateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old\ndog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.\nFrancois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced\nSol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.\n\nFrancois was angry. \"Now, by Gar, I feex you!\" he cried, coming back\nwith a heavy club in his hand.\n\nBuck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor\ndid he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought\nforward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with\nbitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to\ndodge it if thrown by Francois, for he was become wise in the way of\nclubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he was\nready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated two\nor three steps. Francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.\nAfter some time of this, Francois threw down the club, thinking that\nBuck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He wanted, not to\nescape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his by right. He\nhad earned it, and he would not be content with less.\n\nPerrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better\npart of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,\nand his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after\nhim down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and drop\nof blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of\ntheir reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around and around\nthe camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would\ncome in and be good.\n\nFrancois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch\nand swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an\nhour gone. Francois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned\nsheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they\nwere beaten. Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called\nto Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Francois\nunfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place. The team\nstood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail.\nThere was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more Francois\ncalled, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.\n\n\"T'row down de club,\" Perrault commanded.\n\nFrancois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,\nand swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were\nfastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out\non to the river trail.\n\nHighly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he\nfound, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound\nBuck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,\nand quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior even\nof Spitz, of whom Francois had never seen an equal.\n\nBut it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that\nBuck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.\nIt was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil\nmightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they\ndid not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for all\nthey cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team, however, had\ngrown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their surprise was great\nnow that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.\n\nPike, who pulled at Buck's heels, and who never put an ounce more of his\nweight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was swiftly\nand repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was\npulling more than ever before in his life. The first night in camp,\nJoe, the sour one, was punished roundly--a thing that Spitz had never\nsucceeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior\nweight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for\nmercy.\n\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its\nold-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the\ntraces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were\nadded; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away\nFrancois's breath.\n\n\"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\" he cried. \"No, nevaire! Heem worth one\nt'ousan' dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?\"\n\nAnd Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day\nby day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and\nthere was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too cold.\nThe temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole\ntrip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump,\nwith but infrequent stoppages.\n\nThe Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they\ncovered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In\none run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to\nthe White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy miles\nof lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run\ntowed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night of the\nsecond week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with\nthe lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.\n\nIt was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty\nmiles. For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the\nmain street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while\nthe team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters\nand mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out\nthe town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public\ninterest turned to other idols. Next came official orders. Francois\ncalled Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. And that\nwas the last of Francois and Perrault. Like other men, they passed out\nof Buck's life for good.\n\nA Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company\nwith a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to\nDawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil\neach day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,\ncarrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow\nof the Pole.\n\nBuck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in\nit after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,\nwhether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a\nmonotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was\nvery like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,\nfires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,\nothers harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before\nthe darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.\nSome pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the\nbeds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the\ndogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it\nwas good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so\nwith the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were\nfierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought\nBuck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got\nout of his way.\n\nBest of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched\nunder him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes\nblinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's\nbig house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement\nswimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the Japanese\npug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of\nCurly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had eaten or\nwould like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very dim and\ndistant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more potent were\nthe memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before\na seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of\nhis ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still\nlater, in him, quickened and become alive again.\n\nSometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it\nseemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched\nby this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed\ncook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,\nwith muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and\nswelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head slanted\nback under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and seemed very\nmuch afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching\nin his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a\nheavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but naked, a ragged and\nfire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body there\nwas much hair. In some places, across the chest and shoulders and down\nthe outside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a thick\nfur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from\nthe hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About his body there was\na peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick\nalertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and\nunseen.\n\nAt other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between\nhis legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his\nhands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.\nAnd beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many\ngleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the\neyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their\nbodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.\nAnd dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the\nfire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to\nrise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his\nneck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the\nhalf-breed cook shouted at him, \"Hey, you Buck, wake up!\" Whereupon the\nother world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and he\nwould get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.\n\nIt was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore\nthem down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they\nmade Dawson, and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at\nleast. But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the\nBarracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the\ndrivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This\nmeant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier pulling\nfor the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did their\nbest for the animals.\n\nEach night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers\nate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of\nthe dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the beginning\nof the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds\nthe whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life\nof the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates up to their work and\nmaintaining discipline, though he, too, was very tired. Billee cried and\nwhimpered regularly in his sleep each night. Joe was sourer than ever,\nand Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.\n\nBut it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with\nhim. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at\nonce made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness\nand down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the\nmorning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of\nthe sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The\ndriver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became\ninterested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over their\nlast pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation.\nHe was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded\ntill he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they could\nlocate no broken bones, could not make it out.\n\nBy the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling\nrepeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took\nhim out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.\nHis intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.\nSick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling\nwhile the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when\nhe saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the\npride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not\nbear that another dog should do his work.\n\nWhen the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the\nbeaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and\ntrying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving\nto leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the\nwhile whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed\ntried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the\nstinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. Dave\nrefused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was\neasy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the\ngoing was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell, and lay where he\nfell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.\n\nWith the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind\ntill the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to\nhis own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver lingered a moment\nto get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then he returned and\nstarted his dogs. They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of\nexertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. The\ndriver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He called his\ncomrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both of\nSol-leks's traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his\nproper place.\n\nHe pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His\ncomrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied\nthe work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where\ndogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut\nout of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die\nanyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So\nhe was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more\nthan once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.\nSeveral times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the\nsled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.\n\nBut he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for\nhim by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up\ntime he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on\nhis feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly\ntoward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would advance\nhis fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement,\nwhen he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more\ninches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay\ngasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him\nmournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river\ntimber.\n\nHere the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his\nsteps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot\nrang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells\ntinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and\nevery dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail\n\n\nThirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck\nand his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a wretched\nstate, worn out and worn down. Buck's one hundred and forty pounds\nhad dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates, though\nlighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the\nmalingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully\nfeigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,\nand Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.\n\nThey were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.\nTheir feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling\nthe fatigue of a day's travel. There was nothing the matter with them\nexcept that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that\ncomes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a\nmatter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the\nslow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no\npower of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had\nbeen all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,\nevery cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less\nthan five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during\nthe last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.\nWhen they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.\nThey could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just\nmanaged to keep out of the way of the sled.\n\n\"Mush on, poor sore feets,\" the driver encouraged them as they tottered\ndown the main street of Skaguay. \"Dis is de las'. Den we get one long\nres'. Eh? For sure. One bully long res'.\"\n\nThe drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had\ncovered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest, and in the nature of\nreason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so\nmany were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were the\nsweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the congested\nmail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were official orders.\nFresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those\nworthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,\nsince dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.\n\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really\ntired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two\nmen from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a\nsong. The men addressed each other as \"Hal\" and \"Charles.\" Charles was\na middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a\nmustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the\nlimply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or\ntwenty, with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about\nhim on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the\nmost salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness--a callowness\nsheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why\nsuch as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things\nthat passes understanding.\n\nBuck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the\nGovernment agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train\ndrivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and\nFrancois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his mates\nto the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent\nhalf stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a\nwoman. \"Mercedes\" the men called her. She was Charles's wife and Hal's\nsister--a nice family party.\n\nBuck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent\nand load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner,\nbut no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle\nthree times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed\naway unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and\nkept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When they put\na clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it should go on\nthe back; and when they had put it on the back, and covered it over\nwith a couple of other bundles, she discovered overlooked articles which\ncould abide nowhere else but in that very sack, and they unloaded again.\n\nThree men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and\nwinking at one another.\n\n\"You've got a right smart load as it is,\" said one of them; \"and it's\nnot me should tell you your business, but I wouldn't tote that tent\nalong if I was you.\"\n\n\"Undreamed of!\" cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.\n\"However in the world could I manage without a tent?\"\n\n\"It's springtime, and you won't get any more cold weather,\" the man\nreplied.\n\nShe shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and\nends on top the mountainous load.\n\n\"Think it'll ride?\" one of the men asked.\n\n\"Why shouldn't it?\" Charles demanded rather shortly.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, that's all right,\" the man hastened meekly to\nsay. \"I was just a-wonderin', that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.\"\n\nCharles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,\nwhich was not in the least well.\n\n\"An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption\nbehind them,\" affirmed a second of the men.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the\ngee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. \"Mush!\" he\nshouted. \"Mush on there!\"\n\nThe dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few\nmoments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.\n\n\"The lazy brutes, I'll show them,\" he cried, preparing to lash out at\nthem with the whip.\n\nBut Mercedes interfered, crying, \"Oh, Hal, you mustn't,\" as she caught\nhold of the whip and wrenched it from him. \"The poor dears! Now you\nmust promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or I\nwon't go a step.\"\n\n\"Precious lot you know about dogs,\" her brother sneered; \"and I wish\nyou'd leave me alone. They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip\nthem to get anything out of them. That's their way. You ask any one. Ask\none of those men.\"\n\nMercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain\nwritten in her pretty face.\n\n\"They're weak as water, if you want to know,\" came the reply from one\nof the men. \"Plum tuckered out, that's what's the matter. They need a\nrest.\"\n\n\"Rest be blanked,\" said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes said,\n\"Oh!\" in pain and sorrow at the oath.\n\nBut she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of\nher brother. \"Never mind that man,\" she said pointedly. \"You're driving\nour dogs, and you do what you think best with them.\"\n\nAgain Hal's whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the\nbreast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,\nand put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an\nanchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was\nwhistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on\nher knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around\nhis neck.\n\n\"You poor, poor dears,\" she cried sympathetically, \"why don't you pull\nhard?--then you wouldn't be whipped.\" Buck did not like her, but he\nwas feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day's\nmiserable work.\n\nOne of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot\nspeech, now spoke up:--\n\n\"It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs'\nsakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by\nbreaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight\nagainst the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.\"\n\nA third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,\nHal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The\noverloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates struggling\nfrantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead the path\nturned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have required\nan experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal was not\nsuch a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling\nhalf its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. The\nlightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry because\nof the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. Buck was\nraging. He broke into a run, the team following his lead. Hal cried\n\"Whoa! whoa!\" but they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off his\nfeet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the\nstreet, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder\nof the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.\n\nKind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered\nbelongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,\nif they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and\nhis sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and\noverhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh,\nfor canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about. \"Blankets\nfor a hotel\" quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. \"Half as\nmany is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and all those\ndishes,--who's going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you think\nyou're travelling on a Pullman?\"\n\nAnd so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes\ncried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article\nafter article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in\nparticular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,\nrocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go\nan inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to\neverything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even\narticles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,\nwhen she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her\nmen and went through them like a tornado.\n\nThis accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a\nformidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six\nOutside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek\nand Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record\ntrip, brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though\npractically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three\nwere short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other\ntwo were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know\nanything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with\ndisgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not\nto do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly\nto trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were\nbewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which\nthey found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The\ntwo mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things\nbreakable about them.\n\nWith the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by\ntwenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything\nbut bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were\nproud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. They\nhad seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in from\nDawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. In\nthe nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should\nnot drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food\nfor fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know this. They had\nworked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,\nso many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded\ncomprehensively, it was all so very simple.\n\nLate next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was\nnothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They were\nstarting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance between Salt\nWater and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing\nthe same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was not in\nthe work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and\nfrightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.\n\nBuck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the\nwoman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by\nit became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all\nthings, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to\npitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get\nthe sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they\nwere occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they did\nnot make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started\nat all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the\ndistance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.\n\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they\nhastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding\nwould commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained\nby chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.\nAnd when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal\ndecided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to\ncap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver\nin her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she\nstole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that\nBuck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making poor\ntime, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.\n\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his\ndog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,\nthat for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So\nhe cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's\ntravel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were\nfrustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a\nsimple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to\nmake the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way\nearlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not\nonly did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to\nwork themselves.\n\nThe first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always\ngetting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful\nworker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from\nbad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt's revolver. It\nis a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the\nration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less\nthan die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went first,\nfollowed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging\nmore grittily on to life, but going in the end.\n\nBy this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had\nfallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,\nArctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and\nwomanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied\nwith weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and\nbrother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.\nTheir irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled\nupon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail which\ncomes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech\nand kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no\ninkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles\nached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this\nthey became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in\nthe morning and last at night.\n\nCharles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was\nthe cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the\nwork, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.\nSometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.\nThe result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from\na dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute\nwhich concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the\nrest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands\nof miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal's views on art, or the\nsort of society plays his mother's brother wrote, should have\nanything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes\ncomprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that\ndirection as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices. And\nthat Charles's sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the\nbuilding of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who disburdened\nherself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a\nfew other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family. In the\nmeantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs\nunfed.\n\nMercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. She was\npretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But\nthe present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save\nchivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon\nwhich impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative,\nshe made their lives unendurable. She no longer considered the dogs, and\nbecause she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on the sled. She\nwas pretty and soft, but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds--a\nlusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.\nShe rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the sled stood\nstill. Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded with her,\nentreated, the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of\ntheir brutality.\n\nOn one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never\ndid it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat\ndown on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After\nthey had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for\nher, and by main strength put her on the sled again.\n\nIn the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of\ntheir animals. Hal's theory, which he practised on others, was that one\nmust get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and\nbrother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club.\nAt the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw\noffered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt's\nrevolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip. A poor\nsubstitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the\nstarved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen state it\nwas more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into\nhis stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and\ninto a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.\n\nAnd through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in\na nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he\nfell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him\nto his feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his\nbeautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted\nwith dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him. His muscles had\nwasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so\nthat each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly\nthrough the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was\nheartbreaking, only Buck's heart was unbreakable. The man in the red\nsweater had proved that.\n\nAs it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating\nskeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very\ngreat misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the\nbruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant,\njust as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and\ndistant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply\nso many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a\nhalt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the\nspark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip\nfell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to\ntheir feet and staggered on.\n\nThere came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.\nHal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked Billee\non the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the\nharness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw, and\nthey knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day Koona\nwent, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be malignant;\nPike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious enough\nlonger to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil\nof trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with\nwhich to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who\nwas now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and Buck,\nstill at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or\nstriving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping\nthe trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.\n\nIt was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware\nof it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three\nin the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long\nday was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way\nto the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all\nthe land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that\nlived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not\nmoved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines.\nThe willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines\nwere putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and\nin the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into\nthe sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the\nforest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked\nthe wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the\nair.\n\nFrom every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of\nunseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon\nwas straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away\nfrom beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang\nand spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into\nthe river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening\nlife, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like\nwayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.\n\nWith the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing\ninnocuously, and Charles's eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into\nJohn Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted,\nthe dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes\ndried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log\nto rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great\nstiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last\ntouches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled\nand listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse\nadvice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that\nit would not be followed.\n\n\"They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and\nthat the best thing for us to do was to lay over,\" Hal said in response\nto Thornton's warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. \"They\ntold us we couldn't make White River, and here we are.\" This last with a\nsneering ring of triumph in it.\n\n\"And they told you true,\" John Thornton answered. \"The bottom's likely\nto drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,\ncould have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn't risk my carcass on\nthat ice for all the gold in Alaska.\"\n\n\"That's because you're not a fool, I suppose,\" said Hal. \"All the same,\nwe'll go on to Dawson.\" He uncoiled his whip. \"Get up there, Buck! Hi!\nGet up there! Mush on!\"\n\nThornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool\nand his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the\nscheme of things.\n\nBut the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed\ninto the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed\nout, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed\nhis lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.\nJoe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he\nfell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck\nmade no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into\nhim again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times\nThornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture\ncame into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked\nirresolutely up and down.\n\nThis was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason\nto drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.\nBuck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon\nhim. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he\nhad made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of impending\ndoom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank, and\nit had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice he had\nfelt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster close at\nhand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive\nhim. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so far gone was\nhe, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall upon\nhim, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly\nout. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he was\naware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He\nno longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of\nthe club upon his body. But it was no longer his body, it seemed so far\naway.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was\ninarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang\nupon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as\nthough struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on\nwistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his\nstiffness.\n\nJohn Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too\nconvulsed with rage to speak.\n\n\"If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you,\" he at last managed to say\nin a choking voice.\n\n\"It's my dog,\" Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came\nback. \"Get out of my way, or I'll fix you. I'm going to Dawson.\"\n\nThornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting\nout of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed,\ncried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.\nThornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife\nto the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.\nThen he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck's\ntraces.\n\nHal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his\nsister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of\nfurther use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out\nfrom the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head\nto see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were\nJoe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the\nloaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in\nthe rear.\n\nAs Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly\nhands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed\nnothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the\nsled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along\nover the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,\nand the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes's\nscream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to\nrun back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans\ndisappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had\ndropped out of the trail.\n\nJohn Thornton and Buck looked at each other.\n\n\"You poor devil,\" said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI. For the Love of a Man\n\n\nWhen John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners\nhad made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves\nup the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still\nlimping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued\nwarm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river\nbank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening\nlazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back\nhis strength.\n\nA rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,\nand it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his\nmuscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For\nthat matter, they were all loafing,--Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet\nand Nig,--waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to\nDawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with\nBuck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first\nadvances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a\nmother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck's\nwounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,\nshe performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her\nministrations as much as he did for Thornton's. Nig, equally friendly,\nthough less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and\nhalf deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.\n\nTo Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They\nseemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck\ngrew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in\nwhich Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion\nBuck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,\ngenuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never\nexperienced at Judge Miller's down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.\nWith the Judge's sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a working\npartnership; with the Judge's grandsons, a sort of pompous guardianship;\nand with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified friendship. But love\nthat was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it\nhad taken John Thornton to arouse.\n\nThis man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was\nthe ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a\nsense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as\nif they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw\nfurther. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to\nsit down for a long talk with them (\"gas\" he called it) was as much his\ndelight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between\nhis hands, and resting his own head upon Buck's, of shaking him back\nand forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love\nnames. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of\nmurmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart\nwould be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And when,\nreleased, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes eloquent,\nhis throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion remained\nwithout movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim, \"God! you can\nall but speak!\"\n\nBuck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would\noften seize Thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the\nflesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as\nBuck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this\nfeigned bite for a caress.\n\nFor the most part, however, Buck's love was expressed in adoration.\nWhile he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to\nhim, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove\nher nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,\nwho would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton's knee, Buck was\ncontent to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,\nat Thornton's feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it, studying\nit, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression, every\nmovement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he would lie\nfarther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of the man and\nthe occasional movements of his body. And often, such was the communion\nin which they lived, the strength of Buck's gaze would draw John\nThornton's head around, and he would return the gaze, without speech,\nhis heart shining out of his eyes as Buck's heart shone out.\n\nFor a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out\nof his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it\nagain, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he\nhad come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could\nbe permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as\nPerrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in\nthe night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times\nhe would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of\nthe tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's\nbreathing.\n\nBut in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed\nto bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,\nwhich the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.\nFaithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet\nhe retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come\nin from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire, rather than a dog\nof the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of\ncivilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from\nthis man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate\nan instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape\ndetection.\n\nHis face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he\nfought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too\ngood-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to John Thornton;\nbut the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly\nacknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with\na terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the\nlaw of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back\nfrom a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from\nSpitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew\nthere was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while to show\nmercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial life. It was\nmisunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. Kill\nor be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out\nof the depths of Time, he obeyed.\n\nHe was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He\nlinked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed\nthrough him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and\nseasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton's fire, a broad-breasted dog,\nwhite-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all\nmanner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,\ntasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,\nscenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the\nsounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,\ndirecting his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,\nand dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff\nof his dreams.\n\nSo peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and\nthe claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a\ncall was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously\nthrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire\nand the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on\nand on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the\ncall sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he gained\nthe soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton\ndrew him back to the fire again.\n\nThornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance\ntravellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all,\nand from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When\nThornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,\nBuck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton;\nafter that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors\nfrom them as though he favored them by accepting. They were of the same\nlarge type as Thornton, living close to the earth, thinking simply and\nseeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the\nsaw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his ways, and did not\ninsist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig.\n\nFor Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone among\nmen, could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling. Nothing\nwas too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day (they had\ngrub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson\nfor the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the\ncrest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three\nhundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his\nshoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he drew the attention\nof Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind. \"Jump, Buck!\" he\ncommanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm. The next instant he\nwas grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were\ndragging them back into safety.\n\n\"It's uncanny,\" Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their\nspeech.\n\nThornton shook his head. \"No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.\nDo you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.\"\n\n\"I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he's\naround,\" Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.\n\n\"Py Jingo!\" was Hans's contribution. \"Not mineself either.\"\n\nIt was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete's apprehensions\nwere realized. \"Black\" Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had\nbeen picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton\nstepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a\ncorner, head on paws, watching his master's every action. Burton struck\nout, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent\nspinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of\nthe bar.\n\nThose who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a\nsomething which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck's body\nrise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton's throat. The man\nsaved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled\nbackward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth\nfrom the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time\nthe man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn open.\nThen the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a surgeon\nchecked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling furiously,\nattempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of hostile\nclubs. A \"miners' meeting,\" called on the spot, decided that the dog had\nsufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his reputation was\nmade, and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska.\n\nLater on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton's life in\nquite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow\npoling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans\nand Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from\ntree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent\nby means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the\nbank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off\nhis master.\n\nAt a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks\njutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton\npoled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in\nhis hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,\nand was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when\nHans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat flirted\nover and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton, flung sheer\nout of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids,\na stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.\n\nBuck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred\nyards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt\nhim grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his\nsplendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress\ndown-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where the\nwild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks\nwhich thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck of the\nwater as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful,\nand Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped furiously\nover a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with crushing\nforce. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing Buck, and\nabove the roar of the churning water shouted: \"Go, Buck! Go!\"\n\nBuck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling\ndesperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton's command\nrepeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as\nthough for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam\npowerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point\nwhere swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.\n\nThey knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face\nof that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast as\nthey could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging\non. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to\nBuck's neck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle\nhim nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the stream. He struck\nout boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. He discovered the\nmistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen\nstrokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.\n\nHans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The\nrope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked\nunder the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body\nstruck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and\nHans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him\nand the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The\nfaint sound of Thornton's voice came to them, and though they could not\nmake out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His\nmaster's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his\nfeet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous\ndeparture.\n\nAgain the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck\nout, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,\nbut he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,\npermitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on\ntill he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with\nthe speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him\ncoming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole\nforce of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both arms\naround the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and\nBuck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,\nsometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the\njagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the\nbank.\n\nThornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back\nand forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for\nBuck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a\nhowl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton was\nhimself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck's body,\nwhen he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.\n\n\"That settles it,\" he announced. \"We camp right here.\" And camp they\ndid, till Buck's ribs knitted and he was able to travel.\n\nThat winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,\nperhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem-pole\nof Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three\nmen; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and were\nenabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East, where miners\nhad not yet appeared. It was brought about by a conversation in the\nEldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.\nBuck, because of his record, was the target for these men, and Thornton\nwas driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of half an hour one man\nstated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and\nwalk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third,\nseven hundred.\n\n\"Pooh! pooh!\" said John Thornton; \"Buck can start a thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?\" demanded\nMatthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.\n\n\"And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,\" John\nThornton said coolly.\n\n\"Well,\" Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could\nhear, \"I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't. And there it\nis.\" So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna\nsausage down upon the bar.\n\nNobody spoke. Thornton's bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He\ncould feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had\ntricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds.\nHalf a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great faith in\nBuck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a\nload; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes\nof a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had no\nthousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.\n\n\"I've got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of\nflour on it,\" Matthewson went on with brutal directness; \"so don't let\nthat hinder you.\"\n\nThornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from\nface to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of\nthought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start\nit going again. The face of Jim O'Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time\ncomrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him\nto do what he would never have dreamed of doing.\n\n\"Can you lend me a thousand?\" he asked, almost in a whisper.\n\n\"Sure,\" answered O'Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of\nMatthewson's. \"Though it's little faith I'm having, John, that the beast\ncan do the trick.\"\n\nThe Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The\ntables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see\nthe outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred\nand mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson's\nsled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a\ncouple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the\nrunners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of two\nto one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose concerning\nthe phrase \"break out.\" O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege\nto knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to \"break it out\" from a dead\nstandstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the\nrunners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had\nwitnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds\nwent up to three to one against Buck.\n\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now that\nhe looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team\nof ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the\ntask appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.\n\n\"Three to one!\" he proclaimed. \"I'll lay you another thousand at that\nfigure, Thornton. What d'ye say?\"\n\nThornton's doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\naroused--the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize\nthe impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He called\nHans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own the three\npartners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the ebb of\ntheir fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it\nunhesitatingly against Matthewson's six hundred.\n\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was\nput into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and\nhe felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.\nMurmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in\nperfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one\nhundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and\nvirility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the neck and\nacross the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and\nseemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each\nparticular hair alive and active. The great breast and heavy fore legs\nwere no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the\nmuscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men felt these\nmuscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two\nto one.\n\n\"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king\nof the Skookum Benches. \"I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\"\n\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side.\n\n\"You must stand off from him,\" Matthewson protested. \"Free play and\nplenty of room.\"\n\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent\nanimal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their\neyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.\n\nThornton knelt down by Buck's side. He took his head in his two hands\nand rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his\nwont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \"As you\nlove me, Buck. As you love me,\" was what he whispered. Buck whined with\nsuppressed eagerness.\n\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It\nseemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his\nmittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing\nslowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of speech,\nbut of love. Thornton stepped well back.\n\n\"Now, Buck,\" he said.\n\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several\ninches. It was the way he had learned.\n\n\"Gee!\" Thornton's voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\n\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up\nthe slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp\ncrackling.\n\n\"Haw!\" Thornton commanded.\n\nBuck duplicated the manoeuvre, this time to the left. The crackling\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.\n\n\"Now, MUSH!\"\n\nThornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body\nwas gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles\nwrithing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great\nchest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his\nfeet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it\nnever really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two\ninches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum,\nhe caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\n\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they\nhad ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck\nwith short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he\nneared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,\na cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed\nthe firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself loose,\neven Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men were\nshaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a\ngeneral incoherent babel.\n\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head,\nand he was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and\nlovingly.\n\n\"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \"I'll give you\na thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir--twelve hundred, sir.\"\n\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming\nfrankly down his cheeks. \"Sir,\" he said to the Skookum Bench king, \"no,\nsir. You can go to hell, sir. It's the best I can do for you, sir.\"\n\nBuck seized Thornton's hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back\nto a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to\ninterrupt.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII. The Sounding of the Call\n\n\nWhen Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John\nThornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts\nand to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine,\nthe history of which was as old as the history of the country. Many men\nhad sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were who had\nnever returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and\nshrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The oldest tradition\nstopped before it got back to him. From the beginning there had been an\nancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine\nthe site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that\nwere unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.\n\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were\ndead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a\ndozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve\nwhere men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded\nseventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,\npassed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart itself\nbecame a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the\nbackbone of the continent.\n\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the\nwild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the\nwilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being\nin no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the\nday's travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on\ntravelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come\nto it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the\nbill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the\nsled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.\n\nTo Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite\nwandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold\non steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here\nand there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen\nmuck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the\nfire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all\naccording to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer\narrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue\nmountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender\nboats whipsawed from the standing forest.\n\nThe months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the\nuncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if\nthe Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,\nshivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber\nline and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming\ngnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and\nflowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall\nof the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent,\nwhere wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of\nlife--only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered\nplaces, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.\n\nAnd through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of\nmen who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the\nforest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the\npath began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the\nman who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time\nthey chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and\namid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled\nflint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days\nin the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins\npacked flat, And that was all--no hint as to the man who in an early day\nhad reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.\n\nSpring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they\nfound, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where\nthe gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan.\nThey sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of\ndollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold\nwas sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled\nlike so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they\ntoiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped\nthe treasure up.\n\nThere was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now\nand again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by\nthe fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more\nfrequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,\nblinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which\nhe remembered.\n\nThe salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the\nhairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands\nclasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and\nawakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness\nand fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,\nwhere the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered,\nit was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs\nprepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the\nforest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man's heels; and they\nwere alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and\nnostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. The\nhairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on\nthe ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen\nfeet apart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing his\ngrip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the\nground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees\nwherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he slept.\n\nAnd closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still\nsounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest\nand strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness,\nand he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.\nSometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though\nit were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood might\ndictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or into the\nblack soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth\nsmells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind\nfungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all\nthat moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that he hoped\nto surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not know why\nhe did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and did not\nreason about them at all.\n\nIrresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing\nlazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and his\nears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet\nand dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and\nacross the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run\ndown dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the\nwoods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could\nwatch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But especially\nhe loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening\nto the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and\nsounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something\nthat called--called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him to come.\n\nOne night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils\nquivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the\nforest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),\ndistinct and definite as never before,--a long-drawn howl, like, yet\nunlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old familiar\nway, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping camp and in\nswift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer to the cry\nhe went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an\nopen place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with\nnose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.\n\nHe had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense\nhis presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered\ncompactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted\ncare. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of\nfriendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild\nbeasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with\nwild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind channel,\nin the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The wolf\nwhirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe and\nof all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his teeth\ntogether in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.\n\nBuck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with\nfriendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made\nthree of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck's shoulder.\nWatching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time\nand again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor\ncondition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He would run\ntill Buck's head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at\nbay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.\n\nBut in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding\nthat no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they\nbecame friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with\nwhich fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the\nwolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was\ngoing somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they\nran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed,\ninto the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where\nit took its rise.\n\nOn the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level\ncountry where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and\nthrough these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the\nsun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He\nknew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood\nbrother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories\nwere coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he\nstirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done\nthis thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,\nand he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked\nearth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.\n\nThey stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck\nremembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the\nplace from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing\nnoses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned\nabout and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an\nhour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat down,\npointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and as Buck\nheld steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was\nlost in the distance.\n\nJohn Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang\nupon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon him,\nlicking his face, biting his hand--\"playing the general tom-fool,\" as\nJohn Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and forth\nand cursed him lovingly.\n\nFor two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of\nhis sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,\nsaw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But\nafter two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously\nthan ever. Buck's restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by\nrecollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the\ndivide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once\nagain he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no\nmore; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was\nnever raised.\n\nHe began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a\ntime; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went\ndown into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,\nseeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as\nhe travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never to\ntire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into\nthe sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by\nthe mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest\nhelpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the\nlast latent remnants of Buck's ferocity. And two days later, when he\nreturned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the\nspoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind\nwho would quarrel no more.\n\nThe blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a\nthing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone,\nby virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a\nhostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this\nhe became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated\nitself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself\nin all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke\nplainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious\nfurry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his\nmuzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran\nmidmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic\nwolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father\nhe had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who\nhad given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf\nmuzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head,\nsomewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.\n\nHis cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,\nshepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus\nan experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable\na creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous\nanimal living on a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the\nhigh tide of his life, overspilling with vigor and virility. When\nThornton passed a caressing hand along his back, a snapping and\ncrackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism\nat the contact. Every part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was\nkeyed to the most exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a\nperfect equilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which\nrequired action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as\na husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could leap\ntwice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and responded\nin less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or\nhearing. He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant.\nIn point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and\nresponding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals\nof time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His muscles were\nsurcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel\nsprings. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant,\nuntil it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and\npour forth generously over the world.\n\n\"Never was there such a dog,\" said John Thornton one day, as the\npartners watched Buck marching out of camp.\n\n\"When he was made, the mould was broke,\" said Pete.\n\n\"Py jingo! I t'ink so mineself,\" Hans affirmed.\n\nThey saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and\nterrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the\nsecrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing\nof the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow\nthat appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take\nadvantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like a\nsnake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill\na rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing\na second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not too quick\nfor him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He killed\nto eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed\nhimself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his\ndelight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to\nlet them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.\n\nAs the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater\nabundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less\nrigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf;\nbut he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and he\ncame upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band of\ntwenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,\nand chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,\nstanding over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist\nas even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great\npalmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet\nwithin the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,\nwhile he roared with fury at sight of Buck.\n\nFrom the bull's side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered\narrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct\nwhich came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck\nproceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He\nwould bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach\nof the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have\nstamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on\nthe fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of\nrage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring\nhim on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus\nseparated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would\ncharge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.\n\nThere is a patience of the wild--dogged, tireless, persistent as life\nitself--that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,\nthe snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience\nbelongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it\nbelonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding\nits march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their\nhalf-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.\nFor half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from\nall sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his\nvictim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of\ncreatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures\npreying.\n\nAs the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest\n(the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),\nthe young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the\naid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them\non to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this\ntireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of\nthe herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only\none member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,\nand in the end they were content to pay the toll.\n\nAs twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his\nmates--the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he\nhad mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading\nlight. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless\nfanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than\nhalf a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight\nand struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature\nwhose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.\n\nFrom then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a\nmoment's rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or\nthe shoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull\nopportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams\nthey crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long stretches of\nflight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily\nat his heels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down\nwhen the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat\nor drink.\n\nThe great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and\nthe shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long\nperiods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and\nBuck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to\nrest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes\nfixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming\nover the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the\nmoose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.\nForest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The news\nof it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but by\nsome other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew\nthat the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were\nafoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he had finished\nthe business in hand.\n\nAt last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.\nFor a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn\nand turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his face\ntoward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope, and\nwent on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading\nstraight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that\nput man and his magnetic needle to shame.\n\nAs he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the\nland. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been\nthere throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon him\nin some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the squirrels\nchattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several times he\nstopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a\nmessage which made him leap on with greater speed. He was oppressed with\na sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened;\nand as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley\ntoward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.\n\nThree miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair\nrippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.\nBuck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and\ntense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story--all but\nthe end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the\nlife on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant\nsilence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in\nhiding. One only he saw,--a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray\ndead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the\nwood itself.\n\nAs Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose\nwas jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped\nand pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.\nHe was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow\nprotruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.\n\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton\nhad bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle,\ndirectly on the trail, and Buck passed around him without stopping. From\nthe camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a\nsing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he found\nHans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine. At the\nsame instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and\nsaw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders.\nA gust of overpowering rage swept over him. He did not know that he\ngrowled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. For the last\ntime in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it\nwas because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head.\n\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge\nwhen they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal\nthe like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live\nhurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He\nsprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping\nthe throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.\nHe did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with\nthe next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was\nno withstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,\nrending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the\narrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his\nmovements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they\nshot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear\nat Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with\nsuch force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood\nout beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to\nthe woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.\n\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and\ndragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was\na fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the\ncountry, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors\ngathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. As for\nBuck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp. He\nfound Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment\nof surprise. Thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the\nearth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep\npool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet, faithful\nto the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice\nboxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained John\nThornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water, from which no\ntrace led away.\n\nAll day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.\nDeath, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the\nlives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It\nleft a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which\nached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he paused\nto contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain of it;\nand at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,--a pride\ngreater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the noblest\ngame of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.\nHe sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It was harder\nto kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all, were it\nnot for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he would be\nunafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows,\nspears, and clubs.\n\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,\nlighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming\nof the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a\nstirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats\nhad made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far away drifted a\nfaint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the\nmoments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew them\nas things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. He\nwalked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call,\nthe many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever\nbefore. And as never before, he was ready to obey. John Thornton was\ndead. The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound\nhim.\n\nHunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks\nof the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the\nland of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley. Into the clearing\nwhere the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the\ncentre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their\ncoming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and a moment's\npause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him. Like a flash\nBuck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without movement, as\nbefore, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him. Three others\ntried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back,\nstreaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.\n\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded\ntogether, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the\nprey. Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.\nPivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere\nat once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did\nhe whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from getting\nbehind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek\nbed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked along to a\nright angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining,\nand in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with\nnothing to do but face the front.\n\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves\ndrew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the\nwhite fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying down\nwith heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet,\nwatching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool. One\nwolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner,\nand Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night\nand a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they touched\nnoses.\n\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed\nhis lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,\nWhereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke\nout the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the call\ncame to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and howled. This\nover, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him, sniffing\nin half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted the yelp of the\npack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung in behind, yelping\nin chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother,\nyelping as he ran.\n\n   *  *  *  *  *\n\nAnd here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when\nthe Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were\nseen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white\ncentring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the Yeehats tell\nof a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are afraid of\nthis Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from\ntheir camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs,\nand defying their bravest hunters.\n\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to\nthe camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with\nthroats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow\ngreater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow\nthe movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never\nenter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over\nthe fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an\nabiding-place.\n\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which\nthe Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,\nand yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling\ntimber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here\na yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into\nthe ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould\noverrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for\na time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.\n\nBut he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the\nwolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running\nat the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering\nborealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow\nas he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Call of the Wild, by Jack London\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CALL OF THE WILD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 215.txt or 215.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/215/\n\nProduced by Ryan, Kirstin, Linda and Rick Trapp in Loving\nMemory of Ivan Louis Reese\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
