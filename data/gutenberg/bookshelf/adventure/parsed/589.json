Yet, when I remember the days of our explorations, I am\n\nnot without hope.  There should be left in our native city some\n\nseed of the elect; some long-legged, hot-headed youth must repeat\n\nto-day our dreams and wanderings of so many years ago; he will\n\nrelish the pleasure, which should have been ours, to follow among\n\nnamed streets and numbered houses the country walks of David\n\nBalfour, to identify Dean, and Silvermills, and Broughton, and Hope\n\nPark, and Pilrig, and poor old Lochend--if it still be standing,\n\nand the Figgate Whins--if there be any of them left; or to push (on\n\na long holiday) so far afield as Gillane or the Bass.  So, perhaps,\n\nhis eye shall be opened to behold the series of the generations,\n\nand he shall weigh with surprise his momentous and nugatory gift of\n\nlife.\n\n\n\nYou are still--as when first I saw, as when I last addressed you--\n\nin the venerable city which I must always think of as my home.  And\n\nI have come so far; and the sights and thoughts of my youth pursue\n\nme; and I see like a vision the youth of my father, and of his\n\nfather, and the whole stream of lives flowing down there far in the\n\nnorth, with the sound of laughter and tears, to cast me out in the\n\nend, as by a sudden freshet, on these ultimate islands.  And I\n\nadmire and bow my head before the romance of destiny.\n\n\n\nR. L. S.\n\nVailima, Upolu,\n\nSamoa, 1892.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCATRIONA--Part I--THE LORD ADVOCATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--A BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon, I, David\n\nBalfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter\n\nattending me with a bag of money, and some of the chief of these\n\nmerchants bowing me from their doors.  Two days before, and even so\n\nlate as yestermorning, I was like a beggar-man by the wayside, clad\n\nin rags, brought down to my last shillings, my companion a\n\ncondemned traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with the\n\nnews of which the country rang.  To-day I was served heir to my\n\nposition in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me carrying my\n\ngold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the\n\nsaying) the ball directly at my foot.\n\n\n\nThere were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much\n\nsail.  The first was the very difficult and deadly business I had\n\nstill to handle; the second, the place that I was in.  The tall,\n\nblack city, and the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk,\n\nmade a new world for me, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands\n\nand the still country-sides that I had frequented up to then.  The\n\nthrong of the citizens in particular abashed me.  Rankeillor's son\n\nwas short and small in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me;\n\nand it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of a\n\nbank-porter.  It was plain, if I did so, I should but set folk\n\nlaughing, and (what was worse in my case) set them asking\n\nquestions.  So that I behooved to come by some clothes of my own,\n\nand in the meanwhile to walk by the porter's side, and put my hand\n\non his arm as though we were a pair of friends.\n\n\n\nAt a merchant's in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out:  none\n\ntoo fine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback;\n\nbut comely and responsible, so that servants should respect me.\n\nThence to an armourer's, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my\n\ndegree in life.  I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one so\n\nignorant of defence) it might be called an added danger.  The\n\nporter, who was naturally a man of some experience, judged my\n\naccoutrement to be well chosen.\n\n\n\n\"Naething kenspeckle,\" {1} said he; \"plain, dacent claes.  As for\n\nthe rapier, nae doubt it sits wi' your degree; but an I had been\n\nyou, I would has waired my siller better-gates than that.\"  And he\n\nproposed I should buy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back,\n\nthat was a cousin of his own, and made them \"extraordinar\n\nendurable.\"\n\n\n\nBut I had other matters on my hand more pressing.  Here I was in\n\nthis old, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-\n\nwarren, not only by the number of its indwellers, but the\n\ncomplication of its passages and holes.  It was, indeed, a place\n\nwhere no stranger had a chance to find a friend, let be another\n\nstranger.  Suppose him even to hit on the right close, people dwelt\n\nso thronged in these tall houses, he might very well seek a day\n\nbefore he chanced on the right door.  The ordinary course was to\n\nhire a lad they called a caddie, who was like a guide or pilot, led\n\nyou where you had occasion, and (your errands being done) brought\n\nyou again where you were lodging.  But these caddies, being always\n\nemployed in the same sort of services, and having it for obligation\n\nto be well informed of every house and person in the city, had\n\ngrown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales of Mr.\n\nCampbell's how they communicated one with another, what a rage of\n\ncuriosity they conceived as to their employer's business, and how\n\nthey were like eyes and fingers to the police.  It would be a piece\n\nof little wisdom, the way I was now placed, to take such a ferret\n\nto my tails.  I had three visits to make, all immediately needful:\n\nto my kinsman Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer that was\n\nAppin's agent, and to William Grant Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord\n\nAdvocate of Scotland.  Mr. Balfour's was a non-committal visit; and\n\nbesides (Pilrig being in the country) I made bold to find the way\n\nto it myself, with the help of my two legs and a Scots tongue.  But\n\nthe rest were in a different case.  Not only was the visit to\n\nAppin's agent, in the midst of the cry about the Appin murder,\n\ndangerous in itself, but it was highly inconsistent with the other.\n\nI was like to have a bad enough time of it with my Lord Advocate\n\nGrant, the best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot from Appin's\n\nagent, was little likely to mend my own affairs, and might prove\n\nthe mere ruin of friend Alan's.  The whole thing, besides, gave me\n\na look of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds that\n\nwas little to my fancy.  I determined, therefore, to be done at\n\nonce with Mr. Stewart and the whole Jacobitical side of my\n\nbusiness, and to profit for that purpose by the guidance of the\n\nporter at my side.  But it chanced I had scarce given him the\n\naddress, when there came a sprinkle of rain--nothing to hurt, only\n\nfor my new clothes--and we took shelter under a pend at the head of\n\na close or alley.\n\n\n\nBeing strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in.  The\n\nnarrow paved way descended swiftly.  Prodigious tall houses sprang\n\nupon each side and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they\n\nrose.  At the top only a ribbon of sky showed in.  By what I could\n\nspy in the windows, and by the respectable persons that passed out\n\nand in, I saw the houses to be very well occupied; and the whole\n\nappearance of the place interested me like a tale.\n\n\n\nI was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in\n\ntime and clash of steel behind me.  Turning quickly, I was aware of\n\na party of armed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man in a\n\ngreat coat.  He walked with a stoop that was like a piece of\n\ncourtesy, genteel and insinuating:  he waved his hands plausibly as\n\nhe went, and his face was sly and handsome.  I thought his eye took\n\nme in, but could not meet it.  This procession went by to a door in\n\nthe close, which a serving-man in a fine livery set open; and two\n\nof the soldier-lads carried the prisoner within, the rest lingering\n\nwith their firelocks by the door.\n\n\n\nThere can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some\n\nfollowing of idle folk and children.  It was so now; but the more\n\npart melted away incontinent until but three were left.  One was a\n\ngirl; she was dressed like a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond\n\ncolours on her head; but her comrades or (I should say) followers\n\nwere ragged gillies, such as I had seen the matches of by the dozen\n\nin my Highland journey.  They all spoke together earnestly in\n\nGaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of\n\nAlan; and, though the rain was by again, and my porter plucked at\n\nme to be going, I even drew nearer where they were, to listen.  The\n\nlady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and cringeing\n\nbefore her, so that I made sure she was come of a chief's house.\n\nAll the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by\n\nwhat I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among\n\nthe party; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk\n\nalike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans.\n\n\n\nIt chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her face\n\nfor the first time.  There is no greater wonder than the way the\n\nface of a young woman fits in a man's mind, and stays there, and he\n\ncould never tell you why; it just seems it was the thing he wanted.\n\nShe had wonderful bright eyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes\n\nhad a part in it; but what I remember the most clearly was the way\n\nher lips were a trifle open as she turned.  And, whatever was the\n\ncause, I stood there staring like a fool.  On her side, as she had\n\nnot known there was anyone so near, she looked at me a little\n\nlonger, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely civil.\n\n\n\nIt went through my country head she might be wondering at my new\n\nclothes; with that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight of my\n\ncolouring it is to be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for\n\nshe moved her gillies farther down the close, and they fell again\n\nto this dispute, where I could hear no more of it.\n\n\n\nI had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and\n\nstrong; and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come\n\nforward, for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind.  You\n\nwould have thought I had now all the more reason to pursue my\n\ncommon practice, since I had met this young lady in the city\n\nstreet, seemingly following a prisoner, and accompanied with two\n\nvery ragged indecent-like Highlandmen.  But there was here a\n\ndifferent ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been\n\nprying in her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, and at\n\nthe top of my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow.\n\nThe beggar on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low,\n\nor, at least of it, not by this young lady.\n\n\n\nI followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best\n\nthat I was able.\n\n\n\n\"Madam,\" said I, \"I think it only fair to myself to let you\n\nunderstand I have no Gaelic.  It is true I was listening, for I\n\nhave friends of my own across the Highland line, and the sound of\n\nthat tongue comes friendly; but for your private affairs, if you\n\nhad spoken Greek, I might have had more guess at them.\"\n\n\n\nShe made me a little, distant curtsey.  \"There is no harm done,\"\n\nsaid she, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more\n\nagreeable).  \"A cat may look at a king.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do not mean to offend,\" said I.  \"I have no skill of city\n\nmanners; I never before this day set foot inside the doors of\n\nEdinburgh.  Take me for a country lad--it's what I am; and I would\n\nrather I told you than you found it out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be\n\nspeaking to each other on the causeway,\" she replied.  \"But if you\n\nare landward {2} bred it will be different.  I am as landward as\n\nyourself; I am Highland, as you see, and think myself the farther\n\nfrom my home.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is not yet a week since I passed the line,\" said I.  \"Less than\n\na week ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder.\"\n\n\n\n\"Balwhither?\" she cries.  \"Come ye from Balwhither!  The name of it\n\nmakes all there is of me rejoice.  You will not have been long\n\nthere, and not known some of our friends or family?\"\n\n\n\n\"I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,\"\n\nI replied.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!\" she said;\n\n\"and if he is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" said I, \"they are fine people, and the place is a bonny\n\nplace.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where in the great world is such another!\" she cries; \"I am loving\n\nthe smell of that place and the roots that grow there.\"\n\n\n\nI was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid.  \"I could be\n\nwishing I had brought you a spray of that heather,\" says I.  \"And,\n\nthough I did ill to speak with you at the first, now it seems we\n\nhave common acquaintance, I make it my petition you will not forget\n\nme.  David Balfour is the name I am known by.  This is my lucky\n\nday, when I have just come into a landed estate, and am not very\n\nlong out of a deadly peril.  I wish you would keep my name in mind\n\nfor the sake of Balwhidder,\" said I, \"and I will yours for the sake\n\nof my lucky day.\"\n\n\n\n\"My name is not spoken,\" she replied, with a great deal of\n\nhaughtiness.  \"More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men's\n\ntongues, save for a blink.  I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace.\n\n{3}  Catriona Drummond is the one I use.\"\n\n\n\nNow indeed I knew where I was standing.  In all broad Scotland\n\nthere was but the one name proscribed, and that was the name of the\n\nMacgregors.  Yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy,\n\nI plunged the deeper in.\n\n\n\n\"I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with\n\nyourself,\" said I, \"and I think he will be one of your friends.\n\nThey called him Robin Oig.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did ye so?\" cries she.  \"Ye met Rob?\"\n\n\n\n\"I passed the night with him,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"He is a fowl of the night,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"There was a set of pipes there,\" I went on, \"so you may judge if\n\nthe time passed.\"\n\n\n\n\"You should be no enemy, at all events,\" said she.  \"That was his\n\nbrother there a moment since, with the red soldiers round him.  It\n\nis him that I call father.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is it so?\" cried I.  \"Are you a daughter of James More's?\"\n\n\n\n\"All the daughter that he has,\" says she:  \"the daughter of a\n\nprisoner; that I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk\n\nwith strangers!\"\n\n\n\nHere one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English, to\n\nknow what \"she\" (meaning by that himself) was to do about \"ta\n\nsneeshin.\"  I took some note of him for a short, bandy-legged, red-\n\nhaired, big-headed man, that I was to know more of to my cost.\n\n\n\n\"There can be none the day, Neil,\" she replied.  \"How will you get\n\n'sneeshin,' wanting siller!  It will teach you another time to be\n\nmore careful; and I think James More will not be very well pleased\n\nwith Neil of the Tom.\"\n\n\n\n\"Miss Drummond,\" I said, \"I told you I was in my lucky day.  Here I\n\nam, and a bank-porter at my tail.  And remember I have had the\n\nhospitality of your own country of Balwhidder.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was not one of my people gave it,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said I, \"but I am owing your uncle at least for some\n\nsprings upon the pipes.  Besides which, I have offered myself to be\n\nyour friend, and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse\n\nme in the proper time.\"\n\n\n\n\"If it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,\" said\n\nshe; \"but I will tell you what this is.  James More lies shackled\n\nin prison; but this time past they will be bringing him down here\n\ndaily to the Advocate's. . . .\"\n\n\n\n\"The Advocate's!\" I cried.  \"Is that . . . ?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,\" said\n\nshe.  \"There they bring my father one time and another, for what\n\npurpose I have no thought in my mind; but it seems there is some\n\nhope dawned for him.  All this same time they will not let me be\n\nseeing him, nor yet him write; and we wait upon the King's street\n\nto catch him; and now we give him his snuff as he goes by, and now\n\nsomething else.  And here is this son of trouble, Neil, son of\n\nDuncan, has lost my four-penny piece that was to buy that snuff,\n\nand James More must go wanting, and will think his daughter has\n\nforgotten him.\"\n\n\n\nI took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him go\n\nabout his errand.  Then to her, \"That sixpence came with me by\n\nBalwhidder,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, \"you are a friend to the Gregara!\"\n\n\n\n\"I would not like to deceive you, either,\" said I.  \"I know very\n\nlittle of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but\n\nsince the while I have been standing in this close, I seem to know\n\nsomething of yourself; and if you will just say 'a friend to Miss\n\nCatriona' I will see you are the less cheated.\"\n\n\n\n\"The one cannot be without the other,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"I will even try,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And what will you be thinking of myself!\" she cried, \"to be\n\nholding my hand to the first stranger!\"\n\n\n\n\"I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I must not be without repaying it,\" she said; \"where is it you\n\nstop!\"\n\n\n\n\"To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,\" said I, \"being not\n\nfull three hours in the city; but if you will give me your\n\ndirection, I will he no bold as come seeking my sixpence for\n\nmyself.\"\n\n\n\n\"Will I can trust you for that?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"You need have little fear,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"James More could not bear it else,\" said she.  \"I stop beyond the\n\nvillage of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs.\n\nDrummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be\n\nglad to thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,\"\n\nsaid I; and, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind,\n\nI made haste to say farewell.\n\n\n\nI could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made\n\nextraordinary free upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise\n\nyoung lady would have shown herself more backward.  I think it was\n\nthe bank-porter that put me from this ungallant train of thought.\n\n\n\n\"I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o' sense,\" he began,\n\nshooting out his lips.  \"Ye're no likely to gang far this gate.  A\n\nfule and his siller's shune parted.  Eh, but ye're a green\n\ncallant!\" he cried, \"an' a veecious, tae!  Cleikin' up wi'\n\nbaubeejoes!\"\n\n\n\n\"If you dare to speak of the young lady. . . \" I began.\n\n\n\n\"Leddy!\" he cried.  \"Haud us and safe us, whatten leddy?  Ca' THON\n\na leddy?  The toun's fu' o' them.  Leddies!  Man, its weel seen\n\nye're no very acquant in Embro!\"\n\n\n\nA clap of anger took me.\n\n\n\n\"Here,\" said I, \"lead me where I told you, and keep your foul mouth\n\nshut!\"\n\n\n\nHe did not wholly obey me, for, though he no more addressed me\n\ndirectly, he very impudent sang at me as he went in a manner of\n\ninnuendo, and with an exceedingly ill voice and ear -\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Mally Lee cam doun the street, her capuchin did flee,\n\nShe cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee.\n\nAnd we're a' gaun east and wast, we're a' gann ajee,\n\nWe're a' gaun east and wast courtin' Mally Lee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE HIGHLAND WRITER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Charles Stewart the Writer dwelt at the top of the longest\n\nstair ever mason set a hand to; fifteen flights of it, no less; and\n\nwhen I had come to his door, and a clerk had opened it, and told me\n\nhis master was within, I had scarce breath enough to send my porter\n\npacking.\n\n\n\n\"Awa' east and west wi' ye!\" said I, took the money bag out of his\n\nhands, and followed the clerk in.\n\n\n\nThe outer room was an office with the clerk's chair at a table\n\nspread with law papers.  In the inner chamber, which opened from\n\nit, a little brisk man sat poring on a deed, from which he scarce\n\nraised his eyes on my entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in\n\nthe place, as though prepared to show me out and fall again to his\n\nstudies.  This pleased me little enough; and what pleased me less,\n\nI thought the clerk was in a good posture to overhear what should\n\npass between us.\n\n\n\nI asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer.\n\n\n\n\"The same,\" says he; \"and, if the question is equally fair, who may\n\nyou be yourself?\"\n\n\n\n\"You never heard tell of my name nor of me either,\" said I, \"but I\n\nbring you a token from a friend that you know well.  That you know\n\nwell,\" I repeated, lowering my voice, \"but maybe are not just so\n\nkeen to hear from at this present being.  And the bits of business\n\nthat I have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being\n\nconfidential.  In short, I would like to think we were quite\n\nprivate.\"\n\n\n\nHe rose without more words, casting down his paper like a man ill-\n\npleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand, and shut to the house-\n\ndoor behind him.\n\n\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said he, returning, \"speak out your mind and fear\n\nnothing; though before you begin,\" he cries out, \"I tell you mine\n\nmisgives me!  I tell you beforehand, ye're either a Stewart or a\n\nStewart sent ye.  A good name it is, and one it would ill-become my\n\nfather's son to lightly.  But I begin to grue at the sound of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"My name is called Balfour,\" said I, \"David Balfour of Shaws.  As\n\nfor him that sent me, I will let his token speak.\"  And I showed\n\nthe silver button.\n\n\n\n\"Put it in your pocket, sir!\" cries he.  \"Ye need name no names.\n\nThe deevil's buckie, I ken the button of him!  And de'il hae't!\n\nWhere is he now!\"\n\n\n\nI told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had some sure place\n\n(or thought he had) about the north side, where he was to lie until\n\na ship was found for him; and how and where he had appointed to be\n\nspoken with.\n\n\n\n\"It's been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this\n\nfamily of mine,\" he cried, \"and, dod!  I believe the day's come\n\nnow!  Get a ship for him, quot' he!  And who's to pay for it?  The\n\nman's daft!\"\n\n\n\n\"That is my part of the affair, Mr. Stewart,\" said I.  \"Here is a\n\nbag of good money, and if more be wanted, more is to be had where\n\nit came from.\"\n\n\n\n\"I needn't ask your politics,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Ye need not,\" said I, smiling, \"for I'm as big a Whig as grows.\"\n\n\n\n\"Stop a bit, stop a bit,\" says Mr. Stewart.  \"What's all this?  A\n\nWhig?  Then why are you here with Alan's button? and what kind of a\n\nblack-foot traffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig?  Here\n\nis a forfeited rebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred\n\npounds on his life, and ye ask me to meddle in his business, and\n\nthen tell me ye're a Whig!  I have no mind of any such Whigs\n\nbefore, though I've kent plenty of them.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's a forfeited rebel, the more's the pity,\" said I, \"for the\n\nman's my friend.  I can only wish he had been better guided.  And\n\nan accused murderer, that he is too, for his misfortune; but\n\nwrongfully accused.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hear you say so,\" said Stewart.\n\n\n\n\"More than you are to hear me say so, before long,\" said I.  \"Alan\n\nBreck is innocent, and so is James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" says he, \"the two cases hang together.  If Alan is out, James\n\ncan never be in.\"\n\n\n\nHereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan, of the\n\naccident that brought me present at the Appin murder, and the\n\nvarious passages of our escape among the heather, and my recovery\n\nof my estate.  \"So, sir, you have now the whole train of these\n\nevents,\" I went on, \"and can see for yourself how I come to be so\n\nmuch mingled up with the affairs of your family and friends, which\n\n(for all of our sakes) I wish had been plainer and less bloody.\n\nYou can see for yourself, too, that I have certain pieces of\n\nbusiness depending, which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer\n\nchosen at random.  No more remains, but to ask if you will\n\nundertake my service?\"\n\n\n\n\"I have no great mind to it; but coming as you do with Alan's\n\nbutton, the choice is scarcely left me,\" said he.  \"What are your\n\ninstructions?\" he added, and took up his pen.\n\n\n\n\"The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country,\" said I,\n\n\"but I need not be repeating that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am little likely to forget it,\" said Stewart.\n\n\n\n\"The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,\" I went on.\n\n\"It would be ill for me to find a conveyance, but that should be no\n\nstick to you.  It was two pounds five shillings and three-halfpence\n\nfarthing sterling.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted it.\n\n\n\n\"Then,\" said I, \"there's a Mr. Henderland, a licensed preacher and\n\nmissionary in Ardgour, that I would like well to get some snuff\n\ninto the hands of; and, as I daresay you keep touch with your\n\nfriends in Appin (so near by), it's a job you could doubtless\n\novertake with the other.\"\n\n\n\n\"How much snuff are we to say?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"I was thinking of two pounds,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Two,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Then there's the lass Alison Hastie, in Lime Kilns,\" said I.  \"Her\n\nthat helped Alan and me across the Forth.  I was thinking if I\n\ncould get her a good Sunday gown, such as she could wear with\n\ndecency in her degree, it would be an ease to my conscience; for\n\nthe mere truth is, we owe her our two lives.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am glad so see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,\" says he, making\n\nhis notes.\n\n\n\n\"I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune,\"\n\nsaid I.  \"And now, if you will compute the outlay and your own\n\nproper charges, I would be glad to know if I could get some\n\nspending-money back.  It's not that I grudge the whole of it to get\n\nAlan safe; it's not that I lack more; but having drawn so much the\n\none day, I think it would have a very ill appearance if I was back\n\nagain seeking, the next.  Only be sure you have enough,\" I added,\n\n\"for I am very undesirous to meet with you again.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I'm pleased to see you're cautious, too,\" said the\n\nWriter.  \"But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum\n\nat my discretion.\"\n\n\n\nHe said this with a plain sneer.\n\n\n\n\"I'll have to run the hazard,\" I replied.  \"O, and there's another\n\nservice I would ask, and that's to direct me to a lodging, for I\n\nhave no roof to my head.  But it must be a lodging I may seem to\n\nhave hit upon by accident, for it would never do if the Lord\n\nAdvocate were to get any jealousy of our acquaintance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye may set your weary spirit at rest,\" said he.  \"I will never\n\nname your name, sir; and it's my belief the Advocate is still so\n\nmuch to be sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence.\"\n\n\n\nI saw I had got to the wrong side of the man.\n\n\n\n\"There's a braw day coming for him, then,\" said I, \"for he'll have\n\nto learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to-\n\nmorrow, when I call on him.\"\n\n\n\n\"When ye CALL on him!\" repeated Mr. Stewart.  \"Am I daft, or are\n\nyou!  What takes ye near the Advocate!\"\n\n\n\n\"O, just to give myself up,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Balfour,\" he cried, \"are ye making a mock of me?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, sir,\" said I, \"though I think you have allowed yourself some\n\nsuch freedom with myself.  But I give you to understand once and\n\nfor all that I am in no jesting spirit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nor yet me,\" says Stewart.  \"And I give yon to understand (if\n\nthat's to be the word) that I like the looks of your behaviour less\n\nand less.  You come here to me with all sorts of propositions,\n\nwhich will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me\n\namong very undesirable persons this many a day to come.  And then\n\nyou tell me you're going straight out of my office to make your\n\npeace with the Advocate!  Alan's button here or Alan's button\n\nthere, the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further in.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would take it with a little more temper,\" said I, \"and perhaps\n\nwe can avoid what you object to.  I can see no way for it but to\n\ngive myself up, but perhaps you can see another; and if you could,\n\nI could never deny but what I would be rather relieved.  For I\n\nthink my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with\n\nmy health.  There's just the one thing clear, that I have to give\n\nmy evidence; for I hope it'll save Alan's character (what's left of\n\nit), and James's neck, which is the more immediate.\"\n\n\n\nHe was silent for a breathing-space, and then, \"My man,\" said he,\n\n\"you'll never be allowed to give such evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll have to see about that,\" said I; \"I'm stiff-necked when I\n\nlike.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye muckle ass!\" cried Stewart, \"it's James they want; James has\n\ngot to hang--Alan, too, if they could catch him--but James\n\nwhatever!  Go near the Advocate with any such business, and you'll\n\nsee! he'll find a way to muzzle, ye.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think better of the Advocate than that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"The Advocate be dammed!\" cries he.  \"It's the Campbells, man!\n\nYou'll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back; and so will\n\nthe Advocate too, poor body!  It's extraordinar ye cannot see where\n\nye stand!  If there's no fair way to stop your gab, there's a foul\n\none gaping.  They can put ye in the dock, do ye no see that?\" he\n\ncried, and stabbed me with one finger in the leg.\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" said I, \"I was told that same no further back than this\n\nmorning by another lawyer.\"\n\n\n\n\"And who was he?\" asked Stewart, \"He spoke sense at least.\"\n\n\n\nI told I must be excused from naming him, for he was a decent stout\n\nold Whig, and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs.\n\n\n\n\"I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!\" cries Stewart.\n\n\"But what said you?\"\n\n\n\n\"I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before\n\nthe house of Shaws.\n\n\n\n\"Well, and so ye will hang!\" said he.  \"Ye'll hang beside James\n\nStewart.  There's your fortune told.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope better of it yet than that,\" said I; \"but I could never\n\ndeny there was a risk.\"\n\n\n\n\"Risk!\" says he, and then sat silent again.  \"I ought to thank you\n\nfor you staunchness to my friends, to whom you show a very good\n\nspirit,\" he says, \"if you have the strength to stand by it.  But I\n\nwarn you that you're wading deep.  I wouldn't put myself in your\n\nplace (me that's a Stewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever\n\nthere were since Noah.  Risk? ay, I take over-many; but to be tried\n\nin court before a Campbell jury and a Campbell judge, and that in a\n\nCampbell country and upon a Campbell quarrel--think what you like\n\nof me, Balfour, it's beyond me.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a different way of thinking, I suppose,\" said I; \"I was\n\nbrought up to this one by my father before me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Glory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his name,\" says\n\nhe.  \"Yet I would not have you judge me over-sorely.  My case is\n\ndooms hard.  See, sir, ye tell me ye're a Whig:  I wonder what I\n\nam.  No Whig to be sure; I couldnae be just that.  But--laigh in\n\nyour ear, man--I'm maybe no very keen on the other side.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that a fact?\" cried I.  \"It's what I would think of a man of\n\nyour intelligence.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hut! none of your whillywhas!\" {4} cries he.  \"There's\n\nintelligence upon both sides.  But for my private part I have no\n\nparticular desire to harm King George; and as for King James, God\n\nbless him! he does very well for me across the water.  I'm a\n\nlawyer, ye see:  fond of my books and my bottle, a good plea, a\n\nwell-drawn deed, a crack in the Parliament House with other lawyer\n\nbodies, and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at e'en.\n\nWhere do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"it's a fact ye have little of the wild\n\nHighlandman.\"\n\n\n\n\"Little?\" quoth he.  \"Nothing, man!  And yet I'm Hieland born, and\n\nwhen the clan pipes, who but me has to dance!  The clan and the\n\nname, that goes by all.  It's just what you said yourself; my\n\nfather learned it to me, and a bonny trade I have of it.  Treason\n\nand traitors, and the smuggling of them out and in; and the French\n\nrecruiting, weary fall it! and the smuggling through of the\n\nrecruits; and their pleas--a sorrow of their pleas!  Here have I\n\nbeen moving one for young Ardsheil, my cousin; claimed the estate\n\nunder the marriage contract--a forfeited estate!  I told them it\n\nwas nonsense:  muckle they cared!  And there was I cocking behind a\n\nyadvocate that liked the business as little as myself, for it was\n\nfair ruin to the pair of us--a black mark, DISAFFECTED, branded on\n\nour hurdies, like folk's names upon their kye!  And what can I do?\n\nI'm a Stewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan and family.  Then\n\nno later by than yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads\n\ncarried to the Castle.  What for?  I ken fine:  Act of 1736:\n\nrecruiting for King Lewie.  And you'll see, he'll whistle me in to\n\nbe his lawyer, and there'll be another black mark on my chara'ter!\n\nI tell you fair:  if I but kent the heid of a Hebrew word from the\n\nhurdies of it, be dammed but I would fling the whole thing up and\n\nturn minister!\"\n\n\n\n\"It's rather a hard position,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Dooms hard!\" cries he.  \"And that's what makes me think so much of\n\nye--you that's no Stewart--to stick your head so deep in Stewart\n\nbusiness.  And for what, I do not know:  unless it was the sense of\n\nduty.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope it will be that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"it's a grand quality.  But here is my clerk back;\n\nand, by your leave, we'll pick a bit of dinner, all the three of\n\nus.  When that's done, I'll give you the direction of a very decent\n\nman, that'll be very fain to have you for a lodger.  And I'll fill\n\nyour pockets to ye, forbye, out of your ain bag.  For this\n\nbusiness'll not be near as dear as ye suppose--not even the ship\n\npart of it.\"\n\n\n\nI made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing.\n\n\n\n\"Hoot, ye neednae mind for Robbie,\" cries he.  \"A Stewart, too,\n\npuir deevil! and has smuggled out more French recruits and\n\ntrafficking Papists than what he has hairs upon his face.  Why,\n\nit's Robin that manages that branch of my affairs.  Who will we\n\nhave now, Rob, for across the water!\"\n\n\n\n\"There'll be Andie Scougal, in the Thristle,\" replied Rob.  \"I saw\n\nHoseason the other day, but it seems he's wanting the ship.  Then\n\nthere'll be Tam Stobo; but I'm none so sure of Tam.  I've seen him\n\ncolloguing with some gey queer acquaintances; and if was anybody\n\nimportant, I would give Tam the go-by.\"\n\n\n\n\"The head's worth two hundred pounds, Robin,\" said Stewart.\n\n\n\n\"Gosh, that'll no be Alan Breck!\" cried the clerk.\n\n\n\n\"Just Alan,\" said his master.\n\n\n\n\"Weary winds! that's sayrious,\" cried Robin.  \"I'll try Andie,\n\nthen; Andie'll be the best.\"\n\n\n\n\"It seems it's quite a big business,\" I observed.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Balfour, there's no end to it,\" said Stewart.\n\n\n\n\"There was a name your clerk mentioned,\" I went on:  \"Hoseason.\n\nThat must be my man, I think:  Hoseason, of the brig Covenant.\n\nWould you set your trust on him?\"\n\n\n\n\"He didnae behave very well to you and Alan,\" said Mr. Stewart;\n\n\"but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise.  If he had\n\ntaken Alan on board his ship on an agreement, it's my notion he\n\nwould have proved a just dealer.  How say ye, Rob?\"\n\n\n\n\"No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,\" said the clerk.  \"I\n\nwould lippen to {5} Eli's word--ay, if it was the Chevalier, or\n\nAppin himsel',\" he added.\n\n\n\n\"And it was him that brought the doctor, wasnae't?\" asked the\n\nmaster.\n\n\n\n\"He was the very man,\" said the clerk.\n\n\n\n\"And I think he took the doctor back?\" says Stewart.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, with his sporran full!\" cried Robin.  \"And Eli kent of that!\"\n\n{6}\n\n\n\n\"Well, it seems it's hard to ken folk rightly,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"That was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr. Balfour!\" says\n\nthe Writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--I GO TO PILRIG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I\n\nwas up and into my new clothes; and no sooner the breakfast\n\nswallowed, than I was forth on my adventurers.  Alan, I could hope,\n\nwas fended for; James was like to be a more difficult affair, and I\n\ncould not but think that enterprise might cost me dear, even as\n\neverybody said to whom I had opened my opinion.  It seemed I was\n\ncome to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down; that I\n\nhad clambered up, through so many and hard trials, to be rich, to\n\nbe recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword to my side, all to\n\ncommit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the worst kind of\n\nsuicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the King's charges.\n\n\n\nWhat was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down the high Street\n\nand out north by Leith Wynd.  First I said it was to save James\n\nStewart; and no doubt the memory of his distress, and his wife's\n\ncries, and a word or so I had let drop on that occasion worked upon\n\nme strongly.  At the same time I reflected that it was (or ought to\n\nbe) the most indifferent matter to my father's son, whether James\n\ndied in his bed or from a scaffold.  He was Alan's cousin, to be\n\nsure; but so far as regarded Alan, the best thing would be to lie\n\nlow, and let the King, and his Grace of Argyll, and the corbie\n\ncrows, pick the bones of his kinsman their own way.  Nor could I\n\nforget that, while we were all in the pot together, James had shown\n\nno such particular anxiety whether for Alan or me.\n\n\n\nNext it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice:  and I\n\nthought that a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we dwelt\n\nin polities, at some discomfort to each one of us) the main thing\n\nof all must still be justice, and the death of any innocent man a\n\nwound upon the whole community.  Next, again, it was the Accuser of\n\nthe Brethren that gave me a turn of his argument; bade me think\n\nshame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters, and\n\ntold me I was but a prating vain child, who had spoken big words to\n\nRankeillor and to Stewart, and held myself bound upon my vanity to\n\nmake good that boastfulness.  Nay, and he hit me with the other end\n\nof the stick; for he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice,\n\ngoing about at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater\n\nsafety.  No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself, I might\n\nany day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff's officer, and be\n\nrecognised, and dragged into the Appin murder by the heels; and, no\n\ndoubt, in case I could manage my declaration with success, I should\n\nbreathe more free for ever after.  But when I looked this argument\n\nfull in the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of.  As for the\n\nrest, \"Here are the two roads,\" I thought, \"and both go to the same\n\nplace.  It's unjust that James should hang if I can save him; and\n\nit would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do\n\nnothing.  It's lucky for James of the Glens that I have boasted\n\nbeforehand; and none so unlucky for myself, because now I'm\n\ncommitted to do right.  I have the name of a gentleman and the\n\nmeans of one; it would be a poor duty that I was wanting in the\n\nessence.\"  And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit, and said a\n\nprayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack, and that\n\nI might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle, and come\n\noff again scatheless, as so many do.\n\n\n\nThis train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion;\n\nthough it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that\n\nsurrounded me, nor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble\n\non the ladder of the gallows.  It was a plain, fair morning, but\n\nthe wind in the east.  The little chill of it sang in my blood, and\n\ngave me a feeling of the autumn, and the dead leaves, and dead\n\nfolks' bodies in their graves.  It seemed the devil was in it, if I\n\nwas to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other folks'\n\naffairs.  On the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not the\n\ncustomary time of year for that diversion, some children were\n\ncrying and running with their kites.  These toys appeared very\n\nplain against the sky; I remarked a great one soar on the wind to a\n\nhigh altitude and then plump among the whins; and I thought to\n\nmyself at sight of it, \"There goes Davie.\"\n\n\n\nMy way lay over Mouter's Hill, and through an end of a clachan on\n\nthe braeside among fields.  There was a whirr of looms in it went\n\nfrom house to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours\n\nthat I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found\n\nout later that this was Picardy, a village where the French weavers\n\nwrought for the Linen Company.  Here I got a fresh direction for\n\nPilrig, my destination; and a little beyond, on the wayside, came\n\nby a gibbet and two men hanged in chains.  They were dipped in tar,\n\nas the manner is; the wind span them, the chains clattered, and the\n\nbirds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried.  The sight\n\ncoming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my fears, I could\n\nscarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort.  And,\n\nas I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what should I strike\n\non, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it, and nodded,\n\nand talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies.\n\n\n\n\"Who are these two, mother?\" I asked, and pointed to the corpses.\n\n\n\n\"A blessing on your precious face!\" she cried.  \"Twa joes {7}\n\no'mine:  just two o' my old joes, my hinny dear.\"\n\n\n\n\"What did they suffer for?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Ou, just for the guid cause,\" said she.  \"Aften I spaed to them\n\nthe way that it would end.  Twa shillin' Scots:  no pickle mair;\n\nand there are twa bonny callants hingin' for 't!  They took it frae\n\na wean {8} belanged to Brouchton.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay!\" said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, \"and did they\n\ncome to such a figure for so poor a business?  This is to lose all\n\nindeed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Gie's your loof, {9} hinny,\" says she, \"and let me spae your weird\n\nto ye.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, mother,\" said I, \"I see far enough the way I am.  It's an unco\n\nthing to see too far in front.\"\n\n\n\n\"I read it in your bree,\" she said.  \"There's a bonnie lassie that\n\nhas bricht een, and there's a wee man in a braw coat, and a big man\n\nin a pouthered wig, and there's the shadow of the wuddy, {10} joe,\n\nthat lies braid across your path.  Gie's your loof, hinny, and let\n\nAuld Merren spae it to ye bonny.\"\n\n\n\nThe two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter\n\nof James More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch\n\ncreature, casting her a baubee, which she continued to sit and play\n\nwith under the moving shadows of the hanged.\n\n\n\nMy way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more\n\npleasant to me but for this encounter.  The old rampart ran among\n\nfields, the like of them I had never seen for artfulness of\n\nagriculture; I was pleased, besides, to be so far in the still\n\ncountryside; but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head;\n\nand the mope and mows of the old witch, and the thought of the dead\n\nmen, hag-rode my spirits.  To hang on a gallows, that seemed a hard\n\ncase; and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings Scots,\n\nor (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty, once he was\n\ntarred and shackled and hung up, the difference seemed small.\n\nThere might David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on their\n\nerrands and think light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a leg-\n\nfoot and spae their fortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and\n\nlook to the other aide, and hold a nose.  I saw them plain, and\n\nthey had grey eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the\n\nDrummed colours.\n\n\n\nI was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty resolved,\n\nwhen I came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by the\n\nwalkside among some brave young woods.  The laird's horse was\n\nstanding saddled at the door as I came up, but himself was in the\n\nstudy, where he received me in the midst of learned works and\n\nmusical instruments, for he was not only a deep philosopher but\n\nmuch of a musician.  He greeted me at first pretty well, and when\n\nhe had read Rankeillor's letter, placed himself obligingly at my\n\ndisposal.\n\n\n\n\"And what is it, cousin David!\" said he--\"since it appears that we\n\nare cousins--what is this that I can do for you!  A word to\n\nPrestongrange!  Doubtless that is easily given.  But what should be\n\nthe word?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Balfour,\" said I, \"if I were to tell you my whole story the\n\nway it fell out, it's my opinion (and it was Rankeillor's before\n\nme) that you would be very little made up with it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,\" said I; \"I have\n\nnothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but just the\n\ncommon infirmities of mankind.  'The guilt of Adam's first sin, the\n\nwant of original righteousness, and the corruption of my whole\n\nnature,' so much I must answer for, and I hope I have been taught\n\nwhere to look for help,\" I said; for I judged from the look of the\n\nman he would think the better of me if I knew my questions. {11}\n\n\"But in the way of worldly honour I have no great stumble to\n\nreproach myself with; and my difficulties have befallen me very\n\nmuch against my will and (by all that I can see) without my fault.\n\nMy trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication,\n\nwhich it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, very well, Mr. David,\" he replied, \"I am pleased to see you\n\nare all that Rankeillor represented.  And for what you say of\n\npolitical complications, you do me no more than justice.  It is my\n\nstudy to be beyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it.\n\nThe question is,\" says he, \"how, if I am to know nothing of the\n\nmatter, I can very well assist you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why sir,\" said I, \"I propose you should write to his lordship,\n\nthat I am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means:\n\nboth of which I believe to be the case.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have Rankeillor's word for it,\" said Mr. Balfour, \"and I count\n\nthat a warran-dice against all deadly.\"\n\n\n\n\"To which you might add (if you will take my word for so much) that\n\nI am a good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought up,\" I\n\nwent on.\n\n\n\n\"None of which will do you any harm,\" said Mr. Balfour.\n\n\n\n\"Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter\n\nof great moment, connected with His Majesty's service and the\n\nadministration of justice,\" I suggested.\n\n\n\n\"As I am not to hear the matter,\" says the laird, \"I will not take\n\nupon myself to qualify its weight.  'Great moment' therefore falls,\n\nand 'moment' along with it.  For the rest I might express myself\n\nmuch as you propose.\"\n\n\n\n\"And then, sir,\" said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb,\n\n\"then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that\n\nmight perhaps tell for my protection.\"\n\n\n\n\"Protection?\" says he, \"for your protection!  Here is a phrase that\n\nsomewhat dampens me.  If the matter be so dangerous, I own I would\n\nbe a little loath to move in it blindfold.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,\"\n\nsaid I.\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps that would be the best,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it's the Appin murder,\" said I.\n\n\n\nHe held up both his hands.  \"Sirs! sirs!\" cried he.\n\n\n\nI thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost\n\nmy helper.\n\n\n\n\"Let me explain. . .\" I began.\n\n\n\n\"I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,\" says he.  \"I\n\ndecline in toto to hear more of it.  For your name's sake and\n\nRankeillor's, and perhaps a little for your own, I will do what I\n\ncan to help you; but I will hear no more upon the facts.  And it is\n\nmy first clear duty to warn you.  These are deep waters, Mr. David,\n\nand you are a young man.  Be cautious and think twice.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that, Mr.\n\nBalfour,\" said I, \"and I will direct your attention again to\n\nRankeillor's letter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered\n\nhis approval of that which I design.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he; and then again, \"Well, well!  I will do what\n\nI can for you.\"  There with he took a pen and paper, sat a while in\n\nthought, and began to write with much consideration.  \"I understand\n\nthat Rankeillor approved of what you have in mind?\" he asked\n\npresently.\n\n\n\n\"After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God's\n\nname,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"That is the name to go in,\" said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his\n\nwriting.  Presently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and\n\naddressed me again.  \"Now here, Mr. David,\" said he, \"is a letter\n\nof introduction, which I will seal without closing, and give into\n\nyour hands open, as the form requires.  But, since I am acting in\n\nthe dark, I will just read it to you, so that you may see if it\n\nwill secure your end -\n\n\n\n\n\n\"PILRIG, August 26th, 1751.\n\n\n\n\"My Lord,--This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin,\n\nDavid Balfour Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished\n\ndescent and good estate.  He has enjoyed, besides, the more\n\nvaluable advantages of a godly training, and his political\n\nprinciples are all that your lordship can desire.  I am not in Mr.\n\nBalfour's confidence, but I understand him to have a matter to\n\ndeclare, touching His Majesty's service and the administration of\n\njustice; purposes for which your Lordship's zeal is known.  I\n\nshould add that the young gentleman's intention is known to and\n\napproved by some of his friends, who will watch with hopeful\n\nanxiety the event of his success or failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whereupon,\" continued Mr. Balfour, \"I have subscribed myself with\n\nthe usual compliments.  You observe I have said 'some of your\n\nfriends'; I hope you can justify my plural?\"\n\n\n\n\"Perfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved by more than\n\none,\" said I.  \"And your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank\n\nyou for, is all I could have hoped.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was all I could squeeze out,\" said he; \"and from what I know of\n\nthe matter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that it may\n\nprove sufficient.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--LORD ADVOCATE PRESTONGRANGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy kinsman kept me to a meal, \"for the honour of the roof,\" he\n\nsaid; and I believe I made the better speed on my return.  I had no\n\nthought but to be done with the next stage, and have myself fully\n\ncommitted; to a person circumstanced as I was, the appearance of\n\nclosing a door on hesitation and temptation was itself extremely\n\ntempting; and I was the more disappointed, when I came to\n\nPrestongrange's house, to be informed he was abroad.  I believe it\n\nwas true at the moment, and for some hours after; and then I have\n\nno doubt the Advocate came home again, and enjoyed himself in a\n\nneighbouring chamber among friends, while perhaps the very fact of\n\nmy arrival was forgotten.  I would have gone away a dozen times,\n\nonly for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out\n\nof hand and be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience.\n\nAt first I read, for the little cabinet where I was left contained\n\na variety of books.  But I fear I read with little profit; and the\n\nweather falling cloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than usual, and\n\nmy cabinet being lighted with but a loophole of a window, I was at\n\nlast obliged to desist from this diversion (such as it was), and\n\npass the rest of my time of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity.\n\nThe sound of people talking in a near chamber, the pleasant note of\n\na harpsichord, and once the voice of a lady singing, bore me a kind\n\nof company.\n\n\n\nI do not know the hour, but the darkness was long come, when the\n\ndoor of the cabinet opened, and I was aware, by the light behind\n\nhim, of a tall figure of a man upon the threshold.  I rose at once.\n\n\n\n\"Is anybody there?\" he asked.  \"Who in that?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord\n\nAdvocate,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Have you been here long?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"It is the first I hear of it,\" he replied, with a chuckle.  \"The\n\nlads must have forgotten you.  But you are in the bit at last, for\n\nI am Prestongrange.\"\n\n\n\nSo saying, he passed before me into the next room, whither (upon\n\nhis sign) I followed him, and where he lit a candle and took his\n\nplace before a business-table.  It was a long room, of a good\n\nproportion, wholly lined with books.  That small spark of light in\n\na corner struck out the man's handsome person and strong face.  He\n\nwas flushed, his eye watered and sparkled, and before he sat down I\n\nobserved him to sway back and forth.  No doubt, he had been supping\n\nliberally; but his mind and tongue were under full control.\n\n\n\n\"Well, sir, sit ye down,\" said he, \"and let us see Pilrig's\n\nletter.\"\n\n\n\nHe glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking up and\n\nbowing when he came to my name; but at the last words I thought I\n\nobserved his attention to redouble, and I made sure he read them\n\ntwice.  All this while you are to suppose my heart was beating, for\n\nI had now crossed my Rubicon and was come fairly on the field of\n\nbattle.\n\n\n\n\"I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,\" he said,\n\nwhen he had done.  \"Let me offer you a glass of claret.\"\n\n\n\n\"Under your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce be fair on\n\nme,\" said I.  \"I have come here, as the letter will have mentioned,\n\non a business of some gravity to myself; and, as I am little used\n\nwith wine, I might be the sooner affected.\"\n\n\n\n\"You shall be the judge,\" said he.  \"But if you will permit, I\n\nbelieve I will even have the bottle in myself.\"\n\n\n\nHe touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal, bringing\n\nwine and glasses.\n\n\n\n\"You are sure you will not join me?\" asked the Advocate.  \"Well,\n\nhere is to our better acquaintance!  In what way can I serve you?\"\n\n\n\n\"I should, perhaps, begin by telling you, my lord, that I am here\n\nat your own pressing invitation,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"You have the advantage of me somewhere,\" said he, \"for I profess I\n\nthink I never heard of you before this evening.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right, my lord; the name is, indeed, new to you,\" said I.  \"And\n\nyet you have been for some time extremely wishful to make my\n\nacquaintance, and have declared the same in public.\"\n\n\n\n\"I wish you would afford me a clue,\" says he.  \"I am no Daniel.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will perhaps serve for such,\" said I, \"that if I was in a\n\njesting humour--which is far from the case--I believe I might lay a\n\nclaim on your lordship for two hundred pounds.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what sense?\" he inquired.\n\n\n\n\"In the sense of rewards offered for my person,\" said I.\n\n\n\nHe thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat straight up in\n\nthe chair where he had been previously lolling.  \"What am I to\n\nunderstand?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"A TALL STRONG LAD OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN,\" I quoted, \"SPEAKS LIKE a\n\nLOWLANDER AND HAS NO BEARD.\"\n\n\n\n\"I recognise those words,\" said he, \"which, if you have come here\n\nwith any ill-judged intention of amusing yourself, are like to\n\nprove extremely prejudicial to your safety.\"\n\n\n\n\"My purpose in this,\" I replied, \"is just entirely as serious as\n\nlife and death, and you have understood me perfectly.  I am the boy\n\nwho was speaking with Glenure when he was shot.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim to be\n\ninnocent,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"The inference is clear,\" I said.  \"I am a very loyal subject to\n\nKing George, but if I had anything to reproach myself with, I would\n\nhave had more discretion than to walk into your den.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" said he.  \"This horrid crime, Mr. Balfour, is\n\nof a dye which cannot permit any clemency.  Blood has been\n\nbarbarously shed.  It has been shed in direct opposition to his\n\nMajesty and our whole frame of laws, by those who are their known\n\nand public oppugnants.  I take a very high sense of this.  I will\n\nnot deny that I consider the crime as directly personal to his\n\nMajesty.\"\n\n\n\n\"And unfortunately, my lord,\" I added, a little drily, \"directly\n\npersonal to another great personage who may be nameless.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you mean anything by those words, I must tell you I consider\n\nthem unfit for a good subject; and were they spoke publicly I\n\nshould make it my business to take note of them,\" said he.  \"You do\n\nnot appear to me to recognise the gravity of your situation, or you\n\nwould be more careful not to pejorate the same by words which\n\nglance upon the purity of justice.  Justice, in this country, and\n\nin my poor hands, is no respecter of persons.\"\n\n\n\n\"You give me too great a share in my own speech, my lord,\" said I.\n\n\"I did but repeat the common talk of the country, which I have\n\nheard everywhere, and from men of all opinions as I came along.\"\n\n\n\n\"When you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk\n\nin not to be listened to, how much less repeated,\" says the\n\nAdvocate.  \"But I acquit you of an ill intention.  That nobleman,\n\nwhom we all honour, and who has indeed been wounded in a near place\n\nby the late barbarity, sits too high to be reached by these\n\naspersions.  The Duke of Argyle--you see that I deal plainly with\n\nyou--takes it to heart as I do, and as we are both bound to do by\n\nour judicial functions and the service of his Majesty; and I could\n\nwish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally clean of family\n\nrancour.  But from the accident that this is a Campbell who has\n\nfallen martyr to his duty--as who else but the Campbells have ever\n\nput themselves foremost on that path?--I may say it, who am no\n\nCampbell--and that the chief of that great house happens (for all\n\nour advantages) to be the present head of the College of Justice,\n\nsmall minds and disaffected tongues are set agog in every\n\nchangehouse in the country; and I find a young gentleman like Mr.\n\nBalfour so ill-advised as to make himself their echo.\"  So much he\n\nspoke with a very oratorical delivery, as if in court, and then\n\ndeclined again upon the manner of a gentleman.  \"All this apart,\"\n\nsaid he.  \"It now remains that I should learn what I am to do with\n\nyou.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your\n\nlordship,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, true,\" says the Advocate.  \"But, you see, you come to me well\n\nrecommended.  There is a good honest Whig name to this letter,\"\n\nsays he, picking it up a moment from the table.  \"And--extra-\n\njudicially, Mr, Balfour--there is always the possibility of some\n\narrangement, I tell you, and I tell you beforehand that you may be\n\nthe more upon your guard, your fate lies with me singly.  In such a\n\nmatter (be it said with reverence) I am more powerful than the\n\nKing's Majesty; and should you please me--and of course satisfy my\n\nconscience--in what remains to be held of our interview, I tell you\n\nit may remain between ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\"Meaning how?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,\" said he, \"that if you give\n\nsatisfaction, no soul need know so much as that you visited my\n\nhouse; and you may observe that I do not even call my clerk.\"\n\n\n\nI saw what way he was driving.  \"I suppose it is needless anyone\n\nshould be informed upon my visit,\" said I, \"though the precise\n\nnature of my gains by that I cannot see.  I am not at all ashamed\n\nof coming here.\"\n\n\n\n\"And have no cause to be,\" says he, encouragingly.  \"Nor yet (if\n\nyou are careful) to fear the consequences.\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord,\" said I, \"speaking under your correction, I am not very\n\neasy to be frightened.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,\" says he.  \"But to\n\nthe interrogation; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond\n\nthe questions I shall ask you.  It may consist very immediately\n\nwith your safety.  I have a great discretion, it is true, but there\n\nare bounds to it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall try to follow your lordship's advice,\" said I.\n\n\n\nHe spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading.  \"It\n\nappears you were present, by the way, in the wood of Lettermore at\n\nthe moment of the fatal shot,\" he began.  \"Was this by accident?\"\n\n\n\n\"By accident,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"How came you in speech with Colin Campbell?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,\" I replied.\n\n\n\nI observed he did not write this answer down.\n\n\n\n\"H'm, true,\" said he, \"I had forgotten that.  And do you know, Mr.\n\nBalfour, I would dwell, if I were you, as little as might be on\n\nyour relations with these Stewarts.  It might be found to\n\ncomplicate our business.  I am not yet inclined to regard these\n\nmatters as essential.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were equally\n\nmaterial in such a case,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"You forget we are now trying these Stewarts,\" he replied, with\n\ngreat significance.  \"If we should ever come to be trying you, it\n\nwill be very different; and I shall press these very questions that\n\nI am now willing to glide upon.  But to resume:  I have it here in\n\nMr. Mungo Campbell's precognition that you ran immediately up the\n\nbrae.  How came that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not immediately, my lord, and the cause was my seeing of the\n\nmurderer.\"\n\n\n\n\"You saw him, then?\"\n\n\n\n\"As plain as I see your lordship, though not so near hand.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know him?\"\n\n\n\n\"I should know him again.\"\n\n\n\n\"In your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as to overtake\n\nhim?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was not.\"\n\n\n\n\"Was he alone?\"\n\n\n\n\"He was alone.\"\n\n\n\n\"There was no one else in that neighbourhood?\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a wood.\"\n\n\n\nThe Advocate laid his pen down.  \"I think we are playing at cross\n\npurposes,\" said he, \"which you will find to prove a very ill\n\namusement for yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"I content myself with following your lordship's advice, and\n\nanswering what I am asked,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time,\" said he, \"I use you\n\nwith the most anxious tenderness, which you scarce seem to\n\nappreciate, and which (unless you be more careful) may prove to be\n\nin vain.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to be mistaken,\"\n\nI replied, with something of a falter, for I saw we were come to\n\ngrips at last.  \"I am here to lay before you certain information,\n\nby which I shall convince you Alan had no hand whatever in the\n\nkilling of Glenure.\"\n\n\n\nThe Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting with pursed\n\nlips, and blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat.  \"Mr.\n\nBalfour,\" he said at last, \"I tell you pointedly you go an ill way\n\nfor your own interests.\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord,\" I said, \"I am as free of the charge of considering my\n\nown interests in this matter as your lordship.  As God judges me, I\n\nhave but the one design, and that is to see justice executed and\n\nthe innocent go clear.  If in pursuit of that I come to fall under\n\nyour lordship's displeasure, I must bear it as I may.\"\n\n\n\nAt this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and for a\n\nwhile gazed upon me steadily.  I was surprised to see a great\n\nchange of gravity fallen upon his face, and I could have almost\n\nthought he was a little pale.\n\n\n\n\"You are either very simple, or extremely the reverse, and I see\n\nthat I must deal with you more confidentially,\" says he.  \"This is\n\na political case--ah, yes, Mr. Balfour! whether we like it or no,\n\nthe case is political--and I tremble when I think what issues may\n\ndepend from it.  To a political case, I need scarce tell a young\n\nman of your education, we approach with very different thoughts\n\nfrom one which is criminal only.  Salus populi suprema lex is a\n\nmaxim susceptible of great abuse, but it has that force which we\n\nfind elsewhere only in the laws of nature:  I mean it has the force\n\nof necessity.  I will open this out to you, if you will allow me,\n\nat more length.  You would have me believe--\"\n\n\n\n\"Under your pardon, my lord, I would have you to believe nothing\n\nbut that which I can prove,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Tut! tut; young gentleman,\" says he, \"be not so pragmatical, and\n\nsuffer a man who might be your father (if it was nothing more) to\n\nemploy his own imperfect language, and express his own poor\n\nthoughts, even when they have the misfortune not to coincide with\n\nMr. Balfour's.  You would have me to believe Breck innocent.  I\n\nwould think this of little account, the more so as we cannot catch\n\nour man.  But the matter of Breck's innocence shoots beyond itself.\n\nOnce admitted, it would destroy the whole presumptions of our case\n\nagainst another and a very different criminal; a man grown old in\n\ntreason, already twice in arms against his king and already twice\n\nforgiven; a fomentor of discontent, and (whoever may have fired the\n\nshot) the unmistakable original of the deed in question.  I need\n\nnot tell you that I mean James Stewart.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James\n\nis what I am here to declare in private to your lordship, and what\n\nI am prepared to establish at the trial by my testimony,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"To which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr. Balfour,\"\n\nsaid he, \"that (in that case) your testimony will not be called by\n\nme, and I desire you to withhold it altogether.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are at the head of Justice in this country,\" I cried, \"and you\n\npropose to me a crime!\"\n\n\n\n\"I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country,\"\n\nhe replied, \"and I press on you a political necessity.  Patriotism\n\nis not always moral in the formal sense.  You might be glad of it,\n\nI think:  it is your own protection; the facts are heavy against\n\nyou; and if I am still trying to except you from a very dangerous\n\nplace, it is in part of course because I am not insensible to your\n\nhonesty in coming here; in part because of Pilrig's letter; but in\n\npart, and in chief part, because I regard in this matter my\n\npolitical duty first and my judicial duty only second.  For the\n\nsame reason--I repeat it to you in the same frank words--I do not\n\nwant your testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\"I desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I express only\n\nthe plain sense of our position,\" said I.  \"But if your lordship\n\nhas no need of my testimony, I believe the other side would be\n\nextremely blythe to get it.\"\n\n\n\nPrestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room.  \"You\n\nare not so young,\" he said, \"but what you must remember very\n\nclearly the year '45 and the shock that went about the country.  I\n\nread in Pilrig's letter that you are sound in Kirk and State.  Who\n\nsaved them in that fatal year?  I do not refer to His Royal\n\nHighness and his ramrods, which were extremely useful in their day;\n\nbut the country had been saved and the field won before ever\n\nCumberland came upon Drummossie.  Who saved it?  I repeat; who\n\nsaved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of our civil\n\ninstitutions?  The late Lord President Culloden, for one; he played\n\na man's part, and small thanks he got for it--even as I, whom you\n\nsee before you, straining every nerve in the same service, look for\n\nno reward beyond the conscience of my duties done.  After the\n\nPresident, who else?  You know the answer as well as I do; 'tis\n\npartly a scandal, and you glanced at it yourself, and I reproved\n\nyou for it, when you first came in.  It was the Duke and the great\n\nclan of Campbell.  Now here is a Campbell foully murdered, and that\n\nin the King's service.  The Duke and I are Highlanders.  But we are\n\nHighlanders civilised, and it is not so with the great mass of our\n\nclans and families.  They have still savage virtues and defects.\n\nThey are still barbarians, like these Stewarts; only the Campbells\n\nwere barbarians on the right side, and the Stewarts were barbarians\n\non the wrong.  Now be you the judge.  The Campbells expect\n\nvengeance.  If they do not get it--if this man James escape--there\n\nwill be trouble with the Campbells.  That means disturbance in the\n\nHighlands, which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed:  the\n\ndisarming is a farce. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"I can bear you out in that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful\n\nenemy,\" pursued his lordship, holding out a finger as he paced;\n\n\"and I give you my word we may have a '45 again with the Campbells\n\non the other side.  To protect the life of this man Stewart--which\n\nis forfeit already on half-a-dozen different counts if not on this-\n\n-do you propose to plunge your country in war, to jeopardise the\n\nfaith of your fathers, and to expose the lives and fortunes of how\n\nmany thousand innocent persons? . . .  These are considerations\n\nthat weigh with me, and that I hope will weigh no less with\n\nyourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your country, good government,\n\nand religious truth.\"\n\n\n\n\"You deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for it,\" said I.\n\n\"I will try on my side to be no less honest.  I believe your policy\n\nto be sound.  I believe these deep duties may lie upon your\n\nlordship; I believe you may have laid them on your conscience when\n\nyou took the oath of the high office which you hold.  But for me,\n\nwho am just a plain man--or scarce a man yet--the plain duties must\n\nsuffice.  I can think but of two things, of a poor soul in the\n\nimmediate and unjust danger of a shameful death, and of the cries\n\nand tears of his wife that still tingle in my head.  I cannot see\n\nbeyond, my lord.  It's the way that I am made.  If the country has\n\nto fall, it has to fall.  And I pray God, if this be wilful\n\nblindness, that He may enlighten me before too late.\"\n\n\n\nHe had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer.\n\n\n\n\"This is an unexpected obstacle,\" says he, aloud, but to himself.\n\n\n\n\"And how is your lordship to dispose of me?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"If I wished,\" said he, \"you know that you might sleep in gaol?\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord,\" said I, \"I have slept in worse places.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" said he, \"there is one thing appears very plainly\n\nfrom our interview, that I may rely on your pledged word.  Give me\n\nyour honour that you will be wholly secret, not only on what has\n\npassed to-night, but in the matter of the Appin case, and I let you\n\ngo free.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will give it till to-morrow or any other near day that you may\n\nplease to set,\" said I.  \"I would not be thought too wily; but if I\n\ngave the promise without qualification your lordship would have\n\nattained his end.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had no thought to entrap you,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I am sure of that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Let me see,\" he continued.  \"To-morrow is the Sabbath.  Come to me\n\non Monday by eight in the morning, and give me our promise until\n\nthen.\"\n\n\n\n\"Freely given, my lord,\" said I.  \"And with regard to what has\n\nfallen from yourself, I will give it for an long as it shall please\n\nGod to spare your days.\"\n\n\n\n\"You will observe,\" he said next, \"that I have made no employment\n\nof menaces.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was like your lordship's nobility,\" said I.  \"Yet I am not\n\naltogether so dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you\n\nhave not uttered.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"good-night to you.  May you sleep well, for I\n\nthink it is more than I am like to do.\"\n\n\n\nWith that he sighed, took up a candle, and gave me his conveyance\n\nas far as the street door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--IN THE ADVOCATE'S HOUSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I had long\n\nlooked forward to, to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers,\n\nall well known to me already by the report of Mr Campbell.  Alas!\n\nand I might just as well have been at Essendean, and sitting under\n\nMr. Campbell's worthy self! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt\n\ncontinually on the interview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me from\n\nall attention.  I was indeed much less impressed by the reasoning\n\nof the divines than by the spectacle of the thronged congregation\n\nin the churches, like what I imagined of a theatre or (in my then\n\ndisposition) of an assize of trial; above all at the West Kirk,\n\nwith its three tiers of galleries, where I went in the vain hope\n\nthat I might see Miss Drummond.\n\n\n\nOn the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber's, and was\n\nvery well pleased with the result.  Thence to the Advocate's, where\n\nthe red coats of the soldiers showed again about his door, making a\n\nbright place in the close.  I looked about for the young lady and\n\nher gillies:  there was never a sign of them.  But I was no sooner\n\nshown into the cabinet or antechamber where I had spent so wearyful\n\na time upon the Saturday, than I was aware of the tall figure of\n\nJames More in a corner.  He seemed a prey to a painful uneasiness,\n\nreaching forth his feet and hands, and his eyes speeding here and\n\nthere without rest about the walls of the small chamber, which\n\nrecalled to me with a sense of pity the man's wretched situation.\n\nI suppose it was partly this, and partly my strong continuing\n\ninterest in his daughter, that moved me to accost him.\n\n\n\n\"Give you a good-morning, sir,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And a good-morning to you, sir,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"You bide tryst with Prestongrange?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"I do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman be more\n\nagreeable than mine,\" was his reply.\n\n\n\n\"I hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose you pass\n\nbefore me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"All pass before me,\" he said, with a shrug and a gesture upward of\n\nthe open hands.  \"It was not always so, sir, but times change.  It\n\nwas not so when the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and\n\nthe virtues of the soldier might sustain themselves.\"\n\n\n\nThere came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my\n\ndander strangely.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Mr. Macgregor,\" said I, \"I understand the main thing for a\n\nsoldier is to be silent, and the first of his virtues never to\n\ncomplain.\"\n\n\n\n\"You have my name, I perceive\"--he bowed to me with his arms\n\ncrossed--\"though it's one I must not use myself.  Well, there is a\n\npublicity--I have shown my face and told my name too often in the\n\nbeards of my enemies.  I must not wonder if both should be known to\n\nmany that I know not.\"\n\n\n\n\"That you know not in the least, sir,\" said I, \"nor yet anybody\n\nelse; but the name I am called, if you care to hear it, is\n\nBalfour.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a good name,\" he replied, civilly; \"there are many decent\n\nfolk that use it.  And now that I call to mind, there was a young\n\ngentleman, your namesake, that marched surgeon in the year '45 with\n\nmy battalion.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,\" said I,\n\nfor I was ready for the surgeon now.\n\n\n\n\"The same, sir,\" said James More.  \"And since I have been fellow-\n\nsoldier with your kinsman, you must suffer me to grasp your hand.\"\n\n\n\nHe shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on me the while\n\nas though he had found a brother.\n\n\n\n\"Ah!\" says he, \"these are changed days since your cousin and I\n\nheard the balls whistle in our lugs.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think he was a very far-away cousin,\" said I, drily, \"and I\n\nought to tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"it makes no change.  And you--I do not\n\nthink you were out yourself, sir--I have no clear mind of your\n\nface, which is one not probable to be forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n\"In the year you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting skelped in\n\nthe parish school,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"So young!\" cries he.  \"Ah, then, you will never be able to think\n\nwhat this meeting is to me.  In the hour of my adversity, and here\n\nin the house of my enemy, to meet in with the blood of an old\n\nbrother-in-arms--it heartens me, Mr. Balfour, like the skirting of\n\nthe highland pipes!  Sir, this is a sad look back that many of us\n\nhave to make:  some with falling tears.  I have lived in my own\n\ncountry like a king; my sword, my mountains, and the faith of my\n\nfriends and kinsmen sufficed for me.  Now I lie in a stinking\n\ndungeon; and do you know, Mr. Balfour,\" he went on, taking my arm\n\nand beginning to lead me about, \"do you know, sir, that I lack mere\n\nneCESSaries?  The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my\n\nresources.  I lie, as you know, sir, on a trumped-up charge, of\n\nwhich I am as innocent as yourself.  They dare not bring me to my\n\ntrial, and in the meanwhile I am held naked in my prison.  I could\n\nhave wished it was your cousin I had met, or his brother Baith\n\nhimself.  Either would, I know, have been rejoiced to help me;\n\nwhile a comparative stranger like yourself--\"\n\n\n\nI would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this\n\nbeggarly vein, or the very short and grudging answers that I made\n\nto him.  There were times when I was tempted to stop his mouth with\n\nsome small change; but whether it was from shame or pride--whether\n\nit was for my own sake or Catriona's--whether it was because I\n\nthought him no fit father for his daughter, or because I resented\n\nthat grossness of immediate falsity that clung about the man\n\nhimself--the thing was clean beyond me.  And I was still being\n\nwheedled and preached to, and still being marched to and fro, three\n\nsteps and a turn, in that small chamber, and had already, by some\n\nvery short replies, highly incensed, although not finally\n\ndiscouraged, my beggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway\n\nand bade me eagerly into his big chamber.\n\n\n\n\"I have a moment's engagements,\" said he; \"and that you may not sit\n\nempty-handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters,\n\nof whom perhaps you may have heard, for I think they are more\n\nfamous than papa.  This way.\"\n\n\n\nHe led me into another long room above, where a dry old lady sat at\n\na frame of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I\n\nsuppose) in Scotland stood together by a window.\n\n\n\n\"This is my new friend, Mr Balfour,\" said he, presenting me by the\n\narm, \"David, here is my sister, Miss Grant, who is so good as keep\n\nmy house for me, and will be very pleased if she can help you.  And\n\nhere,\" says he, turning to the three younger ladies, \"here are my\n\nTHREE BRAW DAUCHTERS.  A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie:  which of\n\nthe three is the best favoured?  And I wager he will never have the\n\nimpudence to propound honest Alan Ramsay's answer!\"\n\n\n\nHereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well, cried out\n\nagainst this sally, which (as I was acquainted with the verses he\n\nreferred to) brought shame into my own check.  It seemed to me a\n\ncitation unpardonable in a father, and I was amazed that these\n\nladies could laugh even while they reproved, or made believe to.\n\n\n\nUnder cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber,\n\nand I was left, like a fish upon dry land, in that very unsuitable\n\nsociety.  I could never deny, in looking back upon what followed,\n\nthat I was eminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well\n\ndrilled to have so long a patience with me.  The aunt indeed sat\n\nclose at her embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling;\n\nbut the misses, and especially the eldest, who was besides the most\n\nhandsome, paid me a score of attentions which I was very ill able\n\nto repay.  It was all in vain to tell myself I was a young follow\n\nof some worth as well as a good estate, and had no call to feel\n\nabashed before these lasses, the eldest not so much older than\n\nmyself, and no one of them by any probability half as learned.\n\nReasoning would not change the fact; and there were times when the\n\ncolour came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the\n\nfirst time.\n\n\n\nThe talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily, the eldest\n\ntook pity on my awkwardness, sat down to her instrument, of which\n\nshe was a passed mistress, and entertained me for a while with\n\nplaying and singing, both in the Scots and in the Italian manners;\n\nthis put me more at my ease, and being reminded of Alan's air that\n\nhe had taught me in the hole near Carriden, I made so bold as to\n\nwhistle a bar or two, and ask if she knew that.\n\n\n\nShe shook her head.  \"I never heard a note of it,\" said she.\n\n\"Whistle it all through.  And now once again,\" she added, after I\n\nhad done so.\n\n\n\nThen she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise)\n\ninstantly enriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as\n\nshe played, with a very droll expression and broad accent -\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Haenae I got just the lilt of it?\n\nIsnae this the tune that ye whustled?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You see,\" she says, \"I can do the poetry too, only it won't rhyme.\n\nAnd then again:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:\n\nYou, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI told her how much astonished I was by her genius.\n\n\n\n\"And what do you call the name of it?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"I do not know the real name,\" said I.  \"I just call it Alan's\n\nair.\"\n\n\n\nShe looked at me directly in the face.  \"I shall call it David's\n\nair,\" said she; \"though if it's the least like what your namesake\n\nof Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got\n\nlittle good by it, for it's but melancholy music.  Your other name\n\nI do not like; so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again\n\nyou are to ask for it by mine.\"\n\n\n\nThis was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog.  \"Why\n\nthat, Miss Grant?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why,\" says she, \"if ever you should come to get hanged, I will set\n\nyour last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.\"\n\n\n\nThis put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story\n\nand peril.  How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess.\n\nIt was plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of\n\nAlan, and thus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain\n\nshe knew that I stood under some criminal suspicion.  I judged\n\nbesides that the harshness of her last speech (which besides she\n\nhad followed up immediately with a very noisy piece of music) was\n\nto put an end to the present conversation.  I stood beside her,\n\naffecting to listen and admire, but truly whirled away by my own\n\nthoughts.  I have always found this young lady to be a lover of the\n\nmysterious; and certainly this first interview made a mystery that\n\nwas beyond my plummet.  One thing I learned long after, the hours\n\nof the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been\n\nfound and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and\n\nthe deduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and\n\nmost likely in a continued correspondence with the last.  Hence\n\nthis broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the piece of music, one of the younger misses, who\n\nwas at a window over the close, cried on her sisters to come quick,\n\nfor there was \"Grey eyes again.\"  The whole family trooped there at\n\nonce, and crowded one another for a look.  The window whither they\n\nran was in an odd corner of that room, gave above the entrance\n\ndoor, and flanked up the close.\n\n\n\n\"Come, Mr. Balfour,\" they cried, \"come and see.  She is the most\n\nbeautiful creature!  She hangs round the close-head these last\n\ndays, always with some wretched-like gillies, and yet seems quite a\n\nlady.\"\n\n\n\nI had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or long.  I was\n\nafraid she might have seen me there, looking down upon her from\n\nthat chamber of music, and she without, and her father in the same\n\nhouse, perhaps begging for his life with tears, and myself come but\n\nnewly from rejecting his petitions.  But even that glance set me in\n\na better conceit of myself and much less awe of the young ladies.\n\nThey were beautiful, that was beyond question, but Catriona was\n\nbeautiful too, and had a kind of brightness in her like a coal of\n\nfire.  As much as the others cast me down, she lifted me up.  I\n\nremembered I had talked easily with her.  If I could make no hand\n\nof it with these fine maids, it was perhaps something their own\n\nfault.  My embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened\n\nwith a sense of fun; and when the aunt smiled at me from her\n\nembroidery, and the three daughters unbent to me like a baby, all\n\nwith \"papa's orders\" written on their faces, there were times when\n\nI could have found it in my heart to smile myself.\n\n\n\nPresently papa returned, the same kind, happy-like, pleasant-spoken\n\nman.\n\n\n\n\"Now, girls,\" said he, \"I must take Mr. Balfour away again; but I\n\nhope you have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be\n\nalways gratified to find him.\"\n\n\n\nSo they each made me a little farthing compliment, and I was led\n\naway.\n\n\n\nIf this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance,\n\nit was the worst of failures.  I was no such ass but what I\n\nunderstood how poor a figure I had made, and that the girls would\n\nbe yawning their jaws off as soon as my stiff back was turned.  I\n\nfelt I had shown how little I had in me of what was soft and\n\ngraceful; and I longed for a chance to prove that I had something\n\nof the other stuff, the stern and dangerous.\n\n\n\nWell, I was to be served to my desire, for the scene to which he\n\nwas conducting me was of a different character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--UMQUILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a man waiting us in Prestongrange's study, whom I\n\ndistasted at the first look, as we distaste a ferret or an earwig.\n\nHe was bitter ugly, but seemed very much of a gentleman; had still\n\nmanners, but capable of sudden leaps and violences; and a small\n\nvoice, which could ring out shrill and dangerous when he so\n\ndesired.\n\n\n\nThe Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way.\n\n\n\n\"Here, Fraser,\" said he, \"here is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about.\n\nMr. David, this is Mr. Simon Fraser, whom we used to call by\n\nanother title, but that is an old song.  Mr. Fraser has an errand\n\nto you.\"\n\n\n\nWith that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and made believe to\n\nconsult a quarto volume in the far end.\n\n\n\nI was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last person in\n\nthe world I had expected.  There was no doubt upon the terms of\n\nintroduction; this could be no other than the forfeited Master of\n\nLovat and chief of the great clan Fraser.  I knew he had led his\n\nmen in the Rebellion; I knew his father's head--my old lord's, that\n\ngrey fox of the mountains--to have fallen on the block for that\n\noffence, the lands of the family to have been seized, and their\n\nnobility attainted.  I could not conceive what he should be doing\n\nin Grant's house; I could not conceive that he had been called to\n\nthe bar, had eaten all his principles, and was now currying favour\n\nwith the Government even to the extent of acting Advocate-Depute in\n\nthe Appin murder.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Mr. Balfour,\" said he, \"what is all this I hear of ye?\"\n\n\n\n\"It would not become me to prejudge,\" said I, \"but if the Advocate\n\nwas your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions.\"\n\n\n\n\"I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,\" he went on; \"I am\n\nto appear under Prestongrange; and from my study of the\n\nprecognitions I can assure you your opinions are erroneous.  The\n\nguilt of Breck is manifest; and your testimony, in which you admit\n\nyou saw him on the hill at the very moment, will certify his\n\nhanging.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,\" I observed.\n\n\"And for other matters I very willingly leave you to your own\n\nimpressions.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Duke has been informed,\" he went on.  \"I have just come from\n\nhis Grace, and he expressed himself before me with an honest\n\nfreedom like the great nobleman he is.  He spoke of you by name,\n\nMr. Balfour, and declared his gratitude beforehand in case you\n\nwould be led by those who understand your own interests and those\n\nof the country so much better than yourself.  Gratitude is no empty\n\nexpression in that mouth:  experto-crede.  I daresay you know\n\nsomething of my name and clan, and the damnable example and\n\nlamented end of my late father, to say nothing of my own errata.\n\nWell, I have made my peace with that good Duke; he has intervened\n\nfor me with our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with my foot in\n\nthe stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into my\n\nhand of prosecuting King George's enemies and avenging the late\n\ndaring and barefaced insult to his Majesty.\"\n\n\n\n\"Doubtless a proud position for your father's son,\" says I.\n\n\n\nHe wagged his bald eyebrows at me.  \"You are pleased to make\n\nexperiments in the ironical, I think,\" said he.  \"But I am here\n\nupon duty, I am here to discharge my errand in good faith, it is in\n\nvain you think to divert me.  And let me tell you, for a young\n\nfellow of spirit and ambition like yourself, a good shove in the\n\nbeginning will do more than ten years' drudgery.  The shove is now\n\nat your command; choose what you will to be advanced in, the Duke\n\nwill watch upon you with the affectionate disposition of a father.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"And do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy of this\n\ncountry is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill-\n\nmannered colt of a boy?\" he cried.  \"This has been made a test\n\ncase, all who would prosper in the future must put a shoulder to\n\nthe wheel.  Look at me!  Do you suppose it is for my pleasure that\n\nI put myself in the highly invidious position of persecuting a man\n\nthat I have drawn the sword alongside of?  The choice is not left\n\nme.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in\n\nwith that unnatural rebellion,\" I remarked.  \"My case is happily\n\notherwise; I am a true man, and can look either the Duke or King\n\nGeorge in the face without concern.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is it so the wind sits?\" says he.  \"I protest you are fallen in\n\nthe worst sort of error.  Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil\n\n(he tells me) as not to combat your allegations; but you must not\n\nthink they are not looked upon with strong suspicion.  You say you\n\nare innocent.  My dear sir, the facts declare you guilty.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was waiting for you there,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"The evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after the completion\n\nof the murder; your long course of secresy--my good young man!\"\n\nsaid Mr. Simon, \"here is enough evidence to hang a bullock, let be\n\na David Balfour!  I shall be upon that trial; my voice shall be\n\nraised; I shall then speak much otherwise from what I do to-day,\n\nand far less to your gratification, little as you like it now!  Ah,\n\nyou look white!\" cries he.  \"I have found the key of your impudent\n\nheart.  You look pale, your eyes waver, Mr. David!  You see the\n\ngrave and the gallows nearer by than you had fancied.\"\n\n\n\n\"I own to a natural weakness,\" said I.  \"I think no shame for that.\n\nShame. . .\"  I was going on.\n\n\n\n\"Shame waits for you on the gibbet,\" he broke in.\n\n\n\n\"Where I shall but be even'd with my lord your father,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Aha, but not so!\" he cried, \"and you do not yet see to the bottom\n\nof this business.  My father suffered in a great cause, and for\n\ndealing in the affairs of kings.  You are to hang for a dirty\n\nmurder about boddle-pieces.  Your personal part in it, the\n\ntreacherous one of holding the poor wretch in talk, your\n\naccomplices a pack of ragged Highland gillies.  And it can be\n\nshown, my great Mr. Balfour--it can be shown, and it WILL be shown,\n\ntrust ME that has a finger in the pie--it can be shown, and shall\n\nbe shown, that you were paid to do it.  I think I can see the looks\n\ngo round the court when I adduce my evidence, and it shall appear\n\nthat you, a young man of education, let yourself be corrupted to\n\nthis shocking act for a suit of cast clothes, a bottle of Highland\n\nspirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in copper money.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like\n\na blow:  clothes, a bottle of usquebaugh, and three-and-fivepence-\n\nhalfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of what Alan and I\n\nhad carried from Auchurn; and I saw that some of James's people had\n\nbeen blabbing in their dungeons.\n\n\n\n\"You see I know more than you fancied,\" he resumed in triumph.\n\n\"And as for giving it this turn, great Mr. David, you must not\n\nsuppose the Government of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be\n\nstuck for want of evidence.  We have men here in prison who will\n\nswear out their lives as we direct them; as I direct, if you prefer\n\nthe phrase.  So now you are to guess your part of glory if you\n\nchoose to die.  On the one hand, life, wine, women, and a duke to\n\nbe your handgun:  on the other, a rope to your craig, and a gibbet\n\nto clatter your bones on, and the lousiest, lowest story to hand\n\ndown to your namesakes in the future that was ever told about a\n\nhired assassin.  And see here!\" he cried, with a formidable shrill\n\nvoice, \"see this paper that I pull out of my pocket.  Look at the\n\nname there:  it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink\n\nscarce dry yet.  Can you guess its nature?  It is the warrant for\n\nyour arrest, which I have but to touch this bell beside me to have\n\nexecuted on the spot.  Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper, may\n\nGod help you, for the die is cast!\"\n\n\n\nI must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness,\n\nand much unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger.  Mr.\n\nSimon had already gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt\n\nI was now no ruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.\n\n\n\n\"There is a gentleman in this room,\" cried I.  \"I appeal to him.  I\n\nput my life and credit in his hands.\"\n\n\n\nPrestongrange shut his book with a snap.  \"I told you so, Simon,\"\n\nsaid he; \"you have played your hand for all it was worth, and you\n\nhave lost.  Mr. David,\" he went on, \"I wish you to believe it was\n\nby no choice of mine you were subjected to this proof.  I wish you\n\ncould understand how glad I am you should come forth from it with\n\nso much credit.  You may not quite see how, but it is a little of a\n\nservice to myself.  For had our friend here been more successful\n\nthan I was last night, it might have appeared that he was a better\n\njudge of men than I; it might have appeared we were altogether in\n\nthe wrong situations, Mr. Simon and myself.  And I know our friend\n\nSimon to be ambitious,\" says he, striking lightly on Fraser's\n\nshoulder.  \"As for this stage play, it is over; my sentiments are\n\nvery much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we can find to\n\nthis unfortunate affair, I shall make it my business to see it is\n\nadopted with tenderness to you.\"\n\n\n\nThese were very good words, and I could see besides that there was\n\nlittle love, and perhaps a spice of genuine ill-will, between these\n\ntwo who were opposed to me.  For all that, it was unmistakable this\n\ninterview had been designed, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of\n\nboth; it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by all\n\nmethods; and now (persuasion, flattery, and menaces having been\n\ntried in vain) I could not but wonder what would be their next\n\nexpedient.  My eyes besides were still troubled, and my knees loose\n\nunder me, with the distress of the late ordeal; and I could do no\n\nmore than stammer the same form of words:  \"I put my life and\n\ncredit in your hands.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"we must try to save them.  And in the\n\nmeanwhile let us return to gentler methods.  You must not bear any\n\ngrudge upon my friend, Mr. Simon, who did but speak by his brief.\n\nAnd even if you did conceive some malice against myself, who stood\n\nby and seemed rather to hold a candle, I must not let that extend\n\nto innocent members of my family.  These are greatly engaged to see\n\nmore of you, and I cannot consent to have my young womenfolk\n\ndisappointed.  To-morrow they will be going to Hope Park, where I\n\nthink it very proper you should make your bow.  Call for me first,\n\nwhen I may possibly have something for your private hearing; then\n\nyou shall be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses;\n\nand until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy.\"\n\n\n\nI had done better to have instantly refused, but in truth I was\n\nbeside the power of reasoning; did as I was bid; took my leave I\n\nknow not how; and when I was forth again in the close, and the door\n\nhad shut behind me, was glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my\n\nface.  That horrid apparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang\n\nin my memory, as a sudden noise rings after it is over in the ear.\n\nTales of the man's father, of his falseness, of his manifold\n\nperpetual treacheries, rose before me from all that I had heard and\n\nread, and joined on with what I had just experienced of himself.\n\nEach time it occurred to me, the ingenious foulness of that calumny\n\nhe had proposed to nail upon my character startled me afresh.  The\n\ncase of the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk appeared scarce\n\ndistinguishable from that I was now to consider as my own.  To rob\n\na child of so little more than nothing was certainly a paltry\n\nenterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as it was to be\n\nrepresented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared a fair second in\n\nevery possible point of view of sordidness and cowardice.\n\n\n\nThe voices of two of Prestongrange's liveried men upon his doorstep\n\nrecalled me to myself.\n\n\n\n\"Ha'e,\" said the one, \"this billet as fast as ye can link to the\n\ncaptain.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that for the cateran back again?\" asked the other.\n\n\n\n\"It would seem sae,\" returned the first.  \"Him and Simon are\n\nseeking him.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think Prestongrange is gane gyte,\" says the second.  \"He'll have\n\nJames More in bed with him next.\"\n\n\n\n\"Weel, it's neither your affair nor mine's,\" said the first.\n\n\n\nAnd they parted, the one upon his errand, and the other back into\n\nthe house.\n\n\n\nThis looked as ill as possible.  I was scarce gone and they were\n\nsending already for James More, to whom I thought Mr. Simon must\n\nhave pointed when he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem\n\ntheir lives by all extremities.  My scalp curdled among my hair,\n\nand the next moment the blood leaped in me to remember Catriona.\n\nPoor lass! her father stood to be hanged for pretty indefensible\n\nmisconduct.  What was yet more unpalatable, it now seemed he was\n\nprepared to save his four quarters by the worst of shame and the\n\nmost foul of cowardly murders--murder by the false oath; and to\n\ncomplete our misfortunes, it seemed myself was picked out to be the\n\nvictim.\n\n\n\nI began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only of a desire\n\nfor movement, air, and the open country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--I MAKE A FAULT IN HONOUR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI came forth, I vow I know not how, on the Lang Dykes {12}.  This\n\nis a rural road which runs on the north side over against the city.\n\nThence I could see the whole black length of it tail down, from\n\nwhere the castle stands upon its crags above the loch in a long\n\nline of spires and gable ends, and smoking chimneys, and at the\n\nsight my heart swelled in my bosom.  My youth, as I have told, was\n\nalready inured to dangers; but such danger as I had seen the face\n\nof but that morning, in the midst of what they call the safety of a\n\ntown, shook me beyond experience.  Peril of slavery, peril of\n\nshipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood all of these\n\nwithout discredit; but the peril there was in the sharp voice and\n\nthe fat face of Simon, property Lord Lovat, daunted me wholly.\n\n\n\nI sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into\n\nthe water, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples.  If I\n\ncould have done so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now\n\nhave fled from my foolhardy enterprise.  But (call it courage or\n\ncowardice, and I believe it was both the one and the other) I\n\ndecided I was ventured out beyond the possibility of a retreat.  I\n\nhad out-faced these men, I would continue to out-face them; come\n\nwhat might, I would stand by the word spoken.\n\n\n\nThe sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits, but not\n\nmuch.  At the best of it there was an icy place about my heart, and\n\nlife seemed a black business to be at all engaged in.  For two\n\nsouls in particular my pity flowed.  The one was myself, to be so\n\nfriendless and lost among dangers.  The other was the girl, the\n\ndaughter of James More.  I had seen but little of her; yet my view\n\nwas taken and my judgment made.  I thought her a lass of a clean\n\nhonour, like a man's; I thought her one to die of a disgrace; and\n\nnow I believed her father to be at that moment bargaining his vile\n\nlife for mine.  It made a bond in my thoughts betwixt the girl and\n\nme.  I had seen her before only as a wayside appearance, though one\n\nthat pleased me strangely; I saw her now in a sudden nearness of\n\nrelation, as the daughter of my blood foe, and I might say, my\n\nmurderer.  I reflected it was hard I should be so plagued and\n\npersecuted all my days for other folks' affairs, and have no manner\n\nof pleasure myself.  I got meals and a bed to sleep in when my\n\nconcerns would suffer it; beyond that my wealth was of no help to\n\nme.  If I was to hang, my days were like to be short; if I was not\n\nto hang but to escape out of this trouble, they might yet seem long\n\nto me ere I was done with them.  Of a sudden her face appeared in\n\nmy memory, the way I had first seen it, with the parted lips; at\n\nthat, weakness came in my bosom and strength into my legs; and I\n\nset resolutely forward on the way to Dean.  If I was to hang to-\n\nmorrow, and it was sure enough I might very likely sleep that night\n\nin a dungeon, I determined I should hear and speak once more with\n\nCatriona.\n\n\n\nThe exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me\n\nyet more, so that I began to pluck up a kind of spirit.  In the\n\nvillage of Dean, where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the\n\nriver, I inquired my way of a miller's man, who sent me up the hill\n\nupon the farther side by a plain path, and so to a decent-like\n\nsmall house in a garden of lawns and apple-trees.  My heart beat\n\nhigh as I stepped inside the garden hedge, but it fell low indeed\n\nwhen I came face to face with a grim and fierce old lady, walking\n\nthere in a white mutch with a man's hat strapped upon the top of\n\nit.\n\n\n\n\"What do ye come seeking here?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nI told her I was after Miss Drummond.\n\n\n\n\"And what may be your business with Miss Drummond?\" says she.\n\n\n\nI told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been so fortunate as\n\nto render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young\n\nlady's invitation.\n\n\n\n\"O, so you're Saxpence!\" she cried, with a very sneering manner.\n\n\"A braw gift, a bonny gentleman.  And hae ye ony ither name and\n\ndesignation, or were ye bapteesed Saxpence?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nI told my name.\n\n\n\n\"Preserve me!\" she cried.  \"Has Ebenezer gotten a son?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" said I.  \"I am a son of Alexander's.  It's I that am\n\nthe Laird of Shaws.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye'll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,\" quoth she.\n\n\n\n\"I perceive you know my uncle,\" said I; \"and I daresay you may be\n\nthe better pleased to hear that business is arranged.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?\" she pursued.\n\n\n\n\"I'm come after my saxpence, mem,\" said I.  \"It's to be thought,\n\nbeing my uncle's nephew, I would be found a careful lad.\"\n\n\n\n\"So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?\" observed the old lady, with\n\nsome approval.  \"I thought ye had just been a cuif--you and your\n\nsaxpence, and your LUCKY DAY and your SAKE OF BALWHIDDER\"--from\n\nwhich I was gratified to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some\n\nof our talk.  \"But all this is by the purpose,\" she resumed.  \"Am I\n\nto understand that ye come here keeping company?\"\n\n\n\n\"This is surely rather an early question,\" said I.  \"The maid is\n\nyoung, so am I, worse fortune.  I have but seen her the once.  I'll\n\nnot deny,\" I added, making up my mind to try her with some\n\nfrankness, \"I'll not deny but she has run in my head a good deal\n\nsince I met in with her.  That is one thing; but it would be quite\n\nanother, and I think I would look very like a fool, to commit\n\nmyself.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can speak out of your mouth, I see,\" said the old lady.\n\n\"Praise God, and so can I!  I was fool enough to take charge of\n\nthis rogue's daughter:  a fine charge I have gotten; but it's mine,\n\nand I'll carry it the way I want to.  Do ye mean to tell me, Mr.\n\nBalfour of Shaws, that you would marry James More's daughter, and\n\nhim hanged!  Well, then, where there's no possible marriage there\n\nshall be no manner of carryings on, and take that for said.  Lasses\n\nare bruckle things,\" she added, with a nod; \"and though ye would\n\nnever think it by my wrunkled chafts, I was a lassie mysel', and a\n\nbonny one.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady Allardyce,\" said I, \"for that I suppose to be your name, you\n\nseem to do the two sides of the talking, which is a very poor\n\nmanner to come to an agreement.  You give me rather a home thrust\n\nwhen you ask if I would marry, at the gallow's foot, a young lady\n\nwhom I have seen but once.  I have told you already I would never\n\nbe so untenty as to commit myself.  And yet I'll go some way with\n\nyou.  If I continue to like the lass as well as I have reason to\n\nexpect, it will be something more than her father, or the gallows\n\neither, that keeps the two of us apart.  As for my family, I found\n\nit by the wayside like a lost bawbee!  I owe less than nothing to\n\nmy uncle and if ever I marry, it will be to please one person:\n\nthat's myself.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,\" said Mrs.\n\nOgilvy, \"which is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little.\n\nThere's much to be considered.  This James More is a kinsman of\n\nmine, to my shame be it spoken.  But the better the family, the\n\nmair men hanged or headed, that's always been poor Scotland's\n\nstory.  And if it was just the hanging!  For my part I think I\n\nwould be best pleased with James upon the gallows, which would be\n\nat least an end to him.  Catrine's a good lass enough, and a good-\n\nhearted, and lets herself be deaved all day with a runt of an auld\n\nwife like me.  But, ye see, there's the weak bit.  She's daft about\n\nthat long, false, fleeching beggar of a father of hers, and red-mad\n\nabout the Gregara, and proscribed names, and King James, and a\n\nwheen blethers.  And you might think ye could guide her, ye would\n\nfind yourself sore mista'en.  Ye say ye've seen her but the once. .\n\n.\"\n\n\n\n\"Spoke with her but the once, I should have said,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"I saw her again this morning from a window at Prestongrange's.\"\n\n\n\nThis I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I was properly\n\npaid for my ostentation on the return.\n\n\n\n\"What's this of it?\" cries the old lady, with a sudden pucker of\n\nher face.  \"I think it was at the Advocate's door-cheek that ye met\n\nher first.\"\n\n\n\nI told her that was so.\n\n\n\n\"H'm,\" she said; and then suddenly, upon rather a scolding tone, \"I\n\nhave your bare word for it,\" she cries, \"as to who and what you\n\nare.  By your way of it, you're Balfour of the Shaws; but for what\n\nI ken you may be Balfour of the Deevil's oxter.  It's possible ye\n\nmay come here for what ye say, and it's equally possible ye may\n\ncome here for deil care what!  I'm good enough Whig to sit quiet,\n\nand to have keepit all my men-folk's heads upon their shoulders.\n\nBut I'm not just a good enough Whig to be made a fool of neither.\n\nAnd I tell you fairly, there's too much Advocate's door and\n\nAdvocate's window here for a man that comes taigling after a\n\nMacgregor's daughter.  Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent\n\nye, with my fond love.  And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr. Balfour,\"\n\nsays she, suiting the action to the word; \"and a braw journey to ye\n\nback to where ye cam frae.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you think me a spy,\" I broke out, and speech stuck in my\n\nthroat.  I stood and looked murder at the old lady for a space,\n\nthen bowed and turned away.\n\n\n\n\"Here!  Hoots!  The callant's in a creel!\" she cried.  \"Think ye a\n\nspy? what else would I think ye--me that kens naething by ye?  But\n\nI see that I was wrong; and as I cannot fight, I'll have to\n\napologise.  A bonny figure I would be with a broadsword.  Ay! ay!\"\n\nshe went on, \"you're none such a bad lad in your way; I think ye'll\n\nhave some redeeming vices.  But, O! Davit Balfour, ye're damned\n\ncountryfeed.  Ye'll have to win over that, lad; ye'll have to\n\nsoople your back-bone, and think a wee pickle less of your dainty\n\nself; and ye'll have to try to find out that women-folk are nae\n\ngrenadiers.  But that can never be.  To your last day you'll ken no\n\nmore of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.\"\n\n\n\nI had never been used with such expressions from a lady's tongue,\n\nthe only two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being\n\nmost devout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement\n\nmust have been depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst\n\nforth suddenly in a fit of laughter.\n\n\n\n\"Keep me!\" she cried, struggling with her mirth, \"you have the\n\nfinest timber face--and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland\n\ncateran!  Davie, my dear, I think we'll have to make a match of it-\n\n-if it was just to see the weans.  And now,\" she went on, \"there's\n\nno manner of service in your daidling here, for the young woman is\n\nfrom home, and it's my fear that the old woman is no suitable\n\ncompanion for your father's son.  Forbye that I have nobody but\n\nmyself to look after my reputation, and have been long enough alone\n\nwith a sedooctive youth.  And come back another day for your\n\nsaxpence!\" she cried after me as I left.\n\n\n\nMy skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a\n\nboldness they had otherwise wanted.  For two days the image of\n\nCatriona had mixed in all my meditations; she made their\n\nbackground, so that I scarce enjoyed my own company without a glint\n\nof her in a corner of my mind.  But now she came immediately near;\n\nI seemed to touch her, whom I had never touched but the once; I let\n\nmyself flow out to her in a happy weakness, and looking all about,\n\nand before and behind, saw the world like an undesirable desert,\n\nwhere men go as soldiers on a march, following their duty with what\n\nconstancy they have, and Catriona alone there to offer me some\n\npleasure of my days.  I wondered at myself that I could dwell on\n\nsuch considerations in that time of my peril and disgrace; and when\n\nI remembered my youth I was ashamed.  I had my studies to complete:\n\nI had to be called into some useful business; I had yet to take my\n\npart of service in a place where all must serve; I had yet to\n\nlearn, and know, and prove myself a man; and I had so much sense as\n\nblush that I should be already tempted with these further-on and\n\nholier delights and duties.  My education spoke home to me sharply;\n\nI was never brought up on sugar biscuits but on the hard food of\n\nthe truth.  I knew that he was quite unfit to be a husband who was\n\nnot prepared to be a father also; and for a boy like me to play the\n\nfather was a mere derision.\n\n\n\nWhen I was in the midst of these thoughts and about half-way back\n\nto town I saw a figure coming to meet me, and the trouble of my\n\nheart was heightened.  It seemed I had everything in the world to\n\nsay to her, but nothing to say first; and remembering how tongue-\n\ntied I had been that morning at the Advocate's I made sure that I\n\nwould find myself struck dumb.  But when she came up my fears fled\n\naway; not even the consciousness of what I had been privately\n\nthinking disconcerted me the least; and I found I could talk with\n\nher as easily and rationally as I might with Alan.\n\n\n\n\"O!\" she cried, \"you have been seeking your sixpence; did you get\n\nit?\"\n\n\n\nI told her no; but now I had met with her my walk was not in vain.\n\n\"Though I have seen you to-day already,\" said I, and told her where\n\nand when.\n\n\n\n\"I did not see you,\" she said.  \"My eyes are big, but there are\n\nbetter than mine at seeing far.  Only I heard singing in the\n\nhouse.\"\n\n\n\n\"That was Miss Grant,\" said I, \"the eldest and the bonniest.\"\n\n\n\n\"They say they are all beautiful,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"They think the same of you, Miss Drummond,\" I replied, \"and were\n\nall crowding to the window to observe you.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a pity about my being so blind,\" said she, \"or I might have\n\nseen them too.  And you were in the house?  You must have been\n\nhaving the fine time with the fine music and the pretty ladies.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is just where you are wrong,\" said I; \"for I was as uncouth\n\nas a sea-fish upon the brae of a mountain.  The truth is that I am\n\nbetter fitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I would think so too, at all events!\" said she, at which we\n\nboth of us laughed.\n\n\n\n\"It is a strange thing, now,\" said I.  \"I am not the least afraid\n\nwith you, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants.  And I was\n\nafraid of your cousin too.\"\n\n\n\n\"O, I think any man will be afraid of her,\" she cried.  \"My father\n\nis afraid of her himself.\"\n\n\n\nThe name of her father brought me to a stop.  I looked at her as\n\nshe walked by my side; I recalled the man, and the little I knew\n\nand the much I guessed of him; and comparing the one with the\n\nother, felt like a traitor to be silent.\n\n\n\n\"Speaking of which,\" said I, \"I met your father no later than this\n\nmorning.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you?\" she cried, with a voice of joy that seemed to mock at\n\nme.  \"You saw James More?  You will have spoken with him then?\"\n\n\n\n\"I did even that,\" said I.\n\n\n\nThen I think things went the worst way for me that was humanly\n\npossible.  She gave me a look of mere gratitude.  \"Ah, thank you\n\nfor that!\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"You thank me for very little,\" said I, and then stopped.  But it\n\nseemed when I was holding back so much, something at least had to\n\ncome out.  \"I spoke rather ill to him,\" said I; \"I did no like him\n\nvery much; I spoke him rather ill, and he was angry.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to his\n\ndaughter!\" she cried out.  \"But those that do not love and cherish\n\nhim I will not know.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will take the freedom of a word yet,\" said I, beginning to\n\ntremble.  \"Perhaps neither your father nor I are in the best of\n\nspirits at Prestongrange's.  I daresay we both have anxious\n\nbusiness there, for it's a dangerous house.  I was sorry for him\n\ntoo, and spoke to him the first, if I could but have spoken the\n\nwiser.  And for one thing, in my opinion, you will soon find that\n\nhis affairs are mending.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,\" said she;\n\n\"and he is much made up to you for your sorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\"Miss Drummond,\" cried I, \"I am alone in this world.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I am not wondering at that,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"O, let me speak!\" said I.  \"I will speak but the once, and then\n\nleave you, if you will, for ever.  I came this day in the hopes of\n\na kind word that I am sore in want of.  I know that what I said\n\nmust hurt you, and I knew it then.  It would have been easy to have\n\nspoken smooth, easy to lie to you; can you not think how I was\n\ntempted to the same?  Cannot you see the truth of my heart shine\n\nout?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,\" said she.  \"I\n\nthink we will have met but the once, and will can part like gentle\n\nfolk.\"\n\n\n\n\"O, let me have one to believe in me!\" I pleaded, \"I cannae bear it\n\nelse.  The whole world is clanned against me.  How am I to go\n\nthrough with my dreadful fate?  If there's to be none to believe in\n\nme I cannot do it.  The man must just die, for I cannot do it.\"\n\n\n\nShe had still looked straight in front of her, head in air; but at\n\nmy words or the tone of my voice she came to a stop.  \"What is this\n\nyou say?\" she asked.  \"What are you talking of?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is my testimony which may save an innocent life,\" said I, \"and\n\nthey will not suffer me to bear it.  What would you do yourself?\n\nYou know what this is, whose father lies in danger.  Would you\n\ndesert the poor soul?  They have tried all ways with me.  They have\n\nsought to bribe me; they offered me hills and valleys.  And to-day\n\nthat sleuth-hound told me how I stood, and to what a length he\n\nwould go to butcher and disgrace me.  I am to be brought in a party\n\nto the murder; I am to have held Glenure in talk for money and old\n\nclothes; I am to be killed and shamed.  If this is the way I am to\n\nfall, and me scarce a man--if this is the story to be told of me in\n\nall Scotland--if you are to believe it too, and my name is to be\n\nnothing but a by-word--Catriona, how can I go through with it?  The\n\nthing's not possible; it's more than a man has in his heart.\"\n\n\n\nI poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other; and when I\n\nstopped I found her gazing on me with a startled face.\n\n\n\n\"Glenure!  It is the Appin murder,\" she said softly, but with a\n\nvery deep surprise.\n\n\n\nI had turned back to bear her company, and we were now come near\n\nthe head of the brae above Dean village.  At this word I stepped in\n\nfront of her like one suddenly distracted.\n\n\n\n\"For God's sake!\" I cried, \"for God's sake, what is this that I\n\nhave done?\" and carried my fists to my temples.  \"What made me do\n\nit?  Sure, I am bewitched to say these things!\"\n\n\n\n\"In the name of heaven, what ails you now!\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"I gave my honour,\" I groaned, \"I gave my honour and now I have\n\nbroke it.  O, Catriona!\"\n\n\n\n\"I am asking you what it is,\" she said; \"was it these things you\n\nshould not have spoken?  And do you think I have no honour, then?\n\nor that I am one that would betray a friend?  I hold up my right\n\nhand to you and swear.\"\n\n\n\n\"O, I knew you would be true!\" said I.  \"It's me--it's here.  I\n\nthat stood but this morning and out-faced them, that risked rather\n\nto die disgraced upon the gallows than do wrong--and a few hours\n\nafter I throw my honour away by the roadside in common talk!\n\n'There is one thing clear upon our interview,' says he, 'that I can\n\nrely on your pledged word.'  Where is my word now?  Who could\n\nbelieve me now?  You could not believe me.  I am clean fallen down;\n\nI had best die!\"  All this I said with a weeping voice, but I had\n\nno tears in my body.\n\n\n\n\"My heart is sore for you,\" said she, \"but be sure you are too\n\nnice.  I would not believe you, do you say?  I would trust you with\n\nanything.  And these men?  I would not be thinking of them!  Men\n\nwho go about to entrap and to destroy you!  Fy! this is no time to\n\ncrouch.  Look up!  Do you not think I will be admiring you like a\n\ngreat hero of the good--and you a boy not much older than myself?\n\nAnd because you said a word too much in a friend's ear, that would\n\ndie ere she betrayed you--to make such a matter!  It is one thing\n\nthat we must both forget.\"\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, looking at her, hang-dog, \"is this true of it?\n\nWould ye trust me yet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Will you not believe the tears upon my face?\" she cried.  \"It is\n\nthe world I am thinking of you, Mr. David Balfour.  Let them hang\n\nyou; I will never forget, I will grow old and still remember you.\n\nI think it is great to die so:  I will envy you that gallows.\"\n\n\n\n\"And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles,\"\n\nsaid I.  \"Maybe they but make a mock of me.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is what I must know,\" she said.  \"I must hear the whole.  The\n\nharm is done at all events, and I must hear the whole.\"\n\n\n\nI had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place beside me,\n\nand I told her all that matter much as I have written it, my\n\nthoughts about her father's dealings being alone omitted.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" she said, when I had finished, \"you are a hero, surely, and\n\nI never would have thought that same!  And I think you are in\n\nperil, too.  O, Simon Fraser! to think upon that man!  For his life\n\nand the dirty money, to be dealing in such traffic!\"  And just then\n\nshe called out aloud with a queer word that was common with her,\n\nand belongs, I believe, to her own language.  \"My torture!\" says\n\nshe, \"look at the sun!\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains.\n\n\n\nShe bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left me in a\n\nturmoil of glad spirits.  I delayed to go home to my lodging, for I\n\nhad a terror of immediate arrest; but got some supper at a change\n\nhouse, and the better part of that night walked by myself in the\n\nbarley-fields, and had such a sense of Catriona's presence that I\n\nseemed to bear her in my arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE BRAVO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the Advocate's\n\nin a coat that I had made to my own measure, and was but newly\n\nready,\n\n\n\n\"Aha,\" says Prestongrange, \"you are very fine to-day; my misses are\n\nto have a fine cavalier.  Come, I take that kind of you.  I take\n\nthat kind of you, Mr. David.  O, we shall do very well yet, and I\n\nbelieve your troubles are nearly at an end.\"\n\n\n\n\"You have news for me?\" cried I.\n\n\n\n\"Beyond anticipation,\" he replied.  \"Your testimony is after all to\n\nbe received; and you may go, if you will, in my company to the\n\ntrial, which in to be held at Inverary, Thursday, 21st proximo.\"\n\n\n\nI was too much amazed to find words.\n\n\n\n\"In the meanwhile,\" he continued, \"though I will not ask you to\n\nrenew your pledge, I must caution you strictly to be reticent.  To-\n\nmorrow your precognition must be taken; and outside of that, do you\n\nknow, I think least said will be soonest mended.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall try to go discreetly,' said I.  \"I believe it is yourself\n\nthat I must thank for this crowning mercy, and I do thank you\n\ngratefully.  After yesterday, my lord, this is like the doors of\n\nHeaven.  I cannot find it in my heart to get the thing believed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but you must try and manage, you must try and manage to\n\nbelieve it,\" says he, soothing-like, \"and I am very glad to hear\n\nyour acknowledgment of obligation, for I think you may be able to\n\nrepay me very shortly\"--he coughed--\"or even now.  The matter is\n\nmuch changed.  Your testimony, which I shall not trouble you for\n\nto-day, will doubtless alter the complexion of the case for all\n\nconcerned, and this makes it less delicate for me to enter with you\n\non a side issue.\"\n\n\n\n\"My Lord,\" I interrupted, \"excuse me for interrupting you, but how\n\nhas this been brought about?  The obstacles you told me of on\n\nSaturday appeared even to me to be quite insurmountable; how has it\n\nbeen contrived?\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear Mr. David,\" said he, \"it would never do for me to divulge\n\n(even to you, as you say) the councils of the Government; and you\n\nmust content yourself, if you please, with the gross fact.\"\n\n\n\nHe smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing the while with\n\na new pen; methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of\n\ndeception in the man:  yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper,\n\ndipped his pen among the ink, and began again to address me, I was\n\nsomehow not so certain, and fell instinctively into an attitude of\n\nguard.\n\n\n\n\"There is a point I wish to touch upon,\" he began.  \"I purposely\n\nleft it before upon one side, which need be now no longer\n\nnecessary.  This is not, of course, a part of your examination,\n\nwhich is to follow by another hand; this is a private interest of\n\nmy own.  You say you encountered Alan Breck upon the hill?\"\n\n\n\n\"I did, my lord,\" said I\n\n\n\n\"This was immediately after the murder?\"\n\n\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you speak to him?\"\n\n\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\n\n\"You had known him before, I think?\" says my lord, carelessly.\n\n\n\n\"I cannot guess your reason for so thinking, my lord,\" I replied,\n\n\"but such in the fact.\"\n\n\n\n\"And when did you part with him again?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I reserve my answer,\" said I.  \"The question will be put to me at\n\nthe assize.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Balfour,\" said he, \"will you not understand that all this is\n\nwithout prejudice to yourself?  I have promised you life and\n\nhonour; and, believe me, I can keep my word.  You are therefore\n\nclear of all anxiety.  Alan, it appears, you suppose you can\n\nprotect; and you talk to me of your gratitude, which I think (if\n\nyou push me) is not ill-deserved.  There are a great many different\n\nconsiderations all pointing the same way; and I will never be\n\npersuaded that you could not help us (if you chose) to put salt on\n\nAlan's tail.\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord,\" said I, \"I give you my word I do not so much as guess\n\nwhere Alan is.\"\n\n\n\nHe paused a breath.  \"Nor how he might be found?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nI sat before him like a log of wood.\n\n\n\n\"And so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!\" he observed.  Again\n\nthere was a piece of silence.  \"Well,\" said he, rising, \"I am not\n\nfortunate, and we are a couple at cross purposes.  Let us speak of\n\nit no more; you will receive notice when, where, and by whom, we\n\nare to take your precognition.  And in the meantime, my misses must\n\nbe waiting you.  They will never forgive me if I detain their\n\ncavalier.\"\n\n\n\nInto the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered up, and\n\nfound them dressed beyond what I had thought possible, and looking\n\nfair as a posy.\n\n\n\nAs we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which\n\ncame afterwards to look extremely big.  I heard a whistle sound\n\nloud and brief like a signal, and looking all about, spied for one\n\nmoment the red head of Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan.  The\n\nnext moment he was gone again, nor could I see so much as the\n\nskirt-tail of Catriona, upon whom I naturally supposed him to be\n\nthen attending.\n\n\n\nMy three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield Links;\n\nwhence a path carried us to Hope Park, a beautiful pleasance, laid\n\nwith gravel-walks, furnished with seats and summer-sheds, and\n\nwarded by a keeper.  The way there was a little longsome; the two\n\nyounger misses affected an air of genteel weariness that damped me\n\ncruelly, the eldest considered me with something that at times\n\nappeared like mirth; and though I thought I did myself more justice\n\nthan the day before, it was not without some effort.  Upon our\n\nreaching the park I was launched on a bevy of eight or ten young\n\ngentlemen (some of them cockaded officers, the rest chiefly\n\nadvocates) who crowded to attend upon these beauties; and though I\n\nwas presented to all of them in very good words, it seemed I was by\n\nall immediately forgotten.  Young folk in a company are like to\n\nsavage animals:  they fall upon or scorn a stranger without\n\ncivility, or I may say, humanity; and I am sure, if I had been\n\namong baboons, they would have shown me quite as much of both.\n\nSome of the advocates set up to be wits, and some of the soldiers\n\nto be rattles; and I could not tell which of these extremes annoyed\n\nme most.  All had a manner of handling their swords and coat-\n\nskirts, for the which (in mere black envy) I could have kicked them\n\nfrom the park.  I daresay, upon their side, they grudged me\n\nextremely the fine company in which I had arrived; and altogether I\n\nhad soon fallen behind, and stepped stiffly in the rear of all that\n\nmerriment with my own thoughts.\n\n\n\nFrom these I was recalled by one of the officers, Lieutenant Hector\n\nDuncansby, a gawky, leering Highland boy, asking if my name was not\n\n\"Palfour.\"\n\n\n\nI told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was scant civil.\n\n\n\n\"Ha, Palfour,\" says he, and then, repeating it, \"Palfour, Palfour!\"\n\n\n\n\"I am afraid you do not like my name, sir,\" says I, annoyed with\n\nmyself to be annoyed with such a rustical fellow.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" says he, \"but I wass thinking.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would not advise you to make a practice of that, sir,\" says I.\n\n\"I feel sure you would not find it to agree with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?\" said he.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he could possibly mean, and he answered, with a\n\nheckling laugh, that he thought I must have found the poker in the\n\nsame place and swallowed it.\n\n\n\nThere could be no mistake about this, and my cheek burned.\n\n\n\n\"Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,\" said I, \"I\n\nthink I would learn the English language first.\"\n\n\n\nHe took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly\n\noutside Hope Park.  But no sooner were we beyond the view of the\n\npromenaders, than the fashion of his countenance changed.  \"You tam\n\nlowland scoon'rel!\" cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with\n\nhis closed fist.\n\n\n\nI paid him as good or better on the return; whereupon he stepped a\n\nlittle back and took off his hat to me decorously.\n\n\n\n\"Enough plows I think,\" says he.  \"I will be the offended\n\nshentleman, for who effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a\n\nshentlemans that is the king's officer he cannae speak Cot's\n\nEnglish?  We have swords at our hurdles, and here is the King's\n\nPark at hand.  Will ye walk first, or let me show ye the way?\"\n\n\n\nI returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed him.  As he\n\nwent I heard him grumble to himself about COT'S ENGLISH and the\n\nKING'S COAT, so that I might have supposed him to be seriously\n\noffended.  But his manner at the beginning of our interview was\n\nthere to belie him.  It was manifest he had come prepared to fasten\n\na quarrel on me, right or wrong; manifest that I was taken in a\n\nfresh contrivance of my enemies; and to me (conscious as I was of\n\nmy deficiencies) manifest enough that I should be the one to fall\n\nin our encounter.\n\n\n\nAs we came into that rough rocky desert of the King's Park I was\n\ntempted half-a-dozen times to take to my heels and run for it, so\n\nloath was I to show my ignorance in fencing, and so much averse to\n\ndie or even to be wounded.  But I considered if their malice went\n\nas far as this, it would likely stick at nothing; and that to fall\n\nby the sword, however ungracefully, was still an improvement on the\n\ngallows.  I considered besides that by the unguarded pertness of my\n\nwords and the quickness of my blow I had put myself quite out of\n\ncourt; and that even if I ran, my adversary would probably pursue\n\nand catch me, which would add disgrace to my misfortune.  So that,\n\ntaking all in all, I continued marching behind him, much as a man\n\nfollows the hangman, and certainly with no more hope.\n\n\n\nWe went about the end of the long craigs, and came into the\n\nHunter's Bog.  Here, on a piece of fair turf, my adversary drew.\n\nThere was nobody there to see us but some birds; and no resource\n\nfor me but to follow his example, and stand on guard with the best\n\nface I could display.  It seems it was not good enough for Mr.\n\nDancansby, who spied some flaw in my manoeuvres, paused, looked\n\nupon me sharply, and came off and on, and menaced me with his blade\n\nin the air.  As I had seen no such proceedings from Alan, and was\n\nbesides a good deal affected with the proximity of death, I grew\n\nquite bewildered, stood helpless, and could have longed to run\n\naway.\n\n\n\n\"Fat deil ails her?\" cries the lieutenant.\n\n\n\nAnd suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out of my grasp and\n\nsent it flying far among the rushes.\n\n\n\nTwice was this manoeuvre repeated; and the third time when I\n\nbrought back my humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own\n\nto the scabbard, and stood awaiting me with a face of some anger,\n\nand his hands clasped under his skirt.\n\n\n\n\"Pe tamned if I touch you!\" he cried, and asked me bitterly what\n\nright I had to stand up before \"shentlemans\" when I did not know\n\nthe back of a sword from the front of it.\n\n\n\nI answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and would he do me\n\nthe justice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was\n\nunfortunately in my power to offer, and had stood up like a man?\n\n\n\n\"And that is the truth,\" said he.  \"I am fery prave myself, and\n\npold as a lions.  But to stand up there--and you ken naething of\n\nfence!--the way that you did, I declare it was peyond me.  And I am\n\nsorry for the plow; though I declare I pelief your own was the\n\nelder brother, and my heid still sings with it.  And I declare if I\n\nhad kent what way it wass, I would not put a hand to such a piece\n\nof pusiness.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is handsomely said,\" I replied, \"and I am sure you will not\n\nstand up a second time to be the actor for my private enemies.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, no, Palfour,\" said he; \"and I think I was used extremely\n\nsuffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife, or\n\nall the same as a bairn whateffer!  And I will tell the Master so,\n\nand fecht him, by Cot, himself!\"\n\n\n\n\"And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon's quarrel with me,\" said\n\nI, \"you would be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such\n\naffairs.\"\n\n\n\nHe swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats were made of\n\nthe same meal and the devil was the miller that ground that; then\n\nsuddenly shaking me by the hand, he vowed I was a pretty enough\n\nfellow after all, that it was a thousand pities I had been\n\nneglected, and that if he could find the time, he would give an eye\n\nhimself to have me educated.\n\n\n\n\"You can do me a better service than even what you propose,\" said\n\nI; and when he had asked its nature--\"Come with me to the house of\n\none of my enemies, and testify how I have carried myself this day,\"\n\nI told him.  \"That will be the true service.  For though he has\n\nsent me a gallant adversary for the first, the thought in Mr.\n\nSimon's mind is merely murder.  There will be a second and then a\n\nthird; and by what you have seen of my cleverness with the cold\n\nsteel, you can judge for yourself what is like to be the upshot.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I would not like it myself, if I was no more of a man than\n\nwhat you wass!\" he cried.  \"But I will do you right, Palfour.  Lead\n\non!\"\n\n\n\nIf I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels\n\nwere light enough on the way out.  They kept time to a very good\n\nold air, that is as ancient as the Bible, and the words of it are:\n\n\"SURELY THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH IS PASSED.\"  I mind that I was\n\nextremely thirsty, and had a drink at Saint Margaret's well on the\n\nroad down, and the sweetness of that water passed belief.  We went\n\nthrough the sanctuary, up the Canongate, in by the Netherbow, and\n\nstraight to Prestongrange's door, talking as we came and arranging\n\nthe details of our affair.  The footman owned his master was at\n\nhome, but declared him engaged with other gentlemen on very private\n\nbusiness, and his door forbidden.\n\n\n\n\"My business is but for three minutes, and it cannot wait,\" said I.\n\n\"You may say it is by no means private, and I shall be even glad to\n\nhave some witnesses.\"\n\n\n\nAs the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand, we made so\n\nbold as to follow him to the ante-chamber, whence I could hear for\n\na while the murmuring of several voices in the room within.  The\n\ntruth is, they were three at the one table--Prestongrange, Simon\n\nFraser, and Mr. Erskine, Sheriff of Perth; and as they were met in\n\nconsultation on the very business of the Appin murder, they were a\n\nlittle disturbed at my appearance, but decided to receive me.\n\n\n\n\"Well, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here again? and who\n\nis this you bring with you?\" says Prestongrange.\n\n\n\nAs for Fraser, he looked before him on the table.\n\n\n\n\"He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour, my lord, which\n\nI think it very needful you should hear,\" said I, and turned to\n\nDuncansby.\n\n\n\n\"I have only to say this,\" said the lieutenant, \"that I stood up\n\nthis day with Palfour in the Hunter's Pog, which I am now fery\n\nsorry for, and he behaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could\n\nask it.  And I have creat respects for Palfour,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\"I thank you for your honest expressions,\" said I.\n\n\n\nWhereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company, and left the\n\nchamber, as we had agreed upon before.\n\n\n\n\"What have I to do with this?\" says Prestongrange.\n\n\n\n\"I will tell your lordship in two words,\" said I.  \"I have brought\n\nthis gentleman, a King's officer, to do me so much justice.  Now I\n\nthink my character in covered, and until a certain date, which your\n\nlordship can very well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch\n\nagainst me any more officers.  I will not consent to fight my way\n\nthrough the garrison of the castle.\"\n\n\n\nThe veins swelled on Prestongrange's brow, and he regarded me with\n\nfury.\n\n\n\n\"I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs!\" he\n\ncried; and then, turning fiercely on his neighbour, \"This is some\n\nof your work, Simon,\" he said.  \"I spy your hand in the business,\n\nand, let me tell you, I resent it.  It is disloyal, when we are\n\nagreed upon one expedient, to follow another in the dark.  You are\n\ndisloyal to me.  What! you let me send this lad to the place with\n\nmy very daughters!  And because I let drop a word to you..... Fy,\n\nsir, keep your dishonours to yourself!\"\n\n\n\nSimon was deadly pale.  \"I will be a kick-ball between you and the\n\nDuke no longer,\" he exclaimed.  \"Either come to an agreement, or\n\ncome to a differ, and have it out among yourselves.  But I will no\n\nlonger fetch and carry, and get your contrary instructions, and be\n\nblamed by both.  For if I were to tell you what I think of all your\n\nHanover business it would make your head sing.\"\n\n\n\nBut Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and now intervened\n\nsmoothly.  \"And in the meantime,\" says he, \"I think we should tell\n\nMr. Balfour that his character for valour is quite established.  He\n\nmay sleep in peace.  Until the date he was so good as to refer to\n\nit shall be put to the proof no more.\"\n\n\n\nHis coolness brought the others to their prudence; and they made\n\nhaste, with a somewhat distracted civility, to pack me from the\n\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE HEATHER ON FIRE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first time\n\nangry.  The Advocate had made a mock of me.  He had pretended my\n\ntestimony was to be received and myself respected; and in that very\n\nhour, not only was Simon practising against my life by the hands of\n\nthe Highland soldier, but (as appeared from his own language)\n\nPrestongrange himself had some design in operation.  I counted my\n\nenemies; Prestongrange with all the King's authority behind him;\n\nand the Duke with the power of the West Highlands; and the Lovat\n\ninterest by their side to help them with so great a force in the\n\nnorth, and the whole clan of old Jacobite spies and traffickers.\n\nAnd when I remembered James More, and the red head of Neil the son\n\nof Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the confederacy,\n\nand what remained of Rob Roy's old desperate sept of caterans would\n\nbe banded against me with the others.  One thing was requisite--\n\nsome strong friend or wise adviser.  The country must be full of\n\nsuch, both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and the Duke and\n\nPrestongrange had not been nosing for expedients; and it made me\n\nrage to think that I might brush against my champions in the street\n\nand be no wiser.\n\n\n\nAnd just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me going\n\nby, gave me a meaning look, and turned into a close.  I knew him\n\nwith the tail of my eye--it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing\n\nmy good fortune, turned in to follow him.  As soon as I had entered\n\nthe close I saw him standing in the mouth of a stair, where he made\n\nme a signal and immediately vanished.  Seven storeys up, there he\n\nwas again in a house door, the which he looked behind us after we\n\nhad entered.  The house was quite dismantled, with not a stick of\n\nfurniture; indeed, it was one of which Stewart had the letting in\n\nhis hands.\n\n\n\n\"We'll have to sit upon the floor,\" said he; \"but we're safe here\n\nfor the time being, and I've been wearying to see ye, Mr. Balfour.\"\n\n\n\n\"How's it with Alan?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Brawly,\" said he.  \"Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow,\n\nWednesday.  He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that\n\nthings were going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best\n\napart.  And that brings me to the essential:  how does your\n\nbusiness speed?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why,\" said I, \"I was told only this morning that my testimony was\n\naccepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate, no\n\nless.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hout awa!\" cried Stewart.  \"I'll never believe that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have maybe a suspicion of my own,\" says I, \"but I would like\n\nfine to hear your reasons.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I tell ye fairly, I'm horn-mad,\" cries Stewart.  \"If my one\n\nhand could pull their Government down I would pluck it like a\n\nrotten apple.  I'm doer for Appin and for James of the Glens; and,\n\nof course, it's my duty to defend my kinsman for his life.  Hear\n\nhow it goes with me, and I'll leave the judgment of it to yourself.\n\nThe first thing they have to do is to get rid of Alan.  They cannae\n\nbring in James as art and part until they've brought in Alan first\n\nas principal; that's sound law:  they could never put the cart\n\nbefore the horse.\"\n\n\n\n\"And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?\" says\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,\" said he.  \"Sound\n\nlaw, too.  It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-\n\ndoer another was to go scatheless, and the remeid is to summon the\n\nprincipal and put him to outlawry for the non-compearance.  Now\n\nthere's four places where a person can be summoned:  at his\n\ndwelling-house; at a place where he has resided forty days; at the\n\nhead burgh of the shire where he ordinarily resorts; or lastly (if\n\nthere be ground to think him forth of Scotland) AT THE CROSS OF\n\nEDINBURGH, AND THE PIER AND SHORE OF LEITH, FOR SIXTY DAYS.  The\n\npurpose of which last provision is evident upon its face:  being\n\nthat outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the transaction,\n\nand the summonsing be something other than a form.  Now take the\n\ncase of Alan.  He has no dwelling-house that ever I could hear of;\n\nI would be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty\n\ndays together since the '45; there is no shire where he resorts\n\nwhether ordinarily or extraordinarily; if he has a domicile at all,\n\nwhich I misdoubt, it must be with his regiment in France; and if he\n\nis not yet forth of Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen\n\nto guess) it must be evident to the most dull it's what he's aiming\n\nfor.  Where, then, and what way should he be summoned?  I ask it at\n\nyourself, a layman.\"\n\n\n\n\"You have given the very words,\" said I.  \"Here at the cross, and\n\nat the pier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye're a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!\" cries the\n\nWriter.  \"He has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-\n\nfifth, the day that we first met.  Once, and done with it.  And\n\nwhere?  Where, but at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the\n\nCampbells?  A word in your ear, Mr. Balfour--they're not seeking\n\nAlan.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I cried.  \"Not seeking him?\"\n\n\n\n\"By the best that I can make of it,\" said he.  \"Not wanting to find\n\nhim, in my poor thought.  They think perhaps he might set up a fair\n\ndefence, upon the back of which James, the man they're really\n\nafter, might climb out.  This is not a case, ye see, it's a\n\nconspiracy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly,\" said I;\n\n\"though, when I come to think of it, he was something of the\n\neasiest put by.\"\n\n\n\n\"See that!\" says he.  \"But there!  I may be right or wrong, that's\n\nguesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again.  It comes\n\nto my ears that James and the witnesses--the witnesses, Mr.\n\nBalfour!--lay in close dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the\n\nmilitary prison at Fort William; none allowed in to them, nor they\n\nto write.  The witnesses, Mr. Balfour; heard ye ever the match of\n\nthat?  I assure ye, no old, crooked Stewart of the gang ever out-\n\nfaced the law more impudently.  It's clean in the two eyes of the\n\nAct of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous imprisonment.  No sooner\n\ndid I get the news than I petitioned the Lord Justice Clerk.  I\n\nhave his word to-day.  There's law for ye! here's justice!\"\n\n\n\nHe put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced\n\npaper that was printed since in the pamphlet \"by a bystander,\" for\n\nbehoof (as the title says) of James's \"poor widow and five\n\nchildren.\"\n\n\n\n\"See,\" said Stewart, \"he couldn't dare to refuse me access to my\n\nclient, so he RECOMMENDS THE COMMANDING OFFICER TO LET ME IN.\n\nRecommends!--the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends.  Is not\n\nthe purpose of such language plain?  They hope the officer may be\n\nso dull, or so very much the reverse, as to refuse the\n\nrecommendation.  I would have to make the journey back again\n\nbetwixt here and Fort William.  Then would follow a fresh delay\n\ntill I got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the officer--\n\nmilitary man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that--I ken the\n\ncant of it.  Then the journey a third time; and there we should be\n\non the immediate heels of the trial before I had received my first\n\ninstruction.  Am I not right to call this a conspiracy?\"\n\n\n\n\"It will bear that colour,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And I'll go on to prove it you outright,\" said he.  \"They have the\n\nright to hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to visit\n\nhim.  They have no right to hold the witnesses; but am I to get a\n\nsight of them, that should be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk\n\nhimself!  See--read:  FOR THE REST, REFUSES TO GIVE ANY ORDERS TO\n\nKEEPERS OF PRISONS WHO ARE NOT ACCUSED AS HAVING DONE ANYTHING\n\nCONTRARY TO THE DUTIES OF THEIR OFFICE.  Anything contrary!  Sirs!\n\nAnd the Act of seventeen hunner?  Mr. Balfour, this makes my heart\n\nto burst; the heather is on fire inside my wame.\"\n\n\n\n\"And the plain English of that phrase,\" said I, \"is that the\n\nwitnesses are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?\"\n\n\n\n\"And I am not to see them until Inverary, when the court is set!\"\n\ncries he, \"and then to hear Prestongrange upon THE ANXIOUS\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF HIS OFFICE AND THE GREAT FACILITIES AFFORDED\n\nTHE DEFENCE!  But I'll begowk them there, Mr. David.  I have a plan\n\nto waylay the witnesses upon the road, and see if I cannae get I a\n\nlittle harle of justice out of the MILITARY MAN NOTORIOUSLY\n\nIGNORANT OF THE LAW that shall command the party.\"\n\n\n\nIt was actually so--it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum,\n\nand by the connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first\n\nsaw the witnesses upon the case.\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing that would surprise me in this business,\" I\n\nremarked.\n\n\n\n\"I'll surprise you ere I'm done!\" cries he.  \"Do ye see this?\"--\n\nproducing a print still wet from the press.  \"This is the libel:\n\nsee, there's Prestongrange's name to the list of witnesses, and I\n\nfind no word of any Balfour.  But here is not the question.  Who do\n\nye think paid for the printing of this paper?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose it would likely be King George,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"But it happens it was me!\" he cried.  \"Not but it was printed by\n\nand for themselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon thief\n\nof the black midnight, Simon Fraser.  But could _I_ win to get a\n\ncopy!  No!  I was to go blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the\n\ncharges for the first time in court alongst the jury.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is not this against the law?\" I asked\n\n\n\n\"I cannot say so much,\" he replied.  \"It was a favour so natural\n\nand so constantly rendered (till this nonesuch business) that the\n\nlaw has never looked to it.  And now admire the hand of Providence!\n\nA stranger is in Fleming's printing house, spies a proof on the\n\nfloor, picks it up, and carries it to me.  Of all things, it was\n\njust this libel.  Whereupon I had it set again--printed at the\n\nexpense of the defence:  sumptibus moesti rei; heard ever man the\n\nlike of it?--and here it is for anybody, the muckle secret out--all\n\nmay see it now.  But how do you think I would enjoy this, that has\n\nthe life of my kinsman on my conscience?\"\n\n\n\n\"Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And now you see how it is,\" he concluded, \"and why, when you tell\n\nme your evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face.\"\n\n\n\nIt was now my turn.  I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon's threats\n\nand offers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the\n\nsubsequent scene at Prestongrange's.  Of my first talk, according\n\nto promise, I said nothing, nor indeed was it necessary.  All the\n\ntime I was talking Stewart nodded his head like a mechanical\n\nfigure; and no sooner had my voice ceased, than he opened his mouth\n\nand gave me his opinion in two words, dwelling strong on both of\n\nthem.\n\n\n\n\"Disappear yourself,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I do not take you,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Then I'll carry you there,\" said he.  \"By my view of it you're to\n\ndisappear whatever.  O, that's outside debate.  The Advocate, who\n\nis not without some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung your\n\nlife-safe out of Simon and the Duke.  He has refused to put you on\n\nyour trial, and refused to have you killed; and there is the clue\n\nto their ill words together, for Simon and the Duke can keep faith\n\nwith neither friend nor enemy.  Ye're not to be tried then, and\n\nye're not to be murdered; but I'm in bitter error if ye're not to\n\nbe kidnapped and carried away like the Lady Grange.  Bet me what ye\n\nplease--there was their EXPEDIENT!\"\n\n\n\n\"You make me think,\" said I, and told him of the whistle and the\n\nred-headed retainer, Neil.\n\n\n\n\"Wherever James More is there's one big rogue, never be deceived on\n\nthat,\" said he.  \"His father was none so ill a man, though a\n\nkenning on the wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family,\n\nthat I should waste my breath to be defending him!  But as for\n\nJames he's a brock and a blagyard.  I like the appearance of this\n\nred-headed Neil as little as yourself.  It looks uncanny:  fiegh!\n\nit smells bad.  It was old Lovat that managed the Lady Grange\n\naffair; if young Lovat is to handle yours, it'll be all in the\n\nfamily.  What's James More in prison for?  The same offence:\n\nabduction.  His men have had practice in the business.  He'll be to\n\nlend them to be Simon's instruments; and the next thing we'll be\n\nhearing, James will have made his peace, or else he'll have\n\nescaped; and you'll be in Benbecula or Applecross.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye make a strong case,\" I admitted.\n\n\n\n\"And what I want,\" he resumed, \"is that you should disappear\n\nyourself ere they can get their hands upon ye.  Lie quiet until\n\njust before the trial, and spring upon them at the last of it when\n\nthey'll be looking for you least.  This is always supposing Mr.\n\nBalfour, that your evidence is worth so very great a measure of\n\nboth risk and fash.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will tell you one thing,\" said I.  \"I saw the murderer and it\n\nwas not Alan.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then, by God, my cousin's saved!\" cried Stewart.  \"You have his\n\nlife upon your tongue; and there's neither time, risk, nor money to\n\nbe spared to bring you to the trial.\"  He emptied his pockets on\n\nthe floor.  \"Here is all that I have by me,\" he went on, \"Take it,\n\nye'll want it ere ye're through.  Go straight down this close,\n\nthere's a way out by there to the Lang Dykes, and by my will of it!\n\nsee no more of Edinburgh till the clash is over.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where am I to go, then?\" I inquired.\n\n\n\n\"And I wish that I could tell ye!\" says he, \"but all the places\n\nthat I could send ye to, would be just the places they would seek.\n\nNo, ye must fend for yourself, and God be your guiding!  Five days\n\nbefore the trial, September the sixteen, get word to me at the King\n\nArms in Stirling; and if ye've managed for yourself as long as\n\nthat, I'll see that ye reach Inverary.\"\n\n\n\n\"One thing more,\" said I.  \"Can I no see Alan?\"\n\n\n\nHe seemed boggled.  \"Hech, I would rather you wouldnae,\" said he.\n\n\"But I can never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and is to\n\nlie this night by Silvermills on purpose.  If you're sure that\n\nyou're not followed, Mr. Balfour--but make sure of that--lie in a\n\ngood place and watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it.\n\nIt would be a dreadful business if both you and him was to\n\nmiscarry!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE RED-HEADED MAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang Dykes.\n\nDean was where I wanted to go.  Since Catriona dwelled there, and\n\nher kinsfolk the Glengyle Macgregors appeared almost certainly to\n\nbe employed against me, it was just one of the few places I should\n\nhave kept away from; and being a very young man, and beginning to\n\nbe very much in love, I turned my face in that direction without\n\npause.  As a slave to my conscience and common sense, however, I\n\ntook a measure of precaution.  Coming over the crown of a bit of a\n\nrise in the road, I clapped down suddenly among the barley and lay\n\nwaiting.  After a while, a man went by that looked to be a\n\nHighlandman, but I had never seen him till that hour.  Presently\n\nafter came Neil of the red head.  The next to go past was a\n\nmiller's cart, and after that nothing but manifest country people.\n\nHere was enough to have turned the most foolhardy from his purpose,\n\nbut my inclination ran too strong the other way.  I argued it out\n\nthat if Neil was on that road, it was the right road to find him\n\nin, leading direct to his chief's daughter; as for the other\n\nHighlandman, if I was to be startled off by every Highlandman I\n\nsaw, I would scarce reach anywhere.  And having quite satisfied\n\nmyself with this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed of\n\nit, and came a little after four to Mrs. Drumond-Ogilvy's.\n\n\n\nBoth ladies were within the house; and upon my perceiving them\n\ntogether by the open door, I plucked off my hat and said, \"Here was\n\na lad come seeking saxpence,\" which I thought might please the\n\ndowager.\n\n\n\nCatriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise, the old\n\nlady seemed scarce less forward than herself.  I learned long\n\nafterwards that she had despatched a horseman by daylight to\n\nRankeillor at the Queensferry, whom she knew to be the doer for\n\nShaws, and had then in her pocket a letter from that good friend of\n\nmine, presenting, in the most favourable view, my character and\n\nprospects.  But had I read it I could scarce have seen more clear\n\nin her designs.  Maybe I was COUNTRYFEED; at least, I was not so\n\nmuch so as she thought; and it was even to my homespun wits, that\n\nshe was bent to hammer up a match between her cousin and a\n\nbeardless boy that was something of a laird in Lothian.\n\n\n\n\"Saxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,\" says she.\n\n\"Run and tell the lasses.\"\n\n\n\nAnd for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains\n\nto flatter me; always cleverly, always with the appearance of a\n\nbanter, still calling me Saxpence, but with such a turn that should\n\nrather uplift me in my own opinion.  When Catriona returned, the\n\ndesign became if possible more obvious; and she showed off the\n\ngirl's advantages like a horse-couper with a horse.  My face flamed\n\nthat she should think me so obtuse.  Now I would fancy the girl was\n\nbeing innocently made a show of, and then I could have beaten the\n\nold carline wife with a cudgel; and now, that perhaps these two had\n\nset their heads together to entrap me, and at that I sat and\n\ngloomed betwixt them like the very image of ill-will.  At last the\n\nmatchmaker had a better device, which was to leave the pair of us\n\nalone.  When my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a\n\nlittle the wrong side of easy to allay them.  But though I knew\n\nwhat breed she was of, and that was a breed of thieves, I could\n\nnever look in Catriona's face and disbelieve her.\n\n\n\n\"I must not ask?\" says she, eagerly, the same moment we were left\n\nalone.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,\" I replied.  \"I\n\nam lightened of my pledge, and indeed (after what has come and gone\n\nsince morning) I would not have renewed it were it asked.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tell me,\" she said.  \"My cousin will not be so long.\"\n\n\n\nSo I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the\n\nlast of it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there\n\nwas matter of mirth in that absurdity.\n\n\n\n\"And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for\n\nthe pretty ladies, after all!\" says she, when I had done.  \"But\n\nwhat was your father that he could not learn you to draw the sword!\n\nIt is most ungentle; I have not heard the match of that in anyone.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is most misconvenient at least,\" said I; \"and I think my father\n\n(honest man!) must have been wool-gathering to learn me Latin in\n\nthe place of it.  But you see I do the best I can, and just stand\n\nup like Lot's wife and let them hammer at me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what makes me smile?\" said she.  \"Well, it is this.  I\n\nam made this way, that I should have been a man child.  In my own\n\nthoughts it is so I am always; and I go on telling myself about\n\nthis thing that is to befall and that.  Then it comes to the place\n\nof the fighting, and it comes over me that I am only a girl at all\n\nevents, and cannot hold a sword or give one good blow; and then I\n\nhave to twist my story round about, so that the fighting is to\n\nstop, and yet me have the best of it, just like you and the\n\nlieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine speeches all\n\nthrough, like Mr. David Balfour.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are a bloodthirsty maid,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make samplers,\"\n\nshe said, \"but if you were to do nothing else in the great world, I\n\nthink you will say yourself it is a driech business; and it is not\n\nthat I want to kill, I think.  Did ever you kill anyone?\"\n\n\n\n\"That I have, as it chances.  Two, no less, and me still a lad that\n\nshould be at the college,\" said I.  \"But yet, in the look-back, I\n\ntake no shame for it.\"\n\n\n\n\"But how did you feel, then--after it?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n'\"Deed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I know that, too,\" she cried.  \"I feel where these tears should\n\ncome from.  And at any rate, I would not wish to kill, only to be\n\nCatherine Douglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt,\n\nwhere it was broken.  That is my chief hero.  Would you not love to\n\ndie so--for your king?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"Troth,\" said I, \"my affection for my king, God bless the puggy\n\nface of him, is under more control; and I thought I saw death so\n\nnear to me this day already, that I am rather taken up with the\n\nnotion of living.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right,\" she said, \"the right mind of a man!  Only you must learn\n\narms; I would not like to have a friend that cannot strike.  But it\n\nwill not have been with the sword that you killed these two?\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" said I, \"but with a pair of pistols.  And a fortunate\n\nthing it was the men were so near-hand to me, for I am about as\n\nclever with the pistols as I am with the sword.\"\n\n\n\nSo then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig, which\n\nI had omitted in my first account of my affairs.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"you are brave.  And your friend, I admire and\n\nlove him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I think anyone would!\" said I.  \"He has his faults like\n\nother folk; but he is brave and staunch and kind, God bless him!\n\nThat will be a strange day when I forget Alan.\"  And the thought of\n\nhim, and that it was within my choice to speak with him that night,\n\nhad almost overcome me.\n\n\n\n\"And where will my head be gone that I have not told my news!\" she\n\ncried, and spoke of a letter from her father, bearing that she\n\nmight visit him to-morrow in the castle whither he was now\n\ntransferred, and that his affairs were mending.  \"You do not like\n\nto hear it,\" said she.  \"Will you judge my father and not know\n\nhim?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am a thousand miles from judging,\" I replied.  \"And I give you\n\nmy word I do rejoice to know your heart is lightened.  If my face\n\nfell at all, as I suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an\n\nill day for compositions, and the people in power extremely ill\n\npersons to be compounding with.  I have Simon Fraser extremely\n\nheavy on my stomach still.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried, \"you will not be evening these two; and you should\n\nbear in mind that Prestongrange and James More, my father, are of\n\nthe one blood.\"\n\n\n\n\"I never heard tell of that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"It is rather singular how little you are acquainted with,\" said\n\nshe.  \"One part may call themselves Grant, and one Macgregor, but\n\nthey are still of the same clan.  They are all the sons of Alpin,\n\nfrom whom, I think, our country has its name.\"\n\n\n\n\"What country is that?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"My country and yours,\" said she\n\n\n\n\"This is my day for discovering I think,\" said I, \"for I always\n\nthought the name of it was Scotland.\"\n\n\n\n\"Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland,\" she replied.  \"But\n\nthe old ancient true name of this place that we have our foot-soles\n\non, and that our bones are made of, will be Alban.  It was Alban\n\nthey called it when our forefathers will be fighting for it against\n\nRome and Alexander; and it is called so still in your own tongue\n\nthat you forget.\"\n\n\n\n\"Troth,\" said I, \"and that I never learned!\"  For I lacked heart to\n\ntake her up about the Macedonian.\n\n\n\n\"But your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation with\n\nanother,\" said she.  \"And it was sung about the cradles before you\n\nor me were ever dreamed of; and your name remembers it still.  Ah,\n\nif you could talk that language you would find me another girl.\n\nThe heart speaks in that tongue.\"\n\n\n\nI had a meal with the two ladies, all very good, served in fine old\n\nplate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that Mrs. Ogilvy was\n\nrich.  Our talk, too, was pleasant enough; but as soon as I saw the\n\nsun decline sharply and the shadows to run out long, I rose to take\n\nmy leave.  For my mind was now made up to say farewell to Alan; and\n\nit was needful I should see the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it,\n\nby daylight.  Catriona came with me as far as to the garden gate.\n\n\n\n\"It is long till I see you now?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"It is beyond my judging,\" I replied.  \"It will be long, it may be\n\nnever.\"\n\n\n\n\"It may be so,\" said she.  \"And you are sorry?\"\n\n\n\nI bowed my head, looking upon her.\n\n\n\n\"So am I, at all events,\" said she.  \"I have seen you but a small\n\ntime, but I put you very high.  You are true, you are brave; in\n\ntime I think you will be more of a man yet.  I will be proud to\n\nhear of that.  If you should speed worse, if it will come to fall\n\nas we are afraid--O well! think you have the one friend.  Long\n\nafter you are dead and me an old wife, I will be telling the bairns\n\nabout David Balfour, and my tears running.  I will be telling how\n\nwe parted, and what I said to you, and did to you.  GOD GO WITH YOU\n\nAND GUIDE YOU, PRAYS YOUR LITTLE FRIEND:  so I said--I will be\n\ntelling them--and here is what I did.\"\n\n\n\nShe took up my hand and kissed it.  This so surprised my spirits\n\nthat I cried out like one hurt.  The colour came strong in her\n\nface, and she looked at me and nodded.\n\n\n\n\"O yes, Mr. David,\" said she, \"that is what I think of you.  The\n\nhead goes with the lips.\"\n\n\n\nI could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave\n\nchild's; not anything besides.  She kissed my hand, as she had\n\nkissed Prince Charlie's, with a higher passion than the common kind\n\nof clay has any sense of.  Nothing before had taught me how deep I\n\nwas her lover, nor how far I had yet to climb to make her think of\n\nme in such a character.  Yet I could tell myself I had advanced\n\nsome way, and that her heart had beat and her blood flowed at\n\nthoughts of me.\n\n\n\nAfter that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial\n\ncivility.  It was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in\n\nher voice had knocked directly at the door of my own tears.\n\n\n\n\"I praise God for your kindness, dear,\" said I.  \"Farewell, my\n\nlittle friend!\" giving her that name which she had given to\n\nherself; with which I bowed and left her.\n\n\n\nMy way was down the glen of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge\n\nand Silvermills.  A path led in the foot of it, the water bickered\n\nand sang in the midst; the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west\n\namong long shadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene\n\nand a new world of it at every corner.  With Catriona behind and\n\nAlan before me, I was like one lifted up.  The place besides, and\n\nthe hour, and the talking of the water, infinitely pleased me; and\n\nI lingered in my steps and looked before and behind me as I went.\n\nThis was the cause, under Providence, that I spied a little in my\n\nrear a red head among some bushes.\n\n\n\nAnger sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about and walked at\n\na stiff pace to where I came from.  The path lay close by the\n\nbushes where I had remarked the head.  The cover came to the\n\nwayside, and as I passed I was all strung up to meet and to resist\n\nan onfall.  No such thing befell, I went by unmeddled with; and at\n\nthat fear increased upon me.  It was still day indeed, but the\n\nplace exceeding solitary.  If my haunters had let slip that fair\n\noccasion I could but judge they aimed at something more than David\n\nBalfour.  The lives of Alan and James weighed upon my spirit with\n\nthe weight of two grown bullocks.\n\n\n\nCatriona was yet in the garden walking by herself.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"you see me back again.\"\n\n\n\n\"With a changed face,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"I carry two men's lives besides my own,\" said I.  \"It would be a\n\nsin and shame not to walk carefully.  I was doubtful whether I did\n\nright to come here.  I would like it ill, if it was by that means\n\nwe were brought to harm.\"\n\n\n\n\"I could tell you one that would be liking it less, and will like\n\nlittle enough to hear you talking at this very same time,\" she\n\ncried.  \"What have I done, at all events?\"\n\n\n\n\"O, you I you are not alone,\" I replied.  \"But since I went off I\n\nhave been dogged again, and I can give you the name of him that\n\nfollows me.  It is Neil, son of Duncan, your man or your father's.\"\n\n\n\n\"To be sure you are mistaken there,\" she said, with a white face.\n\n\"Neil is in Edinburgh on errands from my father.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is what I fear,\" said I, \"the last of it.  But for his being in\n\nEdinburgh I think I can show you another of that.  For sure you\n\nhave some signal, a signal of need, such as would bring him to your\n\nhelp, if he was anywhere within the reach of ears and legs?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, how will you know that?\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"By means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born, and\n\nthe name they call it by is Common-sense,\" said I.  \"Oblige me so\n\nfar as make your signal, and I will show you the red head of Neil.\"\n\n\n\nNo doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp.  My heart was bitter.  I\n\nblamed myself and the girl and hated both of us:  her for the vile\n\ncrew that she was come of, myself for my wanton folly to have stuck\n\nmy head in such a byke of wasps.\n\n\n\nCatriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once, with an\n\nexceeding clear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman's.\n\nA while we stood silent; and I was about to ask her to repeat the\n\nsame, when I heard the sound of some one bursting through the\n\nbushes below on the braeside.  I pointed in that direction with a\n\nsmile, and presently Neil leaped into the garden.  His eyes burned,\n\nand he had a black knife (as they call it on the Highland side)\n\nnaked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his mistress, stood like a\n\nman struck.\n\n\n\n\"He has come to your call,\" said I; \"judge how near he was to\n\nEdinburgh, or what was the nature of your father's errands.  Ask\n\nhimself.  If I am to lose my life, or the lives of those that hang\n\nby me, through the means of your clan, let me go where I have to go\n\nwith my eyes open.\"\n\n\n\nShe addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic.  Remembering Alan's\n\nanxious civility in that particular, I could have laughed out loud\n\nfor bitterness; here, sure, in the midst of these suspicions, was\n\nthe hour she should have stuck by English.\n\n\n\nTwice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make out that Neil\n\n(for all his obsequiousness) was an angry man.\n\n\n\nThen she turned to me.  \"He swears it is not,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"do you believe the man yourself?\"\n\n\n\nShe made a gesture like wringing the hands.\n\n\n\n\"How will I can know?\" she cried.\n\n\n\nBut I must find some means to know,\" said I.  \"I cannot continue to\n\ngo dovering round in the black night with two men's lives at my\n\ngirdle!  Catriona, try to put yourself in my place, as I vow to God\n\nI try hard to put myself in yours.  This is no kind of talk that\n\nshould ever have fallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my\n\nheart is sick with it.  See, keep him here till two of the morning,\n\nand I care not.  Try him with that.\"\n\n\n\nThey spoke together once more in the Gaelic.\n\n\n\n\"He says he has James More my father's errand,\" said she.  She was\n\nwhiter than ever, and her voice faltered as she said it.\n\n\n\n\"It is pretty plain now,\" said I, \"and may God forgive the wicked!\"\n\n\n\nShe said never anything to that, but continued gazing at me with\n\nthe same white face.\n\n\n\n\"This is a fine business,\" said I again.  \"Am I to fall, then, and\n\nthose two along with me?\"\n\n\n\n\"O, what am I to do?\" she cried.  \"Could I go against my father's\n\norders, him in prison, in the danger of his life!\"\n\n\n\n\"But perhaps we go too fast,\" said I.  \"This may be a lie too.  He\n\nmay have no right orders; all may be contrived by Simon, and your\n\nfather knowing nothing.\"\n\n\n\nShe burst out weeping between the pair of us; and my heart smote me\n\nhard, for I thought this girl was in a dreadful situation.\n\n\n\n\"Here,\" said I, \"keep him but the one hour; and I'll chance it, and\n\nmay God bless you.\"\n\n\n\nShe put out her hand to me, \"I will he needing one good word,\" she\n\nsobbed.\n\n\n\n\"The full hour, then?\" said I, keeping her hand in mine.  \"Three\n\nlives of it, my lass!\"\n\n\n\n\"The full hour!\" she said, and cried aloud on her Redeemer to\n\nforgive her.\n\n\n\nI thought it no fit place for me, and fled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--THE WOOD BY SILVERMILLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge and\n\nSilvermills as hard as I could stave.  It was Alan's tryst to be\n\nevery night between twelve and two \"in a bit scrog of wood by east\n\nof Silvermills and by south the south mill-lade.\"  This I found\n\neasy enough, where it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade\n\nflowing swift and deep along the foot of it; and here I began to\n\nwalk slower and to reflect more reasonably on my employment.  I saw\n\nI had made but a fool's bargain with Catriona.  It was not to be\n\nsupposed that Neil was sent alone upon his errand, but perhaps he\n\nwas the only man belonging to James More; in which case I should\n\nhave done all I could to hang Catriona's father, and nothing the\n\nleast material to help myself.  To tell the truth, I fancied\n\nneither one of these ideas.  Suppose by holding back Neil, the girl\n\nshould have helped to hang her father, I thought she would never\n\nforgive herself this side of time.  And suppose there were others\n\npursuing me that moment, what kind of a gift was I come bringing to\n\nAlan? and how would I like that?\n\n\n\nI was up with the west end of that wood when these two\n\nconsiderations struck me like a cudgel.  My feet stopped of\n\nthemselves and my heart along with them.  \"What wild game is this\n\nthat I have been playing?\" thought I; and turned instantly upon my\n\nheels to go elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThis brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village\n\nwith a crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland,\n\nthere was nobody stirring.  Here was my advantage, here was just\n\nsuch a conjuncture as Stewart had counselled me to profit by, and I\n\nran by the side of the mill-lade, fetched about beyond the east\n\ncorner of the wood, threaded through the midst of it, and returned\n\nto the west selvage, whence I could again command the path, and yet\n\nbe myself unseen.  Again it was all empty, and my heart began to\n\nrise.\n\n\n\nFor more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees, and\n\nno hare or eagle could have kept a more particular watch.  When\n\nthat hour began the sun was already set, but the sky still all\n\ngolden and the daylight clear; before the hour was done it had\n\nfallen to be half mirk, the images and distances of things were\n\nmingled, and observation began to be difficult.  All that time not\n\na foot of man had come east from Silvermills, and the few that had\n\ngone west were honest countryfolk and their wives upon the road to\n\nbed.  If I were tracked by the most cunning spies in Europe, I\n\njudged it was beyond the course of nature they could have any\n\njealousy of where I was:  and going a little further home into the\n\nwood I lay down to wait for Alan.\n\n\n\nThe strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched not\n\nthe path only, but every bush and field within my vision.  That was\n\nnow at an end.  The moon, which was in her first quarter, glinted a\n\nlittle in the wood; all round there was a stillness of the country;\n\nand as I lay there on my back, the next three or four hours, I had\n\na fine occasion to review my conduct.\n\n\n\nTwo things became plain to me first:  that I had no right to go\n\nthat day to Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to be\n\nlying where I was.  This (where Alan was to come) was just the one\n\nwood in all broad Scotland that was, by every proper feeling,\n\nclosed against me; I admitted that, and yet stayed on, wondering at\n\nmyself.  I thought of the measure with which I had meted to\n\nCatriona that same night; how I had prated of the two lives I\n\ncarried, and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her father's; and\n\nhow I was here exposing them again, it seemed in wantonness.  A\n\ngood conscience is eight parts of courage.  No sooner had I lost\n\nconceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand disarmed amidst a\n\nthrong of terrors.  Of a sudden I sat up.  How if I went now to\n\nPrestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before he\n\nslept, and made a full submission?  Who could blame me?  Not\n\nStewart the Writer; I had but to say that I was followed, despaired\n\nof getting clear, and so gave in.  Not Catriona:  here, too, I had\n\nmy answer ready; that I could not bear she should expose her\n\nfather.  So, in a moment, I could lay all these troubles by, which\n\nwere after all and truly none of mine; swim clear of the Appin\n\nMurder; get forth out of hand-stroke of all the Stewarts and\n\nCampbells, all the Whigs and Tories, in the land; and live\n\nhenceforth to my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my\n\nfortunes, and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona,\n\nwhich would be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and\n\nrun and be followed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the\n\ndreadful miseries of my escape with Alan.\n\n\n\nAt first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only amazed\n\nI had not thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and began to\n\ninquire into the causes of the change.  These I traced to my\n\nlowness of spirits, that back to my late recklessness, and that\n\nagain to the common, old, public, disconsidered sin of self-\n\nindulgence.  Instantly the text came in my head, \"HOW CAN SATAN\n\nCAST OUT SATAN?\"  What? (I thought) I had, by self-indulgence; and\n\nthe following of pleasant paths, and the lure of a young maid, cast\n\nmyself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and jeopardised\n\nthe lives of James and Alan?  And I was to seek the way out by the\n\nsame road as I had entered in?  No; the hurt that had been caused\n\nby self-indulgence must be cured by self-denial; the flesh I had\n\npampered must be crucified.  I looked about me for that course\n\nwhich I least liked to follow:  this was to leave the wood without\n\nwaiting to see Alan, and go forth again alone, in the dark and in\n\nthe midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes.\n\n\n\nI have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my\n\nreflections, because I think it is of some utility, and may serve\n\nas an example to young men.  But there is reason (they say) in\n\nplanting kale, and even in ethic and religion, room for common\n\nsense.  It was already close on Alan's hour, and the moon was down.\n\nIf I left (as I could not very decently whistle to my spies to\n\nfollow me) they might miss me in the dark and tack themselves to\n\nAlan by mistake.  If I stayed, I could at the least of it set my\n\nfriend upon his guard which might prove his mere salvation.  I had\n\nadventured other peoples' safety in a course of self-indulgence; to\n\nhave endangered them again, and now on a mere design of penance,\n\nwould have been scarce rational.  Accordingly, I had scarce risen\n\nfrom my place ere I sat down again, but already in a different\n\nframe of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness and\n\nrejoicing in my present composure.\n\n\n\nPresently after came a crackling in the thicket.  Putting my mouth\n\nnear down to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan's air;\n\nan answer came in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked\n\ntogether in the dark.\n\n\n\n\"Is this you at last, Davie?\" he whispered.\n\n\n\n\"Just myself,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"God, man, but I've been wearying to see ye!\" says he.  \"I've had\n\nthe longest kind of a time.  A' day, I've had my dwelling into the\n\ninside of a stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten\n\nfingers; and then two hours of it waiting here for you, and you\n\nnever coming!  Dod, and ye're none too soon the way it is, with me\n\nto sail the morn!  The morn? what am I saying?--the day, I mean.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, Alan, man, the day, sure enough,\" said I.  \"It's past twelve\n\nnow, surely, and ye sail the day.  This'll be a long road you have\n\nbefore you.\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll have a long crack of it first,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you to\n\nhear,\" said I.\n\n\n\nAnd I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but\n\nclear enough when done.  He heard me out with very few questions,\n\nlaughing here and there like a man delighted:  and the sound of his\n\nlaughing (above all there, in the dark, where neither one of us\n\ncould see the other) was extraordinary friendly to my heart.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, Davie, ye're a queer character,\" says he, when I had done:  \"a\n\nqueer bitch after a', and I have no mind of meeting with the like\n\nof ye.  As for your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel',\n\nso I'll say the less of him; and, dod! I believe he was the best\n\nfriend ye had, if ye could only trust him.  But Simon Fraser and\n\nJames More are my ain kind of cattle, and I'll give them the name\n\nthat they deserve.  The muckle black deil was father to the\n\nFrasers, a'body kens that; and as for the Gregara, I never could\n\nabye the reek of them since I could stotter on two feet.  I\n\nbloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly on my\n\nlegs that I cowped upon the top of him.  A proud man was my father\n\nthat day, God rest him! and I think he had the cause.  I'll never\n\ncan deny but what Robin was something of a piper,\" he added; \"but\n\nas for James More, the deil guide him for me!\"\n\n\n\n\"One thing we have to consider,\" said I.  \"Was Charles Stewart\n\nright or wrong?  Is it only me they're after, or the pair of us?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what's your ain opinion, you that's a man of so much\n\nexperience?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"It passes me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And me too,\" says Alan.  \"Do ye think this lass would keep her\n\nword to ye?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"I do that,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well, there's nae telling,\" said he.  \"And anyway, that's over and\n\ndone:  he'll be joined to the rest of them lang syne.\"\n\n\n\n\"How many would ye think there would be of them?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"That depends,\" said Alan.  \"If it was only you, they would likely\n\nsend two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought\n\nthat I was to appear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,\" said\n\nhe.\n\n\n\nIt was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.\n\n\n\n\"And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number,\n\nor the double of it, nearer hand!\" cries he.\n\n\n\n\"It matters the less,\" said I, \"because I am well rid of them for\n\nthis time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nae doubt that's your opinion,\" said he; \"but I wouldnae be the\n\nleast surprised if they were hunkering this wood.  Ye see, David\n\nman; they'll be Hieland folk.  There'll be some Frasers, I'm\n\nthinking, and some of the Gregara; and I would never deny but what\n\nthe both of them, and the Gregara in especial, were clever\n\nexperienced persons.  A man kens little till he's driven a spreagh\n\nof neat cattle (say) ten miles through a throng lowland country and\n\nthe black soldiers maybe at his tail.  It's there that I learned a\n\ngreat part of my penetration.  And ye need nae tell me:  it's\n\nbetter than war; which is the next best, however, though generally\n\nrather a bauchle of a business.  Now the Gregara have had grand\n\npractice.\"\n\n\n\n\"No doubt that's a branch of education that was left out with me,\"\n\nsaid I.\n\n\n\n\"And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly,\" said Alan.\n\n\"But that's the strange thing about you folk of the college\n\nlearning:  ye're ignorat, and ye cannae see 't.  Wae's me for my\n\nGreek and Hebrew; but, man, I ken that I dinnae ken them--there's\n\nthe differ of it.  Now, here's you.  Ye lie on your wame a bittie\n\nin the bield of this wood, and ye tell me that ye've cuist off\n\nthese Frasers and Macgregors.  Why?  BECAUSE I COULDNAE SEE THEM,\n\nsays you.  Ye blockhead, that's their livelihood.\"\n\n\n\n\"Take the worst of it,\" said I, \"and what are we to do?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am thinking of that same,\" said he.  \"We might twine.  It\n\nwouldnae be greatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons\n\nagainst it.  First, it's now unco dark, and it's just humanly\n\npossible we might give them the clean slip.  If we keep together,\n\nwe make but the ae line of it; if we gang separate, we make twae of\n\nthem:  the more likelihood to stave in upon some of these gentry of\n\nyours.  And then, second, if they keep the track of us, it may come\n\nto a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I'll confess I would be\n\nblythe to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none the\n\nworse of having me at yours.  So, by my way of it, we should creep\n\nout of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next\n\nminute, and hold away east for Gillane, where I'm to find my ship.\n\nIt'll be like old days while it lasts, Davie; and (come the time)\n\nwe'll have to think what you should be doing.  I'm wae to leave ye\n\nhere, wanting me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Have with ye, then!\" says I.  \"Do ye gang back where you were\n\nstopping?\"\n\n\n\n\"Deil a fear!\" said Alan.  \"They were good folks to me, but I think\n\nthey would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face\n\nagain.  For (the way times go) I amnae just what ye could call a\n\nWalcome Guest.  Which makes me the keener for your company, Mr.\n\nDavid Balfour of the Shaws, and set ye up!  For, leave aside twa\n\ncracks here in the wood with Charlie Stewart, I have scarce said\n\nblack or white since the day we parted at Corstorphine.\"\n\n\n\nWith which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly\n\neastward through the wood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--ON THE MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have said) was\n\ndown; a strongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack of cloud, had set in\n\nsuddenly from the west; and we began our movement in as black a\n\nnight as ever a fugitive or a murderer wanted.  The whiteness of\n\nthe path guided us into the sleeping town of Broughton, thence\n\nthrough Picardy, and beside my old acquaintance the gibbet of the\n\ntwo thieves.  A little beyond we made a useful beacon, which was a\n\nlight in an upper window of Lochend.  Steering by this, but a good\n\ndeal at random, and with some trampling of the harvest, and\n\nstumbling and falling down upon the banks, we made our way across\n\ncountry, and won forth at last upon the linky, boggy muirland that\n\nthey call the Figgate Whins.  Here, under a bush of whin, we lay\n\ndown the remainder of that night and slumbered.\n\n\n\nThe day called us about five.  A beautiful morning it was, the high\n\nwesterly wind still blowing strong, but the clouds all blown away\n\nto Europe.  Alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself.  It\n\nwas my first sight of my friend since we were parted, and I looked\n\nupon him with enjoyment.  He had still the same big great-coat on\n\nhis back; but (what was new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose\n\ndrawn above the knee.  Doubtless these were intended for disguise;\n\nbut, as the day promised to be warm, he made a most unseasonable\n\nfigure.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Davie,\" said he, \"is this no a bonny morning?  Here is a day\n\nthat looks the way that a day ought to.  This is a great change of\n\nit from the belly of my haystack; and while you were there\n\nsottering and sleeping I have done a thing that maybe I do very\n\nseldom.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what was that?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"O, just said my prayers,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"And where are my gentry, as ye call them?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Gude kens,\" says he; \"and the short and the long of it is that we\n\nmust take our chance of them.  Up with your foot-soles, Davie!\n\nForth, Fortune, once again of it!  And a bonny walk we are like to\n\nhave.\"\n\n\n\nSo we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where the salt-\n\npans were smoking in by the Esk mouth.  No doubt there was a by-\n\nordinary bonny blink of morning sun on Arthur's Seat and the green\n\nPentlands; and the pleasantness of the day appeared to set Alan\n\namong nettles.\n\n\n\n\"I feel like a gomeral,\" says he, \"to be leaving Scotland on a day\n\nlike this.  It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better to\n\nstay here and hing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, but ye wouldnae, Alan,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"No, but what France is a good place too,\" he explained; \"but it's\n\nsome way no the same.  It's brawer I believe, but it's no Scotland.\n\nI like it fine when I'm there, man; yet I kind of weary for Scots\n\ndivots and the Scots peat-reek.\"\n\n\n\n\"If that's all you have to complain of, Alan, it's no such great\n\naffair,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,\" said he, \"and me\n\nbut new out of yon deil's haystack.\"\n\n\n\n\"And so you were unco weary of your haystack?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Weary's nae word for it,\" said he.  \"I'm not just precisely a man\n\nthat's easily cast down; but I do better with caller air and the\n\nlift above my head.  I'm like the auld Black Douglas (wasnae't?)\n\nthat likit better to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep.\n\nAnd yon place, ye see, Davie--whilk was a very suitable place to\n\nhide in, as I'm free to own--was pit mirk from dawn to gloaming.\n\nThere were days (or nights, for how would I tell one from other?)\n\nthat seemed to me as long as a long winter.\"\n\n\n\n\"How did you know the hour to bide your tryst?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy, and a candle-\n\ndowp to eat it by, about eleeven,\" said he.  \"So, when I had\n\nswallowed a bit, it would he time to be getting to the wood.  There\n\nI lay and wearied for ye sore, Davie,\" says he, laying his hand on\n\nmy shoulder \"and guessed when the two hours would be about by--\n\nunless Charlie Stewart would come and tell me on his watch--and\n\nthen back to the dooms haystack.  Na, it was a driech employ, and\n\npraise the Lord that I have warstled through with it!\"\n\n\n\n\"What did you do with yourself?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Faith,\" said he, \"the best I could!  Whiles I played at the\n\nknucklebones.  I'm an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones,\n\nbut it's a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire\n\nye.  And whiles I would make songs.\"\n\n\n\n\"What were they about?\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"O, about the deer and the heather,\" says he, \"and about the\n\nancient old chiefs that are all by with it lang syne, and just\n\nabout what songs are about in general.  And then whiles I would\n\nmake believe I had a set of pipes and I was playing.  I played some\n\ngrand springs, and I thought I played them awful bonny; I vow\n\nwhiles that I could hear the squeal of them!  But the great affair\n\nis that it's done with.\"\n\n\n\nWith that he carried me again to my adventures, which he heard all\n\nover again with more particularity, and extraordinary approval,\n\nswearing at intervals that I was \"a queer character of a callant.\"\n\n\n\n\"So ye were frich'ened of Sim Fraser?\" he asked once.\n\n\n\n\"In troth was I!\" cried I.\n\n\n\n\"So would I have been, Davie,\" said he.  \"And that is indeed a\n\ndriedful man.  But it is only proper to give the deil his due:  and\n\nI can tell you he is a most respectable person on the field of\n\nwar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is he so brave?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Brave!\" said he.  \"He is as brave as my steel sword.\"\n\n\n\nThe story of my duel set him beside himself.\n\n\n\n\"To think of that!\" he cried.  \"I showed ye the trick in\n\nCorrynakiegh too.  And three times--three times disarmed!  It's a\n\ndisgrace upon my character that learned ye!  Here, stand up, out\n\nwith your airn; ye shall walk no step beyond this place upon the\n\nroad till ye can do yoursel' and me mair credit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan,\" said I, \"this is midsummer madness.  Here is no time for\n\nfencing lessons.\"\n\n\n\n\"I cannae well say no to that,\" he admitted.  \"But three times,\n\nman!  And you standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to\n\nfetch your ain sword like a doggie with a pocket-napkin!  David,\n\nthis man Duncansby must be something altogether by-ordinar!  He\n\nmaun be extraordinar skilly.  If I had the time, I would gang\n\nstraight back and try a turn at him mysel'.  The man must be a\n\nprovost.\"\n\n\n\n\"You silly fellow,\" said I, \"you forget it was just me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Na,\" said he, \"but three times!\"\n\n\n\n\"When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I never heard tell the equal of it,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I promise you the one thing, Alan,\" said I.  \"The next time that\n\nwe forgather, I'll be better learned.  You shall not continue to\n\nbear the disgrace of a friend that cannot strike.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, the next time!\" says he.  \"And when will that be, I would like\n\nto ken?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,\" said I; \"and\n\nmy plan is this.  It's my opinion to be called an advocate.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's but a weary trade, Davie,\" says Alan, \"and rather a\n\nblagyard one forby.  Ye would be better in a king's coat than\n\nthat.\"\n\n\n\n\"And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,\" cried I.\n\n\"But as you'll be in King Lewie's coat, and I'll be in King\n\nGeordie's, we'll have a dainty meeting of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's some sense in that,\" he admitted\n\n\n\n\"An advocate, then, it'll have to be,\" I continued, \"and I think it\n\na more suitable trade for a gentleman that was THREE TIMES\n\ndisarmed.  But the beauty of the thing is this:  that one of the\n\nbest colleges for that kind of learning--and the one where my\n\nkinsman, Pilrig, made his studies--is the college of Leyden in\n\nHolland.  Now, what say you, Alan?  Could not a cadet of Royal\n\nEcossais get a furlough, slip over the marches, and call in upon a\n\nLeyden student?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I would think he could!\" cried he.  \"Ye see, I stand\n\nwell in with my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what's mair\n\nto the purpose I have a cousin of mine lieutenant-colonel in a\n\nregiment of the Scots-Dutch.  Naething could be mair proper than\n\nwhat I would get a leave to see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of\n\nHalkett's.  And Lord Melfort, who is a very scienteefic kind of a\n\nman, and writes books like Caesar, would be doubtless very pleased\n\nto have the advantage of my observes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is Lord Meloort an author, then?\" I asked, for much as Alan\n\nthought of soldiers, I thought more of the gentry that write books.\n\n\n\n\"The very same, Davie,\" said he.  \"One would think a colonel would\n\nhave something better to attend to.  But what can I say that make\n\nsongs?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, then,\" said I, \"it only remains you should give me an\n\naddress to write you at in France; and as soon as I am got to\n\nLeyden I will send you mine.\"\n\n\n\n\"The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,\" said\n\nhe, \"Charles Stewart, of Ardsheil, Esquire, at the town of Melons,\n\nin the Isle of France.  It might take long, or it might take short,\n\nbut it would aye get to my hands at the last of it.\"\n\n\n\nWe had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh, where it amused\n\nme vastly to hear Alan.  His great-coat and boot-hose were\n\nextremely remarkable this warm morning, and perhaps some hint of an\n\nexplanation had been wise; but Alan went into that matter like a\n\nbusiness, or I should rather say, like a diversion.  He engaged the\n\ngoodwife of the house with some compliments upon the rizzoring of\n\nour haddocks; and the whole of the rest of our stay held her in\n\ntalk about a cold he had taken on his stomach, gravely relating all\n\nmanner of symptoms and sufferings, and hearing with a vast show of\n\ninterest all the old wives' remedies she could supply him with in\n\nreturn.\n\n\n\nWe left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from\n\nEdinburgh for (as Alan said) that was a rencounter we might very\n\nwell avoid.  The wind although still high, was very mild, the sun\n\nshone strong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion.  From\n\nPrestonpans he had me aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he\n\nexerted himself a great deal more than needful to describe the\n\nstages of the battle.  Thence, at his old round pace, we travelled\n\nto Cockenzie.  Though they were building herring-busses there at\n\nMrs. Cadell's, it seemed a desert-like, back-going town, about half\n\nfull of ruined houses; but the ale-house was clean, and Alan, who\n\nwas now in a glowing heat, must indulge himself with a bottle of\n\nale, and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the cold\n\nupon his stomach, only now the symptoms were all different.\n\n\n\nI sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had scarce ever\n\nheard him address three serious words to any woman, but he was\n\nalways drolling and fleering and making a private mock of them, and\n\nyet brought to that business a remarkable degree of energy and\n\ninterest.  Something to this effect I remarked to him, when the\n\ngood-wife (as chanced) was called away.\n\n\n\n\"What do ye want?\" says he.  \"A man should aye put his best foot\n\nforrit with the womankind; he should aye give them a bit of a story\n\nto divert them, the poor lambs!  It's what ye should learn to\n\nattend to, David; ye should get the principles, it's like a trade.\n\nNow, if this had been a young lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would\n\nnever have heard tell of my stomach, Davie.  But aince they're too\n\nold to be seeking joes, they a' set up to be apotecaries.  Why?\n\nWhat do I ken?  They'll be just the way God made them, I suppose.\n\nBut I think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his attention\n\nto the same.\"\n\n\n\nAnd here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as if with\n\nimpatience to renew their former conversation.  The lady had\n\nbranched some while before from Alan's stomach to the case of a\n\ngoodbrother of her own in Aberlady, whose last sickness and demise\n\nshe was describing at extraordinary length.  Sometimes it was\n\nmerely dull, sometimes both dull and awful, for she talked with\n\nunction.  The upshot was that I fell in a deep muse, looking forth\n\nof the window on the road, and scarce marking what I saw.\n\nPresently had any been looking they might have seen me to start.\n\n\n\n\"We pit a fomentation to his feet,\" the good-wife was saying, \"and\n\na het stane to his wame, and we gied him hyssop and water of\n\npennyroyal, and fine, clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast. . . \"\n\n\n\n\"Sir,\" says I, cutting very quietly in, \"there's a friend of mine\n\ngone by the house.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that e'en sae?\" replies Alan, as though it were a thing of\n\nsmall account.  And then, \"Ye were saying, mem?\" says he; and the\n\nwearyful wife went on.\n\n\n\nPresently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece, and she\n\nmust go forth after the change.\n\n\n\n\"Was it him with the red head?\" asked Alan.\n\n\n\n\"Ye have it,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"What did I tell you in the wood?\" he cried.  \"And yet it's strange\n\nhe should be here too!  Was he his lane?\"\n\n\n\n\"His lee-lane for what I could see,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Did he gang by?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Straight by,\" said I, \"and looked neither to the right nor left.\"\n\n\n\n\"And that's queerer yet,\" said Alan.  \"It sticks in my mind, Davie,\n\nthat we should be stirring.  But where to?--deil hae't!  This is\n\nlike old days fairly,\" cries he.\n\n\n\n\"There is one big differ, though,\" said I, \"that now we have money\n\nin our pockets.\"\n\n\n\n\"And another big differ, Mr. Balfour,\" says he, \"that now we have\n\ndogs at our tail.  They're on the scent; they're in full cry,\n\nDavid.  It's a bad business and be damned to it.\"  And he sat\n\nthinking hard with a look of his that I knew well.\n\n\n\n\"I'm saying, Luckie,\" says he, when the goodwife returned, \"have ye\n\na back road out of this change house?\"\n\n\n\nShe told him there was and where it led to.\n\n\n\n\"Then, sir,\" says he to me, \"I think that will be the shortest road\n\nfor us.  And here's good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I'll no\n\nforget thon of the cinnamon water.\"\n\n\n\nWe went out by way of the woman's kale yard, and up a lane among\n\nfields.  Alan looked sharply to all sides, and seeing we were in a\n\nlittle hollow place of the country, out of view of men, sat down.\n\n\n\n\"Now for a council of war, Davie,\" said he.  \"But first of all, a\n\nbit lesson to ye.  Suppose that I had been like you, what would yon\n\nold wife have minded of the pair of us!  Just that we had gone out\n\nby the back gate.  And what does she mind now?  A fine, canty,\n\nfriendly, cracky man, that suffered with the stomach, poor body!\n\nand was real ta'en up about the goodbrother.  O man, David, try and\n\nlearn to have some kind of intelligence!\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll try, Alan,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And now for him of the red head,\" says he; \"was he gaun fast or\n\nslow?\"\n\n\n\n\"Betwixt and between,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"No kind of a hurry about the man?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Never a sign of it,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Nhm!\" said Alan, \"it looks queer.  We saw nothing of them this\n\nmorning on the Whins; he's passed us by, he doesnae seem to be\n\nlooking, and yet here he is on our road!  Dod, Davie, I begin to\n\ntake a notion.  I think it's no you they're seeking, I think it's\n\nme; and I think they ken fine where they're gaun.\"\n\n\n\n\"They ken?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"I think Andie Scougal's sold me--him or his mate wha kent some\n\npart of the affair--or else Charlie's clerk callant, which would be\n\na pity too,\" says Alan; \"and if you askit me for just my inward\n\nprivate conviction, I think there'll be heads cracked on Gillane\n\nsands.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan,\" I cried, \"if you're at all right there'll be folk there and\n\nto spare.  It'll be small service to crack heads.\"\n\n\n\n\"It would aye be a satisfaction though,\" says Alan.  But bide a\n\nbit; bide a bit; I'm thinking--and thanks to this bonny westland\n\nwind, I believe I've still a chance of it.  It's this way, Davie.\n\nI'm no trysted with this man Scougal till the gloaming comes.\n\nBUT,\" says he, \"IF I CAN GET A BIT OF A WIND OUT OF THE WEST I'LL\n\nBE THERE LONG OR THAT,\" he says, \"AND LIE-TO FOR YE BEHIND THE ISLE\n\nOF FIDRA.  Now if your gentry kens the place, they ken the time\n\nforbye.  Do ye see me coming, Davie? Thanks to Johnnie Cope and\n\nother red-coat gomerals, I should ken this country like the back of\n\nmy hand; and if ye're ready for another bit run with Alan Breck,\n\nwe'll can cast back inshore, and come to the seaside again by\n\nDirleton.  If the ship's there, we'll try and get on board of her.\n\nIf she's no there, I'll just have to get back to my weary haystack.\n\nBut either way of it, I think we will leave your gentry whistling\n\non their thumbs.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe there's some chance in it,\" said I.  \"Have on with ye,\n\nAlan!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--GILLANE SANDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not profit by Alan's pilotage as he had done by his marchings\n\nunder General Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went.  It is\n\nmy excuse that we travelled exceeding fast.  Some part we ran, some\n\ntrotted, and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace.  Twice,\n\nwhile we were at top speed, we ran against country-folk; but though\n\nwe plumped into the first from round a corner, Alan was as ready as\n\na loaded musket.\n\n\n\n\"Has ye seen my horse?\" he gasped.\n\n\n\n\"Na, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day,\" replied the countryman.\n\n\n\nAnd Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling\n\n\"ride and tie\"; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared he\n\nhad gone home to Linton.  Not only that, but he expended some\n\nbreath (of which he had not very much left) to curse his own\n\nmisfortune and my stupidity which was said to be its cause.\n\n\n\n\"Them that cannae tell the truth,\" he observed to myself as we went\n\non again, \"should be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy lee\n\nbehind them.  If folk dinnae ken what ye're doing, Davie, they're\n\nterrible taken up with it; but if they think they ken, they care\n\nnae mair for it than what I do for pease porridge.\"\n\n\n\nAs we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie\n\nvery near due north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the\n\nleft; on the right, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was thus we\n\nstruck the shore again, not far from Dirleton.  From north Berwick\n\nwest to Gillane Ness there runs a string of four small islets,\n\nCraiglieth, the Lamb, Fidra, and Eyebrough, notable by their\n\ndiversity of size and shape.  Fidra is the most particular, being a\n\nstrange grey islet of two humps, made the more conspicuous by a\n\npiece of ruin; and I mind that (as we drew closer to it) by some\n\ndoor or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like a man's\n\neye.  Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in westerly\n\nwinds, and there, from a far way off, we could see the Thistle\n\nriding.\n\n\n\nThe shore in face of these islets is altogether waste.  Here is no\n\ndwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond\n\nchildren running at their play.  Gillane is a small place on the\n\nfar side of the Ness, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in\n\nthe inland fields, and those of North Berwick straight to the sea-\n\nfishing from their haven; so that few parts of the coast are\n\nlonelier.  But I mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that\n\nmultiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon all\n\nsides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there was such a\n\nshining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the bent\n\ngrass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying\n\ngulls, that the desert seemed to me, like a place alive.  No doubt\n\nit was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the\n\nsecret had been kept; and even now that it was out, and the place\n\nwatched, we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the\n\nsandhills, where they look down immediately on the beach and sea.\n\n\n\nBut here Alan came to a full stop.\n\n\n\n\"Davie,\" said he, \"this is a kittle passage!  As long as we lie\n\nhere we're safe; but I'm nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the\n\ncoast of France.  And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig,\n\nit's another matter.  For where will your gentry be, think ye?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe they're no come yet,\" said I.  \"And even if they are,\n\nthere's one clear matter in our favour.  They'll be all arranged to\n\ntake us, that's true.  But they'll have arranged for our coming\n\nfrom the east and here we are upon their west.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" says Alan, \"I wish we were in some force, and this was a\n\nbattle, we would have bonnily out-manoeuvred them!  But it isnae,\n\nDavit; and the way it is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan\n\nBreck.  I swither, Davie.\"\n\n\n\n\"Time flies, Alan,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I ken that,\" said Alan.  \"I ken naething else, as the French folk\n\nsay.  But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails.  O! if I could\n\nbut ken where your gentry were!\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan,\" said I, \"this is no like you.  It's got to be now or\n\nnever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is no me, quo' he,\"\n\n\n\n\n\nsang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Neither you nor me, quo' he, neither you nor me.\n\nWow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with a\n\nhandkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the beach.\n\nI stood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the sand-hills\n\nto the east.  His appearance was at first unremarked:  Scougal not\n\nexpecting him so early, and MY GENTRY watching on the other side.\n\nThen they awoke on board the Thistle, and it seemed they had all in\n\nreadiness, for there was scarce a second's bustle on the deck\n\nbefore we saw a skiff put round her stern and begin to pull lively\n\nfor the coast.  Almost at the same moment of time, and perhaps half\n\na mile away towards Gillane Ness, the figure of a man appeared for\n\na blink upon a sandhill, waving with his arms; and though he was\n\ngone again in the same flash, the gulls in that part continued a\n\nlittle longer to fly wild.\n\n\n\nAlan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at the ship and\n\nskiff.\n\n\n\n\"It maun be as it will!\" said he, when I had told him, \"Weel may\n\nyon boatie row, or my craig'll have to thole a raxing.\"\n\n\n\nThat part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking\n\nwhen the tide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in one\n\nplace to the sea; and the sandhills ran along the head of it like\n\nthe rampart of a town.  No eye of ours could spy what was passing\n\nbehind there in the bents, no hurry of ours could mend the speed of\n\nthe boat's coming:  time stood still with us through that uncanny\n\nperiod of waiting.\n\n\n\n\"There is one thing I would like to ken,\" say Alan.  \"I would like\n\nto ken these gentry's orders.  We're worth four hunner pound the\n\npair of us:  how if they took the guns to us, Davie!  They would\n\nget a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank.\"\n\n\n\n\"Morally impossible,\" said I.  \"The point is that they can have no\n\nguns.  This thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they may\n\nhave, but never guns.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe ye'll be in the right,\" says Alan.  \"For all which I am\n\nwearing a good deal for yon boat.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.\n\n\n\nIt was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already\n\nhard on the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over my\n\nshoes.  There was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look as\n\nmuch as we were able at the creeping nearer of the boat, and as\n\nlittle as we could manage at the long impenetrable front of the\n\nsandhills, over which the gulls twinkled and behind which our\n\nenemies were doubtless marshalling.\n\n\n\n\"This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,\" says Alan\n\nsuddenly; \"and, man, I wish that I had your courage!\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan!\" I cried, \"what kind of talk is this of it!  You're just\n\nmade of courage; it's the character of the man, as I could prove\n\nmyself if there was nobody else.\"\n\n\n\n\"And you would be the more mistaken,\" said he.  \"What makes the\n\ndiffer with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of\n\naffairs.  But for auld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit\n\nto hold a candle to yourself.  Look at us two here upon the sands.\n\nHere am I, fair hotching to be off; here's you (for all that I ken)\n\nin two minds of it whether you'll no stop.  Do you think that I\n\ncould do that, or would?  No me!  Firstly, because I havenae got\n\nthe courage and wouldnae daur; and secondly, because I am a man of\n\nso much penetration and would see ye damned first.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's there ye're coming, is it?\" I cried.  \"Ah, man Alan, you can\n\nwile your old wives, but you never can wile me.\"\n\n\n\nRemembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron.\n\n\n\n\"I have a tryst to keep,\" I continued.  \"I am trysted with your\n\ncousin Charlie; I have passed my word.\"\n\n\n\n\"Braw trysts that you'll can keep,\" said Alan.  \"Ye'll just\n\nmistryst aince and for a' with the gentry in the bents.  And what\n\nfor?\" he went on with an extreme threatening gravity.  \"Just tell\n\nme that, my mannie!  Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange?\n\nAre they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents?\n\nOr is it to be the other way, and are they to bring ye in with\n\nJames?  Are they folk to be trustit?  Would ye stick your head in\n\nthe mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs?\" he added with\n\nextraordinary bitterness.\n\n\n\n\"Alan,\" cried I, \"they're all rogues and liars, and I'm with ye\n\nthere.  The more reason there should be one decent man in such a\n\nland of thieves!  My word in passed, and I'll stick to it.  I said\n\nlong syne to your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk.  Do ye\n\nmind of that?--the night Red Colin fell, it was.  No more I will,\n\nthen.  Here I stop.  Prestongrange promised me my life:  if he's to\n\nbe mansworn, here I'll have to die.\"\n\n\n\n\"Aweel aweel,\" said Alan.\n\n\n\nAll this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers.  In\n\ntruth we had caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was to\n\nlearn afterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there was of\n\nthem was spread among the bents towards Gillane.  It was quite an\n\naffair to call them in and bring them over, and the boat was making\n\nspeed.  They were besides but cowardly fellows:  a mere leash of\n\nHighland cattle-thieves, of several clans, no gentleman there to be\n\nthe captain and the more they looked at Alan and me upon the beach,\n\nthe less (I must suppose) they liked the look of us.\n\n\n\nWhoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain:  he was in the\n\nskiff himself, steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man\n\nwith his heart in his employ.  Already he was near in, and the boat\n\nsecuring--already Alan's face had flamed crimson with the\n\nexcitement of his deliverance, when our friends in the bents,\n\neither in their despair to see their prey escape them or with some\n\nhope of scaring Andie, raised suddenly a shrill cry of several\n\nvoices.\n\n\n\nThis sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted\n\ncoast, was really very daunting, and the men in the boat held water\n\ninstantly.\n\n\n\n\"What's this of it?\" sings out the captain, for he was come within\n\nan easy hail.\n\n\n\n\"Freens o'mine,\" says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth in\n\nthe shallow water towards the boat.  \"Davie,\" he said, pausing,\n\n\"Davie, are ye no coming?  I am swier to leave ye.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not a hair of me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt\n\nwater, hesitating.\n\n\n\n\"He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,\" said he, and swashing in\n\ndeeper than his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was\n\nimmediately directed for the ship.\n\n\n\nI stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan\n\nsat with his head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly\n\naway.  Of a sudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and\n\nseemed to myself the most deserted solitary lad in Scotland.  With\n\nthat I turned my back upon the sea and faced the sandhills.  There\n\nwas no sight or sound of man; the sun shone on the wet sand and the\n\ndry, the wind blew in the bents, the gulls made a dreary piping.\n\nAs I passed higher up the beach, the sand-lice were hopping nimbly\n\nabout the stranded tangles.  The devil any other sight or sound in\n\nthat unchancy place.  And yet I knew there were folk there,\n\nobserving me, upon some secret purpose.  They were no soldiers, or\n\nthey would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless they were\n\nsome common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap, perhaps\n\nto murder me outright.  From the position of those engaged, the\n\nfirst was the more likely; from what I knew of their character and\n\nardency in this business, I thought the second very possible; and\n\nthe blood ran cold about my heart.\n\n\n\nI had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though I\n\nwas very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade, I\n\nthought I could do some scathe in a random combat.  But I perceived\n\nin time the folly of resistance.  This was no doubt the joint\n\n\"expedient\" on which Prestongrange and Fraser were agreed.  The\n\nfirst, I was very sure, had done something to secure my life; the\n\nsecond was pretty likely to have slipped in some contrary hints\n\ninto the ears of Neil and his companions; and it I were to show\n\nbare steel I might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy\n\nand seal my own doom.\n\n\n\nThese thoughts brought me to the head of the beach.  I cast a look\n\nbehind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his\n\nhandkerchief for a farewell, which I replied to with the waving of\n\nmy hand.  But Alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view,\n\nalongside of this pass that lay in front of me.  I set my hat hard\n\non my head, clenched my teeth, and went right before me up the face\n\nof the sand-wreath.  It made a hard climb, being steep, and the\n\nsand like water underfoot.  But I caught hold at last by the long\n\nbent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled myself to a good footing.\n\nThe same moment men stirred and stood up here and there, six or\n\nseven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger in his hand.\n\nThe fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed.  When I opened them\n\nagain, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without speech\n\nor hurry.  Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange\n\nsensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they\n\ncontinued to approach me.  I held out my hands empty; whereupon one\n\nasked, with a strong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.\n\n\n\n\"Under protest,\" said I, \"if ye ken what that means, which I\n\nmisdoubt.\"\n\n\n\nAt that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon\n\na carrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from my\n\npockets, bound me hand and foot with some strong line, and cast me\n\non a tussock of bent.  There they sat about their captive in a part\n\nof a circle and gazed upon him silently like something dangerous,\n\nperhaps a lion or a tiger on the spring.  Presently this attention\n\nwas relaxed.  They drew nearer together, fell to speech in the\n\nGaelic, and very cynically divided my property before my eyes.  It\n\nwas my diversion in this time that I could watch from my place the\n\nprogress of my friend's escape.  I saw the boat come to the brig\n\nand be hoisted in, the sails fill, and the ship pass out seaward\n\nbehind the isles and by North Berwick.\n\n\n\nIn the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen\n\nkept collecting.  Neil among the first, until the party must have\n\nnumbered near a score.  With each new arrival there was a fresh\n\nbout of talk, that sounded like complaints and explanations; but I\n\nobserved one thing, none of those who came late had any share in\n\nthe division of my spoils.  The last discussion was very violent\n\nand eager, so that once I thought they would have quarrelled; on\n\nthe heels of which their company parted, the bulk of them returning\n\nwestward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two others, remaining\n\nsentries on the prisoner.\n\n\n\n\"I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day's\n\nwork, Neil Duncanson,\" said I, when the rest had moved away.\n\n\n\nHe assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew he\n\nwas \"acquent wi' the leddy.\"\n\n\n\nThis was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon\n\nthat portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the\n\nHighland mountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark.\n\nAt which hour I was aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man of\n\na very swarthy countenance, that came towards us among the bents on\n\na farm horse.\n\n\n\n\"Lads,\" cried he, \"has ye a paper like this?\" and held up one in\n\nhis hand.  Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied\n\nthrough a pair of horn spectacles, and saying all was right and we\n\nwere the folk he was seeking, immediately dismounted.  I was then\n\nset in his place, my feet tied under the horse's belly, and we set\n\nforth under the guidance of the Lowlander.  His path must have been\n\nvery well chosen, for we met but one pair--a pair of lovers--the\n\nwhole way, and these, perhaps taking us to be free-traders, fled on\n\nour approach.  We were at one time close at the foot of Berwick Law\n\non the south side; at another, as we passed over some open hills, I\n\nspied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church among\n\nsome trees not far off, but too far to cry for help, if I had\n\ndreamed of it.  At last we came again within sound of the sea.\n\nThere was moonlight, though not much; and by this I could see the\n\nthree huge towers and broken battlements of Tantallon, that old\n\nchief place of the Red Douglases.  The horse was picketed in the\n\nbottom of the ditch to graze, and I was led within, and forth into\n\nthe court, and thence into the tumble-down stone hall.  Here my\n\nconductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the pavement, for\n\nthere was a chill in the night.  My hands were loosed, I was set by\n\nthe wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander having produced\n\nprovisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French\n\nbrandy.  This done, I was left once more alone with my three\n\nHighlandmen.  They sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the\n\nwind blew in by the breaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and\n\nsang in the tops of the towers; I could hear the sea under the\n\ncliffs, and, my mind being reassured as to my life, and my body and\n\nspirits wearied with the day's employment, I turned upon one side\n\nand slumbered.\n\n\n\nI had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the\n\nmoon was down and the fire was low.  My feet were now loosed, and I\n\nwas carried through the ruins and down the cliff-side by a\n\nprecipitous path to where I found a fisher's boat in a haven of the\n\nrocks.  This I was had on board of, and we began to put forth from\n\nthe shore in a fine starlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--THE BASS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here and\n\nthere for the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while in my\n\nhead a word of Ransome's--the TWENTY-POUNDERS.  If I were to be\n\nexposed a second time to that same former danger of the\n\nplantations, I judged it must turn ill with me; there was no second\n\nAlan; and no second shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now;\n\nand I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip's lash.  The thought\n\nchilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the stretchers of the\n\nboat drenched with a cold dew:  and I shivered in my place beside\n\nthe steersman.  This was the dark man whom I have called hitherto\n\nthe Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black Andie.\n\nFeeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed me a rough\n\njacket full of fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover myself.\n\n\n\n\"I thank you for this kindness,\" said I, \"and will make so free as\n\nto repay it with a warning.  You take a high responsibility in this\n\naffair.  You are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders,\n\nbut know what the law is and the risks of those that break it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am no just exactly what ye would ca' an extremist for the law,\"\n\nsays he, \"at the best of times; but in this business I act with a\n\ngood warranty.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Nae harm,\" said he, \"nae harm ava'.  Ye'll have strong freens, I'm\n\nthinking.  Ye'll be richt eneuch yet.\"\n\n\n\nThere began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little dabs\n\nof pink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east; and at\n\nthe same time the geese awakened, and began crying about the top of\n\nthe Bass.  It is just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but\n\ngreat enough to carve a city from.  The sea was extremely little,\n\nbut there went a hollow plowter round the base of it.  With the\n\ngrowing of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer; the\n\nstraight crags painted with sea-birds' droppings like a morning\n\nfrost, the sloping top of it green with grass, the clan of white\n\ngeese that cried about the sides, and the black, broken buildings\n\nof the prison sitting close on the sea's edge.\n\n\n\nAt the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.\n\n\n\n\"It's there you're taking me!\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"Just to the Bass, mannie,\" said he:  \"Whaur the auld saints were\n\nafore ye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your\n\npreeson.\"\n\n\n\n\"But none dwells there now,\" I cried; \"the place is long a ruin.\"\n\n\n\n\"It'll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,\"\n\nquoth Andie dryly.\n\n\n\nThe day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among the\n\nbig stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several kegs\n\nand baskets, and a provision of fuel.  All these were discharged\n\nupon the crag.  Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call\n\nthem mine, although it was the other way about), landed along with\n\nthem.  The sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again, the\n\nnoise of the oars on the thole-pins echoing from the cliffs, and\n\nleft us in our singular reclusion:\n\n\n\nAndie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the\n\nBass, being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small\n\nand rich estate.  He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed\n\nand fattened on the grass of the sloping part of it, like beasts\n\ngrazing the roof of a cathedral.  He had charge besides of the\n\nsolan geese that roosted in the crags; and from these an\n\nextraordinary income is derived.  The young are dainty eating, as\n\nmuch as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and paid\n\nwillingly by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their\n\noil and feathers; and a part of the minister's stipend of North\n\nBerwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in some\n\nfolks' eyes) a parish to be coveted.  To perform these several\n\nbusinesses, as well as to protect the geese from poachers, Andie\n\nhad frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the crag;\n\nand we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading.\n\nBidding us all shoulder some of the packages, a matter in which I\n\nmade haste to bear a hand, he led us in by a looked gate, which was\n\nthe only admission to the island, and through the ruins of the\n\nfortress, to the governor's house.  There we saw by the ashes in\n\nthe chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he made\n\nhis usual occupation.\n\n\n\nThis bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I would set\n\nup to be gentry.\n\n\n\n\"My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,\" said I.  \"I bless\n\nGod I have lain hard ere now, and can do the same again with\n\nthankfulness.  While I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your name, I\n\nwill do my part and take my place beside the rest of you; and I ask\n\nyou on the other hand to spare me your mockery, which I own I like\n\nill.\"\n\n\n\nHe grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection to\n\napprove it.  Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and a good\n\nWhig and Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and was both\n\nable and eager to converse seriously on religion, leaning more than\n\na little towards the Cameronian extremes.  His morals were of a\n\nmore doubtful colour.  I found he was deep in the free trade, and\n\nused the rains of Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise.\n\nAs for a gauger, I do not believe he valued the life of one at\n\nhalf-a-farthing.  But that part of the coast of Lothian is to this\n\nday as wild a place, and the commons there as rough a crew, as any\n\nin Scotland.\n\n\n\nOne incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence\n\nit had long after.  There was a warship at this time stationed in\n\nthe Firth, the Seahorse, Captain Palliser.  It chanced she was\n\ncruising in the month of September, plying between Fife and\n\nLothian, and sounding for sunk dangers.  Early one fine morning she\n\nwas seen about two miles to east of us, where she lowered a boat,\n\nand seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks and Satan's Bush, famous\n\ndangers of that coast.  And presently after having got her boat\n\nagain, she came before the wind and was headed directly for the\n\nBase.  This was very troublesome to Andie and the Highlanders; the\n\nwhole business of my sequestration was designed for privacy, and\n\nhere, with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore, it looked to\n\nbecome public enough, if it were nothing worse.  I was in a\n\nminority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was far\n\nfrom sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my\n\ncondition.  All which considered, I gave Andie my parole of good\n\nbehaviour and obedience, and was had briskly to the summit of the\n\nrock, where we all lay down, at the cliff's edge, in different\n\nplaces of observation and concealment.  The Seahorse came straight\n\non till I thought she would have struck, and we (looking giddily\n\ndown) could see the ship's company at their quarters and hear the\n\nleadsman singing at the lead.  Then she suddenly wore and let fly a\n\nvolley of I know not how many great guns.  The rock was shaken with\n\nthe thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over our heads, and the\n\ngeese rose in number beyond computation or belief.  To hear their\n\nscreaming and to see the twinkling of their wings, made a most\n\ninimitable curiosity; and I suppose it was after this somewhat\n\nchildish pleasure that Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass.\n\nHe was to pay dear for it in time.  During his approach I had the\n\nopportunity to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by which\n\nI ever after knew it miles away; and this was a means (under\n\nProvidence) of my averting from a friend a great calamity, and\n\ninflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible disappointment.\n\n\n\nAll the time of my stay on the rock we lived well.  We had small\n\nale and brandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night\n\nand morning.  At times a boat came from the Castleton and brought\n\nus a quarter of mutton, for the sheep upon the rock we must not\n\ntouch, these being specially fed to market.  The geese were\n\nunfortunately out of season, and we let them be.  We fished\n\nourselves, and yet more often made the geese to fish for us:\n\nobserving one when he had made a capture and searing him from his\n\nprey ere he had swallowed it.\n\n\n\nThe strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which it\n\nabounded, held me busy and amused.  Escape being impossible, I was\n\nallowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the surface of\n\nthe isle wherever it might support the foot of man.  The old garden\n\nof the prison was still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs\n\nrunning wild, and some ripe cherries on a bush.  A little lower\n\nstood a chapel or a hermit's cell; who built or dwelt in it, none\n\nmay know, and the thought of its age made a ground of many\n\nmeditations.  The prison, too, where I now bivouacked with Highland\n\ncattle-thieves, was a place full of history, both human and divine.\n\nI thought it strange so many saints and martyrs should have gone by\n\nthere so recently, and left not so much as a leaf out of their\n\nBibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while the rough soldier\n\nlads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the\n\nneighbourhood with their mementoes--broken tobacco-pipes for the\n\nmost part, and that in a surprising plenty, but also metal buttons\n\nfrom their coats.  There were times when I thought I could have\n\nheard the pious sound of psalms out of the martyr's dungeons, and\n\nseen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes, and\n\nthe dawn rising behind them out of the North Sea.\n\n\n\nNo doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these\n\nfancies in my head.  He was extraordinarily well acquainted with\n\nthe story of the rock in all particulars, down to the names of\n\nprivate soldiers, his father having served there in that same\n\ncapacity.  He was gifted besides with a natural genius for\n\nnarration, so that the people seemed to speak and the things to be\n\ndone before your face.  This gift of his and my assiduity to listen\n\nbrought us the more close together.  I could not honestly deny but\n\nwhat I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and indeed, from the\n\nfirst I had set myself out to capture his good-will.  An odd\n\ncircumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond my\n\nexpectation; but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a\n\nprisoner and his gaoler.\n\n\n\nI should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the\n\nBass was wholly disagreeable.  It seemed to me a safe place, as\n\nthough I was escaped there out of my troubles.  No harm was to be\n\noffered me; a material impossibility, rock and the deep sea,\n\nprevented me from fresh attempts; I felt I had my life safe and my\n\nhonour safe, and there were times when I allowed myself to gloat on\n\nthem like stolen waters.  At other times my thoughts were very\n\ndifferent, I recalled how strong I had expressed myself both to\n\nRankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my captivity upon the\n\nBass, in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife and Lothian,\n\nwas a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented than\n\nendured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at least, I must\n\npass for a boaster and a coward.  Now I would take this lightly\n\nenough; tell myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona\n\nDrummond, the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and\n\nspilled water; and thence pass off into those meditations of a\n\nlover which are so delightful to himself and must always appear so\n\nsurprisingly idle to a reader.  But anon the fear would take me\n\notherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect panic of self-esteem,\n\nand these supposed hard judgments appear an injustice impossible to\n\nbe supported.  With that another train of thought would he\n\npresented, and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men's\n\njudgments of myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of\n\nJames Stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife.\n\nThen, indeed, passion began to work in me; I could not forgive\n\nmyself to sit there idle:  it seemed (if I were a man at all) that\n\nI could fly or swim out of my place of safety; and it was in such\n\nhumours and to amuse my self-reproaches that I would set the more\n\nparticularly to win the good side of Andie Dale.\n\n\n\nAt last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a\n\nbright morning, I put in some hint about a bribe.  He looked at me,\n\ncast back his head, and laughed out loud.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, you're funny, Mr. Dale,\" said I, \"but perhaps if you'll glance\n\nan eye upon that paper you may change your note.\"\n\n\n\nThe stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure\n\nnothing but hard money, and the paper I now showed Andie was an\n\nacknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable\n\nsum.\n\n\n\nHe read it.  \"Troth, and ye're nane sae ill aff,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I thought that would maybe vary your opinions,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Hout!\" said he.  \"It shows me ye can bribe; but I'm no to be\n\nbribit.\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll see about that yet a while,\" says I.  \"And first, I'll show\n\nyou that I know what I am talking.  You have orders to detain me\n\nhere till after Thursday, 21st September.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye're no a'thegether wrong either,\" says Andie.  \"I'm to let you\n\ngang, bar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd.\"\n\n\n\nI could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in\n\nthis arrangement.  That I was to re-appear precisely in time to be\n\ntoo late would cast the more discredit on my tale, if I were minded\n\nto tell one; and this screwed me to fighting point.\n\n\n\n\"Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and think\n\nwhile ye listen,\" said I.  \"I know there are great folks in the\n\nbusiness, and I make no doubt you have their names to go upon.  I\n\nhave seen some of them myself since this affair began, and said my\n\nsay into their faces too.  But what kind of a crime would this be\n\nthat I had committed? or what kind of a process is this that I am\n\nfallen under?  To be apprehended by some ragged John-Hielandman on\n\nAugust 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones that is now neither\n\nfort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just the gamekeeper's\n\nlodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again, September 23rd, as\n\nsecretly as I was first arrested--does that sound like law to you?\n\nor does it sound like justice? or does it not sound honestly like a\n\npiece of some low dirty intrigue, of which the very folk that\n\nmeddle with it are ashamed?\"\n\n\n\n\"I canna gainsay ye, Shaws.  It looks unco underhand,\" says Andie.\n\n\"And werenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians\n\nI would has seen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have\n\nset hand to it.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Master of Lovat'll be a braw Whig,\" says I, \"and a grand\n\nPresbyterian.\"\n\n\n\n\"I ken naething by him,\" said he.  \"I hae nae trokings wi' Lovats.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, it'll be Prestongrange that you'll be dealing with,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but I'll no tell ye that,\" said Andie.\n\n\n\n\"Little need when I ken,\" was my retort.\n\n\n\n\"There's just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,\" says\n\nAndie.  \"And that is that (try as ye please) I'm no dealing wi'\n\nyoursel'; nor yet I amnae goin' to,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Andie, I see I'll have to be speak out plain with you,\" I\n\nreplied.  And told him so much as I thought needful of the facts.\n\n\n\nHe heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done,\n\nseemed to consider a little with himself.\n\n\n\n\"Shaws,\" said he at last, \"I'll deal with the naked hand.  It's a\n\nqueer tale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and I'm\n\nfar frae minting that is other than the way that ye believe it.  As\n\nfor yoursel', ye seem to me rather a dacent-like young man.  But\n\nme, that's aulder and mair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit\n\nfurther forrit in the job than what ye can dae.  And here the\n\nmaitter clear and plain to ye.  There'll be nae skaith to yoursel'\n\nif I keep ye here; far free that, I think ye'll be a hantle better\n\nby it.  There'll be nae skaith to the kintry--just ae mair\n\nHielantman hangit--Gude kens, a guid riddance!  On the ither hand,\n\nit would be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free.\n\nSae, speakin' as a guid Whig, an honest freen' to you, and an\n\nanxious freen' to my ainsel', the plain fact is that I think ye'll\n\njust have to bide here wi' Andie an' the solans.\"\n\n\n\n\"Andie,\" said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \"this Hielantman's\n\ninnocent.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, it's a peety about that,\" said he.  \"But ye see, in this\n\nwarld, the way God made it, we cannae just get a'thing that we\n\nwant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--BLACK ANDIE'S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have yet said little of the Highlanders.  They were all three of\n\nthe followers of James More, which bound the accusation very tight\n\nabout their master's neck.  All understood a word or two of\n\nEnglish, but Neil was the only one who judged he had enough of it\n\nfor general converse, in which (when once he got embarked) his\n\ncompany was often tempted to the contrary opinion.  They were\n\ntractable, simple creatures; showed much more courtesy than might\n\nhave been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth\n\nappearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three servants for\n\nAndie and myself.\n\n\n\nDwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of a\n\nprison, and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea-\n\nbirds, I thought I perceived in them early the effects of\n\nsuperstitious fear.  When there was nothing doing they would either\n\nlie and sleep, for which their appetite appeared insatiable, or\n\nNeil would entertain the others with stories which seemed always of\n\na terrifying strain.  If neither of these delights were within\n\nreach--if perhaps two were sleeping and the third could find no\n\nmeans to follow their example--I would see him sit and listen and\n\nlook about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his face\n\nblenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow.  The nature\n\nof these fears I had never an occasion to find out, but the sight\n\nof them was catching, and the nature of the place that we were in\n\nfavourable to alarms.  I can find no word for it in the English,\n\nbut Andie had an expression for it in the Scots from which he never\n\nvaried.\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" he would say, \"ITS AN UNCO PLACE, THE BASS.\"\n\n\n\nIt is so I always think of it.  It was an unco place by night, unco\n\nby day; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the solans,\n\nand the plash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung continually\n\nin our ears.  It was chiefly so in moderate weather.  When the\n\nwaves were anyway great they roared about the rock like thunder and\n\nthe drums of armies, dreadful but merry to hear; and it was in the\n\ncalm days that a man could daunt himself with listening--not a\n\nHighlandman only, as I several times experimented on myself, so\n\nmany still, hollow noises haunted and reverberated in the porches\n\nof the rock.\n\n\n\nThis brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in,\n\nwhich quite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect on\n\nmy departure.  It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the\n\nfire and (that little air of Alan's coming back to my memory) began\n\nto whistle.  A hand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of Neil\n\nbade me to stop, for it was not \"canny musics.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not canny?\" I asked.  \"How can that be?\"\n\n\n\n\"Na,\" said he; \"it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid\n\nupon his body.\" {13}\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"there can be no bogles here, Neil; for it's not\n\nlikely they would fash themselves to frighten geese.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay?\" says Andie, \"is that what ye think of it!  But I'll can tell\n\nye there's been waur nor bogles here.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's waur than bogles, Andie?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Warlocks,\" said he.  \"Or a warlock at the least of it.  And that's\n\na queer tale, too,\" he added.  \"And if ye would like, I'll tell it\n\nye.\"\n\n\n\nTo be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander\n\nthat had the least English of the three set himself to listen with\n\nall his might.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\n\n\n\nMY faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring lad\n\nin his young days, wi' little wisdom and little grace.  He was fond\n\nof a lass and fond of a glass, and fond of a ran-dan; but I could\n\nnever hear tell that he was muckle use for honest employment.  Frae\n\nae thing to anither, he listed at last for a sodger and was in the\n\ngarrison of this fort, which was the first way that ony of the\n\nDales cam to set foot upon the Bass.  Sorrow upon that service!\n\nThe governor brewed his ain ale; it seems it was the warst\n\nconceivable.  The rock was proveesioned free the shore with vivers,\n\nthe thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles when they but to\n\nfish and shoot solans for their diet.  To crown a', thir was the\n\nDays of the Persecution.  The perishin' cauld chalmers were all\n\noccupeed wi' sants and martyrs, the saut of the yearth, of which it\n\nwasnae worthy.  And though Tam Dale carried a firelock there, a\n\nsingle sodger, and liked a lass and a glass, as I was sayin,' the\n\nmind of the man was mair just than set with his position.  He had\n\nglints of the glory of the kirk; there were whiles when his dander\n\nrase to see the Lord's sants misguided, and shame covered him that\n\nhe should be haulding a can'le (or carrying a firelock) in so black\n\na business.  There were nights of it when he was here on sentry,\n\nthe place a' wheesht, the frosts o' winter maybe riving in the\n\nwa's, and he would hear ane o' the prisoners strike up a psalm, and\n\nthe rest join in, and the blessed sounds rising from the different\n\nchalmers--or dungeons, I would raither say--so that this auld craig\n\nin the sea was like a pairt of Heev'n.  Black shame was on his\n\nsaul; his sins hove up before him muckle as the Bass, and above a',\n\nthat chief sin, that he should have a hand in hagging and hashing\n\nat Christ's Kirk.  But the truth is that he resisted the spirit.\n\nDay cam, there were the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves\n\ndepairtit.\n\n\n\nIn thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet\n\nwas his name.  Ye'll have heard tell of Prophet Peden.  There was\n\nnever the wale of him sinsyne, and it's a question wi' mony if\n\nthere ever was his like afore.  He was wild's a peat-hag, fearsome\n\nto look at, fearsome to hear, his face like the day of judgment.\n\nThe voice of him was like a solan's and dinnle'd in folks' lugs,\n\nand the words of him like coals of fire.\n\n\n\nNow there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little to do,\n\nfor it was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she was bonny,\n\nand her and Tam Dale were very well agreed.  It befell that Peden\n\nwas in the gairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass\n\ncam by; and what should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the\n\nsant's devotions?  He rose and lookit at the twa o' them, and Tam's\n\nknees knoitered thegether at the look of him.  But whan he spak, it\n\nwas mair in sorrow than in anger.  'Poor thing, poor thing!\" says\n\nhe, and it was the lass he lookit at, \"I hear you skirl and laugh,\"\n\nhe says, \"but the Lord has a deid shot prepared for you, and at\n\nthat surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the ae time!\"  Shortly\n\nthereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi' twa-three sodgers,\n\nand it was a blawy day.  There cam a gowst of wind, claught her by\n\nthe coats, and awa' wi' her bag and baggage.  And it was remarked\n\nby the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl.\n\n\n\nNae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it\n\npassed again and him none the better.  Ae day he was flyting wi'\n\nanither sodger-lad.  \"Deil hae me!\" quo' Tam, for he was a profane\n\nswearer.  And there was Peden glowering at him, gash an' waefu';\n\nPeden wi' his lang chafts an' luntin' een, the maud happed about\n\nhis kist, and the hand of him held out wi' the black nails upon the\n\nfinger-nebs--for he had nae care of the body.  \"Fy, fy, poor man!\"\n\ncries he, \"the poor fool man!  DEIL HAE ME, quo' he; an' I see the\n\ndeil at his oxter.\"  The conviction of guilt and grace cam in on\n\nTam like the deep sea; he flang doun the pike that was in his\n\nhands--\"I will nae mair lift arms against the cause o' Christ!\"\n\nsays he, and was as gude's word.  There was a sair fyke in the\n\nbeginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved, gied him his\n\ndischarge, and he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick, and\n\nhad aye a gude name with honest folk free that day on.\n\n\n\nIt was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in\n\nthe hands o' the Da'rymples, and there was twa men soucht the\n\nchairge of it.  Baith were weel qualified, for they had baith been\n\nsodgers in the garrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and\n\nthe seasons and values of them.  Forby that they were baith--or\n\nthey baith seemed--earnest professors and men of comely\n\nconversation.  The first of them was just Tam Dale, my faither.\n\nThe second was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca'd Tod Lapraik maistly,\n\nbut whether for his name or his nature I could never hear tell.\n\nWeel, Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business, and took me, that\n\nwas a toddlin' laddie, by the hand.  Tod had his dwallin' in the\n\nlang loan benorth the kirkyaird.  It's a dark uncanny loan, forby\n\nthat the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o' James the\n\nSaxt and the deevil's cantrips played therein when the Queen was on\n\nthe seas; and as for Tod's house, it was in the mirkest end, and\n\nwas little liked by some that kenned the best.  The door was on the\n\nsneck that day, and me and my faither gaed straucht in.  Tod was a\n\nwabster to his trade; his loom stood in the but.  There he sat, a\n\nmuckle fat, white hash of a man like creish, wi' a kind of a holy\n\nsmile that gart me scunner.  The hand of him aye cawed the shuttle,\n\nbut his een was steeked.  We cried to him by his name, we skirted\n\nin the deid lug of him, we shook him by the shou'ther.  Nae mainner\n\no' service!  There he sat on his dowp, an' cawed the shuttle and\n\nsmiled like creish.\n\n\n\n\"God be guid to us,\" says Tam Dale, \"this is no canny?\"\n\n\n\nHe had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel'.\n\n\n\n\"Is this you, Tam?\" says he.  \"Haith, man!  I'm blythe to see ye.\n\nI whiles fa' into a bit dwam like this,\" he says; \"its frae the\n\nstamach.\"\n\n\n\nWeel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was\n\nto get the warding o't, and little by little cam to very ill words,\n\nand twined in anger.  I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed\n\nhame again, he cam ower and ower the same expression, how little he\n\nlikit Tod Lapraik and his dwams.\n\n\n\n\"Dwam!\" says he.  \"I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.\"\n\n\n\nAweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin'.  It was\n\nremembered sinsyne what way he had ta'en the thing.  \"Tam,\" says\n\nhe, \"ye hae gotten the better o' me aince mair, and I hope,\" says\n\nhe, \"ye'll find at least a' that ye expeckit at the Bass.\"  Which\n\nhave since been thought remarkable expressions.  At last the time\n\ncame for Tam Dale to take young solans.  This was a business he was\n\nweel used wi', he had been a craigsman frae a laddie, and trustit\n\nnane but himsel'.  So there was he hingin' by a line an' speldering\n\non the craig face, whaur its hieest and steighest.  Fower tenty\n\nlads were on the tap, hauldin' the line and mindin' for his\n\nsignals.  But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the craig, and\n\nthe sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying.  It was a braw\n\nspring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young geese.\n\nMony's the time I've heard him tell of this experience, and aye the\n\nswat ran upon the man.\n\n\n\nIt chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a\n\nmuckle solan, and the solan pyking at the line.  He thocht this by-\n\nordinar and outside the creature's habits.  He minded that ropes\n\nwas unco saft things, and the solan's neb and the Bass Rock unco\n\nhard, and that twa hunner feet were raither mair than he would care\n\nto fa'.\n\n\n\n\"Shoo!\" says Tam.  \"Awa', bird!  Shoo, awa' wi' ye!\" says he.\n\n\n\nThe solan keekit doon into Tam's face, and there was something unco\n\nin the creature's ee.  Just the ae keek it gied, and back to the\n\nrope.  But now it wroucht and warstl't like a thing dementit.\n\nThere never was the solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht;\n\nand it seemed to understand its employ brawly, birzing the saft\n\nrope between the neb of it and a crunkled jag o' stane.\n\n\n\nThere gaed a cauld stend o' fear into Tam's heart.  \"This thing is\n\nnae bird,\" thinks he.  His een turnt backward in his heid and the\n\nday gaed black aboot him.  \"If I get a dwam here,\" he toucht, \"it's\n\nby wi' Tam Dale.\"  And he signalled for the lads to pu' him up.\n\n\n\nAnd it seemed the solan understood about signals.  For nae sooner\n\nwas the signal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings,\n\nsquawked out loud, took a turn flying, and dashed straucht at Tam\n\nDale's een.  Tam had a knife, he gart the cauld steel glitter.  And\n\nit seemed the solan understood about knives, for nae suner did the\n\nsteel glint in the sun than he gied the ae squawk, but laighter,\n\nlike a body disappointit, and flegged aff about the roundness of\n\nthe craig, and Tam saw him nae mair.  And as sune as that thing was\n\ngane, Tam's heid drapt upon his shouther, and they pu'd him up like\n\na deid corp, dadding on the craig.\n\n\n\nA dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to his\n\nmind, or what was left of it.  Up he sat.\n\n\n\n\"Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak' sure of the boat, man--rin!\"\n\nhe cries, \"or yon solan'll have it awa',\" says he.\n\n\n\nThe fower lads stared at ither, an' tried to whilly-wha him to be\n\nquiet.  But naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o' them had\n\nstartit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat.  The ithers askit if\n\nhe was for down again.\n\n\n\n\"Na,\" says he, \"and niether you nor me,\" says he, \"and as sune as I\n\ncan win to stand on my twa feet we'll be aff frae this craig o'\n\nSawtan.\"\n\n\n\nSure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for\n\nbefore they won to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever.  He lay\n\na' the simmer; and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him, but\n\nTod Lapraik!  Folk thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near\n\nthe house the fever had worsened.  I kenna for that; but what I ken\n\nthe best, that was the end of it.\n\n\n\nIt was about this time o' the year; my grandfaither was out at the\n\nwhite fishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi' him.  We had a\n\ngrand take, I mind, and the way that the fish lay broucht us near\n\nin by the Bass, whaur we foregaithered wi' anither boat that\n\nbelanged to a man Sandie Fletcher in Castleton.  He's no lang deid\n\nneither, or ye could speir at himsel'.  Weel, Sandie hailed.\n\n\n\n\"What's yon on the Bass?\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"On the Bass?\" says grandfaither.\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" says Sandie, \"on the green side o't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whatten kind of a thing?\" says grandfaither.  \"There cannae be\n\nnaething on the Bass but just the sheep.\"\n\n\n\n\"It looks unco like a body,\" quo' Sandie, who was nearer in.\n\n\n\n\"A body!\" says we, and we none of us likit that.  For there was nae\n\nboat that could have brought a man, and the key o' the prison yett\n\nhung ower my faither's at hame in the press bed.\n\n\n\nWe keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer hand.\n\nGrandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and the captain\n\nof a smack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay.  And when we took\n\nthe glass to it, sure eneuch there was a man.  He was in a crunkle\n\no' green brae, a wee below the chaipel, a' by his lee lane, and\n\nlowped and flang and danced like a daft quean at a waddin'.\n\n\n\n\"It's Tod,\" says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sandie.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, it's him,\" says Sandie.\n\n\n\n\"Or ane in the likeness o' him,\" says grandfaither.\n\n\n\n\"Sma' is the differ,\" quo' Sandie.  \"De'il or warlock, I'll try the\n\ngun at him,\" quo' he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that he aye\n\ncarried, for Sandie was a notable famous shot in all that country.\n\n\n\n\"Haud your hand, Sandie,\" says grandfaither; \"we maun see clearer\n\nfirst,\" says he, \"or this may be a dear day's wark to the baith of\n\nus.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hout!\" says Sandie, \"this is the Lord's judgment surely, and be\n\ndamned to it,\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe ay, and maybe no,\" says my grandfaither, worthy man!  \"But\n\nhave you a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye'll have\n\nforegaithered wi' before,\" says he.\n\n\n\nThis was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee.  \"Aweel,\n\nEdie,\" says he, \"and what would be your way of it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ou, just this,\" says grandfaither.  \"Let me that has the fastest\n\nboat gang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep an\n\neye on Thon.  If I cannae find Lapraik, I'll join ye and the twa of\n\nus'll have a crack wi' him.  But if Lapraik's at hame, I'll rin up\n\nthe flag at the harbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi' the gun.\"\n\n\n\nAweel, so it was agreed between them twa.  I was just a bairn, an'\n\nclum in Sandie's boat, whaur I thoucht I would see the best of the\n\nemploy.  My grandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun\n\nwi' the leid draps, bein mair deidly again bogles.  And then the as\n\nboat set aff for North Berwick, an' the tither lay whaur it was and\n\nwatched the wanchancy thing on the brae-side.\n\n\n\nA' the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span\n\nlike a teetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span.\n\nI hae seen lassies, the daft queans, that would lowp and dance a\n\nwinter's nicht, and still be lowping and dancing when the winter's\n\nday cam in.  But there would be fowk there to hauld them company,\n\nand the lads to egg them on; and this thing was its lee-lane.  And\n\nthere would be a fiddler diddling his elbock in the chimney-side;\n\nand this thing had nae music but the skirling of the solans.  And\n\nthe lassies were bits o' young things wi' the reid life dinnling\n\nand stending in their members; and this was a muckle, fat, creishy\n\nman, and him fa'n in the vale o' years.  Say what ye like, I maun\n\nsay what I believe.  It was joy was in the creature's heart, the\n\njoy o' hell, I daursay:  joy whatever.  Mony a time I have askit\n\nmysel' why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are\n\ntheir maist dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl't wives or\n\nauld, feckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik\n\ndancing a' the hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart.\n\nNae doubt they burn for it muckle in hell, but they have a grand\n\ntime here of it, whatever!--and the Lord forgie us!\n\n\n\nWeel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-\n\nheid upon the harbour rocks.  That was a' Sandie waited for.  He up\n\nwi' the gun, took a deleeberate aim, an' pu'd the trigger.  There\n\ncam' a bang and then ae waefu' skirl frae the Bass.  And there were\n\nwe rubbin' our een and lookin' at ither like daft folk.  For wi'\n\nthe bang and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared.  The sun\n\nglintit, the wund blew, and there was the bare yaird whaur the\n\nWonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second syne.\n\n\n\nThe hale way hame I roared and grat wi' the terror o' that\n\ndispensation.  The grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there\n\nwas little said in Sandie's boat but just the name of God; and when\n\nwe won in by the pier, the harbour rocks were fair black wi' the\n\nfolk waitin' us.  It seems they had fund Lapraik in ane of his\n\ndwams, cawing the shuttle and smiling.  Ae lad they sent to hoist\n\nthe flag, and the rest abode there in the wabster's house.  You may\n\nbe sure they liked it little; but it was a means of grace to\n\nseverals that stood there praying in to themsel's (for nane cared\n\nto pray out loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed the\n\nshuttle.  Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi' the ae dreidfu' skelloch,\n\nTod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab, a\n\nbluidy corp.\n\n\n\nWhen the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon\n\nthe warlock's body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but there\n\nwas grandfaither's siller tester in the puddock's heart of him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that\n\nhad its consequence.  Neil, as I have said, was himself a great\n\nnarrator.  I have heard since that he knew all the stories in the\n\nHighlands; and thought much of himself, and was thought much of by\n\nothers on the strength of it.  Now Andie's tale reminded him of one\n\nhe had already heard.\n\n\n\n\"She would ken that story afore,\" he said.  \"She was the story of\n\nUistean More M'Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is no sic a thing,\" cried Andie.  \"It is the story of my\n\nfaither (now wi' God) and Tod Lapraik.  And the same in your\n\nbeard,\" says he; \"and keep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant\n\nchafts!\"\n\n\n\nIn dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown in\n\nhistory, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the thing\n\nappears scarce feasible for Lowland commons.  I had already\n\nremarked that Andie was continually on the point of quarrelling\n\nwith our three MacGregors, and now, sure enough, it was to come.\n\n\n\n\"Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans,\" says Neil.\n\n\n\n\"Shentlemans!\" cries Andie.  \"Shentlemans, ye hielant stot!  If God\n\nwould give ye the grace to see yoursel' the way that ithers see ye,\n\nye would throw your denner up.\"\n\n\n\nThere came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black\n\nknife was in his hand that moment.\n\n\n\nThere was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the leg,\n\nand had him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I knew what\n\nI was doing.  His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie and I were\n\nwithout weapons, the Gregara three to two.  It seemed we were\n\nbeyond salvation, when Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering\n\nthe others back, and made his submission to myself in a manner the\n\nmost abject, even giving me up his knife which (upon a repetition\n\nof his promises) I returned to him on the morrow.\n\n\n\nTwo things I saw plain:  the first, that I must not build too high\n\non Andie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there, as pale\n\nas death, till the affair was over; the second, the strength of my\n\nown position with the Highlanders, who must have received\n\nextraordinary charges to be tender of my safety.  But if I thought\n\nAndie came not very well out in courage, I had no fault to find\n\nwith him upon the account of gratitude.  It was not so much that he\n\ntroubled me with thanks, as that his whole mind and manner appeared\n\nchanged; and as he preserved ever after a great timidity of our\n\ncompanions, he and I were yet more constantly together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--THE MISSING WITNESS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I had\n\nmuch rebellion against fate.  The thought of him waiting in the\n\nKing's Arms, and of what he would think, and what he would say when\n\nnext we met, tormented and oppressed me. The truth was\n\nunbelievable, so much I had to grant, and it seemed cruel hard I\n\nshould be posted as a liar and a coward, and have never consciously\n\nomitted what it was possible that I should do.  I repeated this\n\nform of words with a kind of bitter relish, and re-examined in that\n\nlight the steps of my behaviour.  It seemed I had behaved to James\n\nStewart as a brother might; all the past was a picture that I could\n\nbe proud of, and there was only the present to consider.  I could\n\nnot swim the sea, nor yet fly in the air, but there was always\n\nAndie.  I had done him a service, he liked me; I had a lever there\n\nto work on; if it were just for decency, I must try once more with\n\nAndie.\n\n\n\nIt was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the Bass but the\n\nlap and bubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions were all\n\ncrept apart, the three Macgregors higher on the rock, and Andie\n\nwith his Bible to a sunny place among the ruins; there I found him\n\nin deep sleep, and, as soon as he was awake, appealed to him with\n\nsome fervour of manner and a good show of argument.\n\n\n\n\"If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!\" said he, staring at\n\nme over his spectacles.\n\n\n\n\"It's to save another,\" said I, \"and to redeem my word.  What would\n\nbe more good than that?  Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie?  And\n\nyou with the Book upon your lap!  WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT A MAN IF HE\n\nGAIN THE WHOLE WORLD?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" said he, \"that's grand for you.  But where do I come in!  I\n\nhave my word to redeem the same's yoursel'.  And what are ye asking\n\nme to do, but just to sell it ye for siller?\"\n\n\n\n\"Andie! have I named the name of siller?\" cried I.\n\n\n\n\"Ou, the name's naething\", said he; \"the thing is there, whatever.\n\nIt just comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you\n\npropose, I'll lose my lifelihood.  Then it's clear ye'll have to\n\nmake it up to me, and a pickle mair, for your ain credit like.  And\n\nwhat's that but just a bribe?  And if even I was certain of the\n\nbribe!  But by a' that I can learn, it's far frae that; and if YOU\n\nwere to hang, where would _I_ be?  Na:  the thing's no possible.\n\nAnd just awa' wi' ye like a bonny lad! and let Andie read his\n\nchapter.\"\n\n\n\nI remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result;\n\nand the next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of\n\ngratitude to Prestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent,\n\nillegal manner, out of the midst of my dangers, temptations, and\n\nperplexities.  But this was both too flimsy and too cowardly to\n\nlast me long, and the remembrance of James began to succeed to the\n\npossession of my spirits.  The 21st, the day set for the trial, I\n\npassed in such misery of mind as I can scarce recall to have\n\nendured, save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only.  Much of the time I\n\nlay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body motionless, my\n\nmind full of violent thoughts.  Sometimes I slept indeed; but the\n\ncourt-house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to\n\nfind his missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake\n\nagain with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body.  I\n\nthought Andie seemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed.\n\nVerily, my bread was bitter to me, and my days a burthen.\n\n\n\nEarly the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions,\n\nand Andie placed a packet in my hand.  The cover was without\n\naddress but sealed with a Government seal.  It enclosed two notes.\n\n\"Mr. Balfour can now see for himself it is too late to meddle.  His\n\nconduct will be observed and his discretion rewarded.\"  So ran the\n\nfirst, which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand.\n\nThere was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise the\n\nwriter, even if that person could be found; the seal, which\n\nformidably served instead of signature, was affixed to a separate\n\nsheet on which there was no scratch of writing; and I had to\n\nconfess that (so far) my adversaries knew what they were doing, and\n\nto digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the\n\npromise.\n\n\n\nBut the second enclosure was by far the more surprising.  It was in\n\na lady's hand of writ.  \"MAISTER DAUVIT BALFOUR IS INFORMED A\n\nFRIEND WAS SPEIRING FOR HIM AND HER EYES WERE OF THE GREY,\" it ran-\n\n-and seemed so extraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a\n\nmoment and under cover of a Government seal, that I stood stupid.\n\nCatriona's grey eyes shone in my remembrance.  I thought, with a\n\nbound of pleasure, she must be the friend.  But who should the\n\nwriter be, to have her billet thus enclosed with Prestongrange's?\n\nAnd of all wonders, why was it thought needful to give me this\n\npleasing but most inconsequent intelligence upon the Bass?  For the\n\nwriter, I could hit upon none possible except Miss Grant.  Her\n\nfamily, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona's eyes and even\n\nnamed her for their colour; and she herself had been much in the\n\nhabit to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff,\n\nI supposed, at my rusticity.  No doubt, besides, but she lived in\n\nthe same house as this letter came from.  So there remained but one\n\nstep to be accounted for; and that was how Prestongrange should\n\nhave permitted her at all in an affair so secret, or let her daft-\n\nlike billet go in the same cover with his own.  But even here I had\n\na glimmering.  For, first of all, there was something rather\n\nalarming about the young lady, and papa might be more under her\n\ndomination than I knew.  And, second, there was the man's continual\n\npolicy to be remembered, how his conduct had been continually\n\nmingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in the midst of so\n\nmuch contention, laid aside a mask of friendship.  He must conceive\n\nthat my imprisonment had incensed me.  Perhaps this little jesting,\n\nfriendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?\n\n\n\nI will be honest--and I think it did.  I felt a sudden warmth\n\ntowards that beautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much\n\ninterest in my affairs.  The summoning up of Catriona moved me of\n\nitself to milder and more cowardly counsels.  If the Advocate knew\n\nof her and our acquaintance--if I should please him by some of that\n\n\"discretion\" at which his letter pointed--to what might not this\n\nlead!  IN VAIN IS THE NET PREPARED IN THE SIGHT OF ANY FOWL, the\n\nScripture says.  Well, fowls must be wiser than folk!  For I\n\nthought I perceived the policy, and yet fell in with it.\n\n\n\nI was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before\n\nme like two stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing.\n\n\n\n\"I see ye has gotten guid news,\" said he.\n\n\n\nI found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came\n\nbefore me like a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary;\n\nand my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges.  Trials, I\n\nreflected, sometimes draw out longer than is looked for.  Even if I\n\ncame to Inverary just too late, something might yet be attempted in\n\nthe interests of James--and in those of my own character, the best\n\nwould be accomplished.  In a moment, it seemed without thought, I\n\nhad a plan devised.\n\n\n\n\"Andie,\" said I, \"is it still to be to-morrow?\"\n\n\n\nHe told me nothing was changed.\n\n\n\n\"Was anything said about the hour?\" I asked.\n\n\n\nHe told me it was to be two o'clock afternoon.\n\n\n\n\"And about the place?\" I pursued.\n\n\n\n\"Whatten place?\" says Andie.\n\n\n\n\"The place I am to be landed at?\" said I.\n\n\n\nHe owned there was nothing as to that.\n\n\n\n\"Very well, then,\" I said, \"this shall be mine to arrange.  The\n\nwind is in the east, my road lies westward:  keep your boat, I hire\n\nit; let us work up the Forth all day; and land me at two o'clock\n\nto-morrow at the westmost we'll can have reached.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye daft callant!\" he cried; \"ye would try for Inverary after a'!\"\n\n\n\n\"Just that, Andie,\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"Weel, ye're ill to beat!\" says he.  \"And I was a kind o' sorry for\n\nye a' day yesterday,\" he added.  \"Ye see, I was never entirely sure\n\ntill then, which way of it ye really wantit.\"\n\n\n\nHere was a spur to a lame horse!\n\n\n\n\"A word in your ear, Andie,\" said I.  \"This plan of mine has\n\nanother advantage yet.  We can leave these Hielandman behind us on\n\nthe rock, and one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them\n\noff to-morrow.  Yon Neil has a queer eye when he regards you;\n\nmaybe, if I was once out of the gate there might be knives again;\n\nthese red-shanks are unco grudgeful.  And if there should come to\n\nbe any question, here is your excuse.  Our lives were in danger by\n\nthese savages; being answerable for my safety, you chose the part\n\nto bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the\n\ntime on board your boat:  and do you know, Andie?\" says I, with a\n\nsmile, \"I think it was very wisely chosen,\"\n\n\n\n\"The truth is I have nae goo for Neil,\" says Andie, \"nor he for me,\n\nI'm thinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi' the man.\n\nTam Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway.\"\n\n(For this man, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still\n\nspoken.)  \"Ay, ay!\" says Andie, \"Tam'll can deal with them the\n\nbest.  And troth! the mair I think of it, the less I see we would\n\nbe required.  The place--ay, feggs! they had forgot the place.  Eh,\n\nShaws, ye're a lang-heided chield when ye like!  Forby that I'm\n\nawing ye my life,\" he added, with more solemnity, and offered me\n\nhis hand upon the bargain.\n\n\n\nWhereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board the\n\nboat, cast off, and set the lug.  The Gregara were then busy upon\n\nbreakfast, for the cookery was their usual part; but, one of them\n\nstepping to the battlements, our flight was observed before we were\n\ntwenty fathoms from the rock; and the three of them ran about the\n\nruins and the landing-shelf, for all the world like ants about a\n\nbroken nest, hailing and crying on us to return.  We were still in\n\nboth the lee and the shadow of the rock, which last lay broad upon\n\nthe waters, but presently came forth in almost the same moment into\n\nthe wind and sunshine; the sail filled, the boat heeled to the\n\ngunwale, and we swept immediately beyond sound of the men's voices.\n\nTo what terrors they endured upon the rock, where they were now\n\ndeserted without the countenance of any civilised person or so much\n\nas the protection of a Bible, no limit can be set; nor had they any\n\nbrandy left to be their consolation, for even in the haste and\n\nsecrecy of our departure Andie had managed to remove it.\n\n\n\nIt was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the\n\nGlenteithy Rocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be\n\nduly seen to the next day.  Thence we kept away up Firth.  The\n\nbreeze, which was then so spirited, swiftly declined, but never\n\nwholly failed us.  All day we kept moving, though often not much\n\nmore; and it was after dark ere we were up with the Queensferry.\n\nTo keep the letter of Andie's engagement (or what was left of it) I\n\nmust remain on board, but I thought no harm to communicate with the\n\nshore in writing.  On Prestongrange's cover, where the Government\n\nseal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I writ, by\n\nthe boat's lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie carried\n\nthem to Rankeillor.  In about an hour he came again, with a purse\n\nof money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing\n\nsaddled for me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool.  This done,\n\nand the boat riding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep under\n\nthe sail.\n\n\n\nWe were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was\n\nnothing left for me but to sit and wait.  I felt little alacrity\n\nupon my errand.  I would have been glad of any passable excuse to\n\nlay it down; but none being to be found, my uneasiness was no less\n\ngreat than if I had been running to some desired pleasure.  By\n\nshortly after one the horse was at the waterside, and I could see a\n\nman walking it to and fro till I should land, which vastly swelled\n\nmy impatience.  Andie ran the moment of my liberation very fine,\n\nshowing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce serving his\n\nemployers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty seconds after\n\ntwo I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling.  In a\n\nlittle more than an hour I had passed that town, and was already\n\nmounting Alan Water side, when the weather broke in a small\n\ntempest.  The rain blinded me, the wind had nearly beat me from the\n\nsaddle, and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a\n\nwilderness still some way east of Balwhidder, not very sure of my\n\ndirection and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary.\n\n\n\nIn the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance\n\nof a guide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any\n\nhorseman) the line of my journey with Alan.  This I did with open\n\neyes, foreseeing a great risk in it, which the tempest had now\n\nbrought to a reality.  The last that I knew of where I was, I think\n\nit must have been about Uam Var; the hour perhaps six at night.  I\n\nmust still think it great good fortune that I got about eleven to\n\nmy destination, the house of Duncan Dhu.  Where I had wandered in\n\nthe interval perhaps the horse could tell.  I know we were twice\n\ndown, and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in a\n\nroaring burn.  Steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes.\n\n\n\nFrom Duncan I had news of the trial.  It was followed in all these\n\nHighland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from\n\nInverary as swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn\n\nthat, up to a late hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded; and\n\nall men began to suppose it must spread over the Monday.  Under the\n\nspur of this intelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan\n\nhaving agreed to be my guide, took the road again on foot, with the\n\npiece in my hand and munching as I went.  Duncan brought with him a\n\nflask of usquebaugh and a hand-lantern; which last enlightened us\n\njust so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it, for the\n\nthing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust.  The more\n\npart of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain, and day\n\nfound us aimless on the mountains.  Hard by we struck a hut on a\n\nburn-side, where we got bite and a direction; and, a little before\n\nthe end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors of Inverary.\n\n\n\nThe rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was still\n\nbogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I\n\ncould hardly limp, and my face was like a ghost's.  I stood\n\ncertainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on,\n\nthan of all the benefits in Christianity.  For all which (being\n\npersuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately\n\npublic) I set the door of the church with the dirty Duncan at my\n\ntails, and finding a vacant place sat down.\n\n\n\n\"Thirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself must\n\nbe regarded as a means of grace,\" the minister was saying, in the\n\nvoice of one delighting to pursue an argument.\n\n\n\nThe sermon was in English on account of the assize.  The judges\n\nwere present with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered in\n\na corner by the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom\n\nwith the array of lawyers.  The text was in Romans 5th and 13th--\n\nthe minister a skilled hand; and the whole of that able churchful--\n\nfrom Argyle, and my Lords Elchies and Kilkerran, down to the\n\nhalbertmen that came in their attendance--was sunk with gathered\n\nbrows in a profound critical attention.  The minister himself and a\n\nsprinkling of those about the door observed our entrance at the\n\nmoment and immediately forgot the same; the rest either did not\n\nhear or would not hear or would not be heard; and I sat amongst my\n\nfriends and enemies unremarked.\n\n\n\nThe first that I singled out was Prestongrange.  He sat well\n\nforward, like an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with\n\nrelish, his eyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to\n\nhis mind.  Charles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and\n\nlooked harassed and pale.  As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a\n\nblot, and almost a scandal, in the midst of that attentive\n\ncongregation, digging his hands in his pockets, shifting his legs,\n\nclearing his throat, and rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting\n\nout his eyes to right and left, now with a yawn, now with a secret\n\nsmile.  At times, too, he would take the Bible in front of him, run\n\nit through, seem to read a bit, run it through again, and stop and\n\nyawn prodigiously:  the whole as if for exercise.\n\n\n\nIn the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself.  He\n\nsat a second stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible,\n\nscrawled upon it with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered word\n\nto his next neighbour.  The note came to Prestongrange, who gave me\n\nbut the one look; thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine;\n\nthence again to Argyle, where he sat between the other two lords of\n\nsession, and his Grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye.\n\nThe last of those interested in my presence was Charlie Stewart,\n\nand he too began to pencil and hand about dispatches, none of which\n\nI was able to trace to their destination in the crowd.\n\n\n\nBut the passage of these notes had aroused notice; all who were in\n\nthe secret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering\n\ninformation--the rest questions; and the minister himself seemed\n\nquite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir\n\nand whispering.  His voice changed, he plainly faltered, nor did he\n\nagain recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery.\n\nIt would be a puzzle to him till his dying day, why a sermon that\n\nhad gone with triumph through four parts, should this miscarry in\n\nthe fifth.\n\n\n\nAs for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and a good\n\ndeal anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in\n\nmy success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--THE MEMORIAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister's\n\nmouth before Stewart had me by the arm.  We were the first to be\n\nforth of the church, and he made such extraordinary expedition that\n\nwe were safe within the four walls of a house before the street had\n\nbegun to be thronged with the home-going congregation.\n\n\n\n\"Am I yet in time?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Ay and no,\" said he.  \"The case is over; the jury is enclosed, and\n\nwill so kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow in the\n\nmorning, the same as I could have told it my own self three days\n\nago before the play began.  The thing has been public from the\n\nstart.  The panel kent it, 'YE MAY DO WHAT YE WILL FOR ME,'\n\nwhispers he two days ago.  'YE KEN MY FATE BY WHAT THE DUKE OF\n\nARGYLE HAS JUST SAID TO MR. MACINTOSH.'  O, it's been a scandal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The great Agyle he gaed before,\n\nHe gart the cannons and guns to roar,\"\n\n\n\n\n\nand the very macer cried 'Cruachan!'  But now that I have got you\n\nagain I'll never despair.  The oak shall go over the myrtle yet;\n\nwe'll ding the Campbells yet in their own town.  Praise God that I\n\nshould see the day!\"\n\n\n\nHe was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails upon the\n\nfloor that I might have a change of clothes, and incommoded me with\n\nhis assistance as I changed.  What remained to be done, or how I\n\nwas to do it, was what he never told me nor, I believe, so much as\n\nthought of.  \"We'll ding the Campbells yet!\" that was still his\n\novercome.  And it was forced home upon my mind how this, that had\n\nthe externals of a sober process of law, was in its essence a clan\n\nbattle between savage clans.  I thought my friend the Writer none\n\nof the least savage.  Who that had only seen him at a counsel's\n\nback before the Lord Ordinary or following a golf ball and laying\n\ndown his clubs on Bruntsfield links, could have recognised for the\n\nsame person this voluble and violent clansman?\n\n\n\nJames Stewart's counsel were four in number--Sheriffs Brown of\n\nColstoun and Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh, and Mr. Stewart younger\n\nof Stewart Hall.  These were covenanted to dine with the Writer\n\nafter sermon, and I was very obligingly included of the party.  No\n\nsooner the cloth lifted, and the first bowl very artfully\n\ncompounded by Sheriff Miller, than we fell to the subject in hand.\n\nI made a short narration of my seizure and captivity, and was then\n\nexamined and re-examined upon the circumstances of the murder.  It\n\nwill be remembered this was the first time I had had my say out, or\n\nthe matter at all handled, among lawyers; and the consequence was\n\nvery dispiriting to the others and (I must own) disappointing to\n\nmyself.\n\n\n\n\"To sum up,\" said Colstoun, \"you prove that Alan was on the spot;\n\nyou have heard him proffer menaces against Glenure; and though you\n\nassure us he was not the man who fired, you leave a strong\n\nimpression that he was in league with him, and consenting, perhaps\n\nimmediately assisting, in the act.  You show him besides, at the\n\nrisk of his own liberty, actively furthering the criminal's escape.\n\nAnd the rest of your testimony (so far as the least material)\n\ndepends on the bare word of Alan or of James, the two accused.  In\n\nshort, you do not at all break, but only lengthen by one personage,\n\nthe chain that binds our client to the murderer; and I need\n\nscarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather\n\naggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our\n\nstumbling block from the beginning.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am of the same opinion,\" said Sheriff Miller.  \"I think we may\n\nall be very much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most\n\nuncomfortable witness out of our way.  And chiefly, I think, Mr.\n\nBalfour himself might be obliged.  For you talk of a third\n\naccomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my view) has very much the\n\nappearance of a fourth.\"\n\n\n\n\"Allow me, sirs!\" interposed Stewart the Writer.  \"There is another\n\nview.  Here we have a witness--never fash whether material or not--\n\na witness in this cause, kidnapped by that old, lawless, bandit\n\ncrew of the Glengyle Macgregors, and sequestered for near upon a\n\nmonth in a bourock of old ruins on the Bass.  Move that and see\n\nwhat dirt you fling on the proceedings!  Sirs, this is a tale to\n\nmake the world ring with!  It would be strange, with such a grip as\n\nthis, if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon for my client.\"\n\n\n\n\"And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour's cause to-morrow?\" said\n\nStewart Hall.  \"I am much deceived or we should find so many\n\nimpediments thrown in our path, as that James should have been\n\nhanged before we had found a court to hear us.  This is a great\n\nscandal, but I suppose we have none of us forgot a greater still, I\n\nmean the matter of the Lady Grange.  The woman was still in\n\ndurance; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was humanly\n\npossible; and how did he speed? He never got a warrant!  Well,\n\nit'll be the same now; the same weapons will be used.  This is a\n\nscene, gentleman, of clan animosity.  The hatred of the name which\n\nI have the honour to bear, rages in high quarters.  There is\n\nnothing here to be viewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy\n\nCampbell intrigue.\"\n\n\n\nYou may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and I sat for\n\nsome time in the midst of my learned counsel, almost deaved with\n\ntheir talk but extremely little the wiser for its purport.  The\n\nWriter was led into some hot expressions; Colstoun must take him up\n\nand set him right; the rest joined in on different sides, but all\n\npretty noisy; the Duke of Argyle was beaten like a blanket; King\n\nGeorge came in for a few digs in the by-going and a great deal of\n\nrather elaborate defence; and there was only one person that seemed\n\nto be forgotten, and that was James of the Glens.\n\n\n\nThrough all this Mr. Miller sat quiet.  He was a slip of an oldish\n\ngentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a smooth rich voice,\n\nwith an infinite effect of pawkiness, dealing out each word the way\n\nan actor does, to give the most expression possible; and even now,\n\nwhen he was silent, and sat there with his wig laid aside, his\n\nglass in both hands, his mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he\n\nseemed the mere picture of a merry slyness.  It was plain he had a\n\nword to say, and waited for the fit occasion.\n\n\n\nIt came presently.  Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with\n\nsome expression of their duty to their client.  His brother sheriff\n\nwas pleased, I suppose, with the transition.  He took the table in\n\nhis confidence with a gesture and a look.\n\n\n\n\"That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked,\" said\n\nhe.  \"The interest of our client goes certainly before all, but the\n\nworld does not come to an end with James Stewart.\"  Whereat he\n\ncocked his eye.  \"I might condescend, exempli gratia, upon a Mr.\n\nGeorge Brown, a Mr. Thomas Miller, and a Mr. David Balfour.  Mr.\n\nDavid Balfour has a very good ground of complaint, and I think,\n\ngentlemen--if his story was properly redd out--I think there would\n\nbe a number of wigs on the green.\"\n\n\n\nThe whole table turned to him with a common movement.\n\n\n\n\"Properly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story that could\n\nscarcely fail to have some consequence,\" he continued.  \"The whole\n\nadministration of justice, from its highest officer downward, would\n\nbe totally discredited; and it looks to me as if they would need to\n\nbe replaced.\"  He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it.  \"And\n\nI need not point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour's would be a\n\nremarkable bonny cause to appear in,\" he added.\n\n\n\nWell, there they all were started on another hare; Mr. Balfour's\n\ncause, and what kind of speeches could be there delivered, and what\n\nofficials could be thus turned out, and who would succeed to their\n\npositions.  I shall give but the two specimens.  It was proposed to\n\napproach Simon Fraser, whose testimony, if it could be obtained,\n\nwould prove certainly fatal to Argyle and to Prestongrange.  Miller\n\nhighly approved of the attempt.  \"We have here before us a dreeping\n\nroast,\" said he, \"here is cut-and-come-again for all.\"  And\n\nmethought all licked their lips.  The other was already near the\n\nend.  Stewart the Writer was out of the body with delight, smelling\n\nvengeance on his chief enemy, the Duke.\n\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried he, charging his glass, \"here is to Sheriff\n\nMiller.  His legal abilities are known to all.  His culinary, this\n\nbowl in front of us is here to speak for.  But when it comes to the\n\npoleetical!\"--cries he, and drains the glass.\n\n\n\n\"Ay, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning, my friend,\"\n\nsaid the gratified Miller.  \"A revolution, if you like, and I think\n\nI can promise you that historical writers shall date from Mr.\n\nBalfour's cause.  But properly guided, Mr. Stewart, tenderly\n\nguided, it shall prove a peaceful revolution.\"\n\n\n\n\"And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed, what care I?\"\n\ncries Stewart, smiting down his fist.\n\n\n\nIt will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this,\n\nthough I could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in\n\nthese old intriguers.  But it was not my view to have undergone so\n\nmany sorrows for the advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a\n\nrevolution in the Parliament House:  and I interposed accordingly\n\nwith as much simplicity of manner as I could assume.\n\n\n\n\"I have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,\" said I.  \"And\n\nnow I would like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions.\n\nThere is one thing that has fallen rather on one aide, for\n\ninstance:  Will this cause do any good to our friend James of the\n\nGlens?\"\n\n\n\nThey seemed all a hair set back, and gave various answers, but\n\nconcurring practically in one point, that James had now no hope but\n\nin the King's mercy.\n\n\n\n\"To proceed, then,\" said I, \"will it do any good to Scotland?  We\n\nhave a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest.  I\n\nremember hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant\n\nchild, which gave occasion to the late Queen to call this country\n\nbarbarous; and I always understood that we had rather lost than\n\ngained by that.  Then came the year 'Forty-five, which made\n\nScotland to be talked of everywhere; but I never heard it said we\n\nhad anyway gained by the 'Forty-five.  And now we come to this\n\ncause of Mr. Balfour's, as you call it.  Sheriff Miller tells us\n\nhistorical writers are to date from it, and I would not wonder.  It\n\nis only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and\n\npublic reproach.\"\n\n\n\nThe nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling\n\nto, and made haste to get on the same road.  \"Forcibly put, Mr.\n\nBalfour,\" says he.  \"A weighty observe, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George,\"\n\nI pursued.  \"Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this; but I\n\ndoubt you will scarce be able to pull down the house from under\n\nhim, without his Majesty coming by a knock or two, one of which\n\nmight easily prove fatal.\"\n\n\n\nI have them a chance to answer, but none volunteered.\n\n\n\n\"Of those for whom the case was to be profitable,\" I went on,\n\n\"Sheriff Miller gave us the names of several, among the which he\n\nwas good enough to mention mine.  I hope he will pardon me if I\n\nthink otherwise.  I believe I hung not the least back in this\n\naffair while there was life to be saved; but I own I thought myself\n\nextremely hazarded, and I own I think it would be a pity for a\n\nyoung man, with some idea of coming to the Bar, to ingrain upon\n\nhimself the character of a turbulent, factious fellow before he was\n\nyet twenty.  As for James, it seems--at this date of the\n\nproceedings, with the sentence as good as pronounced--he has no\n\nhope but in the King's mercy.  May not his Majesty, then, be more\n\npointedly addressed, the characters of these high officers\n\nsheltered from the public, and myself kept out of a position which\n\nI think spells ruin for me?\"\n\n\n\nThey all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see they\n\nfound my attitude on the affair unpalatable.  But Miller was ready\n\nat all events.\n\n\n\n\"If I may be allowed to put my young friend's notion in more formal\n\nshape,\" says he, \"I understand him to propose that we should embody\n\nthe fact of his sequestration, and perhaps some heads of the\n\ntestimony he was prepared to offer, in a memorial to the Crown.\n\nThis plan has elements of success.  It is as likely as any other\n\n(and perhaps likelier) to help our client.  Perhaps his Majesty\n\nwould have the goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all\n\nconcerned in such a memorial, which might be construed into an\n\nexpression of a very delicate loyalty; and I think, in the drafting\n\nof the same, this view might be brought forward.\"\n\n\n\nThey all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for the former\n\nalternative was doubtless more after their inclination.\n\n\n\n\"Paper, then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,\" pursued Miller; \"and I\n\nthink it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here\n\npresent, as procurators for the condemned man.\"'\n\n\n\n\"It can do none of us any harm, at least,\" says Colstoun, heaving\n\nanother sigh, for he had seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten\n\nminutes.\n\n\n\nThereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically, to draft\n\nthe memorial--a process in the course of which they soon caught\n\nfire; and I had no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an\n\noccasional question.  The paper was very well expressed; beginning\n\nwith a recitation of the facts about myself, the reward offered for\n\nmy apprehension, my surrender, the pressure brought to bear upon\n\nme; my sequestration; and my arrival at Inverary in time to be too\n\nlate; going on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public\n\ninterest for which it was agreed to waive any right of action; and\n\nwinding up with a forcible appeal to the King's mercy on behalf of\n\nJames.\n\n\n\nMethought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented in\n\nthe light of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had\n\nrestrained with difficulty from extremes.  But I let it pass, and\n\nmade but the one suggestion, that I should be described as ready to\n\ndeliver my own evidence and adduce that of others before any\n\ncommission of inquiry--and the one demand, that I should be\n\nimmediately furnished with a copy.\n\n\n\nColstoun hummed and hawed.  \"This is a very confidential document,\"\n\nsaid he.\n\n\n\n\"And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar,\" I\n\nreplied.  \"No question but I must have touched his heart at our\n\nfirst interview, so that he has since stood my friend consistently.\n\nBut for him, gentlemen, I must now be lying dead or awaiting my\n\nsentence alongside poor James.  For which reason I choose to\n\ncommunicate to him the fact of this memorial as soon as it is\n\ncopied.  You are to consider also that this step will make for my\n\nprotection.  I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard; his\n\nGrace is in his own country, Lovat by his side; and if there should\n\nhang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well\n\nawake in gaol.\"\n\n\n\nNot finding any very ready answer to these considerations, my\n\ncompany of advisers were at the last persuaded to consent, and made\n\nonly this condition that I was to lay the paper before\n\nPrestongrange with the express compliments of all concerned.\n\n\n\nThe Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace.  By the hand\n\nof one of Colstoun's servants I sent him a billet asking for an\n\ninterview, and received a summons to meet him at once in a private\n\nhouse of the town.  Here I found him alone in a chamber; from his\n\nface there was nothing to be gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant\n\nbut what I spied some halberts in the hall, and not so stupid but\n\nwhat I could gather he was prepared to arrest me there and then,\n\nshould it appear advisable.\n\n\n\n\"So, Mr. David, this is you?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Where I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,\" said I.  \"And I\n\nwould like before I go further to express my sense of your\n\nlordship's good offices, even should they now cease.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have heard of your gratitude before,\" he replied drily, \"and I\n\nthink this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to\n\nlisten to.  I would remember also, if I were you, that you still\n\nstand on a very boggy foundation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not now, my lord, I think,\" said I; \"and if your lordship will but\n\nglance an eye along this, you will perhaps think as I do.\"\n\n\n\nHe read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then turned back\n\nto one part and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the\n\neffect of.  His face a little lightened.\n\n\n\n\"This is not so bad but what it might be worse,\" said he; \"though I\n\nam still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David\n\nBalfour.\"\n\n\n\n\"Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man, my lord,\"\n\nsaid I.\n\n\n\nHe still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits seemed to\n\nmend.\n\n\n\n\"And to whom am I indebted for this?\" he asked presently.  \"Other\n\ncounsels must have been discussed, I think.  Who was it proposed\n\nthis private method?  Was it Miller?\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord, it was myself,\" said I.  \"These gentlemen have shown me\n\nno such consideration, as that I should deny myself any credit I\n\ncan fairly claim, or spare them any responsibility they should\n\nproperly bear.  And the mere truth is, that they were all in favour\n\nof a process which should have remarkable consequences in the\n\nParliament House, and prove for them (in one of their own\n\nexpressions) a dripping roast.  Before I intervened, I think they\n\nwere on the point of sharing out the different law appointments.\n\nOur friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some composition.\"\n\n\n\nPrestongrange smiled.  \"These are our friends,\" said he.  \"And what\n\nwere your reasons for dissenting, Mr. David?\"\n\n\n\nI told them without concealment, expressing, however, with more\n\nforce and volume those which regarded Prestongrange himself.\n\n\n\n\"You do me no more than justice,\" said he.  \"I have fought as hard\n\nin your interest as you have fought against mine.  And how came you\n\nhere to-day?\" he asked.  \"As the case drew out, I began to grow\n\nuneasy that I had clipped the period so fine, and I was even\n\nexpecting you to-morrow.  But to-day--I never dreamed of it.\"\n\n\n\nI was not of course, going to betray Andie.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,\" said I\n\n\n\n\"If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted\n\nlonger of the Bass,\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"Speaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.\"  And I gave him\n\nthe enclosure in the counterfeit hand.\n\n\n\n\"There was the cover also with the seal,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I have it not,\" said I.  \"It bore not even an address, and could\n\nnot compromise a cat.  The second enclosure I have, and with your\n\npermission, I desire to keep it.\"\n\n\n\nI thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the point.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he resumed, \"our business here is to be finished, and\n\nI proceed by Glasgow.  I would be very glad to have you of my\n\nparty, Mr David.\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord . . .\" I began.\n\n\n\n\"I do not deny it will be of service to me,\" he interrupted.  \"I\n\ndesire even that, when we shall come to Edinburgh, you should\n\nalight at my house.  You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants,\n\nwho will be overjoyed to have you to themselves.  If you think I\n\nhave been of use to you, you can thus easily repay me, and so far\n\nfrom losing, may reap some advantage by the way.  It is not every\n\nstrange young man who is presented in society by the King's\n\nAdvocate.\"\n\n\n\nOften enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman had\n\ncaused my head to spin; no doubt but what for a moment he did so\n\nagain now.  Here was the old fiction still maintained of my\n\nparticular favour with his daughters, one of whom had been so good\n\nas to laugh at me, while the other two had scarce deigned to remark\n\nthe fact of my existence.  And now I was to ride with my lord to\n\nGlasgow; I was to dwell with him in Edinburgh; I was to be brought\n\ninto society under his protection!  That he should have so much\n\ngood-nature as to forgive me was surprising enough; that he could\n\nwish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible; and I began to\n\nseek some ulterior meaning.  One was plain.  If I became his guest,\n\nrepentance was excluded; I could never think better of my present\n\ndesign and bring any action.  And besides, would not my presence in\n\nhis house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial?  For that\n\ncomplaint could not be very seriously regarded, if the person\n\nchiefly injured was the guest of the official most incriminated.\n\nAs I thought upon this I could not quite refrain from smiling.\n\n\n\n\"This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"You are cunning, Mr. David,\" said he, \"and you do not wholly guess\n\nwrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence.  Perhaps,\n\nhowever, you underrate friendly sentiments, which are perfectly\n\ngenuine.  I have a respect for you, David, mingled with awe,\" says\n\nhe, smiling.\n\n\n\n\"I am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to meet your\n\nwishes,\" said I.  \"It is my design to be called to the Bar, where\n\nyour lordship's countenance would be invaluable; and I am besides\n\nsincerely grateful to yourself and family for different marks of\n\ninterest and of indulgence.  The difficulty is here.  There is one\n\npoint in which we pull two ways.  You are trying to hang James\n\nStewart, I am trying to save him.  In so far as my riding with you\n\nwould better your lordship's defence, I am at your lordships\n\norders; but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart, you\n\nsee me at a stick.\"\n\n\n\nI thought he swore to himself.  \"You should certainly be called;\n\nthe Bar is the true scene for your talents,\" says he, bitterly, and\n\nthen fell a while silent.  \"I will tell you,\" he presently resumed,\n\n\"there is no question of James Stewart, for or against, James is a\n\ndead man; his life is given and taken--bought (if you like it\n\nbetter) and sold; no memorial can help--no defalcation of a\n\nfaithful Mr. David hurt him.  Blow high, blow low, there will be no\n\npardon for James Stewart:  and take that for said!  The question is\n\nnow of myself:  am I to stand or fall? and I do not deny to you\n\nthat I am in some danger.  But will Mr. David Balfour consider why?\n\nIt is not because I pushed the case unduly against James; for that,\n\nI am sure of condonation.  And it is not because I have sequestered\n\nMr. David on a rock, though it will pass under that colour; but\n\nbecause I did not take the ready and plain path, to which I was\n\npressed repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or to the\n\ngallows.  Hence the scandal--hence this damned memorial,\" striking\n\nthe paper on his leg.  \"My tenderness for you has brought me in\n\nthis difficulty.  I wish to know if your tenderness to your own\n\nconscience is too great to let you help me out of it.\"\n\n\n\nNo doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said; if James\n\nwas past helping, whom was it more natural that I should turn to\n\nhelp than just the man before me, who had helped myself so often,\n\nand was even now setting me a pattern of patience?  I was besides\n\nnot only weary, but beginning to be ashamed, of my perpetual\n\nattitude of suspicion and refusal\n\n\n\n\"If you will name the time and place, I will be punctually ready to\n\nattend your lordship,\" said I.\n\n\n\nHe shook hands with me.  \"And I think my misses have some news for\n\nyou,\" says he, dismissing me.\n\n\n\nI came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made, yet a little\n\nconcerned in conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went\n\nback, whether, perhaps, I had not been a scruple too good-natured.\n\nBut there was the fact, that this was a man that might have been my\n\nfather, an able man, a great dignitary, and one that, in the hour\n\nof my need, had reached a hand to my assistance.  I was in the\n\nbetter humour to enjoy the remainder of that evening, which I\n\npassed with the advocates, in excellent company no doubt, but\n\nperhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch:  for though I\n\nwent early to bed I have no clear mind of how I got there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--THE TEE'D BALL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the morrow, from the justices' private room, where none could\n\nsee me, I heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon\n\nJames.  The Duke's words I am quite sure I have correctly; and\n\nsince that famous passage has been made a subject of dispute, I may\n\nas well commemorate my version.  Having referred to the year '45,\n\nthe chief of the Campbells, sitting as Justice-General upon the\n\nbench, thus addressed the unfortunate Stewart before him:  \"If you\n\nhad been successful in that rebellion, you might have been giving\n\nthe law where you have now received the judgment of it; we, who are\n\nthis day your judges, might have been tried before one of your mock\n\ncourts of judicature; and then you might have been satiated with\n\nthe blood of any name or clan to which you had an aversion.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed,\" thought I.  And\n\nthat was the general impression.  It was extraordinary how the\n\nyoung advocate lads took hold and made a mock of this speech, and\n\nhow scarce a meal passed but what someone would get in the words:\n\n\"And then you might have been satiated.\"  Many songs were made in\n\ntime for the hour's diversion, and are near all forgot.  I remember\n\none began:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?\n\nIs it a name, or is it a clan,\n\nOr is it an aefauld Hielandman,\n\nThat ye want the bluid of, bluid of?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother went to my old favourite air, The House of Airlie, and\n\nbegan thus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,\n\nThat they served him a Stewart for his denner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd one of the verses ran:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Then up and spak' the Duke, and flyted on his cook,\n\nI regard it as a sensible aspersion,\n\nThat I would sup ava', an' satiate my maw,\n\nWith the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJames was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-\n\npiece and stalked him.  So much of course I knew:  but others knew\n\nnot so much, and were more affected by the items of scandal that\n\ncame to light in the progress of the cause.  One of the chief was\n\ncertainly this sally of the justice's.  It was run hard by another\n\nof a juryman, who had struck into the midst of Coulston's speech\n\nfor the defence with a \"Pray, sir, cut it short, we are quite\n\nweary,\" which seemed the very excess of impudence and simplicity.\n\nBut some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered with an\n\ninnovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings.\n\nOne witness was never called.  His name, indeed, was printed, where\n\nit may still be seen on the fourth page of the list:  \"James\n\nDrummond, alias Macgregor, alias James More, late tenant in\n\nInveronachile\"; and his precognition had been taken, as the manner\n\nis, in writing.  He had remembered or invented (God help him)\n\nmatter which was lead in James Stewart's shoes, and I saw was like\n\nto prove wings to his own.  This testimony it was highly desirable\n\nto bring to the notice of the jury, without exposing the man\n\nhimself to the perils of cross-examination; and the way it was\n\nbrought about was a matter of surprise to all.  For the paper was\n\nhanded round (like a curiosity) in court; passed through the jury-\n\nbox, where it did its work; and disappeared again (as though by\n\naccident) before it reached the counsel for the prisoner.  This was\n\ncounted a most insidious device; and that the name of James More\n\nshould be mingled up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and\n\nconcern for myself.\n\n\n\nThe following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable\n\ncompany, set out for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued\n\nto linger some time in a mixture of pleasure and affairs.  I lodged\n\nwith my lord, with whom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my\n\nplace at entertainments; was presented to the chief guests; and\n\naltogether made more of than I thought accorded either with my\n\nparts or station; so that, on strangers being present, I would\n\noften blush for Prestongrange.  It must be owned the view I had\n\ntaken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a gloom\n\nupon my character.  I had met many men, some of them leaders in\n\nIsrael whether by their birth or talents; and who among them all\n\nhad shown clean hands?  As for the Browns and Millers, I had seen\n\ntheir self-seeking, I could never again respect them.\n\nPrestongrange was the best yet; he had saved me, spared me rather,\n\nwhen others had it in their minds to murder me outright; but the\n\nblood of James lay at his door; and I thought his present\n\ndissimulation with myself a thing below pardon.  That he should\n\naffect to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me out of\n\nmy patience.  I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow fire\n\nof anger in my bowels.  \"Ah, friend, friend,\" I would think to\n\nmyself, \"if you were but through with this affair of the memorial,\n\nwould you not kick me in the streets?\"  Here I did him, as events\n\nhave proved, the most grave injustice; and I think he was at once\n\nfar more sincere, and a far more artful performer, than I supposed.\n\n\n\nBut I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that\n\ncourt of young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage.\n\nThe sudden favour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at\n\nfirst out of measure; but two days were not gone by before I found\n\nmyself surrounded with flattery and attention.  I was the same\n\nyoung man, and neither better nor bonnier, that they had rejected a\n\nmonth before; and now there was no civility too fine for me!  The\n\nsame, do I say?  It was not so; and the by-name by which I went\n\nbehind my back confirmed it.  Seeing me so firm with the Advocate,\n\nand persuaded that I was to fly high and far, they had taken a word\n\nfrom the golfing green, and called me THE TEE'D BALL. {14}  I was\n\ntold I was now \"one of themselves\"; I was to taste of their soft\n\nlining, who had already made my own experience of the roughness of\n\nthe outer husk; and one, to whom I had been presented in Hope Park,\n\nwas so aspired as even to remind me of that meeting.  I told him I\n\nhad not the pleasure of remembering it.\n\n\n\n\"Why\" says he, \"it was Miss Grant herself presented me!  My name is\n\nso-and-so.\"\n\n\n\n\"It may very well be, sir,\" said I; \"but I have kept no mind of\n\nit.\"\n\n\n\nAt which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly\n\noverflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure.\n\n\n\nBut I have not patience to dwell upon that time at length.  When I\n\nwas in company with these young politics I was borne down with\n\nshame for myself and my own plain ways, and scorn for them and\n\ntheir duplicity.  Of the two evils, I thought Prestongrange to be\n\nthe least; and while I was always as stiff as buckram to the young\n\nbloods, I made rather a dissimulation of my hard feelings towards\n\nthe Advocate, and was (in old Mr. Campbell's word) \"soople to the\n\nlaird.\"  Himself commented on the difference, and bid me be more of\n\nmy age, and make friends with my young comrades.\n\n\n\nI told him I was slow of making friends.\n\n\n\n\"I will take the word back,\" said he.  \"But there is such a thing\n\nas FAIR GUDE S'EN AND FAIR GUDE DAY, Mr. David.  These are the same\n\nyoung men with whom you are to pass your days and get through life:\n\nyour backwardness has a look of arrogance; and unless you can\n\nassume a little more lightness of manner, I fear you will meet\n\ndifficulties in the path.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow's ear,\" said\n\nI.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering in\n\nof an express; and getting to my window almost before he had\n\ndismounted, I saw the messenger had ridden hard.  Somewhile after I\n\nwas called to Prestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown\n\nand nightcap, with his letters round him.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. David,\" add he, \"I have a piece of news for you.  It concerns\n\nsome friends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little\n\nashamed, for you have never referred to their existence.\"\n\n\n\nI suppose I blushed.\n\n\n\n\"See you understand, since you make the answering signal,\" said he.\n\n\"And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty.  But\n\ndo you know, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising lass.\n\nShe crops up from every side.  The Government of Scotland appears\n\nunable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat\n\nthe case (no great while back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour.\n\nShould not these make a good match?  Her first intromission in\n\npolitics--but I must not tell you that story, the authorities have\n\ndecided you are to hear it otherwise and from a livelier narrator.\n\nThis new example is more serious, however; and I am afraid I must\n\nalarm you with the intelligence that she is now in prison.\"\n\n\n\nI cried out.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"the little lady is in prison.  But I would not\n\nhave you to despair.  Unless you (with your friends and memorials)\n\nshall procure my downfall, she is to suffer nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\"But what has she done?  What is her offence?\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"It might be almost construed a high treason,\" he returned, \"for\n\nshe has broke the king's Castle of Edinburgh.\"\n\n\n\n\"The lady is much my friend,\" I said.  \"I know you would not mock\n\nme if the thing were serious.\"\n\n\n\n\"And yet it is serious in a sense,\" said he; \"for this rogue of a\n\nKatrine--or Cateran, as we may call her--has set adrift again upon\n\nthe world that very doubtful character, her papa.\"\n\n\n\nHere was one of my previsions justified:  James More was once again\n\nat liberty.  He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he had\n\nvolunteered his testimony in the Appin case, and the same (no\n\nmatter by what subterfuge) had been employed to influence the jury.\n\nNow came his reward, and he was free.  It might please the\n\nauthorities to give to it the colour of an escape; but I knew\n\nbetter--I knew it must be the fulfilment of a bargain.  The same\n\ncourse of thought relieved me of the least alarm for Catriona.  She\n\nmight be thought to have broke prison for her father; she might\n\nhave believed so herself.  But the chief hand in the whole business\n\nwas that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from letting her\n\ncome to punishment, he would not suffer her to be even tried.\n\nWhereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation:\n\n\n\n\"Ah! I was expecting that!\"\n\n\n\n\"You have at times a great deal of discretion, too!\" says\n\nPrestongrange.\n\n\n\n\"And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"I was just marvelling\", he replied, \"that being so clever as to\n\ndraw these inferences, you should not be clever enough to keep them\n\nto yourself.  But I think you would like to hear the details of the\n\naffair.  I have received two versions:  and the least official is\n\nthe more full and far the more entertaining, being from the lively\n\npen of my eldest daughter.  'Here is all the town bizzing with a\n\nfine piece of work,' she writes, 'and what would make the thing\n\nmore noted (if it were only known) the malefactor is a protegee of\n\nhis lordship my papa.  I am sure your heart is too much in your\n\nduty (if it were nothing else) to have forgotten Grey Eyes.  What\n\ndoes she do, but get a broad hat with the flaps open, a long hairy-\n\nlike man's greatcoat, and a big gravatt; kilt her coats up to GUDE\n\nKENS WHAUR, clap two pair of boot-hose upon her legs, take a pair\n\nof CLOUTED BROGUES {15} in her hand, and off to the Castle!  Here\n\nshe gives herself out to be a soutar {16} in the employ of James\n\nMore, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant (who seems to\n\nhave been full of pleasantry) making sport among his soldiers of\n\nthe soutar's greatcoat.  Presently they hear disputation and the\n\nsound of blows inside.  Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the\n\nflaps of his hat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his\n\nsoldiers mock at him as he runs off.  They laughed no so hearty the\n\nnext time they had occasion to visit the cell and found nobody but\n\na tall, pretty, grey-eyed lass in the female habit!  As for the\n\ncobbler, he was 'over the hills ayout Dumblane,' and it's thought\n\nthat poor Scotland will have to console herself without him.  I\n\ndrank Catriona's health this night in public.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the whole town admires her; and I think the beaux would\n\nwear bits of her garters in their button-holes if they could only\n\nget them.  I would have gone to visit her in prison too, only I\n\nremembered in time I was papa's daughter; so I wrote her a billet\n\ninstead, which I entrusted to the faithful Doig, and I hope you\n\nwill admit I can be political when I please.  The same faithful\n\ngomeral is to despatch this letter by the express along with those\n\nof the wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool in company with\n\nSolomon.  Talking of GOMERALS, do tell DAUVIT BALFOUR.  I would I\n\ncould see the face of him at the thought of a long-legged lass in\n\nsuch a predicament; to say nothing of the levities of your\n\naffectionate daughter, and his respectful friend.'  So my rascal\n\nsigns herself!\" continued Prestongrange.  \"And you see, Mr. David,\n\nit is quite true what I tell you, that my daughters regard you with\n\nthe most affectionate playfulness.\"\n\n\n\n\"The gomeral is much obliged,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And was not this prettily done!\" he went on.  \"Is not this\n\nHighland maid a piece of a heroine?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was always sure she had a great heart,\" said I.  \"And I wager\n\nshe guessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon, this is to tread\n\nupon forbidden subjects.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will go bail she did not,\" he returned, quite openly.  \"I will\n\ngo bail she thought she was flying straight into King George's\n\nface.\"\n\n\n\nRemembrance of Catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity,\n\nmoved me strangely.  I could see that even Prestongrange admired,\n\nand could not withhold his lips from smiling when he considered her\n\nbehaviour.  As for Miss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery,\n\nher admiration shone out plain.  A kind of a heat came on me.\n\n\n\n\"I am not your lordship's daughter. . . \" I began.\n\n\n\n\"That I know of!\" he put in, smiling.\n\n\n\n\"I speak like a fool,\" said I; \"or rather I began wrong.  It would\n\ndoubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison; but\n\nfor me, I think I would look like a half-hearted friend if I did\n\nnot fly there instantly.\"\n\n\n\n\"So-ho, Mr. David,\" says he; \"I thought that you and I were in a\n\nbargain?\"\n\n\n\n\"My lord,\" I said, \"when I made that bargain I was a good deal\n\naffected by your goodness, but I'll never can deny that I was moved\n\nbesides by my own interest.  There was self-seeking in my heart,\n\nand I think shame of it now.  It may be for your lordship's safety\n\nto say this fashious Davie Balfour is your friend and housemate.\n\nSay it then; I'll never contradict you.  But as for your patronage,\n\nI give it all back.  I ask but the one thing--let me go, and give\n\nme a pass to see her in her prison.\"\n\n\n\nHe looked at me with a hard eye.  \"You put the cart before the\n\nhorse, I think,\" says he.  \"That which I had given was a portion of\n\nmy liking, which your thankless nature does not seem to have\n\nremarked.  But for my patronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact)\n\nis it yet offered.\"  He paused a bit.  \"And I warn you, you do not\n\nknow yourself,\" he added.  \"Youth is a hasty season; you will think\n\nbetter of all this before a year.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!\" I cried.  \"I\n\nhave seen too much of the other party in these young advocates that\n\nfawn upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me.\n\nAnd I have seen it in the old ones also.  They are all for by-ends,\n\nthe whole clan of them!  It's this that makes me seem to misdoubt\n\nyour lordship's liking.  Why would I think that you would like me?\n\nBut ye told me yourself ye had an interest!\"\n\n\n\nI stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was\n\nobserving me with an unfathomable face.\n\n\n\n\"My lord, I ask your pardon,\" I resumed.  \"I have nothing in my\n\nchafts but a rough country tongue.  I think it would be only\n\ndecent-like if I would go to see my friend in her captivity; but\n\nI'm owing you my life--I'll never forget that; and if it's for your\n\nlordship's good, here I'll stay.  That's barely gratitude.\"\n\n\n\n\"This might have been reached in fewer words,\" says Prestongrange\n\ngrimly.  \"It is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain\n\nScots 'ay'.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!\" cried I.\n\n\"For YOUR sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness that ye say ye\n\nbear to me--for these, I'll consent; but not for any good that\n\nmight be coming to myself.  If I stand aside when this young maid\n\nis in her trial, it's a thing I will be noways advantaged by; I\n\nwill lose by it, I will never gain.  I would rather make a\n\nshipwreck wholly than to build on that foundation.\"\n\n\n\nHe was a minute serious, then smiled.  \"You mind me of the man with\n\nthe long nose,\" said he; \"was you to see the moon by a telescope\n\nyou would see David Balfour there!  But you shall have your way of\n\nit.  I will ask at you one service, and then set you free:  My\n\nclerks are overdriven; be so good as copy me these few pages, and\n\nwhen that is done, I shall bid you God speed!  I would never charge\n\nmyself with Mr. David's conscience; and if you could cast some part\n\nof it (as you went by) in a moss hag, you would find yourself to\n\nride much easier without it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!\"\n\nsays I.\n\n\n\n\"And you shall have the last word, too!\" cries he gaily.\n\n\n\nIndeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means to\n\ngain his purpose.  To lessen the weight of the memorial, or to have\n\na readier answer at his hand, he desired I should appear publicly\n\nin the character of his intimate.  But if I were to appear with the\n\nsame publicity as a visitor to Catriona in her prison the world\n\nwould scarce stint to draw conclusions, and the true nature of\n\nJames More's escape must become evident to all.  This was the\n\nlittle problem I had to set him of a sudden, and to which he had so\n\nbriskly found an answer.  I was to be tethered in Glasgow by that\n\njob of copying, which in mere outward decency I could not well\n\nrefuse; and during these hours of employment Catriona was privately\n\ngot rid of.  I think shame to write of this man that loaded me with\n\nso many goodnesses.  He was kind to me as any father, yet I ever\n\nthought him as false as a cracked bell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived very\n\nearly there was no sort of urgency in the matters treated, and\n\nbegan very early to consider my employment a pretext.  I had no\n\nsooner finished than I got to horse, used what remained of daylight\n\nto the best purpose, and being at last fairly benighted, slept in a\n\nhouse by Almond-Water side.  I was in the saddle again before the\n\nday, and the Edinburgh booths were just opening when I clattered in\n\nby the West Bow and drew up a smoking horse at my lord Advocate's\n\ndoor.  I had a written word for Doig, my lord's private hand that\n\nwas thought to be in all his secrets--a worthy little plain man,\n\nall fat and snuff and self-sufficiency.  Him I found already at his\n\ndesk and already bedabbled with maccabaw, in the same anteroom\n\nwhere I rencountered with James More.  He read the note\n\nscrupulously through like a chapter in his Bible.\n\n\n\n\"H'm,\" says he; \"ye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr. Balfour.  The\n\nbird's flaen--we hae letten her out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Miss Drummond is set free?\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"Achy!\" said he.  \"What would we keep her for, ye ken?  To hae made\n\na steer about the bairn would has pleased naebody.\"\n\n\n\n\"And where'll she be now?\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"Gude kens!\" says Doig, with a shrug.\n\n\n\n\"She'll have gone home to Lady Allardyce, I'm thinking,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"That'll be it,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Then I'll gang there straight,\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"But ye'll be for a bite or ye go?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"Neither bite nor sup,\" said I.  \"I had a good wauch of milk in by\n\nRatho.\"\n\n\n\n\"Aweel, aweel,\" says Doig.  \"But ye'll can leave your horse here\n\nand your bags, for it seems we're to have your up-put.\"\n\n\n\n\"Na, na\", said I.  \"Tamson's mear {17} would never be the thing for\n\nme this day of all days.\"\n\n\n\nDoig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation into an\n\naccent much more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a\n\ngood deal broader, indeed, than I have written it down; and I was\n\nthe more ashamed when another voice joined in behind me with a\n\nscrap of a ballad:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gae saddle me the bonny black,\n\nGae saddle sune and mak' him ready\n\nFor I will down the Gatehope-slack,\n\nAnd a' to see my bonny leddy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning gown, and\n\nher hands muffled in the same, as if to hold me at a distance.  Yet\n\nI could not but think there was kindness in the eye with which she\n\nsaw me.\n\n\n\n\"My best respects to you, Mistress Grant,\" said I, bowing.\n\n\n\n\"The like to yourself, Mr. David,\" she replied with a deep\n\ncourtesy.  \"And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw, that meat\n\nand mass never hindered man.  The mass I cannot afford you, for we\n\nare all good Protestants.  But the meat I press on your attention.\n\nAnd I would not wonder but I could find something for your private\n\near that would be worth the stopping for.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mistress Grant,\" said I, \"I believe I am already your debtor for\n\nsome merry words--and I think they were kind too--on a piece of\n\nunsigned paper.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unsigned paper?\" says she, and made a droll face, which was\n\nlikewise wondrous beautiful, as of one trying to remember.\n\n\n\n\"Or else I am the more deceived,\" I went on.  \"But to be sure, we\n\nshall have the time to speak of these, since your father is so good\n\nas to make me for a while your inmate; and the GOMERAL begs you at\n\nthis time only for the favour of his liberty,\"\n\n\n\n\"You give yourself hard names,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen,\"\n\nsays I.\n\n\n\n\"Once more I have to admire the discretion of all men-folk,\" she\n\nreplied.  \"But if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will\n\nbe back the sooner, for you go on a fool's errand.  Off with you,\n\nMr. David,\" she continued, opening the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He has lowpen on his bonny grey,\n\nHe rade the richt gate and the ready\n\nI trow he would neither stint nor stay,\n\nFor he was seeking his bonny leddy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss Grant's\n\ncitation on the way to Dean.\n\n\n\nOld Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden, in her hat and\n\nmutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of some black wood to lean\n\nupon.  As I alighted from my horse, and drew near to her with\n\nCONGEES, I could see the blood come in her face, and her head fling\n\ninto the air like what I had conceived of empresses.\n\n\n\n\"What brings you to my poor door?\" she cried, speaking high through\n\nher nose.  \"I cannot bar it.  The males of my house are dead and\n\nburied; I have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me;\n\nany beggar can pluck me by the baird {18}--and a baird there is,\n\nand that's the worst of it yet?\" she added partly to herself.\n\n\n\nI was extremely put out at this reception, and the last remark,\n\nwhich seemed like a daft wife's, left me near hand speechless.\n\n\n\n\"I see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma'am,\" said I.  \"Yet\n\nI will still be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond.\"\n\n\n\nShe considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed close\n\ntogether into twenty creases, her hand shaking on her staff.  \"This\n\ncows all!\" she cried.  \"Ye come to me to speir for her?  Would God\n\nI knew!\"\n\n\n\n\"She is not here?\" I cried.\n\n\n\nShe threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me, so that I\n\nfell back incontinent.\n\n\n\n\"Out upon your leeing throat!\" she cried.  \"What! ye come and speir\n\nat me!  She's in jyle, whaur ye took her to--that's all there is to\n\nit.  And of a' the beings ever I beheld in breeks, to think it\n\nshould be to you!  Ye timmer scoun'rel, if I had a male left to my\n\nname I would have your jaicket dustit till ye raired.\"\n\n\n\nI thought it not good to delay longer in that place, because I\n\nremarked her passion to be rising.  As I turned to the horse-post\n\nshe even followed me; and I make no shame to confess that I rode\n\naway with the one stirrup on and scrambling for the other.\n\n\n\nAs I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries, there\n\nwas nothing left me but to return to the Advocate's.  I was well\n\nreceived by the four ladies, who were now in company together, and\n\nmust give the news of Prestongrange and what word went in the west\n\ncountry, at the most inordinate length and with great weariness to\n\nmyself; while all the time that young lady, with whom I so much\n\ndesired to be alone again, observed me quizzically and seemed to\n\nfind pleasure in the sight of my impatience.  At last, after I had\n\nendured a meal with them, and was come very near the point of\n\nappealing for an interview before her aunt, she went and stood by\n\nthe music-case, and picking out a tune, sang to it on a high key--\n\n\"He that will not when he may, When he will he shall have nay.\"\n\nBut this was the end of her rigours, and presently, after making\n\nsome excuse of which I have no mind, she carried me away in private\n\nto her father's library.  I should not fail to say she was dressed\n\nto the nines, and appeared extraordinary handsome.\n\n\n\n\"Now, Mr. David, sit ye down here and let us have a two-handed\n\ncrack,\" said she.  \"For I have much to tell you, and it appears\n\nbesides that I have been grossly unjust to your good taste.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what manner, Mistress Grant?\" I asked.  \"I trust I have never\n\nseemed to fail in due respect.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will be your surety, Mr, David,\" said she.  \"Your respect,\n\nwhether to yourself or your poor neighbours, has been always and\n\nmost fortunately beyond imitation.  But that is by the question.\n\nYou got a note from me?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference,\" said I, \"and it\n\nwas kindly thought upon.\"\n\n\n\n\"It must have prodigiously surprised you,\" said she.  \"But let us\n\nbegin with the beginning.  You have not perhaps forgot a day when\n\nyou were so kind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope\n\nPark?  I have the less cause to forget it myself, because you was\n\nso particular obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles\n\nof the Latin grammar, a thing which wrote itself profoundly on my\n\ngratitude.\"\n\n\n\n\"I fear I was sadly pedantical,\" said I, overcome with confusion at\n\nthe memory.  \"You are only to consider I am quite unused with the\n\nsociety of ladies.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will say the less about the grammar then,\" she replied.  \"But\n\nhow came you to desert your charge?  'He has thrown her out,\n\noverboard, his ain dear Annie!'\" she hummed; \"and his ain dear\n\nAnnie and her two sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a\n\nstring of green geese!  It seems you returned to my papa's, where\n\nyou showed yourself excessively martial, and then on to realms\n\nunknown, with an eye (it appears) to the Bass Rock; solan geese\n\nbeing perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses.\"\n\n\n\nThrough all this raillery there was something indulgent in the\n\nlady's eye which made me suppose there might be better coming.\n\n\n\n\"You take a pleasure to torment me,\" said I, \"and I make a very\n\nfeckless plaything; but let me ask you to be more merciful.  At\n\nthis time there is but the one thing that I care to hear of, and\n\nthat will be news of Catriona.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"In troth, and I am not very sure,\" I stammered.\n\n\n\n\"I would not do so in any case to strangers,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"And why are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young\n\nlady?\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard she was in prison,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well, and now you hear that she is out of it,\" she replied, \"and\n\nwhat more would you have?  She has no need of any further\n\nchampion.\"\n\n\n\n\"I may have the greater need of her, ma'am,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Come, this is better!\" says Miss Grant.  \"But look me fairly in\n\nthe face; am I not bonnier than she?\"\n\n\n\n\"I would be the last to be denying it,\" said I.  \"There is not your\n\nmarrow in all Scotland.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, here you have the pick of the two at your hand, and must\n\nneeds speak of the other,\" said she.  \"This is never the way to\n\nplease the ladies, Mr. Balfour.\"\n\n\n\n\"But, mistress,\" said I, \"there are surely other things besides\n\nmere beauty.\"\n\n\n\n\"By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be,\n\nperhaps?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the\n\nmidden in the fable book,\" said I.  \"I see the braw jewel--and I\n\nlike fine to see it too--but I have more need of the pickle corn.\"\n\n\n\n\"Bravissimo!\" she cried.  \"There is a word well said at last, and I\n\nwill reward you for it with my story.  That same night of your\n\ndesertion I came late from a friend's house--where I was\n\nexcessively admired, whatever you may think of it--and what should\n\nI hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me?\n\nShe had been there an hour or better, said the servant-lass, and\n\nshe grat in to herself as she sat waiting.  I went to her direct;\n\nshe rose as I came in, and I knew her at a look.  'Grey Eyes!' says\n\nI to myself, but was more wise than to let on.  YOU WILL BE MISS\n\nGRANT AT LAST? she says, rising and looking at me hard and pitiful.\n\nAY, IT WAS TRUE HE SAID, YOU ARE BONNY AT ALL EVENTS.--THE WAY GOD\n\nMADE ME, MY DEAR, I said, BUT I WOULD BE GEY AND OBLIGED IF YOU\n\nCOULD TELL ME WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE AT SUCH A TIME OF THE NIGHT.--\n\nLADY, she said, WE ARE KINSFOLK, WE ARE BOTH COME OF THE BLOOD OF\n\nTHE SONS OF ALPIN.--MY DEAR, I replied, I THINK NO MORE OF ALPIN OR\n\nHIS SONS THAN WHAT I DO OF A KALESTOCK.  YOU HAVE A BETTER ARGUMENT\n\nIN THESE TEARS UPON YOUR BONNY FACE.  And at that I was so weak-\n\nminded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do dearly,\n\nand I wager will never find the courage of.  I say it was weak-\n\nminded of me, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it\n\nwas the wisest stroke I could have hit upon.  She is a very\n\nstaunch, brave nature, but I think she has been little used with\n\ntenderness; and at that caress (though to say the truth, it was but\n\nlightly given) her heart went out to me.  I will never betray the\n\nsecrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will never tell you the way she\n\nturned me round her thumb, because it is the same she will use to\n\ntwist yourself.  Ay, it is a fine lass!  She is as clean as hill\n\nwell water.\"\n\n\n\n\"She is e'en't!\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"Well, then, she told me her concerns,\" pursued Miss Grant, \"and in\n\nwhat a swither she was in about her papa, and what a taking about\n\nyourself, with very little cause, and in what a perplexity she had\n\nfound herself after you was gone away.  AND THEN I MINDED AT LONG\n\nLAST, says she, THAT WE WERE KINSWOMEN, AND THAT MR. DAVID SHOULD\n\nHAVE GIVEN YOU THE NAME OF THE BONNIEST OF THE BONNY, AND I WAS\n\nTHINKING TO MYSELF 'IF SHE IS SO BONNY SHE WILL BE GOOD AT ALL\n\nEVENTS'; AND I TOOK UP MY FOOT SOLES OUT OF THAT.  That was when I\n\nforgave yourself, Mr. Davie.  When you was in my society, you\n\nseemed upon hot iron:  by all marks, if ever I saw a young man that\n\nwanted to be gone, it was yourself, and I and my two sisters were\n\nthe ladies you were so desirous to be gone from; and now it\n\nappeared you had given me some notice in the by-going, and was so\n\nkind as to comment on my attractions!  From that hour you may date\n\nour friendship, and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin\n\ngrammar.\"\n\n\n\n\"You will have many hours to rally me in,\" said I; \"and I think\n\nbesides you do yourself injustice.  I think it was Catriona turned\n\nyour heart in my direction.  She is too simple to perceive as you\n\ndo the stiffness of her friend.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,\" said she.  \"The\n\nlasses have clear eyes.  But at least she is your friend entirely,\n\nas I was to see.  I carried her in to his lordship my papa; and his\n\nAdvocacy being in a favourable stage of claret, was so good as to\n\nreceive the pair of us.  HERE IS GREY EYES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN\n\nDEAVED WITH THESE DAYS PAST, said I, SHE IS COME TO PROVE THAT WE\n\nSPOKE TRUE, AND I LAY THE PRETTIEST LASS IN THE THREE LOTHIANS AT\n\nYOUR FEET--making a papistical reservation of myself.  She suited\n\nher action to my words:  down she went upon her knees to him--I\n\nwould not like to swear but he saw two of her, which doubtless made\n\nher appeal the more irresistible, for you are all a pack of\n\nMahomedans--told him what had passed that night, and how she had\n\nwithheld her father's man from following of you, and what a case\n\nshe was in about her father, and what a flutter for yourself; and\n\nbegged with weeping for the lives of both of you (neither of which\n\nwas in the slightest danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex\n\nbecause it was done so pretty, and ashamed for it because of the\n\nsmallness of the occasion.  She had not gone far, I assure you,\n\nbefore the Advocate was wholly sober, to see his inmost politics\n\nravelled out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of\n\nhis daughters.  But we took him in hand, the pair of us, and\n\nbrought that matter straight.  Properly managed--and that means\n\nmanaged by me--there is no one to compare with my papa.\"\n\n\n\n\"He has been a good man to me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there to see to it,\"\n\nsaid she.\n\n\n\n\"And she pled for me?\" say I.\n\n\n\n\"She did that, and very movingly,\" said Miss Grant.  \"I would not\n\nlike to tell you what she said--I find you vain enough already.\"\n\n\n\n\"God reward her for it!\" cried I.\n\n\n\n\"With Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"You do me too much injustice at the last!\" I cried.  \"I would\n\ntremble to think of her in such hard hands.  Do you think I would\n\npresume, because she begged my life?  She would do that for a new\n\nwhelped puppy!  I have had more than that to set me up, if you but\n\nken'd.  She kissed that hand of mine.  Ay, but she did.  And why?\n\nbecause she thought I was playing a brave part and might be going\n\nto my death.  It was not for my sake--but I need not be telling\n\nthat to you, that cannot look at me without laughter.  It was for\n\nthe love of what she thought was bravery.  I believe there is none\n\nbut me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour done them.  Was this\n\nnot to make a god of me? and do you not think my heart would quake\n\nwhen I remember it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more than is quite\n\ncivil,\" said she; \"but I will tell you one thing:  if you speak to\n\nher like that, you have some glimmerings of a chance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me?\" I cried, \"I would never dare.  I can speak to you, Miss\n\nGrant, because it's a matter of indifference what ye think of me.\n\nBut her? no fear!\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,\" says\n\nshe.\n\n\n\n\"Troth they are no very small,\" said I, looking down.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, poor Catriona!\" cries Miss Grant.\n\n\n\nAnd I could but stare upon her; for though I now see very well what\n\nshe was driving at (and perhaps some justification for the same), I\n\nwas never swift at the uptake in such flimsy talk.\n\n\n\n\"Ah well, Mr. David,\" she said, \"it goes sore against my\n\nconscience, but I see I shall have to be your speaking board.  She\n\nshall know you came to her straight upon the news of her\n\nimprisonment; she shall know you would not pause to eat; and of our\n\nconversation she shall hear just so much as I think convenient for\n\na maid of her age and inexperience.  Believe me, you will be in\n\nthat way much better served than you could serve yourself, for I\n\nwill keep the big feet out of the platter.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know where she is, then?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\"That I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"Why that?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I am a good friend, as you will soon discover;\n\nand the chief of those that I am friend to is my papa.  I assure\n\nyou, you will never heat nor melt me out of that, so you may spare\n\nme your sheep's eyes; and adieu to your David-Balfourship for the\n\nnow.\"\n\n\n\n\"But there is yet one thing more,\" I cried.  \"There is one thing\n\nthat must be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"be brief; I have spent half the day on you\n\nalready.\"\n\n\n\n\"My Lady Allardyce believes,\" I began--\"she supposes--she thinks\n\nthat I abducted her.\"\n\n\n\nThe colour came into Miss Grant's face, so that at first I was\n\nquite abashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought me she\n\nwas struggling rather with mirth, a notion in which I was\n\naltogether confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied -\n\n\n\n\"I will take up the defence of your reputation,\" she said.  \"You\n\nmay leave it in my hands.\"\n\n\n\nAnd with that she withdrew out of the library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX--I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange's\n\nfamily, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar,\n\nand the flower of Edinburgh company.  You are not to suppose my\n\neducation was neglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely\n\nbusy.  I studied the French, so as to be more prepared to go to\n\nLeyden; I set myself to the fencing, and wrought hard, sometimes\n\nthree hours in the day, with notable advancement; at the suggestion\n\nof my cousin, Pilrig, who was an apt musician, I was put to a\n\nsinging class; and by the orders of my Miss Grant, to one for the\n\ndancing, at which I must say I proved far from ornamental.\n\nHowever, all were good enough to say it gave me an address a little\n\nmore genteel; and there is no question but I learned to manage my\n\ncoat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in a room\n\nas though the same belonged to me.  My clothes themselves were all\n\nearnestly re-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance, such as\n\nwhere I should tie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated\n\namong the three misses like a thing of weight.  One way with\n\nanother, no doubt I was a good deal improved to look at, and\n\nacquired a bit of modest air that would have surprised the good\n\nfolks at Essendean.\n\n\n\nThe two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my\n\nhabiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts.\n\nI cannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my\n\npresence; and though always more than civil, with a kind of\n\nheartless cordiality, could not hide how much I wearied them.  As\n\nfor the aunt, she was a wonderful still woman; and I think she gave\n\nme much the same attention as she gave the rest of the family,\n\nwhich was little enough.  The eldest daughter and the Advocate\n\nhimself were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity was\n\nmuch increased by a pleasure that we took in common.  Before the\n\ncourt met we spent a day or two at the house of Grange, living very\n\nnobly with an open table, and here it was that we three began to\n\nride out together in the fields, a practice afterwards maintained\n\nin Edinburgh, so far as the Advocate's continual affairs permitted.\n\nWhen we were put in a good frame by the briskness of the exercise,\n\nthe difficulties of the way, or the accidents of bad weather, my\n\nshyness wore entirely off; we forgot that we were strangers, and\n\nspeech not being required, it flowed the more naturally on.  Then\n\nit was that they had my story from me, bit by bit, from the time\n\nthat I left Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the Covenant,\n\nwanderings in the heather, etc.; and from the interest they found\n\nin my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a\n\nlittle later on, on a day when the courts were not sitting, and of\n\nwhich I will tell a trifle more at length.\n\n\n\nWe took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws, where\n\nit stood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for it was yet\n\nearly in the day.  Here Prestongrange alighted down, gave me his\n\nhorse, an proceeded alone to visit my uncle.  My heart, I remember,\n\nswelled up bitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the\n\nthought of the old miser sitting chittering within in the cold\n\nkitchen!\n\n\n\n\"There is my home,\" said I; \"and my family.\"\n\n\n\n\"Poor David Balfour!\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\n\nWhat passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would\n\ndoubtless not be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate\n\ncame forth again his face was dark.\n\n\n\n\"I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,\" says he,\n\nturning half about with the one foot in the stirrup.\n\n\n\n\"I will never pretend sorrow,\" said I; and, to say the truth,\n\nduring his absence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the place\n\nin fancy with plantations, parterres, and a terrace--much as I have\n\nsince carried out in fact.\n\n\n\nThence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us a\n\ngood welcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great a\n\nvisitor.  Here the Advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go quite\n\nfully over my affairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in\n\nhis study, and expressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself\n\nand concern for my fortunes.  To while this time, Miss Grant and I\n\nand young Rankeillor took boat and passed the Hope to Limekilns.\n\nRankeillor made himself very ridiculous (and, I thought, offensive)\n\nwith his admiration for the young lady, and to my wonder (only it\n\nis so common a weakness of her sex) she seemed, if anything, to be\n\na little gratified.  One use it had:  for when we were come to the\n\nother side, she laid her commands on him to mind the boat, while\n\nshe and I passed a little further to the alehouse.  This was her\n\nown thought, for she had been taken with my account of Alison\n\nHastie, and desired to see the lass herself.  We found her once\n\nmore alone--indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the\n\nfields--and she curtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the\n\nbeautiful young lady in the riding-coat.\n\n\n\n\"Is this all the welcome I am to get?\" said I, holding out my hand.\n\n\"And have you no more memory of old friends?\"\n\n\n\n\"Keep me! wha's this of it?\" she cried, and then, \"God's truth,\n\nit's the tautit {19} laddie!\"\n\n\n\n\"The very same,\" says\n\n\n\n\"Mony's the time I've thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe am\n\nI to see in your braws,\" {20} she cried.  \"Though I kent ye were\n\ncome to your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that\n\nI thank ye for with a' my heart.\"\n\n\n\n\"There,\" said Miss Grant to me, \"run out by with ye, like a guid\n\nbairn.  I didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it's her and\n\nme that are to crack.\"\n\n\n\nI suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came\n\nforth I observed two things--that her eyes were reddened, and a\n\nsilver brooch was gone out of her bosom.  This very much affected\n\nme.\n\n\n\n\"I never saw you so well adorned,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"O Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!\" said she, and was more than\n\nusually sharp to me the remainder of the day.\n\n\n\nAbout candlelight we came home from this excursion.\n\n\n\nFor a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona--my Miss Grant\n\nremaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with\n\npleasantries.  At last, one day that she returned from walking and\n\nfound me alone in the parlour over my French, I thought there was\n\nsomething unusual in her looks; the colour heightened, the eyes\n\nsparkling high, and a bit of a smile continually bitten in as she\n\nregarded me.  She seemed indeed like the very spirit of mischief,\n\nand, walking briskly in the room, had soon involved me in a kind of\n\nquarrel over nothing and (at the least) with nothing intended on my\n\nside.  I was like Christian in the slough--the more I tried to\n\nclamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved; until at\n\nlast I heard her declare, with a great deal of passion, that she\n\nwould take that answer from the hands of none, and I must down upon\n\nmy knees for pardon.\n\n\n\nThe causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile.  \"I have\n\nsaid nothing you can properly object to,\" said I, \"and as for my\n\nknees, that is an attitude I keep for God.\"\n\n\n\n\"And as a goddess I am to be served!\" she cried, shaking her brown\n\nlocks at me and with a bright colour.  \"Every man that comes within\n\nwaft of my petticoats shall use me so!\"\n\n\n\n\"I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion's sake,\n\nalthough I vow I know not why,\" I replied.  \"But for these play-\n\nacting postures, you can go to others.\"\n\n\n\n\"O Davie!\" she said.  \"Not if I was to beg you?\"\n\n\n\nI bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same as to\n\nsay a child, and that upon a point entirely formal.\n\n\n\n\"I think it a bairnly thing,\" I said, \"not worthy in you to ask, or\n\nme to render.  Yet I will not refuse you, neither,\" said I; \"and\n\nthe stain, if there be any, rests with yourself.\"  And at that I\n\nkneeled fairly down.\n\n\n\n\"There!\" she cried.  \"There is the proper station, there is where I\n\nhave been manoeuvring to bring you.\"  And then, suddenly, \"Kep,\"\n\n{21} said she, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment\n\nlaughing.\n\n\n\nThe billet had neither place nor date.  \"Dear Mr. David,\" it began,\n\n\"I get your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a\n\npleisand hearing.  I am very well, in a good place, among good\n\nfolk, but necessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping that\n\nat long last we may meet again.  All your friendships have been\n\ntold me by my loving cousin, who loves us both.  She bids me to\n\nsend you this writing, and oversees the same.  I will be asking you\n\nto do all her commands, and rest your affectionate friend, Catriona\n\nMacgregor-Drummond.  P.S.--Will you not see my cousin, Allardyce?\"\n\n\n\nI think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers\n\nsay) that I should have done as I was here bidden and gone\n\nforthright to the house by Dean.  But the old lady was now entirely\n\nchanged and supple as a glove.  By what means Miss Grant had\n\nbrought this round I could never guess; I am sure, at least, she\n\ndared not to appear openly in the affair, for her papa was\n\ncompromised in it pretty deep.  It was he, indeed, who had\n\npersuaded Catriona to leave, or rather, not to return, to her\n\ncousin's, placing her instead with a family of Gregorys--decent\n\npeople, quite at the Advocate's disposition, and in whom she might\n\nhave the more confidence because they were of his own clan and\n\nfamily.  These kept her private till all was ripe, heated and\n\nhelped her to attempt her father's rescue, and after she was\n\ndischarged from prison received her again into the same secrecy.\n\nThus Prestongrange obtained and used his instrument; nor did there\n\nleak out the smallest word of his acquaintance with the daughter of\n\nJames More.  There was some whispering, of course, upon the escape\n\nof that discredited person; but the Government replied by a show of\n\nrigour, one of the cell porters was flogged, the lieutenant of the\n\nguard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was broken of his rank, and as\n\nfor Catriona, all men were well enough pleased that her fault\n\nshould be passed by in silence.\n\n\n\nI could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer.  \"No,\" she\n\nwould say, when I persisted, \"I am going to keep the big feet out\n\nof the platter.\"  This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware\n\nshe saw my little friend many times in the week, and carried her my\n\nnews whenever (as she said) I \"had behaved myself.\"  At last she\n\ntreated me to what she called an indulgence, and I thought rather\n\nmore of a banter.  She was certainly a strong, almost a violent,\n\nfriend to all she liked, chief among whom was a certain frail old\n\ngentlewoman, very blind and very witty, who dwelt on the top of a\n\ntall land on a strait close, with a nest of linnets in a cage, and\n\nthronged all day with visitors.  Miss Grant was very fond to carry\n\nme there and put me to entertain her friend with the narrative of\n\nmy misfortunes:  and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (that was her name) was\n\nparticular kind, and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge\n\nof old folks and past affairs in Scotland.  I should say that from\n\nher chamber window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness\n\nof that close, it was possible to look into a barred loophole\n\nlighting the stairway of the opposite house.\n\n\n\nHere, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with Miss\n\nRamsay.  I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one\n\npreoccupied.  I was besides very uncomfortable, for the window,\n\ncontrary to custom, was left open and the day was cold.  All at\n\nonce the voice of Miss Grant sounded in my ears as from a distance.\n\n\n\n\"Here, Shaws!\" she cried, \"keek out of the window and see what I\n\nhave broughten you.\"\n\n\n\nI think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld.  The well of\n\nthe close was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly,\n\nthe walls very black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole\n\nI saw two faces smiling across at me--Miss Grant's and Catriona's.\n\n\n\n\"There!\" says Miss Grant, \"I wanted her to see you in your braws\n\nlike the lass of Limekilns.  I wanted her to see what I could make\n\nof you, when I buckled to the job in earnest!\"\n\n\n\nIt came in my mind that she had been more than common particular\n\nthat day upon my dress; and I think that some of the same care had\n\nbeen bestowed upon Catriona.  For so merry and sensible a lady,\n\nMiss Grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona!\" was all I could get out.\n\n\n\nAs for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her hand\n\nand smiled to me, and was suddenly carried away again from before\n\nthe loophole.\n\n\n\nThat vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door, where\n\nI found I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying for the\n\nkey, but might as well have cried upon the castle rock.  She had\n\npassed her word, she said, and I must be a good lad.  It was\n\nimpossible to burst the door, even if it had been mannerly; it was\n\nimpossible I should leap from the window, being seven storeys above\n\nground.  All I could do was to crane over the close and watch for\n\ntheir reappearance from the stair.  It was little to see, being no\n\nmore than the tops of their two heads each on a ridiculous bobbin\n\nof skirts, like to a pair of pincushions.  Nor did Catriona so much\n\nas look up for a farewell; being prevented (as I heard afterwards)\n\nby Miss Grant, who told her folk were never seen to less advantage\n\nthan from above downward.\n\n\n\nOn the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss Grant\n\nwith her cruelty.\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry you was disappointed,\" says she demurely.  \"For my part\n\nI was very pleased.  You looked better than I dreaded; you looked--\n\nif it will not make you vain--a mighty pretty young man when you\n\nappeared in the window.  You are to remember that she could not see\n\nyour feet,\" says she, with the manner of one reassuring me.\n\n\n\n\"O!\" cried I, \"leave my feet be--they are no bigger than my\n\nneighbours'.\"\n\n\n\n\"They are even smaller than some,\" said she, \"but I speak in\n\nparables like a Hebrew prophet.\"\n\n\n\n\"I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!\" says I.  \"But, you\n\nmiserable girl, how could you do it?  Why should you care to\n\ntantalise me with a moment?\"\n\n\n\n\"Love is like folk,\" says she; \"it needs some kind of vivers.\" {22}\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Barbara, let me see her properly!\" I pleaded.  \"YOU can--you\n\nsee her when you please; let me have half an hour.\"\n\n\n\n\"Who is it that is managing this love affair!  You!  Or me?\" she\n\nasked, and as I continued to press her with my instances, fell back\n\nupon a deadly expedient:  that of imitating the tones of my voice\n\nwhen I called on Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she held me\n\nin subjection for some days to follow.\n\n\n\nThere was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none by\n\nme.  Prestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have heard\n\nof it (for what I know) on the deafest sides of their heads; they\n\nkept it to themselves, at least--the public was none the wiser; and\n\nin course of time, on November 8th, and in the midst of a\n\nprodigious storm of wind and rain, poor James of the Glens was duly\n\nhanged at Lettermore by Ballachulish.\n\n\n\nSo there was the final upshot of my politics!  Innocent men have\n\nperished before James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite\n\nof all our wisdom) till the end of time.  And till the end of time\n\nyoung folk (who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and\n\nmen) will struggle as I did, and make heroical resolves, and take\n\nlong risks; and the course of events will push them upon the one\n\nside and go on like a marching army.  James was hanged; and here\n\nwas I dwelling in the house of Prestongrange, and grateful to him\n\nfor his fatherly attention.  He was hanged; and behold! when I met\n\nMr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my beaver to him\n\nlike a good little boy before his dominie.  He had been hanged by\n\nfraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and there was not a\n\npennyweight of difference; and the villains of that horrid plot\n\nwere decent, kind, respectable fathers of families, who went to\n\nkirk and took the sacrament!\n\n\n\nBut I had had my view of that detestable business they call\n\npolitics--I had seen it from behind, when it is all bones and\n\nblackness; and I was cured for life of any temptations to take part\n\nin it again.  A plain, quiet, private path was that which I was\n\nambitious to walk in, when I might keep my head out of the way of\n\ndangers and my conscience out of the road of temptation.  For, upon\n\na retrospect, it appeared I had not done so grandly, after all; but\n\nwith the greatest possible amount of big speech and preparation,\n\nhad accomplished nothing.\n\n\n\nThe 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from\n\nLeith; and I was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for\n\nLeyden.  To Prestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for I\n\nhad already been a long while sorning on his house and table.  But\n\nwith his daughter I was more open, bewailing my fate that I should\n\nbe sent out of the country, and assuring her, unless she should\n\nbring me to farewell with Catriona, I would refuse at the last\n\nhour.\n\n\n\n\"Have I not given you my advice?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"I know you have,\" said I, \"and I know how much I am beholden to\n\nyou already, and that I am bidden to obey your orders.  But you\n\nmust confess you are something too merry a lass at times to lippen\n\n{23} to entirely.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will tell you, then,\" said she.  \"Be you on board by nine\n\no'clock forenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat\n\nalongside; and if you are not pleased with my farewells when I\n\nshall send them, you can come ashore again and seek Katrine for\n\nyourself.\"\n\n\n\nSince I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with\n\nthis.\n\n\n\nThe day came round at last when she and I were to separate.  We had\n\nbeen extremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt; and\n\nwhat way we were to part was a thing that put me from my sleep,\n\nlike the vails I was to give to the domestic servants.  I knew she\n\nconsidered me too backward, and rather desired to rise in her\n\nopinion on that head.  Besides which, after so much affection shown\n\nand (I believe) felt upon both sides, it would have looked cold-\n\nlike to be anyways stiff.  Accordingly, I got my courage up and my\n\nwords ready, and the last chance we were like to be alone, asked\n\npretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell.\n\n\n\n\"You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,\" said she.  \"I cannot\n\ncall to mind that I have given you any right to presume on our\n\nacquaintancy.\"\n\n\n\nI stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to\n\nthink, far less to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about my\n\nneck and kissed me with the best will in the world.\n\n\n\n\"You inimitable bairn?\" she cried.  \"Did you think that I would let\n\nus part like strangers?  Because I can never keep my gravity at you\n\nfive minutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you very\n\nwell:  I am all love and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you!\n\nAnd now I will give you an advice to conclude your education, which\n\nyou will have need of before it's very long.\n\n\n\nNever ASK womenfolk.  They're bound to answer 'No'; God never made\n\nthe lass that could resist the temptation.  It's supposed by\n\ndivines to be the curse of Eve:  because she did not say it when\n\nthe devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing\n\nelse.\"\n\n\n\n\"Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,\" I began.\n\n\n\n\"This is gallant, indeed,\" says she curtseying.\n\n\n\n\"I would put the one question,\" I went on.  \"May I ask a lass to\n\nmarry to me?\"\n\n\n\n\"You think you could not marry her without!\" she asked.  \"Or else\n\nget her to offer?\"\n\n\n\n\"You see you cannot be serious,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I shall be very serious in one thing, David,\" said she:  \"I shall\n\nalways be your friend.\"\n\n\n\nAs I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all at\n\nthat same window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and\n\nall cried farewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away.\n\nOne out of the four I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of\n\nthat, and how I had come to the door three months ago for the first\n\ntime, sorrow and gratitude made a confusion in my mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART II--FATHER AND DAUGHTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so\n\nthat all we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs.\n\nThis was very little troublesome, for the reason that the day was a\n\nflat calm, very frosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon\n\nthe water.  The body of the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew\n\nnear, but the tall spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine\n\nlike the flickering of a fire.  She proved to be a very roomy,\n\ncommodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden\n\nextraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and fine white linen\n\nstockings for the Dutch.  Upon my coming on board, the captain\n\nwelcomed me--one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very hearty,\n\nfriendly tarpaulin of a man, but at the moment in rather of a\n\nbustle.  There had no other of the passengers yet appeared, so that\n\nI was left to walk about upon the deck, viewing the prospect and\n\nwondering a good deal what these farewells should be which I was\n\npromised.\n\n\n\nAll Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me in a kind of\n\nsmuisty brightness, now and again overcome with blots of cloud; of\n\nLeith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and on\n\nthe face of the water, where the haar {24} lay, nothing at all.\n\nOut of this I was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a\n\nlittle after (as if out of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued.\n\nThere sat a grave man in the stern sheets, well muffled from the\n\ncold, and by his side a tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that\n\nbrought my heart to a stand.  I had scarce the time to catch my\n\nbreath in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped upon the deck,\n\nsmiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly finer than\n\nsome months before, when first I made it to her ladyship.  No doubt\n\nwe were both a good deal changed:  she seemed to have shot up like\n\na young, comely tree.  She had now a kind of pretty backwardness\n\nthat became her well as of one that regarded herself more highly\n\nand was fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same\n\nmagician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had\n\nmade us both BRAW, if she could make but the one BONNY.\n\n\n\nThe same cry, in words not very different, came from both of us,\n\nthat the other was come in compliment to say farewell, and then we\n\nperceived in a flash we were to ship together.\n\n\n\n\"O, why will not Baby have been telling me!\" she cried; and then\n\nremembered a letter she had been given, on the condition of not\n\nopening it till she was well on board.  Within was an enclosure for\n\nmyself, and ran thus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DEAR DAVIE,--What do you think of my farewell? and what do you say\n\nto your fellow passenger?  Did you kiss, or did you ask?  I was\n\nabout to have signed here, but that would leave the purport of my\n\nquestion doubtful, and in my own case I KEN THE ANSWER.  So fill up\n\nhere with good advice.  Do not be too blate, {25} and for God's\n\nsake do not try to be too forward; nothing acts you worse.  I am\n\n\n\n\"Your affectionate friend and governess,\n\n\"BARBARA GRANT.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my\n\npocketbook, put it in with another scratch from Catriona, sealed\n\nthe whole with my new signet of the Balfour arms, and despatched it\n\nby the hand of Prestongrange's servant that still waited in my\n\nboat.\n\n\n\nThen we had time to look upon each other more at leisure, which we\n\nhad not done for a piece of a minute before (upon a common impulse)\n\nwe shook hands again.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona?\" said I.  It seemed that was the first and last word of\n\nmy eloquence.\n\n\n\n\"You will be glad to see me again?\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"And I think that is an idle word,\" said I.  \"We are too deep\n\nfriends to make speech upon such trifles.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is she not the girl of all the world?\" she cried again.  \"I was\n\nnever knowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\"And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a kale-\n\nstock,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, she will say so indeed!\" cries Catriona.  \"Yet it was for the\n\nname and the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good\n\nto me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I will tell you why it was,\" said I.  \"There are all sorts\n\nof people's faces in this world.  There is Barbara's face, that\n\neveryone must look at and admire, and think her a fine, brave,\n\nmerry girl.  And then there is your face, which is quite different-\n\n-I never knew how different till to-day.  You cannot see yourself,\n\nand that is why you do not understand; but it was for the love of\n\nyour face that she took you up and was so good to you.  And\n\neverybody in the world would do the same.\"\n\n\n\n\"Everybody?\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"Every living soul?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, then, that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up!\"\n\nshe cried,\n\n\n\n\"Barbara has been teaching you to catch me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"She will have taught me more than that at all events.  She will\n\nhave taught me a great deal about Mr. David--all the ill of him,\n\nand a little that was not so ill either, now and then,\" she said,\n\nsmiling.  \"She will have told me all there was of Mr. David, only\n\njust that he would sail upon this very same ship.  And why it is\n\nyou go?\"\n\n\n\nI told her.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said she, \"we will be some days in company and then (I\n\nsuppose) good-bye for altogether!  I go to meet my father at a\n\nplace of the name of Helvoetsluys, and from there to France, to be\n\nexiles by the side of our chieftain.\"\n\n\n\nI could say no more than just \"O!\" the name of James More always\n\ndrying up my very voice.\n\n\n\nShe was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion of my\n\nthought.\n\n\n\n\"There is one thing I must be saying first of all, Mr. David,\" said\n\nshe.  \"I think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you\n\naltogether very well.  And the one of them two is James More, my\n\nfather, and the other is the Laird of Prestongrange.  Prestongrange\n\nwill have spoken by himself, or his daughter in the place of him.\n\nBut for James More, my father, I have this much to say:  he lay\n\nshackled in a prison; he is a plain honest soldier and a plain\n\nHighland gentleman; what they would be after he would never be\n\nguessing; but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice to a\n\nyoung gentleman like yourself, he would have died first.  And for\n\nthe sake of all your friendships, I will be asking you to pardon my\n\nfather and family for that same mistake.\"\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"what that mistake was I do not care to know.\n\nI know but the one thing--that you went to Prestongrange and begged\n\nmy life upon your knees.  O, I ken well enough it was for your\n\nfather that you went, but when you were there you pleaded for me\n\nalso.  It is a thing I cannot speak of.  There are two things I\n\ncannot think of into myself:  and the one is your good words when\n\nyou called yourself my little friend, and the other that you\n\npleaded for my life.  Let us never speak more, we two, of pardon or\n\noffence.\"\n\n\n\nWe stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck and I on\n\nher; and before there was more speech, a little wind having sprung\n\nup in the nor'-west, they began to shake out the sails and heave in\n\nupon the anchor.\n\n\n\nThere were six passengers besides our two selves, which made of it\n\na full cabin.  Three were solid merchants out of Leith, Kirkcaldy,\n\nand Dundee, all engaged in the same adventure into High Germany.\n\nOne was a Hollander returning; the rest worthy merchants' wives, to\n\nthe charge of one of whom Catriona was recommended.  Mrs. Gebbie\n\n(for that was her name) was by great good fortune heavily\n\nincommoded by the sea, and lay day and night on the broad of her\n\nback.  We were besides the only creatures at all young on board the\n\nRose, except a white-faced boy that did my old duty to attend upon\n\nthe table; and it came about that Catriona and I were left almost\n\nentirely to ourselves.  We had the next seats together at the\n\ntable, where I waited on her with extraordinary pleasure.  On deck,\n\nI made her a soft place with my cloak; and the weather being\n\nsingularly fine for that season, with bright frosty days and\n\nnights, a steady, gentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the\n\nway through the North Sea, we sat there (only now and again walking\n\nto and fro for warmth) from the first blink of the sun till eight\n\nor nine at night under the clear stars.  The merchants or Captain\n\nSang would sometimes glance and smile upon us, or pass a merry word\n\nor two and give us the go-by again; but the most part of the time\n\nthey were deep in herring and chintzes and linen, or in\n\ncomputations of the slowness of the passage, and left us to our own\n\nconcerns, which were very little important to any but ourselves.\n\n\n\nAt the first, we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves\n\npretty witty; and I was at a little pains to be the beau, and she\n\n(I believe) to play the young lady of experience.  But soon we grew\n\nplainer with each other.  I laid aside my high, clipped English\n\n(what little there was left of it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh\n\nbows and scrapes; she, upon her side, fell into a sort of kind\n\nfamiliarity; and we dwelt together like those of the same\n\nhousehold, only (upon my side) with a more deep emotion.  About the\n\nsame time the bottom seemed to fall out of our conversation, and\n\nneither one of us the less pleased.  Whiles she would tell me old\n\nwives' tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many of them\n\nfrom my friend red-headed Niel.  She told them very pretty, and\n\nthey were pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself\n\nwas in the sound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling\n\nand I listening.  Whiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not\n\ncommunicating even with a look, and tasting pleasure enough in the\n\nsweetness of that neighbourhood.  I speak here only for myself.  Of\n\nwhat was in the maid's mind, I am not very sure that ever I asked\n\nmyself; and what was in my own, I was afraid to consider.  I need\n\nmake no secret of it now, either to myself or to the reader; I was\n\nfallen totally in love.  She came between me and the sun.  She had\n\ngrown suddenly taller, as I say, but with a wholesome growth; she\n\nseemed all health, and lightness, and brave spirits; and I thought\n\nshe walked like a young deer, and stood like a birch upon the\n\nmountains.  It was enough for me to sit near by her on the deck;\n\nand I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future, and was\n\nso well content with what I then enjoyed that I was never at the\n\npains to imagine any further step; unless perhaps that I would be\n\nsometimes tempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there.  But\n\nI was too like a miser of what joys I had, and would venture\n\nnothing on a hazard.\n\n\n\nWhat we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other, so that if\n\nanyone had been at so much pains as overhear us, he must have\n\nsupposed us the most egotistical persons in the world.  It befell\n\none day when we were at this practice, that we came on a discourse\n\nof friends and friendship, and I think now that we were sailing\n\nnear the wind.  We said what a fine thing friendship was, and how\n\nlittle we had guessed of it, and how it made life a new thing, and\n\na thousand covered things of the same kind that will have been\n\nsaid, since the foundation of the world, by young folk in the same\n\npredicament.  Then we remarked upon the strangeness of that\n\ncircumstance, that friends came together in the beginning as if\n\nthey were there for the first time, and yet each had been alive a\n\ngood while, losing time with other people.\n\n\n\n\"It is not much that I have done,\" said she, \"and I could be\n\ntelling you the five-fifths of it in two-three words.  It is only a\n\ngirl I am, and what can befall a girl, at all events?  But I went\n\nwith the clan in the year '45.  The men marched with swords and\n\nfire-locks, and some of them in brigades in the same set of tartan;\n\nthey were not backward at the marching, I can tell you.  And there\n\nwere gentlemen from the Low Country, with their tenants mounted and\n\ntrumpets to sound, and there was a grant skirling of war-pipes.  I\n\nrode on a little Highland horse on the right hand of my father,\n\nJames More, and of Glengyle himself.  And here is one fine thing\n\nthat I remember, that Glengyle kissed me in the face, because (says\n\nhe) 'my kinswoman, you are the only lady of the clan that has come\n\nout,' and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old!  I saw Prince\n\nCharlie too, and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty indeed!  I had\n\nhis hand to kiss in front of the army.  O, well, these were the\n\ngood days, but it is all like a dream that I have seen and then\n\nawakened.  It went what way you very well know; and these were the\n\nworst days of all, when the red-coat soldiers were out, and my\n\nfather and uncles lay in the hill, and I was to be carrying them\n\ntheir meat in the middle night, or at the short sight of day when\n\nthe cocks crow.  Yes, I have walked in the night, many's the time,\n\nand my heart great in me for terror of the darkness.  It is a\n\nstrange thing I will never have been meddled with by a bogle; but\n\nthey say a maid goes safe.  Next there was my uncle's marriage, and\n\nthat was a dreadful affair beyond all.  Jean Kay was that woman's\n\nname; and she had me in the room with her that night at Inversnaid,\n\nthe night we took her from her friends in the old, ancient manner.\n\nShe would and she wouldn't; she was for marrying Rob the one\n\nminute, and the next she would be for none of him.  I will never\n\nhave seen such a feckless creature of a woman; surely all there was\n\nof her would tell her ay or no.  Well, she was a widow; and I can\n\nnever be thinking a widow a good woman.\"\n\n\n\n\"Catriona!\" says I, \"how do you make out that?\"\n\n\n\n\"I do not know,\" said she; \"I am only telling you the seeming in my\n\nheart.  And then to marry a new man!  Fy!  But that was her; and\n\nshe was married again upon my Uncle Robin, and went with him awhile\n\nto kirk and market; and then wearied, or else her friends got\n\nclaught of her and talked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed;\n\nat the least of it, she ran away, and went back to her own folk,\n\nand said we had held her in the lake, and I will never tell you all\n\nwhat.  I have never thought much of any females since that day.\n\nAnd so in the end my father, James More, came to be cast in prison,\n\nand you know the rest of it an well as me.\"\n\n\n\n\"And through all you had no friends?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" said she; \"I have been pretty chief with two-three lasses on\n\nthe braes, but not to call it friends.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, mine is a plain tale,\" said I.  \"I never had a friend to my\n\nname till I met in with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And that brave Mr. Stewart?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"O, yes, I was forgetting him,\" I said.  \"But he in a man, and that\n\nin very different.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would think so,\" said she.  \"O, yes, it is quite different.\"\n\n\n\n\"And then there was one other,\" said I.  \"I once thought I had a\n\nfriend, but it proved a disappointment.\"\n\n\n\nShe asked me who she was?\n\n\n\n\"It was a he, then,\" said I.  \"We were the two best lads at my\n\nfather's school, and we thought we loved each other dearly.  Well,\n\nthe time came when he went to Glasgow to a merchant's house, that\n\nwas his second cousin once removed; and wrote me two-three times by\n\nthe carrier; and then he found new friends, and I might write till\n\nI was tired, he took no notice.  Eh, Catriona, it took me a long\n\nwhile to forgive the world.  There is not anything more bitter than\n\nto lose a fancied friend.\"\n\n\n\nThen she began to question me close upon his looks and character,\n\nfor we were each a great deal concerned in all that touched the\n\nother; till at last, in a very evil hour, I minded of his letters\n\nand went and fetched the bundle from the cabin.\n\n\n\n\"Here are his letters,\" said I, \"and all the letters that ever I\n\ngot.  That will be the last I'll can tell of myself; ye know the\n\nlave {26} as well as I do.\"\n\n\n\n\"Will you let me read them, then?\" says she.\n\n\n\nI told her, IF SHE WOULD BE AT THE PAINS; and she bade me go away\n\nand she would read them from the one end to the other.  Now, in\n\nthis bundle that I gave her, there were packed together not only\n\nall the letters of my false friend, but one or two of Mr.\n\nCampbell's when he was in town at the Assembly, and to make a\n\ncomplete roll of all that ever was written to me, Catriona's little\n\nword, and the two I had received from Miss Grant, one when I was on\n\nthe Bass and one on board that ship.  But of these last I had no\n\nparticular mind at the moment.\n\n\n\nI was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that\n\nit mattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I was in her\n\npresence or out of it; I had caught her like some kind of a noble\n\nfever that lived continually in my bosom, by night and by day, and\n\nwhether I was waking or asleep.  So it befell that after I was come\n\ninto the fore-part of the ship where the broad bows splashed into\n\nthe billows, I was in no such hurry to return as you might fancy;\n\nrather prolonged my absence like a variety in pleasure.  I do not\n\nthink I am by nature much of an Epicurean:  and there had come till\n\nthen so small a share of pleasure in my way that I might be excused\n\nperhaps to dwell on it unduly.\n\n\n\nWhen I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful impression as\n\nof a buckle slipped, so coldly she returned the packet.\n\n\n\n\"You have read them?\" said I; and I thought my voice sounded not\n\nwholly natural, for I was turning in my mind for what could ail\n\nher.\n\n\n\n\"Did you mean me to read all?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nI told her \"Yes,\" with a drooping voice.\n\n\n\n\"The last of them as well?\" said she.\n\n\n\nI knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her either.  \"I\n\ngave them all without afterthought,\" I said, \"as I supposed that\n\nyou would read them.  I see no harm in any.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will be differently made,\" said she.  \"I thank God I am\n\ndifferently made.  It was not a fit letter to be shown me.  It was\n\nnot fit to be written.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara Grant?\" said\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\"There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend,\"\n\nsaid she, quoting my own expression.\n\n\n\n\"I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!\" I cried.\n\n\"What kind of justice do you call this, to blame me for some words\n\nthat a tomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of\n\npaper?  You know yourself with what respect I have behaved--and\n\nwould do always.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yet you would show me that same letter!\" says she.  \"I want no\n\nsuch friends.  I can be doing very well, Mr. Balfour, without her--\n\nor you.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is your fine gratitude!\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said she.  \"I will be asking you\n\nto take away your--letters.\"  She seemed to choke upon the word, so\n\nthat it sounded like an oath.\n\n\n\n\"You shall never ask twice,\" said I; picked up that bundle, walked\n\na little way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea.\n\nFor a very little more I could have cast myself after them.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the day I walked up and down raging.  There were few\n\nnames so ill but what I gave her them in my own mind before the sun\n\nwent down.  All that I had ever heard of Highland pride seemed\n\nquite outdone; that a girl (scarce grown) should resent so trifling\n\nan allusion, and that from her next friend, that she had near\n\nwearied me with praising of!  I had bitter, sharp, hard thoughts of\n\nher, like an angry boy's.  If I had kissed her indeed (I thought),\n\nperhaps she would have taken it pretty well; and only because it\n\nhad been written down, and with a spice of jocularity, up she must\n\nfuff in this ridiculous passion.  It seemed to me there was a want\n\nof penetration in the female sex, to make angels weep over the case\n\nof the poor men.\n\n\n\nWe were side by side again at supper, and what a change was there!\n\nShe was like curdled milk to me; her face was like a wooden doll's;\n\nI could have indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet,\n\nbut she gave me not the least occasion to do either.  No sooner the\n\nmeal done than she betook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I\n\nthink she had a little neglected heretofore.  But she was to make\n\nup for lost time, and in what remained of the passage was\n\nextraordinary assiduous with the old lady, and on deck began to\n\nmake a great deal more than I thought wise of Captain Sang.  Not\n\nbut what the Captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man; but I hated to\n\nbehold her in the least familiarity with anyone except myself.\n\n\n\nAltogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant to keep\n\nherself surrounded with others, that I must watch a long while\n\nbefore I could find my opportunity; and after it was found, I made\n\nnot much of it, as you are now to hear.\n\n\n\n\"I have no guess how I have offended,\" said I; \"it should scarce be\n\nbeyond pardon, then.  O, try if you can pardon me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have no pardon to give,\" said she; and the words seemed to come\n\nout of her throat like marbles.  \"I will be very much obliged for\n\nall your friendships.\"  And she made me an eighth part of a\n\ncurtsey.\n\n\n\nBut I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and I was going\n\nto say it too.\n\n\n\n\"There is one thing,\" said I.  \"If I have shocked your\n\nparticularity by the showing of that letter, it cannot touch Miss\n\nGrant.  She wrote not to you, but to a poor, common, ordinary lad,\n\nwho might have had more sense than show it.  If you are to blame\n\nme--\"\n\n\n\n\"I will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all events!\"\n\nsaid Catriona.  \"It is her I will never look the road of, not if\n\nshe lay dying.\"  She turned away from me, and suddenly back.  \"Will\n\nyou swear you will have no more to deal with her?\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, and I will never be so unjust then,\" said I; \"nor yet so\n\nungrateful.\"\n\n\n\nAnd now it was I that turned away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII--HELVOETSLUYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in the\n\nshrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour and\n\ncry out among the billows.  The song of the leadsman in the chains\n\nwas now scarce ceasing, for we thrid all the way among shoals.\n\nAbout nine in the morning, in a burst of wintry sun between two\n\nsqualls of hail, I had my first look of Holland--a line of\n\nwindmills birling in the breeze.  It was besides my first knowledge\n\nof these daft-like contrivances, which gave me a near sense of\n\nforeign travel and a new world and life.  We came to an anchor\n\nabout half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys, in a\n\nplace where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched\n\noutrageously.  You may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs.\n\nGebbie, some of us in cloaks, others mantled in the ship's\n\ntarpaulins, all clinging on by ropes, and jesting the most like old\n\nsailor-folk that we could imitate.\n\n\n\nPresently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly\n\nalongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch.\n\nThence Captain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and\n\nthe rest of us crowding about, the nature of the difficulty was\n\nmade plain to all.  The Rose was bound to the port of Rotterdam,\n\nwhither the other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive,\n\nin view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the\n\ndirection of the Upper Germany.  This, with the present half-gale\n\nof wind, the captain (if no time were lost) declared himself still\n\ncapable to save.  Now James More had trysted in Helvoet with his\n\ndaughter, and the captain had engaged to call before the port and\n\nplace her (according to the custom) in a shore boat.  There was the\n\nboat, to be sure, and here was Catriona ready:  but both our master\n\nand the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was\n\nin no humour to delay.\n\n\n\n\"Your father,\" said he, \"would be gey an little pleased if we was\n\nto break a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of you.\n\nTake my way of it,\" says he, \"and come on-by with the rest of us\n\nhere to Rotterdam.  Ye can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing\n\nscoot as far as to the Brill, and thence on again, by a place in a\n\nrattel-waggon, back to Helvoet.\"\n\n\n\nBut Catriona would hear of no change.  She looked white-like as she\n\nbeheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes\n\npoured upon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and\n\nswooping of the boat among the billows; but she stood firmly by her\n\nfather's orders.  \"My father, James More, will have arranged it\n\nso,\" was her first word and her last.  I thought it very idle and\n\nindeed wanton in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so\n\nmuch kind advice; but the fact is she had a very good reason, if\n\nshe would have told us.  Sailing scoots and rattel-waggons are\n\nexcellent things; only the use of them must first be paid for, and\n\nall she was possessed of in the world was just two shillings and a\n\npenny halfpenny sterling.  So it fell out that captain and\n\npassengers, not knowing of her destitution--and she being too proud\n\nto tell them--spoke in vain.\n\n\n\n\"But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,\" said one.\n\n\n\n\"It is very true,\" says she, \"but since the year '46 there are so\n\nmany of the honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well.  I\n\nthank you.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh,\n\nothers looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a\n\npassion.  I believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having\n\naccepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen\n\nher safe:  nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it\n\nmust have involved the lose of his conveyance; and I think he made\n\nit up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice.  At least he\n\nbroke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a\n\ndisgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at\n\nany event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of\n\nnasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.  I was thinking\n\nsomething of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged with\n\nhim to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in\n\nLeyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.\n\n\n\n\"I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,\" said I.  \"It\n\nis all one what way I go to Leyden;\" and leaped at the same time\n\ninto the boat, which I managed not so elegantly but what I fell\n\nwith two of the fishers in the bilge.\n\n\n\nFrom the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from\n\nthe ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and\n\nmenaced us so perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the\n\nanchor cable.  I began to think I had made a fool's bargain, that\n\nit was merely impossible Catriona should be got on board to me, and\n\nthat I stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no\n\nhope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James More, if I\n\nshould want to.  But this was to reckon without the lass's courage.\n\nShe had seen me leap with very little appearance (however much\n\nreality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not to be beat by her\n\ndiscarded friend.  Up she stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay,\n\nthe wind blowing in her petticoats, which made the enterprise more\n\ndangerous, and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than\n\nwould be thought genteel in cities.  There was no minute lost, and\n\nscarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the same.\n\nI stood up on the other side and spread my arms; the ship swung\n\ndown on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was\n\nperhaps wholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air.  I was so\n\nhappy as to catch her, and the fishers readily supporting us,\n\nescaped a fall.  She held to me a moment very tight, breathing\n\nquick and deep; thence (she still clinging to me with both hands)\n\nwe were passed aft to our places by the steersman; and Captain Sang\n\nand all the crew and passengers cheering and crying farewell, the\n\nboat was put about for shore.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me\n\nsuddenly, but said no word.  No more did I; and indeed the\n\nwhistling of the wind and the breaching of the sprays made it no\n\ntime for speech; and our crew not only toiled excessively but made\n\nextremely little way, so that the Rose had got her anchor and was\n\noff again before we had approached the harbour mouth.\n\n\n\nWe were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according to\n\ntheir beastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required of us\n\nour fares.  Two guilders was the man's demand--between three and\n\nfour shillings English money--for each passenger.  But at this\n\nCatriona began to cry out with a vast deal of agitation.  She had\n\nasked of Captain Sang, she said, and the fare was but an English\n\nshilling.  \"Do you think I will have come on board and not ask\n\nfirst?\" cries she.  The patroon scolded back upon her in a lingo\n\nwhere the oaths were English and the rest right Hollands; till at\n\nlast (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in the rogue's\n\nhand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to receive\n\nfrom her the other shilling without more complaint.  No doubt I was\n\na good deal nettled and ashamed.  I like to see folk thrifty, but\n\nnot with so much passion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly\n\nthat I asked her, as the boat moved on again for shore, where it\n\nwas that she was trysted with her father.\n\n\n\n\"He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest\n\nScotch merchant,\" says she; and then with the same breath, \"I am\n\nwishing to thank you very much--you are a brave friend to me.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will be time enough when I get you to your father,\" said I,\n\nlittle thinking that I spoke so true.  \"I can tell him a fine tale\n\nof a loyal daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\"O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,\" she\n\ncried, with a great deal of painfulness in the expression.  \"I do\n\nnot think my heart is true.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all to\n\nobey a father's orders,\" I observed.\n\n\n\n\"I cannot have you to be thinking of me so,\" she cried again.\n\n\"When you had done that same, how would I stop behind?  And at all\n\nevents that was not all the reasons.\"  Whereupon, with a burning\n\nface, she told me the plain truth upon her poverty.\n\n\n\n\"Good guide us!\" cried I, \"what kind of daft-like proceeding is\n\nthis, to let yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with\n\nan empty purse--I count it hardly decent--scant decent!\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,\" said she.\n\n\"He is a hunted exile.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"And was this fair to them that care for you?  Was it fair to me?\n\nwas it fair to Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would be\n\ndriven fair horn-mad if she could hear of it?  Was it even fair to\n\nthese Gregory folk that you were living with, and used you\n\nlovingly?  It's a blessing you have fallen in my hands!  Suppose\n\nyour father hindered by an accident, what would become of you here,\n\nand you your lee-lone in a strange place?  The thought of the thing\n\nfrightens me,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\"I will have lied to all of them,\" she replied.  \"I will have told\n\nthem all that I had plenty.  I told HER too.  I could not be\n\nlowering James More to them.\"\n\n\n\nI found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very\n\ndust, for the lie was originally the father's, not the daughter's,\n\nand she thus obliged to persevere in it for the man's reputation.\n\nBut at the time I was ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her\n\ndestitution and the perils in which see must have fallen, had\n\nruffled me almost beyond reason.\n\n\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" said I, \"you will have to learn more sense.\"\n\n\n\nI left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where I\n\ngot a direction for Sprott's house in my new French, and we walked\n\nthere--it was some little way--beholding the place with wonder as\n\nwe went.  Indeed, there was much for Scots folk to admire:  canals\n\nand trees being intermingled with the houses; the houses, each\n\nwithin itself, of a brave red brick, the colour of a rose, with\n\nsteps and benches of blue marble at the cheek of every door, and\n\nthe whole town so clean you might have dined upon the causeway.\n\nSprott was within, upon his ledgers, in a low parlour, very neat\n\nand clean, and set out with china and pictures, and a globe of the\n\nearth in a brass frame.  He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty man,\n\nwith a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not that much\n\ncivility as offer us a seat.\n\n\n\n\"Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?\" says I.\n\n\n\n\"I ken nobody by such a name,\" says he, impatient-like.\n\n\n\n\"Since you are so particular,\" says I, \"I will amend my question,\n\nand ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond,\n\nalias Macgregor, alias James More, late tenant in Inveronachile?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir,\" says he, \"he may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my part\n\nI wish he was.\"\n\n\n\n\"The young lady is that gentleman's daughter, sir,\" said I, \"before\n\nwhom, I think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming to\n\ndiscuss his character.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!\" cries he\n\nin his gross voice.\n\n\n\n\"Under your favour, Mr. Sprott,\" said I, \"this young lady is come\n\nfrom Scotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given the\n\nname of your house for a direction.  An error it seems to have\n\nbeen, but I think this places both you and me--who am but her\n\nfellow-traveller by accident--under a strong obligation to help our\n\ncountrywoman.\"\n\n\n\n\"Will you ding me daft?\" he cries.  \"I tell ye I ken naething and\n\ncare less either for him or his breed.  I tell ye the man owes me\n\nmoney.\"\n\n\n\n\"That may very well be, sir,\" said I, who was now rather more angry\n\nthan himself.  \"At least, I owe you nothing; the young lady is\n\nunder my protection; and I am neither at all used with these\n\nmanners, nor in the least content with them.\"\n\n\n\nAs I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did, I\n\ndrew a step or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere good\n\nfortune, on the only argument that could at all affect the man.\n\nThe blood left his lusty countenance.\n\n\n\n\"For the Lord's sake dinna be hasty, sir!\" he cried.  \"I am truly\n\nwishfu' no to be offensive.  But ye ken, sir, I'm like a wheen\n\nguid-natured, honest, canty auld fellows--my bark is waur nor my\n\nbite.  To hear me, ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour;\n\nbut na, na! it's a kind auld fallow at heart, Sandie Sprott!  And\n\nye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" said I.  \"Then I will make that much freedom with\n\nyour kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're welcome, sir!\" said he.  \"As for the young leddy (my\n\nrespects to her!), he'll just have clean forgotten her.  I ken the\n\nman, ye see; I have lost siller by him ere now.  He thinks of\n\nnaebody but just himsel'; clan, king, or dauchter, if he can get\n\nhis wameful, he would give them a' the go-by! ay, or his\n\ncorrespondent either.  For there is a sense in whilk I may be\n\nnearly almost said to be his correspondent.  The fact is, we are\n\nemployed thegether in a business affair, and I think it's like to\n\nturn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott.  The man's as guid's my\n\npairtner, and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is.\n\nHe micht be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he\n\nmichtnae come for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething--or just\n\nat the ae thing, and that's if he was to pay me my siller.  Ye see\n\nwhat way I stand with it; and it's clear I'm no very likely to\n\nmeddle up with the young leddy, as ye ca' her.  She cannae stop\n\nhere, that's ae thing certain sure.  Dod, sir, I'm a lone man!  If\n\nI was to tak her in, its highly possible the hellicat would try and\n\ngar me marry her when he turned up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Enough of this talk,\" said I.  \"I will take the young leddy among\n\nbetter friends.  Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave\n\nhere for James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden.  He\n\ncan inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter.\"\n\n\n\nThis word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott of\n\nhis own motion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with Miss\n\nDrummond's mails, and even send a porter for them to the inn.  I\n\nadvanced him to that effect a dollar or two to be a cover, and he\n\ngave me an acknowledgment in writing of the sum.\n\n\n\nWhereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of this\n\nunpalatable rascal.  She had said no word throughout, leaving me to\n\njudge and speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been careful not\n\nto embarrass her by a glance; and even now, although my heart still\n\nglowed inside of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to\n\nseem quite easy.\n\n\n\n\"Now,\" said I, \"let us get back to yon same inn where they can\n\nspeak the French, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for\n\nconveyances to Rotterdam.  I will never be easy till I have you\n\nsafe again in the hands of Mrs. Gebbie.\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose it will have to be,\" said Catriona, \"though whoever will\n\nbe pleased, I do not think it will be her.  And I will remind you\n\nthis once again that I have but one shilling, and three baubees.\"\n\n\n\n\"And just this once again,\" said I, \"I will remind you it was a\n\nblessing that I came alongst with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"What else would I be thinking all this time?\" says she, and I\n\nthought weighed a little on my arm.  \"It is you that are the good\n\nfriend to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII--TRAVELS IN HOLLAND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with\n\nbenches, carried us in four hours of travel to the great city of\n\nRotterdam.  It was long past dark by then, but the streets were\n\npretty brightly lighted and thronged with wild-like, outlandish\n\ncharacters--bearded Hebrews, black men, and the hordes of\n\ncourtesans, most indecently adorned with finery and stopping seamen\n\nby their very sleeves; the clash of talk about us made our heads to\n\nwhirl; and what was the most unexpected of all, we appeared to be\n\nno more struck with all these foreigners than they with us.  I made\n\nthe best face I could, for the lass's sake and my own credit; but\n\nthe truth is I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my\n\nbosom with anxiety.  Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or\n\nthe berth of the ship Rose:  but either fell on some who spoke only\n\nHollands, or my own French failed me.  Trying a street at a\n\nventure, I came upon a lane of lighted houses, the doors and\n\nwindows thronged with wauf-like painted women; these jostled and\n\nmocked upon us as we passed, and I was thankful we had nothing of\n\ntheir language.  A little after we issued forth upon an open place\n\nalong the harbour.\n\n\n\n\"We shall be doing now,\" cries I, as soon as I spied masts.  \"Let\n\nus walk here by the harbour.  We are sure to meet some that has the\n\nEnglish, and at the best of it we may light upon that very ship.\"\n\n\n\nWe did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the evening,\n\nwhom should we walk into the arms of but Captain Sang?  He told us\n\nthey had made their run in the most incredible brief time, the wind\n\nholding strong till they reached port; by which means his\n\npassengers were all gone already on their further travels.  It was\n\nimpossible to chase after the Gebbies into the High Germany, and we\n\nhad no other acquaintance to fall back upon but Captain Sang\n\nhimself.  It was the more gratifying to find the man friendly and\n\nwishful to assist.  He made it a small affair to find some good\n\nplain family of merchants, where Catriona might harbour till the\n\nRose was loaden; declared he would then blithely carry her back to\n\nLeith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of Mr. Gregory; and\n\nin the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the meal we\n\nstood in need of.  He seemed extremely friendly, as I say, but what\n\nsurprised me a good deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and the\n\ncause of this was soon to appear.  For at the ordinary, calling for\n\nRhenish wine and drinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably\n\ntipsy.  In this case, as too common with all men, but especially\n\nwith those of his rough trade, what little sense or manners he\n\npossessed deserted him; and he behaved himself so scandalous to the\n\nyoung lady, jesting most ill-favouredly at the figure she had made\n\non the ship's rail, that I had no resource but carry her suddenly\n\naway.\n\n\n\nShe came out of the ordinary clinging to me close.  \"Take me away,\n\nDavid,\" she said.  \"YOU keep me.  I am not afraid with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And have no cause, my little friend!\" cried I, and could have\n\nfound it in my heart to weep.\n\n\n\n\"Where will you be taking me?\" she said again.  \"Don't leave me at\n\nall events--never leave me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where am I taking you to?\" says I stopping, for I had been staving\n\non ahead in mere blindness.  \"I must stop and think.  But I'll not\n\nleave you, Catriona; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I\n\nshould fail or fash you.\"\n\n\n\nShe crept close into me by way of a reply.\n\n\n\n\"Here,\" I said, \"is the stillest place we have hit on yet in this\n\nbusy byke of a city.  Let us sit down here under yon tree and\n\nconsider of our course.\"\n\n\n\nThat tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by the\n\nharbour side.  It was like a black night, but lights were in the\n\nhouses, and nearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a shining of\n\nthe city on the one hand, and a buzz hung over it of many thousands\n\nwalking and talking; on the other, it was dark and the water\n\nbubbled on the sides.  I spread my cloak upon a builder's stone,\n\nand made her sit there; she would have kept her hold upon me, for\n\nshe still shook with the late affronts; but I wanted to think\n\nclear, disengaged myself, and paced to and fro before her, in the\n\nmanner of what we call a smuggler's walk, belabouring my brains for\n\nany remedy.  By the course of these scattering thoughts I was\n\nbrought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that, in the heat\n\nand haste of our departure, I had left Captain Sang to pay the\n\nordinary.  At this I began to laugh out loud, for I thought the man\n\nwell served; and at the same time, by an instinctive movement,\n\ncarried my hand to the pocket where my money was.  I suppose it was\n\nin the lane where the women jostled us; but there is only the one\n\nthing certain, that my purse was gone.\n\n\n\n\"You will have thought of something good,\" said she, observing me\n\nto pause.\n\n\n\nAt the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear as a\n\nperspective glass, and I saw there was no choice of methods.  I had\n\nnot one doit of coin, but in my pocket-book I had still my letter\n\non the Leyden merchant; and there was now but the one way to get to\n\nLeyden, and that was to walk on our two feet.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"I know you're brave and I believe you're\n\nstrong--do you think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road?\"\n\nWe found it, I believe, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was\n\nmy notion of the distance.\n\n\n\n\"David,\" she said, \"if you will just keep near, I will go anywhere\n\nand do anything.  The courage of my heart, it is all broken.  Do\n\nnot be leaving me in this horrible country by myself, and I will do\n\nall else.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you start now and march all night?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I will do all that you can ask of me,\" she said, \"and never ask\n\nyou why.  I have been a bad ungrateful girl to you; and do what you\n\nplease with me now!  And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best\n\nlady in the world,\" she added, \"and I do not see what she would\n\ndeny you for at all events.\"\n\n\n\nThis was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other matters to\n\nconsider, and the first of these was to get clear of that city on\n\nthe Leyden road.  It proved a cruel problem; and it may have been\n\none or two at night ere we had solved it.  Once beyond the houses,\n\nthere was neither moon nor stars to guide us; only the whiteness of\n\nthe way in the midst and a blackness of an alley on both hands.\n\nThe walking was besides made most extraordinary difficult by a\n\nplain black frost that fell suddenly in the small hours and turned\n\nthat highway into one long slide.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Catriona,\" said I, \"here we are like the king's sons and the\n\nold wives' daughters in your daft-like Highland tales.  Soon we'll\n\nbe going over the 'SEVEN BENS, THE SEVEN GLENS AND THE SEVEN\n\nMOUNTAIN MOORS'.\"  Which was a common byword or overcome in those\n\ntales of hers that had stuck in my memory.\n\n\n\n\"Ah,\" says she, \"but here are no glens or mountains!  Though I will\n\nnever be denying but what the trees and some of the plain places\n\nhereabouts are very pretty.  But our country is the best yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"I wish we could say as much for our own folk,\" says I, recalling\n\nSprott and Sang, and perhaps James More himself.\n\n\n\n\"I will never complain of the country of my friend,\" said she, and\n\nspoke it out with an accent so particular that I seemed to see the\n\nlook upon her face.\n\n\n\nI caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for my pains) on\n\nthe black ice.\n\n\n\n\"I do not know what YOU think, Catriona,\" said I, when I was a\n\nlittle recovered, \"but this has been the best day yet!  I think\n\nshame to say it, when you have met in with such misfortunes and\n\ndisfavours; but for me, it has been the best day yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was a good day when you showed me so much love,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"And yet I think shame to be happy too,\" I went on, \"and you here\n\non the road in the black night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where in the great world would I be else?\" she cried.  \"I am\n\nthinking I am safest where I am with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am quite forgiven, then?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in\n\nyour mouth again?\" she cried.  \"There is nothing in this heart to\n\nyou but thanks.  But I will be honest too,\" she added, with a kind\n\nof suddenness, \"and I'll never can forgive that girl.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is this Miss Grant again?\" said I.  \"You said yourself she was the\n\nbest lady in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\"So she will be, indeed!\" says Catriona.  \"But I will never forgive\n\nher for all that.  I will never, never forgive her, and let me hear\n\ntell of her no more.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"this beats all that ever came to my knowledge; and\n\nI wonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims.  Here\n\nis a young lady that was the best friend in the world to the both\n\nof us, that learned us how to dress ourselves, and in a great\n\nmanner how to behave, as anyone can see that knew us both before\n\nand after.\"\n\n\n\nBut Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway.\n\n\n\n\"It is this way of it,\" said she.  \"Either you will go on to speak\n\nof her, and I will go back to yon town, and let come of it what God\n\npleases!  Or else you will do me that politeness to talk of other\n\nthings.\"\n\n\n\nI was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I bethought me\n\nthat she depended altogether on my help, that she was of the frail\n\nsex and not so much beyond a child, and it was for me to be wise\n\nfor the pair of us.\n\n\n\n\"My dear girl,\" said I, \"I can make neither head nor tails of this;\n\nbut God forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee.  As\n\nfor talking of Miss Grant, I have no such a mind to it, and I\n\nbelieve it was yourself began it.  My only design (if I took you up\n\nat all) was for your own improvement, for I hate the very look of\n\ninjustice.  Not that I do not wish you to have a good pride and a\n\nnice female delicacy; they become you well; but here you show them\n\nto excess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, then, have you done?\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"I have done,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"A very good thing,\" said she, and we went on again, but now in\n\nsilence.\n\n\n\nIt was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night, beholding\n\nonly shadows and hearing nought but our own steps.  At first, I\n\nbelieve our hearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity;\n\nbut the darkness and the cold, and the silence, which only the\n\ncocks sometimes interrupted, or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had\n\npretty soon brought down our pride to the dust; and for my own\n\nparticular, I would have jumped at any decent opening for speech.\n\n\n\nBefore the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and the frost was\n\nall wiped away from among our feet.  I took my cloak to her and\n\nsought to hap her in the same; she bade me, rather impatiently, to\n\nkeep it.\n\n\n\n\"Indeed and I will do no such thing,\" said I.  \"Here am I, a great,\n\nugly lad that has seen all kinds of weather, and here are you a\n\ntender, pretty maid!  My dear, you would not put me to a shame?\"\n\n\n\nWithout more words she let me cover her; which as I was doing in\n\nthe darkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost\n\nlike an embrace.\n\n\n\n\"You must try to be more patient of your friend,\" said I.\n\n\n\nI thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against\n\nmy bosom, or perhaps it was but fancy.\n\n\n\n\"There will be no end to your goodness,\" said she.\n\n\n\nAnd we went on again in silence; but now all was changed; and the\n\nhappiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney.\n\n\n\nThe rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as we came\n\ninto the town of Delft.  The red gabled houses made a handsome show\n\non either hand of a canal; the servant lassies were out slestering\n\nand scrubbing at the very stones upon the public highway; smoke\n\nrose from a hundred kitchens; and it came in upon me strongly it\n\nwas time to break our fasts.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"I believe you have yet a shilling and three\n\nbaubees?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you wanting it?\" said she, and passed me her purse.  \"I am\n\nwishing it was five pounds!  What will you want it for?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what have we been walking for all night, like a pair of waif\n\nEgyptians!\" says I.  \"Just because I was robbed of my purse and all\n\nI possessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam.  I will tell you of\n\nit now, because I think the worst is over, but we have still a good\n\ntramp before us till we get to where my money is, and if you would\n\nnot buy me a piece of bread, I were like to go fasting.\"\n\n\n\nShe looked at me with open eyes.  By the light of the new day she\n\nwas all black and pale for weariness, so that my heart smote me for\n\nher.  But as for her, she broke out laughing.\n\n\n\n\"My torture! are we beggars then!\" she cried.  \"You too?  O, I\n\ncould have wished for this same thing!  And I am glad to buy your\n\nbreakfast to you.  But it would be pleisand if I would have had to\n\ndance to get a meal to you!  For I believe they are not very well\n\nacquainted with our manner of dancing over here, and might be\n\npaying for the curiosity of that sight.\"\n\n\n\nI could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover's mind, but\n\nin a heat of admiration.  For it always warms a man to see a woman\n\nbrave.\n\n\n\nWe got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the\n\ntown, and in a baker's, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling\n\nbread, which we ate upon the road as we went on.  That road from\n\nDelft to the Hague is just five miles of a fine avenue shaded with\n\ntrees, a canal on the one hand, on the other excellent pastures of\n\ncattle.  It was pleasant here indeed.\n\n\n\n\"And now, Davie,\" said she, \"what will you do with me at all\n\nevents?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is what we have to speak of,\" said I, \"and the sooner yet the\n\nbetter.  I can come by money in Leyden; that will be all well.  But\n\nthe trouble is how to dispose of you until your father come.  I\n\nthought last night you seemed a little sweir to part from me?\"\n\n\n\n\"It will be more than seeming then,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"You are a very young maid,\" said I, \"and I am but a very young\n\ncallant.  This is a great piece of difficulty.  What way are we to\n\nmanage?  Unless indeed, you could pass to be my sister?\"\n\n\n\n\"And what for no?\" said she, \"if you would let me!\"\n\n\n\n\"I wish you were so, indeed,\" I cried.  \"I would be a fine man if I\n\nhad such a sister.  But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond.\"\n\n\n\n\"And now I will be Catriona Balfour,\" she said.  \"And who is to\n\nken?  They are all strange folk here.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you think that it would do,\" says I.  \"I own it troubles me.  I\n\nwould like it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\"David, I have no friend here but you,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"The mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,\" said I.  \"I\n\nam too young to advise you, or you to be advised.  I see not what\n\nelse we are to do, and yet I ought to warn you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will have no choice left,\" said she.  \"My father James More has\n\nnot used me very well, and it is not the first time, I am cast upon\n\nyour hands like a sack of barley meal, and have nothing else to\n\nthink of but your pleasure.  If you will have me, good and well.\n\nIf you will not\"--she turned and touched her hand upon my arm--\n\n\"David, I am afraid,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"No, but I ought to warn you,\" I began; and then bethought me I was\n\nthe bearer of the purse, and it would never do to seem too\n\nchurlish.  \"Catriona,\" said I, \"don't misunderstand me:  I am just\n\ntrying to do my duty by you, girl!  Here am I going alone to this\n\nstrange city, to be a solitary student there; and here is this\n\nchance arisen that you might dwell with me a bit, and be like my\n\nsister; you can surely understand this much, my dear, that I would\n\njust love to have you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and here I am,\" said she.  \"So that's soon settled.\"\n\n\n\nI know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain.  I know this\n\nwas a great blot on my character, for which I was lucky that I did\n\nnot pay more dear.  But I minded how easy her delicacy had been\n\nstartled with a word of kissing her in Barbara's letter; now that\n\nshe depended on me, how was I to be more bold?  Besides, the truth\n\nis, I could see no other feasible method to dispose of her.  And I\n\ndaresay inclination pulled me very strong.\n\n\n\nA little beyond the Hague she fell very lame and made the rest of\n\nthe distance heavily enough.  Twice she must rest by the wayside,\n\nwhich she did with pretty apologies, calling herself a shame to the\n\nHighlands and the race she came of, and nothing but a hindrance to\n\nmyself.  It was her excuse, she said, that she was not much used\n\nwith walking shod.  I would have had her strip off her shoes and\n\nstockings and go barefoot.  But she pointed out to me that the\n\nwomen of that country, even in the landward roads, appeared to be\n\nall shod.\n\n\n\n\"I must not be disgracing my brother,\" said she, and was very merry\n\nwith it all, although her face told tales of her.\n\n\n\nThere is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded below with\n\nclean sand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some\n\npreached, and the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours.\n\nHere I left Catriona, and went forward by myself to find my\n\ncorrespondent.  There I drew on my credit, and asked to be\n\nrecommended to some decent, retired lodging.  My baggage being not\n\nyet arrived, I told him I supposed I should require his caution\n\nwith the people of the house; and explained that, my sister being\n\ncome for a while to keep house with me, I should be wanting two\n\nchambers.  This was all very well; but the trouble was that Mr.\n\nBalfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great\n\ndeal of particulars, and never a word of any sister in the case.  I\n\ncould see my Dutchman was extremely suspicious; and viewing me over\n\nthe rims of a great pair of spectacles--he was a poor, frail body,\n\nand reminded me of an infirm rabbit--he began to question me close.\n\n\n\nHere I fell in a panic.  Suppose he accept my tale (thinks I),\n\nsuppose he invite my sister to his house, and that I bring her.  I\n\nshall have a fine ravelled pirn to unwind, and may end by\n\ndisgracing both the lassie and myself.  Thereupon I began hastily\n\nto expound to him my sister's character.  She was of a bashful\n\ndisposition, it appeared, and be extremely fearful of meeting\n\nstrangers that I had left her at that moment sitting in a public\n\nplace alone.  And then, being launched upon the stream of\n\nfalsehood, I must do like all the rest of the world in the same\n\ncircumstance, and plunge in deeper than was any service; adding\n\nsome altogether needless particulars of Miss Balfour's ill-health\n\nand retirement during childhood.  In the midst of which I awoke to\n\na sense of my behaviour, and was turned to one blush.\n\n\n\nThe old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a\n\nwillingness to be quit of me.  But he was first of all a man of\n\nbusiness; and knowing that my money was good enough, however it\n\nmight be with my conduct, he was so far obliging as to send his son\n\nto be my guide and caution in the matter of a lodging.  This\n\nimplied my presenting of the young man to Catriona.  The poor,\n\npretty child was much recovered with resting, looked and behaved to\n\nperfection, and took my arm and gave me the name of brother more\n\neasily than I could answer her.  But there was one misfortune:\n\nthinking to help, she was rather towardly than otherwise to my\n\nDutchman.  And I could not but reflect that Miss Balfour had rather\n\nsuddenly outgrown her bashfulness.  And there was another thing,\n\nthe difference of our speech.  I had the Low Country tongue and\n\ndwelled upon my words; she had a hill voice, spoke with something\n\nof an English accent, only far more delightful, and was scarce\n\nquite fit to be called a deacon in the craft of talking English\n\ngrammar; so that, for a brother and sister, we made a most uneven\n\npair.  But the young Hollander was a heavy dog, without so much\n\nspirit in his belly as to remark her prettiness, for which I\n\nscorned him.  And as soon as he had found a cover to our heads, he\n\nleft us alone, which was the greater service of the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV--FULL STORY OF A COPY OF HEINECCIUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal.\n\nWe had two rooms, the second entering from the first; each had a\n\nchimney built out into the floor in the Dutch manner; and being\n\nalongside, each had the same prospect from the window of the top of\n\na tree below us in a little court, of a piece of the canal, and of\n\nhouses in the Hollands architecture and a church spire upon the\n\nfurther side.  A full set of bells hung in that spire and made\n\ndelightful music; and when there was any sun at all, it shone\n\ndirect in our two chambers.  From a tavern hard by we had good\n\nmeals sent in.\n\n\n\nThe first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely so.\n\nThere was little talk between us, and I packed her off to her bed\n\nas soon as she had eaten.  The first thing in the morning I wrote\n\nword to Sprott to have her mails sent on, together with a line to\n\nAlan at his chief's; and had the same despatched, and her breakfast\n\nready, ere I waked her.  I was a little abashed when she came forth\n\nin her one habit, and the mud of the way upon her stockings.  By\n\nwhat inquiries I had made, it seemed a good few days must pass\n\nbefore her mails could come to hand in Leyden, and it was plainly\n\nneedful she must have a shift of things.  She was unwilling at\n\nfirst that I should go to that expense; but I reminded her she was\n\nnow a rich man's sister and must appear suitably in the part, and\n\nwe had not got to the second merchant's before she was entirely\n\ncharmed into the spirit of the thing, and her eyes shining.  It\n\npleased me to see her so innocent and thorough in this pleasure.\n\nWhat was more extraordinary was the passion into which I fell on it\n\nmyself; being never satisfied that I had bought her enough or fine\n\nenough, and never weary of beholding her in different attires.\n\nIndeed, I began to understand some little of Miss Grant's immersion\n\nin the interest of clothes; for the truth is, when you have the\n\nground of a beautiful person to adorn, the whole business becomes\n\nbeautiful.  The Dutch chintzes I should say were extraordinary\n\ncheap and fine; but I would be ashamed to set down what I paid for\n\nstockings to her.  Altogether I spent so great a sum upon this\n\npleasuring (as I may call it) that I was ashamed for a great while\n\nto spend more; and by way of a set-off, I left our chambers pretty\n\nbare.  If we had beds, if Catriona was a little braw, and I had\n\nlight to see her by, we were richly enough lodged for me.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her at the\n\ndoor with all our purchases, and go for a long walk alone in which\n\nto read myself a lecture.  Here had I taken under my roof, and as\n\ngood as to my bosom, a young lass extremely beautiful, and whose\n\ninnocence was her peril.  My talk with the old Dutchman, and the\n\nlies to which I was constrained, had already given me a sense of\n\nhow my conduct must appear to others; and now, after the strong\n\nadmiration I had just experienced and the immoderacy with which I\n\nhad continued my vain purchases, I began to think of it myself as\n\nvery hazarded.  I bethought me, if I had a sister indeed, whether I\n\nwould so expose her; then, judging the case too problematical, I\n\nvaried my question into this, whether I would so trust Catriona in\n\nthe hands of any other Christian being; the answer to which made my\n\nface to burn.  The more cause, since I had been entrapped and had\n\nentrapped the girl into an undue situation, that I should behave in\n\nit with scrupulous nicety.  She depended on me wholly for her bread\n\nand shelter; in case I should alarm her delicacy, she had no\n\nretreat.  Besides I was her host and her protector; and the more\n\nirregularly I had fallen in these positions, the less excuse for me\n\nif I should profit by the same to forward even the most honest\n\nsuit; for with the opportunities that I enjoyed, and which no wise\n\nparent would have suffered for a moment, even the most honest suit\n\nwould be unfair.  I saw I must be extremely hold-off in my\n\nrelations; and yet not too much so neither; for if I had no right\n\nto appear at all in the character of a suitor, I must yet appear\n\ncontinually, and if possible agreeably, in that of host.  It was\n\nplain I should require a great deal of tact and conduct, perhaps\n\nmore than my years afforded.  But I had rushed in where angels\n\nmight have feared to tread, and there was no way out of that\n\nposition save by behaving right while I was in it.  I made a set of\n\nrules for my guidance; prayed for strength to be enabled to observe\n\nthem, and as a more human aid to the same end purchased a study-\n\nbook in law.  This being all that I could think of, I relaxed from\n\nthese grave considerations; whereupon my mind bubbled at once into\n\nan effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was like one treading\n\non air that I turned homeward.  As I thought that name of home, and\n\nrecalled the image of that figure awaiting me between four walls,\n\nmy heart beat upon my bosom.\n\n\n\nMy troubles began with my return.  She ran to greet me with an\n\nobvious and affecting pleasure.  She was clad, besides, entirely in\n\nthe new clothes that I had bought for her; looked in them beyond\n\nexpression well; and must walk about and drop me curtseys to\n\ndisplay them and to be admired.  I am sure I did it with an ill\n\ngrace, for I thought to have choked upon the words.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes,\n\nsee what I have done with our two chambers.\"  And she showed me the\n\nplace all very finely swept, and the fires glowing in the two\n\nchimneys.\n\n\n\nI was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than I quite\n\nfelt.  \"Catriona,\" said I, \"I am very much displeased with you, and\n\nyou must never again lay a hand upon my room.  One of us two must\n\nhave the rule while we are here together; it is most fit it should\n\nbe I who am both the man and the elder; and I give you that for my\n\ncommand.\"\n\n\n\nShe dropped me one of her curtseys; which were extraordinary\n\ntaking.  \"If you will be cross,\" said she, \"I must be making pretty\n\nmanners at you, Davie.  I will be very obedient, as I should be\n\nwhen every stitch upon all there is of me belongs to you.  But you\n\nwill not be very cross either, because now I have not anyone else.\"\n\n\n\nThis struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of penitence, to\n\nblot out all the good effect of my last speech.  In this direction\n\nprogress was more easy, being down hill; she led me forward,\n\nsmiling; at the sight of her, in the brightness of the fire and\n\nwith her pretty becks and looks, my heart was altogether melted.\n\nWe made our meal with infinite mirth and tenderness; and the two\n\nseemed to be commingled into one, so that our very laughter sounded\n\nlike a kindness.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of which I awoke to better recollections, made a lame\n\nword of excuse, and set myself boorishly to my studies.  It was a\n\nsubstantial, instructive book that I had bought, by the late Dr.\n\nHeineccius, in which I was to do a great deal reading these next\n\nfew days, and often very glad that I had no one to question me of\n\nwhat I read.  Methought she bit her lip at me a little, and that\n\ncut me.  Indeed it left her wholly solitary, the more as she was\n\nvery little of a reader, and had never a book.  But what was I to\n\ndo?\n\n\n\nSo the rest of the evening flowed by almost without speech.\n\n\n\nI could have beat myself.  I could not lie in my bed that night for\n\nrage and repentance, but walked to and fro on my bare feet till I\n\nwas nearly perished, for the chimney was gone out and the frost\n\nkeen.  The thought of her in the next room, the thought that she\n\nmight even hear me as I walked, the remembrance of my churlishness\n\nand that I must continue to practise the same ungrateful course or\n\nbe dishonoured, put me beside my reason.  I stood like a man\n\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis:  WHAT MUST SHE THINK OF ME? was my\n\none thought that softened me continually into weakness.  WHAT IS TO\n\nBECOME OF US? the other which steeled me again to resolution.  This\n\nwas my first night of wakefulness and divided counsels, of which I\n\nwas now to pass many, pacing like a madman, sometimes weeping like\n\na childish boy, sometimes praying (I fain would hope) like a\n\nChristian.\n\n\n\nBut prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in practice.\n\nIn her presence, and above all if I allowed any beginning of\n\nfamiliarity, I found I had very little command of what should\n\nfollow.  But to sit all day in the same room with her, and feign to\n\nbe engaged upon Heineccius, surpassed my strength.  So that I fell\n\ninstead upon the expedient of absenting myself so much as I was\n\nable; taking out classes and sitting there regularly, often with\n\nsmall attention, the test of which I found the other day in a note-\n\nbook of that period, where I had left off to follow an edifying\n\nlecture and actually scribbled in my book some very ill verses,\n\nthough the Latinity is rather better than I thought that I could\n\never have compassed.  The evil of this course was unhappily near as\n\ngreat as its advantage.  I had the less time of trial, but I\n\nbelieve, while the time lasted, I was tried the more extremely.\n\nFor she being so much left to solitude, she came to greet my return\n\nwith an increasing fervour that came nigh to overmaster me.  These\n\nfriendly offers I must barbarously cast back; and my rejection\n\nsometimes wounded her so cruelly that I must unbend and seek to\n\nmake it up to her in kindness.  So that our time passed in ups and\n\ndowns, tiffs and disappointments, upon the which I could almost say\n\n(if it may be said with reverence) that I was crucified.\n\n\n\nThe base of my trouble was Catriona's extraordinary innocence, at\n\nwhich I was not so much surprised as filled with pity and\n\nadmiration.  She seemed to have no thought of our position, no\n\nsense of my struggles; welcomed any mark of my weakness with\n\nresponsive joy; and when I was drove again to my retrenchments, did\n\nnot always dissemble her chagrin.  There were times when I have\n\nthought to myself, \"If she were over head in love, and set her cap\n\nto catch me, she would scarce behave much otherwise;\" and then I\n\nwould fall again into wonder at the simplicity of woman, from whom\n\nI felt (in these moments) that I was not worthy to be descended.\n\n\n\nThere was one point in particular on which our warfare turned, and\n\nof all things, this was the question of her clothes.  My baggage\n\nhad soon followed me from Rotterdam, and hers from Helvoet.  She\n\nhad now, as it were, two wardrobes; and it grew to be understood\n\nbetween us (I could never tell how) that when she was friendly she\n\nwould wear my clothes, and when otherwise her own.  It was meant\n\nfor a buffet, and (as it were) the renunciation of her gratitude;\n\nand I felt it so in my bosom, but was generally more wise than to\n\nappear to have observed the circumstance.\n\n\n\nOnce, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater than her\n\nown; it fell in this way.  On my return from classes, thinking upon\n\nher devoutly with a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance\n\nin the bargain, the annoyance began to fade away out of my mind;\n\nand spying in a window one of those forced flowers, of which the\n\nHollanders are so skilled in the artifice, I gave way to an impulse\n\nand bought it for Catriona.  I do not know the name of that flower,\n\nbut it was of the pink colour, and I thought she would admire the\n\nsame, and carried it home to her with a wonderful soft heart.  I\n\nhad left her in my clothes, and when I returned to find her all\n\nchanged and a face to match, I cast but the one look at her from\n\nhead to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the window open, and\n\nmy flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence)\n\nmyself out of that room again, of which I slammed she door as I\n\nwent out.\n\n\n\nOn the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought me to\n\nmyself, so that I began at once to see the folly of my conduct.  I\n\nwent, not into the street as I had purposed, but to the house\n\ncourt, which was always a solitary place, and where I saw my flower\n\n(that had cost me vastly more than it was worth) hanging in the\n\nleafless tree.  I stood by the side of the canal, and looked upon\n\nthe ice.  Country people went by on their skates, and I envied\n\nthem.  I could see no way out of the pickle I was in no way so much\n\nas to return to the room I had just left.  No doubt was in my mind\n\nbut I had now betrayed the secret of my feelings; and to make\n\nthings worse, I had shown at the same time (and that with wretched\n\nboyishness) incivility to my helpless guest.\n\n\n\nI suppose she must have seen me from the open window.  It did not\n\nseem to me that I had stood there very long before I heard the\n\ncrunching of footsteps on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat\n\nangrily (for I was in no spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona\n\ndrawing near.  She was all changed again, to the clocked stockings.\n\n\n\n\"Are we not to have our walk to-day?\" said she.\n\n\n\nI was looking at her in a maze.  \"Where is your brooch?\" says I.\n\n\n\nShe carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high.  \"I will have\n\nforgotten it,\" said she.  \"I will run upstairs for it quick, and\n\nthen surely we'll can have our walk?\"\n\n\n\nThere was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me; I had\n\nneither words nor voice to utter them; I could do no more than nod\n\nby way of answer; and the moment she had left me, climbed into the\n\ntree and recovered my flower, which on her return I offered her.\n\n\n\n\"I bought it for you, Catriona,\" said I.\n\n\n\nShe fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch, I could\n\nhave thought tenderly.\n\n\n\n\"It is none the better of my handling,\" said I again, and blushed.\n\n\n\n\"I will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure of that,\" said\n\nshe.\n\n\n\nWe did not speak so much that day; she seemed a thought on the\n\nreserve, though not unkindly.  As for me, all the time of our\n\nwalking, and after we came home, and I had seen her put my flower\n\ninto a pot of water, I was thinking to myself what puzzles women\n\nwere.  I was thinking, the one moment, it was the most stupid thing\n\non earth she should not have perceived my love; and the next, that\n\nshe had certainly perceived it long ago, and (being a wise girl\n\nwith the fine female instinct of propriety) concealed her\n\nknowledge.\n\n\n\nWe had our walk daily.  Out in the streets I felt more safe; I\n\nrelaxed a little in my guardedness; and for one thing, there was no\n\nHeineccius.  This made these periods not only a relief to myself,\n\nbut a particular pleasure to my poor child.  When I came back about\n\nthe hour appointed, I would generally find her ready dressed, and\n\nglowing with anticipation.  She would prolong their duration to the\n\nextreme, seeming to dread (as I did myself) the hour of the return;\n\nand there is scarce a field or waterside near Leyden, scarce a\n\nstreet or lane there, where we have not lingered.  Outside of\n\nthese, I bade her confine herself entirely to our lodgings; this in\n\nthe fear of her encountering any acquaintance, which would have\n\nrendered our position very difficult.  From the same apprehension I\n\nwould never suffer her to attend church, nor even go myself; but\n\nmade some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own\n\nchamber--I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with a very\n\nmuch divided mind.  Indeed, there was scarce anything that more\n\naffected me, than thus to kneel down alone with her before God like\n\nman and wife.\n\n\n\nOne day it was snowing downright hard.  I had thought it not\n\npossible that we should venture forth, and was surprised to find\n\nher waiting for me ready dressed.\n\n\n\n\"I will not be doing without my walk,\" she cried.  \"You are never a\n\ngood boy, Davie, in the house; I will never be caring for you only\n\nin the open air.  I think we two will better turn Egyptian and\n\ndwell by the roadside.\"\n\n\n\nThat was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung near to me in\n\nthe falling snow; it beat about and melted on us, and the drops\n\nstood upon her bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling\n\nmouth.  Strength seemed to come upon me with the sight like a\n\ngiant's; I thought I could have caught her up and run with her into\n\nthe uttermost places in the earth; and we spoke together all that\n\ntime beyond belief for freedom and sweetness.\n\n\n\nIt was the dark night when we came to the house door.  She pressed\n\nmy arm upon her bosom.  \"Thank you kindly for these same good\n\nhours,\" said she, on a deep note of her voice.\n\n\n\nThe concern in which I fell instantly on this address, put me with\n\nthe same swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the\n\nchamber, and the light made, than she beheld the old, dour,\n\nstubborn countenance of the student of Heineccius.  Doubtless she\n\nwas more than usually hurt; and I know for myself, I found it more\n\nthan usually difficult to maintain any strangeness.  Even at the\n\nmeal, I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her; and\n\nit was no sooner over than I fell again to my civilian, with more\n\nseeming abstraction and less understanding than before.  Methought,\n\nas I read, I could hear my heart strike like an eight-day clock.\n\nHard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my eyesight\n\nthat spilled beyond the book upon Catriona.  She sat on the floor\n\nby the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and\n\nshone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a\n\nwonder of fine hues.  Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then\n\nagain at me; and at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself,\n\nand turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking for the text in\n\nchurch.\n\n\n\nSuddenly she called out aloud.  \"O, why does not my father come?\"\n\nshe cried, and fell at once into a storm of tears.\n\n\n\nI leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her side,\n\nand cast an arm around her sobbing body.\n\n\n\nShe put me from her sharply, \"You do not love your friend,\" says\n\nshe.  \"I could be so happy too, if you would let me!\"  And then,\n\n\"O, what will I have done that you should hate me so?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hate you!\" cries I, and held her firm.  \"You blind less, can you\n\nnot see a little in my wretched heart?  Do you not think when I sit\n\nthere, reading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be\n\ndamned to it, I take ever the least thought of any stricken thing\n\nbut just yourself?  Night after night I could have grat to see you\n\nsitting there your lone.  And what was I to do?  You are here under\n\nmy honour; would you punish me for that?  Is it for that that you\n\nwould spurn a loving servant?\"\n\n\n\nAt the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung near to me.  I\n\nraised her face to mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon\n\nmy bosom, clasping me tight.  I saw in a mere whirl like a man\n\ndrunken.  Then I heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my\n\nclothes.\n\n\n\n\"Did you kiss her truly?\" she asked.\n\n\n\nThere went through me so great a heave of surprise that I was all\n\nshook with it.\n\n\n\n\"Miss Grant?\" I cried, all in a disorder.  \"Yes, I asked her to\n\nkiss me good-bye, the which she did.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, well!\" said she, \"you have kissed me too, at all events.\"\n\n\n\nAt the strangeness and sweetness of that word, I saw where we had\n\nfallen; rose, and set her on her feet.\n\n\n\n\"This will never do,\" said I.  \"This will never, never do.  O\n\nCatrine, Catrine!\"  Then there came a pause in which I was debarred\n\nfrom any speaking.  And then, \"Go away to your bed,\" said I.  \"Go\n\naway to your bed and leave me.\"\n\n\n\nShe turned to obey me like a child, and the next I knew of it, had\n\nstopped in the very doorway.\n\n\n\n\"Good night, Davie!\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"And O, good night, my love!\" I cried, with a great outbreak of my\n\nsoul, and caught her to me again, so that it seemed I must have\n\nbroken her.  The next moment I had thrust her from the room, shut\n\nto the door even with violence, and stood alone.\n\n\n\nThe milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth told.  I had\n\ncrept like an untrusty man into the poor maid's affections; she was\n\nin my hand like any frail, innocent thing to make or mar; and what\n\nweapon of defence was left me?  It seemed like a symbol that\n\nHeineccius, my old protection, was now burned.  I repented, yet\n\ncould not find it in my heart to blame myself for that great\n\nfailure.  It seemed not possible to have resisted the boldness of\n\nher innocence or that last temptation of her weeping.  And all that\n\nI had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the greater--it was\n\nupon a nature so defenceless, and with such advantages of the\n\nposition, that I seemed to have practised.\n\n\n\nWhat was to become of us now?  It seemed we could no longer dwell\n\nin the one place.  But where was I to go? or where she?  Without\n\neither choice or fault of ours, life had conspired to wall us\n\ntogether in that narrow place.  I had a wild thought of marrying\n\nout of hand; and the next moment put it from me with revolt.  She\n\nwas a child, she could not tell her own heart; I had surprised her\n\nweakness, I must never go on to build on that surprisal; I must\n\nkeep her not only clear of reproach, but free as she had come to\n\nme.\n\n\n\nDown I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented, and beat\n\nmy brains in vain for any means of escape.  About two of the\n\nmorning, there were three red embers left and the house and all the\n\ncity was asleep, when I was aware of a small sound of weeping in\n\nthe next room.  She thought that I slept, the poor soul; she\n\nregretted her weakness--and what perhaps (God help her!) she called\n\nher forwardness--and in the dead of the night solaced herself with\n\ntears.  Tender and bitter feelings, love and penitence and pity,\n\nstruggled in my soul; it seemed I was under bond to heal that\n\nweeping.\n\n\n\n\"O, try to forgive me!\" I cried out, \"try, try to forgive me.  Let\n\nus forget it all, let us try if we'll no can forget it!\"\n\n\n\nThere came no answer, but the sobbing ceased.  I stood a long while\n\nwith my hands still clasped as I had spoken; then the cold of the\n\nnight laid hold upon me with a shudder, and I think my reason\n\nreawakened.\n\n\n\n\"You can make no hand of this, Davie,\" thinks I.  \"To bed with you\n\nlike a wise lad, and try if you can sleep.  To-morrow you may see\n\nyour way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV--THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a\n\nknocking on my door, ran to open it, and had almost swooned with\n\nthe contrariety of my feelings, mostly painful; for on the\n\nthreshold, in a rough wraprascal and an extraordinary big laced\n\nhat, there stood James More.\n\n\n\nI ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was\n\na sense in which the man came like an answer to prayer.  I had been\n\nsaying till my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate,\n\nand looking till my head ached for any possible means of\n\nseparation.  Here were the means come to me upon two legs, and joy\n\nwas the hindmost of my thoughts.  It is to be considered, however,\n\nthat even if the weight of the future were lifted off me by the\n\nman's arrival, the present heaved up the more black and menacing;\n\nso that, as I first stood before him in my shirt and breeches, I\n\nbelieve I took a leaping step backward like a person shot.\n\n\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I have found you, Mr, Balfour.\"  And offered me his\n\nlarge, fine hand, the which (recovering at the same time my post in\n\nthe doorway, as if with some thought of resistance) I took him by\n\ndoubtfully.  \"It is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs\n\nappear to intermingle,\" he continued.  \"I am owing you an apology\n\nfor an unfortunate intrusion upon yours, which I suffered myself to\n\nbe entrapped into by my confidence in that false-face,\n\nPrestongrange; I think shame to own to you that I was ever trusting\n\nto a lawyer.\"  He shrugged his shoulders with a very French air.\n\n\"But indeed the man is very plausible,\" says he.  \"And now it seems\n\nthat you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my\n\ndaughter, for whose direction I was remitted to yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think, sir,\" said I, with a very painful air, \"that it will be\n\nnecessary we two should have an explanation.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is nothing amiss?\" he asked.  \"My agent, Mr. Sprott--\"\n\n\n\n\"For God's sake moderate your voice!\" I cried.  \"She must not hear\n\ntill we have had an explanation.\"\n\n\n\n\"She is in this place?\" cries he.\n\n\n\n\"That is her chamber door,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"You are here with her alone?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"And who else would I have got to stay with us?\" cries I.\n\n\n\nI will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale.\n\n\n\n\"This is very unusual,\" said he.  \"This is a very unusual\n\ncircumstance.  You are right, we must hold an explanation.\"\n\n\n\nSo saying he passed me by, and I must own the tall old rogue\n\nappeared at that moment extraordinary dignified.  He had now, for\n\nthe first time, the view of my chamber, which I scanned (I may say)\n\nwith his eyes.  A bit of morning sun glinted in by the window pane,\n\nand showed it off; my bed, my mails, and washing dish, with some\n\ndisorder of my clothes, and the unlighted chimney, made the only\n\nplenishing; no mistake but it looked bare and cold, and the most\n\nunsuitable, beggarly place conceivable to harbour a young lady.  At\n\nthe same time came in on my mind the recollection of the clothes\n\nthat I had bought for her; and I thought this contrast of poverty\n\nand prodigality bore an ill appearance.\n\n\n\nHe looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing\n\nelse to his purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of\n\nit; where, after I had closed the door, I could not very well avoid\n\njoining him.  For however this extraordinary interview might end,\n\nit must pass if possible without waking Catriona; and the one thing\n\nneedful was that we should sit close and talk low.  But I can\n\nscarce picture what a pair we made; he in his great coat which the\n\ncoldness of my chamber made extremely suitable; I shivering in my\n\nshirt and breeks; he with very much the air of a judge; and I\n\n(whatever I looked) with very much the feelings of a man who has\n\nheard the last trumpet.\n\n\n\n\"Well?\" says he.\n\n\n\nAnd \"Well,\" I began, but found myself unable to go further.\n\n\n\n\"You tell me she is here?\" said he again, but now with a spice of\n\nimpatience that seemed to brace me up.\n\n\n\n\"She is in this house,\" said I, \"and I knew the circumstance would\n\nbe called unusual.  But you are to consider how very unusual the\n\nwhole business was from the beginning.  Here is a young lady landed\n\non the coast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny.\n\nShe is directed to yon man Sprott in Helvoet.  I hear you call him\n\nyour agent.  All I can say is he could do nothing but damn and\n\nswear at the mere mention of your name, and I must fee him out of\n\nmy own pocket even to receive the custody of her effects.  You\n\nspeak of unusual circumstances, Mr. Drummond, if that be the name\n\nyou prefer.  Here was a circumstance, if you like, to which it was\n\nbarbarity to have exposed her.\"\n\n\n\n\"But this is what I cannot understand the least,\" said James.  \"My\n\ndaughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons,\n\nwhose names I have forgot.\"  \"Gebbie was the name,\" said I; \"and\n\nthere is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie should have gone ashore with her\n\nat Helvoet.  But he did not, Mr. Drummond; and I think you might\n\npraise God that I was there to offer in his place.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,\" said he.\n\n\"As for yourself, I think it might have occurred that you were\n\nsomewhat young for such a post.\"\n\n\n\n\"But the choice was not between me and somebody else, it was\n\nbetween me and nobody,\" cried I.  \"Nobody offered in my place, and\n\nI must say I think you show a very small degree of gratitude to me\n\nthat did.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the\n\nparticular,\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,\" said I.\n\n\"Your child was deserted, she was clean flung away in the midst of\n\nEurope, with scarce two shillings, and not two words of any\n\nlanguage spoken there:  I must say, a bonny business!  I brought\n\nher to this place.  I gave her the name and the tenderness due to a\n\nsister.  All this has not gone without expense, but that I scarce\n\nneed to hint at.  They were services due to the young lady's\n\ncharacter which I respect; and I think it would be a bonny business\n\ntoo, if I was to be singing her praises to her father.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are a young man,\" he began.\n\n\n\n\"So I hear you tell me,\" said I, with a good deal of heat.\n\n\n\n\"You are a very young man,\" he repeated, \"or you would have\n\nunderstood the significancy of the step.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think you speak very much at your ease,\" cried I.  \"What else\n\nwas I to do?  It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor\n\nwoman to be a third to us, and I declare I never thought of it\n\nuntil this moment!  But where was I to find her, that am a\n\nforeigner myself?  And let me point out to your observation, Mr.\n\nDrummond, that it would have cost me money out of my pocket.  For\n\nhere is just what it comes to, that I had to pay through the nose\n\nfor your neglect; and there is only the one story to it, just that\n\nyou were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your\n\ndaughter.\"\n\n\n\n\"He that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones,\" says\n\nhe; \"and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss\n\nDrummond before we go on to sit in judgment on her father.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I will be entrapped into no such attitude,\" said I.  \"The\n\ncharacter of Miss Drummond is far above inquiry, as her father\n\nought to know.  So is mine, and I am telling you that.  There are\n\nbut the two ways of it open.  The one is to express your thanks to\n\nme as one gentleman to another, and to say no more.  The other (if\n\nyou are so difficult as to be still dissatisfied) is to pay me,\n\nthat which I have expended and be done.\"\n\n\n\nHe seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air.  \"There, there,\"\n\nsaid he.  \"You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour.  It is a\n\ngood thing that I have learned to be more patient.  And I believe\n\nyou forget that I have yet to see my daughter.\"\n\n\n\nI began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in\n\nthe man's manner that I spied in him as soon as the name of money\n\nfell between us.\n\n\n\n\"I was thinking it would be more fit--if you will excuse the\n\nplainness of my dressing in your presence--that I should go forth\n\nand leave you to encounter her alone?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"What I would have looked for at your hands!\" says he; and there\n\nwas no mistake but what he said it civilly.\n\n\n\nI thought this better and better still, and as I began to pull on\n\nmy hose, recalling the man's impudent mendicancy at\n\nPrestongrange's, I determined to pursue what seemed to be my\n\nvictory.\n\n\n\n\"If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,\" said I, \"this\n\nroom is very much at your disposal, and I can easy find another for\n\nmyself:  in which way we shall have the least amount of flitting\n\npossible, there being only one to change.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, sir,\" said he, making his bosom big, \"I think no shame of a\n\npoverty I have come by in the service of my king; I make no secret\n\nthat my affairs are quite involved; and for the moment, it would be\n\neven impossible for me to undertake a journey.\"\n\n\n\n\"Until you have occasion to communicate with your friends,\" said I,\n\n\"perhaps it might be convenient for you (as of course it would be\n\nhonourable to myself) if you were to regard yourself in the light\n\nof my guest?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"when an offer is frankly made, I think I honour\n\nmyself most to imitate that frankness.  Your hand, Mr. David; you\n\nhave the character that I respect the most; you are one of those\n\nfrom whom a gentleman can take a favour and no more words about it.\n\nI am an old soldier,\" he went on, looking rather disgusted-like\n\naround my chamber, \"and you need not fear I shall prove\n\nburthensome.  I have ate too often at a dyke-side, drank of the\n\nditch, and had no roof but the rain.\"\n\n\n\n\"I should be telling you,\" said I, \"that our breakfasts are sent\n\ncustomarily in about this time of morning.  I propose I should go\n\nnow to the tavern, and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay\n\nthe meal the matter of an hour, which will give you an interval to\n\nmeet your daughter in.\"\n\n\n\nMethought his nostrils wagged at this.  \"O, an hour\" says he.\n\n\"That is perhaps superfluous.  Half an hour, Mr. David, or say\n\ntwenty minutes; I shall do very well in that.  And by the way,\" he\n\nadds, detaining me by the coat, \"what is it you drink in the\n\nmorning, whether ale or wine?\"\n\n\n\n\"To be frank with you, sir,\" says I, \"I drink nothing else but\n\nspare, cold water.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tut-tut,\" says he, \"that is fair destruction to the stomach, take\n\nan old campaigner's word for it.  Our country spirit at home is\n\nperhaps the most entirely wholesome; but as that is not come-at-\n\nable, Rhenish or a white wine of Burgundy will be next best.\"\n\n\n\n\"I shall make it my business to see you are supplied,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Why, very good,\" said he, \"and we shall make a man of you yet, Mr.\n\nDavid.\"\n\n\n\nBy this time, I can hardly say that I was minding him at all,\n\nbeyond an odd thought of the kind of father-in-law that he was like\n\nto prove; and all my cares centred about the lass his daughter, to\n\nwhom I determined to convey some warning of her visitor.  I stepped\n\nto the door accordingly, and cried through the panels, knocking\n\nthereon at the same time:  \"Miss Drummond, here is your father come\n\nat last.\"\n\n\n\nWith that I went forth upon my errand, having (by two words)\n\nextraordinarily damaged my affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI--THE THREESOME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps\n\npitied, I must leave others to judge.  My shrewdness (of which I\n\nhave a good deal, too) seems not so great with the ladies.  No\n\ndoubt, at the moment when I awaked her, I was thinking a good deal\n\nof the effect upon James More; and similarly when I returned and we\n\nwere all sat down to breakfast, I continued to behave to the young\n\nlady with deference and distance; as I still think to have been\n\nmost wise.  Her father had cast doubts upon the innocence of my\n\nfriendship; and these, it was my first business to allay.  But\n\nthere is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also.  We had shared in a\n\nscene of some tenderness and passion, and given and received\n\ncaresses:  I had thrust her from me with violence; I had called\n\naloud upon her in the night from the one room to the other; she had\n\npassed hours of wakefulness and weeping; and it is not to be\n\nsupposed I had been absent from her pillow thoughts.  Upon the back\n\nof this, to be awaked, with unaccustomed formality, under the name\n\nof Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth used with a great deal of\n\ndistance and respect, led her entirely in error on my private\n\nsentiments; and she was indeed so incredibly abused as to imagine\n\nme repentant and trying to draw off!\n\n\n\nThe trouble betwixt us seems to have been this:  that whereas I\n\n(since I had first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly of\n\nJames More, his return and suspicions, she made so little of these\n\nthat I may say she scarce remarked them, and all her troubles and\n\ndoings regarded what had passed between us in the night before.\n\nThis is partly to be explained by the innocence and boldness of her\n\ncharacter; and partly because James More, having sped so ill in his\n\ninterview with me, or had his mouth closed by my invitation, said\n\nno word to her upon the subject.  At the breakfast, accordingly, it\n\nsoon appeared we were at cross purposes.  I had looked to find her\n\nin clothes of her own:  I found her (as if her father were\n\nforgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for her, and\n\nwhich she knew (or thought) that I admired her in.  I had looked to\n\nfind her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most precise\n\nand formal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes\n\nextraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression, calling\n\nme by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring and\n\ndeferring to my thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected\n\nwife.\n\n\n\nBut this was not for long.  As I behold her so regardless of her\n\nown interests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring to\n\nrecover, I redoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson to\n\nthe girl.  The more she came forward, the farther I drew back; the\n\nmore she betrayed the closeness of our intimacy, the more pointedly\n\ncivil I became, until even her father (if he had not been so\n\nengrossed with eating) might have observed the opposition.  In the\n\nmidst of which, of a sudden, she became wholly changed, and I told\n\nmyself, with a good deal of relief, that she had took the hint at\n\nlast.\n\n\n\nAll day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and\n\nthough the hour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands, I\n\ncannot say but I was happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the\n\ngirl again in proper keeping, the father satisfied or at least\n\nacquiescent, and myself free to prosecute my love with honour.  At\n\nsupper, as at all our meals, it was James More that did the\n\ntalking.  No doubt but he talked well if anyone could have believed\n\nhim.  But I will speak of him presently more at large.  The meal at\n\nan end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as I thought) at\n\nme, observed he had affairs abroad.  I took this for a hint that I\n\nwas to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who had\n\nscarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes upon me\n\nwide open with a look that bade me stay.  I stood between them like\n\na fish out of water, turning from one to the other; neither seemed\n\nto observe me, she gazing on the floor, he buttoning his coat:\n\nwhich vastly swelled my embarrassment.  This appearance of\n\nindifference argued, upon her side, a good deal of anger very near\n\nto burst out.  Upon his, I thought it horribly alarming; I made\n\nsure there was a tempest brewing there; and considering that to be\n\nthe chief peril, turned towards him and put myself (so to speak) in\n\nthe man's hands.\n\n\n\n\"Can I do anything for YOU, Mr. Drummond?\" says I.\n\n\n\nHe stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity.  \"Why,\n\nMr. David,\" said he, \"since you are so obliging as to propose it,\n\nyou might show me the way to a certain tavern\" (of which he gave\n\nthe name) \"where I hope to fall in with some old companions in\n\narms.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear him\n\ncompany.\n\n\n\n\"And as for you,\" say he to his daughter, \"you had best go to your\n\nbed.  I shall be late home, and EARLY TO BED AND EARLY TO RISE,\n\nGARS BONNY LASSES HAVE BRIGHT EYES.\"\n\n\n\nWhereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered\n\nme before him from the door.  This was so done (I thought on\n\npurpose) that it was scarce possible there should be any parting\n\nsalutation; but I observed she did not look at me, and set it down\n\nto terror of James More.\n\n\n\nIt was some distance to that tavern.  He talked all the way of\n\nmatters which did not interest me the smallest, and at the door\n\ndismissed me with empty manners.  Thence I walked to my new\n\nlodging, where I had not so much as a chimney to hold me warm, and\n\nno society but my own thoughts.  These were still bright enough; I\n\ndid not so much as dream that Catriona was turned against me; I\n\nthought we were like folk pledged; I thought we had been too near\n\nand spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by what were only\n\nsteps in a most needful policy.  And the chief of my concern was\n\nonly the kind of father-in-law that I was getting, which was not at\n\nall the kind I would have chosen:  and the matter of how soon I\n\nought to speak to him, which was a delicate point on several sides.\n\nIn the first place, when I thought how young I was I blushed all\n\nover, and could almost have found it in my heart to have desisted;\n\nonly that if once I let them go from Leyden without explanation, I\n\nmight lose her altogether.  And in the second place, there was our\n\nvery irregular situation to be kept in view, and the rather scant\n\nmeasure of satisfaction I had given James More that morning.  I\n\nconcluded, on the whole, that delay would not hurt anything, yet I\n\nwould not delay too long neither; and got to my cold bed with a\n\nfull heart.\n\n\n\nThe next day, as James More seemed a little on the complaining hand\n\nin the matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture;\n\nand coming in the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and\n\ntables, found the girl once more left to herself.  She greeted me\n\non my admission civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room, of\n\nwhich she shut the door.  I made my disposition, and paid and\n\ndismissed the men so that she might hear them go, when I supposed\n\nshe would at once come forth again to speak to me.  I waited yet\n\nawhile, then knocked upon her door.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona!\" said I.\n\n\n\nThe door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out,\n\nthat I thought she must have stood behind it listening.  She\n\nremained there in the interval quite still; but she had a look that\n\nI cannot put a name on, as of one in a bitter trouble.\n\n\n\n\"Are we not to have our walk to-day either?\" so I faltered.\n\n\n\n\"I am thanking you,\" said she.  \"I will not be caring much to walk,\n\nnow that my father is come home.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,\" said\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\"And do you think that was very kindly said?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"It was not unkindly meant,\" I replied.  \"What ails you, Catriona?\n\nWhat have I done to you that you should turn from me like this?\"\n\n\n\n\"I do not turn from you at all,\" she said, speaking very carefully.\n\n\"I will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will\n\never be his friend in all that I am able.  But now that my father\n\nJames More is come again, there is a difference to be made, and I\n\nthink there are some things said and done that would be better to\n\nbe forgotten.  But I will ever be your friend in all that I am\n\nable, and if that is not all that . . . . if it is not so much . .\n\n. . Not that you will be caring!  But I would not have you think of\n\nme too hard.  It was true what you said to me, that I was too young\n\nto be advised, and I am hoping you will remember I was just a\n\nchild.  I would not like to lose your friendship, at all events.\"\n\n\n\nShe began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood was in\n\nher face like scarlet, so that not her words only, but her face and\n\nthe trembling of her very hands, besought me to be gentle.  I saw,\n\nfor the first time, how very wrong I had done to place the child in\n\nthat position, where she had been entrapped into a moment's\n\nweakness, and now stood before me like a person shamed.\n\n\n\n\"Miss Drummond,\" I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning\n\nonce again, \"I wish you could see into my heart,\" I cried.  \"You\n\nwould read there that my respect is undiminished.  If that were\n\npossible, I should say it was increased.  This is but the result of\n\nthe mistake we made; and had to come; and the less said of it now\n\nthe better.  Of all of our life here, I promise you it shall never\n\npass my lips; I would like to promise you too that I would never\n\nthink of it, but it's a memory that will be always dear to me.  And\n\nas for a friend, you have one here that would die for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am thanking you,\" said she.\n\n\n\nWe stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get the\n\nupper hand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble, and\n\nmy love lost, and myself alone again in the world as at the\n\nbeginning.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"we shall be friends always, that's a certain\n\nthing.  But this is a kind of farewell, too:  it's a kind of a\n\nfarewell after all; I shall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a\n\nfarewell to my Catriona.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed to\n\ngrow great and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose I must\n\nhave lost my head, for I called out her name again and made a step\n\nat her with my hands reached forth.\n\n\n\nShe shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the\n\nblood sprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed back\n\nupon my own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern.  I\n\nfound no words to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep,\n\nand went my ways out of the house with death in my bosom.\n\n\n\nI think it was about five days that followed without any change.  I\n\nsaw her scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company\n\nof James More.  If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my\n\ndevoir to behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful\n\nattentions, having always in my mind's eye that picture of the girl\n\nshrinking and flaming in a blush, and in my heart more pity for her\n\nthan I could depict in words.  I was sorry enough for myself, I\n\nneed not dwell on that, having fallen all my length and more than\n\nall my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I was near as sorry\n\nfor the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with her save by\n\nfits and starts.  Her plea was good; she had been placed in an\n\nunfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more\n\nthan was to have been looked for.\n\n\n\nAnd for another thing she was now very much alone.  Her father,\n\nwhen he was by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very easy\n\nled away by his affairs and pleasures, neglected her without\n\ncompunction or remark, spent his nights in taverns when he had the\n\nmoney, which was more often than I could at all account for; and\n\neven in the course of these few days, failed once to come to a\n\nmeal, which Catriona and I were at last compelled to partake of\n\nwithout him.  It was the evening meal, and I left immediately that\n\nI had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be alone; to\n\nwhich she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I quite believed her.\n\nIndeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the girl, and a reminder\n\nof a moment's weakness that she now abhorred to think of.  So she\n\nmust sit alone in that room where she and I had been so merry, and\n\nin the blink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many\n\ndifficult and tender moments.  There she must sit alone, and think\n\nof herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly proffered her\n\naffections and had the same rejected.  And in the meanwhile I would\n\nbe alone some other place, and reading myself (whenever I was\n\ntempted to be angry) lessons upon human frailty and female\n\ndelicacy.  And altogether I suppose there were never two poor fools\n\nmade themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception.\n\n\n\nAs for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything in\n\nnature but his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk.\n\nBefore twelve hours were gone he had raised a small loan of me;\n\nbefore thirty, he had asked for a second and been refused.  Money\n\nand refusal he took with the same kind of high good nature.\n\nIndeed, he had an outside air of magnanimity that was very well\n\nfitted to impose upon a daughter; and the light in which he was\n\nconstantly presented in his talk, and the man's fine presence and\n\ngreat ways went together pretty harmoniously.  So that a man that\n\nhad no business with him, and either very little penetration or a\n\nfurious deal of prejudice, might almost have been taken in.  To me,\n\nafter my first two interviews, he was as plain as print; I saw him\n\nto be perfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in the same; and\n\nI would hearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and \"an old\n\nsoldier,\" and \"a poor Highland gentleman,\" and \"the strength of my\n\ncountry and my friends\") as I might to the babbling of a parrot.\n\n\n\nThe odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself,\n\nor did at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce\n\nknew when he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection\n\nmust have been wholly genuine.  There were times when he would be\n\nthe most silent, affectionate, clinging creature possible, holding\n\nCatriona's hand like a big baby, and begging of me not to leave if\n\nI had any love to him; of which, indeed, I had none, but all the\n\nmore to his daughter.  He would press and indeed beseech us to\n\nentertain him with our talk, a thing very difficult in the state of\n\nour relations; and again break forth in pitiable regrets for his\n\nown land and friends, or into Gaelic singing.\n\n\n\n\"This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,\" he would\n\nsay.  \"You may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed\n\nit is to make a near friend of you,\" says he.  \"But the notes of\n\nthis singing are in my blood, and the words come out of my heart.\n\nAnd when I mind upon my red mountains and the wild birds calling\n\nthere, and the brave streams of water running down, I would scarce\n\nthink shame to weep before my enemies.\"  Then he would sing again,\n\nand translate to me pieces of the song, with a great deal of\n\nboggling and much expressed contempt against the English language.\n\n\"It says here,\" he would say, \"that the sun is gone down, and the\n\nbattle is at an end, and the brave chiefs are defeated.  And it\n\ntells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange countries or\n\nlying dead on the red mountain; and they will never more shout the\n\ncall of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley.\n\nBut if you had only some of this language, you would weep also\n\nbecause the words of it are beyond all expression, and it is mere\n\nmockery to tell you it in English.\"\n\n\n\nWell, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business,\n\none way and another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for which\n\nI hated him, I think, the worst of all.  And it used to cut me to\n\nthe quick to see Catriona so much concerned for the old rogue, and\n\nweeping herself to see him weep, when I was sure one half of his\n\ndistress flowed from his last night's drinking in some tavern.\n\nThere were times when I was tempted to lend him a round sum, and\n\nsee the last of him for good; but this would have been to see the\n\nlast of Catriona as well, for which I was scarcely so prepared; and\n\nbesides, it went against my conscience to squander my good money on\n\none who was so little of a husband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII--A TWOSOME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that\n\nJames was in one of his fits of gloom, when I received three\n\nletters.  The first was from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden;\n\nthe other two were out of Scotland and prompted by the same affair,\n\nwhich was the death of my uncle and my own complete accession to my\n\nrights.  Rankeillor's was, of course, wholly in the business view;\n\nMiss Grant's was like herself, a little more witty than wise, full\n\nof blame to me for not having written (though how was I to write\n\nwith such intelligence?) and of rallying talk about Catriona, which\n\nit cut me to the quick to read in her very presence.\n\n\n\nFor it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when I came\n\nto dinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first\n\nmoment of reading it.  This made a welcome diversion for all three\n\nof us, nor could any have foreseen the ill consequences that\n\nensued.  It was accident that brought the three letters the same\n\nday, and that gave them into my hand in the same room with James\n\nMore; and of all the events that flowed from that accident, and\n\nwhich I might have prevented if I had held my tongue, the truth is\n\nthat they were preordained before Agricola came into Scotland or\n\nAbraham set out upon his travels.\n\n\n\nThe first that I opened was naturally Alan's; and what more natural\n\nthan that I should comment on his design to visit me? but I\n\nobserved James to sit up with an air of immediate attention.\n\n\n\n\"Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident?\"\n\nhe inquired.\n\n\n\nI told him, \"Ay,\" it was the same; and he withheld me some time\n\nfrom my other letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan's manner\n\nof life in France, of which I knew very little, and further of his\n\nvisit as now proposed.\n\n\n\n\"All we forfeited folk hang a little together,\" he explained, \"and\n\nbesides I know the gentleman:  and though his descent is not the\n\nthing, and indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart,\n\nhe was very much admired in the day of Drummossie.  He did there\n\nlike a soldier; if some that need not be named had done as well,\n\nthe upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember.  There\n\nwere two that did their best that day, and it makes a bond between\n\nthe pair of us,\" says he.\n\n\n\nI could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him, and\n\ncould almost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired\n\na little further into that mention of his birth.  Though, they tell\n\nme, the same was indeed not wholly regular.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant's, and could not withhold an\n\nexclamation.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father\n\nwas arrived, to address her by a handle, \"I am come into my kingdom\n\nfairly, I am the laird of Shaws indeed--my uncle is dead at last.\"\n\n\n\nShe clapped her hands together leaping from her seat.  The next\n\nmoment it must have come over both of us at once what little cause\n\nof joy was left to either, and we stood opposite, staring on each\n\nother sadly.\n\n\n\nBut James showed himself a ready hypocrite.  \"My daughter,\" says\n\nhe, \"is this how my cousin learned you to behave?  Mr. David has\n\nlost a new friend, and we should first condole with him on his\n\nbereavement.\"\n\n\n\n\"Troth, sir,\" said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, \"I can\n\nmake no such great faces.  His death is as blithe news as ever I\n\ngot.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a good soldier's philosophy,\" says James.  \"'Tis the way of\n\nflesh, we must all go, all go.  And if the gentleman was so far\n\nfrom your favour, why, very well!  But we may at least congratulate\n\nyou on your accession to your estates.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nor can I say that either,\" I replied, with the same heat.  \"It is\n\na good estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough\n\nalready?  I had a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for\n\nthe man's death--which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess\n\nit!--I see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come, come,\" said he, \"you are more affected than you let on, or\n\nyou would never make yourself out so lonely.  Here are three\n\nletters; that means three that wish you well; and I could name two\n\nmore, here in this very chamber.  I have known you not so very\n\nlong, but Catriona, when we are alone, is never done with the\n\nsinging of your praises.\"\n\n\n\nShe looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off at\n\nonce into another matter, the extent of my estate, which (during\n\nthe most of the dinner time) he continued to dwell upon with\n\ninterest.  But it was to no purpose he dissembled; he had touched\n\nthe matter with too gross a hand:  and I knew what to expect.\n\nDinner was scarce ate when he plainly discovered his designs.  He\n\nreminded Catriona of an errand, and bid her attend to it.  \"I do\n\nnot see you should be one beyond the hour,\" he added, \"and friend\n\nDavid will be good enough to bear me company till you return.\"  She\n\nmade haste to obey him without words.  I do not know if she\n\nunderstood, I believe not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat\n\nstrengthening my mind for what should follow.\n\n\n\nThe door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man\n\nleaned back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation\n\nof easiness.  Only the one thing betrayed him, and that was his\n\nface; which suddenly shone all over with fine points of sweat.\n\n\n\n\"I am rather glad to have a word alone with you,\" says he, \"because\n\nin our first interview there were some expressions you\n\nmisapprehended and I have long meant to set you right upon.  My\n\ndaughter stands beyond doubt.  So do you, and I would make that\n\ngood with my sword against all gainsayers.  But, my dear David,\n\nthis world is a censorious place--as who should know it better than\n\nmyself, who have lived ever since the days of my late departed\n\nfather, God sain him! in a perfect spate of calumnies?  We have to\n\nface to that; you and me have to consider of that; we have to\n\nconsider of that.\"  And he wagged his head like a minister in a\n\npulpit.\n\n\n\n\"To what effect, Mr. Drummond?\" said I.  \"I would be obliged to you\n\nif you would approach your point.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said he, laughing, \"like your character, indeed! and what\n\nI most admire in it.  But the point, my worthy fellow, is sometimes\n\nin a kittle bit.\"  He filled a glass of wine.  \"Though between you\n\nand me, that are such fast friends, it need not bother us long.\n\nThe point, I need scarcely tell you, is my daughter.  And the first\n\nthing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming you.  In the\n\nunfortunate circumstances, what could you do else?  'Deed, and I\n\ncannot tell.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thank you for that,\" said I, pretty close upon my guard.\n\n\n\n\"I have besides studied your character,\" he went on; \"your talents\n\nare fair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no\n\nharm; and one thing with another, I am very happy to have to\n\nannounce to you that I have decided on the latter of the two ways\n\nopen.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am afraid I am dull,\" said I.  \"What ways are these?\"\n\n\n\nHe bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs.  \"Why,\n\nsir,\" says he, \"I think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman\n\nof your condition; either that I should cut your throat or that you\n\nshould marry my daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are pleased to be quite plain at last,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!\" cries he\n\nrobustiously.  \"I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank\n\nGod, a patient and deleeborate man.  There is many a father, sir,\n\nthat would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the\n\nfield.  My esteem for your character--\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Drummond,\" I interrupted, \"if you have any esteem for me at\n\nall, I will beg of you to moderate your voice.  It is quite\n\nneedless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself\n\nand lending you his best attention.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, very true,\" says he, with an immediate change.  \"And you must\n\nexcuse the agitations of a parent.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand you then,\" I continued--\"for I will take no note of\n\nyour other alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let fall--I\n\nunderstand you rather to offer me encouragement in case I should\n\ndesire to apply for your daughter's hand?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is not possible to express my meaning better,\" said he, \"and I\n\nsee we shall do well together.\"\n\n\n\n\"That remains to be yet seen,\" said I.  \"But so much I need make no\n\nsecret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender\n\naffection, and I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune\n\nthan to get her.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,\" he cried, and\n\nreached out his hand to me.\n\n\n\nI put it by.  \"You go too fast, Mr. Drummond,\" said I.  \"There are\n\nconditions to be made; and there is a difficulty in the path, which\n\nI see not entirely how we shall come over.  I have told you that,\n\nupon my side, there is no objection to the marriage, but I have\n\ngood reason to believe there will be much on the young lady's.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is all beside the mark,\" says he.  \"I will engage for her\n\nacceptance.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think you forget, Mr. Drummond,\" said I, \"that, even in dealing\n\nwith myself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable\n\nexpressions.  I will have none such employed to the young lady.  I\n\nam here to speak and think for the two of us; and I give you to\n\nunderstand that I would no more let a wife be forced upon myself,\n\nthan what I would let a husband be forced on the young lady.\"\n\n\n\nHe sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of\n\ntemper.\n\n\n\n\"So that is to be the way of it,\" I concluded.  \"I will marry Miss\n\nDrummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing.  But if\n\nthere be the least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear--marry\n\nher will I never.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well well,\" said he, \"this is a small affair.  As soon as she\n\nreturns I will sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you--\"\n\n\n\nBut I cut in again.  \"Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I cry\n\noff, and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else,\"\n\nsaid I.  \"It is I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge.\n\nI shall satisfy myself exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle-\n\n-you the least of all.\"\n\n\n\n\"Upon my word, sir!\" he exclaimed, \"and who are you to be the\n\njudge?\"\n\n\n\n\"The bridegroom, I believe,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"This is to quibble,\" he cried.  \"You turn your back upon the fact.\n\nThe girl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise.  Her\n\ncharacter is gone.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I ask your pardon,\" said I, \"but while this matter lies\n\nbetween her and you and me, that is not so.\"\n\n\n\n\"What security have I!\" he cried.  \"Am I to let my daughter's\n\nreputation depend upon a chance?\"\n\n\n\n\"You should have thought of all this long ago,\" said I, \"before you\n\nwere so misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when it is\n\nquite too late.  I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable\n\nfor your neglect, and I will be browbeat by no man living.  My mind\n\nis quite made up, and come what may, I will not depart from it a\n\nhair's breadth.  You and me are to sit here in company till her\n\nreturn:  upon which, without either word or look from you, she and\n\nI are to go forth again to hold our talk.  If she can satisfy me\n\nthat she is willing to this step, I will then make it; and if she\n\ncannot, I will not.\"\n\n\n\nHe leaped out of his chair like a man stung.  \"I can spy your\n\nmanoeuvre,\" he cried; \"you would work upon her to refuse!\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe ay, and maybe no,\" said I.  \"That is the way it is to be,\n\nwhatever.\"\n\n\n\n\"And if I refuse?\" cries he.\n\n\n\n\"Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,\"\n\nsaid I.\n\n\n\nWhat with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which he\n\ncame near rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons, I\n\ndid not use this word without trepidation, to say nothing at all of\n\nthe circumstance that he was Catriona's father.  But I might have\n\nspared myself alarms.  From the poorness of my lodging--he does not\n\nseem to have remarked his daughter's dresses, which were indeed all\n\nequally new to him--and from the fact that I had shown myself\n\naverse to lend, he had embraced a strong idea of my poverty.  The\n\nsudden news of my estate convinced him of his error, and he had\n\nmade but the one bound of it on this fresh venture, to which he was\n\nnow so wedded, that I believe he would have suffered anything\n\nrather than fall to the alternative of fighting.\n\n\n\nA little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until I hit\n\nupon a word that silenced him.\n\n\n\n\"If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,\" said\n\nI, \"I must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the\n\nright about her unwillingness.\"\n\n\n\nHe gabbled some kind of an excuse.\n\n\n\n\"But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,\" I added,\n\n\"and I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence.\"\n\n\n\nThe which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose would\n\nhave cut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view\n\nus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII--IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI opened the door to Catriona and stopped her on the threshold.\n\n\n\n\"Your father wishes us to take our walk,\" said I.\n\n\n\nShe looked to James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained\n\nsoldier, she turned to go with me.\n\n\n\nWe took one of our old ways, where we had gone often together, and\n\nbeen more happy than I can tell of in the past.  I came a half a\n\nstep behind, so that I could watch her unobserved.  The knocking of\n\nher little shoes upon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad;\n\nand I thought it a strange moment that I should be so near both\n\nends of it at once, and walk in the midst between two destinies,\n\nand could not tell whether I was hearing these steps for the last\n\ntime, or whether the sound of them was to go in and out with me\n\ntill death should part us.\n\n\n\nShe avoided even to look at me, only walked before her, like one\n\nwho had a guess of what was coming.  I saw I must speak soon before\n\nmy courage was run out, but where to begin I knew not.  In this\n\npainful situation, when the girl was as good as forced into my arms\n\nand had already besought my forbearance, any excess of pressure\n\nmust have seemed indecent; yet to avoid it wholly would have a very\n\ncold-like appearance.  Between these extremes I stood helpless, and\n\ncould have bit my fingers; so that, when at last I managed to speak\n\nat all, it may be said I spoke at random.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said I, \"I am in a very painful situation; or rather,\n\nso we are both; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you\n\nwould promise to let me speak through first of all, and not to\n\ninterrupt me till I have done.\"\n\n\n\nShe promised me that simply.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"this that I have got to say is very difficult, and\n\nI know very well I have no right to be saying it.  After what\n\npassed between the two of us last Friday, I have no manner of\n\nright.  We have got so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I\n\nknow very well the least I could do is just to hold my tongue,\n\nwhich was what I intended fully, and there was nothing further from\n\nmy thoughts than to have troubled you again.  But, my dear, it has\n\nbecome merely necessary, and no way by it.  You see, this estate of\n\nmine has fallen in, which makes of me rather a better match; and\n\nthe--the business would not have quite the same ridiculous-like\n\nappearance that it would before.  Besides which, it's supposed that\n\nour affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying) that it\n\nwould be better to let them be the way they are.  In my view, this\n\npart of the thing is vastly exagerate, and if I were you I would\n\nnot wear two thoughts on it.  Only it's right I should mention the\n\nsame, because there's no doubt it has some influence on James More.\n\nThen I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this\n\ntown before.  I think we did pretty well together.  If you would\n\nlook back, my dear--\"\n\n\n\n\"I will look neither back nor forward,\" she interrupted.  \"Tell me\n\nthe one thing:  this is my father's doing?\"\n\n\n\n\"He approves of it,\" said I.  \"He approved I that I should ask your\n\nhand in marriage,\" and was going on again with somewhat more of an\n\nappeal upon her feelings; but she marked me not, and struck into\n\nthe midst.\n\n\n\n\"He told you to!\" she cried.  \"It is no sense denying it, you said\n\nyourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts.  He\n\ntold you to.\"\n\n\n\n\"He spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,\" I began.\n\n\n\nShe was walking ever the faster, and looking fain in front of her;\n\nbut at this she made a little noise in her head, and I thought she\n\nwould have run.\n\n\n\n\"Without which,\" I went on, \"after what you said last Friday, I\n\nwould never have been so troublesome as make the offer.  But when\n\nhe as good as asked me, what was I to do?\"\n\n\n\nShe stopped and turned round upon me.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it is refused at all events,\" she cried, \"and there will be\n\nan end of that.\"\n\n\n\nAnd she began again to walk forward.\n\n\n\n\"I suppose I could expect no better,\" said I, \"but I think you\n\nmight try to be a little kind to me for the last end of it.  I see\n\nnot why you should be harsh.  I have loved you very well, Catriona-\n\n-no harm that I should call you so for the last time.  I have done\n\nthe best that I could manage, I am trying the same still, and only\n\nvexed that I can do no better.  It is a strange thing to me that\n\nyou can take any pleasure to be hard to me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not thinking of you,\" she said, \"I am thinking of that man,\n\nmy father.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and that way, too!\" said I.  \"I can be of use to you that\n\nway, too; I will have to be.  It is very needful, my dear, that we\n\nshould consult about your father; for the way this talk has gone,\n\nan angry man will be James More.\"\n\n\n\nShe stopped again.  \"It is because I am disgraced?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"That is what he is thinking,\" I replied, \"but I have told you\n\nalready to make nought of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will be all one to me,\" she cried.  \"I prefer to be disgraced!\"\n\n\n\nI did not know very well what to answer, and stood silent.\n\n\n\nThere seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last\n\ncry; presently she broke out, \"And what is the meaning of all this?\n\nWhy is all this shame loundered on my head?  How could you dare it,\n\nDavid Balfour?\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"what else was I to do?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not your dear,\" she said, \"and I defy you to be calling me\n\nthese words.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not thinking of my words,\" said I.  \"My heart bleeds for you,\n\nMiss Drummond.  Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in\n\nyour difficult position.  But there is just the one thing that I\n\nwish you would bear in view, if it was only long enough to discuss\n\nit quietly; for there is going to be a collieshangie when we two\n\nget home.  Take my word for it, it will need the two of us to make\n\nthis matter end in peace.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay,\" said she.  There sprang a patch of red in either of her\n\ncheeks.  \"Was he for fighting you?\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"Well, he was that,\" said I.\n\n\n\nShe gave a dreadful kind of laugh.  \"At all events, it is\n\ncomplete!\" she cried.  And then turning on me.  \"My father and I\n\nare a fine pair,\" said she, \"but I am thanking the good God there\n\nwill be somebody worse than what we are.  I am thanking the good\n\nGod that he has let me see you so.  There will never be the girl\n\nmade that will not scorn you.\"\n\n\n\nI had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was over the\n\nmark.\n\n\n\n\"You have no right to speak to me like that,\" said I.  \"What have I\n\ndone but to be good to you, or try to be?  And here is my\n\nrepayment!  O, it is too much.\"\n\n\n\nShe kept looking at me with a hateful smile.  \"Coward!\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"The word in your throat and in your father's!\" I cried.  \"I have\n\ndared him this day already in your interest.  I will dare him\n\nagain, the nasty pole-cat; little I care which of us should fall!\n\nCome,\" said I, \"back to the house with us; let us be done with it,\n\nlet me be done with the whole Hieland crew of you!  You will see\n\nwhat you think when I am dead.\"\n\n\n\nShe shook her head at me with that same smile I could have struck\n\nher for.\n\n\n\n\"O, smile away!\" I cried.  \"I have seen your bonny father smile on\n\nthe wrong side this day.  Not that I mean he was afraid, of\n\ncourse,\" I added hastily, \"but he preferred the other way of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is this?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"When I offered to draw with him,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"You offered to draw upon James More!\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"And I did so,\" said I, \"and found him backward enough, or how\n\nwould we be here?\"\n\n\n\n\"There is a meaning upon this,\" said she.  \"What is it you are\n\nmeaning?\"\n\n\n\n\"He was to make you take me,\" I replied, \"and I would not have it.\n\nI said you should be free, and I must speak with you alone; little\n\nI supposed it would be such a speaking!  'AND WHAT IF I REFUSE?'\n\nsaid he.--'THEN IT MUST COME TO THE THROAT-CUTTING,' says I, 'FOR I\n\nWILL NO MORE HAVE A HUSBAND FORCED ON THAT YOUNG LADY, THAN WHAT I\n\nWOULD HAVE A WIFE FORCED UPON MYSELF.'  These were my words, they\n\nwere a friend's words; bonnily have I paid for them!  Now you have\n\nrefused me of your own clear free will, and there lives no father\n\nin the Highlands, or out of them, that can force on this marriage.\n\nI will see that your wishes are respected; I will make the same my\n\nbusiness, as I have all through.  But I think you might have that\n\ndecency as to affect some gratitude.  'Deed, and I thought you knew\n\nme better!  I have not behaved quite well to you, but that was\n\nweakness.  And to think me a coward, and such a coward as that--O,\n\nmy lass, there was a stab for the last of it!\"\n\n\n\n\"Davie, how would I guess?\" she cried.  \"O, this is a dreadful\n\nbusiness!  Me and mine,\"--she gave a kind of a wretched cry at the\n\nword--\"me and mine are not fit to speak to you.  O, I could be\n\nkneeling down to you in the street, I could be kissing your hands\n\nfor forgiveness!\"\n\n\n\n\"I will keep the kisses I have got from you already,\" cried I.  \"I\n\nwill keep the ones I wanted and that were something worth; I will\n\nnot be kissed in penitence.\"\n\n\n\n\"What can you be thinking of this miserable girl?\" says she.\n\n\n\n\"What I am trying to tell you all this while!\" said I, \"that you\n\nhad best leave me alone, whom you can make no more unhappy if you\n\ntried, and turn your attention to James More, your father, with\n\nwhom you are like to have a queer pirn to wind.\"\n\n\n\n\"O, that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man!\"\n\nshe cried, and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort.\n\n\"But trouble yourself no more for that,\" said she.  \"He does not\n\nknow what kind of nature is in my heart.  He will pay me dear for\n\nthis day of it; dear, dear, will he pay.\"\n\n\n\nShe turned, and began to go home and I to accompany her.  At which\n\nshe stopped.\n\n\n\n\"I will be going alone,\" she said.  \"It is alone I must be seeing\n\nhim.\"\n\n\n\nSome little time I raged about the streets, and told myself I was\n\nthe worst used lad in Christendom.  Anger choked me; it was all\n\nvery well for me to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air\n\nenough about Leyden to supply me, and I thought I would have burst\n\nlike a man at the bottom of the sea.  I stopped and laughed at\n\nmyself at a street corner a minute together, laughing out loud, so\n\nthat a passenger looked at me, which brought me to myself.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" I thought, \"I have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy\n\nlong enough.  Time it was done.  Here is a good lesson to have\n\nnothing to do with that accursed sex, that was the ruin of the man\n\nin the beginning and will be so to the end.  God knows I was happy\n\nenough before ever I saw her; God knows I can be happy enough again\n\nwhen I have seen the last of her.\"\n\n\n\nThat seemed to me the chief affair:  to see them go.  I dwelled\n\nupon the idea fiercely; and presently slipped on, in a kind of\n\nmalevolence, to consider how very poorly they were likely to fare\n\nwhen Davie Balfour was no longer by to be their milk-cow; at which,\n\nto my very own great surprise, the disposition of my mind turned\n\nbottom up.  I was still angry; I still hated her; and yet I thought\n\nI owed it to myself that she should suffer nothing.\n\n\n\nThis carried me home again at once, where I found the mails drawn\n\nout and ready fastened by the door, and the father and daughter\n\nwith every mark upon them of a recent disagreement.  Catriona was\n\nlike a wooden doll; James More breathed hard, his face was dotted\n\nwith white spots, and his nose upon one side.  As soon as I came\n\nin, the girl looked at him with a steady, clear, dark look that\n\nmight have been followed by a blow.  It was a hint that was more\n\ncontemptuous than a command, and I was surprised to see James More\n\naccept it.  It was plain he had had a master talking-to; and I\n\ncould see there must be more of the devil in the girl than I had\n\nguessed, and more good humour about the man than I had given him\n\nthe credit of.\n\n\n\nHe began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly speaking\n\nfrom a lesson; but he got not very far, for at the first pompous\n\nswell of his voice, Catriona cut in.\n\n\n\n\"I will tell you what James More is meaning,\" said she.  \"He means\n\nwe have come to you, beggar-folk, and have not behaved to you very\n\nwell, and we are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill-behaviour.  Now\n\nwe are wanting to go away and be forgotten; and my father will have\n\nguided his gear so ill, that we cannot even do that unless you will\n\ngive us some more alms.  For that is what we are, at an events,\n\nbeggar-folk and sorners.\"\n\n\n\n\"By your leave, Miss Drummond,\" said I, \"I must speak to your\n\nfather by myself.\"\n\n\n\nShe went into her own room and shut the door, without a word or a\n\nlook.\n\n\n\n\"You must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,\" says James More.  \"She has no\n\ndelicacy.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not here to discuss that with you,\" said I, \"but to be quit\n\nof you.  And to that end I must talk of your position.  Now, Mr.\n\nDrummond, I have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you\n\nbargained for.  I know you had money of your own when you were\n\nborrowing mine.  I know you have had more since you were here in\n\nLeyden, though you concealed it even from your daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\"I bid you beware.  I will stand no more baiting,\" he broke out.\n\n\"I am sick of her and you.  What kind of a damned trade is this to\n\nbe a parent!  I have had expressions used to me--\"  There he broke\n\noff.  \"Sir, this is the heart of a soldier and a parent,\" he went\n\non again, laying his hand on his bosom, \"outraged in both\n\ncharacters--and I bid you beware.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you would have let me finish,\" says I, \"you would have found I\n\nspoke for your advantage.\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear friend,\" he cried, \"I know I might have relied upon the\n\ngenerosity of your character.\"\n\n\n\n\"Man! will you let me speak?\" said I.  \"The fact is that I cannot\n\nwin to find out if you are rich or poor.  But it is my idea that\n\nyour means, as they are mysterious in their source, so they are\n\nsomething insufficient in amount; and I do not choose your daughter\n\nto be lacking.  If I durst speak to herself, you may be certain I\n\nwould never dream of trusting it to you; because I know you like\n\nthe back of my hand, and all your blustering talk is that much wind\n\nto me.  However, I believe in your way you do still care something\n\nfor your daughter after all; and I must just be doing with that\n\nground of confidence, such as it is.\"\n\n\n\nWhereupon, I arranged with him that he was to communicate with me,\n\nas to his whereabouts and Catriona's welfare, in consideration of\n\nwhich I was to serve him a small stipend.\n\n\n\nHe heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness; and when\n\nit was done, \"My dear fellow, my dear son,\" he cried out, \"this is\n\nmore like yourself than any of it yet!  I will serve you with a\n\nsoldier's faithfulness--\"\n\n\n\n\"Let me hear no more of it!\" says I.  \"You have got me to that\n\npitch that the bare name of soldier rises on my stomach.  Our\n\ntraffic is settled; I am now going forth and will return in one\n\nhalf-hour, when I expect to find my chambers purged of you.\"\n\n\n\nI gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear that I might\n\nsee Catriona again, because tears and weakness were ready in my\n\nheart, and I cherished my anger like a piece of dignity.  Perhaps\n\nan hour went by; the sun had gone down, a little wisp of a new moon\n\nwas following it across a scarlet sunset; already there were stars\n\nin the east, and in my chambers, when at last I entered them, the\n\nnight lay blue.  I lit a taper and reviewed the rooms; in the first\n\nthere remained nothing so much as to awake a memory of those who\n\nwere gone; but in the second, in a corner of the floor, I spied a\n\nlittle heap that brought my heart into my mouth.  She had left\n\nbehind at her departure all that she had ever had of me.  It was\n\nthe blow that I felt sorest, perhaps because it was the last; and I\n\nfell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more foolish\n\nthan I care to tell of.\n\n\n\nLate in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering, I\n\ncame again by some portion of my manhood and considered with\n\nmyself.  The sight of these poor frocks and ribbons, and her\n\nshifts, and the clocked stockings, was not to be endured; and if I\n\nwere to recover any constancy of mind, I saw I must be rid of them\n\nere the morning.  It was my first thought to have made a fire and\n\nburned them; but my disposition has always been opposed to wastery,\n\nfor one thing; and for another, to have burned these things that\n\nshe had worn so close upon her body seemed in the nature of a\n\ncruelty.  There was a corner cupboard in that chamber; there I\n\ndetermined to bestow them.  The which I did and made it a long\n\nbusiness, folding them with very little skill indeed but the more\n\ncare; and sometimes dropping them with my tears.  All the heart was\n\ngone out of me, I was weary as though I had run miles, and sore\n\nlike one beaten; when, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore\n\noften at her neck, I observed there was a corner neatly cut from\n\nit.  It was a kerchief of a very pretty hue, on which I had\n\nfrequently remarked; and once that she had it on, I remembered\n\ntelling her (by way of a banter) that she wore my colours.  There\n\ncame a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness in my bosom; and\n\nthe next moment I was plunged back in a fresh despair.  For there\n\nwas the corner crumpled in a knot and cast down by itself in\n\nanother part of the floor.\n\n\n\nBut when I argued with myself, I grew more hopeful.  She had cut\n\nthat corner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender;\n\nthat she had cast it away again was little to be wondered at; and I\n\nwas inclined to dwell more upon the first than upon the second, and\n\nto be more pleased that she had ever conceived the idea of that\n\nkeepsake, than concerned because she had flung it from her in an\n\nhour of natural resentment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX--WE MEET IN DUNKIRK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltogether, then, I was scare so miserable the next days but what I\n\nhad many hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with a good deal\n\nof constancy upon my studies; and made out to endure the time till\n\nAlan should arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona by the means\n\nof James More.  I had altogether three letters in the time of our\n\nseparation.  One was to announce their arrival in the town of\n\nDunkirk in France, from which place James shortly after started\n\nalone upon a private mission.  This was to England and to see Lord\n\nHolderness; and it has always been a bitter thought that my good\n\nmoney helped to pay the charges of the same.  But he has need of a\n\nlong spoon who soups with the de'il, or James More either.  During\n\nthis absence, the time was to fall due for another letter; and as\n\nthe letter was the condition of his stipend, he had been so careful\n\nas to prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be\n\ndespatched.  The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions,\n\nand he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal.  What I\n\nreceived began accordingly in the writing of James More:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My dear Sir,--Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have\n\nto acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement.  It shall be\n\nall faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires to\n\nbe remembered to her dear friend.  I find her in rather a\n\nmelancholy disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her\n\nre-established.  Our manner of life is very much alone, but we\n\nsolace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains,\n\nand by walking up the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland.\n\nIt was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body\n\non the field of Gladsmuir.  I have found employment here in the\n\nharas of a French nobleman, where my experience is valued.  But, my\n\ndear Sir, the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be\n\nashamed to mention them, which makes your remittances the more\n\nnecessary to my daughter's comfort, though I daresay the sight of\n\nold friends would be still better.\n\n\n\n\"My dear Sir,\n\n\"Your affectionate, obedient servant,\n\n\"JAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow it began again in the hand of Catriona:-\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do not be believing him, it is all lies together,--C. M. D.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have\n\ncome near suppressing the letter; for it came long after date, and\n\nwas closely followed by the third.  In the time betwixt them, Alan\n\nhad arrived, and made another life to me with his merry\n\nconversation; I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots-\n\nDutch, a man that drank more than I could have thought possible and\n\nwas not otherwise of interest; I had been entertained to many\n\njovial dinners and given some myself, all with no great change upon\n\nmy sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself, and not at\n\nall the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my\n\nrelations with James More and his daughter.  I was naturally\n\ndiffident to give particulars; and this disposition was not anyway\n\nlessened by the nature of Alan's commentary upon those I gave.\n\n\n\n\"I cannae make heed nor tail of it,\" he would say, \"but it sticks\n\nin my mind ye've made a gowk of yourself.  There's few people that\n\nhas had more experience than Alan Breck:  and I can never call to\n\nmind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours.  The\n\nway that you tell it, the thing's fair impossible.  Ye must have\n\nmade a terrible hash of the business, David.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are whiles that I am of the same mind,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her\n\ntoo!\" said Alan.\n\n\n\n\"The biggest kind, Alan,\" said I, \"and I think I'll take it to my\n\ngrave with me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, ye beat me, whatever!\" he would conclude.\n\n\n\nI showed him the letter with Catriona's postscript.  \"And here\n\nagain!\" he cried.  \"Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this\n\nCatriona, and sense forby!  As for James More, the man's as boss as\n\na drum; he's just a wame and a wheen words; though I'll can never\n\ndeny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir, and it's true\n\nwhat he says here about the five wounds.  But the loss of him is\n\nthat the man's boss.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye see, Alan,\" said I, \"it goes against the grain with me to leave\n\nthe maid in such poor hands.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye couldnae weel find poorer,\" he admitted.  \"But what are ye to\n\ndo with it?  It's this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie:\n\nThe weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them.  Either they\n\nlike the man, and then a' goes fine; or else they just detest him,\n\nand ye may spare your breath--ye can do naething.  There's just the\n\ntwo sets of them--them that would sell their coats for ye, and them\n\nthat never look the road ye're on.  That's a' that there is to\n\nwomen; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the\n\ntane frae the tither.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I'm afraid that's true for me,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"And yet there's naething easier!\" cried Alan.  \"I could easy learn\n\nye the science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born blind,\n\nand there's where the deefficulty comes in.\"\n\n\n\n\"And can YOU no help me?\" I asked, \"you that are so clever at the\n\ntrade?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ye see, David, I wasnae here,\" said he.  \"I'm like a field officer\n\nthat has naebody but blind men for scouts and eclaireurs; and what\n\nwould he ken?  But it sticks in my mind that ye'll have made some\n\nkind of bauchle; and if I was you I would have a try at her again.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would ye so, man Alan?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I would e'en't,\" says he.\n\n\n\nThe third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such\n\ntalk:  and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion.  James\n\nprofessed to be in some concern upon his daughter's health, which I\n\nbelieve was never better; abounded in kind expressions to myself;\n\nand finally proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk.\n\n\n\n\"You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr.\n\nStewart,\" he wrote.  \"Why not accompany him so far in his return to\n\nFrance?  I have something very particular for Mr. Stewart's ear;\n\nand, at any rate, I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-\n\nsoldier and one so mettle as himself.  As for you, my dear sir, my\n\ndaughter and I would be proud to receive our benefactor, whom we\n\nregard as a brother and a son.  The French nobleman has proved a\n\nperson of the most filthy avarice of character, and I have been\n\nnecessitate to leave the haras.  You will find us in consequence a\n\nlittle poorly lodged in the auberge of a man Bazin on the dunes;\n\nbut the situation is caller, and I make no doubt but we might spend\n\nsome very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I could recall our\n\nservices, and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner\n\nmore befitting your age.  I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would\n\ncome here; my business with him opens a very wide door.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does the man want with me?\" cried Alan, when he had read.\n\n\"What he wants with you in clear enough--it's siller.  But what can\n\nhe want with Alan Breck?\"\n\n\n\n\"O, it'll be just an excuse,\" said I.  \"He is still after this\n\nmarriage, which I wish from my heart that we could bring about.\n\nAnd he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come\n\nwanting you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I wish that I kent,\" says Alan.  \"Him and me were never\n\nonyways pack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers.\n\n'Something for my ear,' quo' he!  I'll maybe have something for his\n\nhinder-end, before we're through with it.  Dod, I'm thinking it\n\nwould be a kind of divertisement to gang and see what he'll be\n\nafter!  Forby that I could see your lassie then.  What say ye,\n\nDavie?  Will ye ride with Alan?\"\n\n\n\nYou may be sure I was not backward, and Alan's furlough running\n\ntowards an end, we set forth presently upon this joint adventure.\n\n\n\nIt was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the\n\ntown of Dunkirk.  We left our horses at the post, and found a guide\n\nto Bazin's Inn, which lay beyond the walls.  Night was quite\n\nfallen, so that we were the last to leave that fortress, and heard\n\nthe doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge.  On the\n\nother side there lay a lighted suburb, which we thridded for a\n\nwhile, then turned into a dark lane, and presently found ourselves\n\nwading in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering\n\nof the sea.  We travelled in this fashion for some while, following\n\nour conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I had begun to\n\nthink he was perhaps misleading us, when we came to the top of a\n\nsmall brae, and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a\n\nwindow.\n\n\n\n\"Voila l'auberge a Bazin,\" says the guide.\n\n\n\nAlan smacked his lips.  \"An unco lonely bit,\" said he, and I\n\nthought by his tone he was not wholly pleased.\n\n\n\nA little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house,\n\nwhich was all in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the\n\nchambers at the side, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking\n\nfire at the one end of it, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-\n\ntrap at the other.  Here Bazin, who was an ill-looking, big man,\n\ntold us the Scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where,\n\nbut the young lady was above, and he would call her down to us.\n\n\n\nI took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted\n\nit about my throat.  I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting me\n\non the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could\n\nscarce refrain from a sharp word.  But the time was not long to\n\nwait.  I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair.\n\nThis she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face\n\nand a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner\n\nthat extremely dashed me.\n\n\n\n\"My father, James More, will be here soon.  He will be very pleased\n\nto see you,\" she said.  And then of a sudden her face flamed, her\n\neyes lightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure\n\nshe had observed the kerchief.  It was only for a breath that she\n\nwas discomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that she\n\nturned to welcome Alan.  \"And you will be his friend, Alan Breck?\"\n\nshe cried.  \"Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of\n\nyou; and I love you already for all your bravery and goodness.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, well,\" says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing her,\n\n\"and so this is the young lady at the last of it!  David, ye're an\n\nawful poor hand of a description.\"\n\n\n\nI do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people's\n\nhearts; the sound of his voice was like song.\n\n\n\n\"What? will he have been describing me?\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"Little else of it since I ever came out of France!\" says he,\n\n\"forby a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood\n\nby Silvermills.  But cheer up, my dear! ye're bonnier than what he\n\nsaid.  And now there's one thing sure; you and me are to be a pair\n\nof friends.  I'm a kind of a henchman to Davie here; I'm like a\n\ntyke at his heels; and whatever he cares for, I've got to care for\n\ntoo--and by the holy airn! they've got to care for me!  So now you\n\ncan see what way you stand with Alan Breck, and ye'll find ye'll\n\nhardly lose on the transaction.  He's no very bonnie, my dear, but\n\nhe's leal to them he loves.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thank you from my heart for your good words,\" said she.  \"I have\n\nthat honour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any to be\n\nanswering with.\"\n\n\n\nUsing travellers' freedom, we spared to wait for James More, and\n\nsat down to meat, we threesome.  Alan had Catriona sit by him and\n\nwait upon his wants:  he made her drink first out of his glass, he\n\nsurrounded her with continual kind gallantries, and yet never gave\n\nme the most small occasion to be jealous; and he kept the talk so\n\nmuch in his own hand, and that in so merry a note, that neither she\n\nnor I remembered to be embarrassed.  If any had seen us there, it\n\nmust have been supposed that Alan was the old friend and I the\n\nstranger.  Indeed, I had often cause to love and to admire the man,\n\nbut I never loved or admired him better than that night; and I\n\ncould not help remarking to myself (what I was sometimes rather in\n\ndanger of forgetting) that he had not only much experience of life,\n\nbut in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides.  As for\n\nCatriona, she seemed quite carried away; her laugh was like a peal\n\nof bells, her face gay as a May morning; and I own, although I was\n\nwell pleased, yet I was a little sad also, and thought myself a\n\ndull, stockish character in comparison of my friend, and very unfit\n\nto come into a young maid's life, and perhaps ding down her gaiety.\n\n\n\nBut if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was not\n\nalone in it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl was\n\nchanged into a piece of stone.  Through the rest of that evening,\n\nuntil she made an excuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon her\n\nwithout cease; and I can bear testimony that she never smiled,\n\nscarce spoke, and looked mostly on the board in front of her.  So\n\nthat I really marvelled to see so much devotion (as it used to be)\n\nchanged into the very sickness of hate.\n\n\n\nOf James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man\n\nalready, what there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing\n\nout his lies.  Enough that he drank a great deal, and told us very\n\nlittle that was to any possible purpose.  As for the business with\n\nAlan, that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private\n\nhearing.\n\n\n\nIt was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty\n\nweary with four day's ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.\n\n\n\nWe were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with a\n\nsingle bed.  Alan looked on me with a queer smile.\n\n\n\n\"Ye muckle ass!\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"What do ye mean by that?\" I cried.\n\n\n\n\"Mean?  What do I mean!  It's extraordinar, David man,\" say he,\n\n\"that you should be so mortal stupit.\"\n\n\n\nAgain I begged him to speak out.\n\n\n\n\"Well, it's this of it,\" said he.  \"I told ye there were the two\n\nkinds of women--them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the\n\nothers.  Just you try for yoursel, my bonny man!  But what's that\n\nneepkin at your craig?\"\n\n\n\nI told him.\n\n\n\n\"I thocht it was something thereabout\" said he.\n\n\n\nNor would he say another word though I besieged him long with\n\nimportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX--THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaylight showed us how solitary the inn stood.  It was plainly hard\n\nupon the sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every side\n\nwith scabbit hills of sand.  There was, indeed, only one thing in\n\nthe nature of a prospect, where there stood out over a brae the two\n\nsails of a windmill, like an ass's ears, but with the ass quite\n\nhidden.  It was strange (after the wind rose, for at first it was\n\ndead calm) to see the turning and following of each other of these\n\ngreat sails behind the hillock.  Scarce any road came by there; but\n\na number of footways travelled among the bents in all directions up\n\nto Mr. Bazin's door.  The truth is, he was a man of many trades,\n\nnot any one of them honest, and the position of his inn was the\n\nbest of his livelihood.  Smugglers frequented it; political agents\n\nand forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await\n\ntheir passages; and I daresay there was worse behind, for a whole\n\nfamily might have been butchered in that house and nobody the\n\nwiser.\n\n\n\nI slept little and ill.  Long ere it was day, I had slipped from\n\nbeside my bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking\n\nto and fro before the door.  Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little\n\nafter, sprang up a wind out of the west, which burst the clouds,\n\nlet through the sun, and set the mill to the turning.  There was\n\nsomething of spring in the sunshine, or else it was in my heart;\n\nand the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind\n\nthe hill, diverted me extremely.  At times I could hear a creak of\n\nthe machinery; and by half-past eight of the day, and I thought\n\nthis dreary, desert place was like a paradise.\n\n\n\nFor all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began to\n\nbe aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain.  It seemed\n\nthere was trouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came up\n\nand went down over the hill, were like persons spying; and outside\n\nof all fancy, it was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a\n\nyoung lady to be brought to dwell in.\n\n\n\nAt breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James More\n\nwas in some danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was alive to\n\nthe same, and watched him close; and this appearance of duplicity\n\nupon the one side, and vigilance upon the other, held me on live\n\ncoals.  The meal was no sooner over than James seemed to come began\n\nto make apologies.  He had an appointment of a private nature in\n\nthe town (it was with the French nobleman, he told me), and we\n\nwould please excuse him till about noon.  Meanwhile he carried his\n\ndaughter aside to the far end of the room, where he seemed to speak\n\nrather earnestly and she to listen with much inclination.\n\n\n\n\"I am caring less and less about this man James,\" said Alan.\n\n\"There's something no right with the man James, and I shouldnae\n\nwonder but what Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day.  I\n\nwould like fine to see yon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay\n\nyou could find an employ to yoursel, and that would be to speir at\n\nthe lassie for some news o' your affair.  Just tell it to her\n\nplainly--tell her ye're a muckle ass at the off-set; and then, if I\n\nwere you, and ye could do it naitural, I would just mint to her I\n\nwas in some kind of a danger; a' weemenfolk likes that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural,\" says I, mocking him.\n\n\n\n\"The more fool you!\" says he.  \"Then ye'll can tell her that I\n\nrecommended it; that'll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae\n\nwonder but what that was the next best.  But see to the pair of\n\nthem!  If I didnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was\n\nawful pleased and chief with Alan, I would think there was some\n\nkind of hocus-pocus about you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"She thinks a heap of me,\" says he.  \"And I'm no like you:  I'm one\n\nthat can tell.  That she does--she thinks a heap of Alan.  And\n\ntroth! I'm thinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your\n\npermission, Shaws, I'll be getting a wee yont amang the bents, so\n\nthat I can see what way James goes.\"\n\n\n\nOne after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast\n\ntable; James to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs\n\nto her own chamber.  I could very well understand how she should\n\navoid to be alone with me; yet was none the better pleased with it\n\nfor that, and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the\n\nmen returned.  Upon the whole, the best appeared to me to do like\n\nAlan.  If I was out of view among the sandhills, the fine morning\n\nwould decoy her forth; and once I had her in the open, I could\n\nplease myself.\n\n\n\nNo sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a\n\nhillock before she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there,\n\nand (seeing nobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward,\n\nand by which I followed her.  I was in no haste to make my presence\n\nknown; the further she went I made sure of the longer hearing to my\n\nsuit; and the ground being all sandy it was easy to follow her\n\nunheard.  The path rose and came at last to the head of a knowe.\n\nThence I had a picture for the first time of what a desolate\n\nwilderness that inn stood hidden in; where was no man to be seen,\n\nnor any house of man, except just Bazin's and the windmill.  Only a\n\nlittle further on, the sea appeared and two or three ships upon it,\n\npretty as a drawing.  One of these was extremely close in to be so\n\ngreat a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion, when I\n\nrecognised the trim of the Seahorse.  What should an English ship\n\nbe doing so near in to France?  Why was Alan brought into her\n\nneighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue?\n\nand was it by accident, or by design, that the daughter of James\n\nMore should walk that day to the seaside?\n\n\n\nPresently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills and\n\nabove the beach.  It was here long and solitary; with a man-o'-\n\nwar's boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect, and an\n\nofficer in charge and pacing the sands like one who waited.  I sat\n\ndown where the rough grass a good deal covered me, and looked for\n\nwhat should follow.  Catriona went straight to the boat; the\n\nofficer met her with civilities; they had ten words together; I saw\n\na letter changing hands; and there was Catriona returning.  At the\n\nsame time, as if this were all her business on the Continent, the\n\nboat shoved off and was headed for the Seahorse.  But I observed\n\nthe officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents.\n\n\n\nI liked the business little; and the more I considered of it, liked\n\nit less.  Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona?  She\n\ndrew near with her head down, looking constantly on the sand, and\n\nmade so tender a picture that I could not bear to doubt her\n\ninnocence.  The next, she raised her face and recognised me; seemed\n\nto hesitate, and then came on again, but more slowly, and I thought\n\nwith a changed colour.  And at that thought, all else that was upon\n\nmy bosom--fears, suspicions, the care of my friend's life--was\n\nclean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood waiting her in\n\na drunkenness of hope.\n\n\n\nI gave her \"good morning\" as she came up, which she returned with a\n\ngood deal of composure.\n\n\n\n\"Will you forgive my having followed you?\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"I know you are always meaning kindly,\" she replied; and then, with\n\na little outburst, \"but why will you be sending money to that man!\n\nIt must not be.\"\n\n\n\n\"I never sent it for him,\" said I, \"but for you, as you know well.\"\n\n\n\n\"And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,\" she\n\nsaid.  \"David, it is not right.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is not, it is all wrong,\" said I, \"and I pray God he will help\n\nthis dull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better.\n\nCatriona, this is no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your\n\npardon for the word, but yon man is no fit father to take care of\n\nyou.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do not be speaking of him, even!\" was her cry.\n\n\n\n\"And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am\n\nthinking, O, be sure of that!\" says I.  \"I think of the one thing.\n\nI have been alone now this long time in Leyden; and when I was by\n\nway of at my studies, still I was thinking of that.  Next Alan\n\ncame, and I went among soldier-men to their big dinners; and still\n\nI had the same thought.  And it was the same before, when I had her\n\nthere beside me.  Catriona, do you see this napkin at my throat!\n\nYou cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you.  They're\n\nYOUR colours now; I wear them in my heart.  My dear, I cannot be\n\nwanting you.  O, try to put up with me!\"\n\n\n\nI stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.\n\n\n\n\"Try to put up with me,\" I was saying, \"try and bear me with a\n\nlittle.\"\n\n\n\nStill she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me like a\n\nfear of death.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" I cried, gazing on her hard, \"is it a mistake again?\n\nAm I quite lost?\"\n\n\n\nShe raised her face to me, breathless.\n\n\n\n\"Do you want me, Davie, truly?\" said she, and I scarce could hear\n\nher say it.\n\n\n\n\"I do that,\" said I.  \"O, sure you know it--I do that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have nothing left to give or to keep back,\" said she.  \"I was\n\nall yours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of me!\"\n\nshe said,\n\n\n\nThis was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and\n\nconspicuous, we were to be seen there even from the English ship;\n\nbut I kneeled down before her in the sand, and embraced her knees,\n\nand burst into that storm of weeping that I thought it must have\n\nbroken me.  All thought was wholly beaten from my mind by the\n\nvehemency of my discomposure.  I knew not where I was.  I had\n\nforgot why I was happy; only I knew she stooped, and I felt her\n\ncherish me to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a\n\nwhirl.\n\n\n\n\"Davie,\" she was saying, \"O, Davie, is this what you think of me!\n\nIs it so that you were caring for poor me!  O, Davie, Davie!\"\n\n\n\nWith that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect\n\ngladness.\n\n\n\nIt might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of\n\nwhat a mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her, with\n\nher hands in mine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud for\n\npleasure like a child, and called her foolish and kind names.  I\n\nhave never seen the place that looked so pretty as those bents by\n\nDunkirk; and the windmill sails, as they bobbed over the knowe,\n\nwere like a tune of music.\n\n\n\nI know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all\n\nelse besides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference to her\n\nfather, which brought us to reality.\n\n\n\n\"My little friend,\" I was calling her again and again, rejoicing to\n\nsummon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on her,\n\nand to be a little distant--\"My little friend, now you are mine\n\naltogether; mine for good, my little friend and that man's no\n\nlonger at all.\"\n\n\n\nThere came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands\n\nfrom mine.\n\n\n\n\"Davie, take me away from him!\" she cried.  \"There's something\n\nwrong; he's not true.  There will be something wrong; I have a\n\ndreadful terror here at my heart.  What will he be wanting at all\n\nevents with that King's ship?  What will this word be saying?\"  And\n\nshe held the letter forth.  \"My mind misgives me, it will be some\n\nill to Alan.  Open it, Davie--open it and see.\"\n\n\n\nI took it, and looked at it, and shook my head.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"it goes against me, I cannot open a man's letter.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not to save your friend?\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"I cannae tell,\" said I.  \"I think not.  If I was only sure!\"\n\n\n\n\"And you have but to break the seal!\" said she.\n\n\n\n\"I know it,\" said I, \"but the thing goes against me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Give it here,\" said she, \"and I will open it myself.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nor you neither,\" said I.  \"You least of all.  It concerns your\n\nfather, and his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting.  No\n\nquestion but the place is dangerous-like, and the English ship\n\nbeing here, and your father having word from it, and yon officer\n\nthat stayed ashore.  He would not be alone either; there must be\n\nmore along with him; I daresay we are spied upon this minute.  Ay,\n\nno doubt, the letter should be opened; but somehow, not by you nor\n\nme.\"\n\n\n\nI was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome with\n\na sense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan, come back\n\nagain from following James and walking by himself among the sand-\n\nhills.  He was in his soldier's coat, of course, and mighty fine;\n\nbut I could not avoid to shudder when I thought how little that\n\njacket would avail him, if he were once caught and flung in a\n\nskiff, and carried on board of the Seahorse, a deserter, a rebel,\n\nand now a condemned murderer.\n\n\n\n\"There,\" said I, \"there is the man that has the best right to open\n\nit:  or not, as he thinks fit.\"\n\n\n\nWith which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be a\n\nmark for him.\n\n\n\n\"If it is so--if it be more disgrace--will you can bear it?\" she\n\nasked, looking upon me with a burning eye.\n\n\n\n\"I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but\n\nthe once,\" said I.  \"What do you think I answered?  That if I liked\n\nyou as I thought I did--and O, but I like you better!--I would\n\nmarry you at his gallows' foot.\"\n\n\n\nThe blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon me,\n\nholding my hand:  and it was so that we awaited Alan.\n\n\n\nHe came with one of his queer smiles.  \"What was I telling ye,\n\nDavid?\" says he.\n\n\n\n\"There is a time for all things, Alan,\" said I, \"and this time is\n\nserious.  How have you sped?  You can speak out plain before this\n\nfriend of ours.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have been upon a fool's errand,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"I doubt we have done better than you, then,\" said I; \"and, at\n\nleast, here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of.  Do\n\nyou see that?\" I went on, pointing to the ship.  \"That is the\n\nSeahorse, Captain Palliser.\"\n\n\n\n\"I should ken her, too,\" says Alan.  \"I had fyke enough with her\n\nwhen she was stationed in the Forth.  But what ails the man to come\n\nso close?\"\n\n\n\n\"I will tell you why he came there first,\" said I.  \"It was to\n\nbring this letter to James More.  Why he stops here now that it's\n\ndelivered, what it's likely to be about, why there's an officer\n\nhiding in the bents, and whether or not it's probable that he's\n\nalone--I would rather you considered for yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"A letter to James More?\" said he.\n\n\n\n\"The same,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"Well, and I can tell ye more than that,\" said Alan.  \"For the last\n\nnight, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing with\n\nsome one in the French, and then the door of that inn to be opened\n\nand shut.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alan!\" cried I, \"you slept all night, and I am here to prove it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!\"\n\nsays he.  \"But the business looks bad.  Let's see the letter.\"\n\n\n\nI gave it him.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" said he, \"you have to excuse me, my dear; but there's\n\nnothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I'll have\n\nto break this seal.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is my wish,\" said Catriona.\n\n\n\nHe opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air.\n\n\n\n\"The stinking brock!\" says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.\n\n\"Here, let's get our things together.  This place is fair death to\n\nme.\"  And he began to walk towards the inn.\n\n\n\nIt was Catriona that spoke the first.  \"He has sold you?\" she\n\nasked.\n\n\n\n\"Sold me, my dear,\" said Alan.  \"But thanks to you and Davie, I'll\n\ncan jink him yet.  Just let me win upon my horse,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona must come with us,\" said I.  \"She can have no more\n\ntraffic with that man.  She and I are to be married.\"  At which she\n\npressed my hand to her side.\n\n\n\n\"Are ye there with it?\" says Alan, looking back.  \"The best day's\n\nwork that ever either of you did yet!  And I'm bound to say, my\n\ndawtie, ye make a real, bonny couple.\"\n\n\n\nThe way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill,\n\nwhere I was aware of a man in seaman's trousers, who seemed to be\n\nspying from behind it.  Only, of course, we took him in the rear.\n\n\n\n\"See, Alan!\"\n\n\n\n\"Wheesht!\" said, he, \"this is my affairs.\"\n\n\n\nThe man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of the\n\nmill, and we got up close before he noticed.  Then he turned, and\n\nwe saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany face.\n\n\n\n\"I think, sir,\" says Alan, \"that you speak the English?\"\n\n\n\n\"Non, monsieur,\" says he, with an incredible bad accent.\n\n\n\n\"Non, monsieur,\" cries Alan, mocking him.  \"Is that how they learn\n\nyou French on the Seahorse?  Ye muckle, gutsey hash, here's a Scots\n\nboot to your English hurdies!\"\n\n\n\nAnd bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt the man a kick\n\nthat laid him on his nose.  Then he stood, with a savage smile, and\n\nwatched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand-\n\nhills.\n\n\n\n\"But it's high time I was clear of these empty bents!\" said Alan;\n\nand continued his way at top speed, and we still following, to the\n\nbackdoor of Bazin's inn.\n\n\n\nIt chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face\n\nwith James More entering by the other.\n\n\n\n\"Here!\" said I to Catriona, \"quick! upstairs with you and make your\n\npackets; this is no fit scene for you.\"\n\n\n\nIn the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long\n\nroom.  She passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after she\n\nwas some way up I saw her turn and glance at them again, though\n\nwithout pausing.  Indeed, they were worth looking at.  Alan wore as\n\nthey met one of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness,\n\nyet with something eminently warlike, so that James smelled danger\n\noff the man, as folk smell fire in a house, and stood prepared for\n\naccidents.\n\n\n\nTime pressed.  Alan's situation in that solitary place, and his\n\nenemies about him, might have daunted Caesar.  It made no change in\n\nhim; and it was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he\n\nbegan the interview.\n\n\n\n\"A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,\" said he.  \"What'll yon\n\nbusiness of yours be just about?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long story,\" says\n\nJames, \"I think it will keep very well till we have eaten.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm none so sure of that,\" said Alan.  \"It sticks in my mind it's\n\neither now or never; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here have\n\ngotten a line, and we're thinking of the road.\"\n\n\n\nI saw a little surprise in James's eye; but he held himself\n\nstoutly.\n\n\n\n\"I have but the one word to say to cure you of that,\" said he, \"and\n\nthat is the name of my business.\"\n\n\n\n\"Say it then,\" says Alan.  \"Hout! wha minds for Davie?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a matter that would make us both rich men,\" said James.\n\n\n\n\"Do you tell me that?\" cries Alan.\n\n\n\n\"I do, sir,\" said James.  \"The plain fact is that it is Cluny's\n\nTreasure.\"\n\n\n\n\"No!\" cried Alan.  \"Have ye got word of it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,\" said James.\n\n\n\n\"This crowns all!\" says Alan.  \"Well, and I'm glad I came to\n\nDunkirk.  And so this was your business, was it?  Halvers, I'm\n\nthinking?\"\n\n\n\n\"That is the business, sir,\" said James.\n\n\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike\n\ninterest, \"it has naething to do with the Seahorse, then?\" he\n\nasked,\n\n\n\n\"With what?\" says James.\n\n\n\n\"Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon\n\nwindmill?\" pursued Alan.  \"Hut, man! have done with your lees!  I\n\nhave Palliser's letter here in my pouch.  You're by with it, James\n\nMore.  You can never show your face again with dacent folk.\"\n\n\n\nJames was taken all aback with it.  He stood a second, motionless\n\nand white, then swelled with the living anger.\n\n\n\n\"Do you talk to me, you bastard?\" he roared out.\n\n\n\n\"Ye glee'd swine!\" cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet on the\n\nmouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together.\n\n\n\nAt the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back\n\nfrom the collision.  The next I saw, James parried a thrust so\n\nnearly that I thought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that\n\nthis was the girl's father, and in a manner almost my own, and I\n\ndrew and ran in to sever them.\n\n\n\n\"Keep back, Davie!  Are ye daft!  Damn ye, keep back!\" roared Alan.\n\n\"Your blood be on your ain heid then!\"\n\n\n\nI beat their blades down twice.  I was knocked reeling against the\n\nwall; I was back again betwixt them.  They took no heed of me,\n\nthrusting at each other like two furies.  I can never think how I\n\navoided being stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two\n\nRodomonts, and the whole business turned about me like a piece of a\n\ndream; in the midst of which I heard a great cry from the stair,\n\nand Catriona sprang before her father.  In the same moment the\n\npoint of my sword encountered some thing yielding.  It came back to\n\nme reddened.  I saw the blood flow on the girl's kerchief, and\n\nstood sick.\n\n\n\n\"Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter after\n\nall!\" she cried.\n\n\n\n\"My dear, I have done with him,\" said Alan, and went, and sat on a\n\ntable, with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand.\n\n\n\nAwhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then swung\n\nsuddenly about and faced him.\n\n\n\n\"Begone!\" was her word, \"take your shame out of my sight; leave me\n\nwith clean folk.  I am a daughter of Alpin!  Shame of the sons of\n\nAlpin, begone!\"\n\n\n\nIt was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my\n\nown bloodied sword.  The two stood facing, she with the red stain\n\non her kerchief, he white as a rag.  I knew him well enough--I knew\n\nit must have pierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he\n\nbetook himself to a bravado air.\n\n\n\n\"Why,\" says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright eye\n\non Alan, \"if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau--\"\n\n\n\n\"There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,\" says\n\nAlan.\n\n\n\n\"Sir!\" cries James.\n\n\n\n\"James More,\" says Alan, \"this lady daughter of yours is to marry\n\nmy friend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a hale\n\ncarcase.  But take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of\n\nharm's way or ower late.  Little as you suppose it, there are\n\nleemits to my temper.\"\n\n\n\n\"Be damned, sir, but my money's there!\" said James.\n\n\n\n\"I'm vexed about that, too,\" says Alan, with his funny face, \"but\n\nnow, ye see, it's mines.\"  And then with more gravity, \"Be you\n\nadvised, James More, you leave this house.\"\n\n\n\nJames seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it's to be\n\nthought he had enough of Alan's swordsmanship, for he suddenly put\n\noff his hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned) bade us\n\nfarewell in a series.  With which he was gone.\n\n\n\nAt the same time a spell was lifted from me.\n\n\n\n\"Catriona,\" I cried, \"it was me--it was my sword.  O, are you much\n\nhurt?\"\n\n\n\n\"I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it; it was done\n\ndefending that bad man, my father.  See!\" she said, and showed me a\n\nbleeding scratch, \"see, you have made a man of me now.  I will\n\ncarry a wound like an old soldier.\"\n\n\n\nJoy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave\n\nnature, supported me.  I embraced her, I kissed the wound.\n\n\n\n\"And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?\"\n\nsays Alan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either\n\nshoulder, \"My dear,\" he said, \"you're a true daughter of Alpin.  By\n\nall accounts, he was a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of\n\nyou.  If ever I was to get married, it's the marrow of you I would\n\nbe seeking for a mother to my sons.  And I bear's a king's name and\n\nspeak the truth.\"\n\n\n\nHe said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the\n\ngirl, and through her, to me.  It seemed to wipe us clean of all\n\nJames More's disgraces.  And the next moment he was just himself\n\nagain.\n\n\n\n\"And now by your leave, my dawties,\" said he, \"this is a' very\n\nbonny; but Alan Breck'll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than\n\nhe's caring for; and Dod! I think this is a grand place to be\n\nleaving.\"\n\n\n\nThe word recalled us to some wisdom.  Alan ran upstairs and\n\nreturned with our saddle-bags and James More's portmanteau; I\n\npicked up Catriona's bundle where she had dropped it on the stair;\n\nand we were setting forth out of that dangerous house, when Bazin\n\nstopped the way with cries and gesticulations.  He had whipped\n\nunder a table when the swords were drawn, but now he was as bold as\n\na lion.  There was his bill to be settled, there was a chair\n\nbroken, Alan had sat among his dinner things, James More had fled.\n\n\n\n\"Here,\" I cried, \"pay yourself,\" and flung him down some Lewie\n\nd'ors; for I thought it was no time to be accounting.\n\n\n\nHe sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into\n\nthe open.  Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and\n\nclosing in; a little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to\n\nhurry them; and right behind him, like some foolish person holding\n\nup his hands, were the sails of the windmill turning.\n\n\n\nAlan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run.  He carried\n\na great weight in James More's portmanteau; but I think he would as\n\nsoon have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his\n\nrevenge; and he ran so that I was distressed to follow him, and\n\nmarvelled and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side.\n\n\n\nAs soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other\n\nside; and the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs.  We\n\nhad a start of some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-\n\nlegged tarpaulins after all, that could not hope to better us at\n\nsuch an exercise.  I suppose they were armed, but did not care to\n\nuse their pistols on French ground.  And as soon as I perceived\n\nthat we not only held our advantage but drew a little away, I began\n\nto feel quite easy of the issue.  For all which, it was a hot,\n\nbrisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was still far off;\n\nand when we popped over a knowe, and found a company of the\n\ngarrison marching on the other side on some manoeuvre, I could very\n\nwell understand the word that Alan had.\n\n\n\nHe stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, \"They're a\n\nreal bonny folk, the French nation,\" says he.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held a\n\nvery necessary council-of-war on our position.  We had taken a\n\ndaughter from her father at the sword's point; any judge would give\n\nher back to him at once, and by all likelihood clap me and Alan\n\ninto jail; and though we had an argument upon our side in Captain\n\nPalliser's letter, neither Catriona nor I were very keen to be\n\nusing it in public.  Upon all accounts it seemed the most prudent\n\nto carry the girl to Paris to the hands of her own chieftain,\n\nMacgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help his\n\nkinswoman, on the one hand, and not at all anxious to dishonour\n\nJames upon other.\n\n\n\nWe made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so good\n\nat the riding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle\n\nsince the 'Forty-five.  But we made it out at last, reached Paris\n\nearly of a Sabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan's\n\nguidance, to find Bohaldie.  He was finely lodged, and lived in a\n\ngood style, having a pension on the Scots Fund, as well as private\n\nmeans; greeted Catriona like one of his own house, and seemed\n\naltogether very civil and discreet, but not particularly open.  We\n\nasked of the news of James More.  \"Poor James!\" said he, and shook\n\nhis head and smiled, so that I thought he knew further than he\n\nmeant to tell.  Then we showed him Palliser's letter, and he drew a\n\nlong face at that.\n\n\n\n\"Poor James!\" said he again.  \"Well, there are worse folk than\n\nJames More, too.  But this is dreadful bad.  Tut, tut, he must have\n\nforgot himself entirely!  This is a most undesirable letter.  But,\n\nfor all that, gentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make it\n\npublic for.  It's an ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are\n\nall Scots folk and all Hieland.\"\n\n\n\nUpon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon the\n\nquestion of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands, as\n\nthough there had been no such person as James More, and gave\n\nCatriona away with very pretty manners and agreeable compliments in\n\nFrench.  It was not till all was over, and our healths drunk, that\n\nhe told us James was in that city, whither he had preceded us some\n\ndays, and where he now lay sick, and like to die.  I thought I saw\n\nby my wife's face what way her inclination pointed.\n\n\n\n\"And let us go see him, then,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\"If it is your pleasure,\" said Catriona.  These were early days.\n\n\n\nHe was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief, in a\n\ngreat house upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret\n\nwhere he lay by the sound of Highland piping.  It seemed he had\n\njust borrowed a set of them from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness;\n\nthough he was no such hand as was his brother Rob, he made good\n\nmusic of the kind; and it was strange to observe the French folk\n\ncrowding on the stairs, and some of them laughing.  He lay propped\n\nin a pallet.  The first look of him I saw he was upon his last\n\nbusiness; and, doubtless, this was a strange place for him to die\n\nin.  But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end with\n\npatience.  Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know\n\nwe were married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a\n\nbenediction like a patriarch.\n\n\n\n\"I have been never understood,\" said he.  \"I forgive you both\n\nwithout an afterthought;\" after which he spoke for all the world in\n\nhis old manner, was so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon\n\nhis pipes, and borrowed a small sum before I left.\n\n\n\nI could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his\n\nbehaviour; but he was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always\n\nfresh to him.  I think he forgave me every time we met; and when\n\nafter some four days he passed away in a kind of odour of\n\naffectionate sanctity, I could have torn my hair out for\n\nexasperation.  I had him buried; but what to put upon his tomb was\n\nquite beyond me, till at last I considered the date would look best\n\nalone.\n\n\n\nI thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we had\n\nappeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly look\n\nstrange to return in a new character.  Scotland would be doing for\n\nus; and thither, after I had recovered that which I had left\n\nbehind, we sailed in a Low Country ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and Mr.\n\nAlan Balfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly to\n\nan end.  A great many of the folk that took a part in it, you will\n\nfind (if you think well) that you have seen and spoken with.\n\nAlison Hastie in Limekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle\n\nwhen you were too small to know of it, and walked abroad with you\n\nin the policy when you were bigger.  That very fine great lady that\n\nis Miss Barbara's name-mamma is no other than the same Miss Grant\n\nthat made so much a fool of David Balfour in the house of the Lord\n\nAdvocate.  And I wonder whether you remember a little, lean, lively\n\ngentleman in a scratch-wig and a wraprascal, that came to Shaws\n\nvery late of a dark night, and whom you were awakened out of your\n\nbeds and brought down to the dining-hall to be presented to, by the\n\nname of Mr. Jamieson?  Or has Alan forgotten what he did at Mr.\n\nJamieson's request--a most disloyal act--for which, by the letter\n\nof the law, he might be hanged--no less than drinking the king's\n\nhealth ACROSS THE WATER?  These were strange doings in a good Whig\n\nhouse!  But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to\n\nmy corn-barn; and the name they know him by now in France is the\n\nChevalier Stewart.\n\n\n\nAs for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in the\n\nnext days, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and\n\nmamma.  It is true we were not so wise as we might have been, and\n\nmade a great deal of sorrow out of nothing; but you will find as\n\nyou grow up that even the artful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant\n\nMr. Alan, will be not so very much wiser than their parents.  For\n\nthe life of man upon this world of ours is a funny business.  They\n\ntalk of the angels weeping; but I think they must more often be\n\nholding their sides as they look on; and there was one thing I\n\ndetermined to do when I began this long story, and that was to tell\n\nout everything as it befell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n{1}  Conspicuous.\n\n\n\n{2}  Country.\n\n\n\n{3}  The Fairies.\n\n\n\n{4}  Flatteries.\n\n\n\n{5}  Trust to.\n\n\n\n{6}  This must have reference to Dr. Cameron on his first visit.--\n\nD.
