CLEMENT COLL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nI take leave to dedicate this book to Mr. Elmer Davis, through whose\nfriendly offices I was led to track down the hero of these\nadventures and to find the true account of them even better than the\ndaily paper promised.\n\nHad Ranjoor Singh and his men been Muhammadans their accomplishment\nwould have been sufficiently wonderful. For Sikhs to attempt what\nthey carried through, even under such splendid leadership as Ranjoor\nSingh's, was to defy the very nth degree of odds. To have tried to\ntell the tale otherwise than in Hira Singh's own words would have\nbeen to varnish gold. Amid the echoes of the roar of the guns in\nFlanders, the world is inclined to overlook India's share in it all\nand the stout proud loyalty of Indian hearts. May this tribute to\nthe gallant Indian gentlemen who came to fight our battles serve to\nremind its readers that they who give their best, and they who take,\nare one.\n\nT. M.\n\n\n\n     One hundred Indian troops of the\n     British Army have arrived at Kabul,\n     Afghanistan, after a four months'\n     march from Constantinople. The men\n     were captured in Flanders by the\n     Germans and were sent to Turkey in the\n     hope that, being Mohammedans, they\n     might join the Turks. But they\n     remained loyal to Great Britain and\n     finally escaped, heading for Afghanistan.\n     They now intend to join their\n     regimental depot in India, so it\n     is reported.\n\n     New York Times, July, 1915\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHira Singh\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nLet a man, an arrow, and an answer each go straight. Each is his own\nwitness. God is judge.--EASTERN PROVERB.\n\n\nA Sikh who must have stood about six feet without his turban--and\nonly imagination knows how stately he was with it--loomed out of the\nviolet mist of an Indian morning and scrutinized me with calm brown\neyes. His khaki uniform, like two of the medal ribbons on his\nbreast, was new, but nothing else about him suggested rawness.\nAttitude, grayness, dignity, the unstudied strength of his\npoliteness, all sang aloud of battles won. Battles with himself they\nmay have been--but they were won.\n\nI began remembering ice-polished rocks that the glaciers once\ndropped along Maine valleys, when his quiet voice summoned me back\nto India and the convalescent camp beyond whose outer gate I stood.\nTwo flags on lances formed the gate and the boundary line was mostly\nimaginary; but one did not trespass, because at about the point\nwhere vision no longer pierced the mist there stood a sentry, and\nthe grounding of a butt on gravel and now and then a cough announced\nothers beyond him again.\n\n\"I have permission,\" I said, \"to find a certain Risaldar-major\nRanjoor Singh, and to ask him questions.\"\n\nHe smiled. His eyes, betraying nothing but politeness, read the very\ndepths of mine.\n\n\"Has the sahib credentials?\" he asked. So I showed him the permit\ncovered with signatures that was the one scrap of writing left in my\npossession after several searchings.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said gravely. \"There were others who had no permits.\nWill you walk with me through the camp?\"\n\nThat was new annoyance, for with such a search as I had in mind what\ninterest could there be in a camp for convalescent Sikhs? Tents\npitched at intervals--a hospital marquee--a row of trees under which\nsome of the wounded might sit and dream the day through-these were\nall things one could imagine without journeying to India. But there\nwas nothing to do but accept, and I walked beside him, wishing I\ncould stride with half his grace.\n\n\"There are no well men here,\" he told me. \"Even the heavy work about\nthe camp is done by convalescents.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here?\" I asked, not trying to conceal admiration\nfor his strength and stature.\n\n\"I, too, am not yet quite recovered.\"\n\n\"From what?\" I asked, impudent because I felt desperate. But I drew\nno fire.\n\n\"I do not know the English name for my complaint,\" he said. (But he\nspoke English better than I, he having mastered it, whereas I was\nonly born to its careless use.)\n\n\"How long do you expect to remain on the sick list?\" I asked,\nbecause a woman once told me that the way to make a man talk is to\nseem to be interested in himself.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said he.\n\nHe showed me about the camp, and we came to a stand at last under\nthe branches of an enormous mango tree. Early though it was, a Sikh\nnon-commissioned officer was already sitting propped against the\ntrunk with his bandaged feet stretched out in front of him--a\npeculiar attitude for a Sikh.\n\n\"That one knows English,\" my guide said, nodding. And making me a\nmost profound salaam, he added: \"Why not talk with him? I have\nduties. I must go.\"\n\nThe officer turned away, and I paid him the courtesy due from one\nman to another. It shall always be a satisfying memory that I raised\nmy hat to him and that he saluted me.\n\n\"What is that officer's name?\" I asked, and the man on the ground\nseemed astonished that I did not know.\n\n\"Risaldar-major Ranjoor Singh bahadur!\" he said.\n\nFor a second I was possessed by the notion of running after him,\nuntil I recalled that he had known my purpose from the first and\nthat therefore his purpose must have been deliberate. Obviously, I\nwould better pursue the opportunity that in his own way He had given\nme.\n\n\"What is your name?\" I asked the man on the ground.\n\n\"Hira Singh,\" he answered, and at that I sat down beside him. For I\nhad also heard of Hira Singh.\n\nHe made quite a fuss at first because, he said, the dusty earth\nbeneath a tree was no place for a sahib. But suddenly he jumped to\nthe conclusion I must be American, and ceased at once to be troubled\nabout my dignity. On the other hand, he grew perceptibly less\ndistant. Not more friendly, perhaps, but less guarded.\n\n\"You have talked with Sikhs in California?\" he asked, and I nodded.\n\n\"Then you have heard lies, sahib. I know the burden of their song. A\nbad Sikh and a bad Englishman alike resemble rock torn loose. The\ngreater the height from which they fall, the deeper they dive into\nthe mud. Which is the true Sikh, he who marched with us or he who\nabuses us? Yet I am told that in America men believe what hired\nSikhs write for the German papers.\n\n\"No man hired me, sahib, although one or two have tried. When I came\nof age I sought acceptance in the army, and was chosen among many.\nWhen my feet are healed I shall return to duty. I am a true Sikh. If\nthe sahib cares to listen, I will tell him truth that has not been\nwritten in the papers.\"\n\nSo, having diagnosed my nationality and need, he proceeded to tell\nme patiently things that many English are in the dark about, both\nbecause of the censorship and because of the prevailing superstition\nthat the English resent being told--he stabbing and sweeping at the\ndust with a broken twig and making little heaps and dents by way of\nillustration,--I sitting silent, brushing away the flies.\n\nDay after day I sought him soon after dawn when they were rolling up\nthe tent-flaps. I shared the curry and chapatties that a trooper\nbrought to him at noon, and I fetched water for him to drink from\ntime to time. It was dusk each day before I left him, so that, what\nwith his patience and my diligence, I have been able to set down the\nstory as he told it, nearly in his own words.\n\nBut of Risaldar-major Ranjoor Singh bahadur in the flesh, I have not\nhad another glimpse. I went in search of him the very first evening,\nonly to learn that he had \"passed his medical\" that afternoon and\nhad returned at once to active service.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe Sikhs have a proverb, sahib, that the ruler and the ruled are\none. That has many sides to it of which one is this: India having\nmany moods and minds, the British are versatile. Not altogether\nwise, for who is? When, for instance, did India make an end of\nwooing foolishness? Since the British rule India, they may wear her\nflowers, but they drink her dregs. They may bear her honors, but her\nblame as well. As the head is to the body, the ruler and the ruled\nare one.\n\nYet, as I understand it, when this great war came there was\ndisappointment in some quarters and surprise in others because we,\nwho were known not to be contented, did not rise at once in\nrebellion. To that the answer is faith finds faith. It is the great\ngift of the British that they set faith in the hearts of other men.\n\nThere were dark hours, sahib, before it was made known that there\nwas war. The censorship shut down on us, and there were a thousand\nrumors for every one known fact. There had come a sudden swarm of\nSikhs from abroad, and of other men--all hirelings--who talked much\nabout Germany and a change of masters. There were dark sayings, and\narrests by night. Men with whom we talked at dusk had disappeared at\ndawn. Ranjoor Singh, not yet bahadur but risaldar-major, commanding\nSquadron D of my regiment, Outram's Own, became very busy in the\nbazaars; and many a night I followed him, not always with his\nknowledge. I intended to protect him, but I also wished to know what\nthe doings were.\n\nThere was a woman. Did the sahib ever hear of a plot that had not a\nwoman in it? He went to the woman's house. In hiding, I heard her\nsneer at him. I heard her mock him. I would have doubted him forever\nif I had heard her praise him, but she did not, and I knew him to be\na true man.\n\nOurs is more like the French than the British system; there is more\nintercourse between officer and non-commissioned officer and man.\nBut Ranjoor Singh is a silent man, and we of his squadron, though we\nrespected him, knew little of what was in his mind. When there began\nto be talk about his knowing German, and about his secrecy, and\nabout his nights spent at HER place, who could answer? We all knew\nhe knew German.\n\nThere were printed pamphlets from God-knows-where, and letters from\nAmerica, that made pretense at explanations; and there were spies\nwho whispered. My voice, saying I had listened and seen and that I\ntrusted, was as a quail's note when the monsoon bursts. None heard.\nSo that in the end I held my tongue. I even began to doubt.\n\nThen a trooper of ours was murdered in the bazaar, and Ranjoor\nSingh's servant disappeared. Within an hour Ranjoor Singh was gone,\ntoo.\n\nThen came news of war. Then our officers came among us to ask\nwhether we are willing or not to take a hand in this great quarrel.\nPerhaps in that hour if they had not asked us we might have judged\nthat we and they were not one after all.\n\nBut they did ask, and let a man, an arrow, and an answer each go\nstraight, say we. Our Guru tells us Sikhs should fight ever on the\nside of the oppressed; the weaker the oppressed, the more the reason\nfor our taking part with them. Our officers made no secret about the\nstrength of the enemy, and we made none with them of our feeling in\nthe matter. They were proud men that day. Colonel Kirby was a very\nproud man. We were prouder than he, except when we thought of\nRanjoor Singh.\n\nThen, as it were out of the night itself, there came a message by\nword of mouth from Ranjoor Singh saying he will be with us before\nthe blood shall run. We were overjoyed at that, and talked about it\nfar into the night; yet when dawn had come doubt again had hold of\nus, and I think I was the only Sikh in the regiment ready to swear\nto his integrity. Once, at least a squadron of us had loved him to\nthe death because we thought him an example of Sikh honor. Now only\nI and our British officers believed in him.\n\nWe are light cavalry. We were first of all the Indian regiments to\nride out of Delhi and entrain at a station down the line. That was\nan honor, and the other squadrons rode gaily, but D Squadron hung\nits head. I heard men muttering in the ranks and some I rebuked to\nsilence, but my rebukes lightened no man's heart. In place of\nRanjoor Singh rode Captain Fellowes, promoted from another squadron,\nand noticing our lack of spirit, he did his best to inspire us with\nfine words and manly bearing; but we felt ashamed that our own Sikh\nmajor was not leading us, and did not respond to encouragement.\n\nYet when we rode out of Delhi Gate it was as if a miracle took\nplace. A stiffening passed along the squadron. A trooper caught\nsight of Ranjoor Singh standing beside some bullock carts, and\npassed the word. I, too, saw him. He was with a Muhammadan bunnia,\nand was dressed to resemble one himself.\n\nThe trooper who was first to see him--a sharp-eyed man--he died at\nYpres--Singh means lion, sahib--now recognized the man who stood\nwith him. \"That bunnia,\" said he, \"is surely none other than the\nEuropean who gave us the newspaper clippings about Sikhs not allowed\nto land in Canada. See--he is disguised like a fool. Are the police\nasleep,\" said he, \"that such thieves dare sun themselves?\"\n\nIt was true enough, sahib. The man in disguise was German, and we\nremembered again that Ranjoor Singh knew German. From that moment we\nrode like new men--I, too, although I because I trusted Ranjoor\nSingh now more than ever; they, because they trusted no longer at\nall, and he can shoulder what seem certainties whom doubt unmans. No\nword, but a thought that a man could feel passed all down the line,\nthat whatever our officer might descend to being, the rank and file\nwould prove themselves faithful to the salt. Thenceforward there was\nnothing in our bearing to cause our officers anxiety.\n\nYou might wonder, sahib, why none broke ranks to expose both men on\nthe spot. I did not because I trusted Ranjoor Singh. I reasoned he\nwould never have dared be seen by us if he truly were a traitor. It\nseemed to me I knew how his heart must burn to be riding with us.\nThey did not because they would not willingly have borne the shame.\nI tell no secret when I say there has been treason in the Punjab;\nthe whole world knows that. Yet few understand that the cloak under\nwhich it all made headway was the pride of us true ones, who would\nnot own to treason in our midst. Pride and the shadow of shame are\none, sahib, but who believes it until the shame bears fruit?\n\nBefore the last squadron had ridden by, Captain Warrington, our\nadjutant, also caught sight of Ranjoor Singh. He spurred after\nColonel Kirby, and Colonel Kirby came galloping back; but before he\ncould reach Delhi Gate Ranjoor Singh had disappeared and D Squadron\nwas glad to the last man.\n\n\"Let us hope he may die like a rat in a hole and bring no more shame\non us!\" said Gooja Singh, and many assented.\n\n\"He said he will be with us before the blood shall run!\" said I.\n\n\"Then we know whose blood shall run first!\" said the trooper nearest\nme, and those who heard him laughed. So I held my tongue. There is\nno need of argument while a man yet lives to prove himself. I had\ncharge of the party that burned that trooper's body. He was one of\nthe first to fall after we reached France.\n\nColonel Kirby, looking none too pleased, came trotting back to us,\nand we rode on. And we entrained. Later on we boarded a great ship\nin Bombay harbor and put to sea, most of us thinking by that time of\nfamilies and children, and some no doubt of money-lenders who might\nforeclose on property in our absence, none yet suspecting that the\ngovernment will take steps to prevent that. It is not only the\nBritish officer, sahib, who borrows money at high interest lest his\nshabbiness shame the regiment.\n\nWe were at sea almost before the horses were stalled properly, and\npresently there were officers and men and horses all sick together\nin the belly of the ship, with chests and bales and barrels broken\nloose among us. The this-and-that-way motion of the ship caused\nhorses to fall down, and men were too sick to help them up again. I\nmyself lay amid dung like a dead man--yet vomiting as no dead man\never did--and saw British officers as sick as I laboring like\ntroopers. There are more reasons than one why we Sikhs respect our\nBritish officers.\n\nThe coverings of the ship were shut tight, lest the waves descend\namong us. The stench became worse than any I had ever known,\nalthough I learned to know a worse one later; but I will speak of\nthat at the proper time. It seemed to us like a poor beginning and\nthat thought put little heart in us.\n\nBut the sickness began to lessen after certain days, and as the\nmovements grew easier the horses were able to stand. Then we became\nhungry, who had thought we would never wish to eat again, and double\nrations were served out to compensate for days when we had eaten\nnothing. Then a few men sought the air, and others--I among them--went\nout of curiosity to see why the first did not return. So, first\nby dozens and then by hundreds, we went and stood full of wonder,\nholding to the bulwark for the sake of steadiness.\n\nIt may be, sahib, that if I had the tongue of a woman and of a\npriest and of an advocate--three tongues in one--I might then tell\nthe half of what there was to wonder at on that long journey. Surely\nnot otherwise. Being a soldier, well trained in all subjects\nbecoming to a horseman but slow of speech, I can not tell the\nhundredth part.\n\nWe--who had thought ourselves alone in all the sea--were but one\nship among a number. The ships proceeded after this manner--see, I\ndraw a pattern--with foam boiling about each. Ahead of us were many\nships bearing British troops--cavalry, infantry and guns. To our\nright and left and behind us were Sikh, Gurkha, Dogra, Pathan,\nPunjabi, Rajput--many, many men, on many ships. Two and thirty ships\nI counted at one time, and there was the smoke of others over the\nsky-line!\n\nAbove the bulwark of each ship, all the way along it, thus, was a\nline of khaki. Ahead of us that was helmets. To our right and left\nand behind us it was turbans. The men of each ship wondered at all\nthe others. And most of all, I think, we wondered at the great gray\nwar-ships plunging in the distance; for none knew whence they had\ncome; we saw none in Bombay when we started. It was not a sight for\nthe tongue to explain, sahib, but for a man to carry in his heart. A\nsight never to be forgotten. I heard no more talk about a poor\nbeginning.\n\nWe came to Aden, and stopped to take on coal and water. There was no\nsign of excitement there, yet no good news. It was put in Orders of\nthe Day that the Allies are doing as well as can be expected pending\narrival of re-enforcements; and that is not the way winners speak.\nLater, when we had left Aden behind, our officers came down among us\nand confessed that all did not go well. We said brave things to\nencourage them, for it is not good that one's officers should doubt.\nIf a rider doubts his horse, what faith shall the horse have in his\nrider? And so it is with a regiment and its officers.\n\nAfter some days we reached a narrow sea--the Red Sea, men call it,\nalthough God knows why--a place full of heat and sand-storms, shut\nin on either hand by barren hills. There was no green thing anywhere.\nThere we passed islands where men ran down to the beach to\nshout and wave helmets--unshaven Englishmen, who trim the lights. It\nmust have been their first intimation of any war. How else can they\nhave known of it? We roared back to them, all of the men on all of\nthe ships together, until the Red Sea was the home of thunder, and\nour ships' whistles screamed them official greeting through the din.\nI spent many hours wondering what those men's thoughts might be.\n\nNever was such a sight, sahib! Behind our ships was darkness, for\nthe wind was from the north and the funnels belched forth smoke that\ntrailed and spread. I watched it with fascination until one day\nGooja Singh came and watched beside me near the stern. His rank was\nthe same as mine, although I was more than a year his senior. There\nwas never too much love between us. Step by step I earned promotion\nfirst, and he was jealous. But on the face of thing's we were\nfriends. Said he to me after a long time of gazing at the smoke, \"I\nthink there is a curtain drawn. We shall never return by that road!\"\n\nI laughed at him. \"Look ahead!\" said I. \"Let us leave our rear to\nthe sweepers and the crows!\"\n\nNevertheless, what he had said remained in my mind, as the way of\ndark sayings is. Yet why should the word of a fool have the weight\nof truth? There are things none can explain. He proved right in the\nend, but gained nothing. Behold me; and where is Gooja Singh? I made\nno prophecy, and he did. Can the sahib explain?\n\nDay after day we kept overtaking other ships, most of them hurrying\nthe same way as ourselves. Not all were British, but the crews all\ncheered us, and we answered, the air above our heads alive with\nwaving arms and our trumpets going as if we rode to the king of\nEngland's wedding. If their hearts burned as ours did, the crews of\nthose ships were given something worth remembering.\n\nWe passed one British ship quite close, whose captain was an elderly\nman with a gray beard. He so waved his helmet that it slipped from\nhis grasp and went spinning into the sea. When we lost him in our\nsmoke his crew of Chinese were lowering a boat to recover the\nhelmet. We heard the ships behind us roaring to him. Strange that I\nshould wonder to this day whether those Chinese recovered the\nhelmet! It looked like a good new one. I have wondered about it on\nthe eve of action, and in the trenches, and in the snow on outpost\nduty. I wonder about it now. Can the sahib tell me why an old man's\nhelmet should be a memory, when so much that was matter of life and\ndeath has gone from mind? I see that old man and his helmet now, yet\nI forget the feel of Flanders mud.\n\nWe reached Suez, and anchored there. At Suez lay many ships in front\nof us, and a great gray battle-ship saluted us with guns, we all\nstanding to attention while our ensigns dipped. I thought it strange\nthat the battle-ship should salute us first, until I recalled how\nwhen I was a little fellow I once saw a viceroy salute my\ngrandfather. My grandfather was one of those Sikhs who marched to\nhelp the British on the Ridge at Delhi when the British cause seemed\nlost. The British have long memories for such things.\n\nLater there came an officer from the battle-ship and there was hot\nargument on our upper bridge. The captain of our ship grew very\nangry, but the officer from the battle-ship remained polite, and\npresently he took away with him certain of our stokers. The captain\nof our ship shouted after him that there were only weaklings and\ndevil's leavings left, but later we discovered that was not true.\n\nWe fretted at delay at Suez. Ships may only enter the canal one by\none, and while we waited some Arabs found their way on board from a\nsmall boat, pretending to sell fruit and trinkets. They assured us\nthat the French and British were already badly beaten, and that\nBelgium had ceased to be. To test them, we asked where Belgium was,\nand they did not know; but they swore it had ceased to be. They\nadvised us to mutiny and refuse to go on to our destruction.\n\nThey ought to have been arrested, but we were enraged and drove them\nfrom the ship with blows. We upset their little boat by hauling at\nthe rope with which they had made it fast, and they were forced to\nswim for shore. One of them was taken by a shark, which we\nconsidered an excellent omen, and the others were captured as they\nswam and taken ashore in custody.\n\nI think others must have visited the other ships with similar tales\nto tell, because after that, sahib, there was something such as I\nthink the world never saw before that day. In that great fleet of\nships we were men of many creeds and tongues--Sikh, Muhammadan,\nDorga, Gurkha (the Dogra and Gurkha be both Hindu, though of\ndifferent kinds), Jat, Punjabi, Rajput, Guzerati, Pathan, Mahratta--who\ncan recall how many! No one language could have sufficed to\nexplain one thought to all of us--no, nor yet ten languages! No word\npassed that my ear caught. Yet, ship after ship became aware of\ncloser unity.\n\nAll on our knees on all the ships together we prayed thereafter\nthrice a day, our British officers standing bareheaded beneath the\nupper awnings, the chin-strap marks showing very plainly on their\ncheeks as the way of the British is when they feel emotion. We\nprayed, sahib, lest the war be over before we could come and do our\nshare. I think there was no fear in all that fleet except the fear\nlest we come too late. A man might say with truth that we prayed to\nmore gods than one, but our prayer was one. And we received one\nanswer.\n\nOne morning our ship got up anchor unexpectedly and began to enter\nthe canal ahead of all the ships bearing Indian troops. The men on\nthe other ships bayed to us like packs of wolves, in part to give\nencouragement but principally jealous. We began to expect to see\nFrance now at any minute--I, who can draw a map of the world and set\nthe chief cities in the proper place, being as foolish as the rest.\nThere lay work as well as distance between us and France.\n\nWe began to pass men laboring to make the canal banks ready against\nattack, but mostly they had no news to give us. Yet at one place,\nwhere we tied to the bank because of delay ahead, a man shouted from\na sand-dune that the kaiser of Germany has turned Muhammadan and now\nsummons all Islam to destroy the French and British. Doubtless he\nmistook us for Muhammadans, being neither the first nor the last to\nmake that mistake.\n\nSo we answered him we were on our way to Berlin to teach the kaiser\nhis new creed. One man threw a lump of coal at him and he\ndisappeared, but presently we heard him shouting to the men on the\nship behind. They truly were Muhammadans, but they jeered at him as\nloud as we.\n\nAfter that our officers set us to leading horses up and down the\ndeck in relays, partly, no doubt, to keep us from talking with other\nmen on shore, but also for the horses' sake. I remember how flies\ncame on board and troubled the horses very much. At sea we had\nforgotten there were such things as flies, and they left us again\nwhen we left the canal.\n\nAt Port Said, which looks like a mean place, we stopped again for\ncoal. Naked Egyptians--big black men, as tall as I and as\nstraight--carried it up an inclined plank from a float and cast it by\nbasketfuls through openings in the ship's side. We made up a purse\nof money for them, both officers and men contributing, and I was\ntold there was a coaling record broken.\n\nAfter that we steamed at great speed along another sea, one ship at\na time, just as we left the canal, our ship leading all those that\nbore Indian troops. And now there were other war-ships--little ones,\neach of many funnels--low in the water, yet high at the nose--most\nswift, that guarded us on every hand, coming and going as the sharks\ndo when they search the seas for food.\n\nA wonder of a sight, sahib! Blue water--blue water--bluest ever I\nsaw, who have seen lake water in the Hills! And all the ships\nbelching black smoke, and throwing up pure white foam--and the last\nship so far behind that only masts and smoke were visible above the\nsky-line--but more, we knew, behind that again, and yet more coming!\nI watched for hours at a stretch without weariness, and thought\nagain of Ranjoor Singh. Surely, thought I, his three campaigns\nentitled him to this. Surely he was a better man than I. Yet here\nwas I, and no man knew where he was. But when I spoke of Ranjoor\nSingh men spat, so I said nothing.\n\nAfter a time I begged leave to descend an iron ladder to the bowels\nof the ship, and I sat on the lowest rung watching the British\nfiremen at the furnaces. They cursed me in the name of God, their\nteeth and the whites of their eyes gleaming, but their skin black as\nnight with coal dust. The sweat ran down in rivers between ridges of\ngrime on the skin of their naked bellies. When a bell rang and the\nfire doors opened they glowed like pictures I have seen of devils.\nThey were shadows when the doors clanged shut again. Considering\nthem, I judged that they and we were one.\n\nI climbed on deck again and spoke to a risaldar. He spoke to Colonel\nKirby. Watching from below, I saw Colonel Kirby nod--thus, like a\nbird that takes an insect; and he went and spoke to the captain of\nthe ship. Presently there was consultation, and a call for\nvolunteers. The whole regiment responded. None, however, gave me\ncredit for the thought. I think that risaldar accepted praise for\nit, but I have had no opportunity to ask him. He died in Flanders.\n\nWe went down and carried coal as ants that build a hill, piling it\non the iron floor faster than the stokers could use it, toiling\nnearly naked like them lest we spoil our uniforms. We grew grimy,\nbut the ship shook, and the water boiled behind us. None of the\nother ships was able to overtake us, although we doubted not they\nall tried.\n\nThere grew great good will between us and the stokers. We were\nclumsy from inexperience, and they full of laughter at us, but each\njudged the spirit with which the other labored. Once, where I stood\ndirecting near the bunker door, two men fell on me and covered me\nwith coal. The stokers laughed and I was angry. I had hot words\nready on my tongue, but a risaldar prevented me.\n\n\"This is their trade, not ours,\" said he. \"Look to it lest any laugh\nat us when the time for our own trade comes!\" I judged that well\nspoken, and remembered it.\n\nThere came at last a morning when the sun shone through jeweled\nmist--a morning with scent in it that set the horses in the hold to\nsnorting--a dawn that smiled, as if the whole universe in truth were\nGod's. A dawn, sahib, such as a man remembers to judge other dawns\nby. That day we came in sight of France.\n\nDoubtless you suppose we cheered when we saw Marseilles at last. Yet\nI swear to you we were silent. We were disappointed because we could\nsee no enemy and hear no firing of great guns! We made no more\ncommotion than the dead while our ship steamed down the long harbor\nentrance, and was pushed and pulled by little tugs round a corner to\na wharf. A French war-ship and some guns in a fort saluted us, and\nour ship answered; but on shore there seemed no excitement and our\nhearts sank. We thought that for all our praying we had come too\nlate.\n\nBut the instant they raised the gangway a French officer and several\nBritish officers came running up it, and they all talked earnestly\nwith Colonel Kirby on the upper bridge--we watching as if we had but\nan eye and an ear between us. Presently all our officers were\nsummoned and told the news, and without one word being said to any\nof us we knew there was neither peace as yet, nor any surpassing\nvictory fallen to our side. So then instantly we all began to speak\nat once, even as apes do when sudden fear has passed.\n\nThere were whole trains of trucks drawn up in the street beside the\ndock and we imagined we were to be hurried at once toward the\nfighting. But not so, for the horses needed rest and exercise and\nproper food before they could be fit to carry us. Moreover, there\nwere stores to be offloaded from the ships, we having brought with\nus many things that it would not be so easy to replace in a land at\nwar. Whatever our desire, we were forced to wait, and when we had\nleft the ship we were marched through the streets to a camp some\nlittle distance out along the Estagus Road. Later in the day, and\nthe next day, and the next, infantry from the other ships followed\nus, for they, too, had to wait for their stores to be offloaded.\n\nThe French seemed surprised to see us. They were women and children\nfor the most part, for the grown men had been called up. In our\ncountry we greet friends with flowers, but we had been led to\nbelieve that Europe thinks little of such manners. Yet the French\nthrew flowers to us, the little children bringing arms full and\nbaskets full.\n\nThenceforward, day after day, we rode at exercise, keeping ears and\neyes open, and marveling at France. No man complained, although our\nvery bones ached to be on active service. And no man spoke of\nRanjoor Singh, who should have led D Squadron. Yet I believe there\nwas not one man in all D Squadron but thought of Ranjoor Singh all\nthe time. He who has honor most at heart speaks least about it. In\none way shame on Ranjoor Singh's account was a good thing, for it\nmade the whole regiment watchful against treachery.\n\nTreachery, sahib--we had yet to learn what treachery could be!\nMarseilles is a half-breed of a place, part Italian, part French.\nThe work was being chiefly done by the Italians, now that all\nable-bodied Frenchmen were under arms. And Italy not yet in the war!\n\nSahib, I swear to you that all the spies in all the world seemed at\nthat moment to be Italian, and all in Marseilles at once! There were\nspies among the men who brought our stores. Spies who brought the\nhay. Spies among the women who walked now and then through our lines\nto admire, accompanied by officers who were none too wide-awake if\nthey were honest. You would not believe how many pamphlets reached\nus, printed in our tongue and some of them worded very cunningly.\n\nThere were men who could talk Hindustanee who whispered to us to\nsurrender to the Germans at the first opportunity, promising in that\ncase that we shall be well treated. The German kaiser, these men\nassured us, had truly turned Muhammadan; as if that were anything to\nSikhs, unless perhaps an additional notch against him! I was told\nthey mistook the Muhammadans in another camp for Sikhs, and were\nspat on for their pains!\n\nNor were all the spies Italians, after all. Our hearts went out to\nthe French. We were glad to be on their side--glad to help them\ndefend their country. I shall be glad to my dying day that I have\nstruck a blow for France. Yet the only really dangerous man of all\nwho tried to corrupt us in Marseilles was a French officer of the\nrank of major, who could speak our tongue as well as I. He said with\nsorrow that the French were already as good as vanquished, and that\nhe pitied us as lambs sent to the slaughter. The part, said he, of\nevery wise man was to go over to the enemy before the day should\ncome for paying penalties.\n\nI told what he had said to me to a risaldar, and the risaldar spoke\nwith Colonel Kirby. We heard--although I do not know whether it is\ntrue or not--that the major was shot that evening with his face to a\nwall. I do know that I, in company with several troopers, was\ncross-examined by interpreters that day in presence of Colonel Kirby and a\nFrench general and some of the general's staff.\n\nThere began to be talk at last about Ranjoor Singh. I heard men say\nit was no great wonder, after all, that he should have turned\ntraitor, for it was plain he must have been tempted cunningly. Yet\nthere was no forgiveness for him. They grew proud that where he had\nfailed they could stand firm; and there is no mercy in proud men's\nminds--nor much wisdom either.\n\nAt last a day came--too soon for the horses, but none too soon for\nus--when we marched through the streets to entrain for the front. As\nwe had marched first out of Delhi, so we marched first from\nMarseilles now. Only the British regiments from India were on ahead\nof us; we led the Indian-born contingent.\n\nFrench wives and children, and some cripples, lined the streets to\ncheer and wave their handkerchiefs. We were on our way to help their\nhusbands defend France, and they honored us. It was our due. But can\nthe sahib accept his due with a dry eye and a word in his throat?\nNay! It is only ingratitude that a man can swallow unconcerned. No\nman spoke. We rode like graven images, and I think the French women\nwondered at our silence. I know that I, for one, felt extremely\nwilling to die for France; and I thought of Ranjoor Singh and of how\nhis heart, too, would have burned if he had been with us. With such\nthoughts as swelled in my own breast, it was not in me to believe\nhim false, whatever the rest might think.\n\nD Squadron proved in good fortune that day, for they gave us a train\nof passenger coaches with seats, and our officers had a first-class\ncoach in front. The other squadrons, and most of the other\nregiments, had to travel in open trucks, although I do not think any\ngrumbled on that score. There was a French staff officer to each\ntrain, and he who rode in our train had an orderly who knew English;\nthe orderly climbed in beside me and we rode miles together, talking\nall the time, he surprising me vastly more than I him. We exchanged\ninformation as two boys that play a game--I a move, then he a move,\nthen I again, then he.\n\nThe game was at an end when neither could think of another question\nto ask; but he learned more than I. At the end I did not yet know\nwhat his religion was, but he knew a great deal about mine. On the\nother hand, he told me all about their army and its close\nassociation between officers and men, and all the news he had about\nthe fighting (which was not so very much), and what he thought of\nthe British. He seemed to think very highly of the British, rather\nto his own surprise.\n\nHe told me he was a pastry cook by trade, and said he could cook\nchapatties such as we eat; and he understood my explanation why\nSikhs were riding in the front trains and Muhammadans behind--because\nMuhammadans must pray at fixed intervals and the trains must\nstop to let them do it. He understood wherein our Sikh prayer\ndiffers from that of Islam. Yet he refused to believe I am no\npolygamist. But that is nothing. Since then I have fought in a\ntrench beside Englishmen who spoke of me as a savage; and I have\nseen wounded Germans writhe and scream because their officers had\ntold them we Sikhs would eat them alive. Yes, sahib; not once, but\nmany times.\n\nThe journey was slow, for the line ahead of us was choked with\nsupply trains, some of which were needed at the front as badly as\nourselves. Now and then trains waited on sidings to let us by, and\nby that means we became separated from the other troop trains, our\nregiment leading all the others in the end by almost half a day. The\ndin of engine whistles became so constant that we no longer noticed\nit.\n\nBut there was another din that did not grow familiar. Along the line\nnext ours there came hurrying in the opposite direction train after\ntrain of wounded, traveling at great speed, each leaving a smell in\nits wake that set us all to spitting. And once in so often there\ncame a train filled full of the sound of screaming. The first time,\nand the second time we believed it was ungreased axles, but after\nthe third time we understood.\n\nThen our officers came walking along the footboards, speaking to us\nthrough the windows and pretending to point out characteristics of\nthe scenery; and we took great interest in the scenery, asking them\nthe names of places and the purposes of things, for it is not good\nthat one's officers should be other than arrogantly confident.\n\nWe were a night and a day, and a night and a part of a day on the\njourney, and men told us later we had done well to cross the length\nof France in that time, considering conditions. On the morning of\nthe last day we began almost before it was light to hear the firing\nof great guns and the bursting of shells--like the thunder of the\nsurf on Bombay Island in the great monsoon--one roar without\nintermission, yet full of pulsation.\n\nI think it was midday when we drew up at last on a siding, where a\nFrench general waited with some French and British officers. Colonel\nKirby left the train and spoke with the general, and then gave the\norder for us to detrain at once; and we did so very swiftly, men,\nand horses, and baggage. Many of us were men of more than one\ncampaign, able to judge by this and by that how sorely we were\nneeded. We knew what it means when the reenforcements look fit for\nthe work in hand. The French general came and shook hands again with\nColonel Kirby, and saluted us all most impressively.\n\nWe were spared all the business of caring for our own baggage and\nsent away at once. With a French staff officer to guide us, we rode\naway at once toward the sound of firing--at a walk, because within\nreasonable limits the farther our horses might be allowed to walk\nnow the better they would be able to gallop with us later.\n\nWe rode along a road between straight trees, most of them scarred by\nshell-fire. There were shell-holes in the road, some of which had\nbeen filled with the first material handy, but some had to be\navoided. We saw no dead bodies, nor even dead horses, although\nsmashed gun-carriages and limbers and broken wagons were everywhere.\n\nTo our right and left was flat country, divided by low hedges and\nthe same tall straight trees; but far away in front was a forest,\nwhose top just rose above the sky-line. As we rode toward that we\ncould see the shells bursting near it.\n\nBetween us and the forest there were British guns, dug in; and away\nto our right were French guns--batteries and batteries of them. And\nbetween us and the guns were great receiving stations for the\nwounded, with endless lines of stretcher-bearers like ants passing\nto and fro. By the din we knew that the battle stretched far away\nbeyond sight to right and left of us.\n\nMany things we saw that were unexpected. The speed of the artillery\nfire was unbelievable. But what surprised all of us most was the\nabsence of reserves. Behind the guns and before the guns we passed\nmany a place where reserves might have sheltered, but there were\nnone.\n\nThere came two officers, one British and one French, galloping\ntoward us. They spoke excitedly with Colonel Kirby and our French\nstaff officer, but we continued at a walk and Colonel Kirby lit a\nfresh cheroot. After some time there came an aeroplane with a great\nsquare cross painted on its under side, and we were ordered to halt\nand keep quite still until it went away. When it was too far away\nfor its man to distinguish us we began to trot at last, but it was\ngrowing dusk when we halted finally behind the forest--dusky and\ncloudy, the air full of smoke from the explosions, ill-smelling and\ndifficult to breathe. During the last three-quarters of a mile the\nshells had been bursting all about us, but we had only lost one man\nand a horse--and the man not killed.\n\nAs it grew darker the enemy sent up star-shells, and by their light\nwe could sometimes see as plainly as by daylight. British infantry\nwere holding the forest in front of us and a road that ran to right\nof it. Their rifle-fire was steady as the roll of drums. These were\nnot the regiments that preceded us from India; they had been sent to\nanother section of the battle. These were men who had been in the\nfighting from the first, and their wounded and the stretcher-bearers\nwere surprised to see us. No word of our arrival seemed to reach the\nfiring line as yet. Men were too busy to pass news.\n\nOver our heads from a mile away, the British and French artillery\nwere sending a storm, of shells, and the enemy guns were answering\ntwo for one. And besides that, into the forest, and into the trench\nto the right of it that was being held by the British infantry there\nwas falling such a cataract of fire that it was not possible to\nbelieve a man could live. Yet the answering rifle-fire never paused\nfor a second.\n\nI learned afterward the name of the regiment in the end of the\ntrench nearest us. With these two eyes in the Hills I once saw that\nsame regiment run like a thousand hares into the night, because it\nhad no supper and a dozen Afridi marksmen had the range. Can the\nsahib explain? I think I can. A man's spirit is no more in his belly\nthan in the cart that carries his belongings; yet, while he thinks\nit is, his enemies all flourish.\n\nWe dismounted to rest the horses, and waited behind the forest until\nit grew so dark that between the bursting of the star-shells a man\ncould not see his hand held out in front of him. Now and then a\nstray shell chanced among us, but our casualties were very few. I\nwondered greatly at the waste of ammunition. My ears ached with the\ndin, but there seemed more noise wrought than destruction. We had\nbegun to grow restless when an officer came galloping at last to\nColonel Kirby's side and gave him directions with much pointing and\nwaving of the arm.\n\nThen Colonel Kirby summoned all our officers, and they rode back to\ntell us what the plan was. The din was so great by this time that\nthey were obliged to explain anew to each four men in turn. This was\nthe plan:\n\nThe Germans, ignorant of our arrival, undoubtedly believed the\nBritish infantry to be without support and were beginning to press\nforward in the hope of winning through to the railway line. The\ninfantry on our right front, already overwhelmed by weight of\nartillery fire, would be obliged to evacuate their trench and fall\nback, thus imperiling the whole line, unless we could save the day.\n\nObserve this, sahib: so--I make a drawing in the dust. Between the\ntrench here, and the forest there, was a space of level ground some\nfifty or sixty yards wide. There was scarcely more than a furrow\nacross it to protect the riflemen--nothing at all that could stop a\nhorse. At a given signal the infantry were to draw aside from that\npiece of level land, like a curtain drawn back along a rod, and we\nwere to charge through the gap thus made between them and the\nforest. The shock of our charge and its unexpectedness were to serve\ninstead of numbers.\n\nFine old-fashioned tactics, sahib, that suited our mind well! There\nhad been plenty on the voyage, including Gooja Singh, who argued we\nshould all be turned into infantry as soon as we arrived, and we had\ndreaded that. Each to his own. A horseman prefers to fight on\nhorseback with the weapons that he knows.\n\nPerhaps the sahib has watched Sikh cavalry at night and wondered how\nso many men and horses could keep so still. We had made but little\nnoise hitherto, but now our silence was that of night itself. We had\nbut one eye, one ear, one intellect among us. We were one! One with\nthe night and with the work ahead!\n\nOne red light swinging near the corner of the forest was to mean BE\nREADY! We were ready as the fuse is for the match! Two red lights\nwould mean that the sidewise movement by the infantry was under way.\nThree lights swinging together were to be our signal to begin.\nSahib, I saw three red lights three thousand times between each\nminute and the next!\n\nThe shell-fire increased from both sides. Where the British infantry\nlay was such a lake of flame and din that the very earth seemed to\nburst apart; yet the answering rifle-fire was steady--steady as the\nroll of drums. Then we truly saw one red light, and \"EK!\" said we\nall at once. EK means ONE, sahib, but it sounded like the opening of\na breech-block. \"Mount!\" ordered Colonel Kirby, and we mounted.\n\nWhile I held my breath and watched for the second light I heard a\nnew noise behind me, different from the rest, and therefore audible--a\ngalloping horse and a challenge close at hand. I saw in the light\nof a bursting shell a Sikh officer, close followed by a trooper on a\nblown horse. I saw the officer ride to Colonel Kirby's side, rein in\nhis charger, and salute. At that instant there swung two red lights,\nand \"DO!\" said the regiment. DO means TWO, sahib, but it sounded\nlike the thump of ordnance. \"Draw sabers!\" commanded Colonel Kirby,\nand the rear ranks drew. The front-rank men had lances.\n\nBy the light of a star-shell I could plainly see the Sikh officer\nand trooper. I recognized the charger--a beast with the devil in him\nand the speed of wind. I recognized both men. I thought a shell must\nhave struck me. I must be dead and in a new world. I let my horse\nedge nearer, not believing--until ears confirmed eyes. I heard\nColonel Kirby speak, very loud, indeed, as a man to whom good news\ncomes.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh!\" said he; and he took him by the hand and wrung it.\n\"Thank God!\" he said, speaking from the heart as the British do at\ntimes when they forget that others listen. \"Thank God, old man!\nYou've come in the nick of time!\"\n\nSo I was right, and my heart leapt in me. He was with us before the\nblood ran! Every man in the squadron recognized him now, and I knew\nevery eye had watched to see Colonel Kirby draw saber and cut him\ndown, for habit of thought is harder to bend than a steel bar. But I\ncould feel the squadron coming round to my way of thinking as\nColonel Kirby continued talking to him, obviously making him an\nexplanation of our plan.\n\n\"Join your squadron, man--hurry!\" I heard Colonel Kirby say at last,\nfor taking advantage of the darkness I had let my horse draw very\nnear to them. Now I had to rein back and make pretense that my horse\nhad been unruly, for Ranjoor Singh came riding toward us, showing\nhis teeth in a great grin, and Captain Fellowes with a word of\nreproof thrown back to me spurred on to meet him.\n\n\"Hurrah, Major Ranjoor Singh!\" said Captain Fellowes. \"I'm damned\nglad to see you!\" That was a generous speech, sahib, from a man who\nmust now yield command of the squadron, but Captain Fellowes had a\nheart like a bridegroom's always. He must always glory in the\nsquadron's luck, and he loved us better than himself. That was why\nwe loved him. They shook hands, and looked in each other's eyes.\nRanjoor Singh wheeled his charger. And in that same second we all\ntogether saw three red lights swinging by the corner.\n\n\"TIN!\" said we, with one voice. Tin means three, sahib, but it\nsounded rather like the scream of a shell that leaves on its\njourney.\n\nMy horse laid his ears back and dug his toes into the ground. A\ntrumpet sounded, and Colonel Kirby rose in his stirrups:\n\n\"Outram's Own!\" he yelled, \"by squadrons on number One--\"\n\nBut the sahib would not be interested in the sequence of commands\nthat have small meaning to those not familiar with them. And who\nshall describe what followed? Who shall tell the story of a charge\ninto the night, at an angle, into massed regiments of infantry\nadvancing one behind another at the double and taken by surprise?\n\nThe guns of both sides suddenly ceased firing. Even as I used my\nspurs they ceased. How? Who am I that I should know? The British\nguns, I suppose, from fear of slaying us, and the German guns from\nfear of slaying Germans; but as to how, I know not. But the German\nstar-shells continued bursting overhead, and by that weird light\ntheir oncoming infantry saw charging into them men they had never\nseen before out of a picture-book!\n\nGod knows what tales they had been told about us Sikhs. I read their\nfaces as I rode. Fear is an ugly weapon, sahib, whose hilt is more\ndangerous than its blade. If our officers had told us such tales\nabout Germans as their officers had told them about us, I think\nperhaps we might have feared to charge.\n\nNumbers were as nothing that night. Speed, and shock, and\nunexpectedness were ours, and lies had prepared us our reception. D\nSquadron rode behind Ranjoor Singh like a storm in the night--swung\ninto line beside the other squadrons--and spurred forward as in a\ndream. There was no shouting; no war-cry. We rode into the Germans\nas I have seen wind cut into a forest in the hills--downward into\nthem, for once we had leapt the trench the ground sloped their way.\nAnd they went down before us as we never had the chance of mowing\nthem again.\n\nSo, sahib, we proved our hearts--whether they were stout, and true,\nas the British had believed, or false, as the Germans planned and\nhoped. That was a night of nights--one of very few such, for the\nmounted actions in this war have not been many. Hah! I have been\nenvied! I have been called opprobrious names by a sergeant of\nBritish lancers, out of great jealousy! But that is the way of the\nBritish. It happened later, when the trench fighting had settled\ndown in earnest and my regiment and his were waiting our turn behind\nthe lines. He and I sat together on a bench in a great tent, where\nsome French artists gave us good entertainment.\n\nHe offered me tobacco, which I do not use, and rum, which I do not\ndrink. He accepted sweetmeats from me. And he called me a name that\nwould make the sahib gulp, a word that I suppose he had picked up\nfrom a barrack-sweeper on the Bengal side of India. Then he slapped\nme on the back, and after that sat with his arm around me while the\nentertainment lasted. When we left the tent he swore roundly at a\nnewcomer to the front for not saluting me, who am not entitled to\nsalute. That is the way of the British. But I was speaking of\nRanjoor Singh. Forgive me, sahib.\n\nThe horse his trooper-servant rode was blown and nearly useless, so\nthat the trooper died that night for lack of a pair of heels,\nleaving us none to question as to Ranjoor Singh's late doings. But\nBagh, Ranjoor Singh's charger, being a marvel of a beast whom few\ncould ride but he, was fresh enough and Ranjoor Singh led us like a\nwhirlwind beckoning a storm. I judged his heart was on fire. He led\nus slantwise into a tight-packed regiment. We rolled it over, and he\ntook us beyond that into another one. In the dark he re-formed us\n(and few but he could have done that then)--lined us up again with\nthe other squadrons--and brought us back by the way we had come.\nThen he took us the same road a second time against remnants of the\nmen who had withstood us and into yet another regiment that checked\nand balked beyond. The Germans probably believed us ten times as\nmany as we truly were, for that one setback checked their advance\nalong the whole line.\n\nColonel Kirby led us, but I speak of Ranjoor Singh. I never once saw\nColonel Kirby until the fight was over and we were back again\nresting our horses behind the trees while the roll was called.\nThroughout the fight--and I have no idea whatever how long it\nlasted--I kept an eye on Ranjoor Singh and spurred in his wake,\nobeying the least motion of his saber. No, sahib, I myself did not\nslay many men. It is the business of a non-commissioned man like me\nto help his officers keep control, and I did what I might. I was\nnearly killed by a wounded German officer who seized my bridle-rein;\nbut a trooper's lance took him in the throat and I rode on\nuntouched. For all I know that was the only danger I was in that\nnight.\n\nA battle is a strange thing, sahib--like a dream. A man only knows\nsuch part of it as crosses his own vision, and remembers but little\nof that. What he does remember seldom tallies with what the others\nsaw. Talk with twenty of our regiment, and you may get twenty\ndifferent versions of what took place--yet not one man would have\nlied to you, except perhaps here and there a little in the matter of\nhis own accomplishment. Doubtless the Germans have a thousand\ndifferent accounts of it.\n\nI know this, and the world knows it: that night the Germans melted.\nThey were. Then they broke into parties and were not. We pursued\nthem as they ran. Suddenly the star-shells ceased from bursting\noverhead, and out of black darkness I heard Colonel Kirby's voice\nthundering an order. Then a trumpet blared. Then I heard Ranjoor\nSingh's voice, high-pitched. Almost the next I knew we were halted\nin the shadow of the trees again, calling low to one another,\nfriend's voice seeking friend's. We could scarcely hear the voices\nfor the thunder of artillery that had begun again; and whereas\nformerly the German gun-fire had been greatest, now we thought the\nBritish and French fire had the better of it. They had been re-enforced,\nbut I have no notion whence.\n\nThe infantry, that had drawn aside like a curtain to let us through,\nhad closed in again to the edge of the forest, and through the noise\nof rifle-firing and artillery we caught presently the thunder of new\nregiments advancing at the double. Thousands of our Indian infantry--those\nwho had been in the trains behind us--were coming forward at\na run! God knows that was a night--to make a man glad he has lived!\n\nIt was not only the Germans who had not expected us. Now, sahib, for\nthe first time the British infantry began to understand who it was\nwho had come to their aid, and they began to sing--one song, all\ntogether. The wounded sang it, too, and the stretcher-bearers. There\ncame a day when we had our own version of that song, but that night\nit was new to us. We only caught a few words--the first words. The\nsahib knows the words--the first few words? It was true we had come\na long, long way; but it choked us into silence to hear that\nbattered infantry acknowledge it.\n\nColor and creed, sahib. What are color and creed? The world has\nmistaken us Sikhs too long for a breed it can not understand. We\nSikhs be men, with the hearts of men; and that night we knew that\nour hearts and theirs were one. Nor have I met since then the fire\nthat could destroy the knowledge, although efforts have been made,\nand reasons shown me.\n\nBut my story is of Ranjoor Singh and of what he did. I but tell my\nown part to throw more light on his. What I did is as nothing. Of\nwhat he did, you shall be the judge--remembering this, that he who\ndoes, and he who glories in the deed are one. Be attentive, sahib;\nthis is a tale of tales!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nCan the die fall which side up it will? Nay, not if it be\nhonest.--EASTERN PROVERB.\n\n\nMany a league our infantry advanced that night, the guns following,\ngetting the new range by a miracle each time they took new ground.\nWe went forward, too, at the cost of many casualties--too many in\nproportion to the work we did. We were fired on in the darkness more\nthan once by our own infantry. We, who had lost but seventy-two men\nkilled and wounded in the charge, were short another hundred when\nthe day broke and nothing to the good by it.\n\nGetting lost in the dark--falling into shell-holes--swooping down on\nrear-guards that generally proved to have machine guns with them--weary\nmen on hungrier, wearier horses--the wonder is that a man rode\nback to tell of it at dawn.\n\nOne-hundred-and-two-and-seventy were our casualties, and some two\nhundred horses--some of the men so lightly wounded that they were\nback in the ranks within the week. At dawn they sent us to the rear\nto rest, we being too good a target for the enemy by daylight. Some\nof us rode two to a horse. On our way to the camp the French had\npitched for us we passed through reenforcements coming from another\nsection of the front, who gave us the right of way, and we took the\nsalute of two divisions of French infantry who, I suppose, had been\ntold of the service we had rendered. Said I to Gooja Singh, who sat\non my horse's rump, his own beast being disemboweled, \"Who speaks\nnow of a poor beginning?\" said I.\n\n\"I would rather see the end!\" said he. But he never saw the end.\nGooja Singh was ever too impatient of beginnings, and too sure what\nthe end ought to be, to make certain of the middle part. I have\nknown men on outpost duty so far-seeing that an enemy had them at\nhis mercy if only he could creep close enough. And such men are\nalways grumblers.\n\nGooja Singh led the grumbling now--he who had been first to prophesy\nhow we should be turned into infantry. They kept us at the rear, and\ntook away our horses--took even our spurs, making us drill with\nunaccustomed weapons. And I think that the beginning of the new\ndistrust of Ranjoor Singh was in resentment at his patience with the\nbayonet drill. We soldiers are like women, sahib, ever resentful of\nthe new--aye, like women in more ways than one; for whom we have\nloved best we hate most when the change comes.\n\nOnce, at least a squadron of us had loved Ranjoor Singh to the\ndeath. He was a Sikh of Sikhs. It had been our boast that fire could\nnot burn his courage nor love corrupt him, and I was still of that\nmind; but not so the others. They began to remember how he had\nstayed behind when we left India. We had all seen him in disguise,\nin conversation with that German by the Delhi Gate. We knew how busy\nhe had been in the bazaars while the rumors flew. And the trooper\nwho had stayed behind with him, who had joined us with him at the\nvery instant of the charge that night, died in the charge; so that\nthere was none to give explanation of his conduct. Ranjoor Singh\nhimself was a very rock for silence. Our British officers said\nnothing, doubtless not suspecting the distrust; for it was a byword\nthat Ranjoor Singh held the honor of the squadron in his hand. Yet\nof all the squadron only the officers and I now trusted him--the\nSikh officers because they imitated the British; the British because\nfaith is a habit with them, once pledged, and I--God knows. There\nwere hours when I did distrust him--black hours, best forgotten.\n\nThe war settled down into a siege of trenches, and soon we were\ngiven a section of a trench to hold. Little by little we grew wise\nat the business of tossing explosives over blind banks--we, who\nwould rather have been at it with the lance and saber. Yet, can a\ndie fall which side up it will? Nay, not if it be honest! We were\nthere to help. We who had carried coal could shovel mud, and as time\nwent on we grumbled less.\n\nBut time hung heavy, and curiosity regarding Ranjoor Singh led from\none conjecture to another. At last Gooja Singh asked Captain\nFellowes, and he said that Ranjoor Singh had stayed behind to expose\na German plot--that having done so, he had hurried after us. That\nexplanation ought to have satisfied every one, and I think it did\nfor a time. But who could hide from such a man as Ranjoor Singh that\nthe squadron's faith in him was gone? That knowledge made him\nsavage. How should we know that he had been forbidden to tell us\nwhat had kept him? When he set aside his pride and made us\novertures, there was no response; so his heart hardened in him.\nSecrecy is good. Secrecy is better than all the lame explanations in\nthe world. But in this war there has been too much secrecy in the\nwrong place. They should have let him line us up and tell us his\nwhole story. But later, when perhaps he might have done it, either\nhis pride was too great or his sense of obedience too tightly spun.\nTo this day he has never told us. Not that it matters.\n\nThe subtlest fool is the worst, and Gooja Singh's tongue did not\nlack subtlety on occasion. He made it his business to remind the\nsquadron daily of its doubts, and I, who should have known better,\nlaughed at some of the things he said and agreed with others. One is\nthe fool who speaks with him who listens. I have never been rebuked\nfor it by Ranjoor Singh, and more than once since that day he has\nseen fit to praise me; but in that hour when most he needed friends\nI became his half-friend, which is worse than enemy. I never raised\nmy voice once in defense of him in those days.\n\nMeanwhile Ranjoor Singh grew very wise at this trench warfare,\nColonel Kirby and the other British officers taking great comfort in\nhis cunning. It was he who led us to tie strings to the German wire\nentanglements, which we then jerked from our trench, causing them to\nlie awake and waste much ammunition. It was he who thought of\ndressing turbans on the end of poles and thrusting them forward at\nthe hour before dawn when fear and chill and darkness have done\ntheir worst work. That started a panic that cost the Germans eighty\nmen.\n\nI think his leadership would have won the squadron back to love him.\nI know it saved his life. We had all heard tales of how the British\nsoldiers in South Africa made short work of the officers they did\nnot love, and it would have been easy to make an end of Ranjoor\nSingh on any dark night. But he led too well; men were afraid to\ntake the responsibility lest the others turn on them. One night I\noverheard two troopers considering the thought, and they suspected I\nhad overheard. I said nothing, but they were afraid, as I knew they\nwould be. Has the sahib ever heard of \"left-hand casualties\"? I will\nexplain.\n\nWe Sikhs have a saying that in fear there is no wisdom. None can be\nwise and afraid. None can be afraid and wise. The men at the front,\nboth Indian and British-French, too, for aught I know--who feared to\nfight longer in the trenches were seized in those early days with\nthe foolish thought of inflicting some injury on themselves--not\nvery severe, but enough to cause a spell of absence at the base and\na rest in hospital. Folly being the substance of that idea, and most\nmen being right-handed, such self-inflicted wounds were practically\nalways in the hand or foot and always on the left side. The\nambulance men knew them, on the instant.\n\nThose two fools of my squadron wounded themselves with bullets in\nthe left hand, forgetting that their palms would be burned by the\ndischarge. I was sent to the rear to give evidence against them (for\nI saw them commit the foolishness). The cross-examination we all\nthree underwent was clever--at the hands of a young British captain,\nwho, I dare swear, was suckled by a Sikh nurse in the Punjab. In\nless than thirty minutes he had the whole story out of us; and the\ntwo troopers were shot that evening for an example.\n\nThat young captain was greatly impressed with the story we had told\nabout Ranjoor Singh, and he called me back afterward and asked me a\nhundred questions more--until he must have known the very color of\nmy entrails and I knew not which way I faced. To all of this a\nsenior officer of the Intelligence Department listened with both\nears, and presently he and the captain talked together.\n\nThe long and short of that was that Ranjoor Singh was sent for; and\nwhen he returned to the trench after two days' absence it was to\nwork independently of us--from our trench, but irrespective of our\ndoings. Even Colonel Kirby now had no orders to give him, although\nthey two talked long and at frequent intervals in the place Colonel\nKirby called his funk-hole. It was now that the squadron's\nreawakening love for Ranjoor Singh received the worst check of any.\nWe had almost forgotten he knew German. Henceforward he conversed in\nGerman each day with the enemy.\n\nIt is a strange thing, sahib,--not easy to explain--but I, who have\nachieved some fluency in English and might therefore have admired\nhis gift of tongues, now began to doubt him in earnest--hating\nmyself the while, but doubting him. And Gooja Singh, who had talked\nthe most and dropped the blackest hints against him, now began to\ntake his side.\n\nAnd Ranjoor Singh said nothing. Night after night he went to lie at\nthe point where our trench and the enemy's lay closest. There he\nwould talk with some one whom we never saw, while we sat shivering\nin the mud. Cold we can endure, sahib, as readily as any; it is\ncolder in winter where I come from than anything I felt in Flanders;\nbut the rain and the mud depressed our spirits, until with these two\neyes I have seen grown men weeping.\n\nThey kept us at work to encourage us. Our spells in the trench were\nshortened and our rests at the rear increased to the utmost\npossible. Only Ranjoor Singh took no vacation, remaining ever on the\nwatch, passing from one trench to another, conversing ever with the\nenemy.\n\nWe dug and they dug, each side laboring everlastingly to find the\nother's listening places and to blow them up by means of mining, so\nthat the earth became a very rat-run. Above-ground, where were only\nruin and barbed wire, there was no sign of activity, but only a\ngreat stench that came from bodies none dared bury. We were thankful\nthat the wind blew oftenest from us to them; but whichever way the\nwind blew Ranjoor Singh knew no rest. He was ever to be found where\nthe lines lay closest at the moment, either listening or talking. We\nunderstood very well that he was carrying out orders given him at\nthe rear, but that did not make the squadron or the regiment like\nhim any better, and as far as that went I was one with them; I hated\nto see a squadron leader stoop to such intrigues.\n\nIt was plain enough that some sort of intrigue was making headway,\nfor the Germans soon began to toss over into our trench bundles of\nprinted pamphlets, explaining in our tongue why they were our best\nfriends and why therefore we should refuse to wage war on them. They\nthrew printed bulletins that said, in good Punjabi, there was\nrevolution from end to end of India, rioting in England, utter\ndisaster to the British fleet, and that our way home again to India\nhad been cut by the German war-ships. They must have been ignorant\nof the fact that we received our mail from India regularly. I have\nnoticed this about the Germans: they are unable to convince\nthemselves that any other people can appreciate the same things they\nappreciate, think as swiftly as they, or despise the terrors they\ndespise. That is one reason why they must lose this war. But there\nare others also.\n\nOne afternoon, when I was pretending to doze in a niche near the\nentrance to Colonel Kirby's funk-hole, I became possessed of the key\nto it all; for Colonel Kirby's voice was raised more than once in\nanger. I understood at last how Ranjoor Singh had orders to deceive\nthe Germans as to our state of mind. He was to make them believe we\nwere growing mutinous and that the leaven only needed time in which\nto work; this of course for the purpose of throwing them off their\nguard.\n\nMy heart stopped beating while I listened, for what man hears his\nhonor smirched without wincing? Even so I think I would have held my\ntongue, only that Gooja Singh, who dozed in a niche on the other\nside of the funk-hole entrance, heard the same as I.\n\nSaid Gooja Singh that evening to the troopers round about: \"They\nchose well,\" said he. \"They picked a brave man--a clever man, for a\ndesperate venture!\" And when the troopers asked what that might\nmean, he asked how many of them in the Punjab had seen a goat tied\nto a stake to lure a panther. The suggestion made them think. Then,\npretending to praise him, letting fall no word that could be thrown\nback in his teeth, he condemned Ranjoor Singh for a worse traitor\nthan any had yet believed him. Gooja Singh was a man with a certain\nsubtlety. A man with two tongues, very dangerous.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh is brave,\" said he, \"for he is not afraid to\nsacrifice us all. Many officers are afraid to lose too many men in\nthe gaining of an end, but not so he. He is clever, for who else\nwould have thought of making us seem despicable to the Germans in\norder to tempt them to attack in force at this point? Have ye not\nnoticed how to our rear all is being made ready for the defense and\nfor a counter-attack to follow? We are the bait. The battle is to be\nwaged over our dead bodies.\"\n\nI corrected him. I said I had heard as well as he, and that Colonel\nKirby was utterly angry at the defamation of those whom he was ever\npleased to call \"his Sikhs.\" But that convinced nobody, although it\ndid the colonel sahib no harm in the regiment's opinion--not that he\nneeded advocates. We were all ready to die around Colonel Kirby at\nany minute. Even Gooja Singh was ready to do that.\n\n\"Does the colonel sahib accept the situation?\" one of the troopers\nasked.\n\n\"Aye, for he must,\" said Gooja Singh; and I could not deny it.\n\"Ranjoor Singh went over his head and orders have come from the\nrear.\" I could not deny that either, although I did not believe it.\nHow should I, or any one, know what passed after Ranjoor Singh had\nbeen sent for by the Intelligence officers? I was his half-friend in\nthose days, sahib. Worse than his enemy--unwilling to take part\nagainst him, yet unready to speak up in his defense. Doubtless my\nsilence went for consent among the troopers.\n\nThe end of the discussion found men unafraid. \"If the colonel sahib\nis willing to be bait,\" said they, \"then so be we, but let us see to\nit that none hang back.\" And so the whole regiment made up its mind\nto die desperately, yet with many a sidewise glance at Ranjoor\nSingh, who was watched more carefully than I think he guessed in\nthose days. If he had tried to slip back to the rear it would have\nbeen the end of him. But he continued with us.\n\nAnd all this while a great force gathered at our rear--gathered and\ngrew--Indian and British infantry. Guns by the fifty were brought\nforward under cover of the night and placed in line behind us.\nRanjoor Singh continued talking with the enemy, lying belly downward\nin the mud, and they kept throwing printed stuff to us that we\nturned in to our officers. But the Germans did not attack. And the\nforce behind us grew.\n\nThen one evening, just after dusk, we were all amazed by the news\nthat the assault was to come from our side. And almost before that\nnews had reached us the guns at our rear began their overture,\nmaking preparation beyond the compass of a man's mind to grasp or\nconvey. They hurled such a torrent of shells that the Germans could\nneither move away the troops in front of us nor bring up others to\ntheir aid. It did not seem possible that one German could be left\nalive, and I even felt jealous because, thought I, no work would be\nleft for us to do! Yet men did live--as we discovered. For a night\nand a day our ordnance kept up that preparation, and then word went\naround.\n\nWho shall tell of a night attack, from a trench against trenches?\nSuddenly the guns ceased pounding the earth in front of us and\nlifted to make a screen of fire almost a mile beyond. There was\ninstant pitch darkness on every hand, and out of that a hundred\ntrumpets sounded. Instantly, each squadron leader leaped the\nearthwork, shouting to his men. Ranjoor Singh leaped up in front of\nus, and we followed him, all forgetting their distrust of him in the\nfierce excitement--remembering only how he had led us in the charge\non that first night. The air was thick with din, and fumes, and\nflying metal--for the Germans were not forgetting to use artillery.\nI ceased to think of anything but going forward. Who shall describe\nit?\n\nOnce in Bombay I heard a Christian preacher tell of the Judgment Day\nto come, when graves shall give up their dead. That is not our Sikh\nidea of judgment, but his words brought before my mind a picture\nriot so much unlike a night attack in Flanders. He spoke of the\nwhole earth trembling and consumed by fire--of thunder and lightning\nand a great long trumpet call--of the dead leaping alive again from\nthe graves where they lay buried. Not a poor picture, sahib, of a\nnight attack in Flanders!\n\nThe first line of German trenches, and the second had been pounded\nout of being by our guns. The barbed wire had been cut into\nfragments by our shrapnel. Here and there an arm or a leg protruded\nfrom the ground--here and there a head. For two hundred yards and\nperhaps more there was nothing to oppose us, except the enemy shells\nbursting so constantly that we seemed to breathe splintered metal.\nYet very few were hit. The din was so great that it seemed to be\nsilence. We were phantom men, going forward without sound of\nfootfall. I could neither feel nor think for the first two hundred\nyards, but ran with my bayonet out in front of me. And then I did\nfeel. A German bayonet barked my knuckles. After that there was\nfighting such as I hope never to know again.\n\nThe Germans did not seem to have been taken by surprise at all. They\nhad made ample preparation. And as for holding us in contempt, they\ngave no evidence of that. Their wounded were unwilling to surrender\nbecause their officers had given out we would torture prisoners. We\nhad to pounce on them, and cut their buttons off and slit their\nboots, so that they must use both hands to hold their trousers up\nand could not run. And that took time so that we lagged behind a\nlittle, for we took more prisoners than the regiments to right and\nleft of us. The Dogra regiment to our left and the Gurkha regiment\nto our right gained on us fast, and we became, as it were, the\ncenter of a new moon.\n\nBut then in the light of bursting shells we saw Colonel Kirby and\nRanjoor Singh and Captain Fellowes and some other officers far out\nin front of us beckoning--calling on us for our greatest effort. We\nanswered. We swept forward after them into the teeth of all the\ninventions in the world. Mine after mine exploded under our very\nfeet. Shrapnel burst among us. There began to be uncut wire, and men\nrushed out at us from trenches that we thought obliterated, but that\nproved only to have been hidden under debris by our gun-fire.\nShadows resolved into trenches defended by machine guns.\n\nBut we went forward--cavalry, without a spur among us--cavalry with\nrifles--cavalry on foot--infantry with the fire and the drill and\nthe thoughts of cavalry--still cavalry at heart, for all the weapons\nthey had given us and the trench life we had lived. We remembered,\nsahib, that the Germans had been educated lately to despise us, and\nwe were out that night to convert them to a different opinion! It\nseemed good to D Squadron that Ranjoor Singh, who had done the\ndefamation, should lead us to the clearing of our name. Nothing\ncould stop us that night.\n\nWhereas we had been last in the advance, we charged into the lead\nand held it. We swept on I know not how far, but very far beyond the\nwings. No means had been devised that I know of for checking the\ndistance covered, and I suppose Headquarters timed the attack and\ntried to judge how far the advance had carried, with the aid of\nmessengers sent running back. No easy task!\n\nAt all events we lost touch with the regiments to right and left,\nbut kept touch with the enemy, pressing forward until suddenly our\nown shell-fire ceased to fall in front of us but resumed pounding\ntoward our rear. They call such a fire a barrage, sahib. Its purpose\nis to prevent the enemy from making a counter-attack until the\ninfantry can dig themselves in and secure the new ground won. That\nmeant we were isolated. It needed no staff officer to tell, us that,\nor to bring us to our senses. We were like men who wake from a\nnightmare, to find the truth more dreadful than the dream.\n\nColonel Kirby was wounded a little, and sat while a risaldar bound\nhis arm. Ranjoor Singh found a short trench half full of water, and\nordered us into it. Although we had not realized it until then, it\nwas raining torrents, and the Germans we drove out of that trench\n(there were but a few of them) were wetter than water rats; but we\nhad to scramble down into it, and the cold bath finished what the\nsense of isolation had begun. We were sober men when Kirby sahib\nscrambled in last and ordered us to begin on the trench at once with\npicks and shovels that the Germans had left behind. We altered the\ntrench so that it faced both ways, and waited shivering for the\ndawn.\n\nLet it not be supposed, however, sahib, that we waited unmolested.\nThe Germans are not that kind of warrior. I hold no brief for them,\nbut I tell no lies about them, either. They fight with persistence,\nbravery, and what they consider to be cunning. We were under rifle-fire\nat once from before and behind and the flanks, and our own\nartillery began pounding the ground so close to us that fragments of\nshell and shrapnel flew over our heads incessantly, and great clods\nof earth came thumping and splashing into our trench, compelling us\nto keep busy with the shovels. Nor did the German artillery omit to\nmake a target of us, though with poor success. More than the half of\nus lived; and to prove that there had been thought as well as\nbravery that night we had plenty of ammunition with us. We were\ntroubled to stow the ammunition out of the wet, yet where it would\nbe safe from the German fire.\n\nWe made no reply to the shell-fire, for that would have been\nfoolishness; so, doubtless thinking they had the range not quite\nright, or perhaps supposing that we had been annihilated, the enemy\ndiscontinued shelling us and devoted their attention to our friends\nbeyond. But at the same time a battalion of infantry began to feel\nits way toward us and we grew very busy with our rifles, the wounded\ncrawling through the wet to pass the cartridges. Once there was a\nbayonet charge, which we repelled.\n\nThose who had not thrown away their knapsacks to lighten themselves\nhad their emergency rations, but about half of us had nothing to eat\nwhatever. It was perfectly evident to all of us from the very first\nthat unless we should receive prompt aid at dawn our case was as\nhopeless as death itself. So much the more reason for stout hearts,\nsaid we, and our bearing put new heart into our officers.\n\nWhen dawn came the sight was not inspiriting. Dawn amid a waste of\nFlanders mud, seen through a rain-storm, is not a joyous spectacle\nin any case. Consider, sahib, what a sunny land we came from, and\npass no hasty judgment on us if our spirits sank. It was the\nweather, not the danger that depressed us. I, who was near the\ncenter of the trench, could see to right and left over the ends, and\nI made a hasty count of heads, discovering that we, who had been a\nregiment, were now about three hundred men, forty of whom were\nwounded.\n\nI saw that we were many a hundred yards away from the nearest\nBritish trench. The Germans had crept under cover of the darkness\nand dug themselves in anew between us and our friends. Before us was\na trench full of infantry, and there were others to right and left.\nWe were completely surrounded; and it was not an hour after dawn\nwhen the enemy began to shout to us to show our hands and surrender.\nColonel Kirby forbade us to answer them, and we lay still as dead\nmen until they threw bombs--which we answered with bullets.\n\nAfter that we were left alone for an hour or two, and Colonel Kirby,\nwhose wound was not serious, began passing along the trench, knee-deep\nin the muddy water, to inspect us and count us and give each\nman encouragement. It was just as he passed close to me that a\nhand-grenade struck him in the thigh and exploded. He fell forward on me,\nand I took him across my knee lest he fall into the water and be\nsmothered. That is how it happened that only I overheard what he\nsaid to Ranjoor Singh before he died. Several others tried to hear,\nfor we loved Colonel Kirby as sons love their father; but, since he\nlay with his head on my shoulder, my ear was as close to his lips as\nRanjoor Singh's, to whom he spoke, so that Ranjoor Singh and I heard\nand the rest did not. Later I told the others, but they chose to\ndisbelieve me.\n\nRanjoor Singh came wading along the trench, stumbling over men's\nfeet in his hurry and nearly falling just as he reached us, so that\nfor the moment I thought he too had been shot. Besides Colonel\nKirby, who was dying in my arms, he, and Captain Fellowes, and one\nother risaldar were our only remaining officers. Colonel Kirby was\nin great pain, so that his words were not in his usual voice but\nforced through clenched teeth, and Ranjoor Singh had to stoop to\nlisten.\n\n\"Shepherd 'em!\" said Colonel Kirby. \"Shepherd 'em, Ranjoor Singh!\"\nMy ear was close and I heard each word. \"A bad business. They did\nnot know enough to listen to you at Headquarters. Don't waste time\nblaming anybody. Pray for wisdom, and fear nothing! You're in\ncommand now. Take over. Shepherd 'em! Good-by, old friend!\"\n\n\"Good-by, Colonel sahib,\" said Ranjoor Singh, and Kirby sahib died\nin that moment, having shed the half of his blood over me. Ranjoor\nSingh and I laid him along a ledge above the water and it was not\nvery long before a chance shell dropped near and buried him under a\nton of earth. Yes, sahib, a British shell.\n\nPresently Ranjoor Singh waded along the trench to have word with\nCaptain Fellowes, who was wounded rather badly. I made busy with the\nmen about me, making them stand where they could see best with least\nrisk of exposure and ordering spade work here and there. It is a\nstrange thing, sahib, but I have never seen it otherwise, that spade\nwork--which is surely the most important thing--is the last thing\ntroopers will attend to unless compelled. They will comb their\nbeards, and decorate the trench with colored stones and draw names\nin the mud, but the all-important digging waits. Sikh and Gurkha and\nBritish and French are all alike in that respect.\n\nWhen Ranjoor Singh came back from his talk with Captain Fellowes he\nsent me to the right wing under our other risaldar, and after he was\nkilled by a grenade I was in command of the right wing of our\ntrench.\n\nThe three days that followed have mostly gone from memory, that\nbeing the way of evil. If men could remember pain and misery they\nwould refuse to live because of the risk of more of it; but hope\nsprings ever anew out of wretchedness like sprouts on the burned\nland, and the ashes are forgotten. I do not remember much of those\nthree days.\n\nThere was nothing to eat. There began to be a smell. There was worse\nthan nothing to drink, for thirst took hold of us, yet the water in\nthe trench was all pollution. The smell made us wish to vomit, yet\nwhat could the empty do but desire? Corpses lay all around us. No,\nsahib, not the dead of the night before's fighting. Have I not said\nthat the weather was cold? The bombardment by our own guns preceding\nour attack had torn up graves that were I know not how old. When we\nessayed to re-bury some bodies the Germans drove us back under\ncover.\n\nThat night, and the next, several attempts were made to rush us, but\nunder Ranjoor Singh's command we beat them off. He was wakeful as\nthe stars and as unexcited. Obedience to him was so comforting that\nmen forgot for the time their suspicion and distrust. When dawn came\nthere were more dead bodies round about, and some wounded who called\npiteously for help. The Germans crawled out to help their wounded,\nbut Ranjoor Singh bade us drive them back and we obeyed.\n\nThen the Germans began shouting to us, and Ranjoor Singh answered\nthem. If he had answered in English, so that most of us could have\nunderstood, all would surely have been well; I am certain that in\nthat case the affection, returning because of his fine leadership,\nwould have destroyed the memory of suspicion. But I suppose it had\nbecome habit with him to talk to the enemy in German by that time,\nand as the words we could not understand passed back and forth even\nI began to hate him. Yet he drove a good bargain for us.\n\nInstead of hand-grenades the Germans began to throw bread to us--great,\nflat, army loaves, Ranjoor Singh not showing himself, but\ncounting aloud as each loaf came over, we catching with great\nanxiety lest they fall into the water and be polluted. It took a\nlong time, but when there was a good dry loaf for each man, Ranjoor\nSingh gave the Germans leave to come and carry in their wounded, and\nbade us hold our fire. Gooja Singh was for playing a trick but the\ntroopers near him murmured and Ranjoor Singh threatened him with\ndeath if he dared. He never forgot that.\n\nThe Germans who came to fetch the wounded laughed at us, but Ranjoor\nSingh forbade us to answer, and Captain Fellowes backed him up.\n\n\"There will be another attack from our side presently,\" said Captain\nFellowes, \"and our friends will answer for us.\"\n\nI shuddered at that. I remembered the bombardment that preceded our\nfirst advance. Better die at the hands of the enemy, thought I. But\nI said nothing. Presently, however, a new thought came to me, and I\ncalled to Ranjoor Singh along the trench.\n\n\"You should have made a better bargain,\" said I. \"You should have\ncompelled them to care for our wounded before they were allowed to\ntake their own!\"\n\n\"I demanded, but they refused,\" he answered, and then I wished I had\nbitten out my tongue rather than speak, for although I believed his\nanswer, the rest of the men did not. There began to be new murmuring\nagainst him, led by Gooja Singh; but Gooja Singh was too subtle to\nbe convicted of the responsibility.\n\nCaptain Fellowes grew aware of the murmuring and made much show\nthenceforward of his faith in Ranjoor Singh. He was weak from his\nwound and was attended constantly by two men, so that although he\nkept command of the left wing and did ably he could not shout loud\nenough to be heard very far, and he had to send messages to Ranjoor\nSingh from mouth to mouth. His evident approval had somewhat the\neffect of subduing the men's resentment, although not much, and when\nhe died that night there was none left, save I, to lend our leader\ncountenance. And I was only his half-friend, without enough merit in\nmy heart truly to be the right-hand man I was by right of seniority.\nI was willing enough to die at his back, but not to share contempt\nwith him.\n\nThe day passed and there came another day, when the bread was done,\nand there were no more German wounded straddled in the mud over whom\nto strike new bargains. It had ceased raining, so we could catch no\nrain to drink. We were growing weak from weariness and want of\nsleep, and we demanded of Ranjoor Singh that he lead us back toward\nthe British lines.\n\n\"We should perish on the way,\" said he.\n\n\"What of it?\" we answered, I with the rest. \"Better that than this\nvulture's death in a graveyard!\"\n\nBut he shook his head and ordered us to try to think like men. \"The\nlife of a Sikh,\" said he, \"and the oath of a Sikh are one. We swore\nto serve our friends. To try to cut our way back would be but to die\nfor our own comfort.\"\n\n\"You should have led us back that first night, when the attack was\nspent,\" said Gooja Singh.\n\n\"I was not in command that first night,\" Ranjoor Singh answered him,\nand who could gainsay that?\n\nAt irregular intervals British shells began bursting near us, and we\nall knew what they were. The batteries were feeling for the range.\nThey would begin a new bombardment. Now, therefore, is the end, said\nwe. But Ranjoor Singh stood up with his head above the trench and\nbegan shouting to the Germans. They answered him. Then, to our utter\nastonishment, he tore the shirt from a dead man, tied it to a rifle,\nand held it up.\n\nThe Germans cheered and laughed, but we made never a sound. We were\nbewildered--sick from the stink and weariness and thirst and lack of\nfood. Yet I swear to you, sahib, on my honor that it had not entered\ninto the heart of one of us to surrender. That we who had been first\nof the Indian contingent to board a ship, first to land in France,\nfirst to engage the enemy, should now be first to surrender in a\nbody seemed to us very much worse than death. Yet Ranjoor Singh bade\nus leave our rifles and climb out of the trench, and we obeyed him.\nGod knows why we obeyed him. I, who had been half-hearted hitherto,\nhated him in that minute as a trapped wolf hates the hunter; yet I,\ntoo, obeyed.\n\nWe left our dead for the Germans to bury, but we dragged the wounded\nout and some of them died as we lifted them. When we reached the\nGerman trench and they counted us, including Ranjoor Singh and\nthree-and-forty wounded there were two-hundred-and-three-and-fifty\nof us left alive.\n\nThey led Ranjoor Singh apart. He had neither rifle nor saber in his\nhand, and he walked to their trench alone because we avoided him. He\nwas more muddy than we, and as ragged and tired. He had stood in the\nsame foul water, and smelt the same stench. He was hungry as we. He\nhad been willing to surrender, and we had not. Yet he walked like an\nofficer, and looked like one, and we looked like animals. And we\nknew it, and he knew it. And the Germans recognized the facts.\n\nHe acted like a crowned king when he reached the trench. A German\nofficer spoke with him earnestly, but he shook his head and then\nthey led him away. When he was gone the same officer came and spoke\nto us in English, and I understanding him at once, he bade me tell\nthe others that the British must have witnessed our surrender.\n\"See,\" said he, \"what a bombardment they have begun again. That is\nin the hope of slaying you. That is out of revenge because you dared\nsurrender instead of dying like rats in a ditch to feed their\npride!\" It was true that a bombardment had begun again. It had begun\nthat minute. Those truly had been ranging shells. If we had stayed\nfive minutes longer before surrendering we should have been blown to\npieces; but we were in no mood to care on that account.\n\nThe Germans are a simple folk, sahib, although they themselves think\notherwise. When they think they are the subtlest they are easiest to\nunderstand. Understanding was reborn in my heart on account of that\nGerman's words. Thought I, if Ranjoor Singh were in truth a traitor\nthen he would have leaped at a chance to justify himself to us. He\nwould have repeated what that German had urged him to tell us. Yet I\nsaw him refuse.\n\nAs they hurried him away alone, pity for him came over me like warm\nrain on the parched earth, and when a man can pity he can reason, I\nspoke in Punjabi to the others and the German officer thought I was\ntranslating what he told me to say, yet in truth I reminded them\nthat man can find no place where God is not, and where God is is\ncourage. I was senior now, and my business was to encourage them.\nThey took new heart from my words, all except Gooja Singh, who wept\nnoisily, and the German officer was pleased with what he mistook for\nthe effect of his speech.\n\n\"Tell them they shall be excellently treated,\" said he, seizing my\nelbow. \"When we shall have won this war the British will no longer\nbe able to force natives of India to fight their battles for them.\"\n\nI judged it well to repeat that word for word. There are over ten\napplicants for every vacancy in such a regiment as ours, and until\nRanjoor Singh ordered our surrender, we were all free men--free\ngivers of our best; whereas the Germans about us were all\nconscripts. The comparison did no harm.\n\nWe saw no more of our wounded until some of them were returned to us\nhealed, weeks later; but from them we learned that their treatment\nhad been good. With us, however, it was not so, in spite of the\npromise the German officer had made. We were hustled along a wide\ntrench, and taken over by another guard, not very numerous but\nbrutal, who kicked us without excuse. As we went the trenches were\nunder fire all the time from the British artillery. The guards swore\nit was our surrender that had drawn the fire, and belabored us the\nmore on that account.\n\nAt the rear of the German lines we were herded in a quarry lest we\nobserve too much, and it was not until after dark that we were given\nhalf a loaf of bread apiece. Then, without time to eat that which\nhad been given to us, we were driven off into the darkness. First,\nhowever, they took our goatskin overcoats away, saying they were too\ngood to be worn by savages. A non-commissioned officer, who could\nspeak good English, was sent for to explain that point to us.\n\nAfter an hour's march through the dark we were herded into some\ncattle trucks that stood on a siding behind some trees. The trucks\ndid not smell of cattle, but of foul garments and unwashed men. Two\narmed German infantrymen were locked into each truck with us, and\nthe pair in the truck in which I was drove us in a crowd to the\nfarther end, claiming an entire half for themselves. It was true\nthat we stank, for we had been many days and nights without\nopportunity to get clean; yet they offered us no means of washing--only\nabuse. I have seen German prisoners allowed to wash before they\nhad been ten minutes behind the British lines.\n\nWe were five days in that train, sahib--five days and nights. Our\nguards were fed at regular intervals, but not we. Once or twice a\nday they brought us a bucket of water from which we were bidden\ndrink in a great hurry while the train waited; yet often the train\nwaited hours on sidings and no water at all was brought us. For food\nwe were chiefly dependent on the charity of people at the wayside\nstations who came with gifts intended for German wounded; some of\nthose took pity on us.\n\nAt last, sahib, when we were cold and stiff and miserable to the\nvery verge of death, we came to a little place called Oeschersleben,\nand there the cruelty came to an unexpected end. We were ordered out\nof the trucks and met on the platform by a German, not in uniform,\nwho showed distress at our predicament and who hastened to assure us\nin our own tongue that henceforward there would be amends made.\n\nIf that man had taken charge of us in the beginning we might not\nhave been suspicious of him, for he seemed gentle and his words were\nfair; but now his kindness came too late to have effect. Animals can\nsometimes be rendered tame by starvation and brutality followed by\nplenty and kindness, but not men, and particularly not Sikhs--it\nbeing no part of our Guru's teaching that either full belly or\ntutored intellect can compensate for lack of goodness. Neither is it\nhis teaching, on the other hand, that a man must wear thoughts on\nhis face; so we did not reject this man's advances.\n\n\"There have been mistakes made,\" said he, \"by ignorant common\nsoldiers who knew no better. You shall recuperate on good food, and\nthen we shall see what we shall see.\"\n\nI asked him where Ranjoor Singh was, but he did not answer me.\n\nWe were not compelled to walk. Few of us could have walked. We were\nstiff from confinement and sick from neglect. Carts drawn by oxen\nstood near the station, and into those we were crowded and driven to\na camp on the outskirts of the town. There comfortable wooden huts\nwere ready, well warmed and clean--and a hot meal--and much hot\nwater in which we were allowed to bathe.\n\nThen, when we had eaten, doctors came and examined us. New clothes\nwere given us--German uniforms of khaki, and khaki cotton cloth from\nwhich to bind new turbans. Nothing was left undone to make us feel\nwell received, except that a barbed-wire fence was all about the\ncamp and armed guards marched up and down outside.\n\nBeing senior surviving non-commissioned officer, I was put in charge\nof the camp in a certain manner, with many restrictions to my\nauthority, and for about a week we did nothing but rest and eat and\nkeep the camp tidy. All day long Germans, mostly women and children\nbut some men, came to stare at us through the barbed-wire fence as\nif we were caged animals, but no insults were offered us. Rather,\nthe women showed us kindness and passed us sweetmeats and strange\nfood through the fence until an officer came and stopped them with\noverbearing words. Then, presently, there was a new change.\n\nA week had gone and we were feeling better, standing about and\nlooking at the freshly fallen snow, marking the straight tracks made\nby the sentries outside the fence, and thinking of home maybe, when\nnew developments commenced.\n\nTelegrams translated into Punjabi were nailed to the door of a hut,\ntelling of India in rebellion and of men, women and children\nbutchered by the British in cold blood. Other telegrams stated that\nthe Sikhs of India in particular had risen, and that Pertab Singh,\nour prince, had been hanged in public. Many other lies they posted\nup. It would be waste of time to tell them all. They were\nfoolishness--such foolishness as might deceive the German public,\nbut not us who had lived in India all our lives and who had received\nour mail from home within a day or two of our surrender.\n\nThere came plausible men who knew our tongue and the argument was\nbluntly put to us that we ought to let expediency be our guide in\nall things. Yet we were expected to trust the men who gave us such\nadvice!\n\nOur sense of justice was not courted once. They made appeal to our\nbellies--to our purses--to our lust--to our fear--but to our\nrighteousness not at all. They made for us great pictures of what\nGerman rule of the world would be, and at last I asked whether it\nwas true that the kaiser had turned Muhammadan. I was given no\nanswer until I had asked repeatedly, and then it was explained how\nthat had been a rumor sent abroad to stir Islam; to us, on the other\nhand, nothing but truth was told. So I asked, was it true that our\nPrince Pertab Singh had been hanged, and they told me yes. I asked\nthem where, and they said in Delhi. Yet I knew that Pertab Singh was\nall the while in London. I asked them where was Ranjoor Singh all\nthis while, and for a time they made no answer, so I asked again and\nagain. Then one day they began to talk of Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThey told us he was being very useful to them, in Berlin, in daily\nconference with the German General Staff, explaining matters that\npertained to the intended invasion of India. Doubtless they thought\nthat news would please us greatly. But, having heard so many lies\nalready, I set that down for another one, and the others became all\nthe more determined in their loyalty from sheer disgust at Ranjoor\nSingh's unfaithfulness. They believed and I disbelieved, yet the\nresult was one.\n\nAt night Gooja Singh held forth in the hut where he slept with\ntwenty-five others. He explained--although he did not say how he\nknew--that the Germans have kept for many years in Berlin an office\nfor the purpose of intrigue in India--an office manned by Sikh\ntraitors. \"That is where Ranjoor Singh will be,\" said he. \"He will\nbe managing that bureau.\" In those days Gooja Singh was Ranjoor\nSingh's bitterest enemy, although later he changed sides again.\n\nThe night-time was the worst. By day there was the camp to keep\nclean and the German officers to talk to; but at night we lay awake\nthinking of India, and of our dead officer sahibs, and of all that\nhad been told us that we knew was lies. Ever the conversation turned\nto Ranjoor Singh at last, and night after night the anger grew\nagainst him. I myself admitted very often that his duty had been to\nlead us to our death. I was ashamed as the rest of our surrender.\n\nAfter a time, as our wounded began to be drafted back to us from\nhospital, we were made to listen to accounts of alleged great German\nvictories. They told us the German army was outside Paris and that\nthe whole of the British North Sea Fleet was either sunk or\ncaptured. They also said that the Turks in Gallipoli had won great\nvictories against the Allies. We began to wonder why such conquerors\nshould seek so earnestly the friendship of a handful of us Sikhs.\nOur wounded began to be drafted back to us well primed, and their\nstories made us think, but not as the Germans would have had us\nthink.\n\nWeek after week until the spring came we listened to their tales by\nday and talked them over among ourselves at night; and the more they\nassured us Ranjoor Singh was working with them in Berlin, the more\nwe prayed for opportunity to prove our hearts. Spring dragged along\ninto summer and there began to be prayers for vengeance on him. I\nsaid less than any. Understanding had not come to me fully yet, but\nit seemed to me that if Ranjoor Singh was really playing traitor,\nthen he was going a tedious way about it. Yet it was equally clear\nthat if I should dare to say one word in his behalf that would be to\npass sentence on myself. I kept silence when I could, and was\nevasive when they pressed me, cowardice struggling with new\nconviction in my heart.\n\nThere came one night at last, when men's hearts burned in them too\nterribly for sleep, that some one proposed a resolution and sent the\nword whispering from hut to hut, that we should ask for Ranjoor\nSingh to be brought to us. Let the excuse be that he was our\nrightful leader, and that therefore he ought to advise us what we\nshould do. Let us promise to do faithfully whatever Ranjoor Singh\nshould order. Then, when he should have been brought to us, should\nhe talk treason we would tear him in pieces with our hands. That\nresolution was agreed to. I also agreed. It was I who asked the next\nday that Ranjoor Singh be brought. The German officer laughed; yet I\nasked again, and he went away smiling.\n\nWe talked of our plan at night. We repeated it at dawn. We whispered\nit above the bread at breakfast. After breakfast we stood in groups,\nconfirming our decision with great oaths and binding one another to\nfulfillment--I no less than all the others. Like the others I was\nblinded now by the sense of our high purpose and I forgot to\nconsider what might happen should Ranjoor Singh take any other line\nthan that expected of him.\n\nI think it was eleven in the morning of the fourth day after our\ndecision, when we had all grown weary of threats of vengeance and of\nargument as to what each individual man should do to our major's\nbody, that there was some small commotion at the entrance gate and a\nman walked through alone. The gate slammed shut again behind him.\n\nHe strode forward to the middle of our compound, stood still, and\nconfronted us. We stared at him. We gathered round him. We said\nnothing.\n\n\"Fall in, two deep!\" commanded he. And we fell in, two deep, just as\nhe ordered.\n\n\"'Ten-shun!\" commanded he. And we stood to attention.\n\nSahib, he was Ranjoor Singh!\n\nHe stood within easy reach of the nearest man, clothed in a new\nkhaki German uniform. He wore a German saber at his side. Yet I\nswear to you the saber was not the reason why no man struck at him.\nNor were there Germans near enough to have rescued him. We, whose\noath to murder him still trembled on our lips, stood and faced him\nwith trembling knees now that he had come at last.\n\nWe stood before him like two rows of dumb men, gazing at his face. I\nhave heard the English say that our eastern faces are impossible to\nread, but that can only be because western eyes are blind. We can\nread them readily enough. Yet we could not read Ranjoor Singh's that\nday. It dawned on us as we stared that we did not understand, but\nthat he did; and there is no murder in that mood.\n\nBefore we could gather our wits he began to speak to us, and we\nlistened as in the old days when at least a squadron of us had loved\nhim to the very death. A very unexpected word was the first he used.\n\n\"Simpletons!\" said he.\n\nSahib, our jaws dropped. Simpletons was the last thing we had\nthought ourselves. On the contrary, we thought ourselves astute to\nhave judged his character and to have kept our minds uncorrupted by\nthe German efforts. Yet we were no longer so sure of ourselves that\nany man was ready with an answer.\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder to left and right. There were no\nGermans inside the fence; none near enough to overhear him, even if\nhe raised his voice. So he did raise it, and we all heard.\n\n\"I come from Berlin!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said we--as one man. For another minute he stood eying us,\nwaiting to see whether any man would speak.\n\n\"We be honest men!\" said a trooper who stood not far from me, and\nseveral others murmured, so I spoke up.\n\n\"He has not come for nothing,\" said I. \"Let us listen first and pass\njudgment afterward.\"\n\n\"We have heard enough treachery!\" said the trooper who had spoken\nfirst, but the others growled him down and presently there was\nsilence.\n\n\"You have eyes,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and ears, and nose, and lips\nfor nothing at all but treachery!\" He spoke very slowly, sahib. \"You\nhave listened, and smelled for it, and have spoken of nothing else,\nand what you have sought you think you have found! To argue with men\nin the dark is like gathering wind into baskets. My business is to\nlead, and I will lead. Your business is to follow, and you shall\nfollow.\" Then, \"Simpletons!\" said he again; and having said that he\nwas silent, as if to judge what effect his words were having.\n\nNo man answered him. I can not speak for the others, although there\nwas a wondrous maze of lies put forth that night by way of\nexplanation that I might repeat. All I know is that through my mind\nkept running against my will self-accusation, self-condemnation,\nself-contempt! I had permitted my love for Ranjoor Singh to be\ncorrupted by most meager evidence. If I had not been his enemy, I\nhad not been true to him, and who is not true is false. I fought\nwith a sense of shame as I have since then fought with thirst and\nhunger. All the teachings of our Holy One accused me. Above all,\nRanjoor Singh's face accused me. I remembered that for more than\ntwenty years he had stood to all of us for an example of what Sikh\nhonor truly is, and that he had been aware of it.\n\n\"I know the thoughts ye think!\" said he, beginning again when he had\ngiven us time to answer and none had dared. \"I will give you a real\nthought to put in the place of all that foolishness. This is a\nregiment. I am its last surviving officer. Any regiment can kill its\nofficers. If ye are weary of being a regiment, behold--I am as near\nyou as a man's throat to his hand! Have no fear\"--(that was a bitter\nthrust, sahib!)--\"this is a German saber; I will use no German steel\non any of you. I will not strike back if any seek to kill me.\"\n\nThere was no movement and no answer, sahib. We did not think; we\nwaited. If he had coaxed us with specious arguments, as surely a\nliar would have done, that would probably have been his last speech\nin the world. But there was not one word he said that did not ring\ntrue.\n\n\"I have been made a certain offer in Berlin,\" said he, after another\nlong pause. \"First it was made to me alone, and I would not accept\nit. I and my regiment, said I, are one. So the offer was repeated to\nme as the leader of this regiment. Thus they admitted I am the\nrightful leader of it, and the outcome of that shall be on their\nheads. As major of this regiment, I accepted the offer, and as its\nmajor I now command your obedience.\"\n\n\"Obedience to whom?\" asked I, speaking again as it were against my\nwill, and frightened by my own voice.\n\n\"To me,\" said he.\n\n\"Not to the Germans?\" I asked. He wore a German uniform, and so for\nthat matter did we all.\n\n\"To me,\" he said again, and he took one step aside that he might see\nmy face better. \"You, Hira Singh, you heard Colonel Kirby make over\nthe command!\"\n\nEvery man in the regiment knew that Colonel Kirby had died across my\nknees. They looked from Ranjoor Singh to me, and from me to Ranjoor\nSingh, and I felt my heart grow first faint from dread of their\nsuspicion, and then bold, then proud that I should be judged fit to\nstand beside him. Then came shame again, for I knew I was not fit.\nMy loyalty to him had not stood the test. All this time I thought I\nfelt his eyes on me like coals that burned; yet when I dared look up\nhe was not regarding me at all, but scanning the two lines of faces,\nperhaps to see if any other had anything to say.\n\n\"If I told you my plan,\" said he presently, when he had cleared his\nthroat, \"you would tear it in little pieces. The Germans have\nanother plan, and they will tell you as much of it as they think it\ngood for you to know. Mark what my orders are! Listen to this plan\nof theirs. Pretend to agree. Then you shall be given weapons. Then\nyou shall leave this camp within a week.\"\n\nThat, sahib, was like a shell bursting in the midst of men asleep.\nWhat did it mean? Eyes glanced to left and right, looking for\nunderstanding and finding none, and no man spoke because none could\nthink of anything to say. It was on my tongue to ask him to explain\nwhen he gave us his final word on the matter--and little enough it\nwas, yet sufficient if we obeyed.\n\n\"Remember the oath of a Sikh!\" said he. \"Remember that he who is\ntrue in his heart to his oath has Truth to fight for him! Treachery\nbegets treason, treason begets confusion; and who are ye to stay the\ncourse of things? Faith begets faith; courage gives birth to\nopportunity!\"\n\nHe paused, but we knew he had not finished yet, and he kept us\nwaiting full three minutes wondering what would come. Then:\n\n\"As for your doubts,\" said he. \"If the head aches, shall the body\ncut it off that it may think more clearly? Consider that!\" said he.\n\"Dismiss!\"\n\nWe fell out and he marched away like a king with thoughts of state\nin mind. I thought his beard was grayer than it had been, but oh,\nsahib, he strode as an arrow goes, swift and straight, and splendid.\nLonely as an arrow that has left the sheaf!\n\nI had to run to catch up with him, and I was out of breath when I\ntouched his sleeve. He turned and waited while I thought of things\nto say, and then struggled to find words with which to say them.\n\n\"Sahib!\" said I. \"Oh, Major sahib!\" And then my throat became full\nof words each struggling to be first, and I was silent.\n\n\"Well?\" said he, standing with both arms folded, looking very grave,\nbut not angry nor contemptuous.\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said, \"I am a true man. As I stand here, I am a true man.\nI have been a fool--I have been half-hearted--I was like a man in\nthe dark; I listened and heard voices that deceived me!\"\n\n\"And am I to listen and hear voices, too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, sahib!\" I said. \"Not such voices, but true words!\"\n\n\"Words?\" he said. \"Words! Words! There have already been too many\nwords. Truth needs no words to prove it true, Hira Singh. Words are\nthe voice of nothingness!\"\n\n\"Then, sahib--\" said I, stammering.\n\n\"Hira Singh,\" said he, \"each man's heart is his own. Let each man\nkeep his own. When the time comes we shall see no true men eating\nshame,\" said he.\n\nAnd with that he acknowledged my salute, turned on his heel, and\nmarched away. And the great gate slammed behind him. And German\nofficers pressing close on either side talked with him earnestly,\nasking, as plainly as if I heard the words, what he had said, and\nwhat we had said, and what the outcome was to be. I could see his\nlips move as he answered, but no man living could have guessed what\nhe told them. I never did know what he told them. But I have lived\nto see the fruit of what he did, and of what he made us do; and from\nthat minute I have never faltered for a second in my faithfulness to\nRanjoor Singh.\n\nBe attentive, sahib, and learn what a man of men is Risaldar-major\nRanjoor Singh bahadur.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nShall he who knows not false from true judge treason?--EASTERN PROVERB.\n\n\nYou may well imagine, sahib, in the huts that night there was noise\nas of bees about to swarm. No man slept. Men flitted like ghosts\nfrom hut to hut--not too openly, nor without sufficient evidence of\nstealth to keep the guards in good conceit of themselves, but freely\nfor all that. What the men of one hut said the men of the next hut\nknew within five minutes, and so on, back and forth.\n\nI was careful to say nothing. When men questioned me, \"Nay,\" said I.\n\"I am one and ye are many. Choose ye! Could I lead you against your\nwills?\" They murmured at that, but silence is easier to keep than\nsome men think.\n\nWhy did I say nothing? In the first place, sahib, because my mind\nwas made at last. With all my heart now, with the oath of a Sikh and\nthe truth of a Sikh I was Ranjoor Singh's man. I believed him true,\nand I was ready to stand or fall by that belief, in the dark, in the\nteeth of death, against all odds, anywhere. Therefore there was\nnothing I could say with wisdom. For if they were to suspect my true\nthoughts, they would lose all confidence in me, and then I should be\nof little use to the one man who could help all of us. I judged that\nwhat Ranjoor Singh most needed was a silent servant who would watch\nand obey the first hint. Just as I had watched him in battle and had\nherded the men for him to lead, so would I do now. There should be\ndeeds, not words, for the foundation of a new beginning.\n\nIn the second place, sahib, I knew full well that if Gooja Singh or\nany of the others could have persuaded me to advance an opinion it\nwould have been pounced on, and changed out of all recognition, yet\nnamed my opinion nevertheless. This altered opinion they would\npresently adopt, yet calling it mine, and when the outcome of it\nshould fail at last to please them they would blame me. For such is\nthe way of the world. So I had two good reasons, and the words I\nspoke that night could have been counted without aid of pen and\npaper.\n\nThe long and short of it was that morning found them undecided.\nThere was one opinion all held--even Gooja Singh, who otherwise took\nboth sides as to everything--that above all and before all we were\nall true men, loyal to our friends, the British, and foes of every\nliving German or Austrian or Turk so long as the war should last.\nThe Germans had bragged to us about the Turks being in the war on\ntheir side, and we had thought deeply on the subject of their choice\nof friends. Like and like mingle, sahib. As for us, my grandfather\nfought for the British in '57, and my father died at Kandahar under\nBobs bahadur. On that main issue we were all one, and all ashamed to\nbe prisoners while our friends were facing death. But dawn found\nalmost no two men agreed as to Ranjoor Singh, or in fact on any\nother point.\n\nNot long after dawn, came the Germans again, with new arguments. And\nthis time they began to let us feel the iron underlying their\npersuasion. Once, to make talk and gain time before answering a\nquestion, I had told them of our labor in the bunkers on the ship\nthat carried us from India. I had boasted of the coal we piled on\nthe fire-room floor. Lo, it is always foolish to give information to\nthe enemy--always, sahib--always! There is no exception.\n\nSaid they to us now: \"We Germans are devoting all our energy to\nprosecution of this war. Nearly all our able-bodied men are with the\nregiments. Every man must do his part, for we are a nation in arms.\nEven prisoners must do their part. Those who do not fight for us\nmust work to help the men who do fight.\"\n\n\"Work without pay?\" said I.\n\n\"Aye,\" said they, \"work without pay. There is coal, for instance. We\nunderstand that you Sikhs have proved yourselves adept at work with\ncoal. He who can labor in the bunkers of a ship can handle pick and\nshovel in the mines, and most of our miners have been called up. Yet\nwe need more coal than ever.\"\n\nSo, sahib. So they turned my boast against me. And the men around\nme, who had heard me tell the tale about our willing labor on the\nship, now eyed me furiously; although at the time they had enjoyed\nthe boast and had added details of their own. The Germans went away\nand left us to talk over this new suggestion among ourselves, and\nuntil afternoon I was kept busy speaking in my own defense.\n\n\"Who could have foreseen how they would use my words against us?\" I\ndemanded. But they answered that any fool could have foreseen it,\nand that my business was to foresee in any case and to give them\ngood advice. I kept that saying in my heart, and turned it against\nTHEM when the day came.\n\nThat afternoon the Germans returned, with knowing smiles that were\nmeant to seem courteous, and with an air of confidence that was\nmeant to appear considerate. Doubtless a cat at meal-time believes\nmen think him generous and unobtrusive. They went to great trouble\nto prove themselves our wise counselors and disinterested friends.\n\n\"We have explained to you,\" said they, \"what hypocrites the British\nare,--what dust they have thrown in your eyes for more than a\ncentury--how they have grown rich at your expense, deliberately\nkeeping India in ignorance and subjection, in poverty and vice, and\ndivided against itself. We have told you what German aims are on the\nother hand, and how successful our armies are on every front as the\nresult of the consistence of those aims. We have proved to you how\nhalf the world already takes our side--how the Turks fight for us,\nhow Persia begins to join the Turks, how Afghanistan already moves,\nand how India is in rebellion. Now--wouldn't you like to join our\nside--to throw the weight of Sikh honor and Sikh bravery into the\nscale with us? That would be better fun than working in the mines,\"\nsaid they.\n\n\"Are we offered that alternative?\" I asked, but they did not answer\nthat question. They went away again and left us to our thoughts.\n\nAnd we talked all the rest of that day and most of the next night,\narriving at no decision. When they asked me for an opinion, I said,\n\"Ranjoor Singh told us this would be, and he gave us orders what to\ndo.\" When they asked me ought they to obey him, I answered, \"Nay,\nchoose ye! Who can make you obey against your wills?\" And when they\nasked me would I abide by their decision, \"Can the foot walk one\nway,\" I answered, \"while the body walks another? Are we not one?\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Then,\" said they, \"you bid us consider this proposal to take part\nagainst our friends?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"I am a true man. No man can make me fight against\nthe British.\"\n\nThey thought on that for a while, and then surrounded me again,\nGooja Singh being spokesman for them all. \"Then you counsel us,\"\nsaid he, \"to choose the hard labor in the coal mines?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I. \"I counsel nothing.\"\n\n\"But what other course is there?\" said he.\n\n\"There is Ranjoor Singh,\" said I.\n\n\"But he desired to lead us against the British,\" said he.\n\n\"Nay,\" said I. \"Who said so?\"\n\nGooja Singh answered: \"He, Ranjoor Singh himself, said so.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I. \"I heard what he said. He said he will lead us, but\nhe said nothing of his plan. He did not say he will lead us against\nthe British.\"\n\n\"Then it was the Germans. They said so,\" said Gooja Singh. \"They\nsaid he will lead us against the British.\"\n\n\"The Germans said,\" said I, \"that their armies are outside Paris--that\nIndia is in rebellion--that Pertab Singh was hanged in Delhi--that\nthe British rule in India has been altogether selfish--that our\nwives and children have been butchered by the British in cold blood.\nThe Germans,\" said I, \"have told us very many things.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"you counsel us to follow Ranjoor Singh?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I. \"I counsel nothing.\"\n\n\"You are a coward!\" said he. \"You are afraid to give opinion!\"\n\n\"I am one among many!\" I answered him.\n\nThey left me alone again and talked in groups, Gooja Singh passing\nfrom one group to another like a man collecting tickets. Then, when\nit was growing dusk, they gathered once more about me and Gooja\nSingh went through the play of letting them persuade him to be\nspokesman.\n\n\"If we decide to follow Ranjoor Singh,\" said he, \"will you be one\nwith us?\"\n\n\"If that is the decision of you all,\" I answered, \"then yes. But if\nit is Gooja Singh's decision with the rest consenting, then no. Is\nthat the decision of you all?\" I asked, and they murmured a sort of\nanswer.\n\n\"Nay!\" said I. \"That will not do! Either yes or no. Either ye are\nwilling or ye are unwilling. Let him who is unwilling say so, and I\nfor one will hold no judgment against him.\"\n\nNone answered, though I urged again and again. \"Then ye are all\nwilling to give Ranjoor Singh a trial?\" said I; and this time they\nall answered in the affirmative.\n\n\"I think your decision well arrived at!\" I made bold to tell them.\n\"To me it seems you have all seen wisdom, and although I had\nthoughts in mind,\" said I, \"of accepting work in the collieries and\nblowing up a mine perhaps, yet I admit your plan is better and I\ndefer to it.\"\n\nThey were much more pleased with that speech than if I had admitted\nthe truth, that I would never have agreed to any other plan. So that\nnow they were much more ready than they might have been to listen to\nmy next suggestion.\n\n\"But,\" said I, with an air of caution, \"shall we not keep any watch\non Ranjoor Singh?\"\n\n\"Let us watch!\" said they. \"Let us be forehanded!\"\n\n\"But how?\" said I. \"He is an officer. He is not bound to lay bare\nhis thoughts to us.\"\n\nThey thought a long time about that. It grew dark, and we were\nordered to our huts, and lights were put out, and still they lay\nawake and talked of it. At last Gooja Singh flitted through the dark\nand came to me and asked me my opinion on the matter.\n\n\"One of you go and offer to be his servant,\" said I. \"Let that\nservant serve him well. A good servant should know more about his\nmaster than the master himself.\"\n\n\"Who shall that one be?\" he asked; and he went back to tell the men\nwhat I had said.\n\nAfter midnight he returned. \"They say you are the one to keep watch\non him,\" said he.\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said I, with my heart leaping against my ribs, but my\nvoice belying it. \"If I agree to that, then later you will swear I\nam his friend and condemn me in one judgment with him!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said he. \"Nay truly! On the honor of a Sikh!\"\n\n\"Mine is also the honor of a Sikh,\" said I, \"and I will cover it\nwith care. Go back to them,\" I directed, \"and let them all come and\nspeak with me at dawn.\"\n\n\"Is my word not enough?\" said he.\n\n\"Was Ranjoor Singh's enough?\" said I, and he went, muttering to\nhimself.\n\nI slept until dawn--the first night I had slept in three--and before\nbreakfast they all clustered about me, urging me to be the one to\nkeep close watch on Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"God forbid that I should be stool pigeon!\" said I. \"Nay, God\nforbid! Ranjoor Singh need but give an order that ye have no liking\nfor and ye will shoot me in the back for it!\"\n\nThey were very earnest in their protestations, urging me more and\nmore; but the more they urged the more I hung back, and we ate\nbefore I gave them any answer. \"This is a plot,\" said I, \"to get me\nin trouble. What did I ever do that ye should combine against me?\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said they. \"By our Sikh oath, we be true men and your\nfriends. Why do you doubt us?\"\n\nThen said I at last, as it were reluctantly, \"If ye demand it--if ye\ninsist--I will be the go-between. Yet I do it because ye compel me\nby weight of unanimity!\" said I.\n\n\"It is your place!\" said they, but I shook my head, and to this day\nI have never admitted to them that I undertook the work willingly.\n\nPresently came the Germans to us again, this time accompanied by\nofficers in uniform who stood apart and watched with an air of\npassing judgment. They asked us now point-blank whether or not we\nwere willing to work in the coal mines and thus make some return for\nthe cost of keeping us; and we answered with one voice that we were\nnot coal-miners and therefore not willing.\n\n\"The alternative,\" said they, \"is that you apply to fight on the\nside of the Central Empires. Men must all either fight or work in\nthese days; there is no room for idlers.\"\n\n\"Is there no other work we could do?\" asked Gooja Singh.\n\n\"None that we offer you!\" said they. \"If you apply to be allowed to\nfight on the side of the Central Empires, then your application will\nbe considered. However, you would be expected to forswear allegiance\nto Great Britain, and to take the military oath as provided by our\nlaw; so that in the event of any lapse of discipline or loyalty to\nour cause you could be legally dealt with.\"\n\n\"And the alternative is the mines?\" said I.\n\n\"No, no!\" said the chief of them. \"You must not misunderstand. Your\npresent destination is the coal mines, where you are to earn your\nkeep. But the suggestion is made to you that you might care to apply\nfor leave to fight on our side. In that case we would not send you\nto the coal mines until at least your application had been\nconsidered. It is practically certain it would be considered\nfavorably.\"\n\nThe conversation was in English as usual and many of the men had not\nquite understood. Those on the outside had not heard properly. So I\nbade four men lift me, and I shouted to them in our own tongue all\nthat the German had said. There fell a great silence, and the four\nmen let me drop to the earth between them.\n\n\"So is this the trap Ranjoor Singh would lead us into?\" said the\ntrooper nearest me, and though he spoke low, so still were we all\nthat fifty men heard him and murmured. So I spoke up.\n\nSaid I, \"We will answer when we shall have spoken again with Ranjoor\nSingh. He shall give our answer. It is right that a regiment should\nanswer through its officer, and any other course is lacking\ndiscipline!\"\n\nSahib, I have been surprised a thousand times in this war, but not\nonce more surprised than by the instant effect my answer had. It was\na random answer, made while I searched for some argument to use; but\nthe German spokesman turned at once and translated to the officers\nin uniform. Watching them very closely, I saw them laugh, and it\nseemed to me they approved my answer and disapproved some other\nmatter. I think they disapproved the civilian method of mingling\nwith us in a mob, for a moment later the order was given us in\nEnglish to fall in, and we fell in two deep. Then the civilian\nGermans drew aside and one of the officers in uniform strode toward\nthe entrance gate. We waited in utter silence, wondering what next,\nbut the officer had not been gone ten minutes when we caught sight\nof him returning with Ranjoor Singh striding along beside him.\n\nRanjoor Singh and he advanced toward us and I saw Ranjoor Singh\nspeak with him more emphatically than his usual custom. Evidently\nRanjoor Singh had his way, for the officer spoke in German to the\nothers and they all walked out of the compound in a group, leaving\nRanjoor Singh facing us. He waited until the gate clanged shut\nbehind them before he spoke.\n\n\"Well?\" said he. \"I was told the regiment asked for word with me.\nWhat is the word?\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, standing out alone before the men, not facing him,\nbut near one end of the line, so that I could raise my voice with\npropriety and all the men might hear. He backed away, to give more\neffect to that arrangement. \"Sahib,\" I said, \"we are in a trap.\nEither we go to the mines, or we fight for the Germans against the\nBritish. What is your word on the matter?\"\n\n\"Ho!\" said he. \"Is it as bad as that? As bad as that?\" said he. \"If\nye go to the mines to dig coal, they will use that coal to make\nammunition for their guns! That seems a poor alternative! They fight\nas much with ammunition as with men!\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, \"it is worse than that! They seek to compel us to\nsign a paper, forswearing our allegiance to Great Britain and\nclaiming allegiance to them! Should we sign it, that makes us out\ntraitors in the first place, and makes us amenable to their law in\nthe second place. They could shoot us if we disobeyed or demurred.\"\n\n\"They could do that in the mines,\" said he, \"if you failed to dig\nenough coal to please them. They would call it punishment for\nmalingering--or some such name. If they take it into their heads to\nhave you all shot, doubt not they will shoot!\"\n\n\"Yet in that case,\" said I, \"we should not be traitors.\"\n\n\"I will tell you a story,\" said he, and we held our breath to\nlisten, for this was his old manner. This had ever been his way of\nputting recruits at ease and of making a squadron understand. In\nthat minute, for more than a minute, men forgot they had ever\nsuspected him.\n\n\"When I was a little one,\" said he, \"my mother's aunt, who was an\nold hag, told me this tale. There was a pack of wolves that hunted\nin a forest near a village. In the village lived a man who wished to\nbe headman. Abdul was his name, and he had six sons. He wished to be\nheadman that he might levy toll among the villagers for the up-keep\nof his sons, who were hungry and very proud. Now Abdul was a cunning\nhunter, and his sons were strong. So he took thought, and chose a\nseason carefully, and set his sons to dig a great trap. And so well\nhad Abdul chosen--so craftily the six sons digged--that one night\nthey caught all that wolf-pack in the trap. And they kept them in\nthe trap two days and a night, that they might hunger and thirst and\ngrow amenable.\n\n\"Then Abdul leaned above the pit, and peered down at the wolves and\nbegan to bargain with them. 'Wolves,' said he, 'your fangs be long\nand your jaws be strong, and I wish to be headman of this village.'\nAnd they answered, 'Speak, Abdul, for these walls be high, and our\nthroats be dry, and we wish to hunt again!' So he bade them promise\nthat if he let them go they would seek and slay the present headman\nand his sons, so that he might be headman in his place. And the\nwolves promised. Then when he had made them swear by a hundred oaths\nin a hundred different ways, and had bound them to keep faith by God\nand by earth and sky and sea and by all the holy things he could\nremember, he stood aside and bade his six sons free the wolves.\n\n\"The sons obeyed, and helped the wolves out of the trap. And\ninstantly the wolves fell on all six sons, and slew and devoured\nthem. Then they came and stood round Abdul with their jaws dripping\nwith blood.\n\n\"'Oh, wolves,' said he, trembling with fear and anger, 'ye are\ntraitors! Ye are forsworn! Ye are faithless ones!'\n\n\"But they answered him, 'Oh, Abdul, shall he who knows not false\nfrom true judge treason?' and forthwith they slew him and devoured\nhim, and went about their business.\n\n\"Now, which had the right of that--Abdul or the wolves?\"\n\n\"We are no wolves!\" said Gooja Singh in a whining voice. \"We be true\nmen!\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you another story,\" Ranjoor Singh answered him.\nAnd we listened again, as men listen to the ticking of a clock.\n\"This is a story the same old woman, my mother's aunt, told me when\nI was very little.\n\n\"There was a man--and this man's name also was Abdul--who owned a\ngarden, and in it a fish-pond. But in the fish-pond were no fish.\nAbdul craved fish to swim hither and thither in his pond, but though\nhe tried times out of number he could catch none. Yet at fowling he\nhad better fortune, and when he was weary one day of fishing and\nlaid his net on land he caught a dozen birds.\n\n\"'So-ho!' said Abdul, being a man much given to thought, and he went\nabout to strike a bargain. 'Oh, birds,' said he, 'are ye willing to\nbe fish? For I have no fishes swimming in my pond, yet my heart\ndesires them greatly. So if ye are willing to be fish and will stay\nin my good pond and swim there, gladdening my eyes, I will abstain\nfrom killing you but instead will set you in the pond and let you\nlive.'\n\n\"So the birds, who were very terrified, declared themselves willing\nto be fish, and the birds swore even more oaths than he insisted on,\nso that he was greatly pleased and very confident. Therefore he used\nnot very much precaution when he came to plunge the birds into the\nwater, and the instant he let go of them the birds with feathers\nscarcely wet flew away and perched on the trees about him.\n\n\"Then Abdul grew very furious. 'Oh, birds,' said he, 'ye are\ntraitors. Ye are forsworn! Ye are liars--breakers of oaths--deceitful\nones!' And he shook his fist at them and spat, being greatly enraged\nand grieved at their deception.\n\n\"But the birds answered him, 'Oh, Abdul, a captive's gyves and a\ncaptive's oath are one, and he who rivets on the one must keep the\nother!' And the birds flew away, but Abdul went to seek his advocate\nto have the law of them! Now, what think ye was the advocate's\nopinion in the matter, and what remedy had Abdul?\"\n\nHas the sahib ever seen three hundred men all at the same time\nbecoming conscious of the same idea? That is quite a spectacle.\nThere was no whispering, nor any movement except a little shifting\nof the feet. There was nothing on which a watchful man could lay a\nfinger. Yet between one second and the next they were not the same\nmen, and I, who watched Ranjoor Singh's eyes as if he were my\nopponent in a duel, saw that he was aware of what had happened,\nalthough not surprised. But he made no sign except the shadow of one\nthat I detected, and he did not change his voice--as yet.\n\n\"As for me,\" he said, telling a tale again, \"I wrote once on the\nseashore sand and signed my name beneath. A day later I came back to\nlook, but neither name nor words remained. I was what I had been,\nand stood where the sea had been, but what I had written in sand\naffected me not, neither the sea nor any man. Thought I, if one had\nlent me money on such a perishable note the courts would now hold\nhim at fault, not me; they would demand evidence, and all he could\nshow them would be what he had himself bargained for. Now it occurs\nto me that seashore sand, and the tricks of rogues, and blackmail,\nand tyranny perhaps are one!\"\n\nEye met eye, all up and down both lines of men. There was swift\nsearching of hearts, and some of the men at my end of the line began\ntalking in low tones. So I spoke up and voiced aloud what troubled\nthem.\n\n\"If we sign this paper, sahib,\" said I, \"how do we know they will\nnot find means of bringing it to the notice of the British?\"\n\n\"We do not know,\" he answered. \"Let us hope. Hope is a great good\nthing. If they chained us, and we broke the chains, they might send\nthe broken links to London in proof of what thieves we be. Who would\ngain by that?\"\n\nI saw a very little frown now and knew that he judged it time to\nstrike on the heated metal. But Gooja Singh turned his back on\nRanjoor Singh.\n\n\"Let him sign this thing,\" said he, \"and let us sign our names\nbeneath his name. Then he will be in the same trap with us all, and\nmust lead us out of it or perish with us!\"\n\nSo Gooja Singh offered himself, all unintentionally, to be the\nscapegoat for us all and I have seldom seen a man so shocked by what\nbefell him. Only a dozen words spoke Ranjoor Singh--yet it was as if\nhe lashed him and left him naked. Whips and a good man's wrath are\none.\n\n\"Who gave thee leave to yelp?\" said he, and Gooja Singh faced about\nlike a man struck. By order of the Germans he and I stood in the\nplace of captains on parade, he on the left and I on the right.\n\n\"To your place!\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nGooja Singh stepped back into line with me, but Ranjoor Singh was\nnot satisfied.\n\n\"To your place in the rear!\" he ordered. And so I have seen a man\nwho lost a lawsuit slink round a corner of the court.\n\nThen I spoke up, being stricken with self-esteem at the sight of\nGooja Singh's shame (for I always knew him to be my enemy).\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, \"shall I pass down the line and ask each man\nwhether he will sign what the Germans ask?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said he, \"like the carrion crows at judgment! Halt!\" he\nordered, for already I had taken the first step. \"When I need to\nsend a havildar,\" said he, \"to ask my men's permission, I will call\nfor a havildar! To the rear where you belong!\" he ordered. And I\nwent round to the rear, knowing something of Gooja Singh's\nsensations, but loving him no better for the fellow-feeling. When my\nfootfall had altogether ceased and there was silence in which one\ncould have heard an insect falling to the ground, Ranjoor Singh\nspoke again. \"There has been enough talk,\" said he. \"In pursuance of\na plan, I intend to sign whatever the Germans ask. Those who prefer\nnot to sign what I sign--fall out! Fall out, I say!\"\n\nNot a man fell out, sahib. But that was not enough for Ranjoor\nSingh.\n\n\"Those who intend to sign the paper,--two paces forward,--march!\"\nsaid he. And as one man we took two paces forward.\n\n\"So!\" said he. \"Right turn!\" And we turned to the right. \"Forward!\nQuick march!\" he ordered. And he made us march twice in a square\nabout him before he halted us again and turned us to the front to\nface him. Then he was fussy about our alignment, making us take up\nour dressing half a dozen times; and when he had us to his\nsatisfaction finally he stood eying us for several minutes before\nturning his back and striding with great dignity toward the gate.\n\nHe talked through the gate and very soon a dozen Germans entered,\nled by two officers in uniform and followed by three soldiers\ncarrying a table and a chair. The table was set down in their midst,\nfacing us, and the senior German officer--in a uniform with a very\nhigh collar--handed a document to Ranjoor Singh. When he had\nfinished reading it to himself he stepped forward and read it aloud\nto us. It was in Punjabi, excellently rendered, and the gist of it\nwas like this:\n\nWe, being weary of British misrule, British hypocrisy, and British\narrogance, thereby renounced allegiance to Great Britain, its king\nand government, and begged earnestly to be permitted to fight on the\nside of the Central Empires in the cause of freedom. It was\nexpressly mentioned, I remember, that we made this petition of our\nown initiative and of our own free will, no pressure having been\nbrought to bear on us, and nothing but kindness having been offered\nus since we were taken prisoners.\n\n\"That is what we are all required to sign,\" said Ranjoor Singh, when\nhe had finished reading, and he licked his lips in a manner I had\nnever seen before.\n\nWithout any further speech to us, he sat down at the table and wrote\nhis name with a great flourish on the paper, setting down his rank\nbeside his name. Then he called to me, and I sat and wrote my name\nbelow his, adding my rank also. And Gooja Singh followed me. After\nhim, in single file, came every surviving man of Outram's Own. Some\nmen scowled, and some men laughed harshly, and if one of our race\nhad been watching on the German behalf he would have been able to\ntell them something. But the Germans mistook the scowls for signs of\nanger at the British, and the laughter they mistook for rising\nspirits, so that the whole affair passed off without arousing their\nsuspicion.\n\nNevertheless, my heart warned me that the Germans would not trust a\nregiment seduced as we were supposed to have been. And, although\nRanjoor Singh had had his way with us, the very having had destroyed\nthe reawakening trust in him. The troopers felt that he had led them\nthrough the gates of treason. I could feel their thoughts as a man\nfeels the breath of coming winter on his cheek.\n\nWhen the last man had signed we stood at attention and a wagonload\nof rifles was brought in, drawn by oxen. They gave a rifle to each\nof us, and we were made to present arms while the German military\noath was read aloud. After that the Germans walked away as if they\nhad no further interest. Only Ranjoor Singh remained, and he gave us\nno time just then for comment or discontent.\n\nThe mauser rifles were not so very much unlike our own, and he set\nus to drilling with them, giving us patient instruction but very\nlittle rest until evening. During the longest pause in the drill he\nsent for knapsacks and served us one each, filled down to the\nsmallest detail with everything a soldier could need, even to a\nlittle cup that hung from a hook beneath one corner. We were utterly\nworn out when he left us at nightfall, but there was a lot of\ntalking nevertheless before men fell asleep.\n\n\"This is the second time he has trapped us in deadly earnest!\" was\nthe sum of the general complaint they hurled at me. And I had no\nanswer to give them, knowing well that if I took his part I should\nshare his condemnation--which would not help him; neither would it\nhelp them nor me.\n\n\"My thought, of going to the mines and being troublesome, was best!\"\nsaid I. \"Ye overruled me. Now ye would condemn me for not preventing\nyou! Ye are wind blowing this way and that!\"\n\nThey were so busy defending themselves to themselves against that\ncharge that they said no more until sleep fell on them; and at dawn\nRanjoor Singh took hold of us again and made us drill until our feet\nburned on the gravel and our ears were full of the tramp--tramp--tramp,\nand the ek--do--tin of manual exercise.\n\n\"Listen!\" said he to me, when he had dismissed us for dinner, and I\nlingered on parade. \"Caution the men that any breach of discipline\nwould be treated under German military law by drum-head court\nmartial and sentence of death by shooting. Advise them to avoid\nindiscretions of any kind,\" said he.\n\nSo I passed among them, pretending the suggestion was my own, and\nthey resented it, as I knew they would. But I observed from about\nthat time they began to look on Ranjoor Singh as their only possible\nprotector against the Germans, so that their animosity against him\nwas offset by self-interest.\n\nThe next day came a staff officer who marched us to the station,\nwhere a train was waiting. Impossible though it may seem, sahib, to\nyou who listen, I felt sad when I looked back at the huts that had\nbeen our prison, and I think we all did. We had loathed them with\nall our hearts all summer long, but now they represented what we\nknew and we were marching away from them to what we knew not, with\nautumn and winter brooding on our prospects.\n\nNot all our wounded had been returned to us; some had died in the\nGerman hospitals.. Two hundred-and-three-and-thirty of us all told,\nincluding Ranjoor Singh, lined up on the station platform--fit and\nwell and perhaps a little fatter than was seemly.\n\nHaving no belongings other than the rifles and knapsacks and what we\nstood in it took us but a few moments to entrain. Almost at once the\nengine whistled and we were gone, wondering whither. Some of the\ntroopers shouted to Ranjoor Singh to ask our destination, but he\naffected not to hear. The German staff officer rode in the front\ncompartment alone, and Ranjoor Singh rode alone in the next behind\nhim; but they conversed often through the window, and at stations\nwhere the two of them got out to stretch their legs along the\nplatform they might have been brothers-in-blood relating love-affairs.\nOur troopers wondered.\n\n\"Our fox grows gray,\" said they, \"and his impudence increases.\"\n\n\"Would it help us out of this predicament,\" said I, \"if he smote\nthat German in the teeth and spat on him?\"\n\nThey laughed at that and passed the remark along from window to\nwindow, until I roared at them to keep their heads in. There were\nseven of us non-commissioned officers, and we rode in one\ncompartment behind the officers' carriage, Gooja Singh making much\nunpleasantness because there was not enough room for us all to lie\nfull length at once. We were locked into our compartment, and the\nonly chance we had of speaking with Ranjoor Singh was when they\nbrought us food at stations and he strode down the train to see that\neach man had his share.\n\n\"What is our destination?\" we asked him then, repeatedly.\n\n\"If ye be true men,\" he answered, \"why are ye troubled about\ndestination? Can the truth lead you into error? Do I seem afraid?\"\nsaid he.\n\nThat was answer enough if we had been the true men we claimed to be,\nand he gave us no other. So we watched the sun and tried to guess\nroughly, I recalling all the geography I ever knew, yet failing to\nreach conclusions that satisfied myself or any one. We knew that\nTurkey was in the war, and we knew that Bulgaria was not. Yet we\ntraveled eastward, and southeastward.\n\nI know now that we traveled over the edge of Germany into Austria,\nthrough Austria into Hungary, and through a great part of Hungary to\nthe River Danube, growing so weary of the train that I for one\nlooked back to the Flanders trenches as to long-lost happiness!\nEvery section of line over which we traveled was crowded with\ntraffic, and dozens of German regiments kept passing and re-passing\nus. Some cheered us and some were insulting, but all of them\nregarded us with more or less astonishment.\n\nThe Austrians were more openly curious about us than the Germans had\nbeen, and some of them tried to get into conversation, but this was\nnot encouraged; when they climbed on the footboards to peer through\nthe windows and ask us questions officers ordered them away.\n\nOf all the things we wondered at on that long ride, the German\nregiments impressed us most. Those that passed and repassed us were\nmostly artillery and infantry, and surely in all the world before\nthere never were such regiments as those--with the paint worn off\ntheir cannon, and their clothes soiled, yet with an air about them\nof successful plunderers, confident to the last degree of arrogance\nin their own efficiency--not at all like British regiments, nor like\nany others that I ever saw. It was Ranjoor Singh who drew my\nattention to the fact that regiments passing us in one direction\nwould often pass us again on their way back, sometimes within the\nday.\n\n\"As shuttles in a loom!\" said he. \"As long as they can do that they\ncan fight on a dozen fronts.\" His words set me wondering so that I\ndid not answer him. He was speaking through our carriage window and\nI stared out beyond him at a train-load of troops on the far side of\nthe station.\n\n\"One comes to us,\" said I. I was watching a German sergeant, who had\ndragged his belongings from that train and was crossing toward us.\n\n\"Aye!\" said Ranjoor Singh, so that I knew now there had been purpose\nin his visit. \"Beware of him.\" Then he unlocked the carriage door\nand waited for the German. The German came, and cursed the man who\nbore his baggage, and halted before Ranjoor Singh, staring into his\nface with a manner of impudence new to me. Ranjoor Singh spoke about\nten words to him in German and the sergeant there and then saluted\nvery respectfully. I noticed that the German staff officer was\nwatching all this from a little distance, and I think the sergeant\ncaught his eye.\n\nAt any rate, the sergeant made his man throw the baggage through our\ncompartment door. The man returned to the other train. The sergeant\nclimbed in next to me. Ranjoor Singh locked the door again, and both\ntrains proceeded. When our train was beginning to gain speed the\nnewcomer shoved me in the ribs abruptly with his elbow--thus.\n\n\"So much for knowing languages!\" said he to me in fairly good\nPunjabi. \"Curse the day I ever saw India, and triple-curse this\nsystem of ours that enabled them to lay finger on me in a moving\ntrain and transfer me to this funeral procession! Curse you, and\ncurse this train, and curse all Asia!\" Then he thrust me in the ribs\nagain, as if that were a method of setting aside formality.\n\n\"You know Cawnpore?\" said he, and I nodded.\n\n\"You know the Kaiser-i-hind Saddle Factory?\"\n\nI nodded again, being minded to waste no words because of Ranjoor\nSingh's warning.\n\n\"I took a job as foreman there twenty years ago because the pay was\ngood. I lived there fifteen years until I was full to the throat of\nIndia--Indian food, Indian women, Indian drinks, Indian heat, Indian\nsmells, Indian everything. I hated it, and threw up the job in the\nend. Said I to myself, 'Thank God,' said I, 'to see the last of\nIndia.' And I took passage on a German steamer and drank enough\nGerman beer on the way to have floated two ships her size! Aecht\nDeutches bier, you understand,\" said he, nudging me in the ribs with\neach word. Aecht means REAL, as distinguished from the export stuff\nin bottles. \"I drank it by the barrel, straight off ice, and it went\nto my head!\n\n\"That must be why I boasted about knowing Indian languages before I\nhad been two hours in port. I was drunk, and glad to be home, and on\nthe lookout for another job to keep from starving; so I boasted I\ncould speak and write Urdu and Punjabi. That brought me employment\nin an export house. But who would have guessed it would end in my\nbeing dragged away from my regiment to march with a lot of Sikhs?\nEh? Who would have guessed it? There goes my regiment one way, and\nhere go I another! What's our destination? God knows! Who are you,\nand what are you? God neither knows nor cares! What's to be the end\nof this? The end of me, I expect--and all because I got drunk on the\nway home! It I get alive out of this,\" said he, \"I'll get drunk once\nfor the glory of God and then never touch beer again!\"\n\nAnd he struck me on the thigh with his open palm. The noise was like\npowder detonating, and the pain was acute. I cursed him in his teeth\nand he grinned at me as if he and I were old friends. Little blue\neyes he had, sahib--light blue, set in full red cheeks. There were\nmany little red veins crisscrossed under the skin of his face, and\nhis breath smelt of beer and tobacco. I judged he had the physical\nstrength of a buffalo, although doubtless short of wind.\n\nHe had very little hair. Such as he had was yellow, but clipped so\nshort that it looked white. His yellow mustache was turned up thus\nat either corner of his mouth; and the mouth was not unkind, not\nwithout good humor.\n\n\"What is your name?\" said I.\n\n\"Tugendheim,\" said he. \"I am Sergeant Fritz Tugendheim, of the 281\n(Pappenheim) Regiment of Infantry, and would God I were with my\nregiment! What do they call you?\"\n\n\"Hira Singh,\" said I.\n\n\"And your rank?\"\n\n\"Havildar,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh-ho!\" said he. \"So you're all non-commissioned in here, are you?\nSeven of you, eh? Seven is a lucky number! Well---\" He looked us\neach slowly in the face, narrowing his eyes so that we could\nscarcely see them under the yellow lashes. \"Well,\" said he, \"they\nwon't mistake me for any of you, nor any of you for me--not even if\nI should grow whiskers!\"\n\nHe laughed at that joke for about two minutes, slapping me on the\nthigh again and laughing all the louder when I showed my teeth. Then\nhe drew out a flask of some kind of pungent spirits from his pocket,\nand offered it to me. When I refused he drank the whole of it\nhimself and flung the glass flask through the window. Then he\nsettled himself in the corner from which he had ousted me, put his\nfeet on the edge of the seat opposite, and prepared to sleep. But\nbefore very long our German staff officer shouted for him and he\nwent in great haste, a station official opening the door for him and\nlocking us in again afterward. He rode for hours with the staff\nofficer and Gooja Singh examined the whole of his kit, making\nremarks on each piece, to the great amusement of us all.\n\nHe came back before night to sleep in our compartment, but before he\ncame I had taken opportunity to pass word through the window to the\ntroopers in the carriage next behind.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh,\" said I, \"warns us all to be on guard against this\nGerman. He is a spy set to overhear our talk.\"\n\nThat word went all down the train from, window to window and it had\nsome effect, for during all the days that followed Tugendheim was\nnever once able to get between us and our thoughts, although he\ntried a thousand times.\n\nNight followed day, and day night. Our train crawled, and waited,\nand crawled, and waited, and we in our compartment grew weary to the\ndeath of Tugendheim. A thousand times I envied Ranjoor Singh alone\nwith his thoughts in the next compartment; and so far was he from\nsuffering because of solitude that he seemed to keep more and more\napart from us, only passing swiftly down the train at meal-times to\nmake sure we all had enough to eat and that there were no sick.\n\nI reached the conclusion myself that we were being sent to fight\nagainst the Russians, and I know not what the troopers thought; they\nwere beginning to be like caged madmen. But suddenly we reached a\nbroad river I knew must be the Danube and were allowed at last to\nleave the train. We were so glad to move about again that any news\nseemed good news, and when Ranjoor Singh, after much talk with our\nstaff officer and some other Germans, came and told us that Bulgaria\nhad joined the war on the side of the Central Powers, we laughed and\napplauded.\n\n\"That means that our road lies open before us,\" Ranjoor Singh said\ndarkly.\n\n\"Our road whither?\" said I.\n\n\"To Stamboul!\" said he.\n\n\"What are we to do at Stamboul?\" asked Gooja Singh, and the staff\nofficer, whose name I never knew, heard him and came toward us.\n\n\"At Stamboul,\" said he, in fairly good Punjabi, \"you will strike a\nblow beside our friends, the Turks. Not very far from Stamboul you\nshall be given opportunity for vengeance on the British. The\nnext-to-the-last stage of your journey lies through Bulgaria, and the\nbeginning of it will be on that steamer.\"\n\nWe saw the steamer, lying with its nose toward the bank. It was no\nvery big one for our number, but they marched us to it, Ranjoor\nSingh striding at our head as if all the world were unfolding before\nhim, and all were his. We were packed on board and the steamer\nstarted at once, Ranjoor Singh and the staff officer sharing the\nupper part with the steamer's captain, and Tugendheim elbowing us\nfor room on the open deck. So we journeyed for a whole day and part\nof a night down the Danube, Tugendheim pointing out to me things I\nshould observe along the route, but grumbling vastly at separation\nfrom his regiment.\n\n\"You bloody Sikhs!\" said he. \"I would rather march with lice--yet\nwhat can I do? I must obey orders. See that castle!\" There were many\ncastles, sahib, at bends and on hilltops overlooking the river.\n\"They built that,\" said he, \"in the good old days before men ever\nheard of Sikhs. Life was worth while in those days, and a man lived\na lifetime with his regiment!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, choosing not to take offense; for one fool can make\ntrouble that perhaps a thousand wise men can not still. If he had\nthought, he must have known that we Sikhs spend a lifetime with our\nregiments, and therefore know more about such matters than any\nGerman reservist. But he was little given to thought, although not\nill-humored in intention.\n\n\"Behold that building!\" said he. \"That looks like a brewery!\nConsider the sea of beer they brew there once a month, and then\nthink of your oath of abstinence and what you miss!\"\n\nSo he talked, ever nudging me in the ribs until I grew sore and my\nvery gorge revolted at his foolishness. So we sailed, passing along\na river that at another time would have delighted me beyond power of\nspeech. A day and a night we sailed, our little steamer being one of\na fleet all going one way. Tugs and tugs and tugs there were, all\npulling strings of barges. It was as if all the tugs and barges out\nof Austria were hurrying with all the plunder of Europe God knew\nwhither.\n\n\"Whither are they taking all this stuff?\" I asked Ranjoor Singh when\nhe came down among us to inspect our rations. He and I stood\ntogether at the stern, and I waved my arm to designate the fleet of\nfloating things. We were almost the only troops, although there were\nsoldiers here and there on the tugs and barges, taking charge and\nsupervising.\n\n\"To Stamboul,\" said he. \"Bulgaria is in. The road to Stamboul is\nopen.\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, \"I know you are true to the raj. I know the\nsurrender in Flanders was the only course possible for one to whom\nthe regiment had been entrusted. I know this business of taking the\nGerman side is all pretense. Are we on the way to Stamboul?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said he.\n\n\"What are we to do at Stamboul?\" I asked him.\n\n\"If you know all you say you know,\" said he, \"why let the future\ntrouble you?\"\n\n\"But---\" said I.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"there can be no 'but.' There is false and true. The\none has no part in the other. What say the men?\"\n\n\"They are true to the raj,\" said I.\n\n\"All of them?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, sahib,\" said I. \"Not quite all of them, but almost all.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"We shall discover before long which are false and which\nare true,\" said he, and then he left me.\n\nSo I told the men that we were truly on our way to Stamboul, and\nthere began new wondering and new conjecturing. The majority decided\nat once that we were to be sent to Gallipoli to fight beside the\nTurks in the trenches there, and presently they all grew very\ndetermined to put no obstacle in the Germans' way but to go to\nGallipoli with good will. Once there, said they all, it should be\neasy to cross to the British trenches under cover of the darkness.\n\n\"We will take Ranjoor Singh with us,\" they said darkly. \"Then he can\nmake explanation of his conduct in the proper time and place!\" I saw\none man hold his turban end as if it were a bandage over his eyes,\nand several others snapped their fingers to suggest a firing party.\nMany of the others laughed. Men in the dark, thought I, are fools to\ndo anything but watch and listen. Outlines change with the dawn,\nthought I, and I determined to reserve my judgment on all points\nexcept one--that I set full faith in Ranjoor Singh. But the men for\nthe most part had passed judgment and decided on a plan; so it came\nabout that there was no trouble in the matter of getting them to\nStamboul--or Constantinople, as Europeans call it.\n\nAt a place in Bulgaria whose name I have forgotten we disembarked\nand became escort to a caravan of miscellaneous stores, proceeding\nby forced marches over an abominable road. And after I forget how\nmany days and nights we reached a railway and were once more packed\ninto a train. Throughout that march, although we traversed wild\ncountry where any or all of us might easily have deserted among the\nmountains, Ranjoor Singh seemed so well to understand our intention\nthat he scarcely troubled himself to call the roll. He sat alone by\na little fire at night, and slept beside it wrapped in an overcoat\nand blanket. And when we boarded a train again he was once more\nalone in a compartment to himself. Once more I was compelled to sit\nnext to Tugendheim.\n\nI grew no fonder of Tugendheim, although he made many efforts to\nconvince me of his friendship, making many prophetic statements to\nencourage me.\n\n\"Soon,\" said he, \"you shall have your bayonet in the belly of an\nEnglishman! You will be revenged im them for '57!\" My grandfather\nfought for the British in '57, sahib, and my father, who was little\nmore than old enough to run, carried food to him where he lay on the\nRidge before Delhi, the British having little enough food at that\ntime to share among their friends. But I said nothing, and\nTugendheim thought I was impressed--as indeed I was. \"You will need\nto fight like the devil,\" said he, \"for if they catch you they'll\nskin you!\"\n\nPartly he wished to discover what my thoughts were, and partly, I\nthink, his intention was to fill me with fighting courage; and,\nsince it would not have done to keep silence altogether, I began to\nproject the matter further and to talk of what might be after the\nwar should have been won. I made him believe that the hope of all us\nSikhs was to seek official employment under the German government;\nand he made bold to prophesy a good job for every one of us. We\nspent hours discussing what nature of employment would best be\nsuited to our genius, and he took opportunity at intervals to go to\nthe staff officer and acquaint him with all that I had said. By the\ntime we reached Stamboul at last I was more weary of him than an\nill-matched bullock of its yoke.\n\nBut we did reach Stamboul in the end, on a rainy morning, and\nmarched wondering through its crooked streets, scarcely noticed by\nthe inhabitants. Men seemed afraid to look long at us, but glanced\nonce swiftly and passed on. German officers were everywhere, many of\nthem driven in motor-cars at great speed through narrow\nthoroughfares, scattering people to right and left; the Turkish\nofficers appeared to treat them with very great respect--although I\nnoticed here and there a few who looked indifferent, and\noccasionally others who seemed to me indignant.\n\nThe mud, though not so bad as that in Flanders, was nearly as\ndepressing. The rain chilled the air, and shut in the view, and few\nof us had very much sense of direction that first day in Stamboul.\nTugendheim, marching behind us, kept up an incessant growl. Ranjoor\nSingh, striding in front of us with the staff officer at his side,\nshook the rain from his shoulders and said nothing.\n\nWe were marched to a ferry and taken across what I know now was the\nGolden Horn; and there was so much mist on the water that at times\nwe could scarcely see the ferry. Many troopers asked me if we were\nnot already on our way to Gallipoli, and I, knowing no more than\nthey, bade them wait and see.\n\nOn the other side of the Golden Horn we were marched through narrow\nstreets, uphill, uphill, uphill to a very great barrack and given a\nsection of it to ourselves. Ranjoor Singh was assigned private\nquarters in a part of the building used by many German officers for\ntheir mess. Not knowing our tongue, those officers were obliged to\nconverse with him in English, and I observed many times with what\ndistaste they did so, to my great amusement. I think Ranjoor Singh\nwas also much amused by that, for he grew far better humored and\nreadier to talk.\n\nSahib, that barrack was like a zoo--like the zoo I saw once at\nBaroda, with animals of all sorts in it!--a great yellow building\nwithin walls, packed with Kurds and Arabs and Syrians of more\ndifferent tribes than a man would readily believe existed in the\nwhole world. Few among them could talk any tongue that we knew, but\nthey were full of curiosity and crowded round us to ask questions;\nand when Gooja Singh shouted aloud that we were Sikhs from India\nthey produced a man who seemed to think he knew about Sikhs, for he\nstood on a step and harangued them for ten minutes, they listening\nwith all their ears.\n\nThen came a Turk from the German officers' mess--we were all\nstanding in the rain in an open court between four walls--and he\ntold them truly who we were. Doubtless he added that we were in\nrevolt against the British, for they began to welcome us, shouting\nand dancing about us, those who could come near enough taking our\nhands and saying things we could not understand.\n\nPresently they found a man who knew some English, and, urged by\nthem, he began to fill our ears with information. During our train\njourney I had amused myself for many weary hours by asking\nTugendheim for details of the fighting he had seen and by listening\nto the strings of lies he thought fit to narrate. But what\nTugendheim had told were almost truths compared to this man's\nstories; in place of Tugendheim's studied vagueness there was detail\nin such profusion that I can not recall now the hundredth part of\nit.\n\nHe told us the British fleet had long been rusting at the bottom of\nthe sea, and that all the British generals and half the army were\nprisoners in Berlin. Already the British were sending tribute money\nto their conquerors, and the principal reason why the war continued\nwas that the British could not find enough donkeys to carry all the\ngold to Berlin, and to prevent trickery of any kind the fighting\nmust continue until the last coin should have been counted.\n\nThe British and French, he told us, were all to be compelled, at the\npoint of the sword, to turn Muhammadan, and France was being scoured\nthat minute for women to grace the harems of the kaiser and his sons\nand generals, all of whom had long ago accepted Islam. The kaiser,\nindeed, had become the new chief of Islam.\n\nI asked him about the fighting in Gallipoli, and lie said that was a\nbagatelle. \"When we shall have driven the remnants of those there\ninto the sea,\" said he, \"one part of us will march to conquer Egypt\nand the rest will be sent to garrison England and France.\"\n\nWhen he had done and we were all under cover at last I repeated to\nthe men all that this fool had said, and they were very much\nencouraged; for they reasoned that if the Turks and Germans needed\nto fill up their men with such lies as those, then they must have a\npoor case indeed. With our coats off, and a meal before us, and the\nmud and rain for-gotten, we all began to feel almost happy; and\nwhile we were in that mood Ranjoor Singh came to us with Tugendheim\nat his heels.\n\n\"The plan now is to keep us here a week,\" said he. \"After that to\nsend us to Gallipoli by steamer.\"\n\nSahib, there was uproar! Men could scarcely eat for the joy of\ngetting in sight of British lines again--or rather for joy of the\npromise of it. They almost forgot to suspect Ranjoor Singh in that\nminute, but praised him to his face and even made much of\nTugendheim.\n\nBut I, who followed Ranjoor Singh between the tables in case he\nshould have any orders to give, noticed particularly that he did not\nsay we were going to Gallipoli. He said, \"The plan now is to send us\nto Gallipoli.\" The trade of a leader of squadrons, thought I, is to\nconfound the laid plans of the enemy and to invent unexpected ones\nof his own.\n\n\"The day we land in Gallipoli behind the Turkish trenches,\" said I\nto myself, \"is unlikely to be yet if Ranjoor Singh lives.\"\n\nAnd I was right, sahib. But If I had been given a thousand years in\nwhich to do it, I never could have guessed how Ranjoor Singh would\nlead us out of the trap. Can the sahib guess?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFear comes and goes, but a man's love lives with him.--EASTERN PROVERB.\n\n\nStamboul was disillusionment--a city of rain and plagues and stinks!\nThe food in barracks was maggoty. We breathed foul air and yearned\nfor the streets; yet, once in the streets, we yearned to be back in\nbarracks. Aye, sahib, we saw more in one day of the streets than we\nthought good for us, none yet understanding the breadth of Ranjoor\nSingh's wakefulness. He seemed to us like a man asleep in good\nopinion of himself--that being doubtless the opinion he wished the\nGerman officers to have of him.\n\nPart of the German plan became evident at once, for, noticing our\ngreat enthusiasm at the prospect of being sent to Gallipoli,\nTugendheim, in the hope of winning praise, told a German officer we\nought to be paraded through the streets as evidence that Indian\ntroops really were fighting with the Central Powers. The German\nofficer agreed instantly, Tugendheim making faces thus and brushing\nhis mustache more fiercely upward.\n\nSo the very first morning after our arrival we were paraded early\nand sent out with a negro band, to tramp back and forth through the\nstreets until nearly too weary to desire life. Ranjoor Singh marched\nat our head looking perfectly contented, for which the men all hated\nhim, and beside him went a Turk who knew English and who told him\nthe names of streets and places.\n\nIt did not escape my observation that Ranjoor Singh was interested\nmore than a little in the waterfront. But we all tramped like dumb\nmen, splashed to the waist with street dirt, aware we were being\nused to make a mental impression on the Turks, but afraid to refuse\nobedience lest we be not sent to Gallipoli after all. One thought\nobsessed every single man but me: To get to Gallipoli, and escape to\nthe British trenches during some dark night, or perish in the\neffort.\n\nAs for me, I kept open mind and watched. It is the non-commissioned\nofficer's affair to herd the men for his officer to lead. To have\nargued with them or have suggested alternative possibilities would\nhave been only to enrage them and make them deaf to wise counsels\nwhen the proper time should come. And, besides, I knew no more what\nRanjoor Singh had in mind than a dead man knows of the weather. We\nmarched through the streets, and marched, stared at silently,\nneither cheered nor mocked by the inhabitants; and Ranjoor Singh\narrived at his own conclusions. Five several times during that one\nday he halted us in the mud at a certain place along the water-front,\nalthough there was a better place near by; and while we\nrested he asked peculiar questions, and the Turk boasted to him,\nexplaining many things.\n\nWe were exhausted when it fell dark and we climbed up the hill again\nto barracks. Yet as we entered the barrack gate I heard Ranjoor\nSingh tell a German officer in English that we had all greatly\nenjoyed our view of the city and the exercise. I repeated what I had\nheard while the men were at supper, and they began to wonder\ngreatly.\n\n\"Such a lie!\" said they.\n\n\"That surely was a lie?\" I asked, and they answered that the man who\ntruly had enjoyed such tramping to and fro was no soldier but a\nmud-fish.\n\n\"Then, if he lies to them,\" I said, \"perhaps he tells us the truth\nafter all.\"\n\nThey howled at me, calling me a man without understanding. Yet when\nI went away I left them thinking, each man for himself, and that was\ngood. I went to change the guard, for some of our men were put on\nsentry-go that night outside the officers' quarters, in spite of our\nutter weariness. We were smarter than the Kurds, and German officers\nlike smartness.\n\nWeary though Ranjoor Singh must have been, he sat late with the\nGerman officers, for the most part keeping silence while they\ntalked. I made excuse to go and speak with him half a dozen times,\nand the last time I could hardly find him among the wreaths of\ncigarette smoke.\n\n\"Sahib, must we really stay a week in this hole?\" I asked. \"So say\nthe Germans,\" said he.\n\n\"Are we to be paraded through the streets each day?\" I asked.\n\n\"I understand that to be the plan,\" he answered.\n\n\"Then the men will mutiny!\" said I.\n\n\"Nay!\" said he, \"let them seek better cause than that!\"\n\n\"Shall I tell them so?\" said I, and he looked into my eyes through\nthe smoke as if he would read down into my very heart.\n\n\"Aye!\" said he at last. \"You may tell them so!\"\n\nSo I went and shook some of the men awake and told them, and when\nthey had done being angry they laughed at me. Then those awoke the\nothers, and soon they all had the message. On the whole, it\nbewildered them, even as it did me, so that few dared offer an\nopinion and each began thinking for himself again. By morning they\nwere in a mood to await developments. They were even willing to\ntramp the streets; but Ranjoor Singh procured us a day's rest. He\nhimself spent most of the day with the German officers, poring over\nmaps and talking. I went to speak with him as often as I could\ninvent excuse, and I became familiar with the word Wassmuss that\nthey used very frequently. I heard the word so many times that I\ncould not forget it if I tried.\n\nThe next day Ranjoor Singh had a surprise for us. At ten in the\nmorning we were all lined up in the rain and given a full month's\npay. It was almost midday when the last man had received his money,\nand when we were dismissed and the men filed in to dinner Ranjoor\nSingh bade me go among them and ask whether they did not wish\nopportunity to spend their money.\n\nSo I went and asked the question. Only a few said yes. Many\npreferred to keep their money against contingencies, and some\nthought the question was a trick and refused to answer it at all. I\nreturned to Ranjoor Singh and told him what they answered.\n\n\"Go and ask them again!\" said he.\n\nSo I went among them again as they lay on the cots after dinner, and\nmost of them jeered at me for my pains. I went and found Ranjoor\nSingh in the officers' mess and told him.\n\n\"Ask them once more!\" said he.\n\nThis third time, being in no mood to endure mockery, I put the\nquestion with an air of mystery. They asked what the hidden meaning\nmight be, but I shook my head and repeated the question with a\nsmile, as if I knew indeed but would not tell.\n\n\"Says Ranjoor Singh,\" said I, \"would the men like opportunity to\nspend their money?\"\n\n\"No!\" said most of them, and Gooja Singh asked how long it well\nmight be before we should see money again.\n\n\"Shall I bear him, a third time, such an answer?\" I asked, looking\nmore mysterious than ever. And just then it happened that Gooja\nSingh remembered the advice to seek better cause for mutiny. He\ndrummed on his teeth with his fingernails.\n\n\"Very well!\" said he. \"Tell him we will either spend our money or\nlet blood! Let us see what he says to that!\"\n\n\"Shall I say,\" said I, \"that Gooja Singh says so?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said he, growing anxious. \"Let that be the regiment's\nanswer. Name no names!\"\n\nI thought it a foolish answer, given by a fool, but the men were in\nthe mood to relish it and began to laugh exceedingly.\n\n\"Shall I take that answer?\" said I, and they answered \"Yes!\"\nredoubling their emphasis when I objected. \"The Germans do Ranjoor\nSingh's thinking for him these days,\" said one man; \"take that\nanswer and let us see what the Germans have to say to it through his\nmouth!\"\n\nSo I went and told Ranjoor Singh, whispering to him in a corner of\nthe officers' mess. Some Turks had joined the Germans and most of\nthem were bending over maps that a German officer had spread upon a\ntable in their midst; he was lecturing while the others listened.\nRanjoor Singh had been listening, too, but he backed into a corner\nas I entered, and all the while I was whispering to him I kept\nhearing the word Wassmuss--Wassmuss--Wassmuss. The German who was\nlecturing explained something about this Wassmuss.\n\n\"What is Wassmuss?\" I asked, when I had given Ranjoor Singh the\nmen's answer. He smiled into my eyes.\n\n\"Wassmuss is the key to the door,\" said he.\n\n\"To which door?\" I asked him.\n\n\"There is only one,\" he answered.\n\n\"Shall I tell that to the men?\" said I.\n\nAt that he began scowling at me, stroking his beard with one hand.\nThen he stepped back and forth a time or two. And when he saw with\nthe corner of his eye that he had the senior German officer's\nattention he turned on me and glared again. There was sudden silence\nin the room, and I stood at attention, striving to look like a man\nof wood.\n\n\"It is as I said,\" said he in English. \"It was most unwise to pay\nthem. Now the ruffians demand liberty to go and spend--and that\nmeans license! They have been prisoners of war in close confinement\ntoo long. You should have sent them to Gallipoli before they tasted\nmoney or anything else but work! Who shall control such men now!\"\n\nThe German officer stroked his chin, eying Ranjoor Singh sternly,\nyet I thought irresolutely.\n\n\"If they would be safer on board a steamer, that can be managed. A\nsteamer came in to-day, that would do,\" said he, speaking in\nEnglish, perhaps lest the Turks understand. \"And there is\nTugendheim, of course. Tugendheim could keep watch on board.\"\n\nI think he had more to say, but at that minute Ranjoor Singh chose\nto turn on me fiercely and order me out of the room.\n\n\"Tell them what you have heard!\" he said in Punjabi, as if he were\nbiting my head off, and I expect the German officer believed he had\ncursed me. I saluted and ran, and one of the Turkish officers aimed\na kick at me as I passed. It was by the favor of God that the kick\nmissed, for had he touched me I would have torn his throat out, and\nthen doubtless I should not have been here to tell what Ranjoor\nSingh did. To this day I do not know whether he had every move\nplanned out in his mind, or whether part was thinking and part good\nfortune. When a good man sets himself to thinking, God puts thoughts\ninto his heart that others can not overcome, and it may be that he\nsimply prayed. I know not--although I know he prayed often, as a\ntrue Sikh should.\n\nI told the men exactly what had passed, except that I did not say\nRanjoor Singh had bidden me do so. I gave them to understand that I\nwas revealing a secret, and that gave them greater confidence in my\nloyalty to them. It was important they should not suspect me of\nallegiance to Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"It is good!\" said they all, after a lot of talking and very little\nthought. \"To be sent on board a steamer could only mean Gallipoli.\nThere we will make great show of ferocity and bravery, so that they\nwill send us to the foremost trenches. It should be easy to steal\nacross by night to the British trenches, dragging Ranjoor Singh with\nus, and when we are among friends again let him give what account of\nhimself he may! What new shame is this, to tell the Germans we will\nmake trouble because we have a little money at last! Let the shame\nreturn to roost on him!\"\n\nThey began to make ready there and then, and while they packed the\nknapsacks I urged them to shout and laugh as if growing mutinous.\nSoldiers, unless prevented, load themselves like pack animals with a\nhundred unnecessary things, but none of us had more than the full\nkit for each man that the Germans had served out, so that packing\ntook no time at all. An hour after we were ready came Ranjoor Singh,\nstanding in the door of our quarters with that senior German officer\nbeside him, both of them scowling at us, and the German making more\nthan a little show of possessing a repeating pistol. So that Gooja\nSingh made great to-do about military compliments, rebuking several\ntroopers in loud tones for not standing quickly to attention, and\nshouting to me to be more strict. I let him have his say.\n\nAngrily as a gathering thunder-storm Ranjoor Singh ordered us to\nfall in, and we scrambled out through the doorway like a pack of\nhunting hounds released. No word was spoken to us by way of\nexplanation, Ranjoor Singh continuing to scowl with folded arms\nwhile the German officer went back to look the quarters over,\nperhaps to see whether we had done damage, or perhaps to make\ncertain nothing had been left. He came out in a minute or two and\nthen we were marched out of the barrack in the dimming light, with\nTugendheim in full marching order falling into step behind us and\nthe senior German officer smoking a cigar beside Ranjoor Singh. A\nKurdish soldier carried Tugendheim's bag of belongings, and\nTugendheim kicked him savagely when he dropped it in a pool of mud.\nI thought the Kurd would knife him, but he refrained.\n\nI think I have said, sahib, that the weather was vile. We were glad\nof our overcoats. As we marched along the winding road downhill we\nkept catching glimpses of the water-front through driving rain,\nlight after light appearing as the twilight gathered. Nobody noticed\nus. There seemed to be no one in the streets, and small wonder!\n\nBefore we were half-way down toward the water there began to be a\nvery great noise of firing, of big and little cannon and rifles.\nThere began to be shouting, and men ran back and forth below us. I\nasked Tugendheim what it all might mean, and he said probably a\nBritish submarine had shown itself. I whispered that to the nearest\nmen and they passed the word along. Great contentment grew among us,\nnone caring after that for rain and mud. That was the nearest we had\nbeen to friends in oh how many months--if it truly were a British\nsubmarine!\n\nWe reached the water-front presently and were brought to a halt in\nexactly the place where Ranjoor Singh had halted us those five times\non the day we tramped the streets. We faced a dock that had been\nvacant two days ago, but where now a little steamer lay moored with\nropes, smoke coming from its funnel. There was no other sign of\nlife, but when the German officer shouted about a dozen times the\nTurkish captain came ashore, wrapped in a great shawl, and spoke to\nhim.\n\nWhile they two spoke I asked Ranjoor Singh whether that truly had\nbeen a British submarine, and he nodded; but he was not able to tell\nme whether or not it had been hit by gun-fire. Some of the men\noverheard, and although we all knew that our course to Gallipoli\nwould be the more hazardous in that event we all prayed that the\nartillery might have missed. Fear comes and goes, but a man's love\nlives in him.\n\nWhen the Turkish captain and the German officer finished speaking,\nthe Turk went back to his steamer without any apparent pleasure, and\nwe were marched up the gangway after him. It was pitch-dark by that\ntime and the only light was that of a lantern by which the German\nofficer stood, eying us one by one as we passed. Tugendheim came\nlast, and he talked with Tugendheim for several minutes. Then he\nwent away, but presently returned with, I should say, half a company\nof Kurdish soldiers, whom he posted all about the dock. Then he\ndeparted finally, with a wave of his cigar, as much as to say that\nsheet of the ledger had been balanced.\n\nIt was a miserable steamer, sahib. We stood about on iron decks and\ngrew hungry. There were no awnings--nothing but the superstructure\nof the bridge, and, although there were but two-hundred-and-thirty-four\nof us, including Tugendheim, we could not stow ourselves so\nthat all could be sheltered from the rain and let the mud cake dry\non our legs and feet. There was a little cabin that Tugendheim took\nfor himself, but Ranjoor Singh remained with us on deck. He stood in\nthe rain by the gangway, looking first at one thing, then at\nanother. I watched him.\n\nPresently he went to the door of the engine-room, opened it, and\nlooked through. I was about to look, too, but he shut it in my face.\n\n\"It is enough that they make steam?\" said he; and I looked up at the\nfunnel and saw steam mingled with the smoke. In a little wheel-house\non the bridge the Turkish captain sat on a shelf, wrapped in his\nshawl, smoking a great pipe, and his mate, who was also a Turk, sat\nbeside him staring at the sky. I asked Ranjoor Singh whether we\nmight expect to have the whole ship to ourselves. Said I, \"It would\nnot be difficult to overpower those two Turks and their small crew\nand make them do our bidding!\" But he answered that a regiment of\nKurds was expected to keep us company at dawn. Then he went up to\nthe bridge to have word with the Turkish captain, and I went to the\nship's side to stare about. Over my shoulder I told the men about\nthe Kurds who were coming, and they were not pleased.\n\nPeering into the dark and wondering that so great a city as Stamboul\nshould show so few lights, I observed the Kurdish sentinels posted\nabout the dock.\n\n\"Those are to prevent us from going ashore until their friends\ncome!\" said I, and they snarled at me like angry wolves.\n\n\"We could easily rush ashore and bayonet every one of them!\" said\nGooja Singh.\n\nBut not a man would have gone ashore again for a commission in the\nGerman army. Gallipoli was written in their hearts. Yet I could\nthink of a hundred thousand chances still that might prevent our\njoining our friends the British in Gallipoli. Nor was I sure in my\nown mind that Ranjoor Singh intended we should try. I was sure only\nof his good faith, and content to wait developments.\n\nThough the lights of the city were few and very far between, so many\nsearch-lights played back and forth above the water that there\nseemed a hundred of them. I judged it impossible for the smallest\nboat to pass unseen and I wondered whether it was difficult or easy\nto shoot with great guns by aid of search-lights, remembering what\nstrange tricks light can play with a gunner's eyes. Mist, too, kept\nrising off the water to add confusion.\n\nWhile I reflected in that manner, thinking that the shadow of every\nwave and the side of every boat might be a submarine, Ranjoor Singh\ncame down from the bridge and stood beside me.\n\n\"I have seen what I have seen!\" said he. \"Listen! Obey! And give me\nno back answers!\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, \"I am thy man!\" But he answered nothing to that.\n\n\"Pick the four most dependable men,\" he said, \"and bid them enter\nthat cabin and gag and bind Tugendheim. Bid them make no noise and\nsee to it that he makes none, but let them do him no injury, for we\nshall need him presently! When that is done, come back to me here!\"\n\nSo I left him at once, he standing as I had done, staring at the\nwater, although I thought perhaps there was more purpose in his gaze\nthan there had been in mine.\n\nI chose four men and led them aside, they greatly wondering.\n\n\"There is work to be done,\" said I, \"that calls for true ones!\"\n\n\"Such men be we!\" said all four together.\n\n\"That is why I picked you from among the rest!\" said I, and they\nwere well pleased at that. Then I gave them their orders.\n\n\"Who bids us do this?\" they demanded.\n\n\"I!\" said I. \"Bind and gag Tugendheim, and we have Ranjoor Singh\ncommitted. He gave the order, and I bid you obey it! How can he be\nfalse to us and true to the Germans, with a gagged German prisoner\non his hands?\"\n\nThey saw the point of that. \"But what if we are discovered too\nsoon?\" said they.\n\n\"What if we are sunk before dawn by a British submarine!\" said I.\n\"We will swim when we find ourselves in water! For the present, bind\nand gag Tugendheim!\"\n\nSo they went and stalked Tugendheim, the German, who had been\ndrinking from a little pocket flask. He was drowsing in a chair in\nthe cabin, with his hands deep down in his overcoat pockets and his\nhelmet over his eyes. Within three minutes I was back at Ranjoor\nSingh's side.\n\n\"The four stand guard over him!\" said I.\n\n\"Very good!\" said he. \"That was well done! Now do a greater thing.\"\n\nMy heart burned, sahib, for I had once dared doubt him, yet all he\nhad to say to me was, \"Well done! Now do a greater thing!\" If he had\ncursed me a little for my earlier unbelief I might have felt less\nashamed!\n\n\"Go to the men,\" said he, \"and bid those who wish the British well\nto put all the money they received this morning into a cloth. Bid\nthose who are no longer true to the British to keep their money.\nWhen the money is all in the cloth, bring it here to me.\"\n\n\"But what if they refuse?\" said I.\n\n\"Do YOU refuse?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay!\" said I. \"Nay, sahib!\"\n\n\"Then why judge them?\" said he. So I went.\n\nCan the sahib imagine it? Two-hundred-and-three-and-thirty men,\nincluding non-commissioned officers, wet and muddy in the dark,\nbeginning to be hungry, all asked at once to hand over all their pay\nif they be true men, but told to keep it if they be traitors!\n\nNo man answered a word, although their eyes burned up the darkness.\nI called for a lantern, and a man brought one from the engine-room\ndoor. By its light I spread out a cloth, and laid all my money on it\non the deck. The sergeant nearest me followed my example. Gooja\nSingh laid down only half his money.\n\n\"Nay!\" said I. \"All or none! This is a test for true men! Half-true\nand false be one and the same to-night!\" So Gooja Singh made a wry\nface and laid down the rest of his money, and the others all\nfollowed him, not at all understanding, as indeed I myself did not\nunderstand, but coming one at a time to me and laying all their\nmoney on the cloth. When the last man had done I tied the four\ncorners of the cloth together (it was all wet with the rain and\nslush on deck, and heavy with the weight of coin) and carried it to\nRanjoor Singh. (I forgot the four who stood guard over Tugendheim;\nthey kept their money.)\n\n\"We are all true men!\" said I, dumping it beside him.\n\n\"Good!\" said he. \"Come!\" And he took the bundle of money and\nascended the bridge ladder, bidding me wait at the foot of it for\nfurther orders. I stood there two hours without another sign of him,\nalthough I heard voices in the wheel-house.\n\nNow the men grew restless. Reflection without action made them begin\nto doubt the wisdom of surrendering all their money at a word. They\nbegan to want to know the why and wherefore of the business, and I\nwas unable to tell them.\n\n\"Wait and see!\" said I, but that only exasperated them, and some\nbegan to raise their voices in anger. So I felt urged to invent a\nreason, hoping to explain it away afterward should I be wrong. But\nas it turned out I guessed at least a little part of Ranjoor Singh's\ngreat plan and so achieved great credit that was useful later,\nalthough at the time I felt myself losing favor with them.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh will bribe the captain of the ship to steam away\nbefore that regiment of Kurds can come on board,\" said I. \"So we\nshall have the ship at our mercy, provided we make no mistakes.\"\n\nThat did not satisfy them, but it gave them something new to think\nabout, and they settled down to wait in silence, as many as could\ncrowding their backs against the deck-house and the rest suffering\nin the rain. I would rather have heard them whispering, because I\njudged the silence to be due to low spirits. I knew of nothing more\nto say to encourage them, and after a time their depression began to\naffect me also. Rather than watch them, I watched the water, and\nmore than once I saw something I did not recognize, that\nnevertheless caused my skin to tingle and my breath to come in\njerks. Sikh eyes are keen.\n\nIt was perhaps two hours before midnight when the long spell of\nfiring along the water-front began and I knew that my eyes and the\ndark had not deceived me. All the search-lights suddenly swept\ntogether to one point and shone on the top-side of a submarine--or\nat least on the water thrown up by its top-side. Only two masts and\na thing like a tower were visible, and the plunging shells threw\nwater over those obscuring them every second. There was a great\nexplosion, whether before or after the beginning of the gun-fire I\ndo not remember, and a ship anchored out on the water no great\ndistance from us heeled over and began to sink. One search-light was\nturned on the sinking ship, so that I could see hundreds of men on\nher running to and fro and jumping; but all the rest of the water\nwas now left in darkness.\n\nThe guards who had been set to prevent our landing all ran to\nanother wharf to watch the gun-fire and the sinking ship, and it was\nat the moment when their backs were turned that two Turkish seamen\ncame down from the bridge and loosed the ropes that held us to the\nshore. Then our ship began to move out slowly into the darkness\nwithout showing lights or sounding whistle. There was still no sign\nof Ranjoor Singh, nor had I time to look for him; I was busy making\nthe men be still, urging, coaxing, cursing--even striking them.\n\n\"Are we off to Gallipoli?\" they asked.\n\n\"We are off to where a true man may remember the salt!\" said I,\nknowing no more than they.\n\nI know of nothing more confusing to a landsman, sahib, than a\ncrowded harbor at night. The many search-lights all quivering and\nshifting in the one direction only made confusion worse and we had\nnot been moving two minutes when I no longer knew north from south\nor east from west. I looked up, to try to judge by the stars. I had\nactually forgotten it was raining. The rain came down in sheets and\noverhead the sky began at little more than arm's length! Judge,\nthen, my excitement.\n\nWe passed very close to several small steamers that may have been\nwar-ships, but I think they were merchant ships converted into\ngunboats to hunt submarines. I think, too, that in the darkness they\nmistook us for another of the same sort, for, although we almost\ncollided with two of them, they neither fired on us nor challenged.\nWe steamed straight past them, beginning to gain speed as the last\none fell away behind.\n\nDoes the sahib remember whether the passage from Stamboul into the\nSea of Marmora runs south or east or west? Neither could I remember,\nalthough at another time I could have drawn a map of it, having\nstudied such things. But memory plays us strange tricks, and\ncavalrymen were never intended to maneuver in a ship! Ranjoor Singh,\nup in the wheel-house, had a map--a good map, that he had stolen\nfrom the German officers--but I did not know that until later. I\nstood with both hands holding the rails of the bridge ladder\nwondering whether gunfire or submarine would sink us and urging the\nmen to keep their heads below the bulwark lest a search-light find\nus and the number of heads cause suspicion.\n\nI have often tried to remember just how many hours we steamed from\nStamboul, yet I have no idea to this day beyond that the voyage was\nended before dawn. It was all unexpected--we were too excited, and\ntoo fearful for our skins to recall the passage of hours. It was\ndarker than I have ever known night to be, and the short waves that\nmade our ship pitch unevenly were growing steeper every minute, when\nRanjoor Singh came at last to the head of the ladder and shouted for\nme. I went to him up the steps, holding to each rail for dear life.\n\n\"Take twenty men,\" he ordered, \"and uncover the forward hatch. Throw\nthe hatch coverings overboard. The hold is full of cartridges. Bring\nup some boxes and break them open. Distribute two hundred rounds to\nevery man, and throw the empty boxes overboard. Then get up twenty\nmore boxes and place them close together, in readiness to take with\nus when we leave the ship. Let me know when that is all done.\"\n\nSo I took twenty men and we obeyed him. Two hundred rounds of\ncartridges a man made a heavy extra load and the troopers grumbled.\n\n\"Can we swim with these?\" they demanded.\n\n\"Who knows until he has tried?\" said I.\n\n\"How far may we have to march with such an extra weight?\" said they.\n\n\"Who knows!\" said I, counting out two hundred more to another man.\n\"But the man,\" I said, \"who lacks one cartridge of the full count\nwhen I come to inspect shall be put to the test whether he can swim\nat all!\"\n\nSome of them had begun to throw half of their two hundred into the\nwater, but after I said that they discontinued, and I noticed that\nthose who had so done came back for more cartridges, pretending that\nmy count had been short. So I served them out more and said nothing.\nThere were hundreds of thousands of rounds in the hold of the ship,\nand I judged we could afford to overlook the waste.\n\nAt last we set the extra twenty boxes in one place together,\nslipping and falling in the process because the deck was wet and the\nship unsteady; and then I went and reported to Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Very good,\" said he. \"Make the men fall in along the deck, and bid\nthem be ready for whatever may befall!\"\n\n\"Are we near land, sahib?\" said I.\n\n\"Very near!\" said he.\n\nI ran to obey him, peering into the blackness to discover land, but\nI could see nothing more than the white tops of waves, and clouds\nthat seemed to meet the sea within a rope's length of us. Once or\ntwice I thought I heard surf, but the noise of the rain and of the\nengines and of the waves pounding against the ship confused my ears,\nso that I could not be certain.\n\nWhen the men were all fallen in I went and leaned over the bulwark\nto try to see better; and as I did that we ran in under a cliff, for\nthe darkness grew suddenly much darker. Then I surely heard surf.\nThen another sound startled me, and a shock nearly threw me off my\nfeet. I faced about, to find twenty or thirty men sprawling their\nlength upon the deck, and when I had urged and helped them up the\nengines had stopped turning, and steam was roaring savagely through\nthe funnel. The motion of the ship was different now; the front part\nseemed almost still, but the behind part rose and fell jerkily.\n\nI busied myself with the men, bullying them into silence, for I\njudged it most important to be able to hear the first order that\nRanjoor Singh might give; but he gave none just yet, although I\nheard a lot of talking on the bridge.\n\n\"Is this Gallipoli?\" the men kept asking me in whispers.\n\n\"If it were,\" said I, \"we should have been blown to little pieces by\nthe guns of both sides before now!\" If I had been offered all the\nworld for a reward I could not have guessed our whereabouts, nor\nwhat we were likely to do next, but I was very sure we had not\nreached Gallipoli.\n\nPresently the Turkish seamen began lowering the boats. There were\nbut four boats, and they made clumsy work of it, but at last all\nfour boats were in the water; and then Ranjoor Singh began at last\nto give his orders, in a voice and with an air that brought\nreassurance. No man could command, as he did who had the least\nlittle doubt in his heart of eventual success. There is even more\nconviction in a true man's voice than in his eye.\n\nHe ordered us overside eight at a time, and me in the first boat\nwith the first eight.\n\n\"Fall them in along the first flat place you find on shore, and wait\nthere for me!\" said he. And I said, \"Ha, sahib!\" wondering as I\nswung myself down a swaying rope whether my feet could ever find the\nboat. But the sailors pulled the rope's lower end, and I found\nmyself in a moment wedged into a space into which not one more man\ncould have been crowded.\n\nThe waves broke over us, and there was a very evil surf, but the\ndistance to the shore was short and the sailors proved skilful. We\nlanded safely on a gravelly beach, not so very much wetter than we\nhad been, except for our legs (for we waded the last few yards), and\nI hunted at once for a piece of level ground. Just thereabouts it\nwas all nearly level, so I fell my eight men in within twenty yards\nof the surf, and waited. I felt tempted to throw out pickets yet\nafraid not to obey implicitly. Ranjoor Singh given no order about\npickets.\n\nI judge it took more than an hour, and it may have been two hours,\nto bring all the men and the twenty boxes of cartridges ashore. At\nlast in three boats came the captain of the ship, and the mate, and\nthe engineer, and nearly all the crew. Then I grew suddenly afraid\nand hot sweat burst out all over me, for by the one lantern that had\nbeen hung from the ship's bridge rail to guide the rowers I could\nsee that the ship was moving! The ship's captain had climbed out of\nthe last boat and was standing close to it. I went up to him and\nseized his shoulder.\n\n\"What dog's work is this?\" said I. \"Speak!\" I said, shaking him,\nalthough he could not talk any tongue that I knew--but I shook him\nnone-the-less until his teeth chattered, and, his arms being wrapped\nin that great shawl of his, there was little he could do to prevent\nme.\n\nAs I live, sahib, on the word of a Sikh I swear that not even in\nthat instant did I doubt Ranjoor Singh. I believed that the Turkish\ncaptain might have stabbed him, or that Tugendheim might have played\nsome trick. But not so the men. They saw the lantern receding and\nreceding, dancing with the motion of the ship, and they believed\nthemselves deserted.\n\n\"Quick! Fire on him!\" shouted some one. \"Let him not escape! Kill\nhim before he is out of range!\"\n\nI never knew which trooper it was who raised that cry, although I\nwent to some trouble to discover afterward. But I heard Gooja Singh\nlaugh like a hyena; and I heard the click of cartridges being thrust\ninto magazines. I was half minded to let them shoot, hoping they\nmight hit Tugendheim. But the Turk freed his arms at last, and began\nstruggling.\n\n\"Look!\" he said to me in English. \"VOILA!\" said he in French.\n\"REGARDEZ! Look--see!\"\n\nI did look, and I saw enough to make me make swift decision. The\nlight was nearer to the water--quite a lot nearer. I flung myself on\nthe nearest trooper, whose rifle was already raised, and taken by\nsurprise he loosed his weapon. With it I beat the next ten men's\nrifles down, and they clattered on the beach. That made the others\npause and look at me.\n\n\"The man who fires the first shot dies!\" said I, striving to make\nthe breath come evenly between my teeth for sake of dignity, yet\nwith none too great success. But in the principal matter I was\nsuccessful, for they left their alignment and clustered round to\nargue with me. At that I refused to have speech with them until they\nshould have fallen in again, as befitted soldiers. Falling in took\ntime, especially as they did it sulkily; and when the noise of\nshifting feet was finished I heard oars thumping in the oar-locks.\n\nA boat grounded amid the surf, and Ranjoor Singh jumped out of it,\nfollowed by Tugendheim and his four guards. The boat's crew leaped\ninto the water and hauled the boat high and dry, and as they did\nthat I saw the ship's lantern disappear altogether.\n\nRanjoor Singh went straight to the Turkish captain. \"Your money,\"\nsaid he, speaking in English slowly--I wonder, sahib, oh, I have\nwondered a thousand times in what medley of tongues strange to all\nof them they had done their bargaining!--\"Your money,\" said he, \"is\nin the boat in which I came. Take it, and take your men, and go!\"\n\nThe captain and his crew said nothing, but got into the boats and\npushed away. One of the boats was overturned in the surf, and there\nthey left it, the sailors scrambling into the other boats. They were\nout of sight and sound in two minutes. Then Ranjoor Singh turned to\nme.\n\n\"Send and gather fire-wood!\" he ordered.\n\n\"Where shall dry wood be in all this rain?\" said I.\n\n\"Search!\" said he.\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, \"a fire would only betray our whereabouts.\"\n\n\"Are you deaf?\" said he.\n\n\"Nay!\" I said.\n\n\"Then obey!\" said he. So I took twenty men, and we went stumbling\nthrough rain and darkness, hunting for what none of us believed was\nanywhere. Yet within fifteen minutes we found a hut whose roof was\nintact, and therefore whose floor and inner parts were dry enough.\nIt was a little hut, of the length of perhaps the height of four\nmen, and the breadth of the height of three--a man and a half high\nfrom floor to roof-beam. It was unoccupied, but there was straw at\none end--dry straw, on which doubtless guards had slept. I left the\nmen standing there and went and told Ranjoor Singh.\n\nI found him talking to the lined up men in no gentle manner. As I\ndrew nearer I heard him say the word \"Wassmuss.\" Then I heard a\ntrooper ask him, \"Where are we?\" And he answered, \"Ye stand on\nAsia!\" That was the first intimation I received that we were in\nAsia, and I felt suddenly lonely, for Asia is wondrously big, sahib.\n\nWhatever Ranjoor Singh had been saying to the men he had them back\nunder his thumb for the time being; for when I told him of my\ndiscovery of the hut he called them to attention, turned them to the\nright, and marched them off as obedient as a machine, Tugendheim\nfollowing like a man in a dream between his four guards and\nstruggling now and then to loose the wet thongs that were beginning\nto cut into his wrists. He had not been trussed over-tenderly, but I\nnoticed that Ranjoor Singh had ordered the gag removed.\n\nThe hut stood alone, clear on all four sides, and after he had\nlooked at it, Ranjoor Singh made the men line up facing the door,\nwith himself and me and Tugendheim between them and the hut.\nPresently he pushed Tugendheim into the hut, and he bade me stand in\nthe door to watch him.\n\n\"Now the man who wishes to ask questions may,\" he said then, and\nthere was a long silence, for I suppose none wished to be accused of\nimpudence and perhaps made an example for the rest. Besides, they\nwere too curious to know what his next intention might be to care to\noffend him. So I, seeing that he wished them to speak, and\nconceiving that to be part of his plan for establishing good\nfeeling, asked the first question--the first that came into my head.\n\n\"What shall we do with this Tugendheim?\" said I.\n\n\"That I will show you presently,\" said he. \"Who else has a question\nto ask?\" And again there was silence, save for the rain and the\ngrinding and pounding on the beach.\n\nThen Gooja Singh made bold, as he usually did when he judged the\nrisk not too great. He was behind the men, which gave him greater\ncourage; and it suited him well to have to raise his voice, because\nthe men might suppose that to be due to insolence, whereas Ranjoor\nSingh must ascribe it to necessity. Well I knew the method of Gooja\nSingh's reasoning, and I knitted my fists in a frenzy of fear lest\nhe say the wrong word and start trouble. Yet I need not have\nworried. I observed that Ranjoor Singh seemed not disturbed at all,\nand he knew Gooja Singh as well as I.\n\n\"It seems for the time being that we have given the slip to both\nTurks and Germans,\" said Gooja Singh; and Ranjoor Singh said, \"Aye!\nFor the time being!\"\n\n\"And we truly stand on Asia?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aye!\" said Ranjoor Singh,\n\n\"Then why did we not put those Turks ashore, and steam away in their\nship toward Gallipoli to join our friends?\" said he.\n\n\"Partly because of submarines,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and partly\nbecause of gun-fire. Partly because of mines floating in the water,\nand partly again from lack of coal. The bunkers were about empty. It\nwas because there was so little coal that the Germans trusted us\nalone on board.\"\n\n\"Yet, why let the Turks have the steamer?\" asked Gooja Singh, bound,\nnow that he was started, to prove himself in the right. \"They will\nfloat about until daylight and then send signals. Then will come\nTurks and Germans!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"No so, for I sank the steamer! I myself\nlet the sea into her hold!\"\n\nGooja Singh was silent for about a minute, and although it was dark\nand I could not see him. I knew exactly the expression of his\nface--wrinkled thus, and with the lower lip thrust out, so!\n\n\"Any more questions?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and by that time Gooja\nSingh had thought again. This time he seemed to think he had an\nunanswerable one, for his voice was full of insolence.\n\n\"Then how comes it,\" said he, \"that you turned those Turks loose in\ntheir small boats when we might have kept them with us for hostages?\nNow they will row to the land and set their masters on our tracks!\nWithin an hour or two we shall all be prisoners again! Tell us why!\"\n\n\"For one thing,\" said Ranjoor Singh, without any resentment in his\nvoice that I could detect (although THAT was no sign!), \"I had to\nmake some sort of bargain with them, and having made it I must keep\nit. The money with which I bribed the captain and his mate would\nhave been of little use to them unless I allowed them life and\nliberty as well.\"\n\n\"But they will give the alarm and cause us to be followed!\" shouted\nGooja Singh, his voice rising louder with each word.\n\n\"Nay, I think not!\" said Ranjoor Singh, as calmly as ever. \"In the\nfirst place, I have a written receipt from captain and mate for our\nmoney, stating the reason for which it was paid; if we were made\nprisoners again, that paper would be found in my possession and it\nmight go ill with those Turks. In the second place, they will wish\nto save their faces. In the third place, they must explain the loss\nof their steamer. So they will say the steamer was sunk by a\nsubmarine, and that they got away in the boats and watched us drown.\nThe crew will bear out what the captain and the mate say, partly\nfrom fear, partly because that is the custom of the country, but\nchiefly because they will receive a small share of the bribe. Let us\nhope they get back safely--for their story will prevent pursuit!\"\n\nFor about two minutes again there was silence, and then Gooja Singh\ncalled out: \"Why did you not make them take us to Gallipoli?\"\n\n\"There was not enough coal!\" said I, but Ranjoor Singh made a\ngesture to me of impatience.\n\n\"The Germans wished us to go to Gallipoli,\" said he, \"and I have\nnoticed that whatever they may desire is expressly intended for\ntheir advantage and not ours. In Gallipoli they would have kept us\nout of range at the rear, and presently they would have caused a\npicture of us to be taken serving among the Turkish army. That they\nwould have published broadcast. After that I have no idea what would\nhave happened to us, except that I am sure we should never have got\nnear enough to the British lines to make good our escape. We must\nfind another way than that!\"\n\n\"We might have made the attempt!\" said Gooja Singh, and a dozen men\nmurmured approval.\n\n\"Simpletons!\" came the answer. \"The Germans laid their plans for the\nfirst for photographs to lend color to lies about the Sikh troops\nfighting for them! Ye would have played into their hands!\"\n\n\"What then?\" said I, after a minute, for at that answer they had all\ngrown dumb.\n\n\"What then?\" said he. \"Why, this: We are in Asia, but still on\nTurkish soil. We need food. We shall need shelter before many hours.\nAnd we need discipline, to aid our will to overcome! Therefore there\nnever was a regiment more fiercely disciplined than this shall be!\nFrom now until we bring up in a British camp--and God knows when or\nwhere that may happen!--the man who as much as thinks of\ndisobedience plays with death! Death--ye be as good as dead men\nnow!\" said he.\n\nHe shook himself. A sense of loneliness had come on me since he told\nus we were in Asia, and I think the men felt as I did. There had\nbeen nothing to eat on the steamer, and there was nothing now.\nHunger and cold and rain were doing their work. But Ranjoor Singh\nstood and shook himself, and moved slowly along the line to look in\neach man's face, and I took new courage from his bearing. If I could\nhave known what he had in store for us, I would have leaped and\nshouted. Yet, no, sahib; that is not true. If he had told me what\nwas coming, I would never have believed. Can the sahib imagine, for\ninstance, what was to happen next?\n\n\"Ye are as good as dead men!\" he said, coming back to the center and\nfacing all the men. \"Consider!\" said he. \"Our ship is sunk and the\nTurks, to save their own skins, will swear they saw us drown. Who,\nthen, will come and hunt for dead men?\"\n\nI could see the eyes of the nearest men opening wider as new\npossibilities began to dawn. As for me--my two hands shook.\n\n\"And we have with us,\" said he, \"a hostage who might prove useful--a\nhostage who might prove amenable to reason. Bring out the prisoner!\"\nsaid he.\n\nSo I bade Tugendheim come forth. He was sitting on the straw where\nthe guards had pushed him, still working sullenly to free his hands.\nHe came and peered through the doorway into darkness, and Ranjoor\nSingh stood aside to let the men see him. They can not have seen\nmuch, for it was now that utter gloom that precedes dawn. Nor can\nTugendheim have seen much.\n\n\"Do you wish to live or die?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and the German\ngaped at him.\n\n\"That is a strange question!\" he said.\n\n\"Is it strange,\" asked Ranjoor Singh, \"that a prisoner should be\nasked for information?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid to die,\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"You mean by rifle-fire?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and Tugendheim\nnodded.\n\n\"But there are other kinds of fire,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tugendheim.\n\n\"Why,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"if we were to fire this hut to warm\nourselves, and you should happen to be inside it--what then?\"\n\n\"If you intend to kill me,\" said Tugendheim, \"why not be merciful\nand shoot me?\" His voice was brave enough, but it seemed to me I\ndetected a strain of terror in it.\n\n\"Few Germans are afraid to be shot to death,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"But what have I done to any of you that you should want to burn me\nalive?\" asked Tugendheim; and that time I was positive his voice was\nforced.\n\n\"Haven't you been told by your officers,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"that\nthe custom of us Sikhs is to burn all our prisoners alive?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tugendheim. \"They told us that. But that was only a tale\nto encourage the first-year men. Having lived in India, I knew\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Did you trouble yourself to tell anybody better?\" asked Ranjoor\nSingh, but Tugendheim did not answer.\n\n\"Then can you give me any reason why you should not be burned alive\nhere, now?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Tugendheim. \"It would be cruel. It would be devil's\nwork!\" He was growing very uneasy, although trying hard not to show\nit.\n\n\"Then give me a name for the tales you have been party to against us\nSikhs!\" said Ranjoor Singh; but once more the German refrained from\nanswering. The men were growing very attentive, breathing all in\nunison and careful to make no sound to disturb the talking. At that\ninstant a great burst of firing broke out over the water, so far\naway that I could only see one or two flashes, and, although that\nwas none too reassuring to us, it seemed to Tugendheim like his\ndeath knell. He set his lips and drew back half a step.\n\n\"Can you wish to live with the shame of all those lies against us on\nyour heart--you, who have lived in India and know so much better?\"\nasked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Of course I wish to live!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"Have you any price to offer for your life?\" asked Ranjoor Singh,\nand stepping back two paces he ordered a havildar with a loud voice\nto take six men and hunt for dry kindling. \"For there is not enough\nhere,\" said he.\n\n\"Price?\" said Tugendheim. \"I have a handful of coins, and my\nuniform, and a sword. You left my baggage on the steamer--\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Your baggage came ashore in one of the\nboats. Where is it? Who has it?\"\n\nA man stepped forward and pointed to it, lying in the shadow of the\nhut with the rain from the roof dripping down on it.\n\n\"Who brought it ashore?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"I,\" said the trooper.\n\n\"Then, for leaving it there in the rain, you shall carry it three\ndays without assistance or relief!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Get back to\nyour place in the ranks!\" And the man got back, saying nothing.\nRanjoor Singh picked up the baggage and tossed it past Tugendheim\ninto the hut.\n\n\"That is all I have!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"If you decide to burn, it shall burn with you,\" said Ranjoor Singh,\n\"and that trooper shall carry a good big stone instead to teach him\nmanners!\"\n\n\"GOTT IN HIMMEL!\" exclaimed Tugendheim, losing his self-control at\nlast. \"Can I offer what I have not got?\"\n\n\"Is there nothing you can do?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"In what way? How?\" asked the German.\n\n\"In the way of making amends to us Sikhs for all those lies you have\nbeen party to,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"If you were willing to offer to\nmake amends, I would listen to you.\"\n\n\"I will do anything in reason,\" said Tugendheim, looking him full in\nthe eye and growing more at ease.\n\n\"I am a reasonable man,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Then, speak!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"it is for you to make proposals,\nand not for me. It is not I who stand waiting to be burned alive!\nLet me make you a suggestion, however. What had we Sikhs to offer\nwhen we were prisoners in Germany?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" said Tugendheim. \"You mean you wish me to join you--to\nbe one of you?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"that if you were to apply to be\nallowed to join this regiment for a while, and to be allowed to\nserve us in a certain manner, we would consider the proposal.\nOtherwise--is my meaning clear?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"Then--?' said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"I apply!\" said Tugendheim; and at that moment the havildar and his\nmen returned with some straw they had found in another tumble-down\nhut. They had it stuffed under their overcoats to keep it dry. \"Too\nlate!\" said Tugendheim with a grimace, but Ranjoor Singh bade them\nthrow the straw inside for all that.\n\n\"In Germany we were required to set our names to paper,\" he said,\nand Tugendheim looked him in the eyes again for a full half minute.\n\"Do you expect better conditions than were offered us?\" asked\nRanjoor Singh.\n\n\"I will sign!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"What will you sign?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Anything in reason,\" answered Tugendheim.\n\n\"Let me tell you what I have here, then,\" said Ranjoor Singh, and he\ngroped in his inner pocket for a paper, that he brought out very\nneatly folded, sheltering it from the rain under his cape. \"This,\"\nsaid he, \"is signed by the Turkish captain and mate of that sunken\nsteamer. It is a receipt for all our money, to be taken and divided\nequally between you--mentioned by name--and them--mentioned also by\nname, on condition that the ship be sunk and we be let go. If you\nwill sign the paper--here--above their signatures--it will entitle\nyou to one-third of all that money. They would neither of them dare\nto refuse to share with you!\"\n\n\"What if I refuse to sign?\" asked Tugendheim, making a great savage\nwrench to free his wrists, but failing.\n\n\"The suggestion is yours,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"You have only your\nown judgment for a guide.\"\n\n\"If I sign it, will you let me go?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"but we will not burn you alive if you\nsign. Here is a fountain-pen. Your hands shall be loosed when you\nare ready.\"\n\nTugendheim nodded, so I went and cut his hands loose; and when I had\nchafed his wrists for a minute or two he was able to write on my\nshoulder, I bending forward and Ranjoor Singh watching like a hawk\nlest he tear the paper. But he made no effort to play tricks.\n\nWhen Ranjoor Singh had folded the paper again he said: \"Those two\nTurks quite understood that you were to be asked to sign as well. In\nfact, if there is any mishap they intend to lay all the blame on\nyou. But it is to their interest as much as yours to keep us from\nbeing captured.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm to help you escape?\" asked Tugendheim.\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Now that you have signed that, I am\nwilling to bargain with you. We intend to find Wassmuss.\"\n\nTugendheim pricked up his ears and began to look almost willing.\n\n\"We have heard of this Wassmuss, and have taken quite a fancy to\nhim. Your friends proposed to send us to the trenches, but we have\nalready had too much of that work and we intend to find Wassmuss and\ntake part with him. Let your business be to obey me implicitly and\nto help us reach Wassmuss, and on the day we reach our goal you\nshall go free with this paper given back to you. Disobey me, and you\nshall sample unheard-of methods of repentance! Do we understand each\nother?\"\n\n\"I understand you!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"I, too, wish to understand,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"It is a bargain,\" said Tugendheim. But I noticed they did not shake\nhands after European fashion, although I think Tugendheim would have\nbeen willing. He was a hearty man in his way, given to bullying, but\nalso to quick forgetfulness; and I will say this much for him, that\nalthough he was ever on the lookout for some way of breaking his\nagreement, he kept it loyally enough while a way was lacking. I have\nmet men I liked less.\n\nIt was growing by that time to be very nearly dawn, and the weather\ndid not improve. The rain came down in squalls and sheets and the\nwind screamed through, it, and we were famished as well as wet to\nthe skin--all, that is to say, except Tugendheim, who had enjoyed\nthe shelter of the hut. The teeth of many of the men were\nchattering. Yet we stood about for an hour more, because it was too\ndark and too dangerous to march over unknown ground. I suspect\nRanjoor Singh did not dare squander what little spirit the men had\nleft; if they had suspected him of losing them in the dark they\nmight have lost heart altogether.\n\nBut at last there grew a little cold color in the sky and the sea\ntook on a shade of gray. Then Ranjoor Singh told off the same four\nmen who had first arrested him to guard our prisoner by day and\nnight, taking turns to pretend to be his servant, with orders to\ngive instant alarm should his movements seem suspicious. After that\nTugendheim was searched, but, nothing of interest being found on\nhim, his money and various little things were given back.\n\n\"Had he no pistol?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"but I took it when we bound and gagged him on the\nsteamer.\" And I drew it out and showed it, feeling proud, never\nhaving had such a weapon--for the law of British India is strict.\n\n\"Why did you not tell me?\" he asked, and I was silent. \"Give it\nhere!\" said he, and I gave it up. He examined it, drew out the\ncartridges, and passed it to Tugendheim, who pocketed it with a\nlaugh. It was three days before he spoke to Tugendheim and caused\nhim to give me the pistol back. I think the men were impressed, and\nI was glad of it, although at the time I felt ashamed.\n\nPresently Ranjoor Singh himself chose an advance guard of twenty men\nand put me in command of it.\n\n\"March eastward,\" he ordered me. \"According to my map, you should\nfind a road within a mile or two running about northeast and\nsouthwest; turn to the left along it. Halt if you see armed men, and\nsend back word. Keep a lookout for food, for the men are starving,\nbut loot nothing without my order! March!\" said he.\n\n\"May I ask a question, sahib,\" said I, still lingering.\n\n\"Ask,\" said he.\n\n\"Would you truly have burned the German alive?\" said I, and he\nlaughed.\n\n\"That would have been a big fire,\" said he. \"Do you think none would\nhave come to investigate?\"\n\n\"That is what I was thinking,\" said I.\n\n\"Do such thoughts burn your brain?\" said he. \"A threat to a bully--to\na fool, folly--to a drunkard, drink--to each, his own! Be going\nnow!\"\n\nSo I saluted him and led away, wondering in my heart, the weather\ngrowing worse, if that were possible, but my spirits rising. I knew\nnow that my back was toward Gallipoli, where the nearest British\nwere, yet my heart felt bold with love for Ranjoor Singh and I did\nnot doubt we would strike a good blow yet for our friends, although\nI had no least idea who Wassmuss was, nor whither we were marching.\nIf I had known--eh, but listen, sahib--this is a tale of tales!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIf a man stole my dinner, I might let him run; but if he stole my\nhorse, he and I and death would play hide-and-seek!--RANJOOR SINGH\n\n\nThat dawn, sahib, instead of lessening, the rainstorm grew into a\ndeluge that saved us from being seen. As I led my twenty men forward\nI looked back a time or two, and once I could dimly see steamers and\nsome smaller boats tossing on the sea. Then the fiercest gust of\nrain of all swept by like a curtain, and it was as if Europe had\nbeen shut off forever--so that I recalled Gooja Singh's saying on\nthe transport in the Red Sea, about a curtain being drawn and our\nnot returning that way. My twenty men marched numbly, some seeming\nhalf-asleep.\n\nBy and by, with heels sucking in the mud, we came to the road of\nwhich Ranjoor Singh had spoken and I turned along it. It had been\nworn into ruts and holes by heavy traffic and now the rain made\nmatters worse, so we made slow progress. But before long I was able\nto make out dimly through the storm what looked like a railway\nstation. There was a line of telegraph poles, and where it crossed\nour road there were buildings enough to have contained two\nregiments. I could see no sign of men, but in that light, with rain\nswirling hither and thither, it was difficult to judge. I halted,\nand sent a man back to warn Ranjoor Singh.\n\nWe blew on our fingers and stamped to keep life in ourselves, until\nat the end of ten minutes he came striding out of the rain like a\nking on his way to be crowned. My twenty were already speechless\nwith unhappiness and hunger, but he had instilled some of his own\nspirit into the rest of the regiment, for they marched with a swing\nin good order. He had Tugendheim close beside him and had inspired\nhim, too. It may be the man was grinning in hope of our capture\nwithin an hour, and in that case he was doomed to disappointment. He\nwas destined also to see the day when he should hope for our escape.\nBut from subsequent acquaintance with him I think he was\nappreciating the risk we ran and Ranjoor Singh's great daring. I say\nthis for Tugendheim, that he knew and respected resolution when he\nsaw it.\n\nWhen I had pointed out what I could see of the lay of the land,\nRanjoor Singh left me in charge and marched away with Tugendheim and\nTugendheim's four guards. I looked about for shelter, but there was\nnone. We stood shivering, the rain making pools at our feet that\nspread and became one. So I made the men mark time and abused them\nroundly for being slack about it, they grumbling greatly because our\nprisoner was marched away to shelter, whereas we must stand without.\nI bullied them as much as I dared, and we stamped the road into a\nveritable quagmire, as builders tread mud for making sun-dried\nbricks, so that when three-quarters of an hour had passed and a man\ncame running back with a message from Ranjoor Singh there was a\nlittle warmth in us. I did not need to use force to get the column\nstarted.\n\n\"Come!\" said the trooper. \"There is food, and shelter, and who knows\nwhat else!\"\n\nSo we went best foot first along the road, feeling less than half as\nhungry and not weak at all, now that we knew food was almost within\nreach. Truly a man's desires are the vainest part of him. Less\nhungry we were at once, less weary, and vastly less afraid; yet, too\nmuch in a hurry to ask questions of the messenger!\n\nRanjoor Singh came out of a building to meet us, holding up his\nhand, so I made the men halt and began to look about. It was\ncertainly a railway station, with a long platform, and part of the\nplatform was covered by a roof. Parallel to that was a great shed\nwith closed sides, and through its half-open door I could smell hay--a\nvery good smell, sahib, warming to the heart. To our right,\nacross what might be called a yard--thus--were many low sheds, and\nin one there were horses feeding; in others I could see Turkish\nsoldiers sprawling on the straw, but they took no notice of us.\nThree of the low sheds were empty, and Ranjoor Singh pointed to\nthem.\n\n\"Let all except twenty men,\" said he, \"go and rest in those sheds.\nIf any one asks questions, say only 'Allah!' So they will think you\nare Muhammadans. If that should not seem sufficient, say 'Wassmuss!'\nBut unless questioned many times, say nothing! As you value your\nlives, say nothing more than those two words to any one at all!\nRather be thought fools than be hanged before breakfast!\"\n\nSo all but twenty of the men went and lay down on straw in the three\nempty sheds, and I took the twenty and followed him into the great\nshed with closed sides. Therein, besides many other things, we\nbeheld great baskets filled with loaves of bread,--not very good\nbread, nor at all fresh, but staff of life itself to hungry men. He\nbade the men count out four loaves for each and every one of us, and\nthen at last, he gave me a little information.\n\n\"The Germans in Stamboul,\" he said, \"talked too loud of this place\nin my hearing.\" I stood gnawing a loaf already, and I urged him to\ntake one, but he would eat nothing until all the men should have\nbeen fed. \"They detrain Dervish troops at this point,\" said he, \"and\nmarch them to the shore to be shipped to Gallipoli, because they\nriot and make trouble if kept in barracks in Skutari or Stamboul.\nThis bread was intended for two train-loads of them.\"\n\n\"Then the Dervishes will riot after all!\" said I, and he laughed--a\nthing he does seldom.\n\n\"The sooner the better!\" said he. \"A riot might cover up our tracks\neven better than this rain.\"\n\n\"Is there no officer in charge here?\" I asked him,\n\n\"Aye, a Turkish officer,\" said he. \"I heard the Germans complain\nabout his inefficiency. A day or two later and we might have found a\nGerman in his place. He mistakes us for friends. What else could we\nbe?\" And he laughed again.\n\n\"But the telegraph wire?\" said I.\n\n\"Is down,\" he said, \"both between here and Skutari, and between here\nand Inismid. God sent this storm to favor us, and we will praise God\nby making use of it.\"\n\n\"Where is Tugendheim?\" said I, but it was some minutes before he\nanswered me, for, since the loaves were counted he went to see them\ndistributed, and I followed him.\n\n\"Tugendheim,\" he said at last, \"has driven the Turkish officer to\nseek refuge in seclusion! I used the word 'Wassmuss,' and that had\neffect; but Tugendheim's insolence was our real passport. Nobody\nhere doubts that we are in full favor at Stamboul. Wassmuss can keep\nfor later on.\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I, seeing he was in good humor now, \"tell me of this\nWassmuss.\"\n\n\"All in good time!\" he answered. And when he has decided it is not\nyet time to answer, it is wisest to be still. After fifteen or\ntwenty minutes with the men, I followed him across the yard and\nentered the station waiting-room--a pretentious place, with fancy\nbronze handles on the doors and windows.\n\nLo, there sat Tugendheim, with his hands deep in his pockets and a\ngreat cigar between his teeth. His four guards stood with bayonets\nfixed, making believe to wait on him, but in truth watching him as\ncaged wolves eye their dinner. Ranjoor Singh was behaving almost\nrespectfully toward him, which filled me with disgust; but presently\nI saw and understood. There was a little window through which to\nsell tickets, and down in one corner of it the frosting had been\nrubbed from off the glass.\n\n\"There is an eye,\" said I in an undertone, \"that I could send a\nbullet through without difficulty!\" But Ranjoor Singh called me a\nperson without judgment and turned his back.\n\n\"When do we start?\" asked Tugendheim.\n\n\"When the men have finished eating,\" he answered, and at that I\nstared again, for I knew the men's mood and did not believe it\npossible to get them away without a long rest, nor even in that case\nwithout argument.\n\n\"What if they refuse?\" said I, and Ranjoor Singh faced about to look\nat me.\n\n\"Do you refuse?\" he asked. \"Go and warn them to finish eating and be\nready to march in twenty minutes!\"\n\nSo I went, and delivered the message, and it was as I had expected,\nonly worse.\n\n\"So those are his words? What are words!\" said they. \"Ask him\nwhither he would lead us!\" shouted Gooja Singh. He had been talking\nin whispers with a dozen men at the rear of the middle hut.\n\n\"If I take him such dogs' answers,\" said I, \"he will dismiss me and\nthere will be no more a go-between.\"\n\n\"Go, take him this message,\" shouted Gooja Singh. \"But for his\nsinking of our ship we should now be among friends in Gallipoli!\nCould we not have seized another ship and plundered coal? Tell him,\ntherefore, if he wishes to lead us he must use good judgment. Are we\nleaves blown hither and thither for his amusement? Nay! We belong to\nthe British Army! Tell him we will march toward Gallipoli or\nnowhither! We will march until opposite Gallipoli, and search for\nsome means of crossing.\"\n\n\"I will take that as Gooja Singh's message, then,\" said I.\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said he. \"That is the regiment's message!\" And the dozen\nmen with whom he had been whispering nodded acquiescence. \"Is Gooja\nSingh the regiment?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"but I am OF the regiment. I am not a man running\nback and forth, false to both sides!\"\n\nI was not taken by surprise. Something of that sort sooner or later\nI knew must come, but I would have preferred another time and place.\n\n\"Be thou go-between then, Gooja Singh!\" said I. \"I accepted only\nunder strong persuasion. Gladly I relinquish! Go thou, and carry thy\nmessage to Ranjoor Singh!\" And I sat down in the entrance of the\nmiddle hut, as if greatly relieved of heavy burdens. \"I have\nfinished!\" I said. \"I am not even havildar! I will request reduction\nto the ranks!\"\n\nFor about a minute I sat while the men stared in astonishment. Then\nthey began to rail at me, but I shook my head. They coaxed me, but I\nrefused. Presently they begged me, but I took no notice.\n\n\"Let Gooja Singh be your messenger!\" said I. And at that they turned\non Gooja Singh, and some of them went and dragged him forward, he\nresisting with arms and feet. They set him down before me.\n\n\"Say the word,\" said they, \"and he shall be beaten!\"\n\nSo I got on my feet again and asked whether they were soldiers or\nmonkey-folk, to fall thus suddenly on one of their number, and he a\nsuperior. I bade them loose Gooja Singh, and I laid my hand on his\nshoulder, helping him to his feet.\n\n\"Are we many men with many troubles, or one regiment?\" said I.\n\nAt that most of them grew ashamed, and those who had assaulted Gooja\nSingh began to make excuses, but he went back to the rear to the men\nwho had whispered with him. They drew away, and he sat in silence\napart, I rejoicing secretly at his discomfiture but fearful\nnevertheless.\n\n\"Now!\" said I. \"Appoint another man to wait on Ranjoor Singh!\"\n\nBut they cried out, \"Nay! We will have none but you. You have done\nwell--we trust you--we are content!\"\n\nI made much play of unwillingness, but allowed them to persuade me\nin the end, yielding a little at a time and gaining from them ever\nnew protestations of their loyalty until at last I let them think\nthey had convinced me.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said they, \"tell Ranjoor Singh he must lead us\ntoward Gallipoli!\" They were firm on that point.\n\nSo I went back to the waiting-room and told Ranjoor Singh all that\nhad happened, omitting nothing, and he stood breaking pieces from a\nloaf of bread, with his fingers, not burying his teeth into the loaf\nas most of us had done. He asked me the names of the men who had so\nspoken and I told him, he repeating them and considering each name\nfor a moment or two.\n\n\"Have they finished eating?\" he asked at last, and I told him they\nhad as good as finished. So he ate his own bread faster.\n\n\"Come,\" he ordered presently, beckoning to Tugendheim and the four\nguards to follow.\n\nIt was raining as hard as ever as we crossed the station yard, and\nthe men had excuse enough for disliking to turn out. Yet they\nscented development, I think, and none refused, although they fell\nin just not sullenly enough to call for reprimand. Ranjoor Singh\ndrew the roll from his inner pocket and they all answered to their\nnames. Then, without referring to the list again, he named those who\nI had told him used high words to me, beginning at Gooja Singh and\nomitting none.\n\n\"Fall out!\" he ordered. And when they had obeyed, \"Fall in again\nover there on the left!\"\n\nThere were three-and-twenty of them, Gooja Singh included, and they\nglared at me. So did others, and I wondered grimly how many enemies\nI had made. But then Ranjoor Singh cleared his throat and we\nrecognized again the old manner that had made a squadron love him to\nthe death at home in India--the manner of a man with good legs under\nhim and no fear in his heart. All but the three-and-twenty forgot\nforthwith my part in the matter.\n\n\"Am I to be herdsman, then?\" said he, pitching his voice against\nwind and rain. \"Are ye men--or animals? Hunted animals would have\nknown enough to eat and hurry on. Hunted animals would be wise\nenough to run in the direction least expected. Hunted animals would\ntake advantage of ill weather to put distance between them and their\nfoe. Some of you, then, must be less than animals! Men I can lead.\nAnimals I can drive. But what shall be done with such less-than-animals\nas can neither be led nor driven?\"\n\nThen he turned about half-left to face the three-and-twenty, and\nstood as it were waiting for their answer, with one hand holding the\nother wrist behind his back. And they stood shifting feet and\nlooking back at him, extremely ill-at-ease.\n\n\"What is the specific charge against us?\" asked Gooja Singh, for the\nmen began to thrust him forward. But Ranjoor Singh let no man draw\nhim from the main point to a lesser one.\n\n\"You have leave,\" said he, \"to take one box of cartridges and go!\nGallipoli lies that way!\" And he pointed through the rain.\n\nThen the two-and-twenty forgot me and began at once abusing Gooja\nSingh, he trying to refute them, and Ranjoor Singh watching them all\nwith a feeling, I thought, of pity. Tugendheim, trying to make the\nends of his mustaches stand upright in the rain, laughed as if he\nthought it a very great joke; but the rest of the men looked\ndoubtful. I knew they were unwilling to turn their backs on any of\nour number, yet afraid to force an issue, for Ranjoor Singh had them\nin a quandary. I thought perhaps I might mediate.\n\n\"Sahib,\" said I.\n\n\"Silence!\" he ordered. So I stepped back to my place, and a dozen\nmen laughed at me, for which I vowed vengeance. Later when my wrath\nhad cooled I knew the reprimand and laughter wiped out suspicion of\nme, and when my chance came to take vengeance on them I refrained,\nalthough careful to reassert my dignity.\n\nAfter much argument, Gooja Singh turned his back at last on the\ntwo-and-twenty and saluted Ranjoor Singh with great abasement.\n\n\"Sahib,\" said he, \"we have no wish to go one way and you another. We\nbe of the regiment.\"\n\n\"Ye have set yourselves up to be dictators. Ye have used wild words.\nYe have tried to seduce the rest. Ye have my leave to go!\" said\nRanjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay!\" said Gooja Singh. \"We will not go! We follow the regiment!\"\n\n\"Will ye follow like dogs that pick up offal, then?\" he asked, and\nGooja Singh said, \"Nay! We be no dogs, but true men! We be faithful\nto the salt, sahib,\" said he. \"We be sorry we offended. We be true\nmen--true to the salt.\"\n\nNow, that was the truth. Their fault had lain in not believing their\nofficer at least as faithful as they and ten times wiser. Every man\nin the regiment knew it was truth, and for all that the rain poured\ndown in torrents, obscuring vision, I could see that the general\nfeeling was swinging all one way. If I had dared, I would have\ntouched Ranjoor Singh's elbow, and have whispered to him. But I did\nnot dare. Nor was there need. The instant he spoke again I knew he\nsaw clearer than I.\n\n\"Ye speak of the salt,\" said he.\n\n\"Aye!\" said Gooja Singh. \"Aye, sahib! In the name of God be good to\nus! Whom else shall we follow?\"\n\n\"Aye, sahib!\" said the others. \"Put us to the test!\"\n\nThe lined-up regiment, that had been standing rigid, not at\nattention, but with muscles tense, now stood easier, and it might\nhave been a sigh that passed among them.\n\n\"Then, until I release you for good behavior, you three-and-twenty\nshall be ammunition bearers,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Give over your\nrifles for other men to carry. Each two men take a box of\ncartridges. Swiftly now!\" said he.\n\nSo they gave up their rifles, which in itself was proof enough that\nthey never intended harm, but were only misled by Gooja Singh and\nthe foolishness of their own words. And they picked up the cartridge\nboxes, leaving Gooja Singh standing alone by the last one. He made a\nwry face. \"Who shall carry this?\" said he, and Ranjoor Singh\nlaughed.\n\n\"My rank is havildar!\" said Gooja Singh.\n\nRanjoor Singh laughed again. \"I will hold court-martial and reduce\nyou to the ranks whenever I see the need!\" said he. \"For the\npresent, you shall teach a new kind of lesson to the men you have\nmisled. They toil with ammunition boxes. You shall stride free!\"\n\nGooja Singh had handed his rifle to me, and I passed it to a\ntrooper. He stepped forward now to regain it with something of a\nsmirk on his fat lips.\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh, with another laugh. \"No rifle, Gooja\nSingh! Be herdsman without honor! If one man is lost on the road you\nshall be sent back alone to look for him! Herd them, then; drive\nthem, as you value peace!\"\n\nThere being then one box to be provided for, he chose eight strong\nmen to take turns with it, each two to carry for half an hour; and\nthat these might know there was no disgrace attached to their task,\nthey were placed in front, to march as if they were the band. Nor\nwas Gooja Singh allowed to march last, as I expect he had hoped; he\nand his twenty-two were set in the midst, where they could eat\nshame, always under the eyes of half of us. Then Ranjoor Singh\nraised his voice again.\n\n\"To try to reach Gallipoli,\" he said, \"would be as wise as to try to\nreach Berlin! Both shores are held by Turkish troops under German\nofficers. We found the one spot where it was possible to slip\nthrough undetected. We must make the most of that. Moreover, if they\nrefuse to believe we were drownd last night, they will look for us\nin the direction of Gallipoli, for all the German officers in\nStamboul knew how your hearts burned to go thither. It was a joke\namong them! Let it be our business to turn the joke on them! There\nwill be forced marches now--long hungry ones--Form fours!\" he\nordered. \"By the right--Quick march!\" And we wheeled away into the\nrain, he marching on the flank. I ran and overtook him.\n\n\"Take a horse, sahib!\" I urged. \"See them in that shed! Take one and\nride, for it is more fitting!\"\n\n\"Better plunder and burn!\" said he. \"If a man stole my dinner I\nmight let him run; but if he stole my horse, he and I and death\nwould play hide-and-seek! We need forgetfulness, not angry memories,\nbehind us! Keep thou a good eye on Tugendheim!\"\n\nSo I fell to the rear, where I could see all the men, Tugendheim\nincluded! In a very few minutes we had lost the station buildings in\nthe rain behind us and then Ranjoor Singh began to lead in a wide\nsemicircle, so that before long I judged we were marching about\nsoutheastward. At the end of an hour or so he changed direction to\ndue east, and presently we saw another telegraph line. I overtook\nhim again and suggested that we cut it.\n\n\"Nay!\" said he. \"If that line works and we are not believed drowned,\ntoo many telegrams will have been sent already! To cut it would give\nthem our exact position! Otherwise--why make trouble and perhaps\ncause pursuit?\"\n\nSo we marched under the telegraph wire and took a course about\nparallel to it. At noon it ceased raining and we rested, eating the\nbread, of which every man had brought away three loaves. After that,\nwhat with marching and the wind and sun our clothes began to dry and\nwe became more cheerful--all, that is to say, except the ammunition\nbearers, who abused Gooja Singh with growing fervency. Yet he was\ncompelled to drive them lest he himself be court martialed and\nreduced to the ranks.\n\nCheerfulness and selfishness are often one, sahib, for it was not\nwhat we could see that raised our spirits. We marched by village\nafter village that had been combed by the foragers for Turkish\narmies,--and saw only destitution to right and left, behind and\nbefore. The only animals we saw were dead ones except the dogs\nhunting for bones that might have marrow in them still.\n\nWe saw no men of military age. Only very old men were left, and but\nfew of those; they and the women and children ran away at sight of\nus, except a very few who seemed careless from too much misery. One\nsuch man had a horse, covered from head to foot with sores, that he\noffered to sell to Ranjoor Singh. I did not overhear what price he\nasked, but I heard the men scoffing at such avarice as would rob the\nvultures. He went away saying nothing, like a man in stupor, leaving\nthe horse to die. Nay, sahib, he had not understood the words.\n\nWe slept that first night in a village whose one street was a\nquagmire and a cesspool. There was no difficulty in finding shelter\nbecause so many of the houses were deserted; but the few inhabitants\nof the other houses could not be persuaded to produce food. Ranjoor\nSingh took their money away from, the four men whom I had overlooked\nwhen we all gave up our money on the steamer, and with that, and\nTugendheim for extra argument, he went from house to house.\nTugendheim used no tenderness, such being not his manner of\napproach, but nothing came of it. They may have had food hidden, but\nwe ate stale bread and gave them some of it, although Ranjoor Singh\nforbade us when he saw what we were doing. He thought I had not been\nlooking when he gave some of his own to a little one.\n\nWe were up and away at dawn, with all the dogs in Asia at our heels.\nThey smelled our stale bread and yearned for it. It was more than an\nhour before the last one gave up hope and fell behind. They are hard\ntimes, sahib, when the street dogs are as hungry as those were.\n\nHunger! We met hunger day after day for eight days--hunger and\nnothing else, although it was good enough land--better than any I\nhave seen in the Punjab. There was water everywhere. The air, too,\nwas good to breathe, tempting us to fill our lungs and march like\nnew men, yet causing appetite we could not assuage. We avoided\ntowns, and all large villages, Ranjoor Singh consulting his map\nwhenever we halted and marching by the little compass the Germans\nhad given him. We should have seen sheep or goats or cattle had\nthere been any; but there was none. Utterly not one! And we Sikhs\nare farmers, not easily deceived on such matters; we knew that to be\ngrazing land we crossed. It was a land of fruit, too, in the proper\nseason. There had been cattle by the thousand, but they were all\ngone--plundered by the Turks to feed their armies.\n\nRanjoor Singh did his best to make us husband our stale loaves, but\nwe ate the last of them and became like famished wolves. Some of us\ngrew footsore, for we had German boots, to which our feet were not\nyet thoroughly accustomed, but he gave us no more rest than he\nneeded for his own refreshment--and that was wonderfully little. We\nhad to nurse and bandage our feet as best we could, and\nmarch--march--march! He had a definite plan, for he led unhesitatingly, but\nhe would not tell us the plan. He was stern when we begged for\nlonger rests, merciless toward the ammunition bearers, silent at all\ntimes unless compelled to give orders or correct us. Most of the\ntime he kept Tugendheim marching beside him, and Tugendheim, I\nthink, began to regard him with quite peculiar respect; for he\nadmired resolution.\n\nMost of us felt that our last day of marching was upon us, for we\nwere ready to drop when we skirted a village at about noon on the\neighth day and saw in the distance a citadel perched on a rocky hill\nabove the sky-line. We were on flat land, but there was a knoll\nnear, and to that Ranjoor Singh led us, and there he let us lie. He,\nweary as we but better able to overcome, drew out his map and spread\nit, weighting the four corners with stones; and he studied it chin\non hand for about five minutes, we watching him in silence.\n\n\"That,\" said he, standing at last and pointing toward the distant\ncitadel, \"is Angora. Yonder\" (he made a sweeping motion) \"runs the\nrailway whose terminus is at Angora. There are many long roads\nhereabouts, so that the place has become a depot for food and stores\nthat the Turks plunder and the Germans despatch over the railway to\nthe coast. The railway has been taken over by the Germans.\"\n\n\"Are we to storm the town?\" asked a trooper, and fifty men mocked\nhim. But Ranjoor Singh looked down kindly at him and gave him a word\nof praise.\n\n\"No, my son,\" he said. \"Yet if all had been stout enough to ask\nthat, I would have dared attempt it. No, we are perhaps a little\ndesperate, but not yet so desperate as that.\"\n\nHe began sweeping the horizon with his eyes, quartering the\ncountryside mile by mile, overlooking nothing. I saw him watch the\nwheeling kites and look below them, and twice I saw him fix his gaze\nfor minutes at a time on one place.\n\n\"We will eat to-night!\" he said at last. \"Sleep,\" he ordered. \"Lie\ndown and sleep until I summon you!\" But he called me to his side and\nkept me wakeful for a while yet.\n\n\"Look yonder,\" said he, and when I had gazed for about two minutes I\nwas aware of a column of men and animals moving toward the city. A\nlittle enough column.\n\n\"How fast are they moving?\" he asked me, and I gazed for several\nminutes, reaching no decision. I said they were too far away, and\ncoming too much toward us for their speed to be accurately judged.\nYet I thought they moved slowly.\n\nSaid he, \"Do you see that hollow--one, two, three miles this side of\nthem?\" And I answered yes. \"That is a bend of the river that flows\nby the city,\" said he. \"There is water there, and fire-wood. They\nhave come far and are heading toward it. They are too far spent to\nreach Angora before night. They will not try. That is where they\nwill camp.\"\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said, considering his words as a cook tastes curry, \"our\nmen be overweary to have fight in them.\"\n\n\"Who spoke of fighting?\" said he. So I went and lay down, and fell\nasleep wondering. When he came and roused me it was already growing\nlate. By the time I had roused the men and they were all lined up we\ncould no longer see Angora for the darkness; which worked both\nways--those in Angora could not see us.\n\n\"If any catch sight of us,\" said Ranjoor Singh, speaking in a loud\nvoice to us all, \"let us hope they mistake us for friends. What Turk\nor German looks for an enemy hereabouts? The chances are all ours,\nbut beware! Be silent as ye know how! Forward!\"\n\nIt was a pitiable effort, for our bellies yearned and our feet were\nsore and stiff. We stumbled from weariness, and men fell and were\nhelped up again. Gooja Singh and his ammunition bearers made more\nnoise than a squadron of mounted cavalry, and the way proved twice\nas long as the most hopeless had expected. Yet we made the circuit\nunseen and, as far as we knew, unheard--certainly unchallenged.\nDoubtless, as Ranjoor Singh said afterward, the Turks were too\noverriden by Germans and the Germans too overconfident to suspect\nthe presence of an enemy.\n\nAt any rate, although we made more noise than was expedient, we\nhalted at last among low bushes and beheld nine or ten Turkish\nsentries posted along the rim of a rise, all unaware of us. Two were\nfast asleep. Some sat. The others drowsed, leaning on their rifles.\nRanjoor Singh gave us whispered orders and we rushed them, only one\ncatching sight of us in time to raise an alarm. He fired his rifle,\nbut hit nobody, and in another second they were all surrounded and\ndisarmed.\n\nThen, down in the hollow we saw many little campfires, each one\nreflected in the water. Some Turks and about fifty men of another\nnation sat up and rubbed their eyes, and a Turkish captain--an\nupstanding flabby man, came out from the only tent to learn what the\ntrouble might be. Ranjoor Singh strode down into the hollow and\nenlightened him, we standing around the rim of the rise with our\nbayonets fixed and rifles at the \"ready.\" I did not hear what\nRanjoor Singh said to the Turkish captain because he left me to\nprevent the men from stampeding toward the smell of food--no easy\ntask.\n\nAfter five minutes he shouted for Tugendheim, and the German went\ndown the slope visibly annoyed by the four guards who kept their\nbayonets within a yard of his back. It was a fortunate circumstance\nfor us, not only then but very many times, that Tugendheim would\nhave thought himself disgraced by appealing to a Turk. Seeing there\nwas no German officer in the hollow, he adopted his arrogant manner,\nand the Turkish officer drew back from him like a man stung. After\nthat the Turkish captain appeared to resign himself to impotence,\nfor he ordered his men to pile arms and retired into his tent.\n\nThen Ranjoor Singh came up the slope and picked the twenty men who\nseemed least ready to drop with weariness, of whom I regretted to be\none. He set us on guard where the Turkish sentries had been, and the\nTurks were sent below, where presently they fell asleep among their\nbrethren, as weary, no doubt, from plundering as we were from\nmarching on empty bellies. None of them seemed annoyed to be\ndisarmed. Strange people! Fierce, yet strangely tolerant!\n\nThen all the rest of the men, havildars no whit behind the rest,\nswooped down on the camp-fires, and presently the smell of toasting\ncorn began to rise, until my mouth watered and my belly yearned.\nFifteen or twenty minutes later (it seemed like twenty hours,\nsahib!) hot corn was brought to us and we on guard began to be new\nmen. Nevertheless, food made the guard more sleepy, and I was hard\nput to it walking from one to another keeping them awake.\n\nAll that night I knew nothing of what passed in the camp below, but\nI learned later on that Ranjoor Singh found among the Syrians whose\nbusiness was to load and drive carts a man named Abraham. All in the\ncamp who were not Turks were Syrians, and these Syrians had been\ndragged away from their homes scores of leagues away and made to\nlabor without remuneration. This Abraham was a gifted man, who had\nbeen in America, and knew English, as well as several dialects of\nKurdish, and Turkish and Arabic and German. He knew better German\nthan English, and had frequently been made to act interpreter.\nLater, when we marched together, he and I became good friends, and\nhe told me many things.\n\nWell, sahib, after he had eaten a little corn, Ranjoor Singh\nquestioned this man Abraham, and then went with him through the\ncamp, examining the plunder the Turks had seen fit to requisition.\nIt was plain that this particular Turkish officer was no paragon of\nall the virtues, and Ranjoor Singh finally entered his tent\nunannounced, taking Abraham with him. So it was that I learned the\ndetails later, for Abraham told me all I asked.\n\nOn a box beside the bed Ranjoor Singh found writing-paper,\nenvelopes, and requisition forms not yet filled out, but already\nsigned with a seal and a Turkish signature. There was a map, and a\nlist of routes and villages. But best of all was a letter of\ninstructions signed by a German officer. There were also other\npriceless things, of some of which I may chance to speak later.\n\nI was told by Abraham that during the conversation following Ranjoor\nSingh's seizure of the papers the word Wassmuss was bandied back and\nforth a thousand times, the Turk growing rather more amenable each\ntime the word was used. Finally the Turk resigned himself with a\nshrug of the shoulders, and was left in his tent with a guard of our\nmen at each corner.\n\nThen, for all that the night was black dark and there were very few\nlanterns, the camp began to be turned upside down, Ranjoor Singh\nordering everything thrown aside that could not be immediately\nuseful to us. There were forty carts, burdened to the breaking\npoint, and twenty of them Ranjoor Singh abandoned as too heavy for\nour purpose. Most of the carts had been drawn by teams of six mules\neach, but ten of them had been drawn by horses, and besides the\nTurkish captain's horse there were four other spare ones. There were\nalso about a hundred sheep and some goats.\n\nRanjoor Singh ordered all the corn repacked into fourteen of the\ncarts, sheep and goats into four carts, and ammunition into the\nremaining two, leaving room in each cart for two men so that the\nguard who had stood awake all night might ride and sleep. That left\nhim with sixty-four spare horses. Leaving the Turkish officer his\nown horse, but taking the saddle for himself, he gave Tugendheim\none, me another, the third to Gooja Singh--he being next\nnon-commissioned officer to me in order of seniority, and having had\npunishment enough--and the fourth horse, that was much the best one,\nhe himself took. Then he chose sixty men to cease from being\ninfantry and become a sort of cavalry again--cavalry without saddles\nas yet, or stirrups--cavalry with rifles--cavalry with aching\nfeet--but cavalry none the less. He picked the sixty with great wisdom,\nchoosing for the most part men who had given no trouble, but he\nincluded ten or twelve grumblers, although for a day or two I did\nnot understand why. There was forethought in everything he did.\n\nThe sheep that could not be crowded into the carts he ordered\nbutchered there and then, and the meat distributed among the men;\nand all the plunder that he decided not to take he ordered heaped in\none place where it would not be visible unless deliberately looked\nfor. The plundered money that he found in the Turk's tent he hid\nunder the corn in the foremost cart, and we found it very useful\nlater on. The few of our men who had not fallen asleep were for\nburning the piled-up plunder, but he threatened to shoot whoever\ndared set match to it.\n\n\"Shall we light a beacon to warn the countryside?\" said he.\n\nA little after midnight there began to be attempts by Turkish\nsoldiers to break through and run for Angora. But I had kept my\ntwenty guards awake with threats of being made to carry\nammunition--even letting the butt of my rifle do work not set down in the\nregulations. So it came about that we captured every single\nfugitive. They were five all told, and I sent them, tied together,\ndown to Ranjoor Singh. Thereupon he went to the Turk, and promised\nhim personal violence if another of his men should attempt to break\naway. So the Turk gave orders that were obeyed.\n\nThen, when all the plunder in the camp had been rearranged, and the\nmules and horses reapportioned, four hours yet before dawn, Ranjoor\nSingh took out his fountain-pen and executed the stroke of genius\nthat made what followed possible. Without Abraham I do not know what\nhe would have done. I can not imagine. Yet I feel sure he would have\ncontrived something. He made use of Abraham as the best tool\navailable, and that is no proof he could not have done as well by\nother means. I have learned this: that Ranjoor Singh, with that\nfaith of his in God, can do anything. Anything. He is a true man,\nand God puts thoughts into his heart.\n\nAmong the Turk's documents were big sheets of paper for official\ncorrespondence, similar to that on which his orders were written.\nRanjoor Singh ascertained from Abraham that he who had signed those\norders was the German officer highest in command in all that region,\nwho had left Angora a month previously to superintend the\nrequisitioning.\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh sent for Tugendheim, whose writing would have the\nproper clerical appearance, and by a lantern in the tent dictated to\nhim a letter in German to the effect that this Turkish officer, by\nname Nazim, with all his men and carts and animals, had been\ndiverted to the aid of Wassmuss. The letter went on to say that on\nhis way back to Angora this same high German officer would himself\ncover the territory thus left uncared for, so that nothing need be\ndone about it in the meanwhile. (He wrote that to prevent\ninvestigation and perhaps pursuit by the men in Angora who waited\nNazim and his plunder.)\n\nAt the foot of the letter Abraham cleverly copied the signature of\nthe very high German officer, after making many experiments first on\nanother sheet of paper.\n\nTugendheim of course protested vehemently that he would do no such\nthing, when ordered to write. But Ranjoor Singh ordered the barrel\nof a Turkish soldier's rifle thrust in the fire, and the German did\nnot protest to the point of permitting his feet to be singed. He\nwrote a very careful letter, even suggesting better phraseology--his\nreason for that being that, since he was thus far committed, our\ntotal escape would be the best thing possible for him. The Germans,\nwho are so fond of terrifying others, are merciless to their own who\nhappen to be guilty of weak conduct, and to have said he was\ncompelled to write that letter would have been no excuse if we were\ncaught. Henceforward it was strictly to his interest to help us.\n\nFinally, when the letter had been sealed in its envelope, there came\nthe problem of addressing it, and the Turk seemed ignorant on that\npoint, or else stupid. Perhaps he was wilfully ignorant, hoping that\nthe peculiar form of the address might cause suspicion and\ninvestigation. But what with Tugendheim's familiarity with German\nmilitary custom, and Ranjoor Singh's swift thought, an address was\ndevised that served the purpose, judging by results.\n\nThen came the problem of delivering the letter. To have sent one of\nthe Turkish soldiers with it would have been the same thing as\nmarching to Angora and surrendering; for of course the Turk would\nhave told of what happened in the night, and where it happened, and\nall about it. To have sent one of the half-starved Syrians would\nprobably have amounted to the same thing; for the sake of a\nbellyful, or from fear of ill-treatment the wretched man would very\nlikely tell too much. But Abraham was different. Abraham was an\neducated man, who well understood the value to us of silence, and\nwho seemed to hate both Turks and Germans equally.\n\nSo Ranjoor Singh took Abraham aside and talked with him five\nminutes. And the end of that was that a Turkish soldier was\ncompelled to strip himself and change clothes with Abraham, the Turk\ntaking no pleasure at all in the exchange. Then Abraham was given a\nhorse, and on the outside of the envelope in one corner was written\nin German, \"Bearer should be supplied with saddle for his horse and\nsent back at once with acknowledgment of receipt of this.\"\n\nThere and then Ranjoor Singh gave Abraham the letter, shook hands\nwith him, helped him on the horse, and sent him on his way--three\nhours before dawn. Then promptly he gave orders to all the other\nSyrians to strike camp and resume their regular occupation of\ndriving mules.\n\nThe Turkish officer, although not deprived of his horse, was not\npermitted to ride until after daybreak, because of the difficulty\notherwise of guarding him in the dark. The same with Tugendheim;\nalthough there was little reason for suspecting him of wanting to\nescape, with that letter fresh in his memory, he was nevertheless\ncompelled to walk until daylight should make escape impossible.\n\nThe Turkish officer was made to march in front with his four-and-forty\nsoldiers, who were given back their rifles but no bayonets or\nammunition. Gooja Singh, whose two-and-twenty were ready by that\ntime to pull his beard out hair by hair, was given fifty men who\nhated him less fiercely and set to march next behind the Turks. Then\ncame the carts in single column, and after them Tugendheim and the\nremainder of our infantry. Behind the infantry rode the cavalry, and\nvery last of all rode Ranjoor Singh, since that was for the present\nthe post of chiefest danger.\n\nAs for me, I tumbled into a cart and fell asleep at once, scarcely\nhearing the order shouted to the Turk to go forward. The men who had\nbeen on guard with me all did the same, falling asleep like I almost\nbefore their bodies touched the corn.\n\nWhen I awoke it was already midday. We had halted near some trees\nand food was being served out. I got under the cart to keep the sun\noff me, and lay there musing until a trooper had brought my meal.\nThe meal was good, and my thoughts were good--excellent! For had we\nnot been a little troop of lean ghosts, looking for graves to lie\nin? The talk along the way had been of who should bury us, or who\nshould bury the last man, supposing we all died one by one! Had we\nnot been famished until the very wind was a wall too heavy to\nprevail against? And were we not now what the drill-book calls a\ncomposite force, with full bellies, carts, horses and equipment? Who\nthought about graves any longer? I lay and laughed, sahib, until a\ntrooper brought me dinner--laughed for contempt of the Germans we\nhad left behind, and for the Turks whose plunder we had stolen,--laughed\nlike a fool, like a man without brain or experience or judgment.\n\nNot until I had eaten my fill did I bethink me of Ranjoor Singh.\nThen I rose lazily, and was astonished at the stiffness in my\nankles. Nevertheless I contrived to stride with military manner, in\norder that any Turk or Syrian beholding me might know me for a man\nto be reckoned with, the added pain and effort being well worth\nwhile.\n\nNor did I have far to look for Ranjoor Singh. The instant I raised\nmy eyes I saw him sitting on a great rock beneath the shadow of a\ntree, with his horse tied below him eating corn from a cloth spread\non the ground. In order to reach him with least inconvenience, I\nmade a circuit and approached from the rear, because in that\ndirection the rock sloped away gradually and I was in no mood to\nclimb, nor in condition to climb with dignity.\n\nSo it happened that I came on him unaware. Nevertheless, I was\nsurprised that his ears should not detect my footfall. The horse,\nsix feet below us, was aware of me first and snorted, yet Ranjoor\nSingh did not turn his head.\n\n\"Sahib!\" said I; but he did not move.\n\n\"Sahib!\" I said, going a step nearer and speaking louder. But he\nneither moved nor answered. Now I knew there was no laughing matter,\nand my hand trembled as I held it out to touch his shoulder. His\narms were folded above his knees and his chin rested on them. I\nshook him slightly, and his chin fell down between his knees; but he\ndid not answer. Now I knew beyond doubt he was not asleep, for\nhowever weary he would ever awake at a touch or the lightest\nwhisper. I began to fear he was dead, and a feeling of sickness\nswept over me as that grim fear took hold.\n\n\"Sahib!\" I said again, taking his shoulders with both hands. And he\ntoppled over toward me, thus, like a dead man. Yet he breathed. I\nmade certain he was breathing.\n\nI shook him twice or thrice, with no result. Then I took him in my\narms, thus, one arm under the knees and one under his armpits, and\nlifted him. He is a heavy man, all bone and sinew, and my stiff\nankles caused me agony; but I contrived to lay him gently full\nlength in the shadow of the tree-trunk, and then I covered him with\nhis overcoat, to keep away flies. I had scarcely finished that when\nGooja Singh came, and I cursed under my breath; but openly I\nappeared pleased to see him.\n\n\"It is well you came!\" said I. \"Thus I am saved the necessity of\nsending one to bring you. Our sahib is asleep,\" I said, \"and has\nmade over the command to me until he shall awake again.\"\n\n\"He sleeps very suddenly!\" said Gooja Singh, and he stood eying me\nwith suspicion.\n\n\"Well he may!\" said I, thinking furiously--as a man in a burning\nhouse--yet outwardly all calm. \"He has done all our thinking for us\nall these days; he has borne alone the burden of responsibility. He\nhas enforced the discipline,\" said I with a deliberate stare that\nmade Gooja Singh look sullen, \"and God knows how necessary that has\nbeen! He has let no littlest detail of the march escape him. He has\neaten no more than we; he has marched as far and as fast as we; he\nhas slept less than any of us. And now,\" said I, \"he is weary. He\nkept awake until I came, and fell asleep in my arms when he had\ngiven me his orders.\"\n\nGooja Singh looked as if he did not believe me. But my words had\nbeen but a mask behind which I was thinking. As I spoke I stepped\nsidewise, as if to prevent our voices from disturbing the sleeper,\nfor it seemed wise to draw Gooja Singh to safer distance. Now I sat\ndown at last on the summit of the rock exactly where Ranjoor Singh\nwas sitting when I spied him first, hoping that perhaps in his place\nhis thoughts would come to me. And whether the place had anything to\ndo with it or not I do not know, but certainly wise thoughts did\ncome. I reached a decision in that instant that was the saving of\nus, and for which Ranjoor Singh greatly commended me later on.\nBecause of it, in the days to come, he placed greater confidence in\nmy ability and faithfulness and judgment.\n\n\"What were his orders?\" asked Gooja Singh. \"Or were they secret\norders known only to him and thee?\"\n\n\"If you had not come,\" said I, \"I would have sent for you to hear\nthe orders. When he wakes,\" I added, \"I shall tell him who obeyed\nthe swiftest.\"\n\nI was thinking still. Thinking furiously. I knew nothing at all yet\nabout Abraham, and that was good, for otherwise I might have decided\nto wait there for him to overtake us.\n\n\"Have the men finished eating?\" I asked, and he answered he was come\nbecause they had finished eating.\n\n\"Then the order is to proceed at once!\" said I. \"Send a cart here\nunder the rock and eight good men, that we may lower our sahib into\nit. With the exception of that one cart let the column proceed in\nthe same order as before, the Turk and his men leading.\"\n\n\"Leading whither?\" asked Gooja Singh.\n\n\"Let us hope,\" said I, \"to a place where orders are obeyed in\nmilitary manner without question! Have you heard the order?\" I\nasked, and I made as if to go and wake our officer.\n\nWithout another word Gooja Singh climbed down from the rock and went\nabout shouting his commands as if he himself were their originator.\nMeanwhile I thought busily, with an eye for the wide horizon,\nwondering whether we were being pursued, or whether telegrams had\nnot perhaps been sent to places far ahead, ordering Turkish\nregiments to form a cordon and cut us off. I wondered more than ever\nwho Wassmuss might be, and whether Ranjoor Singh had had at any time\nthe least idea of our eventual destination. I had no idea which\ndirection to take. There was no track I could see, except that made\nby our own cart-wheels. On what did I base my decision, then? I will\ntell you, sahib.\n\nI saw that not only Ranjoor Singh's horse, but all the cattle had\nbeen given liberal amounts of corn. It seemed to me that unless he\nintended to continue by forced marches Ranjoor Singh would have\nbegun by economizing food. Moreover, I judged that if he had\nintended resting many hours in that spot he would have had me\nsummoned and have gone to sleep himself. The very fact that he had\nlet me sleep on seemed to me proof that he intended going forward.\nDoubtless, he would depend on me to stand guard during the night. So\nI reasoned it. And I also thought it probable he had told the Turk\nin which direction to lead, seeing that the Turk doubtless knew more\nof that countryside than any. Ahead of us was all Asia and behind us\nwas the sea. Who was I that I should know the way? But by telling\nthe Turk to lead on, I could impose on him responsibility for\npossible error, and myself gain more time to think. And for that\ndecision, too, Ranjoor Singh saw fit to praise me later.\n\nThey brought the cart, and with the help of eight men, I laid\nRanjoor Singh very comfortably on the corn, and covered him. Then I\nbade those eight be bodyguard, letting none approach too close on\npain of violence, saying that Ranjoor Singh needed a long deep sleep\nto restore his energy. Also, I bade them keep that cart at the rear\nof the column, and I myself chose the rear place of all so as to\nkeep control, prevent straggling, and watch against pursuit.\n\nPursued? Nay, sahib. Not at that time. Nevertheless, that thought of\nmine, to choose the last place, was the very gift of God. We had\nbeen traveling about three parts of an hour when I perceived a very\nlong way off the head of a camel caravan advancing at swift pace\ntoward us--or almost toward us. It seemed to me to be coming from\nAngora. And it so happened that at the moment when I saw it first\nthe front half of our column had already dipped beyond a rise and\nwas descending a rather gentle slope.\n\nI hurried the tail of the column over the rise by twisting it, as a\nman twists bullocks' tails. And then I bade the whole line halt and\nlie down, except those in charge of horses; them I ordered into the\nshelter of some trees, and the carts I hurried behind a low ridge--all\nexcept Ranjoor Singh's cart; that I ordered backed into a hollow\nnear me. So we were invisible unless the camels should approach too\nclose.\n\nThe Turks and Tugendheim I saw placed in the midst of all the other\nunmounted men, and ordered them guarded like felons; and I bade\nthose in charge of mules and horses stand by, ready to muzzle their\nbeasts with coats or what-not, to prevent neighing and braying. Then\nI returned to the top of the rise and lay down, praying to God, with\na trooper beside me who might run and try to shake Ranjoor Singh\nback to life in case of direst need.\n\nI lay and heard my heart beat like a drum against the ground,\npraying one moment, and with the next breath cursing some hoof-beat\nfrom behind me and the muffled reprimand that was certain to follow\nit. The men were as afraid as I, and the thing I feared most of all\nwas panic. Yet what more could I do than I had done? I lay and\nwatched the camels, and every step that brought them nearer felt\nlike a link in a chain that bound us all.\n\nOne thing became perfectly evident before long. There were not more\nthan two hundred camels, therefore in a fight we should be able to\nbeat them off easily. But unless we could ambuscade them (and there\nwas no time to prepare that now) it would be impossible to kill or\ncapture them all. Some would get away and those would carry the\nalarm to the nearest military post. Then gone would be all hope for\nus of evading capture or destruction. But it was also obvious to me\nthat no such caravan would come straight on toward us at such speed\nif it knew of our existence or our whereabouts. They expected us as\nlittle as we expected them.\n\nSo I lay still, trembling, wondering what Ranjoor Singh would say to\nme, supposing he did not die in the cart there--wondering what the\nmatter might be with Ranjoor Singh--wondering what I should do\nsupposing he did die and we escaped from this present predicament. I\nknew there was little hope of my maintaining discipline without\nRanjoor Singh's aid. And I had not the least notion whither to lead,\nunless toward Russia.\n\nSuch thoughts made me physically sick, so that it was relief to turn\naway from them and watch the oncoming caravan, especially as I began\nto suspect it would not come within a mile of us. Presently I began\nto be certain that it would cross our track rather less than a mile\naway. I began to whisper to myself excitedly. Then at last \"Yes!\"\nsaid I, aloud.\n\n\"Yes!\" said a voice beside me, and I nearly jumped out of my skin,\n\"unless they suspect the track of our cart-wheels and follow it up,\nwe are all right!\"\n\nI looked round into the eyes of Ranjoor Singh, and felt my whole\nskin creep like a snake's at sloughing time!\n\n\"Sahib!\" said I.\n\n\"You have done well enough,\" said he, \"except that if attacked you\nwould have hard work to gather your forces and control them. But\nnever mind, you did quite well enough for this first time!\" said\nRanjoor Singh.\n\n\"Sahib!\" I said. \"But I thought you were in a cart, dying!\"\n\n\"In a cart, yes!\" he said. \"Dying, no--although that was no fault of\nsomebody's!\"\n\nI begged him to explain, and while we watched the camels cross our\ntrack--(God knows, sahib, why they did not grow suspicious and\nfollow along it)--he told me how he had sat on the great rock, not\nvery sleepy, but thinking, chin on knee, when suddenly some man\ncrawled up from behind and struck him a heavy blow.\n\n\"Feel my head,\" said he, and I felt under his turban. There was a\nbruise the size of my folded fist. I swore--as who would not? \"Is it\ndeep?\" I said, still watching the camels, and before he answered me\nhe sent the trooper to go and find his horse.\n\n\"Superficial,\" he said then. \"By the favor of God but a water\nbruise. My head must have yielded beneath the blow.\"\n\n\"Who struck it?\" said I, scarcely thinking what I said, for my mind\nwas full of the camels, now flank toward us, that would have served\nour purpose like the gift of God could we only have contrived to\ncapture them.\n\n\"How should I know?\" he answered. \"See--they pass within a half-mile\nof where I sat. Is not that the rock?\" And I said yes.\n\n\"Had you lingered there,\" he said, \"word about us would have gone\nback to Angora at top camel speed. What possessed you to come away?\"\n\n\"God!\" said I, and he nodded, so that I began to preen myself. He\nnoticed my gathering self-esteem.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he said, aloud, but as if talking to himself, yet\ncareful that I should hear, \"had this not happened to me I should\nhave seen those camels on the sky-line. Did you count the camels?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and eight,\" said I.\n\n\"How many armed men with them?\" he asked. \"My eyes are yet dim from\nthe blow.\"\n\n\"One hundred and four,\" said I, \"and an officer or two.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"The prisoners would have been a nuisance,\" he said, \"yet\nwe might have used them later. What with camels and what with\nhorses--and there is a good spot for an ambuscade through which they\nmust pass presently--I went and surveyed it while they cooked my\ndinner--never mind, never mind!\" said he. \"If you had made a mistake\nit would have been disastrous. Yet--two hundred and eight camels\nwould have been an acquisition--a great acquisition!\"\n\nSo my self-esteem departed--like water from a leaky goatskin, and I\nlay beside him watching the last dozen camels cross our trail, the\nnose of one tied to the tail of another, one man to every two. I lay\nconjecturing what might have been our fate had I had cunning enough\nto capture that whole caravan, and not another word was spoken\nbetween us until the last two camels disappeared beyond a ridge.\nThen:\n\n\"Was there any man close by, when you found me?\" asked Ranjoor\nSingh.\n\n\"Nay, sahib,\" said I.\n\n\"Was there any man whose actions, or whose words, gave ground for\nsuspicion?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, sahib,\" I began; but I checked myself, and he noticed it.\n\n\"Except--?\" said he.\n\n\"Except that when Gooja Singh came,\" I said, \"he seemed unwilling to\nbelieve you were asleep.\"\n\n\"How long was it before Gooja Singh came?\" he asked.\n\n\"He came almost before I had laid you under the tree and covered\nyou,\" said I.\n\n\"And you told him I was asleep?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; and at that he laughed silently, although I could\ntell well enough that his head ached, and merriment must have been a\nlong way from him.\n\n\"Has Gooja Singh any very firm friend with us?\" he asked, and I\nanswered I did not know of one. \"The ammunition bearers who were his\nfriends now curse him to his face,\" I said.\n\n\"Then he would have to do his own dirty work?\" said he.\n\n\"He has to clean his own rifle,\" I answered. And Ranjoor Singh\nnodded.\n\nThen suddenly his meaning dawned on me. \"You think it was Gooja\nSingh who struck the blow?\" I asked. We were sitting up by that\ntime. The camels were out of sight. He rose to his feet and beckoned\nfor his horse before he answered.\n\n\"I wished to know who else might properly be suspected,\" he said,\ntaking his horse's bridle. So I beckoned for my horse, and ordering\nthe cart in which he had lain to be brought along after us, I rode\nat a walk beside him to where our infantry were left in hiding.\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said, \"it is better after all to shoot this Gooja Singh.\nShoot him on suspicion!\" I urged. \"He makes only trouble and\nill-will. He puts false construction on every word you or I utter. He\nmisleads the men. And now you suspect him of having tried to kill\nyou! Bid me shoot him, sahib, and I obey!\"\n\n\"Who says I suspect him?\" he answered. \"Nay, nay, nay! I will have\nno murder done--no drumhead tyranny, fathered by the lees of fear!\nLet Gooja Singh alone!\"\n\n\"Does your head not ache?\" I asked him.\n\n\"More than you guess!\" said he. \"But my heart does not ache. Two\naches would be worse than one. Come silently!\"\n\nSo I rode beside him silently, and making a circuit and signaling to\nthe watchers not to betray our presence, we came on our hiding\ninfantry unsuspected by them. We dismounted, and going close on foot\nwere almost among them before they knew. Gooja Singh was on his feet\nin their midst, giving them information and advice.\n\n\"I tell you Ranjoor Singh is dead!\" said he. \"Hira Singh swears he\nis only asleep, but Hira Singh lies! Ranjoor Singh lies dead on top\nof the corn in the cart in yonder gully, and Hira Singh--\"\n\nI know not what more he would have said, but Ranjoor Singh stopped\nhim. He stepped forward, smiling.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh, as you see, is alive,\" he said, \"and if I am dead,\nthen I must be the ghost of Ranjoor Singh come among you to enforce\nhis orders! Rise!\" he ordered. \"Rise and fall in! Havildars, make\nall ready to resume the march!\"\n\n\"Shoot him, sahib!\" I urged, taking out my pistol, that had once\nbeen Tugendheim's. \"Shoot him, or let me do it!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" he said, laughing in my face, though not unkindly. \"I am\nnot afraid of him.\"\n\n\"But I, sahib,\" I said. \"I fear him greatly!\"\n\n\"Yet thou and I be two men, and I command,\" he answered gently. \"Let\nGooja Singh alone.\"\n\nSo I went and grew very busy ordering the column. In twenty minutes\nwe were under way, with a screen of horsemen several hundred yards\nahead and another little mounted rear-guard. But when the order had\nbeen given to resume the march and the carts were squeaking along in\nsingle file, I rode to his side again with a question. I had been\nthinking deeply, and it seemed to me I had the only answer to my\nthoughts.\n\n\"Tell me, sahib,\" I said, \"our nearest friends must be the Russians.\nHow many hundred miles is it to Russia?\"\n\nBut he shook his head and laughed again. \"Between us and Russia lies\nthe strongest of all the Turkish armies,\" he said. \"We could never\nget through.\"\n\n\"I am a true man!\" I said. \"Tell me the plan!\" But he only nodded,\nand rode on.\n\n\"God loves all true men,\" said he.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nWhere the weakest joint is, smite.--RANJOOR SINGH.\n\n\nWell, sahib, Abraham caught up with us on the evening of the third\nday after leaving with that letter to the Germans in Angora, having\nridden moderately to spare his horse. He said there were only two\nGerman officers there when he reached the place, and they seemed\nworried. They gave him the new saddle asked for, and a new horse\nunder it; also a letter to carry back. Ranjoor Singh gave me the\nhorse and saddle, letting Abraham take my sorry beast, that was\nbeginning to recover somewhat under better treatment.\n\nRanjoor Singh smiled grimly as he read the letter. He translated\nparts of it to me--mainly complaints about lack of this and that and\nthe other thing, and very grave complaints against the Turks, who,\nit seemed, would not cooperate. You would say that was good news to\nall of us, that should have inspired us with new spirit. But as I\nsaid in the beginning, sahib, there are reasons why the British must\nrule India yet a while. We Sikhs, who would rule it otherwise, are\nall divided.\n\nWe were seven non-commissioned officers. If we seven had stood\nunited behind Ranjoor Singh there was nothing we could not have\ndone, for the men would then have had no example of disunity. You\nmay say that Ranjoor Singh was our rightful officer and we had only\nto obey him, but I tell you, sahib, obedience that is worth anything\nmust come from the heart and understanding. Ranjoor Singh was as\nmuch dependent on good-will as if we had had the choosing of him. So\nhe had to create it, and that which has once been lost, for whatever\nreason, is doubly and redoubly hard to make again. He did what he\ndid in spite of us, although I tried to help.\n\nOf us seven, first in seniority came I; and as I have tried already\nto make clear I was Ranjoor. Singh's man (not that he believed it\naltogether yet). If he had ordered me to make black white, I would\nhave perished in the effort to obey; but I had yet to prove that.\n\nNext in order to me was Gooja Singh, and although I have spared the\nregiment's shame as much as possible, I doubt not that man's spirit\nhas crept out here and there between my words--as a smell creeps\nfrom under coverings. He hated me, being jealous. He hated Ranjoor\nSingh, because of merited rebuke and punishment. He was all for\nhimself, and if one said one thing, he must say another, lest the\nfirst man get too much credit. Furthermore, he was a BADMASH,\n[Footnote: Low ruffian.] born of a money-lender's niece to a man\nmean enough to marry such. Other true charges I could lay against\nhim, but my tale is of Ranjoor Singh and why should I sully it with\nmean accounts; Gooja Singh must trespass in among it, but let that\nbe all.\n\nThird of us daffadars in order of seniority was Anim Singh, a big\nman, born in the village next my father's. He was a naik in the\nTirah in '97 when he came to the rescue of an officer, splitting the\nskull of an Orakzai, wounding three others, and making prisoner a\nfourth who sought to interfere. Thus he won promotion, and he held\nit after somewhat the same manner. A blunt man. A fairly good man. A\nvery good man with the saber. A gambler, it is true--but whose\naffair is that? A ready eye for rustling curtains and footholds near\nopen windows, but that is his affair again--until the woman's\nhusband intervenes. And they say he can look after himself in such\ncases. At least, he lives. Behold him, sahib. Aye, that is he\nyonder, swaggering as if India can scarcely hold him--that one with\nhis arm in a sling. A Sikh, sahib, with a soldier's heart and ears\ntoo big for his head--excellent things on outpost, where the little\nnoises often mean so much, but all too easy for Gooja Singh to\nwhisper into.\n\nOf the other four, the next was Ramnarain Singh, the shortest as to\ninches of us all, but perhaps the most active on his feet. A man\nwith a great wealth of beard and too much dignity due to his\nfather's THALUKDARI [Footnote: Landed estate.] His father pockets\nthe rent of three fat villages, so the son believes himself a\nwisehead. A great talker. Brave in battle, as one must be to be\ndaffadar of Outram's Own, but too assertive of his own opinion. He\nand Gooja Singh were ever at outs, resentful of each other's claim\nto wisdom.\n\nNext was Chatar Singh, like me, son and grandson of a soldier of the\nraj--a bold man, something heavy on his horse, but able to sever a\nsheep in two with one blow of his saber--very well regarded by the\ntroopers because of physical strength and willingness to overlook\noffenses. Chatar Singh's chief weakness was respect for cunning.\nHaving only a great bull's heart in him and ability to go forward\nand endure, he regarded cunning as very admirable; and so Gooja\nSingh had one daffadar to work on from the outset (although I did\nwhat I could to make trouble between them).\n\nThe remaining two non-commissioned officers were naiks--corporals,\nas you would say--Surath Singh and Mirath Singh, both rather\nrecently promoted from the ranks and therefore likely to see both\nsides to a question (whereas a naik should rightly see but one).\nVery early I had taken those two naiks in hand, showing them\nfriendship, harping on the honor and pleasure of being daffadar and\non the chance of quick promotion.\n\nGiven a British commanding officer--just one British officer--even a\nlittle young one--one would have been enough--it would have been\nhard to find better backing for him. Even Gooja Singh would scarcely\nhave failed a British leader. But not only was the feeling still\nstrong against Ranjoor Singh; there was another cloud in the sky.\nDid the sahib ever lay his hands on loot? No? Ah! Love of that runs\nin the blood, and crops out generation after generation!\n\nUntil the British came and overthrew our Sikh kingdom--and that was\nnot long ago--loot was the staff of life of all Sikh armies. In\nthose days when an army needed pay there was a war. Now, except for\none month's pay that, as I have told, the Germans had given us, we\nhad seen no money since the day when we surrendered in that Flanders\ntrench; and what the Germans gave us Ranjoor Singh took away, in\norder to bribe the captain of a Turkish ship. And Gooja Singh swore\nmorning, noon and night that as prisoners of war we should not be\nentitled to pay from the British in any event, even supposing we\ncould ever contrive to find the British and rejoin them.\n\n\"Let us loot, then, and pay ourselves!\" was the unanimous verdict, I\nbeing about the only one who did not voice it. I claim no credit. I\nsaw no loot, so what was the use of talking? We were crossing a\ndesert where a crow could have found small plunder. But being by\ncommon consent official go-between I rode to Ranjoor Singh's side\nand told him what the men were saying.\n\n\"Aye,\" he nodded, not so much as looking sidewise, \"any one would\nknow they are saying that. What say the Turk and Tugendheim?\"\n\n\"Loot, too!\" said I, and he grunted.\n\nIt was this way, sahib. Our Turkish officer prisoner was always put\nwith his forty men to march in front--behind our advance guard but\nin front of the carts and infantry. Thus there was no risk of his\nescaping, because for one thing he had no saddle and rode with much\ndiscomfort and so unsafely that he preferred to march on foot more\noften than not; and for another, that arrangement left him never out\nof sight of nearly all of us. One of us daffadars would generally\nmarch beside him, and some of the Syrian muleteers had learned\nEnglish either in Egypt or the Levant ports, so that there was no\nlack of interpreters. I myself have marched beside the Turk for\nmiles and miles on end, with Abraham translating for us.\n\n\"Why not loot? Who can prevent you? Who shall call you to account?\"\nwas the burden of the Turk's song.\n\nAnd Tugendheim, who spoke our tongue fluently, marched as a rule\namong the men, or rode with the mounted men, watched day and night\nby the four troopers who had charge of him--better mounted than he,\nand very mindful of their honor in the matter. He made himself as\nagreeable as he could, telling tales about his life in India--not\nproper tales to tell to a sahib, but such as to make the troopers\nlaugh; so that finally the things he said began to carry the weight\nthat goes with friendliness. He soon discovered what the feeling was\ntoward Ranjoor Singh, and somehow or other he found out what the\nTurk was talking about. After that he took the Turk's cue (although\nhe sincerely despised Turks) and began with hint and jest to\npropagate lust for loot in the men's minds. Partly, I think, he\nplanned to enrich himself and buy his way to safety--(although God\nknows in which direction he thought safety lay!). Partly, I think,\nhe hoped to bring us to destruction, and so perhaps offset his\noffense of having yielded to our threats, hoping in that way to\nrehabilitate himself. So goes a lawyer to court, sure of a fee if\nhis client wins, yet sure, too, of a fee if his client loses,\nenjoying profit and entertainment in any event. Yet who shall blame\nTugendheim? Unlike a lawyer, he stood to take the consequences if\nboth forks of the stick should fail. I told Ranjoor Singh all that\nTugendheim and the Turk were saying to the men, and his brow\ndarkened, although he made no comment. He did not trust me yet any\nmore than he felt compelled to.\n\n\"Send Abraham to me,\" he said at last. So I went and sent Abraham,\nfeeling jealous that the Syrian should hear what I might not.\n\nRanjoor Singh had been forcing the pace, and by the time I speak of\nnow we had nearly crossed that desert, for a rim of hills was in\nfront of us and all about. It was not true desert, such as we have\nin our Punjab, but a great plain already showing promise of the\nspring, with the buds of countless flowers getting ready to burst\nopen; when we lay at rest it amused us to pluck them and try to\ndetermine what they would look like when their time should come. And\nbesides flowers there were roots, remarkably good to eat, that the\nSyrians called \"daughters of thunder,\" saying that was the local\nname. Tugendheim called them truffles. A little water and that\ndesert would be fertile farm-land, or I never saw corn grow!\n\nRanjoor Singh conversed with Abraham until we entered a defile\nbetween the hills; and that night we camped in a little valley with\nour outposts in a ring around us, Ranjoor Singh sitting by a bright\nfire half-way up the side of a slope where he could overlook us all\nand be alone. We had seen mounted men two or three times that day,\nthey mistaking us perhaps for Turkish troops, for they vanished\nafter the first glimpse. Nevertheless, we tethered our horses close\nin the valley bottom, and lay around them, ready for all\ncontingencies.\n\nI remember that night well, for it was the first since we started\neastward in the least to resemble our Indian nights. It made us feel\nhomesick, and some of the men were crooning love-songs. The stars\nswung low, looking as if a man could almost reach them, and the\nsmoke of our fires hung sweet on the night air. I was listening to\nAbraham's tales about Turks--tales to make a man bite his beard--when\nRanjoor Singh called me in a voice that carried far without\nmaking much noise. (I have never known him to raise his voice so\nhigh or loud that it lost dignity.) \"Hira Singh!\" he called, and I\nanswered \"Ha, sahib!\" and went clambering up the hill.\n\nHe let me stand three minutes, reading my eyes through the darkness,\nbefore he motioned me to sit. So then we sat facing, I on one side\nof the fire and he the other.\n\n\"I have watched you, Hira Singh,\" he said at last. \"Now and again I\nhave seemed to see a proper spirit in you. Nay, words are but\nfragments of the wind!\" said he. (I had begun to make him\nprotestations.) \"There are words tossing back and forth below,\" he\nsaid, looking past me down into the hollow, where shadows of men\nwere, and now and then the eye of a horse would glint in firelight.\nThen he said quietly, \"The spirit of a Sikh requires deeds of us.\"\n\n\"Deeds in the dark?\" said I, for I hoped to learn more of what was\nin his mind.\n\n\"Should a Sikh's heart fail him in the dark?\" he asked.\n\n\"Have I failed you,\" said I, \"since you came to us in the prison\ncamp?\"\n\n\"Who am I?\" said he, and I did not answer, for I wondered what he\nmeant. He said no more for a minute or two, but listened to our\npickets calling their numbers one to another in the dark above us.\n\n\"If you serve me,\" he said at last, \"how are you better than the\nstable-helper in cantonments who groomed my horse well for his own\nbelly's sake? I can give you a full belly, but your honor is your\nown. How shall I know your heart?\"\n\nI thought for a long while, looking up at the stars. He was not\nimpatient, so I took time and considered well, understanding him\nnow, but pained that he should care nothing for my admiration.\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said finally, \"by this oath you shall know my heart.\nShould I ever doubt you, I will tear out your heart and lay it on a\ndung-hill.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said he. But I remember he made me no threat in return, so\nthat even to this day I wonder how my words sounded in his ears. I\nam left wondering whether I was man enough to dare swear such an\noath. If he had sworn me a threat in return I should have felt more\nat ease--more like his equal. But who would have gained by that? My\nheart and my belly are not one. Self-satisfaction would not have\nhelped.\n\n\"Soon,\" he said, looking into my eyes beside the fire, \"we shall\nmeet opportunities for looting. Yet we have food enough for men and\nmules and horses for many a day to come; and as the corn grows less\nmore men can ride in the carts, so that we shall move the swifter.\nBut now this map of mine grows vague and our road leads more and\nmore into the unknown. We need eyes ahead of us. I can control the\nmen if I stay with them, but in that case who shall ride on and\nprocure intelligence?\"\n\nIn a flash I saw his meaning. There was none but he wise enough to\nride ahead. But who else could control the men--men who believed\nthey had sloughed the regiment's honor in a Flanders trench and a\nGerman prison camp? They were sloughing their personal honor that\nminute, fraternizing with Turkish prisoners. With their sense of\nhonor gone, could even Ranjoor Singh control them? Perhaps! But if\nRanjoor Singh rode forward, who should stay behind and stand in his\nshoes?\n\nI looked at the stars, that had the color of jewels in them. I\nlistened to the night birds. I heard the wind soughing--the mules\nand horses stamping--the murmur of men's voices. My tongue itched to\nsay some foolish word, that would have proved me unfit to be trusted\nout of sight. But the thought came to me to be still and listen. And\nstill I remained until he began again.\n\n\"If I told the men what the true position is they would grow\ndesperate,\" he said. \"They would believe the case hopeless.\"\n\n\"They almost believe that now!\" said I.\n\n\"Have the Turk and Tugendheim been kept apart?\" said he.\n\n\"Aye,\" I answered. \"They have not had ten words together.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said he. \"Neither Turk nor Tugendheim knows the whole truth,\nbut if they get together they might concoct a very plausible,\nmisleading tale.\"\n\n\"They would better have been bound and gagged,\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"If I had bound and gagged them it would have\nestablished sympathy between them, and they would have found some\nway of talking nevertheless. Kept apart and let talk, the Turk will\nsay one thing, Tugendheim another.\"\n\n\"True,\" said I. \"For now the Turk advises plunder to right and left,\nand settlement afterward among Armenian villages. He says there are\nwomen to be had for the taking. 'Be a new nation!' says he.\"\n\n\"And what says Tugendheim?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"'Plunder!'\" said I. \"'Plunder and push northward into Russia! The\nRussians will welcome you,' says he, 'and perhaps accept me into\ntheir secret service!--Plunder the Turks!' says Tugendheim. 'Plunder\nthe Armenians!' says the Turk.\"\n\n\"I, too, would be all for Russia,\" he answered, \"but it isn't\npossible. The coast of the Black Sea, and from the Black Sea down to\nthe Persian frontier, is held by a very great Turkish army. The main\ncaravan routes lie to the north of us, and every inch of them is\nwatched.\"\n\n\"I am glad then that it must be Egypt,\" said I. \"A long march, but\nfriends at the other end. Who but doubts Russians?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Syria and Palestine,\" he said, \"are full of an\narmy gathering to invade Egypt. It eats up the land like locusts. An\nelephant could march easier unseen into a house than we into Syria!\"\n\n\"So we must double back?\" said I. \"Good! By now they must have\nceased looking for us, supposing they ever thought us anything but\ndrowned. Somewhere we can surely find a ship in which to cross to\nGallipoli!\"\n\nHe laughed and shook his head again. \"We slipped through the one\nunguarded place,\" he said. \"If we had come one day later that place,\ntoo, would have been held by some watchful one, instead of by the\nfool we found in charge.\"\n\nThen at last I thought surely I knew what his objective MUST be. It\nhad been common talk in Flanders how an expedition marched from\nBasra up the Tigris.\n\n\"Bagdad!\" I said. \"We march to Bagdad to join the British there!\nBagdad is good!\"\n\nBut he answered, \"Bagdad is not yet taken--not yet nearly taken.\nBetween us and Bagdad lies a Turkish army of fifty or sixty thousand\nmen at least.\"\n\nI sat silent. I can draw a map of the world and set the rivers and\ncities and boundaries down; so I knew that if we could go neither\nnorth--nor south--nor westward, there remained only eastward,\nstraight-forward into Persia. He read my thoughts, and nodded.\n\n\"Persia is neutral,\" he said, with a wave of his hand that might\nmean anything. \"The Turks have spared no army for one section of the\nPersian frontier, choosing to depend on savage tribes. And the\nGermans have given them Wassmuss to help out.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, making ready to learn at last who Wassmuss might be.\n\"When we have found this Wassmuss, are we to make him march with us\nlike Tugendheim?\"\n\n\"If what the Germans in Stamboul said of him is only half-true,\" he\nanswered, \"we shall find him hard to catch. Wassmuss is a remarkable\nman. Before the war he was consul in Bagdad or somewhere, and he\nmust have improved his time, for he knows enough now to keep all the\ntribes stirred up against Russians and British. The Germans send him\nmoney, and he scatters it like corn among the hens; but the money\nwould be little use without brains. The Germans admire him greatly,\nand he certainly seems a man to be wondered at. But he is the one\nweak point, nevertheless--the only key that can open a door for us.\"\n\n\"But if he is too wary to be caught?\" said I.\n\n\"Who knows?\" he answered with another of those short gruff laughs.\n\"But I know this,\" said he, \"that from afar hills look like a blank\nwall, yet come closer and the ends of valleys open. Moreover, where\nthe weakest joint is, smite! So I shall ride ahead and hunt for that\nweakest joint, and you shall shepherd the men along behind me. Go\nand bring Abraham and the Turk!\"\n\nI went and found them. Abraham was already asleep, no longer wearing\nthe Turkish private soldier's uniform but his own old clothes again\n(because, the Turkish soldier having done nothing meriting\npunishment, Ranjoor Singh had ordered him his uniform returned). I\nawoke him and together we went and found the Turk sitting between a\nSyrian and Gooja Singh; and although I did not overhear one word of\nwhat they were saying, I saw that Gooja Singh believed I had been\nlistening. It seemed good to me to let him deceive himself, so I\nsmiled as I touched the Turk's shoulder.\n\n\"Lo! Here is our second-in-command!\" sneered Gooja Singh, but I\naffected not to notice.\n\n\"Come!\" said I, showing the Turk slight courtesy, and, getting up\nclumsily like a buffalo out of the mud, he followed Abraham and me.\nSome of the men made as if to come, too, out of curiosity, but Gooja\nSingh recalled them and they clustered round him.\n\nWhen I had brought the Turk uphill to the fire-side, Ranjoor Singh\nhad only one word to say to him.\n\n\"Strip!\" he ordered.\n\nAye, sahib! There and then, without excuse or explanation, he made\nthe Turkish officer remove his clothes and change with Abraham; and\nI never saw a man more unwilling or resentful! Abraham had told me\nall about Turkish treatment of Syrians, and it is the way of the\nworld that men most despise those whom they most ill-treat. So that\nalthough Turks have no caste distinctions that I know of, that one\nfelt like a high-caste Brahman ordered to change garments with a\nsweeper. He looked as if he would infinitely rather die.\n\n\"Hurry!\" Ranjoor Singh ordered him in English.\n\n\"HURRIET?\" said the Turk. HURRIET is their Turkish for LIBERTY. All\nthe troops in Stamboul used it constantly, and Ranjoor Singh told me\nit means much the same as the French cry of \"Liberty, Equality,\nFraternity!\" The Turk seemed bewildered, and opened his eyes wider\nthan ever; but whatever his thoughts were about \"HURRIET\" he rightly\ninterpreted the look in Ranjoor Singh's eye and obeyed, grimacing\nlike a monkey as he drew on Abraham's dirty garments.\n\n\"You shall wear the rags of a driver of mules if you talk any more\nabout loot to your men or mine!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"If I proposed\nto loot, I would bury you for a beginning, lest there be nothing for\nthe rest of us!\"\n\nHe made Abraham translate that into Turkish, lest the full gist of\nit be lost, and I sat comparing the two men. It was strange to see\nwhat a change the uniform made in Abraham's appearance--what a\nchange, too, came over the Turk. Had I not known, I could never have\nguessed the positions had once been reversed. Abraham looked like an\nofficer. The Turk looked like a peasant. He was a big up-standing\nman, although with pouches under his eyes that gave the lie to his\nlook of strength. Now for the first time Ranjoor Singh set a picked\nguard over him, calling out the names of four troopers who came\nhurrying uphill through the dark.\n\n\"Let your honor and this man's ward be one!\" said he, and they\nanswered \"Our honor be it!\"\n\nHe could not have chosen better if he had lined up the regiment and\ntaken half a day. Those four were troopers whom I myself had singled\nout as men to be depended on when a pinch should come, and I\nwondered that Ranjoor Singh should so surely know them, too.\n\n\"Take him and keep him!\" he ordered, and they went off, not at all\nsorry to be excused from other duties, as now of course they must\nbe. Counting the four who guarded Tugendheim, that made a total of\neight troopers probably incorruptible, for there is nothing, sahib,\nthat can compare with imposing a trust when it comes to making sure\nof men's good faith. Hedge them about with precautions and they will\nrevolt or be half-hearted; impose open trust in them, and if they be\nwell-chosen they will die true.\n\n\"Now,\" said he to me when they were out of hearing, \"I shall take\nwith me one daffadar, one naik, and forty mounted men. Sometimes I\nshall take Abraham, sometimes Tugendheim, sometimes the Turk. This\ntime I shall take the Turk, and before dawn I shall be gone. Let it\nbe known that the best behaved of those I leave with you shall be\npromoted to ride with me--just as my unworthy ones shall be degraded\nto march on foot with you. That will help a little.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said I, \"a little. Which daffadar will you take? That will\nhelp more!\" said I.\n\n\"Gooja Singh,\" he answered, and I marveled.\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said, \"take him out of sight and bury his body! Make an\nend!\" I urged. \"In Flanders they shot men against a wall for far\nless than he has talked about!\"\n\n\"Flanders is one place and this another,\" he answered. \"Should I\nmake those good men more distrustful than they are? Should I shoot\nGooja Singh unless I am afraid of him?\"\n\nI said no more because I knew he was right. If he should shoot Gooja\nSingh the troopers would ascribe it to nothing else than fear. A\nBritish officer might do it and they would say, \"Behold how he\nscorns to shirk responsibility!\" Yet of Ranjoor Singh they would\nhave said, \"He fears us, and behold the butchery begins! Who shall\nbe next?\" Nevertheless, had I stood in his shoes, I would have shot\nand buried Gooja Singh to forestall trouble. I would have shot Gooja\nSingh and the Turk and Tugendheim all three with one volley. And the\nTurk's forty men would have met a like fate at the first excuse. But\nthat is because I was afraid, whereas Ranjoor Singh was not. I\ngreatly feared being left behind to bring the men along, and the\nmore I thought of it, the worse the prospect seemed; so I began to\ntell of things I had heard Gooja Singh say against him, and which of\nthe men I had heard and seen to agree, for there is no good sense in\na man who is afraid.\n\n\"Is it my affair to take vengeance on them, or to lead them into\nsafety?\" he asked. And what could I answer?\n\nAfter some silence he spread out his map where firelight shone on it\nand showed Abraham and me where the Tigris River runs by Diarbekr.\n\"Thus,\" he said, \"we must go,\" pointing with his finger, \"and thus--and\nthus--by Diarbekr, down by the Tigris, by Mosul, into Kurdistan,\nto Sulimanieh, and thence into Persia--a very long march through\nvery wild country. Outside the cities I am told no Turk dare show\nhimself with less than four hundred men at his back, so we will keep\nto the open. If the Turks mistake us for Turks, the better for us.\nIf the tribes mistake us for Turks, the worse for us; for they say\nthe tribes hate Turks worse than smallpox. If they think we are\nTurks they will attack us. We need ride warily.\"\n\n\"It would take more Turks than there are,\" I said, \"to keep our\nruffians from trying to plunder the first city they see! And as for\ntribes--they are in a mood to join with any one who will help make\ntrouble!\"\n\n\"Then it may be,\" he answered quietly, \"that they will not lack\nexercise! Follow me and lend a hand!\" And he led down toward the\ncamp-fires, where very few men slept and voices rose upward like the\nnoise of a quarrelsome waterfall.\n\nJust as on that night when we captured the carts and Turks and\nSyrians, he now used the cover of darkness to reorganize; and the\nvery first thing he did was to make the forty Turkish prisoners\nchange clothes with Syrians--the Turks objecting with much bad\nlanguage and the Syrians not seeming to relish it much, for fear, I\nsuppose, of reprisals. But he made the Turks hand over their rifles,\nas well, to the Syrians; and then, of all unlikely people he chose\nTugendheim to command the Syrians and to drill them and teach them\ndiscipline! He set him to drilling them there and then, with a row\nof fires to see by.\n\nIn the flash of an eye, as you might say, we had thus fifty extra\ninfantry, ten of them neither uniformed nor armed as yet, but all of\nthem at least afraid to run away. Tugendheim looked doubtful for a\nminute, but he was given his choice of that, or death, or of wearing\na Syrian's cast-off clothes and driving mules. He well understood\n(for I could tell by his manner of consenting) that Ranjoor Singh\nwould send him into action against the first Turks we could find,\nthus committing him to further treason against the Central Powers;\nbut he had gone too far already to turn back.\n\nAnd as for the Syrians-they had had a lifetime's experience of\nTurkish treatment, and had recently been taught to associate Germans\nwith Turks; so if Tugendheim should meditate treachery it was\nunlikely his Syrians would join him in it. It was promotion to a new\nlife for them--occupation for Tugendheim, who had been growing bored\nand perhaps dangerous on that account--and not so dreadfully\ndistressing to the Turkish soldiers, who could now ride on the carts\ninstead of marching on weary feet. They had utterly no ambition,\nthose Turkish soldiers; they cared neither for their officer (which\nwas small wonder) nor for the rifles that we took away, which\nsurprised us greatly (for in the absence of lance or saber, we\nregarded our rifles as evidence of manhood). They objected to the\ndirty garments they received in exchange for the uniforms, and they\ndespised us Sikhs for men without religion (so they said!); but it\ndid not seem to trouble them whether they fought on one side or the\nother, or whether they fought at all, so long as they had cigarettes\nand food. Yet I did not receive the impression they were cowards--brutes,\nperhaps, but not cowards. When they came under fire later on\nthey made no effort to desert with the carts to their own side; and\nwhen we asked them why, they said because we fed them! They added\nthey had not been paid for more than eighteen months.\n\nWhy did not Ranjoor Singh make this arrangement sooner, you ask. Why\ndid he wait so long, and then choose the night of all times? Not all\nthoughts are instantaneous, sahib; some seem to develop out of\npatience and silence and attention. Moreover, it takes time for\ncaptured men to readjust their attitude--as the Germans, for\ninstance, well knew when they gave us time for thought in the prison\ncamp at Oescherleben. When we first took the Syrians prisoner they\nwere so tired and timid as to be worthless for anything but driving\ncarts, whereas now we had fed them and befriended them. On the other\nhand, in the beginning, the Turks, if given a chance, would have\nstampeded with the carts toward Angora.\n\nNow that both Turks and Syrians had grown used to being prisoners\nand to obeying us, they were less likely to think independently--in\nthe same way that a new-caught elephant in the keddah is frenzied\nand dangerous, but after a week or two is learning tricks.\n\nAnd as for choosing the night-time for the change, every soldier\nknows that the darkness is on the side of him whose plans are laid.\nHe who is taken unawares must then contend with both ignorance and\ndarkness. Thieves prefer the dark. Wolves hunt in the dark.\nFishermen fish in the dark. And the wise commander who would change\nhis dispositions makes use of darkness, too. Men who might disobey\nby daylight are like lambs when they can not see beyond the light a\ncamp-fire throws.\n\nBut such things are mental, sahib, and not to be explained like the\nfire of heavy guns or the shock tactics of cavalry--although not one\natom less effective. If Ranjoor Singh had lined up the men and\nargued with them, there might have been mutiny. Instead, when he\njudged the second ripe, he made sudden new dispositions in the night\nand gave them something else to think about without suggesting to\ntheir minds that he might be worried about them or suspicious of\nthem. On the contrary, he took opportunity to praise some\nindividuals and distribute merited rewards.\n\nFor instance, he promoted the two naiks, Surath Singh and Mirath\nSingh, to be daffadars on probation, to their very great surprise\nand absolute contentment. The four who guarded Tugendheim he raised\nto the rank of naik, bidding them help Tugendheim drill the Syrians\nwithout relaxing vigilance over him. Then he chose six more troopers\nto be naiks. And of the eighty mounted men he degraded eighteen to\nmarch on foot again, replacing them with more obedient ones. Then at\nlast I understood why he had chosen some grumblers to ride in the\nfirst instance--simply in order that he might make room for\npromotion of others at the proper time, offsetting discontent with\nemulation.\n\nThen of the eighty mounted men he picked the forty best. He gave\nAbraham's saddle to Gooja Singh, set one of the new naiks over the\nleft wing, and Gooja Singh over the right wing of the forty, under\nhimself, and ordered rations for three days to be cooked and served\nout to the forty, including corn for their horses. They had to carry\nit all in the knap-sacks on their own backs, since no one of them\nyet had saddles.\n\nGooja Singh eyed me by firelight while this was going on, with his\ntongue in his cheek, as much as to say I had been superseded and\nwould know it soon. When I affected not to notice he said aloud in\nmy hearing that men who sat on both sides of a fence were never on\nthe right side when the doings happen. And when I took no notice of\nthat he asked me in a very loud voice whether my heart quailed at\nthe prospect of being left a mile or two behind. But I let him have\nhis say. Neither he, nor any of the men, had the slightest idea yet\nof Ranjoor Singh's real plan.\n\nAfter another talk with me Ranjoor Singh was to horse and away with\nhis forty an hour before daybreak, the Turkish officer riding\nbareback in Syrian clothes between the four who had been set to\nguard him. And the sound of the departing hooves had scarcely ceased\ndrumming down the valley when the men left behind with me began to\nput me to a test. Abraham was near me, and I saw him tremble and\nchange color. Sikh troopers are not little baa-lambs, sahib, to be\ndriven this and that way with a twig! Tugendheim, too, ready to\npreach mutiny and plunder, was afraid to begin lest they turn and\ntear him first. He listened with both ears, and watched with both\neyes, but kept among his Syrians.\n\n\"Whither has he gone?\" the men demanded, gathering round me where I\nstooped to feel my horse's forelegs. And I satisfied myself the\npuffiness was due to neither splint nor ring-bone before I answered.\nThere was just a little glimmer of the false dawn, and what with\nthat and the dying fires we could all see well enough. I could see\ntrouble--out of both eyes.\n\n\"Whither rides Ranjoor Singh?\" they demanded.\n\n\"Whither we follow!\" said I, binding a strip from a Syrian's\nloin-cloth round the horse's leg. (What use had the Syrian for it now\nthat he wore uniform? And it served the horse well.)\n\nA trooper took me by the shoulder and drew me upright. At another\ntime he should have been shot for impudence, but I had learned a\nlesson from Ranjoor Singh too recently to let temper get the better\nof me.\n\n\"Thou art afraid!\" said I. \"Thy hand on my shoulder trembles!\"\n\nThe man let his hand fall and laughed to show himself unafraid.\nBefore he could think of an answer, twenty others had thrust him\naside and confronted me.\n\n\"Whither rides Ranjoor Singh? Whither does he ride?\" they asked.\n\"Make haste and tell us!\"\n\n\"Would ye bring him back?\" said I, wondering what to say. Ranjoor\nSingh had told me little more than that we were drawing near the\nneighborhood of danger, and that I was to follow warily along his\ntrack. \"God will put true thoughts in your heart,\" he told me, \"if\nyou are a true man, and are silent, and listen.\" His words were\ntrue. I did not speak until I was compelled. Consider the sequel,\nsahib.\n\n\"Ye have talked these days past,\" said I, \"of nothing but\nloot--loot--loot! Ye have lusted like wolves for lowing cattle! Yet now ye\nask me whither rides Ranjoor Singh! Whither SHOULD he ride? He rides\nto find bees for you whose stings have all been drawn, that ye may\nsuck honey without harm! He rides to find you victims that can not\nstrike back! Sergeant Tugendheim,\" said I, \"see that your Syrians do\nnot fall over one another's rifles! March in front with them,\" I\nordered, \"that we may all see how well you drill them! Fall in,\nall!\" said I, \"and he who wishes to be camp guard when the looting\nbegins, let him be slow about obeying!\"\n\nWell, sahib, some laughed and some did not. The most dangerous said\nnothing. But they all obeyed, and that was the main thing. Not more\nthan an hour and a half after Ranjoor Singh had ridden off our carts\nwere squeaking and bumping along behind us. And within an hour after\nthat we were in action! Aye, sahib, I should say it was less than an\nhour after the start when I halted to serve out ten cartridges\napiece to the Syrians, that Tugendheim might blood them and get\nhimself into deeper water at the same time. He was angry that I\nwould not give him more cartridges, but I told him his men would\nwaste those few, so why should I not be frugal? When the time came I\ndon't think the Syrians hit anything, but they filled a gap and\nserved a double purpose; for after Tugendheim had let them blaze\naway those ten rounds a piece there was less fear than ever of his\ndaring to attempt escape. Thenceforward his prospects and ours were\none. But my tale goes faster than the column did, that could travel\nno faster than the slowest man and the weakest mule.\n\nWe were far in among the hills now--little low hills with broad open\nspaces between, in which thousands of cattle could have grazed. Only\nthere were no cattle. I rode, as Ranjoor Singh usually did, twenty\nor thirty horses' length away on the right flank, well forward,\nwhere I could see the whole column with one quick turn of the head.\nI had ten troopers riding a quarter of a mile in front, and a\nrear-guard of ten more, but none riding on the flanks because to our left\nthe hills were steep and impracticable and to our right I could\ngenerally see for miles, although not always.\n\nWe dipped into a hollow, and I thought I heard rifle shots. I urged\nmy horse uphill, and sent him up a steep place from the top of which\nI had a fine view. Then I heard many shots, and looked, and lo a\nbattle was before my eyes. Not a great battle--really only a\nskirmish, although to my excited mind it seemed much more at first.\nAnd the first one I recognized taking his part in it was Ranjoor\nSingh.\n\nI could see no infantry at all. About a hundred Turkish cavalry were\nbeing furiously attacked by sixty or seventy mounted men who looked\nlike Kurds, and who turned out later really to be Kurds. The Kurds\nwere well mounted, riding recklessly, firing from horseback at full\ngallop and wasting great quantities of ammunition.\n\nThe shooting must have been extremely bad, for I could see neither\ndead bodies nor empty saddles, but nevertheless the Turks appeared\nanxious to escape--the more so because Ranjoor Singh with his forty\nmen was heading them off. As I watched, one of them blew a trumpet\nand they all retreated helter-skelter toward us--straight toward us.\nThere was nothing else they could do, now that they had given way.\nIt was like the letter Y--thus, sahib,--see, I draw in the dust--the\nKurds coming this way at an angle--Ranjoor Singh and his forty\ncoming this way--and we advancing toward them all along the bottom\nstroke of the Y, with hills around forming an arena. The best the\nTurks could do would have been to take the higher ground where we\nwere and there reform, except for the fact that we had come on the\nscene unknown to them. Now that we had arrived, they were caught in\na trap.\n\nThere was plenty of time, especially as we were hidden from view,\nbut I worked swiftly, the men obeying readily enough now that a\nfight seemed certain. I posted Tugendheim with his Syrians in the\ncenter, with the rest of us in equal halves to right and left,\nkeeping Abraham by me and giving Anim Singh, as next to me in\nseniority, command of our left wing. We were in a rough new moon\nformation, all well under cover, with the carts in a hollow to our\nrear. By the time I was ready, the oncoming Turks were not much more\nthan a quarter of a mile away; and now I could see empty saddles at\nlast, for some of the Kurds had dismounted and were firing from the\nground with good effect.\n\nI gave no order to open fire until they came within three hundred\nyards of us. Then I ordered volleys, and the Syrians forthwith made\na very great noise at high speed, our own troopers taking their\ntime, and aiming low as ordered. We cavalrymen are not good shots as\na rule, rather given, in fact, to despising all weapons except the\nlance and saber, and perhaps a pistol on occasion. But the practise\nin Flanders had worked wonders, and at our first volley seven or\neight men rolled out of the saddles, the horses continuing to gallop\non toward us.\n\nThe surprise was so great that the Turks drew rein, and we gave them\nthree more volleys while they considered matters, bringing down a\nnumber of them. They seemed to have no officer, and were much\nconfused. Not knowing who we were, they turned away from us and made\nas if to surrender to the enemy they did know, but the Kurds rode in\non them and in less than five minutes there was not one Turk left\nalive. My men were for rushing down to secure the loot, but it\nseemed likely to me that the Kurds might mistake that for hostility\nand I prevailed on the men to keep still until Ranjoor Singh should\ncome. And presently I saw Ranjoor Singh ride up to the leader of the\nKurds and talk with him, using our Turkish officer prisoner as\ninterpreter. Presently he and the Kurdish chief rode together toward\nus, and the Kurd looked us over, saying nothing. (Ranjoor Singh told\nme afterward that the Kurd wished to be convinced that we were many\nenough to enforce fair play.)\n\nThe long and the short of it was that we received half the captured\nhorses--that is, thirty-five, for some had been killed--and all the\nsaddles, no less than ninety of them, besides mauser rifles and\nuniforms for our ten unarmed Syrians. The Kurds took all the\nremainder, watching to make sure that the Syrians, whom we sent to\nhelp themselves to uniforms, took nothing else. When the Kurds had\nfinished looting, they rode away toward the south without so much as\na backward glance at us.\n\nI asked Ranjoor Singh how Turkish cavalry had come to let themselves\nget caught thus unsupported, and he said he did not know.\n\n\"Yet I have learned something,\" he said. \"I shot the Turkish\ncommander's horse myself, and my men pounced on him. That\ndemoralized his men and made the rest easy. Now, I have questioned\nthe Turk, and between him and the Kurdish chief I have discovered\ngood reason to hurry forward.\"\n\n\"I would weigh that Kurd's information twice!\" said I. \"He cut those\nTurks down in cold blood. What is he but a cutthroat robber?\"\n\n\"Let him weigh what I told him, then, three times!\" he answered with\na laugh. \"Have you any men hurt?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Then give me a mile start, and follow!\" he ordered. And in another\nminute he was riding away at the head of his forty, slowly for sake\nof the horses, but far faster than I could go with all those laden\ncarts. And I had to give a start of much more than a mile because of\nthe trouble we had in fitting the saddles to our mounts. I wished he\nhad left the captured Turkish officer behind to explain his nation's\ncursed saddle straps!\n\nWe rode on presently over the battle-ground; and although I have\nseen looting on more than one battlefield I have never seen anything\nso thorough as the work those Kurds had done. They had left the dead\nnaked, without a boot, or a sock, or a rag of cloth among them. Here\nand there fingers had been hacked off, for the sake of rings, I\nsuppose. There were vultures on the wing toward the dead, some\nlooking already half-gorged, which made me wonder. I wondered, too,\nwhither the Kurds had ridden off in such a hurry. What could be\nhappening to the southward? Ranjoor Singh had gone due east.\n\nIt was not long before Ranjoor Singh rode out of sight in a cloud of\ndust, disappearing between two low hills that seemed to guard the\nrim of the hollow we were crossing. At midday I let the column rest\nin the cleft between those hills, not troubling to climb and look\nbeyond because the men were turbulent and kept me watchful, and also\nbecause I knew well Ranjoor Singh would send back word of any danger\nahead. And so he did. I was sitting eating my own meal when his\nmessenger came galloping through the gap with a little slip of\ntwisted paper in his teeth.\n\n\"Bring them along,\" said the message. \"Don't halt again until you\novertake me.\"\n\nSo I made every one of the mounted men take up a man behind, and the\nrest of the unmounted men I ordered into the carts, including\nTugendheim's Syrians, judging it better to overtax the animals than\nto be too long on the road. And the long and short of that was that\nwe overtook Ranjoor Singh at about four that afternoon. Our animals\nwere weary, but the men were fit to fight.\n\nRanjoor Singh ordered Abraham to take the Syrians and all the carts\nand horses down into a hollow where there was a water-hole, and to\nwait there for further orders. Tugendheim was bidden come with us on\nfoot; and without any explanation he led us all toward a low ridge\nthat faced us, rising here and there into an insignificant hill. It\nlooked like blown sand over which coarse grass had grown, and such\nit proved to be, for it was on the edge of another desert. It was\nfifty or sixty feet high, and rather difficult to climb, but he led\nus straight up it, cautioning us to be silent and not to show\nourselves on the far side. On the top we crawled forward eighteen or\ntwenty yards on our bellies, until we lay at last gazing downward.\nIt was plain then whence those half-gorged vultures came.\n\nWho shall describe what we saw? Did the sahib ever hear of Armenian\nmassacres? This was worse. If this had been a massacre we would have\nknown what to do, for our Sikh creed bids us ever take the part of\nthe oppressed. But this was something that we did not understand,\nthat held us speechless, each man searching his own heart for\nexplanation, and Ranjoor Singh standing a little behind us watching\nus all.\n\nThere were hundreds of men, women and little children being herded\nby Turks toward the desert--southward. The line was long drawn out,\nfor the Armenians were weary. They had no food with them, no tents,\nand scarcely any clothing. Here and there, in parties at intervals\nalong the line, rode Turkish soldiers; and when an Armenian, man or\nwoman or child, would seek to rest, a Turk would spur down on him\nand prick him back into line with his lance--man, woman or child, as\nthe case might be. Some of the Turks cracked whips, and when they\ndid that the Armenians who were not too far spent would shudder as\nif the very sound had cut their flesh. How did I know they were\nArmenians? I did not know. I learned that afterward.\n\nSome wept. Some moaned. But the most were silent and dry-eyed,\nmoving slowly forward like people in a dream. Oh, sahib, I have had\nbad dreams in my day, and other men have told me theirs, but never\none like that!\n\nThere was a little water-hole below where we lay--the merest cupful\nfed by a trickle from below the hill. Some of them gathered there to\nscoop the water in their hands and drink, and I saw a Turk ride\namong them, spurring his horse back and forward until the water was\nall foul mud. Nevertheless, they continued drinking until he and\nanother Turk flogged them forward.\n\n\"Sahib!\" said I, calling to Ranjoor Singh. \"A favor, sahib!\"\n\nHe came and lay beside me with his chin on his hand. \"What is it?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"The life of that Turk who trod the water into mud!\" said I. \"Let me\nhave the winding up of his career!\"\n\n\"Wait a while!\" said he. \"Let the men watch. Watch thou the men!\"\n\nSo I did watch the men, and I saw cold anger grow among them, like\nan anodyne, making them forget their own affairs. I began to wonder\nhow long Ranjoor Singh would dare let them lie there, unless perhaps\nhe deliberately planned to stir them into uncontrol. But he was\nwiser than to do that. Just so far he meant their wrath should urge\nthem--so far and no further. He watched as one might watch a fuse.\n\n\"Those Kurds of this morning,\" he told me (never taking his eyes off\nthe men) \"hurried off to the southward expecting to meet this very\nprocession. Kurds hate Turks, and Turks fear Kurds, but in this they\nare playing to and fro, each into the other's hands. The Turks drive\nArmenians out into the desert, where the Kurds come down on them and\nplunder. The Turks return for more Armenians, and so the game goes\non. I learned all that from our Turkish officer we took this\nmorning.\"\n\nWhile he spoke a little child died not a hundred yards away from\nwhere I lay. Its mother lay by it and wept, but a Turk spurred down\nand skewered the child's body on his lance, tossing it into the\nmidst of a score of others who went forward dumbly. Another Turk\nriding along behind him thrashed the woman to her feet.\n\n\"That ought to do,\" said Ranjoor Singh, crawling backward out of\nsight and then getting to his feet. Then he called us, and we all\ncrawled backward to the rear edge of the ridge. And there at last we\nstood facing him. I saw Gooja Singh whispering in Anim Singh's great\near. Ranjoor Singh saw it too.\n\n\"Stand forth, Gooja Singh!\" he ordered. And Gooja Singh stood a\nlittle forward from the others, half-truculent and half-afraid.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Ranjoor Singh. \"Of what were you\nwhispering?\" But Gooja Singh did not answer.\n\n\"No need to tell me!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"I know! Ye all seek leave\nto loot! As sons of THALUKDARS [Footnote: Land holder]--as trusted\nsoldiers of the raj--as brave men--honorable men--ye seek to prove\nyourselves!\"\n\nThey gasped at him--all of them, Tugendheim included. I tell you he\nwas a brave man to stand and throw that charge in the teeth of such\na regiment, not one man of whom reckoned himself less than\ngentleman. I looked to my pistol and made ready to go and die beside\nhim, for I saw that he had chosen his own ground and intended there\nand then to overcome or fail.\n\n\"Lately but one thought has burned in all your hearts,\" he told\nthem. \"Loot! Loot! Loot! Me ye have misnamed friend of Germany--friend\nof Turkey--enemy of Britain! Yourselves ye call honorable\nmen!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Gooja Singh, greatly daring because the men were\nlooking to him to answer for them. \"Hitherto we have done no\nshameful thing!\"\n\n\"No shameful thing?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Ye have called me traitor\nbehind my back, yet to my face ye have obeyed me these weeks past.\nYe have used me while it served your purpose, planning to toss me\naside at the first excuse. Is that not shameful? Now we reach the\nplace where ye must do instead of talk. Below is the plunder ye have\nyearned for, and here stand I, between it and you!\"\n\n\"We have yearned for no such plunder as that!\" said Gooja Singh, for\nthe men would have answered unless he did, and he, too, was minded\nto make his bid for the ascendency.\n\n\"No?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"'No carrion for me!' said the jackal. 'I\nonly eat what a tiger killed!'\"\n\nHe folded his arms and stood quite patiently. None could mistake his\nmeaning. There was to be, one way or the other, a decision reached\non that spot as to who sought honor and who sought shame. He himself\nsubmitted to no judgment. It was the regiment that stood on trial! A\nweak man would have stood and explained himself.\n\nPresently Ramnarain Singh, seeing that Gooja Singh was likely to get\ntoo much credit with the men, took up the cudgels and stood forward.\n\n\"Tell us truly, sahib,\" he piped up. \"Are you truly for the raj, or\nis this some hunt of your own on which you lead us?\"\n\n\"Ye might have asked me that before!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Now ye\nshall answer me my question first! When I have your answer, I will\ngive you mine swiftly enough, in deeds not words! What is the\noutcome of all your talk? Below there is the loot, and, as I said,\nhere stand I between it and you! Now decide, what will ye!\"\n\nHe turned his back, and that was bravery again; for under his eye\nthe men were used to showing him respect, whereas behind his back\nthey had grown used to maligning him. Yet he had thrown their shame\nin their very teeth because he knew their hearts were men's hearts.\nTurning his back on jackals would have stung them to worse dishonor.\nHe would not have turned his back on jackals, he would have driven\nthem before him.\n\nIt began to occur to the men that they once made me go-between, and\nthat it was my business to speak up for them now. Many of them\nlooked toward me. They began to urge me. Yet I feared to speak up\nlest I say the wrong thing. Once it had not been difficult to\npretend I took the men's part against Ranjoor Singh, but that was no\nlonger so easy.\n\n\"What is your will?\" said I at last, for Ranjoor Singh continued to\nkeep his back turned, and Gooja Singh and Rarnnarain were seeking to\nforestall each other. Anim Singh and Chatar Singh both strode up to\nme.\n\n\"Tell him we will have none of such plunder as that!\" they both\nsaid.\n\n\"Is that your will?\" I asked the nearest men, and they said \"Aye!\"\nSo I went along the line quickly, repeating the question, and they\nall agreed. I even asked Tugendheim, and he was more emphatic than\nthe rest.\n\n\"Sahib!\" I called to Ranjoor Singh. \"We are one in this matter. We\nwill have none of such plunder as that below!\"\n\nHe turned himself about, not quickly, but as one who is far from\nsatisfied.\n\n\"So-ho! None of SUCH plunder!\" said he. \"What kind of plunder, then?\nWhat is the difference between the sorts of plunder in a stricken\nland?\"\n\nGooja Singh answered him, and I was content that he should, for not\nonly did I not know the answer myself but I was sure that the\nquestion was a trap for the unwary.\n\n\"We will plunder Turks, not wretches such as these!\" said Gooja\nSingh.\n\n\"Aha!\" said Ranjoor Singh, unfolding his arms and folding them\nagain, beginning to stand truculently, as if his patience were\nwearing thin. \"Ye will let the Turks rob the weak ones, in order\nthat ye may rob the Turks! That is a fine point of honor! Ye poor\nlost fools! Have ye no better wisdom than that? Can ye draw no finer\nhairs? And yet ye dare offer to dictate to me, and to tell me\nwhether I am true or not! The raj is well served if ye are its best\nsoldiers!\"\n\nHe spat once, and turned his back again.\n\n\"Ye have said we will have no such plunder!\" shouted Gooja Singh,\nbut he did not so much as acknowledge the words even by a movement\nof the head. Then Gooja Singh went whispering with certain of the\nmen, those who from the first had been most partial to him, and\npresently I saw they were agreed on a course. He stood forward with\na new question.\n\n\"Tell us whither you are leading?\" he demanded. \"Tell us the plan?\"\n\nRanjoor Singh faced about. \"In order that Gooja Singh may interfere\nand spoil the plan?\" he asked, and Ramnarain Singh laughed very loud\nat that, many of the troopers joining. That made Gooja Singh angry,\nand he grew rash.\n\n\"How shall we know,\" he asked, \"whither you lead or whether you be\ntrue or not?\"\n\n\"As to whither I lead,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"God knows that better\nthan I. At least I have led you into no traps yet. And as to whether\nI am true or not, it is enough that each should know his own heart.\nI am for the raj!\" And he drew his saber swiftly, came to the\nsalute, and kissed the hilt.\n\nThen I spoke up, for I saw my opportunity. \"So are we for the raj!\"\nsaid I. \"We too, sahib!\" And it was with difficulty then that I\nrestrained the men from bursting into cheers. Ranjoor Singh held his\nhand up, and we daffadars flung ourselves along the line commanding\nsilence. A voice or two--even a dozen men talking--were inaudible,\nbut the Turks would have heard a cheer.\n\n\"Ye?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Ye for the raj? I thought ye were all for\nloot?\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said Gooja Singh, for he saw his position undermined and\nbegan to grow fearful for consequences. \"We are all for the raj, and\nall were for the raj from the first. It is you who are doubtful!\"\n\nHe thought to arouse feeling again, but the contrast between the one\nman and the other had been too strong and none gave him any backing.\nRanjoor Singh laughed.\n\n\"Have a care, Gooja Singh!\" he warned. \"I promised you court martial\nand reduction to the ranks should I see fit! To your place in the\nrear!\"\n\nSo Gooja Singh slunk back to his place behind the men and I judged\nhim more likely than ever to be dangerous, although for the moment\novercome. But Ranjoor Singh had not finished yet.\n\n\"Then, on one point we are agreed,\" he said. \"We will make the most\nof that. Let us salute our own loyalty to India, and the British and\nthe Allies, with determination to give one another credit at least\nfor that in future! Pre--sent arms!\"\n\nSo we presented arms, he kissing the hilt of his saber again; and it\nwas not until three days afterward that I overheard one of the\ntroopers saying that Gooja Singh had called attention to the fact of\nits being a German saber. For the moment there was no more doubt\namong us; and if Gooja Singh had not begun to be so fearful lest\nRanjoor Singh take vengeance on him there never would have been\ndoubt again. We felt warm, like men who had come in under cover from\nthe cold.\n\nIt was growing dusk by that time, and Ranjoor Singh bade us at once\nto return to where the horses and Syrians waited in the hollow, he\nhimself continuing to sit alone on the summit of the ridge,\nconsidering matters. We had no idea what he would do next, and none\ndared ask him, although many of the men urged me to go and ask. But\nat nightfall he came striding down to us and left us no longer in\ndoubt, for he ordered girths tightened and ammunition inspected.\n\nThe Syrians had no part in that night's doings. They were bidden\nwait in the shadow of the ridge; with mules inspanned, and with\nTugendheim in charge we trusted them, to guard our Turkish\nprisoners. Tugendheim bit his nails and made as if to pull his\nmustache out by the roots, but we suffered no anxiety on his\naccount; his safety and ours were one. He had no alternative but to\nobey.\n\nBefore the moon rose we sent our unmounted men to the top of the\nridge under Chatar Singh, and the rest of us rode in a circuit,\nthrough a gap that Ranjoor Singh had found, to the plain on the far\nside.\n\nThe Turks had driven their convoy into the desert and had camped\nbehind them, nearly three hundred strong. They had made one big fire\nand many little ones, and looked extremely cheerful, what with the\nsmell of cooking and the dancing flame. Their horses were picketed\ntogether in five lines with only a few guards, so that their capture\nwas an easy matter. We caught them entirely by surprise and fell on\nthem from three sides at once, our foot-men from the ridge\ndelivering such a hot fire that some of us were hit. I looked long\nfor the Turk who had fouled the water, and for the other one who had\nlanced the child's body, but failed to identify either of them. I\nfound two who looked like them, crawling out from under a heap of\nslain, and shot them through the head; but as to whether I slew the\nright ones or not I do not know.\n\nThree officers we made prisoner, making five that we had to care\nfor. The other officers were slain. We never knew how few or how\nmany Turks escaped under cover of darkness, but I suspect not more\nthan a dozen or two at the most. Whatever tale they told when they\ngot home again, it is pretty certain they gave the Kurds the blame,\nfor, how should they suppose us to be anything except Kurds?\n\nWe took no loot except the horses and rifles. We stacked the rifles\nin a cart, picked the best horses, taking twenty-five spare ones\nwith us, and gave our worst horses to the Armenians to eat. We sent\na few Syrians in a hurry to warn the Armenians in the desert against\nthose Kurds who had ridden to the south to intercept them, and\ntipped out two cartsful of corn that we could ill spare, putting our\nwounded in the empty carts. We had one-and-twenty wounded, many of\nthem by our own riflemen.\n\nThen we rode on into the night, Ranjoor Singh urging us to utmost\nspeed. The Armenians begged us to remain with them, or to take them\nwith us. Some clung to our stirrups, but we had to shake them loose.\nFor what could we do more than we had done for them? Should we die\nwith them in the desert, serving neither them nor us? We gave them\nthe best advice we could and rode away. We bade them eat, and\nscatter, and hide. And I hope they did.\n\nWe rode on, laughing to think that Kurds would be blamed for our\ndoings, and wondering whether the Armenians had enough spirit left\nto make use of the loot we did not touch. Some of us had lances now;\na few had sabers; all had good mounts and saddles. We were likely to\nmiss the corn we had given away; but to offset that we had a new\nconfidence in Ranjoor Singh that was beyond price, and I sang as I\nrode. I sang the ANAND, our Sikh hymn of joy. I knew we were a\nregiment again at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nSince when did god take sides against the brave?--RANJOOR SINGH.\n\n\nDid the sahib ever chance to hear that Persian proverb--\"DUZD NE\nGIRIFTAH PADSHAH AST\"? No? It means \"The uncaught thief is king.\"\nHo! but thenceforward that was a campaign that suited us! None could\ncatch us, for we could come and go like the night wind, and the\nTurks are heavy on their feet. We helped ourselves to what we\nneeded. And a reputation began to hurry ahead of us that made\nmatters easier, for our numbers multiplied in men's imagination.\n\nThe Turks whom we had recently defeated gave Kurds the credit for\nit, and after the survivors had crawled back home whole Turkish\nregiments were ordered out by telegraph to hunt for raiding Kurds,\nnot us! We cut all the wires we could find uncut, real Kurds having\nattended to the business already in most instances, and now, instead\nof slipping unseen through the land we began to leave our signature,\nand do deliberate damage.\n\nNone can beat Sikhs at such warfare as we waged across the breadth\nof Asiatic Turkey, and none could beat Ranjoor Singh as leader of\nit. We could outride the Turks, outwit them, outfight them, and\noutdare them. As the spring advanced the weather improved and our\nspirits rose; and as we began to take the offensive more and more\nour confidence increased in Ranjoor Singh until there might never\nhave been any doubt of him, except that Gooja Singh was too\nconscious of his own faults to dare let matters be. He was ever on\nthe watch for a chance to make himself safe at Ranjoor Singh's\nexpense. He was a good enough soldier when so minded. All of us\ndaffadars were developing into very excellent troop commanders, and\nhe not least of us; but the more efficient he grew the more\ndangerous he was, for the very good reason that Ranjoor Singh\nscorned to take notice of his hate and only praised him for\nefficiency. Whereas he watched all the time for faults in Ranjoor\nSingh to take advantage of them.\n\nSo I took thought, and used discretion, and chose twelve troopers\nwhom I drafted into Gooja Singh's command by twos and threes, he not\nsuspecting. By ones and twos and threes I took them apart and tested\nthem, saying much the same to each.\n\nSaid I, \"Who mistrusts our sahib any longer?\" And because I had\nchosen them well they each made the same answer. \"Nay,\" said they,\n\"we were fools. He was always truer than any of us. He surrendered\nin that trench that we might live for some such work as this!\"\n\n\"If he were to be slain,\" said I, \"what would now become of us?\"\n\n\"He must not be slain!\" said they.\n\n\"But what if he IS slain?\" I answered. \"Who knows his plans for the\nfuture?\"\n\n\"Ask him to tell his plans,\" said they. \"He trusts you more than any\nof us. Ask and he will tell.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"I have asked and he will not tell. He knows, as well\nas you or I, that not all the men of this regiment have always\nbelieved in him. He knows that none dare kill him unless they know\nhis plans first, for until they have his plans how can they dispense\nwith his leadership?\"\n\n\"Who are these who wish to kill him?\" said they. \"Let there be court\nmartial and a hanging!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"let there be a silence and forgetting, lest too many\nbe involved!\"\n\nThey nodded, knowing well that not one man of us all would escape\ncondemnation if inquiry could be carried back far enough.\n\n\"Let there be much watchfulness!\" said I.\n\n\"Who shall watch Ranjoor Singh?\" said they. \"He is here, there and\neverywhere! He is gone before dawn, and perhaps we see him again at\nnoon, but probably not until night. And half the night he spends in\nthe saddle as often as not. Who shall watch him?\"\n\n\"True!\" said I. \"But if we took thought, and decided who\nmight--perhaps--most desire to kill him for evil recollection's sake, then\nwe might watch and prevent the deed.\"\n\n\"Aye!\" said they, and they understood. So I arranged with Ranjoor\nSingh to have them transferred to Gooja Singh's troop, making this\nexcuse and that and telling everything except the truth about it. If\nI had told him the truth, Ranjoor Singh would have laughed and my\nprecaution would have been wasted, but having lied I was able to\nride on with easier mind--such sometimes being the case.\n\nWe had little trouble in keeping on the horizon whenever we sighted\nTurks in force; and then probably the distance deceived them into\nthinking us Turks, too, for we rode now with no less than five\nTurkish officers as well as a German sergeant. And in the rear of\nlarge bodies of Turks there was generally a defenseless town or\nvillage whose Armenians had all been butchered, and whose other\ninhabitants were mostly too gorged with plunder to show any fight.\nWe helped ourselves to food, clothing, horses, saddlery, horse-feed,\nand anything else that Ranjoor Singh considered we might need, but\nhe threatened to hang the man who plundered anything of personal\nvalue to himself, and none of us wished to die by that means.\n\nWe soon began to need medicines and a doctor badly, for we lost no\nless than eight-and-twenty men between the avenging of those\nArmenians in the desert and reaching the Kurdish mountains, and once\nwe had more than forty wounded at one time. But finally we captured\na Greek doctor, attached to the Turkish army, and he had along with\nhim two mule-loads of medicines. Ranjoor Singh promised him seven\ndeaths for every one of our wounded men who should die of neglect,\nand most of them began to recover very quickly.\n\nIf we had tried merely to plunder; or had raided the same place\ntwice; or, if we had rested merely because we were weary; or, if we\nhad once done what might have been expected of us, I should not now\nsit beneath this tree talking to you, sahib, because my bones would\nbe lying in Asiatic Turkey. But we rode zigzag-wise, very often\ndoubling on our tracks, Ranjoor Singh often keeping half a day's\nmarch ahead of us gathering information.\n\nWhen we raided a town or village we used to tie our Turkish officers\nhand and foot and cover them up in a cart, for we wished them to be\nmistaken for Kurds, not Turks. And in almost the first bazaar we\nplundered were strange hats such as Kurds wear, that gave us when we\nwore them in the dark the appearance, perhaps, of Kurds who had\nstolen strange garments (for the Kurds wear quite distinctive\nclothes, of which we did not succeed in plundering sufficient to\ndisguise us all).\n\nIn more than one town we had to fight for what we took, for there\nwere Turkish soldiers that we did not know about, for all Ranjoor\nSingh's good scouting. Sometimes we beat them off with very little\ntrouble; sometimes we had about enough fighting to warm our hearts\nand terrify the inhabitants. But in one town we were caught\nplundering the bazaar by several hundred Turkish infantry who\nentered from the far side unexpectedly; and if we had not burned the\nbazaar I doubt that we should have won clear of that trap. But the\nsmoke and flame served us for a screen, and we got to the rear of\nthe Turks and killed a number of them before galloping off into the\ndark.\n\nBut who shall tell in a day what took weeks in the doing? I do not\nremember the tenth part of it! We rode, and we skirmished, and we\nplundered, growing daily more proud of Ranjoor Singh, and most of us\nforgetting we had ever doubted him. Once we rode for ten miles side\nby side in the darkness with a Turkish column that had been sent to\nhunt for us! Perhaps they mistook our squeaky old carts for their\ncannon; that had camped for the night unknown to them! Next day we\ntold some Kurds where to find the cannon, and doubtless the Kurds\nmade trouble. We let the column alone, for it was too big for us--about\ntwo regiments, I think. They camped at midnight, and we rode\non.\n\nWe gave our horses all the care we could, but that was none too\nmuch, and we had to procure new mounts very frequently. Often we\npicked up a dozen at a time in the towns and villages, slaying those\nwe left behind lest they be of use to the enemy. Once we wrought a\nmiracle, being nearly at a standstill from hard marching, and almost\nsurrounded by regiments sent out to cut us off. We raided the\nhorse-lines of a Turkish regiment that had camped beside a stream,\nsecuring all the horses we needed and stampeding the remainder! Thus\nwe escaped through the gap that regiment had been supposed to close.\nWe got away with their baked bread, too, enough to last us at least\nthree days! That was not far from Diarbekr.\n\nBy the time we reached the Tigris and crossed it near Diarbekr we\nwere happy men; for we were not in search of idleness; all most of\nus asked was a chance to serve our friends, and making trouble for\nthe Turks was surely service! One way and another we made more\ntrouble than ten times our number could have made in Flanders. Every\none of us but Gooja Singh was happy.\n\nWe crossed the Tigris in the dark, and some of us were nearly\ndrowned, owing to the horses being frightened. We had to abandon our\ncarts, so we burned them; and by the light of that fire we saw great\nmounds of Turkish supplies that they intended to float down the\nriver to Bagdad on strange rafts made of goatskins. The sentries\nguarding the stores put up a little fight, and five more of us were\nwounded, but finally we burned the stores, and the flames were so\nbright and high that we had to gallop for two miles before we could\nbe safe again in darkness. So we crossed at a rather bad place, and\nthere was something like panic for ten minutes, but we got over\nsafely in the end, wounded and all. We floated the wounded men and\nammunition and rations for men and horses across on some of those\nstrange goatskin rafts that go round and round and any way but\nforward. We found them in the long grass by the river-bank.\n\nAt a town on the far side we seized new carts, far better than our\nold ones. And then, because we might have been expected to continue\neastward, we turned to the south and followed the course of the\nTigris, straight into Kurdish country, where it did us no good to\nresemble either Turks or Kurds; for we could not hope to deceive the\nKurds into thinking we were of their tribe, and Turks and Kurds are\nopen enemies wherever the Turks are not strong enough to overawe.\nThey were all Kurds in these parts, and no Turks at all, so that our\nproblem became quite different. After two days' riding over what was\nlittle else than wilderness, Ranjoor Singh made new dispositions,\nand we put the Kurdish headgear in our knapsacks.\n\nIn the first place, the wounded had been suffering severely from the\nlong forced marches and the jolting of the springless carts. Some of\nthem had died, and the Greek doctor had grown very anxious for his\nown skin. Ranjoor Singh summoned him and listened to great\nexplanations and excuses, finally gravely permitting him to live,\nbut adding solemn words of caution. Then he ordered the carts\nabandoned, for there was now no road at all. The forty Turkish\nsoldiers (in their Syrian clothes) were made to carry the wounded in\nstretchers we improvised, until some got well and some died; those\nwho did not carry wounded were made to carry ammunition, and some of\nour own men who had tried to disregard Ranjoor Singh's strict orders\nregarding women of the country were made to help them. That\narrangement lasted until we came to a village where the Kurds were\nwilling to exchange mules against the rifles we had taken from the\nKurds, one mule for one rifle, we refusing to part with any\ncartridges.\n\nAfter that the wounded had to ride on mules, some of them two to a\nmule, holding each other on, and the cartridge boxes were packed on\nthe backs of other mules, except that men who tried to make free\nwith native women were invariably ordered to relieve a mule. Then we\nhad no further use for the forty Turks, so we turned them loose with\nenough food to enable them to reach Diarbekr if they were\neconomical. They went off none too eagerly in their Syrian clothes,\nand I have often wondered whether they ever reached their\ndestination, for the Kurds of those parts are a fierce people, and\nit is doubtful which they would rather ill-treat and kill, a Turk or\na Syrian. The Turks have taught them to despise Armenians and\nSyrians, but they despise Turks naturally. (All this I learned from\nAbraham, who often marched beside me.)\n\n\"Those Turks we have released will go back and set their people on\nour trail,\" said Gooja Singh, overlooking no chance to throw\ndiscredit.\n\n\"If they ever get safely back, that is what I hope they will do!\"\nRanjoor Singh answered. \"We will disturb hornets and pray that Turks\nget stung!\"\n\nHe would give no explanation, but it was not long before we all\nunderstood. Little by little, he was admitting us to confidence in\nthose days, never telling at a time more than enough to arouse\ninterest and hope.\n\nRather than have him look like a Turk any longer, we had dressed up\nAbraham in the uniform of one of our dead troopers; and when at last\na Kurdish chief rode up with a hundred men at his back and demanded\nto know our business, Ranjoor Singh called Abraham to interpret. We\ncould easily have beaten a mere hundred Kurds, but to have won a\nskirmish just then would have helped us almost as little as to lose\none. What we wanted was free leave to ride forward.\n\n\"Where are ye, and whither are ye bound? What seek ye?\" the Kurd\ndemanded, but Ranjoor Singh proved equal to the occasion.\n\n\"We be troops from India,\" said he. \"We have been fighting in Europe\non the side of France and England, and the Germans and Turks have\nbeen so badly beaten that you see for yourself what is happening.\nBehold us! We are an advance party. These Turkish officers you see\nare prisoners we have taken on our way. Behold, we have also a\nGerman prisoner! You will find all the Turks between here and Syria\nin a state of panic, and if plunder is what you desire you would\nbetter make haste and get what you can before the great armies come\neating the land like locusts! Plunder the Turks and prove yourselves\nthe friends of French and English!\"\n\nSahib, those Kurds would rather loot than go to heaven, and, like\nall wild people, they are very credulous. There are Kurds and Kurds\nand Kurds, nations within a nation, speaking many dialects of one\ntongue. Some of them are half-tame and live on the plains; those the\nTurks are able to draft into their armies to some extent. Some of\nthe plainsmen, like those I speak of now, are altogether wild and\nwill not serve the Turks on any terms. And most of the hillmen\nprefer to shoot a Turk on sight. I would rather fight a pig with\nbare hands than try to stand between a Kurd and Turkish plunder, and\nit only needed just those few words of Ranjoor Singh's to set that\npart of the world alight!\n\nWe rode for very many days after that, following the course of the\nTigris unmolested. The tale Ranjoor Singh told had gone ahead of us.\nThe village Kurds waited to have one look, saw our Turkish prisoners\nand our Sikh turbans, judged for themselves, and were off! I believe\nwe cost the Turkish garrisons in those parts some grim fighting; and\nif any Turks were on our trail I dare wager they met a swarm or two\nof hornets more than they bargained for!\n\nInstead of having to fight our way through that country, we were\nwell received. Wherever we found Kurds, either in tents or in\nvillages, the unveiled women would give us DU, as they call their\ncurds and whey, and barley for our horses, and now and then a little\nbread. When other persuasion failed, we could buy almost anything\nthey had with a handful or two of cartridges. They were a savage\npeople, but not altogether unpleasing.\n\nOnce, where the Tigris curved and our road brought us near the\nbanks, by a high cliff past which the river swept at very great\nspeed, we took part in a sport that cost us some cartridges, but no\nrisk, and gave us great amusement. The Kurds of those parts, having\nheard in advance of our tale of victory, had decided, to take the\nnearest loot to hand; so they had made an ambuscade down near the\nriver level, and when we came on the scene we lent a hand from\nhigher up.\n\nRushing down the river at enormous speed (for the stream was narrow\nthere) forced between rocks with a roar and much white foam the\ngoatskin rafts kept coming on their way to Mosul and Bagdad, some\nloaded with soldiers, some with officers, and all with goods on\nwhich the passengers must sit to keep their legs dry. The rafts were\neach managed by two men, who worked long oars to keep them in\nmid-current, they turning slowly round and round.\n\nThe mode of procedure was to volley at them, shooting, if possible,\nthe men with oars, but not despising a burst goatskin bag. In case\nthe men with oars were shot, the others would try to take their\nplace, and, being unskilful, would very swiftly run the raft against\na rock, when it would break up and drown its passengers, the goods\ndrifting ashore at the bend in the river in due time.\n\nOn the other hand, when a few goatskin bags were pierced the raft\nwould begin to topple over and the men with oars would themselves\ndirect the raft toward the shore, preferring to take their chance\namong Kurds than with the rocks that stuck up like fangs out of the\nraging water. No, sahib, I could not see what happened to them after\nthey reached shore. That is a savage country.\n\nOne of our first volleys struck a raft so evenly and all together\nthat it blew up as if it had been torpedoed! We tried again and\nagain to repeat that performance, until Ranjoor Singh checked us for\nwasting ammunition. It was very good sport. There were rafts and\nrafts and rafts--KYAKS, I think they call them--and the amount of\nplunder those Kurds collected on the beach must have been\nastonishing.\n\nWe gave the city of Mosul a very wide berth, for that is the largest\ncity of those parts, with a very large Turkish garrison. Twenty\nmiles to the north of it we captured a good convoy of mules,\ntogether with their drivers, headed toward Mosul, and the mules'\nloads turned out to consist of good things to eat, including butter\nin large quantities. We came on them in the gathering dusk, when\ntheir escort of fifty Turkish infantry had piled arms, we being\ntotally unexpected. So we captured the fifty rifles as well as the\nmules; and, although the mule-drivers gave us the slip next day, and\nno doubt gave information about us in Mosul, that did not worry us\nmuch. We cut two telegraph wires leading toward Mosul that same\nnight; we cut out two miles of wire in sections, riding away with\nit, and burned the poles.\n\nAfter that, whenever we could catch a small party of men, Turks\nexcepted (for that would have been to give the Turks more\ninformation than we could expect to get from them), Ranjoor Singh\nwould ask questions about Wassmuss. Most of them would glance toward\nthe mountains at mention of his name, but few had much to tell about\nhim. However, bit by bit, our knowledge of his doings and his\nwhereabouts kept growing, and we rode forward, ever toward the\nmountains now, wasting no time and plundering no more than\nexpedient.\n\nWe saw no more living Armenians on all that long journey. The Turks\nand Kurds had exterminated them! We rode by burned villages, and\nthrough villages that once had been half-Armenian. The non-Armenian\nhouses would all be standing, like to burst apart with plunder, but\nevery single one that had sheltered an Armenian family would lie in\nruins. God knows why! On all our way we found no man who could tell\nus what those people had done to deserve such hatred. We asked, but\nnone could tell us.\n\nOne town, through which we rode at full gallop, had Armenian bodies\nstill lying in the streets, some of them half-burned, and there were\nKurds and Turks busy plundering the houses. Some of them came out to\nfire at us, but failed to do us any harm, and, the wind being the\nright way, we set a light to a dozen houses at the eastward end. Two\nor three miles away we stopped to watch the whole town go up in\nflames, and laughed long at the Turks' efforts to save their loot.\n\nAs we drew near enough to the mountains to see snow and to make out\nthe lie of the different ranges, we ceased to have any fear of\npursuit. There was plenty of evidence of Turkish armies not very far\naway; in fact, at Mosul there was gathering a very great army\nindeed; but they were all so busy killing and torturing and hunting\ndown Armenians that they seemed to have no time for duty on that\npart of the frontier. Perhaps that was why the Germans had sent\nWassmuss, in order that the Turks might have more leisure to destroy\ntheir enemies at home! Who knows? There are many things about this\ngreat war to which none know the answer, and I think the fate of the\nArmenians is one of them.\n\nBut who thought any more of Armenians when the outer spurs of the\nfoot-hills began to close around us? Not we, at any rate. We had\nproblems enough of our own. What lay behind us was behind, and the\nfuture was likely to afford us plenty to think about! Too many of us\nhad fought among the slopes of the Himalayas now to know how\ndifficult it would be for Turks to follow us; but those\nmountaineers, who are nearly as fierce as our mountaineers of\nnorthern India, and who have ever been too many for the Turks, were\nlikely to prove more dangerous than anything we had met yet.\n\nWe had enough food packed on our captured mules to last us for\nperhaps another eight days when we at last rode into a grim defile\nthat seemed to lead between the very gate-posts of the East--two\ngreat mountains, one on either hand, barren, and ragged, and hard.\nWe were being led at that time by a Kurdish prisoner, who had lain\nby the wayside with the bellyache. Our Greek doctor had physicked\nhim, and he was now compelled to lead us under Ranjoor Singh's\ndirections, with his hands made fast behind him, he riding on a mule\nwith one of our men on either hand. By that time Ranjoor Singh had\npicked up enough information at different times, and had added\nenough of it together to know whither we must march, and the Kurd\nhad nothing to do but obey orders.\n\nWe had scarcely ridden three hundred yards into the defile of which\nI speak, remarking the signs of another small body of mounted men\nwho had preceded us, when fifty shots rang out from overhead and we\ntook open order as if a shell had burst among us. Nobody was hit,\nhowever, and I think nobody was intended to be hit. I saw that\nRanjoor Singh looked unalarmed. He beckoned for Abraham, who looked\nterrified, and I took Abraham by the shoulder and brought him\nforward. There came a wild yell from overhead, and Ranjoor Singh\nmade Abraham answer it with something about Wassmuss. In the\nshouting that followed I caught the word Wassmuss many times.\n\nPresently a Kurdish chief came galloping down, for all the world as\none of our Indian mountaineers would ride, leaping his horse from\nrock to rock as if he and the beast were one. I rode to Ranjoor\nSingh's side, to protect him if need be, so I heard what followed,\nAbraham translating.\n\n\"Whence are ye?\" said the Kurd. \"And whither? And what will ye?\"\nThey are inquisitive people, and they always seem to wish to know\nthose three things first.\n\n\"I have told you already, I ride from Farangistan, [Footnote:\nEurope] and I seek Wassmuss. These are my men,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"No more may reach Wassmuss unless they have the money with them!\"\nsaid the Kurd, very truculently. \"Two days ago we let by the last\nparty of men who carried only talk. Now we want only money!\"\n\n\"Who was ever helped by impatience?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Kurd, \"we are a patient folk! We have waited\neighteen days for sight of this gold for Wassmuss. It should have\nbeen here fifteen days ago, so Wassmuss said, but we are willing to\nwait eighteen more. Until it comes, none else shall pass!\"\n\nI was watching Ranjoor Singh very closely indeed, and I saw that he\nsaw daylight, as it were, through darkness.\n\n\"Yet no gold shall come,\" he answered, \"until you and I shall have\ntalked together, and shall have reached an agreement.\"\n\n\"Agreement?\" said the Kurd. \"Ye have my word! Ride back and bid them\nbring their gold in safety and without fear!\"\n\n\"Without fear?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Then who are ye?\"\n\n\"We,\" said the Kurd, \"are the escort, to bring the gold in safety\nthrough the mountain passes.\"\n\n\"So that he may divide it among others?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and I\nsaw the Kurd wince. \"Gold is gold!\" he went on. \"Who art thou to let\nby an opportunity?\"\n\n\"Speak plain words,\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"Here?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Here in this defile, where men might\ncome on us from the rear at any minute?\"\n\n\"That they can not do,\" the Kurd answered, \"for my men watch from\noverhead.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"I will speak no plain words\nhere.\"\n\nThe Kurd looked long at him--at least a whole minute. Then he wiped\nhis nose on the long sleeve of his tunic and turned about. \"Come in\npeace!\" he said, spurring his horse.\n\nRanjoor Singh followed him, and we followed Ranjoor Singh, without\none word spoken or order given. The Kurd led straight up the defile\nfor a little way, then sharp to the right and uphill along a path\nthat wound among great boulders, until at last we halted, pack-mules\nand all, in a bare arena formed by a high cliff at the rear and on\nthree sides by gigantic rocks that fringed it, making a natural\nfort.\n\nThe Kurd's men were mostly looking out from between the rocks, but\nsome of them were sprawling in the shadow of a great boulder in the\nmidst, and some were attending to the horses that stood tethered in\na long line under the cliff at the rear. The chief drove away those\nwho lay in the shadow of the boulder in the midst, and bade Ranjoor\nSingh and me and Abraham be seated. Ranjoor Singh called up the\nother daffadars, and we all sat facing the Kurd, with Abraham a\nlittle to one side between him and us, to act interpreter. That was\nthe first time Ranjoor Singh had taken so many at once into his\nconfidence and I took it for a good sign, although unable to ignore\na twinge of jealousy.\n\n\"Now?\" said the Kurd. \"Speak plain words!\"\n\n\"You have not yet offered us food,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThe Kurd stared hard at him, eye to eye. \"I have good reason,\" he\nanswered. \"By our law, he who eats our bread can not be treated as\nan enemy. If I feed you, how can I let my men attack you afterward?\"\n\n\"You could not,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"We, too, have a law, that he\nwith whom we have eaten salt is not enemy but friend. Let us eat\nbread and salt together, then, for I have a plan.\"\n\n\"A plan?\" said the Kurd. \"What manner of a plan? I await gold. What\nare words?\"\n\n\"A good plan,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"And on the strength of an empty boast am I to eat bread and salt\nwith you?\" the Kurd asked.\n\n\"If you wish to hear the plan,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"To my enemy I\ntell nothing; however, let my friend but ask!\"\n\nThe Kurd thought a long time, but we facing him added no word to\nencourage or confuse him. I saw that his curiosity increased the\nmore the longer we were silent; yet I doubt whether his was greater\nthan my own! Can the sahib guess what Ranjoor Singh's plan was? Nay,\nthat Kurd was no great fool. He was in the dark. He saw swiftly\nenough when explanations came.\n\n\"I have three hundred mounted men!\" the Kurd said at last.\n\n\"And I near as many!\" answered Ranjoor Singh. \"I crave no favors! I\ncome with an offer, as one leader to another!\"\n\nThe Kurd frowned and hesitated, but sent at last for bread and salt,\nfor all our party, except that he ordered his men to give none to\nour prisoners and none to the Syrians, whom he mistook for Turkish\nsoldiers. If Ranjoor Singh had told him they were Syrians he would\nhave refused the more, for Kurds regard Syrians as wolves regard\nsheep.\n\n\"Let the prisoners be,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"but feed those others!\nThey must help put through the plan!\"\n\nSo the Kurd ordered our Syrians, whom he thought Turks, fed too, and\nwe dipped the flat bread (something like our Indian chapatties) into\nsalt and ate, facing one another.\n\n\"Now speak, and we listen,\" said the Kurd when we had finished. Some\nof his men had come back, clustering around him, and we were quite a\nparty, filling all the shadow of the great rock.\n\n\"How much of that gold was to have been yours?\" asked Ranjoor Singh,\nand the Kurd's eyes blazed. \"Wassmuss promised me so-and-so much,\"\nhe answered, \"if I with three hundred men wait here for the convoy\nand escort it to where he waits.\"\n\n\"But why do ye serve Wassmuss?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Because he buys friendship, as other men buy ghee, or a horse, or\nammunition,\" said the Kurd. \"He spends gold like water, saying it is\nGerman gold, and in return for it we must harry the British and\nRussians.\"\n\n\"Yet you and I are friends by bread and salt,\" said Ranjoor Singh,\n\"and I offer you all this gold, whereas he offers only part of it!\nNay, I and my men need none of it--I offer it all!\"\n\n\"At what price?\" asked the Kurd, suspiciously. Doubtless men who\nneed no gold were as rare among these mountains as in other places!\n\n\"I shall name a price,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"A low price. We shall\nboth be content with our bargain, and possibly Wassmuss, too, may\nfeel satisfied for a while.\"\n\n\"Nay, you must be a wizard!\" said the Kurd. \"Speak on!\"\n\n\"Tell me first,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"about the party who went\nthrough this defile two days ahead of us.\"\n\n\"What do you know of them?\" asked the Kurd.\n\n\"This,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"We have followed them from Mosul,\nlearning here a little and there a little. What is it that they have\nwith them? Who are they? Why were they let pass?\"\n\n\"They were let pass because Wassmuss gave the order,\" the Kurd\nanswered. \"They are Germans--six German officers, six German\nservants--and Kurds--twenty-four Kurds of the plains acting porters\nand camp-servants--many mules--two mules bearing a box slung on\npoles between them.\"\n\n\"What was in the box?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay, I know not,\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"my brother is a man with eyes\nand ears. What did my brother hear?\"\n\n\"They said their machine can send and receive a message from places\nas far apart as Khabul and Stamboul. Doubtless they lied,\" the Kurd\nanswered.\n\n\"Doubtless!\" said Ranjoor Singh. By his slow even breathing and\napparent indifference, I knew he was on a hot scent, so I tried to\nappear indifferent myself, although my ears burned. The Kurds\nclustering around their leader listened with ears and eyes agape.\nThey made no secret of their interest.\n\n\"They said they are on their way to Khabul,\" the Kurd continued,\n\"there to receive messages from Europe and acquaint the amir and his\nruling chiefs of the true condition of affairs.\"\n\n\"How shall they reach Afghanistan?\" asked Ranjoor Singh. \"Does a\nroad through Persia lie open to them?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Kurd. \"Persia is like a nest of hornets. But they\nare to receive an escort of us Kurds to take them through Persia. We\nmountain Kurds are not afraid of Persians.\"\n\n\"Which Kurds are to provide the escort?\" Ranjoor Singh asked him,\nand the Kurd shook his head.\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"that none can tell. It is not yet agreed. There is\nsmall competition for the task. There are better pickings here on\nthe border, raiding now and then, and pocketing the gold of this\nWassmuss between-whiles! Who wants the task of escorting a machine\nin a box to Khabul?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"I know of a leader and his men\nwho will undertake the task.\"\n\n\"Who, then?\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"I and my men!\" said Ranjoor Singh; and I held my breath until I\nthought my lungs would burst. \"Persia!\" thought I. \"Afghanistan!\"\nthought I. \"And what beyond?\"\n\n\"Ye are not Kurds,\" the chief answered, after he had considered a\nwhile. \"Wassmuss said the escort must consist of three hundred Kurds\nor he will not pay.\"\n\n\"The payment shall be arranged between me and thee!\" said Ranjoor\nSingh. \"You shall have all the gold of this next convoy, if you will\nride back to Wassmuss and agree that you and your men shall be the\nescort to Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Who shall guard this pass if I ride back?\" the Kurd asked.\n\n\"I!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"I and my men will wait here for the gold.\nLeave me a few of your men to be guides and to keep peace between us\nand other Kurds among these mountains. Ride and tell Wassmuss that\nthe gold will not come for another thirty days.\"\n\n\"He will not believe,\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"I will give you a letter,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"He will not believe the letter,\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"What is that to thee, whether he believes it or not?\" said Ranjoor\nSingh. \"At least he will believe that Turks brought you the letter,\nand that you took it to him in good faith. Will he charge you with\nhaving written it?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Kurd, nodding, \"I can not write, and he knows it.\"\n\n\"Do that, then,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Ride and agree to be escort\nfor these Germans and their machine to Afghanistan. Leave me here\nwith ten or a dozen of your men, who will guide me after I have the\ngold to where you shall be camping with your Germans somewhere just\nbeyond the Persian border. I will arrange to overtake you after\ndusk--perhaps at midnight. There I will give you the gold, and you\nshall ride away. I and my men will ride on as escort to the\nGermans.\"\n\n\"What if they object?\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"Who? The men with the box, or Wassmuss?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Kurd, \"Wassmuss will be very glad to get a willing\nescort. He is in difficulty over that. There will be no objection\nfrom him. But what if the men with the box object to the change of\nescorts?\"\n\n\"We be over two hundred, and they thirty!\" answered Ranjoor Singh,\nand the Kurd nodded.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, \"that is thy affair. But how am I to know that\nyou and your men will not ride off with the gold? Nay, I must have\nthe gold first!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh shook his head.\n\n\"Then I and my men will stay here and help seize the gold,\" the Kurd\nsaid meaningly.\n\n\"Nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"For then you would fight me for it!\"\n\n\"Thou and I have eaten bread and salt together!\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"True,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"therefore trust me, for I am a Sikh\nfrom India.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of Sikhs, or of India,\" said the Kurd. \"Gold I know\nin the dark, by its jingle and weight, but who knows the heart of a\nman?\"\n\n\"Then listen,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"If you and your men seize the\ngold, you must bear the blame. When the Turks come later on for\nvengeance, you will hang. But if I stay and take the gold, who shall\nknow who I am? You will be able to prove with the aid of Wassmuss\nthat neither you nor your men were anywhere near when, the attack\ntook place.\"\n\n\"Then you will make an ambush?\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"I will set a trap,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Moreover, consider this:\nYou think I may take the gold and keep it. How could I? Having taken\nit from the Turks, should I ride back toward Turkey? Whither else,\nthen? Shall I escape through Persia, with you and your Kurds to\nprevent? Nay, we must make a fair bargain as friend with friend--and\nkeep it!\"\n\n\"If I do as you say,\" said the Kurd, \"if I take this letter to\nWassmuss, and agree with him to escort those Germans across Persia,\nwhat, then, if you fail to get the gold? What if the Turks get the\nbetter of you?\"\n\n\"Dead men can not keep bargains!\" answered Ranjoor Singh. \"I shall\nsucceed or die. But consider again: I have led these men of mine\nhither from Stamboul, deceiving and routing and outdistancing\nTurkish regiments all the way. Shall I fail now, having come so\nfar?\"\n\n\"Insha' Allah!\" said the Kurd, meaning, \"If God wills.\"\n\n\"Since when did God take sides against the brave?\" Ranjoor Singh\nasked him, and the Kurd said nothing; but I feared greatly because\nthey seemed on the verge of a religious argument, and those Kurds\nare fanatics. If anything but gold had been in the balance against\nhim, I believe that Kurd would have defied us, for, although he did\nnot know what Sikhs might be, he knew us for no Musselmen. I saw his\neyes look inward, meditating treachery, not only to Wassmuss, but to\nus, too. But Ranjoor Singh detected that quicker than I did.\n\n\"Let us neglect no points,\" he said, and the Kurd brought his mind\nback with an effort from considering plans against us. \"It would be\npossible for me to get that gold, and for other Kurds--not you or\nyour men, of course, but other Kurds--to waylay me in the mountains.\nTherefore let part of the agreement be that you leave with me ten\nhostages, of whom two shall be your blood relations.\"\n\nThe Kurd winced. He was a little keen man, with, a thin face and\nprominent nose; not ill-looking, but extremely acquisitive, I should\nsay.\n\n\"Wassmuss holds my brother hostage!\" he answered grimly, as if he\nhad just then thought of it.\n\n\"I have a German prisoner here,\" said Ranjoor Singh, with the\nnearest approach to a smile that he had permitted himself yet, \"and\nWassmuss will be very glad to exchange him against your brother when\nthe time comes.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Kurd, and--\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ranjoor Singh. He saw now which way the wind blew, and,\nlike all born cavalry leaders, he pressed his advantage.\n\n\"Do the Turks hold any of your men prisoner?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aye!\" said the Kurd. \"They hold an uncle of mine, and my\nhalf-brother, and seven of my best men. They keep them in jail in\nfetters.\"\n\n\"I have five Turkish prisoners, all officers, one a bimbashi, whom I\nwill give you when I hand over the gold. The Turks will gladly trade\nyour men against their officers,\" Ranjoor Singh assured him. \"You\nshall have them and the German to make your trade with.\"\n\nIt was plain the Kurd was more than half-convinced. His men who\nswarmed around him were urging him in whispers. Doubtless they knew\nhe would keep most, if not all, of the gold for himself, but the\nsafety of their friends made more direct appeal and I don't think he\nwould have dared neglect that opportunity for fear of losing their\nallegiance. Nevertheless, he bargained to the end.\n\n\"Give me, then, ten hostages against my ten, and we are agreed!\" he\nurged.\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"It is my task to fight for that\ngold. Shall I weaken my force by ten men? Nay, we are already few\nenough! I will give you one--to be exchanged against your ten at the\ntime of giving up the gold in Persia.\"\n\n\"Ten!\" said the Kurd. \"Ten against ten!\"\n\n\"One!\" said Ranjoor Singh, and I thought they would quarrel and the\nwhole plan would come to nothing. But the Kurd gave in.\n\n\"Then one officer!\" said the Kurd, and I trembled, for I saw that\nRanjoor Singh intended to agree to that, and I feared he might pick\nme. But no. If I had thought a minute I would not have feared, yet\nwho thinks at such times? The men who think first of their charge\nand last of their own skin are such as Ranjoor Singh; a year after\nwar begins they are still leading. The rest of us must either be\ncontent to be led, or else are superseded. I burst into a sweat all\nover, for all that a cold wind swept among the rocks. Yet I might\nhave known I was not to be spared.\n\nAfter two seconds, that seemed two hours, he said to the Kurd, \"Very\nwell. We are agreed. I will give you one of my officers against ten\nof your men. I will give you Gooja Singh!\" said he.\n\nSahib, I could have rolled among the rocks and laughed. The look of\nrage mingled with amazement on Gooja Singh's fat face was payment\nenough for all the insults I had received from him. I could not\nconceal all my merriment. Doubtless my eyes betrayed me. I doubt not\nthey blazed. Gooja Singh was sitting on the other side of Ranjoor\nSingh, partly facing me, so that he missed nothing of what passed\nover my face--as I scarcely intended that he should. And in a moment\nmy mirth was checked by sight of his awful wrath. His face had\nturned many shades darker.\n\n\"I am to be hostage?\" he said in a voice like grinding stone.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Be a proud one! They have had to give\nten men to weigh against you in the scale!\"\n\n\"And I am to go away with them all by myself into the mountains?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Why not? We hold ten of theirs against\nyour safe return.\"\n\n\"Good! Then I will go!\" he answered, and I knew by the black look on\nhis face and by the dull rage in his voice that he would harm us if\nhe could. But there was no time just then to try to dissuade Ranjoor\nSingh from his purpose, even had I dared. There began to be great\nargument about the ten hostages the Kurd should give, Ranjoor Singh\nexamining each one with the aid of Abraham, rejecting one man after\nanother as not sufficiently important, and it was two hours before\nten Kurds that satisfied him stood unarmed in our midst. Then he\ngave up Gooja Singh in exchange for them; and Gooja Singh walked\naway among the Kurds without so much as a backward look, or a word\nof good-by, or a salute.\n\n\"He should be punished for not saluting you,\" said I, going to\nRanjoor Singh's side. \"It is a bad example to the troopers.\"\n\n\"KUCH--KUCH--,\" said he. \"No trouble. Black hearts beget black\ndeeds. White hearts, good deeds. Maybe we all misjudged him. Let him\nprove whether he is true at heart or not.\"\n\nObserve, sahib, how he identified himself with us, although he knew\nwell that all except I until recently had denied him title to any\nother name than traitor. \"Maybe we all misjudged,\" said he, as much\nas to say, \"What my men have done, I did.\" So you may tell the\ndifference between a great man and a mean one.\n\n\"Better have hanged him long ago!\" said I. \"He will be the ruin of\nus yet!\" But he laughed.\n\n\"Sahib,\" I said. \"Suppose he should get to see this Wassmuss?\"\n\n\"I have thought of that,\" he answered. \"Why should the Kurds let him\ngo near Wassmuss? Unless they return him safely to us we can execute\ntheir hostages; they will run no risk of Wassmuss playing tricks with\nGooja Singh. Besides, from what I can learn and guess from what the\nKurds say, this Wassmuss is to all intents and purposes a prisoner.\nAnother tribe of Kurds, pretending, to protect him, keep him very\nclosely guarded. The best he can do is to play off one tribe against\nanother. Our friend said Wassmuss holds his brother for hostage, but\nI think the fact is the other tribe holds him and Wassmuss gets the\nblame. I suspect they held our friend's brother as security for the\ngold he is to meet and escort back. There is much politics working\nin these mountains.\"\n\n\"Much politics and little hope for us!\" said I, and at that he\nturned on me as he never had done yet. No, sahib, I never saw him\nturn on any man, nor speak as savagely as he did to me then. It was\nas if the floodgates of his weariness were down at last and I got a\nglimpse of what he suffered--he who dared trust no one all these\nmonths and miles.\n\n\"Did I not say months ago,\" he mocked, \"that if I told you half my\nplan you would quail? And that if I told the whole, you would pick\nit to pieces like hens round a scrap of meat? Man without thought!\nCan I not see the dangers? Have I no eyes--no ears? Do I need a frog\nto croak to me of risks whichever way I turn? Do I need men to hang\nback, or men to lend me courage?\"\n\n\"Who hangs back?\" said I. \"Nay, forward! I will die beside you,\nsahib!\"\n\n\"I seek life for you all, not death,\" he answered, but he spoke so\nsadly that I think in that minute his hope and faith were at lowest\nebb.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I answered, \"if need be, I will die beside you. I\nwill not hang back. Order, and I obey!\" But he looked at me as if he\ndoubted.\n\n\"Boasting,\" he said, \"is the noise fools make to conceal from\nthemselves their failings!\"\n\nWhat could I answer to that? I sat down and considered the rebuff,\nwhile he went and made great preparation for an execution and a\nTurkish funeral. So that there was little extra argument required to\ninduce one of our Turkish officer prisoners--the bimbashi himself,\nin fact--to write the letter to Wassmuss that Ranjoor Singh\nrequired. And that he gave to the Kurdish chief, and the Kurd rode\naway with his men, not looking once back at the hostages he had left\nwith us, but making a great show of guarding Gooja Singh, who rode\nunarmed in the center of a group of horsemen. That instant I began\nto feel sorry for Gooja Singh, and later, when we advanced through\nthose blood-curdling mountains I was sorrier yet to think of him\nborne away alone amid savages whose tongue he could not speak. The\nmen all felt sorry for him too, but Ranjoor Singh gave them little\ntime for talk about it, setting them at once to various tasks, not\nleast of which was cleaning rifles for inspection.\n\nI took Abraham to interpret for me and went to talk with our ten\nhostages, who were herded together apart from the other ten armed\nKurds. They seemed to regard themselves as in worse plight than\nprisoners and awaited with resignation whatever might be their\nkismet. So I asked them were they afraid lest Gooja Singh might meet\nwith violence, and they replied they were afraid of nothing. They\nadded, however, that no man could say in those mountains what this\nday or the next might bring forth.\n\nThen I asked them about Wassmuss, and they rather confirmed Ranjoor\nSingh's guess about his being practically a prisoner. They said he\nwas ever on the move, surrounded and very closely watched by the\nparticular tribe of Kurds that had possession of him for the moment.\n\n\"First it is one tribe, then another,\" they told me. \"If you keep\nyour bargain with our chief and he gets this gold, we shall have\nWassmuss, too, within a week, for we shall buy the allegiance of one\nor two more tribes to join with us and oust those Kurds who hold him\nnow. Hitherto the bulk of his gold has been going into Persia to\nbribe the Bakhtiari Khans and such like, but that day is gone by.\nNow we Kurds will grow rich. But as for us\"--they shrugged their\nshoulders like this, sahib, meaning to say that perhaps their day\nhad gone by also. I left them with the impression they are very\nfatalistic folk.\n\nThere was no means of knowing how long we might have to wait there,\nso Ranjoor Singh gave orders for the best shelter possible to be\nprepared, and what with the cave at the rear, and plundered\nblankets, and one thing and another we contrived a camp that was\nalmost comfortable. What troubled us most was shortage of fire-wood,\nand we had to send out foraging parties in every direction at no\nsmall risk. The Kurds, like our mountain men of northern India,\nleave such matters to their women-folk, and there was more than one\nvoice raised in anger at Ranjoor Singh because he had not allowed us\nto capture women as well as food and horses. Our Turkish prisoners\nlaughed at us for not having stolen women, and Tugendheim vowed he\nhad never seen such fools.\n\nBut as it turned out, we had not long to wait. That very evening, as\nI watched from between two great boulders, I beheld a Turkish convoy\nof about six hundred infantry, led by a bimbashi on a gray horse,\nwith a string of pack-mules trailing out behind them, and five\nloaded donkeys led by soldiers in the midst. They were heading\ntoward the hills, and I sent a man running to bring Ranjoor Singh to\nwatch them.\n\nIt soon became evident that they meant to camp on the plains for\nthat night. They had tents with them, and they pitched a camp\nthree-quarters of a mile, or perhaps a mile away from the mouth of our\ndefile, at a place where a little stream ran between rocks. It was\nclear they suspected no treachery, or they would never have chosen\nthat place, they being but six hundred and the hills full of Kurds\nso close at hand. Nevertheless, they were very careful to set\nsentries on all the rocks all about, and they gave us no ground for\nthinking we might take them by surprise. Seeing they outnumbered us,\nand we had to spare a guard for our prisoners and hostages, and that\nfifty of our force were Syrians and therefore not much use, I felt\ndoubtful. I thought Ranjoor Singh felt doubtful, too, until I saw\nhim glance repeatedly behind and study the sky. Then I began to hope\nas furiously as he.\n\nThe Turks down on the plain were studying the sky, too. We could see\nthem fix bayonets and make little trenches about the tents. Another\nparty of them gathered stones with which to re-enforce the tent\npegs, and in every other way possible they made ready against one of\nthose swift, sudden storms that so often burst down the sides of\nmountains. Most of us had experienced such storms a dozen times or\nmore in the foot-hills of our Himalayas, and all of us knew the\nsigns. As evening fell the sky to our rear grew blacker than night\nitself and a chill swept down the defile like the finger of death.\n\n\"Repack the camp,\" commanded Ranjoor Singh. \"Stow everything in the\ncave.\"\n\nThere was grumbling, for we had all looked forward to a warm night's\nrest.\n\n\"To-night your hearts must warm you!\" he said, striding to and fro\nto make sure his orders were obeyed. It was dark by the time we had\nfinished, Then he made us fall in, in our ragged overcoats--aye,\nragged, for those German overcoats had served as coats and tents and\nwhat-not, and were not made to stand the wear of British ones in any\ncase--unmounted he made us fall in, at which there was grumbling\nagain.\n\n\"Ye shall prove to-night,\" he said, \"whether ye can endure what\nmules and horses never could! Warmth ye shall have, if your hearts\nare true, but the man who can keep dry shall be branded for a\nwizard! Imagine yourselves back in Flanders!\"\n\nMost of us shuddered. I know I did. The wind had begun whimpering,\nand every now and then would whistle and rise into a scream. A few\ndrops of heavy rain fell. Then would come a lull, while we could\nfeel the air grow colder. Our Flanders experience was likely to\nstand us in good stead.\n\nTugendheim and the Syrians were left in charge of our belongings.\nThere was nothing else to do with them because the Syrians were in\nmore deathly fear of the storm than they ever had been of Turks.\nNevertheless, we did not find them despicable. Unmilitary people\nthough they were, they had inarched and endured and labored like\ngood men, but certain things they seemed to accept as being more\nthan men could overcome, and this sort of storm apparently was one\nof them. We tied the mules and horses very carefully, because we did\nnot believe the Syrians would stand by when the storm began, and we\nwere right. Tugendheim begged hard to be allowed to come with us,\nbut Ranjoor Singh would not let him. I don't know why, but I think\nhe suspected Tugendheim of knowing something about the German\nofficers who were ahead of us, in which case Tugendheim was likely\nto risk anything rather than continue going forward; and, having\npromised him to the Kurdish chief, it would not have suited Ranjoor\nSingh to let him escape into Turkey again.\n\nThe ten Kurds who had been left with us as guides and to help us\nkeep peace among the mountains all volunteered to lend a hand in the\nfight, and Ranjoor Singh accepted gladly. The hostages, on the other\nhand, were a difficult problem; for they detested being hostages.\nThey would have made fine allies for Tugendheim, supposing he had\nmeditated any action in our rear. They could have guided him among\nthe mountains with all our horses and mules and supplies. And\nsuppose he had made up his mind to start through the storm to find\nWassmuss with their aid, what could have prevented him? He might\nbetray us to Wassmuss as the price of his own forgiveness. So we\ntook the hostages with us, and when we found a place between some\nrocks where they could have shelter we drove them in there, setting\nfour troopers to guard them. Thus Tugendheim was kept in ignorance\nof their whereabouts, and with no guides to help him play us false.\nAs for the Greek doctor, we took him with us, too, for we were\nlikely to need his services that night, and in truth we did.\n\nWe started the instant the storm began--twenty minutes or more\nbefore it settled down to rage in earnest. That enabled us to march\nabout two-thirds of the way toward the Turkish camp and to deploy\ninto proper formation before the hail came and made it impossible to\nhear even a shout. Hitherto the rain had screened us splendidly,\nalthough it drenched us to the skin, and the noise of rain and wind\nprevented the noise we made from giving the alarm; but when the hail\nbegan I could not hear my own foot-fall. Ranjoor Singh roared out\nthe order to double forward, but could make none hear, so he seized\na rifle from the nearest man and fired it off. Perhaps a dozen men\nheard that and began to double. The remainder saw, and followed\nsuit.\n\nThe hail was in our backs. No man ever lived who could have charged\nforward into it, and not one of the Turkish sentries made pretense\nat anything but running for his life. Long before we reached their\nposts they were gone, and a flash of lightning showed the tents\nblown tighter than drums in the gaining wind and white with the\nhailstones. When we reached the tents there was hail already half a\nfoot deep underfoot where the wind had blown it into drifts, and the\nnext flash of lightning showed one tent--the bimbashi's own--split\nopen and blown fluttering into strips. The bimbashi rushed out with\na blanket round his head and shoulders and tried to kick men out of\nanother tent to make room for him, and failing to do that he\nscrambled in on top of them. Opening the tent let the wind in, and\nthat tent, too, split and fluttered and blew away. And so at last\nthey saw us coming.\n\nThey saw us when we were so close that there was no time to do much\nelse than run away or surrender. Quite a lot of them ran away I\nimagine, for they disappeared. The bimbashi tried to pistol Ranjoor\nSingh, and died for his trouble on a trooper's bayonet. Some of the\nTurks tried to fight, and they were killed. Those who surrendered\nwere disarmed and driven away into the storm, and the last we saw of\nthem was when a flash of lightning showed them hurrying\nhelter-skelter through the hail with hands behind their defenseless heads\ntrying to ward off hailstones. They looked very ridiculous, and I\nremember I laughed.\n\nI? My share of it? A Turkish soldier tried to drive a bayonet\nthrough me. I think he was the last one left in camp (the whole\nbusiness can only have lasted three or four minutes, once we were\namong them). I shot him with the repeating pistol that had once been\nTugendheim's--this one, see, sahib--and believing the camp was now\nours and the fighting over, I lay down and dragged his body over me\nto save me from hailstones, that had made me ache already in every\ninch of my body. I rolled under and pulled the body over in one\nmovement; and seeing the body and thinking a Turk was crawling up to\nattack him, one of our troopers thrust his bayonet clean through it.\nIt was a goodly thrust, delivered by a man who prided himself on\nbeing workmanlike. If the Turk had not been a fat one I should not\nbe here. Luckily, I had chosen one whose weight made me grunt, and\nbecause of his thickness the bayonet only pierced an inch or two of\nmy thigh.\n\nI yelled and kicked the body off me. The trooper made as if to use\nthe steel again, thinking we were two Turks, and my pointing a\npistol at him only served to confirm the belief. But next minute the\nlightning showed the true facts, and he came and sat beside me with\nhis back to the hail, grinning like an ape.\n\n\"That was a good thrust of mine!\" he bellowed in my ear. \"But for me\nthat Turk would have had your life!\"\n\nWhen I had cursed his mother's ancestors for a dozen generations in\nsome detail the truth dawned on him at last. I took his weapon away\nfrom him while he bound a strip of cloth about my thigh, for I knew\nthe thought had come into his thick skull to finish me off and so\nsave explanation afterward. I would gladly have let him go with\nnothing further said, for I knew the man's first intention had been\nhonest enough, but did not dare do that because he would certainly\nsuppose me to be meditating vengeance. So I flew into a great rage\nwith him, and drove him in front of me until we found a dead\nmule--whether killed by hail or bullet I don't know--and he and I lay\nbetween the mule's legs, snuggling under its belly, until the storm\nshould cease and I could take him before Ranjoor Singh.\n\nI did not know where the gold was, nor where anything or anybody\nwas. I could see about three yards, except when the lightning\nflashed; and then I could see only stricken plain, with dead animals\nlying about, and fallen tents lumpy with the men who huddled\nunderneath, and here and there a live animal with his rump to the\nhail and head between his forelegs.\n\nWhen the storm ceased, suddenly, as all such mountain hail-storms\ndo, I ordered my trooper in front of me and went limping through the\ndarkness shouting for Ranjoor Singh, and I found him at last,\nsitting on the rump of a dead donkey with the ten boxes of gold coin\nbeside him--quite little boxes, yet only two to a donkey load.\n\n\"I have the gold,\" he said. \"What have you?\"\n\n\"A stab,\" said I, \"and the fool who gave it me!\" And I showed my\nleg, with the blood trickling down. \"I had killed a Turk,\" said I,\n\"and this muddlehead with no discernment had the impudence to try to\nfinish the job. Behold the result!\"\n\nHe was one great bruise from head to foot from hailstones, yet with\nall he had to think about and all his aches, he had understanding\nenough to spare for my little problem. He saw at once that he must\npunish the man in order to convince him his account with me was\nsettled.\n\n\"Be driver of asses,\" he ordered, \"until we reach Persia! There were\nfive asses. One is dead. It is good we have another to replace the\nfifth!\"\n\nThere goes the trooper, sahib--he yonder with the limp. He and I are\nas good friends to-day as daffadar and trooper can be, but he would\nhave slain me to save himself from vengeance unless Ranjoor Singh\nhad punished him that night. But my tale is not of that trooper, nor\nof myself. I tell of Ranjoor Singh. Consider him, sahib, seated on\nthe dead ass beside ten chests of captured gold, with scarcely a man\nof us fit to help him or obey an order, and himself bleeding in\nfifty places where the hail had pierced his skin. We were drenched\nand numbed, with the spirit beaten out of us; yet I tell you he\nwiped the blood from his nose and beard and made us save ourselves!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nOnce in a lifetime. Once is enough!--HIRA SINGH.\n\n\nWell, sahib, our journey was not nearly at an end, but my tale is; I\ncan finish it by sundown. After that fight there was no more doubt\nof us; we were one again--one in our faith in our leader, and with\nmen so minded such a man as Ranjoor Singh can make miracles seem\nlike details of a day's work.\n\nTurks who had been bayoneted and Turks slain by hailstones lay all\nabout us, and we should have been dead, too, only that the hail was\nin our backs. As it was, ten of our men lay killed and more than\nthirty stunned, some of whom did not recover. Our little Greek\ndoctor announced himself too badly injured to help any one, but when\nRanjoor Singh began to choose a firing party for him, he changed his\nmind.\n\nThe four living donkeys were too bruised by the hail to bear a load,\nbut the Turks had had some mules with them and we loaded our dead\nand wounded on those, gathered up the plunder, told off four\ntroopers to each chest of gold, and dragged ourselves away. It was\nessential that we get back to the hills before dawn should disclose\nour predicament, for whatever Kurds should chance to spy us would\nnever have been restrained by promises or by ritual of friendship\nfrom taking prompt advantage. A savage is a savage.\n\nThe moon came out from behind clouds, and we cursed it, for we did\nnot want to be seen. It shone on a world made white with hail--on a\nstricken camp--dead animals--dead men. We who had swept down from\nthe hills like the very spirit of the storm itself returned like a\nfuneral cortege, all groaning, chilled to the bone by the searching\nwind, and it was beginning to be dawn when the last man dragged\nhimself between the boulders into our camping ground. We looked so\nlittle like victors that the Syrians sent up a wail and Tugendheim\nbegan tugging at his mustaches, but Ranjoor Singh set them at once\nto feeding and grooming animals and soon disillusioned them as to\nthe outcome of the night.\n\nNow we began to pray for time, to recover from the effects of hail\nand chill. Some of the men began to develop fevers, and if Ranjoor\nSingh had not fiercely threatened the doctor, things might have gone\nfrom bad to worse. As it was, three men died of something the matter\nwith their lungs, and five men died of wounds. Yet, on the other\nhand, we did not desire too much time, because (surest of all\ncertainties) the Turks were going to send regiments in a hurry to\nwreak vengeance. Before noon, somebody rallied the remnants of the\nconvoy we had beaten and brought them back to bury dead and look for\nproperty, and they looked quite a formidable body as I watched them\nfrom between the boulders. They soon went away again, having found\nnothing but tents torn to rags; but I counted more than four\nhundred, which rather lessened my conceit. It had been the storm\nthat night that did the work, not we.\n\nWe could not burn our dead, for lack of sufficient wood, although we\ndrove the Syrians out of camp to gather more; so we buried them in a\ntrench, and covered them, and laid little fires at intervals along\nthe new-stamped earth and set light to those. We did not bury them\nvery deep, because a bayonet is a fool of a weapon with which to\nexcavate a grave and a Syrian no expert digger in any case; so when\nthe fires were burned out we piled rocks on the grave to defeat\njackals.\n\nThe Kurdish chief returned on the fifth day and by that time,\nalthough most of us still ached, some of us looked like men again,\nand what with the plunder we had taken, and the chests of gold in\nfull view, he was well impressed. He began by demanding the gold at\nonce, and Ranjoor Singh surprised me by the calm courtesy with which\nhe refused.\n\n\"Why should my brother seek to alter the terms of our bargain?\" he\nasked.\n\nFor a long time the Kurd made no answer, but sat thinking for some\nexcuse that might deceive us. Then suddenly he abandoned hope of\nargument and flew into a rage, spitting savagely and pouring out\nsuch a flood of words that Abraham could hardly translate fast\nenough.\n\n\"That pig you gave me for a hostage played a trick!\" he shouted. \"He\nand a man of mine knew Persian. They talked together. Then in the\nnight they ran away, and your hostage went to Wassmuss, and has told\nhim all the truth and more untruth into the bargain than ten other\nmen could invent in a year! So Wassmuss threw in my teeth that\nletter you gave me, and I was laughed out of countenance by a\nheritage of spawn of Tophet! And what has Wasmuss done but persuade\nthree hundred Kurds of a tribe who are my enemies to accept this\nduty of escort at a great price! And so your Germans are gone into\nPersia already! Now give me the gold and my hostages back, and I\nwill leave you to your own devices!\"\n\nIt was an hour before Ranjoor Singh could calm him, and another hour\nagain before cross-examination induced him to tell all the truth;\nand the truth was not reassuring. Wassmuss, he said, probably did\nnot know yet that we had taken the gold, but the news was on the\nway, for spies had talked in the night with the ten Kurds whom he\nleft with us to be guides and to help us keep peace. We had given\nthose ten a Turkish rifle each and various other plunder, because\nthey helped us in the fight, and they had promised in return to hold\ntheir tongues. But a savage is a savage, and there is no\ncontroverting it.\n\n\"What is Wassmuss likely to do?\" Ranjoor Singh asked.\n\n\"Do?\" said the Kurd. \"He has done! He has set two tribes by the ears\nand sent them down to surround you and hem you in and starve you to\nsurrender! So give me the gold, that I may get away with it before a\nthousand men come to prevent, and give me back my hostages!\"\n\nIf what was happening now had taken place but a week before, Ranjoor\nSingh would have found himself in a fine fix, for all except I would\nhave there and then denounced him for a bungler, or a knave. But now\nthe other daffadars who clustered around him and me said one to the\nother, \"Let us see what our sahib makes of it!\" The men sent word to\nknow what was being revealed through two long hours of talk, and\nChatar Singh went back to bid them have patience.\n\n\"Is there trouble?\" they asked, and he answered \"Aye!\"\n\n\"Tell our sahib we stand behind him!\" they answered, and Chatar\nSingh brought that message and I think it did Ranjoor Singh's heart\ngood,--not that he would not have done his best in any case.\n\n\"You have lost my hostage, and I hold yours,\" he told the Kurd, \"so\nnow, if you want yours back you must pay whatever price I name for\nthem!\"\n\n\"Who am I to pay a price?\" the Kurd demanded. \"I have neither gold\nnor goods, nor anything but three hundred men!\"\n\n\"Where are thy men?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Within an hour's ride,\" said the Kurd, \"watching for the men who\ncome from Wassmuss.\"\n\n\"You shall have back your hostages,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"when I and\nmy men set foot in Persia!\"\n\n\"How shall you reach Persia?\" laughed the Kurd. \"A thousand men ride\nnow to shut you off! Nay, give me the gold and my men, and ride back\nwhence you came!\"\n\nThen it was Ranjoor Singh's turn to laugh. \"Sikhs who are facing\nhomeward turn back for nothing less than duty!\" he answered. \"I\nshall fight the thousand men that Wassmuss sends. If they conquer me\nthey will take the gold and your hostages as well.\"\n\nThe Kurd looked amazed. Then he looked thoughtful. Then acquisitive--very\nacquisitive indeed. It seemed to me that he contemplated\nfighting us first, before the Wassmuss men could come. But Ranjoor\nSingh understood him better. That Kurd was no fool--only a savage,\nwith a great hunger in him to become powerful.\n\n\"My men are seasoned warriors,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and being men\nof our word first and last, we are good allies. Has my brother a\nsuggestion?\"\n\n\"What if I help you into Persia?\" said the Kurd.\n\nBut Ranjoor Singh was wary. \"Help me in what way?\" he asked, and the\nKurd saw it was no use to try trickery.\n\n\"What if I and my men fight beside you and yours, and so you win\nthrough to Persia?\" asked the Kurd.\n\n\"As I said,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"you shall have back your hostages\non the day we set foot in Persia.\"\n\n\"But the gold!\" said the Kurd. \"But the gold!\"\n\n\"Half of the gold you shall have on the third day after we reach\nPersia,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nWell, sahib, as to that they higgled and bargained for another hour,\nRanjoor Singh yielding little by little until at last the bargain\nstood that the Kurd should have all the gold except one chest on the\nseventh day after we reached Persia. Thus, the Kurds would be\nobliged to give us escort well on our way. But the bargaining was\nnot over yet. It was finally agreed that after we reached Persia,\nprovided the Kurds helped us bravely and with good faith, on the\nfirst day we would give them back their hostages; on the third day\nwe would give them Tugendheim, to trade with Wassmuss against the\nKurd's brother (thus keeping Ranjoor Singh's promise to Tugendheim\nto provide for him in the end); on the fifth day we would give them\nour Turkish officer prisoners, to trade with the Turks against\nKurdish prisoners; and on the seventh day we would give them the\ngold and leave to go. We ate more bread and salt on that, and then I\nwent to tell the men.\n\nBut I scarcely had time to tell them. Ranjoor Singh had out his map\nwhen I left him, and he and the Kurd were poring over it, he tracing\nwith a finger and asking swift questions, and the Kurd with the aid\nof Abraham trying to understand. Yet I had hardly told the half of\nwhat I meant to say when Ranjoor Singh strode past me, and the Kurd\nwent galloping away between the boulders to warn his own men,\nleaving us not only the hostages but the ten guides also.\n\n\"Make ready to march at once--immediately--ek dum!\" Ranjoor Singh\ngrowled to me as he passed, and from that minute until we were away\nand well among the hills I was kept too busy with details to do much\nconjecturing. A body of soldiers with transport and prisoners,\nwounded and sick, need nearly as much herding as a flock of sheep,\neven after months of campaigning when each man's place and duty\nshould be second nature. Yet oh, it was different now. There was no\nneed now to listen for whisperings of treason! Now we knew who the\ntraitor had been all along--not Ranjoor Singh, who had done his best\nfrom first to last, but Gooja Singh, who had let no opportunity go\nby for defaming him and making trouble!\n\n\"This for Gooja Singh when I set eyes on him!\" said not one trooper\nbut every living man, licking a cartridge and slipping it into the\nbreech chamber as we started.\n\nWe did not take the track up which the Kurdish chief had galloped,\nbut the ten guides led us by a dreadful route round almost the half\nof a circle, ever mounting upward. When night fell we camped without\nfires in a hollow among crags, and about midnight when the moon rose\nthere was a challenge, and a short parley, and a Kurd rode in with a\nmessage from his chief for Ranjoor Singh. The message was verbal,\nand had to be translated by Abraham, but I did not get to hear the\nwording of it. I was on guard.\n\n\"It is well,\" said Ranjoor Singh to me, when he went the rounds and\nfound me perched on a crag like a temple minaret, \"they are keeping\nfaith. The Wassmuss men are in the pass below us, and our friends\ndeny them passage. At dawn there will be a fight and our friends\nwill probably give ground. Two hours before dawn we will march, and\ncome down behind the Wassmuss men. Be ready!\"\n\nThe sahib will understand now better what I meant by saying Anim\nSingh has ears too big for his head. Because of his big ears, that\ncould detect a foot-fall in the darkness farther away than any of\nus, he had been sent to share the guard with me, and now he came\nlooming up out of the night to share our counsels; for since the\nnews of Gooja Singh's defection there was no longer even a pretense\nat awkwardness in approaching Ranjoor Singh. Anim Singh had been\namong the first to fling distrust to the winds and to make the fact\nevident.\n\nBut into those great ears, during all our days and weeks and months\nof marching, Gooja Singh had whispered--whispered. The things men\nwhisper to each other are like deeds done in the dark--like rats\nthat run in holes--put to shame by daylight. So Anim Singh came now,\nand Ranjoor Singh repeated to him what he had just told me. Anim\nSingh laughed.\n\n\"Leave the Kurds to fight it out below, then!\" said he. \"While they\nfight, let us eat up distance into Persia, gold and all!\"\n\nRanjoor Singh, with the night mist sparkling like jewels on his\nbeard, eyed him in silence for a minute. Then:\n\n\"I give thee leave,\" he said, \"to take as many men as share that\nopinion, and to bolt for your skins into Persia or anywhither! The\nrest of us will stay and keep the regiment's promise!\"\n\nThat was enough for Anim Singh. I have said he is a Sikh with a\nsoldier's heart. He wept, there on the ledge, where we three leaned,\nand begged forgiveness until Ranjoor Singh told him curtly that\nforgiveness came of deeds, not words. And his deeds paid the price\nthat dawn. He is a very good man with the saber, and the saber he\ntook from a Turkish officer was, weight and heft and length, the\nvery image of the weapon he was used to. Nay, who was I to count the\nKurds he slew. I was busy with my own work, sahib.\n\nThe fight below us began before the earliest color of dawn flickered\nalong the heights. And though we started when the first rifle-shot\ngave warning, hiding our plunder and mules among the crags in charge\nof the Syrians, but taking Tugendheim with us, the way was so steep\nand devious that morning came and found us worrying lest we come too\nlate to help our friends--even as once we had worried in the Red\nSea!\n\nBut as we had come in the nick of time before, even so now. We\nswooped all unexpected on the rear of the Wassmuss men, taking\nourselves by surprise as much as them, for we had thought the fight\nyet miles away. Echoes make great confusion in the mountains. It was\nechoes that had kept the Wassmuss men from hearing us, although we\nmade more noise than an avalanche of fighting animals. Straightway\nwe all looked for Wassmuss, and none found him, for the simple\nreason that he was not there; a prisoner we took told us afterward\nthat Wassmuss was too valuable to be trusted near the border, where\nhe might escape to his own folk. There is no doubt Wassmuss was\nprisoner among the Kurds,--nor any doubt either that he directs all\nthe uprising and raiding and disaffection in Kurdistan and Persia.\nAs Ranjoor Singh said of him--a remarkable man, and not to be\ndespised.\n\nSeeing no Wassmuss, it occurred to me at last to listen to orders!\nRanjoor Singh was shouting to me as if to burst his lungs. The Kurds\nwere fighting on foot, taking cover behind boulders, and he was\nbidding me take my command and find their horses.\n\nI found them, sahib, within an ace of being too late. They had left\nthem in a valley bottom with a guard of but twenty or thirty men,\nwho mistook us at first for Kurds, I suppose, for they took no\nnotice of us. I have spent much time wondering whence they expected\nmounted Kurds to come; but it is clear they were so sure of victory\nfor their own side that it did not enter their heads to suspect us\nuntil our first volley dropped about half of them.\n\nThen the remainder began to try to loose the horses and gallop away,\nand some of them succeeded; but we captured more than half the\nhorses and began at once to try to get them away into the hills. But\nit is no easy matter to manage several hundred frightened horses\nthat were never more than half tamed in any case, and many of them\nbroke away from us and raced after their friends. Then I sent a\nmessenger in a hurry to Ranjoor Singh, to say the utmost had been\nattempted and enough accomplished to serve his present purpose, but\nthe messenger was cut down by the first of a crowd of fugitive\nKurds, who seized his reins and fought among themselves to get his\nhorse.\n\nSeeing themselves taken in the rear, the Kurds had begun to fall\nback in disorder, and had actually burst through our mounted ranks\nin a wild effort to get to their own horses; for like ourselves, the\nKurds prefer to fight mounted and have far less confidence in\nthemselves on foot. Ranjoor Singh, with our men, all mounted, and\nour Kurdish friends, were after them--although our friends were too\nbusy burdening themselves with the rifles and other belongings of\nthe fallen to render as much aid as they ought.\n\nI left my horse, and climbed a rock, and looked for half a minute.\nThen I knew what to do; and I wonder whether ever in the world was\nsuch a running fight before. I had only lost one man; and it was\nquite another matter driving the Kurds' horses up the valley in the\ndirection they wished to take, to attempting to drive them\nelsewhere. Being mounted ourselves, we could keep ahead of the\nretreating Kurds very easily, so we adopted the same tactics again\nand again and again.\n\nFirst we drove the horses helter-skelter up the valley a mile or\ntwo. Then we halted, and hid our own horses, and took cover behind\nthe rocks to wait for the Kurds; and as they came, making a good\nrunning fight of it, dodging hither and thither behind the boulders\nto try to pick off Ranjoor Singh's men, we would open fire on their\nrear unexpectedly, thus throwing them into confusion again,--and\nagain,--and again.\n\nWe opened fire always at too great distance to do much material\ndamage, I thinking it more important to preserve my own men's lives\nand so to continue able to demoralize the Kurds, and afterward\nRanjoor Singh commended me for that. But I was also acutely aware of\nthe risk that our bullets might go past the Kurds and kill our own\nSikhs. I am not at all sure some accidents of that nature did not\nhappen.\n\nSo when we had fired at the Kurds enough to make them face about and\nso expose their rear to Ranjoor Singh, we would get to horse again\nand send the Kurdish horses galloping up the pass in front of us.\nFinally, we lost sight of most of the Kurdish horses, although we\ncaptured one apiece--which is all a man can manage besides his own\nand a rifle.\n\nBy that time it was three in the afternoon already and the pass\nforked about a dozen different ways, so that we lost the Kurds at\nlast, they scattering to right and left and shooting at us at long\nrange from the crags higher up. We were all dead beat, and the\nhorses, too, so we rested, the Kurds continuing to fire at us, but\ndoing no damage. They fired until dusk.\n\nOur own three hundred Kurdish friends were not very far behind\nRanjoor Singh, and I observed when they came up with us presently\nthat he took up position down the pass behind them. They were too\nfond of loot to be trusted between us and that gold! They were so\nburdened with plunder that some of them could scarcely ride their\nhorses. Several had as many as three rifles each, and they had found\ngreat bundles of food and blankets where the enemy's horses had been\ntethered. Their plundering had cost them dear, for they had exposed\nthemselves recklessly to get what their eyes lusted for. They had\nlost more than fifty men. But we had lost more than twenty killed,\nand there was a very long tale of wounded, so that Ranjoor Singh\nlooked serious as he called the roll. The Greek doctor had to work\nthat night as if his own life depended on it--as in fact it did! We\nmade Tugendheim help him, for, like all German soldiers, he knew\nsomething of first aid.\n\nThen, because the Kurds could not be trusted on such an errand,\nRanjoor Singh sent me back with fifty men to bring on the Syrians\nand our mules and belongings, and the gold. He gave me Chatar Singh\nto help, and glad I was to have him. A brave good daffadar is Chatar\nSingh, and now that all suspicion of our leader was weaned out of him,\nI could ask for no better comrade on a dark night. Night did I say?\nThat was a night like death itself, when a man could scarcely see his\nown hand held thus before his face--cold and rainy to make matters worse.\n\nWe had two Kurds to show us the way, and, I suppose because our\nenemies had had enough of it, we were not fired on once, going or\ncoming. Our train of mules clattered and stumbled and our Syrians\nkept losing themselves and yelling to be found again. Weary men and\nanimals ever make more noise than fresh ones; frightened men more\nthan either, and we were so dead weary by the time we got back that\nmy horse fell under me by Ranjoor Singh's side.\n\nOf all the nights I ever lived through, except those last we spent\nin the trench in Flanders before our surrender, that was the worst.\nHunger and cold and fear and weariness all wrought their worst with\nme; yet I had to set an example to the men. My horse, as I have\ntold, fell beside Ranjoor Singh; he dragged me to my feet, and I\nfell again, dizzy with misery and aching bones. Yet it was beginning\nto be dawn then, and we had to be up and off again. Our dead were\nburied; our wounded were bound up; the Kurds would be likely to\nbegin on us again at any minute; there was nothing to wait there\nfor. We left little fires burning above the long grave (for our men\nhad brought all our dead along with them, although our Kurdish\nfriends left theirs behind them) and I took one of the captured\nhorses, and Ranjoor Singh led on. I slept on the march. Nay, I had\nno eyes for scenery just then!\n\nAfter that the unexpected, amazing, happened as it so often does in\nwar. We were at the mercy of any handful who cared to waylay us, for\nthe hillsides shut us in, and there was cover enough among the\nboulders to have hidden a great army. It was true we had worsted the\nWassmuss men utterly; I think we slew at least half of them, and\ndoubtless that, and the loss of their horses, must have taken much\nheart out of the rest. But we expected at least to be attacked by\nfriends of the men we had worsted--by mountain cutthroats, thieves,\nand plunderers, any fifty of whom could have made our march\nimpossible by sniping us from the flanks.\n\nBut nothing happened, and nobody attacked us. As we marched our\nspirit grew. We began to laugh and make jokes about the enemy\nhunting for lost horses and letting us go free. For two days we\nrode, and camped, and slept a little, and rode on unmolested,\nclimbing ever forward to where we could see the peaks that our\nfriendly chief assured us were in Persia. For miles and miles and\neverlasting miles it seemed the passes all led upward; but there\ncame a noon at last when we were able to feel, and even see--when at\nleast we knew in our hearts that the uphill work was over. We could\nsee other ranges, running in other directions, and mountains with\ntree-draped sides. But chiefly it was our hearts that told us we\nwere really in sight of Persia at last.\n\nThen wounded and all gathered together, with Ranjoor Singh in the\nmidst of us, and sang the Anand, our Sikh hymn of joy, our Kurdish\nfriends standing by and wondering (not forgetting nevertheless to\nwatch for opportunity to snatch that gold and run!)\n\nAnd there, on the very ridge dividing Persia from Asiatic Turkey, it\nwas given to us to understand at last a little of the why and\nwherefore of our marching unmolested. We came to a crack in a rock\nby the wayside. And in the crack had been thrust, so that it stood\nupright, a gnarled tree-trunk, carried from who knows how far. And\nthere, crucified to the dry wood was our daffadar Gooja Singh, with\nhis flesh all tortured and torture written in his open eyes--not\nvery long dead, for his flesh was scarcely cold--although the birds\nhad already begun on him. Who could explain that? We sat our horses\nin a crowd, and gaped like fools!\n\nAt last I said, \"Leave him to the birds'.\" but Ranjoor Singh said\n\"Nay!\" Ramnarain Singh, who had ever hated Gooja Singh for reasons\nof his own, joined his voice to mine; and because they had no wish\nto offend me the other daffadars agreed. But Ranjoor Singh rose into\na towering passion over what we said, naming me and Ramnarain Singh\nin one breath as men too self-righteous to be trusted!\n\n\"What proof have we against him?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Try him by court martial!\" Ramnarain Singh screwed up courage to\nanswer. \"Call for witnesses against him and hear them!\"\n\n\"Who can try a dead man by court martial?\" Ranjoor Singh thundered\nback. \"He left us to go and be our hostage, for our safety--for the\nsafety of your ungrateful skins! He died a hostage, given by us to\nsavages. They killed him. Are ye worse savages than they? Which of\nour dead lie dishonored anywhere? Have they not all had burning or\nelse burial? Are ye judges of the dead? Or are ye content to live\nlike men? Take him down, and lay him out for burial! His brother\ndaffadars shall dig his grave!\"\n\nAye, sahib. So he gave the order, and so we obeyed, saying no more,\nbut digging a trench for Gooja Singh with bayonets, working two\ntogether turn and turn about, I, who had been all along his enemy,\ndoing the lion's share of the work and thinking of the talks he and\nI had had, and the disputes. And here was the outcome! Aye.\n\nIt was not a very deep trench but it served, and we laid him in it\nwith his feet toward India, and covered him, and packed the earth\ndown tight. Then we burned on the grave the tree to which he had\nbeen crucified, and piled a great cairn of stone above him. There we\nleft him, on the roof of a great mountain that looks down on Persia.\n\nIt was perhaps two hours, or it may have been three, after burying\nGooja Singh (we rode on in silence, thinking of him, our wounded\ngroaning now and then, but even the words of command being given by\nsign instead of speech because none cared to speak) that we learned\nthe explanation, and more with it.\n\nWe found a good place to camp, and proceeded to make it defensible\nand to gather fuel. Then some of the women belonging to our Kurdish\nfriends overtook us, and with them a few of our Kurdish wounded and\nsome unwounded ones who had returned to glean again on the\nbattlefield. These brought with them two prisoners whom we set in the\nmidst, and then Abraham was set to work translating until his tongue\nmust have almost fallen out with weariness. Bit by bit, we pieced a\ntale together that had reason in it and so brought us understanding.\n\nOur first guess had been right; the Turks had already sent (some\nsaid a full division) to wreak vengeance for our plundering of the\ngold. The Kurds of those parts, who fight among themselves like wild\nbeasts, nevertheless will always stand together to fight Turks;\ntherefore those who had been attacking us were now behind us with\nthousands of other Kurds from the tribes all about, waiting to\ndispute the passes with the common enemy. They considered us an\ninsignificant handful, to be dealt with later on. The women said the\nbattle had not begun; and the prisoners bade our Kurds swallow\ntribal enmity and hurry to do their share! The chief listened to\nthem, saying nothing. Has the sahib ever watched a savage thinking\nwhile lust drew him one way and pride another? Truly an interesting\nsight!\n\nBut the rest of the men were too interested to learn the reason of\nGooja Singh's torture and death to care for the workings of a\nKurdish chief's conscience. They crowded closer and closer,\ninterrupting with shouted questions and bidding each other be still.\nSo Ranjoor Singh said a word to Abraham and he changed the line of\nquestioning. The truth was soon out.\n\nGooja Singh, it seemed, probably not believing we had one chance in\na million, decided to contrive safety for himself. So with one Kurd\nto help him, he escaped in the night, and went and found Wassmuss in\na Kurdish village in the mountains. He told Wassmuss who we were,\nand whence we were, and what we intended. So Wassmuss (who must be a\nvery remarkable man indeed), although a prisoner, exerted so much\npersuasion forthwith that three hundred Kurds consented to escort\nthe party of Germans there and then to Afghanistan. He promised them\nI know not what reward, but the point is they consented, and within\neight hours of Gooja Singh's arrival the German party was on its\nway.\n\nThen Wassmuss sent the thousand Kurds to deal with us; but, as I\nhave told, we beat them. And that made the Kurds who held Wassmuss\nprisoner extremely angry with Gooja Singh; so they made him\nprisoner, too. And then, by signal and galloper and shouts from crag\nto crag came word that the Turks were marching in force to invade\nthe mountains, and instantly they turned on Gooja Singh and would\nhave torn him in pieces for being a spy of the Turks, sent on ahead\nto prepare the way. But some cooler head than the rest urged to put\nhim to the torture, and they agreed.\n\nWhether or not Gooja Singh declared under torture that we were Turks\nwe could not get to know, but it is certain that the Kurds decided\nwe were Turks, whatever Wassmuss swore to the contrary; and\ndoubtless he swore furiously! And because they believed us to be\nTurks, they let us be for the present, sure that we would try to\nmake our way back if they could keep the main Turkish forces from\nregaining touch with us. And Gooja Singh they presently crucified in\na place where we would almost surely see him, thinking thus to\nsurprise us with the information that all was known, and to frighten\nus into a state of comparative harmlessness--a favorite Kurdish\ntrick.\n\nThat did not account for everything. It did not account for our\nvictory over Turks in the hail-storm and our plunder of the Turks'\ncamp and capture of the gold. But none had seen that raid because of\nthe storm, and the spies who had said they talked with our men in\nthe night were now disbelieved. Our presence in the hills and Gooja\nSingh's escape was all set down to Turkish trickery; and doubtless\nthey did not believe we truly had gold with us, or they would have\ndetached at least a party to follow us up and keep in touch.\n\nThe clearest thing of all that the disjointed scraps of tale\nbetrayed was that we were in luck! If the Kurds believed us to be\nTurks, they were likely to let us wander at will, if only for the\nvery humor and sport of hunting us down when we should try to break\nback. \"No need to waste more labor setting this camp to rights!\"\nsaid I. \"We shall rest a little and be up and away again!\" And the\nwounded groaned, and some objected, but I proved right. Ranjoor\nSingh was no man to study comfort when opportunity showed itself. We\nrested two hours, and during those two hours our friend the Kurdish\nchief made tip his mind, and he and Ranjoor Singh struck a new\nbargain.\n\n\"Give me the gold!\" said he. \"Keep the hostages and ten of my men to\nguide you, and send them back when you are two days into Persia. I\ngo to fight against the Turks!\"\n\nWell, they bargained, and bargained. Ranjoor Singh offered him his\nchoice of a chest of gold then and there, or four-fifths of the\nwhole in Persia; and in the end he agreed to take three chests of\ngold then and there, and to leave us the hostages and thirty men to\nsee us on our way. \"For,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"how should the\nhostages and my prisoners return to you safely otherwise?\"\n\nSo we kept two chests of gold, and found them right useful\npresently. And we said good-by to him and his men, and put out our\nown fires and rode eastward. And of the next few days there is\nnothing to tell except furious marching and very little sleep--nor\nmuch to eat either.\n\nOnce we were well into Persia we bought food right and left, paying\nfabulous prices for it with gold from our looted chests. Here and\nthere we traded a plundered rifle for a new horse, sometimes two new\nhorses. Here and there a wounded man would die and we would burn his\nbody (for now there was fuel in plenty). Day after day, night after\nnight, Ranjoor Singh kept in the saddle, hunting tirelessly for news\nof the party of Germans on ahead of us. Their track was clear as\ndaylight, and on the fifth day (or was it the sixth) after we\nentered Persia he learned at last that we were only a day or two\nbehind them. Like us, they were in a hurry; but unlike us, they had\nno Ranjoor Singh to force the pace and do the scouting, so that for\nall their long lead we were overtaking them.\n\nLike us, they seemed wary of the public eye, for they followed\nlonely routes among the wooded foothills; but their Kurdish horsemen\nleft a track no blind man could have missed, and although they\nplundered a little as they went, they spent gold, too, like water,\nso that the villagers were in a strange mood. Most of the plundering\nwas done by their Kurdish escort who, it seemed, kept returning to\nsteal the money paid by the Germans for provisions. Sometimes when\nwe offered gold we would be mocked. But on the whole, we began to\nhave an easy time of it--all but the wounded, who suffered tortures\nfrom the pace we held. We secured some carts at one village and put\nour wounded in them, but the carts were springless, and there were\nno roads at all, so that it was better in those days to be a dead\nman than a sick or wounded one! There was no malingering!\n\nAfter a few days (I forget how many, for who can remember all the\ndays and distances of that long march?) Abraham got word of a great\nChristian mission station where thousands of Christians had sought\nsafety under the American flag. He and his Syrians elected to try\ntheir fortune there, and we let them go, all of us saluting Abraham,\nfor he was a good brave man, fearful, but able to overcome his fear,\nand intelligent far beyond the ordinary. We let the Syrians take\ntheir rifles and some ammunition with them, because Abraham said\nthey might be called on perhaps to help defend the mission.\n\nNot long after that, we let our Kurds go, giving up our Turkish\nofficer prisoners and Tugendheim as well. We all knew by that time\nwhat our final goal was, and Tugendheim begged to be allowed to go\nwith us all the way. But Ranjoor Singh refused him.\n\n\"I promised you to the Kurd, and the Kurd will trade you to Wassmuss\nagainst his brother,\" he said. \"Tell Wassmuss whatever lies you\nlike, and make your peace with your own folk however you can. Here\nis your paper back.\"\n\nTugendheim took the paper. (You remember, sahib, he had signed a\nreceipt in conjunction with the Turkish mate and captain of that\nship in which we escaped from Stamboul.) Well, he took the paper\nback, and burned it in the little fire by which I was sitting facing\nRanjoor Singh.\n\n\"Let me go with you!\" he urged. \"It will be rope or bullet for me if\never I get back to Germany!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"I promised to deliver you to\nWassmuss when we made you prisoner in the first place. I must keep\nmy word to you!\"\n\n\"I release you from your word to me!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"And I promised you to the Kurdish chief.\"\n\n\"The Kurdish chief?\" said Tugendheim. \"What of him? What of it? Why,\nwhy, why--he is a savage--scarcely human--not to be weighed in the\nscales against a civilized man! What does such a promise as that\namount to?\" And he stood tugging at his mustaches as if he would\ntear them out.\n\n\"I have some gold left,\" said Ranjoor Singh, when he was sure\nTugendheim had no more to say, \"and I had seriously thought of\nbuying you for gold from these Kurds. There may be one of them who\nwould take on himself the responsibility of speaking for his chief.\nBut since you hold my given word so light as that I must look more\nnearly to my honor. Nay, go with the Kurds, Sergeant Tugendheim!\"\n\nTugendheim made a great wail. He begged for this, and he begged for\nthat. He begged us to give him a letter to Wassmuss explaining that\nwe had compelled him by threats of torture. He begged for gold. And\nRanjoor Singh gave him a little gold. Some of us put in a word for\nhim, for on that long journey he had told many a tale to make us\nlaugh. He had suffered with us. He had helped us more than a little\nby drilling the Syrians, and often his presence with us had saved\nour skins by convincing Turkish scouts of our bona fides. We thought\nof Gooja Singh, and had no wish that Tugendheim should meet a like\nfate. So, perhaps because we all begged for him, or perhaps because\nhe so intended in the first place, Ranjoor Singh relented.\n\n\"The Persians hereabouts,\" he said, \"all tell me that a great\nRussian army will come down presently from the north. Have I heard\ncorrectly that you meditated escape into Russia?\"\n\nTugendheim answered, \"How should I reach Russia?\"\n\n\"That is thy affair!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"But here is more gold,\"\nand he counted out to him ten more golden German coins. \"You must\nride back with these Kurds, but I have no authority over them. They\nare not my men. They seem to like gold more than most things.\"\n\nSo Tugendheim ceased begging for himself and rode away rather\ndespondently in the midst of the Kurds; and we followed about a day\nand a half behind the German party with their strange box-full of\nmachinery. There were many of us who could talk Persian, and as we\nstopped in the villages to beg or buy curdled milk, and as we\nrounded up the cattle-herdsmen and the women by the wells, we heard\nmany strange and wonderful stories about what the engine in that box\ncould do. I observed that Ranjoor Singh looked merry-eyed when the\nwildest stories reached him; but we all began to reflect on the\ndisastrous consequences of letting such crafty people reach\nAfghanistan. For, as doubtless the sahib knows, the amir of\nAfghanistan has a very great army; and if he were to decide that the\nGerman side is after all the winning one he might make very much\ntrouble for the government of India.\n\nAnd now there was no longer any doubt that the machine slung in the\nbox between two mules was a wireless telegraph, and that most of the\nother mules were loaded with accessories. The tales we heard could\nnot be made to tally with any other explanation. And what, said we,\nwas to prevent the Germans in Stamboul from signaling whatever lies\nthey could invent to this party in Afghanistan, supposing they\nshould ever reach the country? Yet when we argued thus with Ranjoor\nSingh, he laughed.\n\nAnd then, after about a week of marching, came Tugendheim back to\nus, ragged and thirsty and nearly dead, on a horse more dead than\nhe. He had bought himself free from the Kurds with the gold Ranjoor\nSingh gave him; but because he had no more gold the Persians had\nrefused to feed him. \"How should he find his way alone to meet the\nRussians,\" he said, \"whose scouts would probably shoot him on sight\nin any case?\" So we laughed, and let him rest among our wounded and\nbe one of us,--aye, one of us; for who were we to turn him away to\nstarve? He had served us well, and he served us well again.\n\nHas the sahib heard of Bakhtiari Khans? They are people as fierce as\nKurds, who live like the Kurds by plundering. The Germans ahead of\nus, doubtless because Persia is neutral in this war and therefore\nthey had no conceivable right to be crossing the country, chose a\nroute that avoided all towns and cities of considerable size. And\nPersia seems to have no army any more, so that there was no official\nopposition. But the Bakhtiari Khans received word of what was doing,\nand after that there were new problems. But for the fact that\nTugendheim was with us in his ragged German uniform we should have\nhad more trouble than we did.\n\nAt first the Khans were content with blackmail, holding up the\nGermans at intervals and demanding money. But I suppose that finally\ntheir money all gave out, and then the Kahns put threats into\npractise. But before actual skirmishing began the Khans would come\nto us, after getting money from the Germans, and it was only the\nfact that we had Tugendheim to show that convinced them we belonged\nto the party ahead. Ranjoor Singh claimed that our transit fee had\nbeen paid for us already, and the Khans did not deny it.\n\nBut they caught up the Germans again and demanded money from them\nbecause of us who were following, and I have laughed many a time to\nthink of the predicament that put them in. For could they deny all\nknowledge of us? In that case they might he denying useful allies in\ntheir hour of need. If the Bakhtiari Khans should annihilate us\ntheir own fate would not be likely to tremble in the balance very\nlong. Yet if they admitted knowledge of us, what might that not lead\nto? And how was it possible for them to know really who we were in\nany case?\n\nFinally, they sent one of their Kurdish servants back to find us and\nask questions. And to him we showed Tugendheim, and spoke to him at\ngreat length in Persian, of which he understood very little; so that\nwhen he overtook his own party again (if he ever did, for the Khans\nwere on the prowl and very cruel and savage), they may have been\nmore in the dark about us than ever.\n\nAt last the Bakhtiari Khans began guerrilla warfare, and the Kurds\nwho were escorting the Germans retaliated by burning and plundering\nthe villages by which they passed--which incensed the Khans yet\nmore, because they did not belong to that part of Persia and had\ncounted on the plunder for themselves. From time to time we caught a\nBakhtiari Khan, and though they spoke poor Persian, some of us could\nunderstand them. They explained that the Persian government, being\nvery weak, made use of them to terrorize whatever section of the\ncountry seemed rebellious--surely a sad way to govern a land!\n\nThere were not very many of the Khans. They are used to raiding in\nparties of thirty to fifty, or perhaps a hundred. I think there were\nnot many more of them than of the German party and us combined; and\nat that the Bakhtiari Khans were all divided into independent\ntroops. So that the danger was not so serious as it seemed. But\nguerrilla warfare is very trying to the nerves, and if we had not\nhad Ranjoor Singh to lead us we should have failed in the end; for\nwe were fighting in a strange land, with no base to fall back on and\nnothing to do but press forward.\n\nThe Kurds, too, who escorted the Germans, began to grow sick of it.\nLittle parties of them began to pass us on their way home, giving us\na wide berth, but passing close enough, nevertheless, to get some\nsort of protection from our proximity, and the numbers of those\nparties grew and grew until we laughed at the thought of what\nanxiety the Germans must be suffering. Yet Ranjoor Singh grew\nanxious, too, for the Khans grew bolder. It began to look as if\nneither Germans nor we would ever reach half-way to the Afghan\nborder. Ranjoor Singh was the finest leader men could have, but we\nwere being sniped eternally, men falling wounded here and there\nuntil scarcely one of us but had a hurt of some kind--to say nothing\nof our sick. Men grew sick from bad food, and unaccustomed food, and\nhard riding and exposure. Our little Greek doctor took sick and\ndied, and we had nothing but ignorance left with which to treat our\nailments. We began to be a sorry-looking regiment indeed.\nNevertheless, the ignorance helped, for at least we did not know how\nserious our wounds were. I myself received one bullet that passed\nthrough both ankles, and it is not likely I shall ever walk again\nwithout a limp. Yet if I can ride what does that matter so long as\nthe government has horses? And if a man limps in both feet wherein\nis he the loser? Mine was a slight wound compared to some of them.\nWe had come to a poor pass, but Ranjoor Singh's good sense saved the\nday again.\n\nThere came a day when the Bakhtiari Khans gave us a terrible last\nattention and then left us--as it turned out for good (although we\ndid not know then it was for good). We watched their dust as their\ndifferent troops gathered together and rode away southward. I\nsuppose they had received word of better opportunity for plunder\nsomewhere else; they took little but hard knocks from us, and\ndoubtless any change was welcome. When we had seen the last of them,\nand had watched the vultures swoop down on a horse they had left\nbehind, we took new heart and rode on; and it so happened that the\nGermans chose that occasion for a rest. Their dwindling Kurdish\nescort was growing mutinous and they took advantage of a village\nwith high mud walls to get behind cover and try to reestablish\nconfidence. Perhaps they, too, saw the Bakhtiari Khans retiring in\nthe distance, for we were close behind them at that time--so close\nthat even with tired horses we came on them before they could man\nthe village wall. We knocked a hole in the wall and had a good wide\nbreach established in no time, to save ourselves trouble in case the\ngates should prove too strongly held; and leaving Anim Singh posted\nin the breach with his troop, Ranjoor Singh sent a trooper with a\nwhite flag to the main gate.\n\nAfter ten or fifteen minutes the German commanding officer rode out,\nalso with a white flag, and not knowing that Ranjoor Singh knew\nGerman, he spoke English. (Tugendheim had taken his tunic off\nand--all sweaty and trembling had hidden behind the ranks disguised with\na cloth tied about his head.) I sat my horse beside Ranjoor Singh,\nso I heard all.\n\n\"Persia is neutral territory!\" said the German.\n\n\"Are you, then, neutral?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Are you?\" asked the German. He was a handsome bullet-headed man\nwith a bold eye, and I knew that to browbeat or trick him would be\nno easy matter. Nevertheless he still had so many Kurds at his back\nthat I doubted our ability to get the better of him in a fight,\nconsidering our condition.\n\n\"I could be neutral if I saw fit,\" answered Ranjoor Singh, and the\nGerman's eyes glittered.\n\n\"If you are neutral, ride on then!\" he laughed. I saw his eye teeth.\nIt was a mean laugh.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Minding my business,\" said the German pointedly.\n\n\"Then I will mind mine and investigate,\" said Ranjoor Singh, and he\nturned to me as if to give an order, at which the German changed his\ntactics in a hurry.\n\n\"My business is simple,\" said the German. \"Perfectly simple and\nperfectly neutral. We have a wireless installation with us. It is\nall ready to set up in this village. In a few moments we shall be\nreceiving messages from Europe, and then we shall inform the\ninhabitants of these parts how matters stand. As neutrals they are\nentitled to that information.\" Their eyes met, each seeking to read\nthe other's mind, and the German misunderstood, as most Germans I\nhave met do misunderstand.\n\n\"Before we can receive a message we shall send one,\" said the\nGerman. \"Before I came out to meet you, I gave the order to get in\ntouch with Constantinople and signal this: That we are being\ninterfered with and our lives are endangered on neutral territory by\ntroops belonging to British India, and therefore that all British\nIndian prisoners-of-war in Germany should be made hostages for our\nsafety. That means,\" he went on, \"that unless we signal every day\nthat all is well, a number of your countrymen in Germany\ncorresponding to the number of my party will be lined up against a\nwall and shot.\"\n\n\"So that message has been sent?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the German.\n\n\"Then send this message also,\" said Ranjoor Singh: \"That the end has\ncertainly come. Then close up your machine because unless you wish\nto fight for your existence there will be no more messages sent or\nreceived by you between here and Afghanistan.\"\n\nI thought that a strange message for Ranjoor Singh to bid him send.\nI did not believe that one of us, however weary, was willing to\naccept relief at the price of our friends' lives. Nevertheless, I\nsaid nothing, having learned it is not wise to draw too swift\nconclusions when Ranjoor Singh directs the strategy.\n\nBut the German evidently thought so, too, for his eyes looked\nstartled, and I took comfort from that.\n\n\"I understand you wish to reach Afghanistan?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"That is our eventual destination,\" said the German.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Pack up your machine. Then I will\npermit your journey to the Afghan border, unhampered by me, on two\nconditions.\"\n\n\"What two conditions?\" asked the German.\n\n\"That your machine shall remain packed up until you reach\nAfghanistan, and that your doctor shall divide his services until\nthen equally between your men and mine.\"\n\n\"And after that, what?\" asked the German.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with Afghanistan,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Keep\nthe bargain and you are free as far as I am concerned to do what you\nlike when you get there.\"\n\nSo we had a doctor again at last, for the German agreed to the\nterms. Not one of us but needed medical aid, and the men were too\nglad to have their hurts attended, to ask very many questions; but\nthey were certainly surprised, and suspicious of the new\narrangement, and I did not dare tell them what I had overheard for\nfear lest suspicion of Ranjoor Singh be reawakened. I refused even\nto tell the other daffadars, which caused some slight estrangement\nbetween them and me. However, Ranjoor Singh was as conscious of that\nrisk as I, and during all the rest of the long march he kept their\ncamp and ours, their column and ours half an hour's ride\napart--sometimes even farther--sometimes half a day apart, to the disgust\nof the doctor, who had that much more trouble, but with the result\nof preventing greater friction.\n\nTo tell of all that journey across Persia would be but to remember\nweariness--weariness of horse and men. Sometimes we were attacked;\nmore often we were run away from. We grew sick, our wounds festered\nand our hearts ached. Horses died and the vultures ate them. Men\ndied, and we buried or burned their bodies according or not as we\nhad fuel. We dried, as it were, like the bone-dry trail we followed,\nand only Ranjoor Singh's heart was stout; only he was brave; only he\nhad a song on his lips. He coaxed us, and cheered us, and rallied\nus. The strength of the regiment was but his strength, and as for\nthe other party, who hung on our flank, or lagged behind us or\npreceded us by half a day, their Kurds deserted by fives and tens\nuntil there was scarcely a corporal's guard remaining.\n\nThey must have been as weary as we, and as glad as we when at last\nat the end of a long drawn afternoon, we saw an Afghan sentry.\n\nHas the sahib ever seen an Afghan sentry?\n\nThis one was gray and old and sat on his gray pony like a huddled\nape with a tattered umbrella over his shoulder and his rifle across\nhis knees. He looked less like a sentry than like a dead man dug up\nand set there to scare the birds away. But he was efficient, no\ndoubt of that. He had seen us and passed on word of us the minute we\nshowed on the sky-line, and the hills all about him were full of\narmed men waiting to give us a hot reception if necessary and to bar\nfarther progress in any case.\n\nSo there we had to camp, just over the Afghan border, but farther\napart from the Germans than ever--two, three miles apart, for now it\nbecame Ranjoor Singh's policy to know nothing whatever about them.\nThe Afghans provided us with rations and sent us one of their own\ndoctors dressed in the uniform of a tram-car conductor, and their\nhighest official in those parts, whose rank I could not guess\nbecause he was arrayed in the costume of a city of London policeman,\nasked innumerable questions, first of Ranjoor Singh and then of each\nof us individually. But we conferred together, and stuck to one\npoint, that we knew nothing. Ranjoor Singh did not know better than\nwe. The more he asked the more dumb we became until, perhaps with a\nview to loosing our tongues, the Afghans who mingled among us in the\ncamp began telling what the Germans were saying and doing on the\nrise two miles away.\n\nThey had their machine set up, said they. They were receiving\nmessages, said they, with this wonderful wireless telegraph of\ntheirs. They kept receiving hourly news of disasters to the Allied\narms by land and sea. And we were fearfully disturbed about all\nthis, because we knew how important it must be for India's safety\nthat Afghanistan continue neutral. And why should such savages\ncontinue neutral if they were once persuaded that the winning side\nwas that of the Central Powers? Nevertheless, Ranjoor Singh\ncontinued to grow more and more contented, and I wondered. Some of\nthe men began to murmur.\n\nIn that camp we remained, if I rightly remember, six days. And then\ncame word from Habibullah Kahn, the Afghan amir, that we might draw\nnearer Khabul. So, keeping our distance from the Germans, we helped\none another into the saddle (so weak most of us were by that time)\nand went forward three days' march. Then we camped again, much\ncloser to the Germans this time, in fact, almost within shouting\ndistance; and they again set up their machine, causing sparks to\ncrackle from the wires of a telescopic tower they raised, to the\nvery great concern of the Afghans who were in and out of both camps\nall day long. One message that an Afghan told me the Germans had\nreceived, was that the British fleet was all sunk and Paris taken.\nBut that sort of message seemed to me familiar, so that I was not so\ndepressed by it as my Afghan informant had hoped. He went off to\nprocure yet more appalling news to bring me, and no doubt was\naccommodated. I should have had burning ears, but that about that\ntime, their amir came, Habibullah Kahn, looking like a European in\nhis neatly fitting clothes, but surrounded by a staff of officers\ndressed in greater variety of uniforms than one would have believed\nto exist. He had brought with him his engineers to view this\nwonderful machine, but before approaching either camp--perhaps to\nshow impartiality--he sent for the German chief and one, and for\nRanjoor Singh and one. So, since the German took his doctor, Ranjoor\nSingh took me, he and I both riding, and the amir graciously\nexcusing me from dismounting when I had made him my salaam and he\nhad learned the nature of the wound.\n\nAfter some talk, the amir asked us bluntly whence we came and what\nour business might be, and Ranjoor Singh answered him we were\nescaped prisoners of war. Then he turned on the German, and the\nGerman told him that because the British had seen fit to cut off\nAfghanistan from all true news of what was happening in the world\noutside, therefore the German government, knowing well the open mind\nand bravery and wisdom of the amir and his subjects, had sent\nhimself at very great trouble and expense to receive true messages\nfrom Europe and so acquaint with the true state of affairs a ruler\nand people with whom Germany desired before all things to be on\nfriendly terms.\n\nAfter that we all went down in a body--perhaps a hundred men, with\nthe amir at our head, to the German camp; and there the German and\nhis officers displayed the machine to the amir, who, with a dozen of\nhis staff around him, appeared more amused than astonished.\n\nSo the Germans set their machine in motion. The sparks made much\ncrackling from the wires, at which the amir laughed aloud. Presently\nthe German chief read off a message from Berlin, conveying the\nkaiser's compliments to his highness, the amir.\n\n\"Is that message from Berlin?\" the amir asked, and I thought I heard\none of his officers chuckle.\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness,\" said the German officer.\n\n\"Is it not relayed from anywhere?\" the amir asked, and the German\nstared at him swiftly--thus, as if for the first time his own\nsuspicion were aroused.\n\n\"From Stamboul, Your Highness--relayed from Stamboul,\" he said, as\none who makes concessions.\n\nThe amir chuckled softly to himself and smiled.\n\n\"These are my engineers,\" said he, \"all college trained. They tell\nme our wireless installation at Khabul, which connects us through\nSimla with Calcutta and the world beyond, is a very good one, yet it\nwill only reach to Simla, although I should say it is a hundred\ntimes as large as yours, and although we have an enormous dynamo to\ngive the energy as against your box of batteries.\"\n\nThe Germans, who were clustered all about their chief, kept straight\nfaces, but their eyes popped round and their mouths grew stiff with\nthe effort to suppress emotion.\n\n\"This, Your Highness, is the last new invention,\" said the German\nchief.\n\n\"Then my engineers shall look at it,\" said the amir, \"for we wish to\nkeep abreast of the inventions. As you remarked just now, we are a\nlittle shut off from the world. We must not let slip such\nopportunities for education.\" And then and there he made his\nengineers go forward to inspect everything, he scarce concealing his\nmerriment; and the Germans stood aside, looking like thieves caught\nin the act while the workings were disclosed of such a wireless\napparatus as might serve to teach beginners.\n\n\"It might serve perhaps between one village and the next, while the\nbatteries persisted,\" they said, reporting to the amir presently.\nThe amir laughed, but I thought he looked puzzled-perplexed, rather\nthan displeased. He turned to Ranjoor Singh:\n\n\"And you are a liar, too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, Your Royal Highness, I speak truth,\" said Ranjoor Singh,\nsaluting him in military manner.\n\n\"Then what do you wish?\" asked the amir. \"Do you wish to be\ninterned, seeing this is neutral soil on which you trespass?\"\n\n\"Nay, Your Royal Highness,\" answered Ranjoor Singh, with a curt\nlaugh, \"we have had enough of prison camps.\"\n\n\"Then what shall be done with you?\" the amir asked. \"Here are men\nfrom both sides, and how shall I be neutral?\"\n\nThe German chief stepped forward and saluted.\n\n\"Your Royal Highness, we desire to be interned,\" he said. But the\namir glowered savagely.\n\n\"Peace!\" said he. \"I asked you nothing, one string of lies was\nenough! I asked thee a question,\" he said, turning again to Ranjoor\nSingh.\n\n\"Since Your Royal Highness asks,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"it would be a\nneutral act to let us each leave your dominions by whichever road we\nwill!\"\n\nThe amir laughed and turned to his attendants, who laughed with him.\n\n\"That is good,\" said he. \"So let it be. It is an order!\"\n\nSo it came about, sahib, that the Germans and ourselves were ordered\nhotfoot out of the amir's country. But whereas there was only one\nway the Germans could go, viz, back into Persia, there to help\nthemselves as best they could, the road Ranjoor Singh chose was\nforward to the Khyber Pass, and so down into India.\n\nAye, sahib, down into India! It was a long road, but the Afghans\nwere very kind to us, providing us with food and blankets and giving\nsome of us new horses for our weary ones, and so we came at last to\nLandi Kotal at the head of the Khyber, where a long-legged English\nsahib heard our story and said \"Shabash!\" to Ranjoor Singh--that\nmeans \"Well done!\" And so we marched down the Khyber, they signaling\nahead that we were coming. We slept at Ali Mas jib because neither\nhorses nor men could move another yard, but at dawn next day we were\noff again. And because they had notice of our coming, they turned\nout the troops, a division strong, to greet us, and we took the\nsalute of a whole division as we had once taken the salute of two in\nFlanders, Ranjoor Singh sitting his charger like a graven image, and\nwe--one hundred three-and-thirty men and the prisoner Tugendheim,\nwho had left India eight hundred strong-reeling in the saddle from\nsickness and fatigue while a roar went up in Khyber throat such as I\nscarcely hope to hear again before I die. Once in a lifetime, sahib,\nonce is enough. They had their bands with them. The same tune burst\non our ears that had greeted us that first night of our charge in\nFlanders, and we--great bearded men--we wept like little ones. They\nplayed IT IS A LONG, LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY.\n\nThen because we were cavalry and entitled to the same, they gave us\nBONNIE DUNDEE and the horses cantered to it; but some of us rolled\nfrom the saddle in sheer weakness. Then we halted in something like\na line, and a general rode up to shake hands with Ranjoor Singh and\nto say things in our tongue that may not be repeated, for they were\nwords from heart to heart. And I remember little more, for I, too,\nswooned and fell from the saddle.\n\nThe shadows darkened and grew one into another. Hira Singh sat\ndrawing silently in the dust, with his injured feet stretched out in\nfront of him. A monkey in the giant tree above us shook down a\nlittle shower of twigs and dirt. A trumpet blared. There began much\nbusiness of closing tents and reducing the camp to superhuman\ntidiness.\n\n\"So, sahib,\" he said at last, \"they come to carry me in. It is time\nmy tale is ended. Ranjoor Singh they have made bahadur. God grant\nhim his desire! May my son be such a man as he, when his day comes.\n\n\"Me! They say I shall be made commissioned officer--the law is\nchanged since this great war began. Yet what did I do compared to\nwhat Ranjoor Singh did? Each is his own witness and God alone is\njudge. Does the sahib know what this war is all about?\n\n\"I believe no two men fight for the same thing. It is a war in each\nman's heart, each man fighting as the spirit moves him. So, they\ncome for me. Salaam, sahib. Bohut salaam. May God grant the sahib\npeace. Peace to the sahib's grandsons and great-grandsons. With each\narm thus around a trooper's neck will the sahib graciously excuse me\nfrom saluting?\"\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Hira Singh, by Talbot Mundy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HIRA SINGH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4400.txt or 4400.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/4/0/4400/\n\nProduced by Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
